Falun is the administrative centre of the Dalarna province in Sweden. It's the largest town in the area with about 40,000 inhabitants, slightly more than its close neighbour and friendly rival Borlänge.


Understand[edit]
See also: mining tourism
Falun was built around the old copper mine, which was operational as early as the 11th century. The mine was an important resource during the years of the Swedish Empire and made Falun Sweden's second largest city around mid-17th century.
The mine was depleted by the beginning of the 1990s, and now it has become a tourist attraction and made it to the UNESCO World Heritage List. Stora Kopparberg (now Stora Enso), the mining company, is still active, although nowadays in the forest industry. It claims to be the world's oldest company, having supposedly existed more than a millennium.
The Dalarna province is by many considered to be the very essence of Sweden, with Dala Horses (see below) and traditional midsummer festivities. Falun has made some contributions to the Swedish heritage as well. Prime examples, and memories of the mining, are Falu Red Paint (Falu rödfärg) and the Falu Sausage (Falukorv). The red colour of the copper was used to make a brownish red paint that has become hugely popular in Sweden. The archetypal image of idyllic Sweden seems to somehow always include a Falu red wooden cottage with white corners. The Falu sausage, thick and ring-shaped, is one of few food products protected by the EU through a "certificate of special character" which states what ingredients must be in a Falu Sausage. The sausage was originally made by meat from the thousands of oxen whose hides were used to make ropes for the copper mine. Today, pork as well as beef is used in the sausages.

By bus[edit]
There are very few bus connections from other cities.Swebus Express[dead link] has 1-2 connections a day with Stockholm and Gothenburg.

Falun is small enough to be explored on foot, however there is a local bus network handled by Dalatrafik. The price for a bus ticket is 22 kr for adults and 17 kr for children. Infants travel for free.

By bike[edit]
Bicycle is good way of getting around except for during snowy winter. Bikes for rental are available at:

By taxi[edit]
Taxis in Sweden are pricey. If you want to take a cab in Falun, you will most likely have to phone and ask for one to pick you up – you'd be extremely lucky to catch an available one on the street. Exceptions are the railway station where there is a taxi stand, and weekend nights in the centre. Major taxi companies in Falun include:

 TaxiKurir Falun, ☏ +46 23 153 00. Smart phone app offers address based routing and calculates price according to them. (updated Aug 2020)
 Koppartaxi, ☏ +46 23 630-00. 
 Taxi Falun, ☏ +46 23 189-00. 
By car[edit]

Copper mine[edit]
The mining museum (yellow building), near the edge of the Great Pit. Central Falun is in the background.
60.60022215.6166031 Falun Copper Mountain, Gruvplatsen 1, ☏ +46 23 78-20-30. The mine and its surroundings were added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in December 2001 – a must-see when in Falun. The mine was an important source of copper for an entire millennium until mining ended December 8, 1992. Part of it is still open for visitors with a guide. The interesting tour, with English translation available upon request, takes about an hour and visitors are taken 65 m underground. Tickets are bought in the souvenir shop, and helmets and raincoats are handed out before the tour. Do not wear your best shoes or trousers, since the red, copper-rich mud in the mine causes stains. Shoe protection is available in the souvenir shop for 5 kr. 220 kr for adults. (updated Sep 2017)
 Mining Museum. It has exhibitions about the history of the mine and of coins in Sweden (including the largest coins in the world), and scale models of mining inventions by medieval tech genius Christoffer Polhem. Also an exhibition on minerals. Much of the museum is child friendly. Accessible by wheel chair (ask for instructions). Texts in Swedish and English. 90 kr, included in the underground guided tour fee. (updated Sep 2017)
 The Great Pit (Stora Stöten). This can be seen from the surface for free. It's the result of an enormous collapse in the mine in 1687, and with a depth of 95 m and a diameter of 400 m, it's an impressive sight. Miraculously nobody was killed in the collapse since it occurred on Midsummer's Day when the miners were free from work! (updated Sep 2017)

He was discovered 42 years later, and since the conditions in the mine had preserved his body, his former fiancée immediately recognized him. Fet-Mats' corpse was put on display as an attraction for visitors – it wasn't until 1930 that he was finally laid to rest.

Buy[edit]
Falu Maiden
Unlike the neighboring town of Borlänge, Falun doesn't have a dominating shopping mall outside the town centre. Thus the best shopping is downtown, mainly along the streets Slaggatan/Holmgatan and Åsgatan. If you're interested in local handicraft look for the Dalarnas Hemslöjd store by the main cobblestone square of Stora Torget, but be prepared for quite hefty pricetags. There's also handicraft and souvenirs available at the mine.
The most common souvenir from Falun and the Dalarna province is the Dala Horse (Dalahäst), a symbol of Sweden. This small wooden horse has been carved since the 17th century. It is usually orange or blue and decorated with kurbits painting, a symmetrical type of decoration. If you want a genuine one, expect to pay at least 100 kr for the smallest kind.
If the Dala Horse feels too mainstream and you want a symbol of the town of Falun rather than a symbol of Dalarna, look for a Falu Maiden (Falujungfru). This lady is far from the fame of the Dala Horse and is not as easy to find in the shops. Look for the dress and the hat.
A third option is to buy a Kåre Goat. According to legend, the copper mine in Falun was discovered when the goat Kåre one day showed up at home with reddish dirt on his horns. Kåre's owner followed the goat into the woods the next day and saw him rub his horns in the ground, and thus the copper was found. A large wooden Kåre Goat stands on the mining area, overlooking road 50 towards Borlänge.

Self-catering is always the cheapest way to get a meal in Sweden and there's plenty of food stores in Falun where it's possible to stock up. If you're starving in the middle of the night, run to the Statoil gas station which is open 24 hr daily and offers hot dogs and groceries. Fast food is also available at the many pizzerias, at the Swedish fast food chain Sibylla, at McDonald's near Lugnet or at Gandhis Gatukök at the main square.
Close to the train station, you can find a 7-Eleven gas station, that also offers some food and MAX Burgers.
