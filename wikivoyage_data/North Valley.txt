North Valley is the northern region of the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles. It is made up of the neighborhoods of Arleta, Granada Hills, Lakeview Terrace, Mission Hills, Northridge, North Hills, Pacoima, Panorama City, Sun Valley, Sunland, Sylmar, Tujunga, and the city of San Fernando.


Understand[edit]
North Hills is mainly residential but has a few sites of minor note including the Sepulveda Unitarian-Universalist Society (nicknamed 'The Onion' for its appearance) and Bull Creek (where the motorcycle chase scene in Terminator 2 was filmed). North Hills has a deserved reputation as one of the Valley's major gang hotspots. Although generally safe during the day, exercise caution in this area at night.

Get in[edit]
Interstate 5, the 405 Freeway, and I-210 run north-south through the area, with the 5 and 405 linking to Valley neighborhoods south while the 210 runs along the foothills to the San Gabriel Valley. CA-118 is a major east-west freeway that links the San Fernando and North Hills neighborhoods to those to the west, such as Northridge.
Metrolink commuter trains serve the area. Northridge has a stop at 8775 Wilbur Ave along the weekday Ventura County Line, while the Sun Valley and Sylmar/San Fernando stops are served by the daily Antelope Valley Line. Metro offers bus service through the area.
