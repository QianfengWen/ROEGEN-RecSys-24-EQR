Campinas is a city in São Paulo state, Brazil, and the core municipality of the Grande Campinas, a metropolitan area with 2.8 million people, the second largest in the state after Grande São Paulo. Campinas is a major center of industry, services and research, holding the 11th highest GDP of Brazil and being responsible for 15% of all scientific research of the country. The city is home to State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), considered (QS Ranking 2012) the second best university of the country and the third best of Latin America.
For a visitor, besides the obvious business/academic opportunities, Campinas offers the shopping, gastronomy and nightlife typical of a large city, but with ease of access to the beautiful landscape and the scenic towns of the Mantiqueira mountain range. Campinas also hosts a considerable historical heritage from the late 19th century, associated with the prosperity of coffee farming during this period.


Districts[edit]
Downtown Campinas.
The main district of Campinas contains two high-rise areas: Downtown, the oldest part of the city and main shopping area and transport hub, and just next to it, Cambuí, an affluent neighborhood with several restaurants, bars and hotels. The rest of the main district is mostly composed of low-rise suburbs of different social profiles, with points of interest relatively spread.
Sousas and Joaquim Egídio, adjacent to each other, offer lots of nature and a charming historic center. Several gated communities have also popped up in this area.
Barão Geraldo is the district that contains UNICAMP, plus several companies and research centers. It is basically a collection of calm suburbs, but with good infrastructure of commerce and services, and a substantial number of restaurants and bars.
Nova Aparecida is a more industrial/suburban district and should not be of interest to a visitor.
Understand[edit]
Campinas is certainly not a main tourism destination, attracting more business travellers, international students and research visitors than conventional tourists. It offers however a number of interesting things to do for the casual visitor, such as exploring the city's coffee farming heritage and its lively nightlife.

History[edit]
The Casa Grande and Tulha, in Jardim Proença, are the remnants of Campinas' first coffee farm.
Campinas started as a simple outpost for Portuguese settlers on 1774. It become a municipality on 1797, with the name of Vila de São Carlos. The city grew and prospered in subsequent decades with sugarcane farming, followed by coffee farming by the end of 19th century. After the decline of the coffee farming, Campinas started to re-emerge after the 1930s by means of industry development and more diversified exported-oriented agriculture. It eventually became the center of Brazil's major important industrial areas, which includes nearby municipalities such as Paulínia, Americana and Valinhos, collectively forming the Campinas metropolitan area. The creation of State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), in 1966, also resulted in the city becoming one of the country's most important centers of research and technology, hosting several research institutes and technology startup companies.

Culture[edit]
Campinas' culture can be described as a mix of the urban, cosmopolitan São Paulo city and the rural, caipira culture of the countryside of the São Paulo's state. The city's many bars and clubs play international pop music as much as sertanejo music. Demographically speaking, Campinas is similar to São Paulo, with a strong Portuguese and Italian heritage as well as a sizeable population of descendants of Japanese as well as migrants from the Northeast of Brazil.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Campinas has its own an international airport, but many international and domestic visitors arrive from São Paulo's airports.

By Viracopos International Airport[edit]
-23.006944-47.1344441 [formerly dead link] Viracopos International Airport (VCP  IATA).   (updated Dec 2021) Viracopos Airport is one of the main airports in the state of São Paulo and the main hub of the airline Azul Brazilian Airlines. It has flights to Fort Lauderdale, Lisbon and Orlando, and seasonal flights to Punta del Este.
To arrive from the airport to the city, one can use the following options:

 Taxi. Taxi prices from the airport are either by meter or by fixed price according to the destination. Fixed prices are not mandatory - taxi users have always the option of choosing to use the meter, but generally there is not much difference between both. By fixed price, as of Oct 2015, a trip to UNICAMP would cost R$ 141 (flag 1) or R$ 181 (flag 2). To the intercity bus terminal , R$ 81 (flag 1) or R$ 103 (flag 2). The full list of destinations can be found in the EMDEC website. 
 Local bus. Every 30 min, from 06:10 to 00:08. The cheapest option. Line 193, that has a 30 minutes time delay and cost R$4,50, this line stops at the main Campinas streets and at the main local bus station, from which you can get buses to other points of the city and to other local bus stations without extra cost. R$4,50, to be paid on board. 
 [dead link] Lirabus Shuttle Bus, ☏ +55 19 3234-1000. Every hour. The shuttle bus operated by LiraBus is a cheap option and good if you have luggage. It stops at Largo do Pará Square (city center) and at the intercity bus station, where you can get a bus to other Brazilian cities or a taxi. One way R$9. 
 Rent a car. There are two car rentals at the airport and the prices for economy class cars are close to R$70 a day. 
By Guarulhos/Congonhas airports[edit]
The airports of Guarulhos and Congonhas are both about 1:40 minutes away by car. Cab trips are somewhat pricey but you can take a shuttle from Lirabus [formerly dead link]  that goes directly to Campinas and take about 2 hours. It costs R$40 from Guarulhos, R$35 from Congonhas, and will leave you at Largo do Pará Square, one block from Hotel Ibis, or at Terminal Multimodal Ramos de Azevedo (Rodoviária). From there you can get buses or taxis to other points of the city.
A far less attractive option is to use the Airport Bus Service from EMTU [1] that goes to Terminal Rodoviário Barra Funda and stop at Terminal Rodoviário Tietê, where you have to take an intercity bus to Campinas. This option is both more expensive and takes a longer time (about 3 hours) than the LiraBus direct bus, so it would typically only be used in an emergency.

By bus[edit]
The modern bus terminal Ramos de Azevedo is Campinas' main terrestrian transport hub.
Buses to Campinas arrive at Terminal Multimodal Ramos de Azevedo (Rua Dr. Pereira Lima - Centro), in (Botafogo). Bus tickets can even be reserved and purchased by Internet for the main bus companies. You would need to check on the bus station which company serves to a certain destination in particular.
Buses from São Paulo are however quite frequent (4-5 departures per hour) and reserving in advance is seldom necessary. The two companies that operate buses from São Paulo are Viação Cometa and Lirabus [dead link]. The ticket costs R$25 and the trip takes about 1 hr 20 min (often more because of traffic in São Paulo).
However, do not use such buses if you just want to get to the Viracopos airport (there are buses from São Paulo that go directly to the airport).

By train[edit]
The only passenger train operating in Campinas is the weekend touristic ride to and from Jaguariúna (see #Do section). At some point in the future, Campinas is expected to be linked by high speed train to São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, and by commuter train to São Paulo and Jundiaí.

Get around[edit]
Map of Campinas
On foot[edit]
Downtown Campinas, containing most of the city's shopping and historical buildings, is a relatively large area but still easier to be explored on foot, given the large amount of traffic. The center of Sousas/Joaquim Egídio is also an excellent area to walk.
Other areas of Campinas don't offer much in terms of sightseeing, but calm, green suburbs like Parque Taquaral, Nova Campinas, and Cidade Universitária (in Barão Geraldo), can offer a nice leisurely stroll.

By bicycle[edit]
Campinas has a very limited network of cycleways; there is for instance one that links the center of the Barão Geraldo district with the UNICAMP, and another surrounding Parque Portugal. It is better to cycle in calmer suburbs, with small amount of traffic. Cycling is a popular means of transport for the students of UNICAMP.

By bus[edit]
Despite being a city with more than 1 million inhabitants, Campinas does not have any mass rapid transit system, although a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system is under implementation. Buses are hence the only option of public transport; check the EMDEC company website for routes and itineraries.
As with most large Brazilian cities, buses are confusing, and can be overcrowded and slow (as they often get stuck in traffic), but they are relatively frequent and reach practically everywhere.
Although it is not easy to find where are the bus stops and which bus to catch, people on the street will be glad to help if they can understand you. There are several main bus terminals, where you can transfer from one line into another. Some urban buses even go to neighbor cities as Jaguariúna and Paulínia.
Campinas has adopted a prepaid smartcard for paying buses, the Bilhete Único, that allows you to take multiple buses in a 2-hour period paying only a single tariff (R$3,30 as of May 2013). A visitor can obtain a Bilhete Único for free in the main bus terminals, by bringing an identity document and charging as little as R$9,00 (two tariffs).

-22.909066-47.0624511 Central bus terminal (Terminal Central). The central bus terminal, most local and regional routes stop here. (updated Aug 2020)
By car[edit]
If driving a car, be aware that some avenues have been converted to one-way streets to form a ring around downtown. Sometimes it can be tricky to find your way back and be careful not to get into the wrong way on one of those avenues.
After 22:00 until 06:00, some traffic lights are turned off and just blink yellow. Don't be scared, this is not effect of a Martian invasion. For safety reasons, you are not supposed to be stopped at red lights late at night.
Be aware, however, that during normal hours red lights and speed are enforced by cameras everywhere in the city, so stick to the speed limits and don't cross red lights.

Buy[edit]
Rua 13 de Maio is the city's most important shopping street.
 Downtown. Downtown Campinas is the main shopping area of the city, and you probably can find cheaper products here than in the suburbs or shopping malls. A good place to start your shopping is the pedestrianized Rua Treze de Maio (where the Catedral Metropolitana sits), that contains all major chain stores like C&A, Pernambucanas and Americanas. Downtown streets shops are typically open M-F 08:00-19:00, Sa 08:00-17:00. During December, before Christmas, working hours are generally extended. 
 Central Market (Mercadão), Av. Benjamim Constant, Praça Carlos Botelho - Centro, ☏ +55 19 3232-3679. Nice place to find exotic food and to feel the charm that Campinas had in its past. It is downtown close to two main bus stations, which takes some of this beauty away but makes the local easily accessible. It is a great spot for people watching. 
 Hippie Fair (Feira Hippie), Praça Imprensa Fluminense, no number - Cambuí (at Centro de Convivência), ☏ +55 19 3232-4168. Sa Su 09:00-14:00. The art crafts fair now is officially called "Feira de Arte, Artesanato, Antiguidades, Esotéricos e Quitutes de Campinas" but with such a long name, all the locals still call it by its old and more charming name: Feira Hippie. The fair started in the 1970s and since then a lot has changed: its location, size, and products, and today actual hippie vendors are rare. This is a must-do in Campinas. It is possible to buy all kinds of arts and crafts: paintings, jewellery, clothes, house articles, shoes, bags, etc. The food section is an amazing trip through local and Brazilian cuisine: pasteis (fried dumplings), empanadas, and pies share space with regional food and as well as dishes brought by immigrants and fully adopted by the Brazilians, such as yakisoba and sushi. 
Shopping malls[edit]

Eat[edit]
The affluent neighborhood of Cambuí has the highest concentration of bars and restaurants in Campinas.
While, like most of the state, Campinas has the fairly typical paulistano range of Italian, Japanese, Middle Eastern, and standard Brazilian food, it doesn't have anything much that might be called campineiro food. The two most notable things might be the local penchant for arugula salad (salada de rúcula) and the local lancherias' habit of serving their sandwiches cut into bite size pieces, dubbed the "angel-mouth cut" (corte boca-de-anjo). Among desserts, you should not miss the torta holandesa (Dutch pie) which, despite its name, was invented in Campinas.

Stay safe[edit]
Campinas is pretty much similar to São Paulo in terms of crime problems. During the day, most of the city is considerably safe - exceptions are the "Crackland" area in the Botafogo neighborhood (Downtown) and some lower class suburbs. Fortunately, the intercity bus terminal has been moved from Botafogo, so there is no need anymore for a visitor to wander this area.
The Downtown area is not safe during the night and should be avoided. Cambuí and most affluent suburbs are relatively safe during the night, but take a cab or drive yourself if you have to walk anything more than a few blocks. If you just want to fool around during the evening, a safer bet is to go to one of the city's shopping malls.
The districts of Barão Geraldo, Sousas and Joaquim Egídio are safer than the main district, but crime does happen and staying alert to your surroundings during the night is always a good idea.
