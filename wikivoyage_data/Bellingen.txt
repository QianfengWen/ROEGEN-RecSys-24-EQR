Bellingen is a pretty town of 13,000 people (2021) in a green valley on the Mid-North Coast of New South Wales. Bellingen is slightly alternative lifestyle, with more than its share of arts, crafts and markets.  It caters well for travellers. 


Understand[edit]
Although it has a typically mild and tropical climate, it can really rain when it chooses to which it does almost every day in the wet season, and the low level bridge across the Bellinger river in central Bellingen is subject to flooding.
