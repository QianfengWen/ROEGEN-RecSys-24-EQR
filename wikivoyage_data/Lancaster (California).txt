The Musical Road
Created for a Honda commercial, America's only "musical" road is on Avenue G near Lancaster, CA, between 30th St. W. and 40th St. W. You must travel westbound in the left-most lane of the three-lane road. Grooves cut into the road at intervals cause tire vibrations so that a car driving at 55 miles per hour hears the William Tell Overture (known to many as the theme from the Lone Ranger).  The section of road proved so popular that it was re-located to this less populated stretch of highway and is now sponsored by the city of Lancaster.  Videos of what you can expect to see and hear can be found on YouTube.


By car[edit]
 California State Highway 14, the Antelope Valley Freeway, is the primary north - south route in and out of Lancaster. It ends in Los Angeles in the South and heads North to Reno, Nevada.
 California State Highway 138 heads east out of the "next door" city of Palmdale to the south and heads west along Avenue D, 6 miles north of Lancaster in unincorporated Los Angeles County. CA-138 runs co-extensively with CA-14 from Avenue D to Palmdale Blvd. Highway 138 leads to the "Grapevine" area of Interstate 5 to the west, and the Inland Empire (Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario) to the east.
By plane[edit]

By bus[edit]
Greyhound Bus Lines stops at the Lancaster Metrolink station and also at the nearby Palmdale Transportation Center. If continuing to your final destination using the local public bus system, the Antelope Valley Transit Authority, it is advisable to get off at the Palmdale Transportation Center instead, since it is the principal hub for the AVTA and you have more connection options (5) there than the Lancaster Metrolink station, which connects to only 2 lines.

Rosamond - north of Lancaster on Highway 14, Rosamond is primarily a bedroom community in the desert of the Antelope Valley, although it does have food and lodging options for tourists, and is home to a non-profit center dedicated to feline protection where visitors can see cats ranging in size from the tiny fishing cat up to the Siberian tiger.
Palmdale - Lancaster's twin city is south on Highway 14.  In 1962 Palmdale became the first city in the Antelope Valley to incorporate, and today it is home to over 150,000 people.
