Understand[edit]
Shyamrai Temple
Madanmohan Temple

Bishnupur (BIHSH-noo-poor) was the citadel of the Malla dynasty. The dynasty was founded in the late 7th century by Adi Malla. Adi Malla was the abandoned son of a North Indian king. He was brought up by a Bramhim of the present-day Bishnupur region. The brahmin family provided him with the best education along with physical and warfare training. The boy not only excelled in education but also turned out to be an outstanding wrestler. Soon on the request of the local elders, he ascended the throne of the local kingdom, which was renamed as the Malla Kingdom (Malla meaning wrestling) and he is known as Adi Malla.
The Malla Kingdom flourished and after about 300 years the 10th Malla King Jagat Malla decided to shift his kingdom to Bishnupur. Over the next 800 years, Jagat Malla and his descendants built several temples and structures (both of brick and stone) turning Bishnupur into a temple town. Among the present structure, the oldest structure of Bishnupur is the Rasmancha dating back to 1600. The other structures were built in the next 150 years.
Although known for its terracotta temples Bishnupur also has its fair share of stone temples. In fact, these laterite stone temples outnumber the brick or terracotta temples. Moreover, the temples of Bishnupur follow different styles of Bengal Temple Architecture and include both chala (sloped roof) and ratna (pinnacle) temples. Apart from the temples and other religious structures a small portion of the fortification of the citadel still remains.

Bishnupur being a temple town, the focus is on temples, several of them built of terracotta during the reign of the Malla kings, who ruled over the area prior to the arrival of the British. Bishnupur also hosts several laterite stone temples along with several other religious and non-religious structures. The sites of Bishnupur are clustered around the Rasmancha. They can be classified into four groups:

Rasmancha and north of Rasmancha
South of Rasmancha
Further north
North west
Rasmancha and north of Rasmancha[edit]
This area contains three of the best-known terracotta structures of Bishnupur. They are Shyamrai Temple, Kestorai Temple and the Rasmancha. This is a compact area and walking can be a good leisurely option. People who are short of time can opt for a cycle rickshaw.

23.068387.32211 Rasmancha. Built in 1600 by Bir Hambir it is the oldest standing structure in Bishnupur. The pyramidal structure stands on a high platform approached by a long flight of stairs. It consists of arched entrances separated by pillars and is crowned with a stepped pyramidal structure surrounded by smaller typical Bengal styled sloped roofed structures. It is architecturally unique and one of its kind in the whole of Bengal, probably in the whole of India. Sadly apart from a few floral lotus motif the Rasmancha does not contain any terracotta art work. It is not a temple and hence does not house any idol but during the festival of Ras all the idols from different temples of Bishnupur are brought at the Rashmancha for public display.   
23.070987.32412 Shyamrai Temple (Pancha Ratna Temple). The temple has five pinnacle, hence the name Panch Ratna. Built in 1643 by King Raghunath Singha. It is one of the largest temples of Bishnupur. The temple is accessible by triple arched entrance on all the four sides All the walls are richly decorated with terracotta carvings featuring aspects of Lord Krishna’s life.   
23.07035787.3258593 Gumgarh. A window door less square structure located atop a small mound. Nothing much is known about the construction date and the purpose for which it was built. Some opine it was a prison while other believe it was a granary. Sadly it is nothing spectacular. 
23.071787.32684 Kestorai Temple (Jorbangla Temple). It follows the jora bangle style of architecture and hence is popularly known as the Jorbangle Temple. Her two buildings shaped like a typical Bengal hut joined together with a small turret on top. It is the most interesting one from the architectural point of view. Built by King Raghunath Singha Dev II in 1655 it is considered as one of the finest example of terracotta art in Bengal. All four sides of the temple are covered with the most intricate terracotta panels covering a wide range of topics. Panels of ships and boats are quiet in the temple. There are also several panels from the two great epics but a panel depicting Bishma is sarasajya (bed of arrows) stands out among all.   
23.07250687.3264335 Radheshyam Temple. Just next to the Kestorai Temple is the Radhashyam Temple. This Ek – ratna (Single Pinnacled) temple is built of laterite stone and contains lime stone stucco decoration.

23.07474587.3257628 Choto Pathar Darja (Small Stone Gateway). Once the temple town of Bishnupur was surrounded by a high wall complete with bastions. The walls were punctured by gateways gateways providing access to the fortified temple town. The fortified walls have long crumbled to dust and a couple of gateways remain on the northern end of the city. The Choto Pathar Darja (or small stone gateway) is the souther of the two gateways. The small gateway with an arched passageway is built of laterite stone.  
23.07429987.3262339 Baro Pathar Darja (Big Stone Gateway, Gate of Old Fort). This is the second of the two surviving gateways of the fortified temple town of Bishnupur. This lies north of the small stone gateway and is much larger in size. Unlike its smaller counterpart, this gateway is not just a passageway but comes with a complete defensive mechanism. The double-tiered gateway comes in with a guard house at the top level whole with narrow slits allowing the archers and the gunmen to fire their shots. North of the gateway is a 17th-century laterite stone chariot, which follows the ekaratna (single-pinacled) style of architecture.  (updated Dec 2022)
