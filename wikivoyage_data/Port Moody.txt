Port Moody is a city in the Vancouver eastern suburbs of British Columbia, Canada.  Set on the eastern end of the Burrard Inlet, it has some fine waterfront property.  It's primarily a residential community, just close enough to commute to Vancouver for work.  High-rise developments on the water, such as NewPort Village, have also spurred retail and entertainment districts.
