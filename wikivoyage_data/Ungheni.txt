Soviet Mosaic in Ungheni
Ungheni is in Moldova on the border to Romania.


Understand[edit]
The seventh largest city of the country, and the seat of the Ungheni District, it's also an important border town. The Prut river separates Moldova and Romania, and it's crossed by a railway bridge. As the two countries uses different rail gauges, there's a bogie exchange facility at the railyard. Across the border there's another, much smaller town by the same name.

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
Passenger trains between Moldova and Romania stop here, so you can get in by train from for example Chișinău, Iași or Bucharest. See the website of the Moldovan Railways (Calea Ferată din Moldova) for schedules and tickets.

By car[edit]
The nearest road crossing from Romania is in Sculeni, about 30 km north. Ungheni is of course accessible by car from elsewhere in Moldova.
