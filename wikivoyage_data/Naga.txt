As the center of commerce in Camarines Sur, Naga City serves as the hub for other cities and municipalities in the province. The Central Bus Terminal offers one the means to get to other areas of Camarines Sur. One may take buses or filcabs. Buses make frequent stops to every town they pass through to pick up passengers. Filcabs are vans whose original seats are removed and refitted to accommodate more passengers. They are usually faster way to get to your destination but they have a practice of filling up all the seats before they leave.
Buses from Naga City to Manila normally start from 5:30AM. Ask to be routed through Pasay City or nearby EDSA for more convenient travel to downtown Manila.
