History[edit]
The city of Ozamiz grew out of an old Spanish town called Misamis. Misamis developed  because of the Spanish garrison stationed at the stone fort called Nuestra Senora dela Concepcion del Triunfo, which was built some time in the 18th century to control the pirate activities in the nearby Lanao area. In 1850, the town of Misamis became the capital of the District of Misamis.
In October 1942 Wendell Fertig established the command headquarters of the growing guerrilla resistance to the Japanese occupation of Mindanao in the Spanish fort in the city. His headquarters was abandoned June  1943, in the face of a large Japanese attack. Until the end of the war the Japanese occupied this fort.
After the Second World War, Misamis was renamed Misamis to "Ozamiz" after a World War II hero, José Ozámiz, who hailed from the province of Misamis Occidental and who at one time also served as its governor and congressional representative of the Lone District of Misamis Occidental, a delegate to the 1935 Constitutional Convention that resulted in the creation of the 1935 Constitution for the Philippine Commonwealth Government. In 1941, José Ozámiz was elected to the Philippine Senate.
