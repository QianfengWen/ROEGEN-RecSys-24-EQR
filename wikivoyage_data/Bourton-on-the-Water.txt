a scene along the river Windrush, Bourton
Bourton-on-the-Water is famed for its picturesque High Street. Lying on the meandering River Windrush with several low arched stone bridges resulted in the village becoming known as "Venice of the Cotswolds".  


Understand[edit]
River Windrush

With a population of around 3,300, it is a large village whereas nearby Stow-on-the-Wold and Burford with smaller populations are both "Market Towns".
The River Windrush source, 10 miles from the village, is fed by springs and thus continues to flow even in severe drought.
There is evidence of habitation dating back to neolithic times (4,000 BC), habitation continuing through to Roman times (Roman pottery and coins found in the village show extended Roman occupation). Christian occupation dates back to 709 AD when a wooden church was built. In 1110 a stone Normal church was built; today only the chancel (from 1328) remains.
Today almost all buildings are of 17th-century origin, mostly built using Cotswold limestone characteristic of the area.
