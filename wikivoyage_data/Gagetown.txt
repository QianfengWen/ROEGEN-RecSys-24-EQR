Gagetown is a village of 700 people (2016) in the Saint John River Valley region of New Brunswick.


Understand[edit]
It is the birthplace of Sir Leonard Tilley, a Father of Canadian Confederation. 
It hosts an artists' colony and marina on the Saint John river between the entrances to Washdemoak Lake and Grand Lake, two excellent three season sailing paradises. From the sea, The reversing falls at Saint John present an obstacle except during slack tide, when many vessels transit the gorge. The sea side harbour hosts cruise ships and ocean cargo vessels, with a public dock attached below the Delta Hotel, beside the Coast Guard dock, at one end of the sheltered pedestrian walk to the farmer's market at city centre, about half a mile walk away, with many other shopping facilities and attractions nearby. The river continues on, up to just below downtown Fredericton, where a railway bridge no longer opens to sailboats, about 80 mi (130 km) above the falls.
The military base, CFB Gagetown, is closer to Oromocto, to the west of the village.
