History[edit]
Roman bridge of Tevira
The city was founded in 1890 BC under the name Talábriga. During the Arab occupation, it became, together with Faro and Silves, one of the most important cities in the Algarve. It was conquered by the Christian army in 1242.
During the 17th century it was considered one of the main cities in the Algarve, although signs of decay were beginning to appear. The activity of its port reduced and the city lost importance as a strategic and economic point. Today the city is thriving thanks to the economic boost that the tourism sector has received since the 1960s across the Algarve.

Climate[edit]
Tavira has a mild climate, with hot summers and humid winters, with more rain in the months of November and December.
