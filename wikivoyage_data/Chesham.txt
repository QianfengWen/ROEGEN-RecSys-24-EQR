Chesham is a market town set at the convergence of several valleys in the Chiltern Hills. The nearest towns are Amersham and Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire. The River Chess rises just to the north of the town. Its history can be summed up by the phrase "the four Bs of Chesham: boots, beer, brushes and Baptists" which relates to the growing prosperity of the town in the 18th century and being a focus for religious dissent and nonconformity. The population has doubled to around 20,000 since the Second World War. Politically, control of the town has swung between the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats.
