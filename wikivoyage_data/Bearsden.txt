Bearsden is a town 6 miles northwest of Glasgow in East Dunbartonshire on Clydeside, with a population of 28,470 in 2020. The main reason to visit is the Roman bath house, built in the brief period when the Romans occupied the Antonine Wall.  


Understand[edit]
The Romans built a military road north from the Clyde along the shore of Loch Lomond into the Highlands, as well as a coast-to-coast defence, the Antonine Wall, with an associated road. Here the two roads intersected, so there was a large fort, and probably a civilian settlement. But the Romans only stayed 20 years then retreated to Hadrian's Wall so the brambles reclaimed the site and it never became the nucleus of a town. Nothing much else happened for over 1000 years. In 1649 a new church was built, dividing the parish of Kilpatrick that had been almost the size of Dunbartonshire, with a huddle of buildings around it.
Milngavie a few miles north developed industry in this early modern period, but New or Easter Kilpatrick remained farmland until 1863 when the railway arrived. It suddenly became an attractive place for Glasgow businessmen to build their mansions, just far enough away from the malodorous source of their fortunes. Suddenly there was a prosperous new commuter suburb, with handsome Victorian red sandstone buildings, many of which still stand. The suburb took its name from Bearsden railway station, which in turn was from the nearby Bearsden House. No-one knows where that name originated, except that no bears were involved. The town adopted a coat of arms and motto "Bear the Gree" which means to take first place, to excel — "gree" indicates degree, status or pedigree.

55.920485-4.327981 Roman Bath House, Roman Road G61 2HS. 24 hr. The Antonine Wall was built more simply than Hadrian's Wall, and the Romans only occupied it from 142 to 162 AD then again briefly after 208, so its remains are sparse. But building work here in the 1970s uncovered a Roman bathhouse, with seven rooms, plus hot and cold water systems and latrines which showed traces of the military diet. So it's the most extensive Roman structure in Scotland. It was part of New Kilpatrick wall fort, with Bearsden wall fort a couple of miles west, but hardly anything remains of these. Free.
