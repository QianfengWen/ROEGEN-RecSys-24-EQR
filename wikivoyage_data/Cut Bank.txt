Cut Bank is a small city in northwest Montana, near Glacier National Park. It has a population of about 3,000 and is the county seat of Glacier County.


Understand[edit]
Glacier County is home to about half of Glacier National Park, and most of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, though Cut Bank is not on the reservation.  Once the "Oil Capital of Montana," oil production has diminished and Cut Bank is now a regional service center for Blackfeet Reservation and surrounding area, including the east approach to Glacier National Park.  Cut Bank has gained national attention from time to time by sometimes reporting the coldest temperature in the 48 contiguous states.  However, being in Montana's "Chinook Zone," it can also report rapid warming in mid-winter accompanied by strong Southwest winds.
Additional information is available from the Cut Bank Chamber of Commerce and from the Cut Bank Pioneer Press.
