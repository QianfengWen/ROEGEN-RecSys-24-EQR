From the closest major airport, Chubu Centrair International Airport (NGO IATA) near Nagoya, Matsumoto can be reached by rail in roughly three hours by the Meitetsu line and JR limited express train (change in Nagoya). Buses connect Centrair with Matsumoto in around 3½–4 hr for ¥3,500.
From Narita Airport (NRT IATA), Matsumoto can be reached in 4½–5 hr by limited express rail service (change in Shinjuku).

By rail[edit]
Matsumoto station
Matsumoto is located on the JR Shinonoi Line. It is four stops away from Shiojiri, the "mid-point" of the Chuo Main Line between Tokyo and Nagoya. There is a tourist information center inside the train station.
Limited express trains run to Matsumoto from Tokyo's Shinjuku station. The Azusa (あずさ) makes the journey in about 2¾ hr (¥6,500). Local trains also make the trip, but it's cheaper and faster to go by bus.
There's also the option of taking the Hokuriku Shinkansen Kagayaki (かがやき), Hakutaka (はくたか), or Asama (あさま) from Tokyo to Nagano station, then taking the Wide View Shinano (ワイドビューしなの) limited express to Matsumoto (2½–3 hr, ¥8,470).
The Wide View Shinano also runs from Nagoya station, where there are connections with the Tokaido Shinkansen (towards Kyoto and Osaka). The run from Nagoya to Matsumoto takes 2 hr on the limited express and costs ¥5,830; local trains cost ¥3,350 and take between 4–5 hr, depending on the available trains and connections.
All of the above-mentioned rail trips are free when using the Japan Rail Pass.

By bus[edit]
Highway buses from JR Matsumoto station connect to Shinjuku in Tokyo (3 hr, ¥3,400), Nagoya (3¼ hr, ¥3,460), and various destinations in the Japan Alps, notably the Oku-Hida Onsen Villages (1½ hr, ¥2,300–2,800).

Get around[edit]
Town Sneaker
On foot[edit]
You can walk to Matsumoto Castle, about a mile northeast of the station, in about 20 minutes.

By local bus[edit]
Alternatively, the Town Sneaker Bus by Alpico Kotsu departs from in front of Matsumoto Station every 30 minutes and makes a circular trip to all city sights — it costs ¥200 each time you get off. ¥500 for a day ticket. Half-price for children.

By rail[edit]
To visit the Japan Ukiyo-e Museum, however, you will have to go by train or taxi or get the Town Sneaker to the City Government Office then walk for 25 minutes.

By bicycle[edit]
Bicycles are convenient for visiting sights not accessible by Town Sneaker bus.
Free bicycles are supposedly available daily 08:30–17:00 at various locations throughout town, including the Matsumoto City Museum next to Matsumoto Castle and the Kaichi Gakko Primary School. Ask the Matsumoto Tourist Information staff for details. However, as of 2023, they were nowhere able to be found
Otherwise, you can rent a bike from JR Eki Rent-A-Car beside the station for ¥1,500/day. Or the bicycle station north of the castle near the junction also offers bicycle for ¥1,000-2,000.

36.23868137.96951 Matsumoto Castle (松本城 Matsumoto-jō) (15 min north of Matsumoto station on foot). 08:30 to 17:00 daily. Completed around 1593-94, this stately landmark is one of the 12 original castles remaining in Japan, having been spared from the ravages of war and time. Designated a National Treasure of Japan, today it's considered one of the top 3 to visit along with Himeji Castle and Kumamoto Castle. Visitors can climb up precarious stairways all the way to the top, and the castle also houses a comprehensive exhibit on the history of firearms in Japan. ¥700, but the best pictures are made from outside anyway.   (updated Sep 2023)
36.24246137.994842 Matsumoto Folkcraft Museum (松本民芸館, matsumoto mingeikan) (Take the bus on the Utsukushigahara line for 15 minutes and get off that the Folkcraft Museum bus stop). Tu-Su 09:00-17:00, closed from December 29 through January 3.. This is a very small museum filled with a variety of arts and crafts that the museum's own pamphlet describes as not being of much value either artistically or monetarily. The museum is basically the collection of a private individual, Taro Maruyama, who ran a folkcraft shop in Matsumoto in the 1950 and 1960s. He presented the museum to the city of Matsumoto in 1983. While some of the crafts and artwork are interesting, the museum is probably not worth visiting unless you are spending a considerable amount of time in the vicinity or are particularly interested in Japanese Folkcrafts. On an interesting side note, a home near the museum, owned by a school principal, has a beautiful garden and is quite pretty, employing some traditional Japanese architecture. Our tour guide said many people found the home of more interest than the museum. ¥300 for adults. School children can get in for free and the museum offers group rates for groups over 20. 
36.23183137.934623 Japan Ukiyo-e Museum. Featuring over 10,000 pieces of ukiyo-e (traditional woodblock prints), it is the largest private museum of its kind in the world. Though the building housing the museum is imposing, a rather small selection of the pieces is shown at any time (2 rooms, about 40 prints). Also reprints of famous Ukiyo-e are on display. The collection was begun over 200 years ago by Yoshiaki Sakai and was subsequently added to by succeeding generations of the Sakai family, including the current owner and CEO of the museum, Nobuo Sakai. The collection includes many pieces from the most famous ukiyo-e artists in history as well as works that are believed to be the last remaining examples of their kind. English signage at the museum is limited, but an English-language pamphlet is available. In addition to Matsumoto Castle mentioned above; it is a must-see for those looking for something truly 'Japanese.'   
36.161431138.0234284 Uchibuse River French Waterfall (牛伏川フランス式階段工) (About 20 minutes' drive SSE from Matsumoto Station. Signs are lacking; GPS navigation is helpful.). These tiered waterfalls are located in a large scenic park. The falls themselves can be seen in ten minutes, though there are several kilometers of trails for more adventurous souls. There are dozens of picnic spots along the road to the falls. The parking lot closest to the falls has a restroom, though there is no tap water. free.   (updated Oct 2015)

Do[edit]
Walk along the river around Nawate-dōri
Matsumoto is surrounded by numerous campsites and onsen. A hiking map in English can be picked up from the information center, a 5-minute walk south of the castle.

Hike to Misuzuko (美鈴湖) – To go down, take the bus from Matsumoto bus station (beside the Epsa supermarket) to Utsukushigahara-kogen (美ヶ原), 51 minutes, ¥930 (May 2009) to Lake Misuzu; walk around the east side of the lake to the Toy Box (もりの国) campsite (start along the main road, take a footpath to the right; when you come to another road, turn left along it until a path goes up to the left; follow this up to and through the campsite). Exit the campsite by its main gate, turn left, at the first guardrail leave the road to the right and follow the path down along a ridge. (Pause in the first section to admire the eagles.) There are no signposts, but the path is clear, with some trail markers; after about an hour you will find yourself among houses uphill from Asama-onsen (浅間); Matsumoto station is another hour and a half, of which part can be along the Metoba River (女鳥羽川).

The street's ubiquitous mascot is a frog, originating from frogs in the river as well as a pun on the Japanese word for "return", kaeru — frogs were given as a charm so that loved ones would return safely from the treacherous mountains, and also so that money and goods would also return.

Go next[edit]
Azumino
Hakuba – A popular ski resort
Oku-Hida Onsen Villages – Some of Japan's best hot springs, 90 minutes away by bus
Kamikochi – One of the best hiking points in the Japanese Alps, en route to Takayama.
Chikuma - Visit the onsens, mountains and temples of this small city on the Chikuma River — take the Shinonoi railway northeast to Obasute or Inariyama stations
Norikura Kogen (乗鞍高原) – An alpine plateau alongside some of Japan's highest mountains and makes for a great day trip or longer stay in the mountains. There are hiking trails, cycling routes, skiing and spectacular mountain roads. There is the renowned milky-water valley onsen at Shirahone and a milky-water onsen at Norikura (near Kanko tourist centre) with mountain views, including Yukemurikan opposite the tourist centre and bus stop. For a day trip from Matsumoto, buy a combined train/bus return ticket from the first machines next to the ticket office — ¥3,300 to Norikura or ¥3,500 to Shirahone — and take the electric railway from track 7 to Shin-Shimashima, then transfer to the Alpico Highland Shuttle right outside the station gate. For Norikura, the best stop is probably "Kanko center mae", outside the tourist office and Yukemurikan. Check timetables first.
