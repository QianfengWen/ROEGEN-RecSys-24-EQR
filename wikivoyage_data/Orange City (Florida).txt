Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Volusia Ave is the main road to Orange City, connecting it with DeLand to the north and DeBary to the south. Many businesses face the street although it is a major route, so given the dense traffic it can be slower than most main roads in the area. Graves Ave is the main road from the east with access to the historic district and Volusia Ave. FL-472 is the exit from I-4 that provides the nearest access to Orange City.
