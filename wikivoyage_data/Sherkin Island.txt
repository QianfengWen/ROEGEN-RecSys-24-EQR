Sherkin Island or Inisherkin is one of the islands of Roaringwater Bay in County Cork, a short ferry ride from Baltimore in southwest Ireland. Its Irish name Inis Arcáin means "Island of the Piglet", which probably refers to sea-pigs meaning porpoises. The island is 5 km by 2.4 km, indented by two coves, and in 2016 had a population of 111.


Understand[edit]
Sherkin Island tourism information
Get in[edit]
The ferry sails from Baltimore hourly, daily year-round, taking 10 min to cross. The adult return fare is €12, child €4. No bikes or vehicles are carried. 
The island pier is at 51.477-9.41 Harboursmouth. Private boats should moor at the little jetty 100 m north. 
There is no direct ferry between Sherkin Island and Cape Clear Island to the southwest: you'd have to backtrack via Baltimore. Ferries from Cunnamore via Heir Island to Baltimore sometimes call at Sherkin Island.

A minibus meets the ferries and will take you anywhere for €2, but you only need it with luggage and small children. Otherwise walk everywhere.

See[edit]
The Abbey overlooking the ferry pier was a Franciscan Friary established in 1460. Being so remote, it was little affected by the Reformation, and friars remained on the island until 1766. The ruin is free to stroll around anytime.
Dun na Long is an ivy-clad scrap of a medieval fort, nowadays an outbuilding of Sherkin House Hotel.
51.49-9.4081 The Dock is an inlet at the north end of the lane from the ferry pier. Only small craft can get in here.
51.473-9.3952 The Lighthouse at Barrack Point is a stubby tower with a harbour light for boats approaching Baltimore. The inlet just west is called Horseshoe Harbour.
51.466-9.4243 Trá Bán is a sandy beach. The lane continues west to end at Trá Cru but this is a rocky inlet.
51.472-9.424 Cow Strand then Silver Strand are reached along the lane branching north at the church, and continuing to North Shore.
Do[edit]
Take a stroll. It's not the place for rushing round ticking off "sights".
The island rowing regatta is held at the pier in mid-July.
Buy[edit]
Sean the Shop is up the lane west past the Abbey. Hours vary but he's generally around. In summer there's a Sunday market here.
