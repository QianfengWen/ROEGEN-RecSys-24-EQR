Riihimäki is in Tavastia Proper, about 70 km north of Helsinki. An industrial town of about 29,000 inhabitants (2021), Riihimäki is an important railway junction.


Understand[edit]
Riihimäki isn't an old city, even compared with other Finnish cities. The first railway in the country (at the time a Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire) was opened between Helsinki and Hämeenlinna in 1862, and the small station of Riihimäki was built pretty much in the middle of nowhere. A few years later a railway from Lahti and eventually all the way from the imperial capital St. Petersburg was opened, joining the first railway in Riihimäki and thus it became an important railway junction, which it remains today, and a town started to grow around it. In 1960 Riihimäki received city status.
Today Riihimäki is an industrial city, also home to some governmental functions like a garrison and Riihimäki Prison with the highest security level in Finland. The most notable attractions in the city are museums, such as the Glass Museum hosted in the former glass factory of Riihimäen Lasi, and while Riihimäki isn't exactly a prime tourist destination, quite a number of travellers pass through every day.

By train[edit]
60.73527824.7808331 Riihimäki railway station. Riihimäki is on the Finnish main north–south train line between Helsinki and Tampere and further all the way to Northern Finland. Most trains stop here. In addition, there are some trains from Lahti. Commuter train lines R, T and D come in from Helsinki (about every half hour during daytime), R from Tampere, and G from Lahti (about hourly). Coming from Helsinki airport, take train P to Tikkurila and switch to one of the trains from Helsinki.   
By bus[edit]
The railway station doubles as bus station. You can get in by bus from nearby major cities, see Matkahuolto for schedules. As the centre is quite far from the motorway (3 km to the bus station), many of the buses between Helsinki and Tampere don't stop in Riihimäki centre but instead use the highway stop, called Riihimäki liittymä 19.

By car[edit]
Highway 3 (E12) from Helsinki to [[Hämeenlinna], Tampere and Vaasa passes near Riihimäki. E12 continues from Vaasa to Umeå and Norway as the Blue Highway. In the east–west direction there's highway 54 between Lahti and Forssa.
