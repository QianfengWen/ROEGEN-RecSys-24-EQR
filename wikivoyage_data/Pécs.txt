Not to be confused with Peć.

Pécs (PEH-ch)  is a town in the south-west of Hungary. Pécs is the administrative and economic centre of Baranya County. The city has a Mediterranean atmosphere and is treasure trove of science, arts and sacrality. It had famous and glorious periods. Here are several values of the Roman times, the Middle Ages, the Turkish occupation and the development of the middle-class are built on one another or next to one another such as Gothic, Renaissance, baroque dwelling houses, Christian churches and Islamic houses of prayer, mosques and minarets, baths and public buildings. It's also an active university city, with some 20,000 students enrolled at the University of Pécs, approximately 4,000 of whom are international students.


Understand[edit]
Located on the slopes of the Mecsek mountains. The heritage of the past goes back to the neolithic age. The territory always provided good essential conditions for the different ethnic groups who settled down here, which is proven by the archaeological findings excavated here. Founded as Sopianae 2000 years ago by the Romans (most relics date back to the this period) and known as Fünfkirchen by the Germans.
After the period of migration, St. Stephen founded an episcopate in Pécs around 1009.
Pope Urban signed the foundation document of the university during the reign of Lewis the Great, in 1367. Consequently the town of Pécs became the seat of the first university of Hungary.
Today's Pécs is a pleasant small (but still one of the largest in Hungary) university town that has largely escaped the ravages of both communist-era architecture and modern-day mass tourism.
In 2000, the Early Christian Necropolis of Pécs was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. It is one of the European Capitals of Culture in 2010.

Buy[edit]
Zsolnay porcelain: Colourful glazed items produced by the Zsolnay Ceramic Manufacture, often with a distinct Art Nouveau character, are the best known products of Pécs, remarkable for a distinctive green-gold glaze named eosin. Pieces from before the war are also found in antique stores on Király and Ferences Street; of special note from recent designs is the charming jewellery collection by Katalin Zoob.
Villány wines: wines from the Villány wine region, especially full-bodied reds, are counted among the best in Hungary. The region was at the vanguard of reviving traditional winemaking methods and implementing quality standards after 1990, a process encouraged by family vineyards and by strategic investors. Wine producers have also turned towards quality tourism, as well as introducing the “Villány Classicus” and “Villány Premium” labels to designate quality wines reflecting the best of the terroir – the former emphasising the characteristics of the wine region, the latter of specific hills or valleys. In addition to world types (Cabernets, Blaufränkisch, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Blauer Portugieser and Syrah), the less known Kadarka and Zweigelt are also cultivated.
Local crafts and art: A selection of wares produced by local craftspersons and artists can be sampled at “Remekek Háza” on the main square (of special interest are the bookbinders’ wares) and “Belső Kert Galéria” in a small courtyard opening from Király Street for mainly playful pieces. Other art galleries and antique stores are found in the inner city as well. Also notable is Elegáns Divat, a main street store selling quality off-the-rack womenswear based on traditional 19th and early 20th century Hungarian designs.

Budget[edit]
In general, the budget traveler would do well to seek out self-service canteens (of which there are plenty) near his place of accommodation. These offer authentic (though of course not spectacular) dishes at very low prices, and offer a great opportunity to get acquainted with Hungarian cuisine in the company of locals. They tend to be only open for lunch, however, and many close on weekends. They're frequented mostly by workers on lunch break, senior citizens, and students, all of which are looking for cheap but decent meals.

For late night clubbing, try Pécsi Est Cafe, a nightclub quite popular with university students, or ask the taxi drivers at Kossúth tér where to go. They are the most up-to-date source about night life. Bars close around midnight, while clubs are open until around 04:00 or 05:00.
Although beer is not as important culturally as in Germany or in the Czech republic, these days younger generation drinks more beer than wine. Pécs has its local beer Szalon and Pécsi beer.

 Művész Presszó. This alternative culture pub has a good range of Hungarian artisan beer specialities. Although it is a bit on the margin of down town, it is worth trying its fine quality beers which are selected from all over Hungary by its owner.

Stay safe[edit]
Generally, Pécs is rather quiet during the night compared to other European cities, and crime to tourists is limited to pickpocketing or possibly prices, bills and taxi fares cheats.
Downtown is safe to walk, even after midnight. Even though it is forbidden by law, there are some beggars on the streets of downtown. They might be annoying to some, but they do no harm.

Learn[edit]
Pécs is a very active city, partially because of its educational base. The University of Pécs[dead link] offers wide range of programs including Arts, Economics and Business Administration, Health Sciences, Law, Medicine, Music, Pharmacy, Life Sciences and Education. Throughout the year students from all around Hungary and around the world come here to study.
The city also has a wide range of high school programs, most of which are highly specialised in areas such as humanities, sciences and engineering and more.

Stay healthy[edit]
As everywhere in Hungary, tap water is drinkable.
Private health care providers are high quality; dentistry and physiotherapy are cheaper than in Western Europe. Still, though, check the price with the provider before you confirm the appointment. Most doctors have some English or German skills.
Pharmacies are everywhere; however, many cannot maintain an adequate reserve of medicines. Another problem might be communicating with the pharmacist, as most of them speak only Hungarian. Some rusty Latin might come handy quite unexpectedly.

Connect[edit]
Pécs has 4G from all Hungarian carriers. As of Sept 2021, 5G has not reached the city. WiFi is widely available in public places.
