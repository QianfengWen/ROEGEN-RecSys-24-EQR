Concord is a residential and business city in the East Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area in the state of California.


Understand[edit]
Location[edit]
Concord is 29 miles (47 km) east of San Francisco, meaning that the commute through the Caldecott Tunnel and across the Bay Bridge can be done in approximately 30 minutes when traffic is light, but may feel like an eternity when traffic is heavy.  The area of the city is 31.13 square miles (80.63 square kilometers), and with over 120,000 residents Concord is the largest city in Contra Costa County.

History[edit]
Concord is perhaps best-known for the De La Salle High School football team, which between 1992 and 2004 established a national record-winning streak of 151 games, shattering the previous record of 72 games.  During this time the team was named ESPN national champion in 1994 and USA Today national champion in 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003.
Another of Concord's claims to fame is the famous people who grew up in the city. Concord is the birthplace of actor Tom Hanks. Also, Jazz pianist Dave Brubeck is from Concord and one of Concord's several parks is named in his honor.

Climate[edit]
Concord, like most of the East Bay, has hot summers and cool winters. Rain is a rare sight during most months of the year and any rain occurs in monsoon-like periods of fairly heavy rain that last for a few days and then give way to dry weather again. These wet periods often occur in late December or during January and February, but never occur during the summer.
