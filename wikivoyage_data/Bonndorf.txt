Mentioned for the first time in the early 13th century, the town is known for its château (Schloss) which was built in the late 16th century. 
Interesting fact: One of the biggest producers of Black Forest ham is in Bonndorf.

Map of Bonndorf


By train[edit]
There is no train station in Bonndorf anymore so your best choice is to arrive at the Seebrugg oder Neustadt stations via train and to go from there by bus.

By car[edit]
You can reach Bonndorf from Freiburg (56 km, 35 miles away) via Titisee-Neustadt.
The Swiss border is 18 km (11 miles) away.
Schaffhausen and the Rheinfall are approximately 50 km (31 miles) away.
Get around[edit]
On foot[edit]
As there are many Wanderwege that are maintained by the Schwarzwaldverein. Many strangers come here especially for that purpose. A quite famous Wanderweg is that through the Wutach gorge, one entry for example is in Bonndorf's suburb of Boll.

By bicycle[edit]
The Wanderwege mentioned above are mostly rideable by bicyclists as well.

By bus[edit]
The bus system of Südbaden-Bus-Gesellschaft connects many small towns with the major ones although most buses cease operating well before the late evening. The intervals of connection are rarely shorter than one hour.

By car[edit]

Do[edit]
Buy[edit]
Black Forest ham is always a good souvenir (if you're allowed to bring it into your country of origin!). The Adler company located in Bonndorf is quite well-known for their meat products throughout Germany.

Eat[edit]
There are some Gasthäuser in the centre of Bonndorf, most of them are family-run. These Gasthäuser serve good value for money, mainly meat products like Schnitzel, and more traditional products like Wurstsalat (literally sausage salad). Many serve the famous Black Forest cake for dessert as well.

 Kranz, Martinstraße (next to the city hall). 
Many Turkish kebap shops are available as well as pizzerias.

 Di Lisi, Martinstraße. 
If you are interested in paying a bit more and getting well-above-average quality of food

 Germania, Martinstraße (opposite to the primary school). 
 Möhringer's Schwarzwaldhotel, Rothausstraße (only some metres away from the primary school.). 
Drink[edit]
The Rothaus brewery is only some fifteen kilometres away from Bonndorf, so virtually everywhere you go in Bonndorf you will either get the Pils (0.5 litres) and Tannenzäpfle (0.33 litres) bottles or draught Rothaus beer. Especially Tannenzäpfle is becoming known as a cult beer throughout Germany as the label contains a highly cliché depiction of a Black Forest girl.
There are plenty of pubs in Bonndorf that sometimes serve quite acceptable food as well:

 Schnitzer, Paulinerstraße. 
 Sonntag, Schlossstraße. 
 Braukessel, Rothausstraße. serving Fürstenberg beer 
 Humpen, Martinstraße.
