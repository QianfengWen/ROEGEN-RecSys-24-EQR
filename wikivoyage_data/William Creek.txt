William Creek is a very small town in South Australia.


Get in[edit]
If you are in William Creek chances are you are driving the Oodnadatta Track.  It passes straight through the town.  You can also fly in to the town airstrip on an air tour.  There is also a more direct access way to the sealed road through Coober Pedy.  There is no sealed road access into William Creek.

See[edit]
The road into William Creek, with the township in the background. Watch out for airplanes!
See the planes taxi down the main street of the town from the airstrip (and the sign which says to watch out for them).  See the old railway sidings, and walk along the old railway alignment into the outback.
Look at the William Creek pub and town.  It has its own radio station (audible for about 1km from the town) its own generator (turned off at night).  It is a very remote and tiny settlement, and its features are quite remarkable.

Do[edit]
Take a scenic flight over Lake Eyre from the William Creek airstrip.

Buy[edit]
Well, actually try to avoid buying anything here, especially make sure you don't have to fuel up here. Prices are steep and in no way comparable to Oodnadatta or Marree.

Go next[edit]
Lake Eyre is a side trip off the track.  You will need a 4WD, and to take care.  Tourists have died on this trip after becoming stuck.  Otherwise continue on north to Oodnadatta south to Marree.
