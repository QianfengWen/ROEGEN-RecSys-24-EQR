Anaconda is a city in southwestern Montana.  In the 2020 census, the population was 9,400. It is located in a valley of the Deer Lodge National Forest, giving impressive views and plenty of nearby outdoor activities.


Understand[edit]
Anaconda was founded by Marcus Daly, one of the Copper Kings. He constructed a smelter on nearby Warm Springs Creek to process copper ore from the Butte mines. The work drew immigrants from a variety of countries. This made Anaconda one of the more diverse towns in early Montana.
