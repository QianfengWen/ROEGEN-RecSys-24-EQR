Delmenhorst is a city in Lower Saxony, Germany with almost 75,000 citizens. It is first cited in a document from 1247. In the late 19th century, Delmenhorst became an industrial city among other factories with the city's biggest factory, Nordwolle. In the present days a traveller can find a lot of exhibits of the history in the now-modern city.


Understand[edit]
The townhall and the water tower
Due to its long history, the style of buildings vary in the city's centre. Around the turn of the century, the city planners wanted to create an 'ideal city' with new building styles. Many buildings at the city's main shopping street, Lange Straße, look very different yet interesting.

53°2′59″N 8°37′53″EMap of Delmenhorst
On foot[edit]
In the center everything is really close together.

By bike[edit]
Riding a bike is one of the preferred means of transport. Bike paths are in excellent condition and usually exist next to every street and pavement. There are routes available for day trips in and around Delmenhorst. See the Do section of this article.

Bike rental[edit]
 Kehlenbeck, Oldenburger Str. 161, ☏ +49 4221  17704. Located on a major street, this small store offers some bikes to rent. 
By bus[edit]
Buses are widely available. The company for the buses is called Delbus ([1], German). The central bus station (ZOB – Zentraler Omnibusbahnhof) is located next to the central train station. Normally every bus stop has its own map of the bus system. There is one schedule for the weekday ("Tag", every 15 minutes) and another one for evenings and weekends ("Freizeit", every 30 minutes).
The pricing system is connected to the over-regional VBN (Verkehrsverbund Bremen-Niedersachsen, Travel Association Bremen-Lower Saxony). Prices may have changed, so look here for more information ([2][dead link], English). Adult starts at €1.60, depending on the zones you travel through. Feel free to ask, but don't expect everyone to speak English.

By taxi[edit]
This is the most expensive but also the most flexible alternative. If you want to get back to your place, just ask the bar or restaurant you are in to call a taxi for you. In downtown there are stations for taxis at the central station. Tipping the driver (10% of the fare) is a nice gesture.

Talk[edit]
German obviously is the first language. However there are quite a lot of people who can also speak some English.  You might want to try to speak a little slower, as it might increase your chance to be understood ;). Especially young people speak English. So, if you have a problem, there will probably always be someone who can help you out by translating. Also you might have the chance to speak Turkish at some places, like the numerous kebap shops.
