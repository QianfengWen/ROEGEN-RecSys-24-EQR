Understand[edit]
Carbonear overlooks the west side of Conception Bay and had a history long tied to fishing and shipbuilding.  

History[edit]
St James Anglican Church
Carbonear is one of the oldest permanent settlements in Newfoundland and among the oldest European settlements in North America. The harbour appears on early Portuguese maps as early as the late 1500s as Cabo Carvoeiro (later anglicized as Cape Carviero). There are a number of different theories about the origin of the town's name. Possibly from the Spanish word "carbonera" (charcoal kiln); Carbonera, a town near Venice, Italy where John Cabot (Giovanni Caboto) had been resident; or from a number of French words, most likely "Carbonnier" or "Charbonnier," meaning "coalman".
The British began permanent colonization of the island in the early 17th century. Legend tells of an Irish princess of the O'Conner family, Sheila NaGeira, who settled in Carbonear after being rescued by privateer Peter Easton and marrying his first officer Gilbert Pike. Much is known about Easton and his exploits, but evidence of NaGeira has yet to be found. The legend's combination of romance, pirates, and New World adventure has inspired much research and numerous works of fiction on the topic.
Carbonear became a target for England's enemies, and privateers. When war broke out with France, Carbonear was attacked by the French. The citizens survived by retreating to Carbonear Island, which they fortified. The town, documented by the French as containing properties that were "the best-built in all of Newfoundland", was burned to the ground. By the end of March 1697, only Bonavista and Carbonear Island remained in English hands.
Over the next hundred years, Carbonear was attacked and burned twice more by the French in their attempts to control Newfoundland, and then later by American privateers. The town developed as one of the most important in Newfoundland in this period.  With new French threats, the British finally erected a fort and garrison on the island in 1743. During the Seven Years' War, the French invaded and gained control of the fort, burning its buildings and tossing the cannons over the cliffs in 1762. They can still be seen on the beach below.
With the rise of the seal hunt and the Labrador cod fishery, Carbonear became a major commercial centre in the 19th century. Violent political riots here in the early and mid-19th century led to the dissolution of the Newfoundland Legislature in 1841 and the suspension of the constitution. Political riots were so common here during this period that the term "Carbonearism" was coined to describe the behaviour. 
In the late 20th century, the economy was forced to diversify. The seal hunt and the Labrador fishery had almost disappeared. Carbonear's importance as a shipbuilding centre and international port of trade had much declined. Fish processing continued to be the primary industry until the collapse of the cod fishery in the early 1990s. To counter these changes, Carbonear is evolving. With two college campuses, a shopping centre, a major hospital, and three long-term care facilities, the town has built on its importance as a regional retail, service, transportation, government, and cultural centre, earning it the nickname "Hub of the Bay".
