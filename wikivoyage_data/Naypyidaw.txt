Naypyidaw, also spelled Nay Pyi Taw, officially replaced Yangon as the capital of Myanmar in 2005. It is officially known by the acronym NPT.


Understand[edit]
Naypyidaw is unique and a little bizarre. It's a large and fully laid out city but with insufficient inhabitants and buildings for its size, so you can experience the unprecedented Asian scenario of never getting stuck in traffic. Whether this weird situation will remain when Myanmar's economy begins to boom is another matter since the lack of gridlock is certainly not down to superb road planning and cutting edge traffic control. What helps are the eight-lane boulevards and Parisian-sized roundabouts.
Naypyidaw was a rather secretive construction project by the ruling military junta in the early 2000s and, in November 2005, was suddenly proclaimed Myanmar's new capital. Government workers were given two months notice that they would have to move from Yangon with the re-location of all government offices and ministries. Most embassies and international organisations, like the UN, have not relocated since educational and health infrastructure is not yet in place.

Get in[edit]
0°0′0″N 0°0′0″EMap of Naypyidaw
By car[edit]
The tolled Yangon–Mandalay Expressway connects Yangon to NPT. It's 320 km (200 mi) long with a service complex containing a fuel station and a large, expensive (by local standards) restaurant just past the halfway point if you're coming from Yangon.

By rail[edit]
There are several trains daily from Yangon and they take around nine hours. The station is considerably further from the city centre and from the hotels than the bus station, and the bus journey from Yangon is considerably faster (5 hr).

By plane[edit]
To handle increased traffic to the capital, the existing airport at Ela was upgraded to handle larger planes. It lies 16 km (10 mi) southeast of Kyatpyae.

19.61913196.1999392 Naypyidaw International Airport (NYT  IATA). Is now listed as a destination for all domestic airlines: Myanma(r) National Airways, Yangon Airways and KBZ Air. Internal flights are relatively cheap by international standards, typically NYT to RGN IATA would cost around US$120. The usual planes are ATR turboprops. Myanmar National Airways have new ATR aircraft.   
Bangkok Airways flies directly from Bangkok each evening enabling connections to/from major international cities. The plane from Bangkok is an ATR turbo prop, not usually a jet, so it can get rather full and bags can get delayed. Bangkok Airways code shares with other airlines, like Emirates. However, Bangkok Airways does not always honour Emirates frequent flyer benefits (such as extra luggage allowances).
In reality, mainly foreign visitors (usually international development workers) or rich locals fly to Naypyidaw while locals travel by bus (5 hr).
The airport is modern, clean and efficient. It's also mostly empty of people with most of the gates not in use.

By bus[edit]
A bus on a wide road.
From Yangon buses travel the wide new toll highway for about five hours, including mandatory rest stop, to the capital, which unusually just springs out of nowhere at a nondescript intersection. The bus should eventually arrive at the Myoma Bus Station in the north of the city.

From Yangon - 6300 kyat,  5 hr (Feb 2017)
From Bago - 8,000 kyat, 8 hr
Get around[edit]
By motorbike taxi[edit]
This is a common form of transport in Naypyidaw, but it can be risky.

By tuk-tuk[edit]
Similar to those in Bangkok although called a "thaw lar gyi" in Myanmar.

By taxi[edit]
Taxi drivers hang around the shopping centres and bus station and you need to negotiate with them. For foreigners the asking costs can be high at US$5 for even relatively short journeys. Distances between locations are large so finding a taxi needs some effort (best to ask the hotel to help).
An example fare from Feb 2017: 7000 kyat for a 20-minute journey from the Golden Lake Hotel to the Myoma Bus Station. Arranged in advance at the hotel.

See[edit]
19.8991596.2558091 Defence Services Museum, Zeyathiri Township. An enormous half open-air, half housed complex celebrating the country's military. For a country with so many pressing needs you may find this multi-million dollar vanity project hard to stomach, but it's free, and anyone interested in military hardware and history will easily be occupied for some hours. It's a very long walk to see everything. If possible, hire a scooter from your hotel, register at the office 300 m beyond the entrance gates (bring passport) and then park at each of the three main buildings. Otherwise, brace for a walk of several kilometres, at least most of which are under covered walkways. It's wheelchair-friendly, for paralympians. Looking from the main road, the area on the left is Navy, straight ahead is Army and History, to the right is Air Force. There are few signposts in English. The Air Force has planes outside including a moth-eaten Spitifire. The Navy has scale models of ships outside. The three main buildings serve to eulogize the top brass and national heroes. The buildings behind/beside contain the detail, including military kit, 3D dioramas of varying quality, and engaging battle paintings. Most commentary is in Burmese but the key material is also in English. Free. (updated Feb 2017)

Naypyitaw Myoma Market is the commercial centre of Naypyidaw. Other shopping areas include Thapye Chaung Market and Junction Centre Naypyidaw. In the "hotel zone" are two medium-sized shopping malls: Junction and Capital, each of which have reasonable supermarkets and restaurants. Junction also has a cinema. There's another shopping mall complex further north with a much larger supermarket and an exchange bureau. You can change money (only US dollars, not euros) at the travel agent in the Junction Centre but they sometimes run out of cash. Phone charge scratchcards are available in the Junction Centre. Foreign credit or debit cards are sometimes accepted in shops, however there are plenty of ATMs.
