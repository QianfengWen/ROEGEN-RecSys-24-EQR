Following the explosion many of the enlisted men refused to work, resulting in the Navy's largest mutiny trial and eventually helping to push the US Armed Forces to desegregate. The memorial is located on an active military base and as a result reservations must be made at least two weeks in advance and all visitors must be US citizens or permanent residents. Reservations can be made by calling or via an online reservation form. The memorial is actually located in Concord, but all visitors are shuttled to the memorial from John Muir National Historic Site in Martinez.   (updated Feb 2015)

The hills behind John Muir's orchards, where the family used to take nature walks, are open for hiking. Two peaks were named after Muir's daughters, Wanda and Helen; Mount Wanda is the main one at 650 feet (200 meters). The fastest trail to the peak is almost all uphill with little tree cover, but the hard work is rewarded with lovely views of wild rolling hills, Benicia across the water, and Mount Diablo in the distance. A side route called the "nature trail" has more trees and variety in the landscape. Expect about 40 minutes to get to the peak if you're a strong hiker. The hills are managed by the National Park Service together with the John Muir historic site and make a fitting addition to a visit to the naturalist's house and orchards. You can reach the trailhead almost directly from the orchards: exit the historic site to the west, then turn left. Free. (updated Nov 2023)

Events[edit]
 Martinez Beaver Festival: held annually in June.  In the fall of 2006, two beavers made their way up Alhambra Creek in downtown Martinez and decided to call it home, proceeding to produce 4 kits over the course of the summer. The beaver have transformed Alhambra Creek from a trickle into multiple dams and beaver ponds, which in turn, led to the return of steelhead trout and river otter in 2008, and mink in 2009. Rumor has it the beavers have since moved away, but their legacy remains in the form of Martinez's annual beaver festival.
