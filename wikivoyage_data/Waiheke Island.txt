Waiheke Island is in the Hauraki Gulf near Auckland, just off the North Island of New Zealand. It is 35 minutes by ferry from Auckland and is a popular destination for day trips and longer visits.


Understand[edit]
Waiheke Island is the third most populous island of New Zealand (after the North and South Islands), with 9,800 permanent residents (2021), 2,000 of whom commute to Auckland each work day. Another estimated 3,400 have second homes or holiday homes on the island. In summer the population swells dramatically, as the island is a popular destination for both overseas travellers and New Zealanders. 
The microclimate is well suited for winemaking and the island has over two dozen vineyards. Olives are well established and some extremely nice olive oils are produced. Waiheke is administered by the Auckland Council.
