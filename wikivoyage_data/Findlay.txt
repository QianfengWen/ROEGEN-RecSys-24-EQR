Findlay is a city of 41,000 people (2018) in Northwest Ohio. This former oil and gas town is the seat of Hancock County, and home to the University of Findlay. The city has a distinct mix of amenities aimed at the working class and  academics, almost universally housed in historic architecture.

History[edit]
A boom era map of Findlay
Findlay made glass at The Met in New York City
Findlay started as an American military outpost during the War of 1812. After the war Findlay began growing into a town, and was a stop on the Underground Railroad. Findlay became a booming city on its ties to the natural gas boom in the late 1880s. During this time Findlay became a manufacturing hub for glass and other energy intensive manufacturing. Late in the boom, Tell Tailor wrote the song Down By the Old Mill Stream while in Findlay, which became a barbershop quartet hit. While heavy industry and the gas itself went up in smoke, the legacy of the boom is felt in the institutions and architecture it left behind. Findlay Ohio has a large number of Victorian era buildings, and most of its public buildings and prominent institutions hail from that era as well. Now Findlay is a city with a few industries that survived, bolstered by its cultural amenities and educational assets to provide services to nearby rural communities.

Culture[edit]
Because of its location in Ohio, Findlay has strong agricultural and equestrian traditions, especially among those living on the outskirts of the city. Even today the Sheriff has a horse mounted posse, and the University of Findlay operates an equestrian program that has separate farms for western riding and English riding styles. While it's uncommon to see horse drawn carriages on the road as in Amish country, it's fairly common as a leisure activity, and competitions can be a big deal at the county fair. In the summer locals frequent country produce stands and the farmers market for fresh goods.
Downtown is more cosmopolitan. Artists tend to live or set up studios in the Jones block and other lofts. Socializing over food and drink is big, and it can be difficult to find a place to sit in popular downtown restaurants during the lunch rush despite Findlay's relatively small size.
The American flag is widely flown in Findlay from commercial buildings to private homes due to efforts from John B. Cooke, who purchased thousands of flags for people to fly in Findlay. Eventually, Findlay became known as Flag City USA.

Biking in Findlay is possible, if a bit treacherous. Motorists in Findlay don't like to share the road, so ride defensively.

On foot[edit]
Downtown Findlay and the University of Findlay campus are both very walkable, and have shady sidewalks with ample crossings. The outskirts can be hit or miss - You might be walking on a nice sidewalk, the shoulder of the road, or in a ditch. Going from one side of the city to another can take hours, but is doable.
