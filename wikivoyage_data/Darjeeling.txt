Darjeeling (Nepali: दार्जिलिङ Dārjiliṅ, Bengali: দার্জিলিং Dārjiliṁ) is a hill station in the northern region of West Bengal. It used to be a lovely Victorian town built among the Himalayan foothills, the remnants of which are still visible around the Chowrasta. Darjeeling remains a popular summer and fall resort for the natives of Kolkata today. The main attractions are the cultural diversity of the Tibetan and Nepali populations. The town is also a jumping off point for travelers heading to Sikkim.


Understand[edit]
Tea gardens of Darjeeling

Darjeeling (DAHR-jih-lihng) used to be a cluster of villages that was administered intermittently by Nepal and Sikkim. It grew in prominence during the mid-19th century when, because of its climate, the British established a hill station there.
Later it was discovered that the area was particularly well suited for tea plantations and Darjeeling tea is still exported worldwide. In 1849, the British annexed the area and Darjeeling became a part of British India. The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway was opened in 1881 (it is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site) and the town became famous during the days when the Raj was governed from Calcutta, the present-day Kolkata.
Many Tibetan refugees moved here after Tibet was annexed by China. They co-exist with the descendants of the many Nepalese who once came to the land as soldiers of Prithvi Narayan Shah and settled down there to work as labourers in the tea plantations.
There has been intermittent political action from Gorkha groups demanding an independent state (Gorkhaland). In June 2008 a strike paralyzed the area, with closed hotels, restaurants and shops, and the accompanying protests even turned violent a couple of times. Though inconvenient, tourists generally are not at risk, but you should check the status before going there.

Talk[edit]
Nepali is the main language spoken in Darjeeling. However, as it is in the state of West Bengal, Bengali is the state official language that is used in state government offices. In addition, most well-educated locals will also be able to speak Hindi and English.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The nearest international airport is Bagdogra (IXB IATA) in Siliguri, 96 km from Darjeeling. There are flights from Bangkok, Paro and to most major cities in India.

By taxi or shared terrain vehicle[edit]
Siliguri is the nearest city on the mainline rail network. Ample transport is available to Darjeeling from here, a 3-hour drive on a well-maintained, hilly paved road. The most popular modes of transport are taxi (usually shared by three to four passengers), shared terrain vehicle (ten passengers), ₹150-200 depending on time.
Shared terrain vehicles depart regularly from several locations around town. They leave when full, and are a cheap, fast and reasonably comfortable way to reach Darjeeling.
After arrival by train at New Jalpaiguri (NJP) in Siliguri, taxis (₹1500-3000) and shared terrain vehicles continue the trip to Darjeeling. There is a booking counter at the taxi stand in front of the railway station. There is a prepaid taxi stand in front of the train station. After the last terrain vehicle has left to make a return journey from Darjeeling, the price rises to ₹200 per person. The prepaid counter will state that no terrain vehicles are available, but they can be arranged by fixers or by negotiating directly with drivers.
Tourists often opt to buy an extra seat or two to have more space for the three-hour journey up to Darjeeling. Luggage is carried for free on the roof (try to hire a taxi, terrain vehicle, or SUV with overhead carrier). Terrain vehicles may stop for a snack and toilet break on the way up (normally a few kilometres short of Kurseong).

By bus[edit]
There are buses from Siliguri to Darjeeling, but they are slow due to the steep, twisted, narrow climb to Darjeeling. The option of shared terrain vehicles is available and it is cheap and faster. But terrain vehicles wait for a full load of passengers before departing.
If the bus price is ₹113 to Darjeeling from New Jalpaiguri, consider hiring a taxi, Terrain vehicle or SUV with overhead carrier. This will be cheaper if the vehicle goes directly from New Jalpaiguri to Darjeeling.
There are also bus services from Nepal, see India#Nepal.

By train[edit]
Toy Train of Darjeeling
New Jalpaiguri (NJP) in Siliguri is the nearest station on the main inter-city line. Direct trains to NJP run from Delhi (approx. 27 hours) several times daily. From Kolkata's (Sealdah railway station), the best train is the Darjeeling Mail (circa 12 hours) running nightly at 10:05PM. There is also a train from Howrah Station called Paharia Express, departing from Howrah Station at 9:55PM and arriving at New Jalpaiguri at 8:45AM.
From NJP, the famous Darjeeling Himalayan Railway (DHR), known as the 'Toy Train', completes the journey to Darjeeling. The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway was the first, and still the most outstanding, example of a hill passenger railway. It is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This route is popular with tourists as it passes through picturesque mountain scenery and has been the subject of many articles. The line has a series of zigzags and loops to gain height and even runs straight up several village main streets!
Seats on the DHR Toy Train sell out in peak season, so make reservations up to one month in advance. The train departs New Jalpaiguri at 9AM and arrives in Darjeeling at 3:30PJ, but only on certain days of the week. The train is diesel-hauled now and is reliable and punctual.
The steam 'Joy' train operates from Darjeeling to Ghum via the Batasia Loop, four times a day – enquire at Darjeeling station.  Steam trains cost ₹2200 and diesel trains cost ₹1200. See the DHR website[dead link].
A steam train also operates between Siliguri and 'Agony Point' above Tindharia most Saturdays and Sundays. Enquire at Siliguri station.
There is also a daily 'School Train' departing Kurseong at 6:15AM and arriving at Darjeeling at 8:45AM. It leaves Darjeeling at 4PM and arrives at Kurseong at 6:30PM. This is still hauled by a steam engine and is one of the world's last 'day to day' steam trains. Its schedule is frequently changed and it often runs hours late.

Get around[edit]
27°1′48″N 88°15′36″EMap of Darjeeling
Darjeeling is a small town and the salubrious climate means walks around town are an extremely enjoyable means of getting around. For longer trips, taxis are available in stands near the entrance to the Supermarket.
A great way to spend a day is to take a share-terrain vehicle to Ghum, visit some monasteries there and walk back via some of the villages.
One can also walk to the botanical garden and spend a few pleasant hours appreciating nature, then there is a rock garden, which is very much at a (slightly longish) walkable distance. One can also walk to the zoo and then to the ropeway at North Point. A walk to the Peace Pagoda and then to Jalapahar is also quite refreshing. Have a leisurely walk on the Mall road and  relax for hours in the soothing sun at Chowrasta.

Bookings for guides, porters and accommodation on the trail can be made in Darjeeling or in the nearby town of Manebhanjang, which serves as the trailhead.

Darjeeling Mall
Darjeeling has a large number of hotels and lodges. However, on the whole, budget accommodation is of poor value compared to elsewhere in India. Most places target groups coming in from West Bengal; backpacker-oriented accommodation is sparse and you probably won't get touts coming to pick you up at the bus stop so it pays to have a few ideas in advance.
There are several forest guesthouses in the Darjeeling area. In order to stay at any of these a special permit from West Bengal Forest Department is required.

Stay safe[edit]
There has been a surge of tourists visiting Darjeeling in the last few years. Earlier, there was continuous turmoil and political disturbance in the hills. But since the establishment of the new government in 2011, the political stability has been restored and life came back to normal.
But extreme suffering and poor state of business, development, jobs and infrastructure has created deep scars, which may take some more time to heal. So a note of caution is given while travelling around the city.
Take caution when walking at night, as many feral dogs roam the street once the sun goes down. If approached by an aggressive dog in the street, acting as though you are picking up a rock to throw will usually deter them.
