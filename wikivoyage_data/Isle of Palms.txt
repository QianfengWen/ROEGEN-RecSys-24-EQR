A red sun rises over the Isle of Palms
Isle of Palms is a city of 4,347 (2020) in South Carolina, near Charleston.  Over the years Isle of Palms has become a very popular vacation spot for families. Warm weather, an abundance of palm trees, and beautiful beaches make Isle of Palms the perfect location for any traveler.


Get in[edit]
Public transportation options have been discontinued in 2013. A taxi from the center of Charleston should cost around $22.

Get around[edit]
The main thoroughfare through IOP is Palm Blvd, which stretches from the island's southernmost border to just past 57th Ave. to the North. The island is perfect for biking and walking, not to mention the fact that the entire island is accessible by golf cart.
Be sure to use caution while driving on Isle of Palms.  The local police force is snide and unfriendly, often acting militaristic in their enforcement of public safety and road regulations. A parked vehicle left hanging half an inch past the line will likely net you a parking violation ticket.

See[edit]
Isle of Palms is big on water sports and beaches, but short on attractions. If you insist on seeing anything other than sand, the  huge number of turtles which nest here during the summer is a unique attraction to the island. They are all carefully monitored and recorded by the community's Turtle Team. While casual visitors will probably have more luck hitting the jackpot than seeing one hatch, there is a good chance of spotting turtles while hanging on the beach (Jul-Aug?). Neighboring Sullivan's Island's Fort Moultrie is your best bet if that's not enough culture for you.

Do[edit]
Lonely kayaks longing for the summer to arrive
 Front Beach, Ocean Avenue (10th-14th Ave). Is a very scenic beach that stretches on for miles and miles. Enjoy taking a walk, relaxing on the sand, going for a swim and collecting sand dollars. Fun for everyone, but leave the glass bottles and alcohol at home, or the beach guards will spoil it. 
 Isle of Palms Marina, 50 41st Avenue, ☏ +1 843 886-0209. Fishing charters and boat rentals available. Boat rentals can be hourly or day rentals. Prices range from $65-$475, depending on how long you have the boat, size of the boat, and number of people on the boat. Prices for fishing charters also vary depending on the size. 
 Isle Of Palms Recreation Center, 27th to 29th Avenue, ☏ +1 843 886-8294. M-F 8AM-5PM. The recreation center offers tennis courts, baseball and soccer field, basketball courts, children's playground, and gym. Something for everyone. It's within walking distance of the vacation homes and beach.

Buy[edit]

 Harris Teeter, 1513 Palm Blvd., ☏ +1 843-886-6506. Very convenient grocery store. Extremely short distance from vacation homes and the beach. Located right off the highway, so it's easy to find. They have everything you need and the workers are really nice. 
Eat[edit]
 Acme Cantina, 31 J C Long Blvd, Isle of Palms, SC, 29451, ☏ +1 843-405-9887. 8am-. An inexpensive but tasty restaurant that has a mild Mexican vibe.  Burritos, tacos, chimichangas, and quesadillas are always popular orders, but don't shy away from their seafood specials.  Be warned, The Acme's extremely busy on weekends for breakfast, so plan ahead.  At night, the bar's popular with local regulars and F&B crowd, and flooded with tourists during the high season.  Voted best crabcake on the island in 2008. 
 The Boathouse, 101 Palm Boulevard, ☏ +1 843-886-8000. Once hailed as IOP's best restaurant, the quality and service has suffered over the last few years, leaving The Boathouse existing as nothing more than an overpriced tourist trap with an excellent view of the inter-coastal waterway. $$$$. 
32.785011-79.7891071 Coconut Joe's, 1120 Ocean Blvd, ☏ +1 843 886-0046. hard to find because it sits back from the street. 
 Sea Biscuit Cafe, 21 J C Long Blvd, ☏ +1 843 886-4079. Popular breakfast place. The place is quaint and while the lines are long, the food is delicious.  Be sure to try the Crab Cakes Benedict or Caprese Omelet. 
Drink[edit]

Sleep[edit]
 Exclusive Properties, 1116 Palm Blvd, ☏ +1 843 886-4753. This vacation rental provider offers luxury vacation homes on the beach. Properties offer as many as 11 rooms. (updated Mar 2017)
 The Palms Hotel, 1126 Ocean Blvd, ☏ +1 843 886-3003. While hardly luxurious by any standards, this hotel has access to the beach right outside the front door, and a pool if you don't fancy salt.
