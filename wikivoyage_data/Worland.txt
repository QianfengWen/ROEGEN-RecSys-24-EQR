Understand[edit]
Worland is a hub for business in the Big Horn Basin. The economy of Worland is supported by agriculture and oil/gas drilling. Sugar beets are the top agricultural product of the area. Top employers in Worland include Admiral Beverage, Wyoming Sugar Company, Crown Cork & Seal, and MillerCoors.

History[edit]
Charles H. "Dad" Worland in 1900 dug his underground stage stop here on the old Bridger Trail. From Dad's dugout grew the City of Worland. Early settlers dreamed that the Big Horn River would create a new way of life in the desert. In 1903, a party of surveyors made their way into the Big Horn Basin area to determine the feasibility of a large irrigation project. At that time, the current site of Worland had a population of fewer than 100 people.
By 1904, the project was in full swing and Camp Worland evolved into a community with a school, church, post office, and general store.
