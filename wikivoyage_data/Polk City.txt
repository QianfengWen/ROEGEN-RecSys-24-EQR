Fantasy of Flight.
Polk City is a small town in Polk County, Florida. It is home to Fantasy of Flight and located on the southern edge of the Green Swamp.


Understand[edit]
The town has just 2,700 people (2020) and 0.8 mi2 (2 km2) of land. Despite the tiny size, Polk City refers to most of the north-central part of the county. This area is part of the Green Swamp, which is the origin of most of west-central Florida's rivers, including the Peace, Hillsborough, Withlacoochee, & Ocklawaha Rivers. The town, just like the county, is named for James Polk, the 11th president of the United States.

Climate[edit]








Check the weather forecast for Polk City at NOAA.



Polk City's climate is much the same as the rest of Central Florida (except coasts). Winters are mild, with highs in the 70s (21-27°C) and lows in the 50s (10-15°C). Lows in the 30s (0-5°C) are common after cold fronts and there are usually a handful of lows below freezing each winter, although that requires clear skies, so it usually warms very rapidly after sunrise (30°F at 6AM, 55°F by noon is typical). Cold fronts occasionally pass by as squall lines, so tornadoes in December or January are not unusual. Snow is rare; the last measurable snowfall was in 1977, although sleet/wintry mix fell in an unusually cold January 2010. Summers are hot and humid, with highs around 90-95°F (33-35°C) and lows around 74-78°F (23-26°C). During the summer, onshore winds from both coasts travel inland, heat up, rise and build into thunderstorms, usually along a rough line. Lying in the center of the state, the line of storms (each called a "seabreeze") often collide and become severe, with tornadoes (small EF0-1s, not like the powerful tornadoes in the Plains states), 50+ mph winds, and hail possible. Strong storms are usually preceded by cooler winds caused by the rain-cooled air (cold air sinks) rapidly flowing away from the storm. The temperature after a strong thunderstorm passes can drop from 95°F (35°C) to 75°F (24°C) and since the storms can be fairly small, you can drive 5 miles and the temperature will drop/rise 20°F (10°C) between rain-cooled and surrounding areas.

Polk City is located just off of Interstate 4, roughly half-way between Tampa and Orlando. Two state roads run through town. State Road 33 runs southwest to Lakeland, intersecting twice with I-4—Exit 38 is closest to town, while Exit 33 is in North Lakeland. S.R. 33 continues north, through the Green Swamp, to Lake County, where it ends at U.S. 27 near Florida's Turnpike. S.R. 559 runs south from the center of town, past Fantasy of Flight, where it intersects with I-4 (Exit 44), and continues south to Auburndale. County Road 557A travels southeast to a junction with C.R. 557, which leads south to Lake Alfred.

Occasionally during the winter, there are mornings where dense fog forms in the Green Swamp. If there is any smoke from small wildfires or controlled burns, the smoke will mix with the fog to form a very dense fog, where visibility drops from clear to less than 5 ft (2 m) in less than a half mile! Such a super-fog resulted in an 70-car pileup on Interstate 4 in 2008, which killed 4 people and closed this major highway for over 36 hours. Electronic message boards have been installed every few miles along I-4 through the Green Swamp and can alert drivers to fog.
