Not to be confused with Drenthse Veenkoloniën (Koloniën van Weldadigheid), a region and World Heritage site in Drenthe.

The (Groninger) Veenkoloniën (Dutch for Peat Colonies (of Groningen city)) or Peat District is a region in the southeast of the province of Groningen, the Netherlands. The region used to be uncultivated land, but starting in the 16th and 17th centuries the city of Groningen started to colonise more and more of the area for the extraction of peat, to be used as fuel. The earliest 'peat colonies' were near to the city, such as Hoogezand and Sappemeer in Midden-Groningen. Later, also the bogs further away from the city, to the southeast, were exploited. This is seen as the heart of the Veenkoloniën region, and includes the municipalities of Veendam, Pekela, and Stadskanaal. Talks are ongoing on a possible merger of these municipalities.
Stadskanaal is sometimes also considered to be part of the region of Westerwolde to the east.


Understand[edit]
Linear village Wildervank, a 17th-century peat colony along the Oosterdiep canal, just south of Veendam.
The Bourtanger Moor formed a bog in the provinces of Groningen and Drenthe, and the neighbouring German Western Plains region. This area was largely uninhabitable, until large-scale peat expoitation started in the 16th century. Throughout the centuries, numerous canals were dug, for drainage of the peat and transport to Groningen city. Along many of these canals, linear settlements were established. The landscape of the Veenkoloniën is therefore characterised by long, straight canals with linear settlements, and vast agricultural areas in between. The largest towns in the region by far are Veendam (population 27,500) and Stadskanaal (20,000). Especially in Stadskanaal the initial linear settlement along the canal is still clearly visible, and the town is also named after this canal (Stadskanaal means City's Canal, with 'city' referring to the city of Groningen).
A similar landscape formed by the peatlands and its exploitation can be found just across the provincial border in Drenthe, in the municipalities of Aa en Hunze and Borger-Odoorn.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The main road traversing the Veenkoloniën is the north-south N33 expressway. Towards the southwest, the N33 leads to Assen and the A28 motorway interchange (15 minutes). Towards the north, the N33 leads to the A7 motorway interchange at Zuidbroek (5 minutes). From the city of Groningen, take the A7 eastbound, and then the N33 southbound to the Veenkoloniën (20 minutes to Veendam, 30 minutes to Stadskanaal). Other roads into the region include the trunk roads N365 from Bourtange, N366 from Ter Apel and Southeast Drenthe, and N367 from Winschoten.

By train[edit]
There is one railway station in the Veenkoloniën, being 53.103226.884583 Veendam railway station.There is a twice-hourly train connection to and from Groningen city, operated by Arriva, with Veendam being the terminus of the line. From Groningen, the trip takes 30 minutes (€6.10). For trips from most other destinations in the Netherlands, a transfer in Groningen's main station is required. To travel to Veendam from destinations in the east of Groningen province (e.g. Winschoten), transfer in Zuidbroek.

By bus[edit]
In addition to the railway to Veendam, there are several bus routes that are useful to get to the Veenkoloniën, from the main railway and bus station in Groningen city, as well as other destinations in Gronnigen and Drenthe provinces. In addition to Veendam's railway and bus station, the key bus station in the region is 52.986656.953924 Stadskanaal bus station. All buses are operated by Qbuzz.

From Groningen: bus routes 73 (1-2x/hour via Hoogezand to Stadskanaal) and 312 (1-6x/hour during daytime weekdays to Stadskanaal)
From Assen via Aa en Hunze: bus routes 24 (1x/hour to Stadskanaal) and 110 (1x/hour to Veendam)
From Emmen: bus routes 28 (1x/hour to Musselkanaal and Stadskanaal) and 73 (1-2x/hour to Stadskanaal)
From Winschoten : bus routes 13 (1x/hour during daytime Mondays to Saturdays to Veendam), 14 (1-2x/hour to Stadskanaal), 75 (1x/hour during daytime weekdays to Oude Pekela, Nieuwe Pekela, and Stadskanaal) and 110 (1x/hour to Oude Pekela, Nieuwe Pekela, and Veendam)
Get around[edit]

The fastest way to get around in the Veenkoloniën is by car. There is an extensive road network connecting the towns and villages. However, the best way to get around is arguably by bicycle. The main towns and villages are clearly signposted with dedicated signposts for cyclists, and in many cases separate cycle paths are available.
The bus routes as mentioned above are useful to get around within the region, notably line 28 to get from Stadskanaal to Musselkanaal, line 75 to get from Stadskanaal to Nieuwe Pekela and Oude Pekela, and line 110 to get from Veendam to Nieuwe Pekela and Oude Pekela. In addition, there is the so-called 'small-scale public transportation network', connecting several of the villages in the region with minibuses and also including minibus route 510 which serves as a city bus in Veendam and Wildervank (1x/hour during daytime Mondays-Saturdays). Oddly, there is no direct bus connection between the two largest towns, Veendam and Stadskanaal. Instead, a transfer is required in Nieuwe Pekela.
The railway is only used as heritage railway, with a few runs per week in summer, and a few runs per month in winter (see below under 'Do'). There are plans to resume the passenger rail service from Veendam to Stadskanaal, which was cancelled in 1953, but it will not be operational before 2019 at the earliest.
