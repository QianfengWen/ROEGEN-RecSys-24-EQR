LaBelle is a city in the Florida Heartland. It is the county seat for Hendry County.


Understand[edit]
The Sears Building
Settlers moved into LaBelle due to its location on the Caloosahatchee River and cattle drovers and trappers made up its population. A school was built in 1891, and was rebuilt in 1915, becoming an accredited school. It is now the site of the Edward A. Upthegrove Elementary School. When a Baptist church was formed in addition to the already existing Methodist church, the river became used for mass baptisms.
During the 1920s LaBelle was made the capital of Hendry County and despite its small size it was assigned "city" status. For eight years the city was split between Hendry County and Glades County, with the part in Glades being called "North LaBelle," but the residents of North LaBelle voted to return to the original county and the two cities were merged.
From the 1950s onward, the "city" grew relatively rapidly, from under 1,000 in 1950 to over 2,000 in 1980. A spell of growth during the 1990s brought the city's population above 4,000, and by 2020 the city had reached a population of 5,000.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
FL-80 goes from the west to the city from Fort Myers, following the southern bank of the Caloosahatchee River. To the east it loosely follows the boundary with Glades County to the junction with US-27. US-27 continues east to Clewiston.
From the south FL-29 connects the town from Immokalee. N River Rd, or County Road 78, enters LaBelle along the north bank of the river.
