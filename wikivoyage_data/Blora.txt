Blora is a regency in Central Java. This regency is famous for its teak forest area around Gubug Payung. It also has some large caves to explore. 


Understand[edit]
Blora is located at the middle eastern end of Central Java, Indonesia. 
The northern part of the regency is a hilly area that forms a series of Northern Limestone Mountains as well as in the southern area (Kendeng Mountains) that stretches from east of Semarang to Lamongan (East Java). 
Half of Blora Regency's area is forested, especially on the northern, eastern and southern region, while the central lowland is mainly used for agricultural purposes (rice fields). During the dry season, most of Blora Regency has a water supply shortage, either for drinking or irrigation, especially in limestone and mountainous areas. In the rainy season, areas are prone to landslides.
