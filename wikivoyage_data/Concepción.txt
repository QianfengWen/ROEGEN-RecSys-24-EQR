Stay safe[edit]
The city is generally safe, however:

Be aware of pickpockets and avoid wearing expensive-looking jewelry or watches, even during the day.
Do not visit Talcahuano's seaport, Hualpen and near areas in the night, especially on weekends.
Other residential areas such as Chiguayante, San Pedro de la Paz, are worth visiting but have their dangerous places also, so be careful when going unaccompanied by people who live there or know well the place.
Respect[edit]
Population is very tolerant and friendly.
As the rest of country, this city has largely conservative Catholic and Protestant population but Freemasonry has an important influence in culture, education and business here.
Very strong social movements and political activity, sometimes heavily polarizated, be careful while discussing topics such as Pinochet's regime or Pacific War.
Mind your vocabulary, in contrast with the rest of Chile, Concepcion is highly populated by university students, so they can understand if you are talking in English. Avoid unnecessary comments about the city and people.
Go next[edit]
