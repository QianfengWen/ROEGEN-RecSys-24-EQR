Tillamook is the county seat of Tillamook County, near the Northern Oregon Coast. It is the gateway to the Three Capes Scenic Area which is the coastline between the mouth of Tillamook Bay in the north, down to Cape Lookout in the south. 
This article contains information about both Tillamook proper and the surrounding Three Capes Scenic Area.


Understand[edit]
Cape Meares Lighthouse In Oceanside
Tillamook is a dairy town located inland from the coast near the shores of Tillamook Bay. It is the largest city in the area, and most famously home to the TIllamook County Creamery Association who make Tillamook Cheese. Although the area's dairy farms were established as far back as the 1850s, the TCCA was founded in 1909 and built the first cheese factory (still located at the current site) in 1949. While only a fraction of Tillamook brand products are still produced at this facility as the TCCA has grown over the years, it remains at the core of the city and regional economy.
Outside of Tillamook, outdoor recreational opportunities abound in the bays and the sea. The coastal communities of Oceanside, Netarts, and Cape Meares become hotspots for summer getaways, although off-season visits can be enjoyable with a different (chilly and wet) vibe.

Fishing[edit]
Many Oregonians enjoy crabbing, fishing and clamming in both Tillamook and Netarts Bays as well as the local rivers. The Wilson River is renowned for salmon and steelhead fishing, and other nearby coastal rivers like the Trask, Tillamook and Kilchis rivers have plenty to offer as well. The Barview Jetty on the north side of the Tillamook Bay inlet is known to have consistent surf fishing. Deep sea charters and guide services are readily available in both Tillamook and Garibaldi.
Crabbing and fishing can be done from shore, but it is also possible to rent a boat and any other gear you need on site to increase your opportunities in either of the bays. It is recommended to ask about the local conditions at a sporting goods store or somewhere similar. They can offer some advice about whether any money or time invested would be well spent, and point you toward rental boats and equipment if needed.

Other recreation[edit]
Kayaking around Netarts and Tillamook Bays is common, and allows for opportunities to explore areas that are difficult to access otherwise. Keep track of the tides, and be cautious near the inlets of the bays, as swift currents can easily pull you out to sea.
Warm weather often brings paragliders and hang gliders out to Oceanside, which has a spectacular view from its launch point. Watch them soar above and land on the beach front, or drive up to the launch point high above and see how it's done. If you have equipment (and training) of your own, it's a great place to soar.
The nearby Tillamook State Forest and Sand Lake Recreation Area (see Pacific City) have a multitude of areas to ride all-terrain vehicles. Rentals are not common, but can be arranged.

Buy[edit]
Even within the beachside villages, Tillamook and the surrounding area don't have a whole lot to offer in the way of touristy trinkets. Tillamook has a Fred Meyer and Safeway for any routine purchases and groceries, but visitors should take note of the seafood and meat options that are available. Of course, Tillamook's dairy products can be purchased at thousands of grocery stores in the U.S., but other quality food products of the region don't have quite the same reach.
