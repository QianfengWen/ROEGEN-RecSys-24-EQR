Sassafras a small town, east of Melbourne in the Yarra Valley region. In the forest, this beautiful town has many sights and eclectic stores.


Understand[edit]
Sassafras was originally named Sassafras Gully due to the large numbers of Doryphora sassafras trees in a gully in the area.
In 1918 there were 13 guest houses in the town, making it a leading resort in the Dandenong Ranges. Tourists travelled to Sassafras by railway, alighting at Upper Ferntree Gully.

Get in[edit]

By train[edit]
Catch the Belgrave line train and get off at Upper Ferntree Gully station then catch the 688 bus (Ferntree Gully - Croydon). To use public transport requires a Myki card, which costs $6 (or $3 for children/concession) from post offices, milk-bars, petrol stations and train stations. Once you have the Myki card it needs to be topped up with money. An adult fee (for one trip) is approximately $3 (it changes frequently) whilst the child/concession fee is $1.50. The number of stops taken doesn't change the cost.

By car[edit]
Head east on Burwood Hwy, then drive towards Ferny Creek and keep going past it up until you get to Sassafras.
