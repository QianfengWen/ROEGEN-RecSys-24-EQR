This article is about the city.  For its airport, see Incheon International Airport



Not to be confused with Icheon.

Incheon (Hangul: 인천, Hanja: 仁川, formerly romanized as Inchon) is a city in South Korea on the coast directly bordering the west of Seoul. It is a rapidly expanding centre for new urban development. Several beautiful islands, such as Yeongjong Island and Ganghwa Island, are also within city limits.
Most foreign travelers arrive in South Korea at Incheon International Airport and Incheon Port International Passenger Terminal.


Understand[edit]
Streetscape in Incheon
Incheon is a historically and economically significant place for Koreans. During the Korean War, the city was the site of the Incheon Landing by American forces. In 2016, Incheon became the third most populous city in the country after Seoul and Busan, with 3 million people, of whom about 60,000 are foreigners.
The city serves as a transportation hub by air and sea, with a massive harbor and a major international airport.
The status of the area is set to increase as various national projects are in development here. The New Songdo City plan, the most expensive real estate development in Korean history, is in progress. One of the world's tallest twin tower buildings, 151 Incheon Tower, is under early construction and one of Korea's tallest buildings, the Northeast Asia Trade Tower, is already finished. It is planned to launch further independent mini-cities for shopping, housing, and education. It received a lot of visitors for the 2014 Incheon Asian Games. Despite these developments, the Songdo district of Incheon is unfinished and not yet permitted for full habitation.
Famous places within Incheon Metropolitan City include Wolmido Island, the Chinatown, and the opening of the Woncheon Stream, Sorae Port and Incheon Grand Park in the southeastern region, Eulwangni Beach, Wangsan Beach, many islands, Songdo International City and Cheongna Lake Park.
However, Incheon Metropolitan City does not have a good place to look around various areas. Incheon is caused by a wide city area. However, there are no major difficulties because major tourist attractions are concentrated in Wondocheong Station and Ganghwa Island, while Incheon Grand Park, Sorae Port and the island are separate from those in Wondoche, Ganghwa Island and Yeongjong Island. And with the opening of city railroads and wide-area railroads in Incheon, travel between regions is also very convenient compared to other regions except Seoul.
And the easy thing to overlook is that the total area of Incheon metropolitan city is 1,062 km², much larger than the Seoul Metropolitan Government (605 km²), followed by Ulsan city (1,057 km²) among metropolitan cities. In addition, as it is long and divided into several islands, it takes a long time to travel around Incheon on public transportation.

Half of the island's total area is the site of Incheon International Airport. As shown by the satellite imagery above, the island was divided into four islands (Yeongjongdo, Sinbuldo, Sammokdo, and Yongyu Island) in the past, but it became an island through reclamation, and the vast mudflats between Yongyu Island have been transformed into an airport site.In the past, it was only possible to travel through an embankment linking the island to the island. Residents mainly lived on fishing or farming. Salt fields were huge all over the island, but now they're all closed. It overtook Ulleungdo in the late 2000s when reclamation projects were in full swing and surpassed Wando as well as Ulleungdo. It was later expanded to a width of 125 km², which is wider than the facial island, due to continued additional reclamation. The only road that connects is a motorway, so if you don't have a car, you'll have to take a bus, a railway, or a ship on Wolmi Island to get to land. Two-wheeled or large-sized special vehicles that cannot enter the highway must ride in a Paris that connects to Wolmido Island. In addition, there is a magnetic levitation railway at Incheon Airport due to orbital traffic within the island. In the long run, the plan will be a route that will circulate the entire island.
