Delungra  is a hamlet of 625 (2021) in the western part of the New England region in New South Wales.


Understand[edit]

The European explorer Allan Cunningham passed through this district in 1827. In 1838 local Aborigines were massacred by white settlers on a farm at Myall Creek south-west of the current hamlet, however the perpetrators were brought to justice, the first time for this crime in New South Wales. Delungra village itself was established as 'Reedy Creek' in the 1900s when the surrounding Myall Creek district was divided into 132 farms. The railway arrived in 1901 (closed 1987) and the settlement renamed to Delungra in 1906. Delungra is in the Inverell Shire Local Government Area.
