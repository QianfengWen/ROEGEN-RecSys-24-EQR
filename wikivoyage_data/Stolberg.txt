Stolberg Castle
Stolberg in the Harz is a health resort in the state of Saxony-Anhalt . It has a bit over 1500 inhabitants and is 300 m above sea level. It is known as the ‘pearl of Southern Harz’.


Understand[edit]
The town of Stolberg was established in the year 1000 as a settlement for miners, mining in the area can be traced back to the year 794, where they used to mine for iron, copper, tin, silver and gold. However this was discontinued in the 17th century.
On 2 May 1525 a rebellion took place under the leadership of Thomas Müntzer, this was known as the German Peasant war.  They invaded the city and forced Count Botho of Stolberg to accept their demands, all demands were reversed shortly after.
The town was awarded to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815, and administered in the Prussian Province of Saxony. 
The half timbered houses which were designed in the Renaissance style can be dated back to the 15th century, for this reason Stolberg was named the “Historical City of Europe”.
At the beginning of the 20th century tourists started to visit the town, which became a resort in 1946.
