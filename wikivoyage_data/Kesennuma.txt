Port of Kesennuma after Tsunami
Oshima, which lays off the coast, is accessible by ferry from multiple ferry ports.  Oshima is home to beautiful beaches which are quite popular in the summer, as is the Kame-yama lift which takes you up Oshima's Kameyama.  The view of the island and city is beautiful.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The nearest expressway to Kesennuma can be found in Ichinoseki, an hour's drive to the east.  There are local highways that run north along the coast to Aomori and south toward Ishinomaki.  These are rather scenic but are relatively slow, particularly in areas where post-tsunami construction work is heavy.

By train[edit]
Before the tsunami, there was a train line running up the coast from Sendai.  There was also a train line continuing north from Kesennuma.  Both were destroyed and have not been replaced.  To reach Kesennuma by train, one can take the Tohoku Shinkansen to Ichinoseki, Iwate, and transfer to a local line, which terminates at Kesennuma Station.

38.909747141.5591531 Kesennuma Station (気仙沼駅), 古町一丁目5-25. 05:00-20:00. This is the main train station for Kesennuma.  There is a small store and sitting area. 
By bus[edit]
Highway buses connect Kesennuma with Sendai and Tokyo. Buses between Sendai and Kesennuma run six times a day. An overnight bus linking Kesennuma and Ikebukuro in Tokyo runs every night.
The BRT (bus rapid transit), which replaced the train line running up the coast from Sendai, also connects Kesennuma with Minamisanriku, and Sendai by way of transfer to train lines starting near Ishinomaki.
Get around[edit]
