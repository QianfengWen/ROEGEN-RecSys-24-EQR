Steinbach, a city of 13,500 people in Eastern Manitoba, makes a good day trip from Winnipeg.


Understand[edit]
Mennonite Heritage Village
Steinbach, founded by Mennonites in 1874 on land which had belonged to the Ojibway-speaking Anishinabe people, is now Manitoba's third largest city (behind Winnipeg and Brandon). A little over half of the population is of German descent; the city's name means "Stony Brook" in German.
While Steinbach is largely modern, traces of its Mennonite past can still be found; a few conservative Mennonite groups still make the city home and many local businesses close their doors on the Sabbath.
For visitors, the city's star attraction is the Mennonite Heritage Village, a living museum to Steinbach's agricultural past.
