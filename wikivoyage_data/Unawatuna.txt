Unawatuna is a beach resort town in southern Sri Lanka 5 km south of Galle. It can be seen as a suburb of Galle, and has undergone lots of tourist development over the last several decades.

The tarred road, a kilometre in length, brings you to the best area of Unawatuna with all the guest houses, homestays, restaurants, and other tourist facilities.

By plane[edit]
Unawatuna is 150 km south of Colombo's Bandaranayaka International Airport in Katunayaka. Public transport from Bandaranayake International Airport to Colombo is available just outside the airport. The journey through busy Colombo roads take over 3 hours by private vehicles. Most hotels and guesthouses offer an airport pick-up service for a hassle-free quick get-away (Rs 8500).
