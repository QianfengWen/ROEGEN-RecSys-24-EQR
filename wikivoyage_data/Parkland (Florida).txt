Parkland is a city of about 31,500 people (2016) in western Broward County about 20 miles (32 km) from Fort Lauderdale.


Understand[edit]
It is a mostly residential community, with many housing developments, and public parks. Parkland is known for its zoning laws, which are designed to protect the "park-like" character of the city. There were no stores or traffic lights in Parkland until the mid-1990s and early 2000s when large neighborhood developments (Heron Bay and Parkland Isles) were built.
It gained notoriety in February 2018 as the location of the deadliest school shooting in American history, which took place at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.
