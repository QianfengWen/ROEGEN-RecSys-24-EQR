Pilica is a market town in the Silesian Voivodeship in southwest Poland. With a population of 1900 in 2019, it's the administrative centre for a straggle of villages in the Kraków-Częstochowa Upland, the limestone hills also known as the "Polish Jura".

See[edit]
50.468219.65711 Rynek is the market square in town centre, flanked by modern low-rise and with a repro of the 17th century town hall. Visitors find it a bit bare.
Church of Saints John is 100 m west of Rynek - that's St John the Baptist and St John the Evangelist, Kościół św Jana Chrzciciela i św Jana Ewangelisty, but mercifully none of the other 80 saints or holy men of that name. It was built around 1600 then modified in Baroque style. It remains closed in 2024.
Chapel of St George (Kaplica św Jerzego) was built as a hospital chapel in 1630. It's 200 m south of Rynek at Krakowska 10, where you're unlikely to find it open.
St Valentine's was the church of an Augustinian monastery. It's just a crumbling wall shrouded by cypress trees at Ogrodowa 6A.
50.467219.64922 Pilica Castle, Zamkowa. Closed. This is its third or fourth incarnation, the "Sobieskiej Palace" created in the 1730s by removing defensive features and making it a bling mansion. This passed through various private and state owners and in 1989 was bought by Barbara Piasecka Johnson (1937-2013) to house her art collection. Renovation work was halted in 1992 when the sale was disputed, and the legal ructions were still grinding through the courts 20 years later when Johnson died. Nobody else has the money or will to take on such a huge place mired in an ownership dispute, so this grand old pile has fallen derelict.  (updated Jun 2024)
