Kerak (also spelt Karak, Arabic al-Kerak) is a small, Arab city (population 170,000) in southern Jordan. 

Crusader castle

Understand[edit]
View of the old city of Karak from the Crusader fort
It has a significant Christian population. Kerak is on the King's Highway, 124 km south of the capital Amman, and is the site of a magnificently-situated Crusader castle, now an evocative ruin on the skyline above the city.
In biblical times Kerak was the capital of the Moab Kingdom. Later it was ruled by the Nabataeans, after which the Romans took over. Under the Byzantines it was used as the seat of a bishopric. Left abandoned until 1140, when the crusaders acknowledged its strategic meaning and built a mighty fortress here. Only 50 years later it was conquered by the Arabs.

Get in[edit]
There are three bus stations in Kerak. 31.18270835.706091 One bus station is near the castle, and 
the 31.16515535.7396232 Kerak Bus Station is in the south-eastern part of the city about 5 km from the old city. Ask someone local which one to use for the surrounding area, or to get to Madaba or Petra.
Minibuses Aqaba (1.75 JD) run roughly hourly. These also pass through Madaba and Ma'an (for Petra).
From Amman, mini-buses leave from the South Bus Station (Mujemma Al-Janoob) when full (2.25 JD, 2 hr, Oct 2018). They arrive at the station below the castle. A taxi up to the castle (al-Qasr) will cost 2 JD. It is a 20-min walk back down to the bus station. It is easy to see the castle on a day trip from Amman.

Get around[edit]
Between the old city and the rest of the city local (shared) taxis should be used for around 2 JD.
By car, the roads in town are narrow and usually one-way, but the town is compact, so you can park wherever you find space and walk to the castle.

Do[edit]
31.30066835.6264351 Wadi Bin Hammad (31 km northwest of Kerak). This is an official tourist spot, but mostly only appreciated by local people. This in turn means it is widely untouched and without the common touristic hassles. The wadi can be wandered easily and without much effort in about 2 hr, rewarding the curious traveller with a beautiful green surrounding including waterfalls and even hot springs. Hiking further will lead you to the Dead Sea, even though you might need help of a guide with the necessary equipment. Be careful when it is raining or about to rain. You might have to take a taxi to get there, because it is not along the highway. 
Eat & drink[edit]
Many medium-priced restaurants with local and partly international cuisine can be found around the castle. From there into the old city, restaurants get less expensive.
Kerak is most famous for the Jordan national dish mansaf, which you should definitely try. It is rice with lamb or chicken meat served with a sauce made from special yoghurt called jameed. 

 Karak Rest House. See also Sleep. Next to the citadel and with views all the way to the Dead Sea on a good day, but the food is overpriced and mediocre. Beers 2 JD. 
 Delicious Meal (Walk down the steep hill towards the main road in Karak, turn right and walk down past the Circle and it's on the left hand side, there is a giant sign with its name on it.). You can get an excellent schwarma here and it's really cheap too. Much better than the overpriced mediocre food next to the castle. 
 Kir Hebes (just down the road opposite the castle entrance). Has some interesting offerings like ostrich, otherwise fairly good standard Jordanian fare. Has local wines and other alcohol. The tables by the street are nicer. 5-10 JD. 
 Syrian Restaurant (green door at the upper end of King Hussein Street). This is supposed to be an insider tip.
