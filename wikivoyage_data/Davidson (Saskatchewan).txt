Grain elevators in Davidson
In 1902, Colonel Andrew Duncan Davidson came to Saskatchewan in hopes of creating a 'midway' settlement between the cities of Regina and Saskatoon. With agriculture as one of his main passions, Davidson purchased 700,000 acres (2,800 km2) from the railway and the federal government suitable for grain farming. Davidson organized a train route that travelled from Chicago to Saskatoon; making one stop in Davidson on the way. Within a short period of time, Davidson, which was declared the name of the community, was nicknamed the 'Midway Town' because of its central location. On November 15, 1906, Davidson was officially declared a town.
