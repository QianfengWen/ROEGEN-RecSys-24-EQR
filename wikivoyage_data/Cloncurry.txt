Cloncurry is a town in Outback Queensland. 


Understand[edit]
The copper mines of Cloncurry quickly made this town one of the most prosperous in the Outback. Down through the years since the copper lode was discovered in 1867, Cloncurry has hosted a plethora of other historic occasions.
It was here where the idea for Qantas was first mooted. 'Conceived in Cloncurry, born in Winton and grew up in Longreach' goes a local saying. The original hangar still stands at the local aerodrome.
The Royal Flying Doctor Service was also launched in Cloncurry. Visit John Flynn Place to get an insight into the story of this iconic outback service. The town is nicknamed "The Friendly Heart of the Great North West".

There are many motels on the highway (Ramsay St), some pubs on Scarr St and some caravan parks. Demand from mining leads to high prices.
