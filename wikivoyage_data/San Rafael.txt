Historically home to one of California's original Spanish missions, San Rafael is now a mid-sized Bay Area commuter town with beautiful hills, peaceful nature, interesting architecture, and a bustling downtown area centered around 4th Street. San Rafael is the cultural and political center of Marin County, and offers its own set of attractions as well as easy access to other parts of the county.

Larkspur landing with express ferries from San Francisco.
By car[edit]
San Rafael is on the 101 Freeway, north of San Francisco over the Golden Gate Bridge. 101 crosses Highway 580 in San Rafael, making the city a major influx point for drivers from the East Bay.

By ferry[edit]
Ferries run from the ferry terminal in Union Square-Financial District, downtown San Francisco. With hourly departures, every 30 minutes during rush hours, ferries are a convenient way of reaching San Rafael. 37.944637-122.5088241 Larkspur Ferry Terminal is about two kilometers from downtown, but is served by buses and the SMART train.

By bus[edit]
The 37.971077-122.5227642 San Rafael Transit Center is a hub for local buses, with service to other parts of Marin provided by Marin Transit and service to Sonoma County, San Francisco, and Richmond provided by Golden Gate Transit. The Marin and Oakland airporters (with service to San Francisco International Airport and Oakland International Airport) and Greyhound buses also stop at the transit center.

By train[edit]
Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit, or SMART, has two stations in San Rafael, connecting it with Novato, Larkspur (with connections to the Golden Gate Ferry to San Francisco), and places in Sonoma County: Petaluma, Rohnert Park, Santa Rosa, and Sonoma County Airport. One railroad station is located downtown at the Transit Center, and the other is between the Civic Center and Northgate Mall.

By plane[edit]
The nearest major airports are San Francisco International Airport (SFO) and Oakland International Airport (OAK). To get to San Rafael from SFO, you can take the Marin Airporter, which departs SFO every half hour, early morning to late evening, and drops passengers at Anderson Drive and at the Transit Center. Fare is $23 to be paid in cash when you get off.
Groome Transportation, formerly the Airport Express or Oakland Airporter, goes to San Rafael from Oakland Airport, departing every two hours.

Get around[edit]
Downtown San Rafael is based on a grid network, with numbered streets running east-west and lettered streets running north-south. The downtown area is walkable, but to visit other places like the Civic Center or China Camp, you're better off driving or biking. Marin Transit's bus service, mentioned above, is also a feasible option for getting to different areas.
Taxis are available in San Rafael, and they can also take you to other towns in Marin. You won't usually be able to hail one off the street, but you can call one, and they also line up at the transit center. You can call a taxi from North Bay Cooperative Taxi at +1-415-258-2800.

The Civic Center
Fourth Street, the main street in central San Rafael, is full of shops and restaurants and has a vibrant downtown feel.

The 20th of the 21 California missions, San Rafael was founded as an asistencia or adjunct to Mission Dolores in San Francisco in 1817, but was promoted to full mission status in 1822. San Rafael was a hospital mission, tending the sick from Spanish settlements and natives. The first mission secularized, it was used by General John C. Fremont during the Mexican-American War, and during statehood as the Marin County Courthouse. The original church was torn down in 1861, and a series of Catholic churches were erected at that site. The mission chapel has been restored in 1949, and tours of the site as well as a museum containing three original mission bells are open to the public. Free.   
37.999722-122.532 Marin County Civic Center. The Civic Center is the only example of a Frank Lloyd Wright-designed government building in the world, and was considered to be well ahead of its time, making it a creative choice as the backdrop of the film Gattaca. Ninety-minute tours of the building leave every Wednesday and Friday at 10:30AM from the café on the second floor (room 233) and cost $10 ($5 for seniors and students). A branch of the county's public library, where you can see a model of the Civic Center, is located on the fourth floor. Next to the building is the large Duck Pond, officially the Civic Center Lagoon, a nice, shady area to take a walk or feed ducks.   (updated Jun 2017)

Stay safe[edit]
San Rafael's crime rate is higher than most of Marin County, but it is still much safer than larger nearby cities like San Francisco or Oakland.
If you decide to venture into the Canal District, stay alert, even in the daytime, as parts of it are quite dangerous. However, it is home to some of the best Latin food in the Bay Area. Try not to wear too much red- or blue-colored clothing—you may be confused as a rival to another gang and approached. It is best not to walk around the Canal District at night. West of Kerner is more dangerous than East of Kerner, which has nice town homes along the water.
Parts of Downtown, Terra Linda, and near Woodland Avenue have some crime as well so just be aware of your surroundings and don't dress all in red or blue.
