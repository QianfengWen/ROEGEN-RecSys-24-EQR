Wailea, and the smaller Makena to the south, are resort areas on the south side of Maui, Hawaii, immediately south of the town of Kihei. They are known for their luxury resort hotels and condos, upscale restaurants, fancy shopping center and expensive golf courses. And although hidden behind the hotels and condos now, the beaches that attracted the developers in the first place are still there in all their golden sand beauty.


Get in[edit]
From Maui's main airport in Kahului, follow the signs to Kihei and Wailea via Highway 311 (Mokulele Highway).  Highway 311 becomes Highway 31 (Pi'ilani Highway) in Kihei and it ends in Wailea, where it becomes Wailea Ike Drive. Driving time from the airport to Wailea is about 30 minutes.

Get around[edit]
The main street through town is Wailea Alanui Drive and The Shops at Wailea (Wailea Alanui Drive and Wailea Ike Drive) serve as the center of town.

The long stretch of Big Beach at Makena State Park
See[edit]
 Makena Beach, South Makena Rd (in Makena State Park 1 mi S of the Maui Prince Hotel, there are two parking lots on the W side of the road). A beautiful stretch of beach south of Wailea that is good for swimming. There are two beaches -- Big Beach, which is the main one, and Little Beach, which is over a hill at the north end of Big Beach. Facilities are limited with just pit toilets and a few picnic tables. It's a good idea to bring your own food if you want to eat as the concession trailer is very expensive for what you get. 
Do[edit]
Go swimming or snorkeling at one of the many beaches along the coast.  Take a stroll along the Wailea Beach Walk.  It stretches for a mile and a half and connects the town's beaches.  In winter, it provides a good spot to watch whales.
If you're a golf enthusiast, there are two golf clubs with five courses in the area.

Go next[edit]
Wailea/Makena is almost as far as you can go south, but there are a couple of good spots to go to for snorkeling and hiking before the road ends for good.

 Ahihi-Kina'u Natural Area Reserve, S Makena Rd (about 1.5 mi/2.4 km S of the Maui Prince Hotel). An offshore reserve with good snorkeling and sea turtles sometimes.  There is a rocky parking area on the right shortly after entering the reserve. 
 La Perouse Bay, S Makena Rd (about 3 mi/5 km S of the Maui Prince Hotel). The end of the road where the lava from Maui's last eruption flowed into the sea. There are some stables near the parking lot and a rocky beach, although it isn't recommended for swimming. There are also a couple of hiking trails, including the Hoapili Trail which winds its way along the coast through some shade and then strikes inland over the lava fields to Kanaio Beach some 2 - 2.5 miles away. The coastal parts are quite pretty but the section through the lava can be long and warm. 
Heading north up Highway 31 will bring you to the main part of Maui, which is all accessible within a day's drive.
