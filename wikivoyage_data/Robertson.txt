Robertson is a small town in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales.  Situated at the top of the range, the climate of Robertson can differ quite markedly from the coastal areas, with mist and showery rain common in the winter.  The climate makes this dairy and cheese country.


Get in[edit]
By car via the Illawarra Highway (which connects to the Hume and the Princes Highways).  When you reach the top of the Macquarie Pass you are at Robertson.  The pie shop is on the highway.  The rest of the town is a short drive away.
NSW Trainlink Intercity services Robertson by bus twice daily from Wollongong and Moss Vale, with services extending to Bundanoon.
The 3801 Cockatoo Run heads up the range to Robertson some Sundays.

Get around[edit]
If you get off the Cockatoo Run train at the station, you can walk to the main strip of the town - the pub, the old cheese factory, and the antique stores.  The Pie Shop is a fair hike down the road, and an enthusiastic walk.  The surrounding walkable area is farmland and residential, and the National Park areas aren't really within walking distance.
There is no local public transport or taxis available in town.

The one and only Big Potato
Robertson itself is immediately surrounded by agricultural land.  The movie Babe was filmed here, and the farms (somewhat unsurprisingly) look much like the set of the movie.  The flies are there to annoy you when walking in the area during summer.

-34.589209150.5980831 Big Potato (off Illawarra Hwy). Smack dab in the middle of town, the unmissable 10-meter-long Big Potato is Robertson's top attraction.  It's also known as the Big Turd, for reasons that are clear once you spot this suspiciously cylindrical brown object. (updated Sep 2022)
Robertson still has the train track, still has the station, but no regular passenger train service any longer.  The Robertson train station is still in perfect condition, and heritage listed.  Freight and coal trains do pass this way frequently, so do be careful to not walk on the tracks.
The Macquarie Pass National Park lies just to the west of the town, with cliffs, rainforest, coastal views and waterfalls. There is no entry fee to the park.
-34.639091150.5589942 Belmore Falls, Belmore Falls Rd, Wildes Meadow, ☏ +61 2 4887 7270. It's one of the few dramatic waterfalls you can't see anywhere else. (updated Oct 2021)
Do[edit]
Drive The scenery and bends heading up the Macquarie Pass make it a popular weekend drive, especially with motorcycles.
-34.5888150.59771 Spud Lane Gallery, U1/74-76 Hoddle Street (back of Highlands Hive), ☏ +61 450 959 355. Th-Su 10AM-4PM. Unique boutique NY loft-style art gallery and working studio with a hint of the Parisian salon. A must—see if you love art. (updated Apr 2023)

Eat[edit]
-34.585944150.6263121 Robertson Pie Shop, 4400 Illawarra Hwy, ☏ +61 2 4885 1330. M-F 7AM–5PM, Sa Su 8AM–5PM. On the highway, has big signs, and some interesting decor. The pies aren't the best in the world (as claimed) but they certainly aren't the worst. A nice place to stop. For something different (and decadent) try the apricot pies filled with fresh cream. (updated Oct 2021)
-34.58944150.5960442 Moonacres Kitchen, 81 Illawarra Hwy, ☏ +61 2 4885 1788. It's just another cafe out on the highway, but this one closer to town. (updated Oct 2021)
Drink[edit]
 Robertson Inn (Robertson main street). It has a nice log fire in the winter. Serves pub meals. Terrace with views over rolling countryside. Quite a local crowd there usually, as well as some passing through.

If you have a car, the surrounding national parks along the range are well worth visiting.  Fitzroy Falls is an easy trip out of town, and Belmore Falls is just a short diversion on the way.  The rest of the Southern Highlands is only 30 minutes away.
