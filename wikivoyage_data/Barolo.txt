See[edit]
Barolo is a world famous wine city. It is the namesake city for the "king of wines and the wine of kings." Barolo is a very scenic small town. The surrounding countryside is spectacular. There are some very panoramic views from the Castello Falletti. However, if you are not interested in wine, there is not much to see or do in Barolo. For the non-wine lover, it is probably not worth the drive up from Alba.
The most scenic spot in town is the Castello Falletti which is located in the center of town. The Castello Falletti contains a number of interesting sights, including a museum and an enoteca. The Castello was built in the 10th century for protection against marauding Huns. Parts of the original 10th century keep are still standing, although much of the original structure was destroyed by the Savoyards in 1544.
