Cochabamba, or simply Cocha is fourth largest city in central Bolivia, in a valley with the same name, in the Andes mountain range. Its name is from a compound of the Quechua words q'ucha, meaning "lake", and pampa, "open plain". It is known as the "City of Eternal Spring" and "The Garden City" because of its spring-like temperatures all year round. It is also known as La Llajta, which means "town" in Quechua.

Understand[edit]
14 de Septiembre Square and the Catedral Metropolitana de San Sebastián
Orientation[edit]
The main thoroughfare in Cochabamba is Avenida de las Heroinas, which runs east-west, with its north-south counterpart Avenida Ayacucho. The intersection of these two is known as El Correo (the post office is located on that intersection). Plaza 14 de Septiembre is considered the center of the city. Avenida Ballivian, commonly called El Prado, is a tree-lined boulevard running north from Plaza Colon, with many of the city's better restaurants and hotels nearby. Generally, neighborhoods get more affluent towards the north, and poorer to the south. Avenida América north of La Recoleta runs east to west is also a major avenue with many restaurants and shopping.

Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
The terminal is some 10 blocks south of the center, just north of the market called La Cancha. From the north, you can catch several trufi lines to get to the bus terminal. For example, the green 101, the 102, the 103, the 109, all travel along Av. Ayacucho, passing the bus terminal. At the north end of the terminal, there are radio taxis associated with the terminal. These are much more convenient to get to your destination. If you are traveling with a lot of luggage, it is not recommended that you exit the main terminal to catch a bus. It's quite hectic making you an easier target for pickpocketing. It is also not recommended walking from the terminal especially late at night.
Most bus companies will charge around the same amount for a ticket, but there are different seat classes. Weirdly enough, even though it is a poor country, the amount of "leito" seats (aka cama) is far higher than that of semi-cama or regular seats.
Bus times are generally quite accurate, because the station is so busy that buses cannot wait forever at a platform. Arrive about 1 hr before the bus leaves to get the best price.
Always be aware of roadblocks while traveling in Bolivia. If companies know of existing roadblocks, many of them will halt their services, while others will take you as far as the roadblock, and you'll have to pay again after crossing the roadblock. It's always recommended to wait for a roadblock to be lifted before traveling, even if a bus will take you that far.

Destinations[edit]
From/to La Paz – It is at least eight hours by bus. Buses leave approximately every hour starting at 06:30, with the last bus leaving around 23:00. Regular seats tend to be at around Bs. 30, semi-camas typically will max out at Bs. 60., and camas will typically max out at Bs. 90.
From/to Santa Cruz – It is at least ten hours by bus, longer in the rainy season. Buses leave in the mornings and in the evenings, with the last bus typically leaving around 22:00. Regular seats tend to be at Bs. 40., semi-camas typically will be at Bs. 70., and camas will typically be at Bs. 110.

Get around[edit]
By bus[edit]
Cochabamba has buses (micros), mini-vans (trufis) and shared cabs (taxi-trufis) that run along fixed routes. There are no set stops and in order to get off, you must say "me bajo" (I want to get off) or "esquina" (for stop at the corner). Fares are Bs. 1.90. (Many drivers do not have adequate change, so do not be surprised if you do not receive change).

By taxi[edit]
Most cars honking at you are cabs. Ask and negotiate the fare before entering a cab. According to regulations that aren't very well publicized (some mentions in the local press), the price should be Bs. 6 for one person within the city center (inside the boundaries of the river). Crossing the bridges, adds another Bs. 2. Adding additional passengers should cost between Bs. 1 and Bs. 2/person. Downtown to Quillacollo is Bs. 25-30 There is no standard fare, and most taxi drivers will try to overcharge tourists.

The stairs are safe during the day. After sunset it is better to go in a group of 4 or more. However, the warning displayed at the cable car station, not to use the stairs, is obviously just there to make more money. The cable car is often under maintenance. There is no good way to know before heading out to the station, but the local newspaper is pretty good about updating any changes. (updated Sep 2020)

Matches usually take place on Sunday afternoons, as well as some weekday evenings. Matches rarely sell out, and one can buy a ticket the day of the game choosing among different seating sections. "Preferencia" is the most expensive, around Bs. 50-80 per match (depending on the rival), but for afternoon matches its location has the most shade. The supporter groups for Wilstermann are seated in the middle portion of both endzone (curvas).
The city is Bolivia's paragliding capital. Several agencies offer tandem flights (Bs. 300) and courses. A typical beginner´s course will take minimum 10 days (2 hours theory and 4 hours practice every day, 12 solo flights) and cost about Bs. 3,000. Among the cheapest on the continent.

Beyond the city[edit]
There are some towns and places around Cochabamba worth visiting and even several day excursions:

 Hot springs. There is a nice hot spring near Cochabamba. Travel time one way is around 1½ hours, mostly due to roundabout trufi routes. To get there, take a trufi from the southeast corner of Plaza Sucre, near the University, to Quillacollo, 12 or so km to the west. Get off at the main plaza in Quillacollo, Plaza Bolivar, and walk one block west to Calle Santa Cruz. On the north side of the main road, you should be able to pick up a trufi on Calle Santa Cruz to the hot springs. You´ll have to walk the last 1.5 km. The trufi costs Bs. 5. Entrance fee is Bs. 4.

Work[edit]
Volunteer[edit]
Some organizations charge a fee for volunteer or intern to cover logistical and organizational costs. Please ask each organization for their policy.

 Sustainable Bolivia, Calle Julio Arauco Prado 230 (between Ave. Heroinas and Calle Sucre). 09:00-18:00. Sustainable Bolivia is an umbrella NGO that matches volunteers with local projects in Cochabamba. They typically have 15-25 volunteers working between the 25-30 local projects at any given time. They rent three houses that volunteers will live in, and also offer homestays. Most volunteers will confirm their projects several weeks before starting, and will commit to at least a month in Cochabamba. That means that their houses are sometimes full, and they cannot provide housing to walk-ins, particularly those who cannot commit to at least a month of time. Grants to organizations are administered by the volunteers themselves, so they know how the money is being used. 
 Instituto para el Desarrollo Humano, Humboldt 829, ☏ +591 4 4118315. An excellent social justice organization which offers volunteers the ability to train and facilitate with required social issues affecting many underrepresented Bolivians. They offer a homestay with safe, respectable families as well as a social network to keep you in the loops of cultural events whilst staying safe. 
 Red Tinku, Plaza 14 de Septiembre (weekdays only), ☏ +591 71769493. This is the only autonomous social center in Bolivia. You can take part in their brigadas (work camps) in rural areas or different kinds of workshops in Cochabamba. 
Buy[edit]
One of the city's biggest attractions is La Cancha, the city market on the south side of town and the largest open-air market in South America. Clothing, food, souvenirs, or books, the Cancha has it all. The Cancha is generally bound in the area bound by: Av. Aroma, Av. Ayacucho, Av. 6 de Agosto, Av. República, and Av. Oquendo.
The best day to visit the market is on Saturday, on other days not all the shops are open. Pickpockets are fairly common in this area.
If you don't want to get knee-deep into the sprawling Cancha for your souvenirs, there is also a small pasaje behind the Post Office. You can enter from Av. Heroínas Avenue or Esteban Arze. Prices are comparable to La Cancha and you can pick up typical Cochabamba goods.

The Spitting Llama Bookstore & Outfitter[dead link], 615 Calle España Norte (between streets La Paz and Reza) offers offers a wide range of trekking, camping equipment and gear.
Eat[edit]
Lunchtime usually consists of a fixed menu at a number of restaurants or pensiones around time. The "almuerzo completo" consists of soup + main dish and often an appetizer and dessert. There are many options to find the menu displayed outside the door, usually consisting of your choice of two soups or 2-3 main dishes. This fixed menu varies in price depending on the part of town, and could run between Bs. 15-25.
Silpancho is traditional Bolivian dish that supposedly originates from Cochabamba.
Thanks to the city's origin as an agricultural center for mining communities, Cochabamba claims to have the best food in Bolivia.

 Casablanca, Calle 25 de Mayo (Half a block from Plaza Colon). Very happening place frequented by Bolivians and gringos alike. Large and varied reasonably-priced menu influenced by the Italian owner.

Casa de Campo, Av. Uyuni 618, among other upscale restaurants in Recoleta. Large plates of food (even the half-plate was too much) and good pique macho and other local dishes. Price range is Bs. 37-50. Probably one of the best restaurants in town. Highly recommended.
Sucremanta, Several locations: Plaza 14 de Septiembre, and on the Prado. Small but filling menu, -somewhat spicey. The Plaza branch, with live piano music on Sundays, is a great place for brunch. Try the hearty menudito.
Dumbo, Av. Heroinas E-0354, also El Prado 55. Bolivia's favorite family restaurant. The main joint on Heroinas is always packed, with four dining floors and enough dancers in animal suits to keep the entire juvenile population of Cochabamba entertained.
 Meihua, SW corner of Plaza Colon. Lunch, dinner and in between.. Standard Chinese. A bit greasy but cheap. The entradas at around Bs. 15 are full meals. 
 Bufalo Rodizio, Avenida Oquendo N. 0654 (The entrance is through the elevator found on the right as you enter the shopping mall). A Brazilian churasco style restaurant where the waiters comes to your table with a good selection of freshly grilled meats. Delicious. Note that there is only the choice of a buffet style dinner in the evenings, priced very reasonable. Bs. 85 for all you can eat. (updated Jul 2020)
Paprika, North American style dishes and internationalized Bolivian classics. Yummy hot wings. The restaurant has the air of a place for the "see and be seens" in Cochabamba. Recommended. Avenida Ramon Rivero, on the corner of Lanza. Open in the evenings.
 Jacaranda, Tadeo Haenke. Not near the city center at all, but it has the reputation of best charque joint in town. Some people say that you can't leave Cochabamba without trying the charque, though it does really just taste like fried beef jerky. Charque is llama meat which is dried, then baked in the oven, then fried for the ultimate crispiness. The half-plate at Jacaranda comes with at least a pound of dried llama jerky, 2 boiled eggs, and the tastiest choclo (oooh the cheese slab was so thick and crumbly). The half-plate was about a 5-inch high pile, ran Bs. 50 and feeds a normal-sized person for lunch and dinner. 
 Zhou, Av. Villarroel esq. Ciclovia. The food here isn't authentic Asian. It's slightly pricey, with sushi (mostly trucha-salmon imported from La Paz. 
 La Estancia, La Recoleta (Av. Uyuni). Upscale and pleasant Argentinian steak place. Portions aren't of the legendary Cochabamba size, but rather of the normal steak-portion size. Word is that the salad bar is amazing. You can get those skinny skinny chip-like potato fry crisps here. Cut of chicken breast fillet is about Bs. 35 and steak Bs. 45-50. 
 Buenos Aires:, Ballivian No. 539 (El Prado). Great airy location on the Prado, next to Brazilian Coffee, and serves a decent almuerzo. Although the food is presented prettily, the quality is más o menos (quantity is certainly menos), but has the advantage of not being greasy and comes with an open salad bar. Accepts Visa. Almuerzo complete for Bs. 18 (Bs. 25 on Sunday), Latté Bs. 7, salads Bs. 26, steak (large portions) Bs. 30-40. 
 Sole Mio, Av. América N° 826 entre Pando y Mechor Urquidi. An Italian joint, whose specialty is pizzas from the oven. Gael Garcia Bernal was once seen here eating when he was filming a movie on location about Cochabamba's water wars. Pizza comes out remarkably fast but the service isn't. It is a decent quality, not as good as in the U.S. but better than Eli's. Watch out for overcharging! Pizzas run about Bs. 50 for a medium and Bs. 40 for a personal.

Most small bars are on 25 de Mayo and España close to Plaza Colon. Av. Ballivian (Prado) has bigger and noisier stuff. The joints grow fancier and more expensive has you head north into Recoleta, centred on Calle Pando.

There are dozens and dozens of hotels and hostales between the bus terminal and the center (Plaza 14 de Septiembre). This area is not very safe late at night, however, and these options should only really be considered if none of the above are available. Always take a cab back to these locations after dark.

Mid-range[edit]
The upper end hotels are mostly concentrated within a block or two from Plaza Colon. Expect to pay upwards of Bs. 200 for a single. Also many classy hotels in Recoleta.

The buffet breakfast is 07:00-10:00. Bs. 270-700. 
Stay safe[edit]
Cars rarely give preference to pedestrians, even at crosswalks. Don't assume they will stop.
Roving gangs of supposed glue sniffers (cleferos) are known to attack and rob people, especially at night. Stay on streets with ample pedestrian traffic. They tend to hang out under the bridges at night and rob people crossing.
The hill of the Coronilla (behind the bus terminal) is particularly not safe because this is where many of them hang around and camp. Generally, anywhere south of Calle Aroma be very cautious.
Robbers also operate from cars, particularly cabs, late at night. Stay alert if one stops right in front of you. Cross the street!
When getting into a cab late at night, it is best to call a radio taxi which you can get from friends, a local family, or the hostal you are staying at. If you cannot call a mobile radio to pick you up, make sure to take a taxi with a company name on the side and remember that company in case anything happens so that you can report it to them. It is best to ask a hotel, restaurant, bar, or discoteca to call a taxi for you.
On the stairs of the hill Cerro de San Pedro have been robberies. The cable car provider uses it as an argument for you to use the cable car (Bs. 6.50). However, during the day it should be fine. At dusk and later, take a taxi or the teleferico (cable cars) to/from the top.
The plain-clothed police officer scam seems to be popular (but seldom) in Cochabamba. Read all about it under Bolivia#Stay safe and be aware.
Connect[edit]
If you have an unlocked phone, you can purchase an inexpensive SIM card from the three major telecoms, Tigo, Viva, Entel and top up as needed. All of have pre-paid data plans. You must register your SIM card with your passport.
There are fewer internet cafés than there were just 3-4 years ago due to the availability of mobile internet. The Punto Entel on the southeast corner of Heroinas and Ayacucho is probably the neatest and best equipped internet spot. The going rate is Bs. 2-3 an hour.
Calls to landlines in Europe and North America can be had as low as Bs. 0.50 a minute. Shop around!
The internet/callshop at Av. Heroinas E0151 (near the corner of Ayacucho) is good for Skype.
Cope[edit]
 Lavaya, Corner of Salamanca and Lanza (A block off Plaza Colon). 08:30-20:00. Same day laundry if you show up at opening time. Bs. 10 per kilo.

A few exchange bureaus at the SW corner of Plaza 14 de Septiembre.
Many street money changers are located near some bridges such as Cala Cala bridge, 25 de mayo and Sucre, and Plaza Colón. You'll get better rates than from banks, but also a little riskier. There are some money exchange businesses around the Plaza that are more reliable. Please note that some money changers on the street won't accept bills smaller than US$100 or will want to give you a less favorable exchange for US$20 or less.
For visa extensions, head to "Migración" located in the north part of Cochabamba at Av. J. Rodriguez between the streets Santa Cruz y Potosí (near Instituto Americano)
Consulates[edit]
The Consulate of Paraguay is located at Calle Ismael Céspedes #007 between Tadeo Haenke and Mejillones, parallel to Avenida Beijing. The phone number is 442-5902, and has been confirmed as of August 2, 2010. Keep in mind that visa applications at this consulate take a week to get filled, because the forms must be sent off to La Paz.

Go next[edit]
Torotoro National Park – Popular with travellers that head to Cochabamba for its dinosaur foot prints, large cave and hiking opportunities. The (mini)buses leave hourly or when full (06:00-18:00, ☏ +591 70786818) from the -17.414131-66.151272 Torotoro Bus "station" in the south of Cochabamba.
Iquique, Chile – There are direct buses, some with a transfer in Oruro. Keep in mind that the border to Chile opens at 08:00. So, it makes little sense to leave at 16:00 from Cochabamba. Waiting time at the border can extend this trip up to 23 hr(!). From Iquique you will have several connections to Santiago.
