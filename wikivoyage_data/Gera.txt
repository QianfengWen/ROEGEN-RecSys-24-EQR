Most connections go to Leipzig, Jena/Weimar/Erfurt, Saalfeld or Chemnitz, where you have access to long-distance traffic. Others serve towns like Altenburg or Greiz; there are sporadic connections to Regensburg or Göttingen.
The tram can be reached directly from the platforms.

Gera has a direct connection to the west-east motorway (Autobahn) A4 (Frankfurt-Dresden), the interchange with the north-south motorway A9 (Berlin-Munich) is approx 15 km east. To reach the City take the exit Gera-Langenberg, which is approx 4 km in the north of the Center.
