Haddington is a market town in  East Lothian, 15 miles east of Edinburgh in central Scotland. It's the administrative centre of East Lothian council area, with a population of 10,360 in 2020. 


Understand[edit]
"Haddington" means the farm where Hada's folk live. The name is Anglo-Saxon not Gaelic, as until the 10th century East Lothian and Edinburgh were ruled by Northumbria. The area is lowland, with well-drained bright red sandstone soil and bedrock, and it's astride the main transport route from England. When it was ceded to Scotland, Haddington became a Royal Burgh and developed as a market town, manufacturing cloth. In 1645 those who worked in the cloth mills were exempted from military service, so hiring became a whole lot easier. However this enterprise foundered in the 18th century and Haddington never became industrial as the villages on the coalfield to the west had long been. That meant its medieval street pattern was preserved, and modern developments have respected this. The town therefore retains a pleasant rural ambience while traffic scurries past just north on the A1.
