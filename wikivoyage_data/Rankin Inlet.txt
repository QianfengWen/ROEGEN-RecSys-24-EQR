Rankin Inlet (Inuktitut: Kangiqiniq or ᑲᖏᕿᓂᖅ, meaning deep bay), is an active community of 2,800 people (2016) in mainland Nunavut. It is a government village and an air transport hub for travel between Nunavut and the centre and west of Canada.


Understand[edit]
The community of Rankin Inlet was formed next to a nickel mine in 1959, which employed most of the town's people. Rankin Inlet is well known for its strong winds in winter. 
The town is the second largest community in Nunavut and before 1999, Rankin was a regional centre for the Northwest Territories government. After the signing of the accord which separated Nunavut from the Northwest Territories, Rankin Inlet became principally a political centre of the territorial claims. It is again growing rapidly and serves as a hub for countless companies and organisations.
With the development of a new gold mine and the opening of a correctional facility, the community is growing fast. Rankin hosts a wide range of recreational facilities like arenas for hockey and curling, a turf baseball diamond, and courts for volleyball, basketball, soccer and badminton. The community also boasts a football ground, an 18-hole golf course and playgrounds for children.
Rankin Inlet does not have any alcohol restrictions and alcohol can be imported for personal use.

Do[edit]
The midnight sun adds a magical element to travel in the Arctic! Rankin Inlet doesn't have 24-hour sunny days, but winter is the time of darkness. Light starts to disappear mid-October and usually does not rise again until Christmas. There are only about four hours of twilight during this time, but the light starts to return in January.
A visit in autumn or winter gives you a chance to see one of Earth's most spectacular phenomena – the Aurora Borealis. They can be easily seen from October to March in the centre of the community, but by taking a walk out of the town, they can be more spectacular. Inuit people have many legends about the auroras, which can be heard by talking to people in Rankin.
A walk five minutes outside the community will give you the opportunity to see terrain which appears untouched by humans. You will most likely discover the siksiit. Spring and summer brings squirrels, which are everywhere, chattering incessantly from their perches, as do peregrine falcons and gyrfalcons. Keep a watchful eye on the area to see loons, geese, swans and cranes, which will keep photographers busy.

62.8812-92.14771 Iqalugaarjuup Nunanga Territorial Park, ☏ +1 867 975-7700, parks@gov.nu.ca. Iqalugaarjuup Nanang Historical Park provides a half day of adventure and is a favourite spot for hiking, fishing and bird watching. The archaeological site of Thule near the Ijiraliq River offers a historical perspective. Although water from the Rankin Inlet valve is treated and safe to drink, many locals use the river as a source of fresh water during the spring and summer. Visitors can plunge into stone age culture while visiting this park and take a glimpse at ancient Inuit Arctic traditions.   (updated May 2020)
62.6833-91.22 Marble Island. Marble Island figures prominently in Inuit traditions and received the special designation of area of exclusive possession in the accord which separated Nunavut from the Northwest Territories. A boat trip to Marble Island located nearby offers a beautiful contrast with the purple flowers of dwarf fireweed growing amongst the rocks. The tombs of the crew of the Knight Expedition from 1921 are still visible on Dead Man Island. At low tide on clear days, one can clearly see the silhouette of the whaling ship, the Orray Taft, which sank near the island in 1893.   
Hockey forms part of the Rankin Inlet community. Rankin is particularly involved since it is the hometown of hockey player Jordin Tootoo (of the NHL Detroit Red Wings). In addition, there are major hockey tournaments held in the community each year. In April the annual Pakallak Time festival is held, offering outdoor games and competitions, dog sled racing and snowmobile racing. May hosts the annual fishing tournament that attracts people from other communities. July 9 is Nunavut Day which is celebrated with pride throughout the territory. In autumn, the community usually hosts the annual trade show for Kivalliq Region inviting companies from all seven communities in the region. 
During the holidays there are organized events, including snow sculptures, games, talent shows, concerts, craft sales, pageants, dog sled races and snowmobiling. Traditional sports like "one foot high kick," "two foot high kick," "arm pull," "knuckle hop", "head sweater", "airplane" and others are still practiced in the community and are presented at many events throughout the year.

Drink[edit]
Bars and other nightlife are practically nonexistent in Nunavut, where alcoholism is a problem for many inhabitants. These restrictions are so strongly applied that the police search the bags of people entering the territory. All alcohol entering dry communities is rapidly confiscated. Rankin Inlet is one of the rare places outside Iqaluit where alcohol can be legally served. Two main bars - and hotels - in Rankin are authorised to sell alcohol within their premises: Siniktarvik Hotel and the Nanuq Inn, whose license is limited to guests.
