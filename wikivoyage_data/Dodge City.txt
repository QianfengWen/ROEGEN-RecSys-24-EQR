Dodge City is a town of 27,000 people (2019) in Western region of Kansas. In and around the city, there are historical sites, museums, and landmarks dedicated to Dodge City's Old West heritage.


Understand[edit]
Front Street
In 1865 Fort Dodge was constructed along the Santa Fe Trail to help protect travelers from Indians. Dodge City was formed near the fort in the years that followed. In the 1870s it exemplified the spirit of the Wild West portrayed in American television and movies, most notably in the American television show Gunsmoke, which was set in Dodge City and popularized the phrase "Get the hell out of Dodge."





Sound like a local
The river that meanders through the southern half of the city is the Arkansas River.  While this river is in Kansas, the name is pronounced Arr-KAN-sas, to match the state name.  Outside of Kansas, the pronunciation changes to Arr-kan-SAW, to match the state of Arkansas.


The town had its heyday during the cattle drives of the late 1800s as quarantines made it one of the few places along the railroad where Texas ranchers could bring their cattle.  This quarantine, created to protect other breeds of cattle from a parasitic tick carried by longhorns, was extended to Dodge City in 1885, essentially ending the town's run as the "Queen of the Cow Towns".  By 1886 the gambling saloons, brothels, and other notorious establishments that had built the town's reputation had mostly closed.  The connection to the cattle trade remained, however, and can be seen in the meatpacking plants and the lines of refrigerated trucks on the highways.
Most of western Kansas has struggled with de-population since the 1970s, but Dodge City was a center of population growth from the 1970s through the 2010s.  It is now a majority–minority community, with nearly two-thirds of the residents being Latino. 

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The most common way of getting to Dodge City is by car, and is a worthwhile stop for anyone road-tripping along the  US-50, which goes from Garden City on the western end of the state, through Dodge City and Emporia, before angling up to Kansas City in the east.
