Cuxhaven is a seaside resort city in Lower Saxony (Niedersachsen), Germany on the mouth of the river Elbe on the North Sea coast. With roughly 3 million booked nights a year, it is one of the largest seaside resorts in Germany.


Understand[edit]

Until 1937, Cuxhaven was part of Hamburg; in a reorganization two towns near Hamburg that were part of Prussia were given to Hamburg in exchange for Cuxhaven. With 48,000 residents (2020), Cuxhaven isn't a very large city.
Tourism is one of the traditional industries in Cuxhaven. The other two are fishing and shipping. The city is trying to expand the harbour and has invested a lot of money in the modernization and expansion of the port facility. Still, the economic situation isn't too good and tourism remains the major industry of the city. Many people have left Cuxhaven in recent decades, and many of those who remain are retired, contributing to the quiet small-town ambiance.
Cuxhaven was not always so quiet, though: about 500 rockets were launched near Cuxhaven between 1945 and 1964. The best known rocket launches which took place in the area of Cuxhaven were three launches of V2 rockets in Operation Backfire, in order to demonstrate Allied forces the technology of the "wonder weapon" V2 in October 1945. That said, the only remnant of this history of rocketry at Cuxhaven is a trough near the road from Arensch to Sahlenburg.

Get in[edit]
Most people come to Cuxhaven either via train or car. Some ferry services exist, but they are negligible, overall.

By car[edit]
Cuxhaven can be reached comfortably by motorway A27 from Bremen in about 1 hour (100 km). From Hamburg  major road B73 (not Autobahn/motorway) takes you to Cuxhaven in about two hours. The B73 is known for motorists with bad driving style and deadly accidents; some extra caution should be employed.

By train[edit]
Cuxhaven railway station
A real alternative to the car, especially when arriving from Hamburg, is a train drive to Cuxhaven. It will take roughly the same time (around 1 hr 45 minutes), but it's more relaxing than using a car. However, the German rail company tends to be more expensive if you travel with several people unless you catch a special deal.
Traveling with weekend special[dead link] (Schönes Wochenende Ticket) or Länder Ticket (Niedersachsen-Ticket) starts at €23/person and the rate gets more favorable when you travel in a group or as a family with children.
When arriving from Bremen, changing the trains in Bremerhaven is unavoidable.

53.8618.703031 Hauptbahnhof Cuxhaven. Cuxhaven's railway station is right in the centre of the city. The bus terminal is in front, and taxis can easily be hired as well. On foot, it should take you about five minutes to get to the Nordersteinstraße shopping area.   
By plane[edit]
53.7683338.6641672 Sea-Airport Cuxhaven/Nordholz (FCN  IATA). This minor airfield with the grandiose name is used militarily as well as for the handful of civilian flights. OFD flies to Heligoland while Yourways flies to Sankt Peter Ording and Sylt.   
The nearest bigger airports are in Hamburg and Bremen.

By boat[edit]

Get around[edit]

There are limited choices when it comes to moving around Cuxhaven. You can walk, bring your own car, take a taxi, or use one of the bus lines. Thankfully, many of the harbor related sights are within easy walking range of the train station.

Do[edit]
Neuwerk Island
Wadden Sea is the area of the sea where the water recedes during low tide. It's one of the main reasons why people visit Cuxhaven. You can take walks, look at crabs, build castles from the sand and the mud, and so on. Be warned that the rising water can be tricky! See the "stay safe" section.
As a non-resident you have to pay "Kurtaxe" (touristic fee) for entering the beach. If you have already been charged for "Kurtaxe" in your accommodation just show your receipt. If you like pay-free beaches you have to travel a few miles to the north and try the coastline of Schleswig-Holstein.
53.8682498.6960161 Stadttheater Cuxhaven, ☏ +49 4721 35656.  
Buy[edit]
The Nordersteinstraße is the primary shopping area of Cuxhaven. It is geared towards the general population and not really too touristy. Prices are rather normal as a result; the downside is that you cannot expect a store to accept credit cards. "EC" bank cards are usually accepted, however.

Eat[edit]
Cuxhaven is a traditional fishing town, so do not leave out some fresh fish or crabs while you are there.

Stay safe[edit]
When enjoying a walk in the Wadden Sea in front of the coast, you must take some simple precautions as the rising waters can be dangerous. If you are far from the beach and the tide surprises you, your life will be in danger.
Always remain within sight of the land, and do not walk out too far. Take care of fog and mist. Enter the area only after high and prior to low tide, and return shortly after low tide, i.e. as soon as the water starts to return and the high tide sets in. Keep a watch with accurate time, and memorize the times of low and high tide. The water does not rise in all places at the same speed. Some areas are lower, and Priele (creek-like arms or canals of water) can well flood very early, cutting you off from land.
You should ask for advice and rules on-location; there are several lifeguard stations and most tourist information places will be able to provide you with basic information as well. Ask for a tidal calendar (German: Tidenkalender).

Go next[edit]
Take a horse carriage to Neuwerk.
Continuing your vacation with a maritime theme, a day trip to Bremerhaven to take a look at the Schiffahrtsmuseum (Museum of sea travel) maybe be worth your time.
For a few days in a quite different environment, take a ferry to Helgoland.
