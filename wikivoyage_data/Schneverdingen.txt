Schneverdingen is a town on the Lüneburg Heath in North Germany.


Understand[edit]
Schneverdingen is a town in the northern part of the district of Soltau-Fallingbostel, in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is about 15 km north of Soltau, and 50 km south of Hamburg.
Schneverdingen belonged to the Prince-Bishopric of Verden, established in 1180. In 1648 the Prince-Bishopric was transformed into the Principality of Verden, which was first ruled in personal union by the Swedish Crown - interrupted by a Danish occupation (1712–1715) - and from 1715 on by the Hanoverian Crown. The Kingdom of Hanover incorporated the Principality in a real union and the Princely territory, including Schneverdingen, became part of the new Stade Region, established in 1823.
The area around Schneverdingen is considerably coined/shaped by ice-age influences and animal husbandry, in particular the Heidschnucken (sheep with horns). From the management of cattle, in connection with the meagre sandy soils, a wide heath landscape was created, which attracts nowadays many tourists. Nevertheless neither the animal husbandry nor the agriculture were productive, With the invention of the mineral fertilizer the agriculture became increasingly more important, unfortunately large surfaces were unaffected,  The 19th century stepped other occupations relating to locally created crafts. Great importance attained finishing of leather for the production of shoes. At the bloom time in Schneverdingen there where over 300 shoemakers, today however due to the structural change in this industry only an enterprise exists.
