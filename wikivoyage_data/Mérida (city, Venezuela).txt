The city has a straight-forward street grid with numbered Calles crossed by numbered Avenidas. The streets do not always have signs, but the city center is easily navigable. Plaza Bolívar, between Avenidas 3/4 and Calles 22/23, is a focal point for the center.
There are busetas going just about everywhere. In the center, many of them stop on Avenida 25 between Calles 2/3.

See[edit]
There are several small Andean towns in the region which are quite scenic and easy to visit, such as Jají, Mucuchies, Apartaderos, and Santo Domingo.

Do[edit]
Teleferico
8.529167-71.0636111 Teleférico. The city's main attraction. It's the world's highest cablecar. For US$25, it will lead you to Pico Espejo (4765m) with two stops on the way. It's best to pick a clear day and go in the morning as early as possible to avoid queues. Many travellers go up on the teleférico, and then descent via mules, hiking and SUVs. This means that during the busy season, upward tickets may be sold out days in advance, but this can be circumvented by reversing the trip. Typically, locals in SUVs will wait in the morning near the base of the teleférico to drive tourists up to Los Nevados for US$15, where mules can be hired for the final ascent. The top is usually covered in clouds later in the day. Take warm clothes. The cable car is frequently closed for maintenance. It stops running in early afternoons.   (updated Dec 2016)

Pico Bolivar
 Pico Bolivar or Pico Humboldt. Climbing these mountains can be organised via through tour agents (see below) for serious mountaineers. A local guide who speaks a little bit of French is José Betancourt [1]. Remember too that the altitude differential between Mérida and the top of the teleferico is huge and that an attempt to climb Pico Bolivar or Pico Humboldt should wait for the next day, least you experience mountain sickness. (updated Dec 2016)

Budget[edit]
Paty's, Calle 24, Ave 8, A good choice for low budget travellers. There is also a laundry service in house. Several of the other posadas listed here are for group parties that sign up for their tours as well, and therefore do not cater to individual backpackers.

Splurge[edit]
Keep in mind that the beds in many hotels (mostly up to the mid-range levels) are nothing more than mattresses on concrete slabs that resemble box springs. Depending on what your sleep preference is, they may not be the most comfortable for you. Something for you to consider when looking for a hotel to stay at.

Connect[edit]
Venezuela's cheapest internet shops can be found in Mérida. There are dozens and cost around US$0.50 per hour or less.

Cope[edit]
Remember to wear your sunscreen and be careful about over-exerting yourself - you're at reasonably high altitudes, and close to the equator.

Go next[edit]
Los Nevados[edit]
A trek you can do on your own is to Los Nevados. Take the teleférico to station Loma Redonda, make sure you don't pay the full amount for the teleférico. From there follow the trail. It's a beautiful 4 to 5 hour walk to Los Nevados. Mules will carry you. In Los Nevados there are several posades where you can sleep, and have dinner and breakfast. The next morning jeeps will leave for Mérida at 9AM. It's a 4½-hour ride along a narrow road.
If you do it the other way around you might save the teleférico entrance and the Inparque tax, but you have to race from Los Nevados to Loma Redonda to catch the last cablecar down. If you want go to Los Nevados call to Abadia Tours Travel & Destinations: Av 3 entre calles 17 y 18 Mérida
An alternative route when the cable car is not running is to start at Mérida and take a jeep to Los Nevados. Jeeps leave at Plaza las Heroinas from 7AM (travel time 4-5 hours). At Los Nevados you can stay at a number of posadas:
Posada Bella Vista - Incredible views from the terrace. Call +58 274 6580146 or +58 274 5113956 for a reservation.
Posada Guamanchi - Excellent food! Go to Guamanchi Tours at Calle 24 to book this posada.
In Los Nevados you can make some beautiful hikes for a couple of hours. Ask the owners of the posadas for information.
The next day, it is possible to walk to the house of Pedro Peña (tel: +58 416 0877510 - only Spanish - call in advance to make sure he is there and has space available). Pedro is the grandson of the first person to reach the top of Pico Bolivar. He has excellent stories and a game of domino always makes for a good night. To get to Pedro's, it is best to rent a guide (and mule). Ask at the posada for arranging this.
The 3rd day, walk down to La Cruz and take a bus back to Mérida (1 hour).

El Paramo[edit]
Explore the cold high plains full of frailejones, lagoons and cold winds.

Aguas Termales del Musui[edit]
Take a bus towards Musui and (with a guide, or at least someone who's been before) hike up to the hot springs.  Bring camping supplies, you'll want to spend at least one night soaking while you watch the stars overhead.

Los Aleros[edit]
Los Aleros is a theme park located in Mérida, Venezuela. It depicts a typical andean town in the 1930s. It was created by Alexis Montilla in 1984. An absolutely breath-takingly beautiful place to visit but beware of creepy ghouls that will jump out of dark corners to scare you. Fun for the whole family.

Montaña de los Sueños[edit]
About a 45 minute drive from downtown Mérida this theme park is all about the old time movies.  There are a lot of classic cars, jukeboxes, movie scenes, and other general 1930-1960 movie, radio, and music memorabilia.  It's a pretty interesting place if you love seeing some of the history of movies in Venezuela.  The cost is around US$15 per adult.  The theme park does not open until later in the day and is best at night.  Telephone: +58 274 262-1557 or +58 274 263-9757

La Mucuy[edit]
Popular picnic destination reasonably close to the city. Bring a lunch and a few bottles, go swimming and commune with nature amongst the throngs of Merideño families on weekends. Catch a bus to Tabay from the center, then take a jeep to La Mucuy. (~1 hr total)
