Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Xicotepec, like most places in Mexico, has a long history with various Mesoamerican societies influencing its growth and culture. It was first settled around 300 B.C. by the Otomi people. In the 5th century A.D., Totonoc people moved into the area. In 1120 it was conquered by the Toltec, in 1325 by the Acolhua, and in 1432 by the Aztec, who forced the town to pay tribute to Texcoco. In 1533, the Spanish moved in with Augustinian friars to convert the population. They built the first churches in town and declared San Juan Bautista (St. John the Baptist) to be the town's patron saint.
The town's 15 minutes of fame was actually 3 days in 1920, when, following the Mexican Revolution, President Venustiano Carranzo was assassinated in a nearby town and his body was taken to Xicotepec. During those 3 days, the official capital of Mexico was this small town. The story is told in exhibits at the Casa Carranza.

Geography[edit]
Rio San Marcos
Xicotepec is a mountainous town, lying within an area known as the Sierra Norte. The San Marcos River lies a few kilometers north of the town while the Necaxa River lies a few kilometers to the south. Both rivers are quite scenic and offer recreational opportunities for paddlers as well as some popular waterfalls. Springs within the town (called los Tezontles) feed several small streams. Several more streams are found in the hills and mountains surrounding the town and flowing into one of the two nearby rivers.

Climate[edit]
Xicotepec gets quite a bit of rain with rainfalls occurring regularly throughout the year, but the heaviest rains fall between June and October. Conditions change quickly in Xicotepec, with showers appearing and disappearing in an instant.

Mural in the Museo Casa Carranza
Monument to the Virgin of Guadalupe
20.27671-97.9588591 Museo Casa Carranza, Plaza de la Constitución S/N, Col Centro, ☏ +52 764-764-2419. 10:00 - 18:00 (Tu-Su), closed M. This historical museum is a must for those interested in the Mexican Revolution and its after-effects. Following the Revolution, power struggles seemed to never end. President Venustiano Carranza was assassinated in the nearby town of Tlaxcalantongo and his body taken to Xicotepec. For three tense days he lay in this house, where he was autopsied and political machinations carried out. The museum's exhibits tell the story of Carranza's life, political struggles, the Mexican Revolution and its aftermath. Free. 
20.27671-97.958152 Zocalo. Xicotepec's main square takes up about 2 square city blocks and is filled with more flowers than just about any town zocalo you've ever seen. There's also some impressive topiary and lots of park benches for sitting, sipping coffee from the sidewalk vendors, and doing serious people watching, especially Sunday when all the families are out walking and browsing through the tianguis (since Sunday is also market day in Xicotepec.) This is where you'll find the big colorful letters spelling out the town's name. A popular selfie spot. 
20.290499-97.9487693 Cruz Celestial (Heavenly Cross), Camino Rural Nactanca S/N. 06:00 - 18:00. Scenic overlook with a cross at the top of a hill. Popular place for photographers and selfie-takers. Great place to get some exercise since it's a bit of a hike from the main road along a dirt road, then you climb 746 steps to get to the cross. Best in the morning before temperatures get too hot. Bring water and snacks, though vendors are often in the parking lot. Free. 
20.287549-97.9545414 Monument to the Virgen of Guadalupe, Colonia Tabacal (north side of town, just off Blvd. Benito Juarez (MEX 130)). 24 hours. Enormous statue of the Virgin Mary. Great photo ops, plus access to the trails up to the Heavenly Cross. Parking is available here and vendors sell food and drink. Free. (updated Aug 2023)
20.276031-97.9583815 Parroquia San Juan Bautista, Iturbide 4, Col Centro. 05:00 - 22:00. The parish has a history dating back to its founding in 1571 by the Augustinian friars, but the church itself is shockingly modern and austere. In 1943, the parish priest had the original church demolished because it was getting run down and difficult to maintain. The new church lacks any of the character of colonial-era churches and has far fewer icons, paintings or sculptures than typical Mexican churches. It was designed in a gothic style and was patterned after the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris (though obviously on a much smaller scale). (updated Aug 2023)
20.276836-97.955876 Xochipila, Porfirio Díaz 118, Col Centro. Mystical place that was a ceremonial center in the pre-Hispanic era (probably built around the 12th century) and that is still used by indigenous shamans for purification rituals around June 23 each year. The place was used to worship Xochipilli (god of the sun, music, or flowers, depending on which pre-Hispanic culture you believe). Supposedly, the site was preserved through the colonial era due to locals convincing the Augustinians that they were worshiping the fish symbol that was part of the Catholic playbook, and certainly not any pre-Hispanic symbols, like the quetzal that actually was the symbol locals bowed down to. The site is maintained as an urban park by the State of Puebla. Free. (updated Aug 2023)

The building looks like a windmill and the dining room is in and around an odd local museum of objects from the early 20th century as well as collections of plants, bugs, and geology. The food is almost secondary to the spectacle. Menu is traditional Mexican with sopas, enchiladas, and carnes asadas. M$250. (updated Aug 2023)
