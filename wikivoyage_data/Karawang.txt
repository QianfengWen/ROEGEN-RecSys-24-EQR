The village of Balongsari is about 8 km north of Karawang. This village was once known as Rawagede, and this is the location of the Rawagede Massacre that was committed by Royal Netherlands East Indies Army during the Indonesian War of Independence, on 9 December 1947. Almost all of the males of the village, amounting to 431 men according to most estimates, were killed. A court ruling in the Netherlands in 2011 decided that the Dutch state is fully responsible for the massacre, which was already called "deliberate and merciless" in a United Nations report in 1948.
