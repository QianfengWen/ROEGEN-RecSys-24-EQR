Kirkcaldy is a town on the coast of Fife in central Scotland. Its called "The Lang Toun" due to the collection of villages that stretched along the coast. It's industrial, making linoleum, and in 2016 had a population of 50,010. Famous people from Kirkcaldy include the economist Adam Smith, the British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and the crime fiction writer Val McDermid.


Understand[edit]
Free market forces: Adam Smith £20s are a "Sell", JMW Turners are a "Buy"
In 1723 Kirkcaldy was the birthplace of Adam Smith, founder of the science of economics and author of "Wealth of Nations". He's particularly associated with the laissez-faire or liberal-classical strand of economics, holding that the greatest wealth is created by the free operation of the "invisible hand" of market forces. He was also well aware of the destructive and corrupting effects of those forces, and this dichotomy is why his theories and legacy are debated to this day. For example, market forces dictate that unsuccessful businesses must fail, but what if that failure takes down a bank, railway company, energy supplier, hospital, college or city? But if we can agree upon one economic lesson from Smith it is this: if you have a £20 note bearing his likeness, then you're left holding the Old Maid, it's no longer legal tender. You need to change it at a bank for a £20 depicting JMW Turner, the current issue.
Smith's work chimed well with the 18th / 19th century industrialists who developed Kirkcaldy into a large port. Commerce was driven by the Fife coalfields, salt panning, whaling and linen. Flax was also spun into coarse floor-cloths (cheaper than carpet) that protected floors and cut out draughts, and techniques were devised to spray oil or resin onto a canvas backing, creating linoleum. This turned into a big seller, as it was durable, washable, inexpensive, and could be brightly patterned and cut to precise size. By 1877 Kirkcaldy was the world's largest manufacturer of lino, with half a dozen factories and a distinctive oily pong across town. This industry declined from 1960 with foreign competition but continues in town, other manufacturing arrived, and the port re-opened in 2011 when it was equipped to handle container freight.

See[edit]
Old Kirk is on Kirk Wynd a block north of the shopping centre. Its western tower from around 1500 is the town's oldest building, though most of it is early 19th century. It ceased to be used as church in 2008 and is now a performance and event space.

56.1098-3.162411 Kirkcaldy Town House  is the council offices, built in 1956 as a sort-of Nordic, sort-of neo-Classical low rise. The main entrance is west off pedestrianised Wemyssfield.
56.12-3.1412 Ravenscraig Castle is the ruin of a castle built in 1460 at a time when gunpowder and artillery were getting the better of early medieval castles; so it was built to withstand cannon shot and to be an artillery platform itself. It was also to be a comfortable residence for the wife of James II, but he'd no sooner planned it when he got blown up by one of his own cannon. ("It's people that kill, not cannon!" so no legislation was passed.) The castle ceased to be a residence after Cromwell wrecked it but, in an appropriate coda, it was used as an ammunition depot in the First World War. The ruin is free to stroll any time.
Ravenscraig Park is the woodland east from the castle to Dysart. The large car park is reached by ignoring Satnav, which is trying to take you to brownfield Ravenscraig near Motherwell.
56.123-3.1243 Dysart is a small harbour that fell on hard times once the pit closed and coal shipping ceased. The village was then merged into Kirkcaldy and much of it swept away for bland housing estates, but a historic core around the harbour has been preserved. See the Tolbooth, Town Hall, Pan Ha' (cottages by the salt pans), St Serf's church tower of 1500, and Dysart House. The Carmelite Monastery just north is still active, but in a modern building. Don't go searching for Dysart Castle, as that's near Thomastown in Ireland, and according to its famous resident Bishop Berkeley, it may not even exist if no-one happens to be looking at it.
