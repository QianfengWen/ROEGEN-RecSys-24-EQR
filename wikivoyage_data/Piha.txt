North Piha Beach is north of Lion Rock and is a long, wild beach filled with numerous tidal rips and holes. As with the more popular Piha Beach, swim only where the surf club recommends.
Piha Beach (or South Piha Beach) is New Zealand's premier surf beach. Its black iron sand, pounding surf and rugged natural beauty are a favourite with local, national and international surfing communities. It has strong tidal rips, so follow the directions of the surf life saving club, which often places flags on the beach to indicate where it is safe to swim. If you are a novice to intermediate strength swimmer, it is recommended that you do not swim if surf life saving guards are not on patrol.
