Irvine is a city of 308,000 people (2020) in Orange County, California. Irvine is one of the newest and largest cities in Orange County, and it is still growing. The city is a perfectly planned suburbia. The Irvine Company started developing the area in the 1960s and the city was formally incorporated on December 28, 1971.


Understand[edit]
Irvine was incorporated on December 28, 1971, Most of the growth in Irvine was sparked by the donation of a large parcel of land to the University of California system in order to establish the 4th largest UC Campus (in terms of attendance) - UC Irvine.
The city is becoming the de facto business center of Orange County with many national and international companies having a presence in Irvine. Most of Irvine bordering Newport Beach (and the airport) and the areas surrounding any freeways are commercial areas where most of the larger companies have their offices.
The arterial streets are very wide and have very generous speed limits. Most residential areas are off the arterial streets on smaller two-lane residential streets that lead to housing communities.

Get in[edit]
By air[edit]
John Wayne/Orange County Airport (SNA) is practically located between Santa Ana and Irvine, NE of the intersection of Hwy 55 & I-405. Alternatively, Los Angeles International Airport (LAX IATA) is about an hour's drive away without traffic via freeway 405, or Long Beach Airport (LGB IATA) about 30 minutes away, also via 405.
By train[edit]
 Metrolink, ☏ +1-800-371-5465. Runs commuter trains to/from downtown Los Angeles and San Bernardino via its Orange County and Inland Empire routes. Most trains continue to Laguna Niguel/Mission Viejo, and a few trains go as far as Oceanside in San Diego County. Depending on your intended destination, the 33.707938-117.805991 Tustin station  may be closer than the 33.656802-117.7334682 Irvine Transportation Center . (updated Feb 2020)
 Amtrak, ☏ +11-800-872-7245. Pacific Surfliner trains also serve the Irvine Transportation Center (but not Tustin). Trains run between San Luis Obispo and San Diego via Los Angeles, and are more frequent than Metrolink on weekends. (updated Feb 2020)
Most buses serving the Irvine and Tustin train stations run only during peak commute hours on weekdays.

By car[edit]
Irvine is at the intersection of the 5 and 405 freeways.  One does have to consider, though, that these freeways have a significant amount of traffic and may be slow during rush hour. If you are traveling northbound from San Diego and wish to avoid traffic, consider using State Route 73, which splits off from Interstate 5 in Laguna Niguel. It is a toll road.
The 55 state freeway may be used to get to destinations in the northwest of Irvine; north of the 55 is Santa Ana.

By bus[edit]

Get around[edit]
Map of Irvine
By car[edit]
As in all suburbs, it is extremely difficult to get around without a car. Rental cars are available near John Wayne Airport.
Irvine is known for its winding streets that do not follow the traditional grid pattern most urban drivers are used to. It is extremely easy to become disoriented and lost if you are unfamiliar with the area. Bring a GPS or a map if you are new to the area. In the various housing tracts, if you follow the double yellow lines it will always lead you to an exit or through fare to a major street.
Since Irvine is bounded on all sides by freeways, most of the arterial streets (which tend to be at least 4 lanes in either direction) will eventually lead to a freeway, but it may be many miles before this happens.
Gas stations are unusually rare for a city this large and are not usually visible from the street. If you are in need of gas in Irvine, your best chances are to look in large shopping plazas where a gas station is usually hidden. Hiding the gas stations are a 'sign of upscale gentrification' in this city where household incomes rank as one of the highest in the nation.
Most of the major roads in Irvine have a bike path near the shoulder. Watch out for cyclists using the bike paths.
By bus[edit]
The Orange County Transit Authority (OCTA) provides local bus transport in Irvine and surrounding cities.
By bike[edit]
Irvine is a large city, covering about 66 square miles (170 km2), but is very friendly to bicyclists. There are over 45 miles of off-road bicycle trails and 282 miles of on-road bicycle lanes provided in Irvine. It is possible to transit from north to south in Irvine via tree shaded greenbelt bike trails with only two grade level crossings of highways. Other trails lead into the nearby hills for road touring or mountain biking experiences. Some paths parallel wildlife corridors and riders can often get glimpses of some of the wildlife native to the area - ranging from birds (sparrows to hawks), to opossums and skunks, and coyotes to mountain lions. City of Irvine Bikeways.
There are numerous bicyclist clubs in Irvine and weekend mornings are a favorite time for street touring by groups sometimes numbering in the dozens. Buses and trains carry bicycles when riders are traveling longer distances.
