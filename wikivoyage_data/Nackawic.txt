History[edit]
The Big Ax
The area was settled in 1784 by the United Empire Loyalists, primarily through land grants to the families of soldiers who had fought with His Majesty's Regiment of Queen's Rangers during the American Revolutionary War.
Previously known as Otis, development began in the late 1960s. It was built to provide homes for people forced to relocate as the result of the construction of the Mactaquac Dam. A pulp mill between 1967 and 1970 was built to employ these displaced persons who lost their traditional farming opportunities that came with the dam.
