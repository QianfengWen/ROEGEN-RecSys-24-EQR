Vladivostok[dead link] (Russian: Владивосто́к, vlah-dee-vah-STOHK) is the eastern terminus of the Trans-Siberian Railway, Russia's largest port to the Pacific Ocean, and the base for the Pacific Fleet. With 600,000 inhabitants, it is the second-largest city in the Russian Far East, after Khabarovsk.


Understand[edit]
Center of Vladivostok and Golden Horn Bay




San Francisco and Naples
Fritiof Nansen, the Arctic explorer, described the city of Vladivostok thus: "It reminds me of Naples by its location on terraces. Although there is no Vesuvius the city has a beautiful harbor and islands."
Later on, these hills enticed Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev to call for making Vladivostok into a Soviet San Francisco. The words were catchy but not historically new, since they had already been said in the 1930s. Still, the shadow of San Francisco is hovering over the city's hilly streets.


The area that is now Vladivostok was historically part of the traditional homeland of the Manchus, who would conquer China in the 17th century and establish the Qing Dynasty. It was ceded to Russia in the 1858 Treaty of Aigun, one of the many unequal treaties that China was forced to signed with Western colonial powers in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Surrounded by Amursky Gulf from the west, Ussuriysky Gulf from the east, and Golden Horn Bay along the south, Vladivostok is the home of the Russian Pacific Fleet. The city is separated from its southernmost part, Russkiy Island, by the Eastern Bosphorus strait; there are a couple of smaller sparsely populated islands, Reineke and Popov.
From its foundation in 1860, as a naval base, the city received the status of free port, that boosted international commerce and development. The October Revolution brought Japanese, American, French and Czechoslovak armies who sided with the Whites. From 1958 to 1992, Vladivostok was off-limits to foreigners; it was finally re-opened for tourism after the fall of the Soviet Union. The city centre, at the edge of the water, has sweeping boulevards of ornate, century-old buildings; magnificent, decaying, and in dire need of a scrub. Further out, on the steep hills overlooking the bay, similarly decaying Soviet blocks dotted with new high-rise buildings provide accommodations for most of the city's residents.
There are beautiful oak woods surrounding the city, which along with Nakhodka, could be a starting point for weekend bus-tours to the winter ski-slopes, or waterfalls in summer. A few lotus lakes are an attraction for campers and forest lodgers when the flowers are blossoming in August.

Climate[edit]
Vladivostok is at the same latitude with Russian subtropical sea resort of Sochi, but its average annual temperature is nearly 10 degrees lower due to the Siberian High that brings cold winds from Yakutia for much of the winter. Thus the winter is typical for Manchuria: cold, clear and very windy. The snow is scarce and in some years may not fall at all.

Average max. and min. temperatures in °F
Precipitation+Snow totals in inches



January is cold at -14°C (7°F), and August is fairly warm at 24°C (75°F), though these are average temperatures, and hot/cold spells can bring much more extreme conditions. It is not unheard of for temperatures to drop below -30°C in February, and similarly August can be over 30°, but in general August and September bring the most sunny and pleasant temperatures. The end of summer, however, could bring Pacific monsoons that last for a few days in a row.

Get in[edit]
See Russia#Get in for visa requirements to Russia.

By train[edit]
Vladivostok railway station. Rebuilt in 1912 in the same style as Yaroslavsky railway station in Moscow 9288 km away
See also: Trans-Siberian Railway
Tickets for the Trans-Siberian Railway sell out and it is best to buy tickets well in advance. Tickets are sold by the operator as well as via agencies and resellers.
The main line of the Trans-Siberian Railway runs between Moscow and Vladivostok. Major stops from Vladivostok include Ulan Ude (62-67 hours), Irkutsk (81 hours), Krasnoyarsk (99 hours), Novosibirsk (113 hours), Omsk (121 hours), Yekaterinburg (134 hours), Nizhni Novgorod (5 days), and Moscow (6 days).

By boat[edit]
If you enter Russia by boat, you can stay for 72 hours without a Russian visa. For more information, see Russia#Get_in.
The ferry port in Vladivostok is right next to the train station.

To/from Korea and Japan[edit]
Business Intour Service[dead link] is the official booking agent for ferries operated by The Far Eastern Shipping Company (FESCO) between Vladivostok and the Fushiki port in Takaoka, Japan. The trip  costs ¥48,400 including meals (alcohol costs are additional). The ships do not have many working amenities. Ferries both ways leave on Friday evening and arrive two days later on Sunday morning. You'll need to arrive at the port a few hours early for immigration procedures.
The Eastern Dream boat of the DBS Ferry Company[dead link] operates service to/from Donghae, South Korea (US$180+) and Sakai Minato, Japan (US$220+). From March to November the ferry  leaves Sakai Minato on Saturdays, briefly stops in Donghae on Sundays and arrives in Vladivostok on Mondays. In the winter, the ferry lays over in Donghae until Monday and arrives in Vladivostok on Tuesday. The nearest major city to Sakai Minato is Kyoto, 3 hours by train. (Update: DBS got bought by a Korean company, here's the website with the prices: http://dwship.co.kr/en/passenger/passenger.asp)
There is also a ferry service connecting Vladivostok and Sokcho, South Korea. It costs about US$200 and takes two days. One ship leaves Sokcho each week, on Thursday, although they become more frequent in the summer months (June-August).

By cargo boat[edit]
It is also possible to travel to/from anywhere in the world by booking a berth on a cargo boat. Usual caveats of freighter travel apply, though (it's definitely not for a casual tourist), and one need to keep in mind that Russian border and customs officials aren't used to people traveling this way.

By plane[edit]
43.399167132.1513891 Vladivostok International Airport (VVO  IATA) (is 40km northeast of Vladivostok, near Artyom). It is the largest airport in the Russian Far East and serves over 1.5 million passengers per year. Flights to/from Vladivostok are to other Russian cities or cities in Korea, China, or Japan. Flights to other Russian cities are relatively cheap, although flights to Japan and Korea are relatively expensive.   
To travel between the airport and the city:

Bus 107 operates between the airport and the Vladivostok bus station (just in front of the Vladivostok train station), with departures at: 08:25, 09:40, 10:45, 12:07, 13:00, 14:00, 15:50, 16:50, 17:45, and 20:00. It costs 220 руб plus 100 руб per luggage. On the way back to the airport, bus 107 leaves from the Vladivostok bus station at 06:40, 07:10, 08:20, 09:00, 10:20, 11:20, 12:20, 13:20, 14:30, 15:30, 16:20, and 17:20. See up-to-date schedule at https://www.vl.ru/transport/bus/vladivostok/airport[dead link]. It takes about 50 minutes in low traffic.
Trains[dead link] operate between the airport and the city, although service is not very frequent. Tickets to the city center cost 70-350 руб.
Primavtolayn is the official taxi company operating from the airport. There're also many private taxis which you can hail. Negotiate a price in advance; you should usually get to the city center for around 1500 руб.
Yandex.taxi between the airport and the city usually costs around 1200 руб.
By bus[edit]
Bus tickets can be bought at the bus station in Vladivostok or from ticket agencies. Buses operate to/from most suburban locations and nearby towns. International routes link Vladivostok to cities in Northeastern China such as Suifenhe (3500 руб) and Yanji 2800 руб, terminating in the Vtoraya Rechka neighborhood in the evening.
It takes about 5 hours to get to Vladivostok from the Chinese border, and the road goes through one of the most picturesque areas of the Russian Far East.

By car[edit]
Vladivostok is not only the eastern end of the Trans-Siberian railway, but of the Trans-Siberian Highway as well. The ferry from the South Korea and Japan seem to carry cars and motorcycles[dead link], although they are not roll on-roll off ships, like ferries in Europe, and there is some bureaucracy involved transporting cars from one country to another. You can get in from China by road as well, for example via the Suifenhe border crossing.

By public transport[edit]
Vladivostok has a wide range of transportation, from streetcars to a funicular railway. The trams and trolleybuses, unfortunately, are mostly gone in an effort to improve traffic: this hasn't worked, mainly because at least two lanes on most streets are still taken for unregulated parking. However there is talk of reinstating at least some trolleybus routes, and lengthening the network to include some suburban destinations. While the mayor pays some lip service to reinstating trams, too, his actions prove otherwise.
By far the most common is the bus, both large route buses (mainly used Korean ones, some could be seen still carrying Seoul or Busan route plaques) and marshrutka shared taxis (which generally follow bus routes). Buses are extremely crowded but frequent; the fares are flat 28 руб for the downtown routes, but go up to 120 руб for suburban ones. Hop on bus in the back and then pay the driver as you exit from the front. Many buses leave from outside the "Clever House" (Cløver House) Department store or the city's train station. Another major bus hubs are the Lugovaya square at the mouth of the Golden Horn bay and the intercity bus station ("Автовокзал") in the Vtoraya Rechka neighborhood.

On the down note, the bus companies are constantly criticized for neglecting the state of their fleets, running the buses well past their service lives, unduly economizing on cleaning and personnel (they tend to hire recent immigrants, who can be paid as little as possible), and creating the competition for the passengers' fare among the drivers, which leads to long delays on stops and reckless driving.
The city has reinstated the municipal bus company with newer buses and better controlled drivers. All municipal buses are equipped with electronic payment system and trackers, as the city also pushes to equip all the buses with the tracking hardware. The positions and waiting time for the equipped buses could be seen at the Bus 125 website, and major stops are gradually being equipped with electronic timetables.
Access to the outlying areas is generally best done by bus or suburban commuter train elektrichka. The train station is accessible and a great way to see neighbouring cities such as Khabarovsk. The Russian Far East is an enormous and rather sparsely populated territory, so if the closer towns like Ussuriysk and Nakhodka may be just a couple of hours away, Khabarovsk is in a different province altogether, about 700 km from Vladivostok, and takes almost a whole day to reach, so plan accordingly: this is definitely not a quick day trip.
Also pay the close attention to the elektrichka timetables. The train companies have radically revised their networks and frequencies, removing a lot of the unprofitable commuter trains (these are supposed to be subsidised by the local authorities, but those are chronically lacking the funds) from schedules, so if you get to some out-of-the-way location by the commuter train, you may get stranded for several hours until the next one.

By taxi[edit]
There are a number of taxi companies, and hailing one is easy. There is no meter because most companies and freelance drivers charge a flat rate of 300 руб for one hour. The rate is usually negotiable but not below 150 руб per hour. Expect to pay at least this much for a single journey over a short distance. The advent of app-based taxis has driven the prices even lower, so you can expect ~100 руб per kilometer, unless there's a high demand, in which case the cost may rise about twofold.

By car[edit]
Although it is the main port of used Japanese car imports in Russia, the century-old streets of Vladivostok are ill suited to heavy traffic. They are usually filled to capacity and traffic jams are common, especially in rush hours. The local driving style is also rather aggressive; and speeding, cutting off, tailgating and ignoring recently changed traffic lights are widespread. Despite this, car horns are rarely heard, largely because the undue leaning on the horn is an actual traffic offence in Russia, and can lead to the pretty hefty fines.

By foot[edit]
Funicular in Vladivostok leading to the Eagle's Nest hill
The city centre is only a short walk from the train station, and most of the sights can be reached easily on foot. Aleutskaya St runs north/south, passing the train station; head north to Svetlanskaya St, which is the main east/west road for the city.
As much of Vladivostok is situated on steep hills, walking can be physically demanding. The ice and wind in winter and the conditions of the pavements mostly preclude bicycle use.
However, MTB and weekend bike tours are very popular among the people for there is quite a lot of scenic places hard-to-reach by vehicles but still worth the effort. The most attractive destinations range the closest islands and the coastline even when the ice covers the bays.

See[edit]
Arsenev Regional History Museum
If you've arrived in Vladivostok on the Trans-Siberian, at the end of a trip that began in Moscow, head straight for Sportivnaya Harbor. The still waters of the sea will likely provide sweet relief after several days on the train. However, if you're fresh off a ferry from Japan or Korea, head up to Svetlanskaya and Ploschad Bortsov Revolutsy for a stroll to get your land legs back. (Both destinations usually have food and drink vendors.)
Civil engineering buffs can gawk at the numerous construction marvels peppering the city streets since the 2012 APEC Summit, including the two enormous bridges across the Golden Horn Bay and Eastern Bosporus strait (the Russian Navy officers first exploring the area were big fans of Istanbul harbour), the latter of which is the largest cable-stayed bridge in the world. Locals are more ambivalent about all that construction, but the bridges and hotels nevertheless already have become a frequent visitor attractions, and the Golden Horn one is greatly praised by the locals, as it radically relieved the permanently congested Lugovaya square, taking about half of its traffic.

Public spaces[edit]
Russia's Pacific Fleet (not all of it, just its destroyer squadron) is moored in Golden Horn Bay. A walk along the waterfront on Korabelnaya Embankment offers the closest views; to get any closer, you will have to enlist. Photographs with an average-sized camera shouldn't attract any problems, but be mindful of your surroundings or an enterprising police officer might invent a fine for you to pay.

43.117059131.8815631 Ploschad Bortsov Revolutsy (Central Square), Svetlanskaya, between Aleutskaya and Uborevicha. This is a good place to relax and watch the locals at leisure. A pair of massive statues serve as the Memorial to the Fighters for the Soviet Power in the Far East, in honor of those who brought this remote corner of Russia under Bolshevik control. Today, they're more a memorial to the power of local skateboarders. You might also have the chance to take in a protest march. The giant, strikingly ugly regional administration building looms over the square. 
43.118836131.8755272 Sportivnaya Harbor. A popular summertime promenade and beach just the short walk away from the square. The official swimming ban is cheerfully ignored by the locals, who frolic in the water between the yachts of the main city marina, which mostly shares the location with the beach. A small amusement park with various kiddy rides and 80 m Ferris wheel lines the other side of the promenade, and the stalls around will sell you drinks, snacks and souvenirs for outrageous prices. 
43.11875131.8801943 The square of the sister-cities (Площадь побратимов) (Crossroads of Semenovskaya and Pogranichnaya streets). Eleven arcs with cities' names engraved on them. Benches to relax. Free Wi-Fi zone. 
Dynamo stadium, the home arena of the city's eternally struggling Luch-Energia football outfit, as well as Olympiets sports center, a base of Spartak-Primorye basketball team and a popular venue for martial arts tournaments, are also situated there, as is the old city aquarium. The new, much larger and fancier one, is under construction on Russkiy island. In the winter the frozen waters of the bay become a home for hundreds, if not thousands, ice fishers (or "penguins" in local parlance), some of which even drive their cars to the ice.
Museums and memorials[edit]

70.7828.4508338 C-56 Submarine, Korabelnaya nab. You can't board the Pacific Fleet, but this WWII submarine is parked on land, by the Naval Memorial, and welcomes visitors; the interior is pretty well-preserved, and you can monkey around more or less unattended while you're inside. There's usually someone selling Soviet pins and military gear outside.   
43.114009131.8918429 Triumphal Arc (Nikolai gate) (Deep into the eastern side of Korabelnaya nab). Chapel-like arc constructed in honour of the visiting tsar Nikolai II, destroyed after the revolution and restored in 2003.  
43.111242131.8819142 Vladivostok Station, Aleutskaya St. Even if your journey doesn't involve trains, the beautiful old Vladivostok Station is worth a look. The last among the steam-engines stands at the platform. Don't miss the 9288km sign post nearby  
43.073174131.8431510 Lighthouse at Egersheld cape (Маяк на Эгершельде). This white lighthouse on the edge of a spit was built in 1910 and could be seen to every one who gets back from sea travels.

Do[edit]
If you'd like to swim, the beach at Sportivnaya Harbor is the place to do it (not Golden Horn Bay, where the Pacific Fleet is parked). Be sure to salute the half-submerged mermaid statue out in the water - when they finally fish it out of the water, that is, the statue was driven off its foundation by the shifting ice and sunk several years ago. Alternately, in the winter, locals aren't shy about strolling out on ice.

Sleep[edit]
Dorms[edit]
Russian dorm rooms in Vladivostok range from awful to OK. Generally, foreigners are dormed in reasonable accommodations, but you should know exactly what you are getting into before arriving. Important things you might take for granted include: private or communal kitchen and bathrooms, number of roommates, number of clothing washers and dryers.
The Far Eastern National University (above) offers reasonable dorm rooms but foreigners are separated from Russian students, so if you are looking for more Russian immersion, ask them about arranging a home stay.

Stay safe[edit]
A few roads can only be crossed by poorly-lit underground passageways, which can be a bit nerve-wracking at night. Beggars tend to congregate near the doors, including children with very quick hands, so cover your pockets as you pass.
Although you'll see plenty of locals stripping down for a swim on the boardwalks off Naberezhnaya, take care; there is plenty of rusted metal about. Stick to the beach unless you're very confident in your tetanus shots.

Connect[edit]
The main post office is on the other side of Aleutskaya from the train station. Internet access is available on the first floor of the post office. There are a few Internet cafes in the town center.
ATMs are easy to find, and most are connected to international bank networks. Otherwise, many hotels have exchange desks, although some have exchange rates decidedly skewed in their favor. Banks are the most obvious choice for currency exchange. There will also be dodgy money-changers near Sportivnyaya Harbor.

Phones[edit]
Mobile operators are the same as anywhere in Russia: MTS (МТС) and Megaphon (Мегафон). Local NTK (НТК) will automatically switch your Beeline (Билайн) phone to roaming service.
Buying a SIM card needs a passport in Russia.
Refilling locations are QIWI terminals or salons of mobiles: Evroset (Евросеть), Svyaznoy (Связной) and Sotoviy mir (Сотовый мир).

Go next[edit]
The Trans-Siberian Railway will be the means of exit by most, either heading west towards Moscow or into China. The next major stop is the Russian city of Khabarovsk, some 700 km (435 mi) off. Smaller Ussuriysk may be an interesting city  for eager traveller as well as a connection point to China. As a side trip visit Nakhodka.
North Korea's airline Air Koryo offers flights to Pyongyang.
