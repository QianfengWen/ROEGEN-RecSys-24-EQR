Kilwinning is a town near the Ayrshire coast of Scotland, some 21 miles southwest of Glasgow. It's run-down and post-industrial, with a population in 2020 of 16,100. 


Understand[edit]
The "Kil-" placename indicates the cell or abode of an early Christian saint - presumably Saint Winning but no-one knows who he was. (He may be the same fellow as St Ninian, St Finnian, and for all we know St Trinian.) An abbey was founded in the 12th century on the west bank of the River Garnock, with the village of Sagtown ("saint town") on the east bank. It was a small market town until the 19th century, when iron foundries were established powered by locally-mined coal; these were west bank and the town centre migrated there. An even greater expansion came in the 1960s when a series of "New Towns" were developed to remedy Scotland's poor stock of housing. Four of these were greenfield but the fifth was grafted onto the existing town of  Irvine five miles south. Kilwinning was effectively a suburb of this ugly project, but in 1996 the New Town system was wound up and Kilwinning reverted to conventional local governance within North Ayrshire Council.

See[edit]
Abbey ruins and 19th century tower
55.6537-4.69911 Kilwinning Abbey, 109 Main St KA13 6AW. Heritage Centre Sa Su 1-3PM. Scrappy remains of a Tironensian Benedictine monastery, founded late 12th century by monks from Kelso. It fell into ruin at the 16th-century Reformation and much of its stone was carried off for use elsewhere. One of its west towers survived until 1814, when it was demolished just before it collapsed: a replacement was completed in 1816. This houses the Heritage Centre, open summer weekends, where exhibits include the town's ancient archery club. The ruins are free to stroll any time. Free.   (updated Sep 2022)
Freemason's Lodge or "Lodge Mother Kilwinning" may be the oldest Masonic Lodge in Scotland, if not the world. It claims to have been founded in 1140 by the masons from Italy who built the abbey, but no records survive to validate this. As the Mother Lodge or "Lodge Nothing" (never "zero") it granted charters to daughter lodges, but in 1736 the Grand Lodge of Scotland was formed and Kilwinning's priority wasn't accepted. It seceded rather than be one constituent lodge among many, granting its own charters, until a reconciliation in 1807. The present Lodge building, next to the abbey at 99 Main St, was completed in 1893. It's only open to visit by arrangement with the Master.
55.6418-4.671642 Eglinton Country Park, Kilwinning KA13 7QD. Pleasant green space along the riverside, with the ruined facade of Eglington Castle, a Gothic confection of 1800. In 1839 a huge lavish "medieval" tournament was staged here, but the summer rains laid waste to the marquees, knights in armour, and celebrity guests including the future Emperor Napoleon III of France. The castle was simply unaffordable and went to ruin in 1925. Most of it was demolished when the grounds became a civic park in the 1970s. Free.   (updated Sep 2022)
55.6761-4.71043 Museum of Ayrshire Country Life (Dalgarven Mill), Dalgarven KA13 6PL, ☏ +44 1294 552448. Tu-Sa 10AM-4PM, Su 11AM-4PM. Breastshot watermill built in 1614 to thresh local grain, or else! Until 1779 the Law of Thirlage required farmers to bring their grain to the local Laird's mill, a nice little monopoly, and it was the law's repeal as much as the advent of steam that brought about the demise of many mills. Dalgarven however was rebuilt in the 1880s after fire damage, and restored in the 1980s to become a museum of Ayrshire farming. Adult £7.50, child £5.   (updated Sep 2022)

Shoot the papingo on the first Saturday in June. Kilwinning Archery Club is believed to have existed at least since 1483: it became defunct in 1870 but was revived in 1948. The papingo or popinjay is a wooden bird mounted high on the Abbey tower, and archers attempt to hit it. Step smartly under cover before the arrow hurtles back down.
