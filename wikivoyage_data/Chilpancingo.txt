Masks for Pendón
Paseo del Pendón  - Sunday before Christmas, since 1825 this festival has filled the streets of Chilpancingo with dance, music, and masks. Over 1,500 dance groups come to participate in the event. The largest and most popular of the regional dances is the Tlacoleros dance (tigres y tlacoleros). As tigers (jaguars) threaten the farm hands, the boss organizes everyone and gets them to dance with thunderous stamping to scare away the threatening tiger. This dance is an iconic part of local culture.
Grutas de Juxtlahuaca - about 45 km southeast of Chilpancingo is a natural park featuring an archaeological site in a natural cave system. The caves feature drawings created during the Olmec civilization around 1200-900 BC. The caves are open to the public but a local guide is required.
