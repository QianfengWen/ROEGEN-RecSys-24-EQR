Colonial centro of Valle de Bravo
Valle de Bravo is a lively lakeside town in Mexico State, Mexico, about 150 km west of Mexico City. Set on the shores of Lake Avándaro, it is a popular weekend retreat with marinas, sailing clubs, exciting adventure activities like paragliding, and beautiful natural resources, including one of Mexico's famous monarch butterfly sanctuaries. 


Understand[edit]
Valle de Bravo has a population of just over 61,000 (2020) but the villages of the surrounding municipality (county) bring the regional population up to about 200,000. The town's name acknowledges its respect for Nicolas Bravo, a general during the Mexican War of Independence and a politician and vice-president of Mexico during the tumultous post-independence era.
The city was known in the 20th century for having hosted the world-famous Circuito Avandaro auto racing event, which in 1971, got hijacked by the Festival de Rock y Ruedas, a rock music festival whose massive crowds made it impossible to conduct an auto race. The Festival de Rock y Ruedes is often compared to the Woodstock festival in the United States, complete with rain and logistical problems. Xxact estimates of its crowds are impossible to know, but estimates range as high as 500,000 youthful music fans inundating the small lakeside town. 

History[edit]
Valle de Bravo was originally settled by the Matlatzinca indigenous people, who were conquered by the Aztec in the 1470s. The first Spanish conquerors arrived in 1530. Dominicans, Augustinians and Franciscan all had a hand in evangelizing the indigenous populations and establishing churches in town and in nearby villages throughout the municipality (county). 
During the Mexican War of Independence, royalist troops occupied the city and cracked down on sympathizers of the independence movement. 
The lake was formed by a dam built between 1938 and 1947. Built to generate hydroelectric power, it is today a popular recreational area drawing up to a million visitors annually to the town. Tourism is the town's largest economic activity.

There are various booths that sell C.D.s and DVDs, at very low prices but decent quality. There are many booths that sell fresh foods, such as fruits and vegetables, fresh meat, and tortillas. This is also a great place to grab a bite to eat. There are a lot of different booths where you can sit down and eat, but plan on getting there early to get a table.

Sweet[edit]
In Valle there are tons of different ice cream shops, that have a very wide variety of different flavors. Also there are ice cream carts in the town square. In the author's opinion the best kind to try is mamey (a type of fruit, that tastes like a mix of cantaloupe and almonds. The actual fruit is about the size of a mango, but is dark brown in color when ripe.) Tip: If you buy a "mamey" that is not quite ripe, wrap it in newspaper and let it sit a day or two. (Also, U.S customs will not allow this fruit to be brought into the United States even if you remove the pit).

Drink[edit]
There are plenty of nightclubs in Valle de Bravo that are geared towards tourists and weekend locals.
