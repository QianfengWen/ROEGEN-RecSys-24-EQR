Statue of Unity
Kevadia, officially known as Ekta Nagar, is a town of 6,800 people (2011) in South Gujarat, India. It is best known for the Statue of Unity, a colossal statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.


Understand[edit]
Kevadia is along the northern banks of the Narmada River. The small village turned into town when a colony was built for workers during construction of the gigantic Sardar Sarovar Dam. A new village Navagam was also built nearby to accommodate workers and displaced people. The town was a minor tourist spot due to dam but when the Statue of Unity was built in 2010s, it became one of the top tourist spots in the country. Gradually more and more attractions were added and other nearby tourism facilities were developed.
The local population is chiefly of tribal origin and reside in nearby villages in forests and hills. They come to town for employment and doing small businesses. Most street vendors belong from these tribal communities. They have their own culture and customs. Many of them faced displacement when the dam was built.
