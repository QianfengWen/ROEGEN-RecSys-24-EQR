See[edit]
Do[edit]
Surf skis, catamarans and windsurfers are hirable from the eastern shore of Lake Ainsworth. The protected waters of the lake are an excellent spot for windsurfing beginners.
The reef off the southern end of Seven Mile Beach, just north of Lennox Headland, is known as the Moat or Boat Channel and is within the Cape Byron Marine Park. The reef is an excellent place for snorkelling and provides good seasonal opportunities to view tropical fish, crustaceans and shellfish.
Lennox Point is popular with surfers who come for the famous and long right hand break [2][dead link]. Hang-gliders launch from its 65m cliff depending on wind strength direction. The point is also a great spot to watch the dolphins surfing and the annual whale migrations. Walk the new trail from the board-walk at the south end of the beach, east out to the point and up to the lookout.
Lennox Head, Seven Mile Beach - patrolled seasonally. Popular for body surfing, windsurfing and kite surfing. Be wary of rips. Dog walkers can exercise their hounds, leash free, from the access point at the northern end of the lake.
Lake Ainsworth, a freshwater dune lake with waters distinctively stained with tannin from the surrounding tea trees.
Lennox Head Bora Ring - Raised ring of sand 20-30 cm in height. The Bundjalung tribal site is on the western outskirts of the town. It is on cleared land, about 100m west of Gibbons Street surrounded by residential housing.
Lennox Head Heath - Behind Lake Ainsworth and to the north of the village, the specialised habitat of coastal heath provides good bird watching at any time, but in Spring a vast carpet of wildflowers attracts great numbers of birds. Birds seen include Brahminy Kite, Whistling Kite, Swamp Harrier, Rainbow Bee-eater, Superb Fairy-wren, Variegated Fairy-wren, Red-backed Fairy-wren, Little Wattlebird, Brown Honeyeater, White-cheeked Honeyeater, Tawny Grassbird and Golden-headed Cisticola.
