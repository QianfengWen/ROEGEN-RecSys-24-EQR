Marburg is a small university town north of Frankfurt in the Lahn valley, Hesse. The castle ("Landgrafenschloss") on the hill, the university's historical buildings and the old city ("Oberstadt", upper city) are the top sights of the city.


Understand[edit]
Walk the labyrinth of narrow, cobblestone streets lined with extremely well-preserved examples of 17th and 18th century Hessian architecture while taking surprisingly many stairs outdoors. Hearing nearby church bells toll while strolling through this part of Marburg is a life changing experience. This is the Germany you expect from the tour books and here you can enjoy it free from the crowds of tourists.
The Philipps-Universität (founded 1527) is the oldest Protestant university in the world. Marburg has approximately 76,000 residents. With 23,500 students and 6,000 people working for the university, a saying in Marburg is: "Other cities may have a university, Marburg is a university."
Those who have a grasp in Biology and/or Epidemiology may also remember the Marburg virus, which is equally fatal as the Ebola virus. The virus is named after the city after an outbreak in 1967, causing dozens of infections and several deaths.

Get in[edit]
Map of Marburg
By train[edit]
Marburg Central-Station
in addition to suburban trains Marburg is also a stop for InterCity IC trains. The city is well connected to Frankfurt and Kassel. From there you have extensive connections on the German InterCityExpress ICE train network.

By plane[edit]
Marburg has no airport so head for Frankfurt/Main, Germany's busiest airport.

By car[edit]
Marburg is not officially connected to an Autobahn, but you will find that coming from the south via Frankfurt and Giessen the Autobahn seamlessly leads to Bundesstraße 3a, which is developed equivalently.

Get around[edit]
As a small town it`s best explored on foot. Other possibilities include the public bus services and bicycle. A touristic tour is offered by the Schlossbahn.
If you need, ask the inhabitants: Most people are very friendly and will go out of their way to point out the sights.

By bus[edit]
Schedules and connections should be checked with the supra-regional transport association RMV.
Since stairs and ways to the castle are especially step and long, bus line 10 is a great alternative: Starting downtown it also stops at the old town's market and then drives all the way up to forecourt of the castle!
Single trips ("Einzel-Fahrkarte") cost around €2 and are quite expensive compared to a day ticket ("Tages-Karte") for less than €5 - as of 2018. Tickets can be bought directly from the bus driver, but a mobile journey planning & ticketing app is also available.
Some bus drivers can be rather harsh and impatient - no matter if you're a foreign tourist or local resident. So better be prepared which kind of ticket you want to buy or where you want to go and have some basic German words prepared.

By bike[edit]
The direct neighbourhoods of the old city can easily be explored by bike. However, since the old city itself is on a hill and streets are cobbled, riding a bike there is not recommended.
A bike trip to the south along the Lahn river is a perfect addition to a sightseeing trip in Marburg. Elevation is no problem there and bike ways are well developed.
A rental bike system is also available from Nextbike[dead link]. 30 Minutes will cost €1. Registration should be done in advance and rentals should be managed via Nextbike's app.

By Schlossbahn[edit]
The "Marburger Schlossbahn" is a private service, which offers sightseeing tours through downtown, old town and up to the castle. The whole vehicle is styled like a train with locomotive and waggons. Tour guides come from loudspeakers and are available in other languages as well. The service is not operated in winter. 

By elevator[edit]
To reach the "Oberstadt" you can also use one of the two lifts, which make it easily accessible for the disabled. Both lifts are free of charge. The "Oberstadt-Aufzug" is located at Pilgrimstein 28. The other lift is part of the "Pilgrimstein Parkhaus" parking deck and accessible from the street.

Talk[edit]
In Marburg many European and other languages are widely spoken. English is never a problem. For example it is possible to find those who will understand a little Japanese or Mandarin, especially if you approach one of the many exchange students.
The people in Marburg are very friendly and when you ask friendly you can get sometimes special tips you can never find in a guide.

See[edit]
Marburg Castle
Historical town hall and market place at the Oberstadt

Buy[edit]
Self-caterers and low-budget travelers can find all the big discounters in Marburg. There is also no shortage of health food stores. Furthermore, there is the possibility of getting supplies on Wednesdays and Saturdays at the markets in the south quarter, in the upper town and at the Elisabethkirche / Firmaneiplatz. In the old town you will find many smaller specialist shops with an extensive range, including several bookshops. There are several shopping centers in Marburg; Marburg, on the other hand, does not offer large shopping areas and miles.
A typical souvenir from Marburg is the "Marburger Nachtwächter", a herbal liqueur made according to a traditional recipe with 38% vol. It can be bought in the liquor and tobacco shop, Marktgasse 17, in the upper town.

Eat[edit]
The city caters for the needs of more than 18,000 students so it is not difficult to find a nice cafe or pub. Most of the good pubs are located in the Oberstadt. Be aware that during the university terms they are sometimes crowded.
Next to the lower level of the lift (Oberstadtaufzug) in the middle of Marburg you will find numerous restaurants, great Doner and a very good Lebanese Imbiss.
If you arrive at the train station and like to eat Asian food just walk straight away from the train station and cross the river bridge behind the highway. On the right side is a small, but good place for Asian food.
The area in the historic center around the Marktplatz and Barfuesserstraße is full of good, affordable restaurants for all tastes, many with outside seating. Most restaurants in the Oberstadt offer breakfasts or brunches, and pretty much all of them will have many vegetarian options.
