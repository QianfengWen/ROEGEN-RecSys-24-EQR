Kyrenia (Greek: Κερύνεια Keryneia, Turkish: Girne) is the chief port and tourist resort of Northern Cyprus. Its old centre is dominated by the castle over the harbour, built by the Venetians in 1540. The city in 2019 had a population of 45,881, with as many again in the resort strips that extend for 20 km on either side. 


Understand[edit]
This city was founded by Hellenistic people over 3000 years ago. They valued Cyprus for its copper and other metals, and mostly got around by sea, but the Romans from the first century AD carved a road right around the island and another inland through the mountains. As the chief port on this coast Kyrenia controlled trade and needed to be defended - the harbour castle you see today was built in 1540 and has been maintained ever since. Kyrenia had a Greek majority population until 1974, when Turkey invaded and most Greeks fled. After the ceasefire there was a population exchange, with Greeks deported and Girne, as it now became, settled by Turks from villages in the south. 
The 1990s saw a thawing of the "Cold War" or frozen conflict between Greece, Cyprus and Turkey, and Girne became a popular resort for westerners. It's always called Kyrenia in tourist literature so that's the name used here.

Get in[edit]
35°20′6″N 33°19′12″EMap of Kyrenia
By air[edit]
35.1633.51 Ercan (ECN IATA) is the airport for Northern Cyprus so most visitors arrive this way. Flights by Turkish Airlines and Pegasus connect across Europe but all make a stop in Turkey, see Northern Cyprus#Get in. Flights are hourly from Istanbul (IST and SAW) and frequent from Ankara, Izmir, Adana and Antalya.
Ercan is 42 km south and public transport is limited, you'd probably have to take the bus into Nicosia then out again. Hire a car unless your tour package includes a transfer. 
You can also fly into Larnaca (LCA IATA) in the south. Crossing the border is straightforward but your rental car will need extra insurance.

By boat[edit]
Fast-cat foot-passenger ferries (Deniz Otobüsü) sail May-Oct from the Turkish mainland: 

from Mersin Su Tu Th at 21:00, from Kyrenia M W F at 23:00, taking 80 min and operated by Akgunlerdenizcilik
from Taşucu at 14:00 and from Kyrenia at 10:00, Friday only, taking 2 hr and operated by Akgunlerdenizcilik
from Alanya is not sailing in 2023.
from Hatay, operated by HADO[dead link], is not sailing in 2023.
The only year-round ferry, and the only one to take vehicles (Feribot), is from Taşucu and takes 6 hours. It's operated by Akgunlerdenizcilik and in summer sails four times a week, usually at 23:30: from Taşucu on Su M Tu Th and from Kyrenia M Tu W F. Winter sailings are only once or twice a week.
The 35.34233.33022 ferry terminal is 1 km east of the historic harbour and castle. 
See Famagusta for another year-round car ferry from Mersin. See Limassol for sailings to the south, then you could come north overland.

By bus[edit]
Kyrenia Castle dominates the harbour
Buses here are like Turkish dolmuşes, they're minibuses that don't have a fixed timetable but set off when full, see Northern Cyprus#Get around. 
Buses from Nicosia run every 15 min from Kyrenia Gate on Cemal Gürsel Cd, north edge of the city, and take 30 min.
Buses from Famagusta run hourly and take 90 min. From Güzelyurt they're every couple of hours and take an hour. 
35.339733.32343 Kyrenia bus station is a fancy name for the drop-off / pick-up point on Mustafa Çağatay Cd, 200 m south of the castle. Don't go looking for the otogar shown on some maps 1 km south, it's just a bus parking lot.

Get around[edit]
The town is walkable, but you need a car to explore - there are a dozen rental companies in town if you didn't pick one up at the airport.
Minibuses ply along the coast resort strip but don't reach outlying sights such as St Hilarion Castle.
There's no longer a bicycle hire shop here.

See[edit]
The wrecked ship carried amphoras
35.341633.32241 Kyrenia Castle. M-Sa 08:00-18:00. Stonking great castle dominating the harbour. The first known castle was Byzantine, 7th century AD, and that was probably the version captured by Richard the Lionheart (along with the rest of Cyprus) in 1191 during the Third Crusade. He sold it to his French allies the Lusignans, who saw off sieges by Genoa but fell to the Venetians. They rebuilt the castle in its present form in 1540, but in 1570 had to surrender it to the Ottomans. They in turn occupied it to 1878 then ceded it to the British, who used it as a police barracks and training school, and in the 1950s as a prison for EOKA guerrillas. The castle interior is fairly bare, but there are various living quarters, a Byzantine church, a museum displaying a 4th century BC shipwreck (no extra fee), and the tomb of Admiral Sadik Pasha the Ottoman conqueror of Kyrenia. Take care on the battlements as there are worn steps and broken railings. 25 TL.   (updated May 2023)
Ağa Cafer Pasha Mosque west side of the castle was built in 1590. The interior is fairly plain.
St Andrews Church at the southwest corner of the castle is Anglican. Baldoken graveyard next to it has a few old Ottoman tombs.
35.342133.31872 Archangel Michael Church (Ιερός Ναός Αρχαγγέλου Μιχαήλ) is Greek Orthodox. The church and its museum of frescos have been closed since 2018 for re-building.
35.342833.32413 Harbour breakwater is a good spot for views of the castle. Some sections are in poor repair and work is under way in 2023.
Museum of Decorative Arts on Bozoklar Sk by the harbour remains closed in 2023. The Museum of Fine Arts has closed permanently.
35.307433.35544 Bellapais Abbey, Zafer Cd (6 km southeast of town). Daily 08:00-18:00. A monastery founded in 1197 by the Canons Regular of the Holy Sepulchre after they fled Jerusalem. The main building you see now was built in the 1270s and the cloister and refectory circa 1330 by King Hugh IV of Cyprus, who resided here. The place was ransacked by the Genoese in 1373 and wrecked by the Venetians in 1489. When the Ottomans took control of Cyprus they handed it over to the Greek Orthodox community, who used it as a parish church. Pockmarks in the refectory walls are from British soldiers enjoying food fights, only with pistols instead of potatoes and stale buns. 20 TL.   (updated May 2023)
Kyrenia Castle
Bitter Lemons 200 m south of the abbey is the cottage where the writer Lawrence Durrell (1912-1990) lived in the 1950s. Shortly after he left he published Justine, the first part of his best known work Alexandria Quartet. The naturalist Gerald Durrell was his younger brother. In 2023 the cottage is derelict and for sale.
35.313733.33245 Noble Peasant Statue is a 40 m-tall metal structure visible from the Nicosia highway. The kneeling figure is meant to symbolise the common heritage of the warring factions of Cyprus, descendants all of humble farmers of the same soil, and thus promote reconciliation. Well, worth a go maybe.
35.312333.28086 St Hilarion Castle, Karaman (10 km south of town). Daily 09:00-16:00. Saint Hilarion here is not the 4th century monk of Palestine, but an obscure fellow who fled the Holy Land after the Arab conquest. The mountaintop castle was built in the 10th century and reinforced by the Byzantines in the 11th. Richard the Lionheart captured it in 1191 when he took over Cyprus. Access is by a lane off the highway to Nicosia: do not stray from this, as it's a military area. From the car park a steep rugged footpath ascends to the Lower Ward, which housed the guard and stables, then the Middle and Upper Wards for the royal family. Great views back to Kyrenia on the coast. 15 TL.  (updated May 2023)
35.287533.41027 Buffavento Castle is a similar Byzantine fortress, reached from its south side by a rugged trail.

As of Sept 2023, Kyrenia, the beach strip and approach roads have 4G from KKTC Turkcell and KKTC Telsim. 5G has not reached Northern Cyprus. 

Go next[edit]
Famagusta has an old centre with Venetian fortifications, amidst much war damage ancient and modern.
 Nicosia is a fascinating Ottoman city. The ceasefire line runs through it, so its southern part is in Greek-speaking Cyprus.
You need your own vehicle to tour the Karpaz peninsula to the east, to be assailed by wild donkeys.
