Hay-on-Wye  (Y Gelli or Y Gelli Gandryll in Welsh) is a small town with a population of about 1,900 in Mid Wales, on the River Wye, very close to the English border and within the borders of Brecon Beacons National Park.
A "town of books", with at least 41 bookshops (mostly second-hand, antiquarian, and collectors), Hay-on-Wye is probably best known as the location of a prestigious annual Hay Festival.


Understand[edit]
Books at the Hay Castle
Since 1988, Hay-on-Wye has been the worthy venue for a literary festival which draws over 80,000 bibliophile visitors over 10 days at the end of May and beginning of June, in order to buy books, attend book launches and to see and hear big literary names from all over the world. High profile visitors to the Book Fair have included former US President Bill Clinton.
