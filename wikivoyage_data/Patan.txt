Patan, Lalitpur Metropolitan City, is one of the largest cities in Nepal and is located just across the Bagmati river from Kathmandu. Confusingly, it is also known as Lalitpur, both names deriving from the Sanskrit "Lalitapattan". Like its larger neighbour, Patan also boasts a Durbar Square full of temples, statues, and palaces and, in addition, has the must-see attraction of Patan Museum. As a traditional centre of handicrafts, Patan  is a great place to purchase jewellery, Buddha statues  and masks.

Get in[edit]
Micro Bus from Ratnapark in Kathmandu (15 rps, 10 rps for students/volunteers with a Nepalese ID card).
Taxis are a more expensive option 200-350 rps (~3-5 USD).
Buses. Catch a blue or green bus on Kathmandu's Ring Road (loops around Kathmandu Valley) for 15 to 20 rps. Tell the cashier/attendant that you want to go to Patan. He'll let you know when you get there. It's only a 15 min walk to Patan Dubar Square from Ring Road.
Walk. It is quite straightforward to walk from Thamel to Patan in about 90 minutes with many things to see along the way.  There are a couple of bridges providing access from Kathmandu to Patan so a good city map would be an asset.
Note: Nepal Buses & Micro buses are not very good for handicapped people or the faint of heart. The people are very friendly, but the vehicles are very old & rough.

Get around[edit]
The city and its sites are best seen on foot.
Taxis, minibuses, and tuk tuks are widely available.

Durbar Square[edit]
Map of Patan Durbar Square
Durbar Square is the Palace Square of Patan. Approaching the square from the south side you have the palace on your right and a series of temples on your left. Admission to the area for tourists is Rs 1000 (March 2023).You should pay this at a booth at the south end of Durbar Square or at another entrance to the area further to the north. It is also your entry ticket to the museum (no extra cost). You will likely be approached by various square workers if your entrance ticket isn't visible. If you plan repeated visits and will be in Nepal for some time, get the ticket booth attendant to endorse your entrance ticket for a longer period. You will likely have to show your passport and entry visa.

27.67385.325311 Palace (eastside of the Square). was built on the site of a fort that stood until 1734 and served as the residence of the Malla rulers of the then Patan state. It is divided up into a succession of courtyards (or “chowks”). Unfortunately only the last of these on the right, which houses the museum, is open on a regular basis due to problems with theft of artifacts. Try peering through cracks in the doors to see what you are missing. The first palace building is Sundari Chowk which was constructed in 1647. The three-storey temple on the palace side is the Degutale temple, constructed in 1661 after an earlier one burned down. Mul Chowk was the central part of the old palace and in recent times has suffered much theft of ornamental woodwork. 
27.6733985.325322 Patan Museum, Keshab Narayan Chowk. 10.30 to 17.30. An excellent and well-presented little museum with descriptions of various artistic techniques. 1000 Rs. (included in entry for Durbar Square). (updated Mar 2023)
There is a confusing array of temples and other interesting items on the left-hand side of the square. Again, walking from the south end of the square, you pass:

27.6732185.325233 Taleju Temple. 
27.6728785.324884 Octagonal stone Krishna temple (Chyasaldewal). constructed in 1647 
27.6729885.324925 Taleju Bell. A huge bell that dates back to 1737 which is rung once a year. 
 Shankar Narayan temple. with kneeling stone elephants in front 
27.6731785.324536 Bhai Dega Temple (Biseshvar Temple) (before Cafe de Patan). A shiva temple 
27.6731685.324957 Hari Shankar Temple. Half Vishnu half Shiva deity. Built in 1704-5 
27.6734285.324888 Jagan Narayan Temple (Charnarayan Temple) (north of Hari Shankar Temple). Two storey. Brick. The oldest temple in the complex, dating back to 1565. The temple with a statue of Yognarendra on a pillar in front. (Southward) 
Two smaller temples dedicated to Vishnu, dating back to 1590 and 1652.
A stone temple to Krishna, considered to be a masterpiece, with some amazing stonework. Note the Garuda on the pillar in front, which has eyes of crystal.
27.6736285.324959 Krishna Mandir (South of Vishwanath Temple). 
27.6737285.325110 Vishwanath temple. with two stone elephants and riders in front 
A view of the stone Krishna Temple with Garuda to the right.
27.6738785.3252311 Bhimsen temple (northest temple on the west side of the Durbar Square). constructed in 1680 but with more recent marble additions. 
27.672885.3251412 Degutalle Temple (east side of the Durbar Square). Five storey on the Palace ground 
27.6737285.3253313 Mani Mandap (next to Manga Hiti). A pavilion dating from the 1700s. 
27.6736585.3255114 Manga Hiti (behind Mani Mandap). A lotus shaped pool and three carved stone crocodile head.

Suraschandra Mahavihar, Patan
Kontihiti Kumbheswar, Patan
27.6687985.3272116 Mahaboudha Temple, Okubhal to Chakra bhil street and Sundhara Street corner (5-10 minutes walking distance SE from Durbar Square). This is a stone temple covered with terracotta tiles, which include 1008 Budha images. It was modelled on a larger temple in Bodhgaya, India and took one family four generations to complete 
27.670385.323117 Machchhendranath temple (Rato Temple, Red Temple, Machhindra Bahal temple), Near to Prayag Pokhari Marg (500 m south from Durbar Square). This is a good illustration of the problems now faced with theft of artifacts. The temple is now surrounded by a strong fence and each statue has its own individual fence. Statues are missing from two stands, suggesting that the temple has already fallen victim. Machchhendranath also gives his name to an annual festival when a 25 m tall "chariot" is paraded through Patan. If you note all the wires and cables across the streets at levels much lower than 25 m you can appreciate what a complicated exercise this is. The parade takes place between April and June, with the chariot staying the night at different locations. The end of the parade is supposed to coincide with the onset of the monsoon rains. The wheels of the chariot are over 2 m in diameter. For the rest of the year these can be seen in the building next to the Ashok Stupa (see below). 
27.6698985.3244818 Minanath  Temple (100 m East from Machchhendranath temple, Prayag Pokhari Bus Stop). There is a secondary School. 
27.6682485.3272319 Rudravarna Mahavihar (Uku Bahal) (100 m south of Mahaboudha Temple). A gem of a temple close to Mahaboudha, but much less visited. One of the oldest temples in the Kathmandu Valley with some strange and interesting statues.

North of Durbar Square[edit]
A view of the Golden Temple in Patan.
27.6752585.3246421 Golden Temple (Hiranayavarna Makavikar, Kwa Bahal), Kwalakhu Rd (Near to Nag Bahal). An enormous number of gold- and silver-covered decorations and some excellent bronze statues make this well worth being the only temple in Patan you have to pay to enter. Construction dates back to the early 1400s, although some pieces pre-date construction. Admission NPR50. 
Bangalamukhi temple complex
27.6766685.3259522 Baglamukhi Mandir (Banglamukhi Temple, Kumbeswar Temple, Kumbheshwore Temple), Kwalakhu Rd. Shiva Temple. One of the two five-story pagoda temples of the Valley. The sunken basin is usually empty but around August is filled for the Kumbheshwar Mela full moon day festival. At this time the temple becomes packed. Sheep roaming the temple are those that have been spared sacrifice.

27.674385.3252923 Rade Krishna Temple (100 m north of Durbar Square on west side).

Next to that is the building where the structure of the Machchhendranath chariot is kept when not being used,).
