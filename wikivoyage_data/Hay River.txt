Understand[edit]
Alexandra Falls
Hay River is a small town on the shore of Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories on Canada.  The town is home to the Northern Transportation Company Limited, and serves as a transportation hub of the north, as goods are transferred from rail and truck to barges to be sent across Great Slave Lake, up the Mackenzie River and to many isolated northern communities and industrial sites.  It has all-season road access, making it a destination in both summer and winter, uninterrupted during the spring breakup and fall freeze up seasons.  Northern towns are often not very pretty, but the surrounding area is often breathtaking.

History[edit]
The area has been in used by First Nations (Indigenous people), known as the Long Spear people, as far back as 7000 BC. The first permanent settlement in the area of Hay River was established in what is now the Katl'odeeche First Nation or Hay River Reserve. This was sometime between 1892-93. This first settlement was established by Chief Chiatlo and a group of people by the building of log cabins and bringing dairy cows.
The first buildings were those of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1868 followed by a Roman Catholic Mission in 1869 and an Anglican Mission in 1894.
A school, health centre and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police followed, and as part of the Canol Road project the United States Army Corps of Engineers built a runway on Vale Island. In 1948 the Government of Canada built a gravel road, now the Mackenzie Highway, from Grimshaw, Alberta to Hay River making it the first community in the NWT to be linked with southern Canada. The settlement's role as terminus of all-season trucking, and the establishment of a commercial fishing industry, started an economic boom.
In 1959, the Northern Transportation Company Limited located its main base in Hay River and over the years developed the facilities. Today the base is the major staging point for the annual sealift along the Mackenzie River, via Inuvik and Tuktoyaktuk and the communities of the Arctic Ocean, as far east as Taloyoak, Nunavut and west to Utqiagvik, Alaska.
By 1964, as part of the Pine Point Mine development, the Mackenzie Northern Railway was constructed. The railway, through Canadian National Railway in Edmonton, makes Hay River the northernmost point in Canada, and all of North America, which is connected to the continental railway system. The Alaska Railroad is located farther north but is orphaned from the network.

Climate[edit]
Hay River has a subarctic climate with summer lasting for about three months.  Winter temperatures are usually below freezing. Rainfall, which can occur throughout the year, averages 217.4 mm (8.5 in) and snowfall 138.9 cm (54.7 in). From December to January on average there are 71.8 days when the wind chill is below −30°C, which indicates that frostbite may occur within 10 – 30 minutes.
