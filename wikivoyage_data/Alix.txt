Understand[edit]
Map of Alix
Alix's village mascot is the Alix-Gator, who is featured prominently on many signs and businesses.
Alix was founded as Toddsville. The settlement was incorporated on June 3, 1907, and was named after Alexia Westhead, the first white woman settler of the community (Alix was her nickname). 
Alix became the home to Dr. Irene Parlby, minister without portfolio in Alberta's 1921 provincial government and one of the "Famous Five" Alberta women who argued in the Supreme Court against government officials who argued that women cannot be senators because there was no intent to include them in the definition of the term "persons" under the Canadian constitution.  The Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council ultimately granted their appeal and found in their favour.
