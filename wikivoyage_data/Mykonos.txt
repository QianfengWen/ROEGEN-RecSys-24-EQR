Mykonos (Greek: Μύκονος) is a popular tourist destination in the Greek islands of the Cyclades group, situated in the middle of the Aegean Sea. Mykonos is located south of Tinos, east of Syros and north of Paros and Naxos.


Understand[edit]

Mykonos is famed as a cosmopolitan destination amongst the Greek islands and widely recognised as one of the great travel meccas. It is one of the most visited islands in the Aegean. This means that visitors should be prepared for loud dance clubs, English breakfasts and overpriced merchandise. Mykonos, along with Santorini, is more expensive than other Greek islands.
Mykonos tends to be extremely crowded with visitors in July and August. The best time to visit Mykonos is mid-May through June (early season, when accommodations are much cheaper and it's not too hot), or September through mid-October (post season).
Mykonos is a gay-friendly island, featuring a vibrant gay nightlife, ranking among the most popular holiday destinations in Europe among gay travellers.  While there are many other destinations around the Mediterranean that see sizeable gay tourist traffic, Mykonos managed to remain refined and romantic rather than rowdy.
If you're gay, get yourself an up-to-date map with all the gay venues. The most popular beaches with gay visitors are Super Paradise and Elia. These are not strictly gay, but they have parts where gay men and women congregate. The only gay beach deserving of the title is the small beach between Elia and Agrari.

Orientation[edit]
Little Venice in Mykonos Town
Mykonos' main communities are Chora, the island's port town and capital, and Ano Mera.

Mykonos Town (Chora) is a stunningly picturesque Cycladic town with a maze of tiny, whitewashed streets, houses and churches, gathered around its harbour in the middle of a wide bay. It is one of the most cosmopolitan and crowded towns of the Aegean.
Although the streets are lined with little shops, boutiques, art galleries, cafes, stylish bars and restaurants, Mykonos Town has not completely lost its identity. Despite the island's rapid growth and development, its traditional Cycladic architectural style and character has remained firmly intact, thanks to the island's strict building regulations.

Ano Mera is a small village on the middle of the island, and the only inland settlement on the whole of Mykonos, about 7 km east of Mykonos Town. Ano Mera is based around a large central square, which is lined on three sides by a series of Greek tavernas. The monastery of Panagia Tourliani, founded in 1542, is Ano Mera's most significant highlight.
Other small communities include:

Agios Ioannis is a small settlement with two taverns, one restaurant and one tiny store. Agios Ioannis is famous as the location for the movie "Shirley Valentine".
Agios Stefanos with many hotels, good restaurants, taverns and cafes.
Platys Gialos is a popular tourist resort where small fishing boats transport tourists to the southern beaches of Mykonos.
Ornos with several choices for staying, food and drink, and a well organized food market with a butcher's shop, bakery, supermarket and a pharmacy.
Tourlos is where most of the cruise ships dock, private yachts and fishing boats use the marina and the port receives some of the ferries coming from the mainland or other islands.

The climate of Mykonos is characterised by hot, dry summers and mild winters. Like in most of the Aegean islands it hardly ever rains during summer but rain showers can be expected between October and April.
Temperatures in July and August range from 30°C (86°F) during the day to 22°C (72°F) at night. The Cyclades are famous for the constant wind (called meltemi) in July and August that mitigates the heat a bit.
Mid-May through mid-October is usually warm and sunny enough to enjoy the beaches.

Talk[edit]
Greek is the official language of Greece, and therefore it's spoken by all the permanent inhabitants of the island and most of its visitors, but the foreign visitor will have no problem at all communicating in foreign languages, mainly in English.

Get in[edit]
View of Mykonos' port
By boat[edit]
From the Greek mainland ferries and high speed catamaran services run daily from Piraeus and Rafina. The highspeeds take half the time but cost twice as much.
The journey between the port of Piraeus (Athens) and Mykonos takes between 3 hr 30 min and 5 hr 15 min, depending on the type of ferry you are taking. On a slow ferry a seat in economy class will cost €32; on a highspeed service expect to pay €54.50. In Piraeus all the highspeed ferries to Mykonos depart from Port Gate Ε7; the conventional ferries leave from Port Gate Ε1. Most of the ferries connecting Piraeus to Mykonos stop working by end of October and resume by April.
Many travelers probably don't even consider Rafina a possible departure port if they are heading to one of the Cyclades, but if you are arriving at the airport of Athens you are often better off taking a ferry from Rafina than traveling to Athens and get a ferry from Piraeus. The journey between Rafina and Mykonos takes between 2 hr 10 min and 5 hr 30 min, depending on the type of ferry you are taking. On a regular ferry expect to pay €23.50 per person for a seat in economy class; on a high speed catamaran service expect to pay €52.50. Most of the ferries connecting Rafina to Mykonos stop working by end of October and resume by April.
Mykonos can also be reached directly from other islands in the Cyclades. More than once a day there is a boat connection from Syros, Andros, Tinos and Paros. There are daily boat connections from Naxos, Ios, Santorini and Crete. There's a daily overnight ferry, the 'Nissos Mykonos', from Samos (Vathi and Karlovassi) and Ikaria. There are less frequent boat connections from Serifos,  Sifnos,  Kimolos,  Milos, Folegandros, Sikinos, Thirassia and Anafi.
Ferry companies:

Hellenic Seaways provide a fast hydrofoil connection and regular ferries from Piraeus (Highspeed 5 and Highspeed 6) and Rafina (Flying Cat 3).
Seajets[dead link] have a regular schedule in the summer from Piraeus (SuperJet) and Rafina (Seajet 2).
Blue Star Ferries have a regular daily schedules from Piraeus throughout the year (Blue Star Ithaki).
Aegean Speed Lines have a daily high speed ferry operating from Piraeus (Speedrunner 3).
Pre-booking of ferries and highspeeds is only necessary from mid-July to late August or just before or after a Greek holiday.
Beware that every year at the 15th of Augustus the island of Tinos is a goal for thousands of orthodox pilgrims. Most ferries and highspeeds from Piraeus and Rafina to Mykonos make a stop at Tinos. This means that around this period it is recommended to buy tickets well in advance. Also expect a lot of Greek tourist to visit Mykonos around the weekend of Pentecost, in late May or early June.
Keep in mind that if you book your ticket online, you may still need to collect the ticket from a travel agency once you get to Greece.
Boat services can be cancelled due to strong wind. Weather cancellations are very rare, though, only a few days over the course of a summer.
Mykonos has two ports: the old port in Mykonos Town, and the new port at Tourlos, about 2 km north of Mykonos Town. Check before you travel which port your boat will use. Most of the ferries use the new port. The highspeed catamaran services still use the old port in Mykonos Town.

From the port to Mykonos Town[edit]
The best option is the SeaBus that will get you into town for €2. It leaves every half hour and the entire journey (2 stops at the new port and 2 stops in Mykonos town) takes 12 min.
During high season there is an infrequent public bus service from the new port in Tourlos to Mykonos Town. It is best to take a taxi. It is possible to walk from the new port into town, but it will take around 45 minutes along a busy main road without a sidewalk.
From the old port it is a short and easy walk along the coast into town.

By cruise ship[edit]
Mykonos is a popular stop on cruise ship tours of the Greek Islands.
Almost all cruise ships dock at the new port in Tourlos, though some cruise ships use the old port.
If you are arriving at the new port, make use of the cruise shuttle bus to Mykonos Town. You can also take a taxi yourself, but with so many people arriving at the same time it won't be easy to catch one. It is likely that the cruise shuttle bus will drop you off at a parking area not far from the northern bus station in Mykonos Town. It is less than a 10-minute ride. From there everything is within walking distance.
If you are arriving at the old port, you will arrive within a 10-minute walk of the heart of Mykonos Town and no bus ride will be necessary or even available.
It is easy to explore Mykonos independently. There's no real need to book excursions. Also the recommended excursion to Delos can be booked independently (guided or unguided).

By plane[edit]
37.43512825.3481031 Mykonos Island National Airport (JMK  IATA) (is about 4 km away from the main town). There are daily flights from Athens (35 minutes) by Olympic Air and Aegean Airlines. During summer, both Olympic Air and Aegean Airlines also have daily direct flights from Thessaloniki. In high season there are also less frequent flights from Rhodes, Santorini, Crete (Heraklion) and Volos by Sky Express. International flights are also available in high season.   (updated Jul 2023)
From May through October, charter airlines fly directly to Mykonos from many European airports:

TUIfly flies from Amsterdam (AMS);
Blue Panorama Airlines flies from Rome Fiumicino (FCO);
Borajet[dead link] flies from Istanbul Sabiha-Gökçen (SAW);
EasyJet flies from London Gatwick (LGW), Geneva (GVA), Milan Malpensa (MXP), Paris Orly (ORY) and Rome Fiumicino (FCO);

At the arrival area of the airport you may find an ATM, shops, a cafeteria, public phones, a post box, an office of the Mykonos Hoteliers Association, an Olympic Air office, an Aegean Airlines office and many car rental companies.
In the terminal building on the first floor there is a duty-free shop for departing passengers selling tobacco, spirits, perfumes, cosmetics, travel accessories and gift items.
Take a free and useful Mykonos Sky Map from the luggage collecting hall at the airport. This free map is also sold in shops in Mykonos Town.

From the airport to Mykonos Town[edit]
Many Mykonos hotels offer airport transfers, at rates that can be anything from free to more than a taxi. Best chance for a free transfer is when you book your room directly with the hotel. A transfer by your hotel is the easiest way to get to your hotel, so check with your hotel before arrival.
Taxis are usually waiting at the airport, at the taxi rank opposite the terminal building, but competition for them can be keen. If there is no taxi waiting you can see the sign with the phone numbers of the taxi radio office so you may call. A taxi from Mykonos airport to town costs about €8, a few euros more if you are carrying luggage.
Buses from and to the airport are frequent from the southern bus terminal, Fabrika, in Mykonos Town.
You can also walk from the airport into town, it's about 2.5km and most of the time there is a pavement to safely walk on. It's mostly uphill going towards the airport.

With a length of 12 to 15 km and a width of 10 km, Mykonos is one of the smallest of the Cyclades islands. On Mykonos you can get around by bus, taxi, car, scooter, ATV or boat.

By bus[edit]
There is a bus network that takes you around the island. There are two bus stations in Mykonos Town, each on different sides of Mykonos Town. From the main southern bus station, Fabrica, buses can be taken for departures to Platys Gialos (every half hour), Paraga (every hour), Paradise (every half hour), Ornos and Agios Ioannis. There are also night buses from Mykonos to Platys Gialos and Paradise leaving every hour. From the northern bus station which is not very far from the old port ferry quay, buses can be taken for departures to Ano Mera, Elia (departing at 11AM, noon, 2PM, 4PM, 6PM and 7PM, returning 30 minutes later) and Kalafatis.
Departure times are clearly marked at the two bus stations and the end of the bus routes. Bus schedules change a bit about every two weeks. Frequencies of buses are higher in high season.
There is no bus connection between the two bus stations. From one bus station to the other will take about 20 minutes of walking through the streets of Mykonos Town.
It is possible to buy your bus ticket from the bus driver (have exact change ready), but you can also buy your bus tickets before boarding the bus. Bus tickets can be bought in advance from a bus ticket vending machine (euro coins necessary) and can be purchased at kiosks, mini-markets and tourist shops as well. There are no return tickets available; for a return trip you simply need two single tickets. Hand over your ticket to the bus driver and he will "validate" it by simply tearing your ticket. There are ticket stamping machines in the bus, but they simply don't function. Don't be surprised if a man that is already on the bus near the bus driver will check your "validated" ticket a few minutes later. Even though your ticket is just teared and not stamped, he will inspect your ticket thoroughly, looking for counterfeited tickets. Bus tickets are €1.60, except for the further destinations of Elia and Kalafatis which cost €1.70. Tickets for night buses are €2.  Buses in Mykonos are almost always full during the busy parts of the day; the bus driver will squeeze in as many passengers as he can.

By taxi[edit]
On the entire island there are only about 30 taxis, which means that depending on taxis for transport can be an exercise of great patience. In Mykonos Town the main location for taxis is in Manto Square (also called Town Square or Taxi Square), on the harbour front near the statue. You have to wait in line and sometimes you can wait for hours in the taxi queue. In the evening it can be very difficult to find a taxi. Taxis do not use meters, but there's a notice board giving rates for each destination. Fares are quite reasonable. Calling for a radio taxi costs €1.30 extra, and an appointment €5 in addition to the fare. Contact telephone numbers are 22400 and 23700.

By boat[edit]
Various boat services provide a good and fun way of getting to the southern beaches of Mykonos.

From Platys Gialos small fishing boats converted into tourist transport leave every hour or less to the beaches of Paranga, Paradise, Super Paradise, Agrari and Elia. First departure 10:15 until 16:15 every hour. Last return to Platys Gialos from Elia at 18:00 and from Super Paradise at 20:00.
From Ornos boats leave for the beaches of Platys Gialos, Paranga,  Paradise, Super Paradise, Agrari and Elia. Boats leaves from Ornos at 10:00, 11:00, 12:00 and 13:00.
Price for a return ticket is €5 for Paranga and Paradise, €6 for Super Paradise and €7 for Agrari and Elia. Boat services can be cancelled due to strong wind, but with the exception of Super Paradise all of these beaches can be reached by bus from Mykonos Town as well.
From June to September there are also infrequently boats leaving from the harbour in Mykonos Town to Super Paradise, Agrari and Elia.

By car or by motorbike[edit]
Mykonos has an extensive public transport system from Mykonos Town. By public transport it is easy to get to all the southern beaches, which happen to be the nicest beaches as well. Renting a motorbike or a car is the way to go if you want to explore the rest of the island, especially the more remote beaches at the north coast. Motorbike and car rentals are readily available around the island. In Mykonos Town the highest concentration of rent a car - motorbike agencies is in and around the area of the southern busstation, where you will find a wide range of choices. The other area of Mykonos Town with rent a car - motorbike agencies is near to the old port, behind the Archaeological Museum.

Cars are not permitted in the town of Mykonos. There are parking areas on the outskirts of town, but during peak season finding a parking space is usually a challenge. You can always try the huge public parking area next to the old port. Considering Mykonos is a very small island, renting a bike might be a better choice, unless you are planning to stay far out of town and from beaches. Bikes are cheap to rent, you can park them almost anywhere, and it is cooler than a car standing in the hot sun all day.

See[edit]
Windmills in Mykonos Town
Attractions in Mykonos Town[edit]
37.444525.32561 The Windmills, Mykonos Town (western part of town). From as early as the 16th century, the windmills are one of the most recognized landmarks of Mykonos. Once this island was a great producer of wheat and bread. The area of the windmills has a splendid view on Little Venice and is the most popular place in Mykonos to watch the sunset.   
 Little Venice (Alefkandra), Mykonos Town (most western part of town). A district located at the sea, famous for its picturesque medieval two and three storey houses, which stand like a wall above the sea, and their colourful wooden balconies. Little Venice is one of the most beautiful and romantic places in the whole of Mykonos and offers a fantastic sunset. A favourite activity is drinking a cocktail in one of the many bars and cafes while watching the sunset on the seashore. You will reach Little Venice walking from the windmills down the stairs. It is only a five minute walk from Fabrika bus station and there is a sign for it on the other side of the square. 
37.447125.32572 Panagia Paraportiani, Mykonos Town (most western part of town). Of all the churches on Mykonos, the most impressive is Panagia Paraportianí, a true Byzantine jewel. This whitewashed church, which building dates back to 1425 and was not completed until the 17th century, is the most popular and most photographed of the 400 churches on the whole island of Mykonos. It is made up of four chapels at ground level with another one above. Only one of the chapels on the ground floor is open to visitors, from early morning until sunset. The church is located in the Kastro district, the oldest section of Mykonos Town.   
Petros the Pelican, the island's mascot, can sometimes be found at the waterfront or even up in town. The pelican was found wounded off the coast of Paranga shore after a storm back in the 1950s by a local fisherman. The pelican was nursed to health and remained on the island supported by locals. It soon adopted the name “Petros”. To great disappointment by locals and tourists alike, Petros was hit by a car on 2 December 1985 and failed to recover. After Petros died in 1986 he was so popular that a new pelican was introduced as a successor. Now there are three pelicans inhabiting the island. This means that the Petros you meet, can be a Petra. Well, this is Mykonos.
Museums[edit]
All museums are open from April to October, except the Archaeological Museum which is open year-round. Most people keep the museums for a rainy day, but the Archaeological Museum is worth a visit.

Beaches[edit]
Most of the beaches have tavernas and restaurants and are well equipped with deck chairs and parasols. Most common price is €12 for a set of two deck chairs and an umbrella. The best beaches are on the south side of the island and sheltered from the prevailing northern wind. On the more popular beaches, it is not uncommon for people to walk down the beach selling probably illegal goods such as DVDs, fake bags, clothes, jewellery and watches. They come right up to you and it can be somewhat annoying but they are easily pushed away with a simple 'No, thank you'. Also, many beaches, even the more family-orientated, are often populated with the 'European' style of sunbathing - i.e. topless.

South coast[edit]
Elia Beach, Mykonos
 Psarou (5 km from Mykonos Town). This upmarket beach is popular amongst Greeks. Lots of hotels, apartments and restaurants. Psarou is easily accessible by bus from Mykonos Town. Get off the bus one stop before the last stop, Platys Gialos. 
 Platys Gialos (6km from Mykonos Town). Busy family and tourist beach. Lots of hotels, apartments, restaurants and beach bars, lining the long sandy beach. Jet ski rentals are available. Bus service from Mykonos Town is very frequent and takes about 15 minutes. Platys Gialos is the starting point for regular boat services to the other southern Mykonos beaches. 
 Paranga (6km from Mykonos Town). Sandy beach. There are some rocks in water, but many places where you can enter over sand.  There is a camping, some hotels and some nice beach bars and restaurants. Also popular with gays. Nudity is quite common, especially on the right end (facing the sea). At about 5PM the beach gets really noisy with several beach bars. On the right side Paranga also has a large, more quiet stretch of sandy beach without deck chairs and parasols and without restaurants and bars.Paranga is easily accessible by bus from Mykonos Town or with a regular boat service from Platys Gialos (first stop). It is also an easy walk from Platys Gialos (15 minutes) or Paradise (10 minutes).On your way walking from Platys Galios you will pass by the beach of Aghia Anna, an enchanting little cove nearby Paranga Beach with only a handful of rental umbrellas and lounge chairs. At this golden sand beach there are two lovely restaurants nearby, a more modern Greek restaurant (Santanna) and a traditional-style Greek tavern (Nikolas). 
 Paradise (Kalamopodi) (6km from Mykonos Town). Probably the most popular beaches known for its parties. At about 16:00 the music will get really loud. Paradise is easily reached by bus from Mykonos Town or with a regular boat service from Platys Gialos (second stop). 
 Super Paradise (Plintri) (7km from Mykonos Town). Restaurants, beach bars and some hotels. The right side of the beach is mostly nude and gay. At about 16:00 the music will get really loud and there will be music from both the left side (Super Paradise Beach Bar Club) and the right side (Coco Club); for some time to leave, for others time to party. There is no bus service to Super Paradise, but it is easily accessible with a regular boat service from Platys Gialos (third stop). You can also take the bus to Paradise from Mykonos Town and then continue walking for 20 minutes over the hill to Super paradise. From June to September there is a boat from the harbour in Mykonos Town to Super Paradise, leaving in the morning and returning around 16:30 in the afternoon. With your own transport it is a difficult winding road from Mykonos Town. 
 Agrari (8km from Mykonos Town). Agrari Beach is less popular than its neighbour Elia and much calmer. Well organized with sunbeds and umbrellas, with many watersports. If there are enough passengers, the boats from Platys Gialos will make a stop at Agrari. Otherwise, it is an easy 5-minute walk over the rocks from Elia Beach. With you own transport it is a quite difficult road from Mykonos Town. 
 Elia (8km from Mykonos Town). Elia is one of the larger beaches on Mykonos. It is a well organized beach with sunbeds and umbrellas (40 euro in 2020), and various water sports (ski and jet-ski). Three restaurants and taverns. Also popular with gays, especially the small rocky beach between Elia and Agari. Nudity is permitted but not as common as at Paradise, Super Paradise and Paranga. Nudity is concentrated at the right and nicest part of the beach (towards Agrari). Elia is most easily reached by a direct local bus from Mykonos Town’s northern bus terminal, but also with a regular boat service from Platys Gialos beach (fourth and last stop). Last boat back is at 18:00, but after that time two buses are still running (leaving at 18:30 and 19:30). 
East coast[edit]
 Kalo Livadi (10km from, Mykonos Town, 2km from Ano Mera). A quiet, long stretch of sandy beach. It offers some taverns with good food, and a few small hotels and villas. Best reached with your own transport, but you can get there by bus. Take the bus to Elia and get off the bus at the top of the hill where it turns to go to Elia Beach and walk for about ten minutes downhill to your left. 
 Kalafati (12km from Mykonos Town). A very large, beautiful and less developed beach and a favourite with windsurfers due to the offshore breeze. A variety of water sports are available here, including jet ski, water ski, wakeboard and tube rides. Kalafati can be reached by bus from Mykonos Town, but this bus only runs a few times a day. Immediately next to Kalafatis are the sandy beaches of Draoumia and Tafarnis. 
 Lia (14km from Mykonos Town). An uncrowded, sandy beach. Deck chairs and umbrellas are available to rent. Some tiny houses of fishermen from a little settlement, with two taverns and a beach bar. To get there you need your own transport or you can walk from Kalafati. 
North coast[edit]
 Fokos. A small beach with coarse sand, not known by many people. This beach has no facilities like sunbeds and umbrellas, but it offers a very good tavern. To get to Fokos you need your own transport. Follow the signs for Fokos from Ano Mera. 
 Ftelia (near Ano Mera, southern part of Panormos Bay). This beach faces the north and thus it is affected by the strong summer northern winds, which make it ideal for wind surfing, but not for swimming or sunbathing. Ftelia is an isolated, very tranquil place and even during July and August not very crowded, because it is often quite windy and dusty. To get there you need your own transport. From Ano Mera follow a weaving road down to the beach. 
 Panormos. On the north side of the island and facing east onto Panormos Bay is the long and beautiful Panormos Beach. Two restaurants, one hotel and a trendy beach club serve this otherwise remote area. Panormos Beach is nudist beach mostly in the right side. To get to Panormos you need your own transport. 
 Agios Sostis. This beach faces the east of Panormos Bay. Agios Sostis is one of the more remote beaches on the island, without rental lounge chairs and umbrellas. Void of accommodation and crowds this beautiful beach offers not only peace and quiet, but also a very good small restaurant. Nude bathing tolerant. To get there you need your own transport. Take the road beyond Panormos beach. 
West coast[edit]
 Agios Stefanos (3km north of Mykonos Town). A well developed, sandy beach next to the new harbor. Agios Stefanos is very popular and gets very crowded during summer time. This beach is about the length of a soccer pitch. Agios Stefanos is reachable by bus from Mykonos town. 
 Tourlos (2km north of Mykonos Town). A small beach near the new port of Mykonos. The actual beach of Tourlos is not used much anymore since the construction of the new port and marina, but is still a busy area. 
 Mykonos town beach. There's a small beach at the harbour front (Aghia Anna, one of several by that name on the island). Unless you are waiting for a boat leaving from the old port, there is no reason staying there. Much better beaches are within easy reach. 
 Megali Ammos (1km south of Mykonos Town). The nearest beach to Mykonos Town, a 10-minute walk from Mykonos Town along the coast into the direction of Ornos (or hop on the bus to Ornos). The beach is next to the central road. There is a huge slab in the sea which makes it a little difficult to swim. The beach has no umbrellas and sunbeds due to the strong northerly winds. There are a few hotels and apartments and a wonderful tavern, Joanna's Niko's Place. 
 Ornos (3km south of Mykonos Town). Busy family and tourist beach. It gathers many for its sunbeds and umbrellas, and bars and restaurants. The sandy beach slopes gently into the sea. There are schools for sea-skiing and surfing.Ornos is easily accessible by bus from Mykonos Town (or walk along the coast road for about 30 minutes).2 km north of Ornos is the beach of Korfos, suitable for wind surfing, but not for swimming or sunbathing. 
 Agios Ioannis (Shirley Valentine Beach) (4km south west of Mykonos Town). Agios Ioannis is a small beach with snorkeling opportunities. The beach never gets over crowded and deck chairs are available to rent. Great tavern and cocktail bar very close. The beach offers a beautiful view towards the nearby islands of Delos and Rheneia. Agios Ioannis is easily accessible by bus from Mykonos Town.Next to Agios Ioannis is the small beach of Kapari, with a small nude section. This hidden beach is located north of Agios Ioannis, behind Agios Ioannis chapel, and then a steep walk downhill. 
Do[edit]
Preserved marble theatre in Delos
Delos, a small uninhabited island close to Mykonos, is a UNESCO world heritage area known for its important archaeological sites. There are daily excursions from Mykonos Town except Monday, when the archaeological site is closed. Boats leave at 09:00, 10:00 and 11:00 from the pier at the west side of the harbour, right behind the little church of Agios Nikolaos. The boat trip takes about 30 minutes. Boats return at 12:15, 13:30 and 15:00. Boat trips to Delos are also organized from Platys Gialos and Paranga Beach. The excavations are open from 08:30 to 15:00, so have an early start if you really want to see it all. The cost is €17 for the boat trip plus €5 for entrance (though free for students and €3 for those over 65). A guided tour, departing at 10:00 from the pier in Mykonos, will cost €40 (including boat trip and entrance fee). Delos is a must for all visitors.
From Platys Gialos you can take a cruise on a GlassBottom Discover Boat, a boat with a glass floor at the bottom through which you can view underwater life. There are beach-to-beach cruises (€35), sunset cruises (€25) and cruises to Delos and Rhenia (€35).
Check the ferry schedules well, but it is possible to make daytrips to the islands of Tinos, Syros, Paros and Naxos.
Buy[edit]
You can go shopping or window shopping in the fabulous little boutiques which carry exclusive name brands, among them outstanding Greek jewelers, souvenirs as well as works of art. Bring money and credit cards. Most shops are open seven days a week, but will be closed from 14:00 to 17:00. Many tourist shops will remain open late into the evening. In case you are looking for department stores, as some cruise tourists do, there aren't any.
Mykonos is home to a large artists' colony, so there are a number of fine galleries offering original works.
Of course, you will also find the shops you need to fill all your basic needs and comforts. There are mini-markets, green grocers, butchers, kiosks, bakeries, liquor stores, a few small supermarkets (and bigger supermarkets out of town), many pharmacies, a dry goods shop, bookstores, photo and electronics shops.
ATM's are available throughout town. There's a concentration of ATM's near the southern bus station.

Eat[edit]
In Mykonos Town you will find most of the restaurants and eateries. All over town there are various gyros and souvlaki shops and creperies where you can eat quite well for just a few euros. Mykonos offers dining options catering to a range of tastes and budgets. You can have good Greek food at reasonable prices, but it also easy to spend a fortune. Almost all restaurants (and many bars) post their prices on menus at the entrance, so as you walk around you can take a look to see which places offer appealing food in your budget range. Restaurants facing the harbour or the sea (especially in Little Venice) tend to have significantly higher prices, because you are also paying for the location and the view. Restaurants in the streets deeper in the heart of town tend to be more reasonably priced.

Connect[edit]
Telephone[edit]
Truly the cheapest way to call abroad is to use a pre-paid calling card and call from a land line anywhere (also from your hotel room). Pre-paid calling cards are sold in many shops and kiosks in Mykonos Town. The calling card is not much more than a phone number and a PIN code, which you dial prior to dialling the usual phone number. If you want to call internationally, ask for an international calling card.  For €1 you can call for about 45 minutes, so buy a card in the cheapest value (which is about €3).  Calling someone for half an hour is cheaper than sending one email from an Internet café. Cards expire usually 90 days after first use. You can use this pre-paid calling card also at public phone boxes, which are widely available in Mykonos Town, though there are a lot of broken phone boxes as well.

Stay safe[edit]
Mykonos is generally a safe island, with the only problem of dangerous and drunk driving. Be aware in case you want to rent a motorbike or quadbike, because its roads are sometimes narrow with sudden twists that need driving experience and extra care.
