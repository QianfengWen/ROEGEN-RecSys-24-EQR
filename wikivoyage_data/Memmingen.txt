Memmingen is a city of about 44,000 people (2019) in the German Federal State of Bavaria. The numerous courtyards, patricians' houses and fortification in its old town are well worth seeing. Due to its proximity to the Allgäu region it is also a popular base for tourists who are planning to visit the Bavarian Alps or Lake Constance. Memmingen is however mostly known by foreign travellers due to Allgäu Airport Memmingen being nearby.


Understand[edit]
The so called "Wine Market"
Memmingen is a small town with central functions in a rural area of Bavaria. Tourism was once widely limited to guests from places around. With the opening of the Allgäu Airport increasingly more international guests, discover the charm of the town for trips to the tourism regions around as well as to the popular destinations Ulm, Augsburg and Munich.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Ryanair and Wizz fly to Memmingen
47.98888810.2394451 Allgäu Airport Memmingen (FMM  IATA) (4 km east of Memmingen in the village of Memmingerberg). This minor international airport serves budget and leisure flights. Low-cost airlines sometimes sell it as "Munich West", which makes as much sense as calling it Stuttgart South or Zürich North - it however can be an alternative to the often significantly more expensive Munich Airport due to its practical ground transportation connections. Ryanair and Wizz Air fly from over three dozen cities and leisure destinations with a focus on south-eastern Europe and the Mediterranean such as Alicante, Dublin, London-Stansted, Palma de Mallorca, Porto, Sofia, Tel Aviv, Belgrade, Pristina or Skopje, but also rather unusual destinations like Kutaisi. The airport is small so it can get congested, but is normally clean and spacious, with cafes, car hire and free WiFi available. The Starfighter F104 by the entrance recalls bygone days as a military airfield. It became a commercial airport in 2004 but stuttered for years without regular flights until Ryanair and Wizz established routes and has since expanded to serve nearly 2 million passengers per year.   (updated Dec 2022)
Busses 2 and 810 shuttle daily approx. half-hourly between 05:00-23:00 from the terminal to the bus station (ZOB), which is next to Memmingen railway station and central in town. The ride takes 10-15 min and costs €3.50 (exact change preferred, card payment not always available) - with a railway ticket it may be included in the price, check when booking if the destination says "Memmingerberg, Allgäu Airport"; Bayern-Tickets are also valid on the busses. A taxi to town might be €15. From the station you can easily reach Munich (see below), or for that matter Stuttgart or Zürich. There are multiple daily direct coach services (Allgäu Airport Express) from Memmingen Airport to Munich city centre as well which can be booked online or at a counter next to the arrivals area.

By train[edit]
Regional trains operated by Deutsche Bahn (DB) and Go-Ahead run at least hourly from Munich (60-90 min, line RE96 being the fastest) and from Stuttgart via Ulm. Every two hours there are semi-high-speed long-distance trains (EuroCity-Express) from Zürich via Winterthur, St Gallen and Bregenz and onwards to Munich as well.
The railway station is about a 5-minute walk away from the town center. There are luggage lockers next to the building. If all lockers are in use it is suggested to ask at the DB booking office for alternatives.
Remember there are special train tickets for Baden-Württemberg (Baden-Württemberg-Ticket) and Bavaria (Bayern-Ticket). With these ticket up to five people can use all regional trains for a whole day for €21 - 38 (all together). Both ticket types are valid for travelling to Memmingen. The Bayern-Ticket also covers the costs for the local public bus transport. More information about these tickets can be obtained from the Deutsche Bahn[dead link].
