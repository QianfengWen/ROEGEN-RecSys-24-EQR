The science center Heureka in Tikkurila
Vantaa (Swedish: Vanda) is in the Uusimaa region in southern Finland, right north of Helsinki. Part of the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, it is the fourth most populous city in Finland with about 238,000 inhabitants as of 2021.


Understand[edit]
Like Espoo, Vantaa is basically an extension of Helsinki and does not have one single city centre despite having a huge population by Finnish measures. Vantaa's administrative centre is in the district of Tikkurila (Swedish: Dickursby), and other districts that can be considered local "centres" are Myyrmäki (Swedish: Myrbacka) in the west, Kivistö in the north-west and Korso in the north-east. 
Quite few of the inhabitants have any connections to the rural landscapes and villages left from the old Helsinge (renamed Vantaa 1972). Best known as the city where Helsinki's airport is located, you will also find various parks and farms you can visit there, as well as the beautiful medieval Church of St. Lawrence and a couple of interesting museums. On the more modern side, the complex of the Jumbo mall and Flamingo hotel and entertainment centre can keep you busy for a couple of hours at least, depending on your interests.
The Helsinki Airport, located in the middle of northern Vantaa, takes up a large part of the city's area and effectively splits the rest of Vantaa in two parts, the Myyrmäki-Martinlaakso area in the west and the Tikkurila area in the east. The Ring Rail (Finnish: Kehärata) railway line connects all three areas together with the neighbouring city of Helsinki.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The city is indeed accessible by air, as 60.31722224.9633331 Helsinki Airport (HEL IATA).    is situated in Vantaa. There are buses from the airport to different parts of Vantaa, or you can take the commuter train to the public transport traffic hubs Tikkurila (for eastern Vantaa) or Myyrmäki (for western Vantaa).

By train[edit]
The main railroad north from Helsinki goes through eastern Vantaa. In addition to several local train stations, all long distance trains to the north and east, including the ones to Russia, stop at 60.29300825.0448462 Tikkurila Railway Station.   . If you are heading for the western parts of Vantaa, you can take the local train line "I", which stops at 60.261424.85473 Myyrmäki Railway Station.    and also continues to Helsinki–Vantaa Airport via 60.314324.84644 Kivistö Railway Station.   .

By car[edit]
Highways 3, 4, 45 and 7 out of Helsinki go through Vantaa and the main east-western road is the third ring road (Kehä III), which is mostly part of the E18 route. In the morning and afternoon rush hours traffic it can get quite busy and in the winter a heavy snowfall or a larger accident due to the often over-frozen road surface can block the traffic completely.

By bus[edit]
From Helsinki several local buses go to Vantaa, and there are some lines directly from Espoo too. The Helsinki region public transport authority's Journey Planner[dead link] is an excellent tool to find out which bus you should take from one address to another. Some larger cities in southern Finland also have a direct connection to Helsinki airport.

Get around[edit]
See Helsinki#Get around for information about fares and tickets
60°18′46″N 24°58′51″EMap of Vantaa


By train[edit]
Kehärata (Ring Line) connecting the main rail line with western Vantaa via the airport opened in July 2015. Combined with bus transfers, this is the fastest way to get around for many. See Journey Planner[dead link] or Google Maps for routes and timetables.

By bus[edit]
There is a maze of bus lines in the area, however with the opening of the Ring Rail train line the routes were completely renewed. See Journey Planner[dead link] or Google Maps for routes and schedules.

By car[edit]
As distances are longer than in the more central parts of Helsinki, driving is sometimes an option. As above, the traffic can get quite congested in the rush hours, especially on the ring roads.

By bike or foot[edit]
On a sunny summer's day you can make use of the cycleways and footpaths criss-crossing Vantaa and suburban Helsinki. Get a good map.
