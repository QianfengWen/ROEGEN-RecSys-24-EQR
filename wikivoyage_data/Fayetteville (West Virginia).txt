New River Gorge Bridge straddling the canyon
Fayetteville is a town of 2,754 people (as of 2000) in West Virginia, often called "Gateway to the New River Gorge"; it borders the northern end of New River Gorge National Park and Preserve. It was originally called Vandalia, before it became the seat of Fayette County in 1837 and was incorporated in 1883. Most visitors come to enjoy the scenic views from the New River Gorge Bridge, and the outdoor adventures that are linked to the area: whitewater rafting, kayaking, canoeing, horseback riding, llama treks, hiking, mountain biking, rock climbing, rappelling, camping and fishing.
