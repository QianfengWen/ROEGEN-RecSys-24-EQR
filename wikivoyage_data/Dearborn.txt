Understand[edit]
Automotive history[edit]
Dearborn was the birthplace of Henry Ford, and later he pioneered the mass production of Automobiles here. The world headquarters of the Ford Motor Company is still here.

Arab heritage[edit]
Settlers from the Middle East date back to the 1800s, and many were employed by Henry Ford during the early days of the company in the 1910s. As a result of their long heritage in the area, Dearborn is the city with the most concentrated Arab population in the Western Hemisphere.
