Hahn is a hamlet in Rhineland Palatinate, Germany, best known for its international airport served by budget carriers. Though the airport is advertised as a way to get to Frankfurt, Hahn is actually about halfway between Frankfurt and Luxembourg—over 100 km (62 mi) from each.


Understand[edit]
Hahn is in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, about 100 km (62 mi) west of Frankfurt.  The village of Hahn is somewhat overshadowed by its airport, Frankfurt-Hahn, used by many budget flights as an entry point to the region. The village is not easily reached from the airport by foot, since it is on the other side of the runway from the terminal. The hamlet next to the terminal building is Lautzenhausen. 
While Hahn's main claim to fame is indeed the airport, its name is also somewhat funny to people who speak German, as Hahn is the German word for a rooster. Sadly unlike the towns of  Dull and Boring, there are no efforts as of 2017 to have a town twinning with Chicken, Alaska.

By plane[edit]
49.9483337.2641671 Frankfurt-Hahn Airport (HHN  IATA). This airport is a destination for low-cost airlines: the largest is Ryanair. For marketing reasons, the airport calls itself "Frankfurt-Hahn", even though it is closer to the centre of Luxembourg than the centre of the bustling city of Frankfurt more than 100 km (62 mi) away, around 90 minutes by bus! Unlike almost all major German airports, Hahn is not connected directly to the railway system. There has been talk of rebuilding a line that once went all the way to the airport, but this has been postponed numerous times due to budget problems. Don't hold your breath.The modern (though basic) terminal has various shops and bars. There are a couple of hotels nearby. Several major car rental companies have outlets here.Ryanair flies to numerous European destinations from the airport: London Stansted Airport and Riga in Latvia are examples.

The official website of the airport keeps track of the buses. Click on the city name and you will get a pop up window with the line that serves the said connection.
As of September 2023, the airport can be reached with the following long-distance bus and regional lines:

Flibco to Frankfurt am Main, Frankfurt Airport and Mainz.  Several times a day.
Intermezzo lines to Saarbrücken and Saarlouis.  0-3 departures per day.
Line 615 to Koblenz (transfer to regional and long-distance trains). Every 2 hours during the day. In order to operate there are two rides of the day for which you need to call a phone number: The earliest ride arriving at 4:38am at the airport and for the latest ride departing 00:37am from the airport. The phone number is +49261/9846140 and must be called until 10pm the day before.
Line 660 to Simmern
Line 750 to Bullay (transfer to regional trains). About every 2 hours during the day.
The last three mentioned can be used with the Deutschlandticket.
It is recommended to book the ticket for Flibco in advance online. The bus from Frankfurt Airport can be full (as it goes from the centre of Frankfurt and makes a stop at Frankfurt Airport Terminal 1), especially when time is close to popular Ryanair flights to Italy.
Allow plenty of time if going from Frankfurt airport to Hahn airport for a connecting flight. Frankfurt's main airport  (FRA IATA) and Frankfurt - Hahn are 2 hours apart.

By car[edit]
Hahn is located along the B-327, a short distance from the B-50/E-42 between Bernkastel-Kues and Kirchberg; a 30-km, 20-minute drive from the Rheinböllen junction of the A61.
With a good quality road from the A61, Hahn can be easier to reach from many parts of Germany than Frankfurt Airport, as there is less chance of major traffic congestion. There can be issues in the winter as, due to its position in the Hunsrück, there can be heavy snowfalls.
If you are just picking up or dropping off someone at the airport there is a covered parking area near the airport terminal at €4 an hour and an open one that is 5 minutes free. For long stay prices range from €39 to €59 a week. It is a little bit of a walk up hill from P2 and quite a hike from P3. P4 is further away and a little more expensive but has a shuttle bus to and from the terminal. In the winter make sure you are dressed for a walk outside and have snow and ice scrapers in the car and if you are fortunate to have one, program you car heater for just before your return.

By train[edit]
Traben-Trarbach is 9 km away and has a train station which allows for easy access to the rest of Germany. The reactivation of the railway line that used to connect to Hahn has been put off repeatedly and may well never come to fruition.

Get around[edit]
Both the airport and the hamlet of Hahn are small enough to allow you to walk everywhere.

See[edit]
There is an outside observation area on the first floor of the main terminal for plane spotters and those wanting to see people arriving across the apron.
