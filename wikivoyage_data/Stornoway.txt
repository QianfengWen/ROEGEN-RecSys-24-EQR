Stornoway (Gaelic Steòrnabhagh) is the main town on Lewis and the admin centre for all of Scotland's Outer Hebrides. Indeed it's the only town in these islands; it has the best amenities and transport links, and it's the obvious base for exploring both Lewis and Harris. It is industrial, and not particularly picturesque, but has lots to see. The population was 4800 in 2021, a sharp decline on previous figures.

By plane[edit]
58.2139-6.32191 Stornoway Airport (SYY  IATA) (2 miles east of town on A866), ☏ +44 1851 702256. Stornoway has flights from across Scotland by Loganair, in twin-prop aircraft. These are not cheap, around £250 return and more at the weekend, but it's a full-service airline so a checked bag is included in the fare. (And think what petrol alone will cost if you drive then take the ferry.) There are four flights M-Th and two F-Su from Glasgow GLA taking an hour, one or two from Edinburgh, 1-3 from Inverness, and M-F one or two from Benbecula. Check-in an hour before flight is soon enough at Stornoway; allow the standard two hours at busy Edinburgh or Glasgow. The airport has toilets, a lounge and cafe. There's car hire but you need to book ahead. Bus W5 runs between town and airport five times M-Sa, taking 15 min. Another five buses M-F pass nearby on the highway out to Point. All the local taxi firms serve the airport, see "Get around".   (updated Sep 2023)

By boat[edit]
Calmac ferries sail to Stornoway from Ullapool on the mainland, taking 2 hr 30 min. There are two sailings year-round M-Sa, and on Sunday two Apr-Oct and just one Nov-Mar. Until end of March 2025, return fares are £121.30 per car, £22.30 per adult including driver, and £11.20 per child aged 5-15. These ferries often sell out in summer, so even foot passengers should book in advance. Be at the pier at least 45 min before sailing. 
There is also a ferry from Uig on Skye to  Tarbert on Harris, from where you can drive up to Lewis.
You can also sail to Lochmaddy on North Uist, or to South Uist or Barra, then work your way north by road and ferry, as part of a tour of the Outer Hebrides.

By bus[edit]
See Lewis for buses around the island, which all converge on Stornoway. They're sparse M-Sa with nothing on Sunday. The bus station is next to the ferry terminal.
A bus-ferry service runs up the Western Isles through Barra, the Uists and Harris to Stornoway, so M-Sa it may be possible to go the whole way in one day. There are half-a-dozen services part-route, but for the full route you need to set off from Castlebay on Barra at 6:20AM, Lochboisedale on South Uist at 9AM, Benbecula at 11:10AM, Lochmaddy on North Uist at 11:30AM and Tarbert on Harris at 4:20PM, to reach Stornoway by 5:30PM. Going south, you leave Stornoway 9:30AM to reach Tarbert at 10:45AM, Lochmaddy at 1:45PM, Benbecula at 2:25PM, Lochboisdale at 3:25PM and reach Castlebay at 5:35PM. 

Get around[edit]
By bus: see Lewis for routes around the island, which all converge on Stornoway. The town is small and the only bus you're likely to use within it is W5, which runs east along A866 to the airport and away out to The Point. Northbound it runs along B895 up the east coast past the hospital towards Tolsta. About a dozen run M-F and five on Saturday.
Bus W1 (for the north tip of the island) and Bus W2 (west coast loop) run through town along A857 to Manors roundabout and the hospital before wandering off into the countryside.
Car hire: rental firms are Stornoway Car Hire (+44 1851 702658), Stornoway Vehicle Hire (+44 7502 156439) and Car Hire Hebrides (+44 1851 706500). They can all pick up or drop off at the ferry terminal or airport.
Taxi: the Stornoway airport website lists almost two dozen local operators.

The castle was built in the 1850s for Sir James Matheson, who made his fortune in the far eastern opium trade. To build it he demolished the remnants of the preceding medieval castle, whilst losing the "i" from Lewis. It was later sold to Lord Leverhulme the soap tycoon. In the 20th century it was used as a navy air base and as student accommodation then fell into disuse, but was refurbished from 2011. It now houses Museum & Tasglann nan Eilean, the museum and archive of island life. The ballroom is used as a ritzy event space, and there's expensive self-catering apartments available. The extensive castle grounds are always open to stroll. Donation.   (updated Sep 2023)
58.2037-6.37213 Old Gun Battery is just a pair of 19th-century Royal Naval Reserve 6-inch guns at the entrance to the power station. The battery was in use 1876-1919: it was just a training facility. It was built over by the power station but these guns were recovered from the site. You can continue out along the causeway to the marina, though the area is industrial.
58.19-6.3484 Iolaire Memorial: in the early hours of New Year's Day 1919, HMY Iolaire was bringing home sailors demobilised at the end of the Great War, but she struck a rock at the entrance to Stornoway harbour and sank. The official death toll was 205, mostly local men, but the boat was overcrowded and it may have been higher. The memorial is at Holm east of town, follow the lane south just before the airport entrance.

Drink[edit]
Stornoway's concentration of pubs reflects the absence of them around the rest of Lewis.
Crown Inn on Castle St (see Sleep) is the bar where the 14-year-old Prince Charles (now King Charles III) came on a sailing outing from his school Gordonstoun. Locals recognised the boat and crowded round. The prince fled in here and ordered the only drink he knew the name of: a cherry brandy. His forebear Bonnie Prince Charlie could have drained the bottle in a trice, but the young prince was under age. His bodyguard (his only friend and confidant) was sacked, and Charles was thereafter closely confined to his school regime of cold showers, dawn runs, and bullying, bullying, bullying

The rest of Lewis is easiest to explore by day-trips from Stornoway, for example the Callanish Stones. You need your own vehicle.
Great Bernera is an island linked by road to Lewis. It has accommodation.
Harris is more rugged and scenic than Lewis. It is within range of a day-trip from Stornoway, or you might move base to either Tarbert or Leverburgh.
Berneray, reached by ferry from Leverburgh, is the next island on the chain leading south, with a good paved road all the way down through the Uists.
