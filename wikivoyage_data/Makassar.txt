Makassar was the traditional capital of the Bugis kingdom (Sultanate of Gowa). The Bugis were known throughout the region as proud, fierce warriors and pirates and highly skilled mariners, and before the Dutch defeated them, they had a formidable empire and sphere of influence in what the Europeans called the "Spice Islands". The Bugis also traded throughout the region, and you can find Bugis people today in many other parts of Indonesia and beyond.
Makassarese cuisine, based as you might expect on seafood, is highly prized throughout the region, so make sure to have some while you are here.

Get in[edit]

You can use the taxi app Grab. It is well-connected to other major cities in Indonesia, and also served a handful of international flights from Malaysia and Singapore.
The Airport Bus (operated by Perum Damri) is operating on the lower ground floor, linking the airport to the city. Ticket costs Rp27,000 (as of March 2019). If there is no one on the counter, you can board the bus and pay after the bus departs. The bus should be departing at a 30-min internal. The journey takes about one hour.

By boat[edit]
The main port of Makassar is the Soekarno-Hatta Harbor. Makassar is a major port for Pelni ships for Central and Eastern Indonesia. It takes about 16 hours to Balikpapan, 24 to Surabaya, and 30 to Tanjung Priok.

By bus[edit]
Makassar has several bus terminals.
One of the most useful bus terminals is Terminal Daya, 200 m from the main road from Makassar to Pare-Pare (and Rantepao).
The Daya bus terminal is the one that serves Tana Toraja.

-5.11014119.507813 Terminal Daya (on the main road towards the airport). Rp2000. (updated Jul 2016)





Note: The Daya bus terminal has a fairly bad reputation among locals; although most buses to Tana Toraja do pass there, hardly any passenger embarks or disembarks there. It is strongly advised to buy the ticket, wait for the bus and board the bus directly in the dedicated bus company terminal (e.g. Bintang Prima terminal, Litha terminal). Fares are the same (or cheaper) and the safety is much better.





-5.12478119.504674 Terminal Bintang Prima. (updated Jul 2016)
-5.1467119.466835 Terminal Litha (On the main road towards the airport (much closer to the city center than terminal Daya and terminal Bintang Prima)). A pete-pete from the city center to terminal Litha should cost Rp5000. (updated Jul 2016)

5°9′2″S 119°27′13″EMap of Makassar


By becak[edit]
Becak is a trishaw of unique design but minimalist compared to the ones in Java, can accommodate 2 small persons/children, but suitable only for one adult. Fare depends on the distance, usually Rp8,000-15,000 around town.

By taxi[edit]
There's a lot of taxi companies, all have the same fare and all use meters. You can also use the taxi app Grab.

By petepete (Angkot)[edit]
Petepete is the equivalent to other cities' angkot (angkutan kota/city transportation). A trip in town usually costs Rp5000.

By Trans Mamminasata[edit]
Trans Mamminasata (Makassar, Sungguminasa and Takalar) operates with Corridor-2 Trans Studio-Mal Panakukkang. Not as TransJakarta which serve only inside Jakarta, Trans Mamminasata serve also to outside Makassar.

By Transportation Sharing Application[edit]
On-demand (online) ojek services such as Go-Jek[dead link] and Grab are ubiquitous can be booked through their respective smartphone apps, and offer generally cheaper fares which are stated in advance. Payments can be made by cash or using stored value (akin to prepaid mobile phone service). Go-Jek as a pioneer has more widespread availability; those who travel here alongside other Southeast Asian countries may find it useful to keep using Grab. The other more expensive on-demand ojek service is Lady Jek with female drivers. Unlike conventional ojeks, which typically only operate dawn to dusk, they are available 24 hours and relatively safe for both passengers and drivers because they are monitored by GPS. While it seems cheap, those who travel in groups of at least three may be better off taking a taxi for convenience and unnoticeable difference in fares.

Talk[edit]
Makassar is a multicultural city, but dominated by ethnic Makassar and Bugis. Therefore, they have a lingua franca language that is, Makassar Malay Language (Logat Makassar) or can be called Indonesian Language dialect of Makassar.
Macassar Malay is not a creole, but a mixed Malay–Macassarese language, with Malay lexicon, Macassarese inflections, and mixed Malay/Macassarese syntax.
