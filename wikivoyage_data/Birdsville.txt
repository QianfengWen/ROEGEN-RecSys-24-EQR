Birdsville is a remote town in outback Queensland, right on the edge of the Simpson Desert.  It has a population of around 300, but a steady stream of visitors heading outback or returning from the desert.  The Birdsville track occupies a place in Australian folklore, but with a few sensible precautions this is an outback town accessible to all.


Understand[edit]

Being an outback town also means that there are extremes of temperature. Expect hot summers with average maximums at nearly 40°C, and some days of extreme heat.  Winter is more mild, with warm days and cold nights.  Rain is uncommon, but heavy rains can isolate the town for days, and can occur at any time of year - but most likely in summer.  April to October are the best months to visit.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Birdsville has its own -25.897333139.3508011 airport. , and aviation related tourism is significant for the town.  The airport is buzzing with general aviation flights for the Birdsville races.  The airport terminal itself is right across the road from the pub, and (if you are so inclined) you can be seated at the bar with your first cold one within 5 minutes of stepping off the plane.

By car[edit]
A two-wheel drive vehicle is usually okay along the Birdsville track.  Check local road conditions, and the predicted weather.  The roads can close to all or just 2 wheel drive vehicles.  Any road trip to Birdsville requires preparation.  A careful eye on the weather and road conditions and a few survival rations on board.  It will take you longer to drive from Brisbane than it would if you were to drive to Melbourne or Cairns.

Get around[edit]
Shuttle buses run to the races and to the music festival when they are on.  The town itself is very small you wouldn't need a car to get between the Caravan Park, the pub and the billabong.  You'll need a car (or a plane) to continue your trip.
