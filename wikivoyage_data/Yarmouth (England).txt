Not to be confused with Great Yarmouth.
Yarmouth Castle
Yarmouth is an attractive little town at the western tip of the Isle of Wight, just offshore of the South East of England.
Everything in Yarmouth seems to be on a small scale; small narrow streets nestle against a small castle and harbour, and the ferry terminal is actually built against the castle walls.
Yarmouth is the chief town of 'West Wight', the western part of the Isle of Wight, and forms a very good base for exploring this part of the island.


Get in[edit]
By ferry[edit]
From a mainland location, the best approach is to use the Wightlink car and passenger ferry which runs every half-hour direct to Yarmouth. This ferry operates from Lymington (on the mainland) and has good rail and road connections (as described in the Lymington article). Taking a car on the ferry can be quite expensive; for short visits it may be better to park in the car park at Lymington Pier and board the ferry as a foot passenger.

By car[edit]
Yarmouth is connected to the rest of the Isle of Wight by Southern Vectis service 7. There is also an open top bus that runs from Yarmouth to Alum Bay and The Needles Battery, offering spectacular views.

Get around[edit]

The town of Yarmouth itself is easily walkable. For nearby areas of West Wight, the Island Explorer (services 7/7A/7B; see 'Get in' above) provides good service. Southern Vectis also operates the open top "Needles Breezer" throughout the summer, which serves Freshwater Bay, Alum Bay and the Needles on a hourly basis.
