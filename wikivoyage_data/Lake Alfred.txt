Mansion at Mackay Gardens & Lakeside Preserve.
Lake Alfred is small town of 4,000 people in north-central Polk County, Florida. The town lies along U.S. 17/92, which runs north/south through the center of town. Easily a drive-though community for motorists, it is worth a stop to hike through Mackay Gardens, browse the family-owned businesses along Haines St, or maybe even learn to water ski.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Lake Alfred was established in 1883 soon after the South Florida Railroad reached the area by settlers escaping the cold of Fargo, North Dakota. The town was initially called "Fargo", but the Post Office objected over confusion with Largo. The town then took on the name Chubb and later Bartow Junction because it lay at the junction of a road leading south into the county seat Bartow. In 1913, it was named Lake Alfred after the nearby lake which, in turn, had been named for Alfred Parslow, an early settler. The Mackay estate on the north shore of Lake Rochelle was built around 1920. It was purchased in 2004 by the city and is slowly being renovated to its original glory and will hopefully be placed on the National Register of Historic Places soon.

Climate[edit]








Check the weather forecast for Lake Alfred at NOAA.



Lake Alfred's climate is much the same as the rest of Central Florida (except coasts). Winters are mild, with highs in the 70s (21-27°C) and lows in the 50s (10-15°C). Lows in the 30s (0-5°C) are common after cold fronts and there are usually a handful of lows below freezing each winter, although that requires clear skies, so it usually warms very rapidly after sunrise (30°F at 6AM, 55°F by noon is typical). Cold fronts occasionally pass by as squall lines, so tornadoes in December or January are not unusual. Snow is rare; the last measurable snowfall was in 1977, although sleet/wintry mix fell in an unusually cold January 2010. Summers are hot and humid, with highs around 90-95°F (33-35°C) and lows around 74-78°F (23-26°C). During the summer, onshore winds from both coasts travel inland, heat up, rise and build into thunderstorms, usually along a rough line. Lying in the center of the state, the line of storms (each called a "seabreeze") often collide and become severe, with tornadoes (small EF0-1s...not like the powerful tornadoes in the Plains states), 50+ mph winds, and hail possible. Strong storms are usually preceded by cooler winds caused by the rain-cooled air (cold air sinks) rapidly flowing away from the storm. The temperature after a strong thunderstorm passes can drop from 95°F (35°C) to 75°F (24°C) and since the storms can be fairly small, you can drive 5 miles and the temperature will drop/rise 20°F (10°C) between rain-cooled and surrounding areas.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Lake Alfred is located along U.S. 17/92, just north of Winter Haven and east of Auburndale and a few miles west of Haines City. County Road 557 runs north from town to Interstate 4 (exit 48); a branch of it—C.R. 557A—connects to Polk City.

By bus[edit]
Winter Haven Area Transit (W.H.A.T.) operates one route through town, along U.S. 17/92. Route 15 runs between the Winter Haven Terminal (north side of downtown) and downtown Haines City. Adult fare is $1.50/ride with no free transfers. A day pass for adults costs $3 and is good for 24 hours. Discounts are available for students & seniors.

By plane[edit]
The nearest commercial airports are Orlando International Airport (MCO IATA) and Tampa International Airport (TPA IATA).
Winter Haven Municipal Airport (GIF IATA) & Jack Brown's Seaplane Base (FAA LID:  F57) are located just a couple miles west of Lake Alfred off U.S. 92. They serve general aviation, but not regularly-scheduled, commercial flights.

Get around[edit]
Map of Lake Alfred.
The only effective way to get around town is with a car or on foot. The town extends just a dozen or so blocks in all directions from the intersection of Haines St and northbound U.S. 17/92, so walking is a reasonable option. The nearest car rental agencies are in Winter Haven and Auburndale.

By bus[edit]
Public transportation consists of WHAT Route 15 along U.S. 17/92. This will only get you a mile or two within town, so at $1.50/ride isn't a practical way to get around Lake Alfred.

The estate was built by Scottish entrepreneur Alexander Mackay, who named it "La Rochelle". The 7,000 square foot mansion is a great example of Craftsman style architecture. The interior is only open for tours (need to be scheduled) and for private events. There are a few miles of nature trails around the estate. The trails are marked by paint on posts & trees, but some sections aren't well marked and/or aren't cleared very wide (less than 2 ft wide in spots). Near the estate is a playground, restrooms, and small, Florida-friendly garden (showcases the local vegetation to minimize watering and fertilizer). The city purchased the estate in 2004 and has invested in many improvements to the site, but there is still more to be done.
