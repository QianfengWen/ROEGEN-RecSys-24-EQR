Curepipe is a sprawling town in the centre of Mauritius. At an altitude of 561 m, it marks the top of the ridge on the road between Port Louis and Vieux Grand Port, and the name may indicate that travellers rested here for long enough to smoke then clean out their clay pipes. The town is frankly ugly and ill-planned but is near natural attractions, especially the Botanic Gardens, where the cooler wetter hill climate supports unusual trees and flowers.
