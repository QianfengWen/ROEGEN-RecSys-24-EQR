Bowie is a suburban bedroom community of Washington, D.C. in Prince George's County, Maryland.


Understand[edit]
While Bowie's history goes back over a century, much of the city consists of ranch and Cape Cod homes built in the 1960s and 1970s as a planned community by Levitt & Sons, a noted real estate development company. Lately, Bowie has grown by annexing various developments that have sprouted up around the city's edge since the mid-1980s. The visitor can still find vestiges of historical Bowie—most notably, the railroads and horse farms that defined Bowie in the pre-Levitt era. One of America's oldest historically black universities is Bowie State University, located in Old Bowie.
