Merrickville is a village of 1200 people on the Rideau Canal in eastern Ontario. It is a village of picturesque Victorian-era stone houses and modestly claims to be Canada’s prettiest village, a claim not without merit. (It isn't a self-granted title; the national non-profit organization "Communities in Bloom" called them that in 1998.) As Merrickville is half an hour from the edge of urban Ottawa, it is a popular destination for summer day trips.
