Richmond is a riverine city to the south of Vancouver in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia. Comprising several islands, the city is protected by a system of dikes from the Fraser River's occasional flooding. Richmond has the country's largest Asian-Canadian population by percentage, many Cantonese speaking; over 60% of the population is non-white.

Seaside restaurants in Richmond
Richmond is mainly composed of four main islands connected by roads: Lulu Island (by far the largest and most populated of the islands), Sea Island (mostly occupied by Vancouver International Airport (YVR IATA)), Mitchell Island (industrial land) and Iona Island (a park and a wastewater treatment plant). Steveston, a former fishing village that is now a tourist and shopping district, sits at the southwestern tip.
The character of Richmond has changed dramatically since the 1980s. It used to be primarily a farming community with a large fishing village. It has become a centre of new immigrants, mostly from Asia, especially Hong Kong and mainland China. There are now many residential high rise towers and Hong Kong-style shopping malls like Aberdeen Centre. Today, the heart of Chinese Vancouver beats here in Richmond and not in Chinatown.


Talk[edit]
Mandarin and Cantonese are commonly heard in Richmond due to the large population of Chinese immigrants who have settled here. If you look East Asian, service staff at many businesses may instinctively address you in Mandarin or Cantonese. If you don't speak either of those, just politely say that you don't understand, and you will be accommodated in English.

Get in[edit]
See Vancouver for options to get in the Vancouver area by plane, by bus, and by train, and by boat.

It is a short ride by taxi or on public transit using SkyTrain from the airport's Domestic and International Terminals (remember to transfer to a train heading south to Richmond Centre at Bridgeport Station).

Richmond is mostly a grid with fairly wide streets so driving around isn't a problem. Major north-south roads tend to be numbered (No. 1 Rd, No. 2 Rd, and so forth, with No. 3 Road considered the main street). Major east-west streets include Bridgeport Rd (alternate access to the airport), Westminster Highway (access to Richmond Centre, the closest thing Richmond has to a 'downtown') and Steveston Highway.

By public transit[edit]
 TransLink, ☏ +1-604-953-3333. The main public transit network in the Vancouver area. Its network includes buses, SkyTrain (rail rapid transit), SeaBus (ferries), West Coast Express (commuter rail), and HandyDART (door-to-door shared-ride service for those who cannot ride public transit without assistance).   (updated Mar 2022)
  Passengers can pay for fares using Compass Cards ($6 refundable deposit), Compass Tickets, or tap-to-pay using contactless credit cards (only American Express, Mastercard or Visa) or mobile wallets. Passengers using Compass Cards and Compass Tickets pay discounted fares. Passengers can transfer for up to 90 minutes, except if taking West Coast Express, in which case they can transfer for up to 120 minutes. On bus and HandyDART, passengers can also pay in cash, but in that case will not receive change and are not eligible for transfers.   Zone based fares apply between Monday and Friday for trips starting before 6:30PM, if travel involves SkyTrain or SeaBus. Outside of those hours or for travel on only bus or HandyDART, a single zone rate applies. If traveling by West Coast Express, a higher cost zone based fare system applies regardless of time of travel.   Children 12 and under can ride for free. People aged 13 to 18, and 65 and older pay discounted concession fares.
The standard fare (effective July 2023) to get into Richmond is $3.15 by bus and $4.55 by SkyTrain (for a two zone ticket) from most places in the Greater Vancouver area. Fares for travel within Richmond are $3.15. A trip from Vancouver International Airport to Richmond costs $8.15, consisting of $3.15 for a one-zone transit fare and $5 for an airport AddFare. This AddFare only has to be paid on trips from the airport, not on trips to the airport. You can avoid the AddFare by buying prepaid transit tickets from the 7-Eleven or Pharmasave in the bottom level of the Domestic terminal of the airport (but not standard Compass cards, which will still be charged the AddFare).

By bus[edit]
Brighouse station is the transit hub for buses within Richmond with connections to Steveston (buses #401, #402, #406, and #407), the Riverport Complex (buses #403 and #404, evening and weekend trips on bus #408) and the Buddhist temple (bus #403).
