Understand[edit]
The land around Gällivare has been inhabited by the Sami people since time immemorial. The Swedish government got their sight on Gällivare and Kiruna in the 17th century, as iron ore was discovered. Mining was done in Malmberget on a small scale (with ore pulled to the coast by reindeer), but expanded as the railway reached the city in 1888.

Get in[edit]
By rail[edit]
Inlandsbanan is a 1300 kilometer railway running south to north through the Swedish heartland, roughly half way between the coast and the Norwegian border. Though there is regular passenger traffic on the line, it mainly serves as a recreative railway with railbuses, and most ticket types give you the option to hop on and off the train as you like. It begins in Kristinehamn on the shores of Vänern, and passes the major inland cities of Mora, Östersund and Vilhelmina on the way.
Malmbanan, which literally means the Ore railway, is an important railway running between Luleå on the gulf of Bothnia and Narvik on the Atlantic coast. It's mainly used to transport Iron ore from the huge mines around Gällivare and Kiruna, but fortunately the spectacular views along the line can also be seen from several passenger trains running between the two cities, and in the summer, a daily overnight train from Göteborg and Stockholm.
By plane[edit]
Gälivare airport, also called Lapland Airport in promotional material, sees two flights per day with the small regional carrier Nextjet to Stockholm Arlanda Airport.

By car[edit]
Two European routes connects to the city.

E45, one of the longest European routes, leading northwards to Karesuando, and southwards to Gothenburg and the west coast via inland municipalities/cities like Jokkmokk, Arvidsjaur, Östersund and Mora. It then continues via ferry to/from Denmark, all the way down to Sicily (Italy).
E10, leading north to Kiruna and Narvik (Norway), and south to Överkalix, Töre and Luleå.
E10 then connects with E6 in the northern end (Narvik), and E4 in the southern end (Töre and Luleå)).

E6 stretches from the northernmost parts of Norway, Alta and Kirkenes; via Oslo and Gothenburg; to the southernmost parts of Sweden, Malmö and Trelleborg.
E4 stretches along the coast from Tornio (Finland);  via the coastal cities, Luleå, Piteå, Umeå, Skellefteå, Örnsköldsvik, Sundsvall, and Gävle; to Stockholm, then further south from Stockholm to Helsingborg.

Note that neither E45 or E10 have motorway standard in this northern region.
Traffic accidents involving reindeers, sometimes whole herds, are not uncommon.
Also, be aware of the risk of white-outs during winter: As the temperature here can drop to -40 degrees or colder, snow can become a very fine powder. This can lead to complete and sudden temporary loss of sight, caused by thick snow smoke in the draught behind heavy trucks/buses and other meeting traffic. Keep your distance.

Get around[edit]
Gällivare and Malmberget form a walkable town; though the cold weather at winter makes walking a challenge.
