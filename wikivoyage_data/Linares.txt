Map of Linares
By car[edit]
Linares is 130 km from Monterrey, the largest city in Nuevo León. From Monterrey, drive southeast on federal highway MEX-85 (Carreterra Nacional). The drive will take about 1-1/2 hours.

By bus[edit]
Many bus lines, including Grupo Senda, Noreste, Futura, and Transportes Frontera operate several daily buses to Linares and points south. Frontera and Noreste both have hourly departures, other bus lines every 2 or 3 hours. Tickets from the Central de Autobuses in Monterrey to Linares will cost about M$200 to M$400 depending on bus class and departure time.

Frequent departures to Monterrey, Ciudad Victoria, San Luis Potosi, and Mexico City. Bus lines that don't use the main bus station probably have company-specific facilities within 2 blocks of the bus station. 
Get around[edit]
Taxis and Ubers will be your best bet, though if you're sticking to the downtown Centro area you can probably get around by foot just fine. Taxis are plentiful and there are a couple of sitios on Av. Corregidora, one near 16 de Septiembre and the other near Venustiano Carranza.
