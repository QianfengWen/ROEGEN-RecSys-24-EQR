Scottsdale is a city in the state of Arizona. Scottsdale is home to many galleries, high quality resorts, and golf courses. It is also one of the wealthier parts of the Phoenix Metro Area.


Understand[edit]
It is east of Phoenix and part of the Phoenix Metro Area. High end shopping destinations are one of the primary attractions of the city. For example, the Fashion Square Mall is near downtown Scottsdale and is one of the biggest malls in the United States. The extensive galleries to the west of the downtown also offer upscale shopping and strolling. The galleries in this area display works from local artists and from around the world.

Saloons and shops in the Old Town area
The Old Town section of Scottsdale is to the east of the gallery district. It showcases the ironic attempt of Scottsdale to both embody swank upscale style as well as a caricature of the gruff American West. This part of town is undeniably kitschy. Well over half the shops are gift shops. However, it is fun enough for a browse in a Disneyland sort of way.

The canals[edit]
The valley of the sun has over 130 mi (210 km) of canals. Most of them were built in the last 100 years to provide water for the irrigation of farm land. However, now that the valley is much less agrarian the canals are primarily used to carry away storm water. Some are also used to generate hydroelectric power.
These often overlooked gems are open to the public. One can take in the beautiful desert scenery and fresh air while strolling along them. They provide walkers, joggers, and bikers with a nice refuge from traffic. But don't try swimming in the canals, aside from being an obvious bad idea because the sides are so steep it is also illegal, along with motorized vehicles.

Golf[edit]
Be sure to try one of the 200 golf courses in the Scottsdale area. Although most of the green fees are relatively high during the high season (Nov - Apr) there are a few good courses that can be played year round at a reasonable rate. Green fees are very cheap during the summer ($10 - $50 per round with cart) and if you tee-off early in the morning the heat doesn't become too bad before you finish your round.

Get around[edit]
Scottsdale is undoubtedly a car-centric place. Most of the city is too spread out to reasonably walk, far more people use their own cars than ride the bus, and the light rail does not come to Scottsdale.

By car[edit]
Scottsdale is laid out for cars. The roads are large and the parking, even downtown, is usually more than ample.
To keep the speed limits and traffic signals well enforced, the city of Scottsdale extensively uses photo radar. Residents often learn where the cameras are and slow down near them. However, sometimes they slow down a bit abruptly. Drivers are often well served by expecting this from time to time.

There are 3 types of cameras.
Intersection Cameras These cameras monitor for both speeding and the running of red lights. There will be a line painted in the intersection just past the crosswalk. This is the line that, if crossed, will trigger the cameras. There will be lights that flash in front and behind the car to get a clear picture of both the front and back of the car.  Some GPS systems will indicate that there is a red light running camera coming up, so that the driver will be aware of the camera at the intersection ahead.
Temporary Standing Cameras These monitor one side of the road and are intended to keep the speed reasonable. They generally are triggered 11 mph (18 km/h) over the speed limit.  They look like a box sitting on the sidewalk, metal, with a lens pointing out one direction near the top.  They will always have a sign posted within 100 feet (30 m) in front of the box indicating that traffic laws are 'photo enforced'.
Mobile Vehicle Cameras These are speed-monitoring cameras that sit along the side of the road. These are harder to spot because they move locations regularly and park inconspicuously.  They will always have at least one sign posted within 300 feet (90 m) of the vehicle to indicate that traffic is being photo enforced in the area.
Generally it is easiest and safest to simply drive the speed limit and not run red lights.

By foot[edit]
Getting around by walking can take a bit of planning. Not all roads have sidewalks and distances that seem reasonable can become quite uncomfortable in the warmer months.  Usually, if people visiting want to walk, the best  way to do this is to pick a place set up for walking, then drive there.  If you're in the mood for walking, see #Do/Walking tours below.

By public transit[edit]
Downtown Scottsdale has a free public transportation system of trolleys.   These modified buses come by every 15-20 minutes to designated stops along their routes, which run Monday through Friday. The routes are especially designed to help the elderly get to the senior center at Granite Reef & McDowell Roads.  
The Valley Metro public transit system is also available in Scottsdale, also there are pay-as-you-go bicycles and scooters that are in racks at many bus stops around town.  The bus, bicycles, and scooters all are paid via an app anyone can get on their phone.  Bus passes can also be paid for with cash at Circle K convenience stores.

Stay safe[edit]
Flooding[edit]
It doesn't rain very frequently in Scottsdale. However, when the rain does come many lakes swell, bike paths are submerged, and roads become impassable.
If there is a notable amount of water on the road, don't drive through it. Drivers frequently become stranded in the middle of flooded washes. Cars can be swept away in a deceptively small amount of water. As you might guess, attempting to drive across such flooded roads is dangerous.
Arizona also has what they like to call a "Stupid Motorist Law." It says that if someone drives around a barricade to enter a flooded road they will be charged for their rescue.

Heat[edit]
In the summer it can get quite hot. Dehydration, heat stroke, and sun stroke become notable risks.
Drink plenty of water and stay indoors in the afternoon, during the hottest parts of the day.
Outdoor activities are usually far more pleasant in the early morning when it is still cool. Because the temperatures in the desert swing so much between night and day, morning temperatures can be quite pleasant even during the height of the summer.
