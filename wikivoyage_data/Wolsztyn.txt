Trains are maybe not the quickest, but definitely the most interesting way to get to Wolsztyn. The town is a small railway junction with lines to Poznan, calling at Szreniawa and Grodzisk Wielkopolski, to Leszno and to Zbąszynek. There are 7 direct trains to Poznan daily - 5 of them are served with modern, air-conditioned diesel units, and two (departures from Wolsztyn around 05:00 and 13:30 and from Poznan approx. 8:30 and 17:00) are serviced by historical steam locos. There are 5 regular daily connections to a small town of Zbaszynek, which has nothing interesting for tourists, but is a crucial railway junction of the way to Berlin (several reliable, but expensive Inter-City trains daily), to Poznań (11 local trains daily + some long-distance ones), to Zielona Góra (4 daily)  and to Gorzów (5 daily).
