By car[edit]
Modena is crossed by a major road, the Via Emilia, a historic Roman road that connected Modena with other important towns and cities of the region, and that still represents one of the main traffic ways in Italy. The road runs through the middle of the town, in an east-west direction.
The historic centre of the town is a restricted area (ZTL), meaning only residents, commercial operators, or tourists staying at hotels in the centre and with a special permit can go there. Access is regulated by an automated system, named Modena City Pass, which allows local police to monitor cars and motorbikes through a network of webcams placed at access points. These webcams are always on and continuously register the number plates of passing cars, sending the information to a control and alerting system.
In other areas, parking is in part free (identified by a white line) and in part with fee (blue line); the amount of the fee depends on the city area. Payments can be made with coins by nearby park meters. On Sundays and public holidays parking is free. Alternatively, payments can be made with a prepaid card (€20), purchased at ACI (Automobil Club Italia) offices or at some tobacconists in the town centre. Parking is usually free at night (20:00-08:00).
