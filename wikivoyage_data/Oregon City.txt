Oregon City is a city of 37,000 people (2019) in the Portland Metropolitan Area.  The seat of suburban Clackamas County, it is best known as being the end of the Oregon Trail.  Several tourist attractions in the city commemorate this history.


Understand[edit]
Although Portland is the main attraction in modern-day Oregon, those making the trek from the Midwest to Oregon along the Oregon Trail in the 1840s and 1850s came to their journey's end in Oregon City, near a camp called Abernethy Green.  It was here that newly arrived settlers would camp while filing their land claims.

Dr. John McLoughlin founded Oregon City in 1829 as an outpost of the Hudson's Bay Company to take advantage of the power provided by nearby Willamette Falls.  It became the capital of the Oregon Territory for its early years (1848 to 1851), and at the time competed with nearby Portland for influence.
Today, its downtown area retains the historic character thanks to preservation of the historic houses and buildings.
