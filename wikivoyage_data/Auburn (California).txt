The Placer County Courthouse, completed in 1898
Auburn is a small city in Placer County on Interstate 80 in California.


Understand[edit]
Near the confluence of the North and East Forks of the American River are a good place to swim and drink beer. There is a picturesque old town neighborhood near the statue of a miner just off the freeway. Under the miner, there are large drainage tunnels filled with graffiti that one can explore with a flashlight.

Climate[edit]
Auburn receives hot summer weather, despite being on the western fringe of the Sierra Nevada mountain range.

38.903653-121.0831911 Auburn Railway Station, 277 Nevada Street.   (updated May 2020)
By car[edit]
Auburn is home to the intersection of Interstate 80 and California 49.  Interstate 80 goes right past the downtown area. This makes getting off I-80 rather disorientating, since you take the exit from the freeway only to suddenly find yourself in the middle of the city.  Interstate 80 goes west to Rocklin, Roseville, Sacramento, and points west. Interstate 80 goes east to Truckee, Reno, and points east. California 49 goes north to Grass Valley, Nevada City, Sierra City, and points north. California 49 goes south to Coloma, Placerville, Jackson, and points south.

By bus[edit]
Greyhound has a bus stop in nearby Colfax.

Get around[edit]
Placer County Transit does operate buses in part of Auburn, but service is limited and does not run on Sundays. It's better to rent a car, especially considering the city's topography, which varies significantly because the city is on a ridge.

By car[edit]
Auburn is harder to navigate than the cities to the southwest (Rocklin and Roseville) because Auburn is on a ridge, and not a flat one either. There are a lot of twists and turns on most of the local roads because they are going all around the houses and the steeper parts of the ridge. However, the outer, more recently developed parts of the town are generally laid out more reasonably and are on less undulating terrain than the downtown area is.

Downtown Auburn[edit]
Downtown Auburn consists of two separate districts: the historic district, which is right next to Interstate 80, and the modern district, which is to the north.
