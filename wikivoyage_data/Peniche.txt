Understand[edit]
Cruz dos Remédios

Peniche (p(ih)-NEE-sh(ih), /pɨ.ˈni.ʃɨ/), with its scenic harbour, white windmills, chapels and long sandy beaches has inspired famous artists like Maurice Boitel. 
Since ancient times Peniche has been an important fishing harbour. Besides fisheries, the economy of the Peniche municipality relies on agriculture, services and tourism. The city had a population of 16,000 in 2011, with 28,000 living in the metropolitan area.

Climate[edit]
Peniche has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate greatly moderated by the Atlantic ocean, with mild wet winters and cool dry summers. Its low day-time temperature variation and little seasonal temperature variation make it remarkably mild year-round. 
Despite its latitude in central Portugal, the city has one of the mildest winter night-time temperatures in mainland Europe.

Peniche is known for its long beaches, which are popular for recreational activities and sports such as windsurfing, bodyboarding and kite surfing. These beaches are consistently windy and have good surf breaks with Supertubos, i.e., waves forming fast and powerful tubes, considered among the best in Europe. The area has been called the "European Pipeline", after the Banzai Pipeline in Hawaii.
Peniche is one of the best surfing locations in Europe. It has beaches and breaks facing three distinctly different directions, making it a consistent destination for surfers. Home to many surf camps/schools, it annually hosts the MEO Rip Curl Pro Portugal from the World championship tour of the World Surf League (WSL) at the Supertubos beach.
