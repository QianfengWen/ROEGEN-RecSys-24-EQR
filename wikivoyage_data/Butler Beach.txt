Butler Beach is a beach town between St. Augustine Beach and Crescent Beach in the First Coast region of Florida.


Understand[edit]
The town is one of several towns on Anastasia Island, a barrier island that extends from north to south across much of St Johns County. To its west is Matanzas River, a part of the Intracoastal Waterway, while to the island's east is the Atlantic Ocean.

History[edit]
Butler Beach was founded by, developed by, and named after Frank B. Butler, who established one of the first African-American beach towns in the state during the era of segregation. The town developed as a popular beach destination during the 1940s, and Butler remained active in local politics throughout the Civil Rights era. Part of the town was reserved as a state park until his death in 1973, before it was later rededicated as a county park in 1980.

Get in[edit]
FL-A1A is the highway providing access to the park via St. Augustine Beach to the north and Crescent Beach to the south. The road passes through the town from north to south and connects it with the St. Augustine metropolitan area and the Hammock Beach/Palm Coast metropolitan area.
