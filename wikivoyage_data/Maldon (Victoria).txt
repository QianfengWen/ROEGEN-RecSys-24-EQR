Maldon is a town in Victoria's Goldfields region, known for its historic streetscapes and links to the gold rush era.

This town of about 1,500 is located 140km north-west of Melbourne in the heart of the Victorian Goldfields. The town is nestled on the slopes of Mt. Tarrengower in an agricultural, pastoral and mining district. 
Maldon was declared Australia’s First Notable Town in 1965 by the National Trust of Australia. The township and surrounding forests abound with remnants of the gold mining past, beautiful seasonal wild flowers and comfortable historic and scenic walking trails.
