Tewkesbury (pronounced "tueks-bury" or sometimes locally as "chooks-bury") is a small market town in north Gloucestershire, approximately 11 mi (18 km) north of the city of Gloucester and 9 mi (14 km) north of Cheltenham. It is renowned for its medieval streetscape and large number of timber framed buildings.


Understand[edit]

Tewkesbury is a historic market town dating as far back as the 7th century when it was an Anglo-Saxon settlement named Theocsbury. However, the main attraction is the town's role in the Wars of the Roses. The Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471 was a turning point in the war, allowing the Yorkists to eventually succeed at placing their monarch on the English throne.
The town is proud of its medieval heritage and summer visitors will notice the many banners that many of the shops and residences put up around the time of the town's medieval festival.

Orientation[edit]
Tewkesbury isn't a large town, however it's large enough to be split into distinct areas.

High Street[edit]
The High Street stretches from the roundabout with the war memorial to the Mythe bridge. Most of the town's notable shops are on this street.

Barton Street[edit]
Barton Street connects Church Street to the A438 and has the town's police station. There aren't as many businesses on this street.

Walton Cardiff/Wheatpieces[edit]
Walton Cardiff is a mostly residential area built on flood plains south of the town. It has a small retail area with a Costcutter's convenience store, Tewkesbury Fryer fish & chips and Glory Garden Chinese takeaway.

Newtown[edit]
Newtown is east of the town. It's mostly a residential strip with The Canterbury (a pub with a large weeping willow tree), the town's secondary school and a few businesses.

Northway/Ashchurch[edit]
Much like Newtown, Northway is to the east of the town and is mostly residential. However it also home to the Northway Trading Estate, which provides much of the town's income.

Tewkesbury is a fairly small town and very flat, and is therefore best explored on foot. The tourist board have placed a lot of grey signs, making it easy to find the location attractions. There are many cycle routes throughout the town, but no bicycle hire.

By car[edit]
Parking has been made more difficult in the town since the council extended the pavement on the High Street. The best free parking near the High Street is next to the Severn Ham, however it is often full especially on weekends.
If you don't mind paying there are plenty of pay and display car parks.

See[edit]
51.990192-2.1608731 Tewkesbury Abbey (Abbey Church of St Mary the Virgin, Tewkesbury), Church Street, GL20 5RZ, ☏ +44 1684 850959, office@tewkesburyabbey.org.uk. A truly beautiful building that can hold up its head in the same county as the fabulous Gloucester Cathedral. The Abbey boasts the largest Norman church tower in existence measuring 14 metres square and 45 metres high. The Abbey used to be walled and surrounded by monasterial buildings such as the cloisters, chapter house, library, dormitories, stables, kitchens and many more. If you have the time, it's worth booking a tour as the abbey has a lot of stories to tell. Free admission, but donations recommended for upkeep.   
51.991147-2.1604632 The John Moore Countryside Museum, 41 Church Street, GL20 5SN, ☏ +44 1864 297174, curator@johnmooremuseum.org. Historic museum dedicated to naturalist and writer John Moore; that is only a few hundred yards away from Tewkesbury Abbey. (updated Oct 2016)
 The Merchant House. Also the home of a sister museum known as the Merchant House, which is designed to faithfully recreate a Tudor merchant's house as it would be in that period. (updated Nov 2017)
51.9914-2.16123 Old Baptist Chapel, 63 Church St, GL20 5RZ. Renovated meeting house. Adult: £3, Concessions: £2, Child over 5: £1.   (updated Nov 2017)

Housed inside a beautiful 17th-century building is a museum dedicated to Tewkesbury as whole, covering its history as a Roman settlement to the Second World War. It is well worth visiting if you want an overall history of the town, as many attractions like to focus heavily on the Battle of Tewkesbury alone. Free, but donations requested.   (updated Oct 2016)
51.992312-2.1580615 Tewkesbury Tourist Information & Heritage Centre (Tourist Office), 100 Church Street, GL20 5AB, ☏ +44 1684 855040, tewkesburytic@tewkesbury.gov.uk. M-Sa 10AM-4PM (Easter to October 31st). The town's tourist office and gift shop. (updated Oct 2016)
51.9912-2.16286 Abbey Mill, 3 St Mary's Road, GL20 5SB. Believed to stand on 12th-century foundations but it's likely there was a mill there much earlier. It has been converted to apartments. The fictional "Abel Fletcher's Mill" in Dinah Craik's novel John Halifax, Gentleman is based on this mill and the fictional town of "Norton Bury" is based on Tewkesbury. 
51.99128-2.168167 The Severn Ham. An island to the west of the town created by the merging of the River Avon, Mill Avon and the River Severn. Best approached via Abbey Mill to appreciate some stunning medieval buildings. Walk along the Ham northwards towards the now disused Borough Mills (Healing Mills). Cross the Mill Avon via the footbridge to the town side of the Mill avon. Continue northwards appreciating the rear of the buildings. Cross the Avon Mill again at the mill. There are two bridges here: the flat one was for the railway. Continue northwards again, crossing the lock and finally to King Johns Bridge. This bridge was known until the nineteenth century as the long bridge. The causeway to the left as you climb the steps used to be marshy ground where the Avon flowed towards the Severn. Previously this was a simple wooden causeway. Although the stone bridge retains a mediaeval appearance, it has been much modified in recent centuries. When built it was probably only as wide as the pavement is now.   
 Mill Avon. A man-made cut to supply the mills with water power. It isn't known when this cut was dug though it was certainly there before the monastery so could be a Saxon or even Roman. 
 Streetscape and architecture. The mediaeval street plan with its many alleyways, courtyards and small sidestreets is virtually unchanged from its original layout and a high proportion of fine half timbered buildings remain. Abbey terrace in Church Street is of particular note. The town is built around three main streets High Street, Barton Street and Church Street. The other roads such as Oldbury Road and East street are of lesser interest to the visitor interested in the architecture of the town having been created and built on only after the enclosure of the common land known as the Oldbury after 1860. It's also worth looking up as you walk along the main streets look up especially at the building roofs. Often the frontage is of a very different age to the roof indicating that the building was refronted to the latest fashion.
