Topanga is an unincorporated community of Los Angeles County, surrounded by the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. Topanga has long been a getaway for artists and musicians, and it retains a distinct bohemian flavor, which is complemented by the outdoor enthusiasts who have escaped the urban tangle to be closer to nature. In 2020, it was home to about 8,600 people.


Get in[edit]
Topanga can be reached most directly by taking Topanga Canyon Boulevard north from Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, or south Route 101 from the San Fernando Valley. Old Topanga Canyon Road and La Tuna Canyon Road are also available, but are older and more indirect routes.

An eclectic outdoor theater in Topanga Canyon, featuring folk plays, Shakespeare, educational workshops, and concerts. Founded by actor Will Geer, who was blacklisted in the 1950s for refusing to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities and moved his family to a small plot in the canyon where his friend Woody Guthrie also had a small shack.
