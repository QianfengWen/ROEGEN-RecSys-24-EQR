Afyonkarahisar or Afyon is a city in Central Anatolia 250 km southwest of Ankara, with a population in 2020 of 245,405.  Its fortress or citadel perches on a black volcanic crag, an obvious defensive position. The area is dotted with similar volcanic plugs, and underground heat makes this a geothermal area, with many hotel spas. These and the collection of mosques around the foot of the citadel are the main reason to visit.


Understand[edit]
Afyon Castle
Afyon - kara - hisar literally means "opium black fortress". This is a large growing area for opium poppies - the open fields have been burned out to curb the illegal trade but production continues under tight control for medicinal opiates such as morphine.
Afyon produces fine marble, the Docimian Pavonazzetto variety being white with purple veins. The quarries are ugly places and the best place to admire the marble is in the many grand buildings it has gone to adorn, such as the Pantheon and St Peter's in Rome, and Hagia Sophia in Istanbul.
In 2004 the Turkish parliament decided it didn't like having a city called Opium (maybe too much confusion with YSL perfume?) and changed the name to Afyonkarahisar. "Afyon" is what it remains locally and on this page, but you might want to give it the full name when explaining your travel plans to border guards.

By train[edit]

A regional train runs from Eskişehir at 17:45 via Kütahya to reach Afyon by 21:00; the return train leaves Afyon at 07:30. Two other trains down this line only run as far as Kütahya, and trains no longer continue from Afyon to Konya.  
A YHT line under construction towards Izmir may one day bring high speed trains from Istanbul and Ankara. Don't hold your breath.
38.764130.55252 Afyon Ali Çetinkaya is the town railway station, an Art Deco structure of 1939 named for the minister of transportation of that era. It's 1 km northwest of the castle. 
Şehir Garı (City Station) 1 km west off Atatürk Blv was the terminus of trains from Izmir until it closed in 2017. The area has been redeveloped for industry, so its Ottoman chalets have been swept away.

It's reached by a 226 m climb up some 800 steps, starting from the southwest on Kale Cd above Ulu Camii; the project to build a cable-car has stalled. The site is open 24 hours free and has extensive citadel walls, cisterns and views but not much else within except trash.   
38.755130.52962 Ulu Camii (Great Mosque) near the start of the castle ascent was completed in 1277. Its roof is supported by an array of 8 by 5 wooden pillars that were originally richly carved. It's one of five world heritage listed wooden mosques in Anatolia.
