Kelsterbach, also called Kelsterbach am Main for its position on the banks of the Main River into which the Kelsterbach (Kelster Brook) flows, is in Hesse.


Understand[edit]
Although there have been settlements in the area since the stone age and some remains of a Roman villa can still be seen, Kelsterbach did not become a town until 1952 when the airport and local industries increased the population.
Due to its proximity to Frankfurt Airport, it is a center for logistics companies such as Lufthansa Systems, Nippon Express, Schenker AG, FedEx.
It is not a tourist destination in itself but a useful and not so expensive location to stay close to the airport.
