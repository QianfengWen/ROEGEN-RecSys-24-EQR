Understand[edit]
Macoupin County CourthouseCarlinville is located in the center of Macoupin County and is the county seat. Founded in 1865, Carlinville was named after Thomas Carlin, 7th Governor of Illinois and major contributor to the creation of Macoupin County. 
Carlinville is moderately famous for its collection of Sears Catalog homes. An entire neighborhood of Sears Homes was built in town by the Standard Oil Company of Indiana to house local coal mine employees. Today, 149 of the original 156 homes still exist, and is considered the largest single repository of Sears Catalog Homes in the United States.
Carlinville is also known for the Macoupin County Courthouse. Built in 1870 by and designed by Elijah E. Meyers, the courthouse was considered the largest outside of New York at the time of its construction. The courthouse is known locally as "The Million Dollar Courthouse" due to the overspending to build it. There were accusations by county residents regarding misappropriations of funds during the construction of the courthouse. Judge Loomis was accused of using stone from the courthouse to build a hotel, the Loomis House, on the square.  Judge Loomis stated he purchased the stone but never produced a bill of sales.  Another commissioner, County Clerk George Holliday, was seen leaving town by train in the middle of the night carrying a carpet bag.  Public opinion was that the bag was filled with some of the money raised for construction of the courthouse.  Holliday was never seen again and it is still a mystery as to where he went.
