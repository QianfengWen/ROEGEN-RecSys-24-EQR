Piteå, called Pite by locals, is a town in Norrbotten County in northern Sweden.


Understand[edit]
Piteå was founded in 1620 and granted city rights in 1621, with the purpose of creating a trading center in northern Sweden. Originally it was a smaller settlement by Öjebyn church, but after being destroyed in a fire it was moved to its current location on Häggholmen in 1668. The 17th century city plan still characterizes parts of the city.
During the 19th century Piteå was industrialized with a rapid economic development, particularly producing timber. The city is still dominated by the wood industry, with sawmills and papermills. The city was raided by Russian troops in 1721 and 1809. It was the residential city of Norrbotten County until 1856. In the early 20th century Piteå was still a small town with a population of some 2,500 inhabitants. After the construction of a railway, connecting Piteå with Älvsbyn, Piteå expanded rapidly.
