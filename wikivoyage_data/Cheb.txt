Cheb is a city in Bohemia in Western Czech Republic with a population of 33,500 and is close to the German border.


Understand[edit]
The name is pronounced "khep" (the first sound like a German or Scottish "ch" or a Spanish "j" not as in "Chicken" - locals will make fun of you if you make this mistake). This town is sometimes called Eger in German, which was its official name until 1945. The city features a very quaint and pretty town square and winding alleys. However, outside of the center, the city is characterized by grimy heavy industry.
