Enniskerry (Irish Áth na Sceire, "rocky ford") is a village in County Wicklow, best known for Powerscourt House, gardens and waterfall. It was created in the 1840s as a planned village for tenants of Powerscourt estate. It's also a base for exploring the Wicklow Mountains, and being within an hour's travel of central Dublin can get crowded at weekends, but suburban sprawl has been kept at bay. Enniskerry had a population of 2000 in 2022.

See[edit]
53.1849-6.18671 Powerscourt Gardens, Powerscourt Demesne, Enniskerry, ☏ +353 1 204 6000, info@powerscourt.net. Daily 9:30AM-5:30PM. The grand house is now a hotel, see Sleep. So it's the magnificent gardens you visit, looking towards the Wicklow mountains and the distant waterfall. Laid out 1860-80, their highlights include Tower Valley with the Pepperpot Tower, the Japanese gardens, the winged horse statues, Triton Lake, the pet cemetery, Dolphin Pond, walled gardens, Bamberg Gate and the Italian Garden. The gardens ticket doesn't include the waterfall. Adult €13.50, conc €11.50, child €5. (updated Jun 2024)
53.146-6.21142 Powerscourt Waterfall, Deerpark, Powerscourt A98 W0D0, ☏ +353 1 204 6000. Daily 9:30AM-5PM (to 4PM midwinter, to 7PM midsummer). The Powerscourt lands once stretched 7 km from house to here; they no longer do so but the waterfall remains part of the estate. It's not a pure drop, but a steep slope where the River Dargle cascades 121 m into a corrie etched out by glaciation. It fans out so the cataract can be seen from a great distance, year-round thanks to the rainfall on the mountains, so it's long attracted painters and photographers. In 1821 when King George IV visited, the Viscount dammed the upper river so that it would form a dramatic torrent when he and the king came to admire it. But the king lingered at dinner and didn't come, just as well as the torrent when released swept away the bridge they were to stand on. (Actually George IV didn't so much linger at dinner as gorge and sluice mightily, so the bridge was at risk from his bulk anyway.) The ticket doesn't include the estate gardens, they don't do a combi. Adult €7.50, conc €6.50, child €3.50.  (updated Jun 2024)
Powerscourt House and Gardens
53.1931-6.17023 Enniskerry village square is a triangle at a road junction, with attractive buildings from 1840 in mock-Tudor style.
53.1897-6.16874 St Patrick's Church, Enniskerry A98 F753. Su 11AM-1PM. This Church of Ireland (Protestant) church was built in 1861, funded by the 7th Viscount to replace the old Stagonil church which stood on his estate. (That old church was less convenient for parishioners once the village moved from Stagonil to Enniskerry; its ruin is hidden in the woods of the estate, and some of its masonry was re-used for the Pepperpot Tower.) The new church has attractive stained glass windows and a bosky graveyard. (updated Jun 2024)
Glencree is a scenic valley in the mountains west of Enniskerry, which frames the view of Great Sugarloaf Mountain east towards Greystones. Across the head of the valley is a military road (now R115) from Dublin to Glendalough built to hunt down fugitives from the failed rebellion of 1798, "The Year of the French". A barracks was also built here, which later became a harsh school, then a prison camp for Germans: as prisoners of war in World War I, and as internees in World War II when Ireland was neutral. Postwar it housed German and Polish war orphans. It's now the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation, opposite the German war cemetery.
53.2009-6.29255 Glencree German war cemetery (Deutscher Soldatenfriedhof Glencree), Oldboleys, Glencree. 24 hours. There are 134 graves, mostly air force and navy personnel from World War II, in a moving setting. The spy Hermann Görtz is among them: he was about to be deported at the end of the war and, fearing he'd be handed over to the Soviets, he swallowed poison. The single free-standing stone cross in the rear right hand corner of the cemetery was carved by him during his wartime internment, with the same care and skill that he'd used for sketching RAF airfields.

53.138-6.3126 Sally Gap is a pass in the mountains where the military road R115 intersects R759. Spectacular scenery here with Luggala above and Lough Tay below.

Kippure stands at 757 m / 2484 ft on the Dublin—Wicklow county boundary. It has a TV transmitter and other ugly fittings at its summit, but fine views. Most Sunday strollers use the access lane from R115 on its east flank, but feel free to struggle through bog by approaching from any other direction. Hills to its west are Seefingan (723 m) and Seelin (621 m): beware the army firing ranges if you go that way.
Other hills that you can climb near Enniskerry include Fairy Castle, Maulin, Djouce, Luggala, Gravale, Duff Hill and Mullaghcleevaun. See Bray for Great Sugar Loaf, which is further east and detached from the main chain.
The Wicklow Way is a long-distance hiking trail through these hills.
Golf: Powerscourt GC lies north of the mansion hotel, with two championship courses, the East and the West. Lots more golf towards Bray on the coast.

B&B double €280.  (updated Jun 2024)
Powerscourt Springs 3 km south of the village is a good B&B, but doesn't live up to its price or billing as a spa or "health farm".
