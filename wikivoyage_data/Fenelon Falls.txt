Fenelon Falls, "the Jewel of the Kawarthas", is a community of about 1,800 permanent residents that grew up around the 23 ft (7.0 m) waterfalls that were used to power a flour mill. Lumbering and agriculture were important for the village. Fenelon Falls is home to lock 34 on the Trent-Severn Waterway between Sturgeon Lake and Cameron Lake. It is primarily a tourist town and therefore is most active during the summer season.


Understand[edit]

History[edit]
Fenelon Falls, originally named Cameron's Falls, was renamed after the township, which was named after François de Salignac de la Mothe-Fénelon, who founded a mission on the Bay of Quinté. In 1876, the Victoria Railway reached Fenelon Falls. In 1885, construction of the lock between Cameron and Sturgeon lake began.
In 2001, the municipal governments of the Town of Lindsay and the Village of Fenelon Falls were dissolved and merged, with Victoria County, into the new City of Kawartha Lakes.

Stay safe[edit]
Blue-green algae is a toxic form of algae that can be an occasional problem in this region. Do not swim or wade in water where this algae is present, do not drink the water, and do not let pets in the water. Blooms most commonly occur in late summer and early fall. They thrive in areas where the water is shallow, slow moving and warm, but they may be present in deeper, cooler water. Dense blue-green algae blooms may make the water look bluish-green, or like green pea soup or turquoise paint. Very dense blooms may form solid-looking clumps. Fresh blooms often smell like newly mown grass, while older blooms may smell like rotting garbage.
Poison ivy is common in wooded areas. All parts of poison ivy, including the roots, contain a poisonous substance which causes an irritating inflammation of the skin of most people, the inflamed areas frequently developing blisters and accompanied by intense itchiness.
