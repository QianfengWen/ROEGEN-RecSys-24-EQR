Longford Town is the county town of County Longford. It's a quiet market town few limited attractions of its own, but it is a convenient base for visiting for several prehistoric sites.  


Understand[edit]
Corlea Trackway leads into the bog
Longphort means "ship's port" yet Longford is far from the sea, and some distance from the navigable River Shannon - its tributary the Camlin flows through town but isn't suitable for anything much bigger than a kayak. The name originally applied to Viking settlements, which always had boat access, but it became adopted into Irish as the name for any large settlement. This place was sometimes distinguished as Longfort Uí Fhearghail - Longford O'Farrell, for the local rulers. The O'Farrells ruled a small state that resisted the expansion of Norman Leinster, so Longford never acquired the stout walls, bastions and abbeys of the Norman cities. It was simply a provincial market and light industrial town, growing slowly from 1855 when the railway arrived, and in 2022 it had a population of about 11,000.
The Tourist Office is in Market Square, open M-F 9:30AM-4:30PM.

See[edit]
53.727-7.7961 St Mel's Cathedral, Deanscurragh. Neoclassical Roman Catholic cathedral built 1840-56 and named for St Mél of Ardagh (d 488), a nephew of St Patrick. It was destroyed by fire on 25 Dec 2009, but restored and reopened on 24 Dec 2014. Fittings include a Carrara marble altar, a silver tabernacle, a 2307-piped organ, and new stained glass windows.

53.612-7.8453 Corlea Trackway (Danes Road), Cartron Rd, Keenagh N39 XT18 (15 km south of town on R397), ☏ +353 43 332 2386. Apr-mid Nov: daily 10AM-6PM. In 1985 oak timbers were found in a peat-digging site; they dated to 148 BC ( in the Iron Age) and were part of a 1 km togher, a causeway across a bog. The track, suitable for carts, crossed to a small island then another section continued for 1 km to the other side. But it doesn't seem to have been a transport route, rather an aisle into the bog for some ritual purpose. It was only used for a few years then sank, and the bog conditions preserved the timber. An 18 metre stretch of it is displayed in a humid, climate-controlled hall, while the rest has been left submerged, and the bog stabilised. Free.  (updated Jan 2021)
53.847-7.6054 Aughnacliffe 25 km north of Longford is a tiny village with a striking dolmen: it looks like giant play-bricks have been balanced on each other. It's in a field 200 m east of the lane through the village. Cleenrath is another dolmen 700 m north. There are 7 ringforts around the village, the best is Sonnagh Fort 1.5 km south. "Sonnagh" means palisade and the ringforts were probably more like fortified farms.
