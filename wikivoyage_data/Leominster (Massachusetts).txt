Leominster is a town in Massachusetts.

Monument Square

Understand[edit]
Leominster Piano Case Company Building
Leominster is a former industrial town with a number of National Register of Historic Places-listed buildings that used to be factories — such as for shirts, baby carriages or piano cases — in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and also some from its earlier period as a farming community. Leominster now is a major retail center and houses some people who commute to Worcester and Boston.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
From Boston, take State Route 2 West.
From Worcester, take I-290 East and I-190 North.

Get around[edit]
On foot[edit]
Easy enough for downtown attractions.  Leominster covers a surprisingly large area though so you may discover that your destination is quite a long walk away.

By car[edit]
This is you best bet and you will likely need a car to get here any way.  Parking is easy to find and either free or very cheap.

Go next[edit]
Worcester is about 25-30 minutes' drive to the south.
Boston is an hour to the east by car without traffic, but expect to hit traffic and allow at least an extra half hour.
The state of New Hampshire is very close by to the north, and Vermont, to the northwest, is not that much further.
