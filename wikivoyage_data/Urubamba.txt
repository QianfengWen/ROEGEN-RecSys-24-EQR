Urubamba
Urubamba is a small town in Peru within the Sacred Valley of the Incas that is 48 km from Cusco.


Understand[edit]
It is calmer and less tourist-oriented than Cusco and most other towns in the Sacred Valley, although it largely lacks their historic sites. At 3000 m of elevation, it's a good place to adjust to the altitude for a day or two. The town is a crossroads from which you can change buses or colectivos for various local destinations.

Get in[edit]
By taxi[edit]
Ask your hotel to arrange a taxi, or if you pick up a taxi on the street, make sure it’s licensed. S/50-S/60.
By taxi, it is about 45 min from Cusco airport.

By shared taxi (colectivo)[edit]
Get a colectivo from the taxi terminal on Pavitos Street from early morning to 18:30. 1 hour, S/7 per person. Colectivos leave when they have four passengers. Safer, quicker and more comfortable than the bus.

By car[edit]
The city of Cusco has poor signage, congestion and no real rules of the road in operation. Get out of Cusco as quickly as possible, then enjoy the beauty of the region. Hertz, Avis, and Budget have agencies in Cusco.

By bus[edit]
From the bus terminal on Grau Street.  1½-2 hours until Cusco. Buses leave every 15 minutes from dawn until 18:30. S/3.50.

Get around[edit]
The main town is small enough to get around by foot; it's centered around the Plaza de Armas.

See[edit]
 Chichubamba. The community of Chichubamba offers a unique glimpse into the traditional ways of Andean life that have been carried on since before the Incan Empire. The agrotour in Chichubamba is a collaborative effort between the people of Chichubamba and ProPeru, a local NGO. This project supports sustainable social and economic development in Chichubamba. ProPeru has worked extensively with community members in the planning and execution of the tour.

Do[edit]
Perfect place for starting a journey to the Southern Andes.
Urubamba has an ordinary, non-touristy fruit and vegetable market that's good.
Visit Moray and Salineras.

Buy[edit]
Textiles and handicrafts are for sale as usual. The local market is a good place to try Andean produce.

Eat[edit]
Anywhere! The restaurants around town cater to locals, and are often menu places, meaning they have a set option, arroz con pollo or lomo saltado usually with sopa as a starter, all for a reduced rate usually S/3-5. If you are craving American style fair, try The Muse, right off the main plaza. Try their camote chips, superburger, and brownie with icecream.
