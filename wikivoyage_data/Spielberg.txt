Spielberg is a municipality in the Murtal district in the Austrian state of Styria.
In spite of being a small city of only around 5,400 inhabitants (2018), it contributes significantly to the tourist industry of Styria, as the community is home of the Red Bull Ring race track.


Understand[edit]
Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Spielberg and the Red Bull Ring are in close proximity to the S36 motorway, a spur road that connects the Aichfeld region to the A9 and S6 motorways. For normal visits, simply use the Spielberg exit of the S36 motorway and follow the signs for Spielberg or “Red Bull Ring”.
During major events like the Formula 1 Grand Prix or the Moto GP, different traffic patterns may be used to cope with the high amount of vehicular traffic, and to provide sufficient parking. Access to the residential areas is very limited during this time and only possible with invitation of a resident.

By train[edit]
Spielberg has its own 47.1996114.795721 train station Spielberg in the district of Pausendorf. This station is only served by local trains and has no further public transit connection. However the neighbouring city of Knittelfeld has the 47.2153914.837432 Knittelfeld train station, also served by intercity train services running between Vienna and Villach. Intercity trains operate every two hours and local train services operate hourly. Transport from Graz requires the change of trains either in Bruck/Mur or Leoben.

By plane[edit]
The next regularly served airports are Graz, Vienna and Salzburg. If you are wealthy enough though, you might also land your private jet at 47.210114.74963 Fliegerhorst Zeltweg, the main military airport of Austria, that opens for private jets during major events in Spielberg.

Red Bull Ring[edit]
The Red Bull Ring was opened in 1969 as the Österreichring, and was known as the GP Austria in Zeltweg in the 1970s. It was only from 1997 to 2003 that the circuit became the A1-Ring. After lengthy renovations, it was reopened on May 15, 2011. The venue itself is also often refererred to simply as "Spielberg", as this is a clever joke with the German word Spiel meaning "play" or "game" and Berg meaning "mountain".
What started as simple race track has meanwhile developed into a year-round attraction providing a wide set of activities mainly focused on motorsports.
