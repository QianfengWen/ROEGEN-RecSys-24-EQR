The 18th century Pulteney Bridge by Robert Adam
Bath is a historic Roman and Georgian spa city. It is famous for its hot springs, Roman period baths, Medieval heritage and stately Georgian architecture. Bath has been double UNESCO-listed as a World Heritage Site, both in its own right (in 1987) and as one of 11 "Great Spa Towns of Europe" (in 2021). Set in the rolling Somerset countryside on the southern edge of the Cotswolds, Bath (with a population around 90,000) offers a diverse range of attractions for its 4.4 million visitors each year: restaurants, theatres, cinemas, pubs and nightclubs, along with interesting museums, and a wide range of guided tours. It is also a university city.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Bath is among the oldest of England’s principal tourist destinations and has been welcoming visitors for centuries. The three hot springs within the city were sacred to the Celtic goddess Sulis, whom the Romans later identified with the goddess Minerva. Bath first achieved its status as a sacred spa site with the growth of the Roman settlement Aquae Sulis around the thermal springs. The Roman period saw a vast complex of baths constructed - the remains of these were re-discovered in the 18th century and helped fuel Bath's modern revival as a luxury resort.
Bath was a prosperous city in the Medieval period, the site of an Abbey and Cathedral (under the Bishop of Bath and Wells). The Reformation under Henry VIII created uncertainty for Bath's, although during the reign of Elizabeth I, the town was revived as a spa resort. It was during the Georgian period, however, that Bath came again into its own. Exceedingly fashionable, Bath was laid out in stately avenues, streets and crescents, encrusted with Neo-Classical public buildings.
Bath suffered a significant amount of damage during air raids in World War II. The prestigious crescents and terraces were relatively unscathed and restored where necessary, but some of the more minor Georgian and Victorian streets were demolished both after the war and during a later ill-conceived phase of development known now as the "Sack of Bath". Consequently some modern buildings pop up in unexpected places, and the locals are generally very opposed to any major building developments that are put forward. Those works are substantially complete, and a new shopping centre near the railway station has opened.

Orientation[edit]
Bath is 160 km (100 miles) west of London and 18 km (11 miles) south-east of the nearest big city, Bristol. It lies in the valley of the Avon River, upstream of Bristol.

Read[edit]
See also: Jane Austen tourism
Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey is traditional reading before a visit to Bath.  Austen spent some time there, and her novel is a satire of the social life of the city at the time. Many of the sites she mentioned are still able to be visited in the city today.

By plane[edit]
Regional airports[edit]
These smaller airports provide a much more sedate experience than the London ones. Check in queues are shorter, there are fewer people about, and it's much clearer where you have to go and what you have to do. Less stress and fewer delays than the London ones.
Bristol Airport (BRS IATA) is 35 km (22 mi) from Bath and boasts scheduled flights from many major European cities, including Amsterdam Schiphol, Barcelona El Prat, Berlin, Brussels, Copenhagen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Paris and Prague (but not London). By public transportation there are three main options for reaching Bath.

Catch the Flyer bus service from the airport to Bristol Temple Meads station, then the train from there to Bath; expect the journey to take about one hour, and longer between 4PM and 6PM when Bristol's roads are congested.
Air Decker direct bus from the airport to Bath railway station. Every thirty minutes from early until late. Journey time is about 55 minutes. Single ticket £16.50, return £22.00.
Taxi (about £40) and get to Bath in about 40 minutes.
Southampton Airport (SOU IATA) is under 2 hours from Bath by train, and connections are good.
Cardiff Airport (CWL IATA), Exeter Airport (EXT IATA), and Bournemouth Airport (BOH IATA) are also served by low-cost airlines and are within a couple of hours driving distance of the city.

London airports[edit]
The alternative is to use one of the London airports and travel on to Bath by train, car or bus. The most convenient are:

Heathrow Airport is about two hours drive straight down the M4 (westbound) motorway. Alternatively, the RailAir express bus service (running every 20 minutes) connects with the main London to Bath rail service at Reading rail station; expect the total journey to take slightly over two hours. Or take the train the entire way, hop on the Heathrow Express to Paddington Station and then take a train from there to Bath Spa railway station, the journey takes a little under two hours. Alternatively, the National Express coach company run direct buses from Heathrow to Bath bus station.
Gatwick Airport is about three hours drive away via the M23 (northbound), M25 (clockwise) and M4 (westbound) motorways. Alternatively, a half-hourly rail service from Gatwick connects with the main London to Bath rail service at Reading rail station; expect the total journey to take slightly over two hours.
Stansted Airport is about three hours drive away via the M11 (southbound), M25 (anti-clockwise) and M4 (westbound) motorways. By train, you will need to catch a Stanstead Express train to London Liverpool Street station, the tube to London Paddington station, then follow the directions below; expect the total journey to take around 3½ hours.
Luton Airport is about a 3-hour train ride. The Thameslink rail connects the airport to central London where you can catch a train to Bath Spa.

51.3775-2.35641 Bath Spa railway station, Dorchester Street, BA1 1SU. A Victorian station on the Great Western Railway designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The station is in the city centre. It has regular inter-city and regional train services from Bristol, London, Reading, Salisbury, Southampton, Weymouth and Swindon. From London, you should travel from London Paddington station, trains run approx every 30 minutes, journey time about 1 hour 30 minutes.   (updated Aug 2022)
Train times (from any location) can be found on the National Rail Planner or by calling +44 8457 484950 from anywhere in the UK. There is a taxi rank outside the station, and the bus station is adjacent.
The station is staffed M-Sa 6M-8PM, Su 7:45AM-8PM, however the ticket office will only sell advance tickets between 8AM and 6PM (ignore the times on the National Rail website: they are wrong) There are no luggage lockers in the station; Bath Backpacker's Hostel in Pierrepont Street, which is a few hundred feet from the station, will look after left luggage for the day for £3.00.
51.3792-2.38072 Oldfield Park railway station, Brook Road, BA2 3RS. A stop in a residential suburb about a mile from Bath Spa in the Bristol direction. Don't leap off the train here with all your luggage thinking you're in the middle of town!   (updated Aug 2022)

By bike[edit]
The Bristol-Bath Railway Path is part of the National Cycle Network (R4) and provides a cycle corridor between the city centres of Bath and Bristol. Travel time is about 90 minutes. The path is relatively flat, and has only 2 road crossings, making it very safe. In the morning and evening it is a busy commute route, so it may be advisable to avoid these peak hours.

By car[edit]
Get off the M4 at Junction 18, follow signs for about 10 miles (16 km). Use the Park-and-Ride facilities!
It is very easy to get lost in Bath, as a lot of it is one-way and there's a traffic system that prevents you driving from one side of the city to the other. You have to go out on an unofficial ring road and re-enter the city. Furthermore, the high population density, the lack of a city bypass and the low capacity of the old narrow streets means that congestion is often horrendous. In particular, on Saturdays the car parks will all be full, and the roads will be blocked by people queueing to get into these car parks, a problem made worse since the opening of the new Southgate car park. At peak times, it can be quicker to walk from the edge of Bath to town, rather than driving and finding somewhere to park. The short answer - don't drive in Bath.
Parking in central Bath is better than it used to be as there's a big new underground multi story under the Southgate Shopping Centre. Most of the smaller long stay car parks will be full by 8:30AM during the working week so you have to get in early. Major central multi-storey car parks are based underneath the Southgate Shopping Centre, Walcot Street, Manvers Street (near the train stations) and Charlotte Street (off Queens Square). Average 2010 rates are around £3 an hour - or the more prohibitive pay and display in central bath at £1.30p per 30 minutes in the most convenient street locations. Many parking bays are "residents parking only" so check before leaving your car. Traffic wardens are very efficient so don't even think of parking on a yellow line or going over your time limit. On Sundays and between 7PM and 8AM other days most parking is free, however check machines for exact details.
The best way to drive into town is to use the park and ride facilities when travelling into Bath for the day. You can park for free and then take a bus for £2.20 per adult return (round-trip, discounts exist) right into the city. The only downside to this is that the last bus leaves at 8:30PM, so you can't use this service if you're staying in Bath late.

By bus[edit]
51.37793-2.359643 Bath's bus station is close to the railway station and buses to most destinations outside the city leave and arrive at this location. It is served by:

 National Express. Coaches to Bristol, London Victoria and London Heathrow. 
 First West England.  operates buses locally and from bath to Bristol, Lawrence Hill, Hengrove, Weston-super-Mare, Wells and points in between in West England.

Most locations in Bath are easily walkable from the city centre and stations. Avoid using a car in town centr.

By foot[edit]
Some of Bath's shopping streets feel like pedestrian-only areas - but aren't. Have a quick look round before you follow everyone else out into the road and, if you're driving, expect pedestrians to walk out in front of you.

By public bus[edit]
Typically for British public transport, public buses are at best adequate. A popular 'Park and Ride' bus system operates from a ring of car parks around the outskirts of the city (Newbridge, Lansdown, Claverton Down and Odd Down). They will take you to the city centre, or to a number of the cities schools. Bath's buses are often quite expensive, compared with other cities. If you are going to be taking more than 1 return journey or 1 single journey in a day, it is recommended to ask the driver for a day pass instead which gives unlimited travel on that bus company's buses in Bath. This costs around £3.70 per day. There are several bus companies operating, such as WessexConnect and FareSaver, but the most useful for tourists will be buses operated by First.

By tourist bus[edit]
Tour buses complete an enjoyable circuit of main attractions; they can be picked up en route or at the main bay at 'Bog Island' (for the Skyline tour) or next to the fountain near Bath Abbey (for the city centre tour). When you see something you like just hop off at the next stop, have a look round, and hop back on the next one that comes along. Attractions en route include the historic Royal Crescent, The Circus - and some tour bus companies include a route up the winding Ralph Allen Drive past the impressive Prior Park Gardens. Tickets cost £11.50 for the 40-minute Skyline tour of the 45-minute City Centre, hop-on, hop-off service.

By taxi[edit]
There are taxi ranks outside the train station and the Abbey, and Kingsmead square. Taxi firms are well advertised locally. The drivers know the city well and will entertain you with (often cranky) stories.

51.386944-2.3683335 Royal Crescent, 1 Royal Crescent, BA1 2LS. A magnificent semi-elliptical crescent of houses designed by John Wood and completed in 1774. This was the first of Bath's eight crescents, and its shape remains unique. You can visit one of the houses which has been redecorated to resemble what it would have been like at the end of the 18th century. But you don't need to go in to admire the exterior and its view over Bath. There is also a large semi-circular lawn out the front owned by the Royal Crescent residents. It is separated from Victoria Park by a ha-ha (a recessed landscape design element that creates a vertical barrier while preserving an uninterrupted view of the landscape beyond).   
 Bath's other crescents. Georgian architecture at its best can be seen at Bath's handful of crescent shaped, residential streets, offering superb views over the city. The Royal Crescent is the most famous, but Camden Crescent offers the best views, Cavendish Crescent is the most petite. Lansdown Crescent and Widcombe Crescent are also fine examples.

Concerts[edit]
Not many of these. Bath hasn't really got a suitable venue. Bands sometimes play at the Pavilion, or the Rugby Ground but it's a poor show from the city that once held the Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music. Some major classical events are held in Victoria Park but they're far from frequent.
Jazz music every Thursday and other live music occasionally at St James' Wine Vaults in the north of town near the Royal Crescent. The Bell Inn on Walcot Street has live music on Monday and Wednesday evenings and Sunday lunchtime, always free and busy.
The city is pretty good for local and up-and-coming bands, though, as well as street musicians.

 Moles. A live music club. (updated Apr 2016)

Get wet[edit]
Bath is the only place in Britain where you can bathe in hot natural waters. You can't leap into the Roman Baths but you can pamper yourself at the Thermae Bath Spa across the road. The "Thermae Bath Spa" is a modern spa in the heart of Bath one block over from the original Roman Baths. It is a four-storey day spa, that uses the "healing waters" to sooth and relax. The waters are filtered but remain warm in the indoor and outdoor roof pool. A great way to spend an afternoon or evening relaxing in the warm waters looking out over the city architecture. They offer everything from massages to a "kraken stove" steam bath but just spending a couple of hours soaking in the indoor pool, steam baths and roof deck outdoor pool is great fun.

51.38037-2.361576 Thermae Bath Spa, The Hetling Pump Room, Hot Bath Street, BA1 1SJ.   
Read a detective novel set in Bath[edit]
Two authors have written a series of detective novels set in the city: Christopher Lee's started with The Killing of Sally Keemer and Peter Lovesey's first was The Last Detective. You can buy them in 51.38355-2.361781 Waterstone's bookshop at the top of Milsom Street.

Learn[edit]
Bath is home to the University of Bath, a very well respected institution that focuses on the sciences, engineering and social sciences. Bath University has world-class sports facilities used by British Olympic athletes. It is located at the top of Bathwick hill, about one mile east of the city centre.
Bath acquired its second university, called Bath Spa University, in 2005. The main campus is in a rural setting at Newton Park to the west of the city.
As with most tourism-heavy cities in the United Kingdom, Bath has a selection of language schools, and colleges for international students. Some of these institutions include International House [dead link] and Bath Academy.

Work[edit]
The Ministry of Defence was a major local employer until 2012. The city has a large technology, finance, and property sector. Outside that Bathonians are generally employed in lower paid tourist, retail and dining industries. The universities and hospital are also large employers. Future Publishing, a large magazine and media company, has many offices in Bath.

Buy[edit]
The 2010 Southgate Shopping Centre is constructed in a mock Georgian style and features a selection of mid-to-upper range clothing chains plus some pretty good places to eat. It is opposite the railway and bus station but offers little of interest for the tourist as it provides predominantly mainstream retailers available in many high streets in Britain. This was a historic area up until the 1960s when it was demolished due to persistent flooding problems.
Boutique shopping can be found in the North part of the centre, notable for its art and antique showrooms. Head up Milsom Street to George Street and beyond. Bath claims to have one of the highest percentages of independent shops in any British high-street.
Walcot Street to the north-east of the centre has been designated the "artisan quarter" by the Council and has a number of independent stores.

Eat[edit]
For its size, Bath has an excellent choice of eateries for any budget and taste. Mainstream restaurant chains are present as well as many independents. Within the city centre there are Italian, French, Thai, Nepali, Indian, Spanish, Turkish, Japanese and fusion restaurants. There are also specialist fish, steak, and gourmet restaurants. Most pubs sell food at lunchtime and in the evening.

Nightclubs[edit]
Considering the size of this small city there are a reasonable number of nightclubs to be found, in no small part helped by the city's substantial student population. Most club nights cater to mainstream tastes, while serious clubbers tend to travel further afield to the larger cities of Bristol and London. Posters and fliers advertising more specialist nights can be found in locations such as the walls inside the town's independent fast food outlets. A unique aspect (for better or for worse) of Bath's nightclubs is that many of them are located in the cellars of old Georgian buildings and can weave through the ground like mazes.

51.37895-2.3572221 The Second Bridge, 10 Manvers St, BA1 1JQ (Bottom of town near the police station), ☏ +44 1225 464 449. One of the city's most popular destinations after pre-drinking around town. Popular with students.

Locals generally head for a drink in The Porter (next door) before heading to Moles later in the evening. Tuesday's 'The Big Cheese' (known as 'cheesy Tuesdays') is Bath's longest running club night. 
Water[edit]
You can drink the hot Bath mineral water in the Roman Baths, towards the end of the exhibition, and it is included in the cost of admission. Otherwise, one can purchase a sip of the mineral water from the Pump Rooms in the Abbey Churchyard, served from a fountain in the restaurant area for about 50p. Both water sources are filtered. The experience is unforgettable: it has a unique taste due to the minerals that the Romans believed had health benefits for the drinker.

Stay safe[edit]
Overall Bath is a very safe city to visit; the large number of tourists and university students generates a friendly and vigorous feel to the city. Bath city centre is lively and bustling until late on Friday and Saturday evenings, although things get rougher around kicking out time late at night. Women would be well advised to avoid wandering around alone at night. The common problem for tourists is the occasional groups of homeless beggars around the parks and abbey - you may see them drinking lager and shouting abuse, which can surprise many first-time visitors. However, they're not pushy when asking for money, and argue amongst themselves rather than getting passers-by involved. Accept it as a byproduct of a city that attracts tourism (and therefore money), and it's no problem.
The river between Pultney Bridge and the weir looks good for a spot of swimming when you're young and fit. It is actually very dangerous, and every year people die doing it. Warleigh weir is good if you're looking for a swim - about 3 miles along the canal.
If you're a keen cyclist, there's a wonderful Bath-to-Bristol cycle path at your disposal. However, please be aware that there have been robberies and attacks on this stretch of cycle path in 2008. Police have made arrests, but it's something you should consider if planning to make the journey.

Go next[edit]
Bradford on Avon — a beautiful, picture-postcard small town near Bath; it's accessible by rail and there's a lovely 30-minute walk along the canal to Avoncliff where the Cross Guns pub provides good food in an excellent riverside setting - and you can catch the train back to Bath from there. Trains between Bath Spa and Bradford on Avon take 15-20 minutes and run 2-3 times an hour.
Bristol — with its many attractions situated around the floating harbour and Avon Gorge, is 12 miles drive or 15 minutes train journey away, and makes an excellent day trip from Bath.
Swindon — known for its history as the heart of the Great Western Railway, 20 minutes on the train, or an hour by car on A46 and M4 motorway.
