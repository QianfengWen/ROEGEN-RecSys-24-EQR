Mocorito is a small colonial-era town in the western state of Sinaloa, Mexico. It is known for its literary and artistic traditions with a number of noted poets, muralists, and song-writers counting Mocorito as their home. The town is one of Mexico's Pueblos Mágicos and is a popular weekend getaway for Mazatlan residents.


Understand[edit]
The first Spanish to arrive in Mocorito came in 1531, but the town considers its founding to be 1594, when Jesuit missionaries came to settle in the area and build the town's first church (Parroquia de la Inmaculada Concepcion). The town has about 5400 residents (2015).

Mocorito considers itself a town where the arts thrive. There have been several musical success stories from Mocorito, but none bigger than Los Tigres del Norte, who have fans everywhere. Several other local bands in the current era have also become successful with the norteño and banda styles. In the visual arts, Mocorito is home town of Ernesto Rios, a muralist who is best known regionally where he has produced large-scale works in public spaces of Culiacan and Guamúchil.

Get in[edit]
The nearest city served by commercial flights is Los Mochis (LMM IATA).
Mocorito is 120 km southeast of Los Mochis. It takes about 90 minutes to drive via federal highway MEX-15. Renting a car and driving during daylight hours only is the best approach as security issues are a concern once you get outside Los Mochis.

By bus[edit]
From Los Mochis, ACN Autobuses[dead link] operates one daily bus to Guamúchil, which is 15 minutes by taxi to Mocorito. The ACN bus trip takes 90 minutes and tickets cost about M$100. It's a night bus: the bus departs Los Mochis at 02:40 and arrives in Guamuchil about 04:10.

Get around[edit]
Map of Mocorito
Mocorito is a small town. It is easy to navigate by foot and distances are short. For longer trips, you can find taxis available near the zocalo (Plazuela) or ask your hotel desk staff to call one for you. Ride hailing apps generally don't work in Mocorito, and even if they did, some governments advise their citizens against using such apps in the state of Sinaloa for security reasons.

See[edit]
Friday night concert in la Plazuela
25.483955-107.9210321 Plazuela Miguel Hidalgo (Zocalo), Ignacio Zaragoza, Centro. The town square is a lively urban park with tall trees, careful landscaping, brick walkways, benches to sit and peoplewatch, a bandstand that's actually used for occasional concerts in the park, and of course, the colorful letters inviting visitors to snap an Instagram-worthy photo. Great place to relax on a warm evening, strolling and enjoying the ambience. 
Parroquia de la Inmaculada Concepcion
25.483645-107.920122 Parroquia de la Inmaculada Concepción (Church of the Immaculate Conception), Ignacio Zaragoza 2, Centro. Unusual historic church with a unique blend of architectural styles and some stunning artworks inside. Jesuit missionaries established the parish and began building the church in 1598. From the front it appears austere and is sometimes described as a militaristic style. It's built of pink granite (cantera) with brick and other stones and has a relatively unadorned facade graced with a single very tall belfry a prominent triangle shape over the entrance, and a long, narrow nave. The church is known for a series of excellent 16th century engravings that adorn its 14 stations of the cross. 
25.485408-107.9228883 Museo De Historia Regional De Mocorito (Regional History Museum), Hidalgo 39, Candilejas. Small historical exhibit focusing on the town of Mocorito and its nearby areas. Few exhibits, mostly photos and graphic arts. Interesting local flavor that won't take much time to visit. 
25.48535-107.9210754 Museo de Los Tigres del Norte, 16 de Septiembre 129, Bugambilias. One of the most popular acts in the Mexican music world is Los Tigres del Norte. The group has stayed together for more than 50 years. During that time, they've sold well over 30 million albums, packed concert halls in Mexico, the United States, and many other countries, won 7 Grammy awards and 12 Latin Grammies, and appeared in dozens of motion pictures. Their style of music is known as norteño and within that broad genre they've managed to carve out some niches in which they dominate. They are particularly known for a class of songs called narcocorridos that tell the tales of prominent figures in the underworld of international drug trafficking (a popular pasttime in Sinaloa). Visit the museum to learn more about the group, their rise to fame and fortune, and their roots in the small town of Mocorito. 
25.482963-107.9213925 Hemiciclo y Mural de Mocorito (Rafael Buelna Square), Benito Juarez 3. In the square, you'll find a bright, colorful mosaic mural titled Mocorito Ateneo Sinaloense that is a montage of scenes depicting the town's 400-year history and its modern culture. 
Do[edit]
25.484518-107.9217291 Napo Chilorio Factory, Francisco Madero 55, Bugambilias. The town's favorite dish is a stew of shredded pork, slow-simmered with chiles and spices. Many restaurants serve up homemade versions, but it's also packaged in cans and shipped across Mexico. Stop in and see chilorio being made and packaged. 
25.487049-107.9208682 Campo de Girasoles (Sunflower Field), Gral. Gabriel Leyva, Bugambilias. Thousands and thousands of sunflowers fill a field. Great spot for an Instagram selfie! There are photo op spots that look kind of hokey and tractor rides for the kids. 
Festivals[edit]
Carnaval - sometime in late February or early March (before the period of Lent begins), people get together to blow off steam, drink too much and eat way too much. In Mocorito, there are various crownings of kings and queens, a huge parade and a big dance on the final night.
Celebration of the Immaculate Conception - the official feast day is December 8, but events and celebrations occur throughout the month of December
Buy[edit]
Shops in Mocarito sell some interesting local handcrafts that you might not find elsewhere. The region is known for wood objects, particularly Guazuma-wood figurines and handmade furniture. Basket weaving and items made with palm fronds are produced by indigenous groups, and there are ceramic items produced in the region.

Eat[edit]
Most Pueblos Mágicos emphasize regional cuisine, and Mocorito is no exception, but in Mocorito, there's one most important word to know: chilorio. Chilorio is served throughout Sinaloa, but Mocorito claims to be the origin of the dish and is where it's embraced and revered as an art form. Chilorio can be described as a "pork stew", but that hardly does justice to its deep rich flavor that's delivered through a blend of ground guasillo chile, cumin, and garlic. Chilorio can be eaten as a main course but is typically served as tacos with either corn or flour tortillas accompanied by either fresh sliced or lightly sauteed onions. 
Besides chilorio, the town has several bakeries selling a range of cookies and pastries. Try the mestiza if you like a touch of licorice flavor, or maybe the meringue treats known as suspiros.
