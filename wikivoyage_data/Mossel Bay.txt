Mossel Bay beaches
Mossel Bay  is a small harbour town situated on the Garden Route in the Western Cape. A favourite coastal and holiday destination, it has over the years developed into a town of unhurried hospitality, complementing the natural beauty and rich cultural history of the District of Eden. It was here that the first Europeans set foot on southern African shores – commemorated at the Da Gama Museum Complex in the town-centre. Washed by the warm waters of the Indian Ocean, Mossel Bay offers sandy beaches stretching into the horizon, whale watching in season (June – mid November), water sport and extreme adventures. The Bay of Attraction, as Mossel Bay is often referred to, is also a paradise for any shopper hunting for local art and craft or maritime objects, and a hub for good entertainment and exquisite dining on the Garden Route.


Get in[edit]
By road[edit]
Mossel Bay is situated along the Garden Route, connected with the N2 and therefore easily reached from Cape Town in the west, George in the east, and Oudtshoorn in the north. the Minibus taxi rank is at the corner of R102 and Mossel street. There are Minibus taxis going to Cape Town.

By train[edit]
There is a daily train to George via Hartenbos, Great Brak River and Little Brak River.
This service will only operate as long as the regular Outeniqua Choo Tjoe train between George and Knysna is suspended (due to severe flooding and landslides in 2006).

By plane[edit]
Scheduled flights serving the Garden Route region use the George Airport (GRJ IATA), which is 40 km east of Mossel Bay's CBD and is owned and managed by the Airports Company of South Africa (ACSA). George Airport offers scheduled flights to and from Cape Town International Airport, Durban's King Shaka International Airport, and Johannesburg's O.R. Tambo International Airport.
Mossel Bay Airfield is certified by the South African Civil Aviation Authority for use by non-scheduled flights and private planes.  Air traffic is controlled by George Airport.
Facilities: control tower, taxiways, runway lights, fueling facilities, and complimentary tie-down facilities.  The airfield is the home of the Mossel Bay Aero Club, which has a clubhouse lounge with bar and kitchen, restaurant facilities & braai (BBQ) areas for members' and guests' use.  Fixed wing and Helicopter Flight training as well as tandem skydiving are offered.

By boat[edit]

The Port of Mossel Bay is the smallest commercial harbour on the South African coast.  It caters mostly for the oil industry (off-shore gas was discovered in late 1980s), and for a small fishing fleet.
