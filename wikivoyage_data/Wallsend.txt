Wallsend on Tyne is a town in Tyne and Wear in the northeast of England. It's industrial, with a population of almost 44,000 in 2011, and lies four miles east of Newcastle upon Tyne. It got its name as the eastern end of Hadrian's Wall. 


Understand[edit]

Wallsend was actually "wall's beginning" as Hadrian's Wall was built from here westwards from 122 AD. The town was a crossing point on the Tyne and small port, large enough for the Danes to raid, nevertheless small until the industrial era. Then it grew into a busy noisy place, with coal-mining and ship-building. Walsall Colliery was active 1778-1935: an early manager was John Buddle who helped develop the Davy Lamp, and better ventilation and drainage of pits. But the pits remained dangerous and in 1835 a gas explosion cost 109 lives: the dead were found with their cloth caps stuffed in their mouths to try to keep out the fumes. The youngest victim was eight and the oldest was 75. 
Swan Hunter was the best known of the Wallsend shipyards, launching the liner Mauretania in 1906. Other notable launches were Turbinia (1894) the world's first turbo-charged steam vessel, Carpathia (1902) which rescued the survivors of Titanic, Svyatogor (later Krassin) the icebreaker and polar exploration ship, and Ark Royal the aircraft carrier in 1981. Ship-building ended in 2007 in the face of foreign competition, but oil rig work continues.

Get in[edit]
Metro signage in English and Latin
For inter-city travel by air, rail or bus see Newcastle upon Tyne. Change in the city centre for the Tyne and Wear Metro or bus out to Wallsend, details below.
Some local buses run to Wallsend bypassing the city centre: 

Go Northeast[dead link] Little Coaster 42A runs hourly from the airport via the northern burbs, taking 80 min to Wallsend. It's quicker to take the Metro.
Little Coaster 42 runs hourly from Cramlington.
Little Coaster 11 runs every 30 min from Whitley Bay via North Tyneside Hospital and North Shields.
54.99-1.5321 Wallsend Metro and bus station is south side of town centre on Station Rd A186.
By road, use A19 which bypasses Newcastle to the east via the Tyne Tunnel, the north end of which emerges two miles east of Wallsend. The toll for a car in 2021 was £1.90: there's no cash booth, pay online or at a Paypoint outlet by midnight the next day. Regular users should open an account, which is cheaper and collected by ANPR. The tunnel has long tailbacks during rush hour, but trying to use A1(M) in rush hour instead (which bypasses to the west) incurs just as much grief. 
Cycles and pedestrians may not use the A19 tunnel but have a separate pair of tunnels, no toll, see South Tyneside#Get around. Its entrance is off A187 just south of the vehicle tunnel entrance.

Hadrian's Wall footpath starts at Segedunum and heads west along the river bank - use OS Landranger Map 88. The route is entirely modern for its first 14 miles, with a cycleway, until Heddon-on-the-Wall. The Roman wall followed the line of A187 into Newcastle then A186 / A69 west but is completely obliterated by the city. No point hiking east of Segedunum as the lower riverbank is all industrial and dockland until you reach Tynemouth and the North Sea coast.

ASDA by the Metro and bus stations is open M-Sa 6AM-11PM, Su 10AM-4PM.
