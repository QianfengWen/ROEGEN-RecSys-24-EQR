The closest commercial service is to Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT IATA), which is approximately 40 miles northeast of Wheeling in Western Pennsylvania.

By car[edit]
Ft. Henry Bridge from Wheeling Hill
Interstate 70 is the primary route for reaching Wheeling from the east or west. Travelers in Northern Ohio and Western Pennsylvania can reach Wheeling via OH Route 7 or WV Route 2. Wheeling can be reached from Southern Ohio and Southern West Virginia via WV Route 2, or Interstate 79 and Interstate 77 for points further south. U.S. Route 250, U.S. Route 40, and WV Route 88 are other major highways that pass through Wheeling.

40.0702-80.72732 Wheeling Suspension Bridge. The first bridge to span the Ohio River, built in 1849 with a length of 1,010 feet, which was largely responsible for the influx of people to the area. At the time of its construction, it was the largest suspension bridge in the world, although that title was quickly usurped in 1851 by the Lewiston-Queenston Bridge. It remains, however, the oldest vehicular suspension bridge still in use.

Get around[edit]
Map of Wheeling

Wheeling is a small city, so transportation options are limited.

By car[edit]
Car is by far the most efficient way to get around Wheeling.  Traffic in Wheeling is non-existent, outside of congestion related to road construction or vehicle accidents, so driving through Wheeling can be accomplished with a great deal of ease.
Interstate 70 runs east to west through the city, and provides primary access to all of the area's major roadways.  I-70 enters the city by crossing a back channel of the Ohio River at  Wheeling Island (Exit 0), providing access to U.S. Route 40, and the Wheeling Island Racetrack & Casino.  I-70 then crosses the main channel of the Ohio River, entering downtown Wheeling, and then continues east through Wheeling Tunnel.
U.S. Route 40 (Old National Road) is the main commercial thoroughfare in Wheeling, traveling east to west through the city, and has several interchanges with I-70.  State road 2 is Wheeling's primary north to south road, running roughly parallel to the Ohio River the entire length of the city.  Route 2 is a limited-access freeway south of downtown, and becomes a two-lane surface street north of downtown.  Interstate 470 is a spur to I-70 that begins in the Elm Grove section of the city (Exit 5A), and spurs south, crossing the Ohio River in the South Wheeling section of the city, and merging with I-70 outside of St. Clairsville, Ohio (Exit 219).

By bus[edit]
 Wheeling-Ohio Valley Regional Transportation Authority, ☏ +1 304 232-2190. A local public bus system operates daytime bus service through most of the city, but service times and frequency are very limited.  
By taxi[edit]
Wheeling's primary taxi company is Yellow Cab, and they can be reached at ☏ +1 304 232-1313.
