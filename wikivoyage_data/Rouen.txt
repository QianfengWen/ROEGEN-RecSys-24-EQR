Rouen is the capital of the French region of Upper Normandy on the River Seine, 135 km (approximately 90 minutes drive) northwest from the centre of Paris. The city has a population of 110,000 and its metropolitan area includes some 666,000 inhabitants (2017). It is where Joan of Arc was burnt at the stake, but the main reason for visiting is its incredible cathedral that inspired Monet to paint over 30 canvases. Rouen was the home of the author, Gustave Flaubert.


Understand[edit]
Rouen was for a long time France's second city, after Paris, which explains the richness of the town's artistic heritage. It has hosted many famous French writers, including Victor Hugo, Guy Maupassant, and Gustave Flaubert, among others. Today, it deserves a visit for its monuments, Gothic art being particularly well represented, but also for the charm of its alleyways and the many half-timbered houses there are.
The town is on the right bank of the River Seine, but today, includes the left bank (the Saint-Sever area in particular, on the south of the river), and the Île Lacroix.

By car[edit]
From Paris, Rouen is approximately an hour and a half's drive (135 km) north-west from the centre of the French capital, the fastest route including the A13 motorway (note: this a toll road). An alternative route would include the N14 slightly further to the north.
From the Channel port city of Dieppe, Rouen is approximately an hour's drive (66 km) south along the N27.
From the French end of the Eurotunnel, Rouen is approximately a 2-hour drive (208 km) using the E402.
From other major centres in Normandy, Rouen is respectively 90 km (1 hr 10 min) from Le Havre, 128 km (1 hr 25 min) from Caen, 156 km (1 hr 45 min) from Bayeux and 249 km (2 hr 45 min) from Cherbourg.
By train[edit]
49.4488891.0938891 Gare de Rouen Rive Droite, Place Bernard Tissot. Several trains depart from the St Lazare Station in Paris for Rouen on a daily basis.  Tickets cost around €21 and can be purchased at the station immediately beforehand. Travel time is about 1 hr 15 min. For schedules, visit SNCF travel. (updated Aug 2017)
The train posting in Paris St-Lazare can be confusing to the first-time traveller. The train platform number (la voie) is not posted until 15–20 minutes before the departure, so do not panic if you arrive earlier than that. Look for the train heading to Le Havre or Dieppe which will be leaving from the platforms to the right as you enter the concourse. Do not forget to punch (composter) your ticket in one of the yellow machines before boarding. This will validate your ticket.
By bus[edit]
Flixbus and BlablaCar Bus serve the city. From Paris, connections can be made with buses throughout France and Europe.

By boat[edit]
Ferries from the UK go to the French ports of Dieppe and Le Havre, from where trains can be caught to Rouen.
For foot-passengers, the train and ferry journey from London via Newhaven and Dieppe is one of the most pleasant and restful ways of getting to Rouen.

By plane[edit]

Get around[edit]
Map of public transport in Rouen. The Métro is blue, the T1 line is red, T2 line is green and T3 line is purple. The last three are BRT lines.
The city center is compact and all sights can easily be seen by foot, however, there is public transport throughout the town.
The Métro du Rouen is a tramway operating in Rouen, running north to south from Boulingrin in the north to Saint-Sever, where it branches off into two lines - one to Technopôle and one to Georges Braque.
There is also a "bus rapid transit" system, which is very similar to a normal bus system, in Rouen, called the Transport est-ouest rouennais (TEOR). This system has three lines in the town, T1, T2 and T3, all of which run on the north of the river.
A normal bus system also exists with 29 lines operating throughout the town.
Tickets for public transport can be bought from many places, including the Gare-Rue Verte tram station on Place Bernard-Tissot, the Théâtre des Arts tram station on rue Jeanne d'Arc, from conductors on buses (not on TEOR) and from automatic ticket machines at metro and TEOR stations. Tickets can also be bought by text, costing €1.60 and are valid for one hour.

Velo-R north of the Seine on Avenue Jeanne D' Arc (near the metro station) rents bikes for €1-2 per day. The city also has an official bicycle rental scheme where you can rent a bike at one location and drop it off at another.
A scooter shop on Avenue De Bretagne no. 18 rents scooters but they need to be reserved ahead of time. There is also an Avis in town.
