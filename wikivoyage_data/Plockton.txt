Plockton is a village on the west coast of Ross and Cromarty in the Scottish Highlands, with a population of 468 in 2020. In Scots slang a "plook" is a pimple, and The Plock is a small headland sheltering the harbour from the westerly weather. The settlement was laid out in the early 19th century as a planned fishing village for those evicted from their crofts inland, and someone realised that "Plockton" might be a better name for the place. It's scenic and makes for a good film or TV location.


Understand[edit]
Plocton was built as a planned fishing village in the 1810s.
In the 1990s Plocton was the location for the TV series Hamish Macbeth, a comedy drama about the local police officer and his dog. If you don't remember it, look on BBC iPlayer (UK only).
