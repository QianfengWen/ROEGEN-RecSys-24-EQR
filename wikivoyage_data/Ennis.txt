Ennis (Inis, "island") is the county town of County Clare in Ireland. It's a market town with several historic religious sites. It also has accommodation  and other visitor amenities, and is the public transport hub for the county.


Understand[edit]
Ennis
The O'Brien dynasty, descendants of Brian Boru, ruled this corner of Ireland when they weren't bossing it all. Your man himself was born at Killaloe on the Shannon and their bastion was in Limerick. In the 12th -century the O'Brien's relocated to Inis Cluana Rámhfhada, "island of the long rowing meadow" on the River Fergus. Here grew up a royal residence and a Franciscan Friary, and other religious centres were established in the lush surrounding countryside. Religious power was broken by the Dissolution, but Inis or Ennis continued to grow as a provincial capital under the Tudors. It never had walls, and in the 17th century when Catholics and other suspect minorities were forbidden to live in the walled cities, they came to live here and added to its prosperity. The 19th century saw the horrors of the Great Famine, and many left for North America, but Ennis' status was confirmed when Irish county government was overhauled. It remains a market town, with light industry and within commuting distance of Shannon Airport and Limerick city. In 2016 its population was 25,276, so it ranks about 12th among Ireland's largest towns.

See[edit]
Sacristy of Ennis Friary
52.846-8.9811 Ennis Friary, Lower Abbey St. Apr-Oct: daily 10:00-18:00. This is the ruin of a 13th-century Franciscan Friary. The nave has been re-roofed and displays a selection of 15th- to 16th-century limestone carvings: St Francis is among them. There's also elaborate tracery under the south arch. The sacristry has a ribbed barrel-vault ceiling and gives onto the cloister. The Franciscans were ejected after the Dissolution but they maintained a secret presence in the area and the church has been returned to them, though they now use the nearby Church of the Immaculate Conception. Adult €5. (updated Apr 2020)
52.844-8.9822 Daniel O'Connell monument commemorates his by-election victory here in 1828. As a Catholic he was unable to take his seat in the British Parliament. Prime Minister the Duke of Wellington (himself a Dubliner) had little time for Catholics but realised that this could provoke an uprising, so the Catholic Relief Act was passed in 1829. This Act wasn't retrospective so O'Connell had to seek re-election, which was unopposed. It was used as a model to end similar discrimination against Jews.
52.838-8.9853 Muhammad Ali monument is on Turnpike Rd just south of the centre. Abe Grady emigrated from here in the 1860s to Kentucky, where he married an African-American woman freed from slavery. Their daughter was Odessa Lee, who married Cassius Clay Snr, whose son was Cassius Clay Jnr (1942-2016), the champion heavyweight boxer who took the name Muhammad Ali.

Knappogue Castle Irish Whiskey is a single malt, still a rarity in Ireland though this one's been on the market since 1998. It's produced by Castle Brands, now part of Pernod Ricard, and they're coy about where it's actually distilled. "Somewhere in Ireland" is all the law would require.
