Lewisporte is a town and seaport on Notre Dame Bay in Central Newfoundland. The town was founded in 1876, and has about 3400 (2016) residents. It is a deep-water port and shipping centre on Notre Dame Bay which has served as a fishing, farming and boat-building settlement, a shipping port and sawmill, and later as a distribution point for supplies destined to Cartwright and Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Labrador by coastal ferry.

History[edit]
Europeans settlers first arrived in Lewisporte in 1887 and engaged in the prosperous fishing, logging, and ship building industries. The first European settlers were attracted to the area by the huge stands of birch, spruce and pine, which graced the shores. Lewisporte is named for Lewis Miller, an enterprising Scotsman who operated a logging company in central Newfoundland.
During the war years, Lewisporte was an important base of operations for the Canadian Forces. Gander's strategic location as a ‘jumping off’ point for flights going to Europe brought a larger population to Lewisporte. Approximately three army sites were constructed in Lewisporte to protect the oil supply lines to Gander. Rapid commercial and residential growth after the war has converted and swallowed nearly all evidence of military presence. Lewisporte's population and size have increased as the town's transportation and distribution function became more important.
After the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, numerous trans-Atlantic flights were diverted to Gander International Airport when U.S. airspace was closed. Due to its proximity to Gander's once-bustling international airport, Lewisporte accommodated more than 700 of the 6500 trans-Atlantic airline passengers diverted to Gander during the September 11, 2001 attacks in the US.  Lewisporte sheltered and fed hundreds of stranded airline passengers for several days. In press reports, the passengers praised the citizens of Lewisporte for their concern and hospitality.
