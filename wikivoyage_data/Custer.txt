Custer is a city in the Southern Black Hills Badlands and Black Hills. The city lines were laid out by the notorious Al Swearengen who was portrayed in the popular HBO series, Deadwood. Custer was the first city in the Black Hills.
The town is named for General Custer but is not near the battlefield where he was defeated and killed, sometimes called "Custer's Last Stand". That is at Little Bighorn in Montana.
