Dungog Station
By train[edit]
-32.401836151.7594771 Dungog Station  is on the northern fringe of NSW TrainLink's Intercity network on the Hunter Line ( HUN ). There are five trains per day departing from Newcastle Interchange via Maitland at roughly around 3- to 4-hour intervals on weekdays and three on weekends. The timetable is here.
Unfortunately, the nature of the Intercity network means that it's designed to prioritise services to Newcastle in the morning and back to Dungog in the afternoon, and serves as commuter rail (except that this is between two cities). This usually means that services tend to be infrequent, unreliable and long, often inconvenient for most travellers.
Being on the main rail line between Sydney and Brisbane, it is also possible to catch infrequent trains to/from places like Casino, Coffs Harbour, Taree and other points in between. There are usually 3 booked NSW TrainLink trains each way on a weekday.

By car[edit]
From Raymond Terrace, an exurb of Newcastle, use Seaham Road to Seaham and then head north onto Clarence Town Road until Dungog. From Maitland, use the same road but it is marked as Paterson Rd through Maitland. The drive takes around 40–50 minutes from both Raymond Terrace and Maitland.
