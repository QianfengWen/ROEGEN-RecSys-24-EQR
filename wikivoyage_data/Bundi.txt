Bundi, in eastern Rajasthan, rates highly in terms of attractions; the city is famous for the Taragarh fort which towers over the city, and its more than 50 sunken step-wells used to draw clean water before the modern water mains were installed.


Understand[edit]
The population of Bundi was approximately 103,000 in 2011. It was named after a Meena Chieftain Bunda, also notable  the miniature paintings from the "Bundi School".
The city attracts a number of tourists in season and a multitude of guesthouses have sprung up near to the fort, ignore the hustlers in the street who try to lead you around or offer you services- you will be charged a higher rate which will go into the hustlers pocket.
The locals genuinely are a friendly lot however, and you can have a tea and make friends with almost everyone - even the shopkeepers and hustlers if you show some genuine interest.
Famous visitors to Bundi include Rudyard Kipling (writer of The Jungle Book), Rabindra Nath Tagore, Virginia Fass, and film maker Satyajit Ray.
