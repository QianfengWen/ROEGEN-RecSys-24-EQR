Eastleigh is a town in Hampshire that sits between Winchester and Southampton. The town has a long history associated with the railway, being the site of a large railway works that at one time was the major employer in the area.


Understand[edit]
The Point, Leigh Road
The Borough of Eastleigh contains the town of Eastleigh,  and many small villages and hamlets, including Chandler's Ford to the north and Bishopstoke to the east.
Perhaps the best-known piece of history associated with Eastleigh is that it is the home of the Spitfire (a famous World War II fighter plane). The aircraft was built, designed and first flown from what is now Southampton Airport. During its military service, Southampton Airport was known as HMS Raven, before it was renamed to Eastleigh Airport in 1947. The name was changed again to its current name in 1994 to mark the opening of the new terminal constructed there the year before.
The town also boasts a link to one of the UK's best known comics, Benny Hill. Indeed it was his work as a milkman in the town that spawned his well known "Ernie - the fastest milkman in the west" tune. The cartoon character 'Jane' and musician Heinz Burt are also connected with the borough.

Since the Pirelli Cable Works closed down in 1990, Eastleigh became a dormitory town, meaning that it has become home to many people who live there, but work somewhere else.
In 2006, Eastleigh was named as the ninth best place to live in the UK by the Channel 4 television programme The Best and Worst Places to Live 2006. The abundance of jobs and excellent transport links (motorways, trains, buses and planes) were named as some of the primary reasons for this award. Nearby Winchester was named the best place to live in the UK by the same programme.
Bishopstoke is just one of the many small villages and hamlets inside the borough. It has a history which stretches back to Saxon times. It is featured in Domesday Book and has long links with Winchester Cathedral and its bishops. King John signed charters here during his visits in 1205 and 1207. William Gilbert, the novelist father of W.S. Gilbert, is stated to have been born here in 1804. During the reign of Queen Victoria, Dean Garnier's garden is said to have rivalled that at Chiswick. In the early 1940s, part of the village had its milk delivered by Benny Hill, who became a popular comedian after the war.
Chandler's Ford has a long history associated with the railways, being the site of a large railway works that at one time was the major employer in the area. The population of Chandler's Ford is now over 20,000 and still growing. It contains the headquarters of B&Q and Draper Tools — both companies selling DIY equipment. The town has the same ways to travel as Eastleigh, see the "Get around" section below for more details.

The town's name[edit]
Eastleigh can be seen in the Domesday Book of 1066 as 'Estleie' — which translates as "East of the Leigh (meadow)" from Old Saxon, however this isn't the earliest record of the town as there was a Saxon town known as 'East Leah' in 932. This name was chosen because up until the Victorian era, the town was two large farms - known as the Great Eastley Farm and Little Eastley Farm. In 1868, a local author called    was asked to name the town either Eastley or Barton  - the two hamlets in the area that is now Central Eastleigh. She chose Eastley, however decided it should be spelt Eastleigh to make it sound more modern. A statue of her is located at the train station, and a local college was named Barton Peveril in 1904, possibly in reference to the other name she could have chosen.

Railway heritage[edit]
The town was made up of two farms up until Victorian times, when the railway was built. The station was built to create a direct line from London to Plymouth. After the station was constructed, most of the people in the area worked for the railway, so they needed somewhere to live. As more and more people worked at the station, more houses were built until the town turned into what it is today — a large town with villages and hamlets of its own.

Connect[edit]
As of May 2021, Eastleigh has 4G with all UK carriers. 5G has reached Bishopstoke and Chandler's Ford, but not Eastleigh Town Centre. A 5G mast has been constructed in the middle of the residential area of the town, however you cannot get 5G signal anywhere in Eastleigh.
Eastleigh's area code for landline numbers is 023 when dialled from within the UK or +44 23 from outside the UK. Calls made from landlines within the 023 area (which covers most of South Hampshire, including Southampton and Portsmouth) do not require the area code to connect. However, most Southampton phone numbers start "023 80..." leading many to incorrectly assume that "02380" is the local area code.
