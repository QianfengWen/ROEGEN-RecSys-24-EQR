Do[edit]
 UConn Huskies. University of Connecticut sports, competing in 11 men's and 13 women's sports, mostly in the Big East Conference. UConn's most prominent sport by far is basketball, in which the Huskies have won 16 NCAA titles—five by the men and a record 11 by the women. In fact, UConn is the only NCAA Division I school whose men and women both have more than one national basketball title. Most of the major athletic venues are on campus, but two significant venues are far removed from Storrs. Both men's and women's basketball split their home games between Gampel Pavilion on campus and the larger XL Center in downtown Hartford. Expect a sellout for any men's or women's game on campus, and don't be surprised to find a game in Hartford sold out. The football team, which became an FBS (top-level) independent when the university joined the Big East (which does not play football), plays at Pratt & Whitney Stadium in East Hartford.
