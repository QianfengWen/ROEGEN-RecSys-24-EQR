Hout Bay harbour.
Hout Bay appears to be a little harbour village but is actually a suburb of the South African metropole Cape Town.


Get in[edit]
Hout Bay is situated at the west side of the Cape Peninsula. You can get there by car, following the road along the west coast of Peninsula. From the Cape Town city centre drive to Camps Bay and from there all along the sea. You can also get there from the east side of the Peninsula and from the Cape of Good Hope.
Park your car at the parking lot by the harbour.





Republic of Hout Bay
Hout Bay is not only famous for its fresh fish and harbour, but also as the "Republic of Hout Bay". Passports of the Republic of Hout Bay wete made as a publicity stunt. There is an urban legend  a that one man travelled to many countries in the world, without anybody noticing his false document. There is no record of any of them being actually accepted by any foreign customs post as genuine.)


See[edit]
The harbour is the main attraction. It is quiet and full of bustling fisher boats at the same time. There are also tall mountains that make Hout Bay special.

Do[edit]
Watch the fisherman unload their fresh fish, old ladies repairing the nets or go on a trip to Seal Island to see the local seal colony.
A visit to Hout Bay is incomplete without a visit to the World of Birds, a wonderful bird park, touted to be the biggest in the western cape. Make sure that you time your visit to coincide with the feeding of the Squirrel monkeys.
Chapman's Peak Drive starts just south of Hout Bay.  This toll road offers spectacular views, especially at sunset.   If you're a world class big wave surfer, Hout Bay is the location of Dungeons home to some of the worlds biggest surfable waves in winter.
