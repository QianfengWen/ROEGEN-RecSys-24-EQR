Safien or Safiental is a valley in Switzerland.


Understand[edit]
This region consists of a single valley in the Surselva district of Graubünden, it is stunningly remote with only a one-lane road and a single bus service, which is compromising in the 21st century. The valley is also quite beautiful with a steep rocky slope on one side and a gentle meadow on the other. The valley is one of the Walser settlements founded in the 12th century by migrants from the Valais region. This has had an influence on the language and the culture.

By bus[edit]
