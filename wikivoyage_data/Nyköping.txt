Nyköping is the county seat in Södermanland County, on the coast of the Baltic Sea 100 kilometres south-west of Stockholm. Many visitors to Sweden arrive at the nearby Stockholm-Skavsta Airport a few kilometres outside Nyköping. The city is also interesting in its own right, having a near-millennial history.


Understand[edit]
There are roughly 35,000 people living in central Nyköping and close to 50,000 in the whole municipality. There are 23,400 households in the municipality, with 9,600 of these individual homes and 13,800 apartments.
Nyköping is one of Sweden's older cities. Nyköping's history dates to around 2000 BC. The city Nyköping is considered to have been founded in 1187. Around this time, a fortress tower was built. It was later extended to the castle Nyköpingshus. The town has been hit by several city-wide fires. After the fire in 1665, the town was rebuilt on a grid model. This network of streets remains even today; it was not until 1950 that the city settlement grew outside the old 1600s plan.
After being one of several Swedish capitals for 400 years, Nyköping was an industrial city known for its substantial brass works in the 1700s. During the 1900s, factories produced furniture for NK, cars for Saab and parts for the F11 airplane.
Oxelösund is a southern suburb, known for its port and its steel mill.
