East Grinstead is a town in West Sussex, in the South East of England. The town is on the Greenwich Meridian. It has many historic buildings, and the Weald and Ashdown Forest lie to the south-east.


Understand[edit]
East Grinstead is an ancient market town that was the capital of the old High Weald. It lies at the meeting point of the four counties of Kent, East Sussex, West Sussex and Surrey. 
The High Street contains one of the longest continuous runs of 14th-century timber-framed buildings in England. Other notable buildings in the town include Sackville College, the sandstone almshouse, built in 1609, where John Mason Neale wrote the Christmas carol "Good King Wenceslas". The college has sweeping views towards Ashdown Forest.
The Greenwich Meridian runs through the grounds of the historic 1769 East Court mansion, home of the Town Council, giving the visitor an opportunity to stand with a foot in both the east and west.
