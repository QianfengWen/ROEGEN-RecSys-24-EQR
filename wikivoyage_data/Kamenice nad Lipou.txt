Kamenice nad Lipou (locally known just as Kamenice) is a small town in Highlands region of Czech Republic. It is home to about 4,000 people (1 January 2024) . The town is known for the scenic narrow gauge railway from Jindřichův Hradec, its chateau with an ancient lime tree and the main square with historical buildings. It presents a good way to get off the beaten path in Czech Republic, as Kamenice and the surrounding region are nice but completely overlooked by foreign tourists. It presents a good destination for people who prefer relaxing in small town atmosphere rather the hassle of main tourist destination and large cities.


Understand[edit]
The town was established in 13th century. The ancient lime tree which still grows in the chateau garden, and from which the city derives its name, was planted at about the same time. At that time, there was also a castle in the city. In 1583, the castle was rebuilt by one of the many town owners as a Renaissance chateau, which it still is today. In the eighteenth century, a brewery was built, and this brewery was renovated and reopened after a long halt during communist times. In 1906, the town was connected to the outside world by a narrow gauge railway from Jindřichův Hradec to Obrataň.
Today, Kamenice nad Lipou is a rather quiet town, with inhabitants working mostly in agriculture or the automobile parts industry (a few factories are based in the region). There is a mild seasonal inflow of domestic tourism in the summer, especially due to the town's connection with the nearby region of Česká Kanada, as well as the historical narrow gauge railway.

Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
49.30006515.0756971 Kamenice Bus Station (almost in the center of the city). All the buses go here. (updated Jul 2023)
There is one daily bus leaving from and going to Roztyly station in Prague (red metro line C). There are also direct buses from other nearby cities, such as Pelhřimov, České Budějovice or Jihlava.
For timetables and tickets, use IDOS. If the button to buy a ticket is not present at IDOS, you can just buy it from the driver of the bus (you can actually always buy the ticket from the driver, but the bus might already be full).

By train[edit]
49.29485315.0746082 Railway Station (about 1 km from the center). (updated Jul 2023)
You can get to the city by using the local narrow gauge railway [formerly dead link] , which runs many times every day. The railway is not operated by Czech Railways, meaning you can not buy a ticket online on the Czech Railways website. If you coming from Prague, find the connection first on IDOS, then buy the ticket to the last point on Czech Railways on their website (this is always Jindřichův Hradec or Obrataň) and buy the ticket for narrow gauge railway from the conductor. Alternatively, you can buy the ticket all the way to Kamenice at any Czech Railways ticket desk.
From Prague, you have to change trains twice at Tábor and Obrataň or Veselí nad Lužnicí and Jindřichův Hradec. Tábor and Jindřichův Hradec are quite interesting cities, so you can easily spend time there when waiting for the next train. Obrataň is a small village with one pub to spend time in. The train journey from Prague usually takes at least three hours, including waiting for connecting trains.
From Jindřichův Hradec, just find the timetable at IDOS and buy the ticket from the conductor on the train.
From all other major cities in Czech Republic, again just use IDOS to find the right train. It is always necessary to change trains at least once.
If you taking a train somewhere from Kamenice nad Lipou, check if there is someone selling tickets in the station building. If there is someone, you have to buy the ticket from there, otherwise you have to pay a small extra fee to the conductor in the train.

By car[edit]
You can easily get to Kamenice by car from any point in the Czech Republic. The main road connecting the town to the D1 highway in Humpolec is newly rebuilt and passes just next to Kamenice, so it is going to be a fast ride (under 90 minutes from the center of Prague if there are no traffic jams on the highway). You can park basically anywhere in town.

By bicycle[edit]
The surrounding region is perfect for cycling, with decent hills a good roads without too much traffic. For a skilled cyclist, the nice 120 km (75 mi) bike trip from Prague is doable in one day. Use OsmAnd or Mapy.cz for planning any bike trips. Kamenice nad Lipou lies on the main bike road from Prague to Vienna.

The town itself is small, so you can walk anywhere. For longer trips in the surrounding region, bike or car would be the best bet. They have bikes for rent at Hotel Berger, but it is unknown if they rent them to people other than their guests, so you have to ask. Another option is to rent a bike in Jindřichův Hradec (possible directly at the railway station, from Czech Railways) and then take it to Kamenice—you can take it to the train or ride the last 20 km (12 mi) from Jindřichův Hradec.
