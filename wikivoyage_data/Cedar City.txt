Cedar City is a small city in Dixie, Utah, and is a good place to stock up on supplies before heading into beautiful wilderness areas stretching out in all directions. The city is sandwiched between mountain ranges covered by Dixie National Forest, while further to the southwest lie the remotest areas of Zion National Park, and to the east Cedar Breaks National Monument and Bryce Canyon National Park.

 Southern Utah Thunderbirds. The sports teams representing Southern Utah University, playing in the Western Athletic Conference for most sports, as well as the football-only United Athletic Conference. While SUU is a member of NCAA Division I, it lacks the high profile of some other schools in the state, most notably Utah in Salt Lake City and BYU in Provo, in no small part because its football team plays in the second-level Division I FCS. On the plus side, this means ticket prices are considerably lower than those for more prominent teams. The most prominent venues, both on campus, are 37.675833-113.0769444 Eccles Coliseum for football and 37.675556-113.0730565 America First Event Center for basketball, volleyball, and women's gymnastics.

Cedar City is located very near major recreational areas including:

Cedar Breaks National Monument - a half-mile deep geologic amphitheater.  Wander among timeless bristlecone pines, stand in lush meadows of wildflowers, ponder crystal-clear night skies, and experience the richness of the subalpine forest. Utah Highway 148, the main road through Cedar Breaks, is closed during the winter due to high snowfall.
Bryce Canyon National Park - There is no place quite like Bryce Canyon. Hoodoos (odd-shaped pillars of rock left standing from the forces of erosion) can be found on every continent, but here is the archetypal "hoodoo-iferous" terrain.
Capitol Reef National Park
Zion National Park - to the south.
Las Vegas - only about a 2-hour drive along I-15 to the southwest.
