Leksand is a town, and a municipality, in the Dalarna province in Sweden.


Understand[edit]
Leksand city centre.
Leksand is located at Lake Siljans outlet into river Österdalälven. As part of Siljansbygden, Leksand is regarded as a caretaker of Swedishness, with a knäckebröd (crisp bread) bakery, popular Midsummer celebration, and an ice hockey team unusually successful for such a small town — Leksand IF has won the Swedish Hockey Championship four times! Leksand municipality has a population of about 16,000 people, out of which some 6,000 live in Leksand proper. The summer park Leksand Sommarland, a few km north of Leksand, is a major tourist attraction.
