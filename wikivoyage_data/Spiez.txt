Get around[edit]
Map of Spiez

Spiez itself is easy to discover just by "getting around". So you can catch this special "holiday feeling", which made Spiez a famous wellness and wellbeing location. Discover the "Spirit of Spiez" while walking - from the train station - towards the lakeshore and the castle. In 1954 Germany's football national team found this spirit too and won the world cup.
Don't forget to take a tour through the vineyards: There you'll get a great view all over the city, the lake and the whole panorama of the always snow-covered Alps.
Don't be shy: ask the people, where to go. Almost everyone speaks English, most speak French and some speak Italian. So ask them, where to go, where to get a drink or beer and where to spend the night or to enjoy the nightlife.
If you travel by car you'll be able to park in one of the many parking lots. For your first visit, you can park at the train station next to the tourist information office.
You will find more parking in the city centre (Coop, Lötschbergzentrum, Spiez-Park) and at the lake near the castle.
