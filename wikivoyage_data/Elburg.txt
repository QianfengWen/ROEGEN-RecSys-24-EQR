Elburg[dead link] is a historic city in the Dutch province of Gelderland. Between 1292 and 1296 Elburg was rebuilt in the form it is seen today, with a moat and a city wall, together with the straight pattern of the street plan. This rapid rebuilding was expensive, indicating that Elburg was reasonably affluent in medieval times.

Old Elburg[edit]
Elburg is a municipality and town by the Veluwemeer and Drontermeer. Elburg once was a small town living of fishing and trade located on the edge of the Zuiderzee. It is assumed that the city got its city rights between 1220 and 1271. On the fifth of September 1310 these city rights were revoked as Count Otto II of Guelders, who gave the city rights, did not have the right permissions to have done so, as he did not request the royal permission. The rights were restored and expanded upon by Count Reinald I in December 1312, giving Elburg the same set of rights as Doesburg had at the time. Several years later, in 1341, the city rights were expanded again, making Elburg equal to Zutphen. Elburg used to consist of one long main road stretching to the north, where fishermen and traders put up shop.

New Elburg[edit]
Saint-Nicolas/Great Church with its iconic flat-top tower.
On the second of October 1392 William of Gulik, Count of Guelders, ordered: "Wij willen dat sy onze stat versetten sullen op een andere stede." (We (William) order that you must move our city (Elburg) to another location). For as far as we know, there is no particular reason to move the city of Elburg. Some argue that a threat or destruction by the Zuiderzee might have been a reason to move the city, though no proof supporting that theory has been found.
This moving of Elburg could be done due to the wealth that the city had gathered as a Hanzestad. Arent tho Boecop, steward of Elburg, got a start of the new city, which had a grid-based plan, as well as a connection to the old Elburg. Part of the old city was implemented in the new city. Parts of the old main street became the Ellestraat. After the new Elburg was constructed, the church was still outside of the city, which led for a relocation of the church in 1397. The church, which was a catholic church, was built in a hurry, as only fifty years after its opening, it was scheduled for a renovation.  The tower, which once had a pointed rood, burnt down after getting struck by lightning in 1693, which makes that today only the base of it stands.
During the moving of the city Elburg, not only was the city relocated, the city also was fortified as well. The city got its square moat and walls with gates. These fortifications stand to this day.
