Port Tobacco[edit]
Just at the western edge of La Plata is Port Tobacco [dead link], Maryland's smallest town (15 people), dating back to 1727. Owing in no part to its extremely small size, the village is well preserved and home to much archaeological research. To get here, take MD-6 (Port Tobacco Rd) west from La Plata and then make a left on Chapel Point Rd. Turn right on small Commerce St for the village itself, while St. Thomas Manor is further south along the same road.

 Port Tobacco Courthouse (Port Tobacco Museum), Commerce St, Port Tobacco, ☏ +1 301 934-4313. The Courthouse is the centerpiece of the historic village, and upstairs they maintain a small museum with exhibits on local history and archaeological findings. Occasional tours in with costumed docents. 
38.465278-77.0241672 St. Thomas Manor (St. Ignatius Church), 8855 Chapel Point Road, Port Tobacco Village, ☏ +1 301 934-8245. The oldest continuously occupied Jesuit residence in the world, the Manor and Church is a pretty place to visit, with a good bit of history to its name. The mission was founded in 1641 to administer to the Potapoco American Indians. It was here that John Carroll was invested in his robes as the first Catholic bishop in the country (he later also founded Georgetown University). Outbuildings include a small, mid-19th century wood-frame slaves' quarter.
