History[edit]
Overlooking the town of Stephenville
This place was known as the Acadian village, between 1848 and 1870. The populace of the village consisted of Roman Catholics who eked out a living, farming and fishing. The town's population continued to grow because of the stable economy. It was home to Ernest Harmon AFB, which was operated by the United States Air Force from 1941 to 1966.
The base precipitated an economic boom of sorts on Newfoundland's southwest coast during the 1940s. The village of Stephenville grew from a hamlet of several hundred people with no paved streets, side walks, water or sewage system in 1941 into a modern town of over 5,000 by the mid-1950s. By the time Ernest Harmon AFB closed in 1966, the town had more than doubled in size, partly as a result of the provincial government's forced resettlement policy toward residents of outports. The town uses many former USAF structures for housing, recreation and entertainment.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
If travelling by car, you first have to take the Marine Atlantic Ferry from North Sydney to Port aux Basques. From there it's a 2-hour drive north on the Trans-Canada Highway to Stephenville. Turn off the Trans-Canada Highway onto provincial Route 460 - White's Road (also known as Hansen Highway) or Route 490 - Stephenville Access Road. Both roads lead into downtown Stephenville.

By plane[edit]
You can reach Stephenville easily. Firstly, if visiting from the mainland or anywhere off the island, you can reach Stephenville by air. Stephenville has its own international airport with connections to just about anywhere, but first you have to connect through Halifax or St. John's as they have the largest airports within the Atlantic region.
