Part of the Pine Bluff Commercial Historic District
Pine Bluff is a historic city in the Timberlands region of Southern Arkansas.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
The city is known as the location of the last major Confederate offensive of the American Civil War in the state of Arkansas. The U.S. garrison held this critical riverport town against an attack led by Confederate Brigadier-General John S. Marmaduke. The Union army did this against overwhelming odds.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The best way is by car. I-530 will get you to Pine Bluff from Little Rock, however you can also use Highway 365, which basically follows the same route but has more interesting scenery and goes through various small towns.

By plane[edit]
Grider Field is an airport to the south of the city, however there aren't any commercial flights there. It is used mainly for general aviation. Little Rock National Airport is the principal air gateway to Pine Bluff.

Get around[edit]
