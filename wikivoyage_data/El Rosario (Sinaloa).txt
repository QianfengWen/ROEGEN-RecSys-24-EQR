Altar in the Iglesia de Nuestra Señora del Rosario
El Rosario (Sinaloa) is a coastal town on the Sea of Cortez in southern Sinaloa, Mexico. The town's main church is famous for having a beautifully ostentatious gold altar that stuns visitors, even in a country where astounding churches are common. Once famous as the home town of ranchera singer, Lola Beltran, the town is now known for its quality marijuana. It's a charming small town with a colonial vibe. It is one of Mexico's designated Pueblos Mágicos and is a popular day trip for visitors staying at the beach resorts of Mazatlan.


Understand[edit]
El Rosario is a small town with about 16,000 residents (2010). It is a historic mining community, founded in 1655, that built its first industries around silver production. An unspecified number of locals now profit from growing marijuana and poppy for drug cartels.

Get in[edit]
Map of El Rosario (Sinaloa)
By car[edit]
From Mazatlan, El Rosario is 70 km southeast on federal highway MEX-15D. The drive will take about 1 hour. Uber serves Mazatlan and the fare is cheaper than a rental car. 

By bus[edit]
Several buses go to El Rosario from Mazatlan and other cities. From Mazatlan, Tufesa operates several first-class buses each day. Full-price tickets are M$234 but there's usually a promo going on for about half that. (Tufesa allows you to bring your dog on the bus. Canines pay half the adult fare because they don't complain about how the drivers only speak Spanish.) Other bus companies also go through El Rosario, but less frequently than Tufesa.
