New Milford is a historic New England town on the western side of Connecticut.  It is the largest town in the state (62 square miles) and is just under 2 hours away from New York City.


Understand[edit]
New Milford is a welcoming town of around 28,000 people and the locals like to meet people from out of town.  Much of the downtown area still has authentic looking building fronts from the early 1900s & mid to late 1800s which adds a nice touch of history in your experiences you have during your visit.
The town center consists of small shops and boutiques that are all very affordable.  There are also a large variety of restaurants including Mexican, American, and Italian.  The town green is a nice place to walk around and enjoy the outdoors especially in the summertime.  If you are visiting during the summer, make sure to check the green to see if the village fair is being held.
The town is very safe area and there is generally a good amount of locals enjoying the nightlife.  Bars in this area have a relaxed feel to them and are very affordable as well.  Being in the center of Candlewood Valley, the rolling hills that surround the town are very pleasant to look at during any season of the year. Several parks in the area provide a place where you can enjoy views of the area as well as places to hike or have a picnic.
The prosperity of this town relies a lot upon its locally owned businesses and restaurants so it is a nice place to get away from chain businesses.  This also means that each place that you decide to visit, you will be having a unique experience that will leave you satisfied.

Coming from the north, route 7 or 202 will lead you directly to the town center as well
