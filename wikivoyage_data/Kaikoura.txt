Kaikoura (pronounced: Kai-kou-ra) is a small coastal town on the east coast (Pacific Ocean) of the South Island of New Zealand, about 180 km north of Christchurch and 130 km south of Blenheim. It is famed for its marine mammals (whales, dolphins, seals) and other sea-life, all of which you can see, some of which you can swim with, and some you can eat. In Māori, kai means "eat" and kōura is "crayfish" (rock lobster). So Kaikoura is a place to eat crayfish!


Understand[edit]
Kaikoura lies on a coastal plain and a peninsula between high mountains and the Pacific Ocean.  In places along this coast the mountains drop almost straight into the sea, with barely enough flat land for a single railway line, two-lane road and rocky beach, and even then some short tunnels are needed on corners. The steepness of the mountains reflects the underwater geography, with the deep-water Hikurangi Trench and the continental shelf edge lying just offshore south of the peninsula. This makes the ocean around Kaikoura rich in sea life, attracting seals, whales (and humans) to the area to partake in the bounty of the sea.
The town has a similar charm to an east coast USA beach town, with a hodgepodge of signs trying to grab tourists' attention.  At the edges of the town, the more relaxed and nature-oriented activities again take precedence.
Kaikoura is the perfect place to enjoy both the wonders of the magnificent Pacific Ocean and the tall, majestic mountains. A great place to stay, it is also an ideal rest stop on a section of State Highway 1 (SH1) that passes through isolated country  north and south of the town.
The town was damaged by an earthquake in November 2016 but roads have reopened and repairs to buildings and facilities are well advanced and tourism is in full swing.

History[edit]
The Maori settled in Kaikoura long before European colonisation of New Zealand and cultivated the coastal plain, planting kumara, a type of sweet potato. Maori legend has it that Maui placed his foot on the Kaikoura Peninsula to steady himself as he 'fished-up' the North Island.
In 1770, Captain Cook discovered the Kaikoura Peninsula, believing it to be an island at first. Early European settlers used Kaikoura as a whaling station from 1842 and the remains of pots used to render the whale blubber can be seen on the town foreshore.

Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
Bus and shuttle services running between Picton and Christchurch all stop at Kaikoura. Intercity has two buses per day each way.

By car[edit]
Kaikoura is on State Highway 1, two and a half hours drive north of Christchurch and one hour 40 minutes south of Blenheim. The highway has reopened since the 2016 earthquake, but there may be short halts where the road is temporarily restricted to one lane because of ongoing roadworks (as of February 2020).
An alternative and less used route from the south is the Inland Kaikoura Road (Route 70), which branches off State Highway 7 a few kilometres north of Culverden. Kaikoura is part of the Alpine Pacific Triangle touring route, which links three popular recreational destinations, Hanmer Springs, Waipara Valley wine region and Kaikoura. The easy and pleasant drive around the entire touring route is 370 km, beginning at its southern end a 45-min drive from Christchurch International Airport or Christchurch City and finishing at its northern end in Kaikoura.

By train[edit]
Main article: Rail travel in New Zealand
The Coastal Pacific train runs through Kaikoura on its way between Picton and Christchurch each day from October through April. It departs Christchurch 07:00, then departs Kaikoura 09:54, arriving Picton 12:13. Departs Picton 13:00, then departs Kaikoura 15:28, arriving Christchurch 18:21. The train journey is fantastic, with the mountains on one side and the ocean on the other. The track follows the coast for the last part of the journey into Kaikoura and you can often see fur seals lazing on the rocks. The station is on Whaleway Station Road (presumably named because Whale Watch Kaikoura operate out of the station).

Get around[edit]
Kaikoura Shuttles can move you around Kaikoura and further afield, daily 07:00–23:00.
