Waitsfield is a ski resort town in Central Vermont. Mad River Glen and Sugarbush are both nearby.


Get in[edit]
If you are flying to the area, you are most likely to fly into Burlington International Airport (BTV IATA) in Burlington. There are smaller state airports closer to Waitsfield, however. Those include Edward F. Knapp Airport in Barre and Morrisville-Stowe State Airport (MVL IATA) in Morrisville.
For getting in by car, the closest major interstate is I-89 which stretches from Concord, NH, to Burlington. Waitsfield lies on Vermont Route 100, a scenic and winding road that connects the northern and southern ends of the state. Waitsfield is about 10 miles south of I-89 at Duxbury, Vt.

Get around[edit]
A car is necessary to get around. A four-wheel or all-wheel drive vehicle is recommended in winter. The narrow, winding roads can be hazardous to drivers who are inexperienced driving on snow or ice. This is especially true when approaching from the West via Route 17 as it crosses the Green Mountains at Appalachian Gap. Large vehicles such as RVs are advised to seek another route.
Taxi cabs are less common in Vermont than in more populated areas.
