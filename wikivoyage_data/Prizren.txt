Prizren, in Kosovo, is a charming city of mosques and monasteries dating back to the 14th century. Happily spared (mostly) from both the "destroy the old, build the new" drive of the communists during the early years of their rule in Yugoslavia, as well as the ethnic and religious atrocities that plagued the Western Balkans in the last decade of the 20th century, Prizren has the best-preserved old town in the country by far, and is often referred to as the cultural capital of Kosovo.


Understand[edit]
Old town of Prizren
Clinging to the slopes of the lush Sharr Mountains, and divided by the river Lumbardh, Prizren, including its modern suburbs, was home to about 180,000 people in 2011, making it the second largest city in the country, after Pristina, the capital. The majority of the population is ethnic Albanian. Kosovo's Turkish, Bosniak and Gorani community is focused in Prizren as well. As such, the standard bi-lingual street signs in Albanian and Serbian are complemented here by Turkish, which can be freely used particularly in the old town, and with other Albanians. The local Serbs vacated the city in the aftermath of the Kosovo War of 1998–99, when Kosovo was de facto detached from Serbia, with their charred houses standing derelict on the upper streets leading to the fortress.
Prizren is also where the Albanian national awakening began, as the League of Prizren, a political organization for defending the rights of the Albanians, was founded here in 1878.

Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
42.2128820.728952 Main Bus Station (Stacioni i Autobusëve), Rruga Zara (To get to the main bus station take the road along the river and turn right at the traffic circle. The bus station is on the left. There are a couple of travel travel agencies in the area.). Buses are available to almost anywhere in Kosovo, usually via Pristina or Gjakova, Macedonia and Albania. (updated May 2022)
The best way to get to Prizren is by bus through Pristina (€5, around 2 hr). You can also take buses from Peja (€4), where the famous Orthodox monasteries are located.
You can also catch a bus from Tirana or Skopje. Most bus companies that run from Istanbul to Pristina continue onward and terminate in Prizren. There are several direct buses from Belgrade (1 day 7 hr bus & 2 night buses, cost approximately €10, and stops depending on the route in Nis or Kruševac, with Pristina and other towns on the road (as of Feb 2005).

By car[edit]
From Albania, there are two good ways

From Tirana on the newly-constructed highway via Kukës. This masterpiece of civil engineering takes you over and through the mountains with stunning views—about 3 hr.
The more adventurous summer route is from Shkodra via Lake Komani. Catch a furgon from Shkodra at 06:00 to Koman. Catch the passenger or car ferry to Fierze, then furgon to Bajram Curri. At Bajram Curri get another furgon to Prizren via Gjakovë, arriving in Prizren mid-afternoon.
By plane[edit]
Kukës International Airport (KFZ IATA) is the closest airport and has connection between Basel and Kukës starting at 4,200 lek as of June 2023.
Prishtina International Airport (PRN IATA) is the better choice though.
Daytripping from Skopje[edit]
With direct buses from Skopje arriving in the evening, and making their return in the morning, a day-trip from Skopje may not seem possible, but if you put some thought and effort into it, you will realize that it is entirely feasible. Read on:
Take the 06:00 bus from Skopje to Pristina. If the bus is not very crowded (particularly the case on weekdays), you won't lose much time at the border crossing, and arrive in the bus station of Pristina just in time for the 08:20 bus to Prizren. (You could have got off in Ferizaj on the way at 07:30, but you will need a lot of creativity to pass the time there until the departure of the next bus to Prizren at 09:15.) This bus will arrive in Prizren at about 10:15.
Upon returning, the last bus to Skopje leaves Pristina at 17:00, making a stop at Ferizaj bus station at about 18:00. This means that you will have to catch the 13:45 bus to Pristina from Prizren (which will let you stroll around Pristina for a little more than an hour—to spare more time for Pristina, take the 13:00 bus from Prizren), or the 17:00 bus to Ferizaj (and hope it arrives at its scheduled time of 18:00, and doesn't miss the last bus to Skopje—the 14:30 bus, which arrives in Ferizaj at 16:10, is probably a better bet). Note that the evening bus to Skopje is often almost completely full by the time it arrives in Ferizaj, which means that, should you decide to take it there, you may have to travel standing for part of the route, and then take a taxi in a village near the border for the rest of the route to Skopje, perhaps because of a rule regulating border crossings.
If you prefer a faster and more efficient day-trip from Skopje, is possible to arrange a private round-trip tour by car to Prizren for approximately 180 EUR. Inquire with local tour companies about this, preferably with a driver/guide who speaks Albanian and can navigate the border crossings. Additionally, this option may allow you to take the more scenic route through the mountains back to Skopje (preferably in the afternoon).

Shadervan Square
Kino Lumbardhi
42.2090420.740521 Shadervan. The main square in town, this stone piazza is surrounded by cafes, bars, restaurants and ice cream parlors. During the day this is an excellent place to sit and have a coffee, or have lunch and watch the town go about its business. The fountain in the center of the piazza is safe to drink from and is a central gathering point during hot summer afternoons. From about 21:30 to 00:00 on almost every night in the summer the streets around Shadervan are crowded with locals walking the corso, meeting, chatting and drinking.  
42.21085820.7415962 Prizren Hamam, Adem Jashari, (near the center of town, just up from the main post office). It is a distinctive complex of low brick domes. No longer used as public baths, the building is occasionally used for art exhibits. The Hamam of Prizren is an early Ottoman-era monument in which oriental and local traditions combine. It was built in the heart of the city in 1563/4 by Gazi Mehmet Pasha, at the time when he was also building the nearby mosque. The Hamam has two large and nine small domes and is separated into men’s and women’s sections. As one of the most precious Hamams in South-East Europe, it embodies special architectural, historical, cultural and social values. Integrated for centuries in the lives of the citizens, it has become a symbol for the spiritual and cultural heritage of Prizren and its region. The building functioned as a Hamam until 1944. It then served for cheese production, as a warehouse, and later the entrance area was used for cultural events. In state protection since 1954, the Hamam was repaired and maintained until 1981 when it was left at the mercy of time. After the NATO intervention in Kosovo in 1999, some limited measures were undertaken for the monument’s protection.  (updated May 2022)
