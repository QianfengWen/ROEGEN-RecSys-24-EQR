Understand[edit]
Castle of Beja

The municipality of Beja (BEH-zhuh or BAY-zhuh, /ˈbɛ.ʒɐ/ or /ˈbɐj.ʒɐ/) is composed of 18 parishes and is the capital of the District of Beja.
The city is supposed to be the Roman Pax Julia, or Paca, and is still surrounded by remains of old Roman walls, which however, were partly restored during the Middle Ages. Beja was taken from the Moors in 1162 by Afonso Henriques.
Its castle, built by King Dom Diniz, is believed to be the best example of medieval architecture still extant in Portugal. It is a square, massive structure 36.5 m (120 feet) high, from the top of which the whole of the Alentejo country and the Cintra mountains may be seen. The walls of the castle are covered with hieroglyphics.
It was in its early days an episcopal city, but at the time of the invasion by the Moors, it lost its dignity. The Cathedral of Beja is an old temple, though so much modernized as to make it impossible to determine with any degree of certainty its original date.
Other famous churches are those of Our Lady of the Conception, St. Iago, or Santiago, and Santa Maria da Feira, said to have been an old Moorish mosque. The College of St. Sissenando, which belonged to the Jesuits, and was built principally at the expense of Donna Maria Sophia, in 1695, stands in the street where the saint was born. Part of this building is now occupied by the episcopal palace.
The city has modern improvements, schools, banks, libraries, etc. It is said to be the richest in Roman remains of all the cities in Portugal, except Évora, which now possesses a large collection of Roman antiquities collected in Beja.
