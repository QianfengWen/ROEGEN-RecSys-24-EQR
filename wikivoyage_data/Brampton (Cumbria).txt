Brampton is on the historic road between Carlisle and Newcastle upon Tyne, but nowadays bypassed by A69. A689 is a shortcut from Gretna and A74(M) in Scotland. 
Stagecoach Cumbria Bus 685 runs hourly daily from Carlisle and takes 25 min. Most terminate in Brampton but every hour or two they continue to Haltwhistle, Hexham, Corbridge, Heddon-on-the-Wall and Newcastle upon Tyne. Bus 680 from Alston is just an occasional school service. 
There is no bus station in Brampton, buses stop along Front St. 
Trains from Carlisle run every hour or two and take 20 min to Brampton, continuing to Haltwhistle, Hexham, Prudhoe, Metrocentre and Newcastle, another hour. Some go further to Morpeth but don't always stop at Brampton. Change at Carlisle for fast trains from London Euston, Manchester and Glasgow. 
54.9323-2.70351 Brampton station is a mile southeast of town. It's a simple platform halt with ticket machines but no toilets or waiting room. There is level access to the Newcastle-bound platform and a footbridge with no lift for the Carlisle-bound platform. You can reach the latter step-free via a three-mile detour down another lane.

Get around[edit]
The town is compact, but you need wheels for outlying sights and accommodation.
Taxi operators are Brampton Cars (+44 1697 73386), Atkinsons (+44 7810 460982) and Airbus 2000 (+44 1697 73735).

See[edit]
St Martin's Church is on Front St in town centre. It was built in the 1870s (with the tower added in 1906) and is the only church designed by the Pre-Raphaelite architect Philip Webb. The stained glass windows were designed by Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris. (The Earls of Carlisle were paying for all these big talents.) It's an active Anglican church but is often locked outside services, as it has been vandalised.
54.9422-2.73411 Moot Hall is a cute octagonal building in Market Square completed in 1817. Originally the ground floor was an open-plan poultry market; it was enclosed after 1896 when the building was handed over to the town council. The ground floor is now the Tourist Information Centre. The ring in the cobbles outside is no longer used to tether bulls for bull-baiting.
54.9439-2.732 The Motte or Mote is an earthwork cut out of a ridge that in the 12th century had a wooden castle. A statue of the 7th Earl of Carlisle was placed atop in the 19th century.
54.9463-2.76633 Brampton Old Church a mile west of town became redundant when St Martin's was completed. It's an attractive little sandstone building that harks back to the 12th century, and stands upon the site of a fort on Hadrian's Wall. You may be able to get the key from the farm next door, but all interior fittings have been removed.
54.9433-2.80524 Solway Aviation Museum is 3 miles west of town on the airfield, see Carlisle.
Lanercost Priory
54.9307-2.74165 Capon Tree Monument marks the spot where six Jacobite soldiers were brought from Carlisle and hanged on 21 Oct 1746 in the aftermath of their failed uprising. "And the wuddy has her ain, and we twa are left alane, Free o' Carlisle gaol in the dawing..." is the 1876 version of "Bonnie Banks o' Loch Lomond", lamenting those who took the low road by being put to death. It was 12 months since Bonnie Prince Charlie and his men marched south in high hopes, receiving the bloodless surrender of Brampton and continuing to Derby. But the rebellion had little support in England and thereafter retreated and retreated, to be crushed at Culloden. The ancient Capon Tree was a popular meeting place for townsfolk: it died in 1904 and was replaced by the stone monument. A new tree was planted in 2013. The British Legion holds a memorial service here on 21 Oct the anniversary of the executions.
54.9555-2.68896 Naworth Castle is the private residence of the Earls of Carlisle, so you only get to visit in expensive private parties to shoot fish or somesuch. It dates from the 13th century but was embellished and extended in Tudorbethan times. Much of the interior was lost to a fire in 1844 and was re-done in Pre-Raphaelite style.
54.9663-2.69467 Lanercost Priory, Lanercost CA8 2HQ (3 miles northwest of Brampton), ☏ +44 1697 73030. Daily 10AM-5PM. Impressive ruin of an Augustinian priory founded around 1169 and dedicated unusually to Mary Magdalene. Being close to a quarrelsome border it was raided by the Scots, and Edward I stayed here several times. He was ill during his last visit of 1306 and had to stay six months, impoverishing the priests with the cost of accommodating his family and retinue. The Scots King Robert the Bruce arrived in 1311 "committing infinite evils"; later the nations made peace, whereupon the priory was smashed up all over again. It was dissolved in 1538 and fell into ruin. Adult £8.50, child £4.40, concession £7.50.   (updated May 2023)
54.9753-2.66638 Banks East Turret is the mostly westerly point on Hadrian's Wall that much resembles a wall. The wall, military road and fortifications stretched coast to coast but the best sections are further east between Hexham and Greenhead. The route passes a couple of miles north of Brampton, with a clearly marked footpath, but here all the masonry has been spirited away and there's just a shallow earthwork. Further west even that has been ploughed or built over on the approach to Carlisle. See Haltwhistle for Birdoswald Roman Fort near Gilsland, 7 miles northeast of Brampton.
54.891-2.7159 Castle Carrock is a tiny village 3 miles south of Brampton. St Peter's Church, built in 1828, is over the site of the vanished castle.

Hadrian's Wall is best seen further east between  Greenhead and Hexham, where a substantial wall follows the crest of a ridge, and connects Vindolanda, "Robin Hood's Tree" and Housesteads fort.
The Pennine Way joins the wall pathway at Greenhead, following it to Housesteads then branching north to the Scottish border.
Carlisle is a pleasant market town with an impressive castle.
