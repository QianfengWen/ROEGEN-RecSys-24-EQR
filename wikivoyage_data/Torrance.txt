Torrance is a city in the South Bay region of Los Angeles County, in Southern California. Even though it is one of the larger suburbs of Los Angeles (147,000 residents in 2020), it is overlooked by the throngs of tourists that visit LA. Torrance is often called "Japan's 48th Prefecture" due to its large Japanese population, and large Korean and other immigrant populations give the city a very global feel. Visitors wanting a quieter Los Angeles experience will do well to visit Torrance.

Stay safe[edit]
Torrance is a safe city with a low crime rate. Del Amo Mall has experienced some violent crime, but you are unlikely to be assaulted, as long as you don't make anyone mad. Eastern Torrance is not as safe as the rest of Torrance, but again, you are unlikely to fall victim to any crime. Be careful on the Anza Ave. and Halison St. intersection. Accidents involving students from nearby middle school happen once or twice a year. Accidents are also fairly frequent on Hawthorne Boulevard, but are usually collisions with cars, and pedestrians are rarely if not never hit.
Generally, crime in Torrance is related to property, and usually is either in the form of shoplifting or break-ins.
