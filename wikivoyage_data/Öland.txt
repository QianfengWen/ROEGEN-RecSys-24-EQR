Not to be confused with Åland, a group of islands in the northern Baltic Sea, associated with Finland..

Öland is Sweden's second largest island, only Gotland is larger and of more importance. It lies in the Baltic Sea just off the coast of Småland, connected to the mainland by a bridge from Kalmar. Öland is popular among domestic tourists, many Swedes have had a summer cottage here for generations. Öland can be crowded by vacationers from Midsummer to mid-August.

Borgholm Castle
Öland is rather sparsely populated, with most of the land consisting of farm land or in the north woods. Much of the southern cultural landscape is a UNESCO World Heritage Site: Agricultural Landscape of Southern Öland. The island is also popular for summer vacations and among bird watchers.

Settlements[edit]

Talk[edit]
While English is widely known by most Swedes, the level of English spoken in the country side (including Öland) is noticeably lower than, for example, the level of English spoken in Stockholm.
Most tourist information signs will be in Swedish, English, German and in rare cases Dutch and/or French.

Get in[edit]
By plane or train[edit]
The nearest airport and railway is in Kalmar, see that page.

By car, bike or bus[edit]
You get in by car or bus (Kalmar Länstrafik) from Kalmar over the Ölandsbron bridge, the longest bridge in Sweden. Biking over the bridge is prohibited, instead take your bike on the special bike buses summertime or ordinary buses otherwise, or take the ferry.

 Silverlinjen. Service to Öland from Stockholm. 
By ferry[edit]
In summertime, there's a ferry from Kalmar to Färjestaden and back, on which you can bring your bike. It runs from mid-April to mid-August, from around seven in the morning until six in the evening during weekdays. Check Ressel Rederi[dead link] for current schedule. It costs 50 kr for adults and takes about half an hour.
There is a ferry from Oskarshamn to Byxelkrok (northern part of the island).

By yacht[edit]

Öland is a good destination for small craft.

Get around[edit]
Public transport is limited. There is no railway on Öland. and the bus routes and bus departures are relatively few, even though the situation gets a lot better during the tourist season from the beginning of June to the middle of August. Taking the bus, however, remains the most convenient way to get around on the island, since they cover most of the island and can get you within biking distance of interesting sights and beautiful beaches. Bringing a bike would be great and convenient, as passengers are allowed to bring bikes on the buses. It's also the best way to experience the unique landscape of Öland. There are very nice biking trails along the long coast of Öland.

By car[edit]
It is possible to travel by car on Öland and in large parts of the island it is the only means of transport during the non-tourist season. However, the roads are narrow and busy during the tourist season. In the middle of the 20th century, local politicians decided that many small roads should be paved, as the autumn rains, combined with the harvest season and heavy transport, turned the roads into real seas of mud and consequently into completely worn-out roads. Today, most of the roads are in very good condition. As the roads follow centuries-old routes, they pass through many villages of the terraced type and it is important to slow down. Visibility is poor and active farming contributes to the roads becoming easily blocked, especially at harvest time. When parking, it is particularly important to be considerate of other traffic because of the narrowness of the roads.
The main roads often have little side extensions where tourists can park briefly to admire the farming countryside (which can be a brilliant yellow in early May when the rapeseed blooms occur) or the occasional wooden windmill used to power the farm.

By bus[edit]
Kalmar länstrafik  is responsible for transport on the island. On northern Öland (counting from Färjestaden) there are lines 101, 103, 104 and 106. On southern Öland, but furthest to Mörbylånga, there are lines 103 and 105. South of Mörbylånga there is no bus service according to the winter timetable. 1 June-31 July you can buy a summer card that is valid for an unlimited number of journeys. Please note that many of the bus routes only run on school days.

By bike[edit]
Those who want to cycle on Öland have plenty of opportunities to do so. Bicycles can be rented and packages can be booked through the tourist office. During the summer, traffic on road 136 is very heavy, so those who want to cycle would be well advised to choose other, smaller roads. There are three main cycling routes on the island:

Ölandsleden is a 45-mile long signposted cycle route across the island. There are plenty of options for those wanting longer or shorter rides.
Ekoparkcykleden runs through Böda Kronopark on the north of the island and is about 6.5 km (4 miles) long.
Sweden Trail is administered by the Swedish Cycling Society. The island part of this trail runs between Ölands Turistbyrå at the bridgehead up to Grankullavik.
