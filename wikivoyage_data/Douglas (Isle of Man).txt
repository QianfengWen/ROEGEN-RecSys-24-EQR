Douglas (Manx: Doolish) is the capital city of the Isle of Man. It has the island's greatest concentration of visitor facilities along its promenade, so it's the main base for tourism. In 2021 Douglas had a population of 26,677.


Understand[edit]
Horse-drawn tram at Derby Castle terminus
In Gaelic dub glais means "dark stream", from peaty waters. The River Douglas is formed here by the confluence of the Dhoo and Glass streams, but those names may be a back-formation. In the Middle Ages it was a fishing hamlet, with only 13 households when first counted in 1511. In early modern times its harbour made it more important for herring fishing, for maritime defence, for trade with England, and above all for smuggling. The British were so irked by this that they took tighter control, with the Revestment Act of 1765 establishing the island's present status under the crown. Better shipping and more avenues for legitimate trade meant that Douglas outgrew Castletown, until in the 1860s the law courts, parliament and executive offices all moved here. 
Douglas retained its medieval streets until then, authentically smelly and diseased, but a combination of Victorian civic reformist zeal and the prospect of tourism led to its re-building, with the great sweep of hotels, guest houses and other visitor amenities lining its two-mile promenade. It's the island's ferry port, with the airport 9 miles southwest, within a short drive of the rest of the island, and is the obvious base for a tourist stay on the Isle of Man. 
In 2022 Douglas and seven other towns were accorded city status, marking the Platinum Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth. The flummery formalities of this were not quite complete when the good queen died, so this is high on King Charles' to-do list.

Get in[edit]

Isle of Man Airport (IOM IATA) is in Ronaldsway 9 miles south of Douglas. It has flights to several UK cities and to Dublin, see Isle of Man#Get in.
54.148-4.4711 Sea Terminal at the south end of town is the landing point for ferries from Britain and Ireland. See Isle of Man#Get in for routes, some are seasonal. 
Douglas is the hub for all the island's roads and transport. The principal bus routes are #1 and #2 from Port Erin, Port St Mary, Castletown and the airport, #3 from  Ramsey and Laxey, and #4, #5 and #6 from  Peel - see individual towns for details. 
54.1484-4.47782 Lord Street Interchange a block inland from the Sea Terminal is the turnaround point for island buses, which make multiple stops through town. It's just a car park with no passenger facilities.
54.148-4.48543 Douglas Station is the terminus of the narrow-gauge steam-hauled railway from Port Erin via Port St Mary and Castletown, running mid-March to Oct: see Isle of Man#Get around.
54.1671-4.46054 Derby Castle is the terminus of the electric tramway from Ramsey and Laxey, from where a branch line ascends Snaefell. It too runs mid-March to Oct: see Isle of Man#Get around.

Get around[edit]
Douglas is easily walkable.
The horse-drawn tram, established in 1876, plods the length of Douglas promenade Apr-Oct, from Derby Castle to the north to the Sea Terminal and railway station south. However in 2023 because of road works along the promenade, it only plies the northern half, from Broadway to Derby Castle.
Several out-of-town bus routes make stops along the prom.

See[edit]
54.1504-4.46871 Tower of Refuge is the little offshore mock-castle near the ferry terminal. It was built in 1832 on the reef of St Mary's Island (or Conister Rock) after several shipwrecks, notably the mail ship St George. The idea was that survivors cast up on the reef could find shelter until the lifeboat could take them off - there was even a bell to call for assistance and a regularly-replenished loaf of bread to sustain them. The reef is only covered at the highest tides, and at the lowest springs you can wade out to it.
54.1492-4.4762 Jubilee clock near the Sea Terminal commemorates the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria's reign in 1887. This spot was the terminus of the Upper Douglas Cable Tramway, which from 1896 to 1929 hauled people up the stiff gradient to the western neighbourhoods. In the 1970s, the best remaining bits of Trams 72 and 73 were cobbled together as a frankentram 72 / 73 which occasionally has outings on the horse-drawn tramway, and normally lives in Jurby Transport Museum.
Tynwald Legislative Building
54.1508-4.48143 Tynwald, Prospect Hill, ☏ +44 1624 685500. Tour at M 14:00 and F 10:00. The Isle of Man reckons to have the oldest parliament in the world, harking back to 979 AD. That date was pretty-much invented by officialdom without any evidence, a salutary lesson in small-nation politics. What you see today looks like a snooty Victorian hotel, the Legislative Building occupied from 1874 when Tynwald moved from Castletown. As well as the 90 minute tour, you can attend sessions. Free.   (updated Mar 2023)
54.1494-4.48364 St George's Church, 10 Hope St IM1 1LB. Work on this started in 1762 but was hobbled when a crackdown on smuggling reduced the fortunes of its benefactors, and an insolvent bishop mingled those funds with his own. It opened in 1781 and was extended in the 19th century to become the island's senior Anglican church. However the well-to-do had burial rights elsewhere, so its graveyard caters to the more raffish or transient. (updated Mar 2023)
54.1544-4.48195 Manx Museum, Kingswood Grove IM1 3LY, ☏ +44 1624 648000. Daily 09:30-16:30. Fascinating museum of the history and the natural history of the Isle of Man, plus the national art gallery. Displays include the Viking reign, Tynwald, Mann at War, the TT races, and island tourism. Free.   (updated Mar 2023)
54.1619-4.47336 Castle Mona is a work in progress, or less kindly a bit of a mess. It was completed in 1804 as the Governor General's residence, a castellated square mansion. It became a swanky hotel in 1831, later adding a casino and entertainment complex. From the 1990s it was tatty and lowlife, closing in 2006. It's been acquired by Tevir, an IOM-based property company, who have stripped away some of the tacky modern additions but haven't announced their plans for it.
Further out[edit]
54.1433-4.46737 Camera Obscura on Douglas Head was built in the 1890s: it projects a panorama of its surroundings onto the walls of its darkened interior. It remains closed in 2023.

The Isle of Man is regarded as a county within the English FA system and doesn't field a national team, except for occasional beer matches against the likes of Guernsey.
