Lawrenceville is a city in Georgia, on the outskirts of Metro Atlanta.


Understand[edit]
Lawrenceville came into being on December 15, 1821 and is the county seat of Gwinnett County, which was formed exactly 3 years prior. Lawrenceville was the second city founded in the greater Atlanta area. The location for the original town square was chosen due to its close proximity to multiple springs.
Lawrenceville was named after Captain James Lawrence who was commander of the frigate Chesapeake. During a battle with H. M. S Shannon on June 1, 1813, off the coast near Boston, Massachusetts captain Lawrence was mortally wounded. His dying words were, "Don't give up the ship."
In 1978 Larry Flynt, publisher of Hustler Magazine, was shot on the Lawrenceville courthouse square allegedly by Joseph Paul Franklin.
