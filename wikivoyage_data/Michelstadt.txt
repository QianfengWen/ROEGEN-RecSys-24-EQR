Marktplatz with fountain and Rathaus
Michelstadt[dead link] is in South Hesse within the Odenwald region.


Understand[edit]
The highlight of Michelstadt is its picturesque medieval town centre.

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
The Odenwaldbahn serves Michelstadt with trains running roughly every hour from the Darmstadt Hauptbahnhof. The trip from Darmstadt takes roughly 1 hour. Michelstadt, like Darmstadt, is within the public transportation network of the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund (RMV). If 2-5 people are doing a day trip from Darmstadt, then a group day ticket (Gruppentageskarte) will be much more economical than buying single trip tickets.

By car[edit]
About one hour drive east of Bensheim
