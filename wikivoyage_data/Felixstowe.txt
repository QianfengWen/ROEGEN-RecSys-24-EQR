See[edit]
Port of Felixstowe
Felixstowe Ferry is perhaps the most charming part of the town. It's in the far north, beyond the golf club, at the mouth of the River Deben. It's a popular place for sailing and walks. It has good real ale pub (see below). It is best to park at the cliff top car park as there is little parking at Felixstowe ferry.
The promenade stretches 1 mile north and south of the pier two limes in total, and expect for a small length there is a good path (it is part of the Suffolk Coast long distance path) between Landguard Fort and Felixstowe Ferry. North is generally quite pleasant, with landscaped gardens and quiet shingle beaches.
In the centre of the tourist area, by the sea, there are some excellent arcades, including the famous Mannings Amusement Park (including crazy golf). There is a Sunday market beside Mannings, and a car boot sale on Saturday
Further south the beach gives way to a very industrialised dock area. In the middle of this is a little wildlife haven, around Landguard Fort. It's popular with bird watchers.
The sea shore is the site of the last opposed invasion of England in 1667 and the first land battle of the Royal Marines. The fort was built in the 18th century, modified in the 19th century with substantial additional 19th- and 20th-century outside batteries. The fort is open every day from Easter to October.
The nearby submarine mining building houses Felixstowe museum’s collections of local interest and is open Sundays & Wednesdays in summer.

51.97221.38013 Walton Castle is now only visible on spring low tides. It was built late 3rd century as part of the "Saxon Shore" ring of defenses when the Romans panicked about their fragile empire. It stood on cliffs on the coast, but cliffs, castle and village of Walton were all eaten by the sea circa 1750.

51.89521.48055 Sealand (Roughs Tower) (7 miles offshore). A Maunsell sea fort in the North Sea, two squat pillars supporting a platform, built in 1943 as an anti-aircraft position. At that time it lay in international waters, as the territorial boundary was only 3 nautical miles out, just over 4 imperial miles. It was decommissioned in the 1950s but in 1965 became a pirate radio station, beyond UK broadcasting law. The rival broadcaster Paddy Bates ousted the original pirates but never began broadcasting himself, instead claiming the tower as the independent "Principality of Sealand". He later added the business of passports, currency and the like. In 1978 the tower was briefly captured by rival pirates, German businessmen planning a casino. They were ejected but declared themselves the Sealand government in exile, and set up a trade in Sealand passports, selling some 4000 for $1000 a time to Hong Kong residents trying to escape the Chinese takeover. Meanwhile in 1987 the UK extended its territorial limits from 3 to 12 nautical miles, so Sealand is now firmly British. (The UK was surely tempted to offer it to the Chinese in exchange for keeping Hong Kong?) This has curbed further attempts to exploit its status, for instance as a data haven and "dark web" host. Paddy Bates died in 2012. His family continue to assert property rights and stage occasional stunts, such as a Sealand football team, but nobody now lives there.   (updated Sep 2023)
