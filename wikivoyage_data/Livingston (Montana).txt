Understand[edit]
Livingston retains much of its Old West history. 436 buildings in it are on the National Historic Register.
The railroad was the main economic power for over a century. It is the reason the towns of Wilsall and Clyde Park to the north were created. Another nearby town is Springdale, 20 miles east.

Get in[edit]
Livingston is at the junction of Interstate 90 and US 89 along the banks of the mighty Yellowstone River and at the northern edge of Gallatin National Forest and 54 miles north of Yellowstone National Park.

Fishing[edit]
Yellowstone River just south of Livingston.
World famous area for fly fishing, outfitters can be found in most cities and many towns and rural areas. Ask at local fly shops and check river conditions online. June is high water month due to snow melting at higher elevations so can make rivers treacherous and water muddy and difficult to fish.

Hiking[edit]
nearby Livingston in Gallatin National Forest
There are a huge number of day and over night hikes in the area. Check with local forest service offices for details and trail conditions before heading out and maybe more importantly remember to report back to them if you see something noteworthy. A fresh elk kill on the trail could mean that a bear is nearby for example. Know the 10 basics needed for all back country camping and that cell phones are not one of them, cell phones often don't work in rural mountainous areas. Topo maps are also available in local camping and fishing stores.

Stay safe[edit]
When you're out exploring remember this is bear country. Be bear aware while fishing or camping. Plenty of other wildlife may come close. Remember they are wild and can react badly to people. Keep your distance and enjoy watching.
Even though the streams look crystal clear, giardia parasites can be present. Do not drink from the stream (unless you boil the water) or you could be very sick.
