Geography[edit]
View (looking east) of the banks of Boucherville, near boulevard Marie-Victorin
The territory of Boucherville stretches over 9.1 km (5.7 mi) on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River. This shore faces the Îles de Boucherville and partly the Îles de Varennes. In the summer season, boaters do a lot of boating in the channels between these islands: barbecue on the water, overnight stopover, swimming, fishing, sailing, water skiing, etc. In winter, many ice fishing enthusiasts pierce the ice to indulge in this favourite activity. In all seasons, the river is a theatrical scene where maritime life is hectic: passage of large ships, sailboats, pleasure craft, storms, waves, migratory birds.
Besides the St. Lawrence River, the two other main rivers in the territory of Boucherville are the Rivière aux Pins and the Rivière Sabrevois.

Climate[edit]
The average annual temperature in Boucherville is 6.2°C.
July is the hottest month of the year with an average of 20.9°C while January has the lowest average temperature of the year with an average of -10.1°C. Rainfall is about 975 mm.

History[edit]
Monument erected along boulevard Marie-Victorin in honor of Jeanne Crevier and Pierre Boucher
Founded in 1667 by Pierre Boucher and remained a seigneury for several decades, Boucherville is one of the oldest towns in Quebec. In 1843, a tragic fire destroyed almost the entire village. A few years after this incident, in 1856, Boucherville was divided into two distinct municipalities: village and parish. 
Today, the city is mainly residential, but nevertheless has a very interesting shoreline with a beautiful view of the Boucherville islands and its old historic center has retained its charm.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Boucherville is located at the intersection of highway no 20 and road no 132, directly at the exit of the "Louis-H.-Lafontaine" bridge-tunnel. Several exits serve the city.
