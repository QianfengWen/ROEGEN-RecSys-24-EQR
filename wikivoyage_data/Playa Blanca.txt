Playa Blanca is a beach resort and ferry port on the south coast of Lanzarote, some 50 km southwest of the capital Arrecife. It's part of the municipality of Yaiza, but  with a population of 12,960 in 2021 it has far outgrown that village.


Understand[edit]
The resort is named for the central white beach - Playa Blanca - in a 9-km wide bay on the south coast of Lanzarote. Playa Flamingo is the western beach within the bay and Playa Dorada the eastern. These are mostly sandy, and sheltered by volcanic hills from the Atlantic wind and waves, so they're good for swimming and sunbathing. They're backed by restaurants, retail and hotels (mostly low rise) and there's a ferry port and a leisure marina. What's called "Papagayo Beach" is a series of sandy coves 3 km southeast of town.

Get in[edit]

Highway LZ-2 runs from Arrecife and the airport to Playa Blanca, about 40 km. 
Bus 60 / 62 runs from Arrecife via Intercambiador, Playa Honda, Tías, Uga and Yaiza to Playa Blanca ferry pier, every 30 min M-F and hourly Saturday and Sunday.  
Bus 161 runs from Arrecife Airport (ACE IATA) T1 and T2 via Puerto del Carmen and Yaiza to the ferry pier. It costs €3.30 (Jan 2023) and runs M-F every 30 min, Saturday hourly and Sunday every 2 hours. On Sunday it might be quicker to take Bus 23 towards Arrecife and change at the Intercambiador west edge of the city for Bus 60 / 62.
28.8645-13.83141 Estacion de Guaguas the bus station is a roof covered drop-off and bus parking lot with squalid toilets. Buses towards Puerto del Carmen, the airport and Arrecife stop across the road, on the northbound carriageway of Av de las Canarias.
28.8589-13.83382 Playa Blanca Port is the landing point for Fred Olsen car ferries from Corralejo on Fuerteventura. These sail hourly and take 30 min, for a fare in 2023 of €32 per adult foot passenger, €45 per car plus driver. 
Lineas Romero ferries compete on this route, sailing five times a day for €20 per adult, foot passengers only.

Get around[edit]
The central area is compact and walkable but the town sprawls 8 km east-west. 
Playa Blanca has an e-scooter sharing system. You can take one anywhere and leave it anywhere in the designated area. The service is provided by Superpedestrian Link Scooters and can be used with their app. In 2023 it costs €1 to unlock then €0.30 per minute.
Bus 30 traverses town every 30 min, from Montaña Roja in the west via the ferry pier and Estación de Guaguas to Sandos Papagayo in the east. The fare in 2023 is €1.40, pay the driver in cash, they give change up to €10.
Taxis are readily available, but "Taxi" at the foot of Av de Papagayo is just a coffee shop.

See[edit]
Marina Rubicón
28.8556-13.87251 Faro de Punta Pechiguera is the lighthouse at the tip of Lanzarote, a gaunt white cylinder alongside its low-set predecessor. The approach path is rough, and you only come for the view of Fuerteventura and the sunset.
28.8698-13.85612 Montaña Roja is the volcano looming west of town centre. You can hike to the crater rim and down into the caldera.
Marina Rubicón is the leisure boat harbour, surrounded by shops and restaurants. At night you can see the lights of Corralejo on Fuerteventura twinkling across the channel.
28.8559-13.81093 Castillo de San Marcial de Rubicón de Femés is a stubby tower east end of the marina, first built in 1742 to guard against pirates. There's no entry, but those naughty pirates ignored the sign and torched it.
28.9149-13.84734 Los Charcones are pools formed by the rocks. Some are dinky and you look for crabs, others are suitable for bathing in calm conditions, while others are exposed and the returning surf could sweep you out to sea. All of them are popular with sea urchins. In strong weather there are blowholes. Charcones are all along the west coast but this is the best group, reached by a 2 km dirt track past an abandoned hotel. This track is nowadays closed to vehicles.
Do[edit]
The Spoon in Concrete is on the seafront, near Av Marítima 44. Yes, it's just a spoon set into the pavement surface, and your task is 1) to find it, and 2) contrive to get a thrill out of the quest and discovery.

Dino Water Park[dead link] on C Francia is small, worn, and less fun.
Scuba diving is year-round, with water temperatures always close to 20 °C (68 °F) and visibility over 25 m (82 ft). Centres include Diving Lanzarote Toninas[dead link], Dawn Dives, Dive College, Bonito Diving, Pura Vida, Windblue Sports, Lanzarote Nonstop Divers and Rubicón.
Playa Flamingo west of the ferry port and Iberostar Hotel is sheltered by breakwaters so it's calm for kiddy-bathing. It's popular for shore-based diving: you head out over the sand to a drop-off. The "Blue Hole" is a short swim-through, entered at 26 m and you pop out at 18 m.
Playa del Pozo
Playa Blanca ("white beach") is central and gives its name to the town: it's sandy but small.
Playa Dorada east side is larger and sheltered by breakwaters.
Playa de Colorados is east by Sandos Papagayo Resort: it's black lava, so you come here for water sports not beach lounging.
Museo Atlántico is an underwater sculpture park off Playa de Coloradas. The sculptures are in 12-14 m depth and are especially appreciated by nervous novice divers.
Playa Mujeres and Playa del Pozo are attractive sandy beaches a few km further southeast. You need transport to enjoy them: there's a €3 road toll.
Golf: sorry, "golfo" is just the Spanish word for a gulf or sea inlet. The nearest 18-hole course is on LZ-505 between Tías and Puerto del Carmen.
Buy[edit]
Supermarkets cluster near the roundabout at the foot of Av de Papagayo, for example Hiperdino Express, open daily 08:00-22:00.
Centro Comercial Rubicón is a shopping centre on C El Berrugo by the marina, open daily 08:00-22:00.
Marina Market is held at Av Marítima 159F on Wednesdays and Saturdays 09:00 to 14:00.
Eat[edit]
Beachfront eating places face the midday sun, so lunchtimes indoors can be stifling. They're more comfortable at dusk.
