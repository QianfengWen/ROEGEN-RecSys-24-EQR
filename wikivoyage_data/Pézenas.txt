If you want to drive somewhere: Carrefour sells petrol/diesel and is just on the outskirts of town. There is also a Total garage in the same vicinity. Reportedly, none of the hypermarkets in Pezenas sell road fuel. There are several petrol stations in the town, but these are expensive when compared with hypermarkets. It is best to visit hypermarkets in Béziers about 20km south, or Clermont l'Hérault 15km North, for cheap fuel.
