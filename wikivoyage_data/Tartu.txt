Tartu (formerly known as Dorpat or Yuryev) is the second largest city in Estonia with a population of 94,000 (2019).


Understand[edit]
Tartu Town Hall, where the Tourist Information Centre is
Tartu is a Hanseatic city and a university town. It is the oldest city in Estonia, dating back to 1030. Its ancient name of 'Tarbatu' was shortened to 'Tartu' in Estonian and to 'Dorpat' in German. Although large parts of the town were destroyed in World War II, Tartu still has a charming old town surrounded by large parks (some of which used to be fully built-up neighbourhoods before the war).
Tartu is 185 km southeast of Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. The Emajõgi River, which connects the two largest lakes of Estonia, flows for 10 km within the city limits.

Talk[edit]
Since Tartu is a student town, English is widely understood. As usual, the older people are more likely to only speak Estonian and Russian; however most can understand English if you speak clearly.

By plane[edit]
If arriving on a commercial flight, your main option is Tallinn, which is only 180 km away with buses and trains to Tartu running directly from the airport.
Alternatively, Riga (250 km from Tartu) may be an option as well - buses from the Riga Bus Station to Tartu are operated by Lux Express.
58.3105726.6905821 Tartu Airport (TAY  IATA) (10 km south of the city centre). No longer served by commercial flights, so you'll need to charter a plane or fly your own. The airport is little more than an embarkation/disembarkation point. To rent a car, book in advance. Don't expect any food at the airport.   (updated Apr 2020)
 Airport Shuttle. Bus operating between the airport and the city. Free. (updated Jul 2019)
By bus[edit]
Buses arrive at the small 58.37808326.7321282 Tartu Bus Station at Turu 2, which is across the street from the Kaubamaja department store, 5-10 min walk from the central square of Tartu. The tiny building hosts a ticket office, luggage room, decent cafeteria, and R-kiosk. If you need more, head to the nearby shopping mall. When arriving from Tallinn, you can also get off the bus at one of the stops in the city centre.
Buses from Tallinn depart several times an hour between 05:00 and midnight, and stop at the Tallinn airport. The journey takes 2.5 to 3 hours and costs €2-10, before a discount available with an ISIC card. Some buses have free wireless internet and free drinks available. Note that Friday afternoon departures from Tartu to Tallinn (and Sunday night Tallinn-to-Tartu) are usually crowded during the school year as lots of students go home for the weekend.
Regular buses also run between Tartu and Narva (3 hr), Viljandi (1 hr), Pärnu (2½ hr), and Kuressaare (6 hr).
Tartu is a stop of international buses running between Saint Petersburg (8 hr) and Riga (4 hr). These buses typically run overnight, which makes their schedule from Tartu somewhat inconvenient. Another international route is from Tartu to Pskov in Russia (4 hr, websites and timetables use the Estonian name Pihkva).
Bus and train schedules within Estonia are easily available online – read more under Estonia#Get around.

By train[edit]
Tartu railway station
58.37382226.7068363 Tartu railway station (Tartu raudteejaam), Vaksali 6 (Tartu railway station is located only 1 km from the city center (end of J. Kuperjanovi street), but it is not in the city centre, and it is not well signposted either. The easiest way to find the train station is to follow Riia street uphill until you see the railway, and turn right along the tracks.). The station building amply adorned with wooden carvings is a nice example of Estonian architecture. Inside, you won't find more than a kiosk (not even an R-kiosk!) and a ticket machine.   (updated Mar 2021)
Elron operates several daily trains between Tartu and Tallinn via Tapa. The journey takes 2 hr (express train) to 2½ hr (regular train) and costs €11 for 2nd class and €14 for 1st class on an express train, or €10 for 2nd class and €12 for 1st class on a regular train. Tickets are 10% cheaper online. There is free Wi-Fi and tables with electric outlets on trains. 1st class passengers get more comfortable seats and may book a specific seat online.
Trains also run between Tartu and Valga on the Latvian border, with one daily connection further to Riga (5 hr). Railway tracks likewise go in the direction of Russia, but you can only reach the small station of Koidula on the Russian border. This station is less than 1 km from the 24/7 checkpoint, which is open for pedestrians. Once you are on the Russian side, catch a taxi or walk to the bus station of Pechory (2 km from the border), and continue to Pskov by bus.

By car[edit]
An excellent day trip is to drive from Tallinn to Tartu. Outside of Tallinn, it is a two-lane paved road with some construction ongoing to upgrade it. It takes two to two and a half hours. There are few sights of interest along the way. The terrain is flat and most of the road is bracketed by a birch trees and a few pines. Sam's Grill (about halfway between Tallinn and Tartu) or a bit fancier Põhjaka Mõis are recommended as a place to stop. There is a gas station (Statoil) some km away.

By boat[edit]
There are also ferry services between Tartu and Lake Peipus and Lake Lämmijärv. Check with the Tourist Information Centre, or inquire at the river directly.

Get around[edit]
On foot[edit]
Tartu can be easily explored by walking. It's only a 20-minute walk from the train station to the old town, and a beautiful 30-min walk from old town to the Estonian National Museum.

By bicycle[edit]
Tartu can be easily seen by bike, because of its small size. Tartu has 750 city bikes, and 500 of them are electric. Electric bikes can be recognized by a lightning bolt and missing gears. There are 69 bike docks in Tartu. If the bike dock is full, you can lock the bike near the dock using lock in basket.
Prices are €5 for 1 day, €10 for a week and €30 for a year. 10 day bus tickets can also be used. Bikes can be used for 60 minutes after which you have to bring them back to dock, where you can get another 60 minutes. If you don't bring the bike to dock in 60 minutes you have to pay €1 for every hour you're late. If you don't bring the bike back in 5 hours, you have to pay €80.
For unlocking bikes you need to download Tartu Smart Bike app or use bus card. Available bikes can be seen online.
