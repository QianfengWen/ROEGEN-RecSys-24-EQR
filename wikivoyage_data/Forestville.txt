Driving around Forestville is the easiest mode of transit. Traffic is rarely busy, and parking is abundant. A car will allow you to explore the mostly rural, but beautiful areas. One should take care along Pocket Canyon, and Maribel Rd though, as logging trucks are known for speeding around the very tight turns.
Although there are no designated bike lanes in the town, it remains one of the most popular modes of transit. As always, be aware of transit on the busier routes, and do not leave your bicycle attended outside unless locked up.
Walking is a great way to see the small town, visit the coffee house, and few local shops. Downtown can be walked from one end to the other in about fifteen minutes.
