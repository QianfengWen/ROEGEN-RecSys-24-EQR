History[edit]
Unlike many other towns in Alberta, Athabasca predates the railway. It was the terminus of the Edmonton to Athabasca Landing trail. Athabasca lies on a southern protrusion of the Athabasca River. During the fur trade era, when rivers were the principal means of transportation, the Athabasca–Edmonton trail connected two different drainage basins. The Athabasca River flows north and is part of the Mackenzie River watershed, which leads to the Arctic Ocean. Edmonton lies across a height-of-land on the North Saskatchewan River in the Nelson River drainage basin, which empties into Hudson Bay. Edmonton was in Rupert's Land but not Athabasca. The trail allowed goods to be portaged back and forth between river systems. Once agricultural settlement occurred, the trail served a similar purpose. Eventually, road and rail links would trace the same path.
The Athabasca Heritage Society has put up signs through the downtown as well as along the riverfront that explain and depict the history. It has also published a historical walking tour that is available from the town office, library and visitor information centre.

The Athabasca train station was built in 1912 on 50th Avenue, the main east-west road through town.
Amber Valley & Obadiah Place: Obadiah Place is associated with the Africn-American settlement of the Amber Valley area, and two of the community’s leading citizens, Willis Reese Bowen and his son Obadiah Bowen. In 1911, a group of Black Americans emigrated from Oklahoma and filed for homestead on lands north of Edmonton and east of Athabasca Landing. Obadiah Place was settled by Willis Reese Bowen in 1913. Bowen’s log cabin served as a central part of the community, and housed the first post office. The log cabin was replaced in 1938 by Obadiah Bowen, his son, who built the current house.
