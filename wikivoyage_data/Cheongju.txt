Not to be confused with nearby Chungju
Cheongju (청주,淸州), also spelled Chongju, is the capital of North Chungcheong, South Korea.

Sangdangsanseong — Sangdang fortress

Understand[edit]
Cheongju, in addition to being the provincial capital, is also a historic city credited with creating the world's oldest movable metal type print book: jikji. Do not expect to get a glimpse of the UNESCO-registered artifact as the Jikji (or what remains of it) is stored in France. Nonetheless, Cheongju is proud of its place in international history and hailed 2011 as a Jikji celebration year.
For a domestic traveler however, perhaps Cheongju's most notable asset is that it houses one of Korea's major domestic (with a few international routes) airports, serving Cheongju and the nearby major city of Daejeon.

Go next[edit]
The metropolitan sprawl of Daejeon and the rotting early-1990s glory of its Expo Park are only an hour away by bus. Alternately, North Chungcheong Province's most convenient hub, Chungju and its most iconic natural landmarks can be found at Danyang, are both a short hop away.
For access details, see Korea's Express Bus website[dead link]. However there are many buses that are not listed on here that also go from Cheongju, including buses to Gyeongju, Incheon Airport, Nam (South) Seoul, SongniSan and pretty much every other place you could ever want to go. Without going to the terminal it can be really difficult to get English-language information about bus timetables. The information office is next to the Cheongju Intercity Bus Terminal and should be able to help you out if you need it.
About 25 km southeast of Cheongju is the town of Boeun, which is the gateway to Beopjusa, one of the more famous Buddhist temples in Korea and location of the tallest Buddha statue in Korea.
