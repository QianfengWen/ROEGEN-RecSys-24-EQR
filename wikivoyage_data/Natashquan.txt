Natashquan is a village in the region of Minganie, in the North Shore region of eastern Quebec, also an Innu Indian reserve on the Route des Baleines and the Route Nature aux mille délices (gourmet route).
The main tourist attractions of Natashquan are:

the story of Gilles Vigneault and his work of artistic life: songs, poems, stories... The story of this character is described in museums and told by the elders of the village;
museums and historical sites telling the rich history of fishing, shipwrecks, the artist Gilles Vigneault, local arts or recounting isolated life before the arrival of electricity, snowmobiles and Route 138;
hiking trails (including boardwalks) or cycling; the "Les Galets" (The Pebbles) and "Le Pas du Portageur trails" are must-sees;
campsites: municipal, Nutshimit and wilderness camping;
salmon fishing;
Pointe-Parent Innu reserve which presents distinctive cultural activities;
its vast wild territory allowing snowmobile expeditions in winter, in particular via the Route Blanche which joins Blanc-Sablon.
From 1996 to 2013, Natashquan was the end point east of Route 138, which runs along the north shore of the St. Lawrence River and Gulf, which generated a tourist development. In 1959, a first segment of road linked Aguanish and Natashquan. In 2013, another segment of Route 138 was opened up to Kégaska, further east.


Understand[edit]
The village of Natashquan is the birthplace of the famous Quebec poet and singer Gilles Vigneault. It is thanks to him that all Quebecers know the name of the small village. The name "Natashquan" comes from the word innu-aimun Nutashkuan which means "where the bear is hunted". This name is in fact borne by two distinct entities: the township municipality and the Indian reserve. The municipality has a population of 264 inhabitants and the reserve has 841. However, the reserve only covers 0.65 km2 (0.25 sq mi) while that the municipality covers 203.51 km2 (78.58 sq mi).
Natashquan is one of the only places in Quebec where the Fête de la Mi-Carême, a traditional French carnival celebration, is still celebrated.
