Sequim is a small city on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington (state). Sequim's main claim to fame is that, because of the rain shadow created by the Olympic Mountains to the south, it is the sunniest place in Western Washington, receiving much less rain than even nearby Port Angeles. This unique climate makes it an exceptional place to grow lavender, surpassed only by Provence in France. You may want to bring a bucket to pick lavender, strawberries, raspberries and blackberries. Sequim is also famous for the flavorful native Dungeness crab.

Get around[edit]
Map of Sequim
Sequim is rather sprawling, and a car is the best way to get around. Although the core town is so small that you could walk the length of town in under an hour, many of the highlights - such as the lavender farms - lie on the outskirts. So if you're without a car, you should at least bring - or rent - a bicycle. Washington Street, running east-west, is the main commercial street. There is a small, somewhat walkable downtown, centered around the intersection of Washington Street and Sequim Avenue.
