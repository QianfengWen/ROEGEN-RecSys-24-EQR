Sosnowiec is a city in the Silesian Voivodeship of southern Poland, with a population of 189,178 in 2022. It's industrial, and part of the GZM metropolis centred on Katowice 10 km west. 


Understand[edit]
Sosna means pine forests, and a series of small towns emerged in the woods of Upper Silesia in the 12th century and fortified themselves. They only grew and coalesced from the 18th century with industries based on wool, coal and iron: the shallow coal deposits were soon worked out so the miners had to dig down 1000 m, but the deeper seams were rich. Even richer grew the mill and colliery owners, so Sosnowiec was embellished by their fancy mansions, plus the occasional church to show off their spiritual wealth. These smokestack industries dwindled in the late 20th century but the heritage of mansions and churches survives.

Sa 09:00-13:00, 17:30-18:30, Su 07:30-14:00. This is the only remaining Orthodox church in Sosnowiec. It was built 1888/89 funded by wealthy industrialists keen to stay on good terms with Russia. Its patron saints Vera, Nadia and Luba - literally Faith, Hope and Love - were daughters of St Sophia of Rome (d 304 AD). Hagiographers disagree on whether it was Sophia herself or her daughters who were martyred, but Emperor Diocletian was out to get them all.   (updated Mar 2024)

He was shot during the 1905-07 uprising against Russian rule and harsh living conditions, and in 1919-21 the building was the headquarters of another uprising.

50.22935319.15772211 Three Emperors' Corner  at the south edge of Mysłowice is a former tripoint, at the confluence of the Black and White Przemsza rivers. (The Black is stained by flowing over outcrops of coal.) Poland was carved up by the Great Powers in 1772, and from 1871 to 1918 the three banks of the confluence lay in different empires: the German, the Russian Empire, and Austria-Hungary. Germany made a thing of this, erecting the Bismark Tower here and organising river cruises to admire it. All three empires collapsed at the end of the First World War and the spot lay within re-unified Poland, while the tower was neglected and fell down. There's a small monument but what would more improve the area is a footbridge, to re-unite a park that still feels partitioned.
