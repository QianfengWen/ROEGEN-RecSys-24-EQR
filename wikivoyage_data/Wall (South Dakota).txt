Wall, South Dakota, "the geographic center of nowhere," is probably known best to cross-country travellers for its main attraction, Wall Drug. Advertised on gigantic billboards for hundred of miles to the west and east on Interstate 90, the gargantuan drug store has put Wall on the nation's map. There are also Wall Drug signs all over the world telling how many miles to Wall Drug.


Get in[edit]
Wall is on Interstate 90 just north of the Badlands of South Dakota and just east of Rapid City. It is served by Jefferson Lines buses.

43.993231-102.2417951 Wall Drug, 510 Main St (main exit off the interstate), ☏ +1 605 279-2175. 6:30AM-6PM daily. In 1931 the store's entrepreneurial owners, Ted and Dorothy Hustead, had the brainstorm idea to give away free icewater for passing motorists. They started to put up signs and billboards along the highway with the distance to Wall Drug. These signs have been spread around the world and to extreme polar reaches. It is joked that based solely on the billboards, future archaeologists will probably consider Wall Drug to be the most important building on the North American continent. From this seed of signs and billboards grew the tourist attraction that Wall Drug is today: giftshops, museums, restaurants, and of course the original drug store. Get a bumper sticker while you're there; it's the mark of a true cross-country traveler. Free (includes ice water and bumper sticker).
