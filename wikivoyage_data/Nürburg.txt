Do[edit]
 Nürburgring. Plenty of potential on no race days. You can drive your own car on the track, but at your own risk and your insurance will not cover you or your car. Tickets can be bought on site (about €30 for a lap on a weekend) and parking is available. Or get totally scared as co-pilot with a professional driver. Also a go-kart track in the centre of the circuit.
