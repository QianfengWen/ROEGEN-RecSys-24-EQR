Kerkrade is a city in the South Limburg region, in the Dutch province of Limburg.


Understand[edit]
Rolduc Abbey played a major role in the history of Kerkrade.Throughout most of its history, modern day Kerkrade was part of the historic city of Herzogenrath. The South Limburg area was commonly disputed between different duchies and nations around it, and Herzogenrath changed hands repeatedly. It was ruled over time by the Duchy of Brabant, by Spain and later by the French. When the Kingdom of the Netherlands was formed after the French revolutionairy and Napoleonic wars, the area's ownership was determined at the Vienna Congress. There, the border was drawn right through the middle of historic Herzogenrath, creating the two adjoining towns of Kerkrade in the Netherlands and modern day Herzogenrath in Germany. When the Belgians declared their independence, they claimed the Kerkrade area as their own, but Dutch ownership was eventually restored in 1839.
In 1104, a abbey was founded in former Herzogenrath, by an Angustian priest named Ailbertus. After his death, his bones were buried in the abbey's crypt. The monks of Rolduc started coal mining activities in the area in the 18th century and received the sole right to exploit the coal mines on Kerkrade's soil in 1723. They thus laid the foundations for what would become the main economic activity in the town and the whole region.
At the beginning of the 20th century, the first state mines were opened. Coal mining became the beating heart of the region's economy and the main source of income for many of its people. When all the mines were closed in the 1960s, Kerkrade became somewhat impoverished. Still considered one of the underdeveloped parts of the region by some, Kerkrade is not a main travelers' destination. However, as renovations and facilities development take place, the town is gaining tourist popularity rapidly.
Travelers who do take the effort to visit Kerkrade will find a good number of interesting sights as well a good attractions in and directly around town.

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
There is a train station in Kerkrade, which is served by regional trains and connects the town to Landgraaf and Heerlen. In Heerlen there's a rail connection to the intercity trains to and from the north
Heerlen. In Landgraaf you can change for the German towns of Herzogenrath or Aachen

By bus[edit]
Bus lines lead to other Dutch towns in the region as well as to Aachen and Herzogenrath in Germany. However, not all of them pass through the main bus station in the city center so check which stop to use[dead link]. Many buses stop at the Parkstad Limburg stadion or Gaiapark, which is still a good distance from the town center. However, you can easily change there for buses to Kerkrade center.

Line 44 between Heerlen and Aachen passes through
Line 41 runs between Kerkrade and Sittard via Heerlen and Hoensbroek
Line 30 goes to Herzogenrath
Line 28 runs from Schinveld to Kerkrade Bleijerheide via Heerlen
By car[edit]
There are two main roads connecting Kerkrade to the outside world:

N300 in the direction of Simpelveld, which connects there to the N281 and the E14/A76
N299 in the direction of Landgraaf and Brunssum
By plane[edit]
The nearest airport is Maastricht-Aachen airport, with a few international connections. As for the rest of the region, larger Dutch, Belgian and German airports are within reasonable travel distance, so consider:

Eindhoven Airport, 113 km or ~2 hr by train
Düsseldorf Airport, 107 km or ~2½ hr by train
Brussels Airport, 134 km
Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, 227 km or ~3 hours by train
Get around[edit]

The city center is doable on foot and buses are good to get to specific places a bit further away. The main bus station is on the Rolduckerweg, at the corner of Poststraat.

By bike[edit]
A  bike is a fine way to see town and a few villages around, but renting one here can be a bit of a challenge. Ask at the tourist information office in the Continium museum, or rent your bike in a more touristic town in the area.

By car[edit]
Parking is quite abundantly available but in the center you usually have to pay. Large free parking places can be found at Diepenbrockstraat (near the Rodahal), Einderstraat and Old Hickeryplein.

Stay safe[edit]
Kerkrade, as so many other cities and places in Limburg, is a hub of drug trafficking. Crime goes hand in hand with these practices. If you just want to smoke a joint, go to one of the legalized "coffee shops".
Prostitution in lawful in the Netherlands and there are some of these brothels in Kerkrade. Getting in bed with a street prostitute carries a very high risk of getting an STD. Stay safe: if going to a brothel always use a condom.
Meeting "junkies" and wanderers, which happens occasionally at supermarkets and in city centres, is a hassle as they are often asking for money. Locals find this annoying, since they already have an income from the state to survive and are often begging to obtain money to purchase illegal street drugs. Giving money to drug addicts encourages drug-related crime and might also encourage other beggars to panhandle you. Normally, these people do not pick-pocket your wallet but, as in any city in the world, keep an eye on your personal items.
