Canoe/kayak[edit]
The north of Lake Bourget (Portout, Conjux, Chatillon), the Upper Rhone and the Savières Canal that connects them, lend themselves nicely to the casual Canoeing. Browse the lagoons in silence, observe the many birds nesting between Chautagne and Marais de Lavours, gettin up close to the fauna of the abundant reed-beds, and even seeing the beavers before their characteristic dive, are among the attractions of this preserved territory. Canoeing activity is regulated by a charter of "good practice" so as not to disturb the ecosystem. If you do not have your own equipment, you can rent it at Camping de Saumont 3 * 73310 Ruffieux.
For more energetic canoe sports, the French Canoeing Federation organises a marathon each spring on the Rhone between Seyssel and Yenne, and the Nautical Station of Lake Bourget also organises multiple events including the now famous "Translac".
