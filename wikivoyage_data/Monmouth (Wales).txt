Monmouth (Welsh: Trefynwy) is the county town of Monmouthshire in Wales.


Understand[edit]
Monnow Bridge
Monmouth is a delightful, bustling, market town near where the three rivers Wye, Monnow and Trothy meet on the border with England. On a sunny day it can be packed with tourists strolling up and down the narrow pavements of Monnow Street, Agincourt Square and Church Street. It has an iconic 51.80896-2.719921 fortified bridge which has relieved of motor traffic by the building of a second bridge over the Monnow after the cattle market closed. Little is left of the Norman castle around which the town grew.
Monmouth museum displays artefacts associated with Admiral Lord Nelson and Charles Rolls of Rolls Royce fame.
The whole town has free Wi-Fi, as a result of Monmouthpedia, a project to use QRpedia QR codes "to provide multilingual smart phone access to Wikipedia articles covering notable subjects in Monmouth, such as places, people, artefacts, flora and fauna" according to Wikipedia. This 2012 project led to Monmouth being described as the "world's first Wikipedia town".
