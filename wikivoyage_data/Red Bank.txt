No Ordinary Joe's cafe. Its menu is smaller than Starbucks, but is an independent place. This is a good place for those sick of the taste of or disillusioned with Starbucks. Also serving good java is Zebu, on Broad Street. There is a Dunkin Donuts on Water Street by the river.
Bars and nightlife[edit]
The Globe, 20 E. Front St, at the corner of Globe St. and West Front St., is an old, very popular bar. Drink prices are average.
The Fix, 26 W. Front St,  was known as Chubby's up until 2009. It's more greasy than swanky, but still a cool place to go. A great place to meet young people.
Ashes, 33 Broad St., a cigar bar/restaurant on the lower level and a dance club on top. Look for the lower level to be populated with successful, middle-aged men while the upper level may have more young people. Not a place to go if you don't want to spend a lot of money.
The Downtown, at 8 W Front St., is a popular spot. It is swanky by nature of its nonchalant brick walls and black painting, and is small and noisy. If you enjoy a happening scene, go here. Drinks can be expensive.
The Dublin House, on 30 Monmouth St., is a popular place, especially in the summer. It has a large outdoor table area, which usually fills up quick on most summer weekends. Drinks here a reasonable, and expect the place to be crowded and full of good looking locals.

Stay safe[edit]
Red Bank is generally considered a safe town. Known for having an active police force accessible by dialing 911. Certain residential areas may seem unsafe, and locals will warn you of parts to avoid but most attractions are in the downtown area, well light and clean, there is no need to go to residential neighborhoods unless visiting people there.  Even if you do wonder into questionable residential areas, nothing bad is likely to happen to you. Use caution as you would in any major city: stay in groups, stay in well lit areas, do not flash expensive accessories or cash, and ask for help from local business owners if you get lost or feel unsafe, they are mostly friendly and willing to help.
Downtown area has Riverview Hospital, a major medical center that serves much of northern Monmouth County. The Red Bank Police Station is across from the Count Basie Theatre.
