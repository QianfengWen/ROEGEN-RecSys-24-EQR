49.54948.685562 Castle Wachenburg.

Do[edit]
Hiking to the two Castles and Buchkligen. Odenwald forest is a nice place to go hiking. Follow the white square - signs that are painted on lampposts and trees from the Windeck castle and you will get to the Wachenburg castle. If you are still not tired after this 300m ascent on mount "Wachenberg" you can follow the white square to Buchklingen, a small village in Odenwald forests. Here you will find a pub "Grüner Baum" to chill your thirst with a Beer or Apple Wine (local specialty!). Of course you can also have a big Schnitzel. (This pub is closed from Monday to Wednesday, unless there is a holiday.)
The Kerwe festival taking place from Friday to Monday on the 2nd weekend in August is the annual celebration of the anniversary of the consecration of the church, but really just a party during which the Marktplatz and the surrounding Altstadt (old part of the city) is crowded, and thousands of lanterns are lit in the Schlosspark on Saturday.
Lake Waidsee The place to stay cool on hot summer days, also offers you a nice lawn to relax in the sun. Entrance fee: €4.00 for the whole day.
 Miramar. Swimming pool - adventure pool with a sauna. Not cheap but big. Entrance fee €20.90 for 4 hours. (updated May 2022)
Wine tasting - there is no vineyard in Weinheim, only (expensive) wine shops, but there are many farmers making wine along Bergstaße (Highway B3), for instance in towns like Lützelsachsen, Großsachsen, Leuterhausen. Get off the RNV 5/5R tram at some stop on the way between Weinheim and Heidelberg. The best time for Wine is Fall during the grapes harvest, because then you can taste their "New Wine" - wine that is still in the process of fermentation and tastes really good. Don't forget to buy Strawberries, Cherries, Apples... (seasonal) and the Apple Wine.
Buy[edit]
A few shops are on Bahnhofstraße, but you will find more if you follow this into the center of town and walk along the Hauptstraße (main street). In Weinheim you will mostly find rather luxury shops (jewellery, expensive shoe shops, tourist kitsch...).
To buy clothes and electronic devices, most Weinheim residents go to "Rhein-Neckar-Zentrum" shopping mall in Viernheim, accessible with the RNV 5 tram from Weinheim on the way to Mannheim.
Woinemer 'Plob' Beer. It's only available in Weinheim's pubs and supermarkets and filled in special swing-top bottles making a characteristic 'plob' sound when you open it.
Eat[edit]

Mr Pommy on Bahnhofstraße does Döner and half-chicken and chips meals.
