Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
The nearest railway station is in Suonenjoki about 20 km east of Rautalampi. There is a bus connection from there.

By plane[edit]
The nearest airports are Rissala in Kuopio, 70 km north-east of Rautalampi and Tikkakoski (near Jyväskylä) 90 km south-west of Rautalampi.

By car[edit]
National road 9 between Jyväskylä and Kuopio passes near the town.

By boat[edit]
The Rautalampi waterway (draught 2.4 m, height 5.5 m) from Pielavesi to Laukaa, connected to Päijänne, passes through the municipality, at Kiesimä, Kerkonkoski and Vaajasalmi. Konnekoski is reachable from it by an official boating route (1.8 m).
The parish village is surrounded by lakes of the Rautalampi route, but the navigable waterway bypasses it by the Kiesimä Canal by the village Kiesimä, also part of the municipality. The parish village is still reachable by canoe from Konnekoski and Vaajasalmi. 
The Rautalampi route is suggested as a national water route because of its beauty and the combination of wilderness-like landscapes with old parish villages and cultural landscapes. Because of this (and the popularity of boating overall), there are significant services for boaters and canoeists along the route, including on side trips.
Konnekoski lies on southern Konnevesi, 7 km from the parish village by road or by canoe, over 62.626.7666671 Hankavesi. Most islands in southern Konnevesi (south of the bridges of road 69) belong to Southern Konnevesi National Park (see Do below).
Kerkonkoski and Vaajasalmi lie on  Niinivesi, 18 and 11 km from the parish village by road

Get around[edit]
Public transportation is only available on the main roads. To get around and see something else than the main village, a car or bike is strongly recommended.

The park covers most of southern Konnevesi, which is shared with Rautalampi's neighbour to the west, Konnevesi. Part of the park is on the large islands between Hankavesi and Konnevesi, reachable by car via Konnekoski.   
The park features open waters and labyrinths of rugged islands and offers possibilities for canoeing and boating as well as hiking. The trails are often steep and rugged, but a not-so-smooth 300-m trail is accessible by assisted wheelchair in season (ask for the lock code to access the parking) and there is an accessible jetty on Lapinsalo far out in Konnevesi.
Suggested canoeing routes range from 3 to 20 km, hiking trails likewise. 
The information boards at the parking lots are in Finnish and English.
Camping is allowed according to the Right to access in the Nordic countries, but camping by infrastructure, such as cooking shelters, is recommended. Some of the shelters are suitable for overnight stay. Bring your own toilet paper. Water from lakes and rivers should be boiled before consumption.
There is firewood at the rest spots of the park. At most of them it needs to be chopped (saw and axe provided). There are also rest spots on adjacent protected private or municipal land, where you mostly should bring your own. Carry out your waste (small amounts of clean paper can be burnt, food scraps can be put in the composing toilets).
