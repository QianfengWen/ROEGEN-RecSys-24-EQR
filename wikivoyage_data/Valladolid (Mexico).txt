Valladolid is a small city of 56,000 people (2020) in the state of Yucatán that is about a 45-minute drive from the (lesser-used) east entrance of Chichén Itzá. It offers an alternative base for visiting the ruins, while having its own charms as well – although further from the ruins than the town of Piste, Valladolid is less tourist-oriented (although this is changing fast) and has more historic charm. It is one of the Pueblos Mágicos de México (Magical Towns of Mexico).


Understand[edit]
Valladolid is named after Valladolid, Spain, which at the time of its founding was the capital of Spain. The name derives from the Arabic name Balad al-Walid, which means "city of al-Walid", referring to Al-Walid I, the sixth Umayyad caliph.
Valladolid in Yucatán was established by Spanish Conquistador Francisco de Montejo's nephew on May 27, 1543, at some distance from the current town, at a lagoon called Chouac-Ha in the municipality of Tizimín. Early Spanish settlers complained about the mosquitos and humidity at the original location, and petitioned to have the city moved further inland. On March 24, 1545, Valladolid was relocated to its current location, built atop a Maya town called Zací or Zací-Val, whose buildings were dismantled to reuse the stones to build the Spanish colonial town.

Catedral de San Gervasio
The following year the Maya people revolted, but the rebellion was suppressed with the support of additional Spanish troops from Mérida. In 1705 there was another revolt by local Maya; the rebels killed a number of town officials who had taken refuge in the cathedral. When the revolt was suppressed, the cathedral was considered irreparably profaned, and was demolished. A new cathedral was built the following year that still exists; it was oriented to face north unlike most other Colonial churches in Yucatán which face east.
In 1847, the native Mayas rioted, killing some eighty whites and sacking their houses. After a Maya noble was shot by firing squad, the riot became a general uprising. The city and the surrounding region was the scene of intense battle during Yucatán's Caste War (1847–1915). The city was sacked by the Maya rebels but was recaptured later in the war.
Valladolid is a popular city in which to explore the history and culture of the Yucatán Peninsula. The town has seen a surge in tourism in the 21st century and now hosts numerous chic, tourist-oriented hotels and restaurants. The arrival of the Tren Maya railway in 2023 has set Valladolid firmly on the tourist circuit.

Climate[edit]
Valladolid has a tropical wet and dry climate. Valladolid's climate is hot and humidity is moderate to high, depending on the time of year. The average annual high temperature is 33 °C (91 °F), ranging from 28 °C (82 °F) in January to 36 °C (97 °F) in May, but temperatures often rise above 38 °C (100 °F) in the afternoon in this time. Low temperatures range between 18 °C (64 °F) in January to 23 °C (73 °F) in May and June. It is most often a few degrees hotter in Valladolid than coastal areas due to its inland location and low elevation. The rainy season runs from June through October, associated with the Mexican monsoon which draws warm, moist air landward. Easterly waves and tropical storms also affect the area during this season.

Valladolid is just off the toll highway (180D) between Cancún and Mérida; the exit is about 5 km (3 miles) north of the center of town. The old highway (180) runs east-west through the centre of town, and highway 295 connects south towards Chetumal, and north to the toll highway and Ek Balam. Both highways run right through the centre of town on one-way streets, forming the four sides of the central town square.
