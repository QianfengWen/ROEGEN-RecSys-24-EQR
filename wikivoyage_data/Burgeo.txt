History[edit]
Indigenous peoples such as Dorset Inuit and Beothuk First Nations peoples frequented the many bays of the local archipelago and adjacent mainland. The Micmac First Nations were fishing and hunting in this part of the island for several hundred years from their settlements in what is now Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.
It is believed by some that the area was discovered by the Portuguese and given the name Virgio; this became Burgeo, possibly a British pronunciation or adaptation. In 1756, Captain James Cook, who was surveying and exploring the local islands, experienced a solar eclipse. In recognition of this astonishing event he named one of the isles "Eclipse Island". In the 1790s first influx of permanent European settlers arrived to make a living fishing the inshore waters mainly for cod. 

The harbour
The town has been in the fishing industry for most of its existence. The first fishing merchant to setup an operation here in the early 1800s. In the 1940s a modern fish processing facility was built in the Short Reach and Burgeo heralded in a new period of growth that continued unabated for the next five decades. During the 1950s, Spencer Lake started a large fishing enterprise located at 
In 1962 Canadian nature writer and naturalist Farley Mowat and his wife Claire took up residence here for nearly five or six years. Their books A Whale For The Killing, The Boat Who Wouldn't Float, and Outport People had Burgeo and local residents as their backdrop. 
Burgeo and its neighbours relied and depended upon a daily coastal boat and ferry service. These boats traversed the south coast from Port Aux Basques to Fortune disembarking at every inhabited port. This was for the most part a life line to the outside world for these isolated communities. In 1979 the town became connected to the rest of the province by a 146-km road commonly known as the Caribou Trail.
