A panoramic view
Alcamo is a town in the Trapani province of western Sicily.
The climate is mild and its central position on the Gulf of Castellammare offers views of Mount Bonifato and the vineyard-covered rolling hills of the surrounding countryside. If you are at Alcamo Marina it is still possible to behold sand dunes.
The combination of town, mountain, country, beach and sea makes for a vacation full of contrasts.


Understand[edit]
When to go[edit]
Alcamo is practically full of opportunities all the year round: in winter you can take advantage of Christmas events to visit the monuments in the town centre and the places of its "movida" (pubs, bars and pizzerias in particular), while in summer it is possible to walk along the promenade full of very good pizzerias too.
It is also a good idea to visit the town in June so you can take part in the celebrations in honour of Madonna of Miracles (Most Holy Mary of Miracles) or in spring if you wish to take advantage of the mild climate and visit the Nature Reserve and the ancient ruins on Mount Bonifato.

History[edit]
Porta Palermo
Though people think that Alcamo were founded by Arabs during the Middle Ages, the excavations in the surrounding territory confirm that there were already settlements near the present town in prehistoric times. Before the arrival of Arabs there were two villages: the first one, Longuro, was on Mount Bonifato, while the second, called Longarico, was near the present built-up areas.
When the Arabs arrived at the village, they saw it was semi-desert and so they founded Alcamo. Afterwards the town passed under the dominion of Normans and Swabians. In time the old mosques were substituted by Catholic churches and only the ancient Arab fountain, still running, and the name of the town, whose meaning is uncertain, remained.
The built-up areas became a well fortified feud thanks to the construction of the Castle of the Counts of Modica and the walls surrounding the present town centre.
In the following centuries Alcamo progressively developed from the cultural point of view, both for literature (whose most important representative is the poet Cielo d’Alcamo) and the artistic production; in fact there are very important sculptures and paintings inside its churches, especially in the Cathedral (Chiesa Madre) where an art museum has been opened in order to collect some of these masterpieces.

Districts[edit]
Owing to its particular geographical position (with Mount Bonifato in the south and the Gulf of Castellammare in the north) a lot of streets have an inclination from the mountain, in the south, towards the sea, in the north. Mount Bonifato and the coastline are also two excellent points of reference because they can be seen from any place in town.

The façade of the church of the Jesuits' College
Corso 6 Aprile is very important: it is known by its citizens as “il Corso”(or lu Cassaru in dialect). This main street starts from the Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie and finishes at Porta Palermo; on the way you will also pass the Church of Saints Paul and Bartholomew baroque church with its rich interior and Piazza Ciullo, which is full of young people at night.
In Piazza Ciullo (called “the Square” or “la Chiazza” in dialect), you can see the Town Hall, the Church of the Jesuits' College (Chiesa del Collegio) which is in the middle of the square and has a big round clock, Saint Olivia’s Church, restaurants and sandwich bars. Going towards Chiesa del Collegio and turning on the left, you will arrive at Piazza della Repubblica, where you can admire the Castle of Counts of Modica and find also a large car park.

Basilica of Santa Maria Assunta
At Piazza Ciullo the main street (Corso) has a sudden narrowing: starting from this point it is called the “Narrow Corso” (“Cassaru Strittu" in dialect). The Cathedral (Chiesa Madre) is here; if you go straight on, you will reach the Church of Saint Francis of Assisi and finally the end of the Main Street coinciding with Porta Palermo which opens onto Piazza Bagolino, called the "Bastione" (or "lu Bastiuni"in dialect) owing to its high walls of defence surrounding the square. This is delimited by a sidewalk from where you can admire, above all at sunset, a very striking view, together with the coastline of Alcamo Marina. Going down Piazza Bagolino, after two turnings, you will get to a large square where you can admire the ancient Arab fountain. On its right there is a paved pathway leading to the  Sanctuary of the Most Holy Mary of Miracles, which can be reached on foot through this paved road, or by car through a narrow street nearby.
Starting from Piazza Pittore Renda, with Corso 6 Aprile behind, you can go round a roundabout (with the small Church of Our Lady of Graces in its middle) and arrive at Viale Italia which ends with another roundabout (known as "La Rotonda" par excellence). If you turn left you will get to Viale Europa where there are several interesting bars in which it is possible to taste some typical local recipes. By taking one of the right streets (Via Monte Bonifato in particular) you will arrive at the Nature Reserve on Mount Bonifato, while if you go ahead you will get to a crossroads, and by turning left you will first meet the Church of Saint Mary of Jesus (Chiesa di Santa Maria di Gesù) and then a small roundabout with a statue of Saint Francis in the middle.
From this roundabout you can go to Piazza Bagolino (by turning right and through Via Florio) or to Piazza della Repubblica, turning on the left.
