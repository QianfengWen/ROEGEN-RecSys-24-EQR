Glen Cove is a multicultural city with a population of 26,936 as of 2009. It is a small city that provides a variety of amenities. The Matinecock Indians – a Native American tribe – founded it. Glen Cove was originally named "Moscheto." English migrants from New England used Glen Cove as a port before 1668.
A man named Joseph Carpenter, from Warwick, Rhode Island purchased about 2,000 acres of the land northwest of the Town of Oyster Bay on May 24, 1668. Later that year Mr. Carpenter admitted four co-partners into the project - three brothers, Nathaniel, Daniel, and Robert Coles, and Nicholas Simkins. These men were all residents of Oyster Bay. The five men named the settlement later spelled "Musketa Cove", which In the Matinecock language means "place of rushes."
