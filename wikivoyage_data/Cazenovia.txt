History[edit]
The Town of Cazenovia was established in 1793 by the Towns of Whitestown and Paris (both in Oneida County) before the creation of Madison County. Subsequently, other towns in the county were formed from partitions of its territory. Cazenovia was part of a region called "The Gore," based on a surveying error.
It was founded by John Lincklaen, an agent of the Holland Land Company, and was named after Theophilus Cazenove, Lincklaen's boss.
