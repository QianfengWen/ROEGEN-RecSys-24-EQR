Cupola in Mision de Santiago Apostol
Jalpan (also known as Jalpan de Serra) is a small town in the Sierra Gorda region of Queretaro (state). Most of northern Queretaro is part of the Sierra Gorda, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve[1]. The town was originally settled by the Spanish in the late 16th century, but much of the historic downtown dates from the 18th and 19th centuries, including the picturesque Mision Santiago Apostol, built by Father Junipero Serra in 1751, and the Mision Nuestra Señora de la Luz de Tancoyol (each church is part of a UNESCO World Heritage site for the missions of the Sierra Gorda).

See[edit]
Mision Santiago Apostol - the first church to be constructed in Jalpan was the mission established by Junipero Serra in 1751, with construction completed in 1758. Common among the Franciscan missions was the incorporation of indigenous icons and decorative styles, such as the double-headed eagle with a snake. The facade is very elaborate with symbols of the Franciscan order and an image of St. Francis of Assisi. The facade is built of stone and stucco. The interior of the cupola includes scenes of the Virgin of Guadalupe appearing to Juan Diego.
Nuestra Señora de la Luz de Tancoyol - this mission is not really in Jalpan, but by itself in the community of Tancoyol, almost an hour out of town (so take a taxi there and have the driver wait for you while you check out the church). It's one of the five missions that make up the UNESCO World Heritage site, but you kind of wonder why the heck those friars built it so inconveniently far out of town. The mission was established by Friar Juan Ramos de Lora between 1760 and 1767. Besides the signature architectural elements of the Franciscan order, the church icons include images of St. Peter, St. Paul, Saint Joachim, and St. Anne, among others. The indigenous icons and themes represented in this church include images of a jaguar and a man with Olmec features.
Museum of the Sierra Gorda - Housed in a 16th century Spanish fort, the museum includes exhibits about the history of the region, pre-colombian artifacts from the indigenous peoples of the region, a hall about the missions and their goal of converting indigenous people to the Christian faith with a definite emphasis on Father Junipero Serra, the missions of Sierra Gorda, and the role of the church in taming northern Mexico and the southwest United States as Franciscan missions expanded ever northward, up into Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California.
Ruins at Tancama
Tancama - small archaeological site of the Huastec culture. 62 buildings have been identified at the site in three different clusters. Unusual round altar areas and construction of flagstone. The site is about 15 minutes by taxi from the center of Jalpan.
Do[edit]
Jalpan celebrates a number of religious festivals throughout the year, and few secular holidays as well. Major festivals in town includeː

Feast of the Holy Child of the Mezclita - January 5 and 6, celebrates the story of an infant child found in Guanajuato in 1890 who was turned over to the church. The bishop took the child to Jalpan just in time for the Feast of the Epiphany. Several miracles have been attributed to the child and now up to 20,000 people fill the town of Jalpan each year to celebrate.
Serrana Regional Fair - April 21 (plus or minus a week), commemorates the founding of Jalpan as a Franciscan mission. Artistic and cultural events together with a sport fishing tournament. Busiest festival week in the Sierra Gorda region.
Day of Santiago the Apostle - July 25, celebrates the town's patron saint and the one to whom the Mission of Jalpan is dedicated. Parades, fireworks, first communions, confirmations, maybe even a wedding or two, round out the festivities.
Day of the Dead - November 1 and 2, Jalpan celebrates the mystery of death by visiting the graves of loved ones and decorating their graves. On the night of November 2, a contest is held in the town square as locals vie for the prestige of creating the most meaningful and beautiful altar of the dead.
El Dia del Paisano - December 20 (minus a week or plus a day or two), celebrates the return to home of native sons who have migrated to the United States for work but come home for the holidays to be with family and friends. A parade of decorated pickup trucks and lots of huapango dancing mark the day.
