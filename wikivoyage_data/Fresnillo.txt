Fresnillo is a mid-size city in the Mexican state of Zacatecas. The city boasts a colonial downtown core, several cultural traditions with lively local festivals, one of the largest silver mines in the world, and is an important transportation hub for central Zacatecas.


Understand[edit]
The town's modern history begins in 1551 when Spanish explorer Diego Fernández de Proaño scouted areas in Zacatecas in search of mineral wealth. In the area that would become Fresnillo he discovered a large hill with signs of silver and other valuable ores. He named the hill Cerro de Proaño. Although the viceroy was unexcited about reports of mineral finds in Fresnillo, Diego Fernández de Proaño believed the hill would hold immense reserves and he established the mine there. The community grew with the up-and-down success of the mine, which endured setbacks such as native Indian attacks in its early years, financial troubles in the colonial era, and political indifference by the Spanish crown as to its fate.
In the modern era, Fresnillo has been severely affected by violence surrounding drug cartel activity in the state.

Taxi is the best way to get around in Fresnillo, but for safety reasons, call a taxi to your home or hotel and have someone take note of its plates and ID number. A growing number of mototaxis are seen in Fresnillo, though rather than custom built vehicles, they are often trailers attached to a regular motorcycle.
