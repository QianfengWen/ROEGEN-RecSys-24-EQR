The Old Church on the Torenplein
Barneveld is a town in Gelderland, located in a region of woods and heath, southeast of Amersfoort.


Understand[edit]
Barneveld has become famous in the Netherlands for poultry farming and egg production and has a breed of chicken, the Barnevelder, named after it. The town has existed since 1333, and functions mostly as a market-town servicing the Gelderse Vallei. Though the town is rather big, it has never gained city rights.
A notable story from Barneveld is the story of Jan van Schaffelaar, cavalry commander in the Hook and Cod wars. He allegedly leaped off the city's tower on July 16th, 1482, to meet his death at the foot of the tower. A statue of him has been placed on the Torenplein. Schaffelaar Castle, the Schaffelaar Theatre and the Schaffelaarse Bos have been named after him.

Get in[edit]
Barneveld Noord train station
By train[edit]
Barneveld has three train stations (52.161815.598021 Barneveld Noord , 52.140525.589892 Barneveld Centrum  and 52.12995.60093 Barneveld Zuid ) which can be reached by train in two directions: from Amersfoort Central Station and from Ede-Wageningen. Intercity trains do not stop at Barneveld. The main station is about 5 minutes walk from the village center.

By car[edit]
Barneveld is located along the A30, which connects the A12 between Ede and Veenendaal with the A1/E30 between Amersfoort and Apeldoorn. Exits 4 (Scherpenzeel) and 5 (Barneveld-Noord) service Barneveld. Parking your car is easy within the town.

By bus[edit]
Busses also run from Amersfoort Central Station. However, since you are already at the train station, a train would be much more effective.

Get around[edit]
All points of interest found in and around Barneveld can, from the main train station, be reached by foot. To speed up travelling times, however, travelling by bicycle is recommended. Additionally, you can travel by car.
