Understand[edit]
B-Say-Tah Point on Echo Lake, near Fort Qu'Appelle.
Fort Qu'Appelle was established as a Hudson's Bay Company trading post in 1852, and developed into a service centre for area settlers. Fort Qu'Appelle had a bid to succeed Battleford as the territorial capital, but lost out to Regina in 1882. It lies between Echo Lake and Mission Lakes, and should not be confused with the once-significant nearby town of Qu'Appelle, which is 28 km to the south along the Trans-Canada Highway.
Fort Qu'Appelle maintains cross country ski trails and a snowmobile trail system. Opportunities for ice fishing are also available.

History[edit]
The current site is the third Fort Qu'Appelle. The first was a North West Company trading post (1801–05), also in the valley but near what is now the Saskatchewan-Manitoba border. The Hudson's Bay Company first used the name for a post north of present-day Whitewood (some 174 km east of Regina on Number 1 Highway) from 1813 to 1819.
Prior to the mid-19th-century establishment of a longer lasting fur-trading post here, it was the hub of several historic trails that traversed the northwest. It was the site of a Hudson's Bay Company post from 1852 to 1854. An Anglican mission was established, which survives as the town's St. John the Evangelist Anglican parish church.
The post was revived again from 1864 to 1911. With the signing of Treaty 4 by Cree and Salteaux Aboriginal peoples at Fort Qu'Appelle, the North-West Mounted Police, now the RCMP, arrived.
Farm development began in the 1880s and farmers required a nearby urban centre for selling their grain and other products, purchasing agricultural and domestic supplies and for social gathering beyond rural schools and churches.
The name "Qu'Appelle" comes from "is French for 'who calls' and is derived from its Cree name, kah-tep-was ('river that calls'). There are several versions of the origin of this name, but the most popular suggests it refers to a Cree legend of two ill-fated lovers." The name refers to the once-popular legend of the Qu'Appelle Valley versified by Pauline Johnson and known nation-wide. "Fort Qu'Appelle was the crossroads of a number of historic trails that traversed the North-West Territories."
