Shopping in Chester city centre
Chester (Welsh: Caer) is a very pretty and historic English city on the river Dee, and the county town (capital) of the North-Western county of Cheshire. Although maybe not worth a whole holiday, it's well worth a day or overnight trip to see the Roman ruins and medieval city centre. This fine city is also the gateway to North Wales, as it stands directly on the Anglo-Welsh border.


Understand[edit]
Chester originated in the Romano-British period at the latest, when it formed the settlement known as Deva or Castra Devana, the fortress city of the 20th Legion (Legio XX Valeria Victrix). As a result, some parts of Chester are around two thousand years old. It was a Royalist stronghold during the English Civil War in the 1640s, and along the walls, one can see the tower from which King Charles I watched his troops do battle.
A native of Chester is called a 'Cestrian'. Just as Cockneys must be born within earshot of the Bow Bells to be classed a 'true' Cockney, local tradition dictates that to be strictly deemed a 'Cestrian' the person must have been born within the boundaries of the city's Roman walls.
However, the last maternity ward within those defined limits was relocated to its current site a couple of miles outside the city walls in the early 1970s.

53.193949-2.8885123 Chester Bus Interchange. Opened in 2022, has been carefully designed to give no protection from the weather, as the horseshoe of stands is open on both sides so the wind and rain sweep through. The information boards only show departures in the next ten minutes so you don't know when your late-running bus will start or if it's cancelled, and good luck finding any staff assistance. Maybe they're sheltering in the pubs just south across the canal bridge, raising a toast to the architectural consultants.   (updated Oct 2023)

Get around[edit]
The city centre is relatively small with everything within walking distance. For areas a little further away, there are good bus services from the bus station on Gorse Stacks on the north side of the city to nearby villages like Blacon and Saltney, as well as more distant towns such as Mold, Wrexham and Liverpool.
Or one can take a taxi.

It has Norman masonry dating back to around 1075 AD and an Elizabethan-era ceiling which saved it from destruction after the Reformation.

Roman Chester[edit]
Chester (or Deva in Latin) was one of the great military bases in Roman England, and as such, has its fair share of Roman ruins. Historians have even speculated that had the Roman departure not happened, Chester would have become the Roman Capital of England.

 Walls. The city centre is enclosed by the walls, which offer a pleasant strolling route for visitors and locals alike. Walk around the top of the Roman walls that surround the city. 
53.189167-2.8869445 Amphitheatre, Vicars Lane, Chester (Adjacent to the Grosvenor Park). Believed to have been the site of the largest wooden structure amphitheatre in the Roman Empire outside of Rome for its time, with a larger stone amphitheatre later built on-top of the foundations

Do[edit]
53.18849-2.883241 The Groves, riverside (Behind Grosvenor Park). The Groves is Chester's own riverside promenade running alongside the River Dee from the Grosvenor Park to the Old Handbridge (which gave its name to one of the suburbs on the other bank). 
The Groves is one of Chester’s premier open spaces, running along the city bank of the River Dee. It became a promenade in the early 1700s and is now part of a longer Riverside Promenade.
In 1726, the area was leased to Charles Croughton who secured the river bank and planted an avenue of trees. By the late 18th century it had become known as The Groves. The City Walls also became a fashionable place and during the 18th century, the circuit was modified and the Groves and the walls were connected through the construction of Recorder’s Steps. In Roman times, this section of the riverside was a series of quarries where stone was extracted for building the fortress. In Saxon times, The Groves was probably the main port area and may have had a concentration of leatherworking.
The Groves is also the best place to go to take a trip down the river itself through all manner of vessels from motorised tour-boats to row boats and, in warm weather, even pedaloes.
53.1905-2.881492 Grosvenor Park (via Grosvenor Park Road). Grosvenor Park is a classical, 19th-century designed park with a typical Victorian layout that includes formal avenues lined with trees, large sweeping lawns surrounded with ornamental shrub beds and bedding plants, which provide a colourful display throughout the spring and summer months. The park is located near the River Dee and with views across the river to the meadows and Queen’s Park and out towards the south of Chester.   
Grosvenor Park was one of the first public parks in Britain outside of the big industrial cities and was given to the city of Chester in 1867 by Richard Grosvenor, the Second Marquess of Westminster.
The River Dee, which runs through Chester
 Boating. Along the river. Rowing boats can be hired, or if you don't want to exert yourself, there are many boat trips that go from the river bank on the city centre side between the Handbridge Suspension bridge and the walls, and they show you everything you will want to see! 
53.1864-2.899723 Chester Racecourse, ☏ +44 1244 304600, enquiries@chester-races.com. It's on the Roodee, and used to be the site of the Roman port. If you're really keen on horseracing, find out the dates of the 'races days' Chester hosts a few times a year. You may have to book/ will have to book tickets in advance, check with Chester racecourse, and there is quite a range of prices. Chester is a racecourse that holds flat races only, it is a very tight left-hand course. If you just want to see a bit of the race atmosphere for free, the walls walk you right past a view of the action down below. City centre bars are best avoided before and after the races, unless you wish to be very sociable because they are usually full and difficult to get a drink.

It's best to leave 3-5 hours to do it properly. It's a little way out of the city centre, so either catch a bus from the bus station, or take the train from Chester Station to Bache on the Wirral Line. The latter option is extremely quick (under five minutes) and correspondingly cheap. £10-12.

Buy[edit]
Chester has fantastic shopping for its size. All the major stores are based in one of the most attractive city centres in the country. Traditional black and white Tudor buildings and The Rows (an historic two-tiered shopping gallery, the only one of its kind in the world!) coupled with good shops and great places to eat, such as The Watergates Wine Bar, are sure to make this a pleasant shopping trip.

Chester's attractive shops draw shoppers from far and wide

Stay safe[edit]
Chester is not an especially dangerous city, with no particular reputation for crime. The general rule is the nearer the racecourse (thus more expensive), the safer the area. However, the usual UK rules apply. Be aware that, between midnight and 3AM or so, especially on Friday and Saturday nights, there will be plenty of drunken people about, so stick to well-lit areas and main roads. If you are one of these people and don't know the city well, consider taking a cab home. Some parts of the city, especially Blacon and The Lache should be strongly avoided if you don't know the area, as they are considered unsafe.

Connect[edit]
As of Oct 2022, Chester and its approach roads have 5G from EE and Three, and 4G from O2 and Vodafone.
