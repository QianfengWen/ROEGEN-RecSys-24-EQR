Lorain is a city of 64,000 people (2019) 30 miles west of Cleveland in Northeast Ohio.  A former industrial center for shipbuilding, auto manufacturing, and steel, like other Rust Belt cities, the city faces population decline and urban decay. 


Understand[edit]
The city sits on the shore of Lake Erie, at the mouth of the Black River. The city is Ohio's tenth largest city, the third largest in Greater Cleveland, and the largest in Lorain County by population.

History[edit]
The city began as an unincorporated village, Charleston, in 1834. It was incorporated as a village under the name Lorain in 1874 and became a city in 1896. 
The 1924 Lorain–Sandusky tornado hit the city on June 28, 1924. The tornado formed over the Sandusky Bay during the late afternoon hours and hit Sandusky, where it killed eight people and destroyed 100 homes and 25 businesses. After moving east over Lake Erie for several miles, the tornado then struck Lorain, killing 72. Among the dead were 15 people inside a collapsed theater, which makes it the worst tornado-related death toll from a single building in Ohio. Eight people were also killed inside the Bath House near the location where the tornado came onshore.
The city's economy has focused on heavy industry. Major industrial operations included the American Shipbuilding Lorain Yard on the City's east side, the Ford Motor Company Lorain Assembly Plant on the City's west side, and the steel production sector on the City's south side, NW consisting of the United States Steel and Republic Steel companies.
The American Shipbuilding Lorain Yard closed in 1983,urging more than 1,500 people out of work. The Ford Lorain Assembly Plant ceased production operations in 2005. In March 2020, US Steel idled its Lorain mill indefinitely, laying off 250 workers. At its peak in 1982, it had employed 8,600 people.
