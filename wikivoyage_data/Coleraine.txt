Coleraine is a town in the historic County Londonderry in Northern Ireland. Standing 55 miles northwest of Belfast, Coleraine is a transport hub and home to Ulster University. It has limited sights of its own but is within a few miles of major attractions along the Antrim coast.


Understand[edit]

Coleraine in Irish is Cúil Rathain, "nook of the ferns." It grew up at a point where the river could be bridged but was navigable by small boats. It became a Plantation settlement from the 17th century, but remained a small provincial market town until the railways and industry arrived in the 19th century. Coleraine was, and is, predominantly Protestant: of the 13 people killed here during the Troubles, six elderly Protestants were killed by an IRA car bomb, four UVF terrorists were killed by an own goal when their bomb went off prematurely, and three were shot by loyalists.
In spite of that background, Coleraine was re-vitalised from 1970 when it became the main campus of the new Ulster University. This was seen by some as a Protestant poke in the eye for the academic claims of Derry, but that was a cramped city site, and the university had far more scope on the greenfield site north edge of town. This boosted the population to 24,634 by 2011, and it also made Coleraine one of the most affluent towns in Northern Ireland, with spiralling property prices. 
The historic counties are no longer used for administrative purposes in Northern Ireland: Coleraine is part of the Causeway Coast and Glens District.

See[edit]
Town centre grew up at the lowest bridge on the River Bann, 100 yards wide at this point. The central square is called The Diamond, with town hall and the TIC. St Patrick's Church (C of I) is a little way north; parts date from 1613.
Art galleries: there isn't a civic museum-gallery but commercial galleries include Reflections on Dunmore St, Ecology Art on Queen St, and Just Fine on New Row.
55.116-6.6641 Mount Sandel Mesolithic Site, Mountfield Drive BT52 1TW. 24 hours. The mound is an Iron Age fort, circa 500 BC. Given its location, the Normans may also have palisaded and garrisoned it by knee-jerk reflex, but they never built a stone castle. But excavations around it in the 1970s revealed dwellings from 7000 BC, the Mesolithic or Middle Stone Age. These were ten tepees, with saplings bent into a framework then covered in hides, and with a central hearth. Although there's evidence of earlier human activity in Ireland, this is the earliest fixed "village"; it had been thought that Mesolithic people here were nomadic hunter-gatherers and that settled dwellings and agriculture only began with the Neolithic or New Stone Age.
