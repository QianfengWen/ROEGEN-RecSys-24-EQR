Otepää is one of the oldest settlements in Estonia, first mentioned in the Russian chronicles in 1116. Its name was derived from the shape of the Town Hill (Linnamägi), resampling a bear head, meaning Oti pää in Estonian. It's also where in 1224, Bishop Hermann started building the first known brick castle in Estonia, The Stone Fort.
Otepää is the best known winter sports centre in the Baltics and the Winter Capital of Estonia.
