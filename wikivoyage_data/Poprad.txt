Poprad has a mild climate and its weather is influenced by the High and Low Tatras. Winter is usually long and cold with snow. Summer is short and warm. 

History[edit]
The territory belonged to the Kingdom of Hungary since the 10th century and was probably inhabited by Slavic settlers. It was colonized in the 13th century by German settlers and became the largely German town Deutschendorf meaning 'Germans' village'. From 1412 to 1770, as one of the Szepes towns, Poprad was pawned by the Kingdom of Hungary to the Kingdom of Poland, resulting in a strong Polish influence on the city's further development.
The first written reference to Poprad dates from 1256. It was for 690 years (until 1946) just one of several neighbouring settlements, which make up the modern city. The other parts of the municipality are Matejovce (first reference 1251), Spišská Sobota (1256), Veľká (1268), and Stráže pod Tatrami (1276). The most significant of these original towns was Georgenberg (or Szepesszombat, now: Spišská Sobota), which preserved its dominant position in the area until the late 19th century.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
49.0736120.241111 Airport Poprad-Tatry (TAT  IATA). The highest-placed airport in Europe, 718 m above sea-level. With the exception of Wizz Air from Luton, mostly seasonal service. The nearest international airport is in Košice, approximately 100 min by road.   (updated Feb 2019)
By train[edit]
Map of railway network in High Tatras
Direct trains serve Poprad from Prague, Žilina, Košice and Bratislava. Trains can be caught from Bratislava main train station (Bratislava Hlavna Stanica) approximately every 1 to 1½ hr. The approximate fare for this 5-hour trip is €12. Local electric trains (tram like) reach to the nearby mountain resorts of Vysoké Tatry - Smokovec, Tatranska Lomnica and Stbrske Pleso.
See cp.sk (available in English) for train and bus connections.
A really cheap way of getting to Poprad from Prague is with RegioJet trains. You can choose either the night connection, which arrives in Poprad early morning, or the train during the day. Tickets for normal seats are €10 and in sleeping car €13.5. Onboard it is possible to buy very cheap food and beverages, including beer (under €1) which will be brought to you. RegioJet also has good connections to Bratislava.
The station has luggage lockers, so it is possible to do day trips elsewhere before catching a night train.

By bus[edit]
From some towns in Czech Republic, Poland or Slovakia it can be easier to catch a bus than a train.

Bratislava: regular bus connections by many bus companies.
Košice: regular bus connections by many bus companies.
Banská Bystrica
Žilina: regular bus connections by many bus companies, at least once every hour during the day, it takes around 2 hr, tickets cost around €7.
Zakopane: the bus company Strama goes from Zakopane to Poprad with a few stops in Vysoké Tatry, a ticket costs €5.50 one way [1]. This service is irregular, especially in winter. In front of the station in Zakopane, there is a bus stop with a sign that lists the times the bus leaves for Poprad; it's in Polish, but it's not hard to figure out. If the service is not running, look for the drivers that stop in front of the bus station. Tell the driver you want to go to Poprad. Your best bet is to get enough people who want to go to make it worth the driver's while. Some locals may also be going, so ask if you can join them to form a group. The driver will drop you off at Łysa Polana (Łysa is pronounced Wee-Sa in Polish), the border town between Poland and Slovakia. Wait for another bus to take you to Poprad (not long).
Kraków twice daily with Flixbus.
