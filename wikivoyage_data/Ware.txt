Ware has many listed buildings by Historic England, many timber framed, four grade I, fifteen grade II* and 181 grade II, including the remains of a 14th-century friary, now the local council offices and a conference centre called The Priory and Fletcher's Lea. Restoration work has shown that it dates from the 13th century. Opposite the priory is the large 14th-century parish church of St. Mary. It is known for its elaborate font with large carved stone figures.
