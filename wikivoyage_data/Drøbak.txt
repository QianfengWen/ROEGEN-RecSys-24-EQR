Drøbak is in the Frogn municipality, in the county of Akershus in Norway, at the shores of the Oslofjord, a few miles south-east of Oslo.


Understand[edit]
The cannons of Oscarsborg
Drøbak was in the 19th century used as a winter port for the capital Oslo, because the fjord froze in winter time. The most famous story is Oscarborg Fortresses role during the Norwegian campaign of World War II. On 9 April 1940, the fortress sunk the German cruiser Blücher and thus delayed the Nazi German invasion of Norway.
Today the town is a picturesque little spot, which consists mostly of small, whitepainted wooden houses. Especially in summer, the town is used as a seaside resort for many tourists, who find many scenic attractions here. From the harbor in Drøbak there is a ferry to the former fortress Oscarsborg, which has been converted into a museum and a hotel resort. During the summer season, the fortress can also be reached by a separate liner boat from Oslo/Sentrum. Mandatory for those with an interest in history and beautiful sceneries.
