Perrine Bridge over the Snake River
Twin Falls is the largest city in South Central Idaho and the seventh-largest city in the state. Having been founded in 1905, it is the youngest of Idaho's major cities. Twin Falls has become a regional cultural and economic center for South Central Idaho and northeastern Nevada.


Understand[edit]
Once in the heart of a stretch on the Oregon Trail best known for its inhospitable environment, Twin Falls was founded in 1904 as a planned community after irrigation projects on the Snake River made large-scale agriculture in the area practical for the first time. Twin Falls is the principal city of the Magic Valley region of Idaho, so named because said irrigation projects "magically" transformed the harsh landscape into productive farmland. While agriculture remains one of the city's primary industries, its proximity to outdoor activities as well as to casino gaming in nearby Nevada give it a regional tourist flair. Twin Falls is home to over 40,000 residents, making it one of Idaho's principal cities outside the Boise metro area.

Talk[edit]
Although English is the primary language in Twin Falls, a significant Hispanic community as well as refugees brought in by the local community college give the city an added multicultural element. It is not at all unusual to hear Spanish, Bosnian and Russian - among other languages - spoken in the city. That said, don't expect too much linguistic diversity; as in the rest of Idaho, English is still by far your best bet with Spanish a distant second.

By plane[edit]
42.4818-114.4881 Joslin Field - Magic Valley Regional Airport (TWF  IATA), 492 Airport Loop. It is served by regular flights from Salt Lake City on SkyWest Airlines.   
By car[edit]
Twin Falls can be accessed by car via US Highway 93. Interstate 84 runs approximately 5 miles (8 km) north of the city in Jerome County and intersects US-93. Unless you are coming from Nevada, you will cross the bridge over the Snake River Canyon.
By train[edit]
Due to both geographical and political realities, passenger rail service is utterly non-existent in the area. The closest Amtrak stop is in Elko, Nevada, some 165 mi (266 km) away. In short, driving or flying are the only practical methods to get here.
By bus[edit]
Greyhound Bus provides service between Boise and Twin Falls.  The trip takes about two hours and fifteen minutes.
Salt Lake Express

Rudimentary taxi service is available in the city if needed, but it's no Manhattan. Don't expect to hail a cab even on busy streets. Check Yellow Pages for services.

42.602923-114.4516781 Snake River Canyon. Located immediately north of Twin Falls, the Snake River Canyon is perhaps best known for Evel Knievel's failed 1974 attempt to jump it in a rocket-powered motorcycle. The canyon has become a destination for BASE jumpers, as Perrine Bridge spanning the canyon is the only man-made structure in the United States where BASE jumping is allowed year round without a permit (although bungee jumping is not; you will attract unwanted attention from local authorities if you attempt it). Golf is available on the canyon floor at the public Canyon Springs Golf Course and the private Blue Lakes Country Club.

Eat[edit]
Twin Falls isn't exactly a destination for foodies. Apart from the expected assortment of chain restaurants (i.e. Chili's, Outback, the usual complement of fast-food joints, et al.) the fare is a bit lacking. That said, Twin Falls does feature several Thai restaurants and family-oriented establishments.
Mexican cuisine is your best bet in the city. Try:

Connect[edit]
Cell phone service is consistent and reliable in Twin Falls proper as well as in the surrounding communities. However, if you travel further south than Jackpot, Nevada, on US Highway 93, expect to have an intermittent signal at best until you approach Wells or Ely.
Public WiFi access is available at most larger hotels, as well as at some coffee shops.

Stay safe[edit]
Given that much of the city's commercial and tourist infrastructure is concentrated around the intersection of Blue Lakes Boulevard and Poleline Road, as well as the fact nearby Perrine Bridge is effectively the only way in and out of Twin Falls from the north, traffic in the immediate area can be as heavy as anywhere in a much larger population center such as Boise. Stay alert if driving or walking through here.

Go next[edit]
Twin Falls is approximately halfway between Boise and Pocatello, about a two-hour drive from each. Salt Lake City is approximately three hours away by car, or a 45 minutes by air.
Jackpot - Approximately 45 miles (75 km) south of Twin Falls just over the Nevada border, the small town of Jackpot offers casino gaming and routinely draws crowds from all over the area. Collectively the Jackpot casinos employ more people from Twin Falls than any employer in Twin Falls.
Sun Valley - As in most of Idaho, the first day of ski season in November is eagerly anticipated in the Magic Valley. If the highbrow atmosphere (and corresponding prices) of Sun Valley aren't for you, try the more wallet-friendly Pomerelle resort south of Declo. Both locations are approximately an hour's drive from Twin Falls.
