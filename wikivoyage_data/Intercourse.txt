Intercourse is a small Amish village in Lancaster County in Pennsylvania Dutch Country. Intercourse is a popular site for tourists because of its location in Amish country and its sexually suggestive name. The movie Witness was filmed in Intercourse in the surrounding area. For Richer or Poorer was set there, though not filmed in Intercourse. 


Understand[edit]
Founded in 1754 as Cross Keys, Intercourse (pop. 1,500 in 2020) is one of several small villages with unusual names in the heart of Pennsylvania's Amish country. Other charmingly-named local Pennsylvania Dutch villages include Blue Ball, Gap, Fertility, Mount Joy, Lititz, Bareville, Bird-in-Hand, and Paradise.
As Amish villages are only about 40 mi (64 km) from Wilmington (Delaware) and 60 mi (97 km) from Philadelphia, these tiny communities are flooded with thousands of visitors.

Get in[edit]
From Lancaster (Pennsylvania), travel 10 mi (16 km) east on Pennsylvania Route 340.
