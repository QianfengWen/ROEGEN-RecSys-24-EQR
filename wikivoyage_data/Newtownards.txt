Newtownards is a town at the head of Strangford Lough, historically in County Down. In 2011 had a population of 28,050. It has visitor amenities but few sights of its own, but the area around the lough is dotted with natural and historic attractions. This page therefore covers the entire Ards Peninsula down to Portaferry, and the northern half of the lough. For the southwest shore of the lough see Downpatrick and Strangford. 


Understand[edit]
"New" means from 1226 AD, when the Normans founded the "New Town of Blathewic". The old town was built from 540 AD around Movilla Abbey but was torched and razed in the 1570s, by Irish clans trying to keep out the English. What they got instead was the Scots, especially from Ayrshire, who settled in large numbers during the 17th century Plantations. At the dawn of the industrial age, places called "new town" were springing up all over, so this one became specified as Newtownards. It was a large market town but growth was hampered by lack of a port — the lough was too shallow — so goods had to be lugged to and from Donaghadee. But in 1860 the railway connected it to Belfast and the population increased rapidly, sharing the ups and downs of Northern Ireland's economic heartland.
The counties of Northern Ireland have been abolished so since 2015 it's been part of Ards and North Down "super-district".
The challenge for Newtownards ever since is to be more than just a commuter town for Belfast. Its industries were never traditional smoke-stack, and the Council sees its future in niche areas of agri-business, engineering, and IT such as cyber-security. But in 2022 many industrial lots lie vacant, and its principal employment sector of services and hospitality has been hard hit.

See[edit]
The 3rd Marquess of Londonderry
Newtownards Priory is the ruin of a 13th-century Dominican priory. The 4th Marquess of Londonderry and Marchioness are buried here. It's on Court St, a block south of town centre. Also in the centre note the market cross and market house.
54.596-5.6751 Movilla Abbey was active for 1000 years until dissolved in 1542. What you see now is the ruins of the 15th-century Augustinian church. Enter via Movilla Cemetery, which is still in use.
54.5801-5.71552 Scrabo Tower. This grand Folly is a 135-ft (38-m) turreted tower, completed in 1859 as a memorial to Charles Vane, 3rd Marquess of Londonderry. It's in Scottish Baronial style imitating a pele tower, and the interior is occasionally open. It's built over a prehistoric hill fort, so nothing remains of that. You mostly come for the view from the hill, and the surrounding country park.   (updated Oct 2020)
54.609-5.6813 Somme Museum, 233 Bangor Road, Conlig BT23 7PH, ☏ +44 28 9182 3202. M-Th Sa 10AM-5PM. The most terrible loss of life was on the Somme in 1916, but this museum commemorates Ireland's role throughout the First World War. It's a guided tour, usually on the hour. They also manage the Ulster Memorial near Thiepval, midway between Amiens and Arras, where the Ulster Division captured the German Schwaben Redoubt. Adult £8.50, child & conc £6.   (updated Oct 2020)
54.623-5.6944 Helen's Tower is a Folly, a Baronial tower built 1848-1861 to house a poetry collection for the 5th Baron of Dufferin and Claneboye. (Was he unaware of paperbacks? Simms & McIntyre of Belfast pioneered the format from 1847.) A similar design was later used for the Ulster Memorial on the Somme. The interior is now a quirky self-catering apartment so you can't look in. You come for the woodland walk, approach from Crawfordsburn Rd to the west.
54.59-5.7655 Kempe Stones or Greengraves is a portal tomb dolmen near A20 two miles west of town.
54.609-5.6076 Drumawhey Junction is a 7.25-inch gauge miniature railway. It's just a kiddie-ride.
54.608-5.5577 Ballycopeland Windmill, built circa 1790, is a functioning stone tower mill where the cap rotates to keep the sails facing the wind. In late 2020 it's under restoration. It's one mile west of Millisle.
See Bangor for Donaghadee, a small port with boat trips to the Copeland Islands.
The sea coast south of Donaghadee has a string of caravan parks and small resorts: Millisle, Ballywalter (with the fine Italianate Ballywalter Park, but you can only visit by special tour), Ballyhalbert (where Burr Point is the most easterly mainland point in Ireland, at longitude 5.433 west; and half a mile offshore is the most easterly point of all, the rock of Big Bow Meel Island), then Portavogie and Cloughey, where the main road crosses the peninsula to Portaferry.
The A20 runs down the west side of the peninsula facing Strangford Lough.

Grand 19th-century house and gardens, the lavish creation of the 3rd Marquess of Londonderry. Having spent £150,000 on the makeover of what had been a Georgian mansion, he fortunately had £30 spare to donate to famine relief. He's the fellow commemorated by the Scrabo Tower; he also has a fancy statue in Durham where he furiously opposed laws against child labour down his coal mines. Mount Stewart slumped under later descendants until revived by the 7th Marquess, then it passed to the National Trust. Adult £10, child £5, NT free.   (updated Oct 2020)
54.536-5.5589 Grey Abbey, 129 Main St, Greyabbey BT22 2NQ (5 miles south of town). M-F 9AM-8PM, Sa Su 10AM-8PM.

In Portaferry are the ruins of a tower house and a windmill, but the main attraction is Exploris Aquarium, open daily 10AM-5PM.
54.388-5.46111 Kearney is a picturesque fishing village by a shingle beach. Its windmill is just the sorry stub of a tower. Quintin Castle[dead link] to the south has a 12th-century core engulfed by Victorian prettifying; it's now an event space, e.g., for upmarket weddings, and you can't visit. Millin Bay Cairn south again looks like a stone circle but is the tops of stones of a neolithic burial site. Those buried here were related to burials at Newgrange in County Meath and at Carrowmore in Sligo.
54.546-5.6912 Rough Island is a wildlife reserve (dogs on lead permitted) reached by a causeway at low tide. Use Easytide for a free prediction 7 days ahead, select Killyleagh as the reference point, then Rough Island tides are 10 min later (or 2 hr 15 min later than Belfast).
54.531-5.69413 Castle Espie is a wetland wildlife reserve on the shores of Strangford Lough, 2 miles southeast of Comber on Ballydrain Rd. The castle is long gone; the area was quarried, which created lagoons. It's open daily 10AM-5PM.
54.498-5.64814 Magee Island within Strangford Lough has the ruins of a tower house built 1570, and of Nendrum Monastery founded in the 5th century. Remarkably, the monastery had a tide-driven mill. The island is reached by a public road off Ballydrain Rd south of Castle Espie.
