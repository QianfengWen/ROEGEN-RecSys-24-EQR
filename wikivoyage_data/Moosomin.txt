Moosomin is a town of 2,500 (2011) in Southeastern Saskatchewan, Canada. It is a service centre for oil and gas industry, potash, and agriculture production.


Understand[edit]
Moosomin, located 20 km (12 mi) west of the Saskatchewan-Manitoba border, is a stopping point on the Trans-Canada Highway between Regina and Winnipeg. Founded in 1882 with the arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway, Moosomin was established as the first Saskatchewan community on "steel". The town was named after Chief Moosomin, who became well known for leading his band into treaty status; he signed Treaty 6 at Battleford in 1880.
Moosomin grew significantly in the late 1960s and early 1970s with the construction of a major potash mine 35 km to the north. The PotashCorp Rocanville potash mine just north of the community is undergoing a $2.8-billion expansion, and the $60-million Red Lily Wind Farm just west of the community started producing power in 2011. The Southeast Integrated Care Centre is a major health care centre for a large region of southeastern Saskatchewan and southwestern Manitoba, and there has been significant activity in the local oil patch, which is at the northern end of the Bakken Formation.
