By car[edit]
Driving into Orocovis can be challenging. You should not speed through the streets. Try to follow the flow of the local traffic if possible. The mountain roads can be narrow, hilly and curvy.

By bus[edit]
Some people prefer to visit Orocovis by way of tour bus. The term chinchorreo translates to bar-hopping. Chinchorreo in Puerto Rico refers to the activity of visiting restaurants and other eating or drinking venues along a 'gastronomic route'. A chinchorreo bus can be booked, usually from San Juan and the tour could include stops in bars and restaurants in Morovis and Orocovis located on PR-143 and PR-155.
