Beach at Boca de Pascuales
Boca de Pascuales is a Pacific coast beach town in the southern state of Colima. It is most popular among surfers who come for the consistently tasty waves and the town's mellow vibe. Few tourists travel to Colima, so the beaches around Pascuales are lightly populated and can be a great place to catch a tan while enjoying some cheap, ice-cold Mexican cervezas.


Understand[edit]
Pascuales is most popular as a surfer's beach and is often compared to Puerto Escondido. It is known for high, fast beach-breaking barrels. A river emptying into the ocean on the north end of the beach helps keep the sandbars high and Pascuales boasts rideable waves every day throughout the spring and summer seasons. Early morning offers the best waves.

18.857582-103.9625891 Las Hamacas del Mayor, n/a (on the main drag closest to the beach). 10:30 - 18:00. Very popular palapa style beach restaurant with frosty margaritas and fresh seafood dishes, prepared however you'd like. The grilled lobster tails are excellent and quite inexpensive. And yes, they really do have hammocks where you can just lie in the shade all day as the waiters bring you an endless parade of frozen margaritas or cold beer. 
18.85785-103.9630852 La Aldea Bruja, n/a (on the beach, about 100 meters from Las Hamacas del Mayor), ☏ +52 313 148 8407. 09:00 - 18:00. Classic Mexican beachside palapa restaurant with plastic resin chairs that always seem to sink a foot into the sand when you sit down, but you don't care because you're a few meters from the sea, the beers are icy cold and dirt cheap, and the seafood is always fresh and tasty. This place is known for their coconut shrimp. Oh yeah, they also have hammocks. 
18.860663-103.9660863 Palapa de Chuyita, n/a (on the beach, or if you're walking on the main drag, near the turnabout as you approach the river). 09:00 - 18:00. Cheap eats for the surfers and beach bums on a budget, but cool atmosphere with typical palapa for shade and resin chairs and tables. Open early, but no eggs, breads or breakfast fare....just a single seafood menu all day. Some interesting items though, including a deviled octopus that's to die for. Cold beer served in big bomber bottles.
