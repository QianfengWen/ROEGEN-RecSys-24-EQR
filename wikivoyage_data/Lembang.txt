Do[edit]
Tangkuban Perahu crater.-6.77107.61 Tangkuban Perahu, Jalan Raya Tangkuban Parahu no 282 (from Lembang take angkot to Cikole or Subang (black angkot) to the park entrance; it is possible to hire angkot (charter) to the top and back (approximately Rp100,000 for a car, negotiate with the drivers at the entrance). 20 minutes away downhill on foot from the two craters. While you cannot get down to the crater because of its very steep elevation (and is fenced), you can still enjoy the marvelling view of Ratu and Upas. It's a photographer's paradise! Most tourists only tend to see these two craters and forget Domas, the only crater that can get you an up close and personal encounter. You'll feel what a typical volcano has to offer, such as bubbling mud, boiling water, and hissing smell of sulphur, within a safe distance of course. You can even boil an egg by dunking it in the hot water! But to see Domas Crater you have to hire a guide which in fact it is not necessary. If you do not want to buy anything, politely and persistently say "No" to the pushy vendors that sell souvenirs and the other vendors will not offer you anymore, because they offer someone in a queue. Weekends for Indonesian: Rp30,000, for non-Indonesian Rp300,000; weekdays: Rp20,000 and Rp200,000 respectively.   (updated Mar 2020)
