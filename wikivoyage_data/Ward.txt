Map of Ward
There is no public transport to get around the district.  Ward is small enough to get around by foot but as the attractions are out of town you will need a bicycle or car.

See[edit]
-41.7206174.13511 Salt works at Lake Grassmere (Located north of Ward on the coast.). See the large stacks of salt when passing on SH1. (updated Mar 2022)
-41.84462174.183532 Ward Beach. A must for all rock hounds. From the car park walk north to the Chancet Rocks, limestone outcrops which shelter the rare Marlborough rock daisy. 90 min return. The foreshore is also home to a seal colony. Take care to not get too close (the Department of Conservation advise 20m) to the seals as they can move surprisingly quickly on land and have a nasty bite. There is a shorter walk across the Flaxbourne River to the southern pinnacles. 45 min return. Ward Beach is said to be a spectacular place to be in a storm, but it is not a safe swimming beach in any weather. (updated Mar 2022)
Do[edit]
-41.72522174.205081 Go swimming at Marfells Beach. A safer beach than much of the eastern coast, it's at the southern end of Lake Grassmere accessed off Marfells Beach Road. The Beach is 8 km off the state highway. There is a Department of Conservation camp site at the beach and a walk around the coast to the lighthouse at Cape Campbell. This is a free alternative to the Cape Campbell walkway but as it is along the beach care must be taken of the tide. (updated Mar 2022)
-41.876174.00522 Saw Cut Gorge. Walk to the limestone Saw Cut Gorge. (updated Mar 2022)
