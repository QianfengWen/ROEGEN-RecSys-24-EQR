Potosí, at around 4,000 metres, is one of the world's highest large cities. It is located in the Potosí Department of Bolivia. The wealthy history of Potosí is reflected in the narrow streets, colonial mansions and the many churches, which make the city a UNESCO World Heritage site.


Understand[edit]

Potosí was founded in 1546 after the discovery of the rich silver deposits in the Cerro Rico. It soon became one of the wealthiest and largest cities in the Americas.  The mines of the Cerro Rico are the richest mines in all of world history and may have produced 60,000 tons of silver. The name Potosí was adopted by San Luis de Potosí in Mexico to reflect their hopes for equal riches. It is reputed that at one time mules were shoed with silver due to the difficulty of getting supplies of iron to the city. Some of this wealth was used to build magnificent baroque churches (UNESCO listed sites) and monasteries. Hundreds of thousands of indigenous labourers and African slaves perished in mines in the three centuries of colonial rule. The miners were often below ground for weeks at a time. In 1800 the silver mines were depleted and tin became the major ore mined. They are now mining rare earths. All of this has led to a slow economic decline.

Collective cabs that travel slightly quicker but more expensive than the buses can also be arranged to Sucre (Bs. 35-50, 2½-3 hr) and Oruru (Bs. 120). These leave when full and are a godsend during bus strikes. You may buy additional seats for more comfort or faster departures.

By taxi[edit]
From Sucre it is worth hiring a cab for 2 or more people as the trip is faster and more comfortable than one on a collective cab or a bus, and the cab leaves at your schedule.

By plane[edit]
If arriving at Sucre airport, there are shared taxis that depart from the airport. Upon exiting the airport, look to your right and there is a taxi rank. The cost is Bs. 50 per person (as of Nov. 2014) or if you wish to hire the entire taxi (expreso) the cost is Bs. 200. The taxi will usually drop you off in Potosí's main plaza.
To return, taxis leave from the "ex-terminal". If you wish to return to the airport, you should negotiate with the driver, it will be between Bs. 40-50 pp.

Miners at work
 Mining tour. A visit to Potosí cannot be mentioned without a visit to one of the cooperative mines. It is a kind of poverty tourism that many tourists are eager to embrace. It's a shocking experience as the methods of working haven't changed much since the colonial times. Working conditions are terrible: most miners die of silicosis in their forties. Still, many people don't have another choice and around 10,000 people work in the mines. A tour starts with a visit to the miners' market to buy gifts for the miners like coca leaves, drinks, cigarettes or dynamite. You will then visit an ore refinery plant where the miners sell whatever deposits they manage to collect. Then you head to the mines, where a typical visit will have you walking and crawling through it for about 2~3 hr. You can talk, take photographs and share your gifts with the miners.Taking a tour of one of the cooperative mines is still a good way to get a sense of the social price paid for the mineral wealth of the few. The dust is supposed to contain silicon that leads to silicosis (wear a disposable mask!) among the miners. Water dropping from the walls and ceiling is said to contain arsenic and cyanide. You can see asbestos fibers in the rock walls. Many of the mine props are snapped and in 2003 there was a minor ceiling cave-in that forced visitors to wait a bit before being able to exit the mine. One very interesting aspect of the mine was the little side chamber near the entrance to the mine that contained a statue of "El Tio," a diabolic figure that the miners make offerings to. They say that God may rule aboveground, but that El Tio is in charge down below.Btw. they don't do explosions just for tourists, but for the sake of the mine. People with claustrophobic tendencies, be wary, Silver Mine Tours takes you deep into the guts of this rabbit warren of a mine. It seems the safety aspect is very low, actually totally missing. There are many tour agencies in Potosí offering this tour, shop around before buying. The price is around Bs. 80-130. (updated Jun 2018)
