Sunset Boulevard
Beverly Hills is an enclaved city in Los Angeles County in Southern California, surrounded almost entirely by Los Angeles. Since the 1950s Beverly Hills has marketed itself as a high-end shopping venue and home of the rich and famous, which still rings true today – its reputation has even been the basis of a few popular TV shows such as The Beverly Hillbillies and Beverly Hills, 90210. Santa Monica Boulevard bisects the city, with most of the businesses to the south, and the north being primarily residential. Most visitors come to shop or dream of shopping, or to try and hunt down their favorite celebrities' homes, but be careful! Many celebrities consider that stalking.
Beverly Hills 90210 fans will be disappointed that there is no West Beverly High. Some of the backdrops of the fictitious West Beverly High were filmed at Torrance High School in Torrance.

By public transit[edit]
The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority provides bus service into Beverly Hills, connecting with the rail network. Rapid bus 720 runs along Wilshire Boulevard, connecting Beverly Hills with the Fairfax district, Koreatown, and Downtown Los Angeles to the east, and with Westwood and Santa Monica to the west. Rapid bus 704 runs along Santa Monica Boulevard, connecting Beverly Hills with West Hollywood, Hollywood, Silver Lake and Downtown Los Angeles to the east, and with Century City and Santa Monica to the west.

Get around[edit]
Beverly Hills has several large, well-marked public parking garages in its downtown area, but they tend to fill up quickly.  Virtually all of the shops and restaurants are walkable from any of the garages. Parking in Beverly Hills is extremely difficult even with the large parking structures, so it is strongly advised to walk or use public transport. If you choose to drive, be aware that there is a law against oversized pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles weighing more than 6,000 lb (2,700 kg).

Situated on the bustling Beverly Drive, this cozy eatery has had a loyal clientele since its '97 debut and routinely packs in new converts for its American-style comfort food. Uncomplicated, but no less innovative and tasty salads, fish, meats, sandwiches and assorted entrees form an inviting menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Ahi Three Ways (Seared Ahi with Pepper Corn, Crepe Wrapped Ahi, Ahi Tartar, Mixed Greens and a Warm Ponzu Sauce), Black & White Salmon, Breakfast Quesadilla, Applewood Smoked Bacon Sandwich and Three Cheese Ravioli are menu standouts. Prepare for an excellent bread assortment. The room is bright, airy and warm, presenting a taste of Americana with old farm utensils and folk art hanging on the muted-colored walls. Location equals waiting list for Saturday-Sunday brunch. But it's worth the wait. Most weeknights a reservation can be avoided. But this is Beverly Hills, so... Amazing brownies. 
34.071991-118.3883262 Il Cielo, 9018 Burton Way (at Doheny Dr), ☏ +1-310-276-9990. Romantic, alfresco hideaway in Beverly Hills combines dreamy ambiance and fine, Italian cuisine.

34.071249-118.4012815 Porta Via, 424 N Cañon Dr (at Brighton), ☏ +1-310-274-6534.

Not too pricey, which is nice. 
Splurge[edit]
34.069236-118.4061286 Crustacean, 9646 South (Little) Santa Monica Blvd (at Bedford Ave), ☏ +1-310-205-8990. From the moment the An family opened the doors to their posh, multi-level eatery in 1997, the Asian and Vietnamese-inspired menu has wowed food lovers – not too mention the interior design of the restaurant/bar, which blends an evocative Asian aesthetic with Hollywood style. The glamorous vibe and hot bar scene aside, it's the food that is the main draw, which features Dungeness crab, gigantic grilled tiger prawns, Sea Bass and the famous garlic noodles. 
34.066879-118.4007157 Cut, 9500 Wilshire Blvd (at S Rodeo Dr), ☏ +1-310-276-8500. Ubiquitous Mr. Wolfgang Puck returns, this time to the Regent Beverly Wilshire in Beverly Hills, with a steakhouse that has the town abuzz. Urbane service and top-shelf cuisine set the stage for a delicious, though pricey dining experience. 
34.067416-118.4019528 The Grill on the Alley, 9560 Dayton Way (at Wilshire Blvd), ☏ +1-310-276-0615. M-Th 11:30AM-10:30PM, F Sa 11:30AM-11PM, Su 5-9PM. Prominent, old school inspired steakhouse known for the Hollywood powerbrokers who power lunch in The Grill's sleek, leather banquettes, expense account credit card in hand. With a bar perfectly situated upon entering, there is a nice emphasis on cocktail culture to go along with the juicy steaks, fish and seafood and other classic dishes. The décor is decidedly masculine, with an east coast (think Manhattan) tenor permeating the usually noisy room. A phenomenal menu top to bottom. 
34.067534-118.4091249 La Dolce Vita, 9785 Santa Monica Blvd (at Wilshire Blvd), ☏ +1-310-278-1845. M-Sa 5PM-2AM. This celebrated Italian eatery in Beverly Hills dates back to the 1960s, and is a throwback to the good, old days in Los Angeles when folks actually dressed up for a night on the town. The place was a hotbed for the who's who. The décor remains dark and sophisticated, highlighted by the classic brick walls, adorned with glossies of Hollywood legends. Step inside and one might close their eyes and feel the presence of Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin holding court in one of the plush booths. And apparently, as research points out, every president since Kennedy has enjoyed a fine meal at La Dolce Vita. Nostalgia and presidential history aside, the food remains delightful; lasagna, veal, steak, capellini, risotto, linguini and so on – it's all here and it's quite superb. 
34.068836-118.39884910 Mastro's, 246 N Cañon Dr (at Wilshire Blvd), ☏ +1-310-888-8782. Expert mix of classic steakhouse, chic bar scene and well-heeled denizens makes for one heck of a dining experience; that it's located smack dab in the center of glitzy Beverly Hills only seems apropos once you step inside. Two lounges, one upstairs and one down, buffer the main dining room, which features a menu touting wonderful steak selections, as well as seafood and chicken. Side dishes demand top billing, too. The upstairs lounge is quite a scene, with a pianist crooning standards and bartenders whipping up endless orders of martinis for a showy crowd. The whole place operates at high speed, but the old school-meets-modern elegance ambiance, which is appealing in its own right, never overshadows the real star of the show – the food. 
34.068374-118.37657111 Matsuhisa, 129 N La Cienega Blvd, ☏ +1-310-659-9639. Better known for his Nobu restaurants, this is the original restaurant of Nobu Matsuhisa, one of the most influential sushi chefs in the world. Truly fantastic. 
34.068085-118.40333312 Mr. Chow, 344 N Camden Dr, ☏ +1-310-278-9911. Famed, ultra-chic Chinese eatery built upon the egos and expense accounts of celebrities, wanna-be celebrities, Hollywood busybodies and the in-crowd. Since opening in 1974, Mr. Chow has remained a culinary heavyweight in the pantheon of Los Angeles dining, not too mention the enduring allure it has for the A-list. Austere in design, with trademark black and white checkerboard floor and tiny tables bunched close together, the dining room is always bustling, still channeling the 'café society' vibe restaurant founder Michael Chow instilled in the place from when it opened. There are now Mr. Chow restaurants in London, New York, and coming soon, Las Vegas. Do try the Drunken Fish. 
34.06753-118.39758813 Spago, 176 N Cañon Dr, ☏ +1-310-385-0880. Wolfgang Puck's flagship is worth a splurge, and you can say you ate at the real deal. The food is excellent, the decor (designed by his wife) is terrific, and Wolfgang himself often stops by if he's in town.   
34.067383-118.40080714 Urasawa, 218 N Rodeo Dr (near Wilshire Blvd), ☏ +1-310-247-8939. When Masa Takayama relocated to New York, his assistant, Hiro Urasawa took over the space. The space still has the most expensive restaurant in California, but it's well worth it for sushi fanatics.

Flavors range from the basic (milk chocolate or red velvet) to the exotic (ginger lemon or chai latte).
