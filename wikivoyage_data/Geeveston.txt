Geeveston is a town of 600 people (2016) along the Huon Highway (A6) in Southern Tasmania. It's the gateway to Hartz Mountains National Park. Geeveston is the centre of Tasmania's apple and fruit-growing industry, and has also been highly reliant on the timber industry since the late 19th century.


Understand[edit]
It is rich in Tasmania's forestry history and only a short drive away from the Hartz Mountains National Park. Once called Light Wood Bottom, Geeveston was named after William Geeves, a preacher who was granted land in 1842. The name was changed to Geeveston in 1851.
Geeveston is a small, thriving town with a bank, post office, accommodation, launderette and shops. It is also the last stop for supplies and petrol before entering the Southern Forest (where the Tahune airwalk is located). The town only has one (non-bank) ATM in the IGA store which will incur a usage charge, so it may be best to withdraw money before arriving.
Take a walk around 'Tasmania's Forest Town' and keep an eye out for the increasing number of wooden sculptures of prominent local figures.
The road between Huonville, Geeveston and the Southern Forest is filled with houses and farms who grow their own produce and is a great place to buy apples, cherries, pears, nectarines, woodwork and plants.

Get in[edit]
Geeveston is a 55-km drive from Hobart along the A6. The Bruny Island Ferry services Huonville and from there is a 10-minute drive to Geeveston.
