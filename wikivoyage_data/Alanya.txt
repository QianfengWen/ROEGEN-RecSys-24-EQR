Alanya is a large resort in Pamphylia on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey, with a population of 364,180 in 2022. It's a modern town but dominated by its ancient citadel, with a long beach strip either side. 


Understand[edit]
Much of Turkey's coastline is rugged, with only small coves for harbours and inland access, but from Antalya to Alanya and further east is the low coastal plain of Pamphylia. It's narrow, hemmed in by the Taurus Mountains, but has attracted settlers from prehistoric times to the modern era of Airbuses and Boeings. "Pamphylia" means land of many peoples, and each of them has occupied the defensible crag here and given it a different name. The Luwians called it Korakassa or "protruding city" for the way the crag divides the long sweep of beach, and then it was Coracesium then Kalonoros. When the Seljuks captured it in the 13th century under Sultan Alaeddin Kayqubad I, some savvy courtier renamed it Alaiye after him, so it only remained for Atatürk to enjoy an overnight stay in 1935 and tweak the name to Alanya. Modern tour operators call it "Antalya Region Alanya" from the airport you fly into: this entity stretches for over 20 km either side of town.

Get in[edit]
36°32′24″N 31°59′24″EMap of Alanya
Antalya Airport (AYT IATA) 125 km west is the usual arrival point for international visitors. Those on package holidays are bussed straight to their hotels. Otherwise take tram 1A (every 15min) from Terminal 1 to the tram stop Cırnık, cross the bridge and take a bus (every 30min) from the bus stop called "Serik Cd-1" to Alanya. 
Gazipaşa–Alanya Airport (GZP  IATA) is 30 km southeast of town and has flights from Istanbul (IST and SAW) and Ankara, plus a few budget carriers. The Havaş shuttle from the airport to Alanya is available for every arriving flight. The fare is 165 TL (Feb 2024). For the way back there are about 5 departures per day. 
Buses from Istanbul run every hour or so and take 13 hours to Alanya; they may run via Afyon or via Bolu and Konya. In 2023 an adult single is about 800 TL. From Ankara they take 9 hours via Konya, from Izmir 8 hours via Denizli (for Pamukkale), and from Adana 9 hours via Mersin and Antalya. From Nevşehir (for Cappadocia) they take 9 hours via Konya, where you may have to change. Operators on these routes include Metro Turizm, Pamukkale and Flixbus. 
Another route from Istanbul or Ankara is to take the YHT fast train to Konya, which connects with buses to Antalya and Alanya, taking 6 hours.
Buses from Antalya run every 30 min and take two hours, for a fare of 150 TL (Feb 2024). Operators include Alanyalilar and Güney Akdeniz, the long-distance bus lines don't offer tickets for this short hop. From Side or Manavgat take a dolmuş. 
36.554331.97781 Alanya Otogar is 2 km west of town centre. It has ticket offices and toilets, and is reasonably clean and efficient.
From Kyrenia ("Girne") in Northern Cyprus, there's sometimes a fast-cat foot-passenger ferry, but it's not sailing in 2023. Travel instead via Taşucu on the summer fast-cat or year-round car ferry.
With your own boat, Alanya is not a Port of Entry into Turkey, so if you arrive from Cyprus or other foreign waters, you need to clear immigration and customs at Taşucu to the east or Antalya to the west.

Get around[edit]
Walking is best option in town centre. Dolmuşes ply all the main streets, flag them down anywhere, or join others attempting to do so.
Alanya Teleferik is a gondola cable car from Sultan Alaadin Cd (Damlataş station) by the beach to Ehdemek (Kale station) at the top of the citadel. It runs continuously daily from 09:30 to 23:00, and the ride takes five minutes. A round trip for foreigners is 190 TL, but if you can pass yourself off as Turkish it's only 35 TL each way .

See[edit]
Looking west from the Citadel
The Citadel (Kale) occupies the headland between the port and beaches. Most of the area is free to stroll, and you only pay for İç Kale the inner castle. This obvious defensive position has been occupied since prehistory and was fortified in Roman and Byzantine times, but what you see now is a Seljuk bastion built from 1220 AD. Houses, shops and other buildings have sprung up within the citadel walls. Kale Cd the road up from town is a 3 km zigzag, and the taxis waiting near the foot are betting you can't walk it - see above for the cable-car. Near the top of the street is the Ottoman bedestan or covered market, Süleymaniye Mosque, and Ehmedek gatehouse.
36.533431.99041 Inner Castle (İç Kale), ☏ +90 242 513 1228. Daily 08:00-22:00. This area commands great views and contains a Byzantine church, cisterns and storerooms. Adult 150 TL.   (updated Jul 2023)
36.527831.98632 Dil Varna Burnu is the precipitous promontory south of the castle. It has monastery ruins but nowadays there's no access on foot. You see it from below on boat trips, where the sport is to dive in, swim to the caves, and scramble through to the other side of the promontory where you leap in to rejoin your boat. Keep a close watch on the boatman's boy, as he's the one who knows how to shin up into the correct cave to get through.
36.536431.99833 Red Tower (Kızıl Kule), Iskele Cd 102. Daily 08:30-17:30. Redbrick hexagonal tower 33 m high, completed in 1226 by Ebu Ali Reha of Aleppo. There's a small museum display within, and you can climb the 78 steep stairs for harbour views. Adult 12 TL.  (updated Jul 2023)

The air within is very humid and laden with CO₂, which they implausibly tout as a remedy for asthma. Adult 10 TL.   (updated Jul 2023)
Other caves line the sea-cliffs around town, seen on boat-trips. Some are submerged and can be entered by scuba-divers - not snorkelers, as the air within them is bad.

36.698431.729612 Alara Castle 37 km west of town was Byzantine, but rebuilt by the Seljuks in 1232. It teeters atop a crag, the path is clear and safe enough but unsuitable for children or those with impaired mobility.

The flooded Dim Çayı valley
Beaches are sandy, stretching several km either side of the headland.

Paragliding: half a dozen outfits offer this.

Money: lots of ATMs and several banks with currency exchange in town centre. Many shops accept euros and Nordic currencies, but may have a cute idea of the exchange rate.
Supermarkets: lots of small stores open daily, Migros are the main chain here.
Tourist-trappy shops line the beachfront, selling fake everything, not worth what you haggle them down to.
