Winter view of Bangor
Bangor is a small city of 32,000 people (2019) in the Highlands region of Maine.  Bangor is the third-largest city in the state and the retail, cultural and service center for central, eastern and northern Maine. It is a good base for exploring Aroostook County, Down East & Acadia, the Maine Highlands and Maine’s Mid-Coast. 


Understand[edit]
Incorporated as a town in 1791, it was sacked by the British during the War of 1812, was known for its strong anti-slavery stance in the Underground Railroad and US Civil War era and was heavily damaged by a 1911 fire. It is the closest city to Fort Knox State Historic Site, built from 1844-1869. As the first US landfall for arriving jetliners from Europe, its international airport is a welcome sight to pilots who want to throw drunkard passengers off inbound commercial flights. Its cultural facilities, including the University of Maine, rival much larger cities. As the home of author Stephen King, it appears often in fictional works, but travellers can be assured that as the city is relatively safe and peaceful they will not be eaten by mutant zombies.
