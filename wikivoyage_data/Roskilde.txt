Orientation[edit]
Roskilde is south of Roskilde Inlet with the Viking Museum and some of the accommodation and restaurant options nearby.  Central Roskilde is 1 km further south centered on the pedestrian street Algade/Skomagergade and Roskilde Cathedral.  The city centre is quite small at around 1 km² bordered by a ring road.  The train station is at the southern end of the city centre.  Roskilde Festival is 4 km south from the train station along Køgevej.

History[edit]
Roskilde was established more than 1,000 years ago, at which time it had a wooden church and a royal farm.  In the 12th century, Roskilde Cathedral was built and Roskilde became the seat of the bishop and was also granted the status of a market town.  The town was one of the most important in Denmark for the next few centuries until the reformation ended the importance of the church.

Roskilde festival[edit]
One of the scenes at the Roskilde festival in 2014
The temporary train station used during the festival
The legendary Roskilde Festival is still going strong despite over 50 years of sex, drugs and rock'n'roll! started by a group of friends in 1971 inspired by the Woodstock festival, it has grown from a few thousand guests in its first year, to over 115,000 visitors from all over the world, and is routinely sold out with over half the tickets sold outside of Denmark.
The festival takes place in late June, early July on Roskilde Dyreskueplads south of the city. To Get in there are several options; daily during the festival trains depart from Roskilde Station to the festival's own station inside the camping area (West) every 30 minutes for 20 kr. There are also shuttle buses from Roskilde Station to the camping area (East) all day during the festival. When arriving at the festival you exchange your ticket for an armband/bracelet which gives you access to both the camping area, and the stage area.
Many people show up a week before the music starts to get their tents up so they can sleep close to the stage area, and limit walking as much as possible as the camping area is huge! A good tip is securing a place as far from trees and fences as possible, since they in essence become one big urinal during the festival. If rain is forecast, you should also attempt to camp as far from the marked walkways, preferably on a slope, since mud quickly becomes and issue.
On the camping grounds there are several service areas with food stalls and supermarkets to stock up with eat & drink, some also have first aid, toilets and showers. Inside the stage area there are also many, many restaurants and bars - most of them with a theme, and some of them are really huge and elaborate. There are also many shops where you can buy necessities and other rubbish.
Music is playing from Thursday - Sunday and are usually varied, with some international headline acts, and much experimental and indie music and the smaller stages.
