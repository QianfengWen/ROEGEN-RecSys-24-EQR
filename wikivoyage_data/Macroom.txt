Macroom (Maigh Chromtha) is a market town in County Cork, southwest Ireland. It stands halfway between Cork and Killarney at a point where the fertile Lee valley gives way to rugged uplands, and the road starts its climb over to County Kerry. Macroom has seen plenty of conflict, as shown by several tower houses and by the castle in town centre, the last major upheaval being the Anglo-Irish and Irish civil war of 1919-22. It's nowadays a quiet place, with a population in 2016 of 3,765.

From Cork it takes an hour and from Killarney 50 min; this section runs hourly M-Sa and every 2 hours Sunday.

See[edit]
51.905-8.961 Macroom Castle: the best of it is the gatehouse on the main street. This looks like a Victorian cod-medieval invention but actually dates to 1450, though it's much restored and now holds offices. Pass through the gate (it's a public road) and the Desmesne beyond is just parkland and modern buildings, but there's the shell of the castle keep — you see it just as well from the bridge on the main street.
51.885-92 The Gearagh, 2 km southwest of Macroom, was one of the last primordial oak forests in Europe. In 1954 it was mostly destroyed by logging and flooding when the River Lee was dammed for a hydro-electric power scheme. It's now an extensive wetland, haunted by thousands of tree stumps and abandoned fields and farm buildings. Coarse fishing is permitted, but pike may not be taken.
51.909-9.0283 Carrigaphooca Castle is a sturdy 14th-century turret 4 km west of town. Carrigaphooca Stone Circle 200 m east is likely Bronze Age, circa 1000 BC; only three stones remain upright in the 5-m circle. Castle and circle are on private land and you can't see much from the wooded highway.
51.9-9.0824 Prince August Toy Soldier Factory, Kilnamartyra P12 FN79 (5 km west of town), ☏ +353 26 40222. Daily 10AM-4PM. Traditional toy soldiers and other warriors: Lord of the Rings, cowboys, footballers and so on. You can book a one-hour workshop - they make, you paint, for a €12 deposit off your order.

51.814-8.8565 Michael Collins Monument marks the spot where "Ireland's lost leader" was killed on 22 Aug 1922 in an ambush at the tail-end of the Irish Civil War. See Clonakilty, Collins' birthplace, for the backstory.
52.007-9.0246 Knocknakilla, 10 km north of town, is a megalithic complex from around 1500 BC. There's a stone circle and a nearby wedge tomb. Millstreet Country Park 1 km east has gone out business.
