Holbrook is a town on Route 66 in the Mogollon Rim in Eastern Arizona, once known as the "town too rough for women and churches." The town makes a convenient base for visiting Petrified Forest National Park.


Understand[edit]
As the nearest town to Petrified Forest National Park, and often gateway to Meteor Crater, Holbrook is small city focused on travelers - there are at least 10-20 hotels/restaurants/gas stations to choose among respectively. Excellent for travelers, but mostly for services and proximity to attractions, rather than as an attraction itself, though visitors following Route 66 will find it interesting.
