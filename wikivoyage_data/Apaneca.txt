Coffee plantations can be seen from the streets of Apaneca
Apaneca is a small village in El Salvador with some great big attractions for adventurous travelers. There's mountains, forests, and two nearby volcanoes for the hikers and outdoor enthusiasts. Close to town is an outdoor adventure park with a labyrinth of natural vegetation as well as zip lines and similar thrill attractions.  


Understand[edit]
This area is noted for its abundance of coffee plantations, handicraft vendors, flowers and volcanic backdrops. A rough itinerary of sorts has been developed called the Route of the Flowers (Rutas de las Flores) that incorporates the towns of Salcoatitán, Nahuizalco, Juayúa, Apaneca, and Concepción de Ataco on a day's drive, though Apaneca has enough to keep a visitor busy for 2-3 days.

Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
Transportes Maritza Esmeralde runs several route 205 buses between San Salvador and Sonsonate. Buses depart every 30 minutes throughout the day. The 90-minute ride costs about US$2. Once in Sonsonate, change to the route 249 bus to Apaneca. Buses depart every 15 minutes for the 75 minute trip which costs about US$2.
