Map of Brackley Beach-Stanhope
Brackley Beach and Stanhope are small farming communities and popular vacation spots on the north shore of Prince Edward Island. Stanhope, and the neighbouring villages of Covehead, Grand Tracadie, and Pleasant Grove, are part of the Rural Municipality of North Shore.


Understand[edit]
Covehead Harbour Lighthouse
Brackley Beach, formerly Brackley Point, is approximately 10 km (6 mi) north of the community of Brackley, from which it derives its name. It is bordered on the north by Prince Edward Island National Park which is home to sand dunes, barrier islands and sandspits, beaches, sandstone cliffs, wetlands and forests. The Brackley Beach area became a popular vacation spot in the late 19th century, and its shoreline was designated as part of the national park in 1937. Activities include deep sea fishing, bike, canoe and kayak rentals, horseback riding, campgrounds, several restaurants and dairy bars as well as Prince Edward Island's only drive-in theater.
Stanhope is the original home of the first major groups of British emigrants who settled in Prince Edward Island in 1770, and was once a local hotsport during PEI's rum-running era. It is now a popular summer vacation location and home to Stanhope Beach (inside Prince Edward Island National Park), which is less busy than Brackley or Cavendish Beaches.

Get in[edit]
Brackley Beach is 21 km (13 mi) north of downtown Charlottetown on Route 15, passing the Charlottetown Airport (YYG IATA). Stanhope is 21 km (13 mi) northeast of downtown Charlottetown via Route 2 and Route 25.

Get around[edit]
Brackley Beach and Stanhope are about 10 minutes apart and are connected by Route 6. The two communities and beaches are also connected by the Gulf Shore Parkway in Prince Edward Island National Park.
