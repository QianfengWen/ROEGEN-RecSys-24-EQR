Kingaroy is an agricultural town in the south Central Queensland.


Get in[edit]
Kingaroy is about a 2.5 hour drive north-west from Brisbane. It is situated on the D'Aguilar and Bunya Highways and on the intersection of State Route 49 and State Route 90.

Get around[edit]
See[edit]
Dubbed "The Peanut Capital of Australia", Kingaroy has much to display about these popular legumes. Dominating the skyline of Haly Street are enormous Peanut Silos and serve as the main attraction. The rich red soil of the land is amazing to see after recent rains, when it contrasts the green of the new growth. The lookout at Mt Wooroolin provides a panoramic view of the town and is only 4km from the CBD.

Do[edit]
Although one of the greatest activities in Kingaroy is just to laze around and enjoy the small town atmosphere, several annual events are worth a look. Foremost among them is the Wine and Food In The Park Festival held each March. Other annual events include the Kingaroy Show (May); the Burrandowan Picnic Races (held at Burrandowan on the outskirts of the Shire, also in May); the Kingaroy Peanut Festival (August); the two-day Taabinga Spring Music Festival (October); and the Christmas Carnival (December).

Buy[edit]
As the largest town in the South Burnett, Kingaroy has a shopping centre containing grocery and retail stores.

Eat[edit]
Being the "Peanut Capital of Australia" it's pretty obvious what to dine upon. Mobile Peanut Vans scout the area and offer a wide variety of peanuts including the usual shelled, unshelled, and smoked varieties as well as more exotic flavours such as sugared and Mexican.
