Geography[edit]
Ath is at the confluence of the Eastern and Western Dender rivers, where they form the Dender River. Together with the Blaton-Ath canal, the town core is in practice surrounded by water, connected to the peripheral districts by about a dozen bridges. It's in the middle of an agricultural region with low hills, with an altitude of about 50 m. Two natural reserves are nearby: Le pays des collines and Le parc naturel des plaines de l’Escaut.

History[edit]
Baudoiun IV, Count of Hainaut, had a keep built here in the 1160s to protect his lands – the Burbant tower. A "new town" grew up around it with privileges and a big market, attracting merchants and customers from far away. Tradesmen from tailors to goldsmiths and cabinetmakers settled in Ath, and in the 14th century two fortifications were built to protect the town. The army of Louis XIV conquered Ath in 1667, and he ordered Vauban – the foremost fortification architect of that time – to design a new fortification. It wouldn't stand for a century, after a siege in 1745 during the War of the Austrian Succession it was dismantled.
The industrial revolution in the 19th century brought prosperity to Ath once again. Wood, rock, textile and agricultural industries were established and the town and it became a railway node. Nevertheless, as in much of Europe, industrial activities declined during the 20th century. Industries still remain in the peripheries of Ath, and the town today is a place for commerce, artisans, and "liberal professions". In 2008 Ath was awarded the European Destinations of Excellence award by the European Commission, an award given to lesser known destinations to promote sustainable tourism.

Climate[edit]
As western Belgium in general, Ath has a temperate oceanic climate, influenced by the wet and mild currents from the Atlantic, occasionally also by continental dry winds bringing warmer weather in the summer and colder in the winter.

Events[edit]
Giants of Ath : Mr and Mrs Goliath
The  Ducasse  festival, dating back to the Middle Ages, is the most famous event of Ath. It takes place for 10 days in late August with the main event on the fourth Sunday of the month. This is a celebration of the victory of David over Goliath, and different statues of giants are paraded through the streets. These giants depict important figures in local history. The festival was inscribed on the UNESCO list of Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity from 2008 to 2022. It was delisted as one of the figures in the parade – a white person with face painted black – was perceived as racist and as such the event was considered inappropriate for the list.
