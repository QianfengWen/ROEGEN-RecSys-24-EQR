Hale'iwa (Ha-lay-eee-va) is a small beach town on the North Shore of Oahu. It's the most built up of the towns in the region, has some of the better restaurants, and is generally the place to go if you're staying within half an hour or so of here.


Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
From Honolulu or Waikiki: Or if you have a car, take the H1 west to the H2 north, follow signs for the North Shore and you'll end up on the Kamehameha Hwy. Look for signs to Hale'iwa. The journey is about 40min.
From Schofield Barracks Area: There is a sign on Highway 99 indicating where to turn to reach Hale'iwa.
From Waimea Bay: Head west on Kamehameha Hwy, and take a right turn at the sign for Hale'iwa.

By bus[edit]
From Honolulu/Waikiki, it's pretty easy to bus it instead of driving. Catch the Number 52 bus at Ala Moana Shopping Center, or the Number 55 "Kaneohe/Circle Island" and get off in Hale'iwa to stretch your legs. Help the planet, help reduce Oahu congestion and don't rent a car, catch the bus. You'll save money and meet real people who really live here.
You might want to take a jacket or fleece with you since the air conditioning inside buses is often pretty fierce.

Get around[edit]
The town is small, and best seen on foot. However, there are several other options to see the town, and the whole of the North Shore. You can rent a bike, moped or even an Uber if need be. With the North Shore being visited by over half of the visitors that come to Oahu, you will want to take advantage of nimble transportation.
