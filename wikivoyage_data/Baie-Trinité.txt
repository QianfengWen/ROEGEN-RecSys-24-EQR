Baie-Trinité offers various services to travellers on Route 138. The main attractions of the municipality of Baie-Trinité are:

hiking trails: the coastal path, between Pointe-à-Poulin and Anse à la Morue (near Pointe-des-Monts) is a must in a vacation schedule;

Understand[edit]
Baie-Trinité is made up of the following villages: Baie-Trinité-Ouest, Baie-Trinité and Baie-Trinité-Est. In addition, this municipality has small hamlets distributed along the coast (in order from the north): Ruisseau de l'Ours, Islets-Caribou, Petit-Mai, Pointe-à-Poulin and Pointe des Monts.

Geography[edit]
Dam on the Trinité River in Baie-Trinité
Sandstone at low tide in Baie-Trinité
Pointe-des-Monts is an important narrowing point of the Gulf of St. Lawrence on the northern coast. Pointe-des-Monts face Les Méchins, which is on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River; the distance between the two shores is 45 km.
Unlike the rest of the North Shore, the route of Route 138 deviates from the coast for 35 km between the village of Baie-Trinité and Godbout (at the Godbout River bridge); this distance from the shore goes up to 9.3 km, in the Lac des Monts area.
Between the villages of Godbout and Baie-Trinité, the coast of the St. Lawrence River has many steep promontories and wild coves that are accessible only by sea. Grande Anse St-Augustin is the largest of these handles; it is embedded between cliffs and a small island in the middle; it presents a sandstone at low tide. This cove is a bucolic place to visit by sea kayak or pleasure craft. This coastal area, between the mouth of the Petite Rivière Godbout (to the west) and the Pointe des Monts, has remained intact for millennia: no logging, farming or mining. Thus, this area has remained natural since the passage of native sailors and explorers, the Basques, Jacques Cartier, Samuel de Champlain and the Acadians.
The waters along the northern shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence are pure, crystal clear, salty and cold. Coming from the Atlantic, the Labrador current enters through the Strait of Belle-Isle against the current towards the west in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, going up along the North Shore. The waters of the Côte-Nord rivers mix with the highly saline and oxygenated waters of the Labrador Current. This mixing of waters generates a marine ecological environment that is reputed to be one of the richest on the planet. This environment is inhabited by a variety of crustaceans, molluscs, marine fish, seals and dolphins, as well as plankton and large cetaceans.

History[edit]
Baie-Trinité Cemetery
Pointe-des-Monts is an old hamlet near (south side) the old lighthouse which was erected in 1829-30. Since then, this post proved to be a chief town on the coast of the North Shore, then almost uninhabited. The local community was then made up of First Nations (Indigenous) fishermen, seal hunters and trappers. Pointe-des-Monts reached its peak around 1880; then this hamlet gradually declined before disappearing. After the Second World War (1939-45), only the family of the lighthouse keeper lived in this place.
Following the commissioning of a new automated lighthouse, Pointe-des-Monts is uninhabited during the winter season. In 1964, thanks to the efforts of the last lighthouse keepers, the Pointe-des-Monts Lighthouse narrowly escaped demolition; it is then acquired by the Quebec government. In 1965, Pointe-des-Monts was classified as a historic monument by the Government of Quebec. The site then became a major element of Quebec's maritime heritage. Subsequently, a rich exhibition on the history of the place is presented in the lighthouse museum.
