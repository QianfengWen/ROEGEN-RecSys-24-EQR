Stillwater, in the Frontier Country region of Oklahoma, is home to Oklahoma State University (OSU). It has a distinct small town feel combined with a uniquely welcoming mid-west atmosphere, and OSU brings a young diverse population further enriching the city's culture. The population of 50,000 (2019) varies depending on the time of year from a peak during OSU's homecoming football weekend to the less crowded summer when most students are on break. Stillwater has several districts each with their own unique atmosphere and places to enjoy. Whether you are looking to shop in Downtown Stillwater's boutique shops, enjoy outdoor recreation on the edge of town, or wanting to live it up at a famous bar on The Strip, Stillwater has a place for everyone.


Get in[edit]
From the Oklahoma City area, Stillwater can be reached in an hour's drive by travelling north on I-35 and then travelling east on Highway 51.  The Cimarron Turnpike serves as the major thoroughfare to reach Stillwater from the Tulsa area, and Stillwater can be reached within an hour-and-a-half using this route.
The Stillwater Regional Airport provides air service for daily commercial flights through Dallas/Fort Worth International (DFW) on American Airlines.

Get around[edit]
Map of Stillwater (Oklahoma)
Stillwater, with its relatively small size and excellent pedestrian and public transportation systems, is an extremely easy city to get around. While Stillwater is a relatively small city, a car is typically the favored method of transport. The OSU operated bus system, walking, cycling, and ride sharing services are alternatives.

By bus[edit]
The Oklahoma State University Community Transit System provides excellent service for getting around town via 6 routes from 6:20AM to 7:15PM. Then the system operates a reduced route from 7:00PM to 10:30PM. It is also an excellent way to get across the OSU campus. Riders should check the live route map and OSU Transit website ahead of time to plan their trips. Fare is 75¢ per ride; 35¢ for children (5-18), seniors (69+), and the disabled; and free to OSU students and employees (with ID) and children under 5. Transfers from one route to another are free.

By car[edit]
Stillwater is also easily navigated by car, and the city has several car rental agencies.  Highway 51 (6th Street) provides Stillwater's main crosstown East-West route, and US-177 (Perkins Rd.) serves as the main North-South route.  Both offer quick travel from one end of the city to the other.

On foot[edit]
Stillwater is fairly pedestrian-friendly, especially near downtown and around campus, but lacks in handicap accessibility in the residential areas. The city is small enough to reach some places by foot, however increasing sprawl is making it less and less of a viable option.

By bicycle[edit]
Many streets are marked to be shared with bicycles, while others have dedicated lanes directly next to the road and a few dedicated routes.  Visitors can rent a bicycle from OSU's OrangeRide program. Stillwater has two bicycle shops in town, District Bicycles and Cooper's Bicycle Center.  View city bicycle route map
