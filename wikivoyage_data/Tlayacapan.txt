Understand[edit]
Tlayacapan is a small town with a population of about 7,000.

History[edit]
Long before the arrival of Spaniards in Mexico, Tlayacapan was an Olmec settlement that was part of the Aztec trading network, a stop over on the way to more southern settlements. 

Earthquakes[edit]
Earthquakes are a common phenomenon in Central Mexico, which is geologically active. On September 19, 2017, a 7.2 magnitude earthquake shook Tlayacapan, damaging many buildings, including the historic Monastery of San Juan Bautista, and the Palacio Municipal (the oldest city hall in Mexico). The historic church remains closed to the public until restorations can be completed and public safety ensured. Damage to the church includes a fallen ceiling and a major crack that splits the building's facade.

Ex-convento San Juan Baustista - this imposing church is one of the 16th century monasteries on the slopes of Popocatapetl, which are designated as a  UNESCO World Heritage Site. The monastery complex was built by the Augustinian order between 1534 and 1574. It included the main church, courtyards, cloister, prayer rooms, a dining hall, and rooms where the monks slept. Only the main church was maintained and actively used for religious celebrations. It incorporates architectural elements from a number of different styles. The monastery is noted for its frescoes and oil paintings in the entrance hall and meditation hall.
Capilla la Exaltacion
16th century chapels - While the Augustinians were building their monastery, they were also embarking on a mission of evangelizing the native indigenous populations, and they would seek out the native temples, knock them down, and build Christian temples on their sites. There were originally 26 of these chapels in Tlayacapan, but 18 remain and have been restored and maintained. There were 3 classes of chapels, with the main chapels generally being elaborately decorated and serving a wide community, while other chapels served local neighborhoods or clusters of families and were more humble structures. The four main chapels are Capilla El Rosario, Capilla Santa Ana, Capilla de la Exaltación, and Capilla Señor Santiago
La Cerería Museum and Cultural Center (Candle Factory) - is a 16th century building where candles were once made and sold. The building is noted for its colonial architecture and its colorful early 20th century history as military headquarters for the revolutionary forces under Emiliano Zapata. Today, the building is a museum that showcases artifacts and dioramas depicting the region's past and its culture, including arts, and the story behind Chinelos.
Do[edit]




Chinelos
The Mexican tradition of chinelos is a fun spirited mockery of high class and authority. It originated in the town of Tlayacapan in the mid-19th century and subsequently became popular throughout the state of Morelos and into parts of Mexico City. Historically, the indigenous or mixed classes who worked as laborers on the sugar plantations would let off steam during carnival. They created colorful masks and costumes to dress as caricatures of the European upper classes. Chinelos have a distinctive dance that they typically perform during carnival (and do a few steps of during parades).


Chinelo
Rejuvenate your body in a temazcal. The temazcal is a pre-hispanic ritualistic steam bath that purifies the body with scented steam and opens the pores. The steam bath includes aromatic and medicinal herbs and is a great way to cap off a busy day, relaxing in the warm vapors before dinner. There are several temazcales in town, some part of a spa hotel. Most require a group size of 5 or 6 people and require reservations at least a week in advance. Some places offering temazcal include Centro Callicuahtli and Bio Calli. A temazcal typically costs M$400 to M$500 per person.
Carnival is a huge celebration in Tlayacapan, which is home to the dance of chinelos. Chinelos is a tradition throughout the state of Morelos, but it's here in Tlayacapan where the tradition originated.
Feast of San Juan Bautista - June 24 is the feast day for Tlayacapan's patron saint. Festivities take place throughout town and include chinelos.
