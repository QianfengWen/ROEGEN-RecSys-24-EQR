Blaine is a city in the Northwest Cascades region of Washington (state). It is the major land border crossing between this part of Washington and the Lower Mainland region of British Columbia, Canada. It straddles Interstate 5 which terminates in Blaine, and is on the coast of the Pacific Ocean.


Understand[edit]
Blaine (aka "the Peace Arch City") was settled by Europeans in the mid-1800s and named after James G. Blaine, secretary of state and presidential candidate. It was incorporated as a city in 1890.
Blaine is a border town and the northern terminus of Interstate 5 which becomes BC-99 as one crosses into Canada. Blaine is also the most Northwest town in the Lower 48 States.
The Department of Homeland Security has two border inspection stations: Peace Arch Crossing to the west for passenger vehicles & the "Truck Crossing" to the east for both commercial entry and passenger vehicles. A great deal of Blaine's economy is based on legal trade across the Canadian border and Blaine also has a long history of smuggling.
Its population was estimated to be 5,400 in 2018.
Blaine has two large marinas with hundreds of boats. Salmon, crab, and other seafood are widely available.
