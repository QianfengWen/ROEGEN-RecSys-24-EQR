Rothenburg ob der Tauber is a town along the Romantic Road in Bavaria, Germany, about halfway in between Frankfurt and Munich. It is best known for its medieval town centre (Altstadt), seemingly untouched by the passage of time, encircled by the undamaged 14th-century town wall. In the Middle Ages, Rothenburg ob der Tauber was a free imperial city, reaching its apex of prosperity under mayor Heinrich Toppler in the 15th century with a large population of 6,000 - much larger than Frankfurt or Munich at that time. Today Rothenburg ob der Tauber is a small, quaint town and a big tourist attraction. Especially popular with American and Japanese tour-buses and organized groups, the town can feel a bit overcrowded sometimes, but its sheer beauty makes up for that and more than justifies its popularity.


Get in[edit]

By plane[edit]
Frankfurt Airport - the closest intercontinental airport with good road and train connections to Rothenburg. ICE's run via Würzburg, where you will probably have to change to regional transport.
Nürnberg - for domestic European flights. Nuremberg is part of the VGN tariff union[dead link] for local trains and buses, making travel from there to Rothenburg quite cheap, though there are a number of changes involved in the journey.
Stuttgart - for domestic European flights.
By car[edit]
Rothenburg is close to autobahn A 7, which runs from Hamburg, via Würzburg, Rothenburg ob der Tauber, and Ulm to the Austrian border at Füssen. The most convenient exit is 108 Rothenburg ob der Tauber.
If you prefer scenery over velocity, you should take the Romantic Road (Romantische Straße) into town.
By train[edit]
The town isn't too well served by trains. There is an hourly connection from Würzburg and Ansbach, but in both cases you have to change trains at Steinbach (b. Rothenburg). Rothenburg furthermore is part of the Nuremberg's regional train network, with services twice an hour, but you have to change trains at least once to do the trip. (VGN-rates apply making a one day round-trip considerably cheaper than regular train-fares) Make sure you are buying a ticket to Rothenburg ob der Tauber - there are several towns with the name "Rothenburg" in Germany. The train station is east of the town wall, about a 15-min walk to the historic centre at Marktplatz.

The Town Hall (Rathaus) is free.

The 49.3744410.180134 Plönlein (Little Square), a few blocks south of the Market Square, offers a charming medieval sight.  Standing at the right point, you can see two towers: on the left, more or less straight ahead, is the Siebers Tower (Siebersturm) dating from 1385; and down on the right, from the Tauber valley, is the Kobolzell Gate (Kobolzeller Tor) dating from 1360.  These two access roads form a small triangular square, which is Plonlein. The Plonlein is often referred to as one of the most photographed spots in Germany.
The 49.37410.180285 Town Wall encircles the city, giving the Altstadt the shape of a head, with the nose (the Castle Garden) pointing left (west).  The existing Town Wall was built in the 14th century, was partially damaged in World War II, and restored through gifts from donors throughout the world (see plaques on the wall).  The Wall is about 2.5 km long, covered, with several towers and entrances at the gates.  One of the easiest access to get up to the sentry wall is just south of Siebers Tower (Siebersturm).  The Wall is free and offers a good vantage point to see the town.
