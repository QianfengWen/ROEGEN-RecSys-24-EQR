Aveiro is the provincial capital city of Beira Litoral province, nestled next to a ria, (a salt water lagoon) and the Vouga River delta on the Atlantic coast of Central Portugal. Its origins go back to pre-Roman times. From the 8th until the 11th century, the region was under Muslim control. The charter elevating the town to city status was conferred in 1759 by King João I.


Understand[edit]

Aveiro (ah-VAY-roo, /ɐ.ˈvɐj.ɾu/) was already a major salt producer in Roman times and continued to be so until the 1970s, mainly due to the age-old salt cod industry. It also played a major role in ceramics, ship building, metal working and machinery manufacture, as well as being a natural shipping port for centuries. Next door to Aveiro, the city of Ílhavo still has remnants of the cod fishing and salt cod industry. A famous porcelain and cut glassware factory was established there in the early 1800s and is still in operation today (guided tours are available).

Aveiro is 68 km (42 mi) to the south of Porto and 58 km (36 mi) north of Coimbra, straddling the Ria of Aveiro and the River Vouga a few kilometers from the Atlantic Ocean, where you can easily reach by car (5 minutes) or by bus (every hour). The city of Aveiro has a population of approximately 80,880 inhabitants (2021 preliminary), of which 12,500 are students at University of Aveiro, one of the most important Portuguese universities. Aveiro is at the center of the Comunidade Intermunicipal da Região de Aveiro (Aveiro Regional Intermunicipal Community), encompassing over 370,000 inhabitants.
The late poet, musician and teacher Zeca Afonso and the late physicist Dr. Mário Sacramento are both famous anti-fascist activists from the city. Overall the atmosphere is rather laid back and relaxed while some students are foreigners, lending it a somewhat cosmopolitan feel.
Architecturally, the CBD and "centro histórico" are characterized by some excellent examples of 15/16th century, Belle Epoque, Art Nouveau, Art Deco and Estado Novo buildings, while parts of the city are intersected by canals with picturesque bridges and navigated by brightly painted boats called moliceiros, similar in profile to the gondolas of Venice. Originally the moliceiro was a working boat and the name derives from moliço, a type of sea weed abundant in the lagoon and formerly harvested to be used as fertilizer in the agricultural fields of the region. Although an exaggeration, the city is called the "Portuguese Venice". The real charm of Aveiro's lifestyle lies in its coast, with its fantastic sandy beaches of São Jacinto, Torreira, Barra and Costa Nova. This local coast is branded as Costa da Prata or the Silver Coast.
Historically, the importance and prestige of Aveiro grew with the arrival in the 15th century, of princess Dna. Joana, daughter of King Afonso V, to join the sisterhood of the Monastery of Jesus. Upon her death, she bequeathed her vast wealth to the benefit of the town. Her intricately carved and decorated tomb in the monastery constitutes a singular example of fine arts of the period. In the 17th century she was canonised, thus becoming Santa Joana. By the 19th century, local parliamentarian José Estevão propelled Aveiro to the fore of industrialization by spearheading the redevelopment of the harbour facilities and city canals and the arrival of the railways, sowing the seeds for an economic boom.
Today however, the best-kept secret of its attraction apart from the extensive soft sand beaches that reach from Mira in the south to Espinho in the north is the relative authenticity and less costly accommodation and food when compared to Alentejo and the Algarve. The summer months of June to August are the busiest with holiday makers. Also, easy access to major road networks and railways make it easy to take day trips to popular destinations such as Porto, Espinho, Figueira da Foz, Coimbra, Viseu and Serra da Estrela. The Beirão people are well known for being hospitable and helpful towards anyone who is polite.
Aveiro has a humid, temperate climate in summer and a not-so-cold but wet weather in winter. November, December and January make up the rainy season, while July and August are the driest months. Autumn and Winter tend to have strong coastal winds, excellent for kite or wind-surfing, as well as for sailing.
Of later times, the primeiro banho do ano or the first sea dip of the year, has become an annual local tradition in the early hours of every New Year's Day with hundreds of participants vying for the T-shirt given to confirm the feat.

And also by the main canal in Rua do Clube dos Galitos near the moliceiro embarking jetty by the Rotunda das Pontes. If confused,  just go inside any business near the railway station and ask, Onde é a estação dos autocarros regionais? ("Where's the regional bus station?")

By plane[edit]

The "Aeródromo Municipal de Aveiro" is actually the former military airbase of São Jacinto, and is planned revert to civilian use, pending certification. As of May 2018, this has not happened yet, because of bureaucratic minutiae. Its 1,372-metre runway and buildings serve private pilots and house small aircraft and the Aveiro Aeroclube.

Get around[edit]
On foot[edit]
Aveiro is easily navigable on foot. The local bus terminal can be found about 15 minutes walk from the canal zone.

By bicycle[edit]
Aveiro is a cyclist friendly city. There are many exclusive cyclist dedicated paths throughout the city and connecting  all the way from the city to the beach areas.
A very convenient way to see Aveiro if you like to go cycling but don't have a bicycle, is to use the BUGA (Free-use Bicycles of Aveiro) service.  There are 2 BUGA shops (lojas) spread about the city. If there are bicycles available, you simply have to give to the BUGA shop employee your ID and you'll have a bike to take a free ride.
Bikes can be used within a certain BUGA area of the city, delimited by signs. When you are finished with the bike, just return it to the shop (loja) and take your ID back. You have until 19:00 to return your bike to the BUGA shop you took it from, nice, free and easy!

By bus[edit]

The city of Aveiro has thirteen bus lines operated by Aveiro Bus, who have no English website. That said, the buses are of little use to tourists as most points of interest are easily within walking distance in Aveiro. However, if you plan to spend your summer holidays in the area and only find accommodation in Aveiro city, it may be worthwhile getting a multi-trip or seasonal bus pass to get to the beaches at a low cost. Transdev Portugal operates longer-distance services. Of note are especially the lines that go from Aveiro to the beaches, including Barra and Costa Nova.

By car[edit]
Road traffic in the Aveiro area is relatively easy to negotiate, though you may experience slight delays at rush hours. Street parking spaces are at a premium and metered, but there are some well positioned underground parkades at the Forum and Av. Lourenço Peixinho near the Great War Combatants Monument. Generally, access to major national roads is well signposted, but outside the city limits, driving on municipal/local roads may require a map. In the summer, beach traffic can grind things to a near standstill.
Aveiro has several car rental agencies. The best policy is to prearrange everything via internet before arrival, including insurance, as this will save you a lot of money.

As salt production for many centuries played such a big part in the importance of Aveiro in pre industrial times, it's quite surprising today, to still see remnants of that manual labour activity. As one leaves the city to join the freeway towards Barra and Costa, stay on the right hand side local road that runs roughly parallel with the canal and travel some 300 m alongside the canal and the remaining "salinas" come into view. Sometimes, depending on the season, one can see how the salt water is trapped in the rectangular basins for saturation and evaporation. Later on, it is harvested and made into conical mounds. Locally produced salt is sold at certain shops. There is the "Flor de sal", in the purest form, and the cheaper "sal de Aveiro". (updated Apr 2021)

The best kept secrets are the extensive soft sand beaches that reach from Mira in the south to Espinho in the north, coupled with the less costly accommodation and food when compared with further south Portugal and the Algarve, this unique environment tucked between the Ria and the Atlantic has well kept amenities to do water sports, sunbathe, swim, enjoy fresh fish, and seafood meals, bicycle or stroll along and watch wonderful summer sunsets from Costa Nova and Praia da Barra with its imposing lighthouse dominating the horizon or take the ferry boat across the Ria to explore the São Jacinto dunes and Torreira beach town.
Further inland, one can also enjoy a short trips to local towns and villages that have quite a bit to offer in terms of authentic local gastronomy and sightseeing outside the usual "tourist trap" offerings in major centers. Go to Angeja, to savour their special enguias (eel dishes) or rojões (tender and lean pork chunky cutlets), or Anadia among others and Bairrada, with their wines and leitāo assado (roasted piglet). These trips can also be done by using several regional bus services based not too far from Aveiro railway station.
