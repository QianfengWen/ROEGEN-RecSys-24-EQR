Nelson's Baker Street
Heritage building along Baker Street

Understand[edit]
The West Kootenay region is part of the traditional territories of the Sinixt (or Lakes) and Ktunaxa (Kutenai) peoples.
Known as "The Queen City", it is acknowledged for its impressive collection of restored heritage buildings from its glory days in a regional silver rush.
In 2012 Nelson and Rossland, a small city south-west of Nelson, were jointly voted best ski locales in North America by readers of California-based Powder Magazine.

History[edit]
Gold and silver were found in the area in 1867. Following the discovery of silver at nearby Toad Mountain in 1886, the town boomed quickly, leading to incorporation in 1897. Two railways were built to pass through Nelson. Due to its location near transportation corridors, Nelson grew to supply the local mining activity and soon became a transportation and distribution centre for the region.
The town soon matured from a false-fronted boom town to a sophisticated city. Francis Rattenbury, an architect most noted in British Columbia for the Parliament Buildings in Victoria, the Vancouver Provincial Courthouse, and the second Hotel Vancouver, designed chateau-style civic buildings made of granite, which stand today. By the 1900s, Nelson had several fine hotels, a Hudson's Bay Company store, and an electric streetcar system. The local forestry and mining industries were well established.
The town built its own hydroelectric generating system. English immigrants planted lakeside orchards, and Doukhobors from Russia, sponsored by Leo Tolstoy and the Quakers, tilled the valley benchlands. The Doukhobor Museum is nearby, close to the neighbouring town of Castlegar.
During the Vietnam War, many American draft dodgers settled in Nelson and the surrounding area. This influx of liberal, mostly educated young people had a significant impact on the area's cultural and political demographics.

Nelson's mountainous geography kept growth confined to the narrow valley bottom, except for certain hillside structures such as the local High School and the former Notre Dame University College (NDU) campus. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, when more prosperous cities were tearing down and rebuilding their downtowns to the design of the time, Nelson merchants 'modernized' their buildings with covers of aluminum siding.

Baker Street[edit]
In the early 1980s, Nelson suffered a devastating economic downturn when the local sawmill was closed. To save downtown and Baker Street from blight, Nelson remodelled its downtown by stripping aluminum facades and restoring the buildings to their original brilliance. By 1985, Baker Street was completely transformed. Affirmation of the street's success came in 1986 when Steve Martin chose to produce his feature film Roxanne largely in Nelson, using the local fire hall as a primary set and many historic locations for others. More broadly, the transformation marked the beginning of Nelson's ongoing transition from a resource-based town to an arts and tourism town. A walk down Baker Street through the Historic District is now one of Nelson's promoted visitor activities.

Climate[edit]
Winters are cold and snowy while summers are warm and drier with cool temperatures during the night.

The downtown core of Nelson is very compact and walkable. The main streets stretch a few blocks up the hillside away from the lake, and along the contours of the hillside. You don't need a car to get between downtown businesses, but you might need one to get to housing away from the centre. It's a ten-minute uphill walk from the airport to the heart of downtown, though the Canadian Pacific Railway track just inland of the airport is a slight obstacle.
