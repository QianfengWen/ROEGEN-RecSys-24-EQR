Solo the short name for Surakarta, is a major city in Central Java. Together with Yogyakarta, these two great cultural centres are heirs of the Mataram kingdom that was split in 1755. Both centres are good bases for trips to nearby UNESCO World Heritage sites like the temple complexes of Borobudur and Prambanan.


Understand[edit]
Solo lies some 100 km (62 mi) south of Semarang and some 60 km (37 mi) east of Yogyakarta. As the 'twin' brother of Yogyakarta, this city looks much like the latter. But because Solo is not a provincial capital, this city has preserved much of its Javanese character. This also means that Solo is less touristy than Yogyakarta. The town is a centre of art and education and offers some good shopping. It is said to be the least westernised city in Central Java.
The formal name for the city is Surakarta. Less formal but widely used is Solo. From time to time you may see it written as Sala. This is because of a pronunciation quirk in Javanese that means final and penultimate -a are pronounced -o as in hot.

History[edit]
Historically, the Kasunanan Kingdom was the true heir of the Mataram Sultanate which ruled all of Java from the 16th century to the late 17th century. In 1745 the Sultanate moved its court to Solo. However, by the end of the 18th century it suffered from internal court intrigues, rebellions and foreign manipulation by the Dutch East India Company (VOC). In 1755 the Sultanate split, with the Kasunanan Kingdom ruled by the reigning sovereign (Pakubuwono II) based in Solo and the Yogyakarta Sultanate, led by the rebel prince Mangkubumi (later Sultan Hamengkubuwono I), in Yogyakarta. In 1757, another rebel prince, Raden Mas Said, formed the Mangkunegaran Principality, motivated by disappointment with the king, who had collaborated with the VOC. During the following Dutch colonial rule the kingdoms, called Vorstenlanden (Land of the Princes) in Dutch, enjoyed a certain degree of autonomy and were recognized as vassal states of the Dutch empire.
Like Yogyakarta, Solo is one of the few Indonesian cities that is still ruled by a traditional monarch, in this case known as the Susuhunan. The current Susuhunan of Solo is Pakubuwono XIII, who has reigned since 2004.

Culture[edit]
Wayang puppet or shadow puppet
Solo is a centre of Central Javanese culture, notable for performances of wayang kulit (shadow puppet plays) and wayang wong (tales from the Ramayana and Mahabharata epics performed by actors on stage), accompanied by the traditional gamelan orchestra.

Population[edit]
Today's Solo is a bustling economic centre of around 550,000 people, with 800,000 including suburbs.

Climate[edit]
The weather in July and August is hot and humid, with temperatures up to 33 °C (91 °F). Humidity levels are normally between 75% and 100%.

Drink[edit]
Dawet: coconut milk, palm sugar and little green jelly things
Because of Islamic dietary laws, most eating places do not offer alcohol, and only few licensed hotels and restaurants will offer national and international brands of beer and wines. Solo's local alcohol is called ciu, a local adaptation of Chinese wine, made from rice. Drink it at your own risk.
The folks of Solo love sweet drinks combining natural fruits with coconut water or coconut milk, and palm sugar. Dawet (known as cendol in West Java and Jakarta) adds little green jelly worms into the mix. Usually served with ice.
Gempol plered is made from coconut milk with rice flour balls, with a sweet and slightly salty taste.

Prambanan temple complex is the largest Hindu temple complex in Indonesia. It lies 50km to the west, just before entering Yogyakarta.
Yogyakarta (old spelling: Jogjakarta) is a more tourist city located close to Solo. The easiest is by car, or charter a taxi (approx. 90 - 120 min) depending on traffic. Taking the train can also be an option, the KRL commuter train leaves frequently during the day (usually catering for the commuter workers) from Solo Balapan and Purwosari Station. The ticket costs Rp 8,000 one way. The train ride is about one and half hour with around 10 stops in between Solo-Jogja, including to Prambanan. The last stop will be in Tugu Station in Yogyakarta right on the northwestern side of Malioboro.
Borobudur Temple Compounds is a series of three Buddhist temples, most famous of them is Borobudur Temple, which is a 9th-century Mahayana Buddhist monument comprises six square platforms topped by three circular platforms and is decorated with 2,672 relief panels and 504 Buddha statues. The main dome, located at the center of the top platform, is surrounded by 72 Buddha statues seated inside perforated stupa. A particularly scenic route would be to travel through the Selo and Ketep Pass in Boyolali, located between Mount Merapi and Mount Merbabu with breathtaking views of both mountains and directly to Magelang, without going through Yogya. The whole journey should take around 1 hour and 30 minutes to 2 hours with a rented or private car.
