Auburndale is a town in Polk County, Florida.


Understand[edit]
The town, which had a population of 16,700 in 2019, was founded in 1880. Founder Frank Fuller left the Northeast in search of a part of the country with a warmer climate. A railroad was built in the town during the 1880s. Settlers from Auburndale, Massachusetts decided upon the name, which comes from Oliver Goldsmith's poem "The Deserted Village," and the new town became popular with artists.
