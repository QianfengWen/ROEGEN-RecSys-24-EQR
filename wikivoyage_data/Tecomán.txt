In Colima's state capital, there are two bus stations which have direct service to Tecoman.

Buses run throughout the day, pretty much constantly and there's also some night service.
Traveling by bus from the Manzanillo central bus station to Tecoman doesn't take much longer than from Colima city. The road from Manzanillo to Tecomán will pass by the Manzanillo power plant and buses will sometimes make a quick stop in Armeria which is a small town near the city of Tecomán.

Get around[edit]
Taxis are very reasonably priced and you can jot around town easily by foot or by taxi. Write down the main dispatching station phone number because it can be sometimes hard to flag a taxi from the more remote areas of the city. Flagging a taxi near the center of town is pretty easy, except during special events, holidays or late at night. There are also collectives and local buses which make getting over to the outskirts or the suburbs, called colonias in Spanish, quite inexpensive. But taking a local bus to somewhere nearby will often take a lot longer than a collective, a taxi or sometimes by simply walking. The center of town has roads that go out in all directions and getting around by car is also pretty easy. Getting around by bicycle can be more difficult because of the many cobblestone roads and vehicle traffic.
The urban transport of Tecomán is managed through the Urban and Suburban Transport Service of Tecomán (SUSTUS). The characteristic buses connect the different neighborhoods and neighborhoods of the city.
