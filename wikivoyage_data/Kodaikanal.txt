The Kurinji plant
In Tamil, Kodaikanal means "seen in summer".
Kodaikanal is also referred to as "Princess of Hill stations."
Kodaikanal relies upon agriculture and tourism as the two major parts of its local economy.
Unique to the Western Ghats, the Kurinji Flower is in full bloom around December once in 12 years, and it bathes the valley in a beautiful sea of blue. The name Nilgiri (blue mountains) was derived from the blue colour. It was last in full bloom in 2018.

Lakes[edit]
10.2343677.486331 Kodai Lake (Kodaikanal Lake). If you are going in winter, go boating in the evening, as it's an amazing experience to boat through fog settling on the lake. The lake is very near the bus stand. This is a star-shaped lake and walking around it during the night is one of the best walking experiences you can have in your life. Be cautious, there are lot of dogs around this lake and some places are extremely dark. Walk between 6 and 7PM, then head back to your room. 
10.18414477.3959592 Berijam Lake. Perhaps the most pristine of the three lakes in Kodai. This is a plastic free zone and it is beautiful and serene. The lake lies within a reserved forest region. You must get permission to visit this lake. Permissions need to be obtained on the morning of the intended day of visit from the forest office. Usually the person who arranges the vehicle will arrange the permit. Moreover, in peak season, a limited number of vehicles are allowed in per day. 
Water Falls[edit]
10.2401577.478083 Bear Shola falls. This is a really beautiful water falls. But during some seasons there may not be any water there. But climbing up the falls is a good trek. 
10.2420177.510684 Silver Cascade. It's a nice waterfall on the road side from Kodai Road, just before 4-5 km from Kodaikanal. The cold water flows and it's really super to bathe in the cold water and travel in between the eucalyptus trees. If you are going to Kodaikanal by private vehicle on the way, you can visit the place. Buy fresh carrots and some exotic veggies around here.

Caves[edit]
 Devil's Kitchen. A cave known more to the locals, First being "Green Valley View" and "Pillar Rocks" and then finally "Guna Cave". Watch out for the deep hidden ravines. What would appear like mere dark gutters are actually a deep fall. Many unsuspecting people have fallen prey to the "devil's trap", so watch your step! 
10.2107477.461957 Guna Caves. A cave which became very famous after the movie Guna. Very steep and risky to get in. The public may not be allowed to enter this cave nowadays, though it's a very good place to take pics. But if you are not a professional spelunker, a trip to this cave may be your last. Getting back will be problem as it's very dark and there could be about a 90% chance of suffering a free fall. 
Places of worship[edit]
Churches[edit]

You can get a view of the Palani Hills and the Kodaikanal Town from this temple. During the winter, the view of Kodai city and Palani from the two ends of the temple is blocked.

10.2300477.4936411 Coakers Walk. If you wish to catch the scenic valleys, the best time to visit the place would be before 2PM.

At evenings a view of the Jewel Box (evening view of Theni and Periyakulam)is also an attraction. A marvel. Also try out the telescope near the main gate. This place is very near the bus stand.

 Green Valley View (Suicide Point). It has a more than 5,000 ft (1,500 m) steep drop from this point. The monkeys are a good attraction at this point. Renamed Green Valley View, apparently to prevent people from being lured to commit suicide. 
 Old Suicide Point. This place is about 5 minutes before the main/old pine forest. An entire stretch is full of pine trees while driving from the observatory side. You must walk towards the cliff. Here you will see a small pathway on the left side. If you take this path and walk for about 10 minutes you will reach the old suicide point. The view from there is simply breathtaking. 
10.2103977.4653613 Pillar Rocks. It has huge steep cliffs. During summer rainy days, the cliffs get completely hidden due to excess of fog. Watch out for the cross at the top of the mountain hoisted by an English adventure enthusiast.You can see the cross by an available telescope.
