History[edit]
Boischatel was incorporated in 1920 from part of the territory of L'Ange-Gardien. The beginning of the colonization of this area began around 1664. Its territory corresponds to the stronghold of Charleville. Agriculture used to be the main economic activity, with about twenty farms. Then its economy diversified in the 19th century thanks to its hydraulic power: notably the Patterson saw and the Dominion Textile spinning mill. Then came the development of a hydroelectric power station at Montmorency Falls. At the start of the 20th century, the Montmorency-Charlevoix railway served as rail transport with the industries of Sault-Montmorency and the city of Quebec.
Before November 23, 1991, this municipality was designated "Saint-Jean-de-Boischatel".

Geography[edit]
The municipal territory includes plateaus arranged in stairs and sandy valleys between the Laurentians to the north and the St. Lawrence River. Montmorency Falls is located partly in Boischatel.
The heart of the municipal territory is the Royal Quebec Golf Club. The municipal territory is generally wooded.
