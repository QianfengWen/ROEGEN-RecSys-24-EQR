For other places with the same name, see Bellevue (disambiguation).

Bellevue is a city in the Puget Sound region of Washington state, and often considered a satellite or suburb of Seattle. Bellevue had a population of 150,000 in 2021.
Bellevue is perhaps the most ritzy district of the Seattle metro area, mainly due to the presence of Microsoft at nearby Redmond and other tech companies occupying the downtown office towers. It also results in neighborhoods mostly comprising families or retirees with large houses and excellent vistas of the water for the lucky few; which reflects on many of the family-friendly attractions especially parks. It is generally considered more pleasant and safer to walk here than in Seattle proper. On the flip side however, the experience is somewhat blander than the latter due to a lower variety of sightseeing options, although the shopping experience is said to be better here.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The nearest airport is Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. To get to Bellevue, take eastbound State Route 518 and continue straight towards Interstate 405.

By train[edit]
Amtrak provides service to Seattle's King Street Station. To get to Bellevue, take Sound Transit Express bus route 550 (see #By bus), which stops just around the corner from the station, on 4th Avenue South.
The Link Light Rail from Seattle is being extended into Bellevue, but completion is not expected until 2025.

By car[edit]
 State Route (SR) 520[dead link] connects Bellevue to Seattle, via the Evergreen Point floating bridge on Lake Washington. The bridge is tolled, hence less busier than Interstate 90. SR-520 serves as the northern border between Bellevue and Kirkland between the shores of Lake Washington and Interstate 405.
The more modern and capacious   Interstate 90 (I-90) provides another route from Seattle across Lake Washington, via Mercer Island. For Bellevue, exit to Bellevue Way SE or Interstate 405.
 Interstate 405 (I-405) is the outer loop of Interstate 5 that runs from Lynnwood to Tukwila (and the airport), through Bellevue. Rush hour traffic can be very daunting: expect a 45-minute to 1-hour drive from each end of the freeway to Bellevue.
