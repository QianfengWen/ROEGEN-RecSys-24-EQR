Understand[edit]
Pincher Creek as seen from the North, with the rockies in the background.
The town received its name in 1868 when a group of prospectors lost a pincer in the small creek at this location. These pincers would have been used as a mechanism for trimming the feet of the horses and thus had some value to the group. In 1874, the North-West Mounted Police came to southern Alberta. One of them discovered the rusting tools in the creek, and they named the area Pincher Creek. In 1898, Pincher Creek was incorporated a village. In 1906, the community was incorporated as a town and named Pincher Creek.
