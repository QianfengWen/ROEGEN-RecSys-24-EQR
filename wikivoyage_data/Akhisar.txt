Akhisar is a city in the Central Aegean region of Turkey. The city and district had a population of 174,850 in 2020. The only visitor attraction is the ruins of ancient Thyatira and adjacent museum. 


Understand[edit]
Tepemezarı
"Thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication . . "
- in Revelation 2:18-29, St John of Patmos threatens that Jezebel and all who commit adultery with her in Thyatira shall be cast into a bed together.
- and if that prospect doesn't terrify them, her children will be killed, by guess what? By death!
Earlier cities on this site were called Pelopia and Semiramis. The name Thyatira (Θυάτειρα) came about in 290 BC, and perhaps meant "daughter". The town was on the border between Lydia and Mysia; from the 1st century AD it was part of the Roman Empire and notable for its dyeing trade. It was around 95 AD that St John of Patmos wrote to the "seven churches of Asia", all in what's become the Aegean region of Turkey, variously castigating or extolling their deeds. 
The town is in fertile agricultural land and is on the historic route between Constantinople (Istanbul) and Smyrna (Izmir). Thyatira was wrecked several times by warring armies but by 1307 was under Ottoman control. The last upheavals were around the turn of the 19th/20th century: its Armenian community suffered a massacre in 1895, and again at the end of the war of 1919-1922, when the town was back and forth between Greece and Turkey. There were also regular earthquakes. This means that Akhisar, as it became after independence, is modern, with businesses mostly based on agriculture. Its antiquities have been built over, except for the small area known as Tepemezarı, but you might find old columns or gateways here and there in the modern streets.
