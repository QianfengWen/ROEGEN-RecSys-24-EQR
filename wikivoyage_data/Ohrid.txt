Ohrid [formerly dead link]  (Macedonian: Охрид) is a town in southwestern North Macedonia on the shore of Lake Ohrid. A town of vast history and heritage, it was made a UNESCO heritage site in 1980. Nestled between high mountains up to 2,800 m and Lake Ohrid, it is not only a place of historic significance but also of outstanding natural beauty. Ohrid is the jewel in North Macedonia's crown.


Understand[edit]
Ohrid and Lake Ohrid
Archaeological finds indicate that Ohrid is one of the oldest human settlements in all of Europe. The lake itself is over three million years old. Ohrid town is first mentioned in Greek documents from 353 BCE, when it was known as Lychnidos - or, “the city of light.” Only much later, in 879 CE, was it renamed Ohrid. The name probably derives from the phrase “vo hridi” – meaning roughly, “in the cliff.” It comes from the time when the town was limited in a small area on the lake side of the hill, which in fact is a huge cliff rising above the lakeshore. The town as we know it today was built mostly between the 7th and 19th centuries. During the Byzantine period, Ohrid became a significant cultural and economic centre, serving as an episcopal centre of the Orthodox Church and as the site of the first Slavic university run by Saints Clement and Naum at the end of the 9th century. At the beginning of the 11th century, Ohrid briefly became the capital of the kingdom ruled by Tsar Samuel, whose fortress still presides over the city today.

See[edit]
Looking toward the town from the fortress
Aside from the lake, Ohrid is most famous for its ancient churches, basilicas, and monasteries where Saints Kliment and Naum with the help of Bulgarian king Boris I (students of Cyril and Methodus) wrote their teachings and formulated the Cyrillic alphabet used in North Macedonia, as well as neighboring countries Bulgaria, Serbia and Montenegro and as far as Russia, and many of the countries of the former Soviet Union. Most of these churches charge an entry which for tourists is normally double that what locals pay, but is still worth it. It is a good idea to cover up when entering a church, but most locals will understand the inconveniences involved during a hot Macedonian Summer. There is also a wonderful ancient walled fortress at the top of the city.

Fortifications[edit]
The old town is circled with walls, which are crowned with Tsar Samuel fortress. The first fortifications were built in the 5th century BC, but the oldest remains preserved are from 3rd century BC. The fortifications were reinforced various times throughout history and what stands today is largely from the 10th century. There used to be four gates to the city: the Lower Gate - you'll reach it soon after you walk from the main square inside the old part of the town on “Car Samoil” street. It used to be the gate through which regular visitors entered the city in the ancient and medieval times, just one tower of it still stands; the Upper Gate - in ancient times it used to be connected with the ancient theatre by portico. It is well preserved due to the reinforcements made in the 16th century; the Front Gate - near St Mary's Celnica Church. It is the main entrance gate but just stands in traces today; and the Water Gate - the entrance in the city from the lake, the place where it used to stand is not known.

The Church of St Sofia, front facade
41.11520.7911 Tsar Samuel's Fortress (Самуилова тврдина). The fortress sits like a crown above the old town. It was built in the 10th century when Ohrid was capital of the First Bulgarian Empire by Tsar Samuel, though it was likely built upon foundations of an older fortification dating to the 4th century BC. With its positioning at the top of the Ohrid hill, it provides expansive views of the town, the lake, and the mountains. 30 denars.   
Major churches[edit]
41.11208920.7941142 Church of Saint Sofia (Црква „Св. Софија“), ☏ +389 46 267 403. Dating to the 9th century, Saint Sofia is a cathedral church of the Ohrid Archbishopric. The present church was built during the period from 1035 to 1056. The front façade with the towers and the open galleries was built in 1317 under Archbishop Gregory. The side porch was added when the church was turned into a mosque by the Turks. The interior contains a significant collection of preserved 11th century frescoes. The main altar has scenes from the Old Testament and an emotional procession of angels bowing to the Virgin Mary. The side altars have frescoes of the 40 martyrs and portraits of Patriarchs from Constantinople, Jerusalem and Antioch, archbishops from Ohrid and Roman Popes. The small square in front of it was the main forum in ancient times and is still used for various cultural performances today. 100 denars.   
The Church of Saint Mary Perivleptos
41.11417520.7954993 Church of Saint Mary Perivleptos (Црква „Пресвета Богородица Перивлептос“). This church was built and painted in 1295. It is dedicated to the Virgin Mary; "Perivleptos" (from the Greek Περίβλεπτος) is an attribute given to her meaning "the Omniscient and Clairvoyant." The benefactor in its construction was the son-in-law of Byzantine Emperor Andronicus II. The church was painted by Michael and Eutychius, two young painters. Their work shows that styles later adopted in the Renaissance were already current in Byzantine art long before Gioto. The frescoes they painted have all the elements of Renaissance art except perspective. Important frescoes include, on the eastern wall, the detailed portraits of Saint Clement and Constantine Kavasila (former Archbishop of Ohrid) and the Lamentation of Christ painted with much emotions. On the western wall, in the Prayer on the Olive Mountain as the apostles are sleeping, take a look at their dress and how well the artists worked with color and showed the roundness of the bodies. On the northern wall, in the Death of the Virgin Mary, in order to present the holiness of the moment, there is a group of angels coming from the gates of the sky to take her soul, above her stands Jesus holding her soul. The figures are not presented the traditional Byzantine way, skinny, and emotionless. The painters were also the first Byzantine artists to sign their work (on 20 hidden locations, look on the front columns at the sword and the cloth of two holy warriors). 100 denars. 
There are three small 14th/15th century churches situated next to Saint Mary Perivleptos:
41.11394820.7962174 Church of Saints Constantine and Elena (Црква „Св. Константин и Елена“). Built in 1477, this church sits just southeast of Saint Mary Perivleptos. It is a small church with a single nave. The whole interior is painted with frescoes. 
41.11431220.7951345 Church of Saint Demetrius (Црква „Св. Димитриј“). Just east of Saint Mary Perivleptos is this 14th century church, dedicated to Saint Demetrius. The three-nave church has high quality frescoes. (updated Dec 2016)
41.11361920.7966446 Church of Saints Cosmas and Damian (Црква „Св. Кузман и Дамјан“). Further southeast of Saints Constantine and Elena, is this small church, also built in the 14th century. It has great frescoes, including one which is depicted on the 1,000-denar banknote. It also has a wooden iconostasis. (updated Dec 2016)
The Church of Saint John at Kaneo, overlooking the lake
41.11108620.7886587 Church of Saint John at Kaneo (Црква „Св. Јован Канео“), ☏ +389 46 230 455. This 14th century church is best known for its scenic location, standing on a cliff above Lake Ohrid, likely making it the most photographed of the town's churches. Notable about its architecture is the Armenian influence with the zigzag line of the roof of the dome. There are only a few original frescoes left inside the small church. A popular beach is situated just below the church. 100 denars.   (updated Sep 2023)
The Church of Saint Pantaleon
41.11222220.7908338 Church of Saints Clement and Pantaleon (Црква „Св. Климент и Пантелејмон“). Situated on the wider archaeological site of Plaošnik, the site has been an important religious centre since early Christian times, if not before. It is the site of the first university in Europe, opened in the 10th century and is the place where the Cyrillic alphabet was created. The church you see is largely a reconstruction of the church Saint Clement built when he came here and opened the university. The original portions of the church are easily distinguished from the reconstructed portions. Inside, some original tunnels are visible via plexiglass. When Saint Clement established the church, just the small round chapel that today serves as the altar existed. Because of the large influx of worshipers that followed him, he enlarged the church by building the central part and turning the existing church into an altar chapel. He dedicated the church to Saint Pantaleon (also spelled Panteleimon), the protector of health. The closed porch and the bell tower were added later in the 13th century. Before St. Clement died, he dug his own grave inside the church. During early Ottoman rule, the Turks tore the church down after a rebellion. It still attracted a large number of worshipers and pilgrims, so they built a mosque above it which stands only in ruins today.   (updated Sep 2023)
41.14191220.7615059 Early Christian church. Sitting on Plaošnik next to St Pantaleon is a church in ruins, built in the 5th century. It is important as an architectural solution since it has a four-leaf shape. Central solutions like this were built in Syria and Mesopotamia and they became customary much later in Europe, in the 10th century. It shows that Ohrid had great ties with the early Christian centres and that there was an exchange of artists and minds. It has a three-leaf shape on the outside and four-leaf on the inside, and it had a large dome in the centre (notice the 4 huge basis of columns). There is also a small baptistry to the right with a four-leafed shape with some excellent mosaics. (updated Sep 2023)
Other churches[edit]
The Church of Saint Nicholas Bolnički
41.11216220.79750210 Church Saint Nicholas Bolnički & Church of Saint Mary Bolnička (Црква „Св. Никола Болнички“ и Црква „Св. Богородица Болничка“). These two small neighbouring churches were built in the 14th century with dormitories around them which were used as quarantine stations for visitors of the city. After the coming of the Turks, they were turned into hospitals. That is where the name "Bolnički" comes from (bolnica means hospital). Saint Nicholas Bolnički was built in 1313. The small addition on the roof was influenced by Adriatic architecture and it imitates the bell-towers of the churches on the Adriatic coast. The frescoes are in decent condition and include interesting portraits of some royals, of Saint Nicholas and of an Ohrid archbishop. Look for the fresco of God’s hand protecting the pure souls inside a tiny window. Saint Mary Bolnička's frescoes are in poorer condition. Even though the church is tiny there is a transverse vault, so the roof is in the shape of a cross. 50 denars. 
41.11260320.79684611 Church of Saint Clement of Ohrid (Црква „Св. Климент Охридски“). This small, well-hidden church, built in the 14th century, is just a few steps away from the Bolnički churches, in the heart of the old town. The church is historically important since it is here that the bones of St. Clement were hidden after the Turks took the city and converted Saint Pantaleon to a mosque. It also has well-preserved frescoes. The church is locked; ask around the neighbouring houses for the key. Free. 
41.11333320.79722212 Church of the Holy Mother of God - Čelnica (Црква „Св. Богородица Челница“). This 14th-century church in the old town is notable for being perhaps the only two-nave church in the country. Its oldest frescoes date from the 14th century, but the church was mostly repainted in the 19th century by notable artists from the Debar area. (updated Aug 2019)
41.11229520.79484513 Church of Saint Nicholas Gerakomija (Црква „Св. Никола Геракомија“). Built of stone and limestone, this church was completed in 1860. While still not completely painted on the interior, the existing frescoes were done by noted artist Dičo Krstev. (updated Dec 2016)
41.11614820.79925114 Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary (Црква „Успение на Пресвета Богородица“). This church, dating to the 17th century, sits just above the main shopping street of the Old Bazaar in the centre of town. Most of the present structure was built in 1832. It has a single dome and contains impressive frescoes. The town's small 16th-century clock tower is nearby. (updated Dec 2016)
41.14516720.76666715 Church of Saint Erasmus (Црква „Св. Еразмо“), on main highway NE of central Ohrid. A cave church and ancient Christian basilica right off the A3 highway to Struga. Archaeological excavations suggest the oldest portions of the site date from the 8th century.   (updated Jun 2019)
41.10985420.80760716 Church of Saint Nicholas (Црква „Св. Никола“). The Church of Saint Nicholas is in the newer part of town on Partizanska Street, one block north of the lake. It was built in 1863 and has been expanded over the years. (updated Dec 2016)
41.117520.81333317 Church of Saint George (Црква „Св. Георгиј“), Pitu Guli. In Ohrid's upper neighborhoods is this 1834-built church. Some of its frescoes date from this period, while its bell tower was built in 1950. (updated Jul 2019)
41.11362520.79387218 Church of Saint Barbara (Црква „Св. Варвара“). This small church was built in 1965 but looks like it was built centuries ago. 
Old Bazaar[edit]
Square in the Old Bazaar
Ohrid was a major religious and cultural centre but not really an important trade centre, which left it with a relatively small bazaar. It is a simple bazaar consisting of mainly one street, Saint Clement of Ohrid Street, which gets packed with tourists in summer evenings. It is lined with shops, cafes, and restaurants. The bazaar starts with the market at the northern end, followed by a square with a 1,000-year-old tree and a fountain. Walking down the bazaar, on the left are a couple of stone stores, which is the best-preserved section of stores in the bazaar. The bazaar ends with the main square named after Saint Clement of Ohrid which faces the port and lake. There are a few statues in this square.

41.11552220.80052819 Ali Pasha Mosque (Џамија Али Паша) (On the main pedestrian street of the Old Bazaar.). While Ohrid is known for its churches, it also has mosques, including this one from the Ottoman era. Located on the main pedestrian street of the Old Bazaar, the mosque was built in the 15th century. It has a rather simple design with one large dome and three smaller ones above the porch. It originally had at least one minaret but no longer has one. Reconstruction of the minaret, paid for by the Turkish government, was started in 2018 but drew protest. Nonetheless, it was completed and the renovated mosque now sits fully illuminated at night.  (updated Jul 2019)
41.11649720.79994720 Zeynel Pasha Tekje (Зејнел паша-теќе) (North of the square with the 1,000-year-old tree.). A tekje is a place of spiritual retreat in the Bektashi Order, a type of Sufi Islam. Dating from 1590, the tekje is situated north of the square with the 1,000-year-old tree. It belonged to the Halvet dervish order. The building is square in shape with one minaret. The mausoleum of Muhammad Hayati, who was the founder of this dervish order, can be found in the yard of the complex. The tekje was renovated with Turkish funding in 2012. (updated Sep 2023)
Traditional residential architecture[edit]
The Robev family house
When the Turks came they settled on the flat land along the lake and that became the Muslim part of town and the part on the hills inside the walls was always the Christian part, with the bazaar as a meeting place. As the city grew and the Christians were not allowed to build outside the walls, Ohrid developed very specific architecture with tight narrow streets and tunnels (houses built over the streets). The houses had tiny yards usually enclosed in the ground floor, and the houses grew over the streets on the upper floors since the locations were small. The steep terrain enabled everybody to have a good view of the lake and because of the strong sun the houses were painted white, so they would reflect the sun. Because of the winds from the lake, the houses in Ohrid don't have the open spaces that traditional houses in other towns in North Macedonia have.
Interesting houses can be seen all over the old town, but the best examples are along Car Samoil and Ilindenska streets. Robevci & Uranija houses are the two best examples of traditional architecture. They are houses of very rich families (normally the houses were not this big). Especially rich in terms of architecture is Uranija house, with entrances on different levels and inside galleries. They have been turned into museums today. If you don’t have time, visit just Uranija, which is free, though the top level of Robevci has great views, nice wood carvings, and some furniture (100 denars entrance). The house next to St. Gerakomija church is one of the few traditional houses that has been nicely and carefully preserved. It has been turned into a hotel now; Kanevce House On the right from the main façade of St. Sophia church, is the small house that belonged to Kanevce family. It has beautiful proportions and it is a good example of how they built on small locations.
A couple of these historic homes were the birthplaces of notable Macedonians and are preserved as museums:

41.112520.79277821 Prličev House (Прличева куќа). This house was built in the early 19th century and, in 1830, writer Grigor Prličev was born in it. It has served as a museum on the writer's life and work since 2000. (updated Aug 2019)
41.11222220.79580622 Uzunov House (Узунова куќа). Hristo Uzunov was born in this house in 1878. He would go on to be the leader of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization's Ohrid region until his suicide upon being surrounded by Ottoman forces in 1905 near Kičevo. This house was built in the mid-19th century and was owned by the Uzunov family until they left Ohrid in 1906.  (updated Aug 2019)
Other historic neighborhoods in the old town include:

 Mesokastro Settlement (Between the bazaar and the city walls.). Mesokastro is the quarter right above the old bazaar, between the bazaar and the city walls. The name originates from the Latin term “meco castrum”, which means the city outside the city walls, where the poor used to live. The term has survived since ancient times. The houses of Mesokastro have incorporated parts of the city walls and in some parts they are not visible. If you have time, walk around, since there are a couple of old houses still standing, and some of the streets offer great views over the lake. (updated Sep 2023)
 Kaneo Settlement. Start the walk to Kaneo from St. Sophia church. You can reach it from Plaoshnik but you would miss out on the great views and the quiet streets of Ohrid. Kaneo settlement was the quarter of the poor fishermen. This the most scenic spot of Ohrid, standing below the rock on which St. Jovan Kaneo church is situated. There is a small beach that is busy in the summer, and a couple of restaurants. (updated Sep 2023)
Other sites[edit]
The Ancient Theatre
41.11472820.79396923 Ancient Theatre (Антички амфитеатар). This is the only Hellenistic theatre remaining in North Macedonia, with the three other ancient theatres being from Roman times. Built in 200 BC, it was discovered by accident in the 1980s. It originally had an upper portion but only the lower portion is preserved. Today, it once again functions as a theatre, frequently used during Ohrid's Summer Festival. The theatre has a great open view of Lake Ohrid.   (updated Sep 2023)
41.1143120.7952324 Icon Gallery (Галерија на икони). Tu-Su 09:00-17:00.

The Bay of Bones Museum features a reconstructed Neolithic pile-dwelling settlement and fortress
The east coast is the most beautiful part of Lake Ohrid. From the town of Ohrid in the north, down to Saint Naum Monastery is considered the Macedonian Riviera. The country is landlocked, but you're certain to forget that when visiting this breathtaking area. It forms the western side of Galičica National Park. Below are notable places of interest along the coast, listed going south from Ohrid.

41.07372220.8042532 Church of Saint Stefan Pancir (Црква „Св. Стефан“ - Панцир), village of Šipokno. This 14th-century cave church sits below the village of Šipokno and above the lakefront hotels Sileks, Aura, and Aqualina. The church was built into the natural cave and its frescoes date from the 14th century, though heavily damaged. The elevated position of the cave church gives it nice views over the lake.

Peštani village – this once quiet fishing village has given up to tourism, with almost every house renting rooms and many restaurants and cafes. Desaret hotel has a good organized beach. If you don't like camping but like to enjoy the great beaches and parties in Gradishte you can stay here.
40.99420220.79825333 Bay of Bones Museum (Museum on Water; Музеј на вода „Залив на Коските“), between Peštani and Trpejca. In a small bay near the Gradište campground and beach, a Neolithic settlement has been reconstructed atop the water along with fortifications and a museum on land. The floating town contains reconstructed prehistoric homes with various objects inside them to help illustrate what life was like at this spot many years ago. Archaeological evidence suggests Lake Ohrid was once rich in these pile-dwelling settlements. Since opening in 2008, it has become one of Ohrid's most popular attractions. The site also features a scuba diving centre. The museum is easily accessed off the highway leading to Saint Naum and boats from Ohrid's port also make stops here.  (updated Jul 2019)
Trpejca village – due to the its setting between the rocks this small fishing village has managed to preserve its charm and escape the overgrow of tourism. It has a great long but narrow beach with the cleanest waters on the lake. It has couple of good small lakeside fish and barbecue restaurants and a bar on the left side of the beach. If you don't like the beach or it seems crowded take one of the small boats and ask to be taken to one of the isolated beaches around the village and enjoy the lake by yourself, the boat will come back for you at arranged time (50-100 denars).
40.94888920.77444434 Zaum Monastery (Заум (манастир)), village of Trpejca (accessible only by boat). Among Ohrid's most significant churches but not as well known due to its secluded location; the church can be reached only by boat from Trpejca or Ljubaništa villages. Ask around to find someone to take you. It was built on a stunning location among the rocks on a small beach in 1299, while its frescoes were completed in 1361. The church is dedicated to the Holy Mother of God and there is an interesting legend regarding the name and reason for the monastery's construction. As this spot is near the deepest area of Ohrid Lake, many had tried to determine the depth of the lake from here. One day, a woman of nobility tried to do the same when suddenly violent waves began to attack her, causing her to pray to God to save her while promising to build a monastery on the spot to be "for the mind" (Za Um) of her and all future visitors to not test the lake and attempt to record its depth. The architecture is exquisite, but the frescoes inside are very impressive, the most striking of which is that of Saint Anna breastfeeding the Holy Mother. Restoration work is regularly carried out. Some visitors bring tents and camp on the grounds for days, though dormitories have been rebuilt and can now be used for lodging. (updated Jul 2019)
Monastery of Saint Naum
40.91388920.740535 Monastery of Saint Naum (Свети Наум (манастир)), village of Ljubaništa (At the SE end of the MK side of the lake, accessible by boat, bus, car, ferry, and taxi)). One of the most beautiful monasteries in Macedonia and an important pilgrimage place, this monastery is a must-see when visiting Ohrid. Most visitors make this a half-day or full-day trip. With a breathtaking setting on a plateau over Ohrid Lake and Galičica mountain towering from behind, it was founded in the 905 by Saint Naum, but most of the present-day church was built in the 16th century. Of the original church, just the side chapel with the grave of Saint Naum still stands. In the side chamber, visitors typically get down on their knees and try to listen for the heartbeat of Saint Naum on his resting place. The frescoes were painted in 1806 (the side chapel frescoes depict the life and miracles of St. Naum); in the first chamber of the church look for the fresco of Saints Cyril and Methodius and their students including Saint Clement and Saint Naum. The icon screen was made in 1711 and it is the oldest completely preserved wooden high icon screen in the country. Around the monastery grounds look for the peacocks, including rare albino ones. Parts of the dormitories of the monastery have been turned into a guest lodging. Near the monastery is a chapel dedicated to Saint Petka with holy water and beside it are the springs of the Black Drim River. Next to the monastery, the river enters the lake. On both sides of the monastery there are pleasant sandy beaches, packed in summertime. At the entrance from the parking lot to the sprawling monastery grounds is a promenade with souvenir shops and restaurants.   (updated Jun 2019)
40.91122120.74538636 Black Drim Springs (Изворите на Црн Дрим). Immediately next to the monastery is the source of the Black Drim River. This river begins here, flows through the entire lake, and flows back out in Struga, ultimately flowing into Albania past Debar. The springs contain small two islands, one of which is home to a popular restaurant. Tour boats available for hire take visitors around the springs. (updated Jul 2019)
Galičica National Park provides breathtaking views of Lake Ohrid
Into the mountains[edit]
Much of Ohrid Municipality lies more inland from the lake. Villages dot the mountains surrounding Ohrid, home to traditional architecture and fantastic views.

41.08333320.82777837 Church of the Dormition of the Virgin Mary (Црква „Успение на Пресвета Богородица“), village of Velestovo. On the slopes of Galičica is this small 15th-century church. Its frescoes were painted between 1444 and 1451 in a style considered a typical example of church art during Ottoman rule. Its courtyard contains the village's cemetery. (updated Jun 2019)
41.16916720.83694438 Duvalo (Дувало), village of Kosel. One of the last traces of volcanic activity in this area, Duvalo is both a fumarole and a mofetta (emitting carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide). It is often incorrectly referred to as an actual volcano. The smell of sulfur is immediately evident upon entering the village, which sits on the way to Resen from Ohrid.   (updated Jun 2019)
Elšani village Elšani is the perfect place to relax and recharge. Just sitting on the terrace of a guesthouse, drinking a coffee and enjoying the view of the lake is an experience in itself, but when it's time to get up and stretch your legs, there is plenty to do. This village is a great place to enjoy walking in the mountain, and it's a perfect starting point for a number of hiking trails for all ages and skill levels. While any guesthouse can point guests in the right direction or even arrange a guide for longer hikes, trails on hikers can follow trails on either the north or south end of the village to the nearby villages Konjsko or Pestani. The windy, hilly streets of the village also provide an unforgettable place to explore.
Head further into Galičica National Park for hiking and wildlife viewing.

Beaches[edit]
Apart from sightseeing, there are a few different natural beaches. Usually, the further from the city centre the more scenic they become, and each offers a unique beach experience. Gradiste beach is known for many young people and music for instance, while others have families or tranquil atmosphere. Beaches are most crowded in July and August, and quiet the rest of the year, which is a whole different experience.

 Labino beach. It's a small, stony beach that is not crowded. The water is clear and refreshing. Best time to go is in the morning. 
 Ljubaništa beach (On the southwest side of the lake.). Probably the best beach on Ohrid Lake. The beach is long and sandy with usually clean water. There are a lot of people, but you can't feel that since the beach is really large. Best time to go is after 18:00. A sunset you won't forget. (updated Sep 2023)
 Gorica Hotel beach. This is maybe the most beautiful beach on the coast, it's covered with small pebbles and cut between deep rocks. Unfortunately it can get very crowded, so come here in early morning or late afternoon. If you visit Ohrid off-season this is the place to come and enjoy a great swim. There is a small cafe on the beach where one might also get some snacks and ice cream or rent beach beds. Walking along the coast from the city centre to this beach is scenic, even more past it, and takes about 1½ hr. The presidential Villa Ohrid, where the Balkan's Peace Framework was signed, is in the woods nearby. (updated Sep 2023)
Scuba diving[edit]
It is possible to scuba dive in lake Ohrid. You have to get to Gradiste, some 15 km south of Ohrid town. At the site is also Bay of Bones, an open air museum of how life used to be here. There is only one scuba diving shop (SSI affiliated), Amfora Diving[dead link], with the usual choice of courses and diving trips. One dive including rental of all equipment costs €45.

Events[edit]
 Ohrid Summer Festival, ☏ +389 46 261 304, contact@ohridskoleto.com.mk. The Ohrid Summer Festival is one of the largest and most important music and drama festivals in North Macedonia. The first concert took place in 1961 in the church of St. Sophia, with its exceptional acoustics. The festival in Ohrid has a particular international flavour because of the participation of a large number of leading musicians and ensembles from the best known European and world music centres. There have been participants from 44 countries. This Festival has a solid reputation as it has gradually become part of the large family of the most famous European music festivals. The Ohrid Summer Festival has its own sound conceptions, and it is able to draw up a musical program that includes artists of world renown. This festival is held each year from July 12 to August 20. (updated Sep 2023)
Ohrid Swimming Marathon - Each year, in the second half of July, the swimming elite throughout the world gathers in Ohrid and, starting from the monastery St. Naum, they swim along the Lakeshore to the town harbour, approximately a 30-km route. Since 1998 the Ohrid Swimming Marathon has entered in the World Swimming Club of the 12 worldwide held marathons under the patronage of FINA-The World Swimming Association.
The Balkan Folklore Festival - Member of the UNESCO Association of The International Council of Organizations of Folklore Festivals and Folklore Art, and The International Organization for Folklore Art.

 Ohrid Calling, Biljanini Izvori Stadium. This electronic dance music festival first began in the early 2010s and has grown each year, drawing some of the biggest names in the genre such as David Guetta, Afrojack, Martin Garrix, and others. It runs for a few days at Biljanini Izvori Stadium around the Ilinden national holiday (August 2). Promotional posters for the event can be seen throughout the country and tickets usually start around 1,000 denars. (updated May 2019)
Kostoski international festivals[1] - they have participants from all over the world, including folklore groups, majorettes, choirs, brass bands, and modern dance ensembles.
Buy[edit]
Traditional Macedonian musical instruments, filigree jewelery, woodcarvings, items made from copper, or a CD with authentic Macedonian music, can be brought home to refresh your memories of your visit.
If interested in real Macedonian folk music, ask for music performed by Aleksandar Sarievski, Nikola Badev, Vaska Ilieva, Petranka Kostadinova, Anka Gieva, Jonče Hristovski, Kočo Petrovski... Avoid CDs with modern-day "turbo folk" music (i.e. semi-naked girls with bad voices, singing on techno melodies).

The Talevi and Filevi are the two Ohrid families who make genuine Ohrid pearl necklaces, earrings and broaches; they carried over this handcraft down from one generation to another. Ohrid pearl is created from seashells and coated with 5-7 thin layers of emulsion made from the scales of the Ohrid fish called Plashitsa, and is protected with a Designation of Origin.
Books[edit]
Books from Ohrid to read on the beach or take home.
Some of the modern buys in this birthplace of Cyrillic literacy, include books from Happy Something Press, Ohrid's book publisher in English, founded by Macedonian born author and Oxford University student Evangelina Cifliganec [2] known for her contemporary novel "Happy Something". Its 2nd edition was published by the publisher's Ohrid branch, HappySomething.com, as the author was said to be inspired by Ohrid. You might find it easier online as the price of the English version there is higher and not always in stock.
A Passage through the Fog is a book that has been written in Ohrid by the Ohrid born writer and photographer Misho Yuzmeski. Dr. Michael Seraphinoff, in his Translator`s note on the book has written: "Misho Yuzmeski's novel invites the reader to join his young narrator on a journey of discovery through the heart of modern Europe. While this journey offers certain narrow insights into modern day city life in England and a few of the continent's major cities, it is the internal journey of the young traveler that is at the heart of this novel. Readers are liable to find parallels to some youthful search for meaning of their own in Michele's journey. He reminds us of a critical time in many of our lives, when childhood is finally behind us, but the road ahead is quite uncertain." A copy of the book can be found in all Ohrid's bookstores and there is no difference in price between different stores. Bulgarian translation of the same book is available, as well.
Short History of the Macedonian People by Risto Stefov was published in Ohrid in 2011. This book is a chronological outline of historical events involving Macedonia and the Macedonian people from ancient times to the present.
Numerous book stalls can be found (at least in good weather during the tourist season) in the square near Ohrid harbour. They sell a variety of maps useful for tourists as well.

Groceries[edit]
The downtown farmers' market has all kinds of fresh produce, as well as local specialties such as walnuts. There are cheese and sausage shops in the market as well, as well as numerous vendors of clothing and assorted industrial goods.

Bicycle supplies and service[edit]
There is at least one bike repair shop, which also sells common spare parts and supplies, next to the farmer's market. Some vendors in the market carry bicycle accessories (spare tubes, pumps, etc.) as well. This is pretty much the only place in the region to purchase stuff like this, since smaller towns around Lake Ohrid and Lake Prespa do not seem to have any bicycle related shops or services - and even gas stations there may not have air pumps.

Eat[edit]
Restaurants and hotels throughout North Macedonia are proudly displaying Ohrid trout (Ohridska pastrmka) on their menus because it is very delicious but it is illegal to catch the fish along the Macedonian shoreline of Lake Ohrid. Please do not support or encourage the consumption of the trout. Ohrid trout, an ancient living fish, is in severe danger. There is also another trout species called Belvica. Some popular restaurants in Ohrid known to most people in town simply by the name are:
Try these foods:

Ribna Čorba, a traditional fish soup served in most restaurants, mostly as a starter.
Burek, a layered pastry inherited from Ottoman times and popular for breakfast here. Choose with meat, cheese or spinach/cheese (arguably the best), and take a cup of traditional Macedonian yogurt. Modest looking place Burekđilnica Igor makes the best burek in town, Žito Leb's is also good.
Makalo, a starter spread made with garlic and yogurt.
Gjomleze, baked layered pancakes cut in a rhomboid shape, and usually served with white cheese.
Ohridski Gevrek, a traditional bakery product. You can buy it in Žito Leb'. Try it with yogurt or peach juice.

Stay safe[edit]
Ohrid Pearl is a type of imitation pearl (an artificial, man-made pearl) and as such has no real value as a gemstone. Most of the "pearls" sold around Lake Ohrid, on the street and in most shops, are simply unfinished imitation pearls (beads made of nacre, but without the pearly coating). Although selling shops have clear notes stating these are hand made ones.
