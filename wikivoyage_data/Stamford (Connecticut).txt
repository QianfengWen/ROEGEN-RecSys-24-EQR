Stamford, Connecticut is the fourth largest city in the state, a center of regional activity in Fairfield County, and a hub of the Metro New York area. Its position between NYC and the rest of Connecticut defines Stamford’s character. Stamford takes on a big-city atmosphere in its downtown and the adjacent neighborhoods, then transitions to a more traditional suburban small-town Connecticut atmosphere in its northern sections. Stamford plays an active role in the NYC metro and Fairfield County art and music scene. It also has one of the largest and most diverse selections of restaurants and shopping in Fairfield County. Many large corporations are headquartered in Stamford, so it hosts a large reverse-commute from New York City in addition to commuters from Connecticut and nearby Westchester County, New York.

Stay safe[edit]
Stamford Hospital's new building, completed in 2016, is one of numerous construction projects that have transformed the city's skyline this millennium
The FBI rates Stamford one of the safest cities in its population bracket. However caution must be used in some parts of Stamford, especially traveling past public housing projects. Walking the street is where you will encounter the most danger; avoid certain streets on the East Side (Custer Street, Ursula Place, Sections of Cove Road.), the West Side (Connecticut Avenue, Merrel Avenue, Spruce Street), as well as most of the Waterside (bordered by I-95 on the north, the Greenwich/Stamford border to the west and the Long Island Sound to the south and east; main avenue is Southfield Ave) and South End neighborhoods (The South End is bordered by I-95 to the north, and Long Island Sound to the east, west, and south; main avenue is Canal Street). Although Stamford is rapidly gentrifying, gangs and organized crime have long established roots in Stamford. Use the same caution as one would use in any city especially faced with a violent confrontation or when engaging in illicit activities. Stamford’s homeless population is not large but can be quite aggressive. Be careful of how you carry yourself; in Stamford a quick word might be more effective then simply ignoring a request. Avoid the McDonald's by the main library downtown, especially at night. It's been the site of muggings, fights and even a recent murder. There are plenty of other (safer) dining options in the area. Also Shippan has a lot of young hooligans roaming around at night. Some may get violent.

Go next[edit]
New York City- The primary reason for Stamford's development was its proximity to NYC. A 30-minute drive down I95 or the Merritt Parkway will take you to NYC. Also a 45-minute express train and a 75-minute local train will take you there and back for $30.50 peak and $23 off-peak; be sure to purchase tickets at the station, you will incur a 45% price increase when you purchase onboard. Free parking for the train station is provided at a commuter lot adjacent to I95 and there is slightly expensive pay parking lot directly across the street from the train station. Taking the train into Grand Central provides you access to the NYC transit system and you can use that to venture to any part of the city for $2.75 a trip.
Bridgeport- Bridgeport is a cheaper alternative to visiting New York City. Bridgeport is only roughly (depending on traffic) a 20-minute drive down I-95 or the Merritt Parkway and a 30-minute train ride. Home to the Beardsley Zoo, the Barnum Museum and a diverse restaurant scene. Also located in Bridgeport is a ferry running from downtown Bridgeport to Port Jefferson, New York, on Long Island's North Shore.
New Haven- About a 45-minute train ride away and a 30- to 45-minute drive north depending on traffic, New Haven is another popular destination. A lively downtown restaurant, bar and club scene makes it a good nightlife destination. Also home to multiple playhouses and musical venues.
