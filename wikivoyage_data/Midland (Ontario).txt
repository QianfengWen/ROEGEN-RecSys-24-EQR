Understand[edit]
Midland Public Library
Historically, Midland was an English-speaking community while neighbouring Penetanguishene had a large French-speaking population. The communities reflect the heritage of both founding peoples; Midland has a rich history dating back to the first settlers in Ontario, who came and lived among the Huron aboriginal people in the 1600s.

History[edit]
Sainte-Marie among the Hurons
As early as AD 800, the Huron settled in semi-permanent villages in the area. The young French translator, Étienne Brûlé, was the first European to set foot in the area, some time between 1610 and 1614.
In 1793, John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, visited the area and saw its potential as a naval base. He wanted to use the bay to shelter warships to protect British interests on lakes Huron, Erie and Michigan. Beginning in 1814, the British-Canadians built the Penetanguishene Road to provide the area a land route to Barrie and Toronto, as it was previously accessible only by water transport along the rivers or across Georgian Bay.
The town of Midland was founded in 1871 when the Midland Railway selected the sparsely populated community of Mundy's Bay as its new terminus. At that time the railway ran from Port Hope to Beaverton. The line to the town was completed by 1879. Settlers, attracted by the convenience of rail service, soon began to move into the area. The village thrived based on Georgian Bay shipping and the lumber and grain trade. Light industrial companies have established themselves in the area and tourism in the southern Georgian Bay area also contributes to the economy.

Climate[edit]
The climate is nearly the same as much of Southern Ontario and has balmy summers and chilly winters. Thunderstorms, hailstorms, snowstorm, lake effect snow, and freezing rain are also commonplace for this city.
