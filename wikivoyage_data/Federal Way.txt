Get in[edit]
Federal Way is less than 10 miles south of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. It is on Interstate 5 and reaches to Puget Sound.

By car[edit]
 Interstate 5 (I-5) Federal Way is accessed from exits #142 A & B("SR 18/S 348th St") through #147 ("S 272nd St") along I-5. There are four exits from I-5 into town. The Federal Way Commons (closest thing to a 'downtown') can be accessed from Exit #143 ("S 320th St") from both directions of I-5. The S 317th St exit & merge lanes (accessed from the left lanes of both directions) are restricted to carpools (2 or more) and buses. Nearest for other users is through S 320th.
 Pacific Highway S passes through town as Pacific Hwy from Kent/Des Moines in the north and Fife in the south. It runs parallel to I-5 with multiple stores, restaurants, malls and motels along the road. SR-99 provides direct connection between Federal Way and the airport in Sea-Tac where it becomes International Blvd.
 State Route (SR) 18 into S 348th St Connects Federal Way and I-5 corridor to the I-90 corridor in North Bend and Snoqualmie Falls (Exit 25 of I-90) through Auburn, Covington, Maple Valley and Issaquah. SR-18 ends at its junction with I-5 and becomes S 348th west of the I-5 corridor in Federal Way. It is the shortest way to reach Snoqualmie Pass and anywhere east via I-90 from Federal Way, Tacoma and anywhere south along I-5 WITHOUT going into Seattle or Bellevue.
 Enchanted Pkwy S Connects Federal Way to Mount Rainier via Edgewood, Puyallup, South Hill and Graham in Pierce County. It goes through town as Enchanted Pkwy S which becomes 16th Ave S north of its intersection with S 348th. It ends at its intersection with SR-99 at S 340th Pl.
 SW Dash Point Dr/East Side Dr Connects the SR-99 corridor at the 29700 block into downtown Tacoma via Dash Point State Park and Port of Tacoma Tideflats / Fife. It goes around Federal Way through local residential neighborhoods offering a scenic drive and views of the Sound in some places. Going north from the 29700 block, SR-509 runs concurrent with SR-99 to its intersection with Kent Des Moines Hwy (SR-516) in Des Moines. It is Dash Point Dr in Federal Way and becomes East Side Dr in NE Tacoma.

By car[edit]
Federal Way's street designation is a continuation of King County's street designation system in South Seattle (S) and West Seattle (SW), beginning at 1st Ave S & Yesler in Seattle. The major roads are somewhat in a grid, with north-south roads called Avenues that suffix the directional and east-west roads being Streets that prefix the directional. There are occasional irregularities: Ways are long roads that don't always conform to the grid, Drives are long, circuitous routes, and there are the very short Place or Court that dead ends on one end of the road. Most roads are numbered with a few that are named.  
Federal Way lies approximately between S 272nd St (27200 block) and S 373rd St (37300 block) south of Seattle (Yesler), which run east and west. 1st Ave S (goes north-south) divides 'South' (east of 1st) from 'Southwest' (west of 1st) as it goes from S 291st St (29100) at Redondo Beach to S 368th St (36800) as a major throughfare. It does not connect Federal Way to Seattle.  Roads south of the King-Pierce County line, south of Federal Way, change to a Northeast (NE) directional (in the suffix) which is based on Tacoma's directional system as that part of town is in Tacoma but is closer and more connected to Federal Way then it is to Tacoma. The house numbers decrease from south to north; and from the east and from the west towards 1st Ave S.
