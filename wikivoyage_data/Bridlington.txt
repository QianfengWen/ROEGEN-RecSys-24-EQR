Bridlington Seafront
Bridlington is a seaside town and fishing port in East Yorkshire. It was originally two towns: the Old Town, about a mile inland, grew up around the medieval Augustinian priory, while Bridlington Quay was the fishing settlement and harbour. The two merged in the mid-19th-century when the railway arrived and Brid (as it's often called) developed rapidly as a resort.


Get in[edit]
By road[edit]
The usual approach is to follow M62 east to Howden (J37), then take A614. From the north, take A64 or A19 to York, then A166 east to meet A614 at Driffield. By any route, expect congestion on summer weekends.
For travel news tune in to Yorkshire Coast Radio[dead link] (102.4FM).

By rail[edit]
54.084-0.19851 Bridlington railway station. Trains run from Hull every hour or so, taking 40 min; this is the surest route from points south. From the west or north, there is an hourly service from Liverpool via Manchester, Leeds and York to Scarborough, but then you have to connect at middle-of-nowhere Seamer with the infrequent Scarborough to Bridlington train. If you are delayed and likely to miss this connection, then stay on the train to Scarborough and take Bus 12 / 13 onward.   (updated Mar 2019)
By bus[edit]
Transdev Coastliner Bus 843 runs hourly from Leeds via York to Scarborough. Change at Scarborough for East Yorkshire Bus 12 / 13, which runs daily every 20 min via Filey to Brid; it takes an hour as it visits all the caravan parks dotted along the coast. 
There's an hourly East Yorkshire Bus 121 from Hull, taking 90 min. Summer only, the Express X21 takes about 1 hr 20 min but there's only one per day, leaving Hull around 9AM and heading back from Brid around 5PM.
National Express coach NX563 runs directly from London Victoria taking 7 hours to Bridlington. This leaves London daily around noon, with the return southbound leaving Brid around 8AM. This coach runs via Leeds and York, so change at Leeds for travel north, e.g. to and from Newcastle upon Tyne.

Get around[edit]
54°5′2″N 0°11′35″WMap of Bridlington
East Yorkshire Bus 14 runs hourly M-Sa between Brid and Flamborough North Landing, near the Head. There's no bus to Bempton, for the seabird centre, but Bempton railway station on the Hull-Brid-Scarborough line is a mile or so away.
Access: Bridlington is a very accessible town for people with mobility issues. It is flat, unlike Filey or Scarborough further along the rugged coast - the cliffs rear up just north of town but gradients are mild between the centre and the beaches. The harbour area can be a little tricky to negotiate as much of it is cobbled or has steps. Mobility scooters can be hired by the day or week and many can be seen on the promenades on the front. Several guest houses and self-catering places have spaces for scooters to be kept by guests.

To admire the views from above, drive or cycle the minor roads out to the Head or to the "North Landing". This northern part is called "Bempton Cliffs" and there's a wild-life centre.

Go next[edit]
To the north, Scarborough and Filey are agreeable nearby beach resorts, easily done as day trips by bus or train. The coast further north is rugged and scenic, with the little harbour of Robin Hood's Bay, and then gothic Whitby.
Inland, explore the North York Moors National Park.
To the south is the small resort of Hornsea, a 1950s time-warp, then come the strange "toffee-castle" cliffs of East Yorkshire. Here the soft hills of the Wolds are being rapidly eroded by the sea, leaving farm buildings dangling over the edge or crumpled sideways on the shore, while humbug-hued turrets of ground await the next high tide. Erosion is so rapid that even a recent map is likely to be out of date, with access roads closed off, or gone over the edge to join the medieval villages drowned offshore. These 15- to 30-foot-high cliffs stretch for some 20 miles, then the coast becomes sand hills. It culminates in Spurn Point, a nature reserve - look out for birds, moths, butterflies, and huge ships churning past the lighthouse along the Humber.
York, some 40 miles east, is a must-see, and for big city amusements head for Leeds.
