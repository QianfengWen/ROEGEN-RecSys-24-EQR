Donner Pass RoadTruckee is a pleasant town of 17,000 people (2019) in the Lake Tahoe region of California. Just east of the Donner Pass on Interstate 80, Truckee is an easy entry point for travelers from the Bay Area to the region.

Understand[edit]
Truckee began in 1863 as Gray's Station, named for Joseph Gray's Roadhouse on the Trans-Sierra wagon road.  The Central Pacific Railroad selected Truckee as the name of its railroad station by August 1867, even though the tracks would not reach the station until 1868. It was renamed Truckee after a Paiute chief, whose assumed Paiute name was Tru-ki-zo. He was the father of Chief Winnemucca and grandfather of Sarah Winnemucca. The first Europeans who came to cross the Sierra Nevada encountered his tribe. The friendly chief rode toward them yelling, “Tro-kay!”, which is Paiute for “Everything is all right”. The unaware travelers assumed he was yelling his name. Chief Truckee later served as a guide for John C. Frémont.

Climate[edit]
Winters are chilly with regular snowfall, while summers are warm to hot and dry, with occasional periods of intense thunderstorms.

By car[edit]
I-80 bisects Truckee allowing access from Sacramento and the Bay Area from the west, and Reno to the east.
From King's Beach in Lake Tahoe, SR 267 heads north into Truckee.
While easy to approach under clear conditions, travelers should pay close attention to inclement weather during the winter. Roads in and out of Truckee can rapidly become treacherous during heavy winter storms. Donner Pass (over 7,000 ft/2,100 m elevation) in particular should not be attempted during heavy storms without strong winter driving skills and chains or 4-wheel drive. While well-maintained and regularly plowed, the pass can live up to its infamous name under the worst conditions. If the weather becomes too harsh, "chain control" will be put into effect, allowing only cars with 4-wheel drive or chains over Donner Pass. Should the weather render the highway impassable, I-80 will close until conditions improve.
Status on California highways can be seen here.

By plane[edit]

Drink[edit]
The oldest stretch of "Downtown" Truckee (towards the east end of town) features a string of bars and is a lively scene most nights during the high season. The Truckee Police and California Highway Patrol have a zero-tolerance policy for drunk driving, and sobriety stops are not uncommon. While crime rates in the area are very low, a larger-than-expected number of locals boast a D.U.I. on their records due to this enforcement focus.
