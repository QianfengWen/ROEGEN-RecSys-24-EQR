Franz Josef is a glacial area at the foot of the western slopes of Mount Cook, in the middle of the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand.


Understand[edit]
The recent spectacular ice retreat at the Franz Josef Glacier has surprised even the experts and shocked local businesspeople who thought the impressive ice river would be a reliable source of income for years to come.
The glacier retreated 800 m in five years, prompting suggestions of a road up the valley as the ice disappears from view. Although the South Island's steep, low altitude glaciers have always been dramatic in their advances and retreats, the rapidity of the present retreat is remarkable in geological time scales. Between 1893 and the end of its last big retreat 90 years later, in 1983, Franz Josef Glacier receded about 3 km. Then, between 1983 and 2008, this glacier advanced almost 1.5 km after heavy snowfalls. But in the following five years it melted almost 820 m.
The retreat began in 2008, and in 2011 the ice thinned by about 70 m behind the glacier terminal. Then, in 2012, a huge hole opened up and guided walks were stopped. Scientists using seismometers detected "ice quakes" - the ground shaking from an ice collapse - as a huge cavity formed beneath the glacier, eventually causing its surface to sink into it.
Tourists had been flown on to the ice by helicopter, but now even this is in jeopardy.
The walk from the car park to the terminal face is now nearly 4 km and many visitors are considering visiting the larger glacier at Fox township instead. In 2011, about 330,000 people visited Franz Josef, and 184,000 went to Fox.
DoC is considering an emergency plan to build a new road to the rapidly retreating terminal face but The Westland National Park plan and park by-laws may have to be changed so the road can be built. DoC is also considering reviewing the limit on the number of heli-hikes allowed on the glacier.

Get in[edit]
The road north was badly damaged on SH6 in December 2019, road works are still happening but the road is now fully open. The nearby South road bridge on SH6 that was badly damaged in March 2019 is fully repaired.
By car[edit]
It's about 30 min from Fox Glacier.
It's about 2 hr from Greymouth.
It's 4½hrs from Wanaka.
It's a 5-hour drive from Christchurch
By bus[edit]
Tour buses generally make Franz Josef one of their stops, either for the night or at least a lunch break.

By air[edit]
Franz Josef Airport is really only suitable for light aircraft. Mount Cook Airport is on the other of the mountains, and a scenic flightseeing trip can often be arranged at short notice.

Get around[edit]
Map of Franz Josef
While you can take your car to the car park at the foot of the glacier, you will need to get out and walk 25 minutes to the terminal face, as the glacier is receding. There are walking tracks in the glacier valley. Please take heed of the warning signs as you get close to the glacier terminal face.
If you prefer to do things the easy way, try flightseeing, either in a plane or helicopter.  Hire a bike to explore the township at the different pace.

The 11-km-long Franz Josef Glacier is one of New Zealand's most spectacular natural attractions, a remnant from the Ice Age which is one of South Westland's major drawcards for visitors.
The Glacier area (which also includes Fox Glacier) attracts up to 550,000 tourists every year - most of them taking the opportunity to view the glacier close up by taking a walking tour or getting the big picture from the sky by helicopter.
The flow rate is about 10 times that of typical glaciers. From a long term perspective, the glacier has retreated since the last ice age, and it is believed that it reached the sea some 10,000 to 15,000 years ago. The glacier ends about 17 km from the Tasman Sea and the West Coast of the South Island.
Being a slow-moving frozen river, the stunning glacial landscape changes daily, and all safety warnings should be taken seriously.

Do[edit]
Visit the glacier[edit]
Visit the glacier by foot, independently or with a guided tour. Do not pass the warning barriers at the glacier. Or take a helicopter flight.
