Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The long drive in (2-3 hr) from Nelson winds through the Buller Gorge before it nears Westport and is scenically interesting almost the whole way, but along narrow, winding, roads. The final 50 min drive south from Westport is along a truly stunning coast after you reach the sea.
From the south, you'll have to pass through Greymouth. Punakaiki is approximately 3.5 hr drive north of Fox Glacier.

By bus[edit]
Intercity Coaches operate coaches from Nelson to Greymouth, which stop in Punakaiki once per day in each direction. Coaches often stop for a refreshment stop here, which allows a quick 15 minutes or so looking at the Pancake Rocks.
East West Coaches run shuttle buses from Westport to Christchurch via Arthur's Pass and Greymouth which stop her once per day in each direction.

Rock formations off the coast
-42.1142171.32711 Pancake Rocks and Blow Holes Walk (Dolomite Point). The Pancake Rocks are picturesque limestone formations that look curiously like stony stacks of pancakes after being pounded by the Tasman Sea for tens of thousands of years. The blow holes funnel blasts water up to 15 m (50 ft) into the air as the waves crash into the caverns below the rocks. The best spouts are caught at high tides with westerly waves (usually signposted at the information centre) but a leisurely 20 min walk around the boardwalks is still great even without timing your visit. Much of the walk is wheelchair-accessible.
