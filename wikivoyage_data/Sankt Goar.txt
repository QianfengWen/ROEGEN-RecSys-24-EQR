Get around[edit]
Map of Sankt Goar
The town sits in a narrow flat section of the valley between the river and the steep hillside. There is effectively only the main street (B9 Heerstraße) and one main retail street (Oberstraße) making it an easy place to walk around. To visit the castle on the hill above either drive to the car park or take the tourist road train up the hill.

See[edit]
50.1542197.7048461 Castle Rhinefels (Burg Rheinfels). Looming formidably above Sankt Goar and the Rhine valley, the large and partially ruined fortress of Burg Rhinefels is definitely worth a visit on any trip to the Rhineland. The fortress's first components were built in 1245 by Count Diether von Katzenelnbogen. Other rulers of the region made their own contributions to the construction castle. It was eventually ruined by members of the French Revolutionary Army when they were invading the area. Despite its partially ruined state, the fortress retains a strong sense of dignity and strength. The castle is only one fifth of its size before its destruction by the French Army in 1797. One way to understand the former size of the fortress is to explore the underground tunnels built during the 30 Years War. These tunnels were built under the flat, undefended plain to the West of the castle by the garrison of the castle. The tunnels were filled with gunpowder, and in theory, as an approaching enemy army neared the castle by way of the flat plain, the gunpowder would be ignited and eventually explode, sending the enemy army falling to their death. However this secret weapon was never put to use so the tunnels formerly housing gunpowder can be visited today. It is a tight fit and flashlights are needed.

Events[edit]

Buy[edit]
This is home to many shop catering to tourists and thus one of the best places to buy a beer stein, clogs or cuckoo clocks, non of which are traditional to the region although obviously associated with Germany. They have the biggest range of all three. Wine is obviously the local produce, but probably better to purchase in other villages in and above the valley if you are looking for a bargain.
