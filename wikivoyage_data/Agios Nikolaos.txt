By bus[edit]
Local bus service with modern air-conditioned buses.
Elounda, Kritsa, Sitia, Heraklion (and from there, Knossos), Malia and Hersonnisos are easily accessed with a regular bus service which is very good value.

By scooter[edit]
Scooters are readily available. Wearing crash helmets is compulsory. Do not ruin your holiday by receiving a large fine.

By hired car[edit]
You will not normally need a 4 x 4 to negotiate the roads, most of which are sealed. Some places and rental properties are less accessible. Beware of damage to the underside of the hire car on rough tracks.

By taxi[edit]
Excellent value. Invariably will be a large, clean and air-conditioned Mercedes. Most drivers speak basic English and have none of the bad habits of many Med taxi drivers (loud local music, smoking en route, etc.)

By quad[edit]
Not designed for use on the road, these cause traffic congestion and impatience, leading to many accidents and occasional deaths. Think very carefully before hiring one and using it on the roads.

See[edit]
Recommended are the boat trips which are fascinating and have amazing value (do not spend more than €10); they also usually include an ocean swim.

Do[edit]
Nearby Istron Bay
Visit Almyros beach, a long sandy beach with a cold water stream entering the sea at the southern end. Perfect for a cooling paddle if the heat gets too much. About a 20-minute walk from the town centre but worth every step. Alternatively, a taxi from the town centre costs about €8.
If it is windy, consider a pebble beach rather than a sand beach, of which there is no shortage.

Buy[edit]
Locally produced fruit and vegetables at the market on Wednesday morning. The tomatoes are superb.
Thyme honey. The bees here take the pollen from thyme and the subtle flavour is transferred to the honey.

Eat[edit]
There are a good selection of restaurants and tavernas in the town, ranging from the small and friendly "Grigoris" to the superb "Mediterraneo" on the harbour.
Meze restaurants worth visiting are "Barko" which provides a modern slant on traditional dishes and "Chyssofillis" on Kitroplatia. Just around the corner is "9 Muses", a modern restaurant/cafe bar which is popular with local residents. The "Piato" near Ammoudi beach is an excellent contemporary meze restaurant. Near the taxi rank by tourist information is "Embassy".
For more northern European tastes, "Obelix" is a Dutch operated restaurant near Ammoudi beach which serves large portions with a daily special.

"Puerto" is popular with the young locals and 25 March Street (25 Martiou) is busy at weekends with many of the local student population. Don't be misled by old tales about this street being the hub of the night life for tourists. It is entirely "Greek" and if you don't want to hear modern Greek music you will be in the wrong place.
The bars that have survived the change in tourist tastes over the last few years include "Aquarius", "Sorrento" and "Alexandros". The first two are "British" style tourist bars and the latter is a rooftop garden bar which has a small dance floor.
