Märsta is with its 27,000 inhabitants the largest city in Sigtuna Municipality in Stockholm County in Sweden. It is located between the capital Stockholm, some 35 km to the south, and Sweden's fourth largest city Uppsala, some 30 km to the north, and some 4 km from Stockholm-Arlanda Airport.


Understand[edit]
Märsta has historically been an important postal stop on the route between Stockholm and Uppsala. As a railway opened between these cities in 1866 and Märsta became one of the railway stops. In 1960 Stockholm-Arlanda Airport opened only a few kilometres from Märsta, and the city grew from some 2,900 inhabitants in 1960 to 16,400 in 1970. When the city was constructed it was intended to cover four hills; Valsta, Pinbacken, Brista and Norrbacka. However, as Arlanda expanded it was deemed that Pinbacken and Brista were too close to the airport, wherefore only Valsta and Norrbacka where settled. As a consequence of this the economic and cultural centre of Märsta is actually located in the geographical outskirts of the city.
Rosersberg is a small settlement between Märsta and Stockholm's northern suburbs, notable for the two palaces Rosersberg and Skånelaholm, and the beautiful lake Frysingen.
