Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Kaifeng is one of the oldest cities in China, and was the capital of China during several dynasties including the Xia, Song and Jin and is believed to have been the largest city in the world for most of the 11th century. Marco Polo visited in 1260. Kaifeng's central axis has never changed, and successive iterations of the city were built on top of the ruins of its previous versions.
Around 1,000 years ago, when it was the capital of the Song dynasty, Kaifeng was the most prosperous and busiest city in China and the world. Countless expats immigrated right here and lived their whole lives, especially Arabians and Persians, who afterwards formed a new ethnic group in China, named Hui (回族).  Jews also settled in Kaifeng in the Bible Hutong (教经胡同; Jiaojing Hutong). Kaifeng is also famous in China because it is where the huge classic handscroll painting "Along the River During the Qingming Festival" was painted.

By bus[edit]
Local buses go everywhere within the city and cost ¥1. Bus 20 is a sightseeing bus going to all the major sights.
There is a bus stop at the corner of the carpark in front of the train station. From here bus no 9 and bus no 1 will take you into town - fare ¥1.

By rickshaw[edit]
One very good way to get around Kaifeng and see the sites is to take what the locals call "bengbeng"; essentially a tuktuk or motorised rickshaw. 6 kuai will take you from the train station to Henan University's old campus, essentially the length of the city. Short trips should be two or three kuai.

Landmarks and buildings[edit]
34.7912114.34831 Daxiangguo Temple (大相国寺; Dà​xiāng​guó​sì​; lit. Temple of the Chief Minister), Ziyou Road (Bus 9 or 20). This temple was built AD555 during the Qi Dynasty with new buildings added in 1661 and 1766. The entire complex has 64 temples but the three main halls are of the greatest interest. The large rectangular Tathagata Hall (Daxiongbaodian) is where monks perform daily chanting rituals in front of three huge Buddhas. In the middle is an impressive bronze Sakyamuni, left is Amitabha and right is the Medicine Buddha, each with a silk hood surrounding their head. At the back of the three Buddhas is a Goddess of Mercy standing on a dragon's head and flanked by a various golden figures. Rising behind them to the roof are a multitude of heavenly figures supported on clouds. Along the side are sculptures of some peculiar looking Arhats; look for the one with an abnormally long arm reaching almost to the roof. The octagonal Arhat Hall (Louhandian) is beautifully constructed with upturned eaves and painted roof beams. The hall houses a breathtakingly beautiful four-sided golden Avalokitesavara said to be carved from a single tree over 50 years. She has six main arms, one set holding aloft a Buddha and 1000 other arms radiating outward with an eye in each palm. The rear Tripitaka Hall has two floors, the upper holding sutras and the lower a white Burmese jade Buddha in the Burmese style and a glass replica of the Emerald Buddha in Thailand’s Grand Palace. Unfortunately, all halls have a No Photo policy which is rarely adhered to even by local tourists, and rarely enforced by the attending monks. ¥30.

It is still in good condition and can be climbed using the internal stairs for ¥30 (not for the claustrophobic, no viewing platform, just a dead end at the top, but several windows along the way and interesting bricks to look at). There is a Buddhist temple located near the pagoda and a small lake. ¥60, ¥30 concession.   
34.7707114.35865 Po Pagoda (繁塔, pó tǎ), 30 Po Ta West Road, 禹王台区繁塔西街30号.
