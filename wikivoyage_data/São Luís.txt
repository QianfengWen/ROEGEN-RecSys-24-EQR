São Luís is the capital of the Brazilian state of Maranhão. It's known for its colonial Historical Center, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and is a common stopover for visiting the stunning Lençóis Maranhenses.


Understand[edit]
Historical Center of São Luís
São Luís's people, history and culture is marked by a distinctive fusion of Portuguese, indigenous Brazilian and African elements, such as its highly popular local version of the Bumba meu boi festival, happening yearly in June and July. The reggae music from the Caribbean is also immensely popular in São Luís, often referred to as the "Brazilian Jamaica".

History[edit]
Typical tiled walls in São Luís
São Luís was founded by the French invaders in 1612, and taken over by the Portuguese in 1615. It was subsequently conquered by Dutch invaders in 1641, and finally, retaken over for good by the Portuguese in 1644. The city prospered between the 17th and 19th centuries by means of export-oriented plantations (especially cotton) and slave trade. The city's Historical Center, a World heritage site, with buildings with beautiful azulejo (tiles) walls and the cobblestone streets, has been erected mostly during this era.
In the end of the 19th century, however, São Luís suffered from economic collapse due to the decline of cotton exportations. Only after the 1960s the city started to recover by means of government investments and iron exports, via the Vale do Rio Doce mining company. Tourism has also become an important part of economy, especially during the Bumba meu boi festivities, but tourism development is still hampered by several factors, including subpar infrastructure, lack of lingual proficiency of tourism workers, difficulties on preservation of historical heritage, and urban violence.

Orientation[edit]
Map of São Luís
For a visitor, there are two main areas of interest in São Luís:

The city's Historical Center, located by the sea, just south of the Anil river, which is also the city's cultural heart and center of popular shopping
The area around the Lagoa da Jansen (Jansen's lagoon), containing the city's urban beaches and most modern, affluent neighborhoods (like Ponta do Farol, Ponta da Areia and Jardim Renascença), including more upscale shopping and nightlife
Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
Bus station some 8 km southeast of the center, close to the airport in Avenida dos Franceses 5073 - right north of the intersection with Rua Tres. Telephone +55 98 3249-2488.

The bus 901 São Cristovão / Alemanha leaves from right outside the terminal (follow the signs) every 25 minutes or so, and takes about 45 minutes to reach Praça Deodouro in the city center (where you can hop on to get to the airport). Get off one stop after, on Rua do Passeio and walk down the pedestrian Rua Grande for 10 minutes to get to the eastern edge of Old Town.
If the above bus is not about to leave, a faster way is walking for 10 minutes along the main exit from the airport. Keeping to the right you will see a Shell gas station. From here you take the bus Socorrão 2 / Rodoviária(or ask what other goes), pretty straight to the Old down, about 30 minutes. To get to the airport, a number of buses from the Praia Grande terminal pass by the Shell station.
Taxis run at fixed prices, displayed at a table just as you exit from luggage pick up: to Old Town R$30, to the beaches R$40.

Get around[edit]
Street corner in the Historic Center
By bus[edit]
São Luís' public transit system is composed by a network of buses. A single ride ticket costs R$ 2.70 and a multiple ride ticket costs R$ 3.10 (2018). Multiple rides use bus interchange stations called Terminals or a Bilhete Único smartcard and have theoretically to be done on the same direction to qualify for transfer free of charge.
The main bus interchange is located in the west of the Historical Center, at Av. Sen. Vitórino Freire. There, the following bus lines can be of use to visitors:

T065 São Raimundo / Band Tribuzzi takes you to São Luís Shopping in about 15 minutes.
403 Calhau/Litorânea goes by all the beaches.
The official bus transit app, launched by the city administration, is called Meu ônibus, but Moovit also works in São Luís.

By taxi[edit]
Taxis are popular among tourists, especially after sunset. Rideshare platforms Uber and 99Taxi are also available in São Luís - on these, the ride between airport and historical center on the wee hours costs around R$ 20 (2018).

Stay safe[edit]
São Luís is safe enough by Brazilian standards, although roaming the empty streets of the Historical Center at night should be avoided. As with anywhere else in South America, not displaying expensive possessions (such as professional cameras, smartphones and stacks of cash) avoids trouble.

Stay healthy[edit]
As elsewhere in Brazil, some beaches in São Luís are not suitable for bathing, and conditions can change from day to day. On the day of your visit, check the map of bathing reports (in Portuguese, laudos de balneabilidade) of the state's Environment Department (SEMA).

Cope[edit]
Laundry at Lavamatic, upper end of Rua Ribeirão, R$ 9/kg, next day if you are lucky.
Go next[edit]
Alcântara - Reached by an approximately hour long boat ride from São Luis. The ferry also carries vehicles. Timetables are not entirely stable as they depend somewhat on tides, but mostly around 07:00 and 09:00 there should be a boat, R$10, with return in the late afternoon. Doublecheck at ticket office the day before. Travellers with a vehicle are advised to book a ticket on iBomBordo[dead link]; otherwise, you may have a long wait for the next available boat ride with a free vehicle space and you may also not be guaranteed a return!
