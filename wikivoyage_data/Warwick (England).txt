Plan of the castle
Warwick was a major fortified settlement from the early Middle Ages, the most notable relic of this period being Warwick Castle. Much was destroyed in the Great Fire of Warwick in 1694 and then rebuilt with fine 18th-century buildings, such as the Collegiate Church of St Mary and the Shire Hall. It was home to 37,000 people in 2021.
