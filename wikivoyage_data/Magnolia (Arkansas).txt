33°16′27″N 93°14′1″WMap of Magnolia (Arkansas)
Magnolia is located off HWY 79, southwest of Pine Bluff. Bounding south, at the intersection of HWY 79 and 82 E. you'll find Magnolia's business district. The closest major cities are Texarkana, TX; Little Rock, AR; and Shreveport, LA. These three cities are major not only for its commerce, but for its airports as well. The best way route of transportation is a motor vehicle, but If you need to fly in, you will need to come into one of these airport locations and then rent a car!

Get around[edit]
Magnolia is pretty large in acreage, but the bulk of its commerce, residences, and other facilities are located radially from the court square. If you know North St., Jackson St., Vine St., Main St.(US HWY 371 S. and 82 E.),and US HWY 79 you can get anywhere and everywhere in the city. These streets take you to the churches, banks, eateries, shops, etc. the town has to offer. Not to mention, most of these streets take you to the historical Court Square!

See[edit]
Magnolia Trees Magnolia derives it name from the approximately one-hundred-and-fifty-year-old (per the Hester Brothers' best recollection) Magnolia trees that surround the downtown courthouse.  The downtown area is clean, vital and features several murals chronicling Magnolia's history.
World Championship Steak Cook-Off, which has been featured on the Food Network.  The festival takes place on the third weekend in May and is a popular stop for Arkansas politicians stumping for office.
Southern Arkansas University (SAU).  SAU is known for its world-class rodeo team and agricultural business program.
Wilson Memorial Garden Just off the square. Magnolia is overflowing with its magnificent art and murals, but as a new structure, this garden is absolutely breath taking from the waterfalls to the vast collection of botanicles.
