A very quiet and unspoiled beach on the bay
Batemans Bay is a small coastal city (population 16,000) situated at the mouth of the Clyde River. It is close to the many fine beaches of the Eurobodalla in southeastern New South Wales.


Understand[edit]
Batemans Bay is the closest ocean beach to the Australian capital, Canberra, making it a popular weekend and holiday destination for Canberrans. Many of the people who live in Batemans Bay are retired, although it is now attracting younger families looking for more affordable homes that are close to the sea.
Batemans Bay and the surrounding South Coast area boast some of the most spectacular and unspoiled coastline in New South Wales. However, the township itself is fairly unlovely.
During summer, Batemans Bay's population more than doubles from holidaying folk from inland.

Climate[edit]
Warm during summer (December-February). The weather in autumn and spring is fairly mild. Due to the coastal location winter in Batemans Bay is not too cold.

Get in[edit]
Map of Batemans Bay
Batemans Bay is on the Princes Highway (A1), some 280 km (175 miles) south of Sydney (3–4 hrs driving time) and about 10–11 hours northeast of Melbourne.
Batemans Bay can be reached from Canberra (2–2.5 hours) by the Kings Highway (B52). Both the Kings Highway and the Princes Highway have a fairly high accident rate relative to the Australian average. They are fully paved roads, but quite busy. Apart from the occasional passing lane, it is one lane each direction, no center divider, generally 100 km/h limit. There are some very tight 20 km/h corners going down the Clyde mountain from Canberra.
For Melbourne visitors coming via Canberra and the Hume Highway is the faster route.

Do[edit]
Cruise up the Clyde river to Nelligen. Visit Mogo for arts and crafts, recreated gold mining village, and zoo. Visit national parks including Murramurang.  The Eurobodalla Botanic Gardens explains the local flora. Most importantly visit the beaches.
Water based activities in the area include deep sea fishing to surf board, boat and jet ski hire.  Just south of Batemans Bay, the Broulee Surf School[1] offers lessons for all levels. Jetskis can be hired off Corrigans Beach close to the town on the south side of the bay.
Shop for arts and crafts in the neighbouring villages - Mogo is quite close, Tilba Tilba is further afield, south down the Princes Highway.  At Tilba Tilba the ABC cheese factory sells produce.
Spend a night out on the town with first class restaurants and home town pubs with local entertainment.

Swimming[edit]
The sea temperature becomes quite pleasant as summer progresses, though at the start of summer can be quite chilly. Surprisingly there is often a brief period towards the end of spring when the sea temperature is quite mild, before getting chilly, and then warming up as summer progresses.
Most beaches in the area have times when they are patrolled by local surf life saving clubs manned by volunteers. Visitors should ensure they swim between the yellow and red flags that denote the patrolled area of the beach. Broulee South Beach is a great beach to swim at on a calm day especially for young families and it is patrolled all weekends during summer.

Buy[edit]
You can purchase small souvenirs (both commercial and unique) of Batemans Bay from the many local arts and crafts establishments and retailers.  As a growing regional population center, the town is also well serviced by local shops and chains including Kmart, Coles and Woolworths.

Eat[edit]
Oysters from the Clyde River are a local speciality and are also highly praised and appreciated by a much wider audience, including Sydney restaurants and beyond. The Pearly Oyster Bar in North Street is a good place to try local produce.
