Studio City is an area in the San Fernando Valley, just  to the west of Universal City and about 12 miles NW of Downtown LA. As its name implies, Studio City arose to support the motion picture studios with affordable housing for their employees.  Some of the studio's biggest stars, such as Gene Autry, lived in the hills of Studio City (more recently, George Clooney).  Studio City flourished in the 1950s and early 1960s and has become a trendy, upscale neighborhood with great restaurants and shopping. Radford  Studios and nearby Universal Studios are still major centers of film and TV production. Ventura Boulevard's "sushi alley" is home to perhaps the largest concentration of sushi restaurants in the Los Angeles area.

Get around[edit]

34.14308-118.37561 Brady Residence (Brady Bunch House), 11222 Dilling St (Dilling St and Klump Ave in a residential neighborhood). (Private residence, streetside viewing only. Please respect the privacy of occupants). The historic house was built in 1959 and was used for the exterior shots of the famous Brady Bunch Residence in the 1970s TV sitcom. The inside and the backyard scenes took place on sound stage #5 at Paramount Studios in Hollywood. This is said to be the country's most visited house after the White House in Washington, D.C., and it can only be viewed from the public street, as it has always been a private residence. In 2018 the house went on the market for the first time in decades, for $1.88 million, and was sold to HGTV for $3.5 million. Since then, HGTV has added an additional 2,000 ft² (190 m2) to the back (for the bedrooms) and renovated the inside to match what was on the set. It was the filming location for a Very Brady Renovation (2019) showing the renovation process and the reunion of the people who played the Brady kids from back then. The Brady Bunch set at Paramount Studios was also used once in Mission Impossible and twice on Mannix while the Brady Bunch was still in production. By the 1990s the set was reconstructed for the filming of Sunshine Days an episode of the "X Files" television series. The house is up for sale, once again, for $5.5 million as of May 25, 2023.
