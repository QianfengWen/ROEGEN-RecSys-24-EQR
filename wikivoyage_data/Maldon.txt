Maldon is a town in Essex.


Understand[edit]
The town lies at the eastern end of the River Blackwater Estuary and on the River Chelmer. It's best known for its sea salt. Dating back to 913 (when the town was identified in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle), the area was settled by East Saxons in the 5th century (the area to the south of the town is still known as the Dengie Peninsula names after the Dæningas).

Stay safe[edit]
Maldon is probably one of the safest out of all the towns in Essex. But that doesen't mean there is no crime. General common sense will keep you out of any danger. The north west area of Heybridge should be avoided on foot at night, it is known by locals as a pretty rough area. The park at West Maldon Community Centre on a Friday night is sometimes a favoured hangout for drunk teenagers.
Be aware that all the streetlights are turned off after midnight, and it would be strongly ill advised for you to walk the streets at that time. (The first night the lights went out a girl was violently attacked whilst walking home).

Connect[edit]
Maldon and its approach roads have 4G from all UK carriers. As of Feb 2023, 5G has not reached town.
