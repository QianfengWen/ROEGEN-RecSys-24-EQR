There are lots of historic sites.

26.9383-82.04081 A. C. Freeman House (Gilchrist House), 311 W Retta Esplanade. Albert Gilchrist owned the property until 1903, who went on to serve as the governor of Florida, but sold it to Augustus Freeman who developed the property and was important locally as a politician. Due to the importance of the owners of the property and its Queen Anne architectural style, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. The house has been moved twice, once before its addition to the register, and again twenty years later following Hurricane Charley.   (updated Aug 2021)
