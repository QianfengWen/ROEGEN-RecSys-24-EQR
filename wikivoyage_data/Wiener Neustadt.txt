Wiener Neustadt is a city and Vienna suburb in Lower Austria.  For travellers the city might be a starting point to explore the southern parts of Greater Vienna: to the west there are the foothills of the Alps, to the east Neusiedler See and Hungary are not far away, and to the north central Vienna.


Understand[edit]
Hauptplatz (Main Square)
The city was nearly completely destroyed in World War II, therefore there are not many historic buildings left. Traditionally Wiener Neustadt is an industrial suburban town. It's also a commercial center for the surrounding area. There are many schools, among them the primary military academy of Austria.
