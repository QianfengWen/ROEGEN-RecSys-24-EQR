Semarang is the capital of Central Java province in Indonesia. It is a bustling, growing mid-sized city with a population of almost 1.7 million in 2020. It is more an administrative and business town than a tourist destination. It nevertheless has its own charm, with contrasting modern mid-rises, a significant set of Dutch colonial architecture, Chinatown, and "kampung" all jutting against each other.


Understand[edit]
The city's name is said to derive from the Javanese words "asem" and "arang", which could be translated as "scarce tamarind."

Orientation[edit]
Semarang lies on the province's northern coast. 
Semarang's topography is marked by a narrow coastal plain, rising sharply inland. The city sprawls up from the coast, and the higher areas see some of the highest rate of residential development, due to the slightly cooler climate. The sea is slowly reclaiming the coastal lowlands during the monthly rob or high tides, causing flooding up to more than a kilometer from the coast.

The coastal location can make the climate uncomfortably hot and humid. It is not unusual for temperatures to be above 32 °C (90 °F).
In contrast to many Indonesian cities, Semarang still has a fair amount of greenery. Locals will tell you that areas that used to be (by their standards) "cool" are no longer. The climate is hot and humid, except on the slope - where it is slightly more pleasant - towards Ungaran, so wear light-coloured cotton clothes, such as T-shirts and knee-length trousers for comfort.

Visitor information[edit]
In 2007 the government started to promote Semarang as a tourist destination, starting with the Semarang Pesona Asia (Semarang, Asia's Enchantment) branding.

-6.981303110.4123681 Tourist Information Center (TIC) Semarang, Jl Pemuda No 147 (across the street from the City Hall, near Lawang Sewu and Tugu Muda; TransSemarang Koridor I, II, III, IV), ☏ +62 24 351-5451. Has an information counter and some leaflets about Semarang and other parts of Central Java. The Joglosemar bus (going to Yogyakarta or Solo) and the Central Java Travel shuttle van (going to Jepara), depart from here. 
 Tourist Information Center, (TIC) Achmad Yani Airport. The tourist office also has an information counter at the airport. 
Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
-6.96591110.375351 Achmad Yani International Airport (Bandar Udara Internasional Ahmad Yani SRG  IATA) (close to the city centre). It is well connected with multiple flights each day from hub airports in Jakarta and Surabaya. There are also direct flights from Balikpapan and Banjarmasin (Lion Air). Direct connection from other cities includes Bandung and Batam (Lion Air), Bandar Lampung (Aviastar) and Bali (Garuda, Wings Air). International flights are also available, daily from Kuala Lumpur (AirAsia) and less frequently from Singapore, (AirAsia).   
For international arrivals, if you need a Visa on Arrival, proceed to the left side of the immigration queue, otherwise, go straight to the immigration counter.

Buses from the airport[edit]
Line 5 (Koridor V) of the TransSemarang Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system passes through the airport between 05:30 and 18:30 with a headway every 10 minutes. TransSemarang BRT Airport bus runs between 18:00 and 24:00. For the city centre (e.g. Simpang Lima or the City Hall Balai Kota), take the bus towards Tawang railway station and transfer to Line 1 (Koridor I) in Karangayu. Tickets cost Rp4,000 which includes transfers to any of the other lines. Keep your ticket for checking.

Taxis from the airport[edit]
There is a taxi counter outside arrivals, to the left. Cross over the drop-off lane. Prices are fixed per zone and roughly double the price of normal city taxis because the airport cooperative has a monopoly. A cheaper option is to turn right out of arrivals and walk to where incoming taxis drop off travellers at the departure area, and take one that has just dropped its passengers off. A city taxi to Simpang Lima or the city centre area should cost about Rp70,000.

By train[edit]

There are two main railway stations, both on the north coast mainline connecting Jakarta with Surabaya:

-6.964444110.4277782 Tawang Station (Stasiun Tawang or Semarang Tawang in online bookings), Jl Taman Tawang No. 1 (TransSemarang Koridor II, III, and IV), ☏ +62 24 354-4544. Located in the Old Town (Kota Lama) area, Tawang is historically significant, being the oldest major railway station in Indonesia that is still operational, having been used since 1867. It mostly serves business and executive class long-distance trains from other major cities. However, some economy trains do stop here, for example, those serving Solo and Purwokerto. Be sure to listen for the farewell/welcome song Empat Penari (the four dancers) also as known as Gambang Semarang, played over the tannoy at the arrival or departure of every train.   (updated Oct 2017)
-6.97317110.4153 Poncol Station (Stasiun Poncol or Semarang Poncol in online bookings), Jl Imam Bonjol No. 115 (TransSemarang Koridor III and IV), ☏ +62 24 354-4496. Poncol mainly handles economy class trains serving nearby cities in Central Java, such as Tegal, Pekalongan, or Purwokerto. However, there are some long distance economy trains serving Jakarta, Surabaya, and Malang.   
Semarang is well-connected to Jakarta, Bandung and Surabaya by train. The economy and executive class train Joglosemarkerto travels in a loop across Central Java, through Yogyakarta, Solo, Semarang, Pekalongan, Tegal, Purwokerto, and back to Yogyakarta, as well as in the reverse direction. Multiple executive-class trains connect Semarang to Jakarta (6 hours) and Surabaya (4 hours) several times a day, with overnight journeys also possible. The Harina service connects Semarang to Bandung and Surabaya once a day with executive and economy class coaches.

By car[edit]
Semarang can be reached by car from both Jakarta and Surabaya in around 4-5 hours and from Solo in less than 2 hours using the Trans-Java toll road.
From Cilacap in the very southwest of Central Java will take seven to eight hours, via Banyumas, Wonosobo and Temanggung. At Temanggung you can choose to keep going on the main roads through Secang and Ambarawa, or to cut up over the side of Mount Ungaran to Sumowono and Bandungan and take advantage of their all-day fruit and vegetable market.

By bus[edit]
The biggest and most modern bus terminal in Semarang is:

-6.968938110.2893124 Mangkang Bus Terminal (Terminal Mangkang), Mangkang Kulon, Tugu (TransSemarang Koridor I). Intercity bus, TransSemarang and TransJateng.  (updated Sep 2022)
Many bus companies offer daily service from Jakarta, from Pulo Gebang Bus Terminal and Kampung Rambutan Bus Terminal in East Jakarta, Kalideres Bus Terminal and Grogol Bus Terminal in West Jakarta, or from Pasar Jumat Bus Terminal (the successor of Lebak Bulus Bus Terminal) in South Jakarta. The overnight bus with A/C is also available with good service. You can choose bus operators such as Garuda Mas, Kramat Djati, Laju Prima, Nusantara, Raya, Rosalia Indah[dead link], and Safari Dharma Raya , which are all well-reputed. Sometimes the bus route is Jakarta to Solo via Semarang. In this case, you can ask the bus driver's assistant (the on-board ticket-checker) to wake you up in Semarang.
There is an executive-class tourist bus Joglosemar, which connects Jogjakarta, Solo, and Semarang (hence the name). It picks up tourists from specific hotels and provides snacks and water for their trip. Pricier than other executive buses, it is more comfortable and provides friendly service. They depart almost hourly.
Other companies providing shuttle vans in and out of Semarang include DayTrans (from Jogjakarta, Jepara), Solo and Cilacap), Central Java Travel, Bejeu (from Jepara), Bintang Raya, Matraman Travel, Mitra Travel and Putra Mandiri.
If you want to reserve a bus and travel online, there are some booking portals called Easybook, redBus, or Traveloka. This serves bus and travel tickets from cities like Bandung, Jakarta, Surabaya and Yogyakarta.

By boat[edit]
Semarang's Tanjung Emas Port (reachable by TransSemarang Koridor III) is located in the northern part, in an area that unfortunately is often flooded during high tide.
It is regularly served by ships mostly to/from destinations in Kalimantan. The state-owned PELNI has ships going to Banjarmasin (using KM. Egon), Pontianak (using KM. Lawit), and Kumai (using KM. Leuser and KM. Egon). Another operator with ships also going to Kalimantan is Dharma Lautan Utama (DLU), which serves Pontianak, Ketapang, Kumai, and Sampit. There are no regular ships going directly into Semarang from other major cities in Java, except for occasional ships from Jakarta during the mudik period close to Lebaran offered an alternative for people going back to their hometowns.
Cruise ships occasionally spend a day in port. It has few facilities for passengers, but an informal market of street vendors often assembles outside the secure area.  Most passengers take a one-day tour to Borobudur or a city tour of Semarang.

Get around[edit]
Map of Semarang


By minibus/bus[edit]
A blue-grey TransSemarang bus Koridor I passing Jl Pemuda near the Balai Kota
There are big and medium-sized buses operated by city government-owned company called TransSemarang buses with designated stops on raised platforms (locally known as shelter). Despite being called a BRT system, the buses do not travel in designated lanes. There are eight routes:

Koridor : Penggaron (Bus Terminal)-Mangkang (Bus Terminal)
Koridor 1M: Mangkang (Bus Terminal)-Simpang Lima (night service, 18:00-23:00)
Koridor : Sisemut (Bus Terminal)-Terboyo (Bus Terminal)
Koridor : Pelabuhan (Port)-Elisabeth (via Peterongan)
Koridor : Pelabuhan (Port)-Elisabeth (via Simpang Lima)
Koridor : Cangkiran-Stasiun Tawang (Tawang Station)
Koridor : Meteseh-Ahmad Yani Airport-PRPP
Koridor : Diponegoro University (UNDIP) to Semarang State University (UNNES)
Koridor : Terboyo (Bus Terminal)-Balai Kota (City Hall)
Koridor : Cangkiran-Gunung Pati-Simpang Lima
Koridor : Ahmad Yani Airport-Simpang Lima (night service, 18:00-24:00)
Most interchanging of buses is done at the Balai Kota (City Hall) or SMAN 5 shelter on Jl Pemuda.
The ticket costs Rp3,500 for adults who use electronic money, Rp4,000 for adults who pay in cash and flat Rp2,000 for students. The ticket is valid for as long as you are travelling, but you cannot break your journey. If you get off one bus and get straight on another, the ticket is valid. Keep your ticket when transferring from one corridor to another so that you won't have to buy a new ticket. Some of the less-frequented shelters do not have officials selling tickets, so you have to buy on board. Every bus also has a conductor. This is by far the most visitor-friendly method of going around by public transport.
Central Java provincial government also runs a bus rapid transit route, TransJateng, from Tawang railway station to the Bawen bus terminal, 36.5 km (22.7 mi) away on the southern outskirts of the city. Passing through Semarang Old Town, the main post office, town hall, Tugu Muda, Kariadi hospital. It also passes the Watu Gong Buddhist temple and the Sido Muncul jamu factory. A ticket costs Rp3,500. If you break your journey, you will need to buy another ticket when you get back on. The first bus leaves at 05:00 until 21:00. They run every 15-20 minutes and should do the whole journey in about 90 minutes.
There are plenty of minibuses (locally called angkot or daihatsu) serving other routes. The route is written on the windscreen, and sometimes on the back and side of the vehicle. The route is normally written in the form of 'origin-destination' and sometimes with 'via' information if there is more than one minibus route with the same origin-destination but with a different path in between. For example, the route written as Johar-Sampangan, means it starts in Johar and ends in Sampangan, and vice-versa. Minibus fares are around Rp2,000-3,000. There are two kinds of minibuses, the orange-coloured ones travel longer routes, and the yellow ones travel shorter routes (e.g. from a housing complex to the nearest market or terminal). Ask the conductor or driver before you board about the route and whether it goes where you want to go. This is where you need some rudimentary Indonesian as the person you ask is unlikely to speak English.

By taxi[edit]
Taxis are safe and comfortable, and reasonably priced (starting price Rp4,000).
Make sure you understand the route or ask a friend. Make sure the driver uses the meter ("argo"). If he refuses to use the meter, use another taxi. List of taxi companies:

 Astria, Jl Jatisari 1, ☏ +62 24 746-0940. 
 Blue Bird, Jl Brigjen Sudiarto No. 492, ☏ +62 24 670-1234. Ordering a Blue Bird in Semarang is now possible through a smartphone app. They also link up with the Go-Jek ride service to offer Go-Bluebird.
 Centris Multipersada, Jl Majapahit 583, ☏ +62 24 672-3624. 
 Kosti, Jl Pamularsih 15, ☏ +62 24 761-3333. 
 Pandu Persada Saranamukti, Jl Kaligawe Km 4/46, ☏ +62 24 659-1234. 
 Puri Kencana, Jl Rogojembangan Raya 68, ☏ +62 24 670-5050. 
Online ride-hailing apps[edit]
Using your smartphone, you can now easily hail a GoJek or Grab in Semarang. It is worth investing in a local SIM card with data so you can use the apps. In Semarang, Grab offers Grab Car and Grab Bike, and GoJek offers its full range, including Go-Bluebird, its tie-in with Bluebird Taxis: book a Bluebird using the GoJek app. Because the maps used in the app are not always reliable, drivers tend to call you shortly after they accept the job, to get more precise information. It is helpful to have enough Indonesian language skills to tell them exactly where you are waiting, to be able to describe a useful landmark, and what colour clothes you are wearing.

On foot[edit]
At first glance, central Semarang seems to have wide pavements. On closer inspection, they turn out to be paved with ceramic wall tiles that are lethally slippery when wet. Trees grow out of them, bus shelters take up nearly the whole width, traders start to encroach. Coupled with the hot and humid climate, walking suddenly seems a lot less attractive. What's more, trying to cross the road is borderline suicidal. Many of the main roads in the central area are one way, which turns them into race tracks. Pedestrian crossings, even with traffic lights, are disregarded. There are footbridges in places, but construction is low quality so watch your step on the stairs, and some have railings missing.
The Old Town is the only part of town that can be truly explored on foot. Behind Gereja Blenduk you will find a fascinating warren of streets between colonial offices and warehouses.
You can walk around the open green space of Simpang Lima, but crossing the road to get there is risky.

-6.984110.41022 Lawang Sewu, Jl Pemuda, Sekayu (right on the Tugu Muda roundabout). 07:00-21:00. Lawang Sewu means 'a thousand doors' in Javanese. It has a lot of them, but probably not that many. Built as the headquarters of the Dutch East Indies railway company in 1907, over time it served various purposes. The Dutch reputedly used the basement as a jail and torture centre. During World War II it was used as the Japanese army's headquarters in Semarang, and further atrocities were committed by the Japanese. The attic, with its twin water towers, was used by the military as a badminton court. Reputed to be haunted. Tour guides are available at the building's entrance. Flashlight tours of the basement, with its interesting system of small pools of water to help keep it cool, are a fun scare.   (updated Oct 2022)
-6.9957110.39843 Sam Poo Kong Temple (Kelenteng Sam Poo Kong, Gedung Batu), Jl Simongan No. 129, ☏ +62 24 760-5277.

It was extensively renovated in 2006 to celebrate the 600th anniversary of Cheng Ho's visit. In the entry area, there are a couple of stores that sell Chinese art and objects, including giant candles and, of course, there's a place to eat. This complex is one of the major temples for certain Chinese religions, notably Kong Hu Chu (Confucianism), and is replete with a long stone mural depicting major events of Cheng Ho's time here, as well as several different temples, each with its own specific style and architecture. You can burn an envelope in a special prayer oven, or ask a soothsayer to read fortune-telling sticks for you. The temple area is open to visitors if you pay an additional fee, otherwise, you can see much of it from behind a chain - but the mural is behind the temples - but only those seeking to pray may actually enter the temples.

Around the Old Town[edit]
Gereja Blenduk, built in 1753.
-6.968017110.42787715 Old Town (Kota Lama, Oudstadt). Northern Semarang has many old Dutch colonial buildings. This was where the old walled city was located. The wall is no longer there, but many of the buildings remain. While there are a number specific points of interest, the whole area is atmospheric and interesting for a wander. Early morning or late afternoon offers the coolest parts of the day and the best light for photography. The rundown nature is part of its charm, but the City Council is making concerted efforts to bring it back to life. The numbers of cafes and restaurants is slowly growing. This helps to give life to the area at night also, and there is a semi-permanent bric-a-brac market that is most active during these cooler hours. During certain high tides, the area is flooded. Tackling it is also part of the government's plan, and the flooding is slowly dropping in terms of number and intensity of incidents.  
-6.968312110.42743716 Gereja Blenduk (GPIB Immanuel), Jl Letjen Suprapto 32 (The heart of the Old Town). The name means "domed church". A beautiful Protestant church built in 1753, it is the oldest church in Semarang. It has a baroque organ, a rarity in Indonesia.

Work[edit]
Finding part-time work as a traveller in Indonesia is never easy and will be of questionable legality due to the strict labour laws. You may be in contravention of the terms of your visa.
Having said that, there is always demand for native English speakers to share their skills in some formal or informal capacity. Formal requirements for foreign nationals teaching English in Indonesia are very stringent.
As a manufacturing centre, especially for the export-oriented furniture industries in Semarang and Jepara, you may hear of opportunities for those with the required technical or sales background, with native English language ability.
Be aware that your part-time work may take the place of a full-time job for a competent and experienced Indonesian.

Stay safe[edit]
Semarang is moderately safe. People are nice to strangers, helpful and friendly.
Never touch anyone's head (especially teenagers and older men) as it is considered as "insult" and might invite troubles. In the crowded buses, trains or small cars used as public transportation, "unintended touch" is tolerated. Never look at someone (especially young men) straight in the eyes more than 3 times as it might be considered as "challenging them to fight" (this applies especially in bigger towns/cities). Villagers are more friendly to strangers.
Semarang is neither a small city nor huge city if compared to Jakarta. Everyone is urged to observe universal safety rules such as "only walk in the light-bright areas"; do not attempt to deal with hookers or trans-sexual hookers which are usually done under secluded and dark areas; lady travelers are urged not to travel alone after 23:00 especially in an unknown dark neighborhood, sometimes even in residential areas. Only withdraw a moderate amount of money in an open air ATM.
When riding the public transportation it is not encouraged to wear jewellery, or gaudy and branded or designer watches. Petty thieves are common, but they do not strike when it isn't obvious. During the night if you must use public transportation, look for those units which  have more than a few people riding and do avoid the empty ones. You might want to choose a seat close to the driver.
