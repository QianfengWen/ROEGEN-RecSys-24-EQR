Montemorelos is a small city in the Northern Mexico state of Nuevo León, lying on the banks of the Rio Pilón. The city is best known for its citrus orchards producing several types of oranges as well as grapefruits and tangerines. Visitors appreciate the town's slow pace, traditional feel, and its local cuisine. The town is one of Mexico's Pueblos Mágicos and is a popular weekend destination and highway pitstop along busy federal highway MEX-85 between the U.S. border and Mexico City.


Understand[edit]
The first Spanish settlers to the Rio Pilon valley arrived in the early 17th century, but it wasn't until 1685 that a church (dedicated to St. Matthew) would be built to serve as the focal point for a town to grow up around it. In 1825, the governor of Nuevo Leon decreed that it was now a city and that it should be named Montemorelos in honor of Jose Maria Morelos, hero of the Mexican War of Independence. 
Various types of fruit grow in the orchards around Montemorelos, but oranges are the city's most recognized product. Three types of oranges are grown, each with different harvest times, providing steady, year-round work for fruit growers and pickers. Oranges you might find in Montemorelos are:

Valencia - from May to July
Albérciga - from July to August
Temprana - from October to November
