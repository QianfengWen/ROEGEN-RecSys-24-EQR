Lewisburg is a city of 3,900 people (in 2017) in West Virginia. It was established in 1872, and named for Andrew Lewis, the Virginia colonel who won the Battle of Point Pleasant in 1774. The town was built around a natural spring, which today is enclosed in a stone springhouse near the General Lewis Inn. Today, Lewisburg is a very popular tourist destination due to its historic downtown, specialty shopping, quaint bed-and-breakfasts, and its Civil War connections. Lewisburg is practically adjacent to the nearby resort town of White Sulphur Springs.
