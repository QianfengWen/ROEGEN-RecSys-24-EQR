Youtefa Bridge, the new icon of Jayapura
Downtown Jayapura in 2007
Jayapura is the capital and largest city in Papua, with a population of 315,000 people in 2014. The city has also been known in the past as Hollandia (1910-1962), Kota Baru (1962-1963) and even Sukarnopura (1963-1968).
As the easternmost province (and provincial capital) of Indonesia, it is somewhat far from most of the country's major cities and perhaps contributes to the less modern development of the town. However, with the intensification of development in the Papua province, this city is growing, and attracting investment and tourism.


Understand[edit]
Papua has always been considered the most ignored part of Indonesia, in terms of development and tourism; a reputation that stems from the very far distance from other big cities in the nation. Jayapura began as a trading post nestled on a bay right at the centre of New Guinea, further developed by the Dutch in the 1900s as a port of entry to explore Eastern New Guinea, and gave the name Hollandia which means "the village of the Dutch".
The area houses the frontline of the United States Air Force in World War II by General Douglas MacArthur for the 1945 Philippine Conquest and to  prevent Japan from taking over New Guinea and Australia to its south. After the war though, after Indonesia gained its independence, the Dutch refused to relinquish the territory until a 1962 referendum supervised by the UN gave the territory to Indonesia. The city was renamed "Sukarnopura" for the Indonesian leader's contribution to freeing the land from the Dutch.
The city name reverted to Jayapura before the colonisation in 1968. The Indonesian government's transmigration policy has further populated the area with residents, especially from Java. Jayapura is perhaps the most diverse city you can find in Papua. The traditional Papuan races have blended in well with migrants from other parts of Indonesia.

Orientation[edit]
Jayapura City administratively includes a number of districts. The most populated areas are at the city proper and the Abepura district that is halfway between the airport and the city. Heavy traffic occasionally occurs as plenty of people would commute between the two areas.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
-2.576944140.5161111 Sentani International Airport (DJJ  IATA) (about 30 km west of the city centre). Virtually every national carrier in Indonesia flies from either Jakarta, Denpasar, or Makassar. It also acts as a transit point for flying deeper into the smaller cities and various settlements in Papua. Flights from Jakarta take nearly 6 hours and many include a stopover in Makassar.   
Do not miss the view when you are landing, as the curvy green hills bumps above the blue lake, a good first impression of Papua's unspoiled nature.

Get to/from the airport[edit]
There is a bus served by the state-owned, DAMRI. The fare is Rp50,000 to the downtown of Jayapura.

By car[edit]
From the neighboring Papua New Guinea, you can travel for up to 2 hours from the border crossing at Skouw Checkpoint. While most countries are eligible for a visa waiver (See Indonesia for more details), an Indonesian visa can be arranged at the consulate in either Port Moresby or Vanimo, the last checkpoint before entering Indonesia. Public Motor Vehicles travel regularly between Vanimo and the Wutung border crossing. Once across the Indonesian border there are taxis into Jayapura.
The border town of Skouw is a tourist attraction as it contains markets and exotic ornaments that are from Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. The Indonesian rupiah and Papua New Guinean kina currencies are accepted.
