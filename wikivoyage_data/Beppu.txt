Beppu (別府 Beppu) is a city in Oita prefecture on the island of Kyushu, Japan.  Famous for its visually stunning hot springs (the Hells of Beppu), Beppu is one of Japan's Three Great Hot Springs.


Understand[edit]
Mount Tsurumi
It was also once known as the Las Vegas of Japan, a reference more to its extensive sex industry than gambling.  The city has been attempting to clean up its image, however. To non-Japanese tourists, the sex industry may not be obvious, or even perceivable.
Beppu is along the coast but pressed by the mountains. As a result the city, while not very large, is rather long. Most of the most well-known onsens and the tourist attractions, including most of the Jigoku or "hells", are in the Kannawa area which is almost on the opposite side of the city from the train station. Buses to and from the Hell areas come around every 30 minutes. Many of the onsen are open very late, so many tourists opt to stay in one of the onsen areas.
No, the city doesn't actually have a "spa theme park". Following a whimsical promotional video back in 2016 which got a million views in just a few days, the city did make some bath-themed modifications to an existing amusement park, but only for 3 days, and the rides were much more sensible and sedate than the ones in the video.

Tourist information[edit]
The city has an offcial multilingual guide site. The City Council site also has information about Beppu.

Get in[edit]

By plane[edit]
Oita airport is nearby, from which shuttle buses run to Beppu downtown (¥1450, 40 minutes).
The Fukuoka airport can be also used thanks to the bus service from the airport through the Oita Expressway coming to Kannawa onsen/Beppu downtown (¥2000 in case of 4-coupon ticket, 110 minutes).

By train[edit]
Beppu train station
33.2797131.50041 Beppu Station is on the JR Nippō Main Line.
The Sonic limited express train runs twice an hour from Fukuoka (Hakata Station) and Kokura, stopping at Beppu before terminating in Oita. From Fukuoka takes 2 hours, and if purchased as an individual one-way costs ¥5,570. For a roundtrip on the Sonic, it's better to buy two tickets (nimai kippu) for ¥6,000 (Fukuoka–Beppu) or ¥5,800 (Kokura–Beppu). For two travellers, it's even better to purchase four tickets (yonmai kippu) for ¥10,000 (Fukuoka–Beppu) or ¥9,800 (Kokura–Beppu).
A faster option from Fukuoka, and the obvious choice from Honshu, is to take the San'yo Shinkansen and transfer to the Sonic at Kokura station. From Kokura, you can reach Beppu in 70-80 minutes at a cost of ¥4,230 each way (free with the Japan Rail Pass). From Fukuoka, this saves 15-20 minutes over taking the Sonic the whole way.
An overnight option from Tokyo is to take the 22:00 Sunrise Izumo/Sunrise Seto to Himeji, take the San'yo Shinkansen to Kokura, then take the Sonic to Beppu (12 hours, ¥23,260, or free with JR Pass except for private compartment fees).

By car[edit]
The Oita Expressway runs from the south, passing a few miles to the west of the city. Exit at the Beppu Interchange. National Route 10 runs north-south through the city center, along the shore of Beppu Bay.

By boat[edit]
Uwajima-un'yu ferry company operates frequent service from Yawatahama, with about 6 crossings per day, going to Beppu port.
Diamond Ferries runs a service from Kobe to reasonably nearby Oita, with no stops. It also runs a service from Osaka to Oita, stopping in Matsuyama on the way.
Kansai-kisen operates a service from Osaka direct to Beppu. The overnight service takes about 12 hours, departing at 19:05 and arriving at 06:55.

Information office[edit]
The Foreign Tourist Information Office has three branches in the city center. Two of them (except Beppu Station) offer free internet access.

33.27953131.500391 JR Beppu Station Office, 12-13 Ekimae-cho (Near the east exit of JR Beppu Station), ☏ +81 977-21-6220, ftio@ace.ocn.ne.jp. 09:00-17:00. 
33.27923131.504282 Kitahama office (Plaza), 1-3-17 Kitahama (from Beppu station east exit, walk 5 minutes down the main street in front of you (Ekimae-dori), the office will be on your right side just before the Ginza shopping arcade), ☏ +81 977-23-1119, kankou@ec1.technowave.ne.jp. 10:00-17:00. 
 Kannawa office, 5 Furomoto (in Jigoku-mushi Kohbo in Kannawa), ☏ +81 977-66-3855, beppuftio@gmail.com. 09:00-17:00. 
Get around[edit]
Beppu Myoban bridge
On foot[edit]
The town is walkable.  The Hells may be a bit far for most to find it convenient.  Though, walking is a possibility for those who don't mind it, and are not in a hurry.

By bus[edit]
The Hells and other sites can be easily reached via the tourist-centered bus system.  Departures are outside JR Beppu Station. The Foreign Tourist Information Office inside JR Beppu Station sells one-day bus passes for ¥900 (¥700 students), which is likely the best deal for most.
The office can provide the departure time and number of the next bus going to your destination (if it's the Hells - the next bus will be leaving shortly), as well as maps detailing the route. On the Hells route itself, bus schedules are clearly posted at stops. The longest intervals are ~30 minutes.
If needed, check the "See" section for more specific information on the bus system transversing the Hells area.

See[edit]
Hot spring hells[edit]
Umi-Jigoku (Sea Hell)
Tatsumaki-Jigoku
Beppu's top sight is the eight hells (地獄 Jigoku), multicolored volcanic pits of boiling water and mud, and one geyser. The hells are too hot to be diluted into onsen baths, and they emerge at temperatures ranging from 50 to 99.5 °C (122 to 210 °F). Some of the hells have a natural smell of sulfur — which comes out a bit like rotten eggs.
The eight hells are administered by  The Beppu Jigoku Association, ☏ +81 977-66-1577.  Combination tickets can be purchased at any of the hells for ¥2100 for visits to all eight; if you first purchase an unlimited bus ticket for ¥900 from the Foreign Tourist Office in Beppu train station, you get a coupon book which includes a ¥200 discount for the combination ticket. If purchased separately, admission to each individual hell is ¥400. Hours for the eight hells are 08:00-17:00, although Tatsumaki-Jigoku doesn't close until its geyser has had its last eruption at the end of the day, so it may be open a little bit later than the rest. All eight hells can be seen at a fairly leisurely pace in about 2½ hours.
Three of the hells are next door to each other, and the others are within a few minutes walk. Take bus #2, #5, #9, #41, or #43 from JR Beppu Station to the Umijigoku-mae stop.  The foreign tourist office in Beppu train station can tell you the next bus that is leaving for the area, as well as provide a map of the route.

33.316851131.4688391 Umi-Jigoku (海地獄 Sea Hell). Blue-green fuming pond 
33.315075131.4692112 Oniishibozu-Jigoku (鬼石坊主地獄 Shaven Monk's Head Hell). 
33.315667131.4707943 Yama-Jigoku (山地獄 Mountain Hell). 
33.316256131.4723784 Kamado-Jigoku (かまど地獄 Boiling Hell).

33.315289131.4741586 Shiraike-Jigoku (白池地獄 White Pond Hell). 
Two more hells are about 2.5 km away. Either catch a bus back to the Kannawa Onsen bus stop or walk a couple minutes down the main road or Miyuki-zaka to Kannawa Onsen street, and take a left. From the Kannawa Onsen stop, take bus #16 (6 min).

33.327125131.4782587 Chinoike-Jigoku (血の池地獄 Blood Pond Hell). 
33.327014131.4794338 Tatsumaki-Jigoku (龍巻地獄 Geyser Hell). 
The Tatsumaki-Jigoku is a geyser that goes off every 30–40 minutes for a period of about 5 minutes. One trick in using your time efficiently for the final two hells is to first go to the Tatsumaki-Jigoku and find out when the next eruption occurs. If you just missed the last one, then go see the Chinoike-Jigoku first.

Do[edit]
Onsen[edit]
Downtown Beppu offers several hot springs to visit. You can't wander too far, though, without seeing the equally promiscuous sex shops, which will usually be quite blatant on the streets. If you're going to visit a hot spring with children, and you're worried about this, plan ahead.

Takegawara Onsen
33.277475131.5060231 Takegawara Onsen (竹瓦温泉), 16-23 Motomachi, ☏ +81 977-67-3880. 06:30-22:30. A Meiji-era classic. The hot bath is extraordinarily hot, and signs gently remind you that the regulars like it that way. If you're not in a hurry, take a dip after you've been buried up to your neck in hot sand on the other side of the building. Tickets come with a yukata. Step into the changing room to stash your valuables, change into your yukata, head through the curtain, and then lay down in the sand pit (with the yukata on); an attendant will be along to shovel hot sand on you shortly. (Cameras are welcome — they're happy to take photos of you while you're buried.) After ten minutes or so, you'll emerge from the earth and shower back in the changing area. It's between Ekimae-dori and Nagarekawa-dori, one block before the intersection with Route 10. Tickets are ¥100 for the hot bath, ¥1000 to include the sand bath. Discount coupons may be available from some of the neighboring hotels.

Hot spring well
Yufuin, nearby, offers even more hot springs.
Beppu can serve as a resting point before or after a trip to Mount Aso. The Kyushu Oudan Bus departs for Mount Aso from a depot about a block and a half east of JR Beppu Station on Ekimae-dori.
Usa - Home to Usa Shrine and the African Safari
Oita - Home to Takasakiyama, about half-way between Oita and Beppu, where a colony of over 500 Japanese macaques can be visited in a pleasant surrounding. The macaques walk among you and one of the best sights is feeding time when a frenzy starts. For photos and video the best time to visit is from morning to early afternoon when the sun is behind you. At the base of the mountain is the visitors' center and Oita's Marine Palace, an aquarium with a dolphin show and trained fish. Those going to both can get a discount ticket at the Beppu Tourist Office in Beppu Station.
