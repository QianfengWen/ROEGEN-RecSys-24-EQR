Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
Nemuro Station (根室駅) is the final stop on the JR Nemuro Main Line, called the Hanasaki Line between Kushiro and Nemuro. Service is sparse: two daily rapid trains (just over two hours from Kushiro) and six locals (just over three hours). Add on another four hours from Sapporo. Those who want to make a day trip from Kushiro to Nemuro and back should board the Hanasaki Rapid train leaving Kushiro at 05:55 (arr. 08:13) or 11:13 (arr. 13:38) and departing Nemuro at 11:12 (arr. 13:20) or 21:44 (arr. 23:53).
The second-to-last stop, Higashi-Nemuro Station (東根室駅), may be of interest to train buffs as the easternmost station in all of Japan. Several of the train cars and stations along the Hanasaki Line are emblazoned with characters from the Lupin III manga series, whose creator, Monkey Punch (Kazuhiko Katō), was born in Hamanaka, about halfway between Kushiro and Nemuro.

By plane[edit]
Nakashibetsu Airport (SHB IATA) has shuttle service to Sapporo (Chitose) and Tokyo (Haneda).

43.388611145.78253 Nemuro Peninsula Chashi. The Ainu built over 500 Chashi, often referred to as forts/castles, during the 16th-18th centuries all over Hokkaido Island. With 30 of them here, the Nemuro Peninsula has the largest concentration of chashi. Twenty-four of these chashi have been labeled National Historic Sites and are also the first entry on Japan's Top 100 Castles list, so efforts have been made to preserve them. The chashi were built by the ocean near cliffs, mostly semi-circular in shape but sometimes rectangular, with only mud walls and a moat separating them from the outside. Their purpose is still debated. Some believe they were built for rituals and only used as forts when necessary or in later periods while others believe they were built specifically in preparation for war with the Japanese. In spite of their designations, many of the sites are unmarked or inaccessible to the public, so it is not possible to visit all of them. A few, such as the Onnemoto Chashi and Notsukamafu Chashi, have been marked and those that are accessible but unmarked can be visited with planning. No structures remain at any of the sites, but you can still see the outlines and layout at some of the better-preserved sites..   (updated Feb 2024)
