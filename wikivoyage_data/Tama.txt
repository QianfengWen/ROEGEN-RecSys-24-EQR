Tama Toshi Monorail
Tama (多摩市 Tama-shi) is a western suburban city of Tokyo. One of the first things you see on arrival at Tama Center train station is a glowing sign proclaiming "Tama is Hello Kitty's Town". Although there is more to Tama, getting up-close-and-personal with Sanrio's signature feline is the main draw for visitors to this part of Tokyo.


Understand[edit]
Tama is a sprawling place, but the central, city-like bit of it is, appropriately enough, known as Tama Center (多摩センター), and Tama's three train/monorail lines converge here.

Tourist information site[edit]
The city has official info pages in English on Guidoor.

Get in[edit]
The Keio and Odakyu private railways operate out of Shinjuku Station. Using either of these lines, you can reach Tama in about 40 minutes.
On the Keio line (¥330), take a Rapid (kaisoku; 快速) or Express (kyūkō; 急行) train bound for Hashimoto, and get off at Keio Tama Center (京王多摩センター). These trains generally leave from Shinjuku every 10 minutes during most of the day, with departures alternating between the main Keio platforms, and the adjacent Toei Shinjuku Line platforms. (Toei Shinjuku Line trains merge with the Keio line at Sasazuka.)
On the Odakyu line (¥360), the stop for Tama is, appropriately, Odakyu Tama Center (小田急多摩センター). You'll need to change to a Tama Line train at Shin-Yurigaoka (新百合ヶ丘).
The Tama Toshi Monorail is less useful for those coming from central Tokyo; it connects to the JR Chuo Line at Tachikawa.

While it's not spectacularly large, the conditions seem more humane than at the older Ueno Zoo, which many western visitors find downright depressing. Directly across the street from the entrance to the Tama Zoo is a small train museum (Keio Rail Land), including a very large model train set. free. 
35.623399139.4227352 Tama Center (多摩センター). "Tama Center" is the central commercial area for the huge Tama New Town districts, not a single mall. A major shopping area, and if you're this far from central Tokyo, it's probably worth your while to do some shopping here before making a special trip all the way to Shinjuku or Ginza. Musicians, jugglers and other performers often play at the station, and the malls are illuminated for Christmas from November to the New Year.
