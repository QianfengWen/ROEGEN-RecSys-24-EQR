Leigh-on-Sea is a beautiful old fishing port on the London side of Southend-on-Sea on the south coast of Essex. Visitor venues in Leigh can be divided into three zones. The two key points for visitors are firstly the old town, by the sea, with its pubs, eateries and a very small beach. Secondly the Broadway - the high street at the top of the hill, with independent shops, bars and restaurants.
Annual events in Leigh typically revolve around one or both of these hubs.
Lastly, you have the London Road, less glamorous, but home to a few popular pubs, bars and restaurants, including one in the Michelin Guide.

Sunset over Canvey Island
Twice voted the Happiest Place to Live in Great Britain in Rightmove's "Happy at Home Index" 2016 and 2018, the town boasts a vibrant shopping hub, bars, restaurants, heritage, and a variety of open spaces from parks to nature reserves.
Visitors flock to the old town in the summer to enjoy the long and balmy summer evenings with a pint and some seafood, watching the sun set over Canvey Island. The tide goes out for miles (hence the need for neighbouring Southend's record breaking pleasure pier.

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
Leigh-on-Sea railway station
51.5410.641 Leigh-on-Sea railway station.   
From London Fenchurch Street (London's most hidden away terminus), take the c2c train to Leigh-on-Sea. It's about 45–50 minutes, so long as you take the direct train (via Basildon). Tilbury Loop trains take about 20 minutes more, and are best avoided.
Alternatively, pick up the c2c train from West Ham, which is on the Jubilee line, District Line and Docklands Light Rail, or from Barking or Upminster, both on the District Line.

By road[edit]
If you stay on the A13 travelling east from London, you'll arrive in Leigh. Alternatively, at the Saddlers Farm Interchange, follow the signs to Southend and turn off when you see signs to Leigh-on-Sea.

Get around[edit]

The old town is best enjoyed on foot. There are car parks at the station and off Belton Way. On quieter days, you can actually park next to the beach in the old town, but at popular times, you've no chance. The old town is not pedestrianised, so keep an eye open for slow moving cars as you stroll down the cobbled street.
The Broadway is a busy high street, with few parking restrictions. The 21, 21B and 26 bus run through town and may be a better option.
Buses run along the London Road. Google Maps has fully integrated public transport help in this area, but if you'd rather check routes and timetables, you'll need to look at the websites for each of the bus companies:
