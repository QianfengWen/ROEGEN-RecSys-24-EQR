Understand[edit]
History[edit]
The fall of a large meteorite significantly modified the relief of Charlevoix, creating a crater 54 km in diameter occurred nearly 400 million years ago; it is the eleventh largest identified impact site on earth. The impact zone would be located along the St. Lawrence River; 60% of the Astroblème de Charlevoix covers the north shore of the river and 40% is located under the water of the river. The astrobleme begins on the southwest side a few kilometers west of Baie-Saint-Paul, up to Cap-à-l'Aigle, located on the east bank of the Malbaie River, in La Malbaie . In the northern part, the rim of the crater is located north of the village of Saint-Urbain; coming from the borough of La Baie (Ville-de-Saguenay) by road 381, travellers enter the astrobleme when the road descends from the Parc national des Grands-Jardins to head towards the village of Saint-Urbain. The eastern rim of the crater extends from Cap-à-l'Aigle up north, on the east side of the Malbaie River.
The centre of the astrobleme would be the Mont des Éboulements (summit at 768 m), formed by the effect of the raising of the bottom of the crater following the impact. Since this impact, the crater has been strongly metamorphosed under the effect of various erosion agents, making it more difficult to recognize its outline, particularly the part immersed in the St. Lawrence River. Consequently, experts define this ancient impact structure as the astrobleme. Inaugurated in 2014, an interpretation centre dedicated to the Charlevoix astrobleme is open to the public; this interpretation centre is housed in the former Club House of the Manoir Richelieu in La Malbaie.

Geography[edit]
The centre of the village of Clermont (altitude of 50 m) is 6.4 km (direct line) from the La Malbaie bridge, which is located at the mouth of the Malbaie river. From the course of the Berges Alexis le Trotteur (downstream of the village), the Malbaie River meanders in five loops, to its mouth.
