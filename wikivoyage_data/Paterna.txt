Torre Mudèjar
Paterna is a city in Valencia (province). Paterna is known primarily for being a bedroom community of Valencia, for its cave dwellings, and for its Moors and Christians celebration which culminates with the Cordà.



Understand[edit]
The area is 5 km northwest of Valencia, and has been inhabited since Neolithic times due to its advantageous location near the Turía River. The town was established as a Roman estate with villa, named Paternus (from Latin meaning 'of the father'). Later during the Moorish period the growing settlement was known for agriculture and for ceramics, which continued following the Christian reconquista. The expulsion of the Moriscos in the early 17th century, however, led to depopulation and a major economic downturn, along with the cessation of ceramics production; the city did not recover until the beginning of the 19th century.

39.50284-0.440011 Torre Mudèjar (Torre de Paterna / Tower of Paterna). Sa Su 11:00-14:00. This defensive tower is believed to have been built in the Moorish period sometime between the 11th and 12th centuries, as a square tower. It was remodeled during the 13th and 14th centuries, when it was converted to a circular tower, and it is this aspect which is unique among the watchtowers in the Valencia Community. The tower can be accessed via a circular external staircase, and the view from the top is worth the climb as on clear days it is possible to see as far north as Sagunto and as far south as Dénia. Free.   (updated Jan 2016)
39.50303-0.439132 Parque de la Torre, Carrer Coves de la Torre. It is believed that the custom of living in cave dwellings is Moorish in origin, and was not uncommon in areas of Andalucia.
