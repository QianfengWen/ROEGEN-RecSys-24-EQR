Consett is a former steel-making town in County Durham, in the hills 14 miles southwest of Newcastle. In 2021 the population was 29,885. 


Understand[edit]
"Consett" derives from Cunecsheafod, Cunec's headland - it's on a steep bank above the River Derwent at 900 ft / 270 m elevation, distinctly chilly in winter. It was an insignificant hamlet until the 18th century, then mushroomed with industries based on the local coal, iron ore and limestone. Britain's earliest steel industry was here, specialising in "sharps" such as swords and cutlery until Sheffield captured that trade. In the 20th century its main product was steel plates and girders for construction and ship-building, and its skies were a red haze of iron ore dust and furnace smoke. In the late 20th century British steel became uneconomic, in spite of subsidy, and an entire way of life here collapsed when the steelworks closed.

By road from the south follow A1 to Scotch Corner then A68 to Castleside then A692 into Consett. You could also stay on A1 to Durham then take A690 / A691.
The nearest railway stations are in Newcastle upon Tyne and  Durham, both on the London Kings Cross - Edinburgh main line, and with buses to Consett. A taxi from either might cost £40-50 in 2024. There's talk of restoring the railway, axed in 1980, but nothing's happened. 
Go Northeast Bus X45 runs from Newcastle every 30 min, taking an hour via Metrocentre, Winlaton Mill, Rowlands Gill, Ebchester, Shotley Bridge and Blackhill. X71 runs hourly and takes an hour via Gateshead`, Lobley Hill, Sunniside, Burnopfield, Medomsley and Leadgate.

54.8529-1.8321 Consett Bus Station is central in town. It's a covered mall.

Get around[edit]
You need wheels to get out of the grubby town and enjoy the moors and Derwent Valley. Roads are switchback as they cross the valleys of rivers flowing out of the moors - cyclists will especially enjoy screeching on the brakes on A68 below Castleside while contemplating the grinding ascent ahead.
Taxis in town are Atlas (+44 1207 509770) and Consett Cars (+44 1207 502277), both based at the bus station.

See[edit]
Christ Church is at 62 Middle St, 100 yards west of the bus station. It was built in 1866 with a squat cod-Norman tower, which is at risk of collapse.
54.8455-1.83681 Terris Novalis is a sculpture on the site of Consett Steel Works, closed in 1980. It's two metal structures, a theodolite and an engineer's level, 20 ft tall and visible for miles around. Terris Novalis means "newly cultivated land" and is meant to symbolise the remediation of this brownfield area. It's on C2C coast-to-coast cycle path and accessible 24 hours.
54.8447-1.88492 Wharnley Burn Waterfall is reached by a short but quaggy walk west up the riverbank from the A68 bridge. Gorgeous colours here in autumn.
Allensford Foundry is crumbling masonry seen from the riverside going east from the bridge.
54.893-1.8423 Ebchester completely buries a Roman fort and settlement; it's named for Æbbe of Coldingham who only turned up in the 7th century. St Ebba's church is 11th century, re-using stone from the fort.
54.9031-1.79824 Derwentcote Steel Furnace is one of Britain's oldest. An iron works stood here from 1719, but you need to add just the right trace of carbon to turn iron into steel, far stronger. A "cementation" plant was built here in the 1730s, using Swedish iron ore to make high-grade cutlery. Cementation was the main technology in 18th century England until supplanted by "puddling", which reduced rather than added carbon, and which in turn was replaced by Bessemer blast furnaces. Derwentcote closed in the 1880s, as it was obsolete and with poor transport. It's simply a large cottage off A694, free to view outside any time but with no interior access. English Heritage conduct guided walks around this area.
