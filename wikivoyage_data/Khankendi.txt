WARNING: Wars in the 2020s have created danger from unexploded ordnance in parts of Karabakh. Until these are cleared you should stick to well travelled roads, and check travel conditions before any visit.

Khankendi (Azerbaijani: Xankəndi), formerly Stepanakert (Armenian: Ստեփանակերտ), is a nice small city in Karabakh. The city is controlled by Azerbaijan since 2023; much of the information in this article is likely out of date.


Understand[edit]

There is some dispute whether the first settlement in this area was started by Armenians in 5th century and thus was called Vararakn ("rapid spring" in Armenian) or by a Karabakh khan in 18th century, and was thus called Khankendi (Turkic for "the khan's village").
The city was renamed in 1923 to Stepanakert to honour Stepan Shahumyan, ethnic Armenian leader. It also became the capital of the newly created Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast. Shortly after that municipal authorities adopted a new city layout designed by the prominent Armenian architect Alexander Tamanian, which is still in use.
During the war, the city suffered immense damage from Azeri bombardment which continued from 1992 to 1994.

Talk[edit]
Armenian is the universal language, but Russian is spoken widely, and it may always be used for everyday contacts with locals. Older locals are likely to speak Azeri and therefore understand some Turkish, but they may be hesitant to use it.
English is becoming more and more popular since most children now learn it at school. Be prepared that most children but also many younger adults want to improve their English and therefore try to engage you in English-language conversation while you walk around. This can be lot of fun and you are likely to get valuable information about accommodation or bus connections that way. In the ministries, there is always at least one person who can speak English fluently. If not, they call somebody. The same applies in larger shops like electronic markets or phone stores.

Get in[edit]
Stepanakert Airport
Central Bus Station
Tourists must obtain a Nagorno-Karabakh visa, see Nagorno-Karabakh#Get in for more details.

By bus[edit]
39.824746.76411 Bus station. (updated Feb 2015)
All major Nagorno-Karabakh cities including Askeran (23 km), Berdzor (58 km), Hadrut (71 km), Karvachar (120 km), Martakert (69 km), and Martuni (41 km) are served.

From Armenia[edit]
The overall best budget option to get to Stepanakert are marshrutkas.
From specific destinations:

Yerevan – They go every morning from the Kilikia Bus Station. Normally, there are departures at 06:00, 07:00, and 08:00, sometimes at 09:00, but these are approximate departure time, and you are better off preferring the earlier hours. Also, arrive sufficiently before departure (at least 20 min) to find a free chair. It might be that your luggage will be nested on the roof of the bus. The journey is slow and can take up to eight hours. Tickets cost about 5,000;confirm with local ahead.
There is an alternate route once a day at 08:00 (confirm at the bus station) going back to Yerevan, running via the northern road passing by lake Sevan also for 4,500 dram (Jun 2019). Ensure that if you take this route that the driver stops at the police checkpoint so you can get your visa, otherwise you will need to register at the police station.
Sisian – One daily marshrutka departs at 10:30 on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, stopping at Goris en route. 4,000 dram.
Goris – The latter marshrutka departs Goris at around 11:10 from the intersection of the highway and Mesrop Mashtots St. Also, there is supposed to be a direct one at 10:30 from Goris, but this might just be the Sisian one. Either way, they take 2 hr and cost 2,000-2,500 dram. The return to Goris is at 14:30.
If you miss the one from Sisian or Goris, you can wait at the highway for a marshrutka to pass through from Yerevan (see above); they'll pick you up if there is space. Don't pay more then you would from Sisian or Goris.

By car[edit]
Driving is also possible, and cars rented in Armenia can be driven to Karabakh and back without issues. The M-12 highway connects with Armenia via Goris and is the most common way to reach Stepanakert. The more adventurous can drive through the Karvajar pass via Vardenis which was re-paved in 2016. The pass is only open in summer, that means as early as April; ask at the embassy in Yerevan. To reach the pass, follow road M-11 on the Armenian side. Both roads offers amazing views of wild life, deep forests, dramatic cliffs and several ancient monuments on the way. Few people speak anything other than Armenian and some Russian so prepare yourself with a dictionary.

By thumb[edit]
Hitchhiking is safe and common enough in the countryside. Offering a small sum for your ride is polite, though in most cases it won't be accepted.

By plane[edit]
The Stepanakert airport was supposed to begin regular flights to Yerevan, but the dispute with Azerbaijan seems to be preventing the flights. The only carrier which has announced it will fly is the state-owned Artsakh Air with their newly purchased Bombardier CRJ200 jets.
39.90138946.7869441 Stepanakert Airport, Ivanyan town, NE 10 km of Stepanakert. The airport remains closed due to political reasons.   (updated Apr 2020)

By train[edit]
Since 1994 all train connections have been suspended.

Get around[edit]

There are several city bus lines. The price was 100 dram in March 2015.
There are lots of taxis ranging from a very old cars to a brand new Mercedes. Taxi prices are a bit higher than in Yerevan and increase if you leave the city for the countryside. Drivers tend to be honest, but using a meter is always a good idea.
