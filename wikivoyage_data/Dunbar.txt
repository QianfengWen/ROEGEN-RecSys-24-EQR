Dunbar is a harbour town in  East Lothian, on the south-east coast of central Scotland. In 2021 its population was 10,400.


Understand[edit]
The original medieval harbour lay a couple of miles west, where the Biel Water flows out: that was "Belhaven" where the brewery now stands. Oliver Cromwell was unimpressed by its muddy creek and ordered construction of the harbour in Dunbar that bears his name. This in turn was outgrown by the 19th century, when the Victoria Harbour was created alongside. This necessitated cutting through the red sandstone of the headland, so it's a striking harbour entrance, with what's left of the castle teetering above it.
Dunbar was the birthplace of the conservationist John Muir (1838-1914). Local natural features and wildlife had already fascinated him by age 11 when his family moved to the USA. There he was to discover the wilds and set about their preservation through the agency of the United States national parks.

Lauderdale House at the foot of High Street was a mansion of 1730, extended by the Adams, and converted to a barracks in 1855. It's now private apartments.
The harbours are scenic. A drawbridge spans the channel between Cromwell and Victoria harbours - vehicles may use this for unloading, but don't park on the outer pier, and the bridge is usually agape in winter. The battery was built in 1781 to repel privateers.
56.0053-2.52083 Dunbar Castle. 24 hrs. Stump of what was once among the strongest fortresses in Scotland. After various assaults it was "slighted" in 1567 to prevent use by rebels, and the construction of the Victorian harbour carved through it. The miniature cod-castle at its foot was built in 1913 to measure mean sea level, the reference point for Ordnance Survey maps. It's now the Harbourmaster's office. Free.   (updated Jul 2023)
55.9883-2.5074 The Dunbear is a five metre steel mesh sculpture of a brown bear rearing up on its hind legs. Erected in 2019 at the south edge of town, it commemorates Yosemite and other US wildernesses protected by John Muir, but it looks like it's minded to raid ASDA supermarket next door.
55.9692-2.40685 Torness Nuclear Power Station, Torness EH42 1QS (on A1 five miles east of Dunbar), ☏ +44 1368 873000. M-Th 9AM-4PM. Twin Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactors, pushing 600 MW apiece into the National Grid since 1988, and planned to continue to 2030. You can simply drop into the visitor centre, but you'll get much more from joining an organised tour (minimum age 8), which needs to be booked 3-4 weeks in advance. Free, but there ought to be a £50 spot penalty for anyone making Homer Simpson jokes, which by now have half-decayed to lead.   (updated Jul 2023)
55.9556-2.4266 Innerwick Castle is a gnarly stump 5 miles east of town. It was built in the 14th century; in the 17th the Covenanters used as a base to harry Cromwell.
Bass Rock is the bird-limed lump out to sea northwest. Sail around it, and perhaps even land, on boat trips from North Berwick. Due north on a clear day you can also make out the cliffs of the Isle of May, a bird sanctuary. It's usually reached from Anstruther in Fife but there are summer boat trips from North Berwick.
Do[edit]
Statue of John Muir as a boy
 West Beach. The beach beyond the Biel Water outlet is sandy. It's reached at low tide by the "bridge to nowhere" but is cut off from town at high tide. The C2C Surf School for surfing is based beside the bridge. (updated Jan 2024)
 John Muir Way. A long-distance coastal trail starting outside his birthplace. Westbound it's an easy scenic stroll past Winterfield Park and golf course to Belhaven Bay and John Muir Country Park. "The Bridge to Nowhere" crosses Biel Water; at high tide, its approaches are inundated, so it's an odd sight. The recommended route then swings inland, but at low tide, you can stay on the shore and splosh across the outflow of the River Tyne. All routes then trend north via Whitekirk and Tantallon Castle to North Berwick, but there are some ratty sections where you have to join the busy A198. The original trail ended at Edinburgh, but in 2014 it was extended all the way to Helensburgh on the west coast. (updated Jan 2024)
 Berwickshire Coastal Path. Or "John Muir Link" is nowadays the name of the coastal trail eastbound, soon trending south. It used to be considered part of the John Muir Way. As you leave Dunbar, Torness looks like an obstruction, but there's a walkway that takes you through it. (A surprising number of anglers come here, as fish are drawn by the warm reactor coolant outflow.) You stay in the low-lying country to Cove near Cockburnspath, the eastern terminus of the Southern Upland Way. It's then a very scenic but rugged hike along the cliffs and coves through St Abbs, Eyemouth and Burnmouth; then the terrain calms down and the border near Berwick-upon-Tweed is an anti-climax. (updated Jan 2024)
 Scuba diving. Boats can be launched 2 hours before or after high tide. Shore divers can enjoy the harbour wall and the J-hole, where squat lobsters and other beasties wave their claws at you. Some 200 m offshore are The Yetts. You need to be self-sufficient on kit, there are no hire, repair, or air facilities here. And try not to haul ashore at Fool's Beach, to be mocked by tourists sitting on the harbour wall above. (updated Jan 2024)
 Dunbar Leisure Pool, Castle Park EH42 1EU (by harbour), ☏ +44 1620 820655. M-Th 9AM-9PM, F-Su 9AM-5PM. Council-run swimming pool with flumes and wave pool. Also has a sauna, steam room and gym. (updated Jul 2023)

It's busy whenever the Open is held at nearby Gullane, as it's used for qualifying rounds. Visitor round £145, day £200. (updated Jul 2023)
 Winterfield Golf Club, St Margarets, North Rd EH42 1AU (Northwest edge of town), ☏ +44 1368 862280. On the coast west side of town, yellow tees 4817 yards, par 65, visitor £33. (updated Jul 2023)
