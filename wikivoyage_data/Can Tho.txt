Can Tho's famous Floating Market
Can Tho (or Cantho; Vietnamese: Cần Thơ) is the biggest city of the Mekong Delta, in Vietnam with an estimated population of 1.6 million in 2019. The name comes from "cầm thi giang", river of poems. It is also referred to as "Tay Do" meaning "western capital". The city is famous for its floating markets, Buddhist pagodas, delicious food, fresh fruit, its large student population, and welcoming atmosphere.


Understand[edit]
Can Tho is on the south bank of the Hậu River, the bigger branch of the Mekong River. It is in the vicinity of Sóc Trăng, 1½ hours from Long Xuyen, 3 hours from Châu Đốc, and Rạch Giá, about 6 hours from Cà Mau, and 169 km (3 hours) from Ho Chi Minh City.
Can Tho is the biggest city in the Mekong Delta. Although it has been developing fast, it retains its charm as the center of a rural area, as urban development is taking place in a rather orderly manner. Can Tho has a reputation for being a welcoming place, where everybody is smiling and welcoming. Indeed the Vietnamese in the Mekong Delta have a saying that goes:
"Cần Thơ gạo trắng nước trong
Ai đi tới đó lòng không muốn về"
"Cần Thơ, white rice, clear waters,
All who come wish never to leave."
The climate is tropical and monsoonal with two seasons: rainy, from May thru Nov; and dry, from Dec-Apr. Average annual humidity is 83%, rainfall 1,635 mm, and temperature 27°C.

Get in[edit]
As a regional hub, it is easy to get to Can Tho from cities in the Mekong Delta. There are buses from all the big cities and minibuses from the smaller ones. If you arrive from Cambodia, you will probably stop in Chau Duc and catch a bus to Can Tho there. There is also one bus line directly from Phnom Penh once a day. It is difficult, not to say impossible, to get in by car from Cambodia as a tourist. That likely also applies to bicycles and motorbikes.
Can Tho is 34 km from Vinh Long, 62 km from Long Xuyen, 63 km from Soc Trang, 104 km from Mytho, 116 km from Rach Gia, 117 km from Chau Doc, 169 km from Ho Chi Minh City and 179 km from Camau.

By plane[edit]
10.085278105.7119441 Can Tho International Airport (VCA  IATA). Has a large international terminal with convenient facilities. Flights are to Hanoi and Phu Quoc on Vietnam Airlines, and Con Dao with flights on Vasco Vietnam Airlines.   (updated May 2019)
By bus[edit]
Phuong Trang intercity bus
Many operators serve Can Tho from cities in the Mekong Delta up to the center and north of Vietnam. You may have a short stop in Ho Chi Minh City. Most travelers arrive in Can Tho from Ho Chi Minh City.
From Ho Chi Minh City, buses serving Can Tho leave every 1–2 hours around the clock from the Western Bus Station (Bến Xe Miền Tây). Prices are USD4-7. From downtown, travel operators will quote you about double this price, but they will include a transfer to the bus station. Smaller, more local, buses from Saigon to Can Tho leave in the morning.
There are three operators serving routes from Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) and other destinations: Thanh Buoi, Phuong Trang, and Mai Linh. The big operators also have a departure point in the centre of the city on Le Hong Phong St, from where shuttle buses will take you to Bến Xe Miền Tây. You can take a taxi to Le Hong Phong St in District 10. Look for the office of Thanh Buoi (white background logo with a flower), Phuong Trang (red signs) or Mai Linh (all green) or go straight to Mien Tay bus station in District 6. The taxi from District 1 costs around USD12 (May 2012).
With most operators you will get a small bottle of water included in your ticket price. Bigger buses offer air-con, and also Vietnamese films and music shows, usually perceived as too loud for Western ears.

 Mai Linh Buses. Has a good reputation as an operator of buses and taxis. The service to Can Tho will stop for a food break for half an hour on the way. The ride takes 4 hours. The company provides free water. Mai Linh has stopped providing shuttle services for customers in HCMC but they'll send a mini-van to pick you up if you book through your hotel in Can Tho. Ho Chi Minh City 130,000 dong (Aug 2014). 
 Phuong Trang Buses (FUTA). Has the largest number of services to Can Tho daily. Bright orange offices in city. There is a stop for 15 minutes in the huge Phuong Trang service station which has well maintained toilets and a few restaurants. The ride takes 3½-4 hours. The operator provides free water. In Can Tho a shuttle bus will take you to your final destination if you have the address of your hotel ready. This is included in the price of your ticket. To get your free transfer head into the Phoung Trang Building after exiting the bus. There a staff member will help you onto a minibus. Ensure he is a staffer and not a taxi driver. The same is true for departing trips. Contact your hotel to ask FUTA bus to send a free shuttle bus to get you to the Central bus station where you can head to your next destination. Cost from HCMC (Dec 2019): 130,000 dong for seated buses, 145,000 dong for sleeping buses (Limousine). (updated Nov 2019)
 Thanh Buoi Buses. Provides the fastest service to Can Tho as the bus stops for only 10 minutes on the way from Ho Chi Minh City. The ride takes about 3-4 hours. Upon arrival in Can Tho, shuttle buses take you to your final destination inside the city. Have the address of your hotel ready. The shuttle buses are paid for as part of your ticket. From HCMC, 125,000 dong (Mar 2014). 
By motorbike, car, or taxi[edit]
Nguyen Trai Street
By chauffeured car, allow about 1½ hours from Sóc Trăng, about 3 hours from Châu Đốc, about 3½ hours from Rạch Giá (85,000 dong, Apr 2012), less than 4 hours from Ho Chi Minh City (169 km, 100,000 dong), about 6 hours from Cà Mau and about 1½ hours from Long Xuyen. It is possible to rent a car for USD70-150 for a one-way trip (or return trip on the same day) for 2-3 passengers from Ho Chi Minh City to Can Tho. A driver is included in the price. If you want to drive yourself, you should check terms well in advance.
You might be slightly faster by motorbike than by car depending on your driving. It is quite easy to rent a motorbike in the tourist areas of Ho Chi Minh City, District 1. Most rental shops will rent a motorbike to you if you can show a driving license from any country. They may not ask for a license at all. You are only covered by accident insurance if your driving license is valid in Vietnam. Most European licenses are not automatically accepted. You might need to take an additional test with Vietnamese authorities in order to comply with the local rules.
It's also possible to rent a taxi for about almost the same price as a car for a 1-way trip from Ho Chi Minh City to Can Tho. Try hiring a Vinasun or Mai Linh taxi.

By boat[edit]
Apart from overnight boat cruises for tourists, there are no scheduled boat services to Can Tho. This is because driving time to Can Tho has been reduced to less than 4 hours with the opening of the Can Tho Bridge in 2011 and the completion of the motorway around HCMC.

Get around[edit]
It is easy to get around in Can Tho by motorbike or bicycle. Mai Linh and Happy Taxi are the two main taxi operators of the city. If you want to travel on the river, you can easily rent a boat service at Ninh Kieu Pier. There are also ferries to surrounding areas here. Can Tho is a big city, but the centre can be easily explored on foot (đi bộ). Most hotels will offer you a map.

See[edit]
Ninh Kieu Park
Munirensay Temple
10.03314105.788621 Ninh Kieu Park & Riverfront (Downtown, on Hai Ba Trung Rd). Ninh Kieu Park is a city park situated along the Can Tho River, stretching from the ferry terminal at Nguyen An Ninh Rd to the Ninh Kieu Hotel at the end of Hai Ba Trung Rd. Although the park sports some greenery, one of its most noticeable features is a public square surrounding a large statue of Ho Chi Minh. The other big attraction is Ninh Kieu Tourist Market, which houses souvenir vendors, cafes and restaurants. Just outside the market, you'll also find a ticket booth, selling boat trips up the river to places like Cai Rang Floating Market. The park is a busy place in the evenings, when locals gather to hang out, play badminton, breakdance, or sit and eat sweet bean chè. The Night Market on Nguyen An Ninh and Chau Van Liem streets is a good place to look for bargains, trà sữa milk tea, and a variety of street food. Plenty of restaurants dot Hai Ba Trung Street near the park, too, so you'll invariably find what you need if you look around. 
 Xuan Khanh Quarter (City centre, part of the Ninh Kieu District). In the 18th century the quarter was named Tham Tướng after General Tham Tướng who fought the Siamese troops who were advancing from Ha Tien in 1772. The name of the place was changed after the Vietnam War to reflect the ideology of the new regime in power. 
Mau Than St is the central street of Xuan Khan and famous as the longest street in the Mekong Delta stretching for over 30 km. The street is named after the Tet Offensive, launched on Vietnamese New Year, 30 Jan 1968. In Vietnamese, the offensive is called Tết Mậu Thân (hence the name "Mau Than", meaning "year of the monkey"). Xuan Khanh Market at the start of the street is a daily stop for many citizens. Mau Than is also centre for the local community as there are two churches and the Quang Duc Pagoda just a few hundred metres distance. Depending on the day of your visit you may see traditionally dressed monks or a celebration service at one of the churches that often reach into the street in the evening.
Xuan Khanh Student Quarter: Many students from nearby Can Tho University live in Xuan Khanh or do their daily shopping here. There are small eateries in the street and alleys as well as cafes catering to the student population. As this quarter is less frequented by tourists, visiting Xuan Khanh you will find more local colour than in the upmarket Ninh Kieu Pier. The best time to visit is in the afternoon and early evening.}}
Pagodas and churches[edit]
10.03357105.784042 Munirensay Temple (Khmer Pagoda; Munirangsyaram), 36 Hoà Bình St (Near corner of Hoa Binh & De Tham Rd). A beautiful Khmer pagoda that gives Can Tho a touch of Cambodia, recalling the region's heritage as part of the Khmer Empire. 
10.03413105.788593 Chùa Ông (Ong Pagoda), 32 Hai Ba Trung Rd (Across from Ninh Kieu Park). Just across from Ho Chi Minh's statue in Ninh Kieu Park is a little pagoda, constructed in the 1890s. Apparently a secret hideout for communist revolutionaries during the Vietnam War, the pagoda is now considered a national monument. It's worth seeing if only for its artistic value, with its intricate altars featuring carved wooden bas-reliefs. 
 Quang Duc Pagoda (Mau Than St). One of the biggest and most active Buddhist temples with monks living in the premises. Visitors are welcome at any time of the day. There are fewer people during the afternoon, when it is rather hot, but it gets very lively often in the evenings. 
 Tham Tướng Church (On Mau Than St). Sunday service 18:30. Nice little church built by the French. 
 Tin Lanh Baptist Church (Near Can Tho University in Mau Than). Sunday service 18:30. Around 8% of Vietnamese are Catholics, but as this church demonstrates, Protestant denominations are also present.

 Canals. The canal system around Can Tho is a fascinating travel network, much more relaxed than the bustling roads. Hire a small rowboat (probably with a small motor as well) that can take you through the small canals that the larger tour boats cannot navigate. Tours from 06:00-14:00, including two floating markets and various sites along the canals, can be found for less than 250,000 dong per person. Ask around at the riverfront and make sure to negotiate the price. Some boat operators will ask for more money to visit the canals. The price should already include them. 
 Floating markets. Floating markets make for a lively scene, where many goods are exchanged, and can be easily visited by small boats for about USD3/hour per boat. You can take a tour from Ninh Kiều Pier, where the "boat ladies" are charmingly eager to welcome you aboard. Starting prices (Sep 2011) are about USD10-20 for a 3- or 7-hr tour with either one market plus canals, or several markets plus canals. It can be bargained down to USD7 and USD15. Pay attention as there is a pushy old lady selling boat tours pestering tourists at the riverside. Best to get your tour directly from a boat owner.Non-packaged general boat tours of the floating market run frum An Binh market (Chợ An Bình) for 30K VND per person weekdays, 50K VND weekends and holidays, first boat at 5 am, last boat 5pm, but note the floating market only operates at dawn til early morning. Ticket from kiosk right in front of the market. Tour duration 35-40 minutes. (information from the An Bin market ticket kiosk). (updated May 2024)
Cai Rang (Cái Răng) floating market is the main wholesale floating market near Can Tho. Go there early in the morning (as early as 05:30), and come back through the small tributaries to Can Tho River, 3-4 hours. The Mystic Sampans offer higher-end breakfast cruises to the Cai Rang floating market. Late risers will still see plenty going on by arriving by around 8am. An alternative to the boat trip from Ninh Kieu wharf is to take a taxi to Cai Rang. (Giving the taxi driver the location of a cafe such as Cafe Chợ Nổi will prevent him from taking you to one of the expensive boat tour companies.)
Phong Dien (Phong Điền) is further up the Can Tho River, and worth seeing as it is a retail market. It is very active at dawn, but slows down early too, so you may want to go there by land. The canals back to Can Tho are also very much worth the ride in a small boat.
Phung Hiep (Phụng Hiệp) is much farther away, in the neighbouring Hậu Giang Province, but deserves a trip if you are going to stay more than a few days, as it is always bustling with activity.
Tra On (Trà Ôn), in Vinh Long Province, is just over an hour downstream the Bassac (the lower Mekong branch, also called Hậu Giang or Sông Hậu). It is a small floating village's market anchored near Clouds Island (Cù Lao Mây).
 Countryside Tour, ☏ +84 962621119, info@opentourct.com. If you want to go out of city, get out off the noise and enjoy natural air, the tour is designed for you. This trip provides a general view of countryside life style and packed full of fun with a lot to see, do, experience and totally worth to see.

Eat "Banh Xeo" with a local family, take a boat go to some small canals and see how the local people living and trading fruits in the local market on a motorbike.

Play a game of pool or billiards with the locals during the day, when it is too hot to walk around. Billiards is extremely popular in Vietnam and billiard halls are frequented throughout the day. There is billiard place on Mau Than St next to the petrol station.
Enjoy a head massage at a hairdresser and get a haircut if you dare. There are some salons close to Xuan Khan Market and the Quang Duc Pagoda. Depending on the hairdresser, from very stylish and air conditioned to very rustic you may pay between USD5-10 or 100,000-200,000 dong (May 2012). Ask how much it will cost and how long the massage will take. A good head massage should be around 30 minutes. If they do not understand English, agree at least on the price.
Start the evening with a manicure in one of the manicure shops. Several shops are in Nguyen Viet Hong St (nice tree-lined street connecting Mau Than St and Ly Tu Trong St at Luu Huu Phuoc Park)
Visit the Luu Huu Phuoc entertainment park in the evening. Vietnamese enjoy extremely loud music and do not mind distorting speakers. It might be very loud, but it is definitely a cultural experience.
If you are with kids, be creative and paint small ceramic figures in one of the bigger bookstores, usually on the upper floor. The fee is very small. You can take them home afterwards as a souvenir.
Work[edit]
If English is your mother tongue and you have a teaching background, then teaching English is a possibility. German, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese are also possibilities. If you have IT skills, there is always a chance you might get hired by an international company, though the challenge is to find out about vacancies. In Can Tho, MBM Vietnam provides information on opportunities and job offers for expats with technical backgrounds, freelancers, translators and hospitality industry professionals. There are also meet ups from time to time in the city, where you might meet others who can give you tips about hiring companies.

 Hot Pot Alley (Hẻm Vit Nau Chao) (Xuan Khanh Quarter between Mau Than St and Ly Tu Trong St. From Mau Than St enter Hem 142 Mau Than  opposite the yellow painted Hotel Xoai. After 100 m there is a junction. Turn left here and continue along the alley when it turns right. You will cross a tiny bridge and see the first restaurant shortly after that. From Ly Tu Trong St enter Hem 1 Ly Tu Trong close to Luu Huu Phuoc Park). Hot Pot Alley is home to about a dozen restaurants all offering the same specialty, Can Tho hot pot. Hot pots are prepared DIY on a small cooker on your table. As the soup gets cooking you add different vegetables, leaves, egg or rice noodles, tofu, and eggs. You only pay for the side dishes you use and you can order more of any dish you wish. You get free refills of the hot pot soup. Ask for "them nuoc" meaning more water. It might seem unusual to put in some of the leaves into the hot pot, but try and you will love it. 
The dishes you will find in most places are:
Vit Nau Chao (duck hot pot)
Lau Hai San (seafood hot pot)
Lau Ca Keo (fish hot pot, small fish that looks similar to eel)
Lau Chua (sweet- sour hot pot with river fish)
As the menu is Vietnamese-only,  look around at other tables when you enter the restaurant and point to indicate what you want.
Some places are thronged with diners. These are the best. Do not be afraid to enter a place that looks like there are no more tables available, just take your time, look for the server and indicate the number in your party (e.g., show two fingers and say "hai nguoi" meaning "two people"). They will find a table for you or clean up some space.

Drink[edit]
Vietnamese typically enjoy a coffee (strong, with lots of condensed milk, and ice), fresh coconut juice, and fruit drinks (lemonade, orange juice, etc.) in one of the many small stalls along the streets or in the markets. Sugarcane with ice is also very popular. There are sugarcane presses along the roads everywhere in the city. If you want to spend a couple of hours like a Vietnamese, some nice cafes are located on Mau Than St or at Ninh Kieu Pier.
The nightlife in Can Tho is not as vibrant as Ho Chi Minh City, but it is not as "bottle service"-centric as HCMC either. Can Tho clubs often hire famous Vietnamese singers to perform live in their venues and feature go dancers on regular nights. Prices of drinks are around 80,000 dong for a bottle of beer (May 2012), around 1,500,000 dong for a bottle of locally-produced vodka and more for cognac and imported whisky.

Bars[edit]
 Cafe Bar Eden, Le Loi St.. Good for couples.

Sleep[edit]
There is a wide range of hotels available in Can Tho, from the very local Kach San Tây Hồ, to the state-owned (and state-like) hotels like the International Hotel and Kim Tho Hotel or to the  more elaborate Hotel Xoai geared towards international business travellers.
The standard design of many buildings in Vietnam is about 4 m wide and 25 m deep. Buildings are very "thin". This means buildings next to each other often have rooms without windows. When you book a hotel, check that there is a window in your room as some cheaper hotels, ones that often cater to 2-hour "transit guests", offer rooms without windows.
Beware the giant, neon, Chinese-style riverside hotels. They come with pounding karaoke and dodgy staff. In particular, avoid the Golf Hotel. The spa staff demand inflated tips then block your exit as you try to leave.

Go next[edit]
From Can Tho you can easily reach other cities of the Mekong Delta such as:

Sóc Trăng
Châu Đốc
Rạch Giá
Vinh Long
Cà Mau
If you are heading to the north from the main bus station be careful about what ticket you buy. If you are going by minibus and your destination is not directly on the route to Ho Chi Minh City they might just drop you off somewhere you have no intention of going. You will have to buy another ticket and end up paying way too much.

Cambodia[edit]
Phnom Penh - There is a direct bus operator leaving at the petrol station close to the bus station (Can Tho Ben Xe) early in the morning. Alternatively, take a local bus to Chau Doc. From here you can take a bus or one of the Express Boats.
Ha Tien (Cambodia Border) from Can Tho take a bus via Rach Gia to Hu Tien.
