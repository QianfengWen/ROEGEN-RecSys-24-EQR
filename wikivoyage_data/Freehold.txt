Understand[edit]
Monmouth County Courthouse
Freehold is the seat of Monmouth County, and one of the original townships of Monmouth County. Freehold is a city which contains much 18th-century history, as it was here where the Battle of Monmouth was waged. In the 19th century, many quaint Victorian houses were built, along with the Freehold Raceway. 
The city is a bedroom community of New York City, home to the Freehold Raceway Mall (the third largest mall in the state) and steps away from trendy dining spots, bars, taverns, museums, and art galleries on Main Street.

Mount's Corner Historic Shopping Center was the place where one of New Jersey's earliest Jewish families resided. The Solomons had lived in the property since roughly 1720, where they owned a large piece of farmland. During the Battle of Monmouth, their dwelling however was attacked by the British. The widowed matriarch Hannah Solomon and her two sons were able to save their farmstead from the fires caused by the British. The farm had continued to be prosperous for decades and centuries after that fated encounter. However, the barn and surrounding farm eventually fell into disarray, especially with the construction of the much larger Mount's Corner Shopping Center in the late 20th century, where much of the farm once encompassed. To address this, in 2005 The Jewish Federation of Monmouth County established a planning committee. This planning committee introduced an idea to form a Jewish Heritage Museum inside the former Solomon Farmstead at Mount's Corner. It is "dedicated to the promotion of public awareness of the county’s Jewish heritage for the education and enjoyment of both children and adults."
