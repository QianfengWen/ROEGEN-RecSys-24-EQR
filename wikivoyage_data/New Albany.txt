Get in[edit]
Map of New Albany

New Albany can be reached easily by car. I-64 provides access to the downtown area at Spring St., linking the city with Louisville and St. Louis. I-265 borders New Albany on the north with exits at State St., Grant Line Rd. and Charlestown Rd. before linking with I-65 near Clarksville.
Air service is found at nearby Louisville International Airport.

Get around[edit]
The main streets in the downtown area, east to west, are Main, Market, Spring, Elm and Oak. The north to south streets downtown include State, Pearl, Bank and the numbered streets Third and up. State St. connects downtown with Floyd Memorial Hospital and Paoli Pk, which leads to Floyds Knobs and US 150. Grant Line Rd (IN 111) leads to Indiana University Southeast, off of I-265. Charlestown Rd connects the city with the northeast side of Floyd County (and I-65 at Sellersburg). Spring St. eastbound becomes a freeway after leaving New Albany and connects to Clarksville and I-65 South in Jeffersonville. Corydon Pk., to the west of downtown, becomes a hilly route leading to IN 62 south of I-64 at Exit 118. Along the Ohio River, IN 111 continues south to the Horseshoe Southern Indiana casino near Elizabeth. US 150 branches off of I-64 at Exit 119, leading to northwest Floyd County. IN 64 connects I-64 at Exit 118 with Georgetown and beyond.

Most telephone numbers in New Albany, as well as the rest of southern Indiana, consist of +1 812 plus a seven-digit number, but the region is now served by an overlay complex of two area codes, with 930 being the second. A local or in-state telephone call now requires all 10 digits of the local number be dialed (omitting just the leading +1 from a local landline call).
Signage on many established businesses may still display the original seven-digit numbers; dial 812 before these if no area code is indicated.
