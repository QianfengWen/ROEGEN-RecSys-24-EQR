Around Mt. Aso
The active volcano of Aso brings a lot of tourists to the small town of Aso.
You can find Aso Tourist Information in Aso station or at Michi No Eki Aso (road rest area; the building on the left when you get of the train station).
Check www.aso.ne.jp/~volcano/eng/ before setting out to see if the Nakadake crater is accessible to its rim, or whether noxious or poisonous fumes are rendering it inaccessible.






Note: Due to the volcanic activity, the access to and around the crater can be restricted. Please check the Mount Aso restriction page

32°53′30″N 131°3′52″EMap of Mount Aso
32.885278131.0519441 Aso Volcano Museum (阿蘇火山博物館, Aso-kazan Hakubutsukan) (on the road between Aso station and Mount Aso; some buses stops there.). 
32.947905131.1136952 Aso Shrine (阿蘇神社, aso jinja). An old shrine dedicated to the god of transportation and traffic safety. 
32.9478131.115973 Aso Saru Mawashi Gekijō (阿蘇猿まわし劇場), 793 Shimono, ☏ +81 967 351341. This theater has man and a monkey stage shows. 
32.88202131.085434 Aso-san (阿蘇山). The volcano is still active and sulphuric steam can be seen coming from the Mt. Nakadake crater. However, you should be aware that the summit of the crater has been extensively geared for Japanese mass tourism - paved roads can take you right up to the crater and it can get quite crowded during the peak season. However, if you want to get away from the crowds, you don't have to walk too far. The site is not limited to immediate surroundings of the crater. Do not hesitate to spend one hour or more walking on the path to explore the beautiful scenery. 
32.905885131.0440615 Komezuka (米塚). A nice small volcano cone to see on the way. It erupted 3000 years ago and now stands 80 meters high, with a perfectly symmetric shape. Climbing it is forbidden, in order to protect its cute green slopes. (updated Feb 2016)
The mountain spews sulphurous gases from the crater of Mt. Nakadake. Sometimes, when the winds blow from the crater towards the crowds, the cable car lines are shut down, so you might not be able to reach the summit. They will start operating again when the winds turn - sometimes you will only have to wait half an hour or so. If you want to check before starting your hike, the owner of the youth hostel is able to tell whether everything is in operation.

If you have extra cash to spare or you want to have an aerial view of Mount Aso, you can take the helicopter ride, which is not far from the Mount Aso Museum. It costs ¥5000 for an adult, ¥4500 for a child per person for a 4-minute ride, but the view is astonishing!
Do[edit]
Mount Aso from the summit in autumn.
The landscape is full of greenery in summer, like the Komezuka (米塚), a small crater on the road to Mount Aso.
Various hiking trails around Aso-san can provide you anything from a nice afternoon walk to a good days hiking. The landscape is full of greenery in summer, while in autumn the mountains turn orange. If you're interested, be sure to pickup a hiking map (don't expect a detailed map, it will probably be just an illustrative map) from the friendly Aso youth hostel or from the Aso Tourist Information. Besides - the routes just around the Mt. Nakadake are marked very well, you get a small map with routes and 'You are here' mark every 15-20 minutes of hiking. If you are in front of the crater, walk along it to the right (south) to join the actual trail. Allow two good hours (photos breaks included) if you want to climb the mountain (200 m up) and enjoy beautiful views on the crater and the whole area, and a bit less for the way back down. Even if you cannot/don't want to spend so much time, it worth strolling on this path (which does not start to climb seriously before the foot of the mountain) and then turn back (which will take you as much time).
There are also several hot spring resorts around Aso. Contact Aso tourist information office for more information.
Buy[edit]

Besides the usual tourist trinkets you can buy from the Aso Nishi cable car station, there's not much shopping to do around here. Your usual supermarket is a couple blocks south from the Aso station.
