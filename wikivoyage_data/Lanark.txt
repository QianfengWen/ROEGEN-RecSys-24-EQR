Lanark is a market town in Clydesdale, 28 miles southeast of Glasgow. Historically it was the county town of Lanarkshire, but that is nowadays Hamilton. It was at Lanark that William Wallace first strode into history, leading a 1297 uprising against the English and killing the Sheriff. This escalated into the First War of Scottish Independence, and Wallace triumphed a few months later at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. But Lanark itself is a tired post-industrial place and commuter town for Glasgow. In 2020 its population was 8880.
New Lanark two miles south is the prime reason to come this way, an 18th-century mill complex and  UNESCO World Heritage Site, described separately.

The Girnin Dug on Castlegate
55.6738-3.78221 Lanark Museum, 29 Bloomgate ML11 9ET, ☏ +44 1555 666680. F Sa 11:30AM-4PM. Tells the history of the town. (updated Dec 2023)
55.6732-3.78032 The Girnin Dug sits atop 15 Castlegate. This statue of a dog was erected in the 1840s by its owner after it was poisoned. He suspected the culprit was his neighbour Miss Inglis, who had strenously opposed him building next door to her. So he put up this statue on his roof, its reproachful expression directed into Miss Inglis' parlour window. Her house is long gone so the dog now girns in an unfocussed manner towards St Nicholas Church.
St Nicholas across the street is Church of Scotland, built in 1774.
55.67-3.7873 Castlebank Park is the green space south of town centre, flanked by St Patrick's Rd. The castle stood at its east end (the streetname Castlegate being the clue) beneath what is now Lanark Thistle bowling green. It was built in the 1140s and was derelict by around 1400.
55.67-3.76994 Old St Kentigern's Church is a ruin within the cemetery along Hyndford Rd. It was built in the 13th century and was governed by the abbey at Dryburgh. It was abandoned in 1668 when a new church was completed in town, the predecessor to St Nicholas. The metal gates by the roadside were toll gates, made in the 1820s for Cartland Bridge. They were moved here when road tolls were abolished in 1883.
55.6805-3.80055 Cartland Bridge, built in 1822 by Thomas Telford, is a triple span 39 m high above the ravine of Mouse Water shortly before this joins the Clyde.
Clyde Valley Woodlands is a National Nature Reserve (NNR) in terrain where the Clyde and its tributary streams have cut deep into the sandstone bedrock. Such land was too steep for cultivation so the ancient woodland has been preserved. The NNR is in disconnected sections and the main part near Lanark is from Cartland Bridge (which has parking) upstream to Cartland Craigs and Cleghorn Glen. See New Lanark for the Falls of Clyde section. Further downstream are Nethan Gorge above Crossford, Moulslie Woods at Dalderf, and Chatelherault near Hamilton.
55.664-3.7816 New Lanark: see separate page for this 18th-century mill complex two miles south, a  UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Clyde Walkway and cycle track runs along the Clyde for 40 miles from Partick in Glasgow via Cambuslang, Strathclyde Country Park, Cardies Bridge and Crossford to New Lanark. The final 7 miles are the most scenic, passing Stonybyres HE Power Station and waterfall, Lanark, New Lanark Mills, Bonnington HE Power Station and the three upper Falls of Clyde, ending at Bonnington Linn.
Lanark Lanimers: "Lanimers" means Land Marches, or beating the bounds of the burgh. A ceremony has been held each year since 1140, usually on the Thursday between 6 and 12 June. Dressing up, parades, pipe bands and suchlike.
