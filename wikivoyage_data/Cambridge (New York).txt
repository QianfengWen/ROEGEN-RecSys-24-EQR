Cambridge is in Washington County in the rural northeast of the Capital District of New York.

Hubbard Hall

Understand[edit]
There is a Village of Cambridge and a Town of Cambridge. However, they are adjacent and can be logically thought of as one unit. Both are quite small, though the town has several multi-story (that is, 2- or 3-story) brick buildings, whereas the village is even less built up.

Get in[edit]
US Route 22, which goes north and south, is the main artery in the region.

Get around[edit]
State Route 372, which goes east and west, is Main Street, which is perpendicular to Park Street (US Route 22). Street parking on Main Street is ample and free.

See[edit]
Rice Mansion Inn
Main Street is lined with beautiful and tasteful historic buildings starting to the east of Park Street in the village and extending to the rows on both sides of the street east of Union St. in the town.
