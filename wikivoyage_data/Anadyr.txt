Anadyr viewed from the harbour.
Anadyr (Russian: Ана́дырь uh-NAH-dyhr) is the capital city of Chukotka and the easternmost major town in Russia. 


Understand[edit]
The city's recent history is related to the name of the governor Abramovich, now deposed, and whose renovations have touched upon all aspects of city's life. Due to the colors of the houses the city bears the name of 'summer city'.
The Fort was built in the middle of the 17th century by Russian explorer Semyon Dezhnev. The village of Novo-Mariinsk was founded by Grinevetsky at the mouth of the Kazachka river in 1889. Later it became the city of Anadyr.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
There are regular flights from Moscow by UTAir, from Khabarovsk and Vladivostok by Vladavia and from Magadan by Yakutia. The flight to Moscow leaves daily, but the other ones are served once or twice a month.
There is a Bering Air charter flight from Nome, Alaska. There are also flights to Bilibino, Pevek and Provideniya. Foreigners need at least an invitation paper from the tour agency.
The airport's location is on the faraway coast from the city, so get ready for a long outdoor trip by bus and boat! The first leg takes 40 minutes by bus and the second leg is on board of a cutter, which departs every two hours.

Overland[edit]
It is reported that there is a zimnik (Russian expression for road passable only during the winter when the rivers are frozen) connecting Seymchan (settlement located by Kolyma river and reachable through Kolyma highway). From Seymchan take a ferry (if the river is not frozen) to Nizhnekolymsk. Once in Nizhnekolymsk, ask inhabitants for direction to Anyuysk and from there head for Anadyr.
Please note that taking this way to get in Anadyr is strongly unrecommended as conditions of this path are even worse than those of the Kolyma highway. If you just want to get to Anadyr the cheapest way, go there by plane and don't even think about getting in overland, but if you seek for a serious adventure this could be what you are looking for. If you decide taking this path, you should prepare well, since you will be dealing with one of the most unfriendly environments in the world. There is a serious chance of death by many factors such as bears, large uncivilized area, no hospitals, lack of food and fuel etc. It is also reported that there is no actual road for the last 100 km before you reach Anadyr, so you will have to navigate yourself by GPS and prepare your vehicle for a deep snow ride.
