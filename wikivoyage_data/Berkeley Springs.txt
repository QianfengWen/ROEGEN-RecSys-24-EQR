The springs at Berkeley Springs
Berkeley Springs is a town of 755 people (as of 2021) in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia, across the border from Maryland. While Berkeley Springs is its more commonly used name, but the town is incorporated as Bath. It is a vibrant artistic community, full of quaint inns and historical connections to George Washington, but it is most famous for its mineral springs, which are used both for drinking water and rejuvenating warm baths. Understandably, the spa (and pampering) business is big in the area.
