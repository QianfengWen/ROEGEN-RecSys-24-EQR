Understand[edit]
Austin in Nevada
Austin is an unincorporated town in Lander County, Nevada. In 2010, the census-designated place of Austin had a population of 192. It is on the western slopes of the Toiyabe Range at an elevation of 6,605 feet (2,013 m). U.S. Route 50 passes through the town; this section of Route 50 is considered to be the "Loneliest Road in America".

Get in[edit]
U.S. Route 50 is the main road that goes through the town, and it connects Carson City and Fallon with Ely. However, the U.S. Route 50 is known for being the loneliest road and the drive from any major city to Austin is several hundred miles of mountainous terrain.

Get around[edit]
Most of the restaurants and other services are along the Main Street, which is also U.S. Route 50.

Stokes Castle near Austin
39.493531-117.0796512 Stoke's Castle. It is a three-story stone tower located near Austin, Nevada. It was built by Anson Phelps Stokes, a mine developer, railroad magnate, and banker. Intending the building as a summer home, Stokes began building the castle in 1896, completing it in 1897. The castle is patterned after a tower that Stokes had seen and admired in the Roman Campagna in Italy, and the castle is built of hand-hewn native granite, and the stones were hoisted into place with a hand winch and held in place with rock wedging and clay mortar. Eventually, however, the castle fell into disrepair until Molly Magee Knudsen, a cousin of Stokes, bought the castle in 1956. The tower was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. The "Castle" is owned by HW Trapnell of Austin and Dunsmuir, California.   (updated Mar 2018)
