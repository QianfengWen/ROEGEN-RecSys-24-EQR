Rovaniemi, on the Arctic Circle, is the capital, transport hub and main commercial centre of Lapland, Finland's northernmost province. The city is 2,613 km (1,623 mi) south of the North Pole. It is a highly popular tourist destination and is considered to be the official home town of Santa Claus.


Understand[edit]
Santa's Village at the Arctic Circle in the winter
Rovaniemi is a transport and tourist hub for Finnish Lapland. Sitting on the Arctic Circle does not harm the latter role, and Joulupukki, presenting himself as Santa Claus to foreigners, has understood that this is the place to meet people. Tourist businesses have also flocked here. Easily reachable, Rovaniemi still has rivers, a fell, mires, vast forests, Midnight Sun and Northern Lights: much of what Lapland means to most people.
As the capital of Finnish Lapland, the city has several important museums, cultural venues and educational institutions. It has the feel of a university town when you get to the right venues. The University of Lapland and Lapland University of Applied Sciences have about 10,000 students in total.
In 1960, Rovaniemi became a city, and in 2006, it merged with the surrounding municipality. With the resulting area of 8,017 km2 (3,095 sq mi), nearly the size of all Cyprus, it became the largest city in Europe. With 63,500 inhabitants it is also among the ten most populous cities this north, globally. Some 52,000 live in urban areas. The population is Finnish-speaking (96%). The original Sámi population has integrated with the Finns and disappeared; there are some Sámi here, but not significant numbers. The first Sámi village is 175 km to the north.
The Finnish Air Force maintains a base (Lapland Air Command) which is situated at the city's airport. Therefore spotting some military aircraft above the town is daily. The Rovajärvi shooting range is the largest in Europe (1,100 km2 (420 sq mi)) and due to Finland's membership in NATO it will be increasingly used also by international troops. On occasion, you may bump into soldiers, conscripts, and military personnel. 
The Kemijoki river, noted for being the longest river in Finland, flows by the city centre. On the east side of the river there is a large, forested hill called 66.502225.77911 Ounasvaara, which is a hub for outdoor activities. Ounasvaara also has a plethora of facilities such as a golf course, a nature trail network, and a winter sports resort.
The city was razed to the ground by the Germans in the final days of World War II. In the years to come, the city was completely rebuilt with inputs from Alvar Aalto, a Finnish architect, who planned the city's footprint in such a way that it resembled the shape of a reindeer's head.

Rovaniemi railway station
Map of Rovaniemi


By plane[edit]
66.56166725.8308331 Rovaniemi Airport (RVN  IATA) (8 km north from the city centre). The largest airport in Lapland and the third busiest in Finland (after Helsinki and Oulu). Most of the flights come from Helsinki in the south, served by Finnair and Norwegian Air Shuttle. Airfares by Norwegian are quite often cheaper than corresponding train connections. There are also scheduled flights from international destinations and a remarkable number of seasonal charter flights, mostly from the UK. There is a café, a restaurant-bar, a mail office, an ATM, and a souvenir shop in the terminal. Free Wi-Fi.   (updated Jan 2020)
Taxi cabs are readily available at the airport, but getting to the centre is expensive. However, Santa Claus Bus provides a minibus shuttle service between the airport and hotels in the city centre at a fare of €7 per person one way. The service is available for every departing and arriving scheduled flight. Local bus service Line 11[dead link] is even cheaper (€3.5), but slower and is available only at some flights. See Rovaniemi's route planner[dead link] to find out local transport connections. There are car rental companies at the airport.
Most long-distance coaches towards the north-east (e.g. Pyhä-Luosto, Sodankylä, Saariselkä and Inari) stop at the airport. Timetables may not be ideal if arriving by plane, but most popular destinations are well served. For destinations to the north-west or south, you most probably need to visit the bus station in the centre.

By train[edit]
Rovaniemi is the terminus of most trains from the south. The line extends only some 80 km further east-north-east, to Kemijärvi. The journey from Helsinki takes 9–12 hours and is reasonably comfortable in a sleeper (about €200 for two persons, add €50 for an en suite bathroom). If you arrive from Helsinki, Tampere or Turku with the overnight train, you can also take your car with you (add €100, about as much as fuel and wear if driving).
From Russia you can either go via Helsinki or take the train to Kandalaksha on the Murmansk railway and continue by bus (check connections).
The railway station is outside the city centre, within easy walking distance – you face north when you exit the station, and the city centre is to your right, to the north-east. Most of the long-distance buses stop here as well. There are a few taxis waiting for each train. If you need to call one, notice that there are two taxi stands and make sure the driver knows at which one you are waiting – or just tell them that you are waiting at the station's front door.

66.4980325.707312 Rovaniemi railway station (Rovaniemen rautatieasema), Ratakatu 3.   (updated Feb 2022)
By bus[edit]
66.4989225.715453 Rovaniemi Coach Station is about a kilometre from the city centre, a few hundred metres uphill from the railway station. Coming by coach from the south is relatively cheap but requires about 14 hours of sitting.
Eskelisen Lapin Linjat, Onnibus and V. Alamäki[dead link] operate daily to Rovaniemi from Helsinki (some of them via Helsinki Airport), Jyväskylä and Oulu. Timetables and tickets are available through Matkahuolto. The prices start from about €30 for a 15-hour overnight trip from Helsinki.
There are connections from Tromsø, Alta and Vadsø in Norway, at least in summer (2023: 1 Jun–15 Sep). See Matkahuolto for timetables. In winter (Dec–Mar) The Arctic Route connects Rovaniemi with Tromsø. For travellers from Russia, there might be a twice-weekly cross-border service with Kandalaksha (Finnish: Kantalahti). If you come from northern Sweden, you can transfer at Haparanda to a direct bus to Rovaniemi, which leaves either from the Tornio-Haparanda travel centre or from Tornio central bus stop, which is near enough to walk to from there.

By car[edit]
Highway 4 near the city centre
Rovaniemi is an important road hub for Finnish Lapland. The most important directions are:

Highway 4 (E75) from Kemi (in the south-west) and Ivalo (north-east). This highway comes all the way from Helsinki, about 850 km (530 mi) south, or all the way from Vardø in Norway, about 650 km (400 mi) north; you could come from Murmansk via Raja-Jooseppi and Ivalo, or via Salla
Highway 78 from Ranua, Pudasjärvi, Puolanka, and Paltamo (near Kajaani) (south-southeast). With road 5 coming from Helsinki to Kajaani, this is an alternative route between Helsinki and Rovaniemi, 895 km (556 mi).
Highway 79 from Kittilä and Muonio (north-west, the latter on E8 from Tromsø)
Highway 81 from Kuusamo and Posio (south-east)
Highway 82 from Salla and Kemijärvi (east-north-east)
Highway 83 from Pello (west-north-west)
If driving from Germany or Central Europe in general, the shortest alternative is to drive through Sweden along road E4 all the way to Luleå and then through Haparanda to the Finnish border and on to Rovaniemi.
Unless you like driving long distances or visit destinations along the route, a good alternative is to take a ferry from Travemünde to Helsinki, then board an overnight train (see above) from Helsinki and unload your car in Rovaniemi, ready for any local trips.

Get around[edit]
Being not too big of a town, the best way to get around the city quickly is on foot. However, some of the main attractions are far away and buses are sparse; most households have a car.

By public transport[edit]
The local transportation is provided by city of Rovaniemi and the services are collected under the Linkkari portal. A route planner for local transport is available. Mobile tickets can be bought using the Waltti or Routes and Tickets app.
Most local buses have a blue-green livery with a white reindeer figure. The most useful line is line 8 from the railway station via the city centre to the Santa Claus Village and (some departures) to the airport. Local transport is more frequent during daytime in weekdays of school years, and low during the weekends and in summer. There are no night lines.
Rovaniemi local traffic has a zone system. The whole urban area, including Santa's Village and the airport, belongs to Zone A, while the rest of the municipality belongs to zones B or C. Within the Zone A, a single bus ticket for an adult costs €3.50 and a 24-hour ticket €4.50. The single ticket allows transfers during one hour.

Outside the urban area[edit]
You can use Matkahuolto and Matka.fi to search for bus routes between given locations outside the urban area. Villages by the main roads usually have daily connections. There are also some connections to the villages operated by Linkkari. Usually you need to invoke the Linkkari bus at least one day beforehand, as they won't drive empty buses. Most sights outside the urban area won't be accessible by bus.
All trains from and to the south stop at 66.3708425.375244 Muurola Railway Station, some 25 km south of the city centre. A one-way ticket to Muurola costs €4 and the trip takes about 18 minutes. The overnight trains that continue to Kemijärvi also stop at tiny 66.617826.6865 Misi Railway Platform in the morning (Rovaniemi–Kemijärvi) and evening (Kemijärvi–Rovaniemi). This railway stop mainly serve Rovajärvi shooting range. The ticket for Rovaniemi–Misi is about €7.30 (43 min).

Located right on the old computed place of the Arctic Circle (now computed to be 2 km north), this is a tourist trap if there ever was one – but few tourists can miss the chance to meet Santa Claus. Apart from meeting him, there are other attractions like small-scale sledding hills for kids, the Santa Claus' Main Post Office with special stamps, several souvenir shops, and restaurants.

Hiking and birdwatching[edit]
Cottongrass on a bog by Ounasvaara
In summertime you can hike the marked routes on and around Ounasvaara's forests (or elsewhere). Interestingly there are some rocky areas, which are ancient shores from the time after the last ice age, still visible by these routes. Prepare to face mosquitoes in the forest. From the top of the hill you'll find great views to the forests, hills and swamps outside the city. The city centre is not very easy to see from the top, however a short walk to the 66.5023825.7662625 viewing tower in the forest provides an excellent downtown panorama.

66.497225.782814 Ounasvaara nature trail (Ounasvaaran luontopolku) (600 metres uphill from Santasport). A 4.8-km-long circular nature trail with info plates both in Finnish and English. The starting point is by a parking lot some 600 m uphill from Santasport. Conifer forest, small bogs, awesome views down to the river valley, and two natural springs with ice cold water ready to drink. Try to spot Siberian jays, spotted nutcrackers, reindeer, or elks (of these, reindeer are the most probable). There is a wooden lean-to shelter and fireplace in the far end, close to the springs. The terrain is occasionally difficult and the trail is not suitable for the disabled.

Eat[edit]
Considering the size of the city, Rovaniemi has a remarkably wide range of restaurants. You will find anything from sushi to bear meat and from hamburgers to traditional delicacies.
As elsewhere in Lapland, the traditional restaurant meal is sautéed reindeer (poronkäristys), consisting of slices of reindeer meat stewed in a frying pan with butter and water.  A "bowl" of mashed potatoes is placed to the dish and the hole is filled with stewed meat. This is garnished with lingonberry jam and sometimes slices of pickled cucumber.  It's worth trying once at least – you should be able to find this dish in most better restaurants around town. Salmon (lohi) and lavaret (siika) are other common ingredients.
You can find the light greyish flatbread called rieska from any grocery store. Those are usually made of barley (ohrarieska), sometimes potato (perunarieska). A comb-shaped, slightly sweet pastry kampanisu is eaten with a cup of coffee. It is a true speciality of this area but much harder to find.
If you are about to buy some reindeer cold cuts from the market, make sure there is a word poro on the package. Horse meat looks the same but is much cheaper.

Drink[edit]




The night when Hell froze over


For years, Finland was a notoriously poor performer at Eurovision Song Contest, racking up the dreaded nul points so often that "winning the Eurovision" became slang for "hell freezing over". But in 2006, Lordi from Rovaniemi went on stage in latex monster masks and rocked the arena with their metal anthem Hard Rock Hallelujah, winning Finland's first (and, to date, only) crown. The town square was renamed Lordi's Square to commemorate the event.
