Entwistle and Evansburg are small neighbouring communities in the Foothills region of Alberta. Located between Edmonton and Edson at the intersection of two major highways, they are a good rest stop between Edmonton and Jasper.


Understand[edit]
Rangeland near Evansburg.
Entwistle in Parkland County, and Evansburg in Yellowhead County, are twin hamlets on the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountain foothills. They are separated by the Pembina River. 
Entwistle claimed the title of the "Diamond Capital of Canada" after a local resident found a diamond in the banks of the Pembina River. There is no longer any diamond mining in the area.
Evansburg is known for being the "Home of the Grouch" and the community chooses a "Town Grouch" Pembina Valley Daze festival in August. The tradition began in 1961, when a local artist was commissioned to create a new welcome sign for the community. To add some humour to the sign, he listed Evansburg's population as "603 people, 29 dogs, 41 cats, and one grouch." Speculation began as to who the grouch was, and in 1979 the Evansburg Chamber of Commerce decided to settle the question by holding an election, in which the community's grouch was elected by the people. The election has been held annually ever since.
