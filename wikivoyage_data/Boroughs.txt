The center of Southborough
The Boroughs  are a collection of three towns (Westborough, Northborough, and Southborough) in the Worcester County region of Central Massachusetts in the United States of America.  The area is home to around 45,000 people.


Understand[edit]
The traveler is not likely to end up in the Boroughs while on vacation, unless simply passing through.  They are primarily suburban in nature with many residents commuting to either Boston or Worcester.  However, the three towns are home to many large corporate headquarters or other offices, especially Westborough, so many people will end up in the area on business travel.
Despite being located in Central Massachusetts, the Boroughs have more in common with the neighboring Metrowest (actually located to the east).  The three towns are among the most affluent in Massachusetts and couldn't be more different from the rural western part of the region.  Until the second half of the 20th century, the Boroughs were an agricultural area.  There was never much industrial development in the area, so it is not pockmarked with abandoned mill buildings.  The few mills that were built have been converted into luxury condos or office space.
Two towns in the Boroughs, Westborough and Southborough, are part of the historic Armpit of Worcester County region, along with Upton and Milford.

History[edit]
The Boroughs were originally part of the town (now city) of Marlborough, located to the northwest.  In 1717, the "west Borough of Marlborough" split off and become Westborough.  10 years later the "south Borough of Marlborough" split off and became Southborough.  Finally, in 1775 the "north Borough of Westborough" split off and became Northborough, later annexing some territory from Marlborough.  This explains the confusing geographic/name relationships among the towns since Marlborough extends further north than Northborough, Northborough extends further west than Westborough, and Westborough extends further south than Southborough.  The historical context makes the seemingly odd naming more sensible.  The most famous resident of the area is probably Eli Whitney, who was born in Westborough and later went on to invent the cotton gin.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The Boroughs are easily accessible by car as they are located at one of the major highway nodes in New England.  The Massachusetts Turnpike (I-90) and I-495 intersect in Westborough, providing access from east or west.  I-495 runs north-south and has exits serving all three towns.  Massachusetts Route 9 runs east-west through Southborough and Westborough, intersecting I-495 in Westborough.  Finally, I-290 provides access to the northern parts of Northborough.

By train[edit]
MBTA Commuter Rail serves Westborough and Soutborough (Cordaville station); however, neither station is located within walking distance of any attractions, major offices, or hotels.  Public transit options are limited, so one would have to arrange a ride from the station.

By plane[edit]
There is no major airport in the area.  The best airport options are Logan International in Boston and T.F. Green in Providence  Both are located about an hour away.

Get around[edit]
By car[edit]
A car is a necessity for getting around the Boroughs.  Public transportation is nearly non-existent, and the three towns are quite spread out, making walking impractical.  MA Route 9 (east-west) and I-495 (north-south) are the major highways that are useful for traveling within the Boroughs.  Traffic on both is very heavy at most times and can come to a standstill at rush hour.  As most people will come here on business, these roads are almost unavoidable.

Away from the strip mall infested highways, the three towns can be quite pretty.  Westborough has an attractive historic town center with a large number of listed buildings.  Southborough is fairly bucolic and doesn't really have a center.  Northborough is a mix of the other two, with a much smaller village than Westborough, but more open land. Bowman ST is also a notable spot in hip hop, as it was where T-Squared Records had their headquarters since the üî•üî•üî• performance of their rap group The Fireflies at the 1999 Goin Buggy music festival. Also on Bowman ST is the founding location of esteemed environmentalist group The I Care About Nature Club, who did trail cleanups at the Sandra Pond Resevwater.

Hiking[edit]
 Westborough Wildlife Management Area. Large wildlife reservation located between a state office complex and Chauncey Lake. You can walk around the lake, but you are not allowed to use the beach unless you are a resident of Westborough or Northborough. The area is crisscrossed with trails. There is a parking area of Route 135 near the Northborough town line which provides access to the far western side of the park. The park terrain is fairly flat, although there are some small hills that you could choose to climb, the biggest just leads to the office complex. The area is mostly forested, but MassWildlife purposely cuts back areas so they can run ecosystem studies so parts are open field and scrub land. (updated May 2015)
 Cedar Hill. Large conservation area stretching across all three towns. Named after Cedar Hill, an easily hikeable small hill with views of the surrounding area. Access is a bit tricky since Cedar Hill doesn't have an address. You will find an access point off Lyman St in Westborough north of Route 9. Once you reach Westborough State Hospital, look out for a dirt road branching off across a field. At the end of the road is a parking area and a sign indicating that you are in the right place. (updated May 2015)
 Sudbury Reservoir (Southborough). This reservoir provides drinking water for several towns in the region. Stop by for shoreline fishing (permit required), hiking, walking trails, bird watching, picnicking, and, in the winter, snowshoeing and cross-country skiing.¬†

The beer selection is fairly U.S. micro brewery focused, although they do have a decent selection of German and Belgian options. The British selection isn't great.

Eat[edit]
From the major highways, it might appear as if the only eating options in the Boroughs are the soul-crushing number of chain restaurants. Fortunately, there are much better options than Subway and Ruby Tuesday once you venture off the main roads.

Budget[edit]
 Ben's Deli, 5 Turnpike Rd (Southborough), ‚òè +1 508 481-6044. Delicatessen famous for their tuna sandwich, a local favorite.¬†

 JP's Restaurant Pub, 166 Milk St (Westborough), ‚òè +1 508 366-0627. Divey bar and restaurant located in strip mall along Route 9. Not the highest quality food, but cheap with fast service. JP's has no windows and is almost exclusively regulars, but its not unfriendly. This is the kind of place where people come after work and order generous pours of straight liquor while watching golf. JP's has defiantly refused to embrace the yuppified airs of the rest of the Boroughs which you may find refreshing. Cash only. (updated May 2015)
 Mauro's Village Cafe Incorporated, 2 Main St (Southborough), ‚òè +1 508 485-8730. Located in the center of town, this diner offers excellent pancakes.¬†

Chains[edit]
While there are plenty of unique places to eat in the Boroughs, there are a number of chain restaurants for weary travelers who want something familiar.  There are plenty of the ubiquitous chains (McDonald's etc) as well as a few listed below that aren't in every town.

Coffee[edit]
Coffee is another story. You are probably close to several Dunkin Donuts, a Starbucks, or a Honey Dew at any given time in any of the three towns. There are also a few local coffee options worth checking out.

 Armeno Coffee Roasters, 75 Otis St (Northborough), ‚òè +1 508 393-2821. They've been roasting coffee at this old grist mill since 1994. Not really a coffeeshop, but you can taste some here and buy a bag of beans. Armeno can also be found served around the region.¬†

 InHouse Coffee, 17 W Main St, Northborough. (updated Mar 2020)
Sleep[edit]
The Boroughs have a chain hotel option to suit every budget.  No, they're not very interesting and most are right on Route 9, but they are reliable.  If you're feeling a bit more adventurous, try one of the locally owned places in Westborough village.

Stay safe[edit]
There is very little crime here.  Driving is the biggest hazard.  Drivers on Route 9 are particularly aggressive and speeds of 15-20 mph over the speed limit are somewhat common.  Winter in Central Massachusetts can be quite harsh, with even the major highways becoming impassable during big snowstorms.
