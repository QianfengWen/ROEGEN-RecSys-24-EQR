Whistler is a resort community near Vancouver in British Columbia. Boasting the largest ski area in North America, Whistler is a popular winter skiing and outdoor sports destination.


Understand[edit]
Whistler Village
Before the skiers and snowboarders came, Whistler was a logging town called Alta Lake. The area was known for its snow and a group of investors hatched a plan to build a ski resort in the hopes of attracting the 1968 Winter Olympics. The Olympic dream didn't come through immediately, but the first ski resort opened in what is now the Creekside area in 1967 and a second resort opened on Blackcomb mountain in 1980. Intrawest, the then-owner of Blackcomb Mountain, bought out Whistler Mountain in 1997 and merged the operations as a single ski area.
Whistler got its Olympic wishes in 2010, as it hosted most of the ski and sliding events for the 2010 Winter Olympics and all of the skiing events for 2010 Winter Paralympics.
Whistler had a resident population of 14,000 people in 2020, in addition to an average of 15,000 visitors.

Not surprisingly for a ski resort, Whistler gets its fair share of snow and cold weather. Winter temperatures average about 0°C during the day and -6°C overnight in the village with snow typically on the ground from December into April. Summer days can be quite warm, with temperatures reaching the high 20s Celsius, but nights tend to be cool. As with the rest of the Lower Mainland, there is significantly more precipitation from November through April than other times of the year.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Whistler is connected to the rest of British Columbia by the Sea To Sky Highway (Highway 99), a beautiful but windy and, at times narrow, road. The highway was significantly upgraded and widened prior to the 2010 Winter Olympics and is now much safer compared to the past, when it had a slightly dangerous reputation, but care should still be taken when driving, especially in winter conditions. The section along Howe Sound between Vancouver and Squamish is probably one of the most scenic routes to be found anywhere. Typical driving time from Vancouver is about 2-2.5 hours. There are a number of rideshare sites available where you can find people to share the journey and costs. If you have time go back the long way to Vancouver by the Dufffey Lake Road through Lillooet & Fraser Canyon: Fantastic Alpine Lakes the small "Marble Canyon", Semi-Arid Lillooet - long needle pines & sage brush: an extension of the Sonorian Desert, and the down the Fraser River back to the Lower Mainland and Vancouver's west coast marine Rain Forest.

Get around[edit]

The town of Whistler sprawls out around the valley, but the heart of the Whistler experience focuses on the European-style villages built around the base of the gondolas. Most of the accommodation, restaurants, bars, shops and the Blackcomb and Whistler gondolas are in Whistler Village and the Upper Village, at the foot of Whistler and Blackcomb. Village North (Blackcomb Village), built around the old base of Blackcomb, is smaller but still has a number of restaurants and hotels. Whistler Creekside is built around the original gondola on the south side of Whistler Mountain.
The easiest way to get around most of Whistler is by foot. Whistler Village and the Upper Village are mostly pedestrian walkways and small enough that you can walk anywhere. A short trail (5-10 minutes) links it with Village North and there is also an extensive system of trails that links Whistler Village with many of the parks, golf courses and beaches in other parts of the valley. Cars are best used if you're trying to reach some of the outlying areas. If you do use a car, the main road through town is Highway 99.

By public transit[edit]
 BC Transit (Pemberton Valley Transit System), ☏ +1-604-894-6135. Operates a bus route between Whistler and Pemberton that operates daily, multiple times per day. $4.50 between Whistler and Pemberton.   (updated Apr 2022)

A transfer is available on request from the driver for connecting buses.   (updated Apr 2022)
By bike[edit]
In the summer months there are many bike rental outfits. A valley trail connects 99% of all areas within and around Whistler. This is a paved 2- lane trail system that is very pleasant and fast to get around on. More advanced trails head north to Pemberton and south to Squamish for those who may be more adventurous.

By train[edit]
Whistler does not have regular scheduled passenger service. The Rocky Mountaineer runs trains from North Vancouver to Jasper with overnight stops at Whistler and Quesnel during the summer months, but this is a luxury service aimed squarely at tourists.

Do[edit]
Whistler-Blackcomb[edit]
Excellent skiing
If skiing or boarding is your thing, it's hard to be disappointed with Whistler-Blackcomb, ☏ +1-800-766-0449 (toll-free) or ☏ +1 604-904-8134. With 37 lifts servicing over 200 runs on two mountains and a vertical drop of over 1,500 meters (5,000 feet), Whistler-Blackcomb is the largest ski resort in North America and consistently ranks as one of the top three ski destinations in North America. The variety of terrain is huge — ranging from beginner areas to chutes and trees and groomed cruising runs to alpine bowls heaped with powder after a fresh snow fall — so there should be something to suit everyone. On the freestyle side of things, it has four terrain parks, a snow cross track and a superpipe.
If you are staying in Whistler Village or are parked in the day lots, the closest access point for both mountains is the two gondolas from Skiers Plaza in Whistler Village.  The ride up takes 20-25 minutes and lineups can be long during the morning. Whistler Creekside has a gondola that accesses the southwest side of Whistler Mountain. This is a long walk from the Village so it is only useful if you are staying in the Creekside area or have a car. Village North has a couple of lifts that access Blackcomb Mountain and a beginners area. The gondolas start operation at 8:30AM and stop between 3PM and 4PM, depending on the time of the year. Snow conditions are available from the Snow Phone at ☏ +1-800-766-0449.
Both mountains open the fourth weekend of November and the main season runs until late April. Conditions permitting, the resort will keep one of the mountains open until early June for spring skiing. Afterwards, the Blackcomb Glacier opens for a few hours a day from mid-June to early August, but there are only a few runs as most of it is used by summer ski and snowboard camps.
Lift ticket prices have increased rapidly: as of 2022 an adult lift ticket costs $229 at the base of the mountain during the busy holiday periods. Booking early on the resort website can significantly reduce this rate to about $100 per day, either with the Whistler-Blackcomb day pass, or by purchasing a multi-day EDGE card (only for Canadian and Washington State residents).
Another option for frequent skiers or riders is the Epic Pass, which gives unlimited access all winter to 38 North American resorts owned by Vail Resorts (including Whistler-Blackcomb) for US$800-950, depending on how early the pass is purchased. This pass, and the EDGE card and deeply-discounted day passes, are normally sold only until the first few days of December each year.

Other activities[edit]
Alpine hiking delights
Backcountry skiing and cross country skiing are popular in Whistler as well. There is cross country skiing around Lost Lake, including night skiing if the conditions are right, and Backcountry Skiing throughout the valley, particularly off of the tops of Whistler and Blackcomb. The Callaghan Valley is just south of Whistler (turn left before Function Junction) and will host the Nordic Skiing events for the 2010 Winter Olympics. Callaghan Country hosts guided ski touring, snow shoeing, and cross country skiing tours in this region. Heliskiing is an expensive but worthwhile endeavour if you crave making tracks where few others do. Several operators make Whistler's miles of backcountry terrain available to visitors.
50.11293-122.953851 Whistler Mountain Bike Park, access from Skiers Plaza, ☏ +1 604-904-8134, toll-free: +1-866-218-9690. mid-May to mid-Oct: daily 10AM - 5PM, open until 8PM during summer. During summer, the skiing paradise turns into a biker's paradise with a handful of lifts carrying bikers and bikes up the mountain. There are over 50 runs and 4,900 feet of vertical catering to all skill levels. Tracks include single trails and fast race tracks with spectacular jumps and some Northshore elements have been built. Bikes can be rented at the base of the Whistler gondola. Lift tickets regularly $51, $44 early season. 
50.12669-122.935532 Lost Lake Park, turn-off near the end of Blackcomb Way. Lost Lake is a great place to relax in the summer and is a popular spot with the locals. There's a beach, the water is warmer than the other lakes in the valley and there are miles of trails for walking or cycling. It's also a popular spot for cross-country skiing in the winter. 
Golf is a popular activity in Whistler and it has a driving range & 3 championship caliber courses, & two more amazing courses under Mount Currie in nearby Pemberton.

There are a number of hiking trails in and around Whistler. For the casual walker looking for a pleasant walk through an ancient grove of cedar trees, Cougar Mountain provides an easy hour loop. More aggressive day hikers might head to Brandywine Meadows, a six-hour trip up much steeper terrain. And multi-day backpackers also have a variety of options including the Helm Creek trail to Garibaldi Lake and the Black Tusk. Of course, the ski lifts and gondolas of Whistler Blackcomb operate in the summer to offer hikers a relaxing short cut into back country.
A great family friendly hike is to the historic and unique 50.08156-123.055576 Whistler Train Wreck. Most of the 4.5-km (out and back) trail to the Whistler Train Wreck site is easy, with one very short steep section. At the end of the trail you'll find a unique outdoor art gallery of box cars that is celebrated for its visual juxtaposition of metal and nature, history and culture. These rusty box cars have been transformed with a little spray paint into a really unique outdoor art gallery from a train that derailed in 1956.
Whistler also offers some excellent sport and trad/gear rock climbing. Within the city limits there are several small, single pitch crags collectively known as Nordic Rock. The area offers 23 vertical routes, most of them sport, up to 20 m long ranging in difficulty from 5.8 - 5.13a (French: 5 - 7c+). For more information on the routes in Whistler and area, check out any of the quality guide books describing the climbing in the Sea to Sky corridor.
There are a number of companies that specialize in outdoor adventure travel such as whitewater rafting, fly fishing, ATV (all terrain vehicle) tours, snowmobiling, dog sledding and many other types of activities. Depending on your particular tastes, some or all of these can be extremely entertaining and are generally professionally run. Tour operators include:

Buy[edit]
As is common to tourist-centric villages and towns, Whistler village has a number of shops selling overpriced items. In general, the shopping is better and you'll find more variety in nearby Vancouver, so if you're on a budget, your money is likely to go further in Vancouver. On the other hand, many of the stores in Whistler village are a pleasure to visit and the outdoor setting makes browsing (or shopping) more enjoyable than the large malls found in Vancouver.

 Whistler Ski Butlers Rental Delivery. Learn to ski or snowboard or re-visit the slopes of Whistler Blackcomb mountains again in style with this equipment rental service company. (updated Mar 2023)
Eat[edit]
Whistler village has a variety of restaurants ranging from very cheap fast food to expensive, and covering a number of styles. Regardless of what type of food you're looking for, the best way to find good food in Whistler is to take a walk around the village.
Whistler's on-slope food is surprisingly good and varied. Though you'll pay a small premium for the high altitude service, your udon bowl ($10) or salmon steak ($12) is similarly priced to the village below and though the seating arrangements may be less comfortable than what you'll find in the village, the dining views can't be beat. One special on-hill treat is the enormous waffles topped with berries, cream, and chocolate at the Crystal Hut on Blackcomb Mountain.
