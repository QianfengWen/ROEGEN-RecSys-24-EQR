Cat Ba is an island in the Cat Ba Archipelago of Vietnam's Ha Long Bay. Cat Ba is the largest island in the Bay and approximately half of its area is covered by a national park, which is home to the highly endangered Cat Ba langur. 


Understand[edit]
The golden-headed Cat Ba langur is rarely seen, as fewer than 100 specimens are thought to survive in the wild, although it is the subject of a well-organized conservation program. The park covers both land and marine areas and has high biodiversity, although it is at risk from too rapid an increase in tourism. Other mammals in the park include civet cats and oriental giant squirrels.
Although there is much beauty to explore on the island, Cat Ba town itself is rather crummy: construction, massage parlours, blaring music, touts and drunk tourists. Cat Ba town is essentially a Vietnamese resort town (think Blackpool or Torremolinos) with large numbers of Vietnamese families coming to swim and relax on some of the nearest beaches to Hanoi as well as to take budget tour boats into Lan Ha Bay. The hotels and restaurants are largely geared to this domestic trade although there are some places that cater to the somewhat bewildered-looking foreign tourists who choose to embark on tours from here rather than from Hanoi.

Get in[edit]
By tourist bus[edit]
There is a bus from Hanoi operated by CatBa Express Bus. Pickup (07:30, 10:45, 14:00) in Hanoi and (09:00, 12:00, 15:40) from Cat Ba Island to Hanoi. Travel time is about 3 hours 30 minutes, with an ECO Bus costing 320,000 dong or Limousine for US$20 one way, with discounts if you book round trip. Children under 5-year-old: 50% discount, children over 5-year-old: charged as an adult. Surcharge 20% on state holidays. Service on the Limousine bus: USB power outlet, water, tissues, etc. You can book tickets via email at info@catbaexpress.com or in person at 106 Tran Nhat Duat, Hanoi Old Quarter and depart from there. They also provide a very nice full day trip to explore Lan Ha Bay included kayak.
Buses from Luong Yen Bus Station are not available anymore, the bus station is closed and new buildings are standing there. But some buses might be leaving from Gia Lam station over the river from Old Quarter.
By bus/ferry from Hai Phong[edit]
Cheapest way to the island is with public buses from Hai phong with short ferry ride in between.
The bus number 16C from Hai phong goes regularly. You can find bus stops in Google map. You need to take this line to the last stop. 13k person /1.2024
Be aware that as everywhere in Vietnam the line start really early morning but also end early at the evening. 
Ferry goes every 30 minutes, free toilet is on board and better quality than in the harbor. 10k person /1.2024
The only bus nmr. 14 is usually waiting for the ferry to arrive. Last one is at 18:00. Again google maps are working great. 13k person /1.2024

By boat[edit]
The vast majority of people take a pre-booked tour from Hanoi on a tourist boat, though this is probably the slowest, least flexible, and most expensive way to visit Cat Ba and should be avoided at all costs unless you specifically want to be locked on a tourist boat for five hours while being given the hard sell and overcharged for the most minimal of refreshments.
It's cheaper and more flexible to come either on a non-tourist boat at Halong City or via Haiphong. If coming from Hanoi, you can also take a direct, combined bus/boat trip from Nuoc Ngam Bus Station at 05:20, 07:20, 11:20 and 13:20 which takes 4½ hr (compare: 5 hr for a slow tourist boat just to get from Halong City to Cat Ba's northern port!) and costs 220,000-280,000 dong depending on the season. The route involves switching buses in Haiphong and is not optimal.
From Haiphong: there is a speedboat making the trip several times a day (the last one around 16:00) from Phà Binh harbor. It costs 150,000 dong (May 2012). The price is written on the ticket but some people sell false tickets printed with 180,000 dong and they say the price was 150,000 dong last year or last month! If the boat arrives in Phù Long, they can also say that 180,000 dong includes the bus from Phù Long to Cat Ba. In reality, it's included in the 150,000 dong ticket. Boat and bus can't be divided as it's the same company.

By ferry[edit]
Local ferries to Cat Ba island provide very cheap travel from different locations. These local ferries may be especially convenient if you travel through the country by motorbike (as you can easily take your motorbike along with you on the ferry). You can either choose to take a ferry from Halong or a ferry from Haiphong.
From Halong:
If you depart from Halong, you need to take the ferry from Ben pha Tuan Chau. This ferry station is 12 km from the centre of the city and there are no city buses that go all the way to the terminal, the last part has to be done with a taxi or Grab. Ferry prices are 60,000 dong for a person without and 80,000 dong for a person with a motorbike (so bringing your motorbike with you to the island will only cost you 20,000 dong extra).
The ferry takes around one hour and along the way you can enjoy the scenic view of the bay. You will arrive at the Ben pha Gia Luan ferry station at Cat Ba Island and there is a bus waiting for passengers that can bring you to Cat Ba town for 40,000 dong. In the high season (between 25 Apr and 5 Sep) there are five ferries a day at: 7.30, 9.00, 11.30, 13.30 and 15.00. In the low season there are only three ferries a day at: 8.00, 11.30 and 15.00. (updated Feb 2023)
From Haiphong:
If you travel from Haiphong without your own transport, you will need to take a bus 16C from Haiphong city centre (all Haiphong city bus lines and connections are on Google Maps just like in any major western city). This bus will take you to Ben pha Got pier on Cat Hai island. If you travel with your motorbike you can arrive there by taking a new road and bridge to Cat Hai island. From Got ferry station there's a ferry that will cost you 12,000 dong for a person and 45,000 dong for a person with a motorbike. You will arrive at the Ben pha Cai Vieng pier on Cat Ba island. The ferry operates every 30 minutes between 05:30 and 18.30 and the journey takes around 40 minutes. From Cai Vieng there are buses to Cat Ba town. (updated Feb 2023)
Taking the Haiphong ferry is the cheaper option, but most parts of the journey are far from scenic in any kind of way: industrial areas and plenty of trucks bringing containers in and out.
When you want to discover the best of both worlds, take one out of two options on your way to Cat Ba and the other option on your way back.

Get around[edit]
Map of Cat Ba
By motorbike[edit]
You can easily rent a motorbike from any hotel for US$5 (standard) per day or less if you look around or visit in the low season.
Don't pay more than 50,000 dong for a 1.5 L bottle of petrol, which can be bought in some of the small towns as well as near the port area near the end of the town.
Anyone you hire a bike from should give you a photocopied map of the island which will help you with planning.

By bus[edit]
Local buses across the island leave from the western edge of Cat Ba town, on the water near the market intersection.

By taxi[edit]
Getting around Cat Ba takes some organising. There are electric vehicles which will take you to the beach for 10,000 dong and occasionally elsewhere for a hefty fare. Grab works intermittently and keeps offering destinations in Haiphong. When it does work it is excellent value. Meter taxis all have their meters covered with a towel or piece of cardboard (including companies such as Mai Linh that elsewhere are reputable). Expect to pay 50,000 dong from town to Cai Beo Traveler Dock, but some drivers will ask for 200,000 dong.

See[edit]
 Beaches (Southwest side of the island, accessible from the road). Don't expect surfable waves, though! Free. 
 Caves. There are a lot of caves around the island, though none of them are particularly impressive. Some cost money and may have optional guides. You can find them using the map or signs on the island. 
 Ha Long Bay, Bai Tu Long Bay. Organised 2- or 3-day trips into Ha Long and Bai Tu Long Bay for kayaking, caving, swimming and diving. Book via the honest and fair Mr. Lu at the post office. Prices ~US$45 per person for 2-day, 1-night trip (assuming 4 people in group). 
Monkeys on Monkey Island Monkey Island. Several boats run day trips to nearby Monkey Island either in isolation or as part of a larger tour. The island apparently has monkeys, but only a few around the accommodation were in evidence. These animals are used to getting their food from either the guests or the bins, and therefore are not afraid of humans, so they might cause a problem. There is some accommodation on the island, which consists of eight small, but cosy, bamboo huts just behind a secluded beach. The food was nice, the drinks cheap, and the scenery was spectacular. There's some kayaking available, and a trail for walking, but that's about all. The staff like to fire up the generator during the day to listen to their music quite loudly, so you might want to take a kayak trip at that point. Still, a good place to get away from it all. US$40 per night. 
20.797222107.4070831 National Park (Enter eastward on the main north/south road). The domain of the endangered Cat Ba Langur, of which there are supposed to be only around 100 left. Things on offer include a walk to a peak viewing tower (1½-2 hr round trip; slippery and muddy if it's rained recently), a frog pond (probably better in the off (wet) season), a short nature walk near the frog pond, more stuff which you can probably find online. 15,000 dong entry, various guided tours.   (updated Jan 2019)
Do[edit]
Massage. Enjoy a half hour foot massage. There are several places that offer this service along Cat Ba town waterfront. Alternatively several men offer shoulder and arm massage along the strip of an evening, while you are having dinner. Well worth it, very relaxing, very good. Usually approx 100,000 dong.
Take a walk around the market at the northwestern edge of town. The seafood section should give you a reasonable idea of the less exotic, locally consumed varieties of seafood caught locally.
Rock climbing if seeing the beautiful limestone karsts isn't enough for you, try scaling them. Slo Pony/Asia outdoors on the 2nd floor of Noble House are the organisation responsible for all of the climbing development on Cat Ba (and the bulk of it out in Lan Ha Bay as well) so are best placed to provide advice for experienced climbers, and run guided climbing trips for beginners.
Boat tours[edit]

Boat tour with Jim at the Le Pont hotel. He does boat tours through the islands and some kayaking through neat coves. US$25 per person if 4 or more.

Sleep[edit]
There are loads of hotels along the waterfront with little to distinguish them, though a couple have elevators if you are less mobile or are travelling with elders. A few hotels have more recently sprung up down side streets away from the water. These should be cheaper. When looking at rooms, you may pay more for a water view. Free Wi-Fi is standard. Avoid anywhere that tries to "include" breakfast, which costs almost nothing and is probably of questionable quality anyway. Similarly, avoid anywhere that prices in dollars; ask for the price in dong. In off season, everywhere is empty so will compete heavily on price; a huge room for two cost 125,000 dong) on the water (Feb 2012).

Go next[edit]
To Hanoi, the easiest way to leave Cat Ba is through a booked Bus + Boat + Bus ticket. You can find these on the main beach road by the docks. Hoang Long sells combined tickets daily for 220,000 dong, while some other companies are slightly cheaper. Takes about 6 hr.
Leaving town, boats and buses to Haiphong (150,000 dong; almost hourly from 06:00) and Halong City are available from the square on the waterfront near the boat pier. Hotels can book tickets for you at a slight premium.
In order to get to Halong city you can take a bus from Cat Ba town from the main square near the pier (Mot Thang Tu street) that goes to Gia Luan ferry terminal (the destination is written on the bus, 40,000 dong). Then take a ferry to Tuan Chau which costs 60,000 for foot passenger and 80,000 with a motorbike. The ferry leaves at 9.00, 11.30, 13.00, 15.00, 16.00 in high season which is between 25 Apr and 5 Sep. In the low season there are three ferries a day at: 9.00, 13.00 and 16.00. The bus from Cat Ba town leaves one hour before the ferry departure. Unfortunately there are no city buses from Tuan Chau to Halong city, if you don't have much luggage you can order Grab bike.
