Fairfax is a cute little town nestled in the hills of Marin County in the San Francisco Bay Area of California. Though small, it's surprisingly lively and has kept its historic charm.


Get in[edit]
37°59′14″N 122°35′20″WMap of Fairfax (California)

Fairfax is accessible by bus, automobile, and bicycle.
If you're coming from the west side (towns like Inverness or Lagunitas), the West Marin Stagecoach runs several times a day.
From the east side (San Anselmo and further), Golden Gate Transit[dead link] runs regular bus service.

Get around[edit]
Downtown is small enough, only a few blocks, that you can easily walk end-to-end.
If you're a cycling enthusiast, Fairfax is a gateway to a lot of really great road and off-road biking. From the famed "Repack" mountain bike trail to the single-track at Camp Tamarancho, to the wide-shouldered roads of West Marin County, Fairfax makes a great starting or ending point for two wheeled exercise.

See[edit]
Fairfax is a town with a population of only a little over 7400 people, but it has a couple of venues that have live music seven nights a week, and several others that have live music slightly less often. Some of the groups you'll see perform here are up-and-comers that you'll recognize later on the radio, others are older more seasoned bands that performers you've heard of come to listen to. See the Drink section below for the venues.

Do[edit]
During the daytime the mountain biking, road biking and hiking are all spectacular. If you get tired out in the woods and trails around the town, sitting and chatting at Fairfax Coffee Roasters or the Fairfix Cafe makes a reasonable interlude.
