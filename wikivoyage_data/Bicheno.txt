Bicheno is a small coastal town in Eastern Tasmania, home to a colony of fairy penguins and a good base for visiting Freycinet National Park.

Bicheno town

Get in[edit]
Bicheno is on the Tasman Highway.  North from Hobart, take the signposted turn at Campbell Town if coming from Launceston or Devonport.
There is a daily bus from Hobart to Bicheno.

Get around[edit]
There is a waterfront track all the way from Diamond Island, past the Gulch, and up to the blowhole.  Probably over an hour to walk from end to end.
There is a cycleway from town out to Diamond Island, and the beach.
Of course, you can drive anywhere you want to go as well.  Careful of penguins on the road after dark, particularly around the Diamond Resort section of the Tasman highway.

See[edit]
 Penguins. Penguin tours run nightly. Book ahead during summer as the tour is capped at 120 people / night. In summer up to 800 penguins come ashore nightly, but this falls off to almost none over winter. $20 / person, includes a minibus from town. 




Be nice to penguins
Stay still, don't shine a torch on them or use flash photography. They have their route from the beach, and will stop or retreat if you are in their way. Back off to the side slowly. Control children.


 Blowhole (just south of the Gulch, follow the walking track.). The blowhole blows regularly, even in relatively calm weather. In really rough storms with high tides, the waves can crash over the top of the blowhole. The area is unfenced. Take care. 
 Aquarium. There are two aquariums in Bicheno. One on the highway, and one by the Gulch. 
 Apsley Waterhole. This waterhole provides the water supply for Bicheno. Its a pretty spot, around 10km from the town centre. Take the signposted turn at the northern end of the town. You can swim there. It is cold, but still possible. They ask that no sunscreen be used when swimming, so appropriate water clothing. You can snorkel there too.

Do[edit]
Dive. There are a couple of sites for snorkeling and scuba around the rocks and beaches. There is a large marine reserve on the far side of the Gulch.
Swim. The weather can be mild during summer, but the water is cold. A short dip can be fine, but most locals wear wetsuits to swim or surf.
Diamond Island lies just off the coast, and its possible to walk there through shallow water at low tide, or take a surf ski. Careful of currents and tides. The island has clear rock pools, and is a penguin sanctuary.
Walk up to the  Whalers' Lookout. (updated Feb 2016)

Eat[edit]
Food is available at the one of two cafes, the bakery, the pub, the winery, and a handful of other restaurants. There is also a French/Australian restaurant on the main street.
