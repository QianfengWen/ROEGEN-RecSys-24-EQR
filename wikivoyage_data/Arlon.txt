Arlon (German and Luxembourgish: Arel, Dutch: Aarlen) is the capital of the southernmost Belgian province of Luxembourg. The town counts approximately 30,000 inhabitants and is often seen as the Belgian gate to the country of Luxembourg. Together with Tongeren and Tournai it is one of the oldest cities in Belgium.


Understand[edit]
Arlon was founded due to its location at the crossing of the Roman roads connecting Reims, Trier and Cologne. During Roman times Arlon was called Orolaunum Vicus.
