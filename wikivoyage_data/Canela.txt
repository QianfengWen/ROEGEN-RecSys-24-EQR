Canela is a city in the Region of Serra Gaúcha, no Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.

Cascata do Caracol (Snail Falls)

Get in[edit]
There are two different routes to reach Canela from Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul´s capital.

The shortest one, not the best one: take the freeway and get the RS 115 going towards Gravataí. Short after going through the Police Station take the first right, the RS 020. This road will lead you to the city of Taquara. Then you can choose two different ways, through São Francisco de Paula or Gramado.
The longest one, yet the most enjoyable: take the BR 116 until reaching the city of Novo Hamburgo. Then take the right and go towards Taquara. On Taquaras entrance there's a traffic light. Take the left there and Canela would be only 55 km ahead, shortly after the city of Gramado.
Get around[edit]
Buses connect Canela to Gramado every 20min. If you're so cheap as to not want to pay the taxi/uber ride to the Caracol State Park, know there is a bus connecting it to the Canela bus station 3 times a day.
