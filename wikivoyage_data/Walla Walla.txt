Walla Walla is a city in the Columbia River Plateau region of Washington State.


Understand[edit]
Historic Liberty Theater
Celebrating its 150th year in 2009, and located in southeastern Washington, with the charming rejuvenation of its downtown and booming wine industry, Walla Walla has become a pleasant stop for tourists and new residents alike as they flee the larger cities of the coast and California — be it for a weekend get-away or something more long-term.
Known originally for its funny name and famous Walla Walla Sweet Onions, the long-established farming community with an "Old West" history has seen a major shift in agriculture in the last decade as traditional crops have been replaced by the vineyards of the rapidly growing wine industry. Walla Walla is at the heart of wine country, boasting over one hundred wineries – including some of the area and nation's best cellars – with tasting rooms conveniently located downtown, around the airport, and throughout the scenic countryside.
But don't expect the stodginess of elitist wine areas elsewhere; the area is still an affordable and welcoming community with small town roots, and there's plenty to do besides taste the vino. Walla Walla also offers a taste of Oregon Trail history in Fort Walla Walla and the Whitman Mission, gorgeous views in the country, a charismatic Main Street, and the liveliness of a college town: hosting both the prestigious private liberal arts school Whitman College and private SDA Walla Walla University in neighboring College Place. And should the wine bars and tasting rooms get to be too much, you can always escape into a classically red-neck bar, many of which are clustered near the Washington State Penitentiary in the northeastern part of town.  This town is also the seat of Walla Walla County.
The valley itself offers a diverse variety of striking landscapes: bordered by the Columbia River basin and its desert beauty as you enter from the west, rolling wheat fields and vineyards through the surrounding countryside, and the scenic Blue Mountains to the southeast.  Expect the best of the four seasons with cold and snow in winter, temperamentally sunny springs, blustery winds and fog in the fall, and golden sun warmed days of a hot, dry desert summer.

By foot[edit]
Within town no place is much more than a half-hour walk away, an hour at the most, and many things to do are easily found in the small downtown area. The streets are pedestrian and bicycle friendly - with sidewalks and bike lanes on most major roads, and low traffic on others.

By bicycle[edit]
Walla Walla has some of the best biking around! Great biking through surrounding vineyards and wheatfields. To Waitsburg and Dayton, to Milton Freewater and Touchet, numerous 15-60+ mile routes. But mind those hills! Stop into the following bike shops for info on routes and rides:

 Bicycle Barn, 1503 E. Issacs, ☏ +1 509 529-7860. Mon through Sat 10AM to 6PM. 
 Allegro Cyclery, 15 South Spokane St., ☏ +1 509 525-4949. 
The Valley Transit local bus service runs in the daytime around town, costs only 75 cents a trip with free transfers, and also provides bike racks on most buses. Its main transfer station is located downtown, and it also runs to the airport.
With many peaceful parks and quiet streets lined with large old, shade trees to wander along and admire the charming neighborhoods, leaving the car behind is more than plausible.

By car[edit]
Bring your own car to drive around town or out on the country roads with, or rent one from one of four available companies easily found online. Even if you plan to explore mostly on foot, having a car can be a boon for a trip up Mill Creek or getting to some of the wineries located around the airport and out in the country.
