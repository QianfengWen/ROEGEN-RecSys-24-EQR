Tipperary is a small town in County Tipperary, Ireland, with a population in 2016 of 4979. Although it gives its name to the county, it's never been the county town - since 1838 that role has been shared between Clonmel to the south and Nenagh to the north. Its Irish name Tiobraid Árann means "The Well of the Ara", the source of that river in the soggy fields west of the racecourse. The main reason to visit, apart from the races, is to explore the Glen of Aherlow which lies a few km south.
See County Tipperary for the story of the British music hall song "It's a Long Way to Tipperary".

See[edit]
Kickham Monument midway along Main St commemorates Charles Kickham (1828-1882), the poet, writer, orator and founder-member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. He was born at Mullinahone near Fethard, County Tipperary; he lived mostly in Dublin whenever he wasn't on the run or in jail.
52.473-8.1641 The Maid of Erin Statue on Main St commemorates the three Manchester Martyrs, publicly hanged in Salford, England in 1867 for shooting dead a policeman while rescuing two Fenians from a police van. They had not fired the fatal shot, but they were part of an armed mob of 30-40 men that ambushed the van. Five men were sentenced to death, but one of them was a US citizen and had his sentence commuted. Another was pardoned when the witness testimony against him was shown to be blatantly false. The same testimony had convicted the others, but in a climate of anti-Irish hysteria, an example had to be made. William Philip Allen, Michael Larkin, and Michael O'Brien were those hung, and their unfair trial and botched execution greatly swelled support for the Irish Republican cause.
52.418-8.1932 Aherlow is the tiny village at the heart of Glen Aherlow. This scenic valley descends 20 km from Galbally in the west to Bansha (on N24) to the east: by car or bike follow R663. Its north side is formed by the wooded ridge of Slievenamuck, with R664 climbing over from Tipperary via viewpoints and the Christ the King statue. Its south side is the Galtee Mountains, with Galtymore the highest point. Near Aherlow village is Clonbeg Church, with St Sedna's Holy Well.
52.41-8.0753 St Berrihert's Kyle in the glen is a stone enclosure crowded with ancient slabs, carvings and crosses, though the enclosing wall is modern. The nearby holy well was reputed to heal scalds and burns.
52.366-8.1794 Galtymore is one you might be content to view from a distance. A Munro of 918 m (3011 ft), it doesn't demand technical skills, but the ascent is one long slog, often steep and muddy. The usual approach is from the south, see Cahir. Trails from the Glen of Aherlow are even longer.
52.403-8.2785 Moor Abbey is the ruin of a 13th century Franciscan friary. It's on the boundary with County Limerick just east of the village of Galbally.
See Cashel for Athassel Priory and the stump of Golden Castle, along N74 east of Tipperary.
