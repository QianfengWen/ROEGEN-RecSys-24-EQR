The original Brock Township was surveyed in 1817 as part of York County and the first meetings were held in 1833. The township was named for Major General Sir Isaac Brock (1769–1812) whose estate received free land here for his service in the War of 1812. William Bagshaw became Brock's first Postmaster and Justice of the Peace in 1819 when he owned property on Lot 5 Concession 9.

44.426286-79.1158751 Old Stone Church National Historic Site, 1490 Road 15 (Simcoe Street), Beaverton (between Beaverton and Argyle). Jul-Aug, Su 2-4PM. The aesthetic appeal of this modest Presbyterian church derives mainly from its balanced proportions, the elegant simplicity of its stonework, and its finely detailed windows. Inside, the horseshoe gallery, raised pulpit, and box pews have survived virtually unchanged since the 1860s. A fine example of local craftsmanship, this is one of the few intact vernacular stone churches now remaining in Canada. Built 1840 to 1853. Congregants walked or rode long distances to hear services in Gaelic and English. Eventually the congregation moved into a new church in Beaverton, using the Old Stone Church on special occasions. In 1991, it was restored, and it is now used for weddings, funerals, a sunrise service each Easter Sunday, and for four summer services.  (updated Nov 2023)
