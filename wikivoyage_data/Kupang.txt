You can use "Microbus" (locally called bemo). The uniqueness of public transportation in the city of Kupang is due to the appearance  filled with accessories, decorations and music blaring. Each bemo is manned by a driver and an assistant who collects the money from passengers. You can tell the assistant your destination/drop-off point in advance. There are multiple routes, so you need to ask your accommodations if any of the bemos are passing by your destinations. Within Kupang the route number can be seen on top of the bemo, whereas for further destination, it will write the destination name. Each trip is Rp 3,000 (as of Dec 2018).
