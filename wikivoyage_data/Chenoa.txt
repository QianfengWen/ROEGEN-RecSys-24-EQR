Chenoa is a village in Central Illinois. It sits north of Champaign-Urbana on I-55 and has a population of about 1,700 (2020).


Understand[edit]
Chenoa was laid out on 13 May 1856 by Matthew T. Scott. Scott anticipated the place where the Chicago and Alton railroads would cross and platted the town which he called Chenoa. The plan of Chenoa is complex because it is the blending of two rival townsites. Scott’s original town, which lies west of the railroad, was built around a central park, is much more like the plan like central Illinois towns of the 1830s than that of other towns laid out in the 1850s. However, Scott only owned the in Section 2, while his rival, and former business companion, William Marshall had managed to purchase Section 1. Chenoa sat directly on the path of Historic Route 66 and therefore holds multiple Route 66 historic landmarks.
