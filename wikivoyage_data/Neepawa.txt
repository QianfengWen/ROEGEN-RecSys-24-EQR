Neepawa is an agricultural service centre located in the aspen parkland of the Manitoba Escarpment. Although Neepawa is part of the prairies, the area to the north is heavily forested parkland. The economy of Neepawa and the region is strongly dependent on agriculture. The rolling fields in the area support many types of crops and livestock operations. More prominently, growers in Neepawa produce a diverse variety of lilies and Neepawa proclaims itself the "Lily capital of the world".
