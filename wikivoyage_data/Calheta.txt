Understand[edit]


Calheta (kuh-LYIH-tuh, /kɐ.ˈʎe.tɐ/) is the administrative centre of the district of the same name and the most important town in southwest Madeira, founded in 1430. It used to be the centre of the sugar industry. The small marina "Calheta Beach" is important for tourism, because sand from the Sahara was poured here in an artificially created bay. This is how the only sandy beach along the south coast was created. In addition to the area around Canico, which is more dedicated to package tourism, Calheta has the largest colony of local Germans from abroad who are often also involved in tourism (rental, excursions, paragliding). The most important German-language online and print magazine is also created here.
Tourist information often does not distinguish the municipality of Calheta with the port from the neighboring municipalities of Arco da Calheta , which stretches up the hills towards Funchal along the coast, and Estreito do Calheta, which grows northwest up into the foothills. All three areas cover areas far into the mountains. Visitors without their own car should therefore carefully check the location information to protect themselves from surprises.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
From Madeira's only airport, Santa Cruz, Calheta can be reached within 40 minutes on the coastal motorway.

By bus[edit]
The operator Rodoeste connects the place quickly and frequently with the capital Funchal, but also with all other places on the island (sometimes only 1-2 times a day).

By car[edit]

The ER-101 coastal motorway connects quickly to Funchal via Ribeira Brava, where the motorway under the Encumeada Pass connects the north coast. Winding country roads can also be used to get to the Paúl da Serra plateau and along the west coast to Porto Moniz.
Calheta is approached from Ribeira Brava via the expressway ER-101 in tunnels, at the end of which you can get to Calheta Beach very quickly. However, some areas are better to be reached via the coastal road via Maddalena do Mar. As everywhere in Madeira, it is not easy to decide which of the paths to choose without a local knowledge. A good description of how to get there may be useful when you are arriving.
