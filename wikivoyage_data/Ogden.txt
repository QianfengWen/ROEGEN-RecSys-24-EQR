Drink[edit]




Drinking in Ogden
Utah has some drinking laws that are different from other states. You can't order a pitcher of beer by yourself: You have to have at least one other person with you. Liquor is metered instead of free poured, so if you order a drink with 2 types of liquor in it, you'd need to get 2 shots; 3 ingredients would require 3 shots, etc. If you see a "Private club for members only" sign on a bar, that's a hold-over from a pre-2000 Olympic anti-barhopping law that required people to be members at bars. Even if such a sign is up, you can go in and have a drink and don't need to be a member.


Alcohol[edit]
There are several bars on Historic 25th Street, including the famous Kokomo Club, which was featured in Jack Kerouak's book Visions of Cody. There is also Roosters, a classy brewpub.
Some restaurants also feature a full bar, but since this is Utah, not nearly as many serve alcohol as might be expected elsewhere.
Utah has alcohol laws known by the rest of the United States to be restrictive. This leads to lower ABV drinks being served, as well as a hard limit of 2.5 oz (71 g) of hard alcohol (anything over 5.0% ABV) being sold in stores. However, bars and pubs can serve higher alcohol content beverages.

Coffee[edit]
If you're just looking for coffee, the local favorite is Ogden-based chain Grounds for Coffee has three locations in town. The most popular is on 30th and Harrison.
