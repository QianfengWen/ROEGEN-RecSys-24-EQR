Joplin is in Southwest Missouri. It's mentioned in the song "Route 66." Joplin is the "hub" of the southwest corner of Missouri, southeast Kansas, and northeast Oklahoma. The population of Joplin in 2020 was 51,762, but, with several "suburbs" around Joplin, the population of the Joplin metro area was over 210,077.


Understand[edit]
Although commonly thought to be named for ragtime composer (and Sedalia resident) Scott Joplin, the city is actually named after the Joplin Creek Valley, which in turn is named after an early settler, Reverend Harris Joplin.
The Joplin Metropolitan Area (the 4th largest in Missouri) is composed of Jasper and Newton Counties in Missouri. However, given its location at the confluence of three states, it is quite common for many people from Kansas and Oklahoma (and from other parts of southwest Missouri) to frequent Joplin, for work and pleasure.
Other cities and towns that comprise the Joplin area include:

Webb City, Carthage, Carl Junction, Loma Linda, Leawood, Neosho, Seneca,  Duenweg,
 Pittsburg,  Galena, and Baxter Springs in Kansas
 Miami, Oklahoma
Joplin is approximately 40 miles north of the Arkansas state line. Thus, the Joplin area is commonly referred to as the "Four-State Area".

History[edit]
Lead was discovered in the Joplin Creek Valley before the American Civil War, but only after the war did significant development take place. By 1871, numerous mining camps sprang up in the valley, and the village was named Joplin City after the spring and creek nearby, which had been named for the Reverend Harris G. Joplin, who settled upon its banks circa 1840.
While Joplin was settled for lead mining, zinc, often referred to as "jack", was the most important mineral resource. As railroads were built to connect Joplin to major markets in other cities, it was on the verge of dramatic growth. By the start of the 20th century, the city was becoming a regional metropolis. Construction centered around Main Street, with many bars, hotels, and fine homes nearby. It soon became the lead- and zinc-mining capital of the world.
As a result of extensive surface and deep mining, Joplin is dotted with open-pit mines and mine shafts. Mining left many tailings piles (small hills of ground rock), which are considered unsightly locally. The open-pit mines pose hazards, but some find them to have a kind of beauty, as well. The main part of Joplin is nearly 75% undermined, with some mine shafts well over 100 ft (30 m) deep. These mine shafts have occasionally caved in, creating sinkholes. The mining history and geology are well documented in the mineral museum in town.
In 1933 during the Great Depression, the notorious criminals Bonnie and Clyde spent some weeks in Joplin, where they robbed several area businesses. Tipped off by a neighbor, the Joplin Police Department attempted to apprehend the pair. Bonnie and Clyde escaped after killing Newton County Constable John Wesley Harryman and Joplin Police Detective Harry McGinnis; however, they were forced to leave most of their possessions behind, including a camera. The Joplin Globe developed and printed the film, which showed now-legendary photos of Bonnie holding Clyde at mock gunpoint, and of Bonnie with her foot on a car fender, posed with a pistol in her hand and cigar in her mouth.
After World War II, most of the mines were closed, and population growth leveled off. The main road through Joplin running east and west was designated as part of U.S. Route 66, which became famous as more Americans took to newly constructed highways. The roads provided improved access between cities, but they also drew off population to newer housing and eventually retail centers.
In 2011, an EF5 tornado touched down near the western edge of the city among large, newer homes, and tracked eastward across the city and across Interstate 44 into rural portions of Newton County. Its track was reported to have been about 0.75 miles (1.21 km) in width and 22.1 miles (35.6 km) long. About 2,400 houses, 1,000 cars, and businesses were flattened or blown away in Joplin, particularly in the section between 13th and 32nd Streets across the southern part of the city. The tornado narrowly missed the downtown area.
After the May 22, 2011 tornado came through a number of unofficial murals and monuments popped up across the city showcasing the community's spirit to rebuild the city and come back stronger than before. These popups also showcased the beginning of an arts renaissance in Joplin which still can be seen throughout the city today.

Stay safe[edit]
Most crime that occurs in the Joplin area are petty. The biggest crime problems in the area have been gas station drive-offs and convenience store robberies. Violent crime is quite rare, but it does occur on occasion. The rough side of town for Joplin is generally considered west of Main Street. Like most other places, most of the more serious crime happens in the middle of the night. Typical common sense will enable most anyone to avoid problems.
Red light running is a growing problem. Range Line Road is notorious for motorists running red lights, especially well after it has turned red for their direction. Motorists should exercise caution and not dart into intersections immediately when their light turns green.
The city is located in Tornado Alley. See tornado safety.
