Tepic is the capital city of Nayarit. Nestled in a verdant valley with vestiges of the Sierra Occidental here and there, Tepic can be a little muggy and wet from April to November but otherwise offers lots of sunshine and can be an interesting destination or embarkation point to the Nayarit Riviera.


Understand[edit]
It was established in 1531 after Hernando Cortes and his sidekick Nuño de Guzmán claimed the area as Nueva Galicia for Spain while ravaging the Uto-Aztecan peoples like the Cora and Huichol. Guzman spared no opportunity in whetting his bloodlust while going here and there trying to uncover the fabled Cibola, that is, Seven Cities of Gold. The savagery led to revolt by the indigenous people with the Mixton War a few years later. When things settled, Tepic became an agricultural center for commodities like peanuts, citrus, and even coffee, though it remained a restive area.
While there isn't a whole lot to see or do in Tepic, it is a perfectly pleasant medium-sized Mexican city.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
21.419453-104.8425811 Tepic International Airport (TPQ  IATA Amado Nervo International Airport) (south of Tepic in the municipality of El Pantanal), ☏ +52 311 214 1850. This regional airport sees very light traffic, only having connections to Mexico City and Tijuana via Volaris. Alternative airports might be Puerto Vallarta or Guadalajara.   
By car[edit]
 &  Federal Highway 15/Tollway 15D extends from Mazatlan to Guadalajara, passing through Tepic about halfway. Several highways connect Tepic to San Blas and the Pacific Coast/Riviera Nayarit, but particularly useful is probably the new Tepic-San Blas expressway (enter either via the Guatemala-Tepic Hwy or Insurgentes Avenue). It used to be that the regular highway between Mazatlan to Tepic was considered quite dangerous for driving and using the toll road instead was advised; this may still be wise.
 La Carretera Tepic-Puerto Vallarta continues south as the Pacific Highway (Caretera Pacifico) from  Tepic along the Pacific coast through Xalisco towards Puerto Vallarta and beyond, while MX Hwy 15D turns inland toward Guadalajara. Hwy 200 begins/ends at its junction with MX-Hwy 15D on the south side of with a sign reading "Tepic Centro/Puerto Vallarta".  Going north into town it becomes Blvd Tepic-Xalisco.
 De los Insurgentes goes 51 km (32 mi) west from town to Santa Cruz de Miramar at the coast.  It goes across as a two road most of the way.

Stay safe[edit]
As of January 2024, the Canadian government advises avoiding non-essential travel to Tepic due to violence and organized crime. The town of Xalisco, just south of Tepic, is a narcotics trade epicenter and probably isn't wise to go poking around in.
