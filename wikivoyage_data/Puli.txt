Puli (埔里; Pùlǐ) is a town in Nantou County at the geographic centre of Taiwan.


Understand[edit]
Puli was severely damaged in the 1999 earthquake, and although the town has since been rebuilt, there is little in the way of actual tourist attractions. However, the town is located in a very lush and beautiful valley with many hiking trails, and its central position makes it a logical base for visiting the mountains and lakes in the area.
Puli is famous for its four 'W's - water, wine, women and weather. Being located in a pristine mountain area, the local spring water is pure and sweet and sold in bottles at supermarkets around the island. The abundance of fresh, clean water lent itself to the production of wine - the second 'W' - while the exceptionally fine complexions of the town's women folk, which some theorize is the result of the local water, constitutes the third 'W'. Finally, the fourth 'W' refers to Puli's ideal climate, which is characterized by short and relatively dry winters and cool summers.
Possibly as a result of the mild climate, the town has developed into a center for Buddhism. There are large monasteries scattered throughout the valley, while the mountain-sides provide havens for retreat centers and hermitages.
Puli's prosperity is closely related to the nearby famous lake, which you will notice from the modern buildings and cars here.

By bus[edit]
The town is not big enough for a bus service, though buses that connect with local towns do make stops in the suburbs.

By taxi[edit]
Taxis are probably the most convenient way to reach your destination, but as few use meters, check the cost to your destination before setting out and negotiate the best deal.

24.00917120.944581 Chung-tai Shan Monastery (Only 4 buses go from Puli, two in the morning, one at noon, and one in the late afternoon.). 33 stories make it possibly the tallest Buddhist monastery in the world, and it is a landmark in the area and quite a sight from a few kilometres apart. Maybe find a hill nearby to fully capture it – it will be hard to put its size onto a picture standing right in front of it. Apparently, locals do not like the monastery too much, because the they demand money/donations for everything. But as a western tourist you should be safe from that. North-east of it can also be found the related Chung Tai World Museum.

Paper Dome[edit]

Paper Dome is a temporary church building constructed using paper tubes as structural elements. It was designed on a pro-bono basis by Shigeru Ban, internationally known Japanese architect who is renowned for his paper tube structures and buildings. It was built on September 17, 1995 to serve as a temporary church for Takatori Catholic Church after the Great Hanshin Earthquake. Nonetheless, the venue was also used as a place for communal gatherings. However, when the church community planned to build a permanent building, the structure was donated to Taomi Village in Puli Township, Nantou County, Taiwan which had suffered the 921 Earthquake in 1999. The deconstructed structure was shipped in 2006 to Taiwan, reconstructed there and is now one of the top tourist attractions in that area.

History[edit]
In January 1995 Japan suffered the Great Hanshin earthquake. 60% of all buildings were destroyed in Kobe, the epicentre of the disaster, including the Takatori Catholic church. However, strangely a statue of Jesus remained unharmed. People understood this fact as a miracle and they decided to rebuild the church as soon as possible. An internationally known Japanese architect Shigeru Ban was invited to build a temporary church for survivors.
Shigeru Ban is famous for his passion for using paper material in his projects. Indeed paper although seemingly soft and non-effective for building, can actually be strong if used in the right way. Moreover it is cheap, light and recyclable. Shegeru Ban is also known for his humanistic beliefs and social orientation. He built shelters for refuges in Africa and South America. There he noticed that cheap plastic shelters were too cold for people and it was more appropriate to use paper shelters.
Shigeru Ban created an ellipse-shape construction built from 58 cardboard tubes. 160 volunteers helped to build it and it took only five weeks to finish the project. The temporary church was nicknamed “Paper Dome”. Paper Dome became the new religious centre and a place of mutual help and support as a community meeting place connecting Kobe residents.
But after 10 years it became apparent that the building was too small and that it had to be replaced by a new permanent church. Paper Dome was supposed to be destroyed. However the president of New Homeland Foundation visited Kobe. He suggested donating the Paper Dome to the Taomi community as a symbol of friendship between Japan and Taiwan. Japan and Taiwan, two countries that suffer from earthquakes a lot, used to help each other and send their volunteers whenever a disaster happened. The Paper Dome that was built after Great Hanshin earthquake had to continue its mission in Taomi, the place that was heavily damaged by the 921 earthquake in Taiwan.
On 29 May 2005 the last service was held in the Paper Dome in Kobe and then the building was sent to Taiwan. After three years of formalities Taomi became the new home for Paper Dome. On 25 May 2008 over 1000 people participated in lifting cardboard tubes and witnessed the rebirth of the Dome.
Eventually the Paper Dome was opened for visitors on the next day after nine years 921 earthquake anniversary. On 21 September 2008 the delegates of two religious communities, Christianity and Daoism, got together to bless the land. Since this day the Paper Dome in Taomi is not only a tourist attraction but also a platform to exchange earthquake reconstruction experience and to educate people. Music performances, art exhibitions of local artists, weekend bazaars and other activities are held here.

Structure[edit]
From the cylindrical columns to the internal benches, Paper Dome is a giant hollow paper tube structure supported by a total of 58 tubes, 5 m in height. The diameter of tube is about 33 cm and the thickness of paper is about 1.5 cm. It is built in a nomadic style which facilitated its dismantlement before its shift from Japan to Taiwan. The 58 tubes, together with the internal benches, are coated with an external water-resistant paper protective covering made in Puli Township, which is famous for its paper factories. Although each paper tube bench weighs no more than 60 kg, they are able to support weight up to 1500 kg each, equivalent to the weight of 20 people. As for the tall paper pillars, they are able to support pressure up to 6900 kg.
