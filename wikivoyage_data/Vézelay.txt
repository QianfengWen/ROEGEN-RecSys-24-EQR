Vézelay is a small town in Burgundy, a region of France which is southeast of Paris and north of Lyon.


Understand[edit]
The town of Vézelay (less than 500 inhabitants) is associated with the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. For centuries, pilgrims departed from this town or passed through it during their pilgrimage. These days, Vézelay is visited by hundreds of pilgrims, and that number is increasing every year. Nevertheless, these pilgrims represent only a fraction of the total number of people visiting the city. Their visit is not without reason. The dominant Basilica Sainte-Marie-Madeleine de Vézelay, located on the highest point of the city, is a distinctive landmark and has been on the UNESCO World Heritage List since 1979.

Get in[edit]

There is no train station in Vézelay. The closest SNCF station is in Sermizelles. From there SNCF buses drive to several destinations  including Vézelay.

By car[edit]
From the north and the east, the fastest way to reach Vézelay is by the A6 Autoroute that runs from Paris to Beaune (access 21 and 22 for Avallon). You will find a free parking lot just outside the city walls. From the parking lot, a staircase leads to Place du Champ de Foire and Rue Saint Etienne which is the street up to the basilica.

Get around[edit]
You can easily go around on foot. Drive or take a taxi if you want to visit the beautiful Église Notre Dame in the nearby village of St. Père, which is just below the hill that Vézelay is on top of.

 The Basilica Sainte-Marie-Madeleine. This large cathedral, in mixed Romanesque/Gothic style, is a traditional place for pilgrims to start their pilgrimage to the great Romanesque cathedral in Santiago de Compostela. The basilica is free to visit between 08:00 and 20:00. If you like, you can participate in a tour to get more information about the structure and history of the building. There are a few tours a day and they last one and a half hours. Usually the guides speak French, sometimes English.

Château de Bazoches
Morvan Regional Natural Park – Vézelay is in the far north of this 290,900 ha big park with only 50,000 inhabitants in 117 communities. It’s a relative quiet hilly area with forests and lakes. In summer some lakes like Le Lac des Settons are popular tourist destinations.
The old fortress city Avallon is just 17 km east of Vézelay
Château de Bazoches is located on a wooded hillside near the village Bazoches 10 km south of Vézelay. The castle was built in 1180 by Jean de Bazoches. Over the years it had several owners until in 1675 King Louis XIV bestowed the castle to Sebastien Le Prestre de Vauban. Vauban was a military designer who used the castle for studies and drawings of 300 fortresses and fortified cities. The current owners, descendants of the eldest daughter of Vauban, Charlotte de Vauban, preserved many sumptuous furnishings of their famous ancestors. The château has been designated as a historical monument and can be visited from March until November.
