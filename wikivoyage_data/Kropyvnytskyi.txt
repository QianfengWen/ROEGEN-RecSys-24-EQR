One of the buildings in the center of Kropyvnytskyi
Kropyvnytskyi (Ukrainian: Кропивницький; formerly: Yelisavetgrad, Kirovohrad) is the administrative center of Kirovohrad Oblast (province, also referred to as Kirovohradschyna) and Kirovohrad Rayon (district). It is an industrial and cultural center of Kirovohrad Oblast. Kropyvnytskyi is located on the Dnieper Upland, on the banks of river Inhul. It is a motorway junction. There is a train station (Znamyanka - Pomoshnaya line) and a civilian airport.  Kropyvnytskyi is not famous for its places of interest, but the downtown still bears the remnants of old architecture. Some of the old buildings are renovated and some are still in the process of renovation. The city administration is doing a good job of making Kropyvnytskyi a better place both for locals and tourists. The locals like to call Kropyvnytskyi "a little Paris" due to its resemblance to Paris before the Soviet Union have destroyed the look of the city in the 20th century.


Understand[edit]
Kropyvnytskyi was founded in 1754 as Yelisavetgrad (usually spelled Elisavetgrad or Elizabethgrad in English language publications). From the middle of 19th century till the beginning of the 20th century, Kropyvnytskyi enjoyed its golden age. The industry was on the increase, the culture flourished. It was there where the first professional Ukrainian theater was opened.
Kropyvnytskyi became the center of Kirovohrad oblast in 1939. The city has a developed social infrastructure and a number of educational and cultural institutions.
Kropyvnytskyi's geographical position has an impact on language. The most commonly spoken language is Russian and "surzhyk" (a mix of Russian and Ukrainian languages). Everyone can speak and understand Ukrainian. The knowledge of English is low, but it won't be a problem in hotels or restaurants where most people can speak decent English.
