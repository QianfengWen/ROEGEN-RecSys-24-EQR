Werris Creek is a village in the southernmost part of the New England region of New South Wales in Australia.


Understand[edit]
Single Street, the main street of Werris Creek
The indigenous Kamileroi people were the original inhabitants of the area. The name 'Werris' is thought be derived from the Kamilaroi word 'werai' meaning 'a lookout point' in reference to the many hills in the district. European settlers arrived here in the 1830s. The heritage-listed railway station was built in the late 1880s, and Werris Creek is considered to be the first railway town in Australia.
Werris Creek is in the Liverpool Plains Local Government Area, with its main centre in Quirindi.
