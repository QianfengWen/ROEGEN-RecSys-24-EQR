Broadstairs is a beach resort on the east coast of Kent. It has sandy beaches, clean bathing water and a variety of pubs and restaurants. In 2021 its population was about 25,000. 


Understand[edit]
The village of St Peters was established around 1080 AD, an outpost of the  Cinque Ports responsible for maritime defence. Around 1350 a shrine was erected on the clifftop, and acted as a landmark for fishing vessels. The fishing folk cut a flight of broad stairs from the shore to the shrine and so their hamlet was named. It was a poor sort of place, lacking a sheltered harbour and hemmed in by cliffs to impede inland transport. But in the 18th century high taxes made smuggling lucrative, and Broadstairs' out-of-the-way landing beach and cliff-face hidey-holes made it a popular smuggling route. 
The town grew from 1824 with the fashion for sea bathing, and a steam ferry service from London. Prosperous visitors included the writer Charles Dickens and the future Queen Victoria; the railway arrived in 1863 and brought hoi polloi. It's been a holiday resort ever since, with St Peters and Broadstairs townships merging in 1895. There's a rash of light industry and retail a few miles inland but the Victorian centre is fairly well preserved.
Tourist information is available from the kiosk below the foot of High St. It's open Apr-Sep: daily 10AM-4PM, but is under notice to quit the site by end of June 2023, and its future base is not known. Tourist info is also available from the Dickens House Museum.
