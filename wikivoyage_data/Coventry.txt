Coventry is a large city in the West Midlands region of England, part of the United Kingdom. It has a population of just over 365,000 (2018), making it the eleventh-largest city in the country. Locally, the city is known as 'The Three Spired City', because of the church and cathedral spires that form the most striking aspect of the city's landscape. Coventry is perhaps best known for its association with the 11th century legend of Lady Godiva and for its two cathedrals, one of which is preserved as ruins after heavy bombing in the Second World War. Although an old city, visitors should not expect much in the way of old-world charm. Extensive rebuilding of the city following the war in the 1940s and 1950s replaced much of its pre-war appeal with questionable concrete structures and a highly pedestrianised city centre, enveloped by a partially-elevated ring road.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
The area that Coventry now occupies has been inhabited for over 1,000 years. The city is known for its association with Lady Godiva, who rode naked through the city streets in order to gain a remission of the oppressive taxation imposed by her husband on his tenants. Lore has it that the term 'Peeping Tom' is derived from this tale, describing a man named Tom who did not cover his eyes as she rode through the streets. Coventry has been an economically important city in the past, being a hub for the cloth trade in the Middle Ages and for the burgeoning automotive industry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The city's industrial prowess helped Britain's war efforts in the early 20th century; it also however made it an obvious target in the Second World War. A series of German bombing raids from 1940-42 (the Coventry Blitz) destroyed much of the city's infrastructure, although the single night of bombing in November 1940 dealt the largest damage, killing more than 500 people.
In the succeeding decades after the war, most of the old medieval dwellings were not rebuilt, being replaced instead by more modern constructions, often brutalist concrete structures. Subsequent to these, Coventry has undergone extensive remodelling most notably within the city centre, making it more pedestrian-friendly. Major regeneration projects have attempted to make the city a more attractive place, such as the Phoenix Initiative (completed in 2004) which was shortlisted for the Stirling Prize.

Visitor information[edit]
Visit Coventry website
Get in[edit]
By road[edit]
Coventry is near the centre of the UK motorway network.  The M6 passes the north of the city.  The M1 is easily accessible via the A45 towards London and the M69 northbound.  The M40 is accessed along the A46.
To enjoy the drive into Coventry approach along the A46, exiting at Kenilworth.  Drive through central Kenilworth and past the Abbey Fields park before turning right towards Coventry.  The broad tree-lined Kenilworth Road offers a beautiful boulevard into the city.
The city also provides a Park and Ride facility, see National Park and Ride Directory.
You can reach Coventry from London using Megabus which starts at roughly £13 return, but it arrives in Cannon Park, near Tesco, not the city centre. National Express has buses arrive at Pool Meadow Bus Station (see listing below), which can be cheaper at some times, though on average, Megabus proposes more options that are almost as cheap as the cheapest, yet less common National Express's equivalents.
One possible problem visitors to Coventry City centre may encounter is the infamous Coventry ring road. It can be very confusing to first time users, with its single on/off ramps. Speed is limited to 40 mph, but don't be surprised to see cars pass by at [sometimes] much higher speeds, racing to get off at the next junction! If you plan to come to Coventry (and want to visit the city centre), it's advisable to have someone who understands the ring road drive you around first.

By rail[edit]
Coventry railway station
52.400872-1.5140531 Coventry. on the main London Euston to Birmingham rail route. There are usually three trains from London Euston station every hour from platform 1. The journey takes about an hour and (as of December 2019) costs from £30 for an adult off peak return. Significantly cheaper advance single tickets (in each direction) may be found if booking far enough in advance, and Megatrain also offer tickets on a few of the emptier of these trains (generally Monday-Thursday only) for as little as £2.50 return, again if booked far enough in advance. Alternatively London Midland offer an hourly service from Euston that takes about 1 hour 45 minutes, but has cheaper off peak and super off peak tickets compared to those valid on Avanti trains. Trains from central Birmingham are even more frequent, with a 25-minute journey time. Birmingham International, serving the NEC and Birmingham Airport, is 10 minutes away, on the line to Birmingham. Direct trains also serve Bournemouth (via Leamington) to the south, and Liverpool, Manchester and Scotland to the north.   (updated Dec 2019)
By plane[edit]
52.453889-1.7480562 Birmingham Airport (BHX IATA). This is closer to Coventry than to central Birmingham. Take the free monorail to Birmingham International railway station for frequent trains to Coventry. Driving should not take much over 30 min, or a taxi might be £20.   (updated Dec 2019)
52.3725-1.4797223 Coventry Airport (CVT  IATA). Has no commercial flights. As of 2021 it's still in use for private aviation but may close altogether, as there are proposals to turn the area into factory space.   (updated Jul 2023)
By boat[edit]
52.4134-1.5121 Coventry Canal. Starts just outside the ring road, to the north of the city centre. After five miles it connects with the Oxford Canal at Hawkesbury Junction, then the Ashby-de-la-Zouch Canal at Marston Junction, just outside Bedworth. It next meets the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal at Fazeley Junction, near Tamworth. Finally, it joins the Trent and Mersey Canal at Fradley, 38 miles from Coventry and near Lichfield. Operating a boat in the canal requires a licence from the Canal and River trust. Boats are available for hire from various providers on the canal network.   (updated May 2020)

Pool Meadow Bus Station
By bus[edit]
There are a plethora of buses serving Coventry, all run by National Express, although first time users or those unfamiliar with city bus transport can find the number of different routes intimidating.

Daysaver tickets for unlimited travel within the Coventry area for one day are £4 for adults and £3.10 for those under 16.

52.4104-1.5074 Pool Meadow Bus Station (not far from the cathedral; adjacent to the Transport Museum). Served by local and national routes.   (updated May 2020)
By car[edit]
Coventry's city centre is not very car-friendly. With the pedestrianisation of large tracts of the central business district, travelling in the confusing patchwork of roads winding around the pedestrian quarters can be very frustrating. The ringroad surrounding the city centre is a very quick method of getting around, but its frantic pace and multiple sudden exits make it notoriously difficult for visitors. There is ongoing construction work outside the town hall and Herbert Art Gallery which will further restrict accessibility by car, narrowing the road down from two lanes to one.
In contrast, the city's suburbs are much better suited for car transport, although as expected in a city, rush hours tend to be very busy.

By taxi[edit]
Many firms operate within Coventry. Black cabs can be flagged down on the street but private hire taxis must be booked.
Popular firms include:

 Allens Taxis, ☏ +44 2476 555 555. Operating since 1938. (updated Dec 2017)

By bike[edit]
Central Coventry is fairly flat, and good for cycling. Cyclists may use the ring road, but are best advised not to do so; quieter side roads are available for the same journeys.

A new cathedral was built 1956-1962 next to the old (which now forms a memorial) to a design by Basil Spence.
