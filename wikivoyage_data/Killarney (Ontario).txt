Killarney is a town of 400 people (2016) in Northeastern Ontario.


Understand[edit]
Many tourists visit Killarney for its rugged hiking trails, majestic mountains, turquoise lakes and jack pines. The Killarney area's economy is based primarily on tourism, consisting mainly of wilderness lodges, campgrounds and retail services geared toward campers and other visitors to Killarney Provincial Park. Along the waterfront, there are gifts shops, cafés, bars and restaurants open during the summer.
The area was named after the town of Killarney in Ireland.
The ghost towns of French River and Key Harbour are also located within the boundaries of Killarney.

History[edit]
The first European settler was French-Canadian fur trader Étienne Augustin de Lamorandière and his Anishinaabe wife Josephte Saisaigonokwe, who established a trading post named Shebahonaning (canoe passage) at the townsite in 1820.
Killarney was operated as a fishing camp by the Fruehauf Trailer Company in Detroit, USA. Clients and guests would be flown in on sea planes for vacations during the warmer summer months. The community relied on water transport until Highway 637, connecting Killarney to Highway 69, was constructed in 1962.

Most of the 645 km2 (249 sq mi) park is undeveloped wilderness thanks to the efforts of a group of influential artists, including members of the Group of Seven, who pressured the Ontario government to spare the area from logging. Today, the park provides both backcountry camping, portaging, car camping, and a range of outdoor activities all year long. Many people visit the park to get a taste of the Canadian shield before planning trips in larger or more remote parks.   (updated Jan 2018)
