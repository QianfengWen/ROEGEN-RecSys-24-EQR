Belmonte is a town in Beira Baixa, Portugal.


Understand[edit]
Sinagoga Bet Eliahu

Belmonte (behl-MOHN-t(ih), /bɛɫ.ˈmõ.tɨ/) has the only Jewish community in the Iberian peninsula that survived the inquisitions. They were able to do so by observing a strict rule of endogamy and going to great lengths to conceal their faith from their neighbours, with many even going to church and publicly carrying out Christian rites. As a result of their history, these Jews tend to be very secretive, though some are slowly beginning to reconnect with the worldwide Jewish community.
