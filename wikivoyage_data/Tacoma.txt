The skyline of Tacoma, with the Tacoma Bridge in the foreground.
Tacoma in the state of Washington, is the state's second-largest city, with just under 220,000 residents. It has a dynamic art scene and a great ballet.


Understand[edit]
Tacoma often gets a negative description reminiscent of the one given to Oakland, California. These negative vibes are equally unrealistic and often come from those who have never lived in or even visited the city. While it has neither the tourist amenities of its neighbor Seattle to the north nor the suburban safety of Olympia to the south, you can certainly spend a few pleasant days in Tacoma.

Get around[edit]
By car[edit]
The area's roads are designed more or less around a grid system, where most roads are numbered based on their distance from the city center. Addresses also conform to the numbering of the roads around them. Nearly all streets run with the compass directions. "A" Street, one block east of Pacific Ave (SR-7), divides east from south while Orchard Street divides south from west.  6th Avenue and Division Avenue divide north from south. The numbered roads run east-west, parallel to 6th Avenue, while the named roads run north-south (except for one corner in the North End where everything is rotated by 60°).  The addresses on the opposite side of Commencement Bay towards Federal Way between the bay and the King/Pierce County line are in the northeast (NE) part of town. The addresses in Gig Harbor & Key Peninsula all have northwest (NW) designations and Lakewood and Steilacoom are in the Southwest part of town with SW addresses. This also applies to much of the extended areas of unincorporated Pierce County, though the addresses in places like Fife, Milton, Puyallup & Sumner have their own numbering system and are not based on Tacoma's numbering system.  Some of the same streets will change names when it crosses from one city/municipality to the next.

Stay safe[edit]
While Tacoma's crime problem has improved over the past decade, the city still has a high crime rate relative to other Northwest cities. Much of the crime is concentrated on the Hilltop and Eastside neighborhoods and the hotels along S Hosmer/Steele St between 8400-9900 blocks, particularly at a boarded up hotel on 8820 S Hosmer St and its surrounding area(s). The Stadium District area towards the north end has the lowest crime rate in the city and Downtown has a low crime rate compared to downtown areas of other cities (including Seattle), however visitors should be cautious as in any urban area. Visitors should also be careful when entering the surrounding suburbs of Lakewood, Spanaway and Parkland. Crime problems in Lakewood sometimes run over into near by Parkland. As always when traveling alone or at night, avoid poorly-lit areas with little foot traffic.

Near Tacoma are some other things worth visiting, listed roughly north to south:

To the northwest, the waterfront town[dead link] of Gig Harbor. I-5 to exit 132 (WA Hwy 16)  A great place to see the bridge is by visiting the park below and slightly adjacent to the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. Going north from the bridge, take the first exit (24th St NW) and follow the signs (several left turns). On a very clear day, Mount Rainier will be in the background to the east, beyond the waterway.
Seattle, north of Tacoma, has a lot to do for visitors.
To the northeast, Rhododendron Species Foundation and Garden, and the adjacent Pacific Bonsai Museum in Federal Way, just off Interstate 5.
Wild Waves, a water-themed amusement park, also in Federal Way, just off Interstate 5.
To the south, Lakewold Gardens Estate, in Lakewood.
Also to the south, Northwest Trek, a 615-acre park that is home to more than 200 North American animals.
To the southeast, Mount Rainier National Park, and the nearby Mt. Rainier Railroad.
To the southwest is Washington's easygoing capital city, Olympia.
