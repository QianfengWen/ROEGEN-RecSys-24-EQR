The Town Hall in Clausthal-Zellerfeld
Clausthal-Zellerfeld is a town in the Upper Harz in Lower Saxony. It is the largest town of the Oberharz community and is at an altitude of 535 m ASL. It is great for winter activities, and for walking and mountain biking during the rest of the year. Clausthal has a well-known university, Aula Academica. The town has a picturesque low mountain range landscape with crystal clear waters in more than 60 ponds and flowering meadows.


Understand[edit]
Clausthal-Zellerfeld consists of two towns: Clausthal and Zellerfeld. The towns were merged in 1924, and had about 16,000 residents in 2019. Buntenbock, about 3 km south of Clausthal, was added to the town in 1972. It has about 700 residents. Wildemann and its 800 residents were added in 2015.
The university was opened in 1775 and used to be a school for children and a centre for mining apprentices. In 1864 it was established as a mining academy, and also taught physics, chemistry, mathematics and engineering. Today the university has about 3000 students.
Clausthal's focus is on university life and the business world, where as Zellerfeld is the tourist centre of the town. The "culture mile" is worth a visit: St. Salvatoris church with a famous altarpiece by Werner Tübke, the Upper Harz Mining Museum, and the former mint (Kunsthandwerkerhof). Every Thursday evening from May to October there is the Zellerfeld popular farmers' market. The town offers free parking on Adolph-Roemer-Straße in Clausthal. The picturesque houses in the town are built in the style of the typical Upper Harz.
In the town you can buy various local specialities, such as meat and sausages. Why not try the Harzer witch bread (from the Meier confectionery), which is produced only in Clausthal-Zellerfeld, or the Clausthal Elixir.
Both parts of the town have some beautiful historic buildings. In Clausthal is the Market Church "To the Holy Spirit". The original church was destroyed by fire in 1634. It was replaced with a wooden church, which was completed in 1642. It is now the largest wooden church in Germany and can seat up to 2200 people and boasts a massive organ and a great altar. In the south-western corner you can find an alabaster carving of the story of Christ. In Zellerfeld, you can find many craftsmen's houses, which were rebuilt after the fire in 1672. One of the main industries was the production of silver and gold coins. In 1978 the former mint was converted into a glass-blower. Today you can watch the traditional craftsmen close up and discover how glass is blown.
