Culross is a very attractive village in Fife on the north bank of the Firth of Forth. In the 16th and 17th centuries its merchants grew rich from coal, salt and limestone, trading especially with the Low Countries, and building themselves fine town houses. Those industries moved elsewhere in the 19th century, so Culross was preserved from later development, and in the 20th century was restored. It's pronounced KOO-lross with just the faintest "l" sound. In 2020 together with Valleyfield it had a population of 2280.

See[edit]
Town centre is picture-perfect. Much of it is 17th century Low Countries style, with crow-stepped gables, and red pantile roofs as Dutch roof tiles were used as ballast by ships returning from trading. You can tour the Palace and ruined Abbey, and admire the exteriors of the other fine buildings.
56.0556-3.63111 Culross Palace, Culross KY12 8JH, ☏ +44 1383 880359. Apr-Sep daily 10AM-5PM, Mar & Oct daily 10AM-4PM. Built early 17th century by Sir George Bruce, using materials (and wealth) gathered from his European trade in timber, coal and salt. The interior is richly decorated in 17th- and 18th-century style, with a large porcelain collection, and the garden has been restored to that era. Now run by the National Trust for Scotland, it was never a royal palace but King James VI visited in 1617 and was intrigued by Sir George's ability to mine beneath the sea. (Excellent drainage was the secret.) The tour brought the king out of an air-shaft onto an islet, with his guards and courtiers mute in the distance across the water — "Treason!" he squealed. Adult £13, conc £10, NTS / NT free.   (updated Apr 2024)
56.0583-3.62552 Culross Abbey, Kirk St KY12 8JF. 24 hours. Ruins of a Cistercian abbey and monastery founded in 1217: it fell derelict after the 16th century Reformation but wasn't smashed up as other abbeys were. It became the mausoleum for Sir George Bruce and family, then was incorporated into the parish church which is still in use. Free.   (updated Apr 2024)
56.0603-3.64013 West Kirk is a medieval ruin reached by walking down the narrow lane west of the Abbey - don't bring a car. Already by 1633 Parliament recorded the "old kirk quhairine seruice is not nor hes not beine vsit since memorie of man, and is altogether rwinous, decayit, and falline downe in divers pairts." There's even less of it now except bosky stumps and mossy gravestones, you only come for the walk and the fun of finding it.
56.0552-3.64384 Dunimarle Castle, Culross KY12 8JN, ☏ +44 7713 629040. Apr-Oct Th-Su 10:00-16:00. The original medieval castle is just a ruin. The adjacent 18th century mansion can be visited by guided tour: these are weekly during summer.   (updated Apr 2024)
56.05-3.5965 Preston Island became a peninsula of reclaimed land in the 19th century, with coal mines and salt production. The area has now been landscaped; stroll here for views over the Forth.
