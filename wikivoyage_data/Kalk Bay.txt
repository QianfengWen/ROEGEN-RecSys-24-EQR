Kalk Bay is a small fishing harbour along the east coast of the Cape Peninsula to the south of Cape Town. It has become a very hip and trendy place, with a fine selection of restaurants, coffee shops and bistros, and a number of eclectic, alternative shops along the Main Road on either side of the train station.

Go next[edit]
The next town towards Cape Point is Fish Hoek, with a safe swimming beach.
Towards Cape Point is the historical village of Simon's Town, a South African Naval base, which is great fun to visit. There is a statue of Just Nuisance, a Teddy Bear Museum and a Gemstone Factory.
A little further on is  Boulders Beach, which has one of the few land-based African penguin colonies. These endemic penguins come right up onto the beach and among the resident's gardens, where they nest. Then on to Cape Point, where two oceans meet there are baboons and lots of wild flowers and animals in the Game and Nature Reserve. Curios are available from the African Arts and Crafts village. Kommetjie is famous for surfing (large waves), crayfishing and bird life.
Going towards Cape Town is Muizenberg, famous for its surfing
