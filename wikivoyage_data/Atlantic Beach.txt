Atlantic Beach is a small town of 1,500 people (as of 2016) in the Crystal Coast region North Carolina. A popular seaside vacation town since the 1920s, Atlantic Beach is on Bogue Banks, part of the southern Outer Banks chain of barrier islands, between Bogue Sound and the Atlantic Ocean. The nearby communities of Pine Knoll Shores and Salter Path are often considered to be part of Atlantic Beach.


Get in[edit]
The most direct way to reach Atlantic Beach, if you're coming from the direction of Raleigh, is down US-70 to Havelock. Atlantic Beach is on NC-58, which runs the length of Bogue Banks. It's only possible to cross to the island at two points: from Morehead City into Atlantic Beach on the eastern end, and from Cape Carteret to Emerald Isle on the western end. Both crossings are large bridges with pleasant scenic views.

Get around[edit]

The island of Bogue Banks is only 26 miles from one end to the other, but due to the reduced speed limit, you'll need about 45 minutes to travel the entire length. At some points, the island narrows to only a third of a mile wide, giving you excellent views of the ocean and the sound. Mile marker signposts are placed along Highway 58 every half-mile, and these are often used for giving directions.
There is no public transportation on the island, but you can hitch a lift with one of several reliable taxi companies.

See[edit]
34.695556-76.6888891 Fort Macon State Park, ☏ +1 252-726-3775. Daily 9AM-5:30PM (except Christmas Day). Fort Macon is a five-sided brick and stone fort with 26 vaulted rooms, which was used during the 18th and 19th centuries to protect the area from naval attacks by pirates or enemy warships. Today the site features exhibits about the fort's history, restored quarters, and occasional re-enactments. Guided tours are available. Visitors can also fish, hike, swim and picnic in the park grounds surrounding the fort.   (updated Apr 2016)
34.6999-76.82942 The North Carolina Aquarium at Pine Knoll Shores, 1 Roosevelt Blvd, toll-free: +1-866-294-3477. The aquarium takes visitors on a tour of North Carolina’s amazing aquatic life "from the mountains to the sea." The journey is arranged in five galleries: Mountain, Piedmont, Coastal Plain, Tidal Waters and Ocean. Among the 38 innovative exhibits are re-created shipwrecks that showcase the diverse marine life attracted to these sunken vessels. The 306,000-gallon Living Shipwreck display in the Ocean Gallery features a three-quarter-size replica of a German U-boat that was sunk off Cape Lookout in World War II. The Queen Anne’s Revenge duplicates the 18th century artifacts in Beaufort Inlet thought to be the wreckage of the pirate Blackbeard’s flagship. Visitors also get a view of a pair of playful river otters, a roaring mountain waterfall, a sea turtle rehabilitation area, and a jellyfish gallery. Touch pools allow personal contact with stingrays, hermit crabs, whelks and other creatures. The Aquarium offers an array of activities and field trips, and has facilities for weddings, celebrations and meetings. Visitors also will find a large gift shop and a snack bar. 
Do[edit]
The heart of downtown is the Circle, the local name for the culmination of the Atlantic Beach Causeway in a traffic circle by the beach. The Circle is fringed with souvenir shops and a boardwalk along the beach; large groups of teens and young adults are often to be found playing volleyball, sunbathing or listening to music. The area is being renovated, with upscale retail shops and restaurants joining the touristy kitsch.
There are miles of beautiful beaches where you can take a stroll or sunbathe; they can be fairly busy during the day, unless you walk beyond the crowds (particularly around Fort Macon), but they're also quite pretty for moonlight strolls at night. There are beach access points up and down the coast; some are only available to residents of the adjacent hotel or condo, but there are several with large parking lots for public access.
 Atlantic Station Cinemas (W Fort Macon Road in the Atlantic Station Shopping Center (mile marker 3)), ☏ +1-252-247-7016. The only movie theatre in town, with four screens, snack counter and arcade games. 
By far the most popular dance with the Crystal Coast community is the amusingly-named shag, which some even claim was invented in Atlantic Beach. It's usually done to classic beach music. If you want to take shagging lessons (yes, we know), they're offered at Memories Beach and Shag Club, 128 E Fort Macon Road (mile marker 1.5), +1 252-240-7424.
Go for a hike along the Hoop Pole Creek Nature Trail, off Highway 58, in a 31-acre maritime forest.
If you like sailing, there are plenty of opportunities for it on the Intracoastal Waterway of Bogue Sound, or in the Atlantic Ocean.
 AB WaterSport, 612 Atlantic Beach Causeway, ☏ +1 252-422-0520. Daily 9AM-6PM. Daily sailing and kayak rentals, group and private instruction, sunset sails and dinner cruises. Sailing classes are $60-90; ocean cruises are $45-75; hourly rentals are $10-15 for kayaks and $30-40 for sailboats. 
If you're more of a fisherman, you can take a stroll down one of the local piers. Because of damage by hurricanes Bertha, Fran and Bonnie in the 1990s, and real-estate developers afterwards, the piers in the area are dwindling. Out of eight that once existed on the island, there are only two left today, one of which is in Atlantic Beach:
 Oceanana, 700 E Fort Macon Road, ☏ +1 252-726-0863. Fishing pier attached to the Oceanana Family Resort.

Deep-sea cruises are $45 for shark fishing, $60 half-day, $90 full day (adult prices); overnight trips are $160. 
Buy[edit]
Beach shops are abundant, if you're desperately in need of a surfboard, beach towel, flip-flops, sunglasses, or a lucite dolphin sculpture. Two of the more prominent ones are listed below, but you'll see plenty of others in the nearby vicinity:

Wings[dead link], 101 W Fort Macon Road, +1 252-499-0473; and 200 W Fort Macon Road, +1 252-240-5363. The largest beach shop on the island, with beach apparel, souvenirs and accessories.
 Bert's Surf Shop, 304 W Fort Macon Rd, ☏ +1 252-726-1730. A local chain (North Carolina plus Myrtle Beach) offering beachwear, surfing gear, skateboards and accessories. 
Otherwise, you mostly have the traditional beach gifts: seashells, things carved out of seashells, things made from seashells, things made from driftwood, salt-water taffy and nautical-themed items. A lot of it is tacky and cheap; some of it is really nice quality.
A couple of specialty shops that might come in handy for your seaside vacation needs:

 Kites Unlimited & BirdStuff, etc., 1010 W Fort Macon Rd, ☏ +1 252-247-7011, don@kitesandbirds.com. Atlantic Station Shopping Center.

If you want to mix your own drinks, there's an ABC store at 101 Cedar Lane, +1 252-726-3221, open M-Sa. Otherwise, you can check out one of the local nightspots:

 Beach Tavern (BT), 413 W Fort Macon Rd, ☏ +1 252-247-4466. Right near the center of town, is a bar and restaurant that is an AB tradition. It attracts all kinds of folks, from locals to tourists, and features pool tables and liquor. Cash only, but there is an ATM.

Sleep[edit]
As with many coastal areas, visitors can choose between cheap motel or upscale hotel rooms rented by the night, or a beach cottage by the week. Prices are highly variable, usually running between $60 - $150 per night; prices naturally go up with the quality of the lodging establishment and, in particular, proximity to the beach.
