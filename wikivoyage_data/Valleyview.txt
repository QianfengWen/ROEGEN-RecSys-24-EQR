History[edit]
In the late 1800s, the first Europeans to visit the area arrived, seeking natives to exchange goods for furs. The trading was good and a Hudson’s Bay Company post was established on Sturgeon Lake. ‘Peace River Jim’ Cornwall established the Bredin and Cornwall Trading Post nearby.
In 1916, the first pioneers settled in the area nearby as its soil was rich for farming.
