University of California, Berkeley

For other places with the same name, see Berkeley (disambiguation).

Set on sparkling San Francisco Bay, Berkeley (pronounced BURK-lee) will surprise those who recall it as the counter-culture center of the 1960s. Free Speech and flower power are forever in the city "DNA," but Berkeley has evolved into a culinary and cultural travel destination. You'll still see more tie-dye per capita in Berkeley, but a deeper look reveals a dynamic East Bay city filled with superb theaters, restaurants, and shops. Berkeley's progressive, free-thinking environment has seen the birth of quality attractions, great food from many cultures, and of course the internationally renowned University of California, Berkeley. For a city of just over 100,000 people—barely a medium-sized city in the California context—Berkeley is extremely complex.

Like the rest of the Bay Area, Berkeley has a mild climate, with wet, mild winters and dry summers. The high temperature is typically in the 60s °F (between 15 and 20 °C). The city's position directly across the bay from the Golden Gate ensures that Berkeley gets its share of fog, with mornings typically cool and foggy, followed by sunny afternoons, with the fog returning at night. The city's location also means you may experience brisk winds coming off the bay if in an exposed area: typically, the marina or a hillside facing the bay.

By plane[edit]
Oakland International Airport (OAK IATA) is the closest option. Take the BART to OAK "people mover" ($6 extra fare) or the AC Transit #73 bus ($2.10) to the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) Oakland Airport station, and then take a Richmond-bound train to the Downtown Berkeley station ($2.40). Alternatively, you can use a rental car and drive up Interstates 880 and 80 to the University Avenue exit. There are also shuttle van services, providing door-to-door service.
San Francisco International Airport is also convenient.  BART runs from the International Terminal to Berkeley in just under 1 hour. Driving without traffic is as short as 35 minutes, but at commute hours can take up to 2 hours. From SFO, take US Highway 101 north and then Interstate 80 east, crossing the San Francisco Bay Bridge. Stay on I-80 east and exit at one of the 3 Berkeley exits: Ashby Avenue, University Avenue, or Gilman Street.
San Jose International Airport (SJC IATA) is in the region. A rental car or shuttle service is likely fastest and easiest, public transportation is possible but very time-consuming (a little over two hours). San Jose is considerably farther from Berkeley than San Francisco (at least an hour's drive in no traffic) and is not recommended.
By train[edit]
Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), +1 415 989-2278, a regional commuter rail and subway system, offers frequent service to Berkeley from San Francisco (including the airport), Oakland Airport and other parts of the East Bay. If you are visiting San Francisco and planning a side-trip to Berkeley, BART is the easiest and fastest way to go. Trains run roughly every 15-20 minutes and the trip time is about the same. Berkeley is served by two lines, one of which heads south through Oakland to Fremont, while the other runs through West Oakland and under the San Francisco Bay to San Francisco and the peninsula. Three BART stations serve Berkeley: Ashby, Downtown Berkeley (sometimes just "Berkeley" on older signs), and North Berkeley.  The Downtown Berkeley stop, at Shattuck Avenue and Center Street, is the best stop for tourists and close to the UC Berkeley campus (1 block) as well as restaurants, shops, theaters and other popular Berkeley destinations. Allow 20-30 minutes from any of the Market Street stations in downtown San Francisco (Embarcadero, Montgomery St., Powell St., Civic Center/UN Plaza) to Downtown Berkeley station. Fares are based on the distance traveled: the regular adult fare is $4.35 for a one-way trip from any of the Market Street stations in San Francisco, $2.10 from downtown Oakland, $9.30 from Oakland Coliseum/Airport, and $10.30 from San Francisco International Airport. (Pay by Clipper card, which is a reloadable smart card that can also be used on other Bay Area transit systems. Fares using Youth Clipper or Senior/Disabled Clipper cards are less. For fare details visit the BART fare calculator.)
Amtrak offers service to Berkeley via the Berkeley station, Emeryville station, or Richmond station. Consult 511.org for details on how to get from the Amtrak stations to your destination. Sadly, the Berkeley Amtrak station is at the edge of the city, under University Avenue at 4th Street, near the marina.  However, it is at the start of the line for the #51B AC Transit bus, which runs every 10 minutes at peak times, 15–20 minutes at most other times, and once an hour after midnight, and will take you to downtown Berkeley, the University, College Avenue, and just about every shopping area in town.  Alternatively, if you are traveling to downtown Berkeley or the University, transfer to BART at the Richmond station and travel on BART to the downtown Berkeley station.
By car[edit]
From San Francisco, Berkeley is a simple 15-minute drive (45 minutes or more with congestion) east on Interstate 80 across the Bay Bridge and up to University Avenue.
From Sacramento, Berkeley is an hour and a half drive west on Interstate 80.
From Los Angeles and Southern California, Berkeley is a 6-hour drive up Interstate 5, then west on Interstate 580.
By bus[edit]
Greyhound offers bus service to nearby Oakland and San Francisco.
Local bus service is provided by AC Transit. For specific itineraries, visit the 511.org website.
During the school year, the university has buses (Bear Transit) that run every 15 minutes between downtown, the BART station, and most parts of campus.  If boarding downtown, the stop is on the uphill side of Shattuck Avenue in front of the Arinell Pizza.  Fare is $1 during the day, and free at night after 7:30PM.
By boat[edit]
There are ferries from San Francisco to nearby Oakland, but are probably most useful as a scenic method of travel.
If you are traveling by private boat or charter yacht, Berkeley has a 1,000 berth marina, the largest municipal marina in the Bay Area. Both the Berkeley Marina and the Berkeley Yacht Club offer guest berthing.

Get around[edit]
Berkeley Map
By car[edit]
Cars are most useful far away from downtown (i.e. not near the campus) or in Berkeley's steep hills.  It's often better to stay on the main roads unless you know your way because of the many road barriers to prevent through traffic in residential areas. Be mindful of cyclists and pedestrians; many cyclists often ride in lanes (as is their legal right in California), and pedestrians may expect cars to stop for them. Remember that as a motorist, you need to be especially cautious in order to avoid harming cyclists and pedestrians. Be very careful when driving near the University as students tend to have the mindset that they have the right of way. To further confuse drivers many roads near the university are one way roads (and can turn so spontaneously, so watch signs at major intersections) or are closed to certain drivers.
Parking can be difficult and expensive near campus and downtown. The easiest and most expensive means of parking is in one of the several garages. The biggest garage near campus is the Telegraph Channing Garage. Many stores on Telegraph have validation coupons discounting hourly parking 50% or $5 off all-day parking. Arrive after 8PM and pay only $4 night rate until closing. Most street parking is either metered (expect to pay at least $1.50 per hour) or 2-hour, but free after 6PM. If you are visiting a resident, they can purchase a one-day or 14-day visitor street parking pass (not valid in metered spots) for you at city services in downtown. If you are fortunate to find a non-metered street parking close to your destination, you can usually park for free for two hours. Be aware of street sweeping signs.  Street sweeping is usually once a month, but the day varies from street to street (even from one side of the street to the other), and a good rule of thumb is that if it seems like the street parking on one side is too good to be true, then double-check it isn't street sweeping day. City parking fines run from $48 (Street sweeping and lack of permit in 2 hours spot) to over $300 (Disabled spot violations), and city parking enforcement is particularly vigilant: you can and will get multiple tickets for the same violation if you don't move quickly (parking 30 minutes in the 5 minute yellow zone can yield five separate $80 tickets).  Even if you find a free "unlimited" parking spot, you have to move your car every 72 hours without exception.  Check this parking map of Berkeley to find free parking and know when street cleaning applies.
The Eastshore Freeway which runs along the city's western edge is part of a short concurrency of I-80 and I-580 that may confuse some drivers. Heading south on the freeway toward the Bay Bridge and San Francisco, drivers are simultaneously following I-80 west and I-580 east. Drivers unfamiliar with the area should ensure they know whether their destination is toward Oakland and San Francisco or toward Richmond and Sacramento. These cities supplement the route designations at entrances to this freeway.

Car sharing[edit]
Rates are usually by the hour or the day, depending on the individual service. Getaround, Gig Car Share, Upshift and Zipcar offer easily-accessible services to account holders city-wide.

By public transit[edit]
Public transportation is thus an important consideration in getting to and around downtown and near the university. BART is the fastest connection to Oakland, Silicon Valley and San Francisco.  The Berkeley BART station in Downtown Berkeley is usually the best option for travelers; the Ashby station is in a seedier part of South Berkeley and the North Berkeley station is located in a residential neighborhood near University Ave.  AC Transit goes places BART doesn't, such as the trendy Fourth Street commercial district (line 51B), the upscale Rockridge neighborhood (line 51B to 51A) and the resurgent Temescal commercial district in nearby North Oakland (line 6 or nearby 18).  Check 511.org for trip planning for more information.

By bicycle[edit]
Weather permitting, the best way to get around quickly near downtown Berkeley or near campus is on bicycle. Bicycle theft is a serious problem in Berkeley; if you ride your bike, be sure to lock your front wheel as well as the frame. Some choose to remove the seat as well, however this precaution is likely unnecessary if you are only leaving your bike for a short period of time and not overnight. AC Transit buses have racks on the front for bicycles. Bicycles are allowed on BART, but not on San Francisco bound trains during morning rush hour, and do not bring your bicycle in the first car. Check with BART before you leave or you'll get a warning from BART Police and forced to wait until permitted or else face a fine and a stern look from the officer. Folding bicycles are always allowed.

Bike sharing[edit]
Most bike-sharing is through Bay Wheels, which has docking stations around the city. LimeBike mostly provides their rental scooters (green of course). Both tend to be quite pricey. Bay Wheels's machines allow only a limited time of use: 30 minutes at a time for a day-long access pass or 45 minutes a ride for an annual membership fee.

On foot[edit]
Walking is the least expensive and most effective means of getting around downtown and near campus. You will very quickly outpace most drivers near campus.  Take BART or AC Transit to the Berkeley station in downtown (the North Berkeley station is in a residential neighborhood).

In addition to offering a wide range of lodging accommodations, Berkeley hotels and inns are increasingly eco-travel friendly.  As of January 2013, more than 60% of the rooms in Berkeley are certified "Green" by the Bay Area Green Business Program (BAGBP).  If you are looking for chain hotels the nearby city of Emeryville is south of Berkeley and is home to more national brands.
It is illegal to park a "heavy-duty" vehicle on city streets overnight (2–5AM) in Berkeley, unless you first obtain a temporary permit.  RVs are generally considered to fall into this class.

Budget[edit]
The nearest camping area is in the Tilden Regional Park, for groups only.

Connect[edit]
Berkeley, like most of the cities in Alameda County, is in the 510 area code. 10-digit dialing is required for all outgoing calls.
Internet access is widespread. Most coffee shops offer wireless internet access. Public terminals are available at the 37.86815-122.268466 Berkeley Public Library in Downtown as well as the 37.87221-122.259237 UC Berkeley Doe library. University guests can request access to the "AirBears" campus-wide Wi-Fi network.
Mobile phone coverage is generally understood to be excellent.
Stay safe[edit]
West and South Berkeley, especially near Oakland, can be unsafe at night. While the north side is quieter and generally safer, use common sense and avoid walking alone at night.  Also be aware of your surroundings: the more bars on windows, generally the less safe the area. Bicycling is generally a safe way to get around at night; for those who prefer not to ride, free night escorts are provided by the University of California police near campus: call +1 510-642-WALK (9255).
Berkeley has a well-deserved reputation for protests, riots, and strikes, and you may see a protest or two in progress during your visit.  However, the vast majority of protests today are raucous but protesters are typically strictly nonviolent. (The same cannot always be said of the police, and it's worth keeping a wide berth of any in-progress police action unless you're willing to risk a rib or two.)  The last time the National Guard was called in to patrol the city was 1991.

Cope[edit]
The eastern area of the UC Berkeley campus is surprisingly forested, and might be a good place to get away from some frustrations. The Marina has a nice 1 mi (1.6 km) loop walk. It's windy enough for kites almost every afternoon but is often wind-free in the morning. The Whole Foods on Telegraph at Ashby has massage therapists standing by to ease your tensions.
The entire downtown and campus area is extremely packed, and traffic correspondingly congested, on Cal football game days.  These take place on about half the Saturdays during the fall semester, from late August to mid December.

Go next[edit]
When locals (and students) need to get out, they often head to "The City" -- San Francisco. It's easy to get to by BART train and a logical next step of exploration—assuming, of course, you didn't just come from there!  Oakland, just south of Berkeley, is a large and diverse city as well, with many ethnic neighborhoods less frequented by tourists than those of San Francisco.
Smaller cities around Berkeley worth checking out include Emeryville to the southwest, Albany to the north, El Cerrito further north, and Walnut Creek to the east.
The hills above Berkeley and Oakland, including Tilden and Wildcat Parks, are easily accessible by foot, car, or bicycle, and offer many hikes with spectacular views.
Marin and Sonoma Counties are moderate drives from Berkeley as well.  You might also try wine tasting in the Napa Valley.  Northeast is Sacramento, the state's capital city.
