Danbury[dead link] - nicknamed Hat City - is a city in the interior of Fairfield County, Connecticut, making it part of the Litchfield Hills region.  


Understand[edit]
Danbury is a small city located 60 miles southwest of Hartford and 70 miles (110 km) northeast of New York City. Founded in the 17th century, Danbury is the former hat capital of the United States. It was once home to the Great Danbury Fair that has since been replaced by the Danbury Fair Mall, the largest shopping mall in Connecticut. The city has a population of about 75,000 people. It is home to Western Connecticut State University. 
In 2020 Danbury made headlines because T.V. personality John Oliver started a "feud" with the city with locals (including the mayor) taking it in stride, opening a "John Oliver Memorial Sewer Plant" in his honor.
