Searchlight Minehead
Searchlight Rag by Scott Joplin
Searchlight is a former mining town in Southern Nevada, between Boulder City and Laughlin.


Understand[edit]
Searchlight was founded as a mining town shortly after prospector George Frederick Colton struck gold in the area in 1857. He apparently used a searchlight (type of lantern) and the town took its name from that.
In 1907, composer and pianist Scott Joplin wrote the song Searchlight Rag after the town because he and some friends went prospecting there. You may recognize it from the popular video game Rollercoaster Tycoon.
In 2010, the town was depicted in the video game Fallout: New Vegas along with nearby Goodsprings and Primm. Situated in the southeastern corner of the in-game map, the Camp Searchlight had become heavily irradiated due to sabotage by the Roman-inspired Caesar's Legion faction. 

Climate[edit]
Searchlight has a typical desert climate with hot days and cold nights. It is constantly arid with little rainfall, hot summers and warm winters.

Gambling[edit]




If you win...
Chances are that, if you win it big in Searchlight and you are not a U.S. citizen your winnings will be subject to a 30% withholding tax from the Internal Revenue Service. That $10,000 slot winning can dwindle quite quickly if that is taken off the top. Not to worry though you can reclaim your gambling winnings tax through a 1042-S form. You should get this from the casino so don't lose it: it is your starting ticket to getting your gambling winnings back.
