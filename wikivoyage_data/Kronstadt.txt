Kronstadt (Russian: Кроншта́дт, Kronshtádt) is a city of 44,000 people (2018) and military seaport on Kotlin Island, off Saint Petersburg, in the Gulf of Finland.


Understand[edit]
Naval Cathedral
Kronstadt was founded by Emperor Peter the Great in 1704 as a maritime fortress and naval base on Kotlin Island. The name "Kronstadt" was invented by Peter the Great, and in German means "Crown City".
The port is ice-bound for 140–160 days in the year, from the beginning of December to April. A very large proportion of the inhabitants are sailors.
The Kronstadt Sea Fortress used to be considered the most fortified port in the world. Kronstadt still retains some of the "forts", small fortified artificial islands. Others were destroyed or recycled during the construction of the Saint Petersburg Flood Prevention Facility Complex, a brand new dam of protective structures, which connects the island to the shore and is part of the federal city's Ring Road. There used to be 42 such forts in line between the southern and northern shores of the Gulf of Finland. Some fortifications were inside the city, and one was on the western shore of the Kronslot Island (on the other side of the main navigational channel).
Until 1998, Kronstadt was a closed city, from then on it became a touristic attraction with free access to its territory. The exception is Kronstadt military harbor, and the territories of various military units stationed in the city and surrounding area. The architecture of the city center and city walls mostly dates from the first half of the 19th century. 
In the 1970s and 80s, modern neighborhoods were built on the outskirts of the city.

59.99161429.7777921 Naval Cathedral (Морско́й собо́р святи́теля Никола́я Чудотво́рца), Yakornaya Ploschad ("Anchor Square") (the city center). Tu-Th 11:00-18:00 (office - 17:00). First built in 1728–31, the present structure was built in 1903–1913, as the main church of the Baltic Fleet, dedicated to all fallen seamen. It had a very tumultuous story, having been a cinema hall in Soviet times. It was reconsecrated in April 2012, when Russian president Dmitry Medvedev declared the cathedral "looks better than 100 years ago." Repairs were completed in 2013, in time for the cathedral's centennial anniversary.   
59.99114829.773772 Makarov Bridge (Макаровский мост) (between Anchor Square and Ravine Park). A cast-iron riveted structure on a granite base with wooden flooring, completed in 1913. According to legend, emperor Nikolai II was afraid to be the first to walk on this pedestrian bridge, which looked light and airy; one of the officers checked the way by going to Anchor Square, and the emperor rewarded him for courage. Reportedly, it was built in just three months, with naval technology. In 1970, the crossing was reconstructed, and the wooden flooring was replaced with metal sheets coated with asphalt.

59.98919429.7624583 Kronstadt Sea Gauge (Кронштадтский футшток и Мореограф), Makarovskaya ulitsa 1 (at the Blue Bridge, near the former Italian palace, at the waterfront). Sea level observations on Kotlin Island began in 1707. This monitoring was necessary because the water level of the Finnish Gulf could change considerably in a short time, creating problems for shipping. The annual flood also required close monitoring of the water level. The Kronstadt sea-gauge ("Mareograf") is the zero level of the Baltic system of highs and lows. Inside a yellow pavilion on the canal bank near the sea-gauge rod, is the tide gauge, a self-registering device. All depths and altitudes (even the heights of spacecraft) in Russia and some other countries of the former Russian Empire are measured according to the Kronstadt sea-gauge. A plaque on the Blue Bridge records the 3,67 m reached by the famous 1824 massive flood, cited by Pushkin on his poem The Bronze Horseman. Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, said in 1967 that it was "the Hub of the Universe". (updated Jun 2020)

Alexander Stepanovich Popov (1859 – 1906) was the Russian inventor of a radio receiving device. His work as a teacher at a Russian naval school led him to explore high frequency electrical phenomena. On May 7, 1895, he presented a paper on a wireless lightning detector he had built that worked via using a coherer to detect radio noise from lightning strikes.

The "Crown Lock", Peter The Great's brainchild, was built in record time, to guard the main fairway's southern flank, and caught the Swedish by surprise in 1704.

This fort began to be built in the winter of 1808 under the threat of war with England, which did not happen. After the 1824 flood, it was slowly rebuilt for several decades and ended only after the end of the Crimean War of 1853-1856. The current name of the fort was bestowed in 1834, in honor of emperor Nikolai I's son, Prince Konstantin Nikolaevich. The site was abandoned by the military in the 1960s. Today it functions as a historic and architectural complex with the private museum of lighthouses (with a collection of real beacon lenses, lamps and other attributes of the lighthouse life), a hotel and a marina. The fort looks derelict and not very impressive from the outside, but its inner granite structures are amazing, and its location is incredibly cool. Adult 400 руб, child 300 руб. (updated Aug 2022)
Among other picturesque public buildings, are the naval hospital, the British seamen's hospital (established in 1867), the civic hospital, admiralty (founded 1785), arsenal, dockyards and foundries, the school of marine engineering, and the English church.
