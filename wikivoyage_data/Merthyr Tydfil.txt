Merthyr Tydfil (Welsh: Merthyr Tudful) is a town and County Borough in South Wales in the historic county of Glamorgan on the southern edge of the Brecon Beacons National Park.


Understand[edit]
Merthyr Tydfil is often abbreviated to "Merthyr".
Merthyr was a major centre of coal mining and steel manufacturing and the location of the invention of the steam locomotive. In the 19th century, its population exceeded that of Swansea and of Cardiff. In the latter half of the 20th century, it suffered from serious industrial decline. In the 2010s, it started to undergo regeneration as a dormitory town for Cardiff and Swansea, and exploiting its potential for tourism based on its history and location near the Brecon Beacons National Park.
