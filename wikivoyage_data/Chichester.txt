Understand[edit]
Chichester Cross - at the heart of a busy town
Chichester has been occupied since before Roman times, when it was believed to have been one of the bridgeheads of the Roman invasion of Britain. The city centre is built on the Roman town of Noviomagus, and it benefits from the cross-shaped design favoured by the Romans - North Street, South Street, East Street and West Street converge on the Chichester Cross, a medieval market cross. The city centre is still surrounded by much of the Roman wall.
