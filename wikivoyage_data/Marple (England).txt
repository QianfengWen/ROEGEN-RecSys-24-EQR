The junction of the Peak Forest and Macclesfield Canals in Marple
Marple is a small town in the borough of Stockport, historically in Cheshire but now part of Greater Manchester. Agatha Christie often travelled this way, and named her character "Miss Marple" after her train was delayed here. The main reason to visit is to explore the canal, which ascends from Ashton by a flight of locks and crosses the river on a fine aqueduct.

The Cheshire Ring is a circuit of six canals through rural Cheshire, the edge of the Peak District, and Greater Manchester. It's 97 miles (156 km) with 92 locks and takes a week to get around, so you can hire a narrowboat at several locations, putter round the circuit, then return the boat at your starting point. It needs to be a narrowboat because many sections, including the Peak Forest Canal from Ashton-under-Lyne up to Marple, are along narrow canals, where boats may not exceed 7 foot beam. Check navigation status with the Canal & River Trust.
