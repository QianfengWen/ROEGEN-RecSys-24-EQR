Geography[edit]
This park has five lakes: Seigneurial, du Moulin, des Atocas, des Bouleaux and à la Tortue. These lakes form a hydrographic slope which drains on the south side into the Moulin stream. The latter flows towards the southwest, in particular by crossing the Lac du Village in downtown Saint-Bruno, to join the Massé stream which flows on the west bank of the Richelieu River.
The Lac Seigneurial lookout offers a beautiful view of the surrounding forest, especially when the leaves are in full color in the fall.
The eastern boundary of the park corresponds to the intermunicipal boundary with Saint-Basile-le-Grand. Part of the northern zone of the park extends into Sainte-Julie. The southwestern limit is backed by the urban area of Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville.
