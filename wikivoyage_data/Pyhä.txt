Formerly there was a Pyhätunturi ski resort in Salla as well. Now that one is known as Sallatunturi
Pyhä or Pyhätunturi  is a holiday resort and skiing centre mostly in the Pelkosenniemi municipality in Finnish Lapland. Small part extends to Kemijärvi. Being located next to one of the most popular national parks in Finland, the Pyhä-Luosto National Park, Pyhä offers activities around the year. The nearest major town is Kemijärvi 57 km away.
The after ski is moderate; Pyhä isn't as heavy party grounds as Levi.


Understand[edit]
On Kultakero of Pyhätunturi, September
The very prominent Pyhätunturi fell has been a sieidi, a sacred place, to the Sami people for ages. When Christianity arrived here, the Pyhänkasteenlähde (Holy Baptism Spring) pond was used for baptism, from 1620 until 1680. The exceptional nature values of the area were officially acknowledged in 1938 when Pyhätunturi National Park was established.
To be exact Pyhätunturi is not a single mountain but a group of five separate peaks. From east to west these are Kultakero, Ukonhattu, Noitatunturi, Laakakero and Peurakero. Noitatunturi is the highest top while all the pistes are on Kultakero. The ravines between the peaks are steep and impressive but during winter avalanches are common.
Pyhä has been popular grounds for cross-country skiing since the 1930s even though there weren't even roads to the area then. The first piste with a lift was opened in 1964 and a small hotel with a restaurant was opened in 1966. All the founders were locals. Since 1987 Pyhä has operated under the same company that runs Ruka resort in Kuusamo. During the 1990s Pyhä got a lot of fame as a party place for people in their twenties.
In 2005 the national park was extended to the Luosto fells in the north, forming the current Pyhä-Luosto National Park. There were 174,000 visitors to the park in 2018. Thanks to the national park, Pyhä is attractive also during the summer and there is strong will to develop the area, keeping the environment the first consideration and avoiding mass tourism.
During the 2010s there's been huge financial investments to the resort. Today Pyhä has 14 pistes. The Huttu-Ukko piste is the steepest maintained piste in Finland. FIS-class Piste Palander is also used for training professional alpine skiers. The resort has 5,300 beds, most of them in cottages and holiday apartments.

Get in[edit]
Road 962 towards Pyhätunturi
By car[edit]
If you arrive by car via E63, turn to road number 962 at the village Vuostimo. If you arrive via E75, turn to road 962 at the village Torvinen. The resort is well signposted. You can also take an overnight train to Rovaniemi or Kemijärvi and unload your car there for driving only the remaining distance. The price for an overnight journey, including cabins with bunk beds for four persons and car transport (check dimensions, including any add-ons), is about 2·€250+€150.

By bus[edit]
There are daily coach connections called SkiBus from Rovaniemi via the resort Luosto. The SkiBus calls at the railway station, bus station, city centre and airport before it heads to Luosto and Pyhä. A bus ticket from Rovaniemi costs €31/adult, €21/young person, €15/child or Finnish student. The trip takes about 2½ hr.
Daily coaches from Kemijärvi railway station or Kemijärvi ABC to Pyhä cost about €12/adult; the trip takes about an hour.
Check Matkahuolto for details. Use "Pyhätunturi" as your destination.

By train[edit]
Sleeper trains go from the south to Rovaniemi and Kemijärvi. If you use "Pyhä" as the destination, you might (in peak season?) get tickets that include a direct bus connection from the station to the resort.
A one-way train ticket from Helsinki to Rovaniemi or Kemijärvi costs around €200–250 for two adults sharing a sleeper cabin with bunk beds, cheaper when bought well in advance.

By plane[edit]
The nearest airport is in Rovaniemi, which has good national and some international connections. The SkiBus runs daily between the Pyhä resort and Rovaniemi airport via Luosto. The SkiBus waits for delayed flight for one hour. If your flight is delayed more than that contact Kutilan Liikenne Oy and inform them about your situation. The SkiBus costs €31/adult, €21/young person, €15/child or student.

Get around[edit]
Area is relatively small so things are mostly reachable by walking or skiing. Notice however that the resort is on the slope of the fell and there is notable elevation differences in the area.
From January to April the Pyhä shuttle drives a circular route around the resort. The shuttle is free of charge. Otherwise you need to use taxi or the long distance coaches. Check Matkahuolto for details. A SkiBus trip between Pyhä and Luosto costs €7.
