Understand[edit]
History[edit]
The community from which the city of Bartlett grew was first called Union Depot and Green Bottom. It was the last major way station in Tennessee along the stagecoach route from Nashville westward and came into being about 1830. When the Memphis & Ohio Railroad took the place of the stages, Bartlett continued as a depot. This was a farming community, with major plantations along Stage Road.
On November 1, 1866, with a population of less than a hundred, it was incorporated as a city and the name was changed to Bartlett. Upon incorporation, Bryan Wither was named the city's inaugural mayor. It was named for Major Gabriel M. Bartlett, a planter, whose homeplace was on the old Raleigh-Somerville Road (Stage Road) which is now Bartlett Station Plaza. Bartlett grew rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s largely due to white people leaving Memphis.
