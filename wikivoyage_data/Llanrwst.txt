Understand[edit]
Llanrwst centre
In 1276, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Prince of Wales, seized the town, declaring the Free Borough of Llanrwst independent from the diocese of Llanelwy. Although this was contested by the bishop, the borough retained its status through the lifetime of Llywelyn. On and off since the 13th century the town has claimed independence. Some claim that in 1947, Llanrwst town council made an unsuccessful submission to the United Nations for a seat on the security council, stating that Llanrwst was an independent state within Wales. This story is likely to be apocryphal.
