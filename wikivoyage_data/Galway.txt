Galway (Irish: Gaillimh) is the county town of County Galway on the west coast of Ireland. It's Ireland's fourth largest city, with a population in 2024 of 85,000, but its historic centre on the east bank of the River Corrib is compact and colourful. Popularised on the world stage by Ed Sheeran's song, Galway Girl, Galway is a party town with live music and revellers spilling onto its pedestrianised central street. It's also a base for exploring the scenic surrounding county.
Galway (jointly with Rijeka) was the "European Capital of Culture" for 2020.


Understand[edit]
Galway's Quay St
Galway expanded from a small fishing village from the 13th century, when the Anglo-Normans captured the area and built a fortified city. A charter of 1396 granted power to 14 merchant families, and this elite would later be mocked by Cromwell as "tribes" - hence the nickname "City of the Tribes". This illustrious 14, now immortalised in the names of the city roundabouts, were Athy, Blake, Bodkin, Browne, D'arcy, Deane, Font, ffrench, Joyce, Kirwan, Lynch, Martin, Morris, and Skerritt. All but two were Anglo-Norman rather than Gaelic. They're often described as an oligarchy, cartel or cabal, but by medieval standards 14 influential families operating an urban centre looks positively diverse. Imagine the Medici welcoming the Borgias and Sforzas to Florence: "Sure the city is big enough for all of us, and let's bring in the Albizzi, the Alberti...." They prospered through trade with Spain and Portugal, and by loyalty to the Crown, but that was the reason for Cromwell besieging and smashing the city. They recovered somewhat during the Restoration, but fell forever with the ousting of the catholic Stuart monarchy. Under the Hanoverian kings, power and fortune throughout Ireland centred on a tight little "Protestant Ascendancy", just to show everyone what a cartel or cabal really looks like. Sea trade also moved away to Dublin and Waterford. Galway stagnated until the 20th century, recovering slowly with independence, and more rapidly later with growth in students and in tourists. It's now a lively, buzzing colourful city that again feels well-connected to the rest of the world.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Dublin  (DUB IATA) has the widest selection of flights across Europe and UK, then you have a 3-4 hour journey to Galway.
Shannon (SNN IATA) has UK and European flights though not as many as Dublin, but is well-connected to the USA with pre-border clearance.
Knock (NOC IATA) has few flights, you'd only consider it for a road trip through Connaught and other northwestern areas.
The airports all have car hire, best reserved in advance, and see below for onward public transport to Galway.
The existence of Galway Airport was almost as short as its runway: commercial flights ceased in 2011 and private aviation ceased in 2015.

By train[edit]
From Dublin Heuston there are ten trains M-Sa, six on Sunday, taking 2 hr 30 min via Athlone. Buy your ticket to or from Dublin city centre not Heuston, as this will include the city tram fare and save a couple of euros over separate tickets.
From Limerick Colbert five trains run M-Sa, four on Sunday, via Ennis taking two hours. Limerick has connections from Cork.
By bus[edit]
Fountain in Eyre Square
From Dublin there's competition, with Aircoach 706, GoBus 720 and Citylink 660 / 760 / 761 all taking 2 hr 30 min from Dublin airport and city, plus Citylink 763 also stopping in Athlone and Ballinasloe.
From Limerick and Clare Bus X51 runs hourly nonstop from Limerick city to Galway, 80 min, while Bus 51 runs hourly from Cork via Mallow, Limerick, Shannon Airport, Ennis and Gort to Galway.
Bus 350 winds along the coast six times a day from Ennis via Lahinch, Cliffs of Moher, Doolin, Lisdoonvarna, Ballyvaughan, Kinvara and Oranmore.
From the north Bus 64 runs every two hours from Derry via Letterkenny, Donegal Town, Sligo and Knock Airport to Galway.
Bus 456 runs five times daily from Castlebar via  Westport to Galway.
Operators include Bus Éireann, CityLink and GoBus.
53.274-9.0481 Galway railway and bus station are side by side in Eyre Square. The railway ticket office is open M-F 07:00-18:00 and there are ticket machines and toliets. CityLink and GoBus buses use the coach station 100 m further north. The railway station is officially called "Ceannt" for Éamonn Ceannt, executed in 1916 for his part in the Easter Rising.

By car[edit]
From Dublin take the toll motorway M4 west then M6 to the city's edge, maybe 2 hours depending on traffic.
Parking is expensive. If your accommodation doesn't offer any, there's long-stay parking by the cathedral for a flat fee of €5/day.
By thumb: outbound, ask around at your accommodation, there might well be a lift going towards Dublin. Otherwise head for Galway shopping centre: all the major routes branch out from the roundabouts here.
By boat[edit]
For the Aran Islands, a connecting bus runs to Rossaveal the ferry port 38 km west. Ferries also sail from Doolin in County Clare, linked by an occasional bus from Galway. This means you don't have to go there and back the same way.
India, or is it America? As a young merchant Christopher Columbus travelled in Europe before his transatlantic journey, and in 1476 he landed in Bristol then Galway. He may have continued to Iceland; in 1477 he settled in Lisbon. He was intrigued later to hear that two bodies washed up at Galway appeared to be Indian. This reinforced his belief (as he lacked a reliable internet travel guide such as Wikivoyage) that he could reach the Indies by sailing west.

Salthill: Get in without a boat
53.274408-9.0492791 Eyre Square  is the place to begin exploring the city, as it's the transport hub and with a cluster of hotels and eating places. From 2004 to 2006 it was a dismal crater as an expensive redevelopment project flopped, but now it's an attractive green space, with a pedestrianised shopping mall just south. Artwork includes the "Galway Hooker" (fountain styled like a traditional fishing boat), the Browne doorway (from the house of one of the ruling families), and a bust of former US President John F Kennedy who visited in 1963. The square is officially named after JFK, but this never stuck, and it's always called Eyre Square after the mayor who presented this plot of land to the city in 1710.
The historic spine of the city leads from Eyre Square southwest to the river, called William Street then Shop Street then High Street then Quay Street. It's all pedestrianised, an agreeable stroll from park to pub to pub to eating place to pub. At the top of Shop Street, 53.273188-9.0521862 Lynch's Castle is a fine medieval town house, once home to the Lynch dynasty. But it's now a branch of Allied Irish Banks: you're welcome to look in during opening hours but there's not much to see.
53.2728-9.05273 Legend of the Claddagh Ring, 26 Shop Street, ☏ +353 91 123 456, info@claddaghlegend.com. M-Sa 09:00-18:00, Su 11:00-18:00. Called a museum but mostly a marketing exercise. The Claddagh Ring is a style of mani in fede finger ring: two hands join to clasp a heart. It's been a design for wedding or engagement rings since medieval times but became a Galway tradition from 1700, when the jewellers worked near an Cladach, the city shore. It became popular from the late 20th century, and legends were embellished around it as ingeniously as its designs. This museum hews to the "Joyce" legend, after the man captured by Algerian corsairs and learning the design in captivity; he returned to Galway where of course his sweetheart had remained true . . . Aah, bless. The heart is often surmounted by a crown, or isn't, depending on your allegiances in that matter. Free (no, not the rings though).  (updated May 2020)
53.272708-9.0537854 Saint Nicholas Collegiate Church, Lombard Street H91 PY20, ☏ +353 87 237 5789. Daily Mar-Dec 09:00-19:00, Jan Feb 09:00-17:00. A collegiate church doesn't have a resident priest, but members of a seminary (here, a College of Vicars) take turns. St Nicholas is the largest medieval church still in everyday use in Ireland. It was founded in 1320 and enlarged over the following two centuries. It's dedicated to St Nicholas of Myra (circa 300 AD), patron saint of seafarers, and the story of Columbus worshipping here is credible. There are large tombs of the Lynch family, and a plaque at the Lynch memorial window claims to be the spot where 15th C mayor James hanged his own son Walter: for killing a Spanish visitor, so goes the tale, but what was that really all about? In 2002 St Nick's conducted the first blessing of a same-sex partnership in an Irish church, but the Bishop prohibited any such unbiblical goings-on in future. However, although the church is Protestant (which it obviously wasn't in Columbus' day), in 2005 it was used by an RC congregation while their own St Augustine church was refurbished, and it's also used for worship by the Romanian, Russian Orthodox and the Mar Thoma Syrian congregations. When in Rome, as they say.... Donation.  (updated May 2020)
Galway Cathedral
53.270885-9.0521865 Hall of the Red Earl (Halla an Iarla Rua), Druid Lane. 24 hours. The Hall is the earliest medieval structure to be seen within the walls of the city. It was built by the de Burgo family in the 13th century and was the main municipal building, acting as town hall, court house and tax collection office. But a fragment is all that remains, protected behind glass, and it won't take a minute to see. The modern building adjoining is the base of Galway Civic Trust, and their guided walks through the city (see "Do") start here. Free. (updated May 2020)
53.2699-9.053876 Spanish Arch : medieval Galway had city walls, which in 1584 were extended to protect the quays at the river outlet. This extension, known as "the head of the walls" (ceann an bhalla), is nowadays almost the only remnant of those walls. In the 18th century the quays were extended, and two arches were cut in the walls to improve street access to the quays. They were probably originally known as the "Eyre Arches", but Galway was Ireland's main port for trade with Spain and Portugal. In 1755 the Lisbon Tsunami wrecked the arches, but one was later re-opened, so they became known as the Spanish Arch and the Blind Arch. It's a pleasant area to sit or stroll.
53.26984-9.053517 Galway City Museum, Spanish Parade H91 CX5P (at Spanish Arch), ☏ +353 91 532 460. Tu-Sa 10:00-17:00, and Apr-Sep: Su 12:00-17:00. Three floors of galleries have seven long-term exhibitions on Galway's archaeology, history and links to the sea. Two halls have rotating exhibitions. Free.   (updated May 2020)
53.273-9.0558 Nora Barnacle's house is at 8 Bowling Green. Nora (1884-1951) grew up in Galway and came to live here with her mother who'd separated from the drunkard father. Her boyfriends had a habit of dying, so she left for Dublin where in 1904 she met James Joyce, and "knew him at once for just another Dublin jackeen chatting up a country girl". Soon she would have cause to bemoan his drinking, hanging about with artistic ne'er-do-wells, spendthrift ways, obscure nonsensical writing style, and his demands for English puddings. They lived mostly in Trieste and Paris then Zurich, where James died and Nora lived out her own final years. The house in Galway is a small museum of Joyce memorabilia (including letters, but not the hotties) but is closed in 2020.
53.275134-9.0575539 Galway Cathedral (Cathedral of Our Lady Assumed into Heaven and Saint Nicholas), Gaol Road H91 A780. Daily 08:30-18:30. Roman Catholic cathedral built 1958-1965 on the site of an old prison; it's an imposing limestone building in a mixture of retro-classical styles, which some detest. The dome, pillars and round arches are Renaissance, while a Romanesque portico dominates the main façade. Michael Browne (Bishop 1937-1976) published an account of the preparation, design, building work and layout. The organ was re-conditioned in 2007, and recitals show off the acoustics. Regular mass, with one Sunday mass in Gaelic. Donation.  (updated May 2020)
Spanish Arch
River Corrib flows for 6 km south from Lough Corrib to enter Galway Bay. In 1178 the friars of Clairegalway cut a new channel out of the lough, east of the original outflow, and this became the main course of the river. It passes the ruin of Menlo Castle to reach the northwest edge of the city at a salmon weir: watch them swim upriver in early summer. The last km of river is very fast, great for driving waterwheels but not navigable, so the 53.276-9.06110 Eglinton Canal was cut in the 19th century, with swing bridges, locks, and side-races for mills. The swing bridges have been replaced by fixed bridges so the canal is no longer navigable except by kayak.
53.278542-9.06052911 University Quad. Daily 08:00-21:00. This was the original quadrangle of the college that opened in 1849 and became one of the three colleges of Queens University of Ireland (the others being Belfast and Cork). Since 1997 it's been known as the National University of Ireland Galway. The Quad buildings are in mock Tudor Gothic style modelled on Oxford's Christ Church, so their aspirations are clear. They're nowadays the admin offices of a huge modern campus stretching from the river and canal to Newcastle Road, then continuing west of that as University Hospital. Free. (updated May 2020)
The medieval fort and walled city of Galway stood east of the river, controlled by the Anglo-Normans, with "No damned Irish here!" signs at its gates. The Irish were kept in their place in a village just west of the river outlet, An Cladach, the shore. Jewellers also worked there, hence the name of the ring. Nothing remains of that village so the present Claddagh neighbourhood is modern.
53.262603-9.07055612 The Promenade is the main shoreline attraction, stretching for 2 km into Salthill. Traditionally you turned around once you'd kicked the wall at the two-level diving platform at the junction of Threadneedle Rd. Lots of pubs and B&Bs along here. It's long been hoped to extend the promenade west to Silverstrand, and to reinforce the crumbling coast against sea erosion. By 2015 this plan had reached design stage, but with no prospect of the funding that would enable it to go to tender, and it's all gone very quiet since then. So you can pick your own way along the headland west of Salthill but there's no paved prom.
53.259838-9.07406213 Galway Atlantaquaria, Seapoint Promenade, Salthill H91 T2FD, ☏ +353 91 585 100, info@nationalaquarium.ie. M-F 10:00-17:00, Sa Su 10:00-18:00. Large aquarium that majors on local marine life, so you will see sharks, but they're Irish sharks and proud of it. Staff display the various beasties: care to cuddle a huge crab? Adult €13, child €8.50. (updated May 2020)
53.254-9.05514 Mutton Island is connected to the mainland at Claddagh by a one-km causeway. (Don't confuse it with Mutton Island off Quilty in County Clare.) It's popular for wedding photos taking in the lighthouse foreground and cityscape background, while artfully avoiding the sewage plant.
Dunguaire Castle in Kinvarra
Castles: the city's original castle was a Norman motte-and-bailey, but it was smashed, burnt, raided for masonry and disappeared in the 13th century. It was only rediscovered in 2018 beneath Quay Street: it's hoped to put parts on display as was done for the Hall of the Red Earl. Remnants of smaller castles dot the area although it's mostly a case of "hunt the stump". They include:
53.28-8.99815 Merlin or Doughiskey is a turret in wooded parkland 3 km east of city centre.
53.296-9.07416 Menlo is the ivy-shrouded stump you see from the river. By road it's a bit of a scramble over a padlocked gate and down an unsigned track.
53.298-9.02217 Castlegar means "short castle", which may refer to its structure or because it was used as a short-stay annexe by Menlo Castle. The name's even more accurate nowadays.
53.309-9.02818 Ballindooley is a turret along Headford Road N84 near Castlegar. Slow down for a look but it's hardly worth stopping.
53.313-8.97919 Killeen is a 15th century towerhouse that has been restored and is now a private residence.
53.323-8.98820 Cloonacauneen is a restored 15th-century towerhouse that's now a restaurant, often booked for weddings.
Ballybrit is a turret just south of the racecourse, so if you've brought your racing binoculars you can save trudging across the field.
Dunguaire: see Ballyvaughan for this plush place in Kinvarra south of the bay just before the boundary with County Clare.

53.276198-9.0540041 Town Hall Theatre, 1 Courthouse Square H91 VF21, ☏ +353 91 569 777 (Box Office). The THT features plays, music, dance, comedy and of course panto. They run three venues: the main auditorium is only 400 seats, so it's cosy and suits many performances but is a bit small for grand occasions. Studio Space also in the square is 52 seats. Black Box, 500 m north on Dykes Road, has 600 seats and is more suitable for a rock concert. (updated May 2020)

Corrib Princess is a 157-seat river boat that sails from Woodhead Quay, east bank of the river just above the weir, for 90 min cruises up the Corrib into the lough. Adult €17. (updated May 2020)
Kayaking is a choice of gentle paddles on the upper river and lough, sea kayaking, and white water on the lower Corrib right in the heart of the city. The white water flow depends on recent rainfall and the status of the locks above. There's a standing wave at O'Brien's Bridge to test your sense of humour, and the Eglinton Canal rejoins the river at the Jury Drop: it faces Jurys Inn Hotel, where onlookers can express their verdict on your skill.
53.2994-8.999243 Galway Races, Ballybrit Racecourse H91 V654 (6 km northeast of city), ☏ +353 91 753870, information@galwayraces.com.

Also calls itself a "gastropub" (which frankly it's not, you won't starve but few visitors rate the food) and a "music hall" which is on the mark, there's always live folk and other styles of music.

Splurge[edit]
Streets of Galway

Stay safe[edit]
Galway is a safe town by any standards, but give the swerve to damnfool drunks.

Connect[edit]
As of April 2021, Galway has 5G with all Irish carriers.

Go next[edit]
South across Galway Bay is County Clare, and the spare limestone terrain of The Burren, which meets the Atlantic at the Cliffs of Moher.
If you wish to hear Irish being spoken as a first language, visit towns like Carna, An Spidéal, Carraroe, Barna, all west of Galway City in the Connemara area. English is also spoken in these towns if you are not confident enough to speak Irish just yet, but as a visitor you can appreciate hearing the Irish language being spoken in one of the few areas where it is a thriving first spoken language and has priority over English.
The Aran Islands are reached by ferry from Connemara.
