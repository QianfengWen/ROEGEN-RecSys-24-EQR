The Place of the elephants in Chambéry old town
Chambéry is a beautiful town in the Rhône-Alpes region of France and the birthplace and historic capital of Savoie.


Understand[edit]
Throughout history, it has been both Italian and French.  It lies in a valley in the Alps surrounded by the Bauges and Chartreuse mountain ranges and provides almost 360-degree views of the French Alps.  To the north, it is bordered by Lac du Bourget, the largest natural lake in France.  Chambéry has long been a "crossroads to the Alps" dating all the way back to the 11th century.  For many years, it was ruled by the Duchy of Savoie before being annexed to the King of France.  Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote the Declaration of the Rights of Man (the French version of the Bill of Rights) while living in Chambéry.
Chambéry is a charming, peaceful place to visit with beautiful architecture, good food and wine, and friendly people.  There are many vineyards in the area that visitors can enjoy, and on Saturdays, the city public market is abuzz with the freshest cheeses, meats, and local produce from the Alps.  The area offers many recreational activities to choose from in all seasons, from skiing and snowshoeing, to sailing and rock climbing.  The famous Tour de France bicycle race comes through the area in the summer.  Chambéry also boasts the Savoie Technolac research park and the Universite de Savoie, and a mountain research center.
