Prætsø Fjord with the towns marina in the background
Small in size, but rich on history; Præstø on Southern Zealand is a picturesque ancient merchant borough dating back to the 14th century, at the bottom of a small fjord of the same name. It makes for a worthwhile excursion if you're in the area. In 2020, it was home to 3,900 people.


Get in[edit]
The last train has long since made its final trip to Præstø, so you'll either need your own wheels or jump on a bus, which is a fairly infrequent occurrence, so plan ahead.
Buses 78 and 79 runs from Næstved which has frequent train services to Copenhagen. Another, more cumbersome option from the capital is Bus 91 from Faxe which has train services on the Østbanen from Køge which is on the end of the E S-train line. Bus 63 connects with Vordingborg further south on the same railway line as Næstved, so use this if you are heading south towards the islands (Lolland-Faster). Line 256 is your choice for going onwards to Møn as it ends in Stege, the islands largest city.
If you have your own vehicle, simply follow the Sydmotorvejen motorway (E47/E55) to either exit 38 (Tappernøje) or exit 39 (Bårse) and turn east, it's well signposted - the former is the most picturesque as it will take you along the fjord.
