Clitheroe is an attractive market town in the Ribble Valley in East Lancashire. It has a Norman castle guarding the transport route along the valley, and is a good base for exploring the Forest of Bowland to the north. In 2021 Clitheroe had a population of 17,141. 


Understand[edit]
Witch way to Pendle?
The Pendle Witches are Clitheroe's dark claim to fame. Belief in witches, and legal and church persecutions, took hold in Britain in the 16th century. Witchcraft was made a capital crime, and people started seeing them everywhere. In 1612 eleven people living around Pendle Hill were tried for witchcraft: eight women and two men were found guilty and hanged, one woman was acquitted. Others such as the nearby "Samlesbury Witches" were tried about the same time, an unusual spate of cases. 
So many "confessions" have been wrung out under torture, but the striking factor here was how the accused seemed to believe in their own supernatural powers. Six of them came from the Demdike and the Chattox families, who were rival folk-healers quick to accuse the other. It had all started when Alizon Device asked a pedlar for metal pins, often used for divination, healing, and hocus-pocus. He refused, but as he walked away he collapsed to the ground. He was able to get back up and hobble on his way, yet within a day or so, Alizon was claiming (without being put under pressure) that the Devil had lamed the pedlar at her request. Soon the elderly Demdike and Chattox matriarchs were boasting in court about their alliances with Old Nick.
There were attempts in 1998 and in 2008 to obtain judicial pardons for the witches, but their convictions stand.

Clitheroe Castle
53.8702-2.3931 Clitheroe Castle, Castle St BB7 1BA, ☏ +44 1200 424568. Mar: daily noon-4PM; Apr-Oct: daily 11AM-11AM-6PM; Nov-Feb: F-Tu noon-4PM. Held by the Royalists in the Civil War, this castle was one of many that the Parliamentarians ordered to be "slighted" ie partly demolished, but it was already so bashed about that they hardly bothered doing so. What's left of it is a small Norman keep with curtain wall balancing on a 35-metre outcrop of limestone coral. It's surrounded by pleasant gardens and a park. Adult £4.90, conc £3.70, child free.   (updated Feb 2023)
53.8743-2.39022 St Mary Magdalene, Church St, Clitheroe BB7 2DD, ☏ +44 1200 422828. Daily 09:30-15:00. Anglican (Church of England) parish church: the tower and east window are 15th-century, the rest is 19th.  (updated Feb 2023)
53.8685-2.41773 Edisford Bridge on B6243 is a nine-arch bridge over the Ribble of late medieval construction. It's not wide enough for two vehicles to pass, and there's no sidewalk, so take photos from the riverbank and don't linger on the bridge.

53.8203-2.4096 Whalley Abbey, The Sands, Whalley BB7 9SS, ☏ +44 1254 828400. Garden open daily. A 14th-century Cistercian Abbey on the banks of the Calder; it was ruined at the Dissolution and the abbot hanged for his part in the "Pilgrimage of Grace" uprising. The abbey was demolished and its stone recycled into a house, so there are limited remains, which you can see from the garden. The monk's dormitory has become an RC church, English Martyrs, still in use. The rest is now owned by the Anglican Diocese of Blackburn and the house is a spiritual retreat, offering residential programmes. "SuperWhalleyAlbanAbbots, Solas-are-the-focus" was the zingy title of one such event.   (updated Feb 2023)

53.869-2.37 Pendle Hill is 557 metres / 1827 ft high, but looks bigger as it looms up in isolation from lower country. "Pen" means hill as does the "dle" element, so like Breedon Hill in Leicester, its full meaning is "hill hill hill." It's a detached part of Forest of Bowland AONB. Its claims to fame are i) the Pendle Witches - the Demdike and Chattox families lived hereabouts in the early 17th centuries; ii) the "Moses" moment for Quakers, where in 1652 George Fox had his vision to propagate his Quaker beliefs, and iii) Richard Towneley's barometer measurements on the hill in 1661 showed the relationship between gas pressure and volume, which we call Boyle's Law. The hill is gritstone overlying limestone, so it's sparse moor heath on top. The usual ascent is the steepest, from the lane above Barley village (east) then straight up the scarp. In Aug 2012 some 483 people dressed as witches climbed the hill to mark the 400th anniversary of the witch trials.
53.8469-2.47218 Stonyhurst College, Stonyhurst BB7 9PT. Occasional open days. Roman Catholic independent school, established by the Jesuits on the continent in 1593, and relocating to England once it was safe to do so in 1794. Those who were here include Gerald Manley Hopkins, Arthur Conan Doyle and JRR Tolkien, and the college and adjacent moors can be clearly traced in their works. The grand building, mostly 1880s, can be visited on open days.   (updated Feb 2023)
Cromwell's Bridge is a rickety crossing over the Hodder a mile east of Stonyhurst, near its confluence with the Ribble. It was built in the 1560s but was named for Cromwell after his troops crossed in 1648. They were marching from Skipton to Ribbleton near Preston, where they smashed the Royalists.

Jimmy Clitheroe
It wasn't just a stage name, the comic actor James Robinson Clitheroe (1921-73) was born in Clitheroe and grew up in nearby Nelson. An endocrine disorder meant that he never grew to adult proportions, and maintained a shrill pre-pubertal voice, so his comic role was as a mischievous 11-year-old schoolboy. "Don't some mothers 'ave 'em!" was the catchphrase of his sitcom, aired on BBC Radio for 16 years and spawning two TV series; he also performed in variety theatre and pantomime. He was devoted to his mother and lived with her in Blackpool. On the day of her funeral, he was found unconscious from an overdose of brandy and sleeping pills, and died later that day.
