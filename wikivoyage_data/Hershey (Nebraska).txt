Hershey is a town of 660 people (2019) in rural Lincoln County, Nebraska, midway between North Platte and Sutherland in the Platte River valley.


Understand[edit]
While the first Union Pacific Railroad tracks were laid in 1867, it wasn't until 1892 that the farmers and ranchers met to organize a town site company so they could have a post office and a railroad siding from which they could ship hay and potatoes.  The town was named in honor of one of the owners of the Paxton & Hershey Land and Cattle Company, J.H. Hershey, originally from Pennsylvania. It wasn't until 1909 that Hershey was incorporated as a village.

Get in[edit]
The primary means of getting to Hershey is Interstate 80, which runs east-west; Highway 30, named the Lincoln Highway Scenic Byway, runs east-west.  Lincoln is 3½ hours east on I-80; Cheyenne is 3½ hours west on I-80; Denver is 3½ hours west on I-80 and I-76.
North Platte Regional Airport (LBF IATA) with connecting flights from Denver International Airport.

Get around[edit]
A car makes life easier, but the village is small enough that you can walk anywhere you need to go.

See[edit]
 American Legion Hall. This historic hall has  been restored by an enterprising and energetic group of local activists.

 Spring Crane Migration. One of the greatest migratory spectacles in the world, millions of Sandhill cranes converge on the river bottoms and corn fields between Hershey and North Platte from mid-March through about April first. If there hasn't been a lot of rain or snow, the gravel roads north of town will get you up close and personal with these beautiful creatures. Pull to the side of the road and watch the show, just don't venture on to private property. (updated Nov 2018)
