Port Germein is just off the A1 around 260 km north of Adelaide, and an hour or so south of Port Augusta. The A1 leaves the coast at Port Wakefield and, with the exception of the salt lakes at Locheil, takes a direct route lacking in attractions. The Copper Coast Highway is an alternate route, hitting a few towns along the coast.

See[edit]
Wooden Pier - the pier at Port Germain is the longest wooden pier in South Australia, and the walk out to the end of it is around 1.6 km.  If the tide is out, you can actually walk most of that distance under the pier, out of the sun.

Do[edit]
Crabbing - is likely the largest tourist activity in Port Germain.  Large Blue Swimmer and Sand Crabs are easily seen and frequently caught off the pier.
The town hosts the annual festival of the crab, each New Years.
Swimming at Port Germein can be a challenge, starting with the walk out to the water, which can be easily over a kilometre at low tide, and very shallow water at high tide.  Blue swimmer crabs are easy to tread on, and really do nip your toes if you do.
Perhaps better to settle for a picnic by the sand.
