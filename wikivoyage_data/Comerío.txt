Comerío is a mountain town and municipality of Puerto Rico in the center-eastern region of the Cordillera Central. The Cordillera Central is the mountain range that crosses Puerto Rico from east to west.


Understand[edit]
Comerío and the Cordillera Central mountains
Comerío is one of the municipalities in "La Montaña", the mountain. It is a small town divided into 9 barrios, including the barrio referred to as "Pueblo" with the municipal buildings, a Roman Catholic church, and a main recreational plaza. Pueblo is the historical and administrative center of Comerío and its architecture is influenced by 19th century Spain, which settled the area. The plaza in the pueblo is surrounded by small shops and is where festivals are held.
A large river, Río La Plata, flows through the Pueblo giving Comerío its nickname “the Pearl of La Plata”. Its tributaries are the Hondo and Arroyata rivers. Smaller waterways, called "quebradas" in Spanish, such as Convento, Piña, Prieta, Cándida, Tigre, Naranjo, Ollas and Jagüita are located in Comerío, as well.

Get around[edit]
A word of caution: if driving you are sharing the road with trucks, and locals. The mountain roads have steep descents and ascents, hairpin turns, and steep cliff drops are not always protected by railing. The roads may look like one-lane highways but are made to handle two-lane traffic.
The four main roads in Comerío are PR-156, PR-167, PR-172 and PR-779.
