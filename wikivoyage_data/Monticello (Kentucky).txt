Monticello [formerly dead link]  is a small city in Kentucky's Southern Lakes region. It is the county seat of Wayne County and one of the cities located on Lake Cumberland.


Understand[edit]
Nearby Lake Cumberland is one of the largest man made lakes east of the Mississippi River in the United States.  As a lakeside community, Monticello's economy is mostly based on lake tourism.  Three houseboat manufacturers are based in the city and have given rise to the motto "Houseboat capital of the world."
