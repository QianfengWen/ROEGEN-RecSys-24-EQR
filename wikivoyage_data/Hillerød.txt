Frederiksborg castle
Nestled between majestic beech forests, at the northern end of the s-train line from Copenhagen, Hillerød is the main regional centre and transport hub of North Zealand. For visitors, this small city of some 30.000 inhabitants is above all known for its large impressive renaissance castle.


Get in[edit]
Ever since the first railway reached the city in 1864, Hillerød has been the main transportation hub of the region. Since then a number of small railways has been build to connect the city with nearly all the towns of North Zealand, and the railway station is filled to the brim with commuters during rush hour peaks.

By train[edit]
Copenhagen Hillerød station is the north end of the S-train system Line A that runs between Køge/Solrød Strand/Greve and Hillerød through central Copenhagen. Leaves every 10 minutes during weekdays, and every 20 minutes in the evening and on weekends. Journey time is about 40-45 minutes between Hillerød and Copenhagen central station.[1] [dead link]
Northern Zealand: Less frequent local railroads leaves Hillerød for; Fredensborg, Helsingør, Hundested, Tisvildeleje and Gilleleje, the two latter are both close to some excellent beaches.[2]
