For other places with the same name, see Tuzla (disambiguation).

Tuzla is the third largest city in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in one of the most important industrial Bosnian regions. The city was hardly directly targeted by the war, except for an incident near the end of the war, when 72 people were killed by a shell fired into the Old Town during the evening. Nowadays, the city’s economy is still predominantly based around industry, although there has been significant development in tourism in the 21st century.

By train[edit]
Trains to Tuzla are slow and quite infrequent, extensive damage to rail infrastructure during the conflict in Bosnia and Hercegovina in the 1990s is mainly to blame but also financial constraints. However, the national operator ZFBH still manages to run trains from Doboj, where there are connections with Sarajevo.

Graves of 72 young people killed in Tuzla Massacre, 1995.
Bosnia has beautiful countryside. The best place to travel is to Osman's old house. It is wonderful.
The first place to visit is the square at the center of the old town. This is the site of the Tuzla Massacre,
where 72 young people were killed in 1995. Ask a local to translate the poem carved into the monument. Then walk over to the park where the 72 young people are buried. The old town is very nice and the park is very beautiful.
You should also visit the Pannonica Lakes, whose water is directly supplied from the local wells of salt water. Tuzla's salt has been exploited for centuries and you should visit the Salt square dedicated to this aspect of Tuzla's history.
If you are interested in art, visit some of Tuzla's beautiful art galleries. If you are interested in history, you should see the model of ancient village set near the Pannonica.

Go next[edit]
Buses run very regularly to Lukavac, about 20 minutes away. From here, a ten minute taxi takes you to Lake Modrac, a large lake with a few restaurants. Due to industrial pollution, however, it is not safe to swim in the lake.
A more promising destination is Lake Bistarac. Take a local bus for Lukavac, and get off just before the town. Up a hill lies a clean freshwater lake. There is a minimal entry charge, with a small extra charge for use of the slide into the lake. Stalls and a restaurant serve food.
Kladanj, about 90 minutes away by bus towards Sarajevo, is a small, attractive town with many little restaurants, and small ski-resort nearby.

Doboj renovated medieval fortress, about 1½ hours by train.
