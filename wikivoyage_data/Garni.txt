Garni Temple
Garni is a village in the Kotayk Province of Central Armenia. Most visitors come on day trips from Yerevan to see Garni Temple and Geghard Monastery, but the area deserves a longer stay.


Understand[edit]
Garni is rich in history.  The area was first occupied in the 3rd millennium BC along easily defensible terrain at one of the bends of the Azat River.  In the 8th century BC the area was conquered by the Urartian King Argishti I.  The fortification at Garni was erected probably sometime in the 3rd century BC as a summer residence for the Armenian Orontid and Artaxiad royal dynasties. Later around the 1st century BC the fortress of Garni became the last refuge of King Mithridates of Armenia, where he and his family were assassinated by his son-in-law and nephew Rhadamistus.  The fortress was sacked in 1386 by Timur Lenk. In 1679 an earthquake devastated the area destroying the temple.
Much of the population today descends from people settled in the population exchange of 1829–1830, following the Treaty of Turkmenchay between Russia and Persia.

Get in[edit]
By marshrutka[edit]
Marshrutkas number #266 are the standard way to reach Garni, but they're not the fastest or the most comfortable option. They run from Yerevan's Gai Bus Station (in reality a park and you will fin the bus in the middle of the park) every 30 mins or so, cost 500 dram. (See Yerevan#Get in for directions to Gai Bus Station.) The route is east to Garni, where the 40.117644.72991 main bus stop is in town centre, and onward to Goght and Geghard Temple.
You can also go the whole way to Goght, which is also 500 dram. Another 500 and they will even bring you up to the Geghard monastery if there are other tourists on board and depending on your bargaining skills. Otherwise it is just 3-4 km each between Garni, Goght and Geghard, which you might just walk or hitch are ride.
Generally, you are better off, first going to Geghard, and from there working you way back to Garni and all its sights. A taxi from Goght to Geghard, and then to Garni should not be more than 2000-2500 including waiting at Geghard. It is just 15 km.

By taxi[edit]
Taxis are the quickest way to reach Garni, Goght or Geghard (+/-17 km). The one-way fare from Yerevan will be about 2,000-3,000 dram.

Get around[edit]
Unless you are in a hurry, walking is the best way to see Garni.  If you need to know where to find something, almost any of the residents will be willing to point you in the right direction or even walk you there.
