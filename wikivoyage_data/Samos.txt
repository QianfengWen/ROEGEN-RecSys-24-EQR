Samos is an island in the North Aegean Sea and one of the East Aegean Islands. Its capital is the town of Samos, formerly known as Vathi. The Samians still call their capital Vathi instead of Samos. If you need oral directions ask for Vathi, but if you look on the map or at the road signs, you should look for Samos. In this guide the name Vathi is used for the capital of the island.
The island lies very close to the Turkish mainland (the Mycale Strait, the channel that separates the island from the Dilek Peninsula of Asia Minor, is less than 2 km across) and is a popular stopping off point for travellers between the two countries as it lies on the route between Athens and Izmir. Tourist season in Samos, when you can expect much higher prices, begins the first week of May.

History[edit]




Samos was the birthplace of many eminent personalities, philosophers, scientists and great artists. Among them are:
Aesop, Agatharchus, Aristarchus,  Colaeus, Conon, Creophylus, Damo, Epicurus, Hermodamas, Melissa, Melissus, Myia, Phyto, Pythagoras, Semonides, Rhoecus, and Theodorus


Samos has been inhabited  since the 4th millennium BC; its history is both long and interesting. The earliest inhabitants were Pelasgian tribes, before the invasion of what became the classical Greeks.
The first mythological king of Samos was Ancaeus, a hero of the Argonautic Expedition who, following an oracle of Delphi, colonized the island with Arcadians and other Achaeans. Ancaeus build the first wooden temple and placed in it the golden status of goddess Hera. According to mythology, Hera was born on the banks of the river Imvras and was the protector of Samos.
Around the 11th century BC another Greek tribe, the Ionians, came to dominate the island.





Pythagoras
At the time of Polycrates, Pythagoras was born in Samos, descending from the lineage of Ancaeus. Having studied first in Samos, he continued his studies at Miletus, Phoenicia, Egypt and Babylon. Then he returned to Samos and established a school. Chased by Polycrates he left and following initiations in Orphic mysteries at Delphi, Delos and Idaean Dactyls of Crete he arrived in Croton of Magna Grecia where he taught for many years.


During the reign of Polycrates (546 - 522 BC) Samos reached its pinnacle. Polycrates built a fleet of one hundred penteconters (known as Samainas), strengthened the army, expanded city’s fortifications and founded colonies, establishing naval supremacy in the Aegean Sea. Samos’s strength and the imposing temple of Hera attracted relationships and gifts from all the kingdoms of the known world.
After Polycrates' death, Samos was taken by the Persians. In 499 BC Samos joined the general revolt of the Ionian city-states against Persia, which failed with heavy consequences for the Greeks of the East. Then came the Persian Wars, with the battles of Marathon, Thermopylae, Salamis and Plataea, during which Samos was already enslaved to the Persians. On the same day of the battle of Plataea, was also carried out the naval landing of Mycale (479 BC) in which, Samians were both the instigators of the battle and the fathers of the victory, averting the Persian threat forever.

Phyto, the Samian Sibyl had prophesied about Pythagoras and Jesus Christ.
Then the Delian League was founded where Samos participated in able parity with Athens due to its naval supremacy. This supremacy annoyed Athens which, for an insignificant cause, organized an expedition led by Pericles against the Samians who, after a protracted siege, were forced to capitulate. The Athenians imposed forcibly a democratic regime and from then on, violent confrontations started between the oligarchs and democrats which lasted for generations, weakened Samos and led to a gradual decline. Plans and efforts for dominance of Athenians, Spartans, Macedonians, Hellenistic kingdoms and Rome, included also Samos for its excellent port and its position.

Samos has hosted, during their tour and/or for leisure, several famous personalities of the past. Among them was the pair Antony and Cleopatra who chose Samos to enjoy their love, by having (literally) royal holidays with conducting festivals and fairs for several months which attracted the best artists of their time.
The new order came with the gradual dominance of Rome in the second century BC, the inclusion of Samians into the subjugated of Roman Empire, the moving of cultural treasures of Samos to Rome and the transfer of island's defense to the will of a central sway which in many crunches was absent.
From the 4th century AD, Samos was incorporated into Byzantium becoming the seat of the namesake theme, named also "theme of the sailors" as it served chiefly to provide ships and troops for the Byzantine navy.
Following the disruption of the empire by the 4th Crusade in 1204 (Frankokratia), the island was attributed to the dominance of Genoa and the economic exploitation of Maona which was the first historical colonial trading company. Under the ruling of Genoa, the island was hard hit by several attacks and sacks by invaders and pirates, mainly Saracens.  Genoese, unable to cope with piracy decided in 1475 to quit the island and retire in Chios. The coastline of the island devastated and the inhabitants either migrated to adjacent islands or pulled off in mountain areas by establishing settlements that were (and still are) not visible from the sea. As a result, travelers, navigators and pirates believed that the island was completely abandoned.
In 1562, the corsair nicknamed Occhiali, a Calabrian renegade to the service of Turkish navy, prompted by his helmsman Nikolaos Sarakinis, asked from the Sultan to take Samos as fief for the services he had offered, with the proviso that only Christians would be allowed to re-inhabit the island. Special privileges were also to be conceded and especially a kind of self-government under the rule of the Sultan. The Sultan accepted, considering perhaps that the island was uninhabited and therefore useless in terms of taxes. Some years later, when the Sultan demanded to take the colonization records to Constantinople, the ship that carried them sank into the sea.  Many descendants of migrated Samians returned to the island. The privileges attracted also settlers from other parts of Greece and especially unsubdued remains of Byzantine soldiers who were constantly displaced, with their families, towards any territories were still free.
In 1821 the island participated in the Greek revolution but when the independence of Greek state was recognized in 1830, according to the treaty establishing the Greek State, Samos was not included within the limits of Greece. Instead, it was declared as an autonomous Principality tributary to the Sultan.
Finally in 1912 following a last revolution, the union of Samos with Greece was inflicted. Economy and social life of the island, begun flourishing again, and today, despite the destruction due to forest fires which happen almost every year, it remains green and inviting.

Get in[edit]
By boat[edit]
Vathi
The principal port of Samos is at Vathi, also called Samos. The other two ports are Karlovassi and Pythagorion. Ferries from Piraeus and the Cyclades usually stop at both Vathi and Karlovassi. There's a daily overnight ferry, the 'Nissos Mykonos' to Karlovassi and Vathy from Athens (Piraeus port), Syros, Mykonos and Ikaria.
At Samos town (Vathy) there are two places ships dock, which are 3km apart and takes about 30 minutes by foot. One is the "Samos Ferriboat dock" on the west of the harbour, which domestic ferries dock (Blue Star etc). On the east side of the harbour is the "Vathy Port" which contains customs controls and is where ferries to and from Turkey dock. 
Hydrofoils to the Dodecanese islands depart regularly from Vathi and Pythagorion.
There are foot-passenger ferries daily Apr-Oct from Kuşadası in Turkey operated by Meander Travel. These leave around 09:00 for a one-hour sailing to Vathi and return around 17:00, so a day-trip is possible from Kuşadası to Samos but not the reverse. In 2022 a day-trip is €36 adult and an open return is €47. Hellenic Seaways and Dodekanisos Seaways no longer longer sail this route. See Turkey#Get in for entry requirements at Kuşadası.

Mooring facilities[edit]
Port of Pythagorion

Most archaeological sites and museum are closed on Tuesdays.

Ancient engineering[edit]
Eupalinian aqueduct
As Herodotus described, three of the greatest engineering feats in the Greek world were achieved in Samos during the 6th century BC.:

37.6879226.943471 The mole. It was the first technical port built in the Mediterranean. The mole which protected the harbor was 360 meters long and based in 30 meters of sea depth. Today, the western end of Pythagorion quay conspicuously consists of this ancient project which constitutes also the root of the outer mole.   
37.6946226.930122 The Tunnel of Eupalinos (a 10- to 15-minute walk from the centre of Pythagorion town and is well signposted), ☏ +30 22730 61400. A tunnel of 1036 m was hewn through the hill and below the city’s defensive wall to serve as a safe aqueduct in case of siege while providing an escape route. What made it an extraordinary engineering feat and a project management paradigm is the fact that two different teams begun simultaneously from both sides of the hill and they succeeded, with a negligible deviation, to meet just under the top of the hill in 180 m of depth, despite they were obliged to deviate from straight line due to frailty rocks.   
Heraion
37.6714226.884943 Temple of Hera (Heraion of Samos) (6 km southwest of the ancient city), ☏ +30 22730 62811.   
Other archaeological sites[edit]
Samian Kouros (Vathi Museum)

37.6979426.94194 The cyclopean wall (At the road from Pythagorion to Vathi, take the road to Pountes on the left.). The ancient city’s defensive wall of polygonal masonry was 6220 m long. The Samians were forced to demolish it following their defeat by the Athenians in 440-439 BC, but soon after they built it again. Today remains its northern part at the top of the hill above Pythagorion, so it can be visited. 
37.7036526.918485 Ancient Mines. The workmen of ancient Samos were extracting soft limestone with primitive tools which was used in the temple of Hera and for construction of city buildings. The mines have forty-five entrances and eight levels. As of today many old inhabited houses in Pythagorion conspicuously incorporate structural elements which were molded in ancient times. 
37.727526.661116 Pythagoras' cave (In the way to Marathokambos, before reaching the village, there are road marks which lead to the cave through a rural road.). It was used by Pythagoras as part of initiation of students at an early stage, where they were standing a test. According to local legend, he sought refuge there when he was chased by the tyrant Polycrates prior to his final departure for the Doric city of Croton, in Sicily.

Architecture[edit]
The island's highland villages maintained satisfactorily their architectural character.  From the coastal villages, Pythagorion and Kokkari  maintain in full their architectural tradition as it is protected. Vathi , although a modern city, has some interesting buildings, concerning history and architecture, like the Samian Parliament. At the square near Vathi waterfront there is the "Lion" marble  monument, more than 2 meters high, which is an exact replica of the lion of Amphipolis and the other lions built by Philip II of Macedon. Some other villages worth visiting are the old town of Karlovassi, Marathokampos, Platanos and Ampelos, where you can find a path through the mountain with some nice views and great small waterfalls.

Festivities[edit]
Procession of young women with torches at the feast of Heraea
There are numerous festivities in the island’s villages held all over the year, especially in the summer. These are either religious fairs or fests related to local food or beverage products, like the Mitilini fried dough (tiganita) fest or Pythagorion fishermen fest. Their religious or local  character is accompanied by traditional food, music and dances that last until the early hours.
There are also three pan-Samian festivities which are organized in August as follows:

 Saviour's Transfiguration (5th & 6th of August in Pythagorion). August 5th, 1824 was the last day of the naval battle of Mycale strait won by the Greeks who were fighting for their freedom. Especially that day saw the Samiots away of the danger of total destruction (like it happened earlier at Chios, Psara and Kassos) as they had repelled all invasion attempts. The next day, August 6 1824, coinciding with the feast of Saviour's Transfiguration, dawned with thanks giving, rejoicing and fest. In the naval battle decisive role played the Greek fireships. So, every August 5th, in Pythagorion takes place a re-enactment of naval battle with explosions and fireworks at sea and the next day a religious fair is held with folk dancing. It is worth noting that at the same strait, in August 479 BC there was the last naval battle with the Persians who, following the destruction of their fleet, abandoned forever their efforts to enslave the Greeks. 
 Wine Festival (between 10 and 20 of August in Vathi). Organized by the Union of Vinicultural Cooperatives of Samos and the Municipality of Samos offering all varieties of the local wine - especially the famous sweet wine. Local musicians and dancing groups participate, where dances are danced usually by girls in a circle. Male dancers take up places at the beginning or the end of the chain. 
 Heraea (19 to 21 August in Pythagorion). Three-day artistic festivity which includes ancient musical, poetic and choreο-theatrical performances that frame the central event. The pinnacle of the celebration starts in the second evening with torch relay (women compete in running with torches), and continues with the arrival of the flame and the women procession with the woven veil of Hera by following the ritual from the 6th century BC.

The island’s pottery long tradition[edit]
 Fair Cup (dikaia koupa). The "cup of Pythagoras" has a line that determines the limit of fulfillment. The cup empties from its bottom when filled more than the limit. With this invention, called also "the fair cup", Pythagoras wanted to teach his students the necessity of applying measure and limits in their lives and why greed is vituperation which causes divine retribution. When the limit was outdone (hubris), lost was not only what was in excess of the limit but also what had been obtained up to then (retribution). 
 Water Whistle (nero-sfyrihtra). When the pot is full of water and air is blown to the tube, air bubbles pass through the water emitting a gargling whistle. When air is blown to the tube and the pot is empty the pot emits continuous hiss. 
 The laughable jug (mascara bardaki). The pleasantries that causes is that before the unwary drink from the spout, is getting wet all over from the holes. The challenge is to find the way to drink water without getting wet. 
Eat[edit]
Pythagorion by night
The Garden restaurant serves good value Greek and western food and is very close to the centre of Samos. It's on, Manolis Kalomiris Road, the second street back from the sea front and is well-signposted.  The restaurant is outdoors under vine leaves with a fountain and some songbirds and traditional Greek music to add atmosphere. Children will enjoy being photographed on the concrete donkey in the corner too. The Greek Salad for two is good value at €6 and a generous glass of wine is the cheapest drink on the menu at €1.50.
The seafront has a range of restaurants with typical Greek fare as well as pizzeria.
Drink[edit]
Although the town of Vathy is the capital of the island, there's no doubt that Karlovasi town is the place to be when it comes to drinking and partying. And that's because of the almost 2,000 students that study in the university there - especially during the winter. You can find a big variety of cafes, taverns, bars and clubs there.
Also, if you want to find a place to "dance the night away", in Greece people go to night clubs usually after 02:00.

There are numerous places to get a drink along the seafront and these get very busy in the evenings.
The main square of the town has open air cafes where you can get a coffee and enjoy the sun.
 BaRRock Alternative Bar. Propably the only alternative bar/club in Karlovasi. It's located in the square of Meseo Karlovasi and it's a great little place to drink a couple of beers and dance the night away. They host trap, techno, trance, hip hop and rock nights. Open only on Friday and Saturday until early morning. (updated Feb 2016)
 Barcode club. Another small, great club. You can hear mainly deep house music, open Friday, Saturday. Along side with Jasmine and Gazi, it's one of the most popular clubs in Karlovasi. (updated Feb 2016)
 Ginger cafe/bar. Very nice atmosphere, in a Paris-like cafe, in Karlovasi. Great variety of food, different types of coffee, tea and wine. Every Tuesday they host "Tapas nights" where you can have five types of tapas with a glass of red wine with only €4.50! (updated Feb 2016)
 Jasmine Club. Great club right in the heart of Karlovasi, just 2 minutes from the central square. Plays the mainstream international hits until about 3 and after that, Greek "turbofolk" music. The place is kinda small (can't handle more than 60-80 people) so it gets packed really fast and the party goes on until the first morning hours. Decent prices, a beer is about €3 and a drink is around €5. Free entrance. (updated Feb 2016)
 Azucar cafe/bar. In the square of Karlovasi. Small, relaxing place with good beer and nice deep house music. They host karaoke nights or small acoustic lives from time to time. Check their facebook page for any upcoming events. (updated Feb 2016)

 Tamam. Another tavern in the square of Karlovasi. Every Tuesday and Thursday they have a "drink as much wine as you can" deal with €4 per person. (updated Feb 2016)
 Algorithmos. A cafe run by students, on the building next to the dorms. You name the price on whatever you take. Works around the university timeline so if you visit in the middle of summer, there's a high chance that it's going to be closed. The place is nicely decorated, with a view of the town of Karlovasi and with different events happening every week. (updated May 2016)
