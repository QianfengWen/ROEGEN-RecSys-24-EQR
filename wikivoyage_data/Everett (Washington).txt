Other airlines may follow suit in time as the terminal expands. The terminal, ranked one of the best regional airports in the world, has a rather cozy design with fireplaces and nice chairs and sofas, and waiter service from the restaurants available throughout the terminal (all two gates of it). Everett Transit (Rt #8) provides service to a transit hub at Seaway Transit Center and the downtown Everett Station, where buses to the region can be found.   
The next nearest airport for more commercial flights with a wider array of airlines is at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA IATA, "Sea-Tac" for short) 45 mi (72 km) south of Everett, which serves much of the greater Seattle Metropolitan area and the Pacific NW.
The next nearest airport is at Bellingham International Airport (BLI IATA) 66 mi (106 km) north of Everett. Alaska Airlines and Allegiant are the only airlines offering flight to/from Bellingham. Options besides taxi/limo or rental car are:

 Sound Transit Link Light Rail & Rt 510 or 512.. There are a no direct Sound Transit buses from Sea-Tac to Everett.

The bus stop for the #510 is at 4th Ave & Jackson, opposite side of the (old) Union Station building from the entrance/exit of the International District (tunnel) Station.

On the observation deck of the museum, you can watch planes land and take off from the runway, with air traffic control audible on speakers; aircraft are often being tested before delivery to Boeing's customers. As of June 2023, tours of Boeing's assembly are suspended and no date of resumption has been announced. $15 for museum and tour ($8 for 15 years and under); $9 for museum only.

 Chiang Mai Thai Restaurant, 12926 Mukilteo Speedway, ☏ +1 425-423-8569. It's in a strip mall, but the interior is pleasant and inviting. Standard Thai menu, good service, and decent prices. Worth a regular visit if it's closer than Taste of Thai. $8-15.
