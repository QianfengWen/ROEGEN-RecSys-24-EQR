The village seen from the Ylläs fell.
Äkäslompolo is a village of 440 people (2011) in Finnish Lapland, in the municipality Kolari. It is a hub for travellers of the Pallas-Yllästunturi National Park both in the summer and winter and also part of the Ylläs ski resort.


Understand[edit]
As a ski resort in Lapland, the main season is during the schools' winter holidays in February and especially at Easter.  Note that the town of Äkäslompolo is not directly on the slopes, but a few kilometres away, so if you're looking for a ski-in-ski-out experience, stay at Ylläs instead.
If you come in late autumn, midwinter or late spring, be aware of the implications, such as darkness, low temperatures or, in spring, flooded trails. There are services all year, although some shut down off season.

Get in[edit]
There are buses going to Äkäslompolo from Rovaniemi, Kittilä, Kolari, Enontekiö and Kemi.
The nearest airport is in Kittilä, there are several flights from southern Finland like from Helsinki and Tampere. Coming from Sweden, Pajala airport may be worth considering.
The nearest railway station is in Kolari. Off season you might have to take the train to Rovaniemi instead.
By car, drive along E8 to Kolari and 10 km farther north. Then turn to Äkäslompolo by road 940. You can also come from the east, via Kittilä and Ylläsjärvi, driving the last 10 km by the slopes of the Ylläs fell.

Get around[edit]
The village is not very big: you can explore it by walking. In skiing season there are ski buses around the Ylläs mountain, single ticket is around €2. Matka.fi[dead link] includes information about some long distance bus routes which can be used for local travelling.

Do[edit]
Start of cross-country skiing track.
Most people come here for skiing. There are downhill slopes at the Ylläs fell and also a lot of cross-country skiing tracks, combining with the tracks of Pallas-Yllästunturi National Park. The downhill tracks are quite good for Finland, and very well maintained. The cross-country tracks offer wonderful journeys in the nice forest, and they are also well maintained. There are quite a few wilderness huts in the national park for those going for longer journeys, but they are often crowded in season.
The area is very good for hiking. There are many wilderness huts where you can spend a night on longer trips.
Travel agencies offer practice of Lappish activities like husky or reindeer sleigh trips, visits to reindeer farms and traditional Sami lávvus, as well as snowmobile safaris. The safari providers are near the supermarket on Sivulantie. Go and check out the different companies before booking your tours! Some providers might offer special trip and/or good discounts if booking more than just one activity!

Buy[edit]
In the lower part of the village there is a K-Citymarket where you can buy everything you need. Prices are a bit higher that in K-Citymarkets in south Finland.

The self-proclaimed "most famous grocery in Lapland" is well and truly a cut above your average corner store: it has a deli selling freshly made sushi, a cheese and wine bar, and smokes its own meat and fish. If you don't have a car, order online and they can deliver for €13.90.   (updated Mar 2022)
