Lidingö [ˈliːdɪŋˈø:] is a suburban island east of Stockholm in Sweden, at the innermost part of the Stockholm archipelago. With 45,000 inhabitants and a long coastline, it is known for the Millesgården sculpture museum, the annual cross-country race Lidingöloppet, and a cluster of conference hotels.


Understand[edit]
Lidingö, together with the Fjäderholmarna islets south of Lidingö, and a few residential islets, forms a municipality with about 45,000 inhabitants, with a land area of 30 km².
The island has plenty of archaeological sites from the Iron Age and the Viking Age.
Lidingö became a suburb for the well-to-do in the 1910s, with detached houses along the Lidingöbanan railway, and the AGA industries. Lidingö got city privileges, and the municipality still styles itself Lidingö stad. Lidingö contains high-rise buildings as well as single-family houses, several diplomatic missions, conference hotels, a few farms, and a nature reserve.

Sleep[edit]
Lidingö has a cluster of conference centres, most of them on the Elfvik peninsula. Many of them also cater to travellers, though all do not post rates online. Also, accommodation is often part of a package, including meals, which means yet higher rates. If you're looking for a budget hotel, Lidingö is not a good place.
