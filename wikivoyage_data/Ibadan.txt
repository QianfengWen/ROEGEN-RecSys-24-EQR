Ibadan is a city of 3.6 million people (2021) in Oyo State, South West Nigeria. Its historic significance in the affairs of the declining Oyo Empire has endowed it with a lot of places to see and its location at the edge of the Yoruba heartland makes it an ideal base to explore the major Yoruba cities which might not always have as many developed facilities for the foreigner as Ibadan does.


Understand[edit]
Mapo Hall (Ibadan City Hall)
Ibadan is the largest city in West Africa in terms of geographical mass; it used to be the capital of the entire South West Nigeria region excluding Lagos, and is now the capital of Oyo State.

Climate[edit]
The climate in Ibadan is tropical. The average annual temperature is 30 °C in the day and at night is 26°C in Ibadan. During rainy season, the annual precipitation is about 1467 mm (57.8 in).  The precipitation reaches its peak between July and August with an average of 218 mm (8.6 in). 
In dry season, the driest months are December and January with 8.26 mm of rain. If you are visiting when the weather is like this, drink plenty of water, and do not plan on staying outside for long during the sunny days. The interior of cars will get dangerously hot, especially if it's parked in the sun and the windows are up; don't leave pets or children in there, no matter how briefly.

Get in[edit]
Shared cars and buses are available to Ibadan from multiple bus terminals in Lagos for about ₦2,000 and above (naira). The journey takes about three to four hours along the heavily trafficked Lagos-Ibadan expressway, and buses arrive in the southern part of the city. Private taxis can be hired from Lagos for USD 30-50. There are various destinations which you can alight at in Ibadan city, the popular place is known as IWO-ROAD.
Regional buses connect to Ibadan from all major towns in Southwestern Nigeria, including Abeokuta, Ile-Ife,  Ogun, Ekiti and Oyo. Night buses also connect the city to the north, via Abuja, Kaduna, Sokoto, Katsina and eastern Nigerian town. 

By plane[edit]
Ibadan has an airport, which is served by domestic carriers only. There are flights from Abuja, Lagos and Ilorin. Arik Air and Overland Airways are the two airlines that operate in Ibadan Airport.

By train[edit]
The higher-speed Lagos-Ibadan Railway line connecting Ibadan to Lagos via Abeokuta opened in January 2021. In the future, the line will be extended to Kano. The new railway station is located in Moniya, far north of the city centre, meaning you will have to use a connecting bus or taxi. Nigerian Railway Corporation offers several daily return passenger service on the line. Tickets cost between ₦3000-6000.
Additionally, there are much slower long-distance trains on the old narrow gauge route from Kano via Kaduna, continuing to Lagos. These long-distance trains should run a few times per week, but are subject to frequent cancellations. Notice that these trains call at the old, centrally located, station.
