Daru is the capital of the Western Province of Papua New Guinea.


Understand[edit]
Daru is located on an island of the same name, which is located near the mouth of the Fly River on the western side of the Papuan Gulf, just north of Torres Strait and Far North Queensland in Australia. It is a poor town that has benefited little from mining activities in Western Province and has relatively little to interest visitors other than fishermen. It is an occasional anchorage for yachts sailing from Australia to Port Moresby.

Get in[edit]
Airlines PNG has daily flights from the nation's capital, Port Moresby.
From Australia. There is no commercial transport from Australia but it may be possible to persuade someone in the Torres Strait Islands to take you Daru by boat. You will, of course, need to have obtained a visa for PNG in advance. Torres Strait Islanders are allowed to travel into Papua New Guinea without documents as far as the 9 degrees South latitude line, just north of Daru, but that permission does not apply to anyone else.
