Stockport is a town in the south east of Greater Manchester, historically in Cheshire, at the point where the rivers Tame and Goyt combine to form the Mersey.


Understand[edit]
It's never been a port, as those rivers are not navigable, and the suffix probably means "market place". What the rivers did provide was power for waterwheels and hence textile mills, so the town became industrial from the 18th century. Whilst the Lancashire towns specialised in cotton, Stockport's trade was silk, especially for hat-making. This continued into the 20th century until the fashion for elaborate hats passed, and Luton captured the remaining trade.
In 2011, it was home to 137,000 people.

Get in[edit]
River Mersey, Wear Mill and Stockport Viaduct
By air[edit]
Stockport is 7 miles east of Manchester Airport (MAN IATA). From the airport station take Skyline Bus 199 heading for Buxton; it runs every 20-30 min and takes 15 min.
Trains take 35 min because they all go into Piccadilly then come out again, whether you take the hourly direct train heading for Cleethorpes, or take any other train and change in Piccadilly.

By train[edit]
Stockport train station entrance
53.405-2.1627781 Stockport train station. On the Manchester spur of the West Coast Main Line, so many trains from the south and Midlands stop here before continuing to Manchester Piccadilly, another ten min down the line. This means that services between Stockport and Piccadilly run 6AM-midnight every 5 min or so.   (updated Dec 2023)
There should be three trains per hour from London Euston taking just under two hours and continuing to Piccadilly. Crossing the Midlands these may also call at Milton Keynes, Crewe, Stoke-on-Trent, Macclesfield and Wilmslow.
Trains run at least hourly from Birmingham New Street and continue north via Wolverhampton to Stockport and Piccadilly.
Trains from Norwich and Cleethorpes run hourly via Sheffield to Stockport, continuing to Manchester Airport or via Warrington and Widnes to Liverpool.
Trains from Chester run hourly via Knutsford, Hale and Altrincham to Stockport and Piccadilly.
Trains from Cardiff run every 30 min via Hereford, Shrewsbury, Crewe and Wilmslow to Stockport and Piccadilly.
A direct train from Blackpool runs via Preston, Chorley, Bolton and Piccadilly to Stockport, continuing to Hazel Grove, but it's quicker to take a fast train and change in Manchester.
Just north of the station, the tracks cross the River Mersey Valley on an impressive 27-arch brick viaduct that was built in 1840. It often features in the paintings of L.S. Lowry.

By car[edit]
The M60 thunders over Stockport on its viaduct, exit at jcn 1 for west side and jcn 27 for east. (It's not that big a town - the orbital motorway restarts its numbering here.) Stockport is on A6, the historic route from London to Carlisle, but in this area it's congested especially during school run.

By bus[edit]
National Express Coach (long distance bus) NX 540 runs once a day from London Victoria to Stockport, taking 6 hours. Other connections changing at the airport are almost as fast.
Coach NX 333 runs once a day from Bournemouth via Bristol,  Birmingham and Stoke-on-Trent to Stockport and onward to Preston and Blackpool.
Both these buses make other stops across Greater Manchester including city centre and airport, but you can't use them for the short hop to Stockport, take a local bus as in Get around.
Stockport bus station is 200 yards north of the railway station. However Stockport Bus Station is being re-developed and will be closed till around 2024. There is a temporary Bus Station on Heaton lane for some services. More details can be found here.[dead link]
