Adults $3; 16 and under free.    Temporarily closed due to COVID 19.
35.3694-120.86762 Morro Rock. The great sight is the surf at the base of Morro Rock (called "The Rock" locally) which is the lava plug remnant of an ancient volcano. A bayside walk connects the Embarcadero waterfront to the ocean and harbor entry. The jetty that guards the bay mouth is a popular but dangerous surf vantage point, and one must take care with rogue waves which have killed visitors here. The Rock is a protected Native American shrine and home to endangered peregrine falcons.   
Do[edit]
Surfers in front of Morro Rock
The Embarcadero is the main tourist area and lines the east side of the bay. It is a great walking experience along a working port and eco-tourist destination. A variety of marine life is here, from sea otters to sea lions, and the town is a declared bird sanctuary. Excellent deep sea fishing originates at the north end of the Embarcadero. A public park and boat launch are at the south end. RVs and mobile homes may day-park at either end. There is a giant chess board in the middle of Embarcadero Rd.
Popular surfing locations are to the north on easy access beach from free public parking and across the harbor entry to the north end of the sand spit that forms the west edge of the bay.
You can rent a kayak and explore the south part of the bay, which is one of the larger estuaries on the west coast. A favorite local tradition is to kayak from Morro Bay State Park or Embarcadero docks to the massive sand spit for a picnic.
To the north of town is the Morro Strand State beach which offers additional surfing possibilities and many locals with their dogs in a fairly open uncrowded setting. To the south of the town is Morro Bay State Park which includes an impressive public golf course set in pines on challenging hillsides with amazing views to the ocean and bay. A renovated public campground is available.

35.3662-120.84441 Art in the Park (Morro Bay Park at the intersection of Harbor Dr and Morro Bay Blvd). Morro Bay Art in the Park is sponsored by the Morro Bay Art Association and is one of the oldest fine art and fine craft shows in the state of California; it's been running since 1955. Proceeds from the art show benefit high school art education in San Luis Obispo County. The show is held on Memorial Day weekend, Fourth of July weekend and Labor Day weekend. (updated Oct 2015)
