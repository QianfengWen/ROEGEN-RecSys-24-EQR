There are two cities in Germany with a similar name, Frankfurt and Frankfurt an der Oder
The Kentucky State Capitol
Frankfort is the capital of Kentucky. Downtown Frankfort is characterized by charismatic, old-fashioned, antebellum style buildings holding shops, cafes, restaurants and museums. A small city of about 25,000 residents, it is in the Bluegrass Region about 50 miles (80 km) from the state's largest city of Louisville and 25 miles (40 km) from Lexington.


Understand[edit]
The historic core of Frankfort is hidden in the deep valley of the Kentucky River, completely invisible to travellers on Interstate 64. Author William Least Heat-Moon once wrote about the city, "If you're ever looking for the most hidden statehouse in America, look no farther than Frankfort." The river, whose main course runs from southeast to northwest, makes a rough S-curve through the city, dividing it into four major parts:

Downtown — The historic business district, in the valley and north of the river (which flows east-west at this point).
South Frankfort — Home to the State Capitol, in the valley and south of the river; mostly residential apart from the Capitol. The governor's mansion and capitol are surrounded by floral gardens and lawns.
East Side and West Side (also "East Frankfort" and "West Frankfort") — The more modern areas on either side of the valley, with more shopping options.The "West side" of town has traditionally had the most concentration of modern stores, restaurants and hotels. However, companies have started to put more focus on the East side, with new shopping complexes, restaurants and attractions being completed monthly. The East side is also home to many traditional Mexican restaurants.
