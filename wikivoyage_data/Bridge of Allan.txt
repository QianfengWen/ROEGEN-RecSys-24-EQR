Bridge of Allan is a small Victorian Spa town in Stirlingshire in central Scotland, with a population of 5250 in 2021. Nestled beneath the iconic Wallace Monument, it's part of the city of Stirling. Demarcated by the meandering River Forth, Bridge of Allan grew up where the main road north crossed the small river Allan Water. There was a brief spell of copper mining in the 18th century, but in the 19th the village morphed into a spa resort, boosted by the railways and celebrity visitors, and the great monument to Wallace's victory was built. In the 20th century, the University of Stirling was developed on the town's doorstep, on the grounds of Airthrey Estate. 


Understand[edit]

In 1297 William Wallace held much of the north and Dundee was his next target, when the English under the Earl of Surrey marched north against him. At Stirling, Surrey dithered over crossing the River Forth, while the Scots got ready to meet him. He was urged to ford the river further upstream, which he could have done quickly outflanking the Scots. Instead he began to advance over the bridge, a ricketty narrow wooden structure that could only fit two horsemen abreast - the manouevre was bound to take hours. The Scots bided their time till 2000 had crossed then set on and slew them. Surrey could still have held his position at Stirling but bolted south to Berwick, and Scotland was in the hands of Wallace.
Wallace was never crowned king, but ruled as "Guardian of Scotland" until his betrayal, capture and execution in 1305 by the English. A war of succession broke out in Scotland: King Edward II tried to place a puppet king on their throne, and occupied Stirling Castle, but in 1314 the Scots under Robert the Bruce besieged the castle and defeated the English army a few miles south at Bannockburn. Scotland's independence was recognised in 1320 in the Declaration of Arbroath.
These two great victories are icons of Scottish lore and identity to this day - which gives the game away, that they were never so successful in battle again. There was a long period of peace until 1502 when, not leaving well enough alone, the two nations signed the Treaty of Perpetual Peace. Hostilities soon resumed and in 1513 Scotland suffered a catastrophic defeat at Flodden in Northumberland, with King James IV killed. They regrouped and came again, but suffered another crushing defeat near Carlisle in 1542. Never again could Scotland by itself pose a military threat to England. But if, say, France were to join as an ally, as in the Jacobite rebellions, surely they'd fare better?

The Ochils rise steeply above the village - they're not the Highlands, but a good overture.

A branch path leads onto Castle Law, with the best views of the monument and Stirling Castle.
