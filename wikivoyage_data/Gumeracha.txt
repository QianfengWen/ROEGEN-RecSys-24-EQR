The Big Rocking HorseGumeracha is a town in the Adelaide Hills region of South Australia most known for the Big Rocking Horse, one of the big things in Australia. Located about an hour northeast of the capital city Adelaide, it's a popular day trip for Adelaide families to check out a local icon.

Understand[edit]
Gumeracha is a small town (roughly 800 people in the 2016 census) that, like a lot of Australia's small towns, built an identity for itself through its local Big Thing. The town is a necessary stop for anyone interested in that Australian form of kitsch.
