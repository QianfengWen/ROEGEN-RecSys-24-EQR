Calm and scenic, Golaghat (Assamese: গোলাঘাট Golāghāṭ goh-lah-ghaht), one of the oldest urban agglomerations of Assam, has a beautiful landscape with several streams. Within the city limits, there are two wildlife preserves, a UNESCO-listed park, ancient ruins and sacred Hindu and Christian sites from the 17th and 19th centuries.


Understand[edit]
The history of this area dates back to the 9th century, but the city's name is much more recent. Golaghat is a city of five streams — the Dhansiri River and four tributaries — so not surprisingly, the city's name means "shop at the ferry landing", memorialising the Marwari shops that were established in the mid-20th century on the Dhansiri.
Golaghat remains a place of business. Other industries include tea growing and tourism.
