Understand[edit]
61°34′40″N 26°0′55″EMap of Hartola

Hartola has a Swedish name too, Gustav Adolfs, though it's rarely used. This has historical reasons. In the late 18th century when Finland was part of Sweden, Hartola was administratively part of Sysmä parish but the town's population wanted to establish their own parish, so they wrote a petition to King Gustav III. The king approved, and named the town after his son, Gustav Adolf. Due to this, Hartola also markets itself as "Finland's only kingdom".
The least populous municipality of Päijänne Tavastia, Hartola has about 2600 inhabitants as of 2023. Nevertheless, it's next to one of the busiest north-south roads in Finland, Highway 4, so a lot of people pass through.

Get in[edit]
