The Shaker Heights Public library, formerly Moreland Elementary School
Shaker Heights is an upscale suburb of Cleveland in Northeast Ohio.  The town was one of America's first planned suburban communities and has served as the home of many of the region's corporate, legal and health care leaders. It used to be an enclave for the North Union Shaker Community.


Understand[edit]
Shaker Heights was established in 1822 as the North Union Settlement of the Shaker community, a religious group that established several communities throughout the eastern and midwestern United States.  This group was responsible for damming Doan Brook and creating the Shaker Lakes, but the group's strict practice of celibacy eventually led to their demise in the late 1800s.
In 1912 the village of Shaker Heights was incorporated by the Van Sweringen brothers who envisioned a garden community for commuters to Cleveland.  The brothers set aside land for churches and schools, laid out curving streets, planted trees, and established a streetcar system (today's RTA) that led directly from the city to downtown Cleveland.  The town's strict building codes led to a distinctive architectural identity, and today many of the mansions and other buildings found in the city are featured in architectural texts.
Over the years the town's residents have included a variety of famous business and entertainment personalities including actor Paul Newman, comedian Molly Shannon, and football player Nate Clements.
