Rio Branco has a tropical climate, so expect a lot of heat and high humidity throughout the year. Average temperatures are typically 22 °C (72 °F) and 33 °C (92 °F) during the hottest days of the year. The rainy season runs from October to April, and the rest of the year is the dry season. In the winter months, during the dry season, the phenomenon of friagem occurs, when cold fronts of polar origin can lower the temperature to up to 12 °C (53.6 °F). However, the cold does not last more than a week and it can return to heat and high humidity. Towards the end of the dry season, between August and September, humidity drops and temperatures become scorching, sometimes reaching 37 °C (99 °F), and some wildfires can occur. It is recommended to drink lots of water if you visit Rio Branco during these months.

Get in[edit]
9°58′54″S 67°48′37″WMap of Rio Branco
By plane[edit]
-9.868889-67.8980561 Rio Branco airport (RBR  IATA). Has a handful of flights per day, most in the early hours. Direct destinations include Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre's second city, Porto Velho, Manaus and Brasilia.   
A city bus line connects the airport to the city center. Service runs hourly from 6AM to 11PM. The bus passes in front of the airport building, but there's no stop there. To reach the bus stop, on leaving the building turn left and follow the road. However, given said bus stop is a bit remote, at night the bus drivers are kind enough to pick you up from the airport door.
The taxis operate on a rip-off fixed price of R$ 100 to anywhere in town. The drivers themselves might help to pool people so they share the ride cost. An Uber ride to town will cost around R$ 35, but there are few drivers in Rio Branco and the service is often unavailable.
The airport building is open 24 hr and it's not uncommon for people to overnight there waiting for the city bus service to resume.





Getting to Cuzco on the cheap
Leave Rio Branco on the 6AM service towards Assis Brasil. It calls at Brasileia at 11am and has a lunch stop at a roadside restaurant at midday (lunch dish/prato feito: R$ 15, greasy fried snacks: R$ 6). It calls at the Brazilian border post at 1:40pm, before continuing to Assis Brasil town. This leg takes 7½ hours and costs R$ 62,50.
At the border, do the necessary exit formalities (this border post is open only from 7AM to 7PM, reason why you have to take the 6AM service from Rio Branco) and wait for the Peruvian vans that come pickup passengers for onward travel. There's roughly one every 15-30 min. This service starts at the Brazilian border, stops at Iñapari where it waits for all passengers to finish Peruvian border procedures and go all the way to Puerto Maldonado. In Iñapari, there are many money exchange business right across the road from the border post, and you should get rid of all reals you still have as the rate gets worse the further from the border you go. This leg takes 4 hr and costs 25 Peruvian soles (and in Peru you pay for transport only when you get to your destination, so it's ok to board without soles, because you'll have chance to exchange money in Iñapari).
(At the Brazilian border, beware of taxi drivers offering to cross you to Iñapari, this service is usually not needed because the van comes pick up passengers there. But should you wish to go from the Brazilian border to Iñapari, the going rate for the taxi ride is R$ 5 per person)
At the van arrival point, which you should reach at around 6PM, motocars (Peruvian tuk-tuks) come meet the passengers. To the bus terminal, the going rate is between 3 and 5 soles depending on your bargaining skills.
At the terminal, shop around for bus tickets, but the cheapest to date is a simple service for 25 soles, plus the 3 soles of boarding fee (to be paid separate at the counter inside the terminal).
Warning! Get pills against soroche (altitude sickness) before boarding the bus. After Quince Mil, in only 2 hr/100 km of road you'll get from 500 m to 4.725 m of elevation, which is an extreme variation by all standards. Soroche symptoms include headache, stomach pain, vomiting, dizziness, and loss of consciousness.
In front of the bus terminal, some small inns sell dinner menus (soup + main + drink) for 6 soles. If you board a 7:30PM service to Cuzco, you should arrive 6PM the next morning (typical temperature at that time is 5 °C (41 °F)), totaling 24 hr of transit.
Total: 62.50 reais + 58 soles (August 2018).


By bus[edit]
The -10.014529-67.8041432 international bus terminal sits outside the city. It's a modern building, with the ticket offices right at the entrance, and some food options both in form of cafes as well as informal vendors. The building is entirely open air, and it can be cold there early in the morning.
To Porto Velho, capital of nearby state of Rondônia, company Verde offers services departing at 7AM, 10AM, 8PM and 11PM (103 reais, 9 hr).
To the border with Peru, there are daily services to Assis Brasil at 6AM and midday (62.50 reais, 8 hr). Companies PetroAcre (☏ +55 68 3945-2967) and TransAcreana share the right to exploit the service, each week one is running the buses - inquire at their windows and they will direct you.
To the border with Bolivia, there are a few daily services to Brasileia (48.50 reais, 4½ hr).
To Xapuri, of touristic interest due to its connections to the activist Chico Mendes, PetroAcre runs daily 7am and 2:45pm services (35,50 reais, 3,5h).
On the night from Friday to Saturday, the bus plying the São Paulo/Lima route calls at Rio Branco and it's possible to take a straight service to Cuzco (282 reais, 24 hr) or Lima. That's the longest commercial bus service in the world, and it is estimated to reach Rio Branco Saturday 3am. Call Ormeño Bus Company's representative for details: ☏ +55 68 992 342 837.
The other straight services to Peru have been discontinued.

By car[edit]
Lotações (shared taxis) are common in Acre state, and the most popular way of medium-distance travel among locals. As a rule of thumb, the price per person is twice the price of the bus service, and they leave when full (that is, 4 passengers). Service is reasonably structured, and they congregate on their designated -9.981739-67.8101863 shared taxi point.
As of June 2018, the prices were R$ 60 to Xapuri, R$ 70 to Brasileia and R$ 110 to Assis Brasil (with a change of car in Brasileia).

Get around[edit]
Rio Branco has a network of city buses run by the local government. The fare is R$ 4 (Aug 2018) and it's possible to transfer free of charge at the -9.972857-67.8049984 terminal urbano (city bus terminal).

Do not feed them, and know that they are very fast beats in spite of their lazy appareance - when attacking, they usually jump from the water to a prey standing on dry land, so don't stay too close to the shore. The strip of land bordering the lake has picnic tables and is a hangout area for university students. At night, capybaras can also be easily spotted. (updated Jun 2018)

Eat[edit]
Acre state is one of the biggest producers of açaí in Brazil. This purple juice extracted from the fruit of a palm tree gained international fame as a superfood, consumed in form of a frozen cream to which fruits or nuts are added. However, the local way to consume it is to mix the fresh unsweetened juice to a bit of manioc flour (for crunchiness) and then add sugar, condensed milk and/or powdered milk.
Another local delicacy is tacacá, a broth made with manioc water and jambu - a leaf that causes an effect between hotness and light numbness of the mouth. When asked how much goma you want, start with "little" because this goey paste is an acquired taste, but don't skip it as it dissolves into the broth, giving it a nice thickness. It is served in a bowl, and you are supposed to drink directly from it, Japanese-style.
On street markets, look for sweets made of tucumã, a local nut, or sweets or juice made of cupuaçu, a fuit that gives a nicely sour cream.
Not particularly unusual, but -9.97284-67.8105351 Praça do Relógio has a concentration of holes-in-the-wall selling freshly squeezed orange juice (R$ 3/4/5 for 300/400/500 ml) that makes a great break on hot days.
