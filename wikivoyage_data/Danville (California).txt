Danville lies in a valley, seen here from Las Trampas with Mount Diablo in the background.
Danville is a suburban town in Contra Costa County in the San Francisco Bay Area, nestled in the valley between Mount Diablo and the Las Trampas ridges. Formerly a farming community that was home to a Southern Pacific Railroad station and later the playwright Eugene O'Neill, it is now a wealthy suburb with lots of greenery and has been rated the safest city in California.

Interstate 680 is the only highway through the town of Danville. From Oakland, take Highway 24 east through the Caldecott tunnel, then follow 680 south from Walnut Creek. From the South Bay, take 680 north.

By BART/bus[edit]
County Connection buses serve Danville from the Walnut Creek and Dublin/Pleasanton BART stations and from San Ramon. If you're coming from Oakland or San Francisco, Walnut Creek BART is the most convenient connection point.

By bike or foot[edit]
37.8222-122.00311 Iron Horse Trail. Formerly the railroad for the Southern Pacific railroad, the Iron Horse Trail is a paved multi-use trail that runs through downtown Danville, down to Dublin and Pleasanton in the south and Concord and Walnut Creek in the north.   (updated Nov 2023)
It is also possible to hike to Danville from Moraga via Harvey Ranch Preserve, the Carr Ranch Loop Trail, Rocky Ridge, and Las Trampas Regional Wilderness; this requires an EBMUD permit and is a long, steep, challenging trek with rewarding views.

Get around[edit]
Danville is small enough that most of the downtown area can be accessed on foot. However, the town is spread out enough that moving from one area to another will typically require a car.
The main bus routes are the County Connection 21 (weekdays, every 30-60 minutes) and 321 (weekends, once an hour), which go through downtown Danville on their way between Walnut Creek and San Ramon.

37.801254-121.9175551 Blackhawk Automotive Museum, info@blackhawkmuseum.org. A showpiece museum in the Blackhawk Plaza area.   
37.824444-122.0297222 Eugene O'Neill Tao House, ☏ +1 925 838-0249. By reservation only:. After you make a reservation a bus will pick you up and shuttle you to the Tao House. Nestled in the hills of Danville and overlooking a vast expanse of 680 acres (280 hectares), Tao House was the home of American playwright Eugene O'Neill. O'Neill, who is the only American playwright to receive the Nobel Prize, is best known for his startling use of dramatic realism, which is mostly associated with the Russian and Scandinavian stage. Most of O'Neill's work focuses on people on the fringes of society or on his own unhappy life. Interesting for visitors to Tao House, O'Neill employed feng shui (decades before it was trendy) in the design of the house, where he lived from 1937 until 1944. His intention was to write a cycle of eleven plays based on one American family while at the house. Instead, his chronic depression and alcoholism worsened and he was unable to complete the cycle. Still, three of his best-known and more personal plays, The Iceman Cometh, Long Day's Journey into Night, and A Moon for the Misbegotten, were written at Tao House.

Do[edit]
Las Trampas Regional Wilderness, with Danville in the distance
37.82-122.051 Las Trampas Regional Wilderness. Several residential streets in west Danville provide direct access to Las Trampas Regional Wilderness, a 5,342-acre (2,162-hectare) regional park that spans Contra Costa and Alameda counties.   (updated Nov 2023)
A good hike starts from 37.837061-122.0318282 Ringtail Cat Staging Area, following the ridge in a rough semicircle via 37.82654-122.049293 Eagle Peak until you descend to the 37.820572-122.0194644 Del Amigo Trailhead. Mossy greenery gives way to grassy ridges dotted with oak trees and beautiful views of the surrounding mountain ranges. Bird calls mingle with the smell of bay laurel and, at least in the rainy season, the tinkling of brooks. Assuming you do the most direct route between those three points, the hike is 4.6 miles (7.4 km) and should take about three hours if you're a strong hiker. Both trailheads are within walking distance of bus stops served by the hourly 21/321 bus, and the Del Amigo trailhead is about a 20-minute walk from downtown Danville. Trail signs are inconsistent at best and some forks are hard to spot, so use a smartphone map app to help you navigate. Parts of the trail are steep and can be slippery after rain – wear boots.
