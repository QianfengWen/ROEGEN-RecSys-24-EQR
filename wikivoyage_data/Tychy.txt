Tychy is a city in the Silesian Voivodeship in the south of Poland. With a population of 125,781 in 2021, it's part of the Katowice metropolis. It's best known in the west as the source of Tyskie beer.


Understand[edit]
Cichy means "quiet" or "still." That name probably wasn't accurate even in medieval times, when a series of villages in the forests of Silesia resounded to the clamour of metal-working forges and dwelt in a fug of coal smoke. Other coal and steel towns expanded from the 18th century and grew into each other, but in Tychy the main industry was brewing. All over Europe in that era, workers preferred to live on beer than take their chances on the output of the village pump, which was sometimes a richer shade of brown. Tyskie Brewery made low-grade beer for them, part of their wages, and higher grade beer for commercial sale.
Much of Silesia was part of Germany until the end of World War I; thereafter in 1921 Tychy joined the newly independent Poland, while several neighbouring cities such as Chorzów remained German until the end of World War II. From the 1950s Tychy mushroomed as a "New Town". Its main industry today is automobile components for Stellantis, the giant conglomerate that owns Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Citroën, Dodge, Fiat, Jeep, Lancia, Maserati, Opel, Peugeot and Vauxhall.
