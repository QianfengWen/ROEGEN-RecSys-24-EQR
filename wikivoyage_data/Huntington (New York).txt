Huntington is centered around Huntington Village, the commercial core of the town along Main Street (25A) and New York Ave which has the urban feel of a small city. Moving south along New York Ave brings you to Huntington Station, where the main LIRR station in town is located. Huntington’s large area consists of everything from shopping malls, strip malls, and office space along the LIE, to the village, to the large estates and beaches along the coast. In general though, a trip to Huntington would mean a trip to the village or one of the nearby neighborhoods. 

Get in[edit]
Huntington is easily accessible by car or train. The Long Island Rail Road from Manhattan stops in Huntington Station about a mile south of the village. Route 25A runs directly into Main Street and Route 110 North goes into the village as well. Route 110 is accessible by the Long Island Expressway and Northern State Parkway. It's a great day trip for anyone on Long Island, Manhattan, or Connecticut.

Get around[edit]
Huntington Village is completely walkable. Parking can be tight on a nice summer night, but generally there are enough parking spots to leave your car and walk around. The town also runs buses, but for people of normal fitness, there is no real need to take one ever.
