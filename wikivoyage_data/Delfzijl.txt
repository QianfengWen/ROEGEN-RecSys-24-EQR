Once every 5 years, the DelfSail event draws great ships and almost a million visitors to town.
The massive doors of the Large Water Gate still provides protection when the water rises.
Delfzijl  is a pleasant harbour city on the northern coast of the Netherlands. It's in the north-eastern part of Groningen Province and is home to some 20,000 people. It's not a major tourist destination, except when once every 5 years the town in turned into the bustling decor for DelfSail, a major maritime event attracting almost a million visitors who come to admire ships from all around the world. In other years, a much smaller but still fun event is held, called the Havendagen or Harbour days.


Understand[edit]
The city has a large industrial area, a busy port, a tiny beach and a few attractions to entertain the (mostly accidental) visitors. The place is not recommended for a longer stay, but has plenty of shops, a few hotels and a well stocked public library with internet facilities.
Delfzijl gained national notoriety in 2005 and 2006 because of political turmoil caused by its bickering local politicians. One of the last mayors to leave town in a hurry (Ms. Marritje Appel), bitterly denounced the city as "Sicily of the North".
During the local elections of 2006 30% of all voters in the city of Delfzijl submitted an "abstain vote".

As a harbour town, Delfzijl is well reachable via water if you have your own boat. The main water ways are the large Eemskanaal and the smaller Damsterdiep, which is almost exclusively used for private boats. There's a yacht harbour called "Het Dok" in the so-called "Oude Eemskanaal".
In summer, there are daily ferry crossings (also for cars) to the German island of Borkum and the German town of Ditzum.

Get around[edit]
Map of Delfzijl
The city centre and the harbour area are small enough to explore on foot. If you have a bike, that can be convenient if you want to head to the surrounding hamlets or are up for a bike tour along the coast. If you want to rent one you'll have to inform at the tourist office however, as there are no regular bike rental companies in town.

See[edit]
Windmill Adam has an exhibition space on the bottom floor.
The town centre has a number of interesting structures. Just strolling around will lead you past most of them, as the centre is small and easy to navigate. There's the windmill Adam (with an exhibition centre on the ground floor), a monumental train station (1884) and the former town hall (located at the Oude Schans, built in 1899. The former munition building is the oldest building in town, originating in 1591. 

53.3316116.9232811 Saint Joseph Church (Sint-Jozefkerk), Buitensingel 18. Gothic Revival church built in 1924.  (updated Feb 2022)
 Waterpoort, At the end of the Havenstraat. This historic "water gate" was built in 1833 and was known back then as the "Large Water Gate". It was restored in the 1970s, and is still in use, protecting the city occasionally from high water levels. 
Near the Damsterdiep canal, a 10-minute walk from the centre, there is a small statue of Maigret. Georges Simenon created the character of the sleuth Maigret while staying in the town in 1929. He based his story "A Crime in Holland" in Delfzijl.
 Aquariom. The Aquariom contains a small museum and sea aquarium near the dyke (situated in a World War II bunker).
