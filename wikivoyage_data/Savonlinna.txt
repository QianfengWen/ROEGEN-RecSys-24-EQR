Savonlinna (Swedish: Nyslott) is a small city in South Savonia province, Eastern Finland, close to the Russian border. Savonlinna is one of the iconic tourism destinations of Finland with traditions of hospitality going back to the 19th century. The town has been attracting visitors with its spa, lake nature including two national parks. In summertime the town offers rich variety of lake cruises, many still operated with old lake steamers.


Understand[edit]
Savonlinna was founded as a city in 1639 when the Swedish King Gustav II Adolf granted it city rights. The city grew rapidly around Olavinlinna Castle, and it became an important trading hub on the Saimaa waterway.
By the late 1800s, Savonlinna was a thriving city known as a centre for culture and the arts. The city was a popular tourist destination, and many famous artists and writers, such as Jean Sibelius and Juhani Aho, visited and lived there.
During World War II, Savonlinna suffered significant damage when the Soviet Air Force bombed the city. Many buildings and infrastructure were destroyed during the bombings.
After the war, Savonlinna was rebuilt and has since thrived. The annual Savonlinna Opera Festival attracts about 65 000 visitors in July. Savonlinna is an important centre for leisure and culture in eastern Finland.  It has about 32,000 inhabitants (2023).
Kerimäki, Punkaharju and Savonranta belong to Savonlinna since around 2010. They are handled in their own articles. Sääminki, which was merged in the 1970s, is handled here.

61.863928.9011 Olavinlinna (Olofsborg), ☏ +358 15 531-164. Daily 10:00–18:00 in summer, 11:00–16:00 during the rest of the year.. Medieval Olavinlinna is the city's symbol and main attraction. Built in 1475 by Danish knight Erik Axelsson to protect the eastern border of the Swedish-Danish Kalmar Union, it was named after the patron saint of knights, St. Olaf. The Russians were soon on the offensive, but the castle withstood several sieges before capitulating in 1714. The Swedes recaptured it in 1721, but lost it again in 1743, and it stayed in Russian hands until Finnish independence. This explains why it has stayed in such good shape: for the Russians, it was far inland and militarily useless, and hence not a target for the enemy either. Today, Olavinlinna is the world's northernmost medieval stone castle and easily Finland's best-preserved and most attractive castle, and it's quite a sight perched on the shores of the lake. The interior, though, is surprisingly small and sparse (virtually all furniture and decorations were lost in fires around 1870), and free guided tours take one hour. There are small exhibits inside the castle. Guided tours in English run every hour in summer (enquire in advance at olavinlinna@nba.fi in other seasons), but you can also visit the museums and courtyards on your own (entrance to some areas only on a tours. €5/3.50 adult/child.
