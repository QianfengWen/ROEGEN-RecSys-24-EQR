By air[edit]
Mississauga (YYZ IATA) is home to Canada's largest airport. Located in Malton, Toronto Pearson International Airport primarily serves Canada's largest city, with two crowded terminals and flights from cities across Canada, many American cities and European, Asian, Latin American, African and Oceanian destinations.
The airport is a short taxi ride from anywhere in Mississauga and is served by local buses.
Alternatives to Mississauga's main airport are Hamilton (YHM IATA) and Buffalo (BUF IATA), which both offer a much smaller selection of flights but are occasionally less expensive.

By car[edit]
Mississauga is served by 4 major expressways:

The 401 links Mississauga with Windsor-Detroit in the west, following the Windsor-Quebec corridor through Kingston and Montréal in the east, continuing as Québec Autoroute 20 to Rivière-du-Loup. The 401 in Toronto is the busiest highway in Canada if not all of North America.
The 403 links to Hamilton and Brantford to the west, rejoining the 401 before London (Ontario). It becomes Highway 410 at the 401, leading to Brampton in the North.
The Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) links Mississauga with the Gardiner Expressway and downtown Toronto in the east, connects with the 403 in the west, and continues to St. Catharines, Niagara Falls, and Fort Erie/Buffalo.
The 407 is an east-west toll route running parallel with the 401; it is one of the most expensive toll roads in North America. As the tolls are billed to the registered owner of the vehicle, rental companies may refuse to authorize their vehicles to be taken on this privately-operated road.

Get around[edit]
The city is very spread out, and it is difficult to traverse without a car.

By public transit[edit]
 MiWay (Mississauga Transit). MiWay provides bus service within the City of Mississauga. MiWay accepts the Presto card for fare payment. Riders may also pay by tapping a credit or debit card on the Presto reader in which case the current adult cash fare price will be charged. Cash fare: $4.25 for persons ages 13-64 and $1.00 for persons ages 65+; Presto fares: $3.40 adult (20-64), $1.00 seniors (65+), $2.65 youth (13-19) ,  children (0-12) ride fare-free when travelling with an accompanying adult.  If they're travelling independently they require a valid child Presto card even though it does not charge a fare.. (updated Apr 2024)
MiWay Local (orange/white bus livery) operate like the old Mississauga Transit using most of the same routes. Waiting times are typically 15 to 45 minutes on weekdays. 
MiWay Express (blue/white livery) travel on expressways and major thoroughfares with a limited number of designated stops; the buses are equipped with reading lights and power outlets at each seat but most routes are weekday peak hours only. Routes 110 University Express, 103 Hurontario Express, 107 Malton Express and 109 Meadowvale Express operate 7 days/week. MiWay Express routes 100 Airport Express, 107 and 109 use the Mississauga Transitway, a 12-station busway in the form of bus rapid transit (BRT), running along Highway 403 from Winston Churchill Boulevard to Cawthra Road via the City Centre. 
MiWay bus 23 runs between Long Branch GO Station and Clarkson GO Station stopping at Port Credit GO Station; it is useful for visiting sights along Lake Shore Road. It also connects with the 501 Queen, 507 Long Branch and 508 Lake Shore streetcars at Long Branch; however, GO Transit trains may make a faster connection to bus 23.
MiWay buses display a route number followed by a one-letter suffix (N, S, E, W) to indicate the direction of the bus. This can be useful for riders at bus terminals where a bus route may pass through in both directions.
Brampton Transit serves Pearson airport's Terminal 1 (route 115) and the Mississauga City Centre Transit Terminal (Züm route 502) near Square One mall.
Oakville Transit services Clarkson GO station and the South Common Centre near the Oakville boundary.
Milton Transit services Lisgar GO station at Argentina Road and Tenth Line.
Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) has several bus routes terminating in Mississauga which can be divided into two groups: 

Routes 900 Airport Express, 52A Lawrence West and 952 Lawrence West Express run from subway stations to Pearson Airport serving Malton east of the airport. Route 32A Eglinton West runs east from Eglinton subway station to Renforth Station with connections to the Mississauga Transitway. The TTC fare applies to these routes.
Routes 52B/52D Lawrence West serve Malton beyond Pearson Airport. Do not take buses 52B/52D to go to the airport as both routes bypass the airport. Routes 52B/52D cross the municipal boundary, and use MiWay fares in Mississauga and TTC fares in Toronto. If you pay the fare with a Presto, credit or debit card, you will pay only one fare to cross the municipal boundary; if you pay cash you must pay both the MiWay and TTC fares. Presto tickets are not valid beyond the airport. If crossing the municipal boundary on routes 52B/52D, you pay or validate your fare twice, once when boarding the bus in one municipality. and a second time when getting off in the other.
A fare allows for 2 hours of travel on MiWay including changing MiWay buses, or transferring to connecting buses run by Brampton Transit (including Züm express buses), Oakville Transit, Milton Transit and Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). If paying by cash, ask for a "transfer" to use as a paper receipt, except for the TTC which does not accept a MiWay paper transfer. For Presto, credit and debit card users, transfer info is automatically tracked to your card when you tap on, including the TTC. The Presto ticket (as opposed to a Presto card) is not valid outside of Toronto.
If transferring from GO Transit to MiWay to complete a trip, the MiWay fare will be free when using a Presto, credit or debit card. Just tap your card on both transit systems to get the free MiWay fare. When using a Presto, credit or debit card to transfer from MiWay to GO Transit, the MiWay fare will be refunded to your card at the end of your trip.

Stay safe[edit]
Mississauga is a fairly safe city, however, use common sense and vigilance at night like any other large city, as muggings can sometimes happen.  The local police are friendly, trustworthy, and approachable, so any issues you have you can ask them for help.
On the weekend, clubs and bars in Mississauga can fill up with people fast.  If you see a confrontation in a bar or club, it is best not to get involved, as these can escalate quickly.
For life-threatening emergencies, dial 9-1-1 to be connected to Police, Fire, or Ambulance.  For non-emergency inquiries, you can dial the following:

 Mississauga Fire, ☏ +1 905-615-3777. (updated Apr 2023)
 Peel Paramedic Services, toll-free: +1-800-668-7821. (updated Apr 2023)
 Peel Regional Police, ☏ +1 905-453-3311. (updated Apr 2023)
On the whole, Mississauga is a safe city, and for the average tourist, you should have no problems.
