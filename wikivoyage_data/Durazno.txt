Monument to Christopher Columbus on Plaza Independencia
Durazno is a city in the Central Interior region of Uruguay. Founded in 1821, it is the capital of Durazno Department and has a population of about 35,000. The center of Durazno feels like the small city that it is, with shops, restaurants, and historic buildings—but you don't have to walk far to feel like you're out in the country, with chickens squabbling and horses walking over to say hello.


Understand[edit]
Durazno started as a river crossing, located where Uruguay Route 5 crosses the Yí River (pronounced like "she"). The city's name, which means "peach" in Spanish, is said to come from a peach tree that was once located at the crossing.
The first president of Uruguay Fructuoso Rivera intended to move the capital of the country from Montevideo to this city. His house at the center of town is now a museum.

Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
There are buses between Durazno and Montevideo with departures all day long. Expect to pay U$300–400 each way. The trip takes about two and a half hours each way.
There are also buses from other cities, such as Colonia and Rivera.
The bus terminal, -33.387746-56.5279871 Terminal Rodó, is at the corner of Oribe and Gallinal. It has a convenience store and a restaurant.
Intercity bus service is provided by Nossar, Núñez, Turismar, and Agencia Central[dead link]. Nossar in particular offers service from a variety of destinations, including international service three times a week from Buenos Aires.

By car[edit]
Durazno is on Route 5, which connects it with Montevideo to the south and Rivera to the north.
