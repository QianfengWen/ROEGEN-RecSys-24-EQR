Lisse is a town in the Bollenstreek of South Holland. Most visitors come here in spring, to admire the blooming flower fields and the flower gardens of the Keukenhof. With over 800,000 visitors during the two months it's open every year, Keukenhof is one of the main tourist attractions in the Netherlands.


Understand[edit]
Although you will probably be heading for the Keukenhof when visiting Lisse, the town has a few things to offer beside that famous park.
Lisse and the Keukenhof park are located in Zuid-Holland close to Hillegom and south of Haarlem, southwest of Amsterdam.
The Keukenhof is huge, spread over 32 hectares with not only tulips, but also hyacinths, daffodils and other spring flowers on display.

History[edit]
With first records mentioning the then village of Lisse in 1198, it has a fairly long history. Consecutive wars caused wide spread poverty in the Middle Ages, and peat harvesting and agricultural activities were the region's main source of income. This changed when the production of flower bulbs gained popularity in the region. The local sandy soils proved very suited for the growth of tulips and other bulbeous flowers, bringing economic growth and wealth to Lisse and the surrounding regions. In late medieval times, the area of Lisse belonged to the gardens and hunting grounds of Slot Teylingen, a castle in nearby Teylingen of which now only ruins remain. Among that castle's most prominent inhabitants was Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut, who lived there in the 15th century. Legend has it that herbs for her kitchen ('keuken', in Dutch) were gathered where the Keukenhof is now, hence the name of the park.
Keukenhof Castle (opposite the Keukenhof park) was built around 1642 by Adriaen Maertensz Block, who had served as a captain and commander for the VOC on the Maluku Islands. In 1840 the castle's park was re-designed by Zocher and son, who also designed the famous Vondelpark in Amsterdam. This design laid the foundations for the current park. The castle was extended in 1865 and has been thoroughly renovated.
The Keukenhof tulip gardens were created in 1949, as a flower exposition initiated by Lisse's mayor and some prominent local flower bulb growers. Since its opening in 1950, visitor numbers rapidly increased.

Keukenhof[edit]
Flower fields at the Keukenhof
The 52.27074.54721 Keukenhof is the main reason why foreigners come to Lisse, and well-worth it. It is an elaborate park and floral exhibition, and a promotion for the Dutch flower industry. This famous tulip garden is surrounded by some of the largest tulip fields in the Netherlands. The Keukenhof is a seasonal attraction and opened only in the first two months of spring when the flowers are in bloom. The best time is to visit may depend on weather conditions but is usually mid-April. For the nine weeks of opening, hundreds of growers, breeders and product groups, in various product shows, join forces in an effort to present a high quality flower exhibition to the visitors of the Keukenhof.
The park opens as early as 08:00. Be there around that time and enjoy the wonderful combination of a very quiet park with the flowers opening up. Keukenhof can be uncomfortably busy in afternoons. Closing time usually is 19:30.
There is no direct bus or train from Amsterdam. Instead, travel to Schiphol Airport by train or by bus and then take bus 858, €5 with an OV Kart. From Leiden, take bus 54 from Centraal Station, and from Haarlem, take bus 50 or 51 from the train station. Combination tickets for the bus ride and entrance are on sale at the bus ticket offices outside both stations. Additional services are put on during the height of the season, but crowds of tourists at the height of the season can cause near riots.
In 2020 Keukenhof will be open from March 21 up until May 10, including all Sundays and public holidays, from 08:00 till 19:30 daily (ticket office closes at 18:00). Entrance fees for 2020 are: adults €19 (€17.50 online) and children (4–11 years) €9. Parking €6 per vehicle. Tickets can be purchased at the door (but be prepared for a lengthy wait), or online on the Keukenhof website. If you buy your ticket online, you do not have to stand in line at the ticket office, but you can walk straight to the ticket inspector. If you come by car, it is wise to buy a parking ticket online as well.
The easiest way to visit Keukenhof is Connexxion's all-in Combi-ticket. This ticket includes a return bus ticket to Keukenhof and an entrance ticket to the park. By showing your Combi-ticket you can enter Keukenhof directly, so you don't have to worry about traffic jams, parking problems or ticket queues at the park.

Prices for the Combi-ticket in 2020 from Amsterdam are: adults €32.50, and children (4–11 years) €14.

More bulb fields can be found in the Bollenstreek, the region surrounding Lisse. But the Bollenstreek is not the only region in the Netherlands with these fields. If you're looking for more, try the area between Haarlem and Alkmaar in North Holland. While relatively unknown, the largest tulip fields can actually be found in the Noordoostpolder, and a signed bicycle route is set up every spring to give more prominence to the occasion.
