Gangtok, viewed from Ganesh Tok
Gangtok is a bustling, friendly hill station, and the capital of the Himalayan state of Sikkim.  The name Gangtok is derived from the Tibetan word for 'hillside,' and the city has a population of around 100,000 (2012) being a mixture of indigenous Sikkimese and people of Nepalese and Tibetan ancestry.


Understand[edit]
Gangtok is popular place with tourists heading on treks, although the facilities do not reflect the number of international visitors. However, efforts are being made by the government to improve the conditions. Gangtok is one of the cleanest cities in India and is well organised and beautifully maintained.
Gangtok resembles the Bhutanese capital, Thimphu. Mostly devoid of large shops, this place is a nice break away from typical city lives. The city is a fascinating place to spend a few nights, the winding side alleys hide some unexpected gems, and the main street (MG Marg) is pedestrianized and a pleasant place to take a stroll.
The city sleeps by 21:00 mostly, except for a few pubs which are open till 23:00.
The best season to visit Gangtok is Jan-March.

Map of Gangtok
By taxi[edit]
Tourists are of paramount importance to the economy and so rules have been enacted to prevent them from being cheated. Taxi fares are mostly fixed.
Taxis are the dominant form of transportation due to Gangtok's hilly and steep roads. There are standard charges within the main areas: at least ₹100 for private service and ₹20 for shared. Taxis are available from designated taxi stands.

By road[edit]
It may be available from the private taxi stand a few minutes downhill from MG Marg. However, most of these will be shared jeeps that are one-way so it would be prudent to inquire ahead of time.

Eat[edit]
There are many great and cheap places to eat in Gangtok. In fact Gangtok is the best place if you want to try the Sikkimese, Nepali and Bhutanese dishes. Along with that you will also get North Indian, South Indian and vegetarian places, but they are few in number. Most of the restaurants are located near Mg Marg. Moreover, today one can easily use Zomato to know the menu and food options in some of the restaurants, but keep in mind that not all restaurants are listed there.

The food is devoid of spices and salt. Chili paste, soy sauce and salt are provided as condiments. The building is somewhat skewed and may present safety hazards, but it appears to have survived generations of customers, and the upper floor offers an agreeable view.
