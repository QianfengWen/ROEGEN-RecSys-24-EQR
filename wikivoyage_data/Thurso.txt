Thurso is a town in  Caithness on the far north coast of Scotland, with a population of 7390 in 2020. The name probably refers to the deity Thor, and this area was Norse until the 13th century. The present town was laid out on a grid pattern in the 19th century when the railway arrived; its population boomed in the 1950s when Dounreay nuclear power plant was established 9 miles west. It's long been a fishing port, and its harbour at Scrabster is a route to the Orkney Islands: many visitors are just passing through to catch a ferry. The main reasons to stay here are for sea-sports especially surfing, and to explore the rugged scenic coastline.


Get in[edit]
Dounreay
By plane:  Wick John o'Groats Airport has flights from Edinburgh and Aberdeen.
By train: Four trains M-Sa run north from Inverness via Dingwall, Tain, Golspie (for Dunrobin Castle), Brora, Helmsdale and Georgemas Junction (for Halkirk) to Thurso, taking four hours. There's only one on Sunday. The train then returns south through Georgemas Junction and branches off to  Wick, another 30 min. The southbound trains from Wick likewise double back via Thurso. It is advisable to book tickets in advance as carriages are often full.  
58.590101-3.5277681 Thurso railway station  is 200 yards south of town centre. The ticket office is staffed M-Sa, no machines, and waiting room and toilets only in office hours. There is step-free access to both platforms. 
By bus: Stagecoach Highlands X99 runs M-Sa at 2:15PM, £23 (as of Sep 2022) from Inverness via Tain, Dornoch, Brora, Helmsdale and Wick to Thurso (4 hours) and Scrabster.
By boat: NorthLink Ferries car ferries sail between 58.612-3.5482 Scrabster, two miles from Thurso, and Stromness on Orkney. They sail 2-3 times per day, taking 90 min and passing close to the Old Man of Hoy. Stromness has buses to Kirkwall and elsewhere on the Orkney mainland.
See John o'Groats for the ferries to Burwick, and those between Gills Land and St Margaret's Hope.
By road: the A9 from Inverness crosses Kessock Bridge and Black Isle, running north via Tain, Dornoch, Brora, Helmsdale and Latheron to Thurso and Scrabster. It's 110 miles (180 km) of undivided highway, reckon three hours. The historic A9 used to continue along the coast from Latheron via Wick to John o'Groats, but that's nowadays A99.

See[edit]
Town centre[edit]
The river mouth and harbour in summer is a good place to watch for seals, otter, sea birds, boats and sunsets. In winter look for the Northern Lights (Aurora borealis) - summers here are never dark enough.
 Old St Peter's Church, Wilson Lane, Thurso KW14 8AZ. 24 hr. This ruined parish church dates back to 1125. It was abandoned in 1832. Free.   (updated Jul 2022)
St Peter's and St Andrew's is the replacement church on Princes St completed in 1832, in Gothic style.
Meadow Well is a cute little "house" on Manson's Lane just off Traill St the main road. It was completed in 1823 and housed the well which for centuries was the town's main water supply. It remained in occasional use after 1876 when Loch Calder became the main supply.
Bishop's Palace or Scrabster Castle on the coast west of the caravan site is maybe from the 14th century. It's well-ruined, with just a few earthworks and courses of masonry.
58.5993-3.50821 Thurso Castle is the ruin of a Gothic pseudo-castle built in 1872, over the site of 12th- and 17th-century predecessors. It was partly demolished in 1952, although the 3rd Viscount Thurso (b 1953) somehow inhabits what's left. Harold's Tower a mile east is their family mausoleum.
Further east and south[edit]
58.5944-3.37672 Castletown has a sandy beach. Castletown Heritage Centre is a small museum open W Sa Su 2-4PM.
See John o'Groats (and continue on A836 east) for Dunnet Head the mostly northerly point on the British mainland, Castle of Mey former home of the Queen Mother, and Gills Land for the ferry to St Margaret's Hope on Orkney. You can give tourist-trappy John o'Groats itself a miss.
58.5214-3.48343 Braal Castle is the ruin of a 14th century tower house. The same name is given to the adjacent 19th-century Baronial mansion / hotel, nowadays apartments.
58.4733-3.60844 Ben Dorray (or Dorrery, south, 244 m) and Beinn Freiceadain (north, 239 m) are twin hills by Loch Shurrery. Their slopes are dotted with megaliths and prehistoric cairns, the most prominent being Oscar's Grave, a chambered cairn on the north hill.  A track leads to a radio mast on the south hill.
Further west[edit]
The 3rd Viscount still lives here
58.615-3.545 Holburn Head Lighthouse (just east of Scrabster Harbour). 19th-century Stevenson lighthouse to an unusual design, incorporated within the keeper's cottage instead of on a separate tower. It was taken out of service in 2003. Note spelling, the lighthouse is "Holburn" but the headland is "Holborn".   (updated Jul 2022)
58.5924-3.58286 Things Va is a broch, a fortified dwelling. The name is Norse, Thing-vollr a local assembly place (like Dingwall or Iceland's Þingvellir), but brochs are typically many centuries older than the Vikings.
58.6167-3.64897 Brims Castle is a tumbledown 16th century tower house, unsafe to enter. (The cattle and the ghostly lady don't heed this, or each other.) An old cemetery lies on the Ness beyond.
58.6077-3.688 St Mary's Chapel at Crosskirk is 12th century. It's free to explore any time, reach it via the lane from Forss. Only a memorial cairn marks the large Iron Age broch adjacent - the cliff became eroded and unsafe, so after excavation the site was demolished in 1972.
58.5804-3.74419 Dounreay is the 42-m white sphere away to the west, the covering for a nuclear reactor. These were built in such a remote spot because this was an experimental facility, both for civilian fast reactor designs (to replace the inefficient Magnox) and for navy submarine nuclear engines. Dounreay did supply electricity to the National Grid, but was never intended to be a mainstream power station. All the reactors have closed down but decommissioning will take at least until 2033, so a large workforce remains. They don't offer tours, try Torness near Dunbar or Hunterston near West Kilbride. Dounreay Castle is the ruin of a 16th century turret within the site perimeter, so it's off-limits until decommissioning is complete.
58.5653-3.698710 Cnoc Freiceadain Long Cairns are a pair of Neolithic burial cairns which have never been excavated. They're free to explore any time. "Cnoc Freiceadain" means "lookout hill" and there are several, such as the one south next to Ben Dorray, but Satnav will try to drag you away west to the mountain of that name near Tongue.
Sandyside Bay is a sandy beach just north of Reay Golf Club near Dounreay.
58.5631-3.853611 Puffin Cove is a scenic gully on the coast 8 miles west of town. The approach footpath starts from the Sutherland-Caithness county boundary on A9.
