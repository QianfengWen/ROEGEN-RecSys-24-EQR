Claiborne County Courthouse
Port Gibson is located in the western region of Mississippi. It is the county seat of Claiborne County and named for its founder, Samuel Gibson. It is located approximately 61.5 miles west of Mississippi's capitol city, Jackson.
Port Gibson is known as the city "too beautiful to burn", as proclaimed by U.S. Major General Ulysses S. Grant during the Civil War, according to local legend.
Port Gibson is the third oldest city in Mississippi and was founded in 1802.


Understand[edit]
Port Gibson is a pretty but quiet and small city-- from its size, some people may think of it as more of a town.  It has a couple of grocery stores, service stations, a drug store, and a few restaurants to fill basic needs but nothing exotic nor fancy.  For more excitement or variety, the cities of Vicksburg and Natchez are both an easy drive on well maintained Highway 61. The historic architecture is well worth a look if driving through this area.  It is also a convenient base for exploring this section of Mississippi.

Get in[edit]
Car: You will find Port Gibson at the intersection of U.S. Highway 61 (N-S) and the Natchez Trace Parkway.
