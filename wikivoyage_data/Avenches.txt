Avenches is a town of about 3,000 people in the Three Lakes area of Switzerland. Avenches is noted for the Roman ruins that remain from the time when the area was a major Roman outpost.


Get in[edit]
Avenches is served by trains from Murten, Payerne and Berne operated by BLS. It is also connected by a bus operated by TPF to Fribourg. From nearby Faoug, boats connect to Murten, however it is much faster to take the train.

Get around[edit]
Avenches is small enough to walk around and see the sights easily. There is a local bus around Acenches and the surrounding towns operated by PostBus[dead link].
