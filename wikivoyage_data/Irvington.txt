Map of Irvington


By plane[edit]
Westchester County Airport[dead link], 240 Airport Road, White Plains, +1 914 995-4860 (airlines). The closest airport, about 30 minutes drive. Rental cars are available.
Stewart International Airport, 1180 First St, New Windsor, +1 845 564-2100. Another alternative to the congestion of the 3 major airports, but offers few direct flights.
Newark Liberty International Airport, Newark, New Jersey, John F. Kennedy International Airport, and LaGuardia Airport: The three major international airports in the New York City area offer service to just about anywhere. Westchester-based taxi and livery cars offer regular service to and from the three internationals from most areas of the county. New York City yellow cabs will take to you Westchester in a pinch, but the fares can be exorbitant. If staying in Westchester, ask if your hotel offers shuttle service.

Over the past decade or so, Irvington has attempted (fairly unsuccessfully) to sell itself as a tourist attraction. Irvington certainly has its charm and history, but for the most part it is comparable to any of its neighboring New York suburbs. That being said, like all locations, Irvington has history. Those who are intent on exploring the colonial history of this affluent village should be able to find enough attractions to keep them occupied for a few afternoons.

41.0309-73.87051 The Stiner-Ross House. Commonly called the Octagon house, located off of the Aqueduct, offers some mild thrills for architecture buffs. 
41.0322-73.86752 Odell's Tavern, 100 S Broadway. Built in the 1690s, is a less interesting building with greater significance. Among other things, it was where the newly created State of New York's Committee of Safety met to discuss General George Washington's defeat in the Battle of Long Island. 
Do[edit]
Town Hall Theater is in the same building as Irvington Village Hall.
41.029-73.871 Old Croton Aqueduct. Go hiking or biking on the aqueduct's trailway. The original water supply to New York City is now a walking trail that runs from Croton-on-Hudson in the north to Yonkers in the south. Over the 180 years since it was built, portions have disappeared from the downtown areas of several river towns, but runs mostly intact through Irvington. River Gallery at 39 Main St. sells maps of the trail. 
41.0396-73.8682 Town Hall Theater, 85 Main St, ☏ +1 914 591-6602. Theater was designed by A.J. Manning and patterned after Ford Theatre in Washington, D.C. where President Lincoln was assassinated. 
Scenic Hudson Park has views of the Manhattan skyline and the cliffs of the Palisades.
41.0364-73.87493 Scenic Hudson Park, Bridge St. Have a picnic, play whiffle ball, or just take a nap. Bridge St is located on the west side of the railroad tracks, accessible off Main St. The park offers access to the majestic Hudson River. Launch your kayak or canoe from the south end. 
Go for a leisurely afternoon walk and enjoy the foliage at Halsey Pond or the Irvington Reservoir, both located off of Hamilton St.
 Irvington High School's Peter K. Oley Track, 40 N Broadway. Go for a jog on one of Westchester's finest outdoor tracks.
