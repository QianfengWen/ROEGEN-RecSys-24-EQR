Malahide (Mullach Íde) is a seaside town 18 km northeast of Dublin, with a population in 2022 of 18,608. Historically it's part of County Dublin, which was divided so nowadays Malahide is governed by County Fingal. The main reason to visit is the castle and gardens. The town continues south along the coast into Portmarnock. 


Understand[edit]
Malahide Castle
Malahide is on the sheltered Broadmeadow estuary, so Vikings and other settlers could draw up in their boats. In the 12th century the Normans were the new power in the land, and from 1180 the Talbot family ruled this area from Malahide castle. The village remained a small port until Georgian times, then grew rapidly as a suburb and coast resort for Dublin, so town centre and the seafront acquired their attractive Georgian and Victorian buildings. Later development was further out (engulfing the industrial village of Yellow Walls) so many of the early houses survive.

Get in[edit]
By plane: Dublin Airport (DUB IATA) is 8 km west, and can be reached without going into the city. Dublin Bus 102 runs every 30 min from the airport to Swords and Malahide (40 min), then winds south to Portmarnock and Sutton.  
By train: DART and commuter trains run from Dublin Connolly every 15 min, taking 25 min. The commuter trains continue north to Donabate and Drogheda, and southbound they make multiple city stops then head down the coast to Dún Laoghaire, Dalkey and  Bray. Trains from Belfast to Dublin don't stop in Malahide, change at Drogheda. 
53.4507-6.15641 Malahide railway station is in town centre. There's a staffed ticket office and machines, no toilets.
By bus: Bus 42 runs from Dublin Talbot St and Connolly Station every 30 mins to Malahide (45 min) then Portmarnock. Bus 32 travels along the coast via Sutton and Portmarnock, 50 mins. They make multiple stops and there isn't a bus station.

It's easy to walk to the castle. There's a longer coastal walk to Portmarnock, you might prefer to return on bus 102 or 32, see above.
Irish Centre for Cycling has bike hire. They're on Dublin Rd 100 m west of the railway station, open Tu-Su.
Toots the Malahide road train runs every 30 min between the railway station, village shops, Grand Hotel, sandy beach and Malahide Castle and gardens. Hop-on hop-off adult fare is €6, child €4, pay on boarding. It's frankly a kiddy-treat but you could always ride it ironically.

The oldest parts of the castle are 12th century, though most of what you see is 18th / 19th century, richly furnished. It's set in a great parkland, the Malahide Demesne. Visit by guided tour only. Behind the castle are Talbot Botanic Gardens. Adult €16, conc €11, child €8.50. (updated May 2024)
 Casino Model Railway Museum, Casino Cottage K36 TW67 (off Dublin Rd just west of railway station). M 1-5PM, Tu-Su 10AM-5PM. This elaborate O-gauge collection was hand-built by Cyril Fry (1905-72), and depicts Ireland in the 1920s and 1930s. The models are exquisite but mostly too old and frail to run, so much of the collection is in cases. It's housed in the Casino, a 2-story thatched shooting lodge built circa 1750. Adult €7.50, child €5.  (updated May 2024)
St Sylvester's Well in its beehive housing is an ancient well outside St Sylvester's Roman Catholic church, on Old St a block east of the railway station. It's named for Sylvester I, who was Pope from 314 to 335 AD during the adoption of the Nicene creed. Little is known of him, but he was sufficiently important to attract legends and forgeries in later centuries, such as the notion that the Pope was supreme ruler and that all secular kings ruled or fell merely at his say-so.
53.4526-6.15332 The Green north end of New Street has views onto the estuary.
Portmarnock has the scrappy remains of 12th-century St Marnock's church. Those in its graveyard include members of the Jameson whiskey family, Larry O’Neill a former Lord Mayor of Dublin, and the Plunkett family.
