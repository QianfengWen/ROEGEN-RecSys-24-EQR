Wallingford Museum
Wallingford is a historic market town on the River Thames in Oxfordshire, England.


Understand[edit]
The Romans liked Wallingford but proved unreliable tenants. Now the Saxons, they really put the hours in, building the earliest recognizable settlements.
Agatha Christie wrote from Wallingford, led the local amateur dramatics society and is buried nearby in Cholsey. Resident somehow in both mind and body, she’d be happy with the town’s continuing notoriety as it is plagued by heinous murders... the penny drops: this is Midsomer Murders country and Wallingford is the fictional village of Causton.
Before you run for your life, remember: it’s only a television show. That said, a town so touched by history always has a grisly secret to reveal.
William the Conqueror crossed the Thames here and established the castle. After roaming lawless on the open South Oxfordshire roads the murderous Dick Turpin rested up here, the law chasing his blood-stained coat tails.
In 1646 Oliver Cromwell gave the order to sack Wallingford Castle, undoing 600 years of fortifications. Even so, with boats moored under drooping willows that arc into the Thames, Wallingford remains the best example of a Saxon town in England.
The prehistoric road, the Icknield Way, crosses the River Thames at Cholsey.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The town lies on the A4130 which runs to Didcot (6 miles) and the A34 to the W and to Henley-on-Thames (14 miles) and on to Maidenhead (23 miles) to the E. The A4074 connects the town to Reading (15 miles) to the SE and to Oxford (14 miles) to the NW.

By train[edit]
51.5695-1.15791 Cholsey Railway Station, Railway Approach, Cholsey OX10 9QD (3 miles SW of town). Cholsey station is a calling point for stopping services operated by First Great Western on the Great Western Main Line between Reading and Didcot. The station was also the junction for a branch line to Wallingford, which is now used on an intermittent basis by the heritage Cholsey and Wallingford Railway.   (updated May 2017)
By bus[edit]
The area is well served by buses from Reading and most local towns.

By boat[edit]
Visitors may arrive by riverboat in the summer, from Reading and Abingdon.

By bicycle[edit]
The town lies on National Cycle Route 5 running from Reading to Holyhead.
The town lies on the 170 mile circular Chilterns Cycleway at the SW end of the loop.
On foot[edit]
The Ridgeway long distance path (running 87 miles from near Avebury to Ivinghoe Beacon) passes only 1 mile SE of the town.
