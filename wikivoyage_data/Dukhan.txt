Dukhan is an industrial city in the western reaches of Qatar. Dukhan was founded when oil was first discovered in the region, and its purpose has not changed since. Oil infrastructure is scattered throughout the city, and nearly everyone who lives in the area works for Qatar Petroleum. The city is off-limits to non-citizens. Only the police station, mosque and a small shopping mall are outside the two security gates that prevent entry to all other areas of the town to people not living there. Photography and video are strictly prohibited in Dukhan and the surrounding region.

The town itself is open only to Qatar Petroleum employees and their guests; the only attraction for visitors is the beach and other nearby sights.

25.40490350.7559281 Dukhan Beaches. Just about the only thing worth seeing in the city, popular with swimmers and surfers alike. Although the Dukhan Water Sports Club is closed to non-QP guests, the beaches directly north and south of it are open to the general public. The beaches are sandy but swimmers should beware of sharp rocks under the water. 200m off of the southern beach is a rocky reef which is good for snorkeling. Many locals also visit the beach for a picnic with their families. 
25.42616450.7834532 Dukhan Masjid. The mosque of the city with a large minaret. 
25.48686450.8456213 Zekrit (Zekreet) (14 km north of Dukhan). This is an ancient village with historic ties to Bahrain, set in a rugged landscape. On the small hill by the village are prehistoric graves cut from the bedrock, and on surrounding hilltops the remains of burial mounds from the Dilmun culture can be seen. Toward the beach are the excavated foundations of an 18th-century fort, as well as the remains of 'madabes', small buildings used for making 'debis', a traditional date-based food. The shallow inlet here is popular with kite surfers. 
25.57666650.8487964 Film City, Ras Abruq Peninsula (rough dirt track 10 km north of Zekrit). A large building once used as the film set for a Qatar TV series. A small 'village' is located 1 km to the north. The entire peninsula has now been classified as a nature reserve, and you may see ostriches, gazelle, and foxes. Fossilized seaweed and shells can be found on some of the rocky outcrops. Free, but a tip for the resident caretaker is advised.
