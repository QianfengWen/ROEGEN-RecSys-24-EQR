Understand[edit]
Aurora is part of what was at one time the Connecticut Western Reserve. 
Some say Aurora was the name of the daughter of Major Amos Spafford, while others believe the village was named after Aurora, the Roman goddess of dawn.
The family of Ebenezer Sheldon was the first settler family to venture into the remote regions of the Western Reserve in 1799. Sheldon and his family came from Westfield, Connecticut. Soon other pioneer families followed. In 1807 a village government was established.
