Davis is a city in the Potomac Highlands region of West Virginia.  The area around Davis is noted for the Canaan Valley, Timberline and the region's caverns, Blackwater Falls State Park, the pretty mountain town of Thomas, and the Monongahela National Forest.  


Understand[edit]
Davis is the highest incorporated town in West Virginia at an elevation of 3,200 ft.  The Eastern Continental Divide zig-zags across this region along a series of shallow ridges, forming the border between Tucker and Grant Counties.
Davis is not a large town, but don't let the miniscule population of 624 fool you, it has some great restaurants and its location makes it a great base to see some of West Virginia's best sights.  If you need the services of a larger town, visit Elkins to the west or Moorefield to the east, each about an hour away.
