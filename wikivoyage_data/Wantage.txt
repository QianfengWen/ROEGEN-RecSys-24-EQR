Wantage is a small town in Oxfordshire, 16 miles southwest of Oxford. It's on the edge of the Berkshire Downs and nowadays administered as part of the Vale of White Horse district.


Understand[edit]
Statue of King Alfred in the Market Square
The Vale of White Horse district contains a number of small village and places of interest including the small market town of Faringdon. The town is particularly proud of one ex-resident, King Alfred the Great (849-899) who was born in the town (although it was the village of Wanating at that time). Alfred probably had little memory of the town as he was sent to Rome at the age of 4.

51.574602-1.5714161 Whitehorse Hill, Uffington. The site of an Iron Age hill fort and Uffington White Horse. The site sits on the ridgeway long distance footpath, which follows the line of a chalk ridge which separates the Berkshire Downs to the south and the Vale of the White Horse to the north. The horse was cut into the chalk downs and can be seen from miles around. It has been "cleaned" by local communities about every 20 years continuously since it was first made about 2000 to 3000 years ago. The hill fort consists of a large circular bank and ditch 1-1.6km in circumference, with grass all over and inside. There are great views from the site, which is fantastic for picnics on a sunny day. Also nearby is the Dragon's Hill which appears to be man made and could somehow be associated to the site. Access is easiest by car - it has two car parks (one of which is nearer the horse and recommended only for visitors requiring easier access) The lower car park includes some signage explaining the Whitehorse, and ridgeway. There are picnic tables near by. One could also easily take in the White Horse and Hill Fort, on a walk along the ridgeway.
