Understand[edit]
Arviat is the southernmost community in mainland Nunavut, on the western edge of Hudson Bay. It is less than an hour from Churchill, Manitoba. People who live in Arviat are called Arviammiut. They are a proud people who live in harmony with the land and wildlife around them and maintain a strong connection to their traditions and Inuit culture. Two national historic sites, Arvia'juaq (an island shaped like a large bowhead whale) and Qikiqtaarjuk (a small island), are easily accessible from the community are testament to the rich heritage and cultural resources. 
The town was known as Eskimo Point until 1989 when it was renamed Arviat, a name derived from an Inuktitut work, arviq, meaning "bowhead whale" as the nearby coastal landscape resembles the shape of a bowhead whale.
