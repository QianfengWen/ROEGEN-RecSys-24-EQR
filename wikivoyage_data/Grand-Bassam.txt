 
Filled to the brim with French colonial charm, Grand-Bassam is a town in the Lagunes region of Côte d'Ivoire. 


Understand[edit]
Grand-Bassam (or "Bassam" as the locals call it) was the capital city of the French colonies in the region from 1893 until 1896, until the administration was transferred to Bingerville after a severe bout of yellow fever. The city's inhabitants recovered, and it remained a key seaport until the growth of Abidjan from the 1930s, which crushed its golden era. By independence in 1960, Grand-Bassam was little more than a ghost town, until a surge of tourism in the 1970s led to its resettlement. 
Today, 5,000 people call the town their home, although some areas remain largely abandoned.

Get in[edit]

Grand-Bassam is 45 km east of Abidjan and the trip will take about 45 minutes by road.
Bush taxis from the Gare de Bassam in Abidjan are the best option, and will cost about CFA 500. Buses are an alternative, which leave from Gare Routière d'Adjamé in Abidjan for CFA 500.
Grand-Bassam's 5.20669-3.734991 gare routière (bus station) is in the centre of town, just beside the Place de Paix roundabout.

Get around[edit]
The town is largely divided into two distinct halves. On the south side of the Ébrié Lagoon is Ancien Bassam, the old French town where most of the colonial buildings and attractions are located. Nouveau Bassam lies to the north of the lagoon, and grew out of the old servant quarters to become the main business centre. The two are connected by a small bridge.
The main area of town is quite compact, so walking is an easy way of getting around. If you feel like venturing further, you will need to organise a bush taxi.

Do[edit]
