Morondava is a town on the coast of Western Madagascar.
Morondava is a coastal town in the West of Madagascar, connected to the capital by regular plane service run by Air Madagascar.  It is an ideal place for a relaxing stay, especially compared to the capital, since it is less crowded and (so far) devoid of beggars. It is also cheaper. The beaches are good and extend far to the north side of town. Morondava can also be used a base for trips to the fishing village of Belo sur Mer (by pirogue (small boat)) or to the wildlife park at Kirindy (via 4x4 since the roads are quite poor).
The dry season is the best time to visit as daytime temperatures are about 27°C and nighttime around 14-15°C while the water is still as warm as the Mediterranean in summer (about 24°C). The downside is that the town is very dry and dusty with blowing sand a problem - but it is still less dirty than other towns. In the summer rainy season it is hot and sticky, and there is quite a lot of mud around (although again less so than other towns.)

Get around[edit]
20°17′36″S 44°16′37″EMap of Morondava
The town is about a 30-minute walk from one end to the other.  Take it slow since it is pretty warm at all times of the year.  Taxis are available and needed to go to the airport, which is a few km from the main area. However, make sure that you have the right amount - as so often in Mad, the taxi drivers claim that they don't have change and try to get you to pay more.

Do[edit]
A 4x4 and driver can be hired to visit the Kirindy nature reserve.  On the way ask the driver to stop at the Avenue of Baobabs ("upside down trees") which has some interesting sights such as Les Baobabs Amoureuse (amorous baobabs) where two trees have grown intertwined with each other.  Ladies can cuddle the amorous baobabs and this is said to improve fertility!

Wildlife, such as several species of Madagascar's famed lemurs, can be seen, as well as lizards and a variety of other flora and fauna.
