Armadale (Gaelic: Armadal) is the ferry port and main village of Sleat peninsula, the gently rolling southern part of the Isle of Skye. To the south it merges with Ardvasar (Gaelic: Àird a’ Bhàsair), and a lane continues to dead-end at Aird of Sleat. The main road A851 follows the coast north, with a straggle of accommodation and amenities, notably at Saasaig and Isleornsay. Points north of there are described under Broadford.


Get in[edit]
57°6′0″N 5°54′0″WMap of Armadale (Skye)
57.065-5.8951 Armadale pier is the landing point for Calmac ferries from Mallaig on the Scottish mainland. They take 45 min and sail daily, Apr-Oct every hour or two 8AM-6PM but only 2 or 3 per day Nov-March. Until end of March 2025 return fares are £23.30 per car, £7 per adult including driver, and £3.50 per child aged 5-15. This was the usual route to Skye before the bridge opened, and it's still a good route if you want to take the Road to the Isles via Glenfinnan. But don't come this way on a whim or because Satnav has misdirected you to Mallaig instead of the bridge - you could face a long wait for a ferry space if you haven't booked.  
Stagecoach Bus 52 runs 3 or 4 times daily from Armadale pier (connecting with the ferries) to Broadford, Sligachan and Portree. In Broadford it connects M-F with Bus 50 to Kyleakin and Kyle of Lochalsh bus and railway stations.
By car you follow A851 the same road as the bus, joining A87 the main cross-island road at Broadford.

Get around[edit]
It's a short walk between the pier, the two villages and Armadale Castle, but you need wheels to get elsewhere around Sleat.
Car rental is available from Drive Skye.

See[edit]
57.0729-5.89891 Armadale Castle Gardens, Armadale, Sleat IV45 8RS, ☏ +44 1471 844305. Apr-Oct daily 9:30AM-5PM. This was a mansion built in 1790 and extended in 1815 as the seat of Clan Macdonald of Sleat. It suffered a fire in 1855, was part rebuilt but unaffordable, and abandoned in 1925. The ruin is unsafe and you can't go in, but it's surrounded by gardens and arboretum. The Museum of the Isles covers the area's extensive history. Adult £14, conc £12, child £8.   (updated Jun 2024)
Views from the village and pier towards the mainland are attractive.
57.136552-5.9758682 Dunscaith Castle  is ten miles north of Armadale, take the lane west to Tokavaig then hike. It's a fragmentary medieval ruin on an outcrop of rock on the wild west coast of the Sleat Peninsula. A drawbridge once connected the outcrop to the mainland; you can still scramble across or climb from the beach, but both ways are hazardous, only nettles await you, and the views are just as good from shore.
57.0185-6.01733 Point of Sleat is reached by driving south to the end of the public road at Aird of Sleat, then it's a clear (though occasionally rough or boggy) 3-mile trail to the Point, crossing the beach at Camas Daraich. The lighthouse is just a small metal gantry, you come for the views towards the Small Isles (which are inhabited, and reached by ferry from Mallaig).
