West Yellowstone, Montana, is a rustic mountain town nestled between National Forest lands and is the gateway to Yellowstone National Park.  It is only a mile from the park entrance, and the town's airport is the closest to the park, and to attractions like Old Faithful.


Understand[edit]
West Yellowstone is a tourist town with tourist prices. You will find many souvenir items in the stores and specialty Montana-made products. During summer be prepared to wait in any restaurant.
This is the only place to gather supplies for quite a while in any direction. Be sure you are stocked up for whatever season. Water! There will be little opportunity to fill your water bottles so take more than you think you will need.
