Visp is a German-speaking town in the Swiss canton of Valais. It is located in the Rhone valley and is a major industrial centre in the region. Its location at the intersection of three train lines and a big bus interchange make it a gateway to many of the towns and resorts in the upper part of the Valais.


Understand[edit]
Old town of Visp.
Visp used to be quite a backwater town, its main focus being the LONZA chemical plant, one of the biggest employers in the region. However, since the opening of the new Lötschberg base tunnel, it has become a major rail interchange. The railway station has been upgraded from an old-fashioned province station to a big modern railway station. The area around the station has been heavily developed, now offering a lot more facilities and shops than even 10 years ago. Despite its rather low population of around 7,500 inhabitants, it is a major urban centre in the region. So if you are travelling to one of the smaller mountain resorts, this will be your last chance at shopping at a big supermarket.
Virtually everyone travelling to one of the destinations in the region (including Saas-Fee and Zermatt), as well as people coming from Berne and Zurich travelling on to the lower Valais has to transit in Visp now. Most of the sights can be visited in a few hours and it may be interesting for a short stop on to the way to your final destination.

By train[edit]
Visp is a stop on the major train lines from Geneva and Zurich. The Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn (platforms 1 - 3) also stops here with trains towards Zermatt and Andermatt. If you are coming from Domodossola, Milan or any other Italian destination, you probably have to change train in Brig.

46.2940297.8814651 Visp railway station. Station built in 2007, served by about 230 trains per day.   (updated Apr 2021)
By bus[edit]
The bus terminal is directly in front of the railway station. Among others, buses connect to Saas-Fee.

By car[edit]
If you are driving, you will most probably be coming in via the main road (N9) which leads through the town centre. Be sure you follow the main road and don't take the bypass (Umfahrung). There are several car parks (mostly underground) around the town centre, notably at the two supermarkets (Migros and Coop) and the railway station.

By plane[edit]
While Visp doesn't have a passenger airport, it's about equidistant (by train) from four airports with flights from all over Europe and beyond. From Geneva, Zurich and Basel, take a train towards Brig. Visp is just before Brig, and for each of these the trip will take about 2 h 30 min. From Milan Malpensa Airport, take a bus to Domodossola, and from there it's a short train hop across the border to Visp, it will take about 2 h 15 min.

Get around[edit]
On foot[edit]
Visp is small enough that all areas of interest can be reached by foot. The old town is 15 minutes' walk from the railway station.

By bus[edit]
There are buses running through town (on their way to somewhere else), but frequencies are at best half-hourly. The only bus which is potentially useful, is the one in direction of Visperterminen, which stops at the hospital (Visp, Spital). This stop is very close to the old town and saves you the walk uphill. 

See[edit]
St. Martin Church
Haus In-Albion
46.290287.881131 Burgerkirche Heilige Drei Könige, Kaplaneigasse. The tower of this Catholic church is from the 14th century, whereas the church was built from 1710-1730. (updated Apr 2016)

The three-floor "old almshouse" was built as a residential building in the 16th century, but from 1751 to 1965 it served as a guesthouse for poor travelers and pilgrims. As such, if the Internet and Wikivoyage would've been around in the 1960s, we might have listed it in Sleep#Budget. Today it hosts a youth cultural center, a club for the local handball team and the office for the refugee organization Forum Migration Wallis.  (updated May 2021)
46.290517.880725 Haus In-Albon, Gräfibielgasse 6. An impressive Gothic castle complex, that the local governor Simon In-Albon had built in the 16th century. The In-Albon family owned it until 1855, and it remains a private residence but it can be admired from the outside.  (updated May 2021)
46.287657.882396 Pflanzetta, St. Jodernstrasse 7. Visp was a crossroads long before the railway, and a trade route passed through town in the Middle Ages. The Pflanzetta building complex, named either after a family name or an old word for "field", was built as entrepôt and guesthouse in 1351. Over the centuries the route through slowly declined in importance as other routes were built across the Alps. After a thorough renovation in the 1980s, the rooms have been turned into apartments.
