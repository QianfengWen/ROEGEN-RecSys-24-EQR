Panevėžys is an industrial city in the Aukštaitija region of Lithuania. It's the country's fifth largest city, with a population of 	89,100 in 2021 and another 30,000 or so in the city district. It's about midway along the highway between Vilnius the capital and Riga the Latvian capital. 


Understand[edit]
"Panevėžys" means by the River Nevėžis, which here makes a loop in its westward course. The area has been inhabited since prehistory but the town is first documented in 1503. It has shared the turmoils and horrors of the rest of Lithuania, with prolonged peace from independence in 1990. It's long been industrial, major trades being concrete, metal works and mechanical engineering, ceramics, glass, and flax processing; the sugar refining business has fallen on hard times. Town centre has been smashed and rebuilt many times and much of it nowadays dates from the 1960s / 70s: drab architecture but functional, and leavened by broad squares and parks along the riverside.

By plane[edit]
Vilnius Airport (VNO IATA) is usually the most convenient, for its range of budget flights and onward transport. It's 145 km southeast on a good highway.
Kaunas Airport (KUN IATA) 106 km south and Riga Airport (RIX IATA) 160 km north in Latvia also have budget flights.

By train[edit]
Four trains daily from Šiauliai (starting from Mažeikiai) take 90 min to Panevežys. For times and online tickets see LTG Link.
55.745224.35461 Panevežys railway station off S Kerbedžio g is modern.

By bus[edit]
Eurolines run once a day from Riga airport via Riga city to Panevėžys, 2 hr 15 min, continuing to Kaunas. Another bus calls here on the way to Warsaw, and a third for Minsk. From further west (eg Berlin) change in Warsaw; from further east (eg Tallinn) change in Riga. 
Buses from Vilnius and from Kaunas run hourly and take two hours, continuing to Biržai or Šiauliai or Joniškis. From Klaipėda you usually have to back-track via Vilnius or Kaunas. Bus lines include Vlasava, Kautra and Toks. For timetables and fares see Autobusubilieta. 
55.727724.36482 Panevėžys bus station is just a drab open square, no shelter or anything. But it's central, close to amenities.

By road[edit]
From Vilnius take A7 north, a fast dual carriageway (no toll) that bypasses Ukmergė and Panevežys and continues across the border to Riga.
From Berlin and Warsaw make for Kaunas, and from Kaunas take A8 north. This is badged as E67 or Via Baltica, the highway from Prague to Helsinki. It's an undivided highway across Lithuania, and much of the route's grand strategic concept remains aspirational.

Get around[edit]
Most sights are within walking distance of the centre. Stops-Lt displays city bus routes: Bus 6A runs hourly from Janonio g and the railway station downtown then east out to Dembava. 
Taxis can be booked with the eTAKSI app for smartphones, similar to Uber/Lyft.
