Labuan is a fishing town on the west coast of Banten province, in the Western Java region of Indonesia.


Understand[edit]
Administratively, Labuan is a district in the regency of Pandeglang. It is located about 35 km west of the regency capital Pandeglang. Although there are several beaches in and around Labuan, the beaches are not as well-known as those in other nearby towns, such as Carita. Labuan is mostly known for its fish auction, and is a minor regional centre. The small island Pulau Popole is just off the coast of Labuan.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Labuan is on the trunk road along the western coast, that runs from Cilegon via Anyer and Carita to Labuan, and further south to Panimbang and the south coast. In addition, there is a road east from Labuan to the regency capital Pandeglang. The easiest way to get to the city from the capital Jakarta is by taking the Jakarta-Merak toll road until exit Serang Timur (East Serang). From there, the road leads to Labuan via Pandeglang. Without traffic, the drive from Jakarta takes up to 3 hours. However, due to traffic congestion this is usually about 4 hours.

By bus[edit]
As the railway to Labuan is no longer operated, the only way to get to the town by public transport is by bus. The -6.39384105.842971 Labuan bus terminal, on the eastern side of the town, is served by frequent buses and minibuses to nearby destinations such as Pandeglang, Cilegon, and the port of Merak, as well as to the Kalideres bus terminal in West Jakarta.
