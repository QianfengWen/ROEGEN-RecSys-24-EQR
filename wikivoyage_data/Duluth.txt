Duluth is a city of about 86,000 people (2018) in northern Minnesota.  It is one of the most scenic cities in the Midwest.


Understand[edit]
Downtown Duluth
Duluth has always been a shipping town: first for furs, later for iron ore, timber, and grain. As a shipping and milling town, Duluth once had the most millionaires per capita in the United States. This is still reflected in the large number of mansions in the east end of town. Ocean-going vessels come up the St. Lawrence Seaway into the Great Lakes to Duluth Harbor. Since these "salties" go through the locks, they are smaller than the native "lakers" that stay within the Great Lakes. Ships under many flags, including Nigeria, Greece, and Denmark, frequently dock in Duluth to pick up grain and coal for overseas markets. Iron-ore and taconite still go to Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania for processing into steel.
Built largely on a 700-foot (215-m) hill overlooking Lake Superior, Duluth also has a thriving tourism industry, with antique shops, excellent restaurants, cozy inns, and scenic views of the lake. There is a ski resort inside city limits. Canal Park and Superior Street have the highest concentrations of tourist destinations in the city. The famous Aerial Lift Bridge is on Lake Avenue, next to Canal Park. Particularly proud residents liken the city to San Francisco, which also has bridges, hills, a bay, and a thriving tourist business. The renowned Grandma's Marathon is held annually, named after Grandma's Saloon (restaurant) in Canal Park. The University of Minnesota-Duluth and St. Scholastica College are the two largest colleges in the city with over 12,000 students together.
Duluth is the western endpoint of the scenic North Shore Drive, which follows the rugged north coast of Lake Superior nearly 700 miles (1,120 km) to Sault Ste Marie (Ontario). Across the bay is Superior, Wisconsin.

Set on deep Lake Superior, the largest freshwater lake in the world by surface area, Duluth can be cool or cold anytime of year. The official temperatures are reported from the airport, over the hill, and can be ten or more degrees (Fahrenheit) above the downtown temperatures. Sixties (about 18°C) for a high in August are not uncommon, but it can reach the 80s (about 28°C) just as easily. Bitter windchills can occur in the winter, although air temperatures generally do not go below -20°F (-29°C). Despite this, some people bike to work year-round.  The temperatures can also change very rapidly, especially near the lake: a wind switch can be accompanied by a temperature drop of 30 degrees (F) in a couple of minutes.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Duluth is about a 2½-hour drive north of the Twin Cities on Interstate 35.  A driver entering Duluth on I-35 from the Twin Cities will be rewarded by a spectacular view of Duluth laid bare in the valley and Lake Superior into the horizon.  Travelers not familiar with Duluth may be surprised at how elevated the surrounding hills are.  The international airport sits at an elevation of 1,427 feet.  After long hours of relatively flat scenery, the view is a treat, especially during peak fall colors. The highway then descends at a steep grade just to the east of downtown; Exit 256B is the recommended exit for most downtown attractions.

By plane[edit]
46.838912-92.1798881 Duluth International Airport (DLH  IATA). Offering daily non-stop service to Minneapolis/Saint Paul, Detroit and Chicago. In addition service is offered occasionally and sometimes seasonally to Las Vegas, Phoenix and Orlando.

By bus[edit]
Duluth is served by Jefferson Lines.

Skyline shuttle runs 10 times a day between the Minneapolis-St Paul airport and Duluth downtown Radisson hotel. Landline Bus Service runs several direct shuttles a day between Minneapolis and Duluth Miller Mall and the airport.

By boat[edit]
Duluth-Superior (WI) is an international seaport, by way of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway, and while the taconite industry has dropped way off from the Iron Range, timber is still shipped by boat. Cruise ships that travel the Great Lakes have Duluth as a stop on their itineraries.

By car[edit]
Driving is probably the best option for getting around Duluth. The city generally does not have any traffic problems, although it can get congested in Canal Park.
The city is built on a rather steep hill, so if you travel around anywhere other than downtown or I-35, make sure your brakes are in good order.  It can be slushy in the winter as the road crews typically put down salt first, then plow the roads when traffic is lighter.  However, being on the west side of the lake, Duluth doesn't normally receive the large lake-effect snowfalls, 2–6 in (51–152 mm) is the normal snowstorm.
US Highway 53 crosses from Wisconsin to the south to the Iron Range in the north, and will take you to Miller Hill Mall, on top of the hill on the west side. US Highway 2 runs east-west. Keep in mind that the majority of the city is laid out in a grid based on the Lake Superior shoreline.  This is about 45 degrees off of true north, however the residents refer to east/west streets running parallel to the lake, and north/south avenues that are perpendicular to the lake.  Lake Avenue is considered to be the dividing line between east and west.

By bus/taxi[edit]
Public bus and trolley services are operated by the Duluth Transit Authority (DTA).
Uber and Lyft drivers are often available throughout the Twin Ports area.
Allied Taxi (☏ +1 218 722-3311) and SK Taxi (☏ +1 218-221-1604) offer transportation within the city limits and into Wisconsin as well.

By bike[edit]
The Duluth-Superior Metropolitan Interstate Council has made a bike map for the Twin Ports area.
Scooter rental is available from multiple vendors, including Leaf.

Mr. Caldwell, in the bedroom, with a candlestick...
Greed knows no bounds. Nowhere in Duluth is that more apparent than in the Glensheen Mansion on the shores of Lake Superior. On a warm night in July 1977, Elisabeth Congdon, heir to a mining fortune was murdered in her sleep by her adopted daughter's husband. Congdon's nurse was bludgeoned with a candelestick. Caldwell was after a cut of the $8 million inheritance that his wife stood to gain upon the old woman's death. Congdon was already in poor health, but Caldwell refused to wait for nature to take its toll. Docents on the mansion tour are instructed not to discuss the murders, or to point out the bedroom where Congdon died....but the docents are usually university students in need of some extra cash, so a good tip can sometimes loosen their tongues.
