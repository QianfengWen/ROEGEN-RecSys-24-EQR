Hokitika's iconic driftwood sculpture
Hokitika (local English pronunciation "hoke-uh-TICK-uh"), gateway to the South Westland World Heritage National Park, is on the West Coast of New Zealand's South Island.


Understand[edit]
Founded on gold mining in 1864, Hokitika was a centre of the West Coast Gold Rush and grew very quickly. By late 1866, it was one of New Zealand's most populous centres. On 16 September 1867, there were 41 vessels alongside the wharf, as the port of Hokitika ranked first in New Zealand in both the number of vessels entered inwards and in the total value of exports, principally gold.

The population has declined greatly since the Gold Rush, but the population of the Westland District is now on the rise, thanks to "lifestyle inhabitants". Almost 30% of the district's rate-payers live outside of Hokitika.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Hokitika is about three hours' drive from Christchurch via State Highway 73 over scenic Arthur's Pass; it's worth stopping at Arthur's Pass National Park HQ, enjoying the views, and keeping an eye out for kea.Lake Kaniere
By bus[edit]
Intercity Coachlines travel to Greymouth from Christchurch or Nelson, and there are regular coaches from Greymouth, 40 minutes away. It's approximately 2 hours drive from Fox Glacier.

Get around[edit]
Map of Hokitika
On foot[edit]
Hokitika is small enough that you can see most things on foot. The majority are around the old main street, Revell Street, which was laid out by an amateur town planner during Gold Rush days to follow the sand dunes, and is notably kinked (it's known as the "Crooked Mile").

Buy[edit]
Pounamu is a nephrite jade found only on the West Coast, and its harvest and sale is governed by Ngai Tahu. There are a variety of pounamu stores, mainly along Weld and Tancred Streets. Beware some shops selling Canadian jade carved in China - if the price looks too good to be true, it's probably not pounamu. You can see Ngati Waewae carvers in action and buy verified pounamu carvings at Te Waipounamu Maori Heritage Centre, on the corner of Weld & Sewell.
