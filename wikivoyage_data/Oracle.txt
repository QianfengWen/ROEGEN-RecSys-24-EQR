Get in[edit]
Map of Oracle
Drive to Oracle; there is no mass transit nor trains, and the airport closed years ago. It is located 38 miles from downtown Tucson.
Bicycle to Oracle: especially on Saturday mornings, a surprising number of people can be seen bicycling up State Highway 77 from as far as Tucson.  Bicycling to Oracle from Tucson involves an uphill slog of 30 or more miles and a climb of about 2000 feet in elevation.  It's for serious cyclists only, but there sure are a lot of them!
Hiking to Oracle is more practical than you might expect; Oracle is on the edge of the Coronado National Forest, and the state-spanning Arizona State Trail skims Oracle's outskirts.
Hitchhike to Oracle: sometimes possible.
Get around[edit]
Driving is usually easiest.
Bicycling requires the ability to do mild hill climbs and to cover a few miles, even within Oracle itself.
Horses are for some a fun way to travel through Oracle and vicinity.
Walking, if you don't mind covering a few miles on foot.
Hitchhiking is sometimes possible.
