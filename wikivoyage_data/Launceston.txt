Tamar Island[edit]
The Tamar Island Wetlands is a unique urban wetlands reserve 10 minutes' drive from the heart of Launceston in Tasmania's north.
Tamar Island has been Crown Land since settlement and up to the 1980s was leased to private and public operators. In the 1980s the Tasmanian Government purchased the wetlands area around Tamar Island, which was incorporated into the greater Tamar River Conservation Area.
An interpretation centre offers visitors the opportunity to learn about the  value of the wetlands, along with a hike that takes you through the wetlands, in bird hides and over to the historic Tamar Island.

Cataract Gorge[edit]
Cataract Gorge
Cataract Gorge is 1 km from the centre of Launceston.  There is paid parking at the entrance to the park, either all day or by the hour.

There are many walking tracks which skirt the side of the gorge, and cross it at a suspension bridge and a low level bridge.
You can swim in the gorge.  The water can be quite cold, and there is a current, but with care you should be fine.  There are constructed entrances to the water, and access is free.  There is also an unheated swimming pool, and access to that is also free.
You can see the gardens and pergolas, and the peacocks walking around.
You can play on the playgrounds.
You can take a chairlift across the gorge, and walk back, or vice-versa,  although going both ways on the chairlift is about the same price as a one way ticket.
There is a cafe on each side of the gorge, serving ice-creams, coffee, snacks, etc.
