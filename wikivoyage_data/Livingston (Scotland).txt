Livingston is a large town in  West Lothian in the central belt of Scotland, built as a "New Town" from 1963. In 2020 it had a population of 56,840. 


Understand[edit]
In the 12th century a Flemish man, De Leving, built a fortified tower (long gone) and the settlement of Levingstoun or Livingston grew up around it. In the 19th century, West Lothian became urbanised when the shale oil industry developed, but the Livingston area remained farmland until the 1960s. Then five "new towns" were built rapidly to relieve congestion in Glasgow, four of them on greenfield sites (East Kilbride, Glenrothes, Cumbernauld and Livingston) while the fifth was built onto the existing town of Irvine. Livingston was laid out on a grid, with A899 running north-south and A705 running east-west, and a chequerboard of residential estates. These include Livingston Village, Bellsquarry, Craigshill, Howden, Dedridge, Ladywell, Knightsridge, Murieston, Adambrae, Deans and Eliburn. The town has expanded to engulf Polbeth, West Calder, East Calder, Mid Calder, Uphall and Pumpherston. It was run by a development corporation (a "quango") until 1997 then local government transferred to West Lothian; Robin Cook was its MP from 1983 until his death in 2005.

By rail[edit]
The fundamental assumption of a 1960s New Town is that everyone will drive, and railways are old hat. So the town straggles between two railway lines, neither particularly convenient.

55.8716-3.50153 Livingston South is by the Murieston shops and has trains from Edinburgh every 30 min via Haymarket, Slateford, Kingsknowe, Wester Hailes, Curriehill and Kirknewton, taking 30 min. These continue through West Calder, Shotts and a dozen other halts, taking up to an hour to reach Glasgow Central.
