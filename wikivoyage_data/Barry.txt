Barry Island Promenade
Barry (Welsh: Y Barri) is a town in Glamorgan in South Wales.
Barry has 'twinning agreements' with Fecamp in France, Mouscron in Belgium and Rheinfelden in Germany via the Vale of Glamorgan Council.
Barry is a seaside resort town with sandy beaches at Whitmore Bay, Jackson Bay and the Old Harbour, and a (very long) pebble beach stretching from Knap Point past Porthkerry Park to Rhoose Point, the most Southern point in mainland Wales.
The main industry and employer in Barry is the Docks and several chemical companies, including DOW, Hexion, Zeon and Cabot Carbon.


Get in[edit]
By road[edit]
Barry has very good road links, the M4 is approximately 15 minutes away to junction 33 at Cardiff West via the A4232 to Culverhouse Cross, then the A4050 directly to Barry and the airport.

By bus[edit]
Barry is not on the National Coach network route, but Cardiff is only a short bus or train journey away for national and international coach travel.

By train[edit]
There is a regular train service to Cardiff Central station about 20 minutes journey from Barry Island railway station with direct connections to the rest of the country and international connections. There is also the service which runs West to Bridgend, over the Porthkerry Park viaduct and Rhoose.

By air[edit]
51.396667-3.3433331 Cardiff International Airport (CWL IATA) is the only major airport in Wales and is situated some 5 miles to the west of Barry in the Vale of Glamorgan at Rhoose. The airport is served by a number of airlines which operates to domestic and foreign destinations. There are regular bus services to and from the town centre to the airport. You can also get to the airport using a rail service to Rhoose (Cardiff International Airport) railway station, then use a shuttle bus to the airport.

By sea[edit]
Although Barry has a large dock system, there are no passenger services into the port apart from the odd visit in the summer by the coastal day cruise vessels Balmoral and the Paddle steamer Waverley. There is talk of a ferry service to Minehead, in the West of England, which is less than 15 miles by sea and possibly less than 1 hours travel, but 3 hours travel by car.

Barry - Barry is the filming location and setting of the BBC Comedy, Gavin and Stacey. James Corden and Ruth James aren't the only celebs to have been filmed there. The late Elizabeth Sladen and the rest of the crew from Russel T. Davis' "Sarah-Jane Adventures" have also appeared in Barry. Many scenes from "Doctor Who" have also been filmed in Barry too. One of the most frequently seen places in Barry is Whitmore Bay, a long beach popular with local surfers in the summer, and all year round, those seeking entertainment in the Pavilion. Behind the pavilion, Barry Island can be found, home to the well-renowned but small Theme Park. Barry Island is a popular resort, with visitors of all kind, from thrill-seekers to hikers to surfers or just someone who wants a nice breakfast from a good-old greasy caf (although fine dining can be found along the promenade). Barry Town centre has little to it but some local, independent shops and restaurants.
Dinosaur footprints - Barry also has another surprise! Dinosaur footprints can be seen on a rocky beach just round the corner from Whitmore Bay. A line of three-toed footprints can be found running from under the sea up to the fallen, mud-based cliff. The footprints are visible in a line, and are fossilized in the mud and clay-based red coloured rock.
The Bendricks can be found just East of Barry by following signs to "HMS Cambria", and following a road round to a small industrial estate.
