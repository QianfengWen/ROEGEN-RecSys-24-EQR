Dunmore East is a small village on the coast of County Waterford in southeast Ireland. Its Irish name Dún Mór means "big fort", and has been applied to innumerable hillocks where ancient people huddled in the wind and rain, so this one is specifically Dunmore East. It acquired a good harbour in the 19th century, and became a fishing port and tourist resort. In 2016 it had a population of 1808.

The village is small enough to walk around.

See[edit]
The Harbour is surprisingly large for such a small village. In the early 19th century there were grand schemes for a new mail and passenger service from England, and Dunmore was to be the Irish port. A new harbour was completed in 1837, massively over-budget and just in time to be obsolete, as steam-powered ships could wend their way upriver to Waterford city. However it did boost the local fishing industry, and helped with tourism as cruise liners could land passengers here by tender.
Upper Village is the area north of the harbour. The coast here is rocky, good for angling. The Round Tower is all that's left of the castle built in 1640: it's just a stump.
Lower Village north of that has the sandy Lawlor's Beach.
Do[edit]
Dunmore Adventure by the harbour run various water-based activities, including the Wibit inflatable obstacle course.
Dunmore Angling[dead link] is a boat charter operation, mostly for angling but when there's demand they do scenic boat trips and dive trips.
The cliff walk follows the coast west for 5 km to Portally Cove, which has road access.
Dunmore East Golf Club contains the holiday resort, see Sleep. There's an amateur golf classic tournament in April: the next is probably 26-29 April 2021 but tbc.
Bluegrass Festival is held at the end of August. The 2020 event was cancelled and the next is expected to be 27-29 Aug 2021.
