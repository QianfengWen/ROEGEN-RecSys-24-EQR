Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
V/Line - is probably the easiest way to get into Traralgon from Melbourne. Myki cards are valid for travel to Traralgon but not beyond.

By car[edit]
Just head east on the not so scenic Princes Freeway. The freeway is quite unusual, since it has traffic lights and houses along the way. Once you're at the end, you're at Traralgon. 

By plane[edit]
Some flights go to Latobe Valley Airport.

Get around[edit]
Traralgon by taking the Yallourn exit and passing through Tyres and Glengary. Come out at Heyfield before continuing on towards you're intended destination.

Drink[edit]
Traralgon is well known throughout the state as a genuinely refreshing, and interesting, place to let loose, country style. Favourite local watering holes include the Saloon Bar at the bottom of Kay Street, where old classics and top 40s music is played well in to the morning. A huge dance floor and great beergarden make for a delightful evening's entertainment. There's also a deer head in the bar above the smaller dance floor, which speaks volumes of the townsfolk, as well as a couple of large mirrors opposite the main bar for the salmon-tinged, collar up t-shirt wearing country boys.
If it's a bogan-infested, snooker-playing, guaranteed broken-jaw kind of setting you're after, then perhaps Ryan's Hotel would be your place of preference.  Friday nights primarily cater for a younger, more energetic crowd. Violence is still peaking in this venue, though everyone knows everyone anyway, so as long as you didn't sleep with Bazza's sister, or steal Wazza's parents lambs, you should be pretty safe. Great DJ also.
If you just want a decent Irish bar, go to Flanagan's on the corner of Hotham Street and the Princess Highway. Regular alcoholics rule the roost at this local favourite, though they are a friendly bunch, and a large number of poker machines sit adjacent to the building, awaiting your every last cent. A great beergarden is also a feature of this establishment.
