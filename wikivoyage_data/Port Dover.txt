Port Dover is a community of about 6,200 people (2016) in Norfolk County. Port Dover's big draw is its beach: during the warm months, palm trees thrive on Erie Beach. Port Dover is perhaps best known by the events held every Friday the 13th when thousands of motorcyclists get together and spend a day or two partying, drinking, and displaying their bikes for others to see.

History[edit]
Boats moored at Port Dover
Port Dover's earliest known inhabitants, from around the year 1000 until approximately 300–350 years later, were the Algonquin nation. They were noted flint-workers and evidence of their skill in crafting arrowheads is still to be found in open worked field areas surrounding the village. The next wave of inhabitants were the Attawandaron nation, the Neutrals, who occupied the region from about 1350 until their absorption by the Iroquois in 1651. The last significant Indigenous nation to occupy the area was the Mississaugas.
In 1670, French missionaries François Dollier de Casson and René Bréhant de Galinée became the first Europeans to winter at what is now Port Dover. Earthen remains and a plaque mark the spot near the fork of the Lynn River (Patterson's Creek to many older Port Doverites) and Black Creek where they and seven Frenchmen (the first Europeans known to have ascended the Great Lakes to Sault Ste. Marie) built a hut and chapel. The "Cliff Site" is designated as a National Historic Site of Canada.  Just outside the community, a cross with the arms of France was erected on 23 March 1670, claiming the area for King Louis XIV over the Lake Erie region. 
By 1794 the first European settlers, a group of United Empire Loyalists, had established a hamlet known as Dover Mills (named for the English port of Dover). 
This community was attacked during the War of 1812, in May 1814. After making their landing on the shore, 750 American soldiers launched a surprise attack on the village's civilians. Scattered elements of nearby militia and regular units tried to defend the village without any success. The survivors of the war rebuilt the town of Port Dover further downstream on Patterson's Creek. 

Port Dover Lighthouse
By 1842, the village's harbour, lighthouse and bridge across the river had been completed as had the road to Hamilton; there was a grammar school, a grist mill, a saw mill and a Presbyterian church in the course of construction. The Hamilton & Northwestern Railway completed the final section to Port Dover and to Jarvis in the mid-1870s. The South Norfolk Railway began operating in 1889. 
By the 1920s tourism was an important contributor to the economy, with many summer visitors attracted by the beach. There was some light industry in the town but Port Dover was best known as a major fishing centre, with fish shipped by rail and by ship in Canada and to the U.S.

A good example of a building associated with the establishment of navigational aids on the Great Lakes. The construction of the Port Dover lighthouse was part of the Canadian response to improve the Great Lakes - St. Lawrence route, to compete with the American-built Erie Canal system that linked New York with Buffalo on Lake Erie. The wharf and light have been, and continue to be, the centre of Port Dover's economy, which is focused on commercial fishing and an active summer resort trade. This lighthouse is one of a number of square wooden towers built on the Great Lakes in the 19th century and is one of the oldest examples in Ontario of the small wooden lighthouses built in pre-Confederation years.

Outdoor attractions include the 1932 fishtug Almidart, a 1912 lake-freighter wheelhouse, and access to the river along a picturesque wooden dock. There is also a major collection of artefacts from the 1852 wreck of the Steamer Atlantic near Long Point.  (updated Aug 2018)
Do[edit]
Port Dover is a popular destination for anglers and generally maintains a "fishing community" feel. Although not a large enough town to enjoy much of a night life, many of the locals and people from surrounding communities tend to enjoy spending time at the pier and along the beaches. 'Dover is also a good place for sailing and most people with pleasure craft in the area tend to use the town as a port.
There are scenic waterfalls nearby and tourists generally go to nearby Port Ryerse as a side trip. Local roads that originate from here often lead to the hamlets of Fishers Glen, Normandale and Turkey Point (which is another seasonal beach destination). Apple wine, produced by the local farmers themselves, can be purchased by anyone due to their lack of alcohol content. This product is available in the Port Dover area.
On clear summer nights, the Port Dover lighthouse can be seen glimmering brightly with the moon.

Friday the 13th[edit]
Willie's Restaurant in Port Dover on Friday the 13th
Port Dover is perhaps best known by the events held every Friday the 13th (the movie Friday the 13th was filmed in Port Dover). Each time a Friday the 13th arrives on the calendar, bikers descend Port Dover from as far away as Ottawa and parts of the United States (New York State and Pennsylvania being the closest). 
Thousands of bikers (either die-hard members of biker groups or those who own a motorcycle for fun) get together and spend a day or two partying, drinking, BBQing and displaying their bikes for others to see. It can be a fun occasion for all involved, especially if you own a bike. People from all walks of life enjoy each other's company and celebrate their mutual interests.
Despite the negative image generally given to biker culture, the risk of crime at one of these events is low. Aside from occasional drunken brawls, you can expect next to no crime. The bikers will generally look out for each other's rides and won't tolerate any nonsense from anyone else.
