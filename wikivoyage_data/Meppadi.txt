See[edit]
11.5117576.08871 Chembra Peak (3 km). Standing tall at 2100 metres, the Chembra Peak is the highest peak in Wayanad, and a favorite trekking spot. It is part of the Western Ghats. The trek to the top can take up to 2 hours. The heart-shaped lake located on the peak forms one of the attractions for the mountain trek here. To do the trek, you need to pay an entrance fee from the entry guard house near Meppadi. Typically, start the trek in the morning as you are not allowed to start the trek after noon. If you are not game for a hectic 2-hour trek, you can still do a flat trek till a nearby viewpoint and visitors center for a nominal fee. The Chembra Peak area has a variety of orchids and other flowering plants, and plenty of bird species, making the trek an enjoyable experience. Good toilets are available near the guard house. The road leading to the entrance was in bad condition as of October 2017. ₹20 for visiting area entry. Guides are available for ₹500.   (updated Nov 2017)
 DM-WIMS Campus (5 km), ☏ +91 4936 287000. DM Wayanad Institute of Medical Sciences is the most scenic campus of the entire Kerala state. The road to the campus is a spiritual experience if you want to replace Nature for a god. There is nothing to see inside the spectacular hospital building, but their cafeteria on the mezzanine floor is worth a visit. Visitors are allowed inside if you have some excuse like inquiring about medical college admissions. Buses are available to and from the hospital from Meppadi town. The Supreme Court of India issued a warning to the hospital for building in an environmentally sensitive area. (updated Jun 2015)
