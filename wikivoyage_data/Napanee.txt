Napanee, a community in eastern Ontario, is the county seat of Lennox & Addington County.


Understand[edit]
Napanee Town Hall
This article covers a broad rural area between Belleville and Kingston. The Greater Napanee Area is a population 17,000 town (in 2021) comprised of all the communities historically in the former Lennox County (Napanee, Adolphustown, North and South Fredericksburgh, and Richmond).

History[edit]
The first recorded settlement in the area of Greater Napanee is Ganneious, an Iroquois village, settled temporarily by the Oneida from approximately 1660 to 1690. The village was located on or near the Hay Bay area and is one of seven Iroquois villages settled on the northern shores of Lake Ontario in the 17th century. The exact location of the village has not been determined.
The area was settled by United Empire Loyalists fleeing persecution in the United States in 1784. The first Loyalists settlers landing spot (in Adolphustown) and site of the first Loyalist cemetery in the area has been preserved by the Loyalists.
The town developed at the site of a waterfall, the head of navigation, on the Napanee River where early industry could use the power potential of the river. The river transported logs from the interior north of the town. Sawmilling, gristmilling and other farm service industries were established. Gibbard Furniture (1835-2010) was at one point Canada's oldest furniture factory, operating beside the Napanee River for 173 years.
Napanee was first known as Clarksville after Robert Clark, who built a grist mill there. The town's most famous resident was popular musician Avril Lavigne.
