Understand[edit]
Spa Resort Hawaiians
Iwaki has a population of 345,000. It’s Japan’s 10th largest and 72nd most populous city.
Iwaki was formed in 1966 by incorporating many smaller towns, including Taira (the central area with the main train station), Uchigō, Yumoto, Izumi, Onahama (the port town), Ueda and many other smaller areas.  They were amalgamated a few decades ago in order to boost its status due to a receding population. The name Iwaki had been used for a long time to refer to the general area however it had many different Kanji depictions, so to remove any confusion the name Iwaki is officially written in the hiragana syllabary (いわき).
Formerly, coal mining formed the core of its economy, but in the face of advancing technology, turned to tourism, the Spa Resort Hawaiians being one of its biggest attractions.
The main foundation of economy is industry and agriculture. The industrial production of Iwaki City is no.1 in Tōhoku region. Iwaki is rich in sightseeing resources and 7.64 million tourists visit a year. Within Fukushima prefecture, the industrial and sightseeing center is Iwaki, while the political center is Fukushima city.

Ancient Japanese people had a tendency of being afraid of the unknown in northern Japan.
