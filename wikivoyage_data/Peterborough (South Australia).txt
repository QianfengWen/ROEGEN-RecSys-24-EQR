Peterborough was once a vast rail operation, a crossroads on former narrow-gauge lines, with a hundred steam locomotives daily heading to all corners of Australia. Many of the lines were re-gauged or closed; a heritage railway line which ran north in the late 1970s was abandoned in 2002 and dismantled in 2008. The sheds and heritage-listed roundhouse were preserved as a static museum with locomotives and carriages. A night-time ‘Sound and Light Show’ is presented (extra cost). $15/person for guided tours.
