Sun Peaks is a municipality and ski resort near Kamloops in the Thompson-Nicola region of British Columbia. There is something to do year-round for just about anyone. In winter, there is world-class skiing, and many other winter sports. In summer, the area is transformed into a hiker’s and biker’s paradise, with mountain trails for adventurers of all levels of experience. There is also an 18-hole golf course, and many events and festivals, for those who wish to have a more "relaxed" vacation time. The official name of the Sun Peaks community is the Sun Peaks Mountain Resort Municipality.


Understand[edit]
Downtown Sun Peaks
Sun Peaks started as a ski resort on Tod Mountain. The resort was founded by Harry Burfield, and The Burfield Lodge and first chair-lift at Sun Peaks opened to the public in 1961. The resort has expanded significantly in the years since and now covers three mountains: Tod Mountain, Sundance and Mount Morrisey.
Residential construction began in 1988, when a 49-lot subdivision across from the Burfield Lodge began construction. There are now over 400 residents. The community was incorporated as a resort municipality in 2008.
Sun Peaks Resort was the first ski resort in North America (and remains the only resort in Canada) to receive the ISO 14001 designation recognizing its environmental policies and practices.

Climate[edit]
Sun Peaks gets an average annual snowfall of 220 in (or more than 18 ft) (559 cm / 5.5 m) The resort village is at an elevation of 4117 ft (1255 m) above sea level, and the top lift elevation is 6824 ft (2080 m). The yearly average temperature is -6°C (22°F), with highs in the winter around the freezing mark and lows around -10°C (14°F). In the summer, the high temperatures average around 19°C (67°F), but can reach up into the low 30s °C (high 80s °F). The resort is probably known as “Sun” Peaks because it averages over 2,000 hours of sunlight annually.

See[edit]
Sun Peaks downtown in autumn
Aside from the skiing in the winter months, no one really does anything else in Sun Peaks from about October to March.  
There is, of course, the splendid scenery in and around Sun Peaks to see year-round. Since it’s right in the heart of the Shushwap Highlands, the scenery couldn’t be much more spectacular. In the summer, you can hike and bike on trails on the mountains, and in the winter, you can ski on them. What more could you ask for as far as beautiful views in and of the mountains?  Mountains serving as ski hills include 50.91659-119.940661 Tod Mountain  and 50.86127-119.900782 Mount Morrisey.

Do[edit]
Sun Peaks has no shortage of activities for you to take part in. There are lots of things to do year-round, for people of all levels of physical ability, as well as just relaxing around a hot tub. Below, there is a list based on the time of year, as well as a few things to do at Sun Peaks year-round.

Winter[edit]
The most popular winter activity at Sun Peaks is skiing and snowboarding.

50.8848-119.88551 Sun Peaks Resort, ☏ +1 250-578-5474, guestservices@sunpeaksresort.com. The ski resort features 4,270 acres of ski runs, the 2nd largest in Canada, and 135 trails spread over three mountains. It has some of the best weather for skiing in Canada, with an average of over 2,000 hours of sunshine per year.   (updated May 2023)
Aside from downhill and cross-country skiing and snowboarding, there are many other things to do. A short list includes:

Backcountry skiing and snowboarding a guide will take you to the backside of Tod Mountain for a day trip to areas not generally open to the public. You would have to be an intermediate to expert skier to take advantage of such a trip.
Groomer rides Have you ever wanted to know what it’s like to ride in one of the ski run grooming machines? Or maybe take a tour of the mountain without being on your skis? You can take a 3/4 to 1 hour ride in one of the groomers and see just what it is they do.
Dogsledding Just like you’ve seen on TV, you can pilot a team of sled dogs (called “mushing”) through the woods at Sun Peaks. This is another activity that requires a fair amount of physical stamina and strength, and shouldn’t be undertaken by anyone who isn’t prepared to occasionally have to run beside their dog teams through deep snow, uphill.
Snowshoeing One of the quietest and most relaxing ways to get around the mountains in winter, snowshoeing is also probably one of the oldest methods of winter transportation in this part of the world. On snowshoes, you can see parts of the mountains that are inaccessible in any other way, and see the beauty and wildlife of the Rockies up close.
Snowmobiling The exact opposite of snowshoeing, snowmobiling is neither quiet, nor relaxing. It is, however a very exciting and exhilarating way to take a tour around the mountainside.
Sleigh rides Another old-fashioned way to enjoy the countryside is in a horse-drawn sleigh. Again, we’re back to the quiet and relaxing type of transportation through the mountains.
Snow tubing Much like the inflatable tubes that can be pulled behind a motor boat on a lake, you can also ride one of these types of tubes down a snow-covered hill. Sun Peaks has a large Snow Tubing park where tub riders of all ages can slide as much as they want.
Ice skating There is a full-sized skating rink at Sun Peaks where anyone who enjoys skating can take part in public skates or drop-in ice hockey games. Check the schedules to see which type of skating is going on at a particular time.
Summer[edit]
Golf
50.88442-119.885842 Sun Peaks Golf Course, Creekside Way, ☏ +1 250-578-5431, toll-free: +1-855-574-5474. An 18 hole golf course. (updated May 2023)
Canoeing and kayaking There are numerous lakes and rivers nearby, all worthy of a canoe or kayak trip. It’s also easy to find guides to take you on a trip of this kind. If you’re staying at one of the major hotels, they will provide access to such a service.
Fishing As noted above, there are many lakes and rivers, and therefore, opportunities to go fishing very close by Sun Peaks.
Hiking Since Sun Peaks is in the heart of the Rocky Mountains, it is one of the nicest places for a summer mountain hike. There are numerous trails within and around Sun Peaks, just waiting for you to take a leisurely stroll or a strenuous hike.
Mountain biking As with Hiking, above, there are many mountain biking trails in and around Sun Peaks. Mountain biking has become a very popular summer sport at most ski resorts in the summertime.
Horseback riding Again, as with mountain biking, horseback trail riding is a very popular thing to do in the mountains in the summer.
50.87753-119.913643 Sun Peaks Stables, Industrial Way, ☏ +1 250-572-1325, sunpeaksstables@gmail.com. Offers trail rides, riding lessons, and carriage and wagon rides. (updated May 2023)
Year-round[edit]
Swimming Sun Peaks has no shortage of heated indoor and outdoor swimming pools. This makes swimming available to everyone, all year round.
Photography clinics The Rockies are spectacular in any season, and there are several professional photographers at Sun Peaks who run photography clinics year-round. This can be a great addition to your trip. Whether you’re a novice or a “serious amateur”, you’ll be able to build on the skills you will learn at these clinics. Be prepared to get up really early in the mornings, as some of the best photographs and the most spectacular views happen at sunrise.

Stay safe[edit]
The resort is in a mountainous area that is fairly isolated from any major cities. There is always the chance of an encounter with a bear or even possibly a cougar when deep in the mountains. If you are skiing or hiking or otherwise traveling off the beaten path in the backcountry, it is wise to take any precautions necessary to protect yourself in case of such an encounter. Always carry a cell phone or other radio device, so you can contact someone in an emergency, and never travel alone. Since this is a mountainous region, there is also the risk of falling and being injured badly enough to not be able to make it back to where you came from. Again, always travel with an experienced guide or group, and make sure you have access to a radio transmitting device in case of an emergency situation.

Skiing safety[edit]
There are elements of risk that common sense and personal awareness can help reduce. Regardless of how you use the slopes, always show courtesy to others. Please adhere to the code listed below and share with others the responsibility for a safe outdoor experience.

Always stay in control. You must be able to stop, or avoid other people or objects.
People ahead of you have the right of way. It is your responsibility to avoid them.
Do not stop where you obstruct a trail, or are not visible from above.
