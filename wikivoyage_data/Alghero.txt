Buy[edit]
Alghero is famous for its red coral jewelry and silverware. All coral jewelry is unsustainably harvested from living wild coral reefs that form important ocean habitats. Ethical travellers should avoid buying any sort of coral jewelry.

Eat[edit]
As in most parts of Italy food in Alghero is an important thing. The town's fishing port provides seafood fresh from the sea. Make sure that you try Catalan lobster, lobster salad with raw tomatoes and onion. Ricci (sea urchins) are also very popular in Alghero with a festival being held in their honor around February during the "Sagra del Bogamarì".
Basically, anywhere in town is good, as long as you avoid the tourist restaurants with "il menu turistico".
