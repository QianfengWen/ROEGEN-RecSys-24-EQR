For other places with the same name, see Padang (disambiguation).

Padang is the capital city of West Sumatra, Indonesia. It is mostly used by tourists as an access point to Bungus Bay, the surfing sites of the Mentawai Islands, the inland hills of Bukittinggi, and the Kerinci Seblat National Park.


Understand[edit]
The city is very pleasant with a nice promenade along the beach, distinctive Padang architecture and wonderfully friendly people. The city is also the home of the delicious Padang food and the town is stuffed with restaurants and street stalls. The locally available guidebook 'Sozzie Sumatra' can be referred to on arrival for upcoming local events and a current 'what to do' section.
Padang is a considered to be the main centre of Minangkabau culture. Unusually among the world's Muslim peoples, the Minangkabau are matriarchal, with husbands moving into their wives' homes after marriage, and with family possessions being passed from mother to daughter rather than father to son.

By plane[edit]
-0.7866100.28561 Minangkabau International Airport (Bandara Internasional Minangkabau - BIM PDG  IATA) (located 23 km north-west of Padang). The main gateway to West Sumatra, with frequent flights to destinations throughout Sumatra and Java (such as Garuda-Indonesia, Sriwijaya Air, Lion Air, Citilink, and Wings Air), and to Kuala Lumpur (AirAsia). Direct flights to Padang are available from: Jakarta, Batam, Medan, Bandung, Surabaya, Bengkulu and International from Kuala Lumpur.   
From the airport, the cheapest way to get into the city is by Minangkabau Express Airport Train, for a fare of Rp 10,000 per person, departs only five times a day, due to the single-track railway operation.
Damri bus also connects the airport with the city for a fare of Rp 25,000 per person. Its route passes by the coast and major hotels in Padang, to end in the Imam Bonjol terminal. The bus departs the city every hour from 04:30 and the last one at 18:00. The trip takes roughly 45 minutes depending on the traffic.
Taxis and rental cars are also available at the airport.

By train[edit]
Rail transport to Padang are limited, the only passenger trains running is a service from Pariaman several times per day. This connection can be quite useful if traveling from Jakarta overland. The main station is -0.94186100.3736882 Stasiun Padang, located just off Jl. Dalam Gadung road.

By bus[edit]
There are many luxury buses from Java to Padang, mostly from Jakarta and Bandung. It is a good option for the budget if you don't mind being on the road for two to three days, since flight tickets can cost more than three times of their normal price, especially during Eid Al-Fitr season.
From Bukittinggi, minibus Rp20,000, duration ~2h.
From Harau Valley, minibus from shop/loket 'Pt.Ricky RA. Transport', near an AgenBRILink, Rp30,000, duration ~5h. Likely to drop around Basko grand mall. Take an orange angkot to reach the Plaza Andalas mall in the centre for Rp5,000.

Get around[edit]
Crazily-decorated angkots run along the two main roads. Prices for a trip are approximately Rp 2,000. You can get taxis from the Minangkabau International Airport to town for less than Rp 50,000 if you speak the language.
If you are obviously foreign, Minang people are well known to be good business people and are quite skilled at making you pay a few extra thousand rupiahs. But don't bother squabbling over 50 cents here or there.
There are several alternatives that you can choose for transportation in Padang, such as bus kota (for city bus transportation), angkutan kota (for transportation in the city), taxi, and car rental. Most public transportation is not safe and clean by international standards. During rush hour, the buses are overcrowded. Be careful with your valuables, although pickpocketing is very rare.
If you're looking to spend a few days in Padang, car rental is the preferred way to go around. All car rentals include the driver, who can also act as your guide. It's not recommended for tourists to self-drive, because road signs are not followed by the locals and courtesy while driving is virtually nonexistent in Indonesia.
If you need a taxi, Argo, Blue Bird Taxi and Grab Taxi apps can be downloaded for free. Fill the departure and arrival points and Google Maps will show the map and the taxis and also estimate the cost in a range. Taxis arrive within 5 minutes after being summoned. Only qualified taxis and qualified drivers can join the apps. The service is available in Bukittinggi and Payakumbuh as well.

Do[edit]
Relaxing is the main thing to do here. This is a mainly administrative city. Honestly, there isn't too much to do downtown. But if you go uptown, some interesting spots await to be explored. These include Sikuai Island, Lubuk Minturun river (a 'natural jacuzzi') and Bungus Bay (crystal water river), all in southern Padang.
Pool/Billiard is a popular sport to play and there are a few places dotted around.
The nightlife is relatively dull because Padang is a minor city and a rather devout Muslim community. Bars are available at some hotels but don't expect alcohol.
If you can find your way down to Chinatown and get some kripik Padang (crackers, available in two flavours: spicy and sweet), that could be a good idea, too. In Chinatown, you also can explore the mixture of Minang-Chinese food.

You will see multiple Chinese tombs, walk right of 'Mushalla Nurul Ikhlas'. The stairs have much moss, which can make it more slippery if recently rained. There is a ´Selamar Datang’ (welcome) sign just before a rest area with sign ´Anak Nagari Bukit Kandang´. A bit further concrete road will be replaced by dirt road only. At the next intersection, continue straight. Pass a small blue house/shop, with possibly barking dogs. On the following inhabited house, continue on the path left of it. Ask if unsure.

More asphalt, more detour and longer but also some view of seaside and nearby islands. Dirt roads may not be very visible/maintained. Even when back on main road, it does not seem to have angkot/minibus back (or partial 402). Longer path (asphalt until main road, cut back smaller concrete road before Masjid Jabaldiin – about 2h. Free. (updated Apr 2024)
Surfing[edit]
Pantai Air Manis (Sweet Water Beach) This a very good surf spot fort beginners with a beach break and not to big waves. It is working during low season, too, but waves can be inconsistent. A few options for renting surfboards along the beach. Price around Rp 50,000/per board/per day. Direction: Angkot from the market to the beach, fare Rp 5000, last trip at 17:00.
Buy[edit]
There are a lot of stores on the side of the road, much like anywhere else in Indonesia. There are two malls, Minang Plaza, which is smaller and better for your more supermarket and basic clothing needs. There is a bit of Western Food at Plaza Andalas in the form of Papa Ron's Pizza.
Shopping at Andalas is a little bit better, but at this point in time, the malls are more downscale, mainly local products and local shops. No big retailers here. Brand names aren't really easy to find. You could find a few surfing items at Andalas plaza - but that's about it.
There is a Gramedia across the road from Andalas Plaza also.

Eat[edit]
Padang is famed throughout Indonesia for spicy Padang food (masakan Padang). Ordering at a Padang restaurant couldn't be easier: just sit down at a table, and watch the dishes pile up. Eat what you like, as you'll only pay for dishes you've actually consumed. Famous dishes include:

Beef Rendang, spicy curried beef cooked until the sauce is dry.
Soto Padang, crispy beef in spicy clear soup.
Ayam Pop, chicken that has been boiled in coconut juice and then fried for a short time.
Sate Padang, beef satay in curry sauce, served with ketupat (Indonesian rice cakes).
Padang dishes can use rather unusual ingredients though, including internal organs like hearts, lungs and even brains. One notable dish is Gulai Tambusu, which consists of cooked egg wrapped in cow intestines and served with a curry. All Padang/Minang dishes are Halal due to the Islamic roots of Minang people.

Drink[edit]
The only real bars you will find are at the major hotels. This is a very Islamic community and therefore the influence of alcohol is minimal. That being said, beer is for sale at the major supermarkets. Bintang is about all you will find. If you are feeling game, the traditional market could be something you might want to visit, as hard liquor such as Johnny Walker may be available there.
Hard liquor is also available at several warungs (small shops on the side of the road) and it is quite easy to obtain cheap vodka, whisky or rum. The going rate for a 250-ml bottle of spirits is Rp 23,000.
