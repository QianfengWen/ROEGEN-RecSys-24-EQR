Morden is a town of about 8600 people  (2016) in Central Manitoba. It is home to the Canadian Fossil Discovery Centre. Along with the neighbouring community of Winkler, it is the centre of a richly productive agricultural area, and home to a large Mennonite community.


Understand[edit]
Since the Morden area experiences some of the warmest temperatures in Manitoba, it has become a centre for agricultural and horticultural research. Since 1915, the city has been home to the Morden Research and Development Centre, which is operated by the Government of Canada. It is a filming location for the 2020 Amazon Prime television series Tales from the Loop.

History[edit]
Morden was founded in 1882, when the Canadian Pacific Railway built a railway line crossing the Dead Horse Creek. This spot became a popular resting place as it was ideal to provide water for drinking and locomotives. The settlement was named "Morden", after Alvey Morden, on whose family's land the community was established.

Climate[edit]
Morden has hot summers and cold winters. The average high in July is 25.6 °C (78.1 °F) and the average low is 14.3 °C (57.7 °F).
