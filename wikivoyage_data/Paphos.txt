Paphos (Greek: Πάφος, also Pafos; Turkish: Baf) is a town at the southwestern tip of Cyprus, between the coast and the Troodos Mountains. The city is inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.


Understand[edit]
The Odeon
Paphos is renowned as the birthplace of Greek goddess Aphrodite. Modern-day Paphos is divided in two, with the upper section up the hill being the commercial center, and lower Kato Paphos containing the main archaeological points of interest, as well as most hotels and tavernas.
The local government has improved the lower Kato Paphos area which combines hotels, bars and restaurants along a coastal strip a few km long. There is a front leading round to the marina and a long coastal path with amazing views - perfect for a morning or evening stroll.
Paphos was the European Capital of Culture for 2017, together with Aarhus in Denmark.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
34.71833332.4851 Paphos Airport (PFO  IATA). The small airport serves mostly charter flights. Flights to Paphos are widely available from charter flight companies from many of the UK's regional airports, from Exeter in the South-west to Glasgow and Edinburgh in the North. Many tour operators fly regularly. Flights to Paphos are also available using the scheduled services from British Airways. This can be one busy airport, particularly departures on Wednesdays. The airport is relatively small and can have 6 or 7 flights taking off around the same time, it can get crowded. Once you have managed to check in and make your way into the departure lounge, you will need to keep your eyes and ears open to listen to the rather 'muted' announcements. If the thought of a busy Paphos airport puts you off then why not head off to Larnaca — and have the same problems on a bigger scale — really though the problems appear no worse than any other airport in the world on a busy day! A highway connects to Limassol (68 km) and from there onward to the rest of Cyprus, and shared taxis (€5-10) run reasonably often. Ryanair also has flights to Paphos from many European airports, for example Budapest, Thessaloniki, and Kaunas.   
Get around[edit]

Paphos town is small enough to navigate on foot however the travelling around the region of Paphos will require motorised assistance! Local bus services are available however hiring a vehicle (bike, quad, car) is common place and allows for going off the beaten track to find small villages in the hills. It gets hot and humid in summer (33 °C and 90% humidity) from between late June through to early September. The rest of the year is relatively mild, with colder spells in January & February.
Karavella Bus Station open. There is no need to head to the Municipal Market bus station if the Paphos website bus site states that a bus route starts at Karavella.

The larger tombs in this "complex" are awesome, carved out of solid rock and with a view for the inhabitants that would make anyone among the living jealous!   (updated May 2017)

Home to 530 plant species, a third of the total for Cyprus, 126 of which are endemic to Cyprus. It remains largely unspoilt to date mainly thanks to its inaccessibility.
