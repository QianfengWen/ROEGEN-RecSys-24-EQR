Understand[edit]
Map of Schleswig

One of the northernmost cities in Germany, Schleswig was part of the Duchy of Schleswig that was ruled by the Danish king until the 1864 German-Danish war in which Prussia and Austria defeated Denmark, annexing Schleswig and Holstein. A dispute over the administration of those two territories would trigger the 1866 Prussian-Austrian war and in 1870/71 Prussia would lead the German states (sans Austria) into a war against France leading to the first unified German state under Prussian leadership.
