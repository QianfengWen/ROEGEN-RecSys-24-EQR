Perched on the eastern coast of the Qatari peninsula, Al-Khor (alternatively, Al Khawr; Arabic: الخور) is a major settlement just north of Doha. The city is far older than Doha, but much smaller (the population is roughly 31,000). It used to be the center of the now non-existent pearl trading industry, so now the city is undergoing renovation.


Get in[edit]
25°37′22″N 51°29′18″EMap of Al Khor
The Route 102 and 102x buses (timetable) towards Al Thakhira and Al Khor Community respectively service the town. Both depart from Al Ghanim Bus Station in Doha, with a bus every half an hour or so. The 102 has an hour and a half journey time, while the 102x will save you about 15 minutes. There are different timetables for Saturday-Thursday and Fridays. Be aware that buses can be affected by service changes and disruptions, so it is recommended you call Mowasalat to confirm first on +974 4458 8888.
Al-Khor is about 50 kilometres north of Doha, reached by either Al Shamal Road (Q1) to Al Ruwais, or by the Al Khor Coastal Road (Q1A), passing by the Doha Moto GP racetrack, Lusail City and the Pearl Qatar. The trip should take 45 minutes.
