Louiseville is a municipality of the Maskinongé Regional county municipality (MRC), in Mauricie, in Quebec, in Canada.
Every spring and fall, hundreds of thousands of migratory birds stop off by landing on Lac Saint-Pierre (and its tributaries) and on the surrounding land, many of which are flooded during the snowmelt period.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
In the fall of 1665, Charles Du Jay, Vicomte de Manereuil, settled in the company of soldiers and officers of the Carignan-Salières Regiment at the mouth of the large Rivière du Loup, on the north shore of Lac Saint-Rock. Some of these soldiers decide to settle permanently in the territory of the Seigneurie de la Rivière du Loup.
In 1721, the Parish of Saint-Antoine-de-la-Rivière-du-Loup was incorporated. The village grew slowly, thanks to the construction of Chemin du Roy on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River. It was later named the Town of Louiseville, in honour of Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll (1848-1939), who was the sixth of Queen Victoria's children and wife of the Governor General of Canada.
The Ferron family name includes several personalities from Louiseville: Jacques (1921-1985), doctor, writer, journalist and politician; Madeleine (1922-2010), writer and Marcelle (1924-2001), artist. Municipal authorities designated a street in honor of Marcelle Ferron.

Geography[edit]
Located on the edge of the north shore of Lake Saint-Pierre, the village of Louiseville is crossed by the course of the Petite rivière du Loup and the rivière du Loup. The village is also crossed by the Quebec-Gatineau rail section.

Economy[edit]
A riparian municipality of Lac Saint-Pierre, Louiseville's economy is based on agriculture, commerce, industry, public or parapublic services (e.g., schools, municipality, MRC office, retirement homes) and recreational tourism activities (vacation, swimming, hunting, fishing, boating, marinas). Throughout its history, recreational, commercial and fishing boating has been an economic vector. Boating is possible on the Loup river. The area bordering the Rivière du Loup is densified by vacationing and permanent residences. And each side of the river has an access road to serve residents.
Throughout history, industrial development has been significant in Louiseville and Saint-Antoine-de-la-Rivière-du-Loup, in particular through the establishment of the Empire Shirt which still operates.
