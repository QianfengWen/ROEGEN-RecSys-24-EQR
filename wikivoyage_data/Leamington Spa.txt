Royal Leamington Spa (or Leamington Spa or simply Leamington) is a spa town of 51,000 people (2021) in the West Midlands region of England, close to the cities of Coventry and Birmingham.


Understand[edit]
Leamington Spa is an attractive spa town notable for its fine Regency architecture and parks. Like Bath and Cheltenham, Leamington owes much of its grandeur to its development as a fashionable resort in the early 19th century, catering for those who believed its spring waters could cure or ease their ailments.
Leamington was laid out as a new town in the early to mid-19th century, with features characteristic of modern planned towns including wide streets based predominantly on a north/south aligned grid.  It was built on the site of a much smaller and older village called Leamington Priors, from which 2 buildings remain, just east of the parish church.
Modern Leamington serves primarily as a commuter town for Coventry and Birmingham, with its population boosted during term time by students from the nearby University of Warwick.
