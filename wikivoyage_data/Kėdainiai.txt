Kėdainiai  is a city in the Aukštaitija region of Lithuania, with a population of 23,447 in 2023. It's almost dead centre of the country, and a monument a few km west of town marks the exact geographical centre. Much of it is modern and industrial, with the huge Lifosa chemical works nearby, but the reason to visit is the attractive 17th century Old Town.


Understand[edit]
If you're a bulk purchaser of sulphuric acid or phosphate-based fertiliser then you've come to the right place. Lifosa chemical complex 3 km southeast makes exactly what you seek, and employs almost a thousand in the town. The tourist draw is Old Town, but the reason it's there is because of trade and industry, equally grubby in bygone centuries. For example the town attracted many Scottish business folk and settlers in the 17th century, and had a large Jewish population (skilled, amongst other trades, in dye-stuffs for fabrics) encouraged to settle in "The Pale" in Tsarist times. This means that Kėdainiai has a multicultural history, and one of the best-preserved Old Towns in Lithuania outside of Vilnius. It's also easy to reach, within an hour's travel from Kaunas.

55.286623.97792 St Joseph's Church (Šv Juozapo bažnyčia) on Radvilų gatvė is the most attractive church in town, a wooden structure originally part of a Jesuit mission house. It had spells of disuse or misuse, as a barracks under the Tsars and an equipment store under the Soviets, but is again a Jesuit church.
Didžioji gatvė is the heart of Old Town, running from Transfiguration Church west past the museum to Great (or New) Market Square. Once you get past the modern supermarket it's lined with traditional architecture.

On Old Market Square, this was completed in 1857 as the "winter synagogue" - smaller and thus more practical to heat than the Great Synagogue adjacent.

Kėdainiai minaret is west side of the railway station - you can amble to it across the tracks from the platform. It's 25 m tall in Ottoman style, free-standing and entirely decorative, with no associated mosque or even a single worshipper. It was built by General Eduard Totleben (1818-84) to commemorate his days as military engineer in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877/78, which broke Ottomans control of Bulgaria. One plaque on its wall is in Ottoman Turkish, the other quotes the Koran in Arabic, sura Al-Baqara, verse 255 the "Throne Verse".
55.330123.90567 Geographical Centre of Lithuania is the claim of a monument on the lane to Ruoščiai off Route 144. It's set in flat open fields of the North European Plain that could be anywhere from France to Russia, so it's good to have this reassurance that you are in fact in Lithuania.
55.332124.02128 Apytalaukis Dvaras is a derelict 19th century mansion off Route 2008 four km north of town. It has a grand exterior, but the interior is utterly trashed and the whole thing may collapse at any moment.
Šateniai (Polish: Szetejnie) is a tiny village 13 km north of Kėdainiai on Route 2008 east of the river - no access from Route 195 on the west bank. It was the early home of Polish writer Czeslaw Milosz (1911-2004), awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1980. His mansion has burned down, with only the granary surviving, which has been turned into a cultural centre. You need prior arrangements to view the exhibition of his work.
