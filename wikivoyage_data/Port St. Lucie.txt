Port St. Lucie is a sprawling tropical city on the Treasure Coast of Florida. The population is 202,000 and 438,000 in its metropolitan area (2019). Residents refer to the city by its initials, PSL. The spring training home of the New York Mets, this city has many fun activities if you know where to look; the new downtown area is in its infancy, but once complete will bring more activities for residents and visitors.


Understand[edit]
Overview[edit]
PGA Village, in St. Lucie West
Port St. Lucie is the largest city on a region known as the Treasure Coast, an area consisting of almost 600,000 people. Port St. Lucie is a coastal city on the Indian River Lagoon with many fun activities if you look around, like baseball, parks, bowling, and golf. With developments for a downtown area going into effect along US-1, PSL is modernizing one step at a time, though it maintains a suburban feel. It blossomed from a town of only 500 people in its first census in 1970 to a boom-town of 170,000 by 2010. Downtown is in its infancy of development, but plans have been revealed to build on the empty blocks surrounding the Civic Center.
A very special thing about Port St. Lucie is that it is the spring training home of the New York Mets; in First Data Field, the Mets play baseball against their Major League foes, like the Yankees and the Red Sox. The season normally lasts from January or February to late March to early April, when their minor league affiliates, the St. Lucie Mets, play in that very stadium.
The location of Port St. Lucie is roughly halfway between Orlando and West Palm Beach on the Turnpike, and halfway between WPB and Melbourne on the Space Coast on Interstate 95.

Get around[edit]
Map of Port St. Lucie
By car[edit]
Car is the easiest, if not only, way to get around Port St. Lucie. PSL is a relatively large city by area, so driving is the best option to get around. PSL stretches to all the way past I-95 to an in-city town called Tradition. The highways listed are also used to get around Port St. Lucie with ease, mostly US-1 and I-95; the Turnpike is rarely used due to it being a toll road, but it is used to avoid traffic and as a way to reach central Florida. There are no one-way streets in PSL, except for divided highways. There are only 4 major east-west routes throughout the city; including Crosstown Parkway, a six-lane thoroughfare that runs from US 1 to Interstate 95,  which opened in 2019. At the intersection with Floresta Drive, there is a superstreet intersection that is considered to be an eyesore and a hindrance to navigation for those traveling on Floresta, so exercise caution in this area and follow all road signs.

Stay safe[edit]
Driving -- Florida has "no fault" auto accident laws, which means you are responsible for up to $10,000 in damage to your car, even if you are not responsible for the accident.  Make sure your rental car comes with collision insurance, or obtain separate insurance.  Florida also has a very high rate of auto fatalities, so take extra care on the roads. A lot of drivers in PSL can be very reckless at times and the amount of traffic is high for a city of its size.
Crime -- There is not much crime to worry about in Port St. Lucie depending on where you want to be. The safest areas tend to border I-95, the St. Lucie Inlet, and the St. Lucie River, as well as the St. Lucie West neighborhood. You may want to avoid staying in the Prima Vista Blvd area as well as the Lennard Road area; however, there are very few hotels in those areas.
Weather -- Here are the most common weather factors to look out for in Port St. Lucie:
Heat -- Most people are already aware that South Florida tends to get extremely hot during the summer months, so it would be best to stay hydrated and not leave anyone in the car. Even with the window cracked open for those in the car, it's not a smart idea; the internal temperature of a car can reach a maximum of over 100°F or 38°C, so make sure everyone is out of the car before locking. If one must be left in the car, leave the air conditioning on as a precautionary measure.
Hurricanes, tropical storms, and tornadoes are another thing to look out for during the summer. They may not be common, but you'll never know when the next will strike; it would be best to prepare for the worst in any part of Port St. Lucie because hurricanes are just as powerful on the land as they are on the water.
Lightning is a very common weather phenomenon in Florida; in fact, South Florida is considered the Lightning Capital of America, especially Tampa. If you're caught outside and hear the crackling, find shelter immediately, be it indoors or under a pavilion; if you're in the water, get out because water conducts electricity extremely well.
Cope[edit]
Port St. Lucie has a lot to help you get through your stay, including many grocery stores spread throughout the city, as well as clothing stores, a local paper, many churches, and three libraries in the city limits.

Newspapers[edit]
The St. Lucie News Tribune is the local paper, giving residents and visitors the news at local, national, and international levels, and it is available by subscription and able to be bought at the local Publix, Winn-Dixie, or many of the local grocery stores. They're even available in newspaper boxes near local businesses. USA Today and other national newspapers are also available in bigger stores.

Radio stations[edit]
There are lots of radio stations in the PSL area, playing various genres of music. The radio stations within the area include:
