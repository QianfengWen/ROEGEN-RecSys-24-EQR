When sections of North Brunswick and Monroe split away in 1860, East Brunswick was formed. It was a quiet, sleepy town until a century later when it became a bedroom community for commuters.

Get around[edit]
Map of East Brunswick
By bicycle[edit]
East Brunswick is somewhat friendly to bicycles. There are areas with bike lanes (which you probably will never get to see, due to rarity), however you will almost always be sharing the roads with cars.

By bus[edit]
Despite being a suburban town, it is possible, albeit somewhat inconvenient, to travel by NJ Transit bus (lines 811, 815, 818). There are stops centrally located in key areas (residential, retail, public), but you still may need to walk a distance.

By car[edit]
As a suburban town that lacks much public or mass transit, cars are the best way to get around East Brunswick. Virtually every part of East Brunswick is readily accessible by car.

By foot[edit]
Although spread out in traditional suburban style, it is possible to walk around East Brunswick. This is particularly true on Route 18, where hotels are located. Nonetheless, walking can also be very dangerous because almost all main roads are county or state highways with high speed limits. Fatalities while crossing these highways do happen.

By horse[edit]
In certain (more rural) parts of East Brunswick, locals occasionally travel by horse.
