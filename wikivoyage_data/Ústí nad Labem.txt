Ústí nad Labem is the second largest city in North Bohemia and main city of Ústí nad Labem Region. This industrial city may not be one of the prettiest cities in the Czech Republic, but it is a good starting point for hiking and trips in attractive countryside.


Understand[edit]
Ústí nad Labem is situated along the banks of the Elbe, just 20 kilometers from the Czech-German border. In fact the "nad Labem" part of its name is Czech for "on the Elbe". The "Usti" means the river mouth. Its former German name Aussig is still sometimes used by Germans but may not necessarily be understood by Czechs. With a population of more than 90,000, Ústí nad Labem is the seventh most populous city in the Czech Republic.
