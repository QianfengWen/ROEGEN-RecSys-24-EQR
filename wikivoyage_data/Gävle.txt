Gävle is a port on the Baltic Sea in Gävleborg County, the southernmost part of Norrland. In 2020 the city had a population of 79,004. 
Another 20,000 live in associated small towns. Those you might visit include Valbo for the Mackmyra whisky distillery and large shopping mall, Forsbacka for its 16th century ironworks, Bergby for its old church at Hamrånge, and Furuvik for the amusement park and zoo.


Understand[edit]
The Gävle Goat
Gävle town is first documented in 1413 and received its charter in 1446, as Norrland's first and only city during the Middle Ages. Its harbour was first a fishing port, then an industrial dock and so remains; it's not a ferry port. The fortress resisted a Russian invasion in 1719, and Gävle has been spared combat since, with an army base just in case. But its wooden houses burned merrily enough without foreign assault, and after the last great fire in 1869 the area north of the river was re-built in stone on a grid pattern. South side was relatively spared so this is where you find the oldest part of town.
The countryside around Gävle, like much of Sweden, lies upon the Baltic Shield of gneiss and granite one or two billion years old. This is rich in metals, mined and crafted since antiquity, and hereabouts the main ore is of iron, while Falun further west has copper. A series of small foundry villages grew up using water power to work the furnace bellows and forges. Rivers descended from the Shield uplands (which are still rising, in post-glacial rebound) in fors - rapids and waterfalls, literally the force behind the ironworks. Early foundries had timber for fuel, but to make steel in any quantity you need coal for coking, which Sweden lacks. 19th century shipping and railways enabled bulk import of coal so the local steel industry then grew. But at the same time agriculture was shedding labour, and a series of bad harvests and political oppression drove many to emigrate. And the dozens of little foundries were inefficient, closing down in the 20th century as steel production was centralised elsewhere, and birch woods grew over their sites.

By plane[edit]
Stockholm-Arlanda Airport (ARN IATA) is the nearest international airport, with extensive global connections. It's 130 km south of Gävle and there's no need to travel via central Stockholm. Instead, take a bus or train towards Uppsala:

by bus, take UL bus 801 from the bus station beneath Terminal 5. This takes 25 mins to Uppsala and runs twice an hour, 03:00 to 00:00. Change there for bus or train to Gävle.
by train, take the SL commuter train (pendeltåg) from Arlanda Central station within the Sky City complex (not from Arlanda South or North - these only have expresses to Stockholm city). Trains take 18 minutes to Uppsala Central and run every 30-60 min between 05:00 and 01:00; some of them continue north to Gävle.
By train[edit]
Direct trains run hourly from Stockholm Central to Gävle, taking 80 min via Arlanda Central (the airport), Uppsala and Tierp. (Beware, if you buy a cheap ticket to or from Stockholm but get off at the airport, you'll be surcharged.) Trains continue north every couple of hours to Sundsvall (2 hr 15 min), Umeå and Luleå, including the Norrland sleeper trains. Direct trains also run from Linköping, Norrköping and Östersund. Regional trains run hourly from Borlänge in Dalarna region via Falun, Hofors, Storvik and Sandviken; some of them start from Örebro. 
60.675817.15081 Gävle Central station. The station is in city centre. It has five cafes, with more in nearby streets. There are ticket machines (but no staffed kiosk) in the station building and in the underpass to the platforms, and left-luggage lockers. Use IATA code QYU  IATA for booking "flights" through Arlanda Airport. Exit the station west for local taxis and buses and city centre, exit east for out-of-town taxis and buses including rail replacements.   (updated Nov 2022)
Furuvik is a platform halt for the hourly regional train (Upptåget) between Gävle and Uppsala. Use this for Furuvik Park, the zoo and theme park, see "Do". The ride from town centre takes 8 min.

By bus[edit]
Buses from Stockholm City Terminal take just over two hours and a single ticket in 2022 is 220 kr. Ybuss run 2 or 3 times a day from Stockholm via the airport and Uppsala, and call at Gävle Bro the service area on E4 at the west edge of town. They're heading for northern cities such as Sundsvall. You can also buy tickets via the Flixbus website.
Merresor (formerly SGS Bussen) run Th-Su in the morning from Sandviken via Valbo and Gävle to Stockholm and starts back around 17:00.
Tapanis Buss runs from Stockholm via Gävle Bro to Sundsvall, Luleå and Haparanda / Tornio on the border with Finland.

By road[edit]
Major routes through Gävle are E4 south to Stockholm and north to Sundsvall, E16 west to Falun and eventually Oslo, and R76 south along the coast.

See[edit]
Gävle old town
60.674117.14511 Rådhustorget is the main square of the modern town, laid out on a grid north of the river. It has several interesting old buildings including the Rådhus (town hall) for which it's named, but most are bland 20th century.
 Castle Square (Slottstorget). The extension of Rådhustorget across the river. This is where the Gävle Goat (Gävlebocken) is erected each year four weeks before Christmas, a large straw goat. The tradition began in 1966, as did the tedious tradition of burning or otherwise destroying it, in spite of fire-proofing, security guards and camera surveillance. Only a third of goats have lasted until Christmas and several have perished within hours of assembly. Since 1986 there have been Goat Wars between rival structures, one built by a school and the other by local business; they've yet to hit on the solution of decoy goats. 
Gamla Gefle, Gävle's old town, remains only as a few blocks south of the river. The Joe Hill and Prison Museums are here.
60.67222217.1441672 Gävle Castle (Gävle slott) (West side of Slottstorget and just east of the Prison Museum). The foundations are from the 16th century, but it has been rebuilt several times, last during the late 1740s when it was transformed into more of a fine mansion than castle. It now houses local government offices so you can only admire the exterior and courtyard.   (updated Dec 2022)
60.671417.14283 Swedish Prison Museum (Sveriges Fängelsemuseum), Hamiltongatan 1-3, ☏ +46 26 65 4430. W-Sa 12:00-16:00. This occupies two buildings: you start in the main block, the two-storey former jail in the classic 19th century high-hall pattern. Then the Länscellfängelset on nearby Timmermansgatan depicts its 18th-century predecessor, a dark squalid lock-up of low-lifes, dirty straw and droll rats. Adult 80 kr, concession 40 kr, child 30 kr. (updated Nov 2022)
60.673817.154 Regional Art & History Museum (Länsmuseet Gävleborg), Södra Strandgatan 20 (south bank of river, facing the police station), ☏ +46 26 655 635, lansmuseetgavleborg@xlm.se. Tu-F 11:00-18:00, Sa Su 12:00-16:00. The county museum and art gallery has a large and interesting collection; child-friendly. The building was financed in 1933 by a tobacco and shipping magnate. Free. (updated Nov 2022)
60.672217.14995 Joe Hill Museum, Nedre Bergsgatan 28. Sa 12:00-16:00. This was the birthplace in 1879 of Joel Emmanuel Hägglund, better known as Joe Hill. In 1902 he emigrated to the USA, where he became a labor organizer, song-writer and activist for "Industrial Workers of the World", the "Wobblies". In 1914 a Salt Lake City grocer and his son were shot dead by two intruders; Joe Hill came to a local doctor that evening with a gunshot wound to his chest. He was eventually convicted of the murder, and executed by firing squad in Nov 1915. The prosecution case was shaky and his many supporters believed he was shot for being a "wobbly", but his refusal to explain his wound sealed his fate. Free. (updated Nov 2022)
Rådhus and main square
60.672717.13816 Holy Trinity Church (Heliga Trefaldighets kyrka) on Kyrkogatan was opened in 1654 after its predecessor burnt down. It contains the 11th century Sörby rune stone, dedicated to a warrior chief called Egil.
60.661717.17097 Swedish Railway Museum (Järnvägsmuseet), Rälsgatan 1, ☏ +46 26 445 1460, jarnvagsmuseet@smtm.se. Closed until June 2024.

It's closed for renovation, as is its annex train shed north side of town, and heritage train trips are suspended. (updated Nov 2022)
Further out[edit]
60.6891917.1721438 Testeboån delta is a wetland and deciduous forest nature reserve at the foot of the Testeboån river as it flows into the harbour. Access is free 24 hours via Hamnleden onto Gestrins väg. You can also reach it by the footpath on the railway bridge across the bay, though the view is mostly of industrial docklands. Not to be confused with Testeboån Nature Reserve (below) which starts 15 km upriver.
60.71517.269 Brädviken along the road to Bönan has a bathing beach and walking trails through the woods.
60.73917.3110 Bönan is a small fishing village and collection of summer chalets. The coast is mostly rocky but there's a small sandy cove. The former lighthouse, a wooden tower, is now the base for the channel pilots. The village has a cafe and a campsite open in summer. Bus 95 runs from Gävle via Brädviken every couple of hours.
60.754417.055911 Testeboån Nature Reserve covers the upper course of Testeboån river and is easiest accessed from the car park along Oslättforsvägen, as marked. (No access from the nearby E4.) You could also access from its source at Oslättfors. Glaciers dumped a moraine of gravel across the valley so the river splits into multiple channels, with wetland and deciduous forest. Further down the terrain becomes steeper so the river cascades. The reserve is free to access 24 hours.
Holy Trinity Church
60.77101716.9694512 Oslättfors is a woodland village by the lake at the source of Testeboån river, with access to the reserve. From 1796 there was an ironworks (bruk) here, making nails and other forged products. A few buildings of that era remain: the church (24 hours), the utility office, a coal depot and metalsmiths' houses. In 1880 the works were replaced by a timber industry, still in business. The mansion house, school and railway buildings are gone, and there isn't a museum. You can bathe or kayak in the lake.
60.61221716.90393313 Forsbacka ironworks (Forsbacka bruk). There have been ironworks in Forsbacka since medieval times but the present structures are mostly late 19th redbrick. They occasionally have guided tours but you're generally free to stroll around. The foundry master's mansion is now an events venue.  (updated Nov 2022)
60.92705617.03891714 Hamrånge is a hamlet straggling north of Bergby by the E4. Its main attraction is the church of 1854: it's oriented north-south. The font and two crucifixes are from its medieval predecessor. 500 m north, Hamrånge Hembygdsförening calls itself a "heritage village", but it's not a skansen outdoor museum. Set up in 1931, it's a sort-of events venue but unsure of what it wants to be. 2 km south of the village, Julhuset I Hamrånge is a Christmas lights display.
61.04717.1496515 Axmar ironworks, active 1671-1927, were 5 km north of Axmarby village on the north boundary of the county. These have been landscaped into a park dotted with old buildings that you're free to stroll around, but there isn't a museum. The castle was demolished in 1970.

Stay safe[edit]
Sightseeing at Furuvik Park
While Gävle is generally a safe city, main risk factors are petty theft and nightlife brawls. As in most of Sweden, cold weather can bring dangers including those of winter driving. Animal collisions are a risk factor; in particular moose, deer and boar.
Although it has become somewhat of a longstanding tradition for arsonists to try to burn down the Gävle goat, which more often than not does not survive the winter, keep in mind that this is still illegal, and you will be pressed with criminal charges if caught.

Connect[edit]
As of Nov 2022, Gävle has 5G from Tele2, Telia Mobile (the best coverage) and Telenor, and 4G from Tre Mobile. Wifi is widely available in public places.
