Understand[edit]
The heart of Ikorodu City
Ikorodu’s location being in Lagos has contributed to its status as the fastest-growing hub inside the Lagos metropolis. There is a steady influx of people from surrounding towns, villages, and the neighboring Ogun state.
Before the Ikorodu division was created and later upgraded to a city, Ikorodu had existed since the 17th century. It derived its name from the inhabitants who were farmers, from the plants they notably grew. "Ikorodu" was derived from a Yoruba root word, oko-odu, meaning the farm (oko) of (odu), a kind of plant. The word odu means a darkening agent. When discovered that the plant had darkening power, it was used as a dye - the name odu was applied to it.
The Imota district is predominantly known as an Ijebu-speaking area, as the major language spoken in Imota is the Ijebu dialect of the Yoruba language. Imota was derived from the contraction "Imu-Ota" meaning "Near the Ota tree".
