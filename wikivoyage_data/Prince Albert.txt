Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, is a city on the North Saskatchewan River. It is the largest Northern Saskatchewan city, and third in population and size in the province after Regina and Saskatoon.
Prince Albert is a hub of multiculturalism, travellers, and naturists. There are numerous campgrounds nearby, especially in Prince Albert National Park, which is home to an exceptionally adventurous and scenic hike to Grey Owl's Cabin, and Waskesiu Lake, a particularly charming summer resort to visit as well.
