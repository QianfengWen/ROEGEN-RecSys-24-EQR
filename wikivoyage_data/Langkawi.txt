Langkawi (Jawi: لانكاوي), officially known as "Langkawi, the Jewel of Kedah" (Malay: Langkawi Permata Kedah) is an archipelago of 99 islands (an extra 5 temporary islands are revealed at low tide) in the Andaman Sea, 30 km off the mainland coast of Kedah. It is a popular destination due to its natural white sand beaches, lush jungle foliage, craggy mountain peaks and duty-free status, where alcohol is affordable. 


Understand[edit]
Politics and demographics[edit]
The islands are a part of the state of Kedah, adjacent to the border with Thailand. The total population of the islands is 99,000; however only two islands are inhabited: Pulau Langkawi, the largest island, with a population of 65,000 and Pulau Tuba. Langkawi is also an administrative district, with the town of Kuah as the capital and largest town. 

Etymology[edit]




Legends of broken pots and seeping gravy
Langkawi's most prominent mountains, Gunung Macinchang and Gunung Raya, and a whole series of towns and villages are said to be named after a local legend. During the wedding feast of the marriage of giant Mat Raya's son and giant Mat Cincang's daughter, a fight broke out between the two wedding parties, reputedly because the son was caught flirting with another woman. Pots and pans were thrown, and a large pot of gravy (kuah) was broken and the contents flowed onto the ground. The place where the gravy was spilled became known as Kuah (the largest town on Langkawi island) and where the crockery (belanga) was broken (pecah) was the location of the village Kampung Belanga Pecah. The gravy seeped into (kisap) the earth at the village named Kisap.


The name "Langkawi" has two possible origins. First, it is believed to be related to the kingdom of Langkasuka, itself a version of the Malay negari alang-kah suka ("the land of all one's wishes"), centered in modern-day Kedah. The historical record is sparse, but a Chinese Liang Dynasty record (c. 500 AD) refers to the kingdom of "Langgasu" as being founded in the 1st century AD. Second, it could be a combination of the Malay words 'helang', meaning "eagle" and 'kawi', meaning "reddish-brown" or "strong", in old Malay.

History[edit]
Langkawi was long under the influence of the Kedah Sultanate, founded in 1136 AD upon the introduction of Islam. Kedah, including Langkawi, was conquered in 1821 by the State of Siam (now Thailand). During the invasion by the Siamese, the leaders were killed, many islanders were taken as slaves, and most of the population fled. In the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909, the Siamese ceded control of the island to the British, who held the state until Malaysian independence in 1957, except for a brief period of Thai rule under the Japanese occupation of Malaya during World War II. Thai influences remain visible in the culture and food of Langkawi.
Langkawi remained a sleepy backwater island until 1987, when the island was granted tax-free status with the intention of promoting tourism to improve the lives of the islanders.

Climate[edit]
Sheltered by the mountainous backbone of Peninsular Malaysia, Langkawi is not affected by the northeastern winter monsoon and enjoys sunny skies in winter when the eastern provinces are flooded.

Preservation[edit]
The 10,000 hectares of Langkawi and its 99 islands were declared a geopark by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) in 2007.

There are direct flights to Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Penang, and Johor Bahru. There are no air-bridges, so in the event of rain, the airline will supply umbrellas for the walk to the plane.   
By boat[edit]
Langkawi Ferry Services operates fast air-con boats from Kuala Perlis (RM18, 75 min), Kuala Kedah (RM23, 105 min), Penang (RM60, 165 min) (the ferry is freezing cold, so bring warm clothes), and Satun (RM45 or 450 Thai baht, 75 min), (Satun ferry to Langkawi: one boat departs Satun daily at 11:30AM.) Langkawi to Satun: one boat departs Langkawi daily at 8:30AM. The ferry was suspended during COVID-19 and reinstated with only one daily ferry as of November 2023.
Langkawi Ferry Line operates between Langkawi and Kuala Perlis, Kuala Kedah.
Super Fast Ferry operates between Langkawi and Penang. Still suspended in 2023 due to Covid-19.

Get around[edit]
6°22′12″N 99°46′48″EMap of Langkawi
There is effectively no public transport on the island, so your choices are to use taxis or to rent a car, motorbike/scooter, or bicycle.

By taxi[edit]
Taxis and the Grab mobile app operate on a fixed price system. A taxi from the airport to Pantai Cenang costs RM20 or less with Grab. You can buy a coupon at the taxi desk at the airport. From the ferry terminal to Pantai Cenang, the price is RM24. For those arriving at the Kuah Jetty and going into Kuah Town, the price is RM8.

By car or motorbike/scooter[edit]
Renting a car or motorbike/scooter is highly recommended due to the lack of public transport. This can be done at the airport, the port complex, or from shops on Pantai Cenang. Refrain from renting from touts, as many are operating illegally without permits and usually without insurance. Accidents happen to tourists on motorbikes/scooters regularly, so be careful although the traffic is not as chaotic as in Penang and other areas. The roads are in good condition. Most rental agencies will not provide full insurance coverage and you have to cover the damage up to RM3000 if there is any accident.
Renting an air-conditioned mid-sized sedan costs RM70-RM150 per day depending on model, condition and length of stay and a 150cc motorbike/scooter costs RM40-45 per day. Cheaper but usually very used and older are the semi-automatic 115cc bikes for RM25 a day. A tired Proton within Pantai Cenang costs RM60-90/day.
Check your fuel level regularly because petrol pump stations (gas stations) are far from one another. Most rental agencies do not care how much fuel is in the tank when the vehicle is returned, although some may do so and mark it on the receipt. Fuel costs are cheap and are fixed by the government and you should return the bikes with the same filling level as you picked it up.
The first time at a gas/petrol station will confuse you. You will need to guess how much fuel you need and pay first. Most saloon cars, if empty, are RM50 to fill up and motorbikes are approximately RM5. Sometimes you fill up your car/bike and you haven't used what you have paid for; not to worry, as you can claim this back at the counter.
Remember to drive safely and slowly on the island and on the left side of the road. There are tourists, children and animals like chickens, cows and even buffaloes crossing. Take care not to run over the beautiful snakes or monitors. Cattle and snakes like to lie on the road at night; the blacktop radiates heat.
Driving laws:

Your driver's licence needs to be with you at all times. An international driver's licence is not necessary but licences must have text in English.
Seat belts are mandatory in all vehicles. Fines are given ranging from RM50 if not wearing one.
Helmets are mandatory. Fines are the same as above but more importantly, the hospital does not have facilities to treat head injuries, so you will have to get a medivac out to Penang, which takes 45 minutes or more — if the helicopter is available.
Roadblocks are commonplace in Langkawi; they are mainly interested in locals with no licence. Make sure you have the above items and your seat belt fastened, and you will have no problems.

By bicycle[edit]
Some hotels offer bicycle rentals. Expect to pay between RM10-30 per day.

During peak times you may have to queue for up to 2 hours. At 125 m long, it is the world’s longest curved suspension bridge. Opened in 2003. The SkyBridge is at the top station of the cable car which can be reached using an elevator/cabin on a track (SkyGlide, RM15 for foreigners) or through a small forest trail (RM5 for foreigners), the trail is only around a 10-minute walk but involves a lot of stairs. The first cable car drop point (the mountain furthest east) can be walked to as well. You follow a path that takes you under the cable cars. Includes a very steep section which is spectacular both going up and coming down. Doesn't operate in bad weather. Also, it doesn't run during the regular maintenance days, check before you go. Officially you are not allowed to take food and drink on the cable car, but they seem not to be checking backpacks (when unlucky and all your water is taken by the security, you can buy one at the top). If they are not operating, or you are really into hiking, you can trek partway up the mountain through the jungle. To do this, from the parking lot at Telagah Tujuh Waterfalls go left just before the road goes really uphill and then turn left again at the water reservoir. The trek is very steep most of the way and in a pretty bad condition because the contractors laying down the piping for cables littered garbage all the way to the top. Only attempt this if you are fit and have good hiking boots. Temperatures at the top of the mountain are 4-5 ⁰C lower than at sea level.

Eat[edit]

Seafood or fish may be priced by weight or by a set price for the dish - clarify before ordering.

Budget[edit]
For a taste of simple Malay-style breakfast, just walk up to a small stall opposite the Underwater World in the mornings and feast on the famous freshly-prepared banana leaf-wrapped nasi lemak (steamed rice in coconut milk). The price is most affordable at less than RM 2 for a pack. Go local and enjoy this with a glass of hot teh tarik or really good local coffee. This very unassuming stall is just simple and great (clean too!). The nasi lemak comes with curried beef, squid in chili, fried salted fish or chicken.

 AddaMaya Café (Pantai Cenang (near Haji Ramli's; or opposite Nadia's Comfort Inn)). Small, cosy place for meals and coffee. The chef can whip up great meals - from local dishes to western fast food easily (and in that little cabin of his). It can get a bit dusty as it is located fronting the main road. Locals like to come here for good food at reasonable prices. 
 Rafi's Place (sandwiched between Restoran Aliah's and Tomato Nasi Kandar on Pantai Cenang). Rustic shack. No visible signboard either but ask around and you will find Rafi's. Rafi is a Penangite but has been on the island since 1988 so he considers himself very much local. Ask him for recommendations and he'll happily tell you. Ample parking space in front of his 'shack'. Good ambiance especially early mornings. nasi lemak (RM3), local tea and coffee (RM1). 
 Tomato Nasi Kandar (Opposite Langkawi Boutique Hotel). Typical budget Indian food establishment with patrons all day (and night!) long. Very crowded even in the wee hours of the morning. They serve an enormous variety of dishes, from the flavoured roti varieties to naan, briyani and kebabs. The standard is quite high - to an extent where the meal is extremely value-for-money. The only problem is that their waiters are exceedingly bad at taking orders. RM1-3 for roti, RM 4-10 for main dishes. 
6.32720199.7826911 Restoran Fatimah (near the Kampung Tok Senik Resort on the road to Ulu Melaka). Try this for really authentic Malay food. Their lunch spread is amazing - so amazing that they attract bus loads of Malaysian visitors. Just enjoy the food and leave your cultural baggage and complaints behind as you will be in a totally different ambience but friendly, nevertheless.  
 Restoran Almaz, northern end of Pantai Cenang (Next door to the 'Laman Padi Rice Garden' and across the road from 'Casa Del Mar'). A really nice little restaurant with Roti and Indian food that is very tasty and cheap. RM0.80-12.

 Babylon Mat Lounge & BBQ (Right on Pantai Cenang). Mats are laid out on the sand for guests to sit on and there is a low table with a candle. They also have a live band or playlist that is passed off as a DJ. In contrast to the atmosphere, the staff are quite rude compared to other places. 
 Cenang Boat Quay, Pantai Cenang. Offers a variety of pizza, German sausages, pasta, local dishes, fusion food and a grilled fish hawker. The concept here is by individual hawker selling the different styles of food. Sunset view at the Quay. 
 Champor Champur, Pantai Cenang. Moderately wacky fusion food in a fusion setting courtesy of a Dutch-Malaysian couple with an affinity for Africa. Great ambiance - feels like eating in an outdoor garden.

 Hole in the Wall Fishfarm & Restaurant, Kilim River, northeast part of the island (call for free shuttle), ☏ +60 4 9675301.

The traditional dishes of freshly caught fish, prawns, crab, lobster. are famous. Shuttle service from Kilim jetty to the fishfarm restaurant and return is free of charge for lunch and dinner guests (However, if your bill is less than RM50, you have to pay an absurd amount for the shuttle. The logical workaround here is to order the cheapest available item to make the bill RM50) If you book a Mangrove Tour, you will most definitely end up having your lunch here. However, you may want to give their package buffet a pass and try their dishes. 
 Mimi (a few minutes walk from Underwater World, on the opposite side of the road). Greatest 'ikan bakar' or grilled fish with tantalizing self-made sauce.

Drink[edit]
Because of Langkawi's tax-free status, alcohol is much cheaper than in the rest of Malaysia. Religious Muslims do not consume alcoholic drinks, and while they do tolerate non Muslims who do, try not to behave in a rowdy imbibed manner near them, their houses, mosques, and please respect local culture and communal sensitivities. For those living on a budget, you can obtain alcohol at cheap prices from the local duty-free shops: the larger the outlets, the lower the prices. Expect to pay RM35 for 1 L Absolut Vodka, RM37 for 1 L of Johnny Walker Red Label, RM45 for 1 L Kahlua, RM60 for 1 L Bailey's, and RM70 for 1 L Chivas Regal 12 years. Small cans of beer: RM2.30 for Tiger Beer 330 ml and RM1.80 for some cheap Dutch beer. Small quantities? 500 ml of some random gin per RM15.
Some of those prices can be as cheap as a half of the price of the same product on the Duty Free Shop of the International Airport at Kuala Lumpur (KLIA).
Despite low alcohol prices, Langkawi is predominantly popular with couples and families. Single travelers and backpackers may therefore be disappointed with the lack of nightlife. Most bars remain empty, particularly in the low season, and the 1-2 nightclubs may only seem worthwhile in the peak season, and even then only on Friday or Saturday nights. Overall, Langkawi provides a family-friendly alternative to Thai locations such as Phuket and Koh Samui.

Connect[edit]
Telephone[edit]
Mobile phone coverage is very good in all built up areas of Langkawi. Many affordable pre-paid phone and data plans are available. Recharge cards are readily available except for the very cheap TuneTalk which is harder to find and SIM cards almost non existent. It is best to buy this back in LLCT where no commission is charged on the SIM. Full reception and reasonable data speeds can be achieved on the beach and inside the resorts on Pantai Cenang and Pantai Tengah.

Post[edit]
The main post office in located in Kuah Town. Mini post offices can be found in Padang Mat Sirat. There is no post office in Pantai Cenang, but you can buy stamps and send postcards in T Shoppe on the main road. Courier service, Poslaju shop can be found at Taman Berlian, Kuah.

Internet[edit]
Broadband is available and some Internet cafés can be found along Pantai Tengah, Pantai Cenang and Kuah. In addition, many of the upscale hotels, resorts, and restaurants provide free WiFi.

Stay healthy[edit]
The biggest health risk on Langkawi is from jellyfish stings, especially during January - June season. Uninformed visitors are stung every day and the lifeguards on Pantai Cenang and the hospital treat more or less severe cases of jellyfish stings most days. There are several species of jellyfish in Langkawi's waters, while most will give you a nasty sting or a burn, there are some that will cause partial paralysis or even kill, in case of the lethal box jellyfish. If you have been stung badly, don't exert yourself physically as this will pump the toxins around the bloodstream and aggravate the symptoms. Vinegar is the only scientifically proven treatment for tropical jellyfish stings, apply it for 30 seconds to block toxin which has not yet been absorbed into the blood. To stay safe, swim only in stinger suit.
Langkawi can have a lot of mosquitoes depending on the time of year and location (i.e. Mangrove areas), so don't forget to use mosquito repellent. "Off" spray and various citronella or DEET based products are available in most supermarkets.
Average temperatures are hot or hotter; it's the tropics. Be sure to stay hydrated. You will need to drink about 3 litres a day and don't wait till you are thirsty to drink. Room temperature water preferably. De-hydration accounts for a large percentage of dodgy tummy holiday illnesses.

Stay safe[edit]
Speedboats can often bounce off the waves at very high speeds and passengers can get quite strong jolts into the non-sprung seats, so persons with back or neck problems should not travel on the speedboats, but on the ferry. There have been reports of serious back injuries happening on the speedboats. They are also known as 'vomit comets' due to the number of people succumbing to sea sickness. Bring lots of water and be prepared for a bumpy ride! Also be very careful while swimming. At times, tides and currents can be very aggressive and not easy to spot.
Be careful driving around Langkawi at night. Although main roads are well-lit, some of the more minor roads are not very well lit and may pass through Kampungs (traditional Malay villages) or rural areas where the locals seem to take a very casual approach to road safety. Drive slow and watch out for erratically piloted motorbikes, pedestrians and livestock. Inside Kuah Town, watch out for errors in the road arrows - they may lead you into wrong lanes or into barricades.  at night, watch out for water buffalo sleeping in the road.
Crime is generally not a problem on Langkawi, especially compared to the larger cities in Malaysia. In theory, you don't even have to lock your car, because it cannot get off the island without customs knowing about it!
Beware of smart wild monkeys. Those at Tengkorak beach attack humans who have food. If attacked, pick up stones (or just pretend to do so) and throw them at the monkeys, this will scare them away. Also, do not carry plastic bags as the monkeys associate these with food. Don't let them get too close to you or they will steal your glasses.
Please read up on rip tides before you go; learn to recognise and to avoid them.

Respect[edit]
Langkawi is a Geopark but still needs to improve its environmental friendliness. Don't participate in certain activities such as eagle feeding and monkey feeding as this harms the animals by encouraging them to become reliant on tourists and you may give them the wrong food.
