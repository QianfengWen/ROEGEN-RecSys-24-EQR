Fort Defiance was built by General "Mad" Anthony Wayne in August 1794, during the Northwest Indian War. Today a pair of cannons outside the city library on the Maumee River overlook the confluence and mark the location of Fort Defiance, along with a mounded outline of the fort walls.
Fort Winchester was built on the same spot during the War of 1812, but it was a larger fort that extended southward somewhat along the Auglaize River. Historical plaques in the sidewalks mark the full extent of Fort Winchester.
Defiance was built in 1822 around the site of the War of 1812 fort.
