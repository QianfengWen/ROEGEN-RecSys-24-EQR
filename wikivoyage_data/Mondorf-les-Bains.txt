Former border checkpoint between Luxembourg and France.
Mondorf-les-Bains or Mondorf for short, is a spa town in southeastern Luxembourg. Its facilities are among the most modern in Europe. The waters are particularly suitable for the treatment of liver, gastric and respiratory ailments. It was home to 5,100 people in 2018.


Understand[edit]
The Gander, the small stream that makes up the border between France and Luxembourg around Mondorf-les-Bains.
Mondorf was first inhabited by the Celts. The Romans, which arrived around 65 BC, built a fortification to protect the road from Metz to Trier. In the ninth century, the village was donated to the Echternach Abbey, that named it Muomendorph, which, over time, changed in to Mondorf. Mondorf was frequently burnt down and rebuilt. The Saint Michael's Church, for example. It was rebuilt on four occasions, with the last rebuilding being finished in 1764.
In the 1840s, thermal waters were uncovered when drilling for salt, which had become highly taxed under the then Dutch rule. Despite their mineral properties, the waters were not suitable for any usage, due to their brown colour caused by the rocks, rich of iron, that they were located in. Nevertheless, the Société des Bains de Mondorf (Association of the Baths of Mondorf) was set up. Immediately an architect was issued to build the thermal establishment, which was finished in June 1847. As a result of the spa's success, the village started prospering from rich French guests that came and stayed in the luxurious hotels. This tourism, however, stopped in 1871, when the Germans occupied parts of France.
Though the city implemented its number one feature, the spa, in its name in late August 1878, the spa kept on declining. This decline wouldn't stop until the state bought the facilities in 1886. Minister of State Paul Eyschen managed to revive profits by encouraging Belgians to visit. The spa facilities were expanded with a pavilion, banqueting hall, reading room, Orangerie and the first ever indoor swimming pool of Luxembourg.
After the First World War, a new spa centre was designed and was later opened in 1926. During the 1930s, the hotels by the spas weren't used by visitors, but instead by people fleeing from the Nazi German uprising. During the Second World War war, the spas were renamed Staatsbad-Mondorf, and was a place where rich Nazis could relax. After the war, in the second half of the 20th century, the spa continued to prosper with the construction of a new outdoor swimming pool (1953), new thermal centre (1988) and the new Casino 2000, opened in 1983.
