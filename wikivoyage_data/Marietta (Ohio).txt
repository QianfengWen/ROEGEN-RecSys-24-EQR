Ohio River - Marietta - 2007 Sternwheeler Festival
Marietta is a city of 13,000 people (2019) in Southeast Ohio. It is at the confluence of the Muskingum River and Ohio River. Founded in 1788 it is the oldest city in Ohio. From the beginning it was one of Ohio's more important Ohio River ports. It is adjacent to part of the Wayne National Forest.


Understand[edit]
Marietta, the county seat of Washington County, the first organized settlement of the Northwest Territory, is a small town that has maintained its small-town charm due to having been left off of the rail lines and having had no connection to a highway until 1967. Since the construction of Route 7 and the new bridge across the river, Marietta has been on a slow path to resurrection. It has grown to extend from the Ohio Riverfront to the intersection of Interstate 77. The historic downtown has gone through several renovation phases, with a streetscape program being the crowning touch. The town's name is derived from Marie Antoinette, the French Queen, who supported the American Revolution. It is now one of the Ohio Valley and Southeastern Ohio's favorite destinations.

Get in[edit]
Interstate 77 connects Marietta with central Ohio, Virginia, West Virginia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. Or by boat, at the Ohio Riverfront. It is on the State line with West Virginia. The Ohio River separates the two states. Directly across the river bridge on Ohio Route 6 is Williamstown. Parkersburg, West Virginia is a short distance south with access to I-77.
