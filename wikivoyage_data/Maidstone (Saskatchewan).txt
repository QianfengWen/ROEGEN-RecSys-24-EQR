Map of Maidstone (Saskatchewan)
Maidstone is a small town located between Lloydminster and North Battleford; the community was named after Maidstone, Kent, England.

History[edit]
In the spring of 1903, settlers began arriving in the Maidstone area, many of whom were Barr Colonists. These settlers would be followed by African American settlers from the U.S. and a significant number of Mennonites after the construction of the Canadian Northern Railway through the region in 1905. John Henry "Jack" Wesson settled in the area in 1907. He became one of Saskatchewan's foremost farm leaders and became the first president of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture in 1936 and the president of the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool in 1937.  In 1955 Maidstone officially became a town.  Oil and gas development in the 1970s created conditions for growth in the community.  The booming economy resulted in the town's population growing  from less than 700 at the beginning of the decade to over 1,000 by 1981.
African Americans from Oklahoma settled in the Eldon district near Maidstone in 1909, creating the first and only African-American farming community in the province. In 1907 Oklahoma and the Indian Territory merged to become a State.  The new government enacted segregation and laws disenfranchising African Americans. As a result, many decided to emigrate to Western Canada to take advantage of offers of free homesteads. About 10 or 12 families, led by Julius Caesar Lane and Joseph Mayes, founded the Shiloh colony in the RM of Eldon. At its height in the late 1920s, the colony boasted between 50 and 75 African American families. Today, all that remains of the Shiloh community is a log building called Shiloh Baptist Church, built in 1911 and abandoned in 1940, as well as a graveyard known as the Shiloh Baptist Cemetery located about 29 km (18 mi) northeast of Maidstone. In 1991, the church and cemetery were designated a heritage property.
