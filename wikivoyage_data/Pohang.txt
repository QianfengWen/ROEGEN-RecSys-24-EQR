See[edit]
Homigot
 POSCO at night. At night POSCO turns the multicolored lights on, and the red-and-white-striped smokestacks turns into a show of all of the colors in the fluorescent rainbow.   
 The Hands of Harmony (take bus #200 outside of the Intercity Bus Terminal; transfer buses at 구룡포 (Guryongpo) and head for 호미곶 (Homigot)). Well beyond POSCO lies a small fishing village called Homigot. While the beaches in this town are too rocky to be considered viable for swimming, there is a work of art worth seeing; The Hands of Living Mutually or Hands of Harmony. This is a massive bronze sculpture of a hand stretching up from the water in a small cove. A second bronze hand of equal proportion stretches up from dry land on the other side of Homigot Sunrise Square. The hand in the water is worth seeing, particularly at sunrise. This particular cove's claim to fame is that it is the farthest point east in Korea (also referred to as the Tiger's Tail) so the sun rises here first. This charming place is a bit of an obscure tourist trap. Amateur photographers from all over the country come to shoot pictures of the sun rising through the fingers of the hand. Some bring expensive state-of-the-art equipment whilst many will merely whip out their cellphones and start shooting. This can be a crowded shoving match over the rocks and ocean. Some will even venture waist-deep into the water, holding their cellphones high, amidst squawking seagulls, to get a better shot of the bird-soiled sculpture. New Year's Eve is presumably the best time to visit the monument as there are fireworks and festivities that run until dawn (which is shortly after 07:30). The sight is also popular in the summer months, when temperatures are more agreeable. While there are hotels within an easy walk, some opt to sleep out on the square with a friend, a sleeping bag, some mosquito spray and a couple bottles of soju. The sun rises early in the summer (shortly after 05:00 in late June). Near the sculptures are a lighthouse and museum along with numerous tourist shops, seafood restaurants, peddler tents and the likes. The local-owned tourist shops can be immensely helpful when finding a place to stay or the next bus out. There are traditional squat toilets in the public restrooms nearest The Hands. Western-style toilets can be found at the restrooms outside the lighthouse museum nearby.
