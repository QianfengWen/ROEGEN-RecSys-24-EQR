Understand[edit]
Levuka has a population of about 3000 people. The town was the capital of Fiji from 1874 until 1883 when the capital moved to Suva. Levuka was designated an historic town in 1989 and was inscribed to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2013.
Ovalau Island is a lush tropical volcanic island of about 100 km2 surrounded by large coral reefs. It is the main island of the Lomaiviti Group which is made up of the islands  of Namena, Makogai, Koro, Wakaya, Batiki, Nairai, Gau and Ovalau. The islands are the peaks of deep-sea volcanoes that became extinct millions of years ago.

Epi's midland tour is a good one.  Epi leads you up, and then down into the volcanic crater to visit a small village called Lovoni.  Ask for Epi in Levuka, he's not hard to find.
Bobo´s Farm on a riverbank surrounded by rainforest in the Rukuruku Valley on the west side of Ovalau. If you want to experience the real rural Fiji, fun, adventures and the sound of the jungle at dusk in a warm welcoming Fijian hospitality.
Silana Village Silana offers Fijian hospitality in modern comfortable bure accommodation. On the beach, 3 minutes walk from the village, but close enough to become part of the village, sharing their meals and way of life.
Caqalai Island Take a daytrip to Caqalai, a beautiful coral island run by the Methodist Church and offering simple bure accommodation. White sandy beach all around the island, with good snorkeling just a few meters offshore.
Leleuvia Island Larger but just as beautiful as Caqelai, Leleuvia offers day trips as well as great value overnight facilities. Transportation to Leleuvia is available from both Levuka and Suva.
Lost Island is on the island of Yanuca Lailai, south of Ovalau Island. Its an uninhabited 72 acres big, volcanic rock, limestone island with an amazing nature. The coastline with mangrove, volcanic rock cliffs and beaches surrounds an abounded jungle. Its totally off the main tourist track and its a hiding place to get away from the busy world and live a "Robinson Crusoe". Daytrips or bures for overnight stays.
