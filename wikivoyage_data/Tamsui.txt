The Tamsui waterfront at sunset.
Tamsui[dead link] (淡水區), or Danshui, Danshuei, Tamshui) is a district of New Taipei that was the center of shipping and commerce in northern Taiwan in the 19th century. The city is still popular with visitors from Taipei and boasts many historical attractions, and is a popular location for viewing the sunset.
The town calls itself by the English name "Tamsui" and is the only Taipei MRT station using the Taiwanese name in English announcements. The Mandarin transliteration "Danshui" was used before 2012 and is sometimes used in tourist advertisement around Taipei and in Tamsui.


Understand[edit]
Skyline of Tamsui.
Tamsui is located near the outlet of the Tamsui (Danshui) River into the Taiwan Strait. Originally home to Formosan indigenous peoples, Tamsui was next settled by the Spanish in 1629 as the town and mission of San Domingo. The Spanish were expelled by the Dutch in 1641, who built Fort Anthonio, forming what is known today as Hongmao Castle. Following the departure of the Dutch in 1661, Tamsui continued to grow, becoming the largest port in Taiwan by the 19th century. By the 20th century, accumulation of silt in the river forced most port operations to move further north to Keelung. Due to its close proximity to Taipei City, Tamsui has become a favorite destination for city dwellers to take a stroll and enjoy a coffee along the riverside.

Tamsui is most easily accessed from Taipei by taking the MRT Tamsui (Red) Line to its northern end at Tamsui Station. The ride is roughly 40 minutes from Taipei Main Station.

On foot[edit]
Most of the city Tamsui is easily accessible on foot from the MRT station. Turn left as you exit the MRT and then right along the river.

By boat[edit]
Ferries across the river to the town of Bali and the Fisherman's Wharf depart from the Tamsui Ferry Pier, about 10 minutes north of the MRT station by foot. Sightseeing boats traversing Taiwan's northeast coast and the Tamsui (Danshui) River depart from the Fisherman's Wharf.

25.170052121.4389214 Tamsui Ferry Wharf (淡水渡船碼頭). located near the north end of the waterfront area and offer ferries across the river to Bali Township, as well as Tamsui Fisherman's Wharf further north. Tickets run around NT$50 to Bali, and NT$100 to Fisherman's Wharf. When taking the ferry don't stand outside unless you enjoy getting wet! Closed in the event of bad weather. (updated Jun 2019)
By bus[edit]
The R26 bus will take you from Tamsui MRT Station to Fort San Domingo or Fisherman's Wharf. The latter is beyond casual walking distance from the MRT, so the bus is probably the best choice if you don't want to take a boat or rent a bike.

By bike[edit]
Rent a bike in one of several shops on the main road north of Tamsui MRT Station. A normal rate might be NT$300 for the whole day. Or in Bali, hire a bike to ride up and down the riverside.[1] This is very popular and cheap (From NT$30 for a small bike to NT$100 for a tandem per hour).  Make sure you look the bike over first as safety standards vary.

By tram[edit]
The Danhai LRT connects Fisherman's Wharf and MRT Hongshulin station through Danhai New Town, maybe a "light" ride after a long walk? A link extending to Bali from the wharf is planned, but construction has not started yet, so don't be fooled by brochures!
