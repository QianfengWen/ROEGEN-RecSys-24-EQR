Beach road in Dominical
Dominical is a city in South Pacific Costa Rica. The number one attraction in Dominical is the beach. There's all the amenities to help you enjoy a safe and exhilarating time. Fishing and waterfalls tie for second in area attractions. Ziplines, caves, horseback riding, yoga, massage, socializing, and hiking are as well favorites here. 


Get in[edit]
Usually people only need directions from the San José airport, SJO. There are three ways to get to Dominical, not counting the sea. The most common is from the east, via San Isidro (de General). San José is where you fly in and either bus or rent a car and head south to San Isidro. There you can buy some groceries at reasonable prices and head west (just ask for Dominical). This entire route takes you through cloud forests, mountain ridges, and river valleys and takes about four hours by car and six hours by bus (San José to Dominical). Coming in from the northern route now has a new, paved highway. From Quepos, Dominical is about a 1-hour drive. From the south what people do is fly into SJO, then make reservations for Sansa air flight to Palmar Sur and get a car rental to meet them there. From Palmar Sur to Dominical is the best road in the country, thought to support the future plans of an international airport in Palmar Sur. It only takes 45 minutes to drive from the airport to Dominical this way.
The best way to get to Dominical is using Easy Ride Shuttle[dead link] service daily shuttles from San José downtown and SJO airport shuttle leaves at 09:30, and 15:00 rate is US$45 one way per person in modern vans with professional drivers.
It is also best to already know more about the area, places to visit and accommodation, the town is becoming more touristic as it is considered a great surf spot and many retired surfers live here.

Get around[edit]
The town is walkable but most roads are not paved. There is a tourist office just down from the main road, and also a couple of supermarkets.

See[edit]
Lifeguards are not a given in Costa Rica. Children aren't taught to swim and the Red Cross comes to the beach only 2 or 3 times a year for a few days (and then without ocean safety provisions). Funding continuously challenges the professionally trained Dominical Lifeguards program as they are wholly donation funded. This mean these shepherds of the sea are always happy to accept donations from travelers of surf fins, red swim trunks, sunscreen, floats, and cans. Preventative measures are strong (training, public awareness, manning the lifeguard tower and walking or running the beach) as strong waves require alert beach-goers and fortunately there are Lifeguards in Dominical, dedicated to serving both national and international visitors.  The Annual 4th of July Sunday Lifeguards Fundraiser Extravaganza at Roca Verde Hotel/Bar/Restaurant has live music, auction, children's games, surfing, beach party, and a huge BBQ.
Being less than 8 km (5 miles) from Marino Ballena National Park, whales are seen along the shoreline 9 months of the year. Thus, whale watching tours are popular and normally successful. This piece of the Pacific Ocean is one of only two places in the world where whales from the Northern Hemisphere and those from the Southern Hemisphere meet (the other is in North Africa). The Humpback is the star of the show, but six other species are also common.
