Augusta is a city in Georgia's Classic Heartland. Due to its location inland on the Savannah River, Augusta was a city of major strategic importance by the end of the Civil War. It was spared most of the destruction of many other southern cities, so there are many old buildings and landmarks. Augusta is also home to the Augusta National Golf Club, one of the world's most prestigious and exclusive golf clubs, which plays host to the Masters golf tournament.


Understand[edit]
There are some areas of town that the tourist might avoid, but they should be obvious upon inspection. There is a significant presence of military personnel who visit the city on personal business from nearby Fort Gordon. 

Get in[edit]
Map of Augusta (Georgia)
By car[edit]
Augusta is on I-20, between Atlanta and Columbia, South Carolina. I-520 circles the city. Car is usually the best way to get around town, given the sprawl in the city's organization. Traffic is heavy on major arteries and intersections during weekday rush hour. Traveling around the Augusta National Golf Club, especially Washington Road, during Masters Week is not advised.

By plane[edit]
33.3736-81.9731 Augusta Regional Airport (AGS  IATA). Served by Delta Connections from Atlanta (ATL IATA), and by American Airlines from Charlotte (CLT IATA) and Washington, DC (DCA IATA).   
By bus[edit]
Augusta is served by Greyhound Bus Lines. The bus station is at 1128 Greene St in Downtown.

By taxi[edit]
Taxis are not often used and are fairly expensive because of the large distances between destinations in town. There is an often updated official list of taxi services on the Augusta Regional Airport  website.

Get around[edit]
Augusta Public Transit, a public bus system, is available and serves many popular destinations. However, it may be easier to rent a car to access areas not served by the bus system.

Clarks Hill Lake (also known as Strom Thurmond Reservoir)- large dammed lake northwest of Augusta in Columbia and McDuffie Counties. Known as "the Lake" in town, it is ringed by mostly Army Corps of Engineering land, who provides public access to the water. There are many marinas, public "beaches," and pavilion facilities for enjoyment just for the day. Camping is fairly cheap at many of the sites, and those at Amityville and Modoc are especially nice. Fishing is great, as are other water sports. Make sure to ask locals about the lake levels, as during drought years, the lake may be difficult to navigate or unpleasant to swim in as you get further away from the Dam.
Modoc Speedway- in the suburb of Grovetown, this is a 1/4-mile dirt-track raceway which holds events most weekends throughout the summer. Races last a few hours, but are individually short in duration. Many racers are local amateurs, but the faster semi-professionals also race. Great for people watching and getting a taste of racing culture in the South. The track often changes ownership, making events somewhat unpredictable in timing. Check their website or call ahead to make sure.
Carolina Dragway- across the Savannah River in Aiken, SC, this is a drag racing venue that holds events every Sunday in the summer.
Kackleberry Farm- south of Augusta in Louisville, GA, this is a farm open for field trips and visits to the pumpkin patch and corn maze. Allows for kids to experience a farm. Great in the fall.
Steeds Dairy- in the suburb of Grovetown, this educational working dairy farm is open September–November to the public.
