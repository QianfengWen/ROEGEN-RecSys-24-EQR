Maynooth is the principal community in Hastings Highlands township in eastern Ontario. The township has about 4,100 residents (2016).


Understand[edit]
Maynooth, named for the eponymous town in Ireland, was long a way point for visitors en route to Algonquin Provincial Park. The Maynooth railway station, built in 1907 by the Central Ontario Railway, was acquired by Canadian Northern Railway which later became part of the Canadian National Railway. This section of railway was abandoned in 1984; there are proposals to re-purpose the historic station as an interpretive centre.
