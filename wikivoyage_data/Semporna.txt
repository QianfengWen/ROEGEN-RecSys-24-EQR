The waterfront at Semporna
Semporna is a city on east coast of Sabah. It has a population of around 135,000. While there is not much to see and do in Semporna itself, it is frequently used as a gateway for diving and snorkeling trips to the nearby islands of Sipadan, Mabul, Kapalai, Mataking, Maiga and others.


Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Most travellers take a flight to Tawau from either Kuala Lumpur (KUL IATA) or Kota Kinabalu (BKI IATA), then travel overland by taxi (RM 95 for Tawau Airport to Semporna trip). It's also possible to arrange a shuttle service with tour/diving operators operating in Semporna.

By bus[edit]
From Kota Kinabalu: Direct from Inanam station to Semporna (or Tawau), 8-10 hrs, 75 MYR one-way.  Departs 7:30AM & 7:30PM.  To get to Inanam station you can take the public bus from the long distance bus station in KK city on Jalan Padang (Bus #3 to "Terminal" or "Inanam", purple bus stop, 20 min, 1.50 MYR) to the Inanam bus station, or a taxi (~20 MYR).  Call 088-384701 or 088-384702 to book tickets for the Dyana Bus to Semporna.  In high season (Jun-Aug) these buses fill up fast so book at least a day in advance.
From Sandakan: there are two direct buses to Semporna run by Dyana Bus at 7:30AM and 2PM (5-6 hrs, 40 MYR). If you miss the direct bus, you can also try taking a bus to Lahad Datu (at least 1PM, 18RM), and from there take a minibus to Semporna (leaves when it's full, 24RM).
From Sepilok: Take a taxi to Sandakan and take a bus from there, or hail down the bus at Sepilok junction (works if there are seats available on the bus). A taxi can be booked through your accommodation in Sepilok for ~30 MYR pp (shared) and takes 1 hour.
From Kinabatangan River: Let your tour agent drop you off at a bus station (or a bus stand) on the main road to Semporna. There your tour guide might also help you find a bus to Semporna: either the one heading straight to Semporna (a bus passing by that left from Sandakan early in the morning) or, when you missed that bus or when it is full, a minibus to Lahad Datu. From Lahad Datu you can catch another minibus to Semporna. Costs for the minibusses are about RM 20 to Lahad Datu and RM 29 from Lahad Datu to Semporna.

Get around[edit]
4°29′0″N 118°37′0″EMap of Semporna
Because of its small size, Semporna town is easily explored on foot. However, there are also commercial passengers' vans and "kereta sapu (prebet)" for getting around. Usually the fare is RM1 to RM3 to where ever within the city, but the "prebet" will charge tourists with higher prices (about RM5 - RM10), make sure you make a deal with the driver before take a ride.
One may also attempt to get around the town and to surrounding villages/beach resorts using private taxis (commonly referred to as "prebet" or "kereta sapu"). These taxis are usually not color-coded, and the drivers usually drive around the town honking their taxis to attract passengers or converge around points of interest such as the supermarkets. This mode of transportation is favored by the less economically-able locals and the taxis usually charge between RM1 to RM3 to go anywhere and may charge more for tourists. Since these taxis are not licensed for commercial purposes (hence lacking business insurance), travelers are advised to avoid using these taxis at all cost. One will also notice that this kind of taxi usually wait until they have sufficient number of passengers (4 to 6 people) before heading to the passengers' destination.
Commercial passengers' vans are also available for travels to nearby villages and to Tawau. These vans are usually color-coded in yellow and can transport 8 to 12 passengers. These vans are usually available near the KFC fast food outlet and around supermarkets. Charges vary and one should establish an agreed price with the driver before boarding these vans. These vans also travel to Tawau daily and is usually available as early as 5:30AM.

4.439935118.6221491 Skull Hill (Bukit Tengkorak Archaeological Site) (A 15-minute drive SW from the center of town.). 9AM-5PM. The site of an archaeological dig in the 1990's discovering prehistoric artefacts and bones. If you visit now you can take a tour through the small museum and then walk up the hill for about 10 minutes to get a nice view from the covered overlooks. Many people are in town mainly for the scuba diving and snorkeling, and if you have a couple of hours on your way in or way out, this is a different way to get a feel for the natural landscape. 
4.38705118.577862 Parapat Hill (Bukit Parapat) (A 30-minute drive SW from the center of town.). This hill is an easy hike with great views of the islands to the south. If you have a few hours, this is a quiet and beautiful area. 
Diving/Snorkeling[edit]
The nearby island of Sipadan offers some of the world's best scuba diving opportunities with large pelagics including sharks, rays and sea turtles. Many visitors to Semporna join a scuba diving trip to Sipadan. As of October 2022, a 3-dive day at Sipadan is around 900MYR including equipment rental and marine park fee. Snorkelers to Sipadan pay about 700MYR all fees included. The boat ride from Semporna to Sipadan takes about 45 minutes. A 2022 rule change limits the number of Sipadan dives per day to two, so expect your dive operator to push the third dive to a nearby island.
Other nearby islands include Mabul and Kapalai, which are also popular destinations for both scuba divers and snorkelers. Day trips to both of these, as well as other islands nearby, are available from most of the half dozen or so dive operators in Semporna.

Festivals[edit]
Unlike the Land Bajaus and Kadazan usually found in northern Sabah coastal areas, the Sea Bajaus which dominate Semporna celebrate Regatta Lepa-Lepa annually during the entire month of April. Being the focal point of Semporna's identity, the festival is of extreme importance to the locals and the State Government, in which the State's Head of State is always invited to grace the event. Regatta Lepa-Lepa is similar to dragon boat race in which different villages around Semporna will commission their own boats and decorate their boats for parade near the jetties. The culmination of this event is the Ratu Lepa pageant event .
