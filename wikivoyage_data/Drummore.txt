Drummore is a village in Dumfries and Galloway in southwest Scotland. It's the most southerly village in Scotland, near the tip of the Rhins, the peninsula that ends at the Mull of Galloway. It's a tiny place with a population of 534 in 2011, but has facilities out of proportion to this, serving as a visitor base for this scenic area.
