Schliersee is a holiday and ski resort in Bavaria on the waterfront of the lake with the same name. It's on the edge of the Bavarian Alps, approximately 50 km (30 mi) south of Munich.


Understand[edit]
Schlierseer Tal, Schliersee
As most of the lakes in this area Schliersee lake was created by the melting glaciers of the last ice age. The water is of exceptionally high quality. The monastery of Schliersee was first mentioned in 779, probably destroyed around 907 and rebuilt. In 1140, the Schlier monastery was transformed by the Count of Hohenwaldeck and by Bishop Otto I of Freising into a Augustinian monastery with lay brothers. In 1808 the location became a self-standing political community, and it has had its own market since 1919.
This is also the gateway to the well-known hamlet and lake of Spitzingsee, where there is a ski resort.

Go next[edit]
Tegernsee — The town of Tegernsee at the lake with the same name is Schliersee's close-by, posher, and more famous sister. It's a weekend getaway for Munich's high society. The number of limousines with Russian licence plates would surprise you.
Munich — If you did not actually come from there, Bavaria's capital is definitely worth a day trip. Famous for Oktoberfest, the city has much more to offer and is one of Europe's big cultural centres.
Salzburg — Mozart's birthplace and the scenery of the "Sound of Music" is probably what comes to mind first when you think of Salzburg, but that's not the only reason to visit this picturesque city.
