Saintes is a city on the Charente river in Charente-Maritime, in southwestern France. It was the capital of the historical Saintogne County, many landmarks from its glorious past have been preserved, and as such it has been classified as a Ville d'art et d'histoire ("City of art and history").


Understand[edit]
General[edit]
Saintes sits at a curve of the Charente River, among wet meadows and green hills, and has throughout history been a crossroads right in the heart of Charente. The city has a long tradition as a trading point with its monthly markets going on for centuries, and is still today a regional centre for businesses and services. With 25,000 inhabitants in the city and 60,000 in the urban area, it's the second largest city in the region after La Rochelle. 
The oldest attractions in Saintes are from the Roman Empire, including the Arch of Germanicus and the ruins of an amphitheater and as such it has a heritage reaching back two millenia in history. The historical center on both banks of the river has been pedestrianized and it's made up of four districts: Saint-Pierre around the cathedral, Saint-Eutrope around the basilica, Saint-Vivien and Saint-Pallais around the Abbaye aux Dames and the railway station. The old town, Vieux Saintes is truly the beating heart of the city, lively and full of charm. You can walk up the narrow alleys to the Capitole hill for nice views of Saintes with surroundings. 
Also the surrounding region has a lot to offer. The city sits in the middle of the "Atlantic arc" (l’arc atlantique), with the beach resorts of the Côte de Beauté (Royan, Vaux-sur-Mer, Saint-Georges-de-Didonne) just around 30 km away. Famous wine regions are close by as well, here cognac, Pineau de Charentes and Médoc and other Bordeaux wines are made. The vineyards, wheat fields and meadows of Saintogne are in themselves beautiful and have become the theme of many paintings by 19th-century artists such as Gustave Courbet and Jean-Baptiste Corot.

History[edit]
The region has been inhabited since at least the third millenium BC, as per archaeological discoveries in Diconche in the south of the municipality. Around 500 BC a Celtic tribe, the Santons, settled in the area, and from them comes the region's name Saintonge. Saintes was established by the Romans, named Mediolanum Santonum and was the main city of the greater region of Aquitaine.
As the capital of the southwestern quarter of Gaul, the area from the Pyrenees to Loire, during Roman times many grand buildings were built - basilicas, a forum (likely on Capitol hill), thermal baths, arches dedicated to Tiberius and Germanicus, and aqueduct and an amphitheater seating 15,000. The city had right-angled streets, a sewer system, and was connected to the capital of Gaul, Lyon, by a major road (part of the Via Agrippa network). It also had a harbor named Portus Santonum or Novioregum somewhere near present-day Royan.
In the third century CE when the Roman Empire was about to fall apart, the region was attacked by barbarians from the north. The suburbs of the great city were abandoned, the inhabitants concentrated themselves to the inner part of the city, and some monuments were torn down and the material was used to fortify central parts of the city. The city's extent shrunk from around 100 hectares to 18 hectares, still it remained an intellectual center.

The amphitheatre in Saintes was one of the most important in Gaul
Christianity was introduced relatively early, by bishop Saint Eutrope who then became the patron saint of the city, and Saint Eustelle, both who became martyrs. Also three later medieval bishops of the city – Vivien, Trojan and Pallais - became canonized by the Catholic church. In 732, the city was burnt down by the Muslim troops commanded by general Abd-el-Rahman, and in 844 and 848 by Vikings. In the 11th century, the remains of St. Eutrope were found, and a grand basilica was built at the place (the current basilica is just a third of the size of the original) which became a destination for pilgrimage. At the same time a major convent was built on the other side of the river.
In 1152 Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine married Count of Anjou Henri Plantagenêt who became king of England two years later. Therethrough the region became an English possession, and trade with the British Isles made the region and Saintes prosper. Over the following centuries the city saw warfare between France and England several times, and it finally fell in French hands in 1404. Having been ravaged by several wars and the Black Death, the city rose again and a new grand cathedral was being constructed. This came to and end with the French Wars of Religion, and Saintes was sacked by Protestant troops in 1568. Finally, in the 17th century, when the inhabitants had revolted against the French king like many cities in the region, Cardinal Richelieu had torn down the fortified citadel. It was however spared the fate of nearby Royan which was razed to the ground.

The medieval streets and buildings of the old town
During the 18th century Saintes was an administrative city with its own court. The leaders of the city wanted to modernize the city which they considered uncomfortable and dirty, and so the fortifications were razed to make place for grand new promenades. However the French Revolution interrupted the work, and the grand plans never came into being. Saintes was the capital of the new Charente-Inférieure department for some years, but Napoleon moved the capital to La Rochelle for strategical reasons. After the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, urban development proceeded though on a smaller scale. 
In 1867 the railway reached Saintes, leading to the development of a whole new railway district, and about at the same time Avenue Gambetta was finished. Saintes was occupied by Germans during WWII and the strategically important railway district was bombed by the Allies on 24 June 1944, leading to almost 300 casualties. A few months later, the Germans were driven out of the city. 
During the 1960s and 1970s large housing complexes were built, giving Saintes a different character. Another remarkable event was the floods of 1982, when almost 16 km of streets were under water. Today, Saintes is one of the main cities of the department, and the economic centre of the southern Poitou-Charentes region.

Climate[edit]
Saintes has an oceanic climate, but even as the city is just 30 km inland, the climate is notably more continental than at the coast with temperature differences of up to 5 degrees (warmer in the summer, colder in the winter). Still it has a mild climate with little rain (especially in the summer) and more than 2000 hours of sunshine a year, as is visible in the vegetation. Winds are usually moderate, though the odd storm may affect the region in the winter.

Talk[edit]
The people speak French like elsewhere in France. Many locals also speak the vernacular saintongeais also known as parlanjhe. Saintogenais is little represented in the media, but the local market is a good place to hear the language, and it has its own organization, Xaintonge. It's based on the Occitan language spoken here in the Middle Ages, and some words have entered the regional dialect of French.

Problem spots include highways entering and exiting the city, the Gambetta and Saintogne avenues, and surroundings of major shopping centers. Much of the historical center is pedestrianized. 
There are parking areas at the outskirts of the city where you can park for free. In the central parts of the city there's free parking at some places. Parking at the shopping malls costs.

By bus[edit]

Quartier Saint-Pierre[edit]
The largely pedestrianized Saint-Pierre district corresponds to the historical center of the city from the river to Place Capitol. The streets, alleys, squares are buildings are laid out like in medieval times, though many buildings especially along the rather commercialized main streets, Rue Victor Hugo and Rue Alsace-Lorraine, date from the 17th and 18th centuries. In this part of the city you can find the impressive Saint-Pierre cathedral, and can walk up the steps to the Capitol Hill for panoramic views of the city.

The Gothic Saint-Pierre cathedral
45.744444-0.6319441 Cathédrale Saint-Pierre. The large cathedral that's the namesake of the district dominates the old town. There has been at least two cathedrals here earlier, a Merovingian cathedral founded by St Pallais, and a Romanesque cathedral of which the southern cross and a dome have been incorporated in the current building. The Gothic cathedral was once much higher, up to three times higher than its current version. Traces of the ridge raising up to 39 m are still visible on the bell tower, and arcs on the outside raise up above the roof. During the 15th and 16th centuries it was built to those grand proportions, and the cathedral was almost finished when it was largely destroyed by Protestant troops in 1568 during the French Wars of Religion. There weren't funds to rebuilt it as large as it had been, and the current height is about a third of what it once was. Surrounding buildings related to the cathedral like the bishops' residence were also not rebuilt.   (updated Oct 2015)
45.7459-0.6289722 Rue Alsace-Lorraine. An important pedestrian and shopping street, with more than half of the old town's shops. As such it's a great place to just walk around and do window shopping; or to make some side trips along the alleys. Most façades date from the 17th and 18th centuries though there are still some medieval houses left.   (updated Oct 2015)
Rue Victor Hugo
45.74628-0.632173 Rue Victor-Hugo. Another major shopping street in the old town, also known as the Grand’Rue (big street). It follows the routing of an old Roman street. It's pedestrianized and lined with palms and flowers. Looking towards the Charente river along the street, you can see the Germanicus arc. There's a great variety of businesses on this street from perfume shops and hotels to crêperies and art galleries. (updated Oct 2015)
45.74578-0.631714 Rue Saint-Michel. The most "medieval" street of the old town, at least when it comes to the houses lining it which were untouched by the 17th century building project. As there are relatively few businesses, it's much less busy than the shopping streets and even overlooked by visitors spending a short time in the city. (updated Oct 2015)
45.7465-0.63255 Église Sainte-Colombe. In the heart of the Quartier Saint-Pierre, and first mentioned in a charter from 1340, it was one of the main churches within the city walls in the Middle Ages. The present church was built in "flamboyant Gothic" style, destroyed during the Wars of Religion and rebuilt as a smaller version in 1638. After the revolution it became disused for more than half a century until 1849, then functioning as a Carmelite convent until 1922 when it first became a grocery store and then a warehouse. In 2000 it was acquired by the Fraternity of St. Pius X, renovated, and is once again a religious building.   (updated Oct 2015)
The old Jacobin convent and the new Centre d’interprétation de l’architecture et du patrimoine
45.7458-0.63426 Couvent des Jacobins. A Dominican monastery established in 1292, it was rebuilt in the 15th century. After the revolution it became a dwelling house. In the 19th century a certain Maurice Martineau with a large collection of books lived there and as he passed away in 1928, the house and the books became the property of the city. Therethrough the municipal library came into being, and which it has been ever since. Only the Gothic choir with its grand bay and inscriptions reveal that this was once a house of worship.   (updated Oct 2015)
45.7459-0.63327 Musée de L'Échevinage, 29 ter, rue Alsace Lorraine. An art museum in a former échevinage (a seat of municipal institutions under the Ancien Régime), classed as a historical monument. The artworks on display are mostly from the 19th century by French painters.   (updated Oct 2015)

Quartier Saint-Pallais[edit]
Saint-Pallais at the right bank of Charente is, like the former, also a protected district. It has it roots in the Roman era with some Roman constructions still standing and was for a long time the main suburb of the city (just outside the city walls). 
During the middle ages, the Abbaye aux Dames and the Saint-Pallais church were built here. In 1259 when Charente formed the border between French and English possessions, present-day Saint-Pallais was a French city facing an English city across the river. Still today it retains its distinct character and the gardens along the river bank is a popular place for locals on sunny days.

45.7459-0.6289729 Place Bassompierre. A square built in 1843 and named after 17th century bishop Louis de Bassompierre. It's a kind of an esplanade in front of the Fernand-Chapsal gardens where the Germanicus arc was reassembled in 1851. On the square there's a statue of 16th century potter Bernard Palissy who pioneered the Palissy ware ceramics style. The square is a venue for different events and a departure place for river tour boats.   (updated Feb 2018)
The Germanicus arc, one of the symbols of the district
45.745917-0.62897210 Arc de Germanicus. A triumphal arch built in 18 or 19 AD by Caius Julius Rufus, to celebrate emperor Tiberius, his son Drusus, and his nephew and adoptive son Germanicus. In Roman times it marked the eastern entrance to the city and was placed in the front of the bridge across Charente. When the quai was modernized in 1843-51, the arch was disassembled and rebuilt 15 m away at its current place. Some Roman inscriptions are still visible on the arch.   (updated Feb 2018)

In particular, there's a great collection of gemstones excavated when ramparts were reconstructed in the late 19th century.   (updated Feb 2018)
45.7452-0.624312 Église Saint-Pallais. Right next to the Abbaye aux Dames, of which it is an outbuilding, and for a long time the only parish church on the right bank. It was first built in the 12th century to replace Bishop Palladius' funeral basilica, and later modified into Gothic style. This led to some interesting details; columns becoming unused, the Romanesque apse being replaced by a flat bay in "flamboyant" Gothic style, and the bell tower being shortened and covered by an atypical slate roof. There used to be a small cemetery below what's now a public square next to the church. Entrée libre.   (updated Feb 2018)
The Sainte-Marie church with its interesting bell tower
45.744722-0.62416713 Abbaye aux Dames, ☏ +33 5 46 97 48 48, info@abbayeauxdames.org. Founded by Count of Anjou Geoffroy Martel and his wife Agnes of Burgundy in 1047, it was once one of the most important female monasteries in southwestern France. It was richly endowed by the Dukes of Aquitaine and at its peak home to up to a hundred nuns from French nobility. Madame de Saintes, the abbess of this monastery, had a very powerful position. She carried a bishop's staff, for female religious leaders an almost unheard of privilege at the time, and also had the right to mint money and act as a judge. In 1320 it was placed under the protection of the French king, as the right bank became French territory, which greatly angered the Duke of Aquitaine (the English king). After the revolution, indeed already somewhat before, the monastery declined, and was converted into a jail and later a barracks. In the mid 20th century it became a religious building again, and is now also a cultural institution. The abbey also has a separate church, the Église Saint-Marie, which has an interesting bell tower which is said to look like a pine cone and a decorated portal, plus some additional buildings related to the abbey.

Quartier Saint-Eutrope[edit]
The first buildings here were estates (villae) built for rich patricians during the Roman times, they also had built the large amphitheater here. In the Middle Ages, in turn, a basilica was constructed to house the remains of Saint Eutrope, which became an important stop for pilgrims on their way to Santiago de Compostela. This is a green and calm part of the city, with some ancient houses lining steep streets between the basilica and the river and the Colline du Capitole which can be considered the balcony of the city. 

45.74581-0.6439915 Amphithéâtre gallo-Romain, 20 rue Lacurie, ☏ +33 5 46 97 73 85, amphitheatre@ville-saintes.fr. Sitting in a green valley, the Roman amphitheater was built almost 2000 years ago under the rule of Tiberius and Claudius. It could seat 15000 spectators (undoubtedly much of the city's inhabitants) and was one of the most important in Gaul. It's built to an elliptical structure and has a size of 126 x 102 m, and fits neatly into the valley. The amphitheater was used as a stone quarry during the Middle Ages, so it's by no means intact. Little remains of the cavea (seating area), the gates are somewhat better preserved. Still it's an important historical monument from the time when the city was named Mediolanum Santonum.   (updated Mar 2018)
The Saint-Eutrope basilica, listed as a component of the UNESCO World Heritage Way of St. James
45.743333-0.64138916 Basilique Saint-Eutrope. Founded in 1081 by Guillaume VIII, Duke of Aquitaine, it's actually two churches superimposed on each other with stairs in the nave connecting them. The basilica was built to house the relics of martyred Saint Eutrope with his sarcophagus in the upper church and his skull in the lower church. It has been an important stop on the Way of St. James route to Santiago de Compostela ever since. In 1096, not long after it was finished, pope Urban II visited to preach the First Crusade. In 1886, pope Leon XIII promoted the status of the church to basilica. Basilique Saint-Eutrope is considered an architectonical masterpiece with its Romanesque walls, Gothic choir, 11th century baptismal fonts, paintings and stained windows and one of the largest Romanesque crypts in Europe in the lower church surrounding the sarcophagus of the saint. free.

45.7447-0.6363918 Governor's house (Logis du Gouverneur). One of the last parts of a 17th-century citadel. A few decades after its completion, the region of Saintogne revolted against the king, the rebellion was struck down, and Cardinal Richelieu ordered the citadel to be torn down. In addition to the governors house, there's little left of the fortifications. Later a Carmelite convent, a hospital (later wrecked) and a chapel was built on the grounds. The older buildings have been incorporated in the new Saint-Louis residential district.   (updated Feb 2018)
Quartier Saint-Vivien[edit]
Saint-Vivien is separated from the historical center by the Cours National street, and corresponds to the ancient suburbs of Saint-Vivien and Saint-Saloine, that were founded around Christian necropolises. 18th-century bourgeois houses line the streets and there are traces from the Roman Empire here too, the ruins of thermal baths. There are few shops in this district and it's off the traditional tourist path.

The 19th-century neoclassical Saint-Vivien church
45.7508-0.6366719 Saint-Saloine thermal baths (Thermes de Saint-Saloine). Reduced to ruins today, the Saint-Saloine thermal baths were the most important ones in the Roman city. They were build towards the end of the 1st century and modeled on similar baths in Rome. Over the centuries, the baths were first converted into a church, then abandoned in the 16th or 17th century. From the nearby terrace there are nice views of the surroundings.   (updated Feb 2018)
