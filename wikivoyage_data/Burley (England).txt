Burley is a village of 1,400 people (2011) in the New Forest. It has ancient origins and is now somewhat tourist-orientated. Burley has a long connection with witches; in the late 1950s, Sybil Leek, a self-styled white witch, lived in the village. The village now has a new age presence, and several shops sell paranormal paraphernalia such as tarot decks and incense candles.

Coven of Witches
Burley sits towards the western edge of the New Forest, 4 miles (6 km) south-east of the town of Ringwood The village is fairly scattered, and apart from the village centre, there is Burley Street to the north; Bisterne Close to the east; and the Mill Lawn area to the north-east. The village still practises the old tradition of commoning, allowing animals to graze on the open Forest, and ponies and cattle roam freely around the village. 
The village is surrounded by the open heathland of the New Forest, containing a complex of woodland, heathland and acid grassland, shrub and valley bog, supporting a richness and diversity of wildlife. Burley is twinned with Beurlay in southwestern France. Burley Fire Station is thought to be the only fire station in the country with a cattle grid at the entrance.

The Bisterne Dragon
The Bisterne Dragon legend takes place primarily in Bisterne, but also features Burley and Lyndhurst, and is one of the area's most famous pieces of folklore. The local tradition is that a dragon had his den at Burley Beacon, about 3 miles (4.8 km) east of Bisterne, at Burley.  One version of the tale is that the creature flew every morning to Bisterne, where it would be supplied with milk. To kill the dragon, a valiant knight (usually named Berkeley) built a hide, and with two dogs lay in wait. The creature came as usual one morning for its milk, and when the hut door was opened the dogs attacked it. The knight took the dragon by surprise, and the dogs died in the affray. ; 
Another version of the tale says that the dragon slayer only succeeded by covering his armour with glass. A popular telling of the story has it that the fight raged throughout the forest, with the dragon finally dying outside the village of Lyndhurst, his corpse turning into a hill (now known as Boltons Bench). Though the knight had defeated the dragon, he had been mentally broken by the battle, and after 30 days and 30 nights he went back to Boltons Bench to die alone atop it, his yew-wood bow falling on the ground beside his body and eventually sprouting into the yew tree which can still be seen today.
