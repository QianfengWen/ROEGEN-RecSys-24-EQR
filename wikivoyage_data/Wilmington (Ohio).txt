Wilmington is a city in Southwest Ohio. For those interested in "small town America" Wilmington is an excellent stop with a compact central city center, small college, and ornate buildings.


Understand[edit]
Wilmington is a small city in Clinton County, Ohio, with a population of 12,3400 (2019). The city is one of the only noteworthy stops between the endless fields of corn that populate rural Ohio.
It is home to Wilmington College, which was founded in 1870 by the Society of Friends (the Quakers). The city and the surrounding area include more than one dozen Quaker meeting houses.

History[edit]
The town of Clinton was founded in 1810 as seat of the newly formed Clinton County; the name was changed to Wilmington in 1811. The village was incorporated in 1828.
In the early 1950s the city became home to U.S. Department of Defense facilities, most notably the Clinton County Air Force Base. Following its closure in 1971, the economy of the city hovered in recession for more than a decade. Airborne Express purchased the facility in 1979 to build a hub for its national delivery network to accommodate an estimated 6,000 employees and its fleet of aircraft. In 2008, the Wilmington hub was closed, resulting in 16,000 layoffs.
Wilmington is also home to CMH Regional Health System, a regional health provider. From its base of operations at Clinton Memorial Hospital, the non-profit corporation has established health clinics in almost a dozen satellite locations in Southwestern Ohio.
In addition to air freight services and medical services, the city of Wilmington also competes in the truck freight industry, serving as corporate home to R+L Carriers, a trucking and shipping company.
