Perranporth (Cornish: Porthperan)  is small seaside resort on the north coast of North Cornwall. The village's modern name comes from Porth Peran, which is Cornish for the cove of Saint Piran, the patron saint of Cornwall. He founded St Piran's Oratory on Penhale Sands near Perranporth in the 7th century. Buried under sand for many centuries, it was unearthed in the 19th century.
