Downtown Reading
View of Reading from The Pagoda
Reading is a historic city of about 95,000 (2020 Census) in Pennsylvania, about 50 miles northwest of Philadelphia, 35 miles southwest of Allentown and 55 miles east of Harrisburg. It punches above its weight in culture, and its downtown features some iconic buildings, so consider making it a stopover on your way between any of these and other area cities.


Understand[edit]
Reading is a very old and historic city. It was once home to one of the largest railway systems in the country (where the familiar Reading Railroad from the Monopoly board comes from) which radiated in all directions from the City of Reading. The construction of the railroad was probably the single greatest factor in the development of Berks County. While Reading has experienced an economic downturn, efforts are being made to try to revitalize the city's downtown area with such projects as the Sovereign Center, the Sovereign Performing Arts Center, the Miller Center, the Goggle Works Center for the Arts, and the Reading Movies 11, which includes an IMAX theater. Today, Reading is a city pulsating with industrial life. It is also well equipped with agencies that represent civilization at its best-churches, hospitals, clubs, fraternal societies, recreational centers, schools and colleges, a historical society, an art institute, and a daily newspaper. Reading claims the distinction of a symphony orchestra, two choral societies, a chamber musical ensemble, a civic opera company, and many other excellent music groups that have contributed to the city's prestige as a center of art and culture. Reading is not only an excellent place to visit because of what it has to offer but also because it is close to other popular destinations. Reading is centrally located, about an hour's drive northwest of Philadelphia, 2½ hours southwest of New York City, 3 hours north of Washington, DC, 40 minutes from the Amish country and about an hour from Hershey Park and Dorney Park, so it offers a lot of opportunities for day trips for tourists staying in the area. Reading also lies only about 2½ to about 3½ hours from some beautiful shore resorts in New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland.

Another part of Reading's history is the store named Boscovs. Reading is home to Boscovs first store. Boscov's has grown into a 39 store company throughout the Mid-Atlantic region.

Shopping centers and malls[edit]
