Somerset is a small town in the SouthCoast region of Massachusetts. It is built on the western bank of the Taunton River, connected by bridges with Fall River and sharing a border with Swansea.


Understand[edit]
These massive, $600 million cooling towers at Brayton Point dominated the Somerset skyline from 2011 to 2019
Incorporated in 1790, Somerset is defined by its most prominent geographical feature- the Taunton River. When the town was founded, it was a major port for American goods distribution and shipbuilding. As industry grew in Fall River across the water, Somerset became increasingly suburban. Somerset Village on the town's north shore is a living example of the town's residential development over the past few centuries. The southern tip of Somerset, Brayton Point, was home to the last coal-fired power station in Massachusetts before its closure in 2017 and implosion in 2019. The future of Brayton Point remains uncertain in the early 2020s; development proposals include clean energy generation and commercial zoning.
Somerset's restaurants and businesses are concentrated along its two major roads: US Route 6 (GAR Hwy) and MA Route 138 (County St). 
Two bridges cross the river to connect Somerset with Fall River: the Braga Bridge (I-195) and the Veterans Memorial Bridge (Routes 6 and 138). The Brightman St. Bridge closed to traffic in 2011 after over 100 years of service. The local landmark still stands today, its drawbridge always open to boat traffic. Slade's Ferry Ave, which connects the defunct bridge with Route 6, was a major local commercial thoroughfare prior to the 2010s. Today, it is a ghost town of shuttered businesses.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The Veterans Memorial Bridge into Somerset (background) from Fall River (foreground)
Somerset is most easily accessed by car. 
Because Somerset's western border is entirely shoreline, most routes in and out go over a bridge.

Interstate 195 runs east-west between Providence and Cape Cod. Connects to Fall River via the Braga Bridge. Exit 10.
US Route 6, 3,000 mi (4,800 km) in length, connects Somerset with bordering Swansea and Fall River (via the Veterans Memorial Bridge). Here, the road is also known as Grand Army of the Republic Highway (GAR Hwy).
Two other, minor numbered roads pass through Somerset:

MA Route 138 runs concurrently with Route 6 from Fall River, before diverging and running north toward Taunton via Dighton. Known here as County Street.
MA Route 103 terminates in Somerset. It runs west through Swansea into Warren (Rhode Island), becoming RI Route 103, which connects to East Providence.
By bus[edit]
The Southeastern Regional Transportation Authority (SRTA) offers one bus route (Route 14) to Somerset from Swansea and Fall River.

By plane[edit]
T.F. Green Airport (PVD IATA) in Warwick (Rhode Island) is the nearest major domestic airport.
Logan International Airport (BOS IATA) in Boston is the major international airport serving the area.
Taunton Municipal Airport (FAA: TAN) in East Taunton is a small regional airport.

Getting around in Somerset is most easily done by car, particularly through the town's main commercial highways. However, the town is small, flat, and residential, making walking feasible. The compact roads are good for jogging, cycling, dog walking, rollerblading, and skateboarding.
