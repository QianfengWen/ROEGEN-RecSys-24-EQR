Grand Falls/Grand-Sault is a city of 5,200 people (2021) in the valley of the Saint John River in New Brunswick.


Understand[edit]
Grand Falls Gorge
The town derives its name from a waterfall created by a series of rock ledges over which the river drops 23 m (75 ft).
Three main industries reside in Grand Falls: potato farming, potato processing  and tourism. The town is also a local commercial centre for Victoria County, catering to the surrounding communities of Plaster Rock, Perth Andover, Blue Bell, and New Denmark.

History[edit]
The area is the traditional territory of the Maliseet First Nations (Indigenous) people. French settlement began in the late 1600s, and there is mention of. French fort there in 1693.  In 1763, the region passed into British hands and its French population diminished due to the deportation of the Acadians. In 1783, the Loyalists settled in Acadia and the province of New Brunswick was created the next year. In 1785, the Acadians in Fredericton and nearby were evicted from their land and in June 1785, a group decided to establish the region of Grand Falls and the rest of Madawaska with the agreement of the Maliseet First Nations people.
In 1791, Thomas Carleton, then Governor of New Brunswick, built a fort at Grand Falls. The Madawaska region was then disputed between Quebec, New Brunswick and the United States. The War of 1812 showed that the area's roads were not safe and in 1875, the colonial government of New Brunswick decided to build a road from Woodstock to Grand Falls. The territorial differences culminated in the Aroostook War in 1838. The Webster–Ashburton Treaty in 1842, gave Grand Falls to the province of New Brunswick.
