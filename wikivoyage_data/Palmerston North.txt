Palmerston North (Māori: Te Papaioea) is a city in the Manawatu district of the lower North Island of New Zealand. It's the home of the largest campuses of Massey University and the Universal College of Learning (UCOL) and also the Institute of the Pacific United (IPU), making Palmerston North a student-oriented city.


Understand[edit]
Art Deco building in the square
Palmerston North has a population of 80,000, of which about 18,000 are students. It is the seventh largest city in New Zealand and is the largest provincial city in the region. It is also the home of the Linton Military Camp and has the Air Force Base, Ohakea, close by. The Adidas Institute of Rugby, based at Massey University, focuses on improving the skills of the All Blacks, the national rugby union team, though sightings of them there are rare.
Originally named Palmerston, the city was renamed Palmerston North in 1871 by the Post Office to distinguish it from the town of Palmerston in the South Island. Another common name used by the native Māori inhabited is Papaioea.

Get around[edit]
40°21′18″S 175°36′36″EMap of Palmerston North
Palmerston North is built around The Square. Railway lines used to run through the Square to the station, goods and shunting yards on Main Street west. This proved to be extremely impractical so the station was moved in 1964-66 and the site was turned into a park, known as the Railway Land. The roads radiating outwards from the Square are so wide because they used to accommodate the railway tracks.
Most places are easily accessible by foot.

By bus[edit]
Horizons Regional Council has local bus timetables.

By bicycle[edit]
One of the advantages of Palmerston North is that it is compact, flat and easy to cycle around. The main educational institutions have cycle-lanes from the city centre. The main route to Massey University along Fitzherbert Avenue is packed with cyclists every morning.
