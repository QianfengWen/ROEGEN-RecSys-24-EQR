Thung Nham bird park
Ninh Binh is a city in North Vietnam with population of 160,000 people (2014).


Understand[edit]
Ninh Binh is famous for the nearby karst scenery and the village of Tam Coc. There isn't much to do around, apart from drinking beer with the locals, but it is useful as a base for the surrounding countryside.
Trang An Scenic Landscape Complex is a  UNESCO World Heritage Site inscribed as a mixed natural and cultural property, a spectacular limestone karst landscape. The archeological remains found in caves trace human presence since 30,000 years. Part of the heritage is Hoa Lu, the old capital of Vietnam.

Get in[edit]
By taxi[edit]
Taxis from Hanoi cost USD48.
Taxis from Noi Bai international airport cost USD70, a 2-hour journey.

By bus[edit]
There are regular buses from Hanoi's southern bus terminal (Giap Bat) that leave every 15 min (or whenever full) 70,000 dong (June 2016). Journey time is 1½-2½ hr depending on traffic. Buy a ticket in the ticket hall or you will likely have to pay more than 70,000 dong.
Open tour buses will drop passengers off upon request but Ninh Binh is not a regular stop. Most open tour buses from Hanoi will arrive at 21:30. Tour buses from Hue arrive between 04:00 and 06:00, depending on the company.

By train[edit]
Ninh Binh is a station for northbound and southbound trains.
Daytime southbound trains to Dong Hoi and Hue (23:00 arrival) depart at 11:21 and can be enjoyed in 2nd class seats rather than sleepers for those looking to avoid overnight journeys and long-haul buses.

Get around[edit]
20°15′14″N 105°58′30″EMap of Ninh Binh
By car[edit]
Guesthouses may provide organised tours by car for USD20 per day.
Taxis are also common and not different from the ones in Hanoi or Saigon, although a little cheaper.

By motorbike[edit]
See also: Vietnam by motorcycle
A motorbike is the best way to view Ninh Binh and the surrounding area. A motorbike can be rented for about 100,000 dong per day, a motorcycle[dead link] driver/guide to take you around the sites for about USD10-20 a day.
The roads in general are quite well maintained and not overly busy, but the junctions, just like everywhere else in Vietnam, can be dangerous. Renting your own motorbike is possible but not without risk.

By bicycle[edit]
Cycling is a good option for visiting nearby sights. Guesthouses hire out bicycles for about 40,000 dong/day. There is a country road (mountain bike is recommended) that connects Hoa Lu and Tam Coc.

On foot[edit]
The town of Ninh Binh is quite small and walkable. However, most of the interesting sights are outside the city.

See[edit]
There are three main spots, where people board boat tours: Trang An, Tam Coc and Vân Long. Tam Coc being the most famous and therefore crowded of them.

Trang An area[edit]
20.252872105.9177951 Trang An Grottoes (7 km from Ninh Binh). An easy bicycle ride away, Trang An Grottoes is similar to Tam Coc, but with many more caves to pass through. Tourists who have also visited Tam Coc prefer this trip as there are not as many hawkers. Most caves have been widened in order for the boats to pass through and as result their natural beauty has been compromised. The first two caves are the most natural and beautiful, but are also tight in places, so watch your head. Lots of concrete structures are being built all over the place, and rice paddies are disappearing fast, but hopefully this area will not lose its splendor. It might be worth bringing a torch in case the power fails and the lights go out. Some of the tunnels are quite long and your rower may have forgotten his backup torch.There is a parking fee of 15,000 dong for two-wheelers (bicycle or motorbike) as of June 2016. The boat trip lasts more than 2 hours so make sure you carry water and some nibbles. 250,000 dong entrance fee. (updated Dec 2022)
20.28492105.9043442 Hoa Lu ancient capital (6 km north of Ninh Binh, then 6 km west of Hwy 1). The ancient capital during Dinh (968-80) and Le dynasties (980-1009). Mostly destroyed, there is the temple of Dinh Tien Hoang, the temple of King Le Dai Hahn, Nhat Tru Pagoda, and on top of a hill, Dinh Tien Hoang's tomb. There are also boat trips on the river to Xuyen Thuy cave, less spectacular than other caves in the area. Entrance to cave is 15,000 dong. 12,000 dong. 
20.275527105.86283 Chua Bai Dinh (11 km NW of Ninh Binh). Huge new Buddhist complex, mostly visited by Vietnamese. 
Tam Coc area[edit]
Tam Coc
Bich Dong pagoda
9 km south of Ninh Binh, along Hwy 1. It's an easy bicycle ride from Ninh Binh, with no hills

20.2159105.93684 Tam Coc. One of Vietnam's most spectacular sights. A boat can be hired that will take you along the river. Excursion begins at the village of Van Lam and proceeding through a scenic landscape dominated by rice fields and karst towers. The route includes floating through three natural caves (Hang Cả, Hang Hai, and Hang Ba), the largest of which is 125-m long with its ceiling about 2-m high above the water. Vast limestone cliffs rise out of the rice paddies. The area is somewhat similar to Ha Long Bay, but more accessible and much less touristy. The best time to go is in the morning or late afternoon, when it's quieter and cooler with more shade. Last boats start out about 17:30 in the summer and 16:30 in the winter. 150,000 dong per boat (maximum 2 foreigners per boat), plus admission of 120,000 dong per person.   (updated Sep 2022)
The area around Tam Coc is equally beautiful, and is best viewed from the back of a motorbike or by bicycle. There is also a temple atop one of the hills which provides incredible views.
20.21738105.915845 Bích Động Pagoda (2 km west of Tam Coc Cave). Three temples carved into a limestone mountain, dating from the 15th-century reign of Le Thai To. The lower temple has a stone next to it that resonates when tapped, plus a Buddha footprint. The middle temple has an 18th-century bell, a cave and resonating pillars. The top temple has a view of the surrounding countryside, which is good for sunsets. Free entrance, although a fee is required to park the motorbike near the entrance. The lady charging the fee may try to overcharge by implying that it also includes the entrance to the temples, but this is a lie as the entrance is free. Do not pay more than 20,000 dong! Even 20,000 is too much for parking, just leave the bike farther away from the entrance to avoid paying at all. (updated Dec 2018)
20.230554105.9368456 Hang Mua, Khe Dau Ha, Hoa Lu (5 km from Ninh Binh). Hundreds of steps will lead you to a unimpressive temple on top of a hill with incredibly stunning views over Tam Coc and Ninh Binh’s countryside. 100,000 dong entrance fee + 3,000 dong bicycle/motorbike parking fee. (updated May 2016)
Van Long area[edit]
Van Long Nature Reserve
20.373116105.8731217 Vân Long Nature Reserve. (updated Apr 2016)
20.360721105.9119378 Dich Long Cave and Pagoda, Gia Thanh commune. (updated Apr 2016)
Beautiful Hoa Son, Tien caves and Van Trinh Grotto can be visited nearby.
Further afield[edit]
20.316672105.6061449 Cuc Phuong National Park (45 km from Ninh Binh). A well-preserved rainforest with an Endangered Primates Rescue Centre near the entrance. You can only visit the centre with a park guide, which costs an extra 20,000 dong per person and doesn't take long. There are about 150 primates here being prepared for release back in the wild. Most are from other parts of Vietnam and any releases will be where they originally came from. There is also a botanical garden near the entrance. From the entrance you can drive, motorbike or cycle a further 20 km along a densely forested paved road, from which several bypaths lead you through the jungle to prehistoric trees and caves. Cycling is probably the most rewarding way to travel this 20 km of often steeply inclined paved road and mountain bikes can be hired at the park entrance. The road ends at the park centre (Bong), from where there are several forest walks. The park centre has a restaurant and a place to buy snacks. The best chance to see any animals here is at night. Guided night tours for overnight stayers are available. There are other points of interest along the narrow 20 km road such as a cave, ancient trees, and walking trails. One of the amazing things about this drive is the thousands of colourful butterflies filling the roadway. Peak time for butterflies apparently is Apr-May, but in later months there may still be many to be seen. It is especially enjoyable to touch the thousand-year-old cho xanh (parashrea stellata) and sau (dracontomelum duperranum or dancorra edulis) trees, 50-70 m high. The park is also perfect for seeing birds, butterflies, and orchids. They are more concentrated than in a typical butterfly farm enclosure. A limited amount of overnight accommodation is available in either a detached bungalow or a stilt house. 20,000 dong.   
 Bear Sanctuary Ninh Binh, Cuc Phuong - Bai Dinh road, Ky Phu commune, Nho Quan district, ☏ + 84 229 366 6388, info@four-paws.org.vn. It was built by the animal welfare organisation Four Paws in 2019 and is located in northern Vietnam. Within the next years the sanctuary will be expanded to 10 ha. The sanctuary opened for visitors in January 2019. Different from other sanctuaries, visitors will not be able to enter the whole sanctuary. A path leads the visitors above some enclosures to allow them to observe the bears from a distance. There is also an education centre is also planned and will be completed after the sanctuary has opened for visitors first. 
20.093294106.077910 Phat Diem Cathedral (24 km SW of Ninh Binh in the village of Kim Son). Cathedral known for its scale and its oriental style. Completed in 1891. One of the earliest areas to be reached by missionaries; Portuguese priests were here in 1627.

Buy[edit]
There is a fresh fruit market next to the main market across the bridge.

Mountain goat (de nui) meat is a local speciality, often eaten with fried rice (com chien). Another local speciality is com chay, which is the burnt rice off the bottom of the pot, served with pork. Duck is featured in many restaurants.
The area near the train station has become a mini-backpacker area, and there are 4-5 backpacker cafes there with English menus and tourist prices (40,000-70,000 dong; coffee 15,000-20,000 dong).

Sleep[edit]
There are a number of cheap hotels just outside the train station and next to the bus station. Other hotels are located near the city centre. As there is nothing to see in city, either area is suitable. The area near the train station has become a mini-backpacker district, complete with travel agents, touts, overpriced drinks and English-menu restaurants. While it is also possible to stay near the wharf for the Tam Coc ferry, it is not recommended as the quality of the hotels and in particular the restaurants is very low.

Stay safe[edit]
Tips for Tam Coc boat excursion:

When leaving your motorbike at the departure point, beware of thieves (such as removing a mirror while the motorbike is parked, then selling it back to you for 100,000 dong). Look for official parking areas to avoid such scams.
When you catch the boat from the harbour, try not to board a boat that is loaded with boxes at departure. The boxes are filled with handicrafts and are intended for you to buy. During the return trip the rowers might suddenly turn from friendly rowers to pushy sellers. Don't ruin your experience by allowing this. Demand a rower or boat without handicraft and souvenir boxes.
