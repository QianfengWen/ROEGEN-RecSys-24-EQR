Understand[edit]
Traces of inhabiting the territory where the city of Costești, Argeș County, is located today, dates back to before the conquest of Dacia by the Romans, from early antiquity. The existence of a human community on the current territory of the city of Costesti is attested, among others, by the Roman imperial denarius issued by the emperor Domitian, discovered in 1966, on the Cimitirului Hill in Costesti.
The settlement is documented initially in the deed issued by the princely chancellery of voivode Radu Paisie on July 30, 1535, confirming to Șerb and others the ownership of some "ocine în Costești", Șerb "placing ocini tracks on his daughters, Stana and Buna" . In the 14th century, there are several mentions of two journeys of the voivode Nicolae Alexandru Basarab, son of Basarab I the Founder, from Curtea de Argeș to the Danube, during which stops were made for rest and changing horses "in the settlement of Costesti".
Today's costesti acquires and retains its status as a plain fair and trading center until close to the modern era.
Undoubtedly, April 18, 1930 is the darkest day in the history of the town. It was a Friday, Good Friday before Easter. In the small wooden church in the village of Costesti, the priest and the crowd of parishioners were preparing for Denie's service. The tragedy happened around 6 p.m. 116 souls, most of them children, almost all the children of the village, died in a terrible fire that engulfed and burned, in a few minutes, the little church. Between 1932 and 1934, a new church was built, later renovated in two or three rows, and which today is one of the city's prides. Another pride of the locality is an old wooden church, built in 1686, in the area where the Zorile neighborhood is today.
On June 1, 1968, by official decree, Costești was declared a third category city. The birth certificate of the city of Costești was issued on June 8, 1968 by the executive committee of the City People's Council. Between 1968 and 1989, the travel system of the citizens was modernized, benefiting not only from the railway, but also from the national road DN 65A Costești - Roșiori de Vede and the modernized county road Costești - Alexandria.
