 Roman Bath House, Melyd Avenue, Prestatyn. Genuine example of a Roman bath house, only a small site, little bigger than the size of a house. There is a helpful display, that explains the functionality of the baths, and some benches to sit and ponder the scene from millennia ago. Not easy to find, set amidst a housing estate, and with limited parking, perhaps best to visit on foot. Free. (updated Jun 2017)
