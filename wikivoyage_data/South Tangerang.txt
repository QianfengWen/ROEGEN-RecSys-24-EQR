South Tangerang (Tangerang Selatan) is a city in the province of Banten, and part of the Jabodetabek Greater Jakarta metropolitan area. South Tangerang is a densely populated urban area consisting of several towns and Jakarta suburbs. The independent city of Tangerang is just north of South Tangerang. The total population of South Tangerang is about 1.5 million, with key population centres including Serpong, Ciputat, and Pamulang. Also the large privately-operated planned community BSD City is in the city.


Understand[edit]

As housing in Jakarta becomes unaffordable and a rare commodity due to limited spaces to even build one proper house, South Tangerang becomes a good alternative for those who are working in the capital city without spending too much on housing and don't mind a longer commute than those who live in the centre. Several shopping malls, restaurants, and working spaces, mostly maintained by private companies, are built to accommodate and fulfil the needs of its residents without commuting far to Jakarta and also as the answer to reduce traffic jam, especially during rush hours and weekends.

Get in[edit]
South Tangerang is a collection of several towns, planned communities and Jakarta suburbs, and therefore there is not one clear city centre or transportation hub. The main road into the city is the Jakarta-Serpong toll road, which connects the Jakarta Outer Ring Road in South Jakarta to among others the Bintaro Jaya new town and BSD City. The Jakarta-Tangerang toll road passes just north of South Tangerang, and is a good way to get to the North Serpong district. To get to the southern part of the city, a trunk road leads from the Jakarta Outer Ring Road at Lebak Bulus to the districts of Ciputat and Pamulang (this road is numbered as National Road 12, but there are no signposts indicating this). The Jakarta Outer Ring Road 2 connects the Soekarno-Hatta International Airport passes through Tangerang and crosses the Jakarta-Tangerang toll road before intersecting the Jakarta-Serpong toll road and ending at Pamulang. It is being extended to connect with a segment of the Jakarta Outer Ring Road 2 in Depok.

By plane[edit]
-6.33508106.76211 Pondok Cabe Airport (PCB  IATA) (in the southeast of South Tangerang, in Pamulang district). It serves chartered flights by Pelita Air Service.   (updated Feb 2021)
The main international airport of Jakarta, Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (CGK IATA), is about 25 km north of South Tangerang. The driving time is less than an hour if there is no traffic congestion, but it is not uncommon that this takes much longer (more than 2 hours).

By bus[edit]
There are various bus lines from and to locations throughout Tangerang and Jakarta. In addition, many long distance bus services to destinations throughout Java and beyond are available to and from the nearby Lebak Bulus bus terminal in South Jakarta.
South Tangerang is also served by two Transjakarta bus rapid transit routes. One of them runs from Tosari in Central Jakarta to BSD City, the other one from Central Jakarta via South Jakarta and Lebak Bulus terminal to Ciputat.

By train[edit]
There are five railway stations in South Tangerang along the railway between Jakarta and Merak, which runs parallel to the Jakarta-Serpong toll road. All five stations are served by the green line of Jakarta's commuter train network (KA Commuter Jabodetabek), which runs from Tanah Abang in Central Jakarta via South Tangerang to Rangkasbitung station in Lebak regency of Banten province. The largest station in the city is -6.32011106.665612 Serpong railway station.

Get around[edit]

There are dozens of minibus (angkot) routes throughout South Tangerang, with many of them connecting to Tangerang, Jakarta, or Depok. Angkots follow a fixed route, but there is no fixed schedule and there are no fixed stops. To get on, simply raise your hand. To get off, simply shout "Kiri!" to the driver, so he will pull over on the left (Indonesian: kiri) side of the road. The price of an angkot ride within the city is usually about Rp2,000 to 5,000. It is best to ask a local which angkot route to take, and how to recognise the location you want to get off.
The easiest way to get around in South Tangerang is by taxi. Taxi ranks are available outside the shopping malls and hotels. The main reputable taxi companies of Jakarta, including Blue Bird and Express, also have a branch in South Tangerang.

Stay safe[edit]
Local law enforcement is unreliable, so you may want to be even more cautious than you do in your hometown. If you are planning to draw your money in the ATM nearby (even in the mall) on Saturday, Sunday, and public holidays, look around to make sure there's nobody wearing civilian uniforms welcomes you and pretends he will guard you. If you are trapped by his 'artificial' kindness, once you finished your banking activities, he will call his crime-partners outside to come in and pressure you to hand over your belongings. Some of them may murder you, even after you have done what they asked. Make sure that the ATM you visit is monitored by a camera.
