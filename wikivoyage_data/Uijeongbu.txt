Understand[edit]
Uijeongbu is located north of the Korean capital Seoul; it lies inside a defile, with mountains on two sides, and commands a natural choke point across the main traditional invasion route from the North into Seoul. As such it has a continued military significance and it contains U.S. and Korean military bases, positioned for the defense of the Korean capital. The U.S. Second Infantry Division has established a headquarters post in Uijeongbu.
Despite being known for its military presence, the area has boomed into a satellite community of Seoul with the usual civilian infrastructure and amenities. For tourists, the most interesting are the local mountains such as Mt. Dobong, Mt. Surak and Mt. Soyo.
