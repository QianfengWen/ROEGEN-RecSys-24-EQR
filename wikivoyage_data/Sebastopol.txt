Sebastopol is in Sonoma County in the Bay Area of California.  It is named after the city of Sevastopol in the Crimea.


Understand[edit]
Sebastopol is a semi-rural town with an attractive downtown and sprawling farmland just outside the city edge. With a population of 7,700 (2019), it is a quaint but vibrant community that leans far to the left in its politics. Just north of Sebastopol is Graton, a small census-designated area with additional attractions, included below.
