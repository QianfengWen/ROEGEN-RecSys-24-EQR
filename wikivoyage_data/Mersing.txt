Beach near Mersing
Mersing town is on the east coast of the peninsular Malaysian state of Johor. It is 136 km northeast of the state capital Johor Bahru. It is a gateway to nature and traditional culture. Most tourists will use this town to get to Tioman Island. Mersing town is thus best known for its passenger boat jetty where boats depart daily for numerous offshore islands.


Understand[edit]
Despite its estimated population of 21,000, Mersing town should not be viewed as a mere stopover, a transient path to an offshore isle. The town possesses a quiet charm that in many ways represents a fast disappearing small-town culture that once pervaded all of Malaysia. It has yet to see any typical signs of major economic and urban development.
Two main roads run through the town. There only two junctions with traffic lights and only two traffic roundabouts. The two main roads are lined with traditional and modern shop houses that provide a range of modern services. There are traditional fruit sellers, grocers and modern supermarkets, plus a range of local restaurants and fast food outlets, several open 24-hours.
Mersing is a throwback to the small town look and temperament that existed in Malaysia some 20 or 30 years ago. There is little if at all in the way of chic clubs, cafes or shopping malls. The town's appeal lies rather in its out-of-doors, its slow-paced life and natural surroundings such as jungle reserves and unspoiled beaches, rocky coasts and offshore kelongs for pleasure angling. Air Papan and Penyabung beaches are about 15 and 30 minutes drive north of the town respectively. There you can glimpse the remaining vestiges of traditional seaside Malay village life. A must do is to circumambulate the centrally orientated hill that shoots up right behind the Hindu temple, very near to the roundabout, a short walk from the bridge.

Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
Several bus companies operate direct services to Mersing, e.g. Transnasional[dead link] from Kuala Lumpur, Melaka, and Singapore, while others that use the east coast highway (e.g. Johor Bahru to/from Kota Bahru) also call at Mersing.
From Melaka, take the S&S International from Central Bus Station (it's the only direct bus). Departure times are 8AM, 12:45 and 6:15PM. It takes about 4½ hours to arrive at the Mersing Bus Terminal (15 min walk to the island boats).
From Singapore, the cheapest way to Mersing is to first take a bus from Queen Street Bus Terminal) to Larkin terminal in Johor Bahru. It  takes about an hour off-peak. But it's important to note that direct onward buses from Larkin to Mersing are limited so get there in time to catch an early bus like 8:30AM, 9AM, 10AM, 11:30AM or 2:30PM (the latter being often too late to take the last ferry to Tioman). Buses heading to Kuantan will drop you off in Mersing. There is a direct Transnasional bus from Lavender Street Terminal. It could prove easier but it's three-times the cost. The first bus departs at 9AM and reaches Mersing by 1PM. You will likely need to book a day or more in advance.
When leaving Mersing, if you don't pre-book, the bus may be full. For travel to Johor Bahru (11:30AM) and Singapore (1PM), an alternative is to take the local bus to Kota Tinggi (less than 2 hr) and then another local bus to Johor Bahru's Larkin terminal (less than 1 hour), and then onward to Singapore (buses going all the time).
