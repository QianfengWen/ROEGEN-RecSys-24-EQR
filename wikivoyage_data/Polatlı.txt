Polatlı is a town and municipality in North Central Anatolia, 80 km west of central Ankara, with a population of 128,378 in 2022. It's agricultural, primarily producing grain, with other mixed industry. The main reasons to visit are memorials to the 1921 Battle of the Sakarya, and the ancient city of Gordion, inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2023.


Understand[edit]

"The retreat that started in Vienna on 13 September 1683 stopped 238 years later."
That comment by İsmail Habip Sevük refers to the steady loss of Ottoman territory to European powers since defeat at the gates of Vienna. And after the First World War, the Ottomans were on the losing side and their empire was abolished. Large tracts of mainland Turkey were thereby awarded to Greece and Italy, but the Greeks (with dreams of the bygone Hellenistic era) wanted more and marched on Ankara. They won a battle at Eskişehir and the Turks fell back to the Sakarya River near Polatlı, the last defensive position before Ankara itself. On 23 Aug 1921 battle was joined along the 100 km front defined by the river, the Greeks broke through, and Turkey's fate hung by a thread.
After 21 terrible days came a "victorious stalemate:" both armies were spent, but Greece had a worse problem with supply lines and winter was approaching, so they retreated. This was to prove their own Vienna, as Turkey led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk not only reinforced, but by making peace with Russia released troops from their eastern front. Smyrna on the west coast (nowadays Izmir), was the last Greek position to fall, and the Treaty of 1923 consolidated these gains and recognised the modern Republic of Turkey. 
This was by no means the first military campaign along the river valley. Gordion, 20 km northwest of Polatlı in the modern village of Yassıhüyük, was capital of the kingdom of Phrygia, which had its heyday around 1200-700 BC. ("Gordion", like "Istanbul", simply meant "the city".) It's best remembered for the legend of the Gordian knot: the oracles decreed that the next man to enter town on an ox-cart would be king. Gordias was the fellow who did so and his son Midas (the king with the golden fingers) enshrined the ox-cart in his palace, secured by a knot so intricate that whoever loosened it should rule all of Asia. The knot remained intact until Alexander the Great rolled up in 333 BC and severed it with his sword. He went on to dominate Asia as far as the Indus river. Legends like this always have pawky morals and political undertones, legitimising some dynasty over another: one message might be that negotiations with uncooperative local chieftains are resolved quicker if you reach for your sword.

You enter through a military cemetery: turn right for the museum, which exhibits photos and documents from the battle. Then a stairway between 21 pairs of slabs – one for each day and night of the battle – takes you to the flat top of the hill; the stairway is said to symbolize the unknown fate the battle would bring and the relief at its end. On the summit is the main statue of three figures. (updated Jan 2024)

She stayed at this house after the battle and documented the damage caused by the scorched earth policy of the retreating Greeks. Wax figures inside the house and in the garden portray the Turkish women's contribution to the war effort.

Gordion Museum is east edge of the village. It displays artifacts from the early Bronze Age through the early Phrygian to Roman periods. Among the latter is a 3rd century floor mosaic found in a nearby village, sized about 50 m2.
Midas Mound or the Great Tumulus is across the road from the museum, 50 m tall. Long thought to be the burial chamber of King Midas, it's now believed to be the tomb of his father Gordias. A long tunnel leads into the burial chamber. Huge juniper logs support the tons of dirt above – this part of Anatolia was rich in juniper forests, all but extinct now. Many other burial mounds dot the landscape to the east.
Citadel mound (Gordion Kalesi) 1.5 km southwest was the main settlement. After the Cimmerians, it was held awhile by the Lydians expanded from the southwest then the Persians. It was a road stop for the Romans, and occupied into medieval times. Adult 60 TL.   (updated Nov 2023)
