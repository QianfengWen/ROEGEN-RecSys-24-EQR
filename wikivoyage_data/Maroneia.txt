Modern village of Maronia
Maroneia was one of the wealthiest towns of ancient world along with nearby Abdera and Mesimvria. Nowadays it's a village appreciated for its surrounding beaches (Profitis Ilias, Alkyona, Mesi, Kageles and Molyvoti). The settlement of Maronia spreads over a vast area at the foot of Mount Ismaros. Several ancient monuments are excarved but others are still hidden throughout the olive groves and the mountainous landscapes of Ismaro.

History[edit]
Maroneia was founded in the mid-7th century BC on the slopes of Ismaros and soon developed into a prosperous and densely inhabited centre. Maroneia was close to the acient town of Ismaros, mentioned by Homer in the Odyssey. Some scholars identify Maroneia with his Ismaros. Homer has Odysseus plundering the city but sparing Maron, whom he identifies as a priest of Apollo. Maron presents Odysseus with a gift of wine, as well as with gold and silver. The strong wine was later used by him to numb the Cyclops. During the Classical period, the city had a strong fortification wall, 10 km long, from the coast up to the top of Ismaros. Maroneia was the largest and most important of all ancient Greek colonies of Western Thrace.
In the following centuries, under different rulers (Mazedonians, Romans, Byzantine), it prospered and was an important harbour town, but finally lost its importance in the late Byzantine and Ottoman periods.

The city flourished in the 5th and 4th century BC. During the period of the Macedonian and later Roman rule it began to lose importance, as the construction of roads in the hinterland lowered the importance of the coastal city and it's harbour. On the excavation site, the remains of the fortress wall with towers, private houses, a road network, public buildings, a sanctuary of Demeter and an Apollo temple were found. The most important monuments of the excavation site are: 1) The Shrine of Demeter. Inside the building, silver, gold, silver and gilded relief panels were found, all connected to the Demeter cult, dated to the 4th century BC. 2) The archaic temple of Apollo.
