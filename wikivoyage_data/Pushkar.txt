Pushkar is a holy city in Rajasthan, India famous for its Brahma temple, lake, ghats, and bazaar.

The Lake in Pushkar

Understand[edit]
Pushkar is a small holy town in the state of Rajasthan famous for the Pushkar Lake, various ghats and temples spread all around the lake.
Since being discovered by tourists the areas around the lake have filled with souvenir shops, cafes selling bhang lassis and hotels - you will find an interesting mix of pilgrims, Indian tourists and backpackers.
The word 'Pushkar' means lotus flower, which is said to be the seat of Brahma, one of the Hindu holy trinity, who is worshipped as the creator of this world. The legend has it that when the demon Vajra Nabha killed Brahma's children, Brahma in turn struck him with his weapon, a lotus flower. Vajra Nabha died from the impact, and the petals of the lotus fell at three places. One of them is Pushkar, where it gave birth to a lake. Brahma is supposed to have performed a sacrifice at this lake on Kartik Purnima (the full moon day of the Kartik month [which generally falls in November]), hallowing the place.
Though Brahma is considered to be the creator of the world in Hinduism, there are comparatively few temples dedicated to him, of which the one here in Pushkar is the most important. This is also considered as Adi Teerth or Teertharaj, meaning an ancient holy place or the most important of holy places, respectively.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The nearest airport is in Jaipur, 3 hours away.

By bus[edit]
There are direct buses between Pushkar and Ajmer (30 minutes, ₹20), Jaipur (3 hours, ₹220-410), Udaipur (6 hours, ₹450), and night buses to Delhi (10 hours, ₹400-850).

By train[edit]
Due to its mountainous location, trains to Pushkar are very infrequent and slow. However, the train station in nearby Ajmer provides great connections to most major cities in India. From the Ajmer train station, you can either take a taxi to Pushkar (30 minutes, ₹400-600 asked price), order a car via OlaCabs or Uber app (flat ₹500 by the taxi union, regardless of what the app says - December 2023), or you take a rickshaw or tuk-tuk to the Ajmer Bus Station and take a bus from there to Pushkar (₹20).

Get around[edit]
By foot[edit]
Pushkar is not so big and can easily be navigated on foot. Several companies offer spiritual walking tours, which can be an excellent way to see the many temples efficiently.

By cycle or motorbike[edit]
It is easy to rent cycles or motorbikes to explore the areas surrounding the town.

By camel[edit]
Camel safaris are a very popular activity in Pushkar. See listings below.

It is said to have been created by Lord Brahma and is therefore a place of pilgrimage for the Hindus. The lake is surrounded by 52 different ghats, or series of steps, which Hindus use to descend to the lake for ritual bathing, especially in the month of Karthik. 
Temples[edit]
While there are many temples in Pushkar, the majority do not allow foreigners/non-Hindus to enter. If you are allowed in, you will have to take off your shoes to enter the temples. If you only have the desire/time to visit 2 temples, the one-of-a-kind Brahma Temple and the Savitri Temple, with a beautiful view of Pushkar Lake, are must-sees.

Respect[edit]
The whole of town is considered to be sacred, so whatever rules generally apply to place of worship in India, apply to the whole of town.
Smoking in public is prohibited by law though the rule is never enforced enthusiastically.
Consumption of liquor or meat is not allowed in the city, therefore it is advised to respect the rule and not carry any liquor/ meat with you while travelling to Pushkar.
It is advised that the men wear full length pants and t-shirt/ shirt and women wear full length clothes. Do not wear off-shoulder tops or shorts while roaming within the city.
Take off your shoes at stairs if you are going near the lake.
Be polite, but do not be pressured into making any offering at the ghats. It is not mandatory.
Stay safe[edit]
See also Stay_safe
The city is small and quiet safe, but as a tourist destination it attracts the usual nuisances.

Use common sense, don't take risks you wouldn't be comfortable taking at home. Don't accept drinks or drugs from unknown men.
Beggars can pester tourists. Common tactics involve giving flowers, then demanding payment or demanding payment for prayers. Be firm as these people are not respecting the sacred city.
Children begging should be ignored entirely; giving to beggars sets a bad example for other children in school or working.
Ignore the many touts in the main street who approach you "just wanting to talk", "which country are you from", "hello friend".
