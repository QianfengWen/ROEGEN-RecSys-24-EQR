Tobelo is the capital of the North Halmahera district in the Maluku islands of Indonesia.  It is also the second largest town in the province of the North Maluku after the provincial capital, Ternate.


Understand[edit]
Tobelo and environs is predominantly Christian and this is expressed colourfully at Christmas with bamboo poles arching over the side of the roads hung with lights and multi-coloured flags. At Easter, local church congregations hold a competition to see who can create the best Easter garden.
Tobelo and environs boasts large swathes of locally owned coconut plantations, supplying hundreds of tonnes of copra (dried coconut flesh) every month to the ports of Bitung (North Sulawesi) and Surabaya (East Java).

Get in[edit]
Tobelo is accessible by ferry from Bitung (Manado), North Sulawesi.

1.806938127.9304371 Luari beach (Pantai Luari), Desa Luari (20 min north of Tobelo). A nice white sand beach right in front of Luari town. You can take a minibus there. Snorkelling is nice off the beach, in low tide however it's hard to swim across the shallow part without scratches. Snorkelling in front of the headland connected with a sandbar just north of the beach is even nicer. The beach may be very crowded on weekends and groups of schoolchildren may want to take many pictures with foreigners. (updated Jan 2021)
