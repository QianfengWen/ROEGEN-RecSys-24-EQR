King's College Chapel and punters on the River Cam, seen from The Backs.
Cambridge is a university city in Cambridgeshire in England. It is a city of crocuses and daffodils on the Backs, of green open spaces and cattle grazing only 500 yards (450 m) from the market square. Cows sometimes wander into the market area, since they are not fenced in. The Cambridge of Brooke, Byron, Newton and Rutherford, of the summer idyll of punts, 'bumps', cool willows and May Balls is worth seeing.


Understand[edit]
King's Parade in the centre of Cambridge, with the University Senate House on the left and Great St Mary's Church on the right.
Cambridge brings many images to mind: the breathtaking view of King's College Chapel from across the river Cam, the rich intricacy of Gothic architecture, students cycling to lectures, and lazy summer punting on the River Cam.
Cambridge manages to combine its role as an historic city with a world-renowned university and, since the 20th century, an internationally acknowledged centre of excellence for technology and science. The University of Cambridge was founded in 1209 by scholars leaving Oxford after a dispute with townsfolk. They chose the quiet town of Cambridge as a suitable location for study. In the 17th century Cambridge University educated many of the founders of an American university called Harvard, which is also in a place called Cambridge (named after the English university). Cambridge University has many famous alumni, including: mathematicians such as Sir Isaac Newton, scientists such as Stephen Hawking and Charles Darwin, philosophers such as Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein, and writers such as John Milton and Lord Byron. It was the site of Rutherford's pioneering work in nuclear physics, and Francis, Crick, and Watson's DNA work (see the Eagle pub below). Cambridge academics have won more Nobel Prizes than those of any other university in the world. The rumour that just one college, Trinity, had more Nobel prize-winners than France, however, is false.
The city is surrounded on all sides by heritage villages, towns and ancient monuments (such as Ely and Peterborough), all within easy travelling distance. Like Oxford, Cambridge was spared from the German carpet bombing that devastated many other British cities during World War II, and is thus one of the best-preserved medieval cities in the UK
More than 6 million visitors come to Cambridge every year to savour the delights of the historic city.  The city itself is quite compact with many of the main attractions in easy walking distance.  Cambridge is an ideal base for exploring some of the gentlest (read flattest; good for leisurely walks, poor for hills with viewpoints) and most unspoilt countryside in England.

Cambridge is mostly pedestrian-friendly: most sights can be easily reached on foot and much of the central area is traffic-free. Some of the pavements are shared use between pedestrians and cyclists; this can catch you out unless you watch out for it. Cambridge walking directions can be planned online with Google maps & other websites & apps. Students and locals often use bikes to get around and hiring a bike is a viable alternative to simply walking.
You can also opt for a hop-on, hop-off open-top sightseeing bus which provides commentary in several languages. The sightseeing bus passes the railway station, American Cemetery, and many of the historic colleges, but as the city centre is pedestrianised, it can approach the more central colleges on only Sundays.
There is little need to use the local bus services unless you are staying in a far-flung area of the city, but they are clean and efficient if you need to. Citi buses cost between £1 and £2 for individual cash fares within Cambridge City (change is given but drivers may refuse large denomination notes), contactless payments are available on most buses, but just tell the driver your destination as you board and take your ticket from the machine. The dominant bus operator is Stagecoach but Whippet also operate buses within the city and offer day tickets for their buses only. There is a multi operator bus day ticket available for £8 which you can purchase on the bus services of any participating operator. If you are arriving in Cambridge by rail, Plusbus tickets offer good value. 
Cambridge City Council discourages car use. Parking charges are high and although the hated rising bollards are now gone they have been replaced by bus gates and lanes which are monitored by cameras and fines are issued to unauthorised vehicles passing through them.
Uber ride-hailing is available, and there are many taxi companies in Cambridge.

Colleges[edit]




Focus on Architecture
Cambridge, especially the various colleges and university buildings, is fascinating for people with an interest in architecture. The colleges have been built sporadically over the centuries and the result is a mixture of styles both ancient and modern. Although the modern architecture is sometimes controversial, especially in how the newer buildings (fail to) harmonise with adjacent older buildings, it is in its way as interesting as the older. A tour of the backs (see above) gives the visitor a good feel for the various styles and a few small diversions add to the experience. One obvious landmark is the tower of the University Library. The library was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, who also built the Bankside Power Station in London that is now the Tate Modern. It does have a very industrial feel to it perhaps because of this. On the far side of the library the curious can see Robinson College, the newest college and built in about 1980 and one of the few pieces of modern architecture in Cambridge that has no notable old buildings nearby. If you prefer to see a blend of old and new, it is worth making the way out to Homerton College, which is fifteen minutes walk on Hills Road. Homerton College is particularly interesting as there are examples of various styles of architecture on-site such as the neo-Georgian buildings at the front of the college and the gothic Victorian hall on the inside of the college. This is an excellent place to take a stroll through the grounds which encompass an old orchard, water features and even a small honey farm, in order to appreciate the architecture from afar.
St John's College and Magdalene College also have a number of architectural treats. As well as the Bridge of Sighs, St John's has buildings in almost every style of architecture starting with the 16th-century hall in First Court and ending up with the extremely modern Cripps building. Near the Cripps building there is also the dramatic New Court built in the early 19th century and the School of Pythagoras, one of the oldest buildings in Cambridge which dates from the early 13th century.
Next door Magdalene College - cognoscenti know that Magdalene is accessible from the back of the Cripps building - is quite a contrast. Unlike St John's, which consists mainly of buildings designed as college accommodation, Magdalene has converted a number of old half-timbered inns as some of its accommodation. Magdalene also possesses the Lutyens building designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and the Pepys building. The latter, which houses the Pepys library, has an imposing and almost symmetrical facade and looks completely different from the rear. The ugliest Magdalene building, the 1970s Buckingham Court, is fortunately well hidden, while across the river the Magdalene Quayside development (1990) is an excellent example of how the late century architects appear to have learned subtlety and harmony. Quayside is an excellent place to rent a punt.
The Cambridge 2000 website has a list of 100 buildings that have notable architecture for one reason or another.


Cambridge has a number of interesting modern buildings, for example the Centre for Mathematical Sciences
Cambridge University consists of a number of semi-independent colleges, many central, some up to 3 mi (4.8 km) from the town centre (traditionally measured from Great St. Mary's church). The following are a good selection for sightseeing. Most of the colleges within the central area are worth a look, if you have the time.
Some colleges charge for entrance. It can be expensive, around £5 per person or more. If you're friends with a student, they're allowed to bring a visitor in for free. Colleges are typically closed to visitors during the University exam period, at the end of May and the first week of June.
Please remember to be respectful when visiting the colleges. They are students' homes for much of the year, and the workload and pressure at the University can be immense. Do not enter buildings you are not explicitly invited to, do not stare into people's windows, and be polite when taking photographs; be especially discreet in the libraries. Always remember that the colleges' role is first and foremost that of academic institutions; they are not there for tourists, and it is rude to do anything which impedes or inconveniences the people who live and work in them.

52.20480.11661 King's College and King's College Chapel, King's Parade, ☏ +44 1223 331212. College grounds open term-time M-F 9:30AM–3:30PM, Sa 9:30AM–3:15PM, Su 1:15PM–2:15PM and 5PM-5:30PM (summer only). Out of term M-Sa 9:30AM–4:30PM, Su 10AM-5PM. Grounds closed during exams (late April to mid June) though Chapel is open. Chapel opening times vary, ring for details. The most visited attraction in Cambridge, the architecture of King's College Chapel towers above the town and its world-famous choir have spread its reputation around the globe. £9 adults, £4.50 children/students.   (updated Sep 2019)
Queens' College, Old Hall
52.20220.11562 Queens' College, Silver Street/Queens' Lane, ☏ +44 1223 335511. Open approx 10AM-4:30PM, see website or ring for updated times. Closed mid-May to mid-June. Founded by two Queens - Margaret of Anjou in 1448 and Elizabeth Woodville in 1465, the College stretches across both sides of the Cam, linked by the famous Mathematical Bridge. The myth goes that it was designed by Isaac Newton without the use of pins, screws, nuts or bolts, but when disassembled, the fellows and students couldn't figure out how to put it back together again. This is sadly false, the bridge dates from 1749, 22 years after Newton's death. The stunning medieval Old Hall is also worth a visit. £5 (includes printed guide). Free mid-October to mid-March.   
52.20690.11683 Trinity College. Large attractive courtyard and library designed by Sir Christopher Wren. The interior of the Wren Library (M-F noon-2PM, Sa 10:30AM-12:30PM in Full Term) is particularly beautiful and features medieval bibles, items from the possession of Isaac Newton, original manuscripts by Wittgenstein, a Winnie-the-Pooh manuscript by A.A. Milne, and notes by Bertrand Russell, among other things. Even when the college is closed to visitors, the library may still be accessible from Queens Road on the other side of the River Cam. As of July 2022 the college is closed to the public. £2.   (updated Aug 2015)
52.2080.11734 St Johns College. Formerly the St Johns Hospital (13th century) before being refounded as a college in 1511, this college houses the oldest academic building in Cambridge (the "School of Pythagoras"). It has a number of large courtyards, and has the Cambridge "Bridge of Sighs". As of July 2022 the college is closed to the public. Adult £10.   (updated Sep 2019)
52.20860.12335 Jesus College. Attractive grounds and sculptures scattered throughout.   
52.2020.11986 Pembroke College. The 3rd oldest college in Cambridge, founded in 1347 by the Countess of Pembroke, Marie de St Paul, is well known for its beautiful gardens.   
52.20510.11527 Clare College. The 2nd oldest college with pretty gardens, courtyard and the oldest river bridge in Cambridge.   
52.20080.11828 Peterhouse. The oldest Cambridge college was founded in 1284 and has two large gardens, the Scholars' Garden and the Deer Park, both of which students and visitors can walk all over (unusual for Cambridge colleges!)   
52.203040.117439 Saint Catharine's College. St Catharine's College was founded in 1473 by Robert Wodelarke, Provost of King's College. The college was christened in honour of the patron saint of learning and used to be known as Katharine Hall. It was largely rebuilt in the 17th century with work on the Main Court beginning in 1673; the Chapel was completed in 1704. In spite of its modest size, the college's three-sided brick Main Court is almost unique among Cambridge colleges and deserves a short stop while strolling down Trumpington Street. The college is in the very centre of Cambridge next to King's College and facing Corpus Christi College.   
52.18550.138110 Homerton College. Homerton College is one of the newer colleges, though it has existed for centuries as an academic institution and is architecturally very pretty, with extensive and tranquil grounds and a picturesque orchard. It is in a beautiful location on Hills Road, about 15 minutes walk from the town centre. The Victorian hall here is one of the most beautiful in Cambridge and definitely worth a visit. Free to enter, so worth the walk to see.   
52.20290.1177511 Corpus Christi College, Corpus Christi College, Trumpington St, CB2 1RH. Uniquely, founded by Cambridge locals (from two town guilds). Its Old Court (to the left of the main entrance, behind St Bene't's church) dates from the 1350s and is the oldest courtyard in Cambridge. Old Court rooms have no plumbing, so you may occasionally be treated to a student walking across the court in their dressing gown to get to the toilet complex.   
52.2009930.10548712 Selwyn College, Grange Rd, CB3 9DQ. Founded in 1882, Selwyn is one of the newer Cambridge colleges. Its buildings and grounds are excellent examples of Gothic Revival architecture and it has been named one of the “most obviously impressive” of 68 listed buildings in the West Cambridge Conservation Area appraisal. Entering through the Porter's Lodge Gate on Grange Road puts you in the attractive Old Court with its manicured lawn surrounded by red brick, turreted buildings. The gate next to the college chapel leads into the Selwyn gardens. Selwyn College is located less than a ten-minute walk south of the Cambridge Library, and is about 250 m from the Museum of Classical Archaeology. Free.   (updated Feb 2017)
Parks and gardens[edit]
52.20510.111713 The Backs. The gardens by the river behind various colleges. Heading downstream from King's you can pass through the gardens of Clare, Trinity and St John's Colleges (which has the "Bridge of Sighs"). 
52.19330.127214 Botanic Garden of Cambridge University, Bateman St CB2 1JF, ☏ +44 1223 336265. Nov-Jan: 10AM-4PM, Feb-Mar and Oct: 10AM-5PM, Apr-Sept: 10AM-6PM, closed 24 Dec to 1 Jan. A relaxing way to spend a few hours, away from the hustle and bustle of the colleges and canals. Open to the public since 1846 this garden hosts some important botanic collections amongst its 10,000 or more species. In summer they have concerts on the lawn. Adult admission £7.20, children and Cambridge University students free.   (updated Apr 2023)
52.2120.122515 Jesus Green. Jesus Green was proposed as the site for Cambridge's main railway station, but is now a broad piece of parkland immediately adjacent to Midsummer Common. Provides a quiet retreat away from the city centre, and has grass and hard tennis courts, and an outdoor swimming pool. Plans are underway for redevelopment of this much-loved park in Cambridge.   
52.20210.128116 Parker's Piece. One of the best known open spaces in Cambridge. In the centre of the city, it is bordered by Park Terrace, Regent Terrace, Parkside and Gonville Place. 
52.20610.125117 Christ's Pieces. In the centre of the city, it is bordered by the bus station, Christ's College, Emmanuel Road and King Street. It is of typical Victorian park design with tree lined avenues. The formal seasonal bedding displays planted in the 'petal beds' near Emmanuel Road, provide all year round colour. There are also large ornamental shrub beds around the perimeter to add further year round colour and interest. 
52.198470.11659718 Coe Fen. A beautiful, semi-wild green near the centre of the city, but far enough out to be quiet. Less manicured than some of the college gardens and parks around Cambridge, but nonetheless a great space to be in the summer with cows roaming and the Cam running through. 
Museums and galleries[edit]
The Fitzwilliam Museum

The bequest also included £100,000 "to cause to be erected a good substantial museum repository". The "Founder's Building" itself was designed by George Basevi, completed by C. R. Cockerell and opened in 1848; the entrance hall is by Edward Middleton Barry and was completed in 1875. The Egyptian Galleries at the Fitzwilliam Museum re-opened in 2006 after a two-year, £1.5 million programme of refurbishment, conservation and research.

Blue plaque to Rupert Brooke in Granchester
52.1770.09641 Grantchester: "The women there do all they ought, the men observe the Rules of Thought...." - Rupert Brooke (1887-1915) was in Berlin when he wrote this semi-comic paean to the village. It's 3 miles south and upstream from Cambridge, a pleasant afternoon stroll or punt. The Church of St Mary and St Andrew (C of E) dates from 12th century, with several distinguished figures in its graveyard. There are thatched cottages, several pubs, and the famous Orchard Tea Gardens, open daily 10AM-6PM. The orchard was planted in 1868; in 1897 a group of student visitors asked if they could take tea there rather on the lawn, and this became a fashion. Brooke took up lodging at The Orchard in 1909 and attracted a glittering coterie: They love the Good, they worship Truth, they laugh uproariously in youth . . . Continue upstream to the pool below the weir at the confluence of the Cam and Brook. This was frequented by Europe's most famous "wild swimmer" Lord Byron.

Do[edit]
Punting is a popular activity in Cambridge
Explore the backs. It's free, and gives you a real flavour of the city. You can walk through King's College, onto King's Parade, a beautiful row of exclusive shops. You can also experience the backs by punt which is extremely popular.
Punting. 9:30AM-dusk daily. If anything is stereotypically 'Cambridge', this is it. Punting involves propelling a flat bottomed boat with a long wooden pole (quant) by pushing a pole against the shallow river bottom. For the full effect, take strawberries and Champagne to quaff as you glide effortlessly down the river. You can either travel along the famous College Backs or head out towards the village of Grantchester. Guided tours are also available from around £20.00 per person on the day. Save by booking online at (Traditional Punting Company, Let's Go Punting, Rutherford's Punting Cambridge, Scudamore's and Cambridge Chauffeur Punts. If you're up for more of an adventure, try it out for yourself on a self-hire boat (typically about £30/hour for an entire punt, so can be a lot cheaper if you are part of a group). Punting to Grantchester (upriver) takes about an hour and a half for an experienced punter or tour, and the complete journey takes much longer for first-timers. Along the Grantchester route there are riverbanks on the way for mooring up with meadowland suitable for picnics (Note that pranksters have been known to push unattended punts out into the river.)
Draw the Cambridge Catby recording a GPS track on a 19 km route along major roads
Walking tours. Guided walking tours are available all year round with a range of walking tours to choose from. These tours can be tailored to suit group interest with the central tourist office. There is also the option to experience Cambridge virtually with some University Colleges providing their own tours. These include King's College and St John's College with a
Rowing. Cambridge is renowned for rowing on the Cam. All colleges and some schools have their own clubs, and there are over half a dozen large 'town' clubs. There are a number of regattas and head races on the river throughout the year, though the highlight in the rowing calendar on the Cam is the annual bumping races. For College crews, the 'May' bumps are in June, for the local clubs, this normally is the fourth week in July. Over four evenings of racing (Tuesday - Friday), eights attempt to gain higher position by catching the crew ahead of them before being 'bumped' by the crew behind. Races take place downstream (north) of the city, between the A-14 road bridge and the railway bridge at Stourbridge Common, and are best viewed from the towpath alongside the river, or from the Plough pub in Fen Ditton, both accessible by foot from the town centre - words of warning though - if on the towpath side, be careful for the massive number of bikes that accompany the crews racing, if in the pub, you may not get a seat, and beer prices are at a premium.
Cycling. Rent a bicycle and bike the mostly flat terrain around Cambridge. Popular destinations are Grantchester (3 km), American Cemetery (5 km), along River Cam towpath to Milton Country Park (5 km), Wicken Fen (12 km), Duxford Imperial War Museum especially during air-shows (15 km) and Ely (23 km).

Sleep[edit]
There is a range of options for accommodation in the city, although not so many for the budget traveller. In addition to guesthouses and hotels, there is a youth hostel and the option of staying in one of the rooms in a college. These rooms can be old with fantastic original features; they're a great base from which to explore the city. Outside of term, these will often be rooms which students have vacated for the holidays. Colleges can be contacted directly for information on accommodation in college, or they can be booked through UniversityRooms.

Stay safe[edit]
Although Cambridge is one of the safer cities in the UK, you should use your common sense at night and be careful in badly-lit areas outside the city centre. As of 2019, pick-pockets are taking advantage of the throngs of tourists on King's Parade and the nearby shops; keep an eye on valuables. It is wise to be on your guard around Regent Street & St Andrew's Street after midnight with anti-social behaviour due to people leaving pubs and nightclubs.
Bicycle theft is an ongoing problem. If you have a bike, keep it locked up to a solid object with a strong lock (preferably a D-lock), as cycle theft is big business. There are cycle parking places with cycle stands to lock you bike to, in several places around the city centre and at the railway station. "Secure" covered cycle parking with CCTV surveillance and cycle stands is available in the lower section of the Park Street car park and at the Grand Arcade cycle park.
The city's police station is on Parkside which is next door to the city's fire station. The opening times of the enquiry office is every day 8AM-10PM and bank holidays 9AM-5PM. There are a couple of smaller stations in the nearby villages of Histon and Sawston. The opening time of the enquiry office is for Histon, Mondays; 4PM-8PM, Wednesdays to Fridays; 8AM - midday, with Tuesdays, weekends and bank holidays closed. For Sawston, it is Wednesdays to Friday; 1PM-5PM, Mondays, weekends and bank holidays closed. The non-emergency contact number is 101, calls are fixed rate of £0.15 on landlines and mobiles.
The city's Accident and Emergency department (Casualty department) is located at Addenbrooke's Hospital on Hills Road, south of the city centre.

Connect[edit]
As of July 2022, Cambridge has 4G from all UK carriers, and you might get 5G with EE, O2 or Three. Wifi is widely available in public places.

Grantchester: Take a day trip to enjoy the countryside and have scones and tea at The Orchard.  With a long history of famous patrons such as Rupert Brooke, Virginia Woolf, EM Forster and Bertrand Russell, taking tea in The Orchard is a well established tradition.  This large garden planted with apple trees is perfect for lounging on a deck chair in the sun with a cup of tea and a scone for sustenance. Or head out by punt with a picnic hamper.
Great and Little Gransden Glimpse the real England! Take a bus (30 mins or so, bus no. 18, or 18A) from Drummer Street to the tiny ancient villages of Little and Great Gransden, which appear in the Magna Carta. Brimming with thatched cottage charm, horses and peaceful country walks, these villages offer escape into English village life.  Pub food is available in both villages.  Explore the ancient churchyards, the doll path in the meadow between them, and enjoy a leisurely hike around this tranquil village area.  The Duncombe Arms in neighbouring Waresly serves excellent food, and offers BnB accommodation.  Waresly is one- or two-hour walk from the riding stables at the bottom of Great Gransden.  You could even join a horse trek.  The undulating road offers wonderful views across farm land, and the ancient Waresly Wood, some of which is National Trust property. The 17th century open trestle post mill Windmill between The Gransden villages is unusually intact.  It was last operational in 1912.
Ely: Market town, with impressive Cathedral towering above the Fens (Ely used to be an island): regular trains and buses (9, X9, 12), or about two hours by cycle via NCN 51 to NCN 11.
King's Lynn is well worth visiting for its wealth of architectural gems especially Nelson Street and Tuesday Market place. The explorer Vancouver came from here. Museums and churches and the largest brass in the country in St Mary's Church.
Newmarket: Market town (in Suffolk), with a famous horse-racing venue, and everything horsey related including the National Horseracing Museum. Tu-Su 11AM-4:30PM (22 March - 30 October). Hourly trains and regular buses (10, 11, 12), or about two hours by cycle on NCN 51.
