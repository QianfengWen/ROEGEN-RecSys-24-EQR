Northallerton is the county town of North Yorkshire in England. With a population in 2011 of 16,832, it has light industry, local government employment, a large hospital, Friarage, and the Leeming RAF base. Most visits will be related to those, as the town, though pleasant enough, lacks "sights" and attractions. But it's a possible base for touring the North York Moors, the Vale of York, and the northern part of the Yorkshire Dales.

Well preserved priory, founded in 1398 under Richard II. They were just in time for that dynasty to be overthrown by Henry IV, so they were on short commons until affiliating to the Carthusian order. These monks lived as hermits, who didn't normally dine or attend church together. What remains are the two cloisters and the church. After the Dissolution of 1539, much of the masonry was recycled into a 17th-century manor house, and a mansion built in 1900 in Arts & Crafts style. These aren't open to the public.
