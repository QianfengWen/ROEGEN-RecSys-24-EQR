Tombs of Talpur rulers
Hyderabad, population 1.7 million (2017), is the second largest city of Sindh province and the 8th largest city in Pakistan. Lying along the River Indus, it is rich in culture, traditions and history. It was the capital of Sindh for many centuries, and used to be known as the Paris of India, due to belief that streets of the city were washed every morning with clean drinking water from the River Indus. Hyderabad is now an important commercial and cultural center, and serves as a transit between the rural and the urban Sindh. Noteworthy sights in Hyderabad include the tombs of the Kalhora and Talpur rulers, two royal fortresses, and the miles-long bustling and colourful Shahi Bazaar.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Hyderabad's early history dates back to a small fishing village on the River Indus known as Neroon Kot, named after its local Sindhi ruler Neroon.
Later, Hyderabad was founded in 1768 by Kalhora ruler Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhoro on the ruins of Neroon Kot and the city was made capital of Sindh. It started to expand, progressed and flourished, and obtained the nickname of Heart of the Mehran as the Kalhora ruler Mian Ghulam Shah was said to have fallen in love with the city. After the death of the last Kalhoro ruler, the Talpur dynasty conquered the region. The city expanded, progressed and flourished more under the Talpur rulers. Talpur rule lasted until 1843, when the British colonial empire conquered the region, making the city into part of the Bombay Presidency of the empire.
After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India, while the Muslims refugees from India were settled in refugee camps in Hyderabad. Nearly all Hindus of Hyderabad left for India due to better socio-economic prospects in India. The massive migration of Muhajirs into Pakistan after the independence of Pakistan in 1947 raised the population levels of the city to an extreme. The late 1980s saw a black period in the history of Hyderabad, as riots and violence broke out between the Muhajirs and Sindhi nationalist parties, due to which the social fabric of the city was damaged. Until 1955 the city of Hyderabad served as the capital of Sindh province, which was later dissolved and Karachi was made the capital of Sindh.

Hyderabad has a relatively mountainous climate, somewhat more pleasant than other parts of Central Sindh throughout the year. Summer and winter are the two main seasons, while spring and autumn are very short. The period from mid-April to late June is the hottest time of the year with temperatures as high as 48.5 °C. Winters are usually warm, around 25°C during the day time and often below 10 °C at night, and are the best time to visit the city. The highest ever recorded temperature in Hyderabad is 48.5°C in 1991, while the lowest is 1°C in 2012.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Hyderabad is connected with rest of Pakistan through National Highways # N-5 and  # N-55 (the Indus Highway). Travellers coming from the north of Pakistan, usually prefer to come via the N-5, whereas travellers coming from the north-west of Pakistan prefer to use the N-55. Hyderabad is connected with Karachi both via a highway and motorway but travel by the M-9  motorway (Super Highway) is preferred. It's 150km long and the journey take about two hours.

By bus[edit]
Plenty of air-conditioned and non-air-conditioned buses and vans run to Hyderabad from other major cities of Pakistan. A journey from Karachi cost around Rs 200 (non-air-conditioned) or Rs 250 (air-conditioned), whereas from Sukkur the price is Rs 500 (non air-conditioned) or Rs 700 (air-conditioned).

By train[edit]
Outside the railway station
Hyderabad has railway connections with almost all the major Pakistani cities and towns. Most trains travelling between Karachi and rest of the country make a brief stop at Hyderabad. Hyderabad station is a major railway junction, the largest and busiest station in Pakistan besides Karachi.
If you're travelling from northern Punjab with both speed and comfort as a priority, the Karakoram Express is one of the best choices. This train runs daily non-stop between Lahore and Karachi and is faster than other trains, taking less than 20 hours travel time, because it makes only a few stops, whereas other trains make stops at every major station along the route and are usually delayed as well. The Karakoram Express has both economy and air-con class accommodation. A ticket (berth) on the Karakoram Express in air-con class will cost not more than Rs 5,000.
Other than that, plenty of trains (both economy and air-conditioned class) run from Lahore as well other major big cities such as Peshawar, Faisalabad, Multan, Quetta, and Rawalpindi on a daily basis. But expect them to be slower, as they make stops at every railway station along the way. Tezgam or Shalimar Express have air-conditioned class so are best preferred for travellers from Punjab; other air-conditioned class trains are Khyber Mail for travelers from Peshawar, The Bolan Mail is recommended for travellers from Quetta, although this train calls at Kotri railway station.

25.38113568.3735331 Hyderabad Junction railway station (حیدرآباد جنکشن ریلوے اسٹیشن). Main station where most trains call.   (updated Jun 2020)
25.3671468.297752 Kotri Junction railway station (کوٹری جنکشن ریلوے اسٹیشن). Smaller suburban station, a few long distance trains only call here.   (updated Jun 2020)
Get around[edit]
Transportation is by private car, taxi, or rickshaw.
Unlike in Karachi, black and white taxis do not operate in Hyderabad. Taxis are generally private cars and operated by taxi companies, so they cannot be hailed on streets, since distinguishing between a taxi and a private car may be difficult. You can ask at a hotels to arrange a taxi, or call the taxi company offices. These taxis are usually air-conditioned, modern and clean fleet which makes them the most comfortable, luxurious way to navigate around the city of Hyderabad especially in the blistering hot weather of Summer.
Rickshaws provide cheap and quick transportation within the city. Shared rickshaws, which are somewhat different from a traditional motorcycle rickshaw, are another option.
There are plans for metro bus and train systems to be built.

Pakka Qila fort
Map of Hyderabad (Pakistan)
25.384468.37271 Pakka Qila (Hyderabad Fort), Makki Shah Rd. Pakka Qila ("strong fort") was built on one of the three hills on which the city was built by the Kalhoro ruler Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhoro during the 17th century. Though today the massive historic fort is badly maintained and deteriorating, it still is the most notable landmark of Hyderabad, and a must-see from outside at the least. Most of the area inside the compound is inhabited by refugees from the 1947 population exchange. The construction of the fort was begin in 1766 AD and completed by 1768. Later, the Talpur rulers conquered Hyderabad and settled inside the fort, until they were defeated by the British in 1843. The main gate of the fort is still there for visitors to see and take photographs. The fort was built using fire-baked bricks giving it the name of the strong fort.

However, it used unbaked clay bricks, as opposed to fired baked bricks with which Pakka Qila was built. Thus the name Kacha Qila which means "weak fort". The fort is now in a very desolated state. Today, most people head to the fort to visit the shrine of Makki Shah built on the hill of the fort. Both the Pakka Qila and Kacha Qila are deteriorated and in a desolate state now, but they are good examples of early modern fortifications.
