Temagami is a municipality of 800 people (2016) in Northern Ontario, and a place of natural beauty.  Old-growth pine stands provide a magnificent backdrop for a day's hike.  Canoeing the calming waters can be just what you need to relax and get away from the pressures of city living.


Understand[edit]

The Temagami region is known as n'Daki Menan, the homeland of the Temagami First Nation, the area's Aboriginal community, most of whom are Anishnaabe (Ojibwe), living on Bear Island. 
The Municipality of Temagami includes the communities of Lake Temagami, Marten River, and Temagami North.

History[edit]
The Anishnabai have been living in the area for at least 6,000 years after migrating from the east coast of North America. The land was divided into familial hunting and trapping territories.

Anima Island
Since the main east-west fur trade route bypassed Temagami to the south, settlement of this area by Europeans did not come until 1834. That year the Hudson's Bay Company built a store on Temagami Island, which was later relocated to Bear Island. The town was founded by Dan O'Connor, who in 1903 formed a steamship company on the lake and established its first store on the future townsite. By 1906, he had built three hotels on Lake Temagami: Hotel Ronnoco, Temagami Inn, and Lady Evelyn Hotel.
Discoveries of gold, copper, nickel, and particularly silver in 1903, brought mining to nearby Cobalt and accelerated development of the region. Several mines opened in Temagami, including Big Dan Mine, Little Dan Mine, Barton Mine, Hermiston-McCauley Mine, Temagami-Lorrain Mine, Priest Mine, Beanland Mine, Sherman Mine, Kanichee Mine, Northland Pyrite Mine and Copperfields Mine, which once mined the richest copper ore in Canada.
In 1898, the 15,000-km² Temagami Forest Reserve was established. Because of this reserve, the region was home to the last old growth forests in Ontario. Logging of the vast pine stands only began in the 1920s. Now just a few patches of old growth remain, including the White Bear Forest (12.42 km²) and the world's largest stand of old-growth red and white pine forest - the Wakimika Triangle Forest (25 km²). This has led to confrontation between loggers and environmentalists when new logging access roads are built or major logging operations are proposed. Access to many old-growth areas is provided on local hiking trails and canoe routes.

Stay safe[edit]
A word to the wise: that photo on the winter driving page asking "How many trucks do you see?" was taken near Temagami. Summer driving has the hazard of large wildlife; if your car hits a moose, you will probably need a new car, so stay alert while driving at any time of the year.
