Hahei is a seaside town in Mercury Bay on the east side of the Coromandel Peninsula in northern New Zealand. Cruising boats depart for trips to Te Whanganui-A-Hei Marine Reserve and its abundant sea-life. Hahei is a popular holiday destination, with a white sandy beach and sheltered aspect, resulting in safe sheltered swimming waters. The famous Hot Water Beach, where geothermal springs come up through the sand around low tide, is 6 km away.


Understand[edit]
Cathedral Cove
Coromandel Peninsula is on the north-eastern coast of the North Island, due east from Auckland. Hahei's resident population is around 300, but in peak holiday periods the population swells nine times. The town centre has a gift shop, a general store with a petrol station and a takeaways bar, and a dive shop. Holiday-related businesses include kayaking, snorkelling and boat trips to Cathedral Cove and the Marine Reserve.

Get in[edit]
Turn off the main road between Tairua and Whitianga at Whenuakite. About half way from there to Hahei, a road turns off to Hot Water Beach. Hahei is a 40-minute drive from Whitianga, and a 15-minute drive from Ferry Landing, which is a short passenger ferry trip from Whitianga.

By bus[edit]
Go Kiwi runs a once per day shuttle from Auckland via Auckland Airport.

-36.881667175.821 Hot Water Beach (6 km from Hahei). Water from two hot springs comes up through the sand on one part of the beach within two hours each side of low tide and you can dig your own hot pool. At the points where the water comes up, it is about 64°C (147°F), which is too hot to bathe in, so you need to dig a pool a little further away and let the hot water run down into it. Spades for hire at the cafes for $5.   (updated Apr 2017)
