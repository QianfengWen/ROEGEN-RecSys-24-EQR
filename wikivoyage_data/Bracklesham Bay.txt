Bracklesham Bay is a 200-hectare (500-acre) biological and geological Site of Special Scientific Interest in West Sussex. It is a coastal bay on the west side of the Manhood Peninsula known for windsurfing, kitesurfing, and scuba diving in the wrecks off the shore. The bay looks out onto the English Channel and the Isle of Wight is visible from the beach, as is the Nab Tower lighthouse and the Spinnaker Tower in Portsmouth.


Understand[edit]
Bracklesham Bay is a bay on the southwest coast of the Manhood Peninsular.  The villages of Bracklesham, East Wittering and West Wittering are on or close to the shore.  The majority of the shore is shingle bank with exposed sand at low tide and forms part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) up to and including the Medmerry Nature reserve near Selsey.  West Wittering is known for sandy beaches.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Road access is from the A286 from Chichester to Birdham. The B2198 and B2179 then form a loop round the villages. The nearest petrol station is at Birdham. When closed the next closest are at Siddlesham and Chichester.

By bus[edit]
A high-frequency bus service operates from Chichester (the closest rail station) and Birdham up to every 15 minutes. The Stagecoach South service 52 loops via Bracklesham, East Wittering and West Wittering, the service 53 loops via the reverse route. Compass service 150 also passes through the area from Selsey very infrequently.

By bike[edit]
A cycle route, Salterns Way, goes from Chichester to West Wittering then to the sand dunes of East Head. A portion of the cycle route is along busy roads. Access to West Itchenor is also possible from a small pedestrian and cycle ferry from Old Bosham.
