Ames is a pleasant college town in Central Iowa, sitting astride the Skunk River roughly 30 miles north of Des Moines. Life in Ames follows the ebb and flow of the academic year at Iowa State University, which is the city's primary draw.


Understand[edit]
Named after Massachusetts congressman and transcontinental railroad supporter Oakes Ames, the city was founded as a stop along one of the primary rail links to the first transcontinental railroad. The railroad is still a daily part of life in Ames, with nearly 70 Union Pacific long-haul freight trains passing through town each day.

Traveling from the north (e.g., Minneapolis, 2.5-hr drive) or from the south (Des Moines, 30 minutes), take I-35 to exit 113 and drive west along 13th Street into town. Or take US 30 (exit 111) west to South Duff or University Boulevard and go north into town. Traveling from the east (Chicago, 5.5 hours) or from the west (Omaha, 2 hours), take I-80 to I-35, and then I-35 north and as above. US 30 also reaches Ames direct from Omaha and Chicago.

By bus[edit]
Burlington Trailways and Jefferson Lines both serve the 42.0213-93.65231 Ames Intermodal Facility, +1 515 232-2404, at 129 Hayward Avenue, a block south of the Iowa State University campus in the Campustown neighborhood. Jefferson Lines directly connects Ames to destinations north and south along I-35, while Trailways directly links Ames to Des Moines and destinations east along US 30.

By plane[edit]
There is no commercial aviation to Ames; the nearest major airport is located in Des Moines. Shuttle service is available to/from Ames; Executive Express offers a relatively frequent scheduled service. If flying via charter or general aviation, one can use the 41.9991-93.62342 Ames Municipal Airport on the southern edge of town, south of Airport Rd; from there automobile is the best bet into town – a Hertz rental car location is available at the airport.

Get around[edit]
Lincoln Way is the main east-west thoroughfare of the city, passing just south of Downtown (the historic center of town, north of the train tracks between Grand and Duff Avenues) and continuing west to Campustown (the neighborhood immediately south of the ISU campus) along the southern edge of the central campus of ISU.  Similarly, 13th Street runs from I-35 across the northern edges of the downtown area and the university campus.  Main north-south roads include Duff Avenue (south of Lincoln Way) and Grand Avenue (north of Lincoln Way) which together carry U.S. Hwy 69 through Ames, University Boulevard and North/South Dakota Avenues.
The city-university partnership CyRide[dead link] provides bus service in Ames. Service hours can be limited (particularly during weekends and school breaks), but the system does a decent job covering the city and is very reliable. Fare is $1.25 ($0.60 for children/seniors).
Ames is very bicycle friendly, with a moderately extensive paved trail system for walking and biking.  Apart from ISU itself, there are generally three main pedestrian-friendly concentrations of shops and restaurants: Downtown along Main St between Clark and Duff Avenues, Campustown along Welch Ave south of Lincoln Way, and the much newer Somerset neighborhood directly north of the ISU campus along Stange Ave north of 24th St. Not quite so pedestrian friendly is the two miles of big box stores and strip malls along Duff Avenue between US 30 on the south and Lincoln Way on the north.

See[edit]
The Downtown district, along Main Street between Grand and Duff Avenues (just north of Lincoln Way and the train tracks), is the historic center of town and makes for a pleasant stroll. The district has most of Ames' civic functions, such as the city hall, the library, and the main post office. Main Street is lined with charming old brick buildings holding small shops and restaurants and often hosts events such as a local farmers' market. At the east end of Downtown on Duff Avenue, in the shadow of Ames' power plant, is 42.0265-93.60961 Bandshell Park, a pleasant square that regularly holds concerts in the summer months.
