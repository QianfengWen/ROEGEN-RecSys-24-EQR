 Saint Francis of Assisi Church (Parroquia de San Francisco de Asís). The city's most distinctive feature is the Baroque-style parish church in the centre of the city. It was built from 1742–1775, from piedra braza. It is topped with two slender neoclassical towers, 63 m in height each, and three airy domes. The façade is dominated by a curious architectural element: a semi-hexagonal portico, which was added as a support for the heavy and slender towers. On the inside, it is decorated by the main altar, constructed entirely of white marble from Carrara, and the sculptures of the four Evangelists. The sculptural group of La Piedad was carved in oak wood by Agustín Espinoza. 
Other notable sites include the kiosk that sits on the Plaza de Armas in downtown (ornamented with iron, it was built in France, and brought to the city), the Temple of San Antonio, and the city hall (Palacio Municipal) built in neoclassic-baroque style.

Do[edit]
Cerro de la Campana, to the northwest of the city, is a rugged formation perfect for cross country sports such as mountain biking. The hill has been designated as the venue  of the state mountain biking championship. Near this hill is, bordering from the north-west part, the Río Verde canyon. Climbing and camping are perfect activities to carry out in this place of breathtaking magnitude and nature.

Festivals[edit]
Feria Tepabril - April 25 to April 30, the town's biggest celebration of the year honors El Señor de la Misericordia with masses in the Parroquia de San Francisco as well as nightly concerts drawing big-name musical performers.
