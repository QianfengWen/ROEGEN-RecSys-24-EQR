Old Coal Mine Museum
Madrid[dead link] is a small town in North Central New Mexico, south of Santa Fe.


Understand[edit]
The town's name is stressed on the first syllable.
Madrid, New Mexico was founded as a coal-mining community in the 19th century, and was a major supplier of coal for the U.S. Government and for the Santa Fe Railroad.  Madrid flourished into the 1930s, with a large Independence Day parade, a Christmas display which attracted visitors from all over the state, and the first lighted stadium in the Southwest.  The town declined with the falloff in coal usage until the mines were closed in the 1950s;  Madrid never became a true ghost town (it was never completely abandoned), but by 1970 its population had dropped to 30.  However, starting in the 1970s, the area became a magnet for creative artists.  Madrid is now a small but thriving art colony numbering 200 or more.

Stay safe[edit]
Do not enter any abandoned mine structures (most have been locked since the town's revival anyway); they have been known to collapse, and also fill up with 'coal damp' (methane) that can exclude breathable air.
Get in[edit]
State Highway 14, from Santa Fe, passes through downtown Madrid.  To reach town from Albuquerque, take I-40 eastbound, get off at the Tijeras exit, and proceed north on SR 14. The closest bus route[dead link] is several miles farther north.
Get around[edit]
Parking is scarce and pedestrian areas are not generally grade-separated from vehicles -- stay alert whether traversing the town in a vehicle or under one's own power.
See[edit]
Every December, Madrid hosts a townwide Christmas celebration with a parade, lighting displays, carolers and costumes.
