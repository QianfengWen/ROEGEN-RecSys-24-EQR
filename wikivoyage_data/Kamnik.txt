Kamnik[dead link] is a town in Central Slovenia. Once a rival to Ljubljana and Kranj for economic dominance of Carniola, today's Kamnik (Stein in German) is a sleepy suburb of Ljubljana, with a population of just over 14,000 (2018).

The rooftops of Kamnik from Mali grad

Understand[edit]
While there is some modern sprawl to the south, the medieval Old Town (Staro mesto) has been wonderfully preserved and makes this town well worth a visit.
Orienting yourself in Kamnik is easy enough.  Most medieval buildings line the pedestrian street of Šutna, and its northern end lie Mali grad and the city square of Glavni trg.  To the east runs the Kamniška Bistrica river and across it are the ruins of the Old Castle.

The chapel of Mali grad rising above town
Old Town[edit]
It roughly covers the area from the southern end of Šutna (pedestrian zone), over glavni trg, up to medvedova ulica in the northern part of the city center (including some of the side roads) and offers many very nice historic buildings.

46.22456714.6119441 Mali grad (roughly at the center of the historic old town, access to mali grad is possible from Samčev predor (where Šutna is cut into the hill)). The "Small Castle" may lie in ruins, but the chapel next to it is still in one piece and, with its shapely curves and hilltop location, has become Kamnik's symbol. Entry into the chapel, featuring some 16th-century frescoes, but views from the hill over the red roofs of the town are free.   
46.22399114.6167272 Stari grad (30-min hike from trailhead off Maistrova ul (when coming from the old city, take the bridge at the end of Usnjarka cesta (where the Spar supermarket is), cross the street and go some 50 m to the left, the trail starts at the end of the wall). Literally the "Old Castle", this 13th-century structure now lies in ruins. Half the fun is the hike up the hill, through a forest and a meadow; keep an eye out for miniature cascade of water through pinwheels halfway up. Up top, you'll be rewarded with commanding views over the plains north to the Alps and south all the way to Ljubljana. The newest feature is a sightseeing platform that stands out and allows to reach farther out.  
46.22330714.6056253 Medobčinski muzej Kamnik, Musejska pot (on the Zaprice Hill in the centre (go the pedestrian street Šutna up to the southernmost end, where you hit the main road, turn right, cross the rails and walk up the hill)), ☏ +386 1 8317 647.

Jelovšek and K. von Goldenstein, the oil paintings are created by Valentin Metzinger. During Christmas time, a nativity scene is on display. (updated Aug 2016)

Go next[edit]
Cities:

Ljubljana - Slovenia's capital and cultural and economic centre
Kranj - the third out of the formerly three competing cities of the region (Kamnik, Ljubljana, Kranj), now also mostly a suburb to Ljubljana, but having a nice location and a great old city centre
Maribor - the second bigger city in Slovenia, nicely located at the Drava river, European Capital of Culture 2012, with a very nice city core
Celje – Slovenia's third biggest city, dating back to Hallstadt era and showing settlement also in Roman times, it is still home to a nice old town while being similarly sleepy as Kamnik, can be reached by a slow but nice drive through one of the two valleys heading Eastwads
Škofja Loka - another of the somewhat bigger cities in Slovenia having a great Medieval old town
Nature and sports and to some extent history of the region:

Cerklje na Gorenjskem (West of Kamnik) with Krvavec (one of the more notable mountains, home to a ski resort in winter and bike park in summer) is "just over the hills"
Luče the municipality just north-north-east of Kamnik which has some nice mountains and smaller sights (such as for example a very old, still operational water mill)
Solčava/Logarska Dolina (North of Kamnik and Luče), often also dubbed the Green Valley, is the last valley in Slovenia south of the Austrian border in the region. Near in kilometers but some passes and hence quite some time away. Old farms and village cores are worth seeing.
