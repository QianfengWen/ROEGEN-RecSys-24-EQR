Erzincan is a city in Eastern Anatolia. It's modern, on a grid pattern, as its predecessor was destroyed by an earthquake in 1939. In 2022 its population was 150,714.


Understand[edit]
The city stands at 1185 m altitude and has a continental climate, with a baking sun in summer and thick snow in winter. It's in a well-watered valley with agriculture and historic trade routes. In antiquity this region was Acilisene, part of Armenia, on the cusp between Persian and Byzantine control. Its heyday was in the 11th century, but it dwindled under Seljuk rule, and was wrecked by war and earthquake in the 13th century. It came under Ottoman control from the early 16th century.
For the next 400 years the Ottomans were a mighty force across south Europe and the Mediterranean, and Erzincan was a backwater, but that Empire was collapsing by the onset of the First World War in 1914. Turkey's rulers convinced themselves that the Armenians would side with the opposition to seize independence, and commenced systematic massacres to forestall this. Those in cities like Erzincan who survived were sent on death marches across the Syrian desert to concentration camps. Meanwhile the Russian army advanced into Erzincan, and held it until 13 Feb 1918 - the "13 Şubat" commemorated in the name of a main boulevard.
On 27 December 1939 Erzincan suffered an earthquake of magnitude 7.8, the largest ever recorded in Turkey, and equalled only by the 2023 Gaziantep quake. Some 20,000 died at the time, and another 10,000 in the following months from aftershocks and floods. The ruined city was therefore abandoned, and rebuilt on higher ground a few km north. This means that it has 20th century architecture on a grid pattern, and lacks the higgledy-piggledy medieval alleys and ancient buildings seen in other cities.

See[edit]
Statue of Atatürk
39.746739.4911 Dörtyol means "four roads" and it's the city's main intersection and plaza. Halit Paşa Cd joins from the west and becomes Fevzi Paşa Cd, 13 Şubat Cd joins from the south and becomes Ordu Cd. It's by no means scenic, but it's the obvious reference and rendezvous point. No statue of Atatürk? - don't worry, he's 500 m north along Ordu Cd.
39.749239.49732 Grand Mosque (Ulu Cami) has a pleasant courtyard.
39.745339.5043 Terzibaba Mosque at the junction of Fevzi Paşa Cd and 793rd Sk is vast and modern. Many Turkish mosques are modern but in retro-Ottoman style, but this one from outside looks like a congress hall.
39.764439.50914 Esentepe is a hill and public park with a view over the city.
39.71972239.6197225 Ekşisu  is a park with mineral springs and picnic area (piknik tesisleri).
39.696439.64676 Altıntepe Höyük 12 km east of the city is a volcanic hillock that was inhabited for millennia. Best preserved is its Byzantine church, but of most archaeological interest is its Urartian settlement from 9th to 7th century BCE. The site is under excavation and in 2023 remains closed to visitors.
39.5859439.730877 Girlevik Waterfalls  (Şelalesi) are 30 km southeast of the city. They're not a single drop, but several cascades descending 30-40 m. The area is a park, free to enter 24 hours.
39.67277840.2877788 Üçpınar  (meaning "three springs") was once the Armenian village of Abrank (Ապրանք), but in 1915 that community was variously massacred, deported or fled. Two km south is the ruined 13th century Surp Tavit (Saint David) Monastery. By it are two 6-m tall khachkars, elaborately carved Armenian memorial stones: probably the finest still standing in Turkey, and maybe the tallest in the world. The approach road is in bad shape, so hike from the village rather than breaking an axle.
39.77805640.3859 Tercan (100 km east). This town has an impressive 12th-century caravanserai established by Mama Hatun, a female ruler of the Saltukids, a regional dynasty contemporary with the Sultanate of Rum. It was re-modelled in early Ottoman times and has lodging, secure storage for merchandise and stables ranged around a central courtyard. Another circular courtyard contains the dynastic tombs.
