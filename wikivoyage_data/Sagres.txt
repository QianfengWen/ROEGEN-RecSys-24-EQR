The Fortress of Sagres
Sagres (/ˈsa.gɾɨʃ/, SAH-gr(ih)sh) is a civil parish in the municipality of Vila do Bispo. It is the alleged location of the nautical school first developed by Prince Henry the Navigator in the early 1400s. The school itself is vanished; In May 1587, Sir Francis Drake disembarked 800 men who assaulted the Sagres fortress. After two hours of intense combat, the fortress was destroyed and its artillery was pillaged. Salema is also in Vila do Bispo municipality.
