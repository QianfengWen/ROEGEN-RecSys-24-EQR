Mount Dora is a city in Lake County, Florida. It is a charming town consisting of 1,400 named lakes.  Situated on rolling hilly terrain, Mount Dora sits 184 feet (56 m) above sea level on beautiful Lake Dora which is part of the Harris chain of lakes, including Lake Beauclaire, Lake Eustis, Lake Griffin, Lake Harris and Lake Yale.
Mount Dora is a short drive from the Walt Disney World area, Orlando, Ocala, and the beaches (on both coasts).


Understand[edit]
Mount Dora has been nicknamed "The New England of the South", "The City of Parks", "Antique City", and "The Festival City". Even Money Magazine seemed enthused, naming Mount Dora in their "Top Places to Live Today". With a population of around 12,000, it still holds a small town appeal, but provides many options in shopping, restaurants, and things to do and see.
In Mount Dora's early history, citrus was its major industry and even though you can still get a glorious whiff of the fragrant white blossom of the orange tree in springtime, as tourism has grown in importance, the relative importance of citrus has decreased. Mount Dora was the primary setting of the 1981 comedy film Honky Tonk Freeway, a box-office flop, though trivia enthusiasts will enjoy the fact that the entire town was painted pink for the movie (some remnants of which can still be seen today).
The downtown is on the side of a hill, sloping down to the lake, and there are pretty and immaculately maintained shops and restaurants in the center of downtown.
