Nelson is a town and civil parish in the Borough of Pendle in Lancashire. It was developed as a mill town during the industrial revolution, but today has lost much of its industry.

“Nelson is undoubtedly a modern town. Fifty years ago it was entirely unknown, and no mention of it appears in any books dealing with the ancient history of the County.” — Preston Guardian, 12 Feb 1881
It has some of the lowest house prices in the country. It does have some good walks and lovely parks, good access to recreational activities and good transport links.
Nelson is minutes by car to some breathtaking countryside such as Barley, Roughlee and Newchurch which are steeped in history, provide excellent walks and some fine country pubs.  A beautiful view of Pendle Hill  can be seen from many areas of Nelson.

Understand[edit]

Nelson's a typical gritty, Lancastrian industrial town built on the cotton weaving industry and in terminal decline for more than thirty years.
In the 1820s, between the towns of Burnley and Colne there was a coaching inn called the Lord Nelson. Just off the road was a tiny village called Marsden. As the Lancashire cotton industry grew, a town started to grow around the inn and the nearby station on the new East Lancashire Railway, and it took its name from the inn. Nelson grew at a very fast rate, and  soon swallowed up both the villages of Marsden and Lomershaye. Consequently, Nelson is probably the only town of any size in the entire British Isles that's named after a pub!
Nelson's peak population of 39,841 in 1921 has now dwindled to less than 29,000 and it has lost most of its industry. The town had a heavily redeveloped and fully pedestrianised centre, but the main road through the town was converted back to a road in 2011 to try to boost trade.
There's ample parking in the centre, including a multi-storey car park with a covered walkway connecting it to the shopping precinct. There's a railway station with hourly trains to Burnley, Blackburn, Preston and Blackpool in one direction, and Colne in the other. The bus station has been renovated.
However, it's not all doom and gloom. Radical left-wing politics in the early 20th century led to Nelson being labelled "Little Moscow" by the local and national press and fully 13.8% of the population described themselves as Pakistani at the last census, so it's a great place for a political debate over a curry and, possibly as a result of so much social deprivation, it does have some of the lowest house prices in England.
According to Wikipedia, the "... town is strikingly segregated: the Marsden ward, which in 2006 elected the borough's first British National Party councillor, is 96.58% White, while the Whitefield ward is 68.72% Asian or Asian British."

The damp East Lancashire climate was ideal for production of cotton goods but in Nelson, unlike the larger surrounding towns, the emphasis was on weaving rather than spinning. Nelson no longer has its own meteorological station.
As you can see from the blue sky in the thumbnail images below, it doesn't rain all the time in Nelson!

The postage stamp collection may be of particular interest to philatelists. There's a tiger skin which was shot in the Saugor area in 1915 together with clothes worn by E.M. Forster when he was secretary to H.H. The Maharajah of Dewas State, Senior. The uniform of Field Marshal Sir Claude Auchinleck is prominently displayed and, quite poignantly considering that the centre of the cotton textile industry has now shifted to India and Pakistan, the last Union Flag to be lowered at the Residency, Lucknow in 1947 is exhibited. Adult: £3.50, child: 50p. 
Queen Street Mill is just a few hundred yards south of Nelson's municipal boundary

The 19th-century steam engine, which had powered the looms in Queen Street's weaving shed, has developed a fault and is out of operation. There are still weaving demonstrations of their looms in the warehouse area. Like most mills in East Lancashire, Queen Street Mill specialised in producing plain cotton calico known as 'grey cloth'. The architecture of the mill was designed to allow this process to be carried out as efficiently as possible. Ample free parking; café serving snacks and light refreshments; toilets include disabled and baby change facilities with full access for disabled users (visitors with guide dogs welcome). £3, Burnley residents and accompanied children get free entry.   
Marsden Park is the largest park in Pendle, with many historical and architectural features which include a pseudo-Roman spa bath, an ornamental pond and marsh area, a circular garden, sensory garden and a Lady's Garden.

Victoria Park was first awarded a prestigious Green Flag in 2009, and has maintained its flag ever since. It is designated a district park and covers over eight hectares of land.

Carr Road (B 6249), Nelson, off Barrowford Road (A 6068) BB9 6DG.
Barnoldswick is a village off A56 that was historically in Yorkshire, but transferred to Lancashire in 1974. The main reason to visit is Bancroft Mill, and to stroll the Leeds-Liverpool canal along its summit section.
53.911-2.1923 Bancroft Mill Engine Museum, Gillians Lane, Barnoldswick BB18 5QR. Steam-powered weaving shed opened in 1914; it closed in 1978 and was mostly demolished, but the engine that powered the looms has been preserved and is occasionally in steam. Adult £3.  (updated Jul 2021)

Drink[edit]
Station Hotel, Hibson Rd is no longer a hotel - just Nelson's largest pub
53.8354-2.21481 Station Hotel ('station' or 'spoons' because it used to be one of the "Wetherspoons" chain years ago), Hibson Rd  BB9 9SB (Hibson Road junction with Broadway). Grade II listed building dated 1893, with minor late 20th century alterations and with carved lettering: "STATION HOTEL" in the ashlar dressing. Much original interior detailing survives, including wall panelling, door joinery and finely-detailed surrounds, ornamental plasterwork, hearths and hearth surrounds, together with screens to all the principal bar areas. This consciously-detailed railway hotel was built at the height of Nelson's rapid industrial development and deliberately designed to impress those arriving in Nelson by rail. Probably the biggest public house in the neighbourhood and now a Freehouse.

Stay safe[edit]
Backstreet off Edward Street
There are some rough areas as in any town but people are generally friendly and welcoming.
It is generally safe in the town centre at night which is mainly because there isn't much going on, there are a couple of pubs one of which is fronted by the pedestrianised town centre area which has smokers hanging around the front entrance while they smoke, Nelson has many hot food takeaways with late night opening which generates lots of traffic and parked car mayhem but in general is quite safe.

Connect[edit]
Many buildings used for worship have been demolished or their usage changed
As of July 2021, Nelson and Colne have 4G from all UK carriers. 5G has not yet reached this area.
