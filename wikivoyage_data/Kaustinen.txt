Kaustinen (Swedish: Kaustby) in Central Ostrobothnia is known for its huge yearly folk music festival. The municipality with some 4,300 inhabitants welcomes thousands of guests during the festival. The municipality of Veteli to the south of Kaustinen is also handled in this article.


Understand[edit]

The folk music festival has become the main draw of the municipality. While otherwise perhaps typical countryside, with farming and some industry, the festival has led to a disproportionate number of skilled musicians. Many have grown up with the folk music tradition, continued music studies in the Sibelius Akademy, now fusing their classical music carrier with their interest in folk music. This makes for some surprising twists in some of the concerts, while otherwise true to a living folk music tradition. Also interest in related fields, such as folk dance and local history has greatly benefited from the development.
