Tidal Boatworks, Digby
Digby is a blue collar town that is home to a fleet of sea scallop trawlers. It has a number of dive bars, and waterfront patio restaurants serving the fleet's famous catch. It was named after Admiral Robert Digby.

History[edit]
Digby was called Oositookun, meaning "ear of land" by the Mi'kmaq First Nations (Aboriginal) people. A small group of New England Planters settled in the area of the town in the 1760s, naming it Conway. Digby was settled and surveyed as a town in June 1783 by the United Empire Loyalists under the leadership of Sir Robert Digby.
The town developed a sizable shipping fleet in the 19th century. The town became an important regional transportation centre in the 1890s with the arrival of the Dominion Atlantic Railway. Trains connected with a series of steamships such as the City of Monticello and later the SS Princess Helene.
