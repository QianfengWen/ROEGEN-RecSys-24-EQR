Understand[edit]
Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
SJ runs daily trains from Stockholm as well as seasonal night trains during the summer months and on some major winter holidays. Additionally, Snälltåget runs night trains from Malmö via Stockholm during winter. From Trondheim in Norway, a quick change of trains in Storlien is required. 63.39874513.0766431 Station Åre is centrally located and includes a shopping galleria.

By plane[edit]
63.19416714.5019442 Åre Östersund Airport (OSD IATA)
This is the nearest airport. There are domestic flights operating daily from Stockholm to Åre Östersund Airport (SAS), direct bus from the airport to Åre costs about €25 one way. In skiing season EasyJet flies directly from London. There are also charter flights from London, Moscow, Helsinki and Copenhagen.
63.454810.91873 Trondheim Airport Værnes (TRD IATA)
You can also fly to Værnes Airport outside Trondheim in Norway. International flights from London, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Copenhagen and 16 other European cities.
In the skiing season (December 15th – May 1st) there is a Flygtaxi airport transfer four times a day. 400 kr for one adult one way.
At the airport you take the local train to Hell (takes about 2 min). Or walk 1½ km (1 mile).
In Hell you take the train "Mittnabotåget" direct to Åre Railway station, it is worth checking the time of departure from Hell as the train only runs twice a day (in both directions). Generally there is a morning train at around 09:00 and an evening train at around 17:00. Avoid arriving at Hell station too far in advance as it is far less comfortable than waiting a few hours in a cafe at Vaernes airport!
If possible, pre-book your train tickets (from station "Værnes" to station "Åre"). The ticket price is 145 kr one way although there are discounts for students.

You can charter a helicopter to pick you up at Værnes Airport in Trondheim, Norway (40 min) or at Åre-Östersund Airport on Frösön (22 min).

Åre is easily accessible by car. Beware though, that most of the Scandinavian Peninsula will be ice and/or snow covered in the winter season, except for the southernmost Scania province. Snow tires are mandatory in winter.

Do[edit]
Skiing[edit]
The ski area is on the Åreskutan mountain with its highest peak at a height of 1420 meters, but the highest lift ends at 1260 meters, so the peak has to be reached by a snowmobile lift. The village and ski area are accessible by bus and train.The Telemixlift "VM8" in the World championship areaThe Åre ski area contains three different areas. These are:
63.38865513.1531931 Björnen — Family friendly and laid back. Featuring long blue slopes and a big children's area.
63.39906813.0809722 Central Åre and Högzon (High zone) (Also including Rödkullen) — The biggest area, where also most of the people are which sometimes means there are long queues to the lifts. Best before lunch, when the pistes are in their prime condition and many people have not gotten out of their cabins yet.
63.40082812.9764383 Duved-Tegefjäll — Some of the best slopes in the entire system. Long, perfect slopes and not many people. The 6-chair express lift takes you to the top in no-time. For an easy and fun off-piste experience, take the 6-chair lift to the top, go straight right and down the ravine, a fun and fairly easy off-piste run which features a naturally shaped halfpipe.
There is one ski pass for all the four different systems; however, a separate ski pass can be bought for those who only wish to ski in Duved-Tegefjäll at a cheaper price. Pistemap[dead link]
