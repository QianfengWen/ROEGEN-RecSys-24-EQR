Understand[edit]
View of Newfoundland off the Strait of Belle Isle from Blanc-Sablon
Blanc-Sablon is a municipality of the "Basse-Côte-Nord" located on the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence near the entrance to the Strait of Belle Isle. It is bordered by Labrador to the east. With a population of over 1100 inhabitants, it is the most populous municipality in the regional county municipality of Golfe-du-Saint-Laurent.
The municipality of Blanc-Sablon is made up of three villages: Blanc-Sablon, to the east, Lourdes-de-Blanc-Sablon, to the centre, and the Brador, to the west.
The village of Blanc-Sablon is located on the bay of Blanc-Sablon. Lourdes-de-Blanc-Sablon is the largest community in the municipality and is located on the peninsula that separates the bays of Brador and Blanc-Sablon. It includes the airport. The place is also called Longue-Pointe. Finally, the village of Brador is located on the east coast of the bay of the same name, 7 km (4.3 mi) from the village of Lourdes-de-Blanc-Sablon. Formerly it was known as Fort Pontchartrain.

History[edit]
Early European explorers called the place "blanc sablon" because of the fine sand found there, "sablon" meaning "sand" in Old French. Jacques Cartier mentions the name of the place on his first trip in 1534. Thus, it is possible that he was inspired by the Blancs-Sablons cove in Saint-Malo in France where he was born. The Basque and Portuguese fishermen already frequented the region during the 16th and 17th centuries. The first French-Canadian and Acadian settlers arrived around the beginning of the 19th century.
Laid out on a peninsula jutting south into the Strait of Belle-Isle, Lourdes-de-Blanc-Sablon was the seat of the Vicar Apostolic of Labrador. The village of Lourdes was mainly populated by a French-speaking community and Blanc-Sablon (and the surrounding posts, Bradore, Salmond-Bay, Rivière-Saint-Paul, etc.), by an English-speaking community.
The Catholic church of Lourdes-de-Blanc-Sablon was built in 1895 with a steeple by the Eudist fathers and destroyed by fire in 1963. The old presbytery was built next to it. The first truck in Blanc-Sablon arrived in 1947. The first snowmobile arrived in Blanc-Sablon around 1964; this vehicle for traveling on snow has become popular. Previously, the dogs pulled the sleds and the horse served as animal traction for travel. The Hudson's Bay Co. operated a general store in Blanc-Sablon; there was a flotilla of trawlers in front of the company buildings. In the past, the Blanc-Sablon wharf was served by trawlers and schooners.
At the beginning of the 20th century, the Job & Brothers company operated a salt cod warehouse in Blanc-Sablon, with a community kitchen, a shop for merchandise and fishing tackle, a stable and a workshop. The workers were drying the cod there. The Job & Brothers forge and sawmill were built in 1909 by Georges Hobbs. In 1983, Blanc-Sablon was equipped with a multi-purpose processing plant equipped with a large freezing and storage capacity, with a service and wintering centre for fishing boats.
Formerly, the men worked in particular with the cutting of the firewood, practiced hunting in particular with the seals and repaired the fishing nets. Each family had a family garden in which to grow certain vegetables: potatoes, green vegetables (cabbage, cauliflower, turnips), but no carrots or tomatoes. Many of them went to work in the iron mines in Shefferville, which began operating in 1954. From the 20th century, Lourdes airport played a key role in economic development, supplies, transport services health, and exchanges with the outside world. Residents have always been dependent on supplies by boat.
Before the arrival of electricity, people lit themselves with kerosene lamps. Before the arrival of the telephone system, citizens used the telegraph line to communicate, especially between villages; however, the system was unreliable due to distances, atmospheric conditions and the technology of the time. The rural telephone cable and a telephone exchange were installed in the mid-1960s by Québec-Téléphone. At the time, each telephone line had several subscribers in rural areas; and one or two subscribers near the telephone exchange. The radio was used to communicate with other villages on the coast and the boats.
In the past, the main holidays celebrated in Blanc-Sablon were Saint-Jean-Baptiste (June 24), the procession for Corpus Christi, the feast of Saint Anne. The Blanc-Sablon region has a long history of stranded ships.
