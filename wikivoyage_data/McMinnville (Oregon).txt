McMinnville is a city in the Willamette Valley in Oregon.  It is the county seat and largest city of Yamhill County.


Understand[edit]




The Spruce Goose
A local museum hosts perhaps one of the most bizarre aircraft ever produced. Howard Hughes, an eccentric rich person, had gotten it into his head to build a transatlantic freight flying boat in order to sell it on lucrative military contracts as a cargo airplane. However, due to wartime restrictions on the availability of aluminum, the prototype had to be built from birchwood to achieve a lightweight airframe. The prototype only ever achieved a single test flight in 1947 (by which point all hope of military contracts was of course gone) but remained the holder of the "largest wingspan of any aircraft" record into the 2010s.


Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Private automobile is the easiest way in to McMinnville. State Highway 99W enters from the north and south. State Highway 18 bypasses town along the south from its junction with Hwy 99W southwest of town and ends at Hwy 99W east of town.

45.2036-123.1431 Evergreen Aviation Museum, 500 NE Capt. Michael King Smith Way, ☏ +1 503-434-4180. Daily 9AM-5PM. Closed on major holidays. This is really three attractions in one: museums of aviation and space travel, and an IMAX theatre. Howard Hughes' H-4 (HK-1) Flying Boat, better known as the Spruce Goose, is the most well-known, but there are over 60 other aircraft and spacecraft to see. The space museum has a pleasantly even-handed coverage of the international history of space exploration, with unique exhibits such as an ICBM in a simulated silo. There is a good café here. Enough to see that aviation fans will want a whole day. $27 both museums and 1 movie; discounts for youth, seniors, and veterans.   (updated Jul 2017)
