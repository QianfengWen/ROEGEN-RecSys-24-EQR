Vejle is a city of 61,000 people (2023) in Jutland, part of the Kolding–Vejle–Fredericia triangle. Vejle is most known for its forested hills, fjord, harbour, shopping, pedestrian mall, and windmill.


Understand[edit]
Development of new architecture, art and alternative town spaces throughout the 1990s has made the city an attraction. Vejle was the first city in Denmark, which had its own official architecture policy to set high standards for the urban development.
Vejle is the regional capital of South Jutland, one of the 5 Danish regions.

History[edit]
The first recorded mention of the town is from 1256, and the first known merchant town privileges were issued by King Valdemar III in 1327. During the Middle Ages, Vejle was important as a market town, and developed along those lines up to the mid-17th century, trading with cities such as Lübeck and Flensburg, in what is now Germany.
In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, Vejle's population was diminished as a consequence of plague and war. The town expanded throughout the 19th century, benefiting from improvements such as a new harbour on the fjord, a railway station, and modern utilities. From the mid-19th century into the 20th century, Vejle developed from a provincial market town into a busy industrial centre, eventually becoming known as the "Manchester of Denmark" for its many cotton mills.
