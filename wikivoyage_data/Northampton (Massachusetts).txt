Understanding[edit]

Long-time residents nickname Northampton "Hamp," while newer residents tend to call it "NoHo." Another nickname for Northampton is the "Paradise City", after opera singer Jenny Lind remarked that Northampton was "the paradise of America."
The Town of Northampton (originally named Nonotuck) was granted its charter in 1654; the City of Northampton was incorporated in 1884.
