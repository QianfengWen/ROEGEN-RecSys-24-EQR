Perast is a small city in Montenegro.

Sveti Đorđe (St. George) Island, as seen from Gospa od Škrpjela
This is a small quiet town with a population of less than 400 where you can escape Montenegro's the busier seaside resorts such as Kotor bay and Budva and enjoy a couple of leisurely hours strolling through the streets, and visiting a few museums and churches. It has a beautiful view towards the peaks around Kotor, and from here you can go to the small island in the bay, with a small monastery.


Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The main road bypasses the town by going above it. There is only one drivable road in Perast. 
During the summer season, it is required to leave your car in the parking right at the entrance to town (and pay for it), because the road is very narrow and most parking spaces are private or already taken.
Perast has two large parking lots located at both entrances to the city. Only locals and guests of hotels and apartments with their own parking are allowed to enter with their cars.
During the winter season, parking is free and it is possible to enter the city by car.

By bus[edit]
Perast is reachable by bus and car from Kotor (15-45 min drive).
From Kotor's old town, the bus stops at the southern end of the fresh market (no actual bus stop, look for people waiting around the light poles). In Perast, there are two bus stops, one at each end of the town outside the gates. Look for the Blue Line local buses, which cost only €1 per ride. You can pay the fare on the bus. As of 2023 the Blue Line buses picked up passengers hourly at 20 past the hour (heading toward Kotor) until 22:30. To ensure the bus stops, it is advised to wave it down, otherwise it will not always stop.
Other (long-distance) buses travelling between Kotor and Perast might also stop, if you wait and wave on the main road to Perast, and take you to Perast. There are also several open tourist buses driving along the coast after the hop-on hop-off principle. It stops here as well.

By boat[edit]
Several boat trips from Kotor and Budva takes you through the bay and sets you off at the small island church of Our Lady of the Rock. Here you have a view towards Perast town itself and the surrounding bay area. These boat trips are found many places along the beaches of Kotor and Budva.
