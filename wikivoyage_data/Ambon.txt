Ambon is an island in the Maluku region of Indonesia and also the name of its largest city: Ambon City. The island consists of two regions: Ambon City and Central Maluku Regency.

Provincial government office of Maluku in the city of Ambon.

Understand[edit]
Ambon, the provincial capital of Maluku, is built on a hillside overlooking the bay. It has a number of interesting historical and cultural sites, among them the remnants of forts built by the Dutch East Indies Company during the heyday of the spice trade. The ruins of the Portuguese fort at Hila are almost entirely hidden beneath the contorted roots of a giant banyan tree. The ANZAC War Cemetery near Ambon town is the site of services held every year on April 25, to commemorate the Allied soldiers who died in the region during World War II. 

History[edit]
The origin of the name Ambon is also very difficult to trace. According to local residents, the name Ambon comes from the word ombong in Ambonese language which means dew because the mountains on the island of Ambon are always dewy or foggy in the morning.
The history of Ambon began with the arrival of the Portuguese in 1512. The Portuguese were the first Europeans to land in Ambon, and it became the new centre for Portuguese activities in Maluku following their expulsion from Ternate. The Portuguese, however, were regularly attacked by native Muslims on the island's northern coast, in particular, Hitu, which had trading and religious links with major port cities on Java's north coast. Then, the Portuguese built a fort in the Ambon area as a place of activity in trade and the spread of religion. As the first Europeans to arrive, the Portuguese mobilized their inhabitants to build a fort called Benteng Kota Laha (Fort Laha). The birthday or anniversary of the city of Ambon has been decided to fall on September 7, 1575, in a seminar in Ambon City. 
Ambon was the headquarters of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) from 1610 to 1619 until the founding of Batavia (now Jakarta) by the Dutch. Ambon city was the site of a major Dutch military base that Imperial Japanese forces captured from Allied forces in the World War II Battle of Ambon in 1942. The battle was followed by the summary execution of more than 300 Allied prisoners of war in the Laha massacre.
Sectarian tensions between the Muslims and Christians erupted in the wake of the fall of Suharto in 1998, resulting in numerous violent clashes between the two groups, and the deaths of thousands of people. An agreement mediated by the Indonesian government was signed between the Christians and Muslims in 2002 to end the violence, and while sporadic clashes have occurred, the area has settled into an uneasy peace. The Indonesian government and numerous NGOs have been trying to promote dialogue between the Muslim and Christian communities in an effort to make the peace a lasting one. As of 2022, things are much more peaceful and Ambon received an award as among the Top 10 most tolerant cities in Indonesia by the Setara Institute.
Ambon became the first city in Southeast Asia to be recognized as the UNESCO Creative Cities for music category in 2019 and has been called Ambon the City of Music and is known as Indonesia's music city.

People[edit]
Ambon prides itself on being a multi-racial island. Ambon's population consists of, the majority of the native Moluccas including Ambonese, Alfur, Kei, Tanimbarese, and mixed of Arab-Ambonese, Dutch-Ambonese, Portuguese-Ambonese, Spanish-Ambonese, also other Indonesian such as Chinese-Indonesian, Buginese, Butonese, Flores, Javanese, Makassarese,  Minang, Papuan, and Sundanese. Christianity is the majority religion in Ambon at about 60% of the population, with Islam in second place at about 39%, and the rest being a smattering of other religions.
