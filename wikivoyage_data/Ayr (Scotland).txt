Ayr is a town in Ayrshire on the coast of South West Scotland, with a population of 46,260 in 2020. Its chief attraction for visitors is the nearby village of Alloway, birthplace of Robert Burns. Ayr is also near Culzean Castle and the golf course at Turnberry. It was the county town until Ayrshire was divided into east, north and south council areas. Ayr now only hosts the South Ayrshire local government. 


Understand[edit]
Tam o'Shanter flees across the Brig o'Doon
Ayrshire is mostly lowland and fertile, and Ayr grew up as the market town for the nearby farm villages, but it was also industrial from the 17th century with local deposits of coal. It had a defensible river crossing and harbour, one of several ports that flourished before the Clyde was made navigable up to Glasgow. A major industry was smuggling: there were many quiet beaches where goods "for export" could be run ashore on moonless nights. And there was also illicit trade with England and its colonies, before the 1707 Union ended the embargo against Scotland.
One of those farm villages three miles south was Alloway, now a suburb of Ayr, and on 25 Jan 1759 it was the birthplace of Robert Burns. His family lived in the same cramped farm cottage until he was seven, then moved to a series of other farms near Tarbolton and Mauchline, always on the verge of poverty. Robert began writing poetry, chasing the women and drinking, not necessarily in that order; he was on the verge of emigrating to the West Indies when his first poetry collection was published in 1786. He was prolific and famous even within his short lifetime, and is now revered as Scotland’s national poet. 
You’re bound to know Auld Lang Syne, but if you don’t know Burns' other works, essential reading is Tam O’Shanter (and you’ll need a Lallans glossary to translate the dialect.) Tam is a poor useless sort of farmer, and one dark wet night he's riding home from Ayr market, drunk as usual, when he sees strange lights in the derelict old church of Alloway. Creeping closer, he beholds witches dancing in a satanic party, and there’s one very fit young witch clad only in a skimpy shirt - a "cutty sark". Tam’s ribald shout to her is the biggest mistake of his prattish life, and it may well be his last.
Ayr's main sight is thus the Burns Heritage Park at Alloway comprising a museum in the cottage where he was born, the Auld Kirk (that spooky derelict old church), the Burns Monument and Gardens, and the ancient bridge Brig o’Doon where Tam fled from the witches. You'll know you're there when you see lots of coaches in the parking lot: summer in Alloway can be very congested. There isn't a physical tourist office but What's On Ayrshire post local information 

Get in[edit]

Ayr is on the main road and rail route between Glasgow and Stranraer. With your own car from Glasgow follow A77. From England take M6 then A75 to Dumfries, A76 to Cumnock, then A71 into Ayr. 

By plane[edit]
Glasgow Airport (GLA IATA), 6 miles west of central Glasgow on M8, has the best connections. It has flights from many UK and European cities, including the Hebridean islands. There are regular direct flights from Canada but other long-haul destinations usually involve changing planes in London or Amsterdam. There is a pre-bookable shuttle bus to GLA from Ayr, otherwise travel via central Glasgow.
55.5092-4.61241 Prestwick Airport (PIK IATA) is only 4 miles from Ayr, but only has Ryanair flights to Med holiday destinations such as Barcelona and Tenerife, nothing within the UK. The Ayr-Glasgow trains call here, as does the X77 bus, see below. Or take a taxi, or you could even walk.

By train[edit]
Trains run from Glasgow Central four times an hour, but it feels like only two as slow trains departs 5 min after the faster trains. The latter take an hour to Ayr via Paisley Gilmour Street, Glengarnock (for Kilbirnie), Kilwinning,  Irvine, Troon, Prestwick Airport and town, and Newton-on-Ayr. Change at Kilwinning for Ardrossan, West Kilbride and Largs. The last train leaves Glasgow around 11:30PM. 
Two or three trains a day run from Kilmarnock via Troon, and continue from Ayr to Girvan. 
Five trains a day run from Stranraer, connecting with the ferries at Cairnryan, and taking 90 min via Girvan. 
From London, Birmingham and Manchester it's usually quickest to take a fast train via Carlisle to Glasgow Central then change. Another route is to change at Carlisle for the train towards Glasgow via Dumfries - get off at Auchinleck south of Kilmarnock and take Bus 42 to Ayr, described below. 
55.458-4.6262 Ayr railway station is central by the main square. There is a staffed ticket office and machines, a cafe, waiting room and toilets. There is level access to Platforms 1, 2 and 3. Platform 4 (towards Stranraer) is reached by steps over the footbridge, or step-free from the public road other side of the tracks. Plusbus is available at this station. 
Newton-on-Ayr is a platform halt one mile north. You might use it for the north edge of town, or even the south edge of Prestwick town.

By bus[edit]
Stagecoach West Scotland is the main operator. Bus X77 runs from Glasgow Buchanan station to Ayr every 30 min, taking 65 min via Prestwick, with the last departing at 23:00. Bus 4 also runs every 30 min but takes two hours via Kilmarnock and Prestwick, so only use it for local journeys.
Citylink / Ulsterbus 923 runs three times a day from Belfast via the Stena ferry to Cairnryan then Glasgow. It calls at Ayr for pre-booked passengers only. 
Bus 14 runs every 45 min from Irvine via Troon and Prestwick. From Ardrossan change at Irvine.
Bus 42 runs hourly from Muirkirk via Cumnock, Auchinleck (for trains to Carlisle and Dumfries), Drongan and Coylton to Ayr. 
Buses 58 and 60 run every 30 min from Girvan via Maybole and Alloway to Ayr. The 358 runs twice from Stranraer via Cairnryan ferry terminal and Girvan.
55.4621-4.63423 Ayr bus station is central, half a mile northwest of the railway station.

By boat[edit]
Ayr is not a ferry port, but if your sailing times allow, it’s a pleasanter place to stop over than Ardrossan (for Arran) or Stranraer (for Belfast).
The nearest marina for small leisure craft is Troon.

Get around[edit]

The area is lowland and well-suited to cycling.

55.4636-4.63711 St John's Tower is the 15th-century bell tower of the original parish church and choir school, founded in the 12th century but demolished by Cromwell in 1654 to make way for a fortress. Only the tower was spared. A block north by the river bank is the main surviving stretch of fortress walls.
55.4628-4.62872 Auld Kirk. This was the 1654 replacement St John's church; Burns was baptised here. It's still an active Church of Scotland. (updated Sep 2022)
Auld Brig across the river was originally a 13th century wooden structure, rebuilt with stone in the 16th. It's a narrow footbridge, mocked in Burns' poem Brigs o' Ayr as too narrow for a pair of wheelbarrows to pass. The bridge retorts that it will still be standing when the New Brig of 1788 has vanished, and so it proved — the present New Bridge is Victorian.

It was built for Robert Hamilton of Bourtreehill, who got rich from slavery and sugar on his Jamaica plantations, and the name derives from his La Rochelle estate there.

55.3385-4.720710 Crossraguel Abbey, Kirkoswald KA19 8HQ (On A77; Bus 60 runs past). Closed. Rambling ruin of an abbey church, cloister and dovecote: it's pronounced "cross-rah-ul", commemorating St Riaghail or Regulus. In the 13th century the monks of Paisley Abbey were funded to build a branch abbey here, but they built only a small chapel and pocketted the rest. The subseqent legal ructions involved the Earl of Carrick, the Abbott of Paisley and the Pope, so it was a miracle any money was left over for building, but eventually a Cluniac monastery was established. It stood on the pilgrimage route between Paisley and Whithorn, probably not the reason King Edward I's army called by in 1307 and wrecked it, and it was re-built even better. The monastic order was dissolved at the Reformation, and in 1570 the Earl of Cassilis gained the lands by torturing the titular holder, as this worked quicker than going to law. Although the abbey was abandoned, its stone was left in place, so it's a substantial ruin. In 2022 it remains closed because of unsafe masonry but you see enough just looking over the hedge.   (updated Sep 2022)
Baltersan Castle half a mile northwest of Crossraguel Abbey is the ruin of a tower house built in 1584 and abandoned circa 1750. In 2020 it was for sale.
55.405-4.76211 Dunure Castle is a scenic stump on a rocky headland. It was built 15th and 16th centuries, and abandoned in the 17th. This was where the Earl of Cassilis tortured the landowner of Crossraguel, by roasting and other culinary techniques. And it worked, he gained the land and never suffered retribution; the cooked man was not eaten but could never walk again. See also the small harbour at the base of the cliffs.
55.380833-4.75694512 Electric Brae on the A719 south of Ayr (between Dunure and Croy Brae) is an optical illusion: a car going "uphill" can glide in neutral, since it's actually going downhill. However these days most motorists won't notice the effect.
55.226-4.384913 Loch Doon Castle was built on an islet in the loch in the 13th century. It was besieged and re-captured a few times and in the 16th century King James V had it demolished to prevent use by rebels. The loch water level was raised in the 1930s for a hydro-electric scheme and reservoir, so the castle ruin was moved stone by stone from the islet to the roadside, the Abu Simbel of Ayrshire.
