Burnley is a town in Lancashire, 30 miles north of Manchester. It's an industrial town, but its proud of its many parks that have been awarded the Green Flag for excellence, and of Burnley Forest — great places for walking or cycling. The Singing Ringing Tree on Crown Point Moor is a piece of sound art made of galvanised steel pipes which make an incredible eerie noise in the wind.  In 2021 Burnley had a population of 94,700. 


Understand[edit]
"Burnley" probably derives from Brun Lea, the meadow by the River Lea. It's in the Pennines at a confluence of valleys, where the Calder flows out towards the Ribble. The Ribble forms the western half of the "Aire Gap" crossing the Pennines at low altitude, so it's always been a transport corridor, and its towns have water to power mills. Burnley was one of the smaller market and wool-weaving towns until 1800. Then the Leeds and Liverpool Canal made bulk transport simple, a local coalfield was developed, mills adopted steam power, and Lancashire towns switched from wool to cotton. Victorian Burnley grew rapidly with cotton mills and heavy engineering, until the late 20th century slump in textile and smokestack trades. The town has struggled to re-invent itself ever since. Transport improved but the M65 carved through the northwest side of town; light industry populates its outlying estates. Burnley is within easy reach of attractive moorland scenery but you're only likely to visit for family, business or a football match. 
Famous people from Burnley include the actor Ian McKellen (b 1939), politician Lord Waddington (1929-2017), most of the band Chumbawamba (1982-2012) and cricketer Jimmy Anderson (b 1982).
