Fira de Tots Sants
Cocentaina is a town of 11,500 people (2018) in Alicante. It is known primarily for its textile industry, and tourists flock to experience its two festivals, both of them originating in the Middle Ages and declared 'Festivals of National Tourist Interest'.


Understand[edit]
Cocentaina (from Iberian: Contestani – the name of the regional Iberian tribe) has been inhabited since Paleolithic times, as attested by nearby cave paintings. Under Moorish rule Qustantaniya was an important enclave; the castle foundations, street layout, and numerous alquerias (fortified farmhouses) survive from that period.
