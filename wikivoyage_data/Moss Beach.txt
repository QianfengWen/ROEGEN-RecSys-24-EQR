Stay healthy[edit]
Be careful to check for ticks after hiking in fields in the bay area.  There is a high rate of lyme disease transmission in the Bay Area.  If a bulls' eye rash develops at the tick bite site, immediately seek medical help and treatment with antibiotics.

Go next[edit]
Half Moon Bay is the next town to the south, and features more lodging and restaurant options, but a less intimate feel than Moss Beach.
Pacifica is the next town to the north, and has grocery stores, a bowling alley, and the chain restaurants necessary to satisfy those who need such things.  The beach in Pacifica is also a good one, when the fog burns off.
