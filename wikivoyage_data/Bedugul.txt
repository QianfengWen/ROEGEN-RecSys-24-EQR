Part of the Ulun Danu Temple complex at Lake Bratan, Bedugul, Bali
Bedugul is an area in the mountain range of Central Bali.


Understand[edit]
Bedugul is the name used to cover a large area of the central highlands of Bali around the villages of Bedugul itself, Candikuning, Pancasari, Pacung and Wanagiri (amongst others). This is an area of great natural beauty. The focus point of the area centres on the three crater lakes of Bratan (Beratan), Buyan and Tamblingan, and the nearby botanical gardens.  The whole area is at an altitude of 700 metres or more, with the tallest mountain peaking above 2,000 metres.  It can be distinctly chilly here.
This article covers the Bedugul area as well as the village of Munduk to the west, and areas between Bedugul and Mount Batukaru to the south west. Mount Batukaru itself is covered in the Tabanan article.

Get in[edit]
Bedugul is located about 50 km north of Denpasar on a main route from South Bali to North Bali or 20 km (approximately 40 minutes) south from Lovina Beach.
The area is served by regular bemos which depart from Batubulan terminal in Denpasar in the south, and from Singaraja in the north. The Perama bus company has no local office in Bedugul so if you planning go further from Bedugul, buy ticket in Kuta, Ubud or elsewhere.
From Lovina / Singaraja, go to Terminal Sukasada or more road next to it from where bemos are leaving it seems, just before road gate and alfamart. gojek drivers will drop you there. Rp 40,000-50,000 (at May 2024), leaving when full enough, 45-60 min to Candikuning, road uphill until first lake. To get to terminal, ensure to compare prices between bemos and grab/gojek as some bemos drivers are asking more than car-hailing apps...
A common way for visitors to appreciate this beautiful mountain region is to hire a car and driver for the day from their base in South Bali. Make sure you have a driver who knows the area well (ask questions to determine this), and fix the price for the day in advance. Depending on the class of car, expect to pay between Rp 500,000 and 600,000 including petrol. Car parking fees and any entrance charges will be extra, and it is always appreciated if you offer to buy the driver lunch.
Another option is to hire your own car and drive up here. Be sure to bring a good map though, and when in doubt, always ask locals for directions.

Get around[edit]

If you are staying in Bedugul, hiring a motorcycle is a good idea as some of the distances between areas of interest are quite long. Your hotel will be able to arrange this and you should expect to pay from Rp 50,000 to 80,000 per day.
The physically fit will enjoy mountain biking here.  There are no formal taxis but you will find plenty of drivers willing and able to transport you for a fixed price.
The area is well served by local bemos, and the central gathering points for these are in and around the car park at Candikuning Market, and in the village of Pancasari just before you reach Lake Buyan. Be prepared for the local users to be carrying all sorts of market produce, including live chickens and other animals.
