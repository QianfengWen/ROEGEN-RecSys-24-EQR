Debenham is an attractive village in Suffolk. In pre-industrial England, wealth came from farming, especially from sheep and wool-processing. Debenham was one prosperous centre, already a substantial place when recorded in the Doomsday Book of 1086, and continued so through medieval times. Modern industry went elsewhere so much of the old village centre has been preserved, although several buildings were lost in a fire of 1744, and others are hidden by modern facades.


Understand[edit]
The village's wealth was founded upon sheep
This village (population 2210 in 2011) has only a tenuous connection with Debenhams retail stores, which folded in 2020 having struggled for some years. The business was founded in London in 1778 by William Clark, who in 1813 took on a partner William Debenham (1794 – 1863) from Alpheton in Suffolk. That village, 20 miles southwest of Debenham near Sudbury, also rated a mention in the Domesday Book, with similar trades, but never grew to the same extent.
