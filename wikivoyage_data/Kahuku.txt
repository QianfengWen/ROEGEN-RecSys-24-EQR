Kahuku Beach
Kahuku is a small town on the north shore of Oahu.


Get in[edit]
The Kamehameha Highway runs through town.

Get around[edit]
The town is small and pretty easily navigable on foot. You would be walking along busy Kam Highway though, which is a two-lane highway, so if you're walking- do so with care.
TheBus[dead link] runs regularly through Kahuku. A daily bus pass /card costs $5.50 but must be paid for in cash, and allows you to reboard the bus as many times as you want. Keep a bus card and near Kahuku, you can reload it at the 7-11 in Hauula or at the Foodland in Laie.  If you're staying more than two weeks in Hawaii, a monthly bus card might be more suitable, for $70 cash.

Eat[edit]
Kahuku is known for its shrimp trucks along Kamehameha Highway. Those who stop can buy raw shrimp or cooked shrimp dishes like shrimp scampi, shrimp with garlic, and sweet & spicy shrimp. Most shrimp dishes come with rice and fruit or salad. Shrimp trucks include Giovanni's Shrimp Truck, Famous Kahuku Shrimp Truck, Blue Water Shrimp, Romy's Kahuku Prawns and Shrimp Hut, Macky's Kahuku Shrimp Truck, and Fumi's Kahuku Shrimp and Seafood and prices are generally less than $10 for a plate lunch.

 Kahuku Superette, 56-505 Kamehameha Hwy. This unassuming little market is a good place to pick up food and other things you might need, but those in the know also head here for some super tasty poke with rice on the cheap ($5 worth will satisfy all but the hungriest of Polynesians).
