Jilotepec
Jilotepec is a small city in the northwestern part of Mexico State. Although the town has a scenic colonial center, it is most popular as an outdoor weekend destination with rolling hills, idyllic waterfalls, and some mountain cliffs that are ideal for rockclimbers. The town has been designated as one of Mexico's Pueblos Mágicos.


Understand[edit]
Jilotepec is a small city of about 10,000 residents, though when you count all the surrounding smaller towns and rural bedroom communities the number swells to 10 times that for the whole municipality (county). The city is officially known as Jilotepec de Molina Enríquez, and was known as Jilotepec de Abasolo until 1986.

History[edit]
Jilotepec was settled by indigenous Otomi about 1,000 years ago. Like many indigenous settlements in Central Mexico, it became a tributary of the Aztec Empire when it was conquered in 1379. 
Spanish conquistadors arrived in the 1560s, with Franciscan missionaries in tow. They established the town's main church, dedicated to St. Peter and St. Paul.

Founded in 1563 by Franciscan friars, the current church was expanded and renovated during the 18th century, leaving relatively little of the original church intact.

Eat[edit]
Jilotepec is home to a couple of regional delicacies that are sure to offend the delicate sensibilities of "refined" foreigners. Huitlacoche, also spelled cuitlacoche, is known to gourmets as the truffle of Mexico. It is essentially a blue-gray colored corn fungus that has a deep, woodsy or smoky flavor. Regarded as a delicacy by the Aztec, it's a food that's been embraced by today's innovative cooks who seek authentic bold flavors. Guisanos de maguey are caterpillars of moths that lay eggs in maguey (agave). They're coomonly solds as "white" (meocuiles) or "red" (chinicuiles). The white are more common in Jilotepec. What do they taste like? A bit nutty and crispy, like chicharrones but with a lower fat content. Mmmmm, mmmm!
Most hotels have restaurants on-site.
