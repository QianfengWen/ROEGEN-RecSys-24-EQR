Hartlepool is a post-industrial town on the coast of County Durham in northeast England, with a population of 92,600 in 2024. From 1974 to 1996 it was assigned to a new county, Cleveland, but this was then abolished and Hartlepool returned to County Durham.


Understand[edit]
HMS Trincomalee
In former times, 'mid war an' strife, When French invashin threaten'd life, An' all was arm'd to the knife,
The Fishermen hung the Monkey, O!
The first documented settlement was in 649 AD on the area now known as Headland, around the monastery of Heretu Abbey - St Hilda's Church now stands on its site. It was at the edge of a primeval forest now lost to coastal erosion, and deer came to drink from the freshwater stream, thus Heretu or "Hart-le-pool". It was a small fishing harbour, occasionally smashed up in the wars between England and Scotland or Cavaliers versus Roundheads, and didn't grow much because of competition from other ports. From the early 18th century Hartlepool exported coal from the South Durham coal fields. There's a legend that during the Napoleonic Wars a French fishing vessel was wrecked hereabouts with the only survivor the ship's mascot, a monkey; as it didn't speak English (or being French, sullenly refused to) the townsfolk hanged it as a spy. This legend got started in a Victorian music hall ballad by Ned Corvan, adapted from similar legends and ballads from Scotland and Cornwall; the point was to ridicule the ignorant country yokels. 
The small harbour held back development so in 1835 a rival harbour and settlement was built across the bay, and linked by rail to the coalfields. This was called West Hartlepool and it soon outgrew the original through ship-building, and steel-making to plate those ships. The two settlements fused but were referred to as "the Hartlepools" and it was only in 1967 that the town councils combined. This industry made it a target for one of the few German attacks on mainland Britain during World War I: on 16 Nov 1914 it was bombarded by the German navy with the loss of 117 lives. It was again bombed in World War II. Post-war Hartlepool declined as traditional industries lost out to foreign competition: the last ship was launched in 1961 and the steelworks closed in 1977. There was high unemployment until redevelopment in the 1990s, with a growing service sector, and much of the harbour was converted to a leisure marina.
Famous people associated with Hartlepool include Brian Clough (1935-2004) who started his career as a football manager here, John Darwin (b 1950) who faked his own death canoeing here to claim the insurance money, Reg Smythe (1917-1998) who created the cartoon strip Andy Capp, and Peter Mandelson (b 1953) who was the town's Member of Parliament for eight years.

See[edit]
Saint Hilda wows Hartlepool with her lippy
54.6903-1.20671 National Museum of the Royal Navy, Jackson Dock TS24 0XZ, ☏ +44 1429 860077. Apr-Oct: 10AM-5PM, Nov-Mar: 11AM-4PM. Museum recreating life in a Georgian harbour. The standout exhibit is HMS Trincomalee, the oldest Royal Navy warship still afloat (HMS Victory is older, but is in dry dock). Trincomalee was a frigate, launched in Bombay in 1817 and brought to Portsmouth, but then mothballed until 1845. She thereafter served around North America, including anti-slavery patrols. (Her sister ship HMS Unicorn, mothballed from launch and never in service, can be visited in Dundee). Somewhat anachronistic is the paddle steamer Wingfield Castle, a Humber ferry from 1934 to 1974 when the A15 Humber Bridge was completed. The National Museum of the RN is an umbrella organisation with other exhibits at Belfast, Portsmouth, Ilchester and Gosport. Adult £10, conc £9, child £8.   (updated Feb 2024)
Museum of Hartlepool adjacent on Jackson Dock is a rump: the best of it, the navy exhibits, are now part of the National Museum of the RN. What's left is some artwork and a few artefacts among ersatz cobbled wharves. Same hours as National Museum, but free.
54.6916-1.20212 Highlight at the wharf edge is not a lighthouse but a memorial to those lost at sea. It was built in 1839 in Longhill the south part of town, but relocated here when the marina was developed.

This Anglican church dates from the 12th century, overlying the former Hartlepool or Heretu Abbey founded in 640. Saint Hilda (614-680) was its second abbess and went on to found Whitby Abbey; Hartlepool Abbey disappears from history when she moved on, and it's not clear if it was abandoned or simply unimportant.   (updated Feb 2024)
Headland water pump is a 19th-century wrought iron contraption on High St outside St Hilda's Church. It was the village water supply but no longer draws water.
Town walls are best preserved on the seafront near St Hilda's. They were built in the 14th century to defend against Scottish attacks, but the Black Douglas attacked in 1315 before they were finished.

It was built in the 1960s to pump sea water to the lime works, where the brine was mixed with dolomite limestone to make magnesia, used for lining steel-making furnaces. The works closed in 2005. The pier was never intended for public strolling or fishing, but people did so until a section was removed to thwart them.
