Beach at Granadella
Xàbia (Spanish: Jávea) is in the Costa Blanca region in Alicante, Spain. The town has three main areas, namely Xàbia old town, Xàbia port, and the beach area. The old town has not changed much and is a maze of narrow winding streets with homes that have wrought iron balconies and windows in gothic style, and a number of ancient churches and other structures. The harbour and fishing port have numerous restaurants and bars overlooking the sea. The Arenal beach area is the main commercial and recreation centre of the town.


Understand[edit]
Montgó's prehistoric cave dwellers and hunters date from at least 30,000 years ago, and the paintings in Migdia cave are well-enough known. Its slopes have certainly yielded evidence of the ancient past to many local residents whether collecting Stone-Age handaxes and flints, Roman pottery or Muslim ceramics.
The slopes of Montgó and the tops of surrounding hills and of the valley tell of the earliest known Neolithic settlements in the Western Mediterranean, where men developed agriculture and domesticated animals from around 3000 BC and into the Valencian Bronze Age between 1900 and 500 BC. In the museum you can see Iberian beads, shards of decorated pottery, stone axes and pestle and mortars found all around us, including from a fox's burrow dig into the hill crowned by the Santa Lucia Ermita, and which revealed a Bronze Age and Roman Village.
Visigoths were here too. In the 6th century AD. Christian Visigoth monks whose ancestors had accompanied the troops sent to battle in North Africa, came across to Javeda and founded the monastery of San Martin. Here Hermangildo, son of the Visigoth king Leogevild of Toledo, sought refuge in the Monastery after angering his father by marrying a Christian girl. When his father's troops arrived to arrest him all but one ancient monk fled to Portichol - but Hermengild and the old monk were killed. You'll find a number of Javiense with Visigoth names even today.
The foundations of a 17th- to 18th-century house had been built on top of a 3000-year-old Bronze Age farming site, thus preserving the remains of two cabins and several silos.  And in San Bartholome. the next street, facing the church, another house has been demolished to reveal relics of a 14th-century dwelling with a cistern, well and various ceramics and coins.
Excavations have found 14th-century graves- some with several skeletons added later, all of the first Christians to repopulate Jávea after the long Muslim occupation. The cemetery was in use for another two hundred years and archaeologists found the remains of what appeared to have been a high, fortified tower and the later, smaller, 17th-century chapel of the Desamparados.
There is little left of the Moors but some inscribed gravestones and ceramics, although they were here from about 714 AD until the last were expelled from Jávea and Dénia in 1609. Most were farmers, cultivating and terracing the land but undoubtedly there are remains hidden beneath many buildings and wooded areas.
Well, walk where you will in the valley, town or hills, you can be sure of one thing, you are walking on history.
