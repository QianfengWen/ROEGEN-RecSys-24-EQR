Muine Bheag, meaning "small thicket", is the official name of the town known in English as  Bagenalstown. It's in County Carlow and in 2016 it had a population of about 2,800.


Understand[edit]
Bagenalstown in the late 19th century
It is far from obvious that this place was modelled on Versailles, yet such was the boast of "Lord" Walter Bagenal (1670-1745). All over 18th / 19th century Europe, plutocrats sat down with the interior designers and the pattern book and said "yes like that, only with better-endowed girls / boys on the bathroom fittings, and much more gilt, and leave out the guillotine." They've bequeathed us a series of glitzy bling palaces that briefy impress on arrival, but somehow don't linger in the memory. Many have succumbed to time but modern ones keep appearing - name the plutocrat of your choice.
The parallel was that Dublin like Paris was dirty, tumbledown and dangerous. Better to build anew, on a classical grid pattern, and make this the power-base: imagine the ambassadors, artists and supplicants that would gather at the gates of Dunleckney Manor while it transmuted into bling. But Bagenal was no Sun King, and all this was castles-in-the-air, as imaginary as his noble title. Later the story was told that he completed the courthouse only to abandon the project when the main coach route altered to bypass town. In truth even the courthouse was only erected about a century later, Bagenal talked big but didn't much improve his own manor let alone town, and Muine Bheag was destined to remain a "small thicket".

Town won't amuse you for long, so you need wheels for the outlying sights; a bike would do. For example Leighlinbridge is only 4 km north on R705, but the road is narrow and busy with no sidewalk, so walking would be tedious by day and hazardous at night. However you could bike or hike there along the canal towpath. 
As of July 2021, no taxi firm is based in Bagenalstown, they'd have to come all the way out from Carlow.

See[edit]
52.7025-6.95851 The Old Courthouse is tucked away on Bachelor's Walk, turning its back on town but greeting the Bagenals as they rode between manor and magistrates' bench. It resembles a folly, with its NatWest cod-classical portico, commissioned in 1826; it included a bridewell or lock-up which was unused, proving unsuitable even for Irish offenders. The architect Robertson "used to be driven about in a wheel-barrow with a bottle of sherry; while that lasted he was always ready to direct the workmen, but when it was finished he was incapable of working any more." There was no access to the building or its gardens in 2021.
Dunleckney Manor the home of Walter Bagenal was built in the 17th century and re-modelled in the 1850s. It's nowadays a private residence, no tours, 1 km northeast of town and hidden behind trees.
52.7-6.9072 Ballymoon Castle is a ruin 3 km east of town. It was built circa 1300 but nothing is known of its occupation history - perhaps it was never completed. A courtyard is surrounded by stout walls, and you can access it free by the path from R724.
52.674-6.8983 Ballyloughan Castle is another ruin of a Norman castle of circa 1300. All that's left is the twin-towered gatehouse and two small square corner towers behind. A 17th century ruined manor stands nearby. The ruins are on private land, you see enough from the lane.
