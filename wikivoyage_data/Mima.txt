Udatsu Townscape[edit]
Udatsu townscape
The term Udatsu (うだつ) refers to a traditional architectural element unique to this area of Shikoku that is built into the long rows of shop houses. It consists of a brick and stucco wall that juts out of the second floor roof-line between two homes or shops. This allows for not only added privacy from one's immediate neighbor, but was also intended to be flame blocking fixture in the event the connecting apartment were to catch fire.

Characteristic of the buildings are the presence of “Udatsu,” extensions of the roof that served as protection from the spread of fires. Udatsu were also symbols of fortune, and continue to proclaim the prosperity of the merchants even today. The charm of the old town continues to excite nostalgia, as the broadcast industry often features it in television dramas and commercials.

It was scheduled for demolition, but after Shōchiku Films decided to used it as a location in their famous film, The Man Who Catches Rainbows, it was brought back into the limelight. The theater is now also known as the Odeon-za (Odeon theater), which was its name in the movie.

During the Kōfun period (3rd-6th century) large grave tombs were built here, and with the spread of Buddhism during the Hakuhō period (645-715), an enormous temple complex was established. The complex consisted of 7 main buildings, which was unheard of for the countryside. The Tera-machi area, also known as Temple Town, is considered to be made up of the Anraku, Ganshō, Saikyō and Rinshō temples, located in the Mima-chō area, near the Sadamitsu train station.

The Engi-shiki was completed in 927, during the Heian period (794-1185), and contained a summary of all the shrines throughout the country. There were seven shrines in the entire list that were named after Izanagi, but this shrine was the only one named after Izanami. It is thought that in many of the Izanagi shrines, Izanami was also worshipped, but the fact that the Izanami shrine is explicitly named after the goddess might have some special significance to it. 
 Ikezuki Park (池月公園 Ikezuki kōen) (In the marshy paddy field region of the Mima-chō area). The park was named for the famous horse Ikezuki, which belonged to Shogun Yoritomo, and was ridden by commander Sasaki Takatsuna, during the Genpei War (1180-1185).

 Dan Tombs (段の塚穴 Dan no Tsuka-ana). Dan no tsuka-ana, or the Dan tombs, are two ancient burial mounds located on the point of a river terrace near Mima city’s temple town. Both burial mounds were constructed about 1400 years ago, in the late Kofun period (approximately 250-538). They were constructed 25 meters apart. The eastern, large burial mound is known as the Taiko-tsuka, or ‘Drum tomb’, and the smaller one is known as the Tana-tsuka, or ‘Shelf tomb’. Especially the Taiko-tsuka is remarkable in its construction, making the tombs invaluable for historic research into the Kofun period. In 1942 the tombs were awarded the status of nationally designated Historic Landmarks. The archeological findings and relics from the tombs are on display at the nearby Mima City Folk Museum, which is located on the premises of the Ganshō Temple.

In 1131, the restored temple was reopened by the monk Sō-Yūjun. Because of the temple's strategic position, where Mt. Takamaru and the Yoshino River meet, it was used as a fort during the Sengoku period (1467-1568). In the late Tenshō period (1573-1592) the temple, along with several precious objects, was burned to the ground by the Chōsokabe Clan. In 1863 the temple was again destroyed by fire.

Another famous food product is Mima-kara, a spicy condiment (kara means spicy) which is essentially a mix of organically grown green chili peppers boiled down in soy sauce. There are also four local sake breweries in Mima city, namely Tsukasagiku, Myōjō, ōga and Shinomiya. These all sell their own, hand-made sake. Another famous local drink is 'Mima-no-Sato', a shōchū (Japanese gin), made from Kintoki potatoes.
