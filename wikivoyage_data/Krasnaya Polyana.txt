Summer in Krasnaya Polyana
Krasnaya Polyana (Russian: Красная Поляна, KRUSS-nah-yah poh-LYAH-nah ) is one of the most expensive and popular (mainly at national level) winter ski resorts in Russia. Located 40 km away from the Black Sea coast and from the city of Sochi, it is, nevertheless, included in the Adler District of Sochi.
Krasnaya Polyana was the center of the Alpine cluster of venues for the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, and includes venues for skiing, biathlon, luge, ski-jumping and snowboarding.


Understand[edit]
The climate is vastly changed by the mountains covering Krasnaya Polyana and making its winter warm, soft and comfortable. July has average highs of +23.2 °C (73.76 °F) with maximums going as high as +40 °C (104 °F).  Average temperature in January is +0.4 °C. Snow cover can reach height of about a meter.
Plants in surroundings vary from sub-tropical to alpine.

Get in[edit]
By bus/marshrutka[edit]
Bus route 105 goes to Krasnaya Polyana from Sochi central bus terminal via Sochi International Airport. Another option is to catch bus 135 from the center of Adler. Both routes have stops in Krasnaya Polyana settlement and Esto-Sadok, finishing at Alpika-Service. A one-way ride from Central Sochi will cost you 65 RUR, as of 2011.
Marshrutkas, or minibuses, of the same routes have more frequent service, the fare can be a bit more expensive.

By train[edit]
In preparation for the Games this new rail line was constructed and opened in November 2013. There will be 2 train stations in the area of Krasnaya Polyana: Esto-Sadok and Roza Khutor.  The trains depart both ways 7 times a day and cost 119 руб and take 40 minutes (as of September 2015).

By taxi[edit]
Taxi is quite expensive, but still the most convenient way to reach Krasnaya Polyana.
Expect to pay in average 1,500 RUR for a ride from Central Sochi or 1,200 from Adler / Sochi International Airport. Most hotels can arrange transfers as well; the price for that can be slightly more expensive.

By car[edit]
It is 40 km from Adler. The road will take 30 minutes to get from Adler/airport, or 1 hour from Central Sochi.
If you want to rent a car, get it at Sochi International Airport, as there are no rental agencies in Krasnaya Polyana.
