It was the ninth and last mission founded by Fermin Lasuen. Owing to the size of its physical plant and its land grant, as well as its success in converting neophytes, it received the moniker "The King of the Missions". The oldest pepper tree in California was planted in San Luis Rey's courtyard. During the Mexican-American War, its alcalde (governor) was Sacagewea's son John Baptiste Charbonneau. It was rebuilt between 1895 and 1905 under the direction of Father Joseph O'Keefe. A museum on site has exhibits on the history of the area and there are beautiful gardens to walk through.

Thursday Morning Farmer's Market is held also on Pier View, but East of Coast Highway. Lots of good, fresh organic fruits and vegetables from local farmers at reasonable prices.
Fish from the Oceanside Pier. No license is required, and the bait-house on the pier can supply everything you need. You can also surfcast, fish from the rock jetty, or join a fishing party boat out of the Oceanside Harbor.
Nature attractions in Oceanside Area:
Right around the Oceanside Harbor are a lot of “nature attractions.” There is a wide variety of seabirds on the ocean, on the beach, and in the inlet to the San Luis Rey river. We love to watch the pelicans dive for their fish. There are also a pod of dolphins who regularly patrol up and down the coast. In the harbor area, there are harbor seals and noisy sea lions usually barking over near the bait dock, just north of the boat launch ramp.

Buena Vista Lagoon
 Grunion Runs. Right on the beach, little fish called grunion come to lay their eggs at night. They do it for 3 sequential nights every 2 or 3 weeks from March to early Fall. The three nights are determined by the moon and tides, and the dates and times of the runs are printed in most tide guides. The first night they start around 11:30, the next night an hour later and the third night another hour later. To see them you will need to bring a flashlight, and should go north of the jetty, because the street lights and the North Coast Village lights make them shy. There is also a program at the Birch Aquarium in La Jolla.

Stay safe[edit]
The most dangerous place in Oceanside is the northern parts, near Camp Pendleton. This is where an officer was once murdered. Do not wander around at night with gang colors, and expect suspicious looking people at night.
Since Camp Pendleton is so close, the Marines often take their off time in downtown Oceanside off Mission Avenue near the Regal movie theater. This area has many bars and Marines are known to frequent them and get rowdy.
