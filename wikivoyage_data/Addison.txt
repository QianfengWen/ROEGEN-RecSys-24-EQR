Get in[edit]
Cavanaugh Flight Museum in Addison
By car[edit]
Addison is centered on the intersection of Belt Line Road and Dallas North Tollway. It is almost completely surrounded by North Dallas. The tolls from Downtown Dallas amount to less than 2 dollars.

By bus[edit]
Public transit via DART buses is found at the Addison Transit Station on Arapaho Rd, one block north of Belt Line Rd on Quorum Road. This is right next to Addison Circle Park, making it a convenient option if you are attending a festival or show at the WaterTower. The main dining strip is a 5- to 10-minute walk south to Belt Line.

By plane[edit]
Addison is served commercially by Dallas/Fort Worth Airport and Love Field, but also has its own airport for private planes and corporate aviation. Private jet service is available from multiple fixed base operators. International travelers can utilize the airport's 24-hour Customs port.

Get around[edit]
Addison Circle park, in Addison, Texas
By car[edit]
Driving along Belt Line Road can be slow at the heaviest dining times, but usually not too bad. Weekday lunch time and weekend evenings have the worst traffic. If a festival is happening, especially KaboomTown, expect to sit in traffic much longer.
Be watchful for traffic cops as they are strict and tend to hide themselves well. Arapaho Road, Belt Line Road, Midway Road and Quorum Road are well patrolled.

By bus[edit]
Most placed in Addison are accessible by DART bus.

On foot and by bicycle[edit]
Most streets in Addison have sidewalks, and the city is working to make the city more accessible on foot or by bike.  There are bicycle racks on the front of all DART buses serving Addison.  The Les Lacs Linear Park is available in the southern part of Addison for a quiet and pleasant 2.7-mile paved trail.

Festivals[edit]
Addison holds some of the best festivals around.  Addison believes in making every celebration as big as possible, and they follow through quite well.  Each of these festivals are in Addison Circle Park (SW corner of Quorum Dr. and Addison Circle.  DART Addison Transit Center).

 North Texas Jazz Festival. 
 Taste of Addison. Normally held in May, Taste of Addison is a gathering of many of the city's restaurants at Addison Circle Park.  Each of the restaurants offers smaller portions of their food at low prices, allowing the public to sample their food. 
 Kaboom Town!. Normally held the night of July 3, Kaboom Town is one of the largest Fourth of July celebrations in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area.  Kaboom Town is at Addison Circle Park.  Because of the incredible popularity of Kaboom Town it can be next-to-impossible to find a nearby parking space.  Your best option is to stay at a residence or hotel near Addison Circle and walk there. 
 Oktoberfest. Normally held in September, Oktoberfest is a collection of traditional German foods, polka, Paulaner beer, and very silly lederhosen.  There's an oom-pah band on site, and a backup oom-pah band in case the first one breaks down.  It's advised to go on Thursday, as it can get very crowded on the weekend. 
 Worldfest. Normally held in October, Worldfest is a gathering of many different cultural events.  Many of the local restaurants set up tents to serve exotic and ethnic foods.  Multiple stages show many colorful acts from around the world.  There are also a lot of unique shops set up selling items from around the world.  It's a good way to get introduced to many different cultures at once.

32.9609-96.827913 Addison Circle Park (Addison Circle Rd and Quorum Dr. DART Addison Transit Center). Large outdoor park and the location of festivals, concerts and outdoor plays. Also has fountains for cooling off in the Texas heat. 
 Arapaho Road Park (park in the parking lot on the Northwest side of Arapaho Rd/Addison Rd intersection and walk a few hundred yards west to find the park; DART Bus #333). When the wind is out of the north, this is the perfect place to watch planes depart and land as they fly just overhead. Addison Airport is one of the busiest single-runway airports in the nation so there is usually no shortage of traffic on a nice day. 
32.94767-96.813464 Celestial Park (Celestial Rd at Bellbrook Dr. DART Bus #463). Watch the solstices on a giant sundial. 
32.97046-96.825275 Quorom Park, Quorum Dr (just north of Keller Springs Rd. DART Bus #362). Quiet, very well landscaped park; perfect for having a sack lunch. There is also a large below-ground waterfall surrounded by trees.

 Addison Cigar & Tobacco Co, 15401 Addison Rd (NW corner of Lindbergh Dr and Addison Rd. DART Bus #534), ☏ +1 972 239-1521. This shop is a small building all by itself next to Addison airport, which means there's no one to complain about the smell. A very good cigar and tobacco shop, decorated with lots of wood paneling. While it's a small location, they have a wide selection of cigars in their walk-in humidor. The owners are always friendly to help you find what you're looking for. A members-only lounge is available in the back. This place can get crowded on Friday nights, and parking is limited. 
32.95205-96.821181 Village on the Parkway, 5100 Belt Line Rd, Dallas (SE corner of Belt Line Rd and Dallas Pkwy. DART Bus #400), ☏ +1 972 308-0100. A large outdoor shopping mall. With fountains, simulated roudabouts and delicate styling this is reminiscent of an Italian village. Some notable shops here are Paciugo Gelato, Bed Bath & Beyond, Grand Spa International, and Harold's Closeout. Because this shopping center has many restaurants and bars it can get quite busy on weekend nights. 
Eat[edit]
When you get hungry, there are over 170 restaurants in the city's 4 square miles, enough to satisfy any taste.  Most of Addison's restaurants are on Belt Line Rd, which is commonly called "Restaurant Row".  DART Bus #400 runs along the entire length of Belt Line Rd in Addison, and connects with the Addison Transit Center.

Budget[edit]
 IHOP, 3910 Belt Line Rd (SE corner of Belt Line Rd and Commercial Dr. DART Bus #400), ☏ +1 972 241-9299. 24 hours. Inexpensive, convenient, breakfast served anytime. Just like its bitter rival Dennys.

Pho Que Huong's signature dish is "pho" a Vietnamese soup filled with rice noodles and various other things. It's cheap, fast, and low-calorie. They have some available ingredients not generally found in other restaurants such as tendons and tripe. Along with pho they have a lot of other foods in their 'order-by-number' menu. Fried rice, non-soup noodle dishes, sandwiches, and vermicelli. Beverages include a variety of coffees, teas, and coconut drinks. For dessert they have smoothies, but they're a little icy. 
 Which Wich, 4135 Belt Line Road # 120 (in strip mall on NE corner of Belt Line Rd and Midway; DART Bus #400), ☏ +1 972 404-9424. Classic fast food custom sandwich chain. It's easy to order: just grab a paper bag, mark off all the things you want on one side, then draw a silly picture on the other side to keep track of yours. Oh, and this is one of the few places in the Metroplex to serve Mello Yello. $. 
Mid-range[edit]

A cozy and tasty Thai restaurant. The place is rarely crowded, and service is very friendly. Along with various meats, vegan options are also available on the menu. 
 Blue Mesa Grill, 5100 Belt Line Rd (in Village on the Parkway shopping center; SE corner of Belt Line Rd and Dallas Pkwy; DART Bus #400), ☏ +1 972 934-0165. M-Th 11AM - 10PM, F Sa 11AM - 10:30PM, Su 9AM - 9PM. A rather nice American Southwest fusion restaurant. Like Tex-Mex with a little extra added. They also have a wide selection of tequila drinks.

The place tends to get noisy most nights. 
 Clay Pit, 4460 Belt Line Rd (on the south side of Belt Line, just east of Midway Rd. DART Bus #400), ☏ +1 972 233-0111. Indian restaurant and bar, serving a large variety of exotic vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. Atmosphere is more hip and modern, but still traditional.

 Gloria's, 5100 Belt Line Rd. Suite 852 (SE corner of Belt Line and Dallas North Tollway; DART Bus #400), ☏ +1 972 387-8442.

Reasonably priced. 
 Magic Time Machine, 5003 Belt Line Rd (NE corner of Quorum Dr and Belt Line Rd; DART Bus #400), ☏ +1 972 980-1903. This is a kids-oriented restaurant that screams atmosphere! The lobby is decorated in very loud bright colors. The dining room has the same bright colors with loud and gaudy wallpaper. Every obscure, brightly-colored accessory is hanging on the wall. And even the waiters are dressed in various fictional characters. People go there for the atmosphere, and with as much work as they put into their atmosphere they left the food a bit lacking. The food isn't bad, but it doesn't stand out as anything special. Overall it's a fun place to take the kids. 
 May Dragon, 4848 Beltline Rd (SE corner of Belt Line Rd and Addison/Inwood Rd; Dart Bus #400), ☏ +1 972 392-9998. A four-star Chinese restaurant.

Stay safe[edit]
Addison is a safe place overall.  As Addison caters to the more affluent crowd the city does not really have a lower income neighborhood.  The only people that you have to watch out for are the drunks, and the Addison police (in case you're the one that's drunk).  Don't yell at the police officers, and if they give you a command you should do what they say.  The police can be strict, but they're still there to protect and serve.
