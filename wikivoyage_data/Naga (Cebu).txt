Naga is very much an industrial city with an enormous cement factory, some electric power plants and other industry.
The local tourist bureau has both a website and a Facebook page.

Get in[edit]
Naga is on the coastal highway going south from Cebu City, and often reached by bus from that city's south bus terminal. There are also jeepneys from Cebu or from other towns in the region, and KMK buses that run from SM City Cebu via Cebu South terminal.
The across-the-island highway to Toledo intersects the coastal highway at Naga, as well as further north at Talisay.
There is a ferry called My Boat Mejia from pier 3 at the port in Cebu City, with fare ₱60 and travel time a bit over half an hour.
