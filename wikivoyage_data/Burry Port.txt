Burry Port[dead link] (Welsh: Porth Tywyn) is a town in Carmarthenshire in South Wales, 5 miles to the west of Llanelli.
It is a harbour town and is famous for being the landing site of Amelia Earheart in her successful attempt at being the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean.


Understand[edit]
Historically, Burry Port was founded upon its ability to ship coal from the Gwendraeth mines out by sea.  As the coal mines shut, the harbour was renovated and is now a marina for small leisure craft.  The focal point of the harbour is the lighthouse, which was built in 1842 and is different from any other British lighthouse.
