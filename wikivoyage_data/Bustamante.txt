Grutas de Bustamante
Bustamante is a very small town in a very remote part of Nuevo Leon, Mexico. With less than 4,000 residents in 2021, it's one of the smallest of all Mexico's Pueblos Magicos, though it does indeed have the designation, and it actually is a fun, interesting place to spend a weekend. Especially if you like a slower, laid-back attitude. Highlights include some delightfully quirky sites in town, an awesome cavern to explore, some natural pools near the town's spring, and a local park chock full of swimming pools where almost everyone in town can be found partying on the weekends.


Understand[edit]
The climate is pretty dry for most of the year with hot weather most of the year, but the town doesn't have a real water problem since they have natural springs that are the source of the Sabina River.

In the pre-Hispanic era, this part of Mexico was inhabited by Chichimeca people. In 1591, the Spanish viceroys wanted to settle the wild and wooly northern Frontier, so they rounded up 400 indigenous families from Tlaxcala who had been successfully Christianized and transported them north to the states of Coahuila-Tejas and Nuevo Leon. Most of the families settled near Saltillo, but others settled in Bustamante, where silver mines were being built in the nearby town of Villaldama. All was well for a couple of hundred years, then all hell broke loose with gringo land grabbers declaring independence for Texas. Battles ensued, Santa Ana got his butt kicked by the Texan rebels, and more gringo settlers moved into Texas, pushing out nomadic tribes like the Comanches.
The Comanches were happy to kill off all the gringos they could, but they also felt the burn of constant defeat and pushed south into Mexico. In Bustamante, dozens of Comanche raids killed a lot of residents, and almost all the Tlaxcalans moved to the city of Monterrey. Meanwhile the silver mines had gone bust and by the end of the 19th century, revolution was in the works. Bustamante was a tough place to live.
