The Morgan Bay beach
The seaside village of Morgan's Bay is located on the Eastern Cape Wild Coast of South Africa and is about 85 km east of East London. Morgan's Bay lies between the famous Morgan's Bay cliffs and a mile-long stretch of unspoilt beach, bordered by the Cape Morgan Nature Reserve.
In the early part of the century, Morgan's Bay was a popular holiday destination for farmers from throughout South Africa's Eastern Cape region. Every year, after the harvest, they packed their families and possessions into wagons for a camping holiday by the sea. These days Morgan's Bay is still a popular camping destination, with families from up country making the yearly trek down to the sea to enjoy the delights of the Wild Coast.

See[edit]
If you're a keen hiker it's worth a ramble over the Morgan's Bay Cliffs. These impressive slabs of dolerite, which drop some 50 m into the pounding surf, are ideal vantage points for watching the sunset. If you're lucky, you may even see the dolphins frolicking in the waves, which crash against the rocks below.

Do[edit]
Morgan's Bay is an ideal destination for adventurous family holidays with an excellent swimming beach, patrolled by lifeguards during the festive season, and lagoon in pristine natural surroundings. It's the perfect place to get in some well earned relaxation and breathe in the fresh sea air. During the day you can gaze at passing ships on the horizon or lie on the beach with a book. At night you can lie relaxed in comfortable accommodation while being hypnotised by the dull roar of the sea, glorious stars and the intermittent beam of the Cape Morgan Lighthouse across the bay.
