Kilkee (Cill Chaoi, "Church of Chaoineadh Ita – lamentation for Ita") is a small town in County Clare in the west of Ireland. It was the seaside resort of Limerick in Victorian times, when wealthy merchants families retired here for the whole summer season, and built the many substantial summer houses that are now small hotels and guesthouses. Kilkee is world famous for its bathing facilities. It has one of the safest beaches anywhere and has wonderful natural rock pools called the Pollock Holes which are a huge attraction. It is also known for great walks along its cliffs.

You need wheels: a bike will do, though Loop Head is a long pedal against a stiff breeze.

See[edit]
Kilkee Bay
52.656-9.721 Kilkee Cliffs look out over sea stacks and the islet of Illaunonearaun.
52.605-9.712 Carrigaholt (Carraig an Chabhaltaigh, "Rock of the Fleet") on the Shannon coast is where seven ships of the Spanish Armada took shelter in 1588. There's a scenic main street and the ruin of a 15th-century castle. Dolphin-watching boat trips sail from the village April-Oct. Long Dock pub has stone walls, a roaring fire and excellent fresh-landed fish. Morrisey's, Carmody's and Keane's are three other good bars.
52.571-9.8613 Kilbaha (Cill Bheathach, "Church of the Birches") is a tiny village further west. The villagers worked as pilots for ships entering the estuary: in 1873 five drowned when their pilot boat was overwhelmed in high seas. One km east, "The Grave of the Yellow Men" marks another 19th-century tragedy at sea, but the historical event is not known. Keating's is the village pub and restaurant; the Lighthouse Inn has closed down.
52.591-9.8734 Bridges of Ross near Kilbaha on the Atlantic coast is a great natural arch.
52.56-9.9355 Loop Head has stiff breezes, great views and a lighthouse.
Attractions east of Kilkee are the West Clare Railway, the village of Kilrush and Scattery Island.
"I'm late because I took the West Clare Railway here, your Honour"
52.668-9.5356 West Clare Railway is recreated at Moyasta on N67. This notoriously unreliable railway was a 3-ft (914-mm) narrow gauge, operating 1887-1961. Built to revive the local economy after the Famine, it meandered from Ennis through the fields to Milltown Malbay and Moyasta junction, where one branch continued to Kilrush pier and another to Kilkee. In 1896 the entertainer Percy French successfully sued it for making him very late for a show. And when he arrived late for the court hearing, that too was because "I took the West Clare Railway here, your Honour". All that remains of the line is 2 km of track at Moyasta junction, worked by original 0-6-2T steam locomotive Slieve Callan; others are under restoration. The railway aims to open Sunday afternoons May-Sept but, upholding the tradition, it's altogether unreliable.
52.613-9.5197 Scattery Island (Inis Cathaighis) is uninhabited and has a lighthouse, a ruined monastery, an Irish round tower and the remains of a Napoleonic-era gun battery. St Sennan (488-560) was born in Kilrush, founded churches in Ireland, Brittany and Cornwall (hence Sennan Cove), became bishop, and founded the monastery here. The island is reached by boat trips from Kilrush, usually twice a day in summer but dependent on weather and tides. Nearby Hog Island is just farmland, as are the islands in the Fergus estuary near the airport.
Northeast of Kilkee the road follows the coast.
Do[edit]
Kilkee beach is a wide horseshoe shaped bay. It is widely regarded as one of the safest beaches in Ireland because of its enclosed shape. To the south, in the flat rocks, are a number of natural swimming pools, refreshed with sea water at high tide, and known locally as 'Pollock Holes'.
Scuba diving: snorkel or shore-dive in Kilkee from Duggerna Rocks and Myles Creek west side of the bay, or boat-dive Black Rocks. Oceanlife Dive Centre is north end of the bay. Famously Jacques Cousteau said Kilkee was one of the top three dive spots in the world is in his opinion. There a vast amount of wonderful rock formations and marine life to be seen.
There's a good walk north from the bay past Kilkee golf course to Corbally Cliff, Byrne's Cove and George's Head. Byrne's Cove was famous for many years as an all-male bathing spot where men could swim naked, but that has ended.
Kilkee Waterworld is an indoor pool containing water slides and a lazy river, popular with children.
Water sports including lessons for children are available at high season provided by Nevsail Watersports.
There is a cultural centre, called Culturlann Sweeny, which combines an extensive library with an art gallery and theatre where concerts and plays are regularly held.

Kilkee has several good convenience stores and most things can be bought locally. There are two pharmacies, a hardware, several gift shops as well as a bank and post office.
