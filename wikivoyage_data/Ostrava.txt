Ostrava is a city in the borderland of Moravia and Silesia in the Czech Republic. With a population of 290,000 (2019), it is the third largest city in the Czech Republic and the centre of the second largest urban agglomeration after Prague.


Understand[edit]
Ostrava had been a predominantly industrial city since the 18th century, when the discovery of extensive coal deposits in the area led to an industrial boom. Ostrava quickly grew from a small provincial town of around one thousand inhabitants to one of the largest cities in the region.
As a major steel manufacturing centre, Ostrava suffered heavy destruction during the Second World War, and holds the sad distinction of being one of the most polluted cities of the European Union. Many parts have been redeveloped though, and several formerly industrial areas have become cultural centres and tourist attractions.

The secret sweet treats of Ostrava are the katowicke rurki, named after the nearby city of Katowice in Poland - although they are arguably a version of a similar treat popular in the entirety Poland, and not peculiar to Katowice at all. The katowicke rurki consist of a sweet wafer rolled into a tube, and then filled with pařížská šlehačka, both using a specially-designed machine. Pařížská šlehačka, in turn, is a filling vaguely resembling chocolate-flavoured whipped cream, although quite often having nothing to do with either cream or chocolate when it comes to its ingredients, and obviously having no obvious connection to the city of Paris after which it is ostensibly named.
Katowicke rurki are usually made by specialized confissers in possession of one of the unique machines, who often have been operating their specialized businesses for decades. One of those is hidden in the Hornicka street[dead link].
