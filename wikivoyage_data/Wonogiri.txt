Wonogiri is a town and regency in the southeastern part of Central Java. It is flanked by two provinces, namely Yogyakarta and East Java.


Understand[edit]
The origin of the word Wonogiri itself comes from the Javanese wana (pad/forest/rice field) and giri (mountain/mountains). This name is very apt to describe the condition of the Wonogiri Regency area which is indeed mostly in the form of rice fields, forests, and mountains.
