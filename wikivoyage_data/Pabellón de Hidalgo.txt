The historic 17th century hacienda casa grande is a beautiful local landmark that exemplifies classic architecture of the colonial era and is an historical landmark that commemorates the removal of Miguel Hidalgo from command of the Insurgency during the Mexican War of Independence. After the Insurgent army was defeated in the battle of Calderon Bridge, they retreated to the Hacienda de San Blas. The Insurgent army blamed Hidalgo's poor command leadership for their defeat and he was removed from command. The museum consists of three main galleries with historical exhibits and is the site of a series of historical murals by contemporary artist Alfredo Flores Zermeno depicting Mexican historical events since Independence. The hacienda encompassed a large area of what is today the town itself and visitors can see the hacienda's botanical gardens (showcasing a selection of cactus species common in the region) as well as ruins of hacienda buildings a couple blocks away.
