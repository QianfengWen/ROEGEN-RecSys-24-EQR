Central Beira
Beira is a port town in Mozambique.
Beira is the second largest city in Mozambique and capital of the Sofala Province. During the 1950s and 60s, before the independence of Mozambique, Beira was a playground for white and rich Rhodesians as the country was a colony of Portugal, which did not participate in the UN embargo against Rhodesia. Still an important port city, few tourists find their way here today. Those who do will discover a beautiful, but crumbling, city by the sea with great food and hospitality.


Understand[edit]
Beira took a direct hit from Cyclone Idai on 15 March 2019, and according to the Red Cross 90% of the city was destroyed.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
-19.79638934.90751 Beira International Airport (BEW  IATA) (is about 10 km out of the town, and can be easily reached by bus and taxi). The national carrier LAM has flights from Johannesburg, Harare and from the capital Maputo, as well as other regional cities in Mozambique. South African Airways also offers flights from Johannesburg. Malawi airlines has flights from Lilongwe. The airport has a shop, bar, restaurant and post office.   
By train[edit]
Rail services are slowly returning, after having been completely halted due to the long civil war. There are daily commuter trains from nearby Dondo and a once-weekly long-distance service from Moatize, just outside Tete which is the largest city of inland north-western Mozambique. Additionally, there's a service from Machipanda, at the border with Zimbabwe, via Chimoio.

-19.82481234.8384432 Beira railway station (Estação Ferroviária da Beira). A prime example of modernist architecture, tells tales of a bygone era when Beira was a major terminus for long-distance trains from then Rhodesia.   (updated Nov 2020)
By boat[edit]
By road[edit]
The main road between Zimbabwe and Beira is in good condition, but with some deep pot holes.  The Zimbabwe economy relies heavily on this route and it carries many trucks and buses, mostly overloaded.  Road travel is best done by daylight as many pedestrians and animals are hard to see after dusk. Minibuses to Chimoio take 3 hours and cost MT200.
there is direct buses to Vilankulo MT550 which takes 7 hours.

Get around[edit]
Map of Beira
Minibuses, so called chapas, are easily available for local transport and for connections to neighboring cities like Chimoio.

-19.83957134.8421921 Our Lady of the Rosary Cathedral (Catedral Metropolitana de Nossa Senhora do Rosário). Seat of the Archdiocese of Beira, built in a Gothic Revival style and inaugurated in 1925. It was heavily damaged by cyclone Idai in 2019.   (updated Nov 2020)
-19.84722234.8405562 Grande Hotel Beira (On Avenida Mateus Sansao Muthemba, west of city centre). More of an anti-attraction, this former luxury hotel which once was known as the "pride of Africa" is since the last 30 years occupied by thousands of squatters displaced by the country's long civil war. It serves as a living memory of better times and the horrors of war.   (updated Nov 2020)
Savanna Beach (20–30 km out of town) ask around if someone is going. You could venture and take a chapa heading in the direction. You have to take a little boat across to the beach, worth the effort. Water is cleaner than Beira and waves are better. Good fishing. Simple restaurant with nice atmosphere.
Gorongosa (200–300 km) in Sofala Province. Once a very well known park. Now starting to recover, good investments. Good challets and food.
Rio Maria (10–15 km). When traveling from Macuti to Airport, turn right at Monte Verde and take the sandy road. At Rio Maria is a nice river and sea. No facilities there. Don't get car stuck in mud close to beach. Very relaxing.

Stay safe[edit]
Don't walk in the Baixa area at night alone. If you walk around during day time just keep your precious stuff at the hotel. Don't walk around with a fat wallet or your expensive cellphone. Most crime is on a "give me your phone and/or wallet because I have a big knife" basis. If driving at night just keep doors locked and windows almost closed to avoid issues.
Friday, Saturday and Sunday night people party and can get very drunk, if you run over someone as a foreigner it's gonna cause you a big headache so drive slowly. Kids also run across the road often without looking out for cars. Avoid driving at night.
The city was 90% destroyed by Cyclone Idai, in March 2019.
