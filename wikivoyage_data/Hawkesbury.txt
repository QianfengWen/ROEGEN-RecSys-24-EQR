Hawkesbury
Hawkesbury is a pleasant town of 10,200 people (2021) on the Ottawa River near the Ontario-Quebec border about midway between Montreal and Ottawa. English and French are widely spoken here. More than three quarters of the population is francophone, so it's not surprising  that some people think that the town is actually called "Oxbury". A bridge crosses the river to the town of Grenville, Quebec.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
St-Alphonse-de-Liguori Catholic Church
Hawkesbury was founded in 1798, and named after Charles Jenkinson, Baron Hawkesbury.
Thomas Mears and David Pattee, two Americans, entered into a partnership in 1805 to harness the power of the lower Ottawa River and built the first sawmill on the Upper Canada side of the river. The town of Hawkesbury developed around this mill. Demand for timber during the Napoleonic Wars created a boom. The mill complex continued to grow for at least the next half century, and by 1870 it included 145 different saws and created over 35 million board feet of lumber per year.
Timber and pulp-and-paper industries have been supplanted by textiles, synthetic fibres, metal extrusions, steel, glass and plastics. Hawkesbury has also become the business and service centre of the county of Prescott-Russell, although Rockland has become the largest community. New developments today are happening due to baby boomers from Ottawa, Montreal and area purchasing some of the many new condos in town.

Get in[edit]

By car[edit]
South of Hawkesbury, Highway 417, a freeway, travels east from Ottawa and west from Montreal.  Highway 417 becomes Autoroute 40, a freeway in Quebec.   Between Ottawa and Montreal, Highway 417 and Autoroute 40 are part of the Trans-Canada Highway.  To reach Hawkesbury from Highway 417, take Russell County Road 17 if heading westbound or head north on Highway 34 if heading eastbound.
The Long Sault Interprovincial Bridge between Hawkesbury, Ontario and Grenville, Quebec, means that Hawkesbury is within minutes of Autoroute 50, a freeway, and Route 148.  Both enable travel from eastbound from Gatineau and westbound from suburbs north of Montreal.

By bus[edit]
Leduc Bus Lines, in partnership with OC Transpo, offers a commuter bus service to Ottawa and Gatineau.  This service  has been suspended (as of Jan 2021).
The town is served by two small private airports:

Hawkesbury Airport
