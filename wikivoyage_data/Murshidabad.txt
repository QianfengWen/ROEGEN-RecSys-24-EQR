Murshidabad (Bengali: মুর্শিদাবাদ Murśidābād) is a historic town in West Bengal. It was the capital of Bengal, Bihar and Odisha during the Nawab rule. The last capital city of independent Bengal was named after Nawab Murshid Quli Khan, the Diwan of Bengal, Bihar and Odisha. It is situated on the banks of the Bhagirathi River. A city of splendours and famous for its silk, it was made the capital of Bengal in 1717. The British East India Company starts its journey from that place. The British shifted the capital to Calcutta in 1773.

Murshidabad (MOOR-shih-dah-bahd) became the capital of Bengal under Murshid Quli Khan in 1727. He was the first independent ruler of the region, which consisted of present-day Bangladesh and the Indian states of West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha. Murshidabad was a flourishing trade and commerce centre and historical records even suggested that Murshidabad contributed about 20% of the Indian economy and a staggering 5% of the world GDP. After the Battle of Plassey in 1757, Murshidabad was considered as prosperous as London. Sadly, Murshidabad has long lost its former glory and only traces of its glorious past survive to this day. Whatever has survived is still enough to turn Murshidabad into a leading tourism destination, but sadly the place lacks proper tourist infrastructure. Still, Murshidabad along with Bishnupur and Gour-Pandua are the three important historic tourist destinations of West Bengal.

Dance performance in Katgola gardens during the Murshidabad Heritage Festival
Murshidabad Heritage Festival: The Murshidabad Heritage Festival aims at reviving the tangible and intangible heritage of Murshidabad along with those nearby heritage tows of Jiaganj Azimganj and Cossimbazar. The festival aims at preserving the past and integrating it with the present and to bring Murshidabad back in the tourism, cultural and heritage map of India. It is an initiative of Murshidabad Heritage Development Society (MHDS). The festival began in 2011 and has been celebrated ever since. There are no fixed days for the festival but it is celebrated during the winter season, especially during January or February. The festival is complete with cultural performances, heritage walks, cruise along the Bhagirathi River and exotic food. The food served during the festival is purely vegetarian, with special emphasis on Sheherwali cuisine.
Buy[edit]
 Baluchari Sarees. These are figured silk sarees produced in the town of Baluchar in Murshidabad district. Baluchar sarees essentially have a silk base with silk brocaded designs with respect to their colours, where in spite of a rich composition, the Baluchar bootidars almost avoid strong contrasts. Each pattern is treated in a colour which harmonises with the ground on which it is laid. The most popular colours used are red, blue, yellow, green and scarlet. The Baluchari sarees have large floral motifs interspersed with flowering shrubs. Traditionally the Muslim community was also known to produce these Baluchars with figured patterns depicting court scenes, horse with a rider, women smoking hookah. The Kalka design or the cone motif is often surrounded with floral borders. 
 Murshidabad Silk. Most Baluchar artisans have long migrated to Bishnupur. Hence Murshidabad is no longer famous for the Baluchari sari. Rather one can purchase a Murshidabad silk kora sari than particularly for different types of embroidery works in Kolkata. These things are available in most Khadi shops in Berhampore and Khagra. But purchase it if they provide a rebate of 20% on its printed price. Most of them give it throughout the year even when the government subsidy is not available. 
Other things include Shola art, brass, copper and Kansha items.
Eat and drink[edit]
Nothing special in Murshidabad particularly for Kolkatans. Nawabi Ghee-e bhaja chhanabora has been replaced by Dalda-bhaja one. Still Kolkatans can relish sweets and curd of Murshidabad because those are much cheaper here.
If you sit for lunch in a roadside ordinary hotel near Hazarduari, first ask whether the menu follows meal-system or a la carte and the rate. Otherwise, you may feel cheated after the lunch is over.
The ground water here is contaminated with arsenic, so you are better off drinking from the municipal supply of surface water or bottled drinking water of reputed companies, not of ordinary companies, here and there in Murshidabad, even if those are cheaper by ₹2 per litre.
