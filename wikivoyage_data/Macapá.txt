Macapá is the capital of Amapá, and one of the most deserted state capitals of Brazil. The locals call it "the capital of the middle of the world", as the equator runs through the city. In 2020, it was home to 513,000 people.

As a city cut by the equator and with a climate similar to cities like Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, get ready for intense heat, high temperatures and high humidity in Macapá. Regardless of the time of year, temperatures don't vary much and stay pretty much the same. The maximums are usually 31 ºC (88 ºF) and the minimums reach 24 ºC (75,2 ºF).
The rainy season occurs from December to July. Despite being an inconvenience for those who want to go outdoors, during the rainy season, there is a tidal wave called Pororoca, which takes place in Macapá between April and June. These are huge waves that are formed when the Amazon River meets the Atlantic Ocean. The pororoca is a tourist attraction that even allows surfing championships to be held.

Get in[edit]
Macapá is to the north of the immense mouth of the Amazon River, in a region covered by Amazon rainforest, and is separated from Belém by Marajó Island and is completely isolated geographically from the Brazilian capitals, having a land connection only with French Guiana. The only way to get to Macapá from Brazil is by plane or boat.

By plane[edit]
0.050833-51.0702781 Macapá-Alberto Alcolumbre International Airport (MCP  IATA). Flights from Belém and Brasília. A taxi from the centre can be negotiated at R$ 15.   (updated Jan 2022)
By boat[edit]
Boats from nearby Santana from Belém (24 hours), Santarém (30 hours, hammock R$ 120, cabin R$ 250) and Manaus (5 days), among other smaller destinations.
By bus[edit]
There are buses from Oiapoque on the border of French Guyana. Travel time varies greatly with the rains.

See[edit]
The Marco Zero Monument, where the equator passes through Macapá Apa do Curiaú (8 km). A quilombola village of descendants of escaped slaves, which continues its traditional commemorations such as Marabaixo. You can also try gengibirra, a drink made from cachaça and ginger. 
Cannon at the Fort of Macapá Fort Park (Parque do Forte) (next to the fort). Park with walkways along the riverbank, playground, fountain and lawns. 
 Marco Zero (Right south of the city). Closed on Mondays. Where the equator comes through, and even crosses a football stadium! It is marked by a small monument. At the spring and autumn equinox, the sun rises and sets on the equator and shines in the circle at the top of the monument. Other than that, there is not much to see. The only reason to see this is to say you've been at 0 degrees latitude putting one foot in the northern hemisphere and one foot in the southern hemisphere. If you come by taxi, ask the driver to wait the 5 minutes it takes you to take a picture. But there is also an express bus that goes there from the city center and the bus going to the Universidade also passes by. Entrance is free. (updated Jan 2022)
