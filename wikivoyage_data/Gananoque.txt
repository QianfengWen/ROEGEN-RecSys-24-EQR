1000 Islands Playhouse
Gananoque is a town of about 5,400 people (2021) in Eastern Ontario in the Thousand Islands region on the St. Lawrence River.


Understand[edit]
Gananoque traces its history to United Empire Loyalist times; after the American Revolution, Loyalist militia Colonel Joel Stone received a land grant and established a mill site in 1789, The town was attacked during the War of 1812 and stores in the government depot looted by Americans. A five-gun Gananoque Blockhouse, completed in 1813 to defend against further US attacks, stood until 1852.
The Gananoque River watershed was an important water transportation corridor, extending north to the Rideau River watershed. In 1830, water was diverted westward to the Cataraqui River as part of the Rideau Canal, redirecting this traffic to Kingston. A short-line railway, built to haul timber for river shipment, carried mainline passengers to the Gananoque waterfront from 1884 to 1962; the right-of-way is now a hiking trail.
