Valparaíso is a city of almost 300,000 people (2017) on the Pacific coast of Central Chile. Frequently referred to as simply Valpo, it is about 120 km west of the capital, Santiago. The city is widely known for its bohemian culture, brightly colored houses, and beautiful seaside views.

Understand[edit]
Valparaiso is an important port town, and has been for hundreds of years, resulting in its being made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2003.
Its location on the shipping routes before the completion of the Panama Canal, has left a legacy that still can be seen in various features of the old port town. Its location in the earthquake zone, and the disastrous earthquake of 1906, is another legacy. There have been more recent earthquakes as well.
The old town is surrounded with features that reflect the rich maritime heritage, and an important location of Chilean national pride - where its naval mastery was challenged and maintained.
When roaming the chaotic, hilly streets, and taking in the views and ambience, you are not just experiencing the port and the colorful houses, or the funicular railways, but a complex history of Chilean national identity and politics.
The old town can be compared to the more modern Vina del Mar just to the north, and the hinterland that leads over to Santiago.
There is also an active nightlife and a constantly changing variety of artistic events.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Valparaiso does not have its own airport. The closest airport with commercial service is Arturo Merino Benitez International Airport (SCL IATA) in Santiago, some 1½ hr away, which offers extensive domestic and international service.
To get to Valparaíso from Santiago's airport, requires catching a bus heading to Pajaritos from outside of the airport terminal.
This will drop you off at the north side of "Pajaritos" a bus/subway station on the outskirts of Santiago, cross to the south side of the subway station to get to the bus platform.
From here, buses leave frequently for Valparaiso and other destinations; you may also take the subway into downtown Santiago. It is generally not necessary to have a bus ticket before arriving at Pajaritos. A ticket between Pajaritos and the airport with Centropuerto bus company is 1700 pesos.

By train[edit]
The Metro Valparaíso or Merval runs between Valparaiso and Limache, as well as surrounding communities including Viña del Mar. It runs from 06:00 to 23:30, and is new, clean and fast. Adult fares range from 204 pesos to 1080 pesos depending on the time of day and the distance travelled, but value cards of a minimum of 1200 pesos must be used; single tickets are not sold.

By car[edit]
While Valparaiso can be a bit of a difficult city in which to drive, the area's highway system is generally of good quality. There are often tolls on highways.

By bus[edit]
Buses from a wide variety of destinations within Chile have scheduled service to Valparaiso, in addition to service to the Argentine city of Mendoza. The bus terminal is near the National Congress building.
Approximate bus travel times to Valparaiso:

1.5 hr: Santiago (many times every hour, the trip may take much longer if there's congestion)
7 hr: La Serena (every other hour)
12 hr: Mendoza, Argentina (the road may be closed in winter due to bad weather)
Local buses also ply between Viña del Mar and Valparaiso, taking about 15 minutes each way. Fares range from 350 to 380 pesos.

By boat[edit]
Some cruise ships dock in Valparaiso, mostly as part of a long South American itinerary. Also possible is a Freighter Cruise from Mexico, taking two weeks and making several stops along the way.

Get around[edit]
Map of Valparaíso
By bus[edit]
The city micros are run by Transporte Metropolitano Valparaíso [dead link]. Exact routes and fares can be found under "Empresas" on the website, and single journeys cost about 250 pesos for local routes and 300 pesos for routes running between El Plan and the hills.

By taxi[edit]
Colectivos are taxis painted in black with yellow roofs that run fixed routes, and are a very common mode of transport between (and within) Valparaiso, Viña del Mar, and other surrounding areas. The cost of the trip, while more expensive than the bus or metro, depends upon the distance being traveled following a system of zones. There are also regular taxis that do custom rides, but they are less common and more expensive. This type of taxis often congregate in the area around the Plaza Anibal Pinto.

By train[edit]
The light-rail system, Metro Valparaíso or Merval, runs along the coast. It starts at Valparaiso's port and heads into Viña del Mar, reaching Limache through Quilpué and Villa Alemana. The metro provides quick access to major places of interest, and is only slightly more expensive than taking public buses. Adult fares range from 204 to 1,080 pesos depending on the time of day and the distance travelled, but value cards of a minimum of 1,350 pesos must be used; single tickets are not sold.

Funicular in Valparaiso
By funicular[edit]
Ascensores, funiculars, ply between El Plan, or the coastal strip, with the cerros, or hillside communities. They are for the most part old and creaky, but generally reliable. There were historically a bigger number operating in the past. Check - as some close for repairs or simply don't operate any more. The fare may sometimes differ between going up and going down, but cost about 300 pesos each way. The ascensors are a unique mode of transportation in Valparaiso, and offer gorgeous views of the cityscape, port, and the Pacific Ocean. A particularly interesting one is the Polanco. This is located just off Avenida Argentina at Simpson. Rather than a funicular, it is the only vertical elevator whose entrance is at street level. You walk through a 150-m-long tunnel where it can take you to two distinct levels, the highest of which is a tower, an excellent place to get a great view of the city, being 60 m above the entrance.

 Funiculars. Going to Valparaiso and not going on the ascensores (inclines) is like going to Venice and not taking a ride on a Gondola, only that the ascensores cost as little as 100 pesos. They are also of practical use as they help many local people get to the higher parts of town, saving them from having to walk otherwise long and steep pedestrian routes. Many however are undergoing repair or do not run at all, however even then they allow for some interesting pictures. (updated Apr 2018)

Stay safe[edit]
In the context of Chile being a relatively safe country, Valparaiso is among its more dangerous locales, like many harbour cities around the world. Mainly, watch out for pickpockets, for instance avoid hanging your purse or bag in the back of your chair when seated, because it may get stolen. Violent crime is very uncommon, but normal precautionary measures should be taken; while in the street, do not display expensive jewelry. The port area (called "Puerto") is generally considered to be dangerous even during the day.
