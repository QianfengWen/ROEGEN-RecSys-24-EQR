Überlingen is a city of 23,000 people (2020) in the south of Baden-Württemberg in southern Germany. It is part of the Bodensee region (Lake Constance) bordering Austria, Switzerland and Germany.


Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
Überlingen is serviced by Germany's Deutsche Bahn[dead link] railway and bus network. The main line from Basel Bad (Switzerland) to Ulm runs through Überlingen. Routes from Zurich to Stuttgart offer transfers at Singen to go to Überlingen.

By bus[edit]
Regional bus line 7395 runs between Überlingen and Friedrichshafen (Hafen) every half-hour during the week, hourly on weekends. There is a stop at the car and passenger ferry in Meersburg, and several of the smaller towns, such as Hagnau, along the lakeshore route.
The long-distance bus company Flixbus makes stops at the central bus station next to the main train stop in Überlingen on an irregular schedule. Regularly served Flixbus stops can be found in Meersburg, Konstanz or Radolfzell.

By bicycle[edit]
There is a bicycle circuit the entire way around Lake Constance, passing through Überlingen. There's a free air-pump station at the main train stop.

By boat[edit]
There are also ferries operating from other cities bordering Lake Constance, including Constance, Meersburg, Rorschach and Bregenz (Austria).  The Meersburg-Constance ferry includes car service.
A seasonal boat service operates three times a day on the route: Bodman - Ludwigshafen - Sipplingen - Überlingen.

Get around[edit]
47°46′28″N 9°9′18″EMap of Überlingen

There are 8 local bus routes around town which converge at the central bus station next to the main train stop.[dead link] The German train service has three stops (Therme, Mitte and Nussdorf) in Überlingen, but the fast regional trains (IRE) serve only the central stop. Much of Überlingen, though hilly, is walkable, particularly along the lakeside promenade. Bicycles are also an excellent form of transport.
The center of Überlingen is a pedestrian area and cars are discouraged, in part through the lack of parking spots. There are three public parking garages (first 30 minutes are free) and two open-air car parks, including a park-and-ride car park at the northwest edge of town (near the hospital), which includes a day-pass for public transportation.
