Understand[edit]
Emmaville Post Office
Emmaville located within the country of the indigenous Ngarabal people. Their name for the district is 'Marran' which means 'plenty of leeches'. Tin was discovered on the nearby property 'Strathbogie Station' in 1872 and the settlement was originally named 'Vegetable Creek' after the Chinese market gardens supplying the miners. The name of the settlement was changed to its present name in 1882. Emmaville's main industries are tourism, agriculture, and mining. A creature named The Emmaville Panther was sighted in the district in the 1950s and 1960s, believed to be a big cat that had escaped from a travelling circus. Emmaville is known for good fishing and fossicking.
Emmaville is in the Glen Innes Severn Council Local Government Area.
