Panorama of Poughkeepsie
Poughkeepsie is the name of both a town and a city in Dutchess County in New York's Hudson Valley. The City of Poughkeepsie is along the Hudson River on its eastern shore, where the river marks the boundary of the city and of the county (Ulster County is on the other side). The Town of Poughkeepsie encompasses surrounding areas of Dutchess County bordering on the city, and is more suburban in character.


Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Stewart International Airport, 1180 First St, New Windsor, +1 845 564-2100. The closest major airport, but offers few direct flights to major destinations.
Westchester County Airport}, 240 Airport Road, White Plains, +1 914 995-4860 (airlines). Two counties away, but an alternative to the congestion of the 3 major international airports around New York City. Rental cars available.
Newark Liberty International Airport, Newark, New Jersey, John F. Kennedy International Airport, and LaGuardia Airport: Livery cars offer service to and from 3 major international airports. It is possible in a convoluted sort of way to get to and from JFK via Metro-North Railroad and New York City Transit.
By car[edit]
US Route 9 passes through Poughkeepsie in the north-south direction, so you can get there on it by heading north from New York City or south from Albany (or beyond in the Adirondacks), though people usually use expressways for at least part of those trips rather than taking Route 9 all the way.
US Route 44 and New York State Route 55 pass concurrently through the city of Poughkeepsie in an east-west direction (forming the East-West Arterial, with the westbound and eastbound lanes on separate streets several blocks apart). East of the city, the two routes split, with US-44 heading northeast and NY-55 southeast, both in the direction of Connecticut. To the west, they cross the Hudson River (on the Mid-Hudson Bridge, a toll bridge) and head towards the Catskills.
Interstate 84 goes through Fishkill, south of Poughkeepsie, where you can take it west from Connecticut or east from Pennsylvania, then get off at exit 13 and take Route 9 north to Poughkeepsie.
The New York Thruway (Interstate 87) is west of the Hudson River, where you can get from it to Poughkeepsie by getting off at New Paltz (exit 18) or Newburgh (exit 17) and crossing the river to the east. It runs between New York City and Buffalo by way of Albany.
