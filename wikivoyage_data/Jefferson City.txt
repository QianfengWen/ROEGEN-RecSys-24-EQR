Understand[edit]
State Capitol
Jefferson City is named for the third President of the United States, Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson was the president responsible for the Louisiana Purchase.  Some of the land from that purchase eventually became the State of Missouri.

Tourist information[edit]
Visit Jefferson City
Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Jefferson is centrally located in the State of Missouri about half-way between St. Louis and Kansas City along the Missouri River.  There are three major highways that run directly through the city: US 50, 54, and 63.

By plane[edit]
Jefferson City Memorial Airport, which is across the Missouri River, only serves general aviation.
The closest airport with commercial service is Columbia Regional Airport, from which US Highway 63 goes straight to Jefferson City. American Airlines is the only carrier at the airport, with daily non-stop flights between Columbia and Chicago (ORD) or Dallas (DFW).
The closest full-scale commercial airport is Lambert St. Louis International Airport, about two hours away.  It is very easy to get from the St. Louis airport to Jefferson City.  Take I-70 west out of St. Louis for about an hour and a half.  At this point take US Highway 54 south for about 30 minutes until you reach Jefferson City.
A little further is the Kansas City International Airport, about three hours away.

By train[edit]
The Amtrak Station is in the heart of Downtown Jefferson City at 101 Jefferson Street. At the midpoint of the Kansas City to St. Louis route, the Missouri River Runner, there are two departures each direction every day.  While a ticket is not needed to board the train, a reservation is. Call 800-USA-Rail or visit Amtrak for reservations and schedule information.

When it was all over, four inmates were killed and millions of dollars of damage had been done.
