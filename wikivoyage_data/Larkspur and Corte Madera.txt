Downtown Larkspur
The "twin cities" of Larkspur and Corte Madera are a pair of towns in Marin County in the San Francisco Bay Area of California. Larkspur is the main gateway to Marin by ferry, while Corte Madera is known for upscale shopping.


Get in[edit]
0°0′0″N 0°0′0″EMap of Larkspur and Corte Madera
Most people drive. Bus service is provided by Marin Transit.
Larkspur is the location of the 37.944832-122.5088241 Larkspur Ferry Terminal, with Golden Gate Ferry service from San Francisco.
The SMART light rail system serves Larkspur Landing (where the ferry terminal is) from San Rafael, Novato, Petaluma, Cotati, Rohnert Park, and Santa Rosa.
From San Francisco International Airport, the Marin Airporter stops in Larkspur.
It's very feasible to bike in from San Rafael, Mill Valley, or elsewhere, and it's also possible to walk to Larkspur from San Rafael using the bike path that hugs the SMART tracks. Walking from Mill Valley is more of a challenge; it's possible by walking on the Horse Hill bike path that hugs the west side of 101, but at the north end of this path you'll have to take Meadowsweet Drive, which has no sidewalks but is quiet enough that pedestrians do use it.

Get around[edit]
Aside from the downtown cores, this is not a particularly pedestrian-oriented area. Sidewalks exist but are sometimes inconsistent. Biking is convenient and popular, though.

Do[edit]
The Fourth of July parade
37.925641-122.5255261 Fourth of July Parade. Larkspur and Corte Madera have a shared Fourth of July parade every year, starting at Redwood High School in Larkspur and ending at Town Center in Corte Madera. If the county fair in San Rafael is a bit much for you, join the festivities here instead, where you'll see classic cars; local figures like the Twin Cities' mayors, citizens of the year, and beautification committees; local kids' sports teams; and maybe a marching band or a cheerleading squad. Food and handicrafts are sold nearby and the event has a community feel. (updated Jul 2023)
