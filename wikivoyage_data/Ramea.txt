Ramea is a small island village in Southern Newfoundland. In 2004, Ramea was chosen as the site of a hybrid wind-diesel electricity generation project.


Understand[edit]
From 2011 to 2021, its population fell from 526 to 388.
Ramea sits on Northwest Island, one of a group of five major islands off the south coast of Newfoundland. The island is approximately 3.14 km long by 0.93 km wide (1.95 miles by 0.58 miles). The remaining major islands in the archipelago are Great (or Big) Island, Middle Island, Harbour Island, and South West Island.
Ramea is home to a lot of plants, which include the purple pitcher plant and bakeapple. The island and surrounding islands serve as a fall and winter home to many migratory seabirds.

History[edit]
The community was settled in the early 19th century for its proximity to rich fishing grounds and safe anchorages. It became a thriving fishing village. It was probably named for Le Ramée, a street in Saint Peter Port, the capital of Guernsey.
From 1949 to 1970, businesswoman Marie Penny owned and operated John Penny & Sons, one of the largest frozen fish companies in Newfoundland during the 20th century. Since the cod moratorium of 1992, the isolated community has struggled to survive, having declined from a peak population of 1,120 in the 1970s.

Wind energy[edit]
In 2004, Ramea was chosen for the site of Canada's first wind-diesel demonstration project. Six 65 kW wind turbines were installed on the island to demonstrate that the Wind-Diesel Integrated Control System can be used to displace diesel power generation by introducing wind to the island's grid and to show significant energy efficiency and reliability for northern, remote or isolated locations. The wind-diesel pilot program generates around 1 million kWh/yr and offsets approximately 750 tonnes of emissions annually.

Get in[edit]
Ramea is accessible via the Provincial Ferry Service, from either Burgeo or Grey River.

Get around[edit]
The Ferry from Burgeo to Ramea is capable of carrying vehicles, and there are roads in Ramea for cars. The relatively small size (1.89 km2) of the town, however, means that any destination is within walking distance.
