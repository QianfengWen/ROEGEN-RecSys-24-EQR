Roseburg is the county seat of Douglas County, in Southern Oregon and is nestled in the beautiful Umpqua Valley. Roseburg is know for their lumber mills and forest products which they distribute globally. The small town is far from quiet and has quite a bit of history, including a visit from the music legend Johnny Cash, who dedicated the song "Lumberjack" to Roseburg.


Understand[edit]
The Umpqua National Forest, this small town is the gateway to the outdoors. From here you can venture to the Oregon Coast and take a ride in Douglas County's OHV Park or travel up the North Umpqua River along the Highway of Waterfalls to experience the great outdoors. The North Umpqua is also known to be an excellent place for fly fishing while the main Umpqua River is a great place to catch Steelhead and Salmon every year. The Umpqua Valley, in which Roseburg was built, has become a popular place for vineyards if you fancy a day of tasting some of Oregon's finest wines.
Just south of Roseburg is the small town of Winston, where the Wildlife Safari zoo is. The animals roam free there, and it has an excellent cheetah breeding program. Visit, but stay in your car.
