Perdido Key is a barrier island at the western tip of Florida's Panhandle.
Perdido Key is a short distance south west of the city of Pensacola. It is the furthest west beach in Florida, and is described as being one of the most beautiful beaches on the Gulf Coast.


Understand[edit]
Perdido means "lost" in Spanish. This is the Florida experience from years ago but with a modern, upscale twist. Like its sister towns, Perdido Key boasts sugar white sands and crystal water. Although boutiques and quaint eateries dot the landscape in Perdido Key, the area feels somewhat removed, enjoying a slower pace. Boating and fishing are naturals in this relaxed community.
The unspoiled, white sands of Perdido Key enjoy a history rich in lore. Rumor has it that pirates buried treasure along the precarious shoals of Perdido Bay where it enters the Gulf. Today, people still wander the beach hoping to uncover the lost treasures. Because of its unique geography the Key is one of the most natural and beautiful areas along the Gulf Coast. Here, the waves invite laughter and surfing, diving and sport fishing. The back bays and lagoons are ideal for boating or waterskiing. No doubt you'll believe Florida's Perdido Key brims with treasure, whether or not you find anything buried.
