Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Get in[edit]
There's only one road leading here, from Kibber. Buses make the steep slow journey a couple times a day.
Cyclists with legs of steel can (and do) make the climb.

See[edit]
Ki Monastery. If you're lucky enough to be invited to prayers in the morning, be very quiet and respectful, and leave your camera in your room. Expect to try butter tea, if you haven't already... and if you have, suck it up and pretend you like it.
Do[edit]
Eat and sleep[edit]
There are no hotels or restaurants in town, so those wanting to stay the night have but one option:

The Ki Monastery is willing to host foreigners in simple 4-person dorm rooms for a small fee, and will also provide basic meals (dal, rice) and tsampa. This can be a great experience and insight into the lives of monks. While it sees its fair share of tourists trickling through, this is definitely not a tourist attraction, and should not be treated like one. If you visit, and especially if you stay the night, remain aware of where you are, and stay quiet and courteous.
