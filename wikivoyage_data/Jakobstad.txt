Jakobstad (Finnish: Pietarsaari) is a nice small port town in Ostrobothnia. The adjacent municipality of Pedersöre is also handled in this article.


Understand[edit]
The majority of the inhabitants speak Swedish as their native language. The town was founded in 1625 in what is now the neighbouring municipality Pedersöre, but postglacial rebound made that harbour too shallow and the town moved towards the new shoreline. The town grew in the 18th century with privileges for international trade. A replica of a ship of that time, Jacobstads Wapen, was built 1988–1994. In 1900 a tobacco factory was the biggest employer. Nowadays the biggest employer is a cellulose and paper factory. There are several smaller businesses, among them Nautor, making world class Swan sailing yachts.
