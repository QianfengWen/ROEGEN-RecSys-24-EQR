Żywiec is a town in the Silesian Voivodeship of southern Poland, 85 km south of Katowice. It's best known for its brewery and is a resort town, with a large lake, and winter and summer leisure activities in the nearby Beskids mountains. In 2019 its population was 31,000. 


Understand[edit]
Brewed here since 1856
The original village, first documented in 1308, was 2-3 km north down the valley. This site was prone to flooding so in 1448 its inhabitants moved south - they'd be aghast to see it today, deep beneath the waters of Lake Żywiec along with three other villages. The new site acquired a castle and various churches, remaining a small market town with no great mining or textile industry. Swedish troops wrecked it in 1656 but from 1772 Austria was the power in this region, as Poland was carved up. Archduke Albrecht (1817-1895) founded the town's famous brewery in 1856. He also rendered the Austrian army useless by resisting every form of modernisation, laying the seeds of its humiliation in the First World War. This plus the collapse of Imperial Germany and Tsarist Russia created space for Poland to regain its independence in 1918, so toast the Archduke whenever you first sample the local beer - na zdrowie!
The mining and industrial cities to the north had large German populations, and at independence several voted to join Germany not Poland, and the border was re-drawn. No such mix in rural upland Żywiec, and when Germany seized all of Silesia at the onset of the Second World War, they found a 99% Polish population here. They reckoned to adjust that by deporting 95% of the population, exterminating the 4% who were Jewish or otherwise on their death list, and re-settling the area with Germans from further east. This "Action Saybusch" (their name for Żywiec) ran Sept-Dec 1940 and removed some 20,000 locals, who were stripped of their possessions then dumped elsewhere; deportations continued at lower intensity throughout the war. The inevitable post-war reprisal was the ousting of Germans from their long-established settlements across Poland and the Baltic.
The communists carpeted much of Silesia with factory blocks, slag heaps and drab high-rise apartments. The contribution of Żywiec was to power this workers' paradise, by damming the valley in 1966 for a reservoir and hydro-electric scheme. This has created a pleasant recreational lake. Winter sports also developed: the nearby mountains don't much exceed 1000 m so the skiing is beginner-to-nervous-intermediate level. You wouldn't travel far to experience them, but residents of the Katowice metropolis can readily hurl snowboards, children and big bouncy dogs into the back of the car and head off along the motorway.
