Devonport is a seaside suburb on the North Shore of Auckland in New Zealand, directly across the harbour from central Auckland. This article also covers Bayswater.


Understand[edit]
Devonport was one of the earliest parts of Auckland settled by Europeans. It began as a farming and shipbuilding area, and subdivisions in the 1880s resulted in the large wooden villas being built which are very much part of the modern-day charm. It is the location of New Zealand's naval base and the Navy Museum.

Visitor information[edit]
There is a local information centre in a caravan inside the building on the ferry pier. It is usually open 10AM-2PM, and brochures may be available at other times.
Get in[edit]

To get off at Akoranga: if coming from Auckland City the "Esmonde Road" offramp is the one to take.
