Oban (Scottish Gaelic: An t-Òban) is a town in Argyll and Bute on the northwest coast of Scotland. It's a transport hub and most visitors are passing through on the way to the Hebrides, only staying overnight if ferry / train schedules make that necessary; conversely, Hebrideans come here for shopping and other necessities. The main reason to regard Oban as a destination in its own right is for sea sports, including kayaking, scuba-diving, wildlife-watching and fishing. It also has great local sea food. In 2021 the population was 8060. 
Ferries from Oban sail to Lismore, Mull, Colonsay, Coll, Tiree, Barra and Kerrara. Kerrara  is so close that it's effectively an outlying district of Oban, and therefore described on this page.

By plane[edit]
Glasgow Airport (GLA IATA) is closest and has a good range of UK and European flights. Hiring a car, turn west onto M8 then cross Erskine Bridge to join A82 north. By public transport go into central Glasgow for the bus or train to Oban. You could save time by taking a taxi from the airport to Dumbarton Central station, where the Oban trains stop: reckon £20-25.
Edinburgh Airport (EDI IATA) by car doesn't take much longer and has more destinations. It's west of the city so you turn straight onto M9 north.
56.4636-5.41 Oban Airport (OBN  IATA), North Connel PA37 1SW (off A828 north of Connel bridge), ☏ +44 1631 572910. This has Hebridean flights from the islands of Coll, Colonsay, Islay and Tiree. It's basically an airborne school bus service, using BNF Islanders, with a 10-kg total baggage limit. Oban has no flights from the mainland UK network.   (updated Apr 2023)

By train[edit]
Trains from Glasgow Queen Street run up the West Highland Line, taking 3 hours 10 min to Oban via Dumbarton Central, Helensburgh Upper and Crianlarich (where a portion divides for Fort William and Mallaig). There are six M-Sa, with the first running north around 5:20AM for 8:40AM, the last at 6:20PM for 9:30PM. Southbound back to Glasgow the first is around 5:20AM, the last at 8:30PM. There's only three trains on Sunday.
Oban railway station is in town centre next to the ferry terminal. It has a staffed ticket office, toilets and waiting room. There is step-free access to all platforms.

By bus[edit]
By bus: Citylink 975 / 976 / 977 runs six times a day from Glasgow Buchanan station, either via Arrochar, Inveraray and Taynuilt, or via Crianlarich, Tyndrum and Taynuilt, taking 3 hr 10 min to Oban. 
Bus 978 runs daily from Edinburgh and takes 4 hours via Edinburgh airport, Grangemouth, Stirling, Doune, Callander, Crianlarich, Dalmally and Taynuilt.
West Coast Motors Bus 918 runs twice M-Sa from Fort William (90 min), where it connects with the bus from Inverness. 
Bus 418 runs five times M-Sa across Clachan Bridge to the island of Seil, connecting with the ferries to Luing and Easdale. 
The bus terminus in Oban is by the railway station and ferry terminal.

By road[edit]
From Glasgow follow A82 north to Crianlarich then A85 west to Oban, 100 miles, say 2 hr 30 min as it's a busy undivided highway. From Edinburgh take M9 to Dunblane then A84 and A85 through Doune and Callander.
Connel Bridge, which carries A828 north to Ballachulish and Fort William, is being upgraded in 2023 / 24, and this means periods of closure — check ahead for these.
A good choice in town for overnight parking, if space is available, is the railway station car park. It's out of the usual trajectory of late-night drunks and in 2023 costs £3 for 24 hours. An old sign warns that your ticket expires at midnight, but that's not correct.

By boat[edit]
McCaig's Tower
56.4122-5.47622 Oban Ferry Terminal is the port for Calmac car ferries to  Lismore, Mull, Coll, Tiree, Colonsay and Barra. There's also a weekly ferry to Islay, but you're better sailing via  Kennacraig. See the island pages for details of these and alternative routes. Oban ferry terminal is next to the railway station. By road you may think you've overshot, as you reach south edge of town, then you come to a sharp right. If you pass the lifeboat station you've gone too far. 
Booking ahead is always wise, and it's essential for caravans and motorhomes - these are not permitted to join the unbooked stand-by queue. You'd be sent away to make a booking, and if you couldn't sail that day, at least you'd have accommodation. This rule improves space in the queue but is more about capacity to shoehorn cars into odd spaces on the ferry, that couldn't possibly fit a caravan. The policy applies to all Calmac ports (except a few minor "turn up and go" routes) but is especially relevant to the major outbound port of Oban. 
Also with a caravan or motorhome, in summer be prepared at check-in to show a pitch reservation at your destination, else you may be turned away. All the Scottish islands have a problem in summer with visitor vehicles camping illegally on the verges and passing places.
See "Get around" for routes to the nearby islands in Loch Linnhe.
56.45-5.4323 Dunstaffnage Marina is the port for small private craft, on A85 five miles north of town. Cruises of the Hebrides often depart from here.

Get around[edit]
Most sights in town can be reached on foot, but some accommodation is up a fairly steep hill.
West Coast Motors run buses in and around Oban. The only one you're likely to use is the 005 / 405, which runs north hourly M-Sa to Dunbeg (a one-mile walk to Dunstaffnage), Connel bridge, Oban Airport, Benderloch and Barcaldine.
Kerrera: Calmac ferries sail from Gallanach, the jetty 3 miles south of Oban, to Kerrara, taking only 5 min. There are over a dozen ferries daily, year-round; mid-morning and mid-afternoon they're every 30 min. Until end of March 2025 the return fare is £3.70 adult, £1.90 child aged 5-15. Visitor cars are not carried and you don't need one; bikes are free but space is limited.

St Columba's Cathedral
56.4157-5.46921 McCaig’s Tower, Duncraggan Rd PA34 5DP. 24 hours. John Stuart McCaig (1823-1902), a local banker, was aiming for something like the Colosseum in Rome. At his death only the granite circular shell was complete, resembling a vast salad-drainer with its lancet windows, and dominating the view for miles around. Inside is simply a public garden and picnic spot where the pipe band sometimes plays, and the museum, art gallery and heroic statues of himself and family never happened. You can approach via "Jacob's Ladder", the steps from the Esplanade. Free.   (updated Apr 2023)
56.4122-5.46762 Oban Hydro (A footpath winds up from Rockfield Rd.). was once as distinctive and hollow a monument on the skyline as McCaig's Tower, but has crumbled behind the engulfing jungle. It was built from 1881 as a spa hotel, but they grossly underestimated the cost, and it was abandoned when almost complete. The shareholders might have persevered if they foresaw what people pay nowadays to be assaulted with green mud.   (updated Mar 2024)

56.4167-5.47354 St John's Cathedral (Cathedral Church of St John the Divine), 129 George St PA34 4NT, ☏ +44 1631 562323. Scottish Episcopal (Anglican) Cathedral hidden among the shops. Building started in 1863 and continued in several phases but lack of funds resulted in the present odd layout, with steel girders propping up unfinished work.   (updated Apr 2023)
56.4194-5.47895 St Columba's Cathedral, 200 Corran Esplanade PA34 5AA, ☏ +44 1631 562123. The Roman Catholic Cathedral was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott (who designed the iconic red telephone box) and built in Neo-Gothic style between 1932 and 1959. In medieval times the area's senior church was St Moluag's on the Isle of Lismore, nowadays a Church of Scotland parish church. The RC Diocese of Argyll and The Isles was re-established in 1878 but bishop and congregation were in makeshift premises, including a tin hut, until St Columba's was completed.   (updated Apr 2023)
Dunollie Lighthouse is on Ganavan Road 200 yards south of the turn-off to the castle. It's a 20-foot tower first lit in 1892 and more accurately described as a "sector light" - the colour displayed indicates whether you're too far east or west, or correctly positioned entering the narrow channel to Oban harbour.
The Dog Stone just north of the lighthouse was once a sea stack and is now on a raised beach ashore. Legend invokes the Bran the dog of Fingal McCool, but truth is stranger: a flash flood in a desert 415 million years ago heaped up boulders that became conglomerated.
56.4266-5.48446 Dunollie Castle, Dunollie House (a mile north of town off Ganavan Rd), ☏ +44 1631 570550. Apr-Oct: Su-F 10AM-4PM.

56.571539-5.3861929 Castle Stalker, Appin PA38 4BL (off A828 north of Port Appin), ☏ +44 1631 730354. A well-preserved four-storey tower house on a tidal islet in Loch Linnhe, built from 1440. "Stalker" is from Gaelic Stalcaire, a hunter or falconer - King James IV often used it as a hunting lodge in the 1490s. The castle changed hands several times, often with murder involved (the last such being in Sarawak in 1947), and its last military role was as a government stronghold in the 1745 rebellion. It fell derelict from 1800 but was restored 1965-75. Tours are offered Apr-Sept but need high tide for boat access, the low tide causeway is too rough and slippery — see the castle website for availability. The photogenic site is sometimes a film location, best known is as "Castle Aaarrrrgghh" in Monty Python and the Holy Grail. To just admire the exterior, either have a cuppa at Castle Stalker View Cafe to use their car park, or use the free car park a mile north, and pick up the coast footpath. Adult £25, child £12.

Connect[edit]
As of April 2023, Oban and its approach roads have 4G from all UK carriers. Finish any important calls before taking the ferry, as coverage is patchy further west. 5G has not reached this area.

Go next[edit]
Sail west on a ferry. A day trip is enough to see  Lismore; Mull and Iona can be done as a day trip but deserve longer. Further away are Coll, Tiree, Colonsay, Barra and South Uist.
Go north to Fort William for Ben Nevis, and routes to Loch Ness and Skye.
Go south for the bridge to Seil, which along with Luing and Easdale islands was once quarried for slate.
Further south see Arduaine Garden, the extensive prehistoric area of  Kilmartin, and  Tarbert which has ferries to Islay.
Go southeast towards Glasgow, seeing Inveraray, the  Cowal peninsula and Loch Lomond.
