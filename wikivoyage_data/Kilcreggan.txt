Kilcreggan is a village in Argyll and Bute, on the tip of the Rosneath peninsula. To the east of the peninsula is Gare Loch, west is Loch Long (both narrow but deep fjords), and south is the Firth of Clyde. So it's somewhat isolated by land, but grew up in the 19th century when Clyde steamers linked it to Glasgow, and city merchants began to establish their summer homes and residences here. In 2021 the population of the Rosneath peninsula was 1320. 


Get in[edit]
Painted Rock
By road Kilcreggan is 16 miles from Helensburgh and 40 miles from Glasgow. From A82 take A814 through Helensburgh to Garelochhead then down the Rosneath peninsula.
Garelochhead Bus 316 runs M-Sa every two hours from Helensburgh via Rhu, Faslane, Garelochhead, Clynder, Rosneath, Kilcreggan (40 min) and Cove to Coulport navy base. 
By boat is the quickest method by public transport. See Gourock for the foot-passenger ferry across the Clyde, which takes 15 min and sails M-Sa hourly 7AM-6PM. Gourock has trains every 15 minutes from Glasgow Central, taking 40-50 min. 
55.9847-4.82041 Kilcreggan ferry pier is village centre. The ferry between Kilcreggan and Helensburgh was axed in 2012. The paddle steamer Waverley occasionally sails to Kilcreggan in summer.
The nearest railway station you can reach overland is Garelochhead, which only has 3-4 trains a day on the West Highland Line from Glasgow to Crianlarich, where they divide for Oban or Fort William. Helensburgh Central has trains from Glasgow Queen Street every 30 minutes.

See[edit]
Painted rocks: there's a tradition of painting the large glacial boulders along the beach, one example being "Tut-Tut" as it spoofed a pharaoh's head. This tradition is over a century old, as "Para Handy" in Neil Munro's tales of the Clyde Puffers once claimed to have painted several. These artworks come and go as wind and waves scour away the paint and other artists see opportunities. So just look out for examples.
55.9857-4.80831 Portkil Battery, reached from Kilcreggan on Fort Road, was an artillery position defending the sea approaches to Clydeside - given its construction 1900-04 it was the French they thought likeliest to attack. The remains are scrappy and are gradually being cleared away for housing.
