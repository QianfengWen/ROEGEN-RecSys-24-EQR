For other places with the same name, see Kuta (disambiguation).

Kuta is the best known  tourist resort area on the island of Bali, Indonesia. With a long broad Indian Ocean beach-front, Kuta was discovered by tourists as a surfing paradise.  It has long been a popular stop on the classic Banana Pancake Trail backpacking route in South-East Asia. 


Understand[edit]
Kuta
Back in the 1980s they used to talk about the three Ks: Kathmandu in Nepal, Khao San Road in Bangkok and Kuta. Today Kuta still attracts some hardcore backpackers as well as families and tourists from all over the world, and is most notably a playground for young visitors from Australia.
Due to the ever increasing popularity of Bali, Kuta is continually developing, and is not short of unsightly, poorly planned buildings. It is chaotic, overcrowded and congested. However, amongst all the mayhem this place somehow works, and hundreds of thousands of visitors enjoy their time in Kuta every year.
Infrastructure has come a long way in Kuta, although it is still insufficient for the amount of visitors who stay in the area. Some side alleys still have significant potholes and road rules still don't mean very much. Most roads are constantly busy with motor scooters, metered taxis and private cars. Instead of using signals, locals and the seasoned travellers honk their motor vehicles to signal overtaking or squeezing into a tight spot near you. Cars often fold in their side mirrors when negotiating narrow single lanes with parked vehicles. Now you can access free Wi-Fi in local convenience stores, restaurants, cafes and hotels. There are half a dozen prepaid mobile phone sim cards available everywhere with competitive top up plans. Touts will persistently try to get you to buy something from them, whether you're walking on the streets or seated in a restaurant.
The 5-km-long sandy stretch of Kuta is among the best beachfronts in Bali. The beach is safe, mostly clean, and well-maintained with areas for different activities. The beach nearest to the sea is for sunbathing and no hawkers will annoy you. Behind it is for beach vendors such as massages, hair braiding, and surf boards and maybe they will annoy you when you enter their area. And near the half-body fence wall is area for vendors, mostly from East Java, who sell cigarettes, foods and drinks, cheaply, so many taxi drivers buy over the fence wall. These areas are cool under the trees. The long wide stretch of sand is often full of sunbathers and although most of the serious surfers have moved on to newer pastures, there are still plenty of surf dudes around at most times of the year, and especially so during peak season. As you move north along the beach to first Legian and then Seminyak and Petitenget it becomes progressively quieter and less frenetic.
The area of south Kuta closest to the airport is more correctly known as Tuban, but this name is rarely used.
Once the sun goes down, Kuta is the rough and ready party zone of Bali. Even the most hardened of party animal will find something to please them on Jalan Legian at night.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Ngurah Rai International Airport, also known as Denpasar International Airport (DPS IATA), is in fact directly south of Kuta, about 15 minutes away by taxi. More information about the airport is in the main Bali article.
The prepaid fare from the airport to Kuta is around Rp120,000. If you don't have too much luggage, you can save some money by walking 200 metres out of the airport area, and take a metered taxi (taksi berargo) from a company that does not pay service fees to the airport authority and is therefore not allowed to enter the airport to pick up customers. For example, a metered taxi from Bali Taksi (+62 361 701111) will run to about Rp30,000 for the same trip. You could book a fixed price taxi via a smart phone app such as Grab (cars and motorbikes) or Gojek (cars and motorbikes). Go up lift or escalators to 3rd level. Use the airport's free Wi-Fi to book before walking outside. Grab taxis typically wait on the other side of the elevated road inside multi-story carpark's top level C (A and B below it) and will likely give you a column number to meet at, such as C81. You can also catch a bemo from outside the airport to Kuta for Rp5,000-10,000. If you can find one as they are rare now. Or many passengers booked car rental by online and the car will be delivered to the airport for free.

By car[edit]
Kuta is reached by the main Jalan Ngurah Rai bypass from points north (Denpasar, Sanur and Ubud), and south (Jimbaran, Nusa Dua and Uluwatu. If you are coming in from Seminyak be sure to take the Jalan Sunset bypass and not the congested beach route along Jalan Raya Seminyak and Jalan Legian.

By bus[edit]
Kuta is connected by bus routes from all areas of Bali. There are various scheduled shuttle services including Perama. Perama shuttle buses to Kuta leave from Sanur, Ubud, Candidasa, Padang Bai and Lovina.

By public bus[edit]
From Denpasar, Teman bus K1B (Trans Metro Dewata) ends in Sentral Parkir Kuta, Rp4,400.
From Ubud, chain bus K4B (switch at stop Titi Banda, right side of road) and K5B (back of city, stops Simpang Dewa Ruci, Sunset barat, or sentral parkir kuta), Rp4,400 each, only with bank transport card or qris, no cash, about 1 hr 45 min trip.

By bemo[edit]
As elsewhere in Bali, bemos (motorised trycles) are rarer and far less important in Kuta than they used to be. This reflects both the increased number of Balinese who are wealthy enough to afford their own transport, and the huge expansion of tourism in Bali. Bemo Corner, in the heart of Kuta at the junction of Jalan Legian and Jalan Raya Kuta, used to be an institution on the backpacker circuit. These days it is almost irrelevant, but the little blue buses are still there albeit in greatly reduced numbers, and they will still try to charge you five times the real rate.
Kuta is served with some regularity from Denpasar's Tegal bemo terminal.

By boat[edit]
Benoa Harbor — not to be confused with Tanjung Benoa — is around 20 min northeast of Kuta, and speedboats and cruises from the Gili Islands, Lombok and Nusa Lembongan arrive here. Most companies operating from Benoa offer free pick-up and drop-off in and around Kuta.

Get around[edit]
Map of Kuta
Kuta Beach front
Kuta stretches along the beachfront all the way from the airport to Legian, and small lanes lead from the beaches into the densely populated accommodation zone. To avoid traffic-related frustrations, the best option is a combination of walking in small lanes and using metred taxis or a rented motorbike for longer excursions.

By car[edit]
Traffic jams are a constant hassle here and especially so when it is raining. It is often best to park your car before you reach central Kuta, and then walk in. The centre is only about 1.5 km long and 500 metres wide but when stuck in traffic you might easily spend 30 minutes or more to travel these short distances.
There are some designated parking areas in the middle of Kuta (usually Rp5,000 for an unlimited stay) including a large one on Jalan Legian near the top of Poppies II. There are also public parking bays on Jalan Pantai Kuta right beside the beach, but these can get very busy.
Finding a rental car company is easy in Kuta, especially in Poppies I and Poppies II. A small rental car starts from Rp140,000 with third party insurance. Add another Rp100,000 or so for a comprehensive cover. Check your rental contract for specifics before signing. The rental car can be driven to your accommodation for pick up.

By shuttle bus[edit]
South Bali has a public local shuttle bus service called Kura Kura Bus. The bus service connects popular tourist areas daily from 08:30 until 22:00 (depending on the line). Flat fare rates for a single journey. Rates vary for each line. Kuta, Legia, Seminyak are all Rp20,000. Jimabaran and Sanur are Rp40,000. Nusa Dua and South Nusa Dua is Rp50,000. Ubud is Rp80,000.

By taxi[edit]
Metered taxis (taksi berargo) are ubiquitous on the streets of Kuta and are a relatively cheap and reliable way to get around, especially at night. Avoid any taxi where the driver refuses to put the meter on. This is increasingly rare but you will still find the odd taxi driver who is stuck in a 1990s timewarp. It's still a common problem at night time along the main bar and club stretch of Jalan Legian.
The largest, most reputable and most reliable taxi operators are Bluebird and Bali Taksi. Sometimes these taxis are not available at night in the immediate vicinity of discos and bars as other smaller companies may have exclusive arrangements with these businesses. However, the more reputable and reliable taxis can be found easily by walking a little up the street. It would be in your interests to seek out a Bluebird taxi in this situation.
Since BlueBird and Bali Taxi have the best reputations, a number of other drivers have started to try and make their taxis look very similar, using blue vehicles with names like Taxi Bali, or a logo that's similar to the BlueBird. Look very carefully, sometimes at first glance the imitators can be quite convincing.
If you wish to use a taxi ensure the destination is clear with the driver before you enter the taxi and that the driver will be using the meter. If the driver does not agree to use the meter seek another taxi.
Having entered the taxi ensure the driver understands the destination requirement and turns on the meter (argo). At the end of the journey pay the amount showing on the meter. Do not accept any requests from the driver for extra payment or surcharges of any kind other than the payment of tolls or parking fees, these are the responsibility of the passenger, not the driver.
The driver may not provide change if you only have large notes, ensure you obtain smaller notes prior to travel or stop on-route, otherwise you will most likely have to round-up the payment and not receive any change.
To avoid paying too much or to avoid the haggling, try using a smart app booking service such as GrabTaxi. You are more likely to find a driver if you position yourself at an easy and convenient location for pick up on a major road and by a well known place such as outside a KFC or mini mart and not down a narrow alleyway.

By motorbike[edit]
Those with a sense of adventure should try hopping on the back of a local scooter. They are always looking for a passenger, making negotiation easier and more successful. This type of informal transport is called an ojek and is fast and cheap. It is now possible to download booking apps for finding ojek drivers at fixed rates, including insurance. For example Go-Jek.
You can choose to rent a scooter for your stay. There are literally thousands of scooters available for rent: these should cost no more than Rp60,000-70,000 per day rental, and between Rp45,000-50,000 per day for rental of a week or more. Insist on a helmet for the motorcycle, for both your own safety and because wearing a helmet is a legal requirement in Indonesia; you will be stopped by the police and fined for riding without a helmet. It should be understood that the streets can be chaotic and dangerous for inexperienced riders so consider carefully before renting a motorcycle. If you intend to surf, there are plenty of specially modified motorbikes with surfboard hangers.

By bicycle[edit]
You could hire a bicycle to get around on, it would save on too much walking or needing to pay for taxis. Sadly there are not many places to rent bicycles in Bali anymore except in Sanur. If you want a good quality bicycle to rent the try Bali Bike hire. They can deliver bicycles to you if needed.
Bicycle sharing company oBike were operating in Kuta using a smart phone app but it seems they have stopped operating. A few obikes can still be seen parked up. (July 2019).

On foot[edit]
Kuta has become quite more pleasant to walk, with pavements being reformed and touting on the streets dramatically reduced. Kuta beach contains a long walking lane which is surprisingly almost free of touts. In busy roads, guards help pedestrians to cross the street. On narrow streets, pedestrians need to share the road with motorbikes, which isn't particularly dangerous but requires constant attention.

See[edit]
Bali Bomb Memorial on Jalan Legian, Kuta
Surfing, shopping & partying are the three main events in Kuta, and interesting attractions are very thin on the ground. The beach is of course very scenic here, if nearly always crowded.

-8.717193115.174491 Bali Bomb Memorial. This is a memorial to the 202 victims who died when bombs were detonated on 12 October 2002. It can be found on Jl Legian opposite the corner of Poppies II. This is the former site of the old Paddy's Bar, and opposite the former site of the Sari Club, which is still an empty space, next to the Billabong shop. Every year on the anniversary date there is a ceremony mourning those killed or wounded by the bombs. Whilst viewing the memorial, please be calm and silent out of respect. The local Balinese will often be curious to learn if you knew or were related to any of the victims. (updated Apr 2022)
Beach offerings. In the mornings you regularly see Balinese people throwing offerings into the sea, especially when Nyepi is approaching. The best spot is the temple right next to the beach about 200-250 m to the north of the Hard Rock Hotel.
Hard Rock Hotel is something of a tourist attraction and is definitely worth a look and the odd photo.
Do[edit]
Surfing[edit]
Kuta is a well known destination amongst surfing enthusiasts. A long sandy beach with a lack of dangerous rocks or coral, makes the area attractive for beginners.

 Bali learn to surf. Has an office at the Hard Rock Hotel, as well as a beach presence. Offers equipment in good condition and premises for a surfing introduction in calm water at the swimming-pool of the Hard Rock Hotel. An introductory lesson costs US$45, lasts 2.5 hours and students are offered hotel transfers and fresh water. A 3-day course costs US$120, and 5-day courses include a "surfari" to other surfing spots for US$200. 
Some of the surf dudes in the shops also offer private lessons. They are considerably cheaper than the surf schools but just as good. Many of the dudes have been working for the schools or do it on the side. You can't find them on the web so you should look around. One good one is the "Sion Surf Shop" on Poppies I, around 400 m (1,300 ft) from the beach.
There are several surf shops on Poppies II which all seem to be much of a muchness. Friendly local surfer dudes will happily chat wth you about the waves, offer to fix a ding, rent you a board and sell you just about anything surf-related.
Be careful when you rent on a beach: some boards are in such a poor condition that you are very lucky if you don't break them. And that is what some who operate the rental business are looking for. If you break it, then they may demand that you pay for it. So choose only the boards that appear to be in good condition, or you may get ripped off.
It is also possible to rent equipment from locals on the beach for between Rp20,000-80,000 per half day, however prices asked are often closer to Rp40,000-100,000 for one hour. If you rent from the same company for a few consecutive days you will almost certainly get a better price. The equipment quality is lower than of the formal outlets. The surfers on the beach can also give you some basic lessons, and look after your stuff while you are in the water. If this is your first experience of surfing it is safer to use a surf school or private lessons before heading out on your own.
If you want to rent for a few days, rather consider rentasurfboard.com. Their price is Rp100,000/day, the boards are usually in good condition.

Smaller boat also available. 
Spa and massage[edit]
There are spas by the dozen, and as Kuta is the most competitive place in Bali, prices are the lowest (as is the quality of experience). Shop around and ask for package discounts. Take a look at the place first and do not allow yourself be talked into something by touts. A well known spa is Villa de Daun on Jalan Legian. Many hotels have their own in-house spas or partner with a local operator. Reborn and Cozy are two excellent spas on the outskirts of Kuta, on Sunset Road just before the roundabout. The price is around Rp120,000 for 2 hours, but have "happy hour" specials.
Beware of the women offering massages on the beach. They are seasoned at ripping off tourists: be sure you have agreed to a price and a duration, or you'll find yourself with a 10-minute massage.

 Carla Spa, Poppies. Very good full body oil massage for not too much money, ask for Alfa. Opposite side of Artawan, same side as "The Steps", a bit further towards JL Legian. Rp50,000/hour.

Other[edit]
Sunset at the temple of Pura Luhur Uluwatu above the cliffs
Enjoy the sunset. In the evenings plenty of people head down to the beach or seaside cafes to watch the wonderful sunset. Be in place by about 17:30, for a sunset between 18:15 and 18:45. The area in front of McDonald's and the Hard Rock Cafe can be a bit hectic with touts selling spearguns, henna tattoos and massages. Going north, the hassle drops exponentially, with the Legian/Padma Beach area being a wonderfully relaxing place to watch sunset.

Learn[edit]
Yoga is very popular and courses are always on offer.
Some hotels offer courses to learn Bahasa Indonesia.
Buy[edit]
There are lots of popular surfwear/sportswear stores including Volcom, Rip Curl, Rusty, Surfer Girl Billabong and Quiksilver. These well known brands can be purchased in Kuta at prices 30-50% lower than you will pay at home. Your best bet is to wander the length of Jalan Legian between bemo corner and Jalan Melsati where you will find an almost unbelievable number of outlets.
Kuta Square is a popular shopping area at the north end of Jl Kartika Plaza. There are a host of small shops on both sides of the street, and a big Matahari department store, with a cheap and utterly wacky collection of T-shirts on the 3rd floor.
If you buy things from hawkers on the beach, you will attract dozens more and they will do their best to make you feel guilty for not buying from them. Be prepared for offers at "good luck prices" or "morning/sunset prices". The trick is to not look them in the eye and respond to their offers with a firm "no thank you", but to always stay polite.
 Ticket to the Moon, Jl Raya Legian (right by the bomb memorial), ☏ +62 361 763579, office@ticketothemoon.com.

Eat[edit]




Great balls of fire
Bakso (meatball) soup is cheap and tasty any time of the day. Vendors wander the streets with their steaming wooden food carts and are easily located by the 'tink-tink-tink' sound of a spoon hitting a soup bowl. The soup is a small-ish bowl of MSG-laden meaty broth with some thick yellow egg noodle, meatballs and the optional extras of fried wonton, fried tofu, hard-boiled egg and some vegetables. Add some mild chilli sauce and sweet soy for a bit more flavour.


Bakso
You can find any manner of international and local food here. Restaurants are usually either very cheap or in the mid-range. Exclusive restaurants are rare but there are some gems. For luxury dining head 15 minutes up the road to Seminyak.
Halal restaurants can be found along Jalan Raya Kediri. Big chain restaurants such as Pizza Hut, Mc Donald's, and Kentucky Fried Chicken are also halal certified and can be found easily near the beach.

Drink[edit]
Kuta is the low end party centre of Bali popular with Backpackers and young Australians on holiday. It has recovered well from the bomb blasts in 2002 and 2005 and tourists still flock to the bars where alcohol is served freely and excessively. Many of the bars have a house cocktail with a local arak (rice spirit) base. These go by charming names like Jam Jar and Fish Bowl, pack a huge punch and make customers very ill.

Jalan Legian bars[edit]
Jalan Legian between Poppies Gang I & II is the main party area and things tend to get going around midnight and go until 03:00-04:00. The biggest venues are:

The party starts every day from 22:00 but really gets going at midnight. Go here to get 'Blasters'. Rough and ready and it gets very messy. 
-8.7168115.174462 Eikon, Jl Legian 178, ☏ +62 361 750701, info.eikonbali@gmail.com. Daily 11:00-03:00. Lounge bar which frequently has a decent cover band playing R&B. 
-8.71801115.174513 The Engine Room, Jl Legian (opposite the Bounty), ☏ +62 361 75 5121. Small lounge bar and dance club. A little more sophisticated than some of the options on this street.

Big modern building in a metallic half open air architecture, with several atmospheres, each club has its own DJ. Sexy dancers on bar tops, sometimes fire shows in Dome.

Live music every night, great reggae and rock cover bands in the bar right on the street, then DJs. In the back there is another big reggae venue with another good cover band that plays Bob Marley covers non-stop from midnight. 
Poppies Lane II bars[edit]
Closer to the hotels and eateries and having a more laid back sort of atmosphere, Poppies Lane II is where many of the younger crowd go to start their night off before hitting the dancefloors at the clubs on Jalan Legian. Gets busy from 21:00 until midnight. The more popular places are:

 Alleycats, Poppies II (80 m west from legian st, behind twice bar). 09:30-00:00. The busiest pre-club bar. Go here for their "Double Doubles". 
-8.71761115.1748 Bagus Pub, Poppies II (20 m west from Jl Legian). 09:00-00:00. Favourite drinking den of Aussie all-day drinkers. Great place to watch the world go by. 
 The Steps, Poppies II (50 m west from Jl Legian). busy from 22:00-01:00. Not a bar as such, it's some steps in front of a mini market with a boom box for entertainment. A Kuta institution favoured by the surf crowd that's often busier than a lot of the real bars. 
 Twice Bar, Poppies II (80 m west from Jl Legian). 00:00-late. A dark setting perfectly suited to the heavy metal bands that play here several times a week, popular with many of the local Kuta scene. 
 Piggys Bar, Poppies II (80 m west from Jl Legian). 24 hr. A smaller version of Bagus Pub but with live bands and open 24 hours a day. 
Kuta waterfront bars[edit]
Along the waterfront on Jalan Pantai Kuta there are some slightly more sophisticated bar and lounge options. Most are lounges that offer food and entertainment afterwards. Definitely an option to explore and not so overrun by the Australian party groups.

 Kama Sutra, Jl Pantai Kuta. Cavernous bar and club on the beachfront which is very popular with young Indonesians. 
Sports bars[edit]
 All Stars Surf Cafe, Jl Kartika Plaza No 8X. Non-stop surf videos, huge jugs of icy beer, sumo wrestling and limbo dancing.

-8.7242115.171559 Gloria Jean's coffees, Kuta Square. Nice coffee shop with lots of comfy seating upstairs overlooking a scenic temple.

This guide uses the following price ranges for a standard double room:


Budget
Under US$25


Mid-range
US$50-100


Splurge
Over US$100

Kuta has a huge range of accommodation mostly in the budget and mid-range markets, but for the last few years there are many 4-star hotels also. Prices are often negotiable. Nowadays, Kuta is the most competitive area of hotel businesses in Bali. Many 3-star hotels offer discounts. The other hotels of all classes have also lowered their rates. Many hotels have been/being built between Tuban Beach and Kuta Square street. Closer to Kuta Square street means farther to Kuta Beach. Several 3- or 4-star hotels are also located in narrow streets and usually have limited car parking slots. Booking ahead is not necessary even in peak seasons, except if you want to guarantee a stay in one particular hotel, as supply is greater than demand.
All prices stated below are normal prices without discount.

Budget[edit]
There are a lot of cheap guest houses in the Rp100,000-250,000 range on Poppies II, but you can often find nicer places on the small lanes between Poppies I and II. Most guest houses in this area allow adults only. A lot of the budget accommodation in Kuta is very tired. Always see the room first & haggle. It is becoming difficult to find budget accommodation if you arrive late in the day. Budget places (under US$10) may not take reservations, so trying to arrive around 12:00 or 13:00 as people check-out is a good strategy to try and find cheap accommodation.

Stay safe[edit]
The safety advice given here applies more in Kuta than anywhere else in Bali. Take heed, have fun, but be sensible.

Swimming safety is extremely important in Kuta. It is prohibited to swim near the special flags, that are placed where currents are especially strong. Always swim between the red and yellow flags, where the lifeguards have deemed it safest. Do not swim out too far as the waves and currents here are stronger than you might expect and change very rapidly. The sea water in Kuta can be filthy and you should try not to swim in the obviously polluted areas.
 Lifeguard Station (Bala Penyelamat Wisata Tirta), JI Pantai Kuta, ☏ +62 361 755660. 
Watch your belongings at the beach, better yet do not bring your valuables to the beach if you intend to swim or surf.
Touts and scammers will constantly look for their chance. Be wary of deals. If its sounds too good to be true then it probably is. When walking alone (especially down Jl Pantai Kuta and Jl Legian) you will be hassled by touts offering transport on motorbikes. Generally this is harmless and can be used as a means of getting around, although the shear volume of touts offering transport can be an annoyance. Remember to stay calm and don't be pressured into buying anything you don't want.
Drunken Australians are mostly friendly, but occasionally you might find the odd dickhead looking to start a fight.
At night, drunk driving & big potholes in the streets are a problem, so be very aware of road safety after dark, and don't do foolish things with motorbikes.
Drugs should be avoided in Kuta (and all of Indonesia). Punishments for possession are harsh and there have been a number of arrests of tourists over the years. Beware of unsavoury touts offering drugs (often after initially offering transport). These "dealers" are often working with the police in order to get small payouts for arrests. Say "no" and walk away.
Pickpockets have been known to be a problem outside bars, specifically on Jalan Legian (Sky Garden, et al.) One common method used against drunk tourists leaving bars and clubs is for a large group of boys and teenagers to block the sidewalk. As the target attempts to squeeze through, the thieves attempt to reach into their pockets and/or bags and take whatever they can get.
Connect[edit]
Free Wi-Fi for customers has become very widespread in cafes, restaurants, hotels in Kuta - look for the signs.
You can easily buy a prepaid mobile SIM card at a local sundry shop for about Rp25,000, which will come in handy when making hotel reservations or booking tours. They are also available at Circle-K and other convenience chains, but will cost more for the same deal. Get the seller to activate the SIM card for you unless you understand instructions in Bahasa Indonesia fairly well. There should be no need to top up the card, as text messaging and short local calls will cost you next to nothing. If required, top up plans are competitive and sold at the same type of outlets.
There is a post office in a small lane off Poppies I which is also home to several 'wartels' (phone shops) which provide public IDD and fax facilities.

 Telkomsel shop. There is a Telkomsel mobile network outlet on the upper level at the Bali Galeria shopping mall. They can sell you a Simpati SIM card and set it up for you with internet package much cheaper than at airport. You need to show your passport. You might also find a small Telkomsel kiosk in Beachwalk shopping center. 
Cope[edit]
The following nations have honorary consulates in Kuta, though the names of the consulates confusingly include the words "in Denpasar":

  Honorary Consulate of The Republic of Hungary in Denpasar, Bali, c/o Marintur, Jl Raya Kuta 88, ☏ +62 361 757557. 
  Royal Dutch Honorary Consulate in Denpasar, Bali, Jl Raya Kuta 127, ☏ +62 361 751517. 
Go next[edit]
Kuta is a major transport hub and is well connected to the rest of island via a bemo and shuttle bus network. Check the myriad of advertising boards on Poppies I, Poppies II and Jalan Legian for details.
Legian and Seminyak are within walking distance from Kuta.
A car journey to the cultural heart of Bali in Ubud will take about 45 minutes.
