Albany is a port city on the south coast of Western Australia, 400 km (250 mi) south of Perth, the state capital.


Understand[edit]
York street in central Albany in the early evening
Albany is situated on Princess Royal Harbour, a natural inlet of the Southern Ocean, 5 km east west and 3 km north south. It is the oldest continuous European settlement in Western Australia, and was founded in 1826, three years before Perth. Until the construction of Fremantle Port in 1897, Albany was the only deepwater port in Western Australia.
Albany used be a whaling station and was the place from where the conveys carrying troops to the Middle East during World War 1 departed. These two events alone would make the town a worthwhile place to visit but Albany also has a very convoluted coastline giving it many kilometres of charming beaches within half an hours drive of the city centre. When one adds the marvels of the Torndirrup National Park which abuts the city you have one of West Australia's great destinations.  
A leisurely visit to both the old whaling station and the ANZAC centre takes the better part of a day so that three or four days can easily be spent here exploring the sights, beaches and walks.
With a distinctly different climate to most Western Australia, Albany is cool and wet, with a Mediterranean climate. It receives an average of 942 mm of rainfall per annum and its average summer temperature is only 22°C.
Exports from the Albany port are grains, and woodchips. Imports are mainly raw materials for the production of fertilizers.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The direct route on the Albany Highway from Perth is around 4 hours drive, on single carriageway road with 100-110 km/h speed limit.  There are overtaking lanes every 5–10 km or so.  The tourist attractions along this road tend to be off the route, and slightly more scenic routes add significant additional kilometres and time to the trip.

By coach[edit]
TransWA  offers daily services to Albany.  Coaches arrive and depart from the Albany Visitor Centre, which also makes bookings and sells tickets.  These coach services replaced the passenger rail service, which closed many years ago, and no longer runs to Albany.

By plane[edit]
-34.9433117.8091 Albany Airport (10 km (6.2 mi) north of Albany on Albany Hwy), ☏ +61-8-9841-9208. There are daily flights from Perth with Skywest.   
By ship[edit]
Some cruise ships include Albany on their itinerary, however they are very rare.

Get around[edit]
Map of Albany (Western Australia)
By car[edit]
All areas of Albany are accessible by road. To get to Whaleworld and the surrounding national parks and other features, you will need to have a car, or take a bus tour. Local taxi services are also available.

By bus[edit]
A limited inner-city bus service, operated by Love's Bus Service, runs two routes, collectively servicing residential areas of Albany, as well as Middleton Beach, Emu Point and Little Grove. Timetables can be found at the Public Transport Authority's Regional Town Bus Services website.

By foot[edit]
Central Albany, including the historical precinct, shopping area, and port are within walking distance of each other.  The Middleton beach area is a few kilometres away from this area. You can walk from Middleton Beach around the base of Mt Clarence back to the port area on a specially built boardwalk. You will have panoramic views of the harbour and outer islands.  You may also walk to Emu Point from Middleton Beach along a paved pathway.

By bicycle[edit]
There is a practical cycleway network connecting the areas of Albany, and several bicycle hire places in town.  In particular the historical area, shopping precinct, Middleton Beach and Emu Point are all linked by a waterfront off-road cycleway.

 The Princess Royal Fortress and National ANZAC Centre, 67 Forts Road Albany (off Marine Drive), ☏ +61-8-6820-3500. The National ANZAC Centre was constructed on the site in 2014. The centre concentrates on providing a history of the site as an assembly point for the convoys to the Middle East during World War 1 and tries to give a glimpse of the troops' fortunes during the war. The visitor is given a card identifying a particular soldier which can then be used to follow that soldier's journey through the war. This technique is very effective and provides a moving experience. The rest of the site outside the centre also has many interesting exhibits and first class views of the sound and the bay. The site has a small shop and tearooms for visitors, a function centre and a covered area with barbecues and tables. Half a day could easily be spent here. (updated Feb 2018)

The self guided tour of the site includes an inspection of the whaling ship the Cheynes IV, the old flensing and cutting decks and the boilers where blubber was reduced. The audio tour taking you through the process of flensing, cutting and reducing the whale blubber is particularly impressive and gruesome. There are other interesting exhibits and movies and a cafe with good views. The small but well done native botanic garden attached to the site is good for recuperating. A visit could easily take you 3 hours.
