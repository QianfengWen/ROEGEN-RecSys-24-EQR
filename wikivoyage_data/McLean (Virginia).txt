McLean is a Northern Virginia suburb of Washington, D.C. located in Fairfax County, Virginia, in the southern United States of America.


Understand[edit]
The primary reason to visit McLean is to go shopping at Tysons Corner. McLean is primarily residential, with major commercial development concentrated in its portion of Tysons Corner. McLean is also a favored address for many high-ranking government officials and diplomats.
McLean  encompasses the older settlements of Lewinsville and Langley. Langley is the name of the local high school and as a metonym for the CIA, after the location of its headquarters. The community is named after John Roll McLean, who owned The Washington Post, and was one of the chief investors in the Washington and Old Dominion Railway.
