History[edit]
In 1155, Raymond V of Toulouse, Marquis of Provence, sent his chancellor Raous Raymond I, Bishop of Carpentras, to confirm the privileges of market held in Carpentras.  In the Middle Ages, the market was held every Friday in the cemetery of Saint-Siffrein. There were then 200 stallholders. At the beginning of the Avignon Papacy, the bishop Bérenger Forneri tried unsuccessfully to ban the cemetery market. Pope Clement V established his curia in Carpentras in 1313. When he died in 1314, his successor gave preference to Avignon. However, as capital of Vaison in Vaucluse in 1320, the city profitted from Pontifical munificence: ruled by its bishops, it was extended and surrounded by walls which were interrupted only by the Gate of Orange (Porte d'Orange). The market was expanded in 1385 on the site of the Fusterie, which is called Place des Pénitents Noirs.
The city of Carpentras has hosted Jews since at least 1276, according to tax rolls from that time. Expelled from France by Philipple le Bel, the Jews took refuge in the Papal lands where they were safe and enjoyed freedom of worship. Along with Avignon, Cavaillon and L'Isle sur la Sorgue, Carpentras was home to a large Jewish community in a neighborhood that did not become a ghetto until the end of the sixteenth century.
In 1790, the people of Carpentras attempted to establish a small independent state, which would have accepted the reforms of the revolutionary French Constituent Assembly but with the Pope as constitutional monarch. However, this did not last long: by 1791, Carpentras was once again part of France.

Emblem of the city[edit]
The Holy Mors
The Holy Mors or Holy Nail is known as a relic of Christ and is preserved in the Cathedral of Saint-Siffrein. This object dates from the 6th century AD. The "Saint Mors" of Constantine is a forged nail, supposedly of the Passion of Christ. This relic was kept in the treasury of the church of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople until the looting of the city by the troops of the 4th Crusade (1202-1204). It then disappeared until 1226, when it was first seen on the seal of the Bishop of Carpentras Isnard, and subsequently became the emblem of the city in 1260. The relic today on display in the Chapel of the Holy Nail in the Cathedral.
