New Digha Beach
Digha (Bengali: দীঘা Dīgha DIH-ghah) is one of the most popular seaside resorts in West Bengal. People from the cities flock around the beaches of Digha during the vacation. As it is close to cities like Kolkata and Kharagpur, Digha has emerged from a small fishing hamlet to a weekend getaway with numerous budget hotels and lodges.


Understand[edit]


Climate[edit]
There are mainly five seasons in Digha, namely summer, monsoon, autumn, winter and spring. Summer starts in April and continues until June with a maximum temperature of 37 °C (99 °F). Although cold wind from the sea keeps the weather pleasant in this time. Next comes monsoon in July and lasts till the end of September. Digha generally experiences an average rainfall with high humidity in the monsoon season. Autumn sets in October and lasts till mid of December with an average temperature of around 25 °C (77 °F). The weather remains very pleasant this time. Winter sets in the second half of December and lasts till mid February with an average temperature of 15–16 °C (59–61 °F). The spring is the most enjoyable season in Digha starting from mid February to mid April. The hotels remain full of their capacity as tourist inflow is the highest in this peak season.

Talk[edit]
Since Digha is near the border of West Bengal and Odisha, both Bengali and Odia are understood by the locals. Therefore, having a knowledge of any one of the two languages can be useful to communicate with them.

See and do[edit]
Chandaneawar Temple
Digha Science Centre
21.623287.50411 Amarabati Park. 
21.62833387.4577782 Chandaneswar Temple. A famous Shiva temple. Known as the "Second Puri", the temple was built in typical Kalinga Architecture style of Old Odisha temples. A huge annual fair on the Pana Sankranti (Odia New Year) is celebrated on the premises. Many pilgrims visit the temple during this period.  (updated Dec 2022)
21.621787.49673 Digha Science Centre. 
21.6273487.502754 Kajal Dighi. A pond with toy train (miniature railway) rides. (updated Dec 2022)
21.622587.51785 Marine Aquarium and Regional Centre, State Hwy 57, ☏ +91 3220 266 311. 10:00AM–6:00PM (closed Su). This is possibly the most well equipped marine aquarium in India, but the collection of specimens is poor. Some common local fish are kept in this huge aquarium. (updated Mar 2023)
Beaches[edit]
21.6227587.525626 Old Digha Beach. One of the most popular beaches in West Bengal and it gets overcrowded, especially during the cooler winter break. Activities in the beach include horse riding, sunbathing, swimming volleyball, cricket, football etc. However, Old Digha is not safe and conducive for bathing. It is not as wide as it used to be due to heavy soil erosion. Big stones and concrete steps are used to hold together the beach. (updated Mar 2023)
21.6188287.506457 New Digha Beach (2 km (1.2 mi) from Old Digha). The best place for a dip safely. The beach here is flat. Beer is generally served at the beach by the enterprising locals who would accept payment later by coming with you to your hotel. Beware, they may ask a high price for beer. Other activities in the beach include horse riding, sunbathing, volleyball, cricket, football etc. (updated Mar 2023)
21.6293187.544728 Mohana Beach. A less-visited beach at the estuary of the Champa River. There's a fish market in the beach. (updated Mar 2023)
21.634487.56989 Shankarpur Beach (14 km (8.7 mi) from New Digha). The Shankarpur Beach near Hotel Sandy Bay is not crowded, but it is not a great beach with stumps of trees scattered all over the place. At places the beach is muddy. The beach near the Benfish Tourist lodges is better. No one should leave Shankarpur without relaxing on the beach on a full moon night with a glass of vodka topped up with coconut water. The ambience is mesmerizing.   (updated Mar 2023)
21.6043587.4610610 Talasari Beach (4 km (2.5 mi) from New Digha). There is a river by the beach. It gets submerged with high tide. The river gets dried up twice a day. Again it gets filled with water once there is high tide. Once you cross the river using ferry boats you will reach the beach. The beach is quiet and the sea is calm. You can easily take a bath in the sea. You can move around the beach and listen to the breeze. You may also take a boat ride if necessary.   (updated Mar 2023)
21.6098787.481911 Udaypur Beach (3 km (1.9 mi) from New Digha). (updated Mar 2023)
Buy[edit]
Cashew nuts: There is a cashew nut farm in Digha so varieties of cashew nuts are available.
Digha Mohana Fish Market: Buy fresh fish here
Hand woven mats made of hemp. These mats are called Madur in Bengali and the colourful Madurs of Midnapur District are famous.
Jewellery made with Hyderabadi Pearls.
Ornaments and Curios made of sea shells.
Eat[edit]
A tea stall in New Digha
The famous 'Hinger Kochuri' is a famous breakfast of Digha. There are many stalls and sweet shops all over Digha which offers this delicious breakfast.
There are many cheap "rice hotels" all over Digha, serving cheap, but good quality Bengali dishes. There are some more expensive restaurants where continental food is available. In an average restaurant, a vegetarian meal is available for ₹35-45, Bengali fish curry-rice is available for ₹25-35. A meal with egg curry-rice is available around ₹45.
Another great idea would be to just buy the staple vegetarian fare at the hotel you are staying and have it delivered to your room. You can buy fresh fishes like ilish, pomfret, parshe and prawns from Mohona, Digha fish market in the morning and have it cooked at the numerous "Dada-Boudi'r" joints around Sea Hawk. Have this fish with your standard vegetarian lunch or dinner.
In the evening look for fried fish, crabs and prawns on the sea front in Digha.
Those who are fussy about the quality of cooking, have transport at their command and are looking for tasty fish preparations should go and have lunch at Shankarpur, they prepare the fish much better than at the rest of Digha. The quality at Shankarpur is comparable to the splurge dining in Kolkata but is comparatively cheaper and the fish as fresh as you can demand. The trouble of travelling would be well compensated.

 Pabitra Hotel, New Digha (5 min walk from bus stand along main road), ☏ +91 96 471 66166, pabitrahoteldigha@gmail.com. 
Hotel Sandy Bay serves good Bengali cuisine. Try their sea food - prawns, pomfret, bhetki, parse (a small sweet water fish - cooked whole with the bones - so you must use your hands to eat), rohu (a form of carp). Vegetarian food such as mochar ghonto (spicy young green bananas), aloo posto, aloor dum (Bengali style), Kashmiri aloo dum and cholar daal is also available.
Drink[edit]
Alcohol — There are many bars and wine shops in Digha serving all sorts of hard drinks, but the liquor shops close around 7pm. If you want to buy a drink after the shops are closed, some guys in front of the shops will provide alcohol at higher prices (potentially black bargaining). The bar at Hotel Nest is good. But from Sandy Bay you can face the sea directly. A liquor shop has opened just 50 m outside the gates of the Fisheries premises on the right fork from Hotel Nest. A variety of medium grade whiskies, rum and other spirits are available.
Green Coconut water, (commonly known as 'Daab') is very cheap here. A single green coconut costs around ₹10-20 and the water is sweet and refreshing. The green coconut vendors move with their cycles all along the Sea Beach. There are also green coconut vendors which provide seating facilities near the beach.
Sleep[edit]
Sunset at Talasari Beach





Note: To avoid the unsavoury, corrupt, and thoroughly untrustworthy booking services based in Kolkata, it is best to get a place to stay on arrival without advance reservation.

Budget
under ₹1,000


Mid-range

Always avoid the hotel-agents at the Digha station as their hotels are situated very far from the beach. It is better to consult the cycle-rickshawallahs for better lodging facilities (they take commissions from the hotel guys)

Stay safe[edit]
Electric torches or emergency lamps can help in case of temporary power outages, which are frequent during the summer. However, most of the hotels in Digha have their own backup generators, so if you don't bring a torch, you'll probably be fine.
Mosquito repellent — this is a must for visitors. Most shops in Digha sell repellent.
Safety at Sea. The sea becomes rough to very rough during high tide, especially during the new and full moon. It is unsafe to swim during high tide. There is a sea wall which protects Old Digha from erosion, and it is also unsafe to cross the wall during high tide. Most of Digha has No Swim warnings which you should mind. Always obey the commands of the khaki Coast Guards if you want to swim safely.
