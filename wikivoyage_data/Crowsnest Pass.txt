Crowsnest Pass
Crowsnest Pass is in Southern Alberta, Canada. Gateway to the southern Alberta and some of the last untouched beauty of the Canadian Rockies.  It is on the Crowsnest Highway (Highway 3).
The municipality of 5,500 people (2016) resulted from a legal amalgamation of five towns (from east to west): 49.5808-114.3661 Bellevue , 49.5686-114.3772 Hillcrest , 49.601111-114.4061113 Frank , 49.608056-114.4388894 Blairmore , and 49.6353-114.5035 Coleman , in 1979. Blairmore and Coleman are the largest towns; Frank is the smallest. Within its boundaries are also the former communities (abandoned, or much reduced) of 49.6515-114.3971 Lille , 49.555556-114.3455562 Passburg, 49.63176-114.6035433 Sentinel (Sentry), and 49.629992-114.6897814 Crowsnest.


Understand[edit]
Map of Crowsnest Pass
The Crowsnest Pass area on both sides of the provincial boundary is rich in coal deposits, which were quickly developed after completion of the rail line. All the mines on the Alberta side were closed by the end of the 20th century as cheaper and safer open-pit mines opened on the British Columbia side of the pass. Some logging and oil and gas exploitation also occur in the area and a sulphur plant has been in operation there for several years.
Tourism based on the natural and historical resources of the area remains underdeveloped but is slowly growing.

History[edit]
Before the arrival of Europeans, Aboriginal people used this major breach through the Front Ranges for seasonal migrations, and also for trade between mountain and plains cultures.

The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) built the Crowsnest Route line from Lethbridge, Alberta, to Kootenay Landing, British Columbia, through the Crowsnest Pass between 1897 and 1898. This line was built primarily to access mineral-rich southeastern BC via an all-Canadian rail route, and to assert Canadian (and CPR) sovereignty in an area into which U.S. railroads were beginning to build. It also opened up coal deposits in the Crowsnest and Elk River valleys which were important to mineral smelting operations and assisted the CPR in its conversion of locomotives from wood to coal. The CPR sought and received construction funding from the federal government, partially in exchange for a freight subsidy on prairie farm exports and equipment imports which came to be called the "Crow's Nest Pass Agreement".
The first motor vehicle to cross the Canadian Rockies did so via Phillipps Pass, about 1 km north of Crowsnest Pass, and in 1917 a road was blasted around the shores of Crowsnest Lake and across Crowsnest Pass, renamed Interprovincial Highway Three in 1932. It is also known as the Crowsnest Highway.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The easiest way to get there is by car, from either the east or west on Highway 3 or from the north on the undeveloped Highway 940 (this route is quite hard on the suspension and is only advised in a 4x4 or SUV).
The Crowsnest Pass is 269 km (about 2½ hours by car) southwest of Calgary, 70 km east of Fernie or 140 km west of Lethbridge. If travelling from Calgary it is well worth taking the picturesque Highway 22 via Black Diamond and  Longview, which follows part of the Cowboy Trail.

By bus[edit]
There is scheduled bus service along the Highway 3 corridor.  This bus service does not stop in Crowsnest Pass, though it does stop in Sparwood (about 40 km from Blairmore) and Pincher Creek (about 46 km from Blairmore).
CNP Shuttle (+1 403-564-4911) offers a private hire mini-bus service between Calgary/Lethbridge and the Crowsnest Pass.
During ski session it is possible to get a chartered ski bus from Calgary airport and arranged to be dropped off en route, you will probably have to travel to Fernie to catch the return journey.

The small coal-mining town of Frank in the Crowsnest Pass region had 82 million metric tons of rock come crashing down on it in 1903.

This was Canada's deadliest rockslide ever, killing 90, but fortunately it missed much of the town. (updated Apr 2018)

The main attraction of the Crowsnest Pass is its pristine wildness, which is highly accessible from any of the towns.

Activities[edit]
There are a lot of trails and backcountry roads, which are well signed and popular with walkers, cyclists and ATV/quad riders. During the winter cross country skiing, snow-shoeing and snow-mobiling take over as the wildness 'escapes'.
