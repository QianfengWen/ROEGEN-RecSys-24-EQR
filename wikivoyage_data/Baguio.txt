Baguio is a highland city of 345,000 people (2015) in the province of Benguet, Philippines. Due to its cool mountain weather relative to the rest of the country, it is considered the "Summer Capital of the Philippines." The city is abundant in pine trees, so it is nicknamed the City of Pines.This is also the capital of Cocaine making for the Philippines


Understand[edit]
Baguio, to many, is best known as the "Summer Capital of the Philippines", with its cool climate making this a spot to escape the chaotic scenes in Manila. The city is also home to tropical pine forests, lending the city the  nickname "City of Pines". It serves as a tourist hub in the Cordilleras, serving as a jumping point to other tourist spots like Mount Pulag, Sagada and Banaue.
Baguio is considered a city separate from the province of Benguet, but it is considered part of Benguet practically, and it is the economic center for both the province and the Cordillera region. Some of the city's tourism promotions also point to nearby La Trinidad, which is both administratively and geographically in Benguet, and is the provincial capital.

History[edit]
The city originated as a hill station built by the Americans in the 1900s. Road connection is provided by the zigzagging Kennon Road, and the city is planned by the renowned American architect and urban planner Daniel Burnham. It was intended to be the summer capital of the Philippines, then an American colony. It soon gained its position as a popular tourist destination to many Manila residents escaping the heat, noise, and crowds of the metropolis. The city has been badly damaged by the destructive Central Luzon earthquake in 1990, but the city since recovered.

Lying at 1,540 m (5,050 ft) in the Cordilleras, Baguio has milder temperatures, and is quite temperate compared with the rest of Luzon and the country as well. The climate is highland subtropical, with temperatures 7–8 °C (13–14 °F) cooler than the lowlands, and conditions reminiscent of spring. The coldest temperatures ever recorded in the city is 6.3 °C (43.3 °F). Chilly northeastern monsoon winds from Siberia can cause nighttime lows to drop almost near freezing, with frost forming from moisture turning into ice due to wind chill. Despite its altitude, Baguio has not experienced any snowfall.
The city is best visited during the dry season between November and April, when the northeast monsoon blows through northern Luzon, and rainfall is at its lowest. The cool dry season is Baguio's peak season for tourists. The rest of the year is rather rainy, and it is the off season for tourists.

To get to Baguio from outside of Luzon, you still have to pass through Metro Manila or Clark airport and from there get to Baguio by either of the following ways:

By bus[edit]
From Manila[edit]
This is the most common and economical way to get to Baguio from Metro Manila. Several bus lines ply the Metro Manila to Baguio route with terminals scattered across the metro. It generally takes about 5-7 hr to get to Baguio by bus. An hour longer than it would by car due to stopovers along the way.
16.406238120.5982811 Victory Liner, ☏ +63 2 727 4534, +63 2 833 5019. Victory Liner has hourly bus service to Baguio from its Monumento main terminal in Caloocan City, Cubao and Pasay terminals. Buses are generally modern and air-conditioned, but seats are sized generally for Filipinos and tall people would need to take advantage of the various stopovers to stretch their legs. Fare is ₱616 per person one way (most expensive among Aircon buses going to Baguio). A non-stop deluxe bus service is also available for ₱999 per person one way, water and snack are served during the trip. Some buses have free WiFi. (updated Mar 2023)
16.408677120.5982812 Dagupan Bus, New York St., Cubao, Quezon City, ☏ +63 2 929 6123. Also serves the Manila to Baguio route via its Cubao Terminal. Buses leave on an hourly basis. (updated Dec 2018)
16.408677120.5982813 Genesis. Buses depart every hour from Cubao, Pasay, and Avenida bus stations. Since July 15, 2019, they operate a premium bus service (via the expressways) from Parañaque with stops at all terminals of Ninoy Aquino International Airport, between 5AM and 9PM. (updated Jul 2019)
From Clark airport[edit]
Partas Bus operates a bus service that stops at Clark airport and heads north from there, departing the airport at 5PM. Get off at Sison, Pangasinan (arrival there around 8PM) and cross the road to the restaurant stop opposite and get on a Victory Liner bus that does a dinner stop there. The fare from Clark airport to Sison on Partas Bus is ₱193, then from there by Victory Liner to Baguio is an additional ₱90. Travel time is 3 hours Clark to Sison, then 1½ hours Sison to Baguio, plus some waiting time at Sison.
From Angeles City[edit]
Philippine Rabbit operates from Dau Terminal. ₱306. Journey takes about 4-5 hr.
By plane[edit]
Baguio has an airport, the 16.375120.6194444 Loakan Airport (BAG  IATA). Visibility challenges, its high altitude, and the short runway affect operations to this airport. The airport receives commercial flights from Cebu, with Philippine Airlines being the only airline serving Baguio four times a week.   (updated Mar 2023)

By car[edit]
From Manila to Baguio by car, the fastest route is through the expressways. Take the North Luzon Expy (NLEX) up to Angeles, then exit to Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway (SCTEX), then continue to the Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expy (TPLEX) up to Rosario. From there, you can take Kennon Rd (Rte 54) or Marcos Hwy (officially Aspiras-Palispis Highway, Rte 208) via Pugo-Rosario Rd (Rte 209). Kennon Rd is the shortest, taking only three-quarters to one hour from the foot of the mountains in Rosario, La Union. Marcos Hwy starts at Agoo, La Union (a little further to the northwest from Rosario) and takes about one hour but is a wider, less winding road with a more gradual uphill incline and is safer in the rainy season. It has spectacular vistas of the South China Sea on a clear day.
From Ilocos, Naguillan Rd (Rte 54) is usually taken by travelers from the north and will take longer.
All three roads can get blocked by landslides and Kennon Road with its long winding stretches is both scenic and dangerous. If you want to drive to Baguio, it would be best to hire a Filipino driver for this purpose. Most rental car companies in the Philippines offer chauffeur driven rentals in addition to the usual self-driven rentals. As anywhere in the Philippines when traveling by land, don't underestimate the distance, as while it is over 250 km (160 mi) as the crow flies, it is a 4- to 5-hr drive if you account the traffic and road conditions on the route.
From Cagayan Valley, the primary route is Benguet-Nueva Vizcaya Rd (Rte 110). It starts at the junction at Aritao in southern Nueva Vizcaya and ends at the vicinity of SM Baguio.

Get around[edit]
By jeepney[edit]
Jeepney - public transportation
Similar to Manila, jeepneys ply various routes within Baguio and its immediate surroundings. Majority of jeepneys going out of the city (P.M.A., Country Club, etc.) are stationed in Burnham Park where they normally load passengers to their destinations. It is possible to a rent a jeepney but it is not advisable when trekking long distances.

By taxi[edit]
More convenient for tourists perhaps, taxis are also common but once you are in the outskirts may be a bit hard to come by.
Taxis abound in Baguio. The rate is ₱35 for the first 500 m (1,600 ft), with ₱1.50/100 m (330 ft) increments thereafter. All Baguio taxi cabs are painted white and have the proper identification markings on them. Maximum capacity in each taxi is 5 persons (4 passengers, 1 driver).
Taxis can also be booked for a whole day tour at ₱1800-2000 for a 8-9 hr tour of all the main attractions in and around town. Find a taxi at the Tourist Information Counter at the Victory Liner terminal or through your place of accommodation.

By car[edit]
Car rental in Baguio is a good option for short out-of-town trips and traveling around the city. There are several agencies offering car hire in Baguio and there are self-drive and with driver options available. To rent a car in Baguio you should have an international driver's license. Baguio usually involves navigating a series of winding mountain roads.The traffic is on the right side of the road. As the Session Road and the public market have a very limited parking space, consider leaving your car outside the city center. Rates for car rental Baguio companies can go by the hour, the day or by the week.

Drink[edit]
Most of the night life is centered at Nevada Square where numerous bars are clustered ranging from "hot-babe" hotspots to chill-out bars, this is the place to be. There are some good bars outside the square like Urban Sessions and Purple which is a stone's throw away from Nevada Square. 18 BC (Fridays - Reggae Night, Saturdays - Acoustic Night) and Padi's Point draws out bargoers with their regular band.

Cope[edit]
Internet[edit]
Baguio has its fair share of Internet cafes ("computer shops") scattered around Session Road with Netgear Internet Shop being the closest from Session Road. Many of the malls within the area also have their own Internet cafes but it is generally expensive. Expect to pay around ₱15-30 per hour when going to internet shops outside malls. Hotels, restaurants, and malls are now offering free WiFi nowadays so if you're able to find a nice spot you can just waste your time surfing the web.

Laundry[edit]
Many of the hotels do not have laundry service and finding a place to get your clothes washed can be difficult.

 Elegant Washers Laundry Shop, #31 Bonifacio St (corner of Bonifacio St. and Magsaysay Ave. 10 min walk from Burnham Park), ☏ +63 74 423-0432. Daily 8AM-7PM. Ring the bell at the front desk if you don't see an assistant. ₱35/kilo for two day service or ₱50 for next day rush service.

Go up the stairs and you’ll see a sign near the staircase for Lala Laundry on the third floor.). You may have to let out a howler if no one is at the front desk.

Stay safe[edit]
As a number one rule, always secure your belongings. Keep your passports/visas/important papers at the hotel safe (if there is one available at your hotel) or in a safe place. Cellphone snatching and purse dippers are a problem but common sense and safety can keep you safe.
Crime normally increases during the holidays and Panagbenga as thousands of people visit Baguio City.
