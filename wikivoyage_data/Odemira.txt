Zambujeira do Mar

Odemira (/ɔ.dɨ.ˈmi.ɾɐ/, aw-d(ih)-MEE-ruh) has just over 20,000 residents (2011). With an area of 1,720.60 km2 (664.33 sq mi), it's Portugal's largest municipality.
In 2011, Zambujeira was home to about 900 people. The coast of Zambujeira is included within the Nature Park of the Southwest Alentejo and St. Vincent Coast (Parque Natural do Sudoeste Alentejano e Costa Vicentina), covering the various folding clifftops and small beaches/coves of the coast. In addition to the central coastal beach of Zambujeira, the beaches of Alteirinhos, Nossa Senhora, Arquinha and Tonel are geologically significant, as well as attracting summer tourists and vacationers.
The principal activity in the village is tourism, although agriculture, cattle breeding and fishing are common activities for the industrial sectors of the economy. There are four ports along the coast that shelter the fishery ships in the area called Entradas da Barca. By the last half of the 20th century, rural tourism began to punctuate some of the areas of the parish, concentrated on providing quality leisure services associated with rural/farm activities.

Beaches[edit]
37.516667-8.7833331 Zambujeira do Mar. One of the best known and most frequented beaches in the region and one of its main business cards. Protected by high cliffs, it is at the mouth of a watercourse, next to the town. At the south end where a chapel was erected, dangerous currents are formed that can drag the most unsuspecting. Very popular for bodyboarding.   
37.518333-8.7880562 Alteirinhos Beach. This sandy beach protected by a high cliff. During low tide you can appreciate all its originality: the small coves widen, forming a huge beach sprinkled with rocks, pools and ponds, full of limpets, mussels and shrimp. The rock that stretches across the sea (Lajão) is one of the region's favourite fishing grounds. Access: follow the dirt road south of Zambujeira do Mar beach. At the top of the cliff, next to the pines, turn towards the coast. Then go down the existing wooden steps.  
37.53008-8.786433 Nossa Senhora Beach. At the northern exit of Zambujeira, on the dunes in front of the last houses, a staircase on the cliff leads to this short, sandy beach. 
37.55869-8.791564 Tonel Beach. Inlet set in a high cliff, the descent to the beach is made by a steep trail. The rocky wall and the walk to the beach are impressive - the beach is at the foot, crushed by the stone blocks. From the top of the cliff, next to the cable of the Penduradoiro, there is one of the most beautiful landscapes in the region. Access: follow the dirt road that begins on the municipal road between Cabo Sardão and Zambujeira do Mar, next to the Herdade do Touril hill. 
37.442222-8.7977785 Praia de Odeceixe Mar. A scenic beach which combines with a river (used like kind of a natural water slide). The river also creates nice tiny pools/lagoons in the sand, perfect for little children.
