Pitangueiras Beach, Guarujá.
Guarujá is a city in São Paulo state, Brazil, and it is part of the Baixada Santista, the metropolitan area centered in Santos. One of the busiest holidays destinations of the state, only 87 kilometres from the city of São Paulo, Guarujá is a city that is devoted to tourism and has dozens of beaches that stretch along its avenues and urban zones, or are to be found in less accessible locations.


Understand[edit]
The municipality of Guarujá corresponds to Ilha de Santo Amaro, a large island that remained almost unexplored during the colonial and imperial times. In the end of the XIX century, an ambitious enterprise turned Guarujá into a beach resort town for wealthy Paulistas, and it became a full municipality in 1947. The beauty of the island gave its nickname "The Pearl of the Atlantic".
In the 1970s/1980s, tourism in Guarujá grew enormously, following the growth of São Paulo and the opening of new roads between the two cities. Although a bit further from São Paulo than Santos, São Vicente and Praia Grande, the growing beach pollution problems of these cities have turned Guarujá into the main holiday destination of Paulistanos.
In the central area, the blue waters of the beaches of Pitangueiras and Astúrias have great appeal to the tourists. Amongst the most popular spots are the beaches of Enseada and Casado. On the open sea and not good for bathing, the Tombo beach is excellent for surfers, in contrast with tranquility of Guaiúba, Prainha Branca and Iporanga where the fertile vegetation is enhanced by a waterfall and a freshwater swimming pool. Guarujá also has relics from history such as the Barra Grande Fortress built in the 16th century, the Forte Velho just 8 km from the centre and the Armação das Baleias, the first industrial plant set up in the state for the extraction of whale oil.

Get in[edit]
By air[edit]
Arriving the airports in São Paulo (Congonhas / CGH IATA) or (Guarulhos / GRU IATA), packtours can arrange convenient TAXI service to Guaruja, it may take slightly more than one hour to go.

By bus[edit]
Take a taxi or the subway to Jabaquara Bus Station. There you can take a bus directly to Guarujá. Estimated travel time: 1 hour and 20 minutes. More information: 11 50113421. [1] [2]

By car[edit]
From São Paulo, first it catches the Anchieta Highway (SP-160) until the city of Cubatão. There it has a bifurcation that it allows to follow for the Cônego Domenico Rangoni Highway (old Piaçagüera Highway) until Guarujá. Alternatively, it is possible to catch this bifurcation from the Highway of the Immigrants (SP-150), but it takes a little longer.

Get around[edit]
Map of Guarujá
By taxi[edit]
A good way to move around to not-so-close places. They are not very expensive and drivers are mostly friendly, although small cheats are not uncommon. To avoid it, after getting into a taxi, check if the taximeter has been started . If not, ask the taxi driver to do so. 

By bus[edit]
Buses are a cheap and nice way to get around by day although by night they are more scarce. The fare is paid on cash to a controller or the driver only inside the bus, by passing through a roulette. There are no tickets. Keep an eye out for pickpockets when the bus is crowded. Many people get still wet from the sea into the bus, so have a good look if your seat is dry before you sit. Check bus routes to the beaches on the beach section below. Bus n.81 goes to all the beaches.

By bicycle[edit]
Guarujá has an extensive network of cycleways, and among locals, bicycles are one of the most popular ways of getting around in the city. The Enseada beach has a cycleway along most of its extension. For a tourist, there are unfortunately not many places to rent a bicycle, but it is worth considering to buy one if you are going to have an extended stay in the city. Some hotels offer bicycles for borrowing or renting.

Beaches[edit]
Enseada Beach, Guarujá.
 Enseada. This huge beach is the most popular and common destination for the occasional tourist. Kiosks selling coconuts, beer and great finger food can be found all over. Although crowded in the summer, it's not as crowded as Pitangueiras. It also has a rich nightlife that can make traffic chaotic during the high season. Bus number: 11,17,19,23,55,77 and 81 
 Pitangueiras. One of the most popular beaches in Guarujá. Overcrowded in summer mornings, Pitangueiras can be better appreciated with a barefoot walk on its sands in a warm afternoon.

Do[edit]
Surf! Guarujá hasn't the best waves around, but they are good enough for a great surf session. Each beach offers its own style of wave, so whether you are a newbie or an expert, you will sure find what you are looking for. At Pitangueiras beach you can find a School of Surf (to the southwest, close to the rocks) where you can take some classes or just rent a board. More informations: 013 33821827 or 013 97882558.
Buy[edit]
Pitangueiras is the commercial center of the city, and also hosts a shopping mall by the beach near Av. Puglisi. Every weekend and during  holidays, local artisans gather in a square near the shopping mall to sell handcrafts. Some bargaining is allowed, so practice your Portuguese numbers before you go.

Eat[edit]
Not only seafood but many other cuisines can be found in Guarujá. Barbecue restaurants are a nice option after a whole day of walking on the sands (but never before swimming). Italian cuisine is popular in the São Paulo State and is well represented in Guarujá. Japanese and Arabian cuisine will add to the vastness of culinary options.
Besides restaurants, vendors are everywhere selling coconut, sweetcorn, sandwiches, ice cream, etc. Kiosks are also easily found on the main beaches where you can try the excellent fresh and clean fried fish, crabs and shrimps.

Stay safe[edit]
Guarujá does not have a good reputation for safety. Pedestrian robberies (especially in the sidewalks of Pitangueiras and Enseada beaches) and car robberies are relatively common. Try to avoid walking in the beach sidewalks if there seems to be few people on them, especially (but not only) during the night. Don't bring more than you need to enjoy your day.

Stay healthy[edit]
The water quality of the beaches in Guarujá tend to vary alongside the year. In the beach, before rushing to the water, check the CETESB flag. A red flag indicates that the beach is not safe for swimming. Before you go, you can also check the map of the latest weekly beach quality bulletin (in Portuguese, boletim de qualidade das praias) of the state's Environment Department (CETESB).
