Calgary is a tiny village on the island of Mull in the Scottish Inner Hebrides. The name in Gaelic is Cala ghearraidh, meaning "beach of the meadow" or landing place; until the early 20th century Clyde puffers were beached by the pier to unload supplies. Colonel James Macleod, who'd been born on Skye but emigrated to Ontario, took a summer holiday here; he became Commissioner of the North-West Mounted Police in 1876 just as a new fort was being established in Alberta, and had it named "Fort Calgary", the start of the modern Canadian city of 1.3 million. 
There's very little accommodation or other amenities at Calgary. There's more at Dervaig five miles east, and straggling along the B8073; those facilities are described here.

Calgary is 12 miles west of  Tobermory along the narrow, winding B8073. West Coast Motors Bus 494 runs from Tobermory via Dervaig to Calgary, 40 min; three M-F and one on Saturday. Tobermory has buses to the main ferry port of Craignure.
Ulva Ferry minibus runs twice F-Su from Calgary down the west coast to Ulva Ferry village, Gruline and Salen, where it connects with the 95 / 495 bus to Craignure. A ferry runs on demand to the island of Ulva.

Get around[edit]
You need wheels, at least a bike, it's five miles between Calgary and Dervaig and the bus is infrequent.

See[edit]
Calgary House near the beach became a private residence in 2018 so you can't visit. It's a castellated Gothic mansion, built 1823, where Colonel James Macleod was a guest. He gave its name to the fort and later city of Calgary in Alberta, Canada.

Kilmore Church in Dervaig, completed in 1905, has a notable stained-glass window of Jesus with a pregnant Mary Magdalene. The white tower is sort-of in the style of a Irish Round Tower, with a bit of lighthouse, minaret and moonshot mixed in.
56.59-6.1723 Kilmore Standing Stones or Cnoc Fada are the largest of several nearby groups, aligned as if for sunrise or moonrise. They're a row of five, with only two still upright.

Maol Mor group are half a mile beyond those, though the path is indistinct.
Dervaig cemetery has another group of four.
The Quinish are a line of four, with only the "Caliach" — the old woman — still upright. Follow the little lane north from Dervaig to Quinish Estate. There's parking spaces here and the stones are a mile away.
Glengorm stones are some miles north, better accessed by the lane from Tobermory to Glengorm Castle.
