Castello di Venere and the Pepoli tower
Erice is a village in the province of Trapani on Sicily in Italy.


Understand[edit]
The entire municipality of Erice has 28,000 inhabitants. Most of them live in the Casa Santa district which is directly adjacent to Trapani. Only fewer than 500 people live in the old medieval fortification which is uniquely located on top of the 715 m high Erice mountain.  The city has wonderful views. On a clear day, the Mount Etna volcano, on the other side of the island,  can be seen. Because of its height, it can be cold in winter. On some days, the mountain is hidden in clouds of fog. Even on summer evenings, it’s advisable to have a sweater within reach.
Erice is a member of I Borghi più belli d'Italia, an association of small Italian towns.

History[edit]
The ancient name of Erice was Eryx (Eρυξ in Greek). With Drepanon, Segesta and Talla, it belonged to the largest cities of the Elymian people. For the Carthaginians Erice was of great strategic importance. After the Romans had defeated the Carthaginians, the significance of the city decreased, and it fell into disrepair. The Arabs, who had gained a foothold on Sicily in the 9th century, called the virtually uninhabited mountain Jabal Hamid. After the conquest of the Normans, the city was rebuilt, under the name Monte San Giuliano. The city walls and bastions were restored. During the Sicilian Vespers (the revolt of the Sicilians against Charles of Anjou), the city choose the side of the lords of Aragon and was rewarded with the construction of the cathedral. In later years, many buildings were realized within the walled city. During the Fascist period, the city regained its original name Erice.
