Des Plaines is in Chicagoland. It is an inner-ring, northwest suburb of Chicago with two distinct portions: a suburban northern portion reminiscient of other, nearby northwest suburbs (including Niles, Park Ridge, and Mount Prospect), as well as a built-up southern portion with the businesses, hotels, and other amenities of the O'Hare Airport corridor (much like Rosemont, Chicago's O'Hare neighborhood, and Elk Grove Village).

During the spring of 1984, the school was used in the filming of the 1985 movie The Breakfast Club. In 1986, the interior of the building was used in the filming of Ferris Bueller's Day Off (while the exterior shots took place at Glenbrook North High School). The building is now a district headquarters for the Illinois State Police, Cook County 911 Dispatch Center, Illinois Lottery and offices for other state agencies. The only reminder of the filming is a plaque inside the building, downstairs. Maine North is located in unincorporated Maine North township.   (updated Dec 2018)
