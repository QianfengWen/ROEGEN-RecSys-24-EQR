The main industries in Cochrane are transportation, railway, tourism, and forestry. There is also marginal farming around Cochrane. Although the soil is considered to be of good quality, the growing season is too short to have substantial crop production.

History[edit]
Before Cochrane was founded, it was used as a summer camping ground by indigenous people, and a stopping place for fur traders travelling to Moose Factory.
In the early 20th century, the National Transcontinental Railway was built through the area, and in 1907, the place was selected as the junction point with the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway. In November 1908, the lots were sold by auction and a railway town formed. It was named for politician and merchant Frank Cochrane, a former mayor of Sudbury and a federal Cabinet minister from 1911 to 1919.
The settlement was devastated by fire in 1910, 1911, and 1916, but rebuilt each time and became a transportation hub for northern Ontario.

Climate[edit]
