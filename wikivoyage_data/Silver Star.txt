Understand[edit]
One of the larger ski resorts in British Columbia, the mountain has 3,065 skiable acres and a vertical of 760 m and enjoys the dry, "champagne powder" snow of the Okanagan.
SilverStar's snow season runs from late November to mid-April weather permitting. SilverStar provides summer lift access for mountain biking and hiking from the end of June through to September. Check weather conditions here.
The resort spans over four mountain faces, giving it four distinct areas:

50.3711-119.04941 Vance Creek offers most of the beginner and intermediate runs on the mountain. Therefore it is usually the busiest face of the mountain and has mostly groomed runs along with intermediate and expert runs. Vance Creek is serviced by the "Comet Six-pack Express" which ferries skiers from below the Village base and Silver Woods areas to the summit at 1,915 m. The "Summit Chair" is a Mueller double chair that takes skiers directly from the Village to the summit as well.
50.3646-119.07382 Attridge is a small area beside Vance Creek which offers a wide variety of glade and groomed runs. The "Alpine Meadows" chair is a fixed grip quad and offers ski-in/ski-out access to the mountain from the developed area called Alpine Meadows.
50.3546-119.04183 Silver Woods is a part of a catchment below the Comet Express and is serviced by the "Silver Woods Express" which is a detachable high-speed quad. Silver Woods offers many intermediate treed and glade runs and is an access point to the hill from the "Knoll Residential Area". The Silver Woods, along with The Attridge and Vance Creek, make up the area known as 'The Frontside'.
50.3938-119.02424 Putnam Creek, often referred to as the Backside, introduces skiers to much more difficult terrain than the rest of the mountain and offers to the more experienced skier. Most of the runs in the Putnam Creek area are black diamond and double black diamond runs consisting of steep lines with moguls and tree skiing. The "Powder Gulch Express", a detachable high-speed quad gives lift access to the many runs and a way out with the "Home Run T-bar" back to the village.
