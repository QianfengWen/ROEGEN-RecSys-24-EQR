Carrick-on-Shannon is the county town of County Leitrim in northwest Ireland, and grew up at a place where the Shannon could be forded. (A soggy experience, as the town's Irish name of Cora Droma Rúisc means "weir of the marshy ridge"). Later the river was bridged, so Carrick and the south bank village of Cortober in County Roscommon became a single settlement. In the early 19th century Carrick was an important river port when the Shannon navigation was improved, and the Royal Canal connected all the way to Dublin. Water traffic faded with the coming of the railways, but in the 20th / 21st century was revived by pleasure craft. In 2016 Carrick had a population of 4062.


Get in[edit]
Shannon Bridge
Although the town is often simply referred to as Carrick, always give it the full "on Shannon" when organising transport, as several other places are named for An Charraig, a crag or rock.

See[edit]
53.94539-8.095361 Costello's Memorial Chapel, Main St. This was built in 1879 by Edward Costello for his late wife, and he himself was buried there in 1891. It's not been used as a chapel since but was restored in 2010. Measuring only 16 ft by 12 ft (4.88 x 3.66 m), it's one of the world's smallest churches.   (updated Mar 2021)
Churches of normal size are St Mary's (RC) and St George's (C of I), side-by-side on Main St and both 19th century.
Castle: if there's an award for Ireland's most ruined castle then here's a contender, a little knuckle of masonry by the bridge.
Hatley Manor is an elegant mansion of 1830 on St George's Terrace. It's privately owned, no tours.
53.95-8.0862 The Workhouse is now St Patrick's Community Hospital. A plaque marks the Famine graveyard next to it. An inspector of 1846 rated this workhouse the worst he had ever seen.
53.929-8.0043 Drumsna, home to Anthony Trollope in the 1840s, has a scenic stone river bridge. This was the upper limit of navigation of the Shannon until a 2.6 km canal was cut to bypass the shallows, enabling shipping to reach Carrick and beyond. The old locks and lock-keeper's cottage still stand.
53.928-8.0294 Jamestown, the upstream end of the canal, has another stone bridge and the gnarly stump of an abbey on the Leitrim riverbank.
53.991-8.0645 Leitrim is a village 5 km upriver from Carrick, with O'Rourke's Castle the scrappy remains of a 15th century tower house. It's the upper limit of natural navigation of the River Shannon, which above here is shallow in its descent from Lough Allen. That meant it could be forded: in 1270 the Normans marched here but were routed by the Irish of Connacht, and the place previously called "the ford with the tree-stump" became known as Battlebridge. The Lough Allen Canal ascends from Battlebridge (1 km northwest of Leitrim) to Acres Lough, Drumshanbo and into the extensive Lough Allen; there's no onward navigation from there. And Leitrim village itself is the south terminus of the 63 km Shannon-Erne waterway, re-opened to navigation in 2009.
Arigna Mining Experience: see Drumshanbo for this coal mine museum.
Do[edit]

The Dock on St George's Terrace is an art gallery and performance space, in the 1822 former courthouse. Prisoners were led down from the court dock through a tunnel to the cells of the gaol opposite - this was demolished in 1968 and became, fittingly, a dock, the kind used by boats. The courthouse also held Council offices but these are now in a modern building next door.
