Pender Harbour and Egmont is a mostly rural area northwest of Sechelt on the Sunshine Coast in British Columbia. It includes the communities of Madeira Park and Garden Bay on Pender Harbour and the villages of Earls Cove and Egmont.


Understand[edit]
Before the first Europeans discovered the area, a vibrant population of First Nations equalled or doubled its current number of inhabitants. Sex'wamin, the Shishalh winter settlement centred on Garden Bay, was likely one of the largest on the British Columbia coast. It is estimated that over 5,000 First Nations people lived in longhouses on the shore near where the Garden Bay Hotel now sits. The Shishalh vacated Pender Harbour and relocated to summer villages up the inlets of Jervis, Salmon, and Narrow. Theirs was the opposite of current migration patterns, which see Pender Harbour's population swell in the summer and thin during the winter months.

Get in[edit]
The Sunshine Coast Highway (Hwy 101) is the main road in and out of the area. It is approximately a 75- to 90-minute drive north from the Langdale ferry terminal, which connects with Horseshoe Bay and Vancouver.
