The City of Lappeenranta (population 73,000 in 2023) is the economic and cultural centre of Finnish South Karelia. 


Understand[edit]
The city is near the border of Russia and at the southern shore of the Saimaa, the largest lake (system) of Finland. Its culture and dialects are strongly part of eastern Finland, although Wikivoyage treats it as part of Southern Finland. Also known as Villmanstrand (its Swedish name and previous English name), Lappeenranta has a colourful, 360-year history influenced by its location in the border dividing western and eastern cultures.

Get in[edit]





Visa restrictions:
In response to Russia's war in Ukraine, Russian tourists are banned from entering Finland.

By boat[edit]
Lappeenranta is a popular destination for boaters within the Saimaa lake area. Some cruise boats operate from Lappeenranta to other destinations on the lake. Lappeenranta is connected to the Gulf of Finland through the Saimaa Canal. The canal is also popular among boaters, and private boats occasionally come from as far as southern Europe. Check Boating on the Baltic Sea for instructions on the last legs.
As of summer 2023 the Saimaa Canal is open, but commercial shipping has dropped, because of the Russian war on Ukraine and the resulting strained relations. If coming by own yacht, check whether the canal really is open, and whether there are risks involved in passing through Russian waters (are you on their sanction list? they might find an excuse to give you a hard time).
