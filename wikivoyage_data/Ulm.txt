Understand[edit]
With a population of 127,000 inhabitants (2017), Ulm forms an urban district and administrative centre of the region. Ulm, founded around 850, is rich in history and traditions as a former Free Imperial City (German: freie Reichsstadt). Today, it is an economic centre due to its varied industries, and it is the seat of a university. Internationally, Ulm is primarily known for having the church with the tallest steeple in the world (161.53 m or 529.95 feet), the Gothic Ulm minster (German: Ulmer Münster) and as the birthplace of Albert Einstein.
Ulm lies at the Danube river and is surrounded by forests and hills which rise to altitudes of over 620 m, which are part of the  Swabian Mountains. Because of the Danube Ulm sees a lot of dense fog especially in late autumn and early spring. Most parts of the city, including the old town, are on the north-west bank of the Danube. On the other side of the river lies the twin city of Neu-Ulm in the state of Bavaria.
Around the city, there are many statues of sparrows (Spatzen). Spatzen is a nickname for the residents of Ulm and a symbol of the city.  Legend says that, while building the cathedral, the workers couldn't figure out how to get the long wooden beams into the church until they noticed a sparrow entering its nest while holding a piece of straw lengthwise, instead of sideways.

Talk[edit]
Standard German is understood by everyone, but the local dialect is Swabian (Schwäbisch).

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
The 48.49.9833331 Ulm Hauptbahnhof (main station).    is in the town centre, about a 10-minute walk from the cathedral (Ulmer Münster). Ulm is about an hour from Stuttgart and 1½-2 hours from Munich.

There are special train tickets called Länder-Tickets for travel within a region, such as Baden-Württemberg or Bavaria (Bayern).

By plane[edit]
From these airports you can take the ICE or IC train to get to Ulm.

Stuttgart Airport (STR IATA), 90 km from Ulm
Friedrichshafen Airport (FDH IATA), also known as Bodensee-Airport, Friedrichshafen[dead link] in Friedrichshafen close to Lake Constance
Memmingen Airport (FMM IATA) near Memmingen, which is roughly 60 km away. Served (and sometimes deceptively marketed as being closer to Munich than it really is) primarily by no frills airlines
Frankfurt airport (FRA IATA) is a farther away than all the other listed airports, but may serve as your entry point if none of the closer options aligns with your plans. Deutsche Bahn and most airlines have entered rail air alliances to offer combination tickets for the train ride and the flight in one package, which might work out to be the cheapest and/or most comfortable option.
