River Danube
Regensburg is one of Germany's oldest towns, founded by the Romans in 179 AD. It is in the German federal state of Bavaria, at the northernmost point of the river Danube. As capital of the district of Upper Palatinate and also its biggest settlement, Regensburg today is a thriving city of about 137,000 inhabitants.  It has two universities and many landmarks and little chapels, most dating back to the Middle Ages (e.g. the Cathedral of St. Peter, the Old City Hall and Imperial Diet, and the Stone Bridge). According to legend there are so many chapels here, that there would always be at least one church bell ringing. The historic city center of Regensburg and Stadtamhof has been a UNESCO World Heritage site since 2006. Because of its narrow alleys Regensburg is often called the northernmost city of Italy.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
The earliest settlements in the area date back as far as 5000 BC and the first Celtic settlement, called Ratisbona, was in the city's present-day vicinity from the first millennium BC.  
The official history starts in 179 AD, when the Romans built the fortress Castra Regina at the northernmost bend of the river Danube. For the following 200 years the fortress served as the Romans main military base in the province of Raetia. After the Romans left the area during the Barbarian Invasions, the town became a civil settlement. 
From about 500 Regensburg was the seat of the Bavarian dukes and was therefore referred to as the first Bavarian "capital". In 739, the bishopric of Regensburg was founded by St. Boniface, making it one of the oldest on German soil.
Regensburg grew to strength and prosperity during the Middle Ages. In the 9th century Regensburg was one of the most important cities in the East Frankish Kingdom. Through the long-distance trade to Paris, Kiev and Venice; Regensburg’s economy boomed in the 12th and 13th century, and it was one of the most populous and prosperous cities. A sign of the prosperity of the time is the construction of the Stone Bridge (c. 1135-1146). In 1245, Emperor Frederick II raised Regensburg to the status of Free Imperial City, and it remained so until 1803.
Construction of the cathedral started in 1273, and building continued for nearly 600 years until the structure was completed in 1872.  Both the Stone Bridge and Regensburg Cathedral have survived unchanged and are the city's main sights today. 
When the Empire dissolved during the Napoleonic Wars, Napoleon forced Regensburg to agree to become a part of the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1810, which ended the city's political importance.  This decline in importance in the 19th century meant that industrialisation and modernisation of that time had a limited effect on the city, and many buildings prior to this period were preserved. 
Regensburg economically regained some strength because of its role as a river port for crude oil imports from Eastern Europe.  Although Regensburg was targetted by 20 allied bombings during World War II, because it was home to one of Messerschmitt's main aircraft factories as well as an oil refinery, the historic city center suffered little damage. Two sub-camps of the Flossenbürg concentration camp were located near the town for a brief period of time in early 1945. In 1960 the university was founded and several large companies like Siemens, BMW, Infineon, and Toshiba built factories in the city. In 2006 Regensburg's historic city center was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Regensburg was also home to the German Pope  Joseph Ratzinger (Benedict XVI).  He spent a long time in the city and from 1969 on he taught theology at Regensburg University.

As one of the few cities in Germany that remained mostly undamaged during World War II, Regensburg boasts the largest preserved medieval city centre in Germany. It contains the highlights of the city: Regensburg Cathedral and the Stone Bridge. The city is sometimes called "the northernmost city of Italy" due to the lively places and streets with lovely outdoor cafes during summer, as well as the large number of Italian-style medieval merchant houses and towers. The historic centre lies next to the river Danube (German: Donau), and crossing the medieval stone bridge into the town provides a perfect entrance to the city and a great view over the whole historic city centre.

Buy[edit]
Regensburg made its fortune trading in salt, however it is unlikely that you will be taking this home as a souvenir. Regensburg has many centuries worth of old breweries, so perhaps some local beer, or perhaps a litre Stein (glass) would be a good purchase. Try some "Händlmaier's Senf", the typical sweet mustard that is usually served with white sausages.
There are several shopping malls in Regensburg:

 Regensburg Arcaden (directly connected to the main station). Handy if you have some time to kill at the station, and has many food shops. 
 Donaueinkaufszentrum (DEZ). Very big shopping mall, you can find almost everything in it 
The Alex Center
The KÖWE Center
Eat[edit]
Regensburg has a superb variety of places to eat, from snacks, to traditional brewery fare, past international cuisine to high-class restaurants. There is sure to be something to please every taste.
One famous place is the "Wurstkuchl", just at the Steinerne Brücke (Stone Bridge), founded over 900 years ago and presumably the oldest fast food restaurant in the world. There is a small beer garden right at the river bank where you can enjoy the sausage specialties served by waiters in medieval dress.

Drink[edit]
In the inner city there are over 350 bars, cafés, clubs and discos within easy walking distance of each other. 

Breweries and beergardens[edit]
Regensburgs main drink is, just as usual for Bavarian cities, surely beer. The city boasts three functioning breweries and two brew pubs, producing a variety of beer styles, from lighter Pils to heavy Dunkels; Weißbier (wheat beer) is also locally made. A typical pub to visit would be the "Kneitinger" at the Arnulfsplatz 3. Also the beer gardens near the Danube "Alte Linde" and "Spital Garten", both reachable from the Stone Bridge, offer a perfect way to taste Regensburg-brewed beer. The Bischofshof beer can be tasted next to the cathedral in the court of the "Bischofshof", where the brewery used to be.
The beer from the Thurn und Taxis brand is primarily no longer brewed in Regensburg, but an exception is the Thurn und Taxis brew pub "Fürstliches Brauhaus" in the Waffnergasse 6.
When visiting in summer, there isn't much (in terms of enjoying a cold one) that tops sitting in one of Regensburg's beergardens.
