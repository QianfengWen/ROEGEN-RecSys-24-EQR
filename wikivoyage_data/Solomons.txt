Solomons Waterfront
Solomons (Solomons Island) is a resort area in Southern Maryland, near the Patuxent Naval Air Station. Solomons within a two-hour drive of Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Annapolis. Solomons is also close to the Calvert Cliffs State Park, which is fun for fossil hunting. Located where the Patuxent River meets the Chesapeake Bay, it is a popular destination for fishing and boating. Solomons also has a nice, short boardwalk at the tip of the peninsula and a lively restaurant scene.

Go next[edit]
Just southeast of Solomons is the historic St. Mary's City, one of the very first British settlements in North America.
The chalk cliffs at Calvert Cliffs State Park, a few miles north of town, are a fun spot for fossil hunting.  The park is very popular, and its public beach is usually picked over by noon; however, even casual visitors can expect to find common fossils.  The park also offers an elaborate playground constructed from used tires and excellent wildlife spotting along its marsh.
To the north, in Lexington Park, you can visit the Patuxent River Naval Air Museum.
