By phone[edit]
Most telephone numbers in Campbellsville consist of +1 270 plus a seven-digit number, but a second area code (+1 364) was overlaid onto the entire 270 area in February 2014. A local or in-state telephone call now requires all 10 digits of the local number be dialed (omitting just the leading +1 from a local landline call).
Signage on many established businesses may still display the original seven-digit numbers; dial 270 before these if no area code is indicated.
