Mažeikiai is a city in Samogitia in the northwest of Lithuania. It's the country's eighth largest city, with a population of 32,470 in 2020. 


Understand[edit]
This was a small market town until 1869 when the Vilnius - Liepaja railway came through; in 1919 Mažeikiai became the provincial capital. It's close to the border with Latvia, which tried to claim it in 1921, but an international commission rejected the claim. It was occupied by Germany from June 1941, and its Jewish population of 4000 was wiped out; the Soviets recaptured the town in Oct 1944.
Today the principal business is Orlen oil refinery, a large complex 10 km northeast of town. Its design capacity is 15 million tons of crude oil per annum.
Asteroid 248839 Mazeikiai, discovered in 2006, is named in honour of the town. Its dimensions are similar, with a diameter of 2.6 km.
