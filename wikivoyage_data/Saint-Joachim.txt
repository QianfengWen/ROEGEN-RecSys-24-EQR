Understand[edit]
Geography[edit]
This municipality is mainly characterized by:

the Cap Tourmente National Wildlife Reserve: this wildlife reserve is made up of marshes, plains, forests and hills/mountains along the north shore of the St. Lawrence River. Every two years, thousands of visitors come to admire the snow geese in their migratory stopover in the Cap Tourmente national wildlife reserve;
the Côte de La Miche: the municipal territory is crossed from southwest to northeast by Route 138 which runs along the north shore of the St. Lawrence River. Heading east, after crossing the Saint-Anne River bridge, Route 138 gradually rises to 2.9 km (1.8 mi), then climbs rapidly to 5.7 km (3.5 mi) to reach an altitude of 384 m at the junction of chemin Cauchon. The ascent of this coast of the Miche constitutes the right of entry into the Canadian shield, leaving the plain of the St. Lawrence;
the flats of Pointe aux Prêtres: these flats stretch for 6.7 km (4.2 mi) between Cap Tourmente and Pointe aux Prêtres (and advance into the river up to 1.6 km (0.99 mi) at low tide) which is south of the village of Saint-Joachim. From there, the narrower flats continue westward to the Périgny sector of the hamlet of Sainte-Anne-Ouest. These flats are revealed at low tide;
the Rivière Sainte-Anne which includes (from the mouth): small islands near the mouth, a series of rapids in the lower part, the Sainte-Anne waterfall (in a steep arwa) and Sept-Chutes (in a steep-sided area) on the border of Saint-Joachim, Saint-Ferréol-les-Neiges and Saint-Tite-des-Caps;
its small agricultural part in the riparian zone with a maximum width of 3.0 km (1.9 mi), which begins at the foot of Cap Tourmente and stretches west to the river Saint Anne. From the beginning of colonization by the French, this site was used for agriculture essential to the development of New France. There are still important traces of the past today: farm buildings that belonged to the Séminaire de Québec, archaeological remains of the fires made by English General James Wolfe to take the city of Québec and a heritage church dating from the French regime;
the panorama of the northeast end of Île d'Orléans: the Île d'Orléans channel has a width of 2.6 km (1.6 mi) at the height of the village of Saint-Joachim;
the picturesque village of Saint-Joachim: this small inverted L-shaped village is part of the plain and is near the shore of the St. Lawrence River. In the village, the panorama is splendid on (counter-clockwise): Cap Tourmente, Côte de la Miche, Mont Ferréol, Mont Saint-Anne and the other nearby peaks of the Laurentian Shield.
History[edit]
Saint-Joachim has four centuries of history. From 1623, the inhabitants harvested fodder there. Its historic buildings and infrastructure straddle the French regime in Canada until 1759; then the English regime since 1759. During the English conquest of 1759, many farms and houses were destroyed; these buildings were rebuilt in subsequent years.

The Sainte-Anne canyon is on the border of Saint-Joachim and Saint-Ferréol-les-Neiges. It all started 1.2 billion years ago (Precambrian era) with the formation of the rock of the walls and the bottom of the canyon which are part of the Canadian Shield. It was during the melting of an ice cap 75,000 years ago that the current Quebec hydrographic network was formed (St. Lawrence River, Île d'Orléans, Îles de la Madeleine and the rivers known today) as well as the Canyon as we can see it today.This extraordinary natural site has been accessible to the general public since 1973, but Indigenous peoples used to frequent the site. The waterfall was painted by the famous Cornelius Kreighoff and described by the American ecologist and philosopher H.D. Thoreau.Easy-to-access family footpaths allow you to enter the spectacular canyon carved out by the imposing 74 metres (243 ft) fall which constantly rumbles between the rocky walls of the gorges. Visitors cross 3 suspension bridges… including one 60 metres (200 ft) high! One of the largest giant's pot in Quebec (15 metres (49 ft) in diameter) is visible as well as several waterfalls when you are at the bottom of the Canyon.The exceptional beauty of the site has often been recognized, both in Quebec (recipient of 3 Grands Prix du tourisme) and in Canada (national winner Attractions Canada). When John Travolta came to shoot his film Battlefield Earth in Montreal, several scenes were shot in Charlevoix and at Canyon Sainte-Anne."Roc-ambolesque" family games allow young people and their parents to have fun by decoding riddles and legends in a section of the park different from that which allows the visit of the site.For adventurers and thrill-seekers, it is possible to do vias ferrata, abseiling and zip-lining in the gorges of the Canyon. In fact, the Via des Marmites was the first via installed in Quebec. The concept is imported from Europe by well-known Quebec adventurer François-Guy Thivièrge.For people who have difficulty walking, it is possible to take advantage of a shuttle service that runs along the entire North Rim of the Canyon and provides access to 2 of the 3 suspension bridges.On site, the main building offers a snack service and a pleasant terrace. There are also 2 wooded picnic areas, one of which is directly by the river.   (updated Feb 2022)
