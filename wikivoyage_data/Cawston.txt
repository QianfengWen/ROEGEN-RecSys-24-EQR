Cawston, British Columbia
Cawston is a small town in the Similkameen. With a population of under 1000, it is surrounded by agriculture. There are about 100 organic farms in the area, and some of those farms distribute the Cawston name throughout B.C. and beyond.


Understand[edit]
The land where Cawston now lies is part of the traditional territories of the Syilx (or Okanagan) people. At their peak, about 3000 years ago, some 12,000 people lived in the region. The subgroup of Syilx known as the sməlqmix (or Similkameen) followed a nomadic life around present-day Cawston. A village was located in nearby Keremeos. Ancestral remains were found in Cawston during excavation, early in 2016.
Settlers arrived in the area during the 19th century. The Hudson's Bay company opened a trading post in this location. Missionaries and gold prospectors came. The present town is named for 19th-century local rancher, R.L. Cawston.

Get in[edit]
BC Highway 3 (the Crowsnest Highway) bisects the town north-west to south-east. It travels east from Vancouver and Hope (British Columbia) and west from Osoyoos in the Okanagan. A private auto is the easiest way to get here.
