Barrackpore is a cantonment town in North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal. The town is enriched with the outbreak of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The rebellion began in this town under the leadership of Mangal Pandey. The tree from which Mangal Pandey and Ishwari Pandey were hanged is still there. However, Barrackpore is more than just the origin of the historic rebellion and the scenic beauty of the Hooghly River is something you should not miss.
