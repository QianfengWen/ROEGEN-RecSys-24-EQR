Port Pirie is a coastal town on the Spencer Gulf in South Australia, developed around its port and industry.


Understand[edit]
Get in[edit]
Port Pirie is just off the Port Augusta Highway (A1) around 250 km north of Adelaide, and an hour or so south of Port Augusta.  The A1 leaves the coast at Port Wakefield and, with the exception of the salt lakes at Locheil, takes a direct route lacking in attractions.  The Copper Coast Highway is an alternate route, hitting a few towns along the coast.

Port Pirie Railway Station
The Ghan and the Indian Pacific both pass through here but do not stop.
Premier Stateliner runs coach services daily.

Get around[edit]
See[edit]
 Nyrstar Port Pirie Smelter. Is the largest lead smelter in the world.  The large chimney is visible from many miles around.  The best view of the facility is probably from the other side of the Port Pirie River, just cross the river at the bridge to nowhere off the main street. 
 Flinders View Park. 
Do[edit]
 Solomontown Beach. A nice pier, man-made beach and swimming spot.  Take care with strong tides if you go too far out into the river. Showers and change rooms.
