Stay safe[edit]
Despite what the media says, Hartford is generally a safe city. The areas where tourist attractions, colleges, shops, nightclubs and restaurants are is safe. Most of the violence is confined to the north end of Hartford which includes areas north and west of downtown (excluding the North Meadows and West End). A majority of the attractions and entertainment in Hartford is located in Downtown/Central Business District, the West End, South End, and North Meadows and these areas are fairly safe.
North Meadows safety: If you are a visitor you would visit the North Meadows if you were attending some sort of event. The Dodge Music Center, Connecticut Expo Center and the Greater Hartford Jaycees Community Boathouse are all in the North Meadows. This area is not a residential neighborhood, it is a commercial and industrial neighborhood and when major events take place there is a police presence in the area to make sure things don't get out of hand at a big concert for example.
West End safety: The West End is home to the Mark Twain House, Harriet Beecher Stowe House, UCONN School of Law, Hartford Seminary, University of Hartford, Governors Mansion, Elizabeth Park and Watkinson School. This area is extremely safe and since there are so many colleges University of Hartford and UCONN police patrol the area in addition to the Hartford Police Department
Downtown/ Central Business District safety: Downtown is home to the Old State House, Wadsworth Atheneum, State Capital, Capital Community College, Constitution Plaza, Hartford Civic Center, CT Convention Center and most of the major Hartford hotels (Marriott, Hilton, Holiday Inn Express Downtown, Goodwin, Residence Inn by Marriott, Homewood Suites by Hilton) as well as many of the well known nightclubs, bars and restaurants and so there are usually people downtown. If you are planning on going to the major nightclub/bar area by Union Station (Allyn Street, Union Place, Ann Street) there are sometimes police patrolling the area to make sure nothing gets out of control. Also when there are major events such as games or conventions there are also usually extra police on duty.
South End safety: The south end is safe but when driving in areas of the south end do be cautious as drivers can be wild and pedestrians many times do not confine themselves to crosswalks. Besides Franklin Avenue, Wethersfield Avenue and Maple Avenue many areas of the South End are residential so there is a sense of community and low crime
North End safety: Areas in the north end of Hartford (Albany Avenue between just north of downtown and the west end) and the surrounding neighborhood can be dangerous during the nighttime. Since it is better to be safe than sorry, if you are planning on driving through this area keep your doors locked.
