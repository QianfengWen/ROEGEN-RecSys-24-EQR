Sleep[edit]
Andover's hotels are clustered immediately off I-93, just south of the Merrimack River. They've all got identical pricing and amenities, so there's no need to be choosy. They're also largely inconvenient to exploring Andover. Main Street is a few miles away, so you'll need a car to see much of anything. The Andover Inn is the exception; built on campus, it's a 15 minute walk to the downtown area.
