Not to be confused with Lidköping in Västergötland.

Linköping (pronounced "Lin-shœ-ping") is Sweden's fifth biggest municipality,  and the seat of Östergötland county. It has about 167,000 inhabitants in the municipality (2023), including some countryside, and just under 100,000 in the city proper.
The city has the advantage of being a major city with all that it entails yet retaining the cozy quiet small town feel, largely due to the lack of tall buildings; a result of the military airfield just outside the city.
Linköping countryside makes up Linköping municipality outside the built-up area.

The cathedral in wintry Linköping

Understand[edit]
Linköping is the clerical and administrative centre in a rich farmland district, the province and county Östergötland.
The town was founded during the Middle Ages and is therefore one of the oldest cities in Sweden. The cathedral and the castle are two medieval buildings that are still standing.
At the "battle of Stångebro" in 1598, the city fought on the Catholic side and lost. A memorial of the battle is found just outside the city centre. The following "bloodbath of Linköping" in 1600 is remembered with a memorial at the main square.
Linköping has a university and the students are a central part of the city's life day and night.
