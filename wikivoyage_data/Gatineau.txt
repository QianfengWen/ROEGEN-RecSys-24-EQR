Gatineau is a city in the Outaouais region of Quebec, on the north shore of the Ottawa River, across from Canada's capital, Ottawa. It is part of the official National Capital Region which constitutes the fourth largest urban area in the country, after Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. With 291,041 inhabitants in 2021, it is the largest city in the administrative region of Outaouais. Gatineau straddles the Gatineau River, a tributary of the Ottawa River.


Understand[edit]
Canadian Museum of History (formerly known as the Canadian Museum of Civilization) in Hull
Gatineau (municipality) is a city resulting from the amalgamation of the older cities of Gatineau, Hull, Aylmer, Masson-Angers and Buckingham. The old city names are still used as the sector names of the amalgamated Gatineau. The majority of Hullois and Gatinois are francophones, and most are bilingual.
Hull (population 65,000) is the original centre of the city, the most densely-populated (but not most populous) area in the Outaouais region and the closest to Ottawa. On the west bank of the Gatineau River and north of the Ottawa (Outaouais) River, Hull is directly opposite Parliament Hill, Lowertown Ottawa and the Byward Market.
Hull was founded 1800 by Philemon Wright as a lumber camp on the Ottawa River and therefore predates Ottawa, although the town's former principal industry of manufacturing matchsticks led to a major fire; little or nothing from the 1800s remains in Hull today. The downtown waterfront was once heavily industrialized by Scott and Eddy, the two main paper makers, and the Ottawa river was used to generate hydroelectric power. The city's largest employer is the federal government with 20,000 civil servants working in Hull and thousands more who commute to Ontario daily.
Aylmer is a small-town suburb directly west of Hull. Gatineau (secteur), the bedroom community for which the amalgamated municipality was named, is to the east of the Gatineau River. Further downriver is Buckingham, a small rural village. Head further afield and one quickly finds open farmland and the occasional maple sugar shack, a seasonal tradition where trees are tapped and sap distilled to produce Québec's famous maple syrup.
Head north from Hull and one quickly arrives in Gatineau Park; the Camp Fortune and Edelweiss ski areas are also north of the city, near Chelsea and Wakefield respectively.

They also make available information on infrastructure progress. Contact them also with questions about routes, concerns and popular destinations. Although it is a volunteer-run organisation, they are usually fairly fast in responding. #ottbike is the commonly used hashtag on social media.

Splurge[edit]
Speciality and seasonal[edit]
The érablière, cabane à sucre or maple sugar shack is a seasonal tradition across a wide region extending from southeastern Ontario to Québec's Eastern Townships. With rare exception, these are found in the countryside near tiny rural villages. Local maple syrup is produced seasonally; the sap begins to flow early during the spring thaw and is collected for distillation. This places the start of the season at the mercy of the elements, although there is usually fresh syrup to be had in late March or early April - usually before the last of the snow is gone. Maple sugar shacks are typically large rural communal dining halls in which diners fill up on a dietician's nightmare of traditional high-calorie lumberjack food, cost starts around $20/person but varies as some venues offer entertainment, "tire sur neige" (maple toffee on snow) or sled rides. Once the season ends, many of these venues close or are used for other agritourism activity - an open field often becomes a summer campground.
