Gourock is a ferry port on Clydeside in the Central Belt of Scotland. Most visitors are only passing through, to catch ferries to Dunoon in Argyll. In 2020 Gourock had a population of 10,210.


Understand[edit]
Gourock was a fishing village, historically part of Renfrewshire. In the 18th century the "Tail of the Bank" of the Clyde became industrial between Port Glasgow and Greenock, but the wealthy merchants and shipbuilders kept Gourock and western Greenock unspoiled for their fine villas. When the railway arrived in 1889, Gourock became part of the "Costa Clyde" or "Glasgow Riveria" of holiday destinations along the coast down into Ayrshire. It still has that role, but nowadays as a springboard for reaching the Cowal and Rosneath peninsulas rather than as a resort in its own right.

By road[edit]
Follow the M8 westbound from Glasgow to its end where it becomes the A8, continue through Greenock to Gourock. From the southwest, follow the A78 along the Ayrshire coast.

By train[edit]
Trains from Glasgow Central run every 15 min via Paisley Gilmour Street, Bishopton, Port Glasgow and Greenock Central and West, taking 40-50 min to Gourock. The first train is around 6AM and the last is towards midnight. As trains and ferries are both frequent, they're not normally held for each other. If you're running late for the last connection of the day, make your plight known to the conductor or ferry steward, and the connection might be held - you won't be the only one.

See[edit]
Granny Kempock
55.9614-4.81981 Granny Kempock is a megalith or menhir just above the main street. It's a grey mica schist: it's not known when it was placed here, and may not be in its original position. Bronze Age has been suggested but the markings on it are much more recent. Various superstitions and rituals have attached to it, for instance departing sailors and newly-weds walked seven times around it for luck. In 1662 Marie Lamont confessed to dancing round the stone and trying to throw it into the sea to sink shipping, also to changing her shape into a cat, stealing milk by an incantation over a tether made of cows' tails, and having sex with the devil when he appeared as a brown dog. She and her accomplices were burned at the stake. Marie was 16.
55.9567-4.82232 Tower Hill is the breezy park overlooking town and the Firth. The stumpy tower at the summit was built in 1847 as a lookout-cum-folly - you can't go in.
