Starke is a town in North Central Florida with a population of about 6,000, between Gainesville and Jacksonville.


Understand[edit]
Downtown Starke
History[edit]
The origins of the town's name are disputed; it was probably named after local landowner and slaveholder Thomas Starke. The town grew rapidly during the late 19th century, following the American Civil War.
A number of government institutions are near Starke, including National Guard base Camp Blanding and the Florida State Prison. The establishment of Camp Blanding in 1940 brought a massive population increase to Starke, as some 800,000 soldiers were trained there through the course of WWII. Hence the population boomed during the war and post-war, rising from less than 1,500 in 1940 to almost 5,000 at the 1960 census.
The town became an unlikely destination for filmmaking due to nearby Camp Blanding, with filming for G.I. Jane, Tigerland, and Basic occurring at the base. Why Do Fools Fall in Love was filmed in Starke itself. Military and government-related TV shows have also been filmed in the Starke area.

Climate[edit]
As a northern Florida town, Starke experiences a stark contrast between summer and winter weather. The two main seasons are the dry and wet seasons. The dry season lasts from fall, around November, to May, with the driest months being November, December, and April. Heavy rain arrives in June and persists throughout the summer, when temperatures reach the 90's (mid-30's) and the air is humid. Winters tend to be cool but are variable, with cold fronts from the Deep South causing temperatures to near freezing a few times a year.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The main way to access Starke is via US-301. If approaching from Jacksonville, exit I-10 to go south at Baldwin. If traveling from Gainesville, take FL-24 to Waldo, where it meets US-301 to go north to Starke.

Get around[edit]
By car[edit]
US-301 splits on both sides of Starke. One route is an expressway and bypasses Starke to the west, while the old route forms a T-junction with the new route and goes through Temple Ave through Starke. Downtown Starke is designed on an approximately grid road format.
