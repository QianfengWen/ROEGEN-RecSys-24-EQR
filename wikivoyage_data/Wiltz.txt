The Castle of Wiltz.
Wiltz is a town in Éislek. It is located on the banks of the river Wiltz spanning mostly across a steep hill with 100m of altitude difference. It was a battleground during the Battle of the Bulge.


Understand[edit]
One of the many attractions of Wiltz is its castle, Wiltz Castle. This castle concludes of 2.4km2 (600 acres) of lawns and gardens and hundreds of rooms. The construction of the Wiltz Castle was completed in 1727 and was used until the last Count of Wiltz died in 1793. From 1851 to 1950 it was used as a private girls school, becoming a retirement home after 1950.
The welfare and industrialisation of Wiltz boomed in the late 19th and early 20th century due to the leather industry.
During World War II, which started on the 10th of May, 1940, Wiltz became the city that stood up against the Nazi Germans by starting the general strike, a reaction to the directive of enlisting young Luxembourgers into the Wehrmacht. This general strike of 1942 paralysed the country and led to violent responses from the Nazi German occupiers. The town also was involved, though not directly in the Battle of the Bulge.
Wiltz is nowadays a very international town and has the largest community of people from former Yugoslav countries in Luxembourg.
