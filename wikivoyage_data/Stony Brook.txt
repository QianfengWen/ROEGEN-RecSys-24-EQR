Stony Brook Harbor
Stony Brook is a hamlet bordering the Long Island Sound, located in northern Suffolk County, on Long Island, in New York. This historic town is home to Stony Brook University, The Stony Brook School, Three Village School District, and the “Stony Brook Village.”


Understand[edit]
Stony Brook was a pretty unknown place until Stony Brook University was constructed, but that's the way the wealthy residents of the hamlet wanted it. As a result, there has been very little development within walking distance of the university, other than a minimal strip of shops directly across the street from the train station. Instead, the center of the hamlet has remained where it was, two and one-half miles or so north of the train station, and retains a charming, old-fashioned feel.

By train[edit]
The MTA Long Island Rail Road has a station in Stony Brook. Service from New York on the Port Jefferson Line takes about 1 hour and 45 minutes and requires a change of trains from an electric-powered to a diesel-powered train, usually in Huntington but sometimes in Jamaica or Hicksville. There are virtually always clear announcements telling riders where to change, and conductors are also helpful with information.
40.920095-73.1285481 Stony Brook Station is right next to the university.

By car[edit]
Route 25A is called North Country Road in Stony Brook. It is a through street that traverses most of the island, but it has traffic lights. If you are coming from farther west than Smithtown or Kings Park, you should instead take the Long Island Expressway (I-495) and get off on the exit for Nicolls Road (Route 97) north, or take the Northern State Parkway, which turns into Route 454 in Hauppauge, and then the Nesconset Highway (Route 347), and go north (left) on Nicolls Road.

Get around[edit]
It's a pretty long walk from the train station to Stony Brook Village. Most people either drive, take a taxi from the train station, or use a bicycle in decent weather. If you do walk on the streets, keep in mind that they often lack sidewalks, and you may also be yelled at by idle joyriding teens with nothing better to do. That said, otherwise, the walk is not unpleasant.
