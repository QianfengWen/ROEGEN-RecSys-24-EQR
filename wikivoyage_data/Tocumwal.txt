Sleep[edit]
Camps and caravan parks[edit]
Tocumwal is well known for its informal camping along both banks of the Murray River, with fishers and campers (up to 4,000 at any one time) enjoying the river and the associated River Red Gum forest. Camping along the river is largely unregulated (and free of charge) although strict rules apply regarding fires and waste disposal. There are no toilets and no rubbish bins for the informal campers so take your own "tin" and take all rubbish and waste with you. Over the Christmas/New Year period, Australia Day long weekend, Victorian Labour Day and Easter period, campsites are at a premium so you will need to get established early. Victorian and New South Wales authorities have expressed a desire to better regulate this type of camping in the future.
For campers wanting something a little more formal, there are options:
