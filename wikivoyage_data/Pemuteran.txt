Pemuteran is a fishing village on the northern coast of West Bali. This fishing village has become very popular with visitors. Waterfront resorts, its proximity to Lovina and West Bali National Park, and the extreme natural beauty of the area have fuelled rapid growth in tourism infrastructure in the area. There are countless diving centers, bike rentals, art shops and guest houses, but they are concentrated alongside the main road and the beaches.  As soon as you leave the main road, you can see traditional village life, with small farms, temples and schools.


Understand[edit]
Pemuteran is home to the largest artificial Biorock reef project in the world and there is a real spirit of marine conservation effort in this area.

Get in[edit]
Visitors usually arrive in Pemuteran on the north coast road from Lovina or Singaraja, approximately 50 km or 1 hr 15 min, or from the west at Gilimanuk. It is one of the nearest tourist attractions from the ferry terminal, with a 45-minute to an hour's worth of driving. Regular bemos ply the north coast road but they are very slow and get extremely crowded. You can easily grab one of them almost everywhere on the road. From Gilimanuk, Bemo would be Rp 30,000-60,000, only leaving when full enough (8-10 persons) (May 2024).
You will have no problem renting a car with driver to take you from Lovina to Pemuteran - fix the price in advance and make sure petrol is included. A direct ride to Pemuteran from tourist centres in the south will take about four hours depending on traffic on the coast roads. The ride from Amed takes between 3-3½ hours depending on the traffic and will set you back between Rp 500,000-600,000 depending on your bargaining skills (2013).

Get around[edit]

The traffic on the main road easily competes with the one in Ubud. There are no sidewalks and motorbikes sometimes drive on the opposite side of the road as well.

See[edit]
Early morning dolphin watching, as in Lovina, boat trips can be arranged through any hotel. By no means guaranteed, but you have a decent chance of finding a pod here.
The beaches are especially nice in this area and consist of a particularly fine-grained black sand. Reefs located to the east of the beach emerge at low tide and are teaming with marine life including sea urchins and small crabs. Not far off from the beach on the west side of the village one can swim to the Biorock, a local coral restoration project which started in 2000. As can be seen when swimming off Menjangan Island, corals are fast perishing in the area. The beaches and the Biorock can easily be accessed on foot from Pemuteran.
Menjangan Island and West Bali National Park are easily reached from here. The Menjangan Island boats depart from Labuhan Lalang which is a 15 minute ride west from Pemuteran. Obligatory permits can be purchased from the national park office at the back of the Labuhan Lalang car park and you can also arrange a guide here. It is quite common for groups of visitors to congregate in this car park and join together to charter a boat. Most local hotels will make any arrangements you need for activities related to the national park.
Turtle Hatchery Project is a turtle breeding and release program run by one of the dive operators in co-operation with local villagers. Very much worth a visit and certainly worth your support.
The area around Pulaki village just east of Pemuteran is full of vineyards and is the centre of the grape growing industry in Bali. The local Hatten winery produces a variety of white and red wines. A visitor and tasting centre is open between 09:00 and 16:00 daily (as of June 2017). Pulaki village is around 10 km east of Pemuteran, about a 20-minute motorcycle ride.

Buy[edit]
Eat[edit]
There are several simple roadside warungs serving typical Balinese food. All of the hotels in the area have restaurants open to the general public. As might be imagined in a traditional fishing village, the seafood options are highly recommended.
Cheaper local street food seems more around mosque (about Rp 25,000 in May 2024). Else most warungs cost about Rp 50,000-100,000 and more targeted for tourist with larger portion it seems.

Sleep[edit]
Pemuteran is quite expensive by Balinese standards. There are more budget options opening and it is possible to stay cheaply with local people in their houses if you ask around once you arrive. Staying near the main road guarantees a never-ending stream of motorbike engine noise (especially as Balinese youth find it amusing to remove their exhaust mufflers).
