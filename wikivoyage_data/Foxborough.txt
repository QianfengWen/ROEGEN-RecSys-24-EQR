Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Interstate 95 and US Route 1 both pass through Foxboro. Interstate 95 also passes nearby.

By plane[edit]
Most people coming here by plane are going to want to use Boston Logan International Airport as it will most likely be cheaper, and you are more likely to get a direct route especially if you live further from the New England region. You can also use the smaller Rhode Island T.F. Green Airport as it is slightly closer to Foxborough

By train[edit]
The MBTA runs special trains from South Station in Boston and the Providence station to Foxborough for special events at Gillette Stadium.  These include all Patriots games, concerts, and other performances.  Revolution games typically aren't served by these trains, unless the game is expected to draw large crowds.
