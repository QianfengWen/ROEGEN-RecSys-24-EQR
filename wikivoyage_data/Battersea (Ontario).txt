History[edit]
Henry Van Luven, a veteran of the War of 1812 Battle of Lundy's Lane, was the founder of the village of Battersea in 1840 when he bought 1,200 acres (4.9 km²) of Crown land at the time of the development of the Rideau Canal. He called it Van Luven's Mills, then Rockland. The post office requested it be renamed to avoid confusion with a similarly named city elsewhere in the province. His first choice was to name it after a section of London, England and that was accepted. He gave 200 acres (0.81 km²) to each of his six sons and lots in the village of Battersea to his daughters. Henry built the stone mill in Battersea.
The large Van Luven family home is on a rise at the entrance to what is now Battersea. In 1912 the home was converted into a fishing lodge, now called the Holiday Manor Northern Lodge.

Get in[edit]
 From Kingston and Kingston Mills, take Battersea Road (Montréal Street, 401 exit 619) northbound to Battersea.
 From elsewhere in the Rideau Canal system (including Smiths Falls), take 15 south and cross the canal near Brewers Mills (any of Burnt Hills Road, CR12 - Sunbury Road or Washburn Road join Hwy 15 to CR 11 - Battersea Road). While the Battersea Road continues north to end at Highway 15, this becomes a winding road and progressively more difficult as one continues north through Frontenac County.
From Westport, take CR 10 - Perth Road south to Inverary, then turn east.
