Facade of the Saint-Médard church
Thouars [dead link] is a small city in Deux-Sèvres.


Understand[edit]
Already inhabited 5000 years ago, the city was caught in 762 by Pepin the Short and his son, the future Charlemagne. The city became the most powerful fortress in the area then called Aquitaine. Under English domination during the Hundred Years' War, Thouars was conquered by Du Guesclin, chief of Charles V's armies, at the end of a long siege.
Thouars is full of medieval artifacts, with walls, towers, and Roman churches. The Trémoille castle, completed in 1638, has an impressive facade over the Thouet river valley and the Chouans bridge, where a decisive battle was fought during the French revolution.
The small city has given its name to the Toarcian geologic age, in Early Jurassic, and the rock strata for this age can clearly be seen in a quarry near Thouars.
