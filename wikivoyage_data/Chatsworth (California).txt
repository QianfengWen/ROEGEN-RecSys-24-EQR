Do[edit]
Stoney Point California
 Stoney Point, 11000 Topanga Canyon Blvd (street parking on Topanga or on Chatsworth), ☏ +1 818 756-8189. daily 6AM-6PM (i.e. sunrise to sunset). Great hiking trails, also popular with mountain climbers. Dog friendly. No snackbar or washroom facilities. Bring your own water. Prepare to spend hours of discovery on this hike at Stoney Point in Chatsworth where boulders merge together to form caves, dens, and alcoves that beg to be explored, culminating in a landmark massif called Stoney Point. There is a wide trail following the base of the mountain along the south and east sides that is easily traversed with dogs. Get on the trail below “Stoney Point” and follow it around toward the east. A cluster of boulders form a good-sized cave at a small clearing to the left about midway to the east side of the mountain. A sharp eye can spot it from the trail. Look for a hitching post rail on the opposite side of the trail. Parking on Topanga Canyon Boulevard is dangerous with dogs. It’s better to take the back way by parking on Chatsworth Street near the railroad crossing west of Canoga Avenue. Follow the bridle path along the tracks heading north. A natural feature definitely worth visiting.
