Sumedang is a city and regency in the Parahyangan mountain region of Western Java, Indonesia.


Understand[edit]
The city of Sumedang is about 40 km east of the provincial capital Bandung. The Mount Tampomas volcano is in Sumedang regency, just north of the city.

Get in[edit]
Sumedang is along the main road between the major cities of Bandung and Cirebon. This road was part of the Great Post Road, built in the early 19th century, making Sumedang an important resting place along this road. The drive from Bandung to Sumedang is about 40 km, and takes 1h 30m if traffic conditions are good. Because of frequent major traffic congestion around Bandung, the drive to Sumedang also regularly takes longer. From the Indonesian capital Jakarta, Sumedang can be reached by taking the toll road towards Cirebon until exit KM 159, and then taking the trunk road to the southwest to Sumedang.
The main intercity bus route to Sumedang is operated by bus company Medal Sekarwangi. The bus route runs from Kamung Rambutan terminal in East Jakarta via the toll road to Cileunyi in East Bandung, and then to -6.825494107.919451 Ciakar bus terminal in the north of Sumedang. This bus route is operated about 12 times per day, of which three are night buses. A one-way ticket Jakarta-Sumedang is Rp50,000 (2016). In addition, many of the intercity buses between Bandung and Cirebon stop in Sumedang, but usually just along the main road and not at the terminal.
