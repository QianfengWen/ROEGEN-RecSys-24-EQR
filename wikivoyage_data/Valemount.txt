Valemount is a village of about 1,000 people (2016) in the Robson Valley region of Northern British Columbia. At the meeting point of three mountain ranges, it has a number of outdoor activities and is a good base for exploring nearby Mount Robson Provincial Park.


Understand[edit]
Valemount was a small settlement until it was incorporated as a village in 1962. Through the following decades, the village's population grew or declined in line with the fortunes of the local lumber industry and the village's sawmill. Since the 1990s, tourism has become more important in the local economy.
Many artists, artisans and authors make Valemount their home.
