Ireland Hofer House in Williamstown

Williamstown is a city in the Delaware River region of New Jersey.


Understand[edit]
Williamstown is a large town that is officially called Monroe Township. The community is at the southwestern end of a large urban area that extends to Philadelphia and Trenton in the north. The southern side of Williamstown is the less populated of the two sides and is mostly forested. Areas to the west are more farming country than areas to the east.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The main road through town is the U.S. Route 322, which enters the town from the southeast and west. Route 42 also enters the town from the northwest. There are several other roads that enter Williamstown, including Blue Bell Road, Clayton Avenue, North Main Street, County Route 536, Radix Road, New Brooklyn Road, and Winslow Road.
Atlantic City Expressway passes north of the town, and roads connect it with Williamstown (for example, Winslow Road).

By bus[edit]
There are several bus stations along U.S. Route 322, especially southwest of the town and in the town itself.

Get around[edit]
By car[edit]
Although streets tend to be at odd angles, the town shouldn't be hard to get around. The Black Horse Pike goes through the town, and Main Street runs fairly parallel with the Pike.
Getting across the town from east to west or west to east requires a little more effort. For example, New Brooklyn Road leads into the town from the east, but doesn't go all the way through the town. You can cross the town in a somewhat east-west direction by following the U.S. Route; however, this is also a south-north route. The main roads to get around town are definitely New Brooklyn Road (Poplar Street), Main Street, and any highway routes.

By bus[edit]
There are several bus stops along the Main Street.
