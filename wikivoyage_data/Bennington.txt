Bennington is a town in Southwestern Vermont. Boasting five covered bridges it is a classic Vermont country town, and is also home to Bennington College. This article also encompasses the neighboring town of North Bennington.


Understand[edit]
Bennington is a historically important town that contains many 18th- and 19th-century buildings, as well as much greenery in season. Its skyline is largely dominated by the Bennington Battle Monument, a large obelisk jutting into the sky that honors the achievements of the Green Mountain Boys, who fought effectively for the Revolutionaries in the American War of Independence. By so doing, the Green Mountain Boys also were able to make an effective case for Vermont to be admitted as a separate state from New York, and they were admitted in 1791 as the 14th state.

Get in[edit]
Bennington is the second-to-southernmost town in Vermont on US Route 7 and as a township, it borders on New York State.

By car[edit]
Bennington's downtown is at the intersection of US Route 7 (which goes south through the Massachusetts Berkshires and north to Rutland) and Burlington) and Vermont Route 9 (which goes east to Brattleboro and to the west, beyond the New York State line, becomes New York State Route 7 and connects with Troy). Although these routes have short stretches of limited access, they are mainly one lane in each direction, with stoplights. New York State Route 7 even has some hairpin curves a few miles to the west.

By plane[edit]
The closest major airport is in Albany.

By bus[edit]
The closest Greyhound Bus stop is in Williamstown, Massachusetts.

Get around[edit]
Downtown Bennington is walkable, but you'll probably need a car if you plan on doing much.
