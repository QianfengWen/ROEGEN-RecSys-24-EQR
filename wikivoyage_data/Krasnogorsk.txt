Krasnogorsk is a small city in West Moscow Oblast that is best known for its 18-hole golf course, the Moscow Country Club Resort, where Moscow's finest come to play. But even with out the allure of 18 holes, the city is worth a visit for its two large classical estates, one of which (Arkhangelskoye) is one of the finest in Moscow Oblast.
