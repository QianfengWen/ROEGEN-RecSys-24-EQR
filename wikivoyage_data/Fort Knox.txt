Fort Knox is a U.S. Army post in the Kentucky Derby Region.


Understand[edit]
Fort Knox is internationally known for the United States Bullion Depository, which stores a large portion of gold and other valuable items in the United States' possession. It is estimated to hold 2.3% of all gold refined in human history.
Film producer Albert Broccoli managed to get permission to use the exterior of Fort Knox as a location for the James Bond film Goldfinger, though they were restricted to a minimum of 3000 ft (900 m) in the airspace above it for the aerial scenes.  The interior scenes were a film set at Pinewood Studios.

Get in[edit]





Note: While you may freely drive through Fort Knox on major highways, do not stop or turn off the highway without authorization. In particular, do not drive past any large red and white "Restricted Area" signs.





US 31W runs roughly north/south next to Fort Knox; drivers may access the Brandenburg Station Road, Chaffee Avenue, and Wilson Road Gates, as they travel north to south, respectively. 31W connects Elizabethtown 15 minutes to the South, and Louisville about 60 minutes to the north. Further east runs I65, also connecting Elizabethtown and Louisville. KY 313, running east/west, brings in traffic from I-65 to the east, via exit 102.

Get around[edit]

Not much effort seems to have been made to make navigating around post easy; most signs for buildings use difficult-to-read "military speak" (for example, the Leader's Club sign is marked: "Directorate Of Morale, Welfare, and Recreation", and in relatively tiny text at the bottom: Leader's Club). However, almost every street intersection is clearly labeled, though the existing signs differ for some roads from the names given by Google Maps.
The Fort Knox MWR Guidebook (available at several locations around post) has probably the best map of post available to the average visitor.

Eat[edit]
There are a few restaurants near the Post Exchange such as a Burger King, Popeyes, Qdoba and Subway.

Drink[edit]
Rocker II and the Leader's Club have full bars on post. Rocker II offers wide screen TV's, 4 pool tables and dart boards, and various video games to provide weekend diversions. The Leader's Club features Fiddler's Green Bar and Lounge, as well as the Bullion Room Restaurant.

Sleep[edit]
There are 600 transient lodging spaces at 6 locations around post are available for soldiers on TDY assignment. Separate spaces are also available for up to 76 Permanent Party Geographical Bachelors (GBQ). Transient lodging spaces range from dormitory style to efficiency apartments, but most will feature queen-sized beds, basic kitchen facilities with microwave and refrigerator (and sometimes stove), as well as cable TV and high-speed internet connections (wired).
For civilians, look for accommodation in nearby Radcliff, Brandenburg or Elizabethtown.

Connect[edit]
By phone[edit]
Calls between landline phones on the post can still be made by dialing the last five digits. However, all calls made to off-post numbers, whether long-distance or not, require 10-digit dialing—despite the fact that the area code 502 that serves the post has not yet been subject to an overlay plan (i.e., a second area code that covers the same geographic area).
This is because the local calling area for Fort Knox includes areas outside the 502 area code that are served by an overlay complex of two area codes, 270 and 364. Included in the 270/364 overlay and the local calling area are the cities of Radcliff, directly adjacent to the main gate, and Elizabethtown, a short distance to the south. Visitors who are staying in those cities must dial all 10 digits for local or in-state calls, omitting just the leading +1 from a local landline call.
Signage on many established businesses in Radcliff or Elizabethtown may still display the original seven-digit numbers; dial 270 before these if no area code is indicated.

Go next[edit]
The nearest large town with a little more to offer is Louisville, while Lexington is further away, but still a reasonable drive.
