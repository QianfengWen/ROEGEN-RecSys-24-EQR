Ezequiel Montes is a small town in a valley of Queretaro. It is the epicenter of the state's growing wine industry with three major wineries just outside of town and at least a dozen small artesanal wineries within 30 km. It is not as scenic as some of its neighboring towns, but could be an excellent base for the epicure who is curious to explore the wines of the Bajio.

Understand[edit]
Originally inhabited by the Otomi people, when it became a Spanish town, it took the name Tetillas, and later Corral Blanco, and then in 1920, changed the name to Ezequiel Montes in honor of a local politician. The town is not hung up on its past and lacks the colonial charm of most Bajio towns, including 3 nearby Pueblos Magicos. The city hall (palacio municipal) was built in 1970. The plaza was renovated in the 1990s. 
Agriculture accounts for more than 90% of the land use in the valley around Ezequiel Montes. Sorghum and corn account for much of the planted acreage, but vineyards account for a growing proportion of the economy. Two major vineyards account for the lion's share of local wine production:

La Redonda - heir to a traditional hacienda system, La Redonda was the first major winery in town
Freixenet - one of several international wineries operated by the Spanish company, Freixenet makes sparkling wines (similar to champagne)
The state publishes a map to the wineries and advertises it as "Ruta de Vinos" but the concept of wine as a leisure activity hasn't caught on like it has in Valle de Guadalupe. There aren't tasting rooms in the town of Ezequiel Montes and most locals seem content to stick to their usual beer or tequila.

It is easy to drive in this part of Queretaro, with paved roads between towns. Dirt roads are likely when you get off the main roads driving to some of the vineyards, but are generally passable even with small cars.
Taxis are widely available and can be hired on a daily basis for exploring backcountry wineries.

See[edit]
20.665728-99.8981391 Jardin Kiosko Ezequiel Montes. The zocalo (main plaza) is a modern looking plaza with more paved open spaces than a typical Mexican zocalo with less shade from the bright sun. There's still manicured gardens, a bandstand, and plenty of park benches and it still faces the town's main church. 
20.666953-99.8976352 Parroquia de la Divina Providencia. Unlike every other town in Mexico, the main church is not historic, is not baroque, and is not ornate. It is beautiful though with contemporary architecture and a stone facade with a tall belfry. Inside, the church is bright, spacious and inviting. 
Vineyards and Cellars[edit]
Large wineries[edit]

The Spanish-based company opened their Mexican vineyards in 1979. The winery is the largest in Central Mexico. Americans will be surprised to find no bottles of the Freixenet Cordon Negro Brut that's available in every store in America, but instead, a surprisingly wide variety of sweetness levels (and colors) across four main brand lines: Sala Vive, Vina Dolores, Vivante, and Petillant. This ain't the Freixenet back in Kansas!

You can also buy wines by the bottle and enjoy them in the "wine garden" (which is so big, they should call it the "wine farm"). If you're looking for a place to stay, they also offer "WineGlamping", space age looking yurts for M$6700 (weekends only).
