Understand[edit]
Main St in Lincoln
Lincoln New Hampshire was established in 1782.  The landscape was filled with rivers, mountains, and forests, which made it perfect for logging.  Soon after, sawmills began to appear throughout the town and were powered by the rivers.  The population was extremely low in this town for about one hundred years until trains began bringing tourists to Lincoln to view the mountains.  Although the population has not grown tremendously, Lincoln attracts thousands of tourists each year.
