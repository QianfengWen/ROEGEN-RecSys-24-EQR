Abergavenny (Welsh: Y Fenni) is a town of 12,500 people (2011) in Monmouthshire in southeast Wales.

Abergavenny, Monmouthshire

Understand[edit]
A thriving town, Abergavenny prides itself as a gateway to South Wales and the eastern gateway to the Brecon Beacons National Park where you can enjoy a relaxing short break or longer holiday amidst beautiful countryside.  The town itself nestles within the beautiful Usk Valley at the point where the river emerges from amongst the mountains to flow through lowland Monmouthshire.  The mass of the Black Mountains and their highly individual outliers of Sugar Loaf and Skirrid (Welsh: Ysgyryd Fawr) form a spectacular northern backdrop to the town. Along with Blorenge to the south, the opportunities for walkers are hugely varied.

51.8199-3.017791 Abergavenny Castle. Castle 24 hr, Museum Th-Tu 11:00-16:00. The castle dates back to 1087; it was damaged in the 1404 Glyndŵr rebellion and abandoned. Just to be on the safe side, in 1645 Charles I had the remains "slighted" - demolished beyond further use. Later visitors found the ruins picturesque and in 1819 a hunting lodge was built within, in the style of a miniature "keep". This now contains the museum. Free.   (updated Mar 2022)
