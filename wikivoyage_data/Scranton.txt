Scranton skyline
Scranton is a city in northeastern Pennsylvania. It is near Wilkes-Barre, and is the seventh most populous city in the state. Today, it is perhaps best known as the setting of the hit TV show "The Office" and the birthplace of Joe Biden, the 46th President of the United States.


Understand[edit]
The city grew vigorously in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as a capital of coal mining and railroads, which were vital to the expanding industry in this part of the country. Prosperity subsided and economic distress followed for decades. Property values have since increased as Scranton is gaining employers and investment. From 2005 to 2013, Scranton entered American popular culture as the setting for the U.S. version of the TV series The Office (though only the opening credits were shot in the city).

Get around[edit]
Map of Scranton
By bicycle[edit]
The Electric City is a growing biker/commuter city.  Gas prices going up help many to decide alternative means of getting to work, restaurants, and shopping.  While Scranton does not provide cyclists with bike lanes popular to Philadelphia, New York City, and other big cities, some groups try to bring biker awareness and safety to light.  The last Friday of every month, 6PM North Washington side of the courthouse, is where you can find bikers of all sorts gathering to participate in Critical Mass.  It is a gathering of cyclists of sorts to participate in a huge group ride.  The purpose of Critical Mass is to bring awareness of bicyclists to the public.  Some forms Critical Mass have been used to protest certain events, be it political, social, and so on. Careful, you may see the car, but they don't always see you.

By car[edit]
Virtually all transportation throughout the city is by car. North Main Avenue and the North Scranton Expressway travel north to the Providence section and to the shopping centers of Dickson City. Green Ridge Street and the Central Scranton expressway travel east to the large suburb of Dunmore and I-81. Pittston and Cedar Avenues are the main routes through "South Side" to the Minooka section and beyond to the attractions of Montage Mountain. South Main Avenue and Keyser Avenue are likewise the main routes through "West Side".
Scranton Parking operates four daily parking garages in the city. The garages are Casey Garage (corner of Lackawanna Ave. & Adams Ave.), Linden Street Garage (corner of Linden St. & N. Washington St.), Medallion Garage (100 Block of Adams Ave.), and the Electric City Garage (with entrances on Spruce St. & Penn Ave.). Rates are $1.75/1st hour and about $0.75/hr afterwards. They're open daily from 7AM-11PM, with Linden St. open 7AM-2AM on Saturdays.
Private taxicabs such as Posten and McCarthy service the area as well. They are hired by telephone through central dispatch and cannot be hailed on the street as in larger cities.

On foot[edit]
Walking is also safe and practical in "Central City" (or "Central Scranton"/"Downtown Scranton"). This area of two dozen square blocks (approximately bound by Lackawanna Ave. and Jefferson, Vine, and Mifflin Sts.) contains a great deal of what Scranton has to offer tourists, so it may be best to just park at one of many garages for a reasonable day-long fee.

By bus[edit]
County of Lackawanna Transit System (COLTS) also operates public buses throughout all parts of the city and a few Lackawanna County extremities. Rates are $1.25/ride, $11/10 rides (adult), $10/10 rides (student), or $40/31 day unlimited pass. Travel times are a little more than twice what it would take driving the same route. The system typically operates from 7AM-7PM, check the website for exact schedule. COLTS does not operate on Sundays or Holidays.
