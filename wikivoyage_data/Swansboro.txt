Historic downtown Swansboro
Swansboro, sometimes called the "Friendly City by the Sea", is a town of 3,700 people (as of 2020) in Onslow County, North Carolina, between the White Oak River and the Intracoastal Waterway. The town was incorporated in 1783, and named for Samuel Swann, a former Speaker in the North Carolina legislature. It's on the western border of the popular Crystal Coast tourist region, and is often considered to be unofficially part of the region. The town's main attractions are its beautiful waterfront views and its quaint downtown, filled with boutiques, shops and delicious restaurants.

On July 4th, be sure to watch the fireworks show over the river at 9PM, with popcorn and funnel cakes to munch, and entertainment before dusk.
The Mullet Festival, held during the second weekend in October, began as a celebratory event when the bridge over the White Oak River was completed in 1954. Since that year, Swansboro has had an annual celebration with parades, a street carnival, live entertainment, arts and crafts, and lots of seafood, with an emphasis on mullet: grilled, fried, smoked and stewed!
The Friendly City Speckled Trout Tournament is held in early November at Casper's Marina; fishermen are encouraged to weigh their trout alive and release them back into the water.
On Thanksgiving weekend, pull your car up to the riverfront early to watch the Christmas flotilla, as a parade of boats decorated in lights pulls into the harbor after dark.
