History[edit]
The 1860s were a rich period for Vichy, thanks to the stays of Napoleon III which allowed the creation of parks, thermal roads and the arrival of the railway. The tourist activity reached a national notoriety until the beginnings of the First World War then in the interwar period. It is also known for having been the seat of government of Marshal Philippe Pétain from 1940 to 1944.
After decolonization, the projects carried out by the last four mayors (Pierre Coulon from 1950 to 1967, then Jacques Lacarin until 1989, Claude Malhuret from 1989 to 2017 and Frédéric Aguilera since 2017) made it possible to modernize the city, in value from the city centre to the banks of Allier.

By car[edit]
The city has long been isolated from the main roads. The nearest motorway, the A719, is over 3 miles from the city centre.
Zones 30 cover an acceptable perimeter in the city centre, between rue de Paris, rue Georges-Clemenceau and avenue Doumer, as well as on certain streets outside the city centre (main street and not mesh streets!) There are only two meeting areas, where pedestrians have priority over other users: on an access to a car park in the east of the city near the urban boulevard (since 2013) and on the back alley of the boulevard du Maréchal-de-Lattre-de-Tassigny (since 2014).
Not all places in the municipality are always correctly marked. Hotel signage is shown in yellow on dark brown signs and notable restaurants in white on the same signs.

Parking[edit]
A paid parking zone - there is no entry or exit sign for a paid parking zone (except on Quai d'Allier) - covers the city centre, from the Parc des Sources to Vieux Vichy and the SNCF train station: places are paid from Monday to Saturday from 09:00 to 12:00 and from 14:00 to 18:00 (free on Sundays and public holidays), within the limit of 3 or 7 hours depending on the zone. The first twenty minutes have been free since 2018 in these areas.
Parking is prohibited in line with the traffic signs on the side indicated and by two continuous yellow lines drawn on the ground (non-regulatory marking).
There are four underground paid car parks (the number of spaces available is displayed at four city entrances. Look for signs directing you to them.

Get around[edit]
Map of Vichy
Urban transport[edit]
 MobiVie public transit. M-Sa 18:20-20:00; Sundays and holidays: 10:00-12:00 and  14:00-  19:10. Urban transport network serving Vichy and five towns in the agglomeration (Abrest, Bellerive-sur-Allier, Creuzier-le-Vieux, Cusset and Hauterive). €1.25 per trip (if bought in a bus) €3.4 per 24  hr - depending on buses and stops..   (updated Sep 2019)
The bus network is made up of eight lines. Line A goes from the Ailes district to the city centre, to the train station and to Cusset with a bus every 20 minutes (and is operated by electric buses). Lines B and C serve the city centre, the station and the hospital, with a bus every twenty minutes; line B continues to Bellerive-sur-Allier and line C to Cusset or the aquatic stadium. Line D, north-south, serves the market and the media library. Line E goes around the parks, but with irregular frequency. Only lines A and B run on Sundays and public holidays.
The information available to travellers is provided on almost all the stops. It is not always kept up to date: at certain stops, it is partially obsolete, or even non-existent (responsibility for the agglomeration).

By bike[edit]
Cyclists are particularly vulnerable. If you cycle in Vichy, you must exercise extreme vigilance. There are, however, some cycling facilities, in particular along the Esplanade du Lac d'Allier, on the Quai d'Allier, and the paths along the River Allier on the Napoléon-III and Kennedy parks, or along the 'Allée des Ailes or on the Pont de l'Europe.
The department of Allier has marked out cycle routes (towards Cusset, Lapalisse, Saint-Pourçain-sur-Sioule, Randan by SNCF bridge over the Allier or by the left bank). Partly using busy lanes, it is the cyclists' responsibility to be careful.
In this city, zones 30 have the major drawback, on one-way roads, of being closed to reverse traffic, for obscure safety reasons (with the one and only exception of avenue de Gramont between boulevard Gambetta and rue de la Gare). A simple forbidden direction in zone 30 does not allow you to go up a street and requires you to take a detour.
A bicycle rental service is available in summer:
