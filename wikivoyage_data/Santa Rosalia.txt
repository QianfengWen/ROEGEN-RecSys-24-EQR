Santa Rosalía is a city of about 14,000 people (2015) on the Gulf of California coast of the Baja California Peninsula. It's not much of a tourist town though it has old school charm and is known for its French influenced architecture. It sees few snowbirds. The town is one of Mexico's designated Pueblos Mágicos.


Understand[edit]
Harbor
Santa Rosalía has French influence, particularly in its architecture. The French company El Boleo founded the town in 1884 and exploited copper mines there until they closed in 1954. They built houses and installed the metallic Iglesia de Santa Bárbara, which was designed by Gustave Eiffel.

Climate[edit]
The town is the northernmost (and thus closest to the US border) year-round warm locale on the main peninsular highway.

Map of Santa Rosalia
The historic centro is compact and easily walkable but the town stretches along the shores of the Sea of Cortez and some local sites are a long distance north of centro. You'll want to use a taxi to reach those places. Santa Rosalia borders the massive El Vizcaíno Biosphere Reserve and the best way to explore points of interest within the protected natural areas is by using a local tour service (particularly to reach the archaelogical sites of Sierra San Francisco), or take a bus to Guerrero Negro to visit the whale sanctuaries.

27.3371-112.26861 Iglesia de Santa Bárbara, Álvaro Obregón 20, Centro. A prefabricated iron church that was designed by Alexandre-Gustave Eiffel in 1884, and built in 1887. It was shown at the 1889 Exposition Universelle of Paris, then acquired by the Boleo Mining Company who installed it in Santa Rosalía in late 1897.   (updated Jan 2018)
Unlike many other mining sites, the industrial facilities which are in the middle of the town, were never dismantled. Old locomotives, mining equipment and machinery are visible everywhere. The main mining company offices (La dirección) have been converted into an industrial museum.
Mesa France is a neighbourhood where you can appreciate the French colonial architectural style. The French mining technicians and officials of the company lived here.
