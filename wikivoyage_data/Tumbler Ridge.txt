Tumbler Ridge is a small town in the Peace River region of Northern British Columbia. The area is part of the UNESCO Global Geoparks Network with dinosaur tracks, waterfalls, interesting rock formations, hiking and many other year-round outdoor activities. 


Understand[edit]
The town of Tumbler Ridge was created to provide housing for workers at nearby coal mines in 1981 and the first residents arrived in 1983. It has a now home to about 2000 people (2016). 
In 2014, both operating coal mines were effectively closed. Economic diversification has occurred with oil and gas exploration, forestry, and recreational tourism. 

History[edit]
Archaeological evidence show a human presence dating back 3,000 years. The nomadic Sekani, followed by the Dunneza and then the Cree, periodically lived in temporary settlements around the future municipality. Exploratory and surveying expeditions were conducted from 1914 to 1923. One of the surveyors coined the name "Tumbler Ridge", referring to the mountains northwest of the future town. Permanent settlers were squatters, five families by 1920, who maintained trap lines. In the 1950s and 1960s, oil and natural gas exploration and logging was conducted through the area, and 15 significant coal deposits were discovered. Coal prices rose after the 1973 oil crisis leading to 40 government studies examining the viability of accessing the coal, given the 1,130 km (700 mi) to the nearest port and the mountainous barrier.
After dinosaur trackways were discovered in 2000, and bones in 2002, the Tumbler Ridge Museum Foundation began excavations and opened the Peace Region Palaeontology Research Centre. Fossils and bones are displayed at both locations. Tours and educational programs related to dinosaur, the trackways, and the wilderness are offered.
