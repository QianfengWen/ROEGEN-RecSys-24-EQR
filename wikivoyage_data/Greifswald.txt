Greifswald is a town of 59,000 people (2020) in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania in Germany. The town sits at the south end of the Bay of Greifswald, and the historic centre on the river Ryck that crosses the city.


Understand[edit]
The market place
Greifswald is a very old town and gained city rights as early as 1240. In 1278, Greifswald became a part of the Hanseatic League and in 1456, the university was founded.
From 1648 to 1815, Greifswald was a part of Sweden's northern German territories. Following the Second World War, the town became a part of the Soviet occupation zone. The town fared rather well during and after the war, but during the Soviet and East German era, the economy and infrastructure declined. Following reunification, huge sums of money have been pumped into the area to help improve the situation and lower the unemployment rates.

Get in[edit]
The easiest way to get to Greifswald is probably by car, but there are other options. Going by air is restricted to season.

By air[edit]
Heringsdorf airport (HDF IATA) on the island of Usedom sees some seasonal service from the likes of Eurowings.
The airport is not connected directly to the railway network, but you can take a bus or cab to the next train station and take the train from there.
Somewhat further away is Rostock-Laage (RLG IATA) airport which mostly serves cruise passengers leaving or arriving at Rostock-Warnemünde. That airport is likewise not connected directly to the railway network, but it sees some service through Intercity buses.
Berlin Brandenburg Airport (BER IATA) sees much more service but is some three hours away by train.

The town centere is small and the streets are narrow, which makes it better to park the car on the outskirts and walk.

All lines, except nr 5, leave from and/or pass the bus station (ZOB, Zentraler Omnibus-Bahnhof) in the western part of the town centre.

By bike[edit]
Being a university town with many narrow streets, Greifswald is considered a "bicycle city", even though that fact is not as well known as it is about places like Erlangen or Münster. If you are in town for more than just a day, consider renting a bike and exploring the (rather flat) surroundings as well as the city by bike. Besides giving you exercise it is often the fastest and most straightforward method of getting around.
