The modern history of Thompson began in 1956 when a major ore body was discovered. The community was founded in 1957 following an agreement with the Government of Manitoba and Inco Limited. Thompson is a planned community and is named after Inco's chairman, John F. Thompson. The population has been estimated as high as 26,000 residents prior to the recession in the 1970s.
Thompson came to be known as "The Hub of the North", as it functions as a centre for politics and commerce in the region. However a decline in population occurred during the following decades, levelling off around 13,000 people.
Its most prominent local industry is the mining, milling, smelting and refining of nickel. Aside from Vale Ltd., Manitoba Hydro, Calm Air, MTS and the provincial government employ the majority of the people in Thompson.
