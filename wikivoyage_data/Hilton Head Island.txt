Harbour Town lighthouse on Hilton Head Island
Hilton Head Island is a city and barrier island in South Carolina, just across the border from Savannah, Georgia. With an approximate population of 40,000, it is on a beautiful, sub-tropical 12-mile (19-km) barrier island. Hilton Head Island is a vacation playland with famous beaches and great golf courses that overlook the Atlantic Ocean.


Understand[edit]
Hilton Head Island was originally occupied by Native Americans, with Europeans first making contact in 1521. In 1663, Captain William Hilton came to the island and named it for himself, "Hilton's Head". The island was later settled, and activity on the island primarily consisted of farming, with the island serving as a base of operations for the Union blockade of the Confederacy. After the war, ex-slaves flocked to the island to work on plantations, with this legacy most prominent in the naming of communities on the island, which are known as plantations (though this naming convention is controversial given the ties the word "plantation" has with slavery). The first resort development occurred in 1956 with the development of Sea Pines Resort, with additional development coming over the following decades. Hilton Head Island remains a popular resort destination, and now boasts several resorts and other tourist accommodation.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
US Route 278 is the only road on and off the island. An interchange with Interstate 95 is along US 278 about 40 minutes west of the island. Between the island and I-95, US 278 intersects with South Carolina Route 170, which provides access to and from Beaufort and Savannah. Traffic onto the island can be particularly heavy on the weekend, when many arrive to and leave the island, so consider arriving and leaving on weekdays if you'd like to avoid the heaviest of traffic.

By plane[edit]
Hilton Head Island is served by two airports.

32.224444-80.69751 Hilton Head Island Airport (HHH  IATA). The only airport on the island. American Airlines operates flights from Charlotte and Atlanta year round. A majority of the airport's operations are still general aviation.   
Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport (SAV IATA) is about an hour away from the island and served by seven airlines. The airport is directly connected to Interstate 95.
Air taxi and air charter companies such as Jetset Charter[dead link] fly a variety of private charter aircraft, such as pistons and turbo props, for small groups and individuals into Hilton Head Island Airport (KHXD). Generally, private jet aircraft must fly into Savannah/Hilton Head Int'l (KSAV).

Get around[edit]
Map of Hilton Head Island
By car[edit]
Once entering the island, US 278 becomes known as the William Hilton Parkway. After traveling about a mile on the island, the road splits in two.
William Hilton Parkway continues as US 278 Business, a surface road around the eastern end of the island. US 278 Business is a four-lane divided highway, but most businesses on the island are along the road, making for a slow, 25- to 30-minute drive to the southern end of the island. US 278 branches off onto the Cross Island Parkway, a grade-separated expressway. While the Cross Island Parkway was previously a toll road, the toll has been removed and you can now drive the entire length of the Parkway for free. The parkway reduces the journey from the split to the south end of the island to five minutes.
US 278 and US 278 Business terminate at the Sea Pines Circle at the south end of the island. From this circle, cars can continue south on Greenwood Drive to enter the gated Sea Pines plantation, or east on Pope Avenue to head towards Coligny Beach, the major public beach on the island.

By bicycle[edit]
Hilton Head is quite cycling-friendly. All main roads and most major roads in the resort plantations have a companion bicycle path, and there are a few miles of paths that cut their own trail away from the roads. Although not lit for night riding, they are the perfect way to traverse the island during the day time hours. Bicycle rental stores are plentiful, although they may be expensive. Some golf courses may open up their cart paths to bicycles during non-playing hours (in the morning and at night), but other than this it is generally not a good idea to stray off the paths.

By bus[edit]
The Breeze Trolley is a public transportation service open seasonally around summertime. It operates two routes in the central part of the island, and it is free for all passengers. The trolleys arrive every 30 minutes.
