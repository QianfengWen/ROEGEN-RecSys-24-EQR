Understand[edit]

Shediac is a French-Acadian community about a 15-minute drive from Moncton. A sort of resort town, Shediac boasts many public and private beaches, quaint bed and breakfasts, and ok food!  It is quite active during the summer months and not so much the rest of the year as it is a tourist community.

History[edit]
Hundreds of years ago, the Mi'kmaq encampment of "Es-ed-ei-ik" was one of the major camps in southeast New Brunswick. The Mi'kmaq word "Es-ed-ei-ik" which means "running far in" (in reference to the tide, which has a long range over the shallow, sandy beaches) eventually transformed into Gédaique.
Acadians first arrived at Shediac in 1751 as a result of the Acadian Exodus from peninsular Nova Scotia. During the French and Indian War, French officer Charles Deschamps de Boishebert made his headquarters at both Shediac and Cocagne, New Brunswick. In the autumn of 1755, Boishebert established himself on the south shore of Cocagne Bay, a place known as Boishebert's Camp. The following year, Boishebert moved to Miramichi, New Brunswick, specifically to Beaubears Island. After the war, Acadians returned to the region in 1767.
Today many Francophone residents use the spelling Shédiac; however, the town's name upon its incorporation did not feature an accented "e", and correspondingly the official geographic name for the community is Shediac.

See[edit]
Pointe-du-Chene Wharf, From your seat in one of the restaurants, gaze into the ocean, take a look at the many boats who call the wharf home. Or, do as the locals often do and take a jump off the pier to cool off after a warm day in the sun.
46.218696-64.5549861 The World's Largest Lobster (at the western entrance to the town). A sculpture called "The World's Largest Lobster". The statue is 11 metres long and 5 metres tall, weighing 90 tonnes. It isn't the largest -- that's in Qianjiang, Hubei, China -- but it would need 110,000 sticks of butter (melted) to serve properly.   (updated Jun 2022)
