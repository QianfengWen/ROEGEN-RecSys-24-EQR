Not to be confused with Carbost near Portree on the road to Dunvegan .

Carbost (Gaelic: Càrrabost) is a small village straggling along the shore of Loch Harport in Skye, in the Scottish Inner Hebrides. The main reason to come here is the Talisker Distillery. You also have to pass this way to reach the settlements of Fernilea, Portnalong, Fiscavaig, and the original Talisker over on the west coast. 
Càrrabost here and in other places of that name means woodland farm.

57.3028-6.35631 Talisker Distillery, Carbost IV47 8SR, ☏ +44 1478 614308. Nov-Feb daily 10:30AM-4:30PM, Mar-Oct daily 10AM-5PM. Founded 1830 but completely rebuilt after a fire in 1960, the distiilery (now part of Diageo) produces a hefty, aromatic and distinctly peaty malt whisky similar to those from Islay. Tour reservations recommended in summer. Standard tour (1 hour) £22.   (updated Jun 2024)
57.3225-6.40432 Cnoc Glas Heila is a stubby knoll, a viewpoint easily reached from the lane off B8009 towards Portnalong.
57.3347-6.43013 Dun Ardtreck is a well-preserved Iron Age D-broch, a semi-circular fortified dwelling with its open side along a sea cliff. It looks to have been built around 115 BC but swiftly attacked and torched, then re-occupied around 150 AD. In spite of the name it's an easy hike from Portnalong at the end of B8009.
57.3181-6.43824 Fiskavaig is a straggling crofting settlement. West side of the little bay, you can still see the abandoned cottages of farm workers, recorded in 1877 as "one storey & have a wretched appearance." The name is Norse, fiskr fish, vagr bay. A Pictish engraved stone found on the beach is now in the National Museum in Edinburgh. An Iron Age shelter Uamh an Eich Bhric (cave of the speckled horse) is steadily being washed away by the sea.
57.2833-6.455 Talisker , the former settlement for which the distillery is named, is 5 miles east of Carbost but you can drive to within half a mile on Carbost Hill Road. From the lane end it's a simple enough walk but better at low tide when you can get onto the beach. There's also a longer hike from the lane at Fiscavaig. Talisker House here is private, you can't visit but Dr Johnson and Boswell did so in 1773. Boswell moaned: "Talisker is the place beyond all that I have seen, from which the gay and the jovial seem utterly excluded; and where the hermit might expect to grow old in meditation, without possibility of disturbance or interruption. It is situated very near the sea, but upon a coast where no vessel lands but when it is driven by a tempest on the rocks." Clan Macleod may have agreed, as in the 1820s three dozen of them emigrated to Tasmania. Hugh MacAskill then took over the estate, evicted the remaining residents, and established the distillery on its present site in Carbost.
57.3604-6.42586 Dun Beag is yet another substantial broch, a drystone tower across the bay from Dun Ardtreck so you pass it on the road to Dunvegan. Coins as late as George III were found in it so it may have been occupied into the 18th century, at least as a shepherd's bothy.
