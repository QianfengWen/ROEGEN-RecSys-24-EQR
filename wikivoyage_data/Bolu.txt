Bolu is a city in the Western Karadeniz (Black Sea) region of Turkey, with a population of 184,682 in 2021. It's 260 km east of Istanbul and 190 km northwest of Ankara so it might make a stopover. The town itself has a few antiquities but is otherwise modern and humdrum, but around it are forested mountains dotted by lakes, ski resorts, and villages that have preserved their traditional architecture.


Understand[edit]
Bolu is astride the main land route between Istanbul and Ankara, so it's long been a stopover plus a centre of civilisation in its own right. The route is formed by the valley of the great North Anatolian Fault, still active with major earthquakes every few decades, so the constructions of Hittites, Bithynians and early Romans have been shaken to bits. The town became known as Claudiopolis after the Roman Emperor Claudius, and in 111 AD was the birthplace of Antonius, gay lover of Hadrian. (He died in mysterious circumstances aged 19, so Hadrian had him deified.) After the Romans' successors the Byzantines were defeated in 1071 it was settled by Turkic tribes from the east who simply called it "polis", the town, which morphed into Bolu. It fell to the Ottomans in 1325 and most of the town's antiquities reflect their 600-year realm.
Bolu stands at 742 m / 2434 ft altitude and the mountains draw the clouds and rain. Summer highs are around 28°C and winter lows -2°C.

You need wheels for out-of-town sights, and frankly you'd only bother if driving that way, they're hardly worth a special trip.

40.73333331.6094442 Beyazıt Mosque, Büyük Cami Sk. This was first built in 1382 AD by "Yıldırım" Bayezid (meaning "thunderbolt" for the way he rushed impetuously into battle, eventually at the cost of his life). Its medresa and library disappeared then the wooden mosque burned down in 1891. It was rebuilt in stone in 1899 with a dome and twin minarets, and restored after earthquake damage in 1944 and 1999.  (updated Jan 2024)
Taşhan is a two-storey traditional market hall on the west flank of Beyazıt Mosque. It was built in 1804 AD and has shops and cafes in the arcades around its courtyard.
Saraçhane Mosque faces the museum and Beyazıt Mosque across the main square. It was built by the renowned Mimar Sinan in the 16th century and rebuilt in 1750 AD.
Kadi Mosque 100 m west of Saraçhane Mosque is from the 16th century.
Yeşil Mosque 100 m north of main square is floodlit green at night just to remind you what yeşil means in Turkish.
