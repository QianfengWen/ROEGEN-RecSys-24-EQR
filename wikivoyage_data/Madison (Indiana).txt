By phone[edit]
Most telephone numbers in Madison consist of +1 812 plus a seven-digit number, but the Southern Indiana region is now served by an overlay complex of two area codes, with +1 930 being the second. A local or in-state telephone call now requires all 10 digits of the local number be dialed (omitting just the leading +1 from a local landline call).
Signage on many established businesses may still display the original seven-digit numbers; dial 812 before these if no area code is indicated.
