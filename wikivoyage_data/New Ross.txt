New Ross is a town in County Wexford. In Gaelic its name is Ross mhic threoin..which means " Ross on the woods", as Ross at the time of founding was a tiny village in the woods (threoin).River Barrow, which forms the county boundary. The town was an important port in medieval times, until shipping outgrew the river; a battle of the 1798 rebellion was fought here. There was much emigration from New Ross in the famine years, including by the ancestors of US President John F Kennedy. Nevertheless the town grew to straddle the river, with its western edge in County Kilkenny, and in 2016 its population was 8040.

That barque built 1845 carried many thousands away to North America in the famine years.
