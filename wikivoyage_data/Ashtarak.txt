Ashtarak is a small city in Central Armenia 20 km northwest of Yerevan. It features the best-preserved Armenian church of the 7th century, Karmravor.


Understand[edit]
View of Mt. Aragats from Ashtarak
Ashtarak is located at the intersection of roads leading to Gyumri and Yerevan. Due to such a convenient location the settlement appeared here long time ago. However, it didn't play any significant role until the second half of the twentieth century, when Ashtarak acquired the status of a city and started to host Institute of physics of Armenian Academy of Sciences. The name of the city means "a tower" in Armenian.
Ashtarak does not look like the regional center nowadays: it's a sleepy town, where it's easier to meet a chicken rather than a car. A trip here is a good opportunity to escape a rush of Yerevan for a few hours.

Karmravor Church
40.299844.36551 Karmravor Church (Surb Astvatsatsin), 30 Abovyan str. (from the river, take the Karmravor road across the Ashtarak Bridge and follow the road up the hill until it reaches the walled church to the right; there is a large cemetery further east). The church was built in the mid-7th century and has been preserved without significant alterations. It features a single reddish clay tile domed roof (hence the name Tsiranavor, which means "reddish"). There are ancient khachkars around the church, and a stone gates with preserved engravings. It is a small church but quite interesting.   (updated Oct 2015)
40.298144.36922 Surb Sarkis Church (Saint Sarkis Church of Ashtarak), St. Sargis str. (at a promontory overlooking the Kasagh River Gorge). S. Sarkis was built in the 19th century supposedly upon older foundations. It looks to be a new church because of extensive restoration work, but a small number of the older original stones carved with decorative relief and inscriptions (replaced with new stone and now sitting next to the foundation of the building) show its age to be much older. It offers a fine view to the three churches of Tsiranavor, Spitakavor, and Karmravor.   (updated Oct 2015)
40.301144.36093 Surb Mariné Church (Saint Marianeh Church), Smbat Shahaziz str. (more central to the town). S. Mariane was built in 1271 or according to some sources 1281. It has a beautiful umbrella dome that rests above.   (updated Oct 2015)
40.2984544.368334 Ashtarak Bridge (directly below the church of S. Sarkis, at the point where the Karmravor road crosses the Kasagh River). The reddish stone arch bridge was built in 1664 as part of the old road to Yerevan. It features two equal sized smaller pointed arches on either side of a larger central pointed arch.

 Kasagh River Gorge Monuments. (updated Oct 2015)
40.2976844.366645 Spitakavor Church (along the Kasagh River, at the top of the gorge). Spitakavor meaning "whitish" is a triple-aisled basilica built in the 5th-6th centuries (most likely between 540-557). The front façade is whitewashed and has a lengthy inscription. Walls remain but the roof has since collapsed. Note: Some confusion about the name of the churches of Spitakavor and Tsiranavor has seemed to have occurred due to the misplacement of the Russian markers located inside the two structures. The ruins aren't impressive: if you aren't an expert, you can skip it.   (updated Oct 2015)
40.2982244.366126 Tsiranavor Church (down the street south two houses and to the left where it dead-ends). Tsiranavor meaning "apricotish" is a small church built between the 13th to 14th centuries. Its roof has since collapsed, but walls remain. It also doesn't look very appealing and can be skipped.   (updated Oct 2015)

Go next[edit]
Echmiadzin – There are bus services leaving from the bus station. The journey only takes ½ hr.
Oshakan Village – A little down the river. Here the creator of the Armenian alphabet, Mesrob Mashtots, is buried in the village church.
Mughni – Just north along the river (and highway), with an interesting church where alternating colors of stone form black and red bands around the cupola.
Hovhannavank Monastery – Further north in Ohanavan village. This restored monastery is perched atop the cliffs and has a great view of Mt. Ara.
Saghmosavank Monastery – Just east of Artashavan village shares the same great views of the gorge and Mt. Ara. You can hike from one to the other in the gorge. Great architecture, carvings, details.
Aparan – Much further north is this town, whose inhabitants are the butt of jokes which pin them as not the brightest folk. The very ancient, black Kasagh basilica church, just a few meters from the main highway is worth dropping into on your way to Lori Marz.
