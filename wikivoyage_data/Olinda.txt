The street Rua Prudente de Morais in Olinda
Olinda is a city in the northeastern Brazilian state of Pernambuco. It hosts one of Brazil's most famous carnivals and is listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO due to its 16th and 17th century buildings. Many bars, restaurants, artist and craftspeople studios add charm to the old-town setting.


Understand[edit]
Olinda was founded in 1537 by the Portuguese Duarte Coelho Pereira. It owed its rapid rise to the sugarcane plantations around its area. From the 16th century onward, religious missions built many churches and convents. The city was, however, pillaged and burnt down by the Dutch in 1631. One of the few surviving buildings is the Church of São João. The Portuguese returned in 1654. Most of the buildings at Olinda date from the 18th century.

In poetry

Olinda is all for the eyes
it's not tangible, it's all desire.
No one says, "That's where I live."
They just say, "That's where I see."

-- Celebrated Brazilian poet Carlos Pena Filho,
in his poem Olinda.


Olinda's beautiful scenery and architecture make for a pleasant sightseeing all around. Colonial architecture, belvederes and the blue sea paint a relaxed environment that is second to none among Brazilian traditional cities.

 Angola Mae Capoeira School, Rua Ilma Cunha 243. 
Carnaval[edit]
Quite different from those of Rio and Salvador this is a lively street party, where blocos parade accompanied by frevo and maracatu music. There is a certain activity during the weeks before (and some after), but the party itself explodes on the official dates, from Friday evening until Wednesday morning. Its most famous representative are the giant dolls carried on the shoulders of the people. The parties are non-stop, 24 hours, but the bulk of the crowd fills the streets daytime. When looking for accommodation, bear in mind that the most central streets get very noisy.

Beaches[edit]
The beach in Olinda proper is polluted. Local buses can take you north to Pau Amarelo and Maria Farinha.

Buy[edit]
Local crafts and artwork. Be wary of making your purchases in or near Alto da Sé, as prices there tend to be inflated due to the constant flow of tourists. The Mercado da Ribeira houses a variety of shops.
Musical instruments, such as those used in maracatu and forró.
Eat[edit]
Sargação, near Praça do Carmo near the beachfront, serves sandwiches and burgers until the late night hours.

Sleep[edit]
Olinda has a wide range of options when it comes to lodging. Reservations could be wise in January and February. During carnival prices triple (literally!) and you will have to pay for the five nights from Friday to Wednesday no matter what. Private rooms (R$ 500-1000/5 nights) and apartments/houses (R$ 800 and up) are mostly cheaper, but standards vary greatly, and they are hard to book ahead. If you arrive on Thursday, there is still time.
