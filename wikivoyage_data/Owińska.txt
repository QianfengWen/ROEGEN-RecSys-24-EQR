The quickest way to get here is to use train leaving the station in Poznan 8-10 times daily, heading to Wągrowiec or Golancz. All connections are now served by modern, air-conditioned diesel units. The travel time is 20-25 minutes, but given the traffic situation in Poznan it's the best solution.

Lines going to Owinska are: 310 and 312; or you can use Poznan Fast Tram line to stop "Al. Solidarnosci" are there catch Transkom bus number 313, bus this line runs only 8 times daily, compared to about 40 times – when talking about 310 and 312. Travel time from Srodka station: about 30 minutes. More information: on the Transkom website.
Another alternative are PKS buses, leaving from the main bus station in the centre of Poznan – most buses going to Wagrowiec, Skoki, Nakło or Oborniki/Rogozno/Chodzież/Piła through Murowana Goślina. Travel time (in normal traffic): about 40 minutes.

Get around[edit]
Owinska is a small village, so it's navigable on foot.

See[edit]
Despite Owinska is a small village, it has several interesting sights:

Post-convent church of Cistercian nuns, nowadays a parish church of St. John the Baptist. From the first half of 18th century. It's been erected according to the project  by Pompeo Ferrar, but the previous romanesque and gothic walls have been used as well. Rich baroque interiors, very precious wooden stalls, carved rokoko confessionals and wall-paintings done by a Poznan master from Franciscan order: Adam Swach (who originally had come from southern Bohemia). It's worth to pay attention to the main altar with six carved columns and the statue of Our Lady on the seventh one.
The cistercian Convent, erected according to the project by George Cattenazzi. Nearby – in the park next to Warta flow, 500-year-old oak tree (circumference 770 cm). Nowadays the convent places a school for blind children.
The classicistic palace – the work of the famous Berlin architect Friedrich Schinkel, next to it – an English Park (16 hectares) located in the place of previous oak forest with the wet alder-tree part, established in the first years of 19th century by Paul Lenne, the creator of gardens in Potsdam
