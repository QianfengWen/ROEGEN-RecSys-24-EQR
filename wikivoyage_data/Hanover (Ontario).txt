Hanover is a town of about 7,700 people (2016) in Southwestern Ontario, many of them descendents of German settlers. The one-time "Furniture Capital of Canada" continues to be a manufacturing centre. 


Understand[edit]

Hanover is southern Grey County, west of Durham and east of Walkerton on Grey/Bruce Road 4. Hanover marks the border between Grey County and Bruce County.

History[edit]
In 1849, pioneer Abraham Buck and his family established a farm and tavern on the Saugeen River in the region of modern-day Hanover. Many settlers, most German, arrived to the area; a townsite was laid out by 1855. It was earlier called Buck's Crossing and then Adamstown, but was renamed Hanover. Records from 1867 indicate a gristmill, sawmill and carding mill, a foundry and a cabinet factory. Knechtel Furniture Company and other furniture companies opened in the 1800s, including Sklar-Peppler. 
The railway arrived in about 1880 a benefit to factories who now had a way to ship their goods across Canada. By the 1920s, Hanover was known as the Furniture Capital of the country. The town survived the Depression and flourished after the Second World War manufacturing furniture, textiles, flour, processed food and kitchen cabinets. Manufacturing declined seriously between 1970 and 2000.
