Oodnadatta is a small town in the South Australian Outback.


Get in[edit]
Oodnadatta is situated around 200 km from the Stuart Highway along the Oodnadatta Track both via Coober Pedy and Marla.  The track is unpaved, but the road to Oodnadatta is usually traversable by 2WD vehicle if you're coming from the western end although that isn't the case if you're coming via Marree.

Get around[edit]
The town is small enough to walk around.  Parking is no problem either.

The abandoned station at Oodnadatta
-27.546114135.4477151 The Railway Tjukurpa Museum. 9AM-5PM daily. The Ghan railway line used to pass through and stop in Oodnadatta. The railway line now bypasses the town but the old station is largely preserved and is a museum. The old rail line runs (for the most part) way out to the desert it is advised not to stray too far. It's pretty overgrown and scrubby, so it's not a pleasant walk either. (updated Sep 2021)
The Oodnadatta Track is an unsealed 620 km (390 mi) track between Marree and Marla via Oodnadatta in South Australia. It passes the southern lake of the Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre National Park. Take note that most of the lakes around are mere dry saltbeds. The maintained roads rarely go close enough for a good view, and the roads that do approach the lakes have a risk of getting bogged.
