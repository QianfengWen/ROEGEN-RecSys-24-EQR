Jardin de Salvatierra and Parroquia de Nuestra  Señora de la Luz
Salvatierra is an enchanting colonial town in Guanajuato, Mexico. The town has a fascinating history and a number of beautiful old churches in the historic Centro. Salvatierra is one of Mexico's designated Pueblos Mágicos.


Understand[edit]
Puente de Batanes, historic site of a revolution battle
Salvatierra is a small city with a population of about 35,000 (2020). The area was originally settled by the Chichimeca, who were then conquered by the Purhepecha. The Spanish conquistadors moved into the area around 1535 with the Franciscan missionaries in tow. A hacienda was established using indigenous slave labor. Unfortunately for the indigenous people, the Spanish shared smallpox with the locals, wiping out most of the indigenous population. 
The town itself was established in 1644 as San Andrés de Salvatierra. Two years later, it was decreed to be a city (the first in the state of Guanajuato). 
Salvatierra was the site of the Batalla del Puente de Batanes (Battle of Batanes Bridge) during the Mexican War of Independence in 1813. The Rayon brothers were leading a revolutionary army unit charged with holding the bridge against royalist troops under Agustin Iturbide. Cowardice ultimately won the battle as Rayon's men abandoned their posts, fleeing in fear, letting the royalists take not only the bridge, but the city of Salvatierra.

See[edit]
20.216413-100.882211 Jardin de Salvatierra (Zocalo), Francisco Madero 413, Centro. Beautifully landscaped main town square with towering boxwood hedges, brick walking paths, frequent benches, fountains, statues, and a central bandstand. The town's main church and the city hall (Presidencia Municipal) are here as well as many places to buy fresh ice cream (nieves). 
20.216862-100.8814252 Parroquia de Nuestra Señora de la Luz, Benito Juarez 410. Magnificently opulent colonial era baroque church with a churrigueresque facade dominated by two enormous bell towers and a large courtyard filled with sculptures, gardens, and arched patios. The interior is full of spectacular religious art with a number of 18th and 19th century oil paintings. The church was designed by Manuel Tolsa and Francisco Eduardo Tresguerras. 
20.214363-100.8812053 Museo de la Ciudad Salvatierra (Salvatierra City Museum), Benito Juarez 204, Centro. Tu-Sa 10:00-14:00 and 17:00-20:00, Su 10:00-14:00, closed M. Small regional museum with cultural and historical exhibits. Lots of antique objects and old photos, maps, and documents. 
20.227329-100.8766244 Hacienda San Jose del Carmen. This 16th century hacienda is the oldest in the state of Guanajuato, and locals say it can be a spine-chilling place to visit because it's haunted by the spirits of long-dead inhabitants, some soldiers and friars, but most the indigenous locals who were enslaved under the colonial economiendo system that permitted slaves to be held by conquering Spaniards. Visitors report seeing ghosts in the furniture, or a military man (sometimes with a train, that somehow appears inside the hacienda itself). Most agree the place would scare the bejeebers out of most anyone because it feels gloomy with dark, mildewed walls, immense heavy doors, and a labyrinth of rooms and passages. 
20.208432-100.8665785 Puente de Batanes. Historic bridge, built by Carmelite missionaries in 1652. Site of a battle in 1813 during the Mexican War of Independence. 
20.219333-100.8838096 Templo de San Francisco (St Francis Church), Calle J.Ma. Morelos Antigua 711, Centro. Historic colonial-era church with clean neo-classical architecture and a bright interior that feels more European than Mexican. The church has an interior courtyard garden with statues and fountains. Tranquil and beautiful church. (updated Dec 2023)
20.208228-100.8821237 Parroquia y Convento de Capuchines, Miguel Hidalgo 202. Who doesn't want to party with nuns? Well, I don't know about the party, but you could pray in their church with them. This is an active convent and you might well see the nuns at mass. If you're just there for the sightseeing, you'll admire the stone construction and the brutal appearance that looks more like a medieval fortress than a typical church. Behind the stone walls is an absolutely beautiful church that's bright with an elaborate main altar and two side chapels. The nuns are rumored to sell obleas, churros, and rompope. Hope it's the kind with lots of rum in it. (updated Dec 2023)

Marquesada - Annual festival held in September. The most anticipated event is a "running of the bulls", similar to the one in Pamplona Spain.

Festival Gastronómico de la Larga y la Quesadilla - Foodies unite in June to taste regional cuisine of Guanajuato when more than 30 local cooks will prepare traditional recipes. The term quesadilla refers to, well, quesadillas, and the term larga is local parlance for a long (hence the name larga) tortilla made over a wood-fired stove on an elongated comal. There are gastronomic workshops to learn regional cooking techniques and there is a contest in which chefs compete to come up with the most delicious modern fusion of a traditional food, as judged by a professional panel.

Eat[edit]
The town is known for several local delicacies, including sweets made with locally grown guava and peanuts. Mexican ice creams are usually higher quality than many foreigners are accustomed to. They are fresher, made with pure, natural ingredients without the emulsifiers, carrageenen and other additives that make mass-market commercial ice creams feel gummy or fake. Several towns are known for their outrageously innovative flavors that might include chiles, unusual fruits, tequila or mezcal, or something completely unexpected. In Salvatierra, the innovative ice creams are sold near the Zocalo (Jardin de Salvatierra).
