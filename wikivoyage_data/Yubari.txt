Yubari (夕張) is a city in Sorachi, Hokkaido.


Understand[edit]
Yubari is a coal mining town famous for melons, a film festival and staggering rates of depopulation. When the mines closed in 1980s, the town shrank from a peak of 120,000 down to about 6,000 and still dropping, a 95% collapse unmatched even in Japan.  With a median age of 65, also the highest in Japan, a turnaround is unlikely anytime soon.

Tourist information site[edit]
The local tourist association has a Japanese-only guide site.

Get in[edit]
The Yubari branch line closed in 2019, leaving the town with no train service.  The closest station is the misleadingly named Shin-Yubari (新夕張), 16 km away, which has services from Sapporo every two hours or so, with connecting buses to town.
Alternatively, take a direct Hokkaido Chuo Bus from Sapporo.

Buy[edit]
Yubari Melon
Yubari is famous for the Yubari Melon, the very best of which are sold in the department stores of Tokyo for north of ¥10,000 each.  In season (May to August), you can buy less perfect specimens for about ¥1000 per melon.
Even outside season, you will not be able to miss one of Japan's most bizarre mascots, the Melon Kuma bear, whose melon-helmeted raging maw adorns all sorts of souvenirs ranging from keychains to underpants.
