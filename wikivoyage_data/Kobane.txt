Kobane, officially known as Ayn al-Arab, is a city in northern Syria. Since 2014 it has been the capital of the self-declared Euphrates Canton.


Understand[edit]
Kobanî took of as a railway town around 1911, the name itself is the word company, referring to the German railway company who built that section of the Konya-Baghdad Railway during that time. With the fall of the Ottoman Empire and subsequent creating a border between Kobanî and the regional center Suruc, in Turkey meant that the area was economically marginalised for a long time.
However, Kobanî became known to the world during the Battle of Kobanî that ranged between September 2014 and February 2015. In a decisive battle the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces defeated ISIS and it proved to be a turning point in the war.

Stay healthy[edit]
The 36.8888738.336561 Kobane hospital is staffed but suffering from a shortage of medical supplies. If you would need serious medical treatment, you are likely to be transported to Damascus because the border crossing with Turkey is closed.

Stay safe[edit]
The city is under protection of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), who act as its de facto police force. Aside from petty theft there is little crime in Kobane, and there has been no terrorism threat since the defeat of ISIL in 2015.
Most rubble has been cleared with the exception of the museum area, where rubble has been deliberately left as a reminder of the Siege of Kobane. Unexploded ordnance is likely to be buried under the rubble, so don't explore these ruins without a guide. When in doubt, ask SDF officers which places are safe to visit.
