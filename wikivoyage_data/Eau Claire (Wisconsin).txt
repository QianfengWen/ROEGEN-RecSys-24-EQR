The bus "terminal" is inside a McDonald's restaurant at the far northwestern outskirts of town, so you will need to hire a taxi from there to your accommodations unless you feel like walking 7 miles to downtown.

Get around[edit]
Like most U.S. cities of its size, all Eau Claire offers by the way of mass transit is a relatively anemic municipal bus [dead link] system.  The buses have bike racks.
The downtown and Water Street areas, and most of the University academic buildings, are located within a river valley. Other parts of the town are located on higher ground. Walking and biking is an option in and between downtown, Water Street, and the University lower campus. However, for most folks (particularly in the winter) travel to other parts of the city will be by auto, taxi, or bus.
