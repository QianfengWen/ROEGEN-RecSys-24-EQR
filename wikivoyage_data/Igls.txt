Igls is an alpine town in the Inn Valley just south of Innsbruck in North Tyrol, Austria.


Understand[edit]

As a town between Innsbruck and the Patscherkofel mountain, Igls is most appreciated as a haven of quietness just south of the regional capital city. It is popular with tourists in summer because of its archaeological heritage and hiking opportunities, and in winter for the ski facilities on the 47.208811.46061 Patscherkofel.

47.23111.409552 Tourist Information Office (Tourismus Information Igls), Hilberstraße 15, ☏ +43 512 37 71 01, igls@innsbruck.info. M-F 08:30-18:00, Sa 08:30-11:30. (updated Sep 2018)
History[edit]
The history of Igls is largely a mystery, although row graves were uncovered within its administrative boundaries, and the nearby Goldbichl hill to the south is an important archaeological site for Tyrol. There is discussion over the name of Igls, which is either said to originate from an 11th century monastery at the Tegernsee, which had possessions in Igls.
Igls developed from a rural village into a summer resort for the Innsbruck upper class in the 19th century, and with it came the construction of the first hotels in the town.
Igls rose to international fame through the Olympic Winter Games of 1964 and 1976 being organized on the slopes of the Patscherkofel. An ice bobsleigh track and Olympic ski run were constructed, and these facilities are still in use for international sports competitions such as the Youth Olympics of 2012.
Igls is a victim of global warming: snowfall is diminishing year after year. Lack of snow has resulted in the closure and decommissioning of the Patscherkofelbahn base station which used to offer skiers a direct ascent onto the Patscherkofel from the heart of Igls. The new base station straddles the mountain a few km to the south-east, and with skiers passing through the town by bus instead of visiting, the future of the tourism sector in Igls is uncertain. Restaurants and night life have reduced their opening hours to compensate for the lack of patrons, but travellers with a keen eye can profit from the reduced demand for accommodation as hotel prices have also dropped significantly.

Orientation[edit]
Igls is a town of ca. 2450 inhabitants, on the heights south of the Inn Valley, and south of regional capital city Innsbruck to which it administratively belonged until 1961. It lies in the shadow of the Patscherkofel mountain, popular in summer for hiking and in winter for skiing.

Igls has an alpine climate, characterized by cold winters and mild but wet summers. In winter, because of its altitude, much of Igls precipitation falls as snow. From November to March, Igls is often covered in a picturesque snow layer ranging from a few cm up to almost 1 m. Snowfall on the Patscherkofel usually lasts until April or May.

See[edit]
The Heiligwasser church
47.21666711.4305561 Heiligwasser Pilgrimage Church (Heiligwasserkirche) (Patscherkofelbahn). The Heiligwasser (literally "Holy Water" in German) pilgrimage is on the slope of the Patscherkofel mountain at an altitude of 1234 m, following a path of 10 chapels of which 5 remain. According to the legend, an angel appeared to 2 peasants searching for lost cattle in 1606, and showed them the way to a spring where they found their cattle. In return, the angel commanded a chapel to be built next to the spring, an undertaking completed by the bishop of Brixen. The site soon became a destination for pilgrims, and in 1661 a church was built to replace the chapel, in which a first religious service was held a year later. Halfway the 18th century, the church was expanded with a side chapel, and buildings around the church were constructed to accommodate the needs of pilgrims, who attribute healing effects to the spring's water. Of particular interest is the churches 3-sided choir with hexagonal choir tower and typical onion shaped roof. The portal is decorated with a fresco from 1743. The ceiling frescoes were added in 1945 by Hans Andre. The Baroque high altar dates from the first half of the 15th century but was stolen in 1971 and replaced with its current copy. Free.

Goldbichl hill, one of the most important archaeological sites in Tyrol
47.215811.41922 Goldbichl. 24/7. One of the most important archaeological sites in Tyrol, Goldbichl is a 1064 m tall hill which was used as a place of worship in the Bronze Age. The oldest finds at the site are flint arrowheads from the Neolithic period, originating from Verona, and proving that long distance trade was possible in that era. The hill gained importance in the Bronze age, 4 millennia ago, when sacrificial fires were lighted on altars made of clay and stone, which were visible from afar in the Stubai Valley looking out over the deforested hill. Remains of residences and gardens were found on the northern side of the hill, built on terraces separated from the religious sites by ramparts. The terraces are still recognizable today, although the hill has been reforested since Roman times. Interestingly, the grave of a young woman, buried here after her cremation, has been uncovered. The grave made news headlines because of the numerous ceramic artifacts and other funerary objects found along the scorched skeleton. The location of her grave suggests she might have been a priestess. The Bronze Age site existed until the 16th century BC. In the Iron Age, around 600 BC, the site found renewed interest and underwent expansion with fortifications such as walls and palisades. Evidence suggests that the site became the center of a settlement, and sporting competitions were organized around the sacrificial fires. Goldbichl remained important until the Alps were conquered by the Romans between 100 and 15 BC, and all the heathen facilities were destroyed. The site can be visited, and in 2006 an archaeological trail was constructed which leads up to the summit from the northeastern side, ca. 15-min walk. Free.   (updated Sep 2018)

Winter sports[edit]
Igls is most popular to travelers as a ski resort in winter, thanks to the Patscherkofel mountain in close proximity. With 18 km easy and intermediate slopes, the Patscherkofel ski area is ideal for beginners. Igls had its own gondola cable car up to the Patscherkofel summit until 2017 when it was replaced by a new aerial tramway with a higher capacity. It unfortunately no longer has a station in Igls itself, skiers must take a bus to the new base station about 20 min away from the Igls centre. Usage of the bus is free with a Patscherkofel skipass.

Igls' locals are reserved but helpful, so should anything happen to you, do not hesitate to ask for assistance. There is adequate mobile reception in the entire town and most arts of the Patscherkofel.
