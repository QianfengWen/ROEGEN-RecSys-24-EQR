 Finca Lesser. Horse riding, the scenery, the views. It's spectacular!! 
-24.723401-65.5039461 Quebrada de San Lorenzo (at the end of Juan Carlos Davalos). Take a hike through beautiful mountainside forests. The 7E bus from Salta takes you all the way to the trailhead, which has tourist information, bathrooms, a few restaurants, and a couple of shops. From there, keep going west to find the trail. Follow the yellow arrows and ignore the "propiedad privada" signs. The trail ends at a clearing with a wacky metal statue and beautiful views of San Lorenzo and Salta. Free. (updated Nov 2017)
