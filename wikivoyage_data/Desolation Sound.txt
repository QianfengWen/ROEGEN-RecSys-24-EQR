Desolation Sound is a popular boating and kayaking destination north of the Sunshine Coast in the province of British Columbia. It is an area of huge mountains and wilderness with little civilization and untouched cruising grounds. For purposes of this guide, it includes the eastern portion of the Discovery Islands (East and West Redonda Islands), Desolation Sound Marine Provincial Park and Toba Inlet. This article does not include information about 50.0964-124.92451 Cortes Island, which has its own article and forms the western edge of Desolation Sound.


Understand[edit]
Desolation Sound was inhabited by tribes of the Mainland Comox First Nation prior to the arrival of Europeans. In the summer of 1792, two expeditions led by Captains George Vancouver, Dionisio Alcalá Galiano and Cayetano Valdés y Flores arrived and cooperated in mapping the sound. Vancouver named it Desolation Sound, cryptically claiming that "there was not a single prospect that was pleasing to the eye".
