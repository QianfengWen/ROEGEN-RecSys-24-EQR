Invermere is a popular year-round tourist and recreation destination in the Columbia River Valley of southeastern British Columbia in the East Kootenays nestled between the Rocky Mountains to the east and the Purcell Mountains to the west.  The town has about 3,400 residents (2016), and is on the north end of Lake Windermere.


Understand[edit]
Climate[edit]
Invermere's climate is characterized by warm summers and cool winters. The Rocky Mountains to the east shield Invermere from the Arctic air in winter, although extreme cold spells do occur on occasion. Spring arrives earlier than on the prairies to the east of the Rocky Mountains. Although warm, summers are variable, with weather alternating between hot, dry spells and cool, showery periods.

Get in[edit]
The nearest airport with regular flights is in Cranbrook (1.5 hours drive), by traveling north on Highway 95 to Invermere.  The nearest international airport is in Calgary (3 hours drive).  From Calgary, take the Highway 1 (Trans-Canada Highway) west as far as Castle Junction.  This connects to Highway 93 South (southwest), a distance of about 90 km to Radium Hot Springs.  Invermere is on the north end of Windermere Lake about 30 minutes south of Radium Hot Springs.
