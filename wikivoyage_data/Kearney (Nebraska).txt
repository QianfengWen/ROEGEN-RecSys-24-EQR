Where's the "e"?
You may have noticed that the city of Kearney and Fort Kearny are spelled slightly differently.

Sandhill crane migration[edit]




Sandhill crane viewing etiquette
The large number of cranes in the area can be overwhelming for visitors, causing them to do things they wouldn't normally do. This results in visitors becoming more of a nuisance to the locals than the birds. When viewing the birds, keep the following in mind:

Do not attempt to approach the birds
It is illegal to harass the cranes and other birds
Most of the land around the Platte River Valley is private property, do not trespass.
Do not stop on major roadways or in front of private driveways
Being respectful of private property, the birds, and the locals will make sure everyone has an enjoyable time.


A skirmish between two sandhill cranes
Between late March and early April, hundreds of thousands of sandhill cranes stop along the central Platte River between North Platte and Grand Island on their way north into Canada for the summer. This leaves Kearney at the center of one of the largest bird migrations in the world. The shallow waters of the Platte and the meadows surrounding it provide a perfect resting spot for the birds. But sandhill cranes aren't the only birds making use of this location; ducks, eagles, geese, and even the endangered Whooping Crane all make stops along the Platte River at the same time. There are several viewing sites around the city, allowing for an unobstructed view of the cranes as they go about their business.
