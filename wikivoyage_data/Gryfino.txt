53.21388914.4751 Crooked Forest, Przemysłowa 25, Nowe Czarnowo (4 km south via DK31). Perhaps one of the few places in Poland that don't look real, but the odd turn near the root has always remained a mystery for most. The turn is also only found in a small area, too – in an area of about 0.3 hectares (0.74 acres) with only about 50 pines (360° virtual pano for reference). It's widely believed that this is the result of some human technique, but the hows and whys are remain a mystery.   (updated Jun 2023)
