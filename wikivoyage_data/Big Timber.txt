When you're out exploring remember this is bear country. Be bear aware while fishing or camping. Plenty of other wildlife may come close. Remember they are wild and can react badly to people. Keep your distance and enjoy watching.
Even though the streams look crystal clear, giardia parasites can be present. Do not drink from the stream (unless you boil the water) or you could be very sick.
