Clinton is a small town in Huron County named after Sir Henry Clinton, a Peninsular War hero. This small community gained fame as Canada's home of radar and is home to the permanent display of the School on Wheels.


Understand[edit]
Town Hall
In World War II, the CFB Clinton, a base for Canadian Forces, was located just out of town. Large radar antennas still remain in the town centre. The village was established in 1831. Today, some 3100 people live here, and the town is part of the Central Huron municipality.

History[edit]
Clinton was established in 1831, when Jonas Gibbings and brothers Peter and Stephen Vanderburg cleared out a small area to start. Clinton started to grow in 1844 when William Rattenbury laid out the plans to begin making a village. 

Get in[edit]
Clinton lies at the junction of Highways 4 and 8 and County Road 4. It's a 2 hr 20 min drive from Toronto, and 1 hr 15 min from  London, Ontario.

43.60543-81.5371651 School on Wheels Railcar Museum. Th-Su and holiday Mondays 11AM-4PM. The permanent display of the School on Wheels is the main sight in town. The story behind it is a remarkable one. For some 39 years a train car was set up as a school environment, moving from one remote village to the next. It would stay for a week at a time before moving on and was the only access to education for many settlers and rail worker's children in the area. Some of them would travel long distances to reach the School on Wheels, follow classes for a week and then take enough homework for self-study until the train's next visit. Teachers would live on board, for example Mr. Sloman with his family of five children, who served as a teacher for 39 years. Seven such cars existed in Northern Ontario and served children in remote areas from 1926 and the mid-1960s. There's no admission fee for the museum, but donations are appreciated.
