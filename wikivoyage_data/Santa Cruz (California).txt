Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk
Santa Cruz is a coastal city (population about 65,000 in 2019) in Santa Cruz County, at the north end of Monterey Bay in California, about 40 miles (64 km) south of San Jose and 75 miles (120 km) south of San Francisco.


Understand[edit]
Santa Cruz is best known as a countercultural hub, with a bohemian feel and youthful vibe, and fun weekend tourist attractions like the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk and the dubious Mystery Spot. The rather relaxed beach lifestyle is supplemented by some remaining high tech industry and a vibrant university culture. The University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) is regarded as one of the premier centers of higher learning in the region and was once well known for its strong emphasis on the arts and humanities.
The beaches north and south of Santa Cruz are considered some of the more pristine areas of natural beauty in central California.  The beautiful beaches and the rather mild climate play a central role in local culture.  Most visitors leave Santa Cruz amazed by the city's beauty and ambiance.

Climate[edit]
A variety of conditions prevail, depending on the beach, few are suited for swimming due to temperature and current, several are considered an expert surfer's cold cold paradise. Don't expect a beach culture like Southern California, with bikini babes and children swimming in the surf; for much of the year, it's considered perfectly normal to wear a sweater and long pants to the beach.

By plane[edit]
The nearest airport is in San Jose (SJC IATA).  To get to Santa Cruz, take either the Santa Cruz Airport Flyer, or the free airport shuttle to Santa Clara, the train or bus to Diridon Station and the Highway 17 Express bus.  San Francisco International Airport (SFO IATA) and even Oakland (OAK IATA) aren't much farther away, and sometimes have cheaper flights.  The Airport Flyer goes to SFO and Caltrain provides a route from SFO to San Jose, though with a transfer with BART in Millbrae. For private aircraft, there'a 2,000 ft (610 m) runway about 10 mi (16 km) northwest of downtown, near Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park.

By car[edit]
 from  &  Highway 17  south from San Jose is the most direct route when driving from the more populated parts of the Bay Area. It is a winding and very dangerous road over the mountains, arguably the most hazardous in the state shared during the week with heavy gravel trucks, so heed the speed limits take it easy and arrive alive. Accidents are very common, but the road is a bit safer since the addition of concrete barriers some years ago. Beware of fog, as well as "hurried" drivers, and drive with caution, especially when roads are wet. Going into San Jose Hwy 17 becomes I-880 at its intersection with I-280. 
 to  To merge from Highway 17 to Highway 1 in Santa Cruz to continue south, you must merge three times on the dreaded "fish hook". This causes the beginning of the dreaded commute from "over the hill" to the coast for many. Congestion usually lasts M-F 3PM until 6PM, from just south of 41st Ave. on Highway 1, spilling back onto Highway 17 going south.
 is a slower, longer, and more scenic route over the mountains, but it can get congested, and is often subject to extended periods of closure due to landslide damage during the winter. It's also very popular with both bicyclists and motorcyclists, so if driving a car over it be sure to be vigilant.
 A much more beautiful, but slower, approach to Santa Cruz is on Highway 1, either from the north, San Francisco and Pacifica (about 65 mi (105 km)), or from the south, Monterey and Big Sur (about 35 mi (56 km)).  During stormy seasons, check for rare, but often long-term road closures, although Devil's Slide, the most notorious location for landslides, was bypassed by a tunnel several years ago.

Get around[edit]
By foot[edit]
The main downtown strip is pedestrian friendly, and it's a 20-minute stroll from there to the beach. Walking to the University of California Santa Cruz from downtown is a little more difficult with a steep climb.

By bus[edit]
Santa Cruz Metro  provides bus service within the city.

By car[edit]
While driving is certainly an option, parking is tight, so be careful to not get ticketed.

By bike[edit]
Santa Cruz can be a wonderful town for cycling, but be careful because drivers are no better here than in many other places. Around town and along Highway 1 is easy, but roads in the Santa Cruz Mountains are steep, winding and challenging for many cyclists. Be careful. Collisions between bicycles and cars are often reported. A number of pedestrian and car collisions have also happened in the downtown area.

The original Mission Santa Cruz was dedicated by Fermin Lasuen in 1791 as the 12th California mission. In its early years, the mission suffered due to violence among the Indians. The original mission buildings (save one) fell down in an 1857 earthquake, and in its place was built a Catholic Church with the anglicized name Holy Cross Church. However, a replica of the old mission was constructed nearby at half-scale in the 1930s by a wealthy benefactor. This exists today as Santa Cruz Mission State Historic Park. Free.

This UC campus has a smaller student population (except for the brand new campus in Merced), with about 15,000 students. The main part of campus is spread over half of 2001 acres (8.1 km²), mostly covered with redwood forests with the occasional stunning view of the bay. There is an UCSC Arboretum specializing in native plants and plants from Australia. Mountain bike and hiking trails criss-cross the upper part of campus, connecting Wilder Ranch State Park to Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park (get a trail map and a parking permit from the kiosk as you enter campus). The Bay Tree Bookstore sells clothes with the UCSC mascot – the banana slug. The critters themselves are fairly common in the surrounding redwood forest - their bright yellow color tells would-be predators that their skin secretes a foul-tasting poison. Keep your eyes open for mountain lions seen (but rarely) in undeveloped parts of the campus.   
 Downtown Santa Cruz. Lots to see and do here all day and night; "SantaCruz" character mixed with some great restaurants and lots of cool shops. Mostly it's a great people watching center. The nightlife is worth sticking around for. Pacific Ave is the main street downtown. 
Do[edit]
Natural Bridges State Beach
Road Biking - Road cyclists in central Santa Cruz can escape the big city by going out Empire Grade, taking Branciforte to either Glen Canyon or Granite Creek, or even going out Hwy 1. A little to the east, two not so steep roads are Old San Jose Road (bit trafficky / better for descending, reachable from Branciforte via Laurel Glen) or Eureka Canyon (from Corralitos). Good connectors are Bear Creek, Smith Grade, Ice Cream Grade, Hwy 35, or even Mt. Hermon (from Granite Creek to Felton Empire). The worst traffic will be on Graham Hill or most of Hwy 9. To avoid Hwy 9 you'll need to do some climbing, but if that's your thing then try Empire Grade, Mountain Charlie, Zayante, Felton Empire, the wonderful Jamison Creek up from Big Basin Park, or the ridiculous Alba Road. Roads in Santa Cruz can be steep, and expect most to have some extended pitches of over 10%.
37.0054-121.995951 Delaveaga Disk Golf Course. This frisbee golf course is very challenging. Saturdays are busy, especially in the morning. The course is awesome and the hikes in the area are spectacular, even if you don't play. Beware of the Poison Oak. Free.

Events[edit]
Santa Cruz County is home to talented artists, musicians, and writers. Check out some of the locals' favorite art, music, and literary events:

 Open Studios Art Tour. A program of the Cultural Council of Santa Cruz County which was created in 1985 to give the public with an opportunity to collect art and to meet and learn from Santa Cruz County artists. Approximately 275 artists open their studios (which are usually in their homes) to the public. The tour runs for three consecutive weekends each fall. 
 Santa Cruz County Fair. 
 Salsa By The Sea. Santa Cruz boasts a lively salsa dancing scene, with Salsa By The Sea a key attraction. Every Sunday year round (weather permitting), locals come to the Boardwalk to dance in the open air by the beach. Hours vary by the time of the year, but sometime in the afternoon, and always free. Other regular events are at the Vets Hall every Tuesday and the Palomar every Friday. 
 Cabrillo Music Festival. The Cabrillo Music Festival, Marin Alsop at the podium, is an internationally acclaimed celebration of contemporary orchestral music that opens during the end of July. Musicians from key orchestras around the country attend without pay for the experience of playing new works by the leading composers of our time who are usually in attendance. Many rehearsals are open and free to the public, as are workshops for new composers and conductors. The Festival, which began in 1962, lasts two weeks and is perhaps the most exciting and prestigious festival of contemporary music anywhere. 
Beaches[edit]
Santa Cruz is a beach town, with a beach to match almost any interest. 36.96373-122.017244 Main Beach and 36.96122-122.024645 Cowell Beach attract large crowds to the boardwalk area on sunny summer weekends. Flocks of novice surfers balance on their boards in the quiet waters just north of the municipal wharf, in front of the big hotel that locals still call the 36.96183-122.025091 Dream Inn. Volleyball nets are strung just south of the wharf. The boardwalk amusement area is adjacent to main beach. Heading north, 36.9517-122.026126 Steamers Lane isn't a beach, but the famous surf break in front of the lighthouse. In the summer, its sometimes hard to see what the fuss is about, but the winter can bring big waves and spectators line the rail watching the surfers and the sea lions.
North of the lighthouse are a series of little pocket beaches, some that disappear entirely in the winter. The first one, 36.95205-122.029437 It's Beach, and across the street at Lighthouse Field (see www.folf.org) are two of the few places in town that dogs can be run off leash (before 10AM and after 4PM only) you will often dozens of dogs are chasing sticks, balls, and each other. 36.95291-122.040798 Mitchell's Cove, just north, also allows dogs. Natural Bridges State Beach, whose famous monarch butterflies are discussed above, is a popular windsurfing beach. Natural Bridges is also known for its tide pools - little pockets in the rocky formation just north of the main beach that are exposed at low tide and house all sorts of small marine creatures. Kids love them but keep a close eye on them as the rocks can be slippery and the ocean unpredictable. The name is misleading: one of the two stone bridges collapsed a few years ago. Just south of Natural Bridges is the tiny clothing-optional 2222 Beach.
Heading further north along the coast, you leave the city limits and pass through agricultural fields for 11 mi (18 km) before reaching the small town of Davenport, which has a couple of restaurants, a B&B, and a huge cement plant that dominates the skyline. Each turnout along the road marks a beach, many of which are prime surf spots. 36.96078-122.083369 Wilder Ranch State Park can be reached by a new bike path from just north of Natural Bridges. Its several nice beaches include 36.96159-122.1127110 Three Mile Beach and 36.96674-122.1227311 Four Mile Beach, named after their distances from town. 36.98336-122.1560112 Laguna Creek Beach (with parking on the east of highway 1), 36.99299-122.1704913 Panther and 36.99224-122.1699214 Hole-in-the-Wall Beach (connected by a passage that closes at high tide), 37.00035-122.1815215 Bonny Doon Beach (another famous clothing optional spot), and 37.00894-122.1928316 Davenport Beach. For those who want to tour the beaches, Highway 1 has wide shoulders that are generally safe for cycling.
The beaches north of the Boardwalk, especially those on the open ocean instead of the bay, can have huge waves and strong currents, so care should be taken in the water, even by strong swimmers.
There are lots of beaches south of Main Beach as well, but you'll need another guide for them.

Hiking[edit]
Big Basin State Park
Santa Cruz is also surrounded by a great number of open space parks. There are two types of parks to choose from. There are inland wooded parks, (like Henry Cowell State Park) with redwood groves, and swimming in the river and open space preserves built on the coastal hills.
Wilder Ranch is a state park sitting in the hills adjacent to the coast (just west of town on Hwy 1). It has expansive views of the Monterey Bay as well as sweeping views of the Santa Cruz Mountains. The ranch also includes many old historic building, staffed with docents to demonstrate the workings of the historic ranch.
The Pogonip is within the city boundaries adjacent to the university and accessible from Spring Street and from Highway 9 (via Golf Club). The Pogonip is an old country club which has reverted to a fairly natural state. It sits on the side of a hill and has great views as well as great natural items. Numerous springs fill the creeks, as well as a special fish pond along the Spring Box Trail.

Sleep[edit]
Santa Cruz offers everything from cheap drive-up motels along Ocean Street to cute B&Bs to one somewhat shabby high-rise hotel on the beach.
A medley of factors allows for de facto legal camping throughout town on city-owned property. There are encampments scattered throughout town. Downtown alone features an encampment of dozens of tents adjacent to San Lorenzo Park. Many people sleep and live in cars and RVs throughout the area, though some neighborhoods may tolerate it less or more than others.

Camp[edit]
For our bohemian friends passing through (keep Santa Cruz Weird!), sleeping on city beaches cannot be recommended. Try the more chill beaches along the cliffs northwest of town, or along the sandy banks of the San Lorenzo, upriver in the gorge, along Highway 9.

37.0167-122.0514 Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park. Just north of Santa Cruz on Highway 9, Henry Cowell sits in giant redwoods trees. Nice enough to be a destination in and of itself but also a nice central spot to use as a base of operations for exploring Santa Cruz and surroundings.

Stay safe[edit]
There is much crime in the downtown area, often drug-related. You will probably be safe during the day and early evening, but keep your wits about yourself. Mountain lions exist in the more rural areas, but are uncommon. Attacks by mountain lions on humans are much rarer still, but have happened. If you should see one, do not approach it, and if it approaches you in a seemingly aggressive manner, stand as tall as possible and wave your arms; this will usually intimidate it.
During most of the year, the ocean is cold enough to quickly give you hypothermia, and there are dangerous rip currents at many beaches. Unless you're a qualified diver and you've done your homework, you're best off leaving it to the local surfers, who typically wear full-body wetsuits and know what they're doing.
If you are a skilled surfer, be aware that Santa Cruz's surfing culture is unfortunately notorious for its "locals only" attitude, and while in reality most surfers there are perfectly reasonable and friendly, if you are surfing there and you do get into a confrontation, it's best to just walk away.
