Riva del Garda is an elegant historic resort town situated at the northern tip of Lake Garda in Trentino. Because of its scenic beauty, warm and sunny climate, and direct rail access from Austria and Bavaria, Riva is a hub for international tourism. 


Understand[edit]
Lake Garda from the Riva
Picturesque Riva lies on the northern shores of Lake Garda at the foot of Mt. Brione. Since the second half of the 19th century the town became popular with European royalty and American billionaires. Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary Francesco Ferdinando, Russian Great Duchess Olga Alexandrova and American businessman Alfred Vanderbilt I, were frequent visitors to this charming lakeside town. Lavish buildings surrounded by evergreen parks were constructed to accommodate and entertain Riva's distinguished guests. The majority of visitors are still of German and Russian nationality.

The nearest railway station is in Rovereto (20 km from Riva del Garda). The DB Bahn has daily connections to/from Rovereto Station.

Get around[edit]
The historic centre of Riva is compact enough to easily be traversed on foot and, to that effect, mostly pedestrianized. To improve access from residences and hotels farther afield, the provincial authority operates four bus routes[dead link] reaching as far as neighbouring municipalities. Visitors overnighting in Trentino may receive a Trentino Guest Card at their place of accommodation, which provides the right to travel on all public transit within Trentino for free.
