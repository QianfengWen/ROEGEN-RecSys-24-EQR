West Vancouver  is a suburban area of Vancouver's North Shore in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, Canada. It has a few good parks, excellent hikes and some of the most expensive property in Canada.


Understand[edit]
West Vancouver and Grouse Mountain, viewed from across English Bay
West Vancouver is mainly a residential district as it has no manufacturing industry by law.  Many of its residents commute to downtown Vancouver, work at home, or are retired.  It is home to some very large expensive houses, most with views of Vancouver Island, English Bay, and/or Howe Sound.  West Van (as the locals call it) is Canada's wealthiest municipality (followed by its neighbor, North Vancouver).  Together with the District of North Vancouver and City of North Vancouver, it is part of a local regional grouping referred to as the North Shore municipalities, or simply "The North Shore".
