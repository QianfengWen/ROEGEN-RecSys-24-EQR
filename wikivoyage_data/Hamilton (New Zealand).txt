Hamilton (Kirikiriroa in Māori)  is an inland city in the Waikato region of New Zealand's North Island. In 2020, Hamilton was awarded the title of most beautiful large city in New Zealand. Hamilton Gardens is the region's most popular tourist attraction.


Understand[edit]
The area now covered by the city was originally the site of several Māori villages, including Kirikiriroa, from which the city takes its Māori name. By the time English settlers arrived, most of these villages, which sat beside the Waikato River, were abandoned as a result of the Invasion of Waikato and land confiscation (Raupatu) by the Crown.
The settlers developed the city as an agricultural service centre, but it now has a diverse economy and is the third fastest growing urban area in New Zealand, behind Pukekohe and Auckland. In 2023, it was home to 185,000 people. 
The Waikato River, New Zealand's longest river, flows through the middle of the city. This effectively cuts the city in half, with Hamilton West containing the central business district and main shopping areas, and Hamilton East home to the University of Waikato and a large student population.

Booking in advance (particularly on the internet) can also save money - up to half the fare in some cases. In any case, travelling by bus is generally a cheap option, albeit a bit slow at times.
