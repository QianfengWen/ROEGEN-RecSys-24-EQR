Babe Ruth exhibit at the National Baseball Hall of Fame
Cooperstown, in Central New York, is known best for its role as the home of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. The villagers believe that Abner Doubleday invented baseball on a cow pasture within the village in 1839. (The actual origins of baseball are uncertain but surely date back earlier.)
Cooperstown is also known for the Glimmerglass Opera Festival which is the finest of its kind in Upstate New York and even beats the only permanent opera company in this area, Syracuse Opera.


Get in[edit]
