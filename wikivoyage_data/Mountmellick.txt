Mountmellick is a town in County Laois, with a population of about 4900 in 2022. It's difficult to believe that this small place was once a large industrial town: English Quakers settled in the 17th century and founded breweries, a distillery, woollen mills, cotton, tanneries and glassworks. These have all vanished, though a tradition of lace-making and embroidery continues. The main reason to visit is to explore the Slieve Bloom Mountains rising to the west. The town in spite of its name doesn't have a "mount" — it's from Irish Móinteach Mílic. That means "the bog next to a river" which, this being Ireland, doesn't much help you locate it.
