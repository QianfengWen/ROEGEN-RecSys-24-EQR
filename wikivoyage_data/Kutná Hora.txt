St. Barbara Cathedral in Kutná Hora
Kutná Hora is a town in the Central Bohemia region of the Czech Republic.


Understand[edit]
Kutná Hora was a silver mining town in medieval times: once the second Czech city to Prague in terms of population. In 2020, it was home to about 21,000 people.
Although Kutná Hora has some comparatively drab modern architecture, it was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1995 for the Historical Town Centre, including the Church of St Barbara and the Cathedral of Our Lady at Sedlec. At both ends of the town there are some beautiful buildings, and the higher points of the town are home to restored older architecture, with Medieval, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque buildings.

Get in[edit]
Kutná Hora hl.n. (main train station)
Both options for getting in use the same tickets of the Prague Integrated Transport. These are similar to the tram/metro tickets in Prague, but you will require a special suburban ticket as follows:

Most people will require a Suburban Ticket for 11 zones, which costs 84 Kč and covers the journey from anywhere in Prague to the Railway/Bus station, and then the journey all the way to Kutná Hora. Can be purchased from the yellow ticket machines in Prague in advance, and then stamped in the machines like a regular Prague ticket. For the return journey by train from Kutná Hora you must buy your ticket in the office at the station as there are no stamping machines. Show them your outward ticket and they will understand what to sell you.
For those who already have a valid pass for Prague public transport (72h, monthly pass, etc.), you will only need a Suburban Ticket for 7 zones, costing 54 Kč and covering the portion of the journey not in Prague. Can be purchased from the yellow ticket machines in Prague in advance, and then stamped in the machines in the tunnel at the train station, or on board the bus to Kutná Hora. Show both this and your valid pass to the Train Conductor/Bus Driver. For the return journey by train from Kutná Hora you must buy your ticket in the office at the station as there are no stamping machines. Show them your outward ticket and they will understand what to sell you.
By train[edit]
There are trains roughly hourly from Prague leaving Hlavní nádraží, see the timetable. Make sure you search for the 49.949915.27721 Kutná Hora město station, which is much closer to the town centre than 49.961915.30032 Kutná Hora hl.n.. You will have to change at Kutná Hora hl.n., and sometimes also at Kolín.
In addition to using PID Suburban Zone Ticket, another option is to buy the train tickets to Kutná Hora město directly from ČD (Czech Railways) website or mobile app. It will be more expensive, but the plus side is you can reserve the seat for the train from Hlavní nádraží to Kutná Hora hl.n. or Kolin.

By bus[edit]
There are buses roughly hourly from Prague leaving from the Háje bus station, see the timetable. Some are direct and some require an interchange. The bus takes much longer, is less comfortable, and is the same price as the train, so would only be advisable for those staying near the bus stop in Prague. Journey time is around 1h50min. The 49.95411415.2722683 main bus station is close to the historical center.


Get around[edit]
49°57′15″N 15°16′32″EMap of Kutná Hora
The town is about 3 km long, so it is possible to explore on foot. This isn't particularly rewarding though, as most of it is residential and the attractions (with the exception of the Kostnice Ossuary) are concentrated at the other end of town from the train station.
There is a local bus system with buses arriving to meet the trains. If you want to return to the train station from the historical core, take the bus that says "Hlavni Nádraží" on the front window. A single ride for adults costs 12 Kč and will leave you right at the train station, though the schedule only has two buses an hour, so walking might actually be quicker depending on your timing.
There is also a very convenient, privately operated "tourist bus" that constantly drives between the main train station (Hl. N), the ossuary, and St. Barbara for 35 Kč per person. The drivers wait until the bus (which is really a mini van) fills up to at least 3 guests, then drives off. He's usually waiting outside the Ossuary, driving people to the St. Barbara Church.
There is also local train connecting historical core (station "Kutná Hora město") and the main station "Kutná Hora hlavní nádraží". It meets the arrival (and departure) of nearly all the express trains, leaving a five-minute gap for transfer.  (This could be a problem if you want to leave luggage at the main station, since (1) there are no left luggage facilities at the local station and (2) if you see both the Ossuary and the city, then it may be convenient to arrive at one station and leave from the other.)  You can buy the train ticket from the local station "Kutná Hora město" directly to Prague. The price will be the same as the price from "Kutná Hora hlavní nádraží" to Prague.  This isn't Prague, though, so expect only minimal understanding of non-Czech languages from the ticket sellers.  There are no ticket machines or similar amenities.
There are also taxis: usually one or two will meet the train, otherwise they can be a little difficult to find. Unlike in Prague, it is safe to hail them in the street: they won't overcharge. A taxi ride from one end of town to the other is about 80 Kč.
Additional information

When you arrive at Kutná Hora you may get the Number 1 bus to Kutná Hora Město (Kutná Hora Town Center) or wait at the station for the train that goes to Kutná Hora Město. There are 3 stops, but you're better off at Kutná Hora Mešto if you're headed to the town center and not the Ossuary.
If you feel fit ...
Then, walking is your best bet. When you leave the station, go right until you reach the first intersection (about 3min walk). Then turn left and walk for another 5–8 minutes (it depends on how quickly you walk) and you will come to the church on your left (more details to follow) and the Ossuary on your right. At the Ossuary you need to pay a fee to enter (50 Kč) and another one to take pictures (30 Kč).
After you finish with the Ossuary, you can walk to the town center but it will take 35–45 minutes. Go back to the main road and turn right. You're now about 2,5 km from the town center.
All you have to do is to follow the road signs until you reach the main attractions in the town center. You cannot miss the  St. Barbara's Cathedral and, April to November, the Hrádek - Czech museum of silver.
Suggested itinerary
Arrive at the Kutna Hora Hlavni Nádraží, walk to the Ossuary. Take a bus, tourist shuttle, or walk to St. Barbara's church. Follow the church's exit out to explore the entire city—it leads you directly into the town. There's a lot of cafes, restaurants, souvenir shopping, art museums, and the famous Kutna Hora underground mine tour. At the end of your city exploration, walk to the Kutná Hora Město (Kutná Hora Town Center) Train Station and head back to Prague via a short "shuttle" train to Kutna Hora Hlavni Nádraží.

Bones in Kostnice Ossuary
49.9618115.288141 Ossuary (Kostnice), Zamecka 127, ☏ +420 327 561 143, info@kostnice.cz. Apr-Sep: daily 07:00-18:00; Oct-Mar: daily 09:00-17:00; Nov-Feb: daily 09:00-16:00. This impressive bone church, is better known as the Sedlec Ossuary. The beginning of its story date back to 1278, when Henry, the abbot of Sedlec was sent to the Holy Land. On returning, he brought soil from Golgotha and sprinkled it on the ground here. As a consequence, the burial ground was considered holy and became extremely popular. In 1511 a chapel was constructed to house the bones from abolished graves. The chapel is open to the public, and contains the bones of about 40,000 people, arranged by František Rint in 1870. Rint's work includes an enormous chandelier including every bone in the body, and a crucifix style arrangement near the main altar. 160 Kč adult, 80 Kč student, combined ticket 350 Kč (kostnice+St Barbara). Updated Feb 2023.   
49.9477815.267222 Church of St. Barbara (the church is located at the opposite end of the Kutná Hora's train station; if you wish to start your tour from there, you may want to get a taxi from the station to the Church and then walk your way around the town centre). The works on the church started around 1380 by Peter Parler's workshop, whose other great work in the Czech Republic includes the imposing St. Vitus Cathedral at the Prague Castle. The eye-catching spires are truly magnificent. If you're looking for some fantastic Gothic Bohemian style, St. Barbara Church is certainly one of them alongside St. Vitus in Prague (although as you might see it soon after Prague, it might not make the same impression as seeing Vitus, which is even more grand).

Generally, the staff in restaurants around St. Barbara's Cathedral are friendlier and (oddly) more professional than in Prague. There are a number of bars, restaurants and cafes just underneath the shadow of the cathedral. Some provide a breathtaking view of the valley to the south. 

 U Hrnčiře[dead link], Barborská 24 (by the Jug Maker's). The food is excellent with traditional Czech dishes alongside a surprising array of vegetarian dishes.
Pizzeria Piazza Navona, at Palackeho Square, offers traditional (and original) Italian pizza and pasta and homemade tiramisù and panna-cota.
