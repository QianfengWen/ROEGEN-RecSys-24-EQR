Cookstown is a town historically in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, but since 2015 part of Mid-Ulster district. It's named for Dr Alan Cooke who founded it circa 1620 as an Ulster Plantation town, but for 150 years it didn't get going. Then it grew with the linen industry, acquiring its famously long wide main street, and the railway arrived. The 20th century collapse of textile trades and the sectarian Troubles fed upon each other and Cookstown slumped. In the 21st century it's slowly reviving through the Good Friday Agreement peace and as a commuter town for Belfast but remains a work in progress; in 2021 it had a population of 12,500. 
Medieval Kings of Tyrone, the O'Neill dynasty, were inaugurated a couple of miles south at Tullyhogue. Notable local people include "Typhoid Mary" Mallon and the politician Bernadette Devlin McAliskey.

See Belfast for long-distance travel routes by air or sea. If you're flying in and hiring a car, there are two Belfast airports, and Dublin Airport is almost as convenient as it's north of the city, you turn straight onto the M1 north. From Belfast follow M1 west to Dungannon then A29 into Cookstown. From the ferry ports at Belfast or Larne it's quicker to join M2 west to Magherafelt then A31. From Dublin branch off the motorway at Newry to follow A28 to Armagh then A29 to Dungannon and Cookstown. 

By bus[edit]
Bus 209 runs from Belfast Europa station via Lurgan, taking 1 hr 40 min to Cookstown. There are five M-F, three on Saturday and two on Sunday.
It's often more convenient to take the hourly Goldline Bus 273 from Belfast to Dungannon (heading for Omagh, Strabane and Derry). From there, Bus 80 runs to Cookstown every hour or two, for a total journey of around two hours. 
Ulsterbus 110 / 210 runs from  Antrim via Randalstown, Castledawson, Magherafelt and Moneymore, taking 70 min to Cookstown. They're every two hours M-F, with only four on Saturday. On Sunday only two buses run, but they start from Belfast Europa station. 
Bus 89 also runs twice M-F from Magherafelt, but takes a roundabout route via Arboe and Killycolpy.  
Bus X4 runs once a day from Dublin Busáras and Airport via Armagh and Dungannon, taking 3 hours to Cookstown, and continuing via Maghera to  Londonderry. The X3 between Dublin and Londonderry runs via Omagh and doesn't serve Cookstown. 
Goldline Bus 278 runs in university term-time, with one bus Su-F from Monaghan via Armagh, Moy, Dungannon, Cookstown, Magherafelt, Garvagh and Coleraine to Ulster University, Portstewart and Portrush.
54.646-6.7411 Cookstown bus station is on Molesworth Street a block east of main street.

Cookstown's sights are scattered widely around the countryside with no public transport. Tullyhogue is a couple of miles walk but you need wheels for the others, eg the bus for Beaghmore and the beetling mill only runs twice a day. Consider hiring a taxi for a few hours, and the driver will know which obscure country lane to turn up, and yarn about how his great-grandmother used to milk the cows there.
National Cycleway 95[dead link] runs mostly on-road from Armagh to Dungannon, Cookstown and Strabane, while Route 94 circles Lough Neagh.

Cookstown main street is the longest in Ireland, 1.25 miles long and 135 feet wide, laid out in the 1790s in an attempt to out-shine Dublin's O'Connell Street. It goes by various names along its length and its buildings are mostly Victorian, springing up when the railway arrived in 1856. Handsome examples along it are Holy Trinity Church and Derryloran Parish Church (both below), the former Courthouse, the First Presbyterian Church and the Methodist Church. On Molesworth Street find another Presbyterian Church and the old railway terminus.
 Holy Trinity Church (RC), Chapel St BT80 8QB. Designed by the prolific Irish architect J J McCarthy and built 1858-60, with a soaring West Tower and spire. The interior (much altered in 1981) is dominated by a huge eastern window. The Church was extensively renovated in 2010-2011. Mass is M-Sa 10:00, Sa 18:00, Su 09:30 and 12:00. (updated Sep 2020)
Derryloran Parish Church (Church of Ireland) was built in 1822 to a "First Fruits" design by John Nash, but extended almost beyond recognition as the town's population grew.
Derryloran Old Church and graveyard is half a mile west along Drum Road, junction with Sandholes Road. It was built in 1622 replacing 15th-century churches. In the 19th century it was abandoned for the Nash church in town centre.
54.635-6.7361 Killymoon Castle, Castle Rd BT80 8JY. Accessible on by tour booked on the website. Grand mansion on the slopes above Ballinderry River, built 1801-03 to designs of John Nash over the burnt-out ruin of the 17th-century castle. It was bought by the present owners in 1922 for the princely sum of £100, and remains a private residence. There's a golf course on its grounds and a castle cafe, Tommy's Kitchen, where you can take Afternoon Tea if you orde 24 hours in advance. This building is not to be confused with Killymoon Bouncy Castles, which were not designed by Nash.   (updated Apr 2024)
Tullahogue Fort
54.61-6.723062 Tullyhogue Fort, Tullyhogue BT80 8UB (2 miles southeast of town). 24 hours. Called a fort, but this bosky mound was entirely ceremonial, with no defensive role. It's best documented as the place where the O'Neill kings of Tyrone were inaugurated, from the 11th to 16th century, though the earthwork is much older. The new king sat upon Leac na Rí, the royal flagstone, a boulder akin to Scotland's "Stone of Destiny", while his men waved a shoe above his head. In the 13th century the O'Neill court moved to Dungannon but ceremonial shoe-ins continued here to 1585. The Nine Years' War ended O'Neill rule and the English smashed the stone to smithereens (Irish smidiríní, which are even tinier than smiodar, fragments.). Free.   (updated Sep 2020)
Donaghrisk walled cemetery is half a mile southwest of the Fort, a circular enclosure in the field far side of B520 Tullywiggan Road. It's the ancestral graveyard of the O'Hagans, chief justices of Tyrone under the O'Neills.
54.643056-6.8244443 Drum Manor Forest Park, Drum Rd BT80 8UN (A505 five miles west of town). Daily. Picturesque all year round with shrub, butterfly and Japanese gardens, arboretum, ponds and mixed woodlands, with waymarked trails. The Manor was built in 1868 but derelict by the 20th century, and demolished after 1980. The shell of the ground floor and east tower survive, transformed into a Japanese garden. See Sleep for the campsite here, open mid-March to Oct. Car £4.   (updated Sep 2020)
54.654942-6.8395234 Wellbrook Beetling Mill, 20 Wellbrook Rd BT80 9RY (off A505 a mile west of Forest Park), ☏ +44 28 8674 8210, wellbrook@nationaltrust.org.uk. Closed until May 2021. Beetling was the last stage in the manufacture of linen, when it was pounded by wooden mallets or "beetles" to tense the fabric and give it a lustrous finish, which should last for the product's lifetime. In the 19th century this was replaced by other methods and Wellbrook, built in 1830, is the last working beetling mill in Ireland. It's in a picturesque wooded glen on the banks of the Ballinderry River, which powers its 16-ft water wheel. Adult £5, NT and children free. (updated Sep 2020)
54.701-6.9395 Beaghmore, Blackrock Rd BT80 9PA. 24 hours. A complex of megaliths dated circa 2000-1500 BC which became buried in bog, and came to light during peat cutting in the 1930s. There are seven stone circles, with low boulders though one is larger and filled with upright smaller stones in a "dragon's teeth" pattern. There are also ten stone rows and 12 cairns. The site is only partly excavated and there's probably more of it still buried. Free.   (updated Sep 2020)
54.72-6.9236 Davagh Forest has a mix of woodland, heath and blanket bog. There are mountain-bike trails.
54.705-7.0347 Dun Ruadh, meaning "red fort", is an unusual burial cairn in a horseshoe ring, probably Bronze Age from 2000 BC. The walls are still six foot high; nowadays a tree grows in the middle. It's on private land on Crockyneill Hill so only approach with the farmer's permission.
54.699-7.0438 Aghanascrebagh Ogham Stone stands by a lane 1 km southwest of Dun Ruadh. It's not much to look at, but such stones were erected 5th-6th century AD as memorials. The inscription reads ᚛ᚇᚑᚈᚓᚈᚈᚑ ᚋᚐᚊᚔ ᚋᚐᚌᚂᚐᚅᚔ᚜ which (in case your Ogham's a bit rusty) transcribes as "Dotetto, Mac (ie tribe of) Maglani".
54.619-79 Creggandevesky Court Tomb may be 5000 years old. It's 200 yards west of Loughmallon Road, watch for the signpost, but the farmer may block access if there's livestock in the field.
54.67195-6.76085510 Lissan House, Drumgrass Road BT80 9SW. Daily 09:00-17:00. Plantation-era mansion, home of the Staples family 1620-2006. It was greatly extended (and the family financially over-extended) with Georgian and Victorian additions. It became derelict in the 20th century but was made over to a charitable trust, restored, and opened to visits from 2012.   (updated Sep 2020)
54.723-6.82711 Lough Fea is six miles north of town along B162. It's a reservoir lake, angling is permitted, and there's a firm walking trail around it of 2.5 miles. On the lane northeast is Ballybriest, a dual court tomb from perhaps 3500 BC, and Corick stone circle is further up the hill. Rising above is Slieve Gallion, the eastern summit of The Sperrins: see Magherafelt.
54.686-6.65612 Springhill House, 20 Springhill Road, Moneymore BT45 7NQ (5 miles northeast of town), ☏ +44 28 8674-8210, springhill@nationaltrust.org.uk. Closed until April 2021. This beautiful manor house, built around 1680, was home to ten generations of the Lenox-Conynghams, an early Plantation family. It's been owned by the National Trust since 1957 and has a large Costume Museum in the former laundry. There are extensive woodland grounds.   (updated Sep 2020)
54.6195-6.5050213 Ardboe is a little village on the shore of Lough Neagh. Its main attraction is the 10th century High Cross, the oldest in Ulster, 18 foot tall and elaborately carved. There was a monastery here from the 6th century, founded by Saint Colman, but nothing remains. A mile north at the junction of Annaghmore Rd and Aneeterer Rd is Coyle's Cottage, a 250-year-old fisherman's cottage. It's occasionally been open to visits.

Who's cooking tonight?

Poster depiction of "Typhoid Mary"
Cookstown, fittingly, was the birthplace of Mary Mallon (1869-1938), better known as "Typhoid Mary". At age 15 she emigrated to the US, and became cook to a series of prosperous New York families. In her wake she left many cases of typhoid fever, some fatal, but herself remained in good health. She was shown to be a typhoid carrier, but she was in denial about this throughout her life, and wouldn't wash her hands. She was forcibly quarantined on North Brother Island NYC for three years, then released under promise of taking up different work. But she soon returned to cooking; after further outbreaks she was re-captured, and spent the remaining 23 years of her life quarantined on the island.
