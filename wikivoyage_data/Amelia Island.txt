Amelia Island is an island town at the northeast tip of Florida, just south of the Georgia border. It includes the city of Fernandina Beach.


Get in[edit]
FL-A1A's northern terminus is in Amelia Island, and therefore this road can be used to access Amelia Island from the south. There is also a connection by road on the western side. There is no route directly north to or from Georgia.
