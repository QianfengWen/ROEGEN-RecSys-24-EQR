The Outer Discovery Islands and nearby Mainland Inlets are an off the beaten path delight of chisel.ed fjords and forest-clad islands, a land where the salmon run, the eagles soar and the grizzly bears roam. Tucked between Vancouver Island and the mainland of British Columbia, it’s a mostly untouched expanse of wilderness whose lodges, marinas, parks and breathtaking scenery are only accessible by boat or float plane.


Understand[edit]
Get in[edit]
By boat[edit]
There's no scheduled ferry service to the outer Discovery Islands so you'll need your own boat or hire a water taxi to get to your destination. Campbell River has two companies that offer water taxi services into the islands.

 Discovery Launch Water Taxi, ☏ +1 250-287-7577, info@discoverylaunch.com. Campbell River-based service provider of water taxi services to the Discovery Islands, coastal inlets, some of the northern Sunshine Coast, and parts of Vancouver Island.

By seaplane[edit]
Another option for getting in is by float plane with year-round connections to Campbell River and summer flights from Vancouver and Seattle. Many of the lodges are part of scheduled service and the companies can usually schedule a drop-off/pick-up at other locations, although expect to pay more. Note that some destinations do not have a marina or dock so the drop-off/pick-up is plane to boat.

 Corilair, ☏ +1 250-287-8371, toll-free: +1-888-287-8366, fax: +1 250-287-3481, reservations@corilair.com.

There is also a daily scheduled service between Campbell River and Vancouver International Airport from late June to early Sept that will make stops in the outer islands, if requested. $100 and up (for scheduled service between Campbell River and the Discovery Islands).

Get around[edit]
Map of Outer Islands and Mainland Inlets
See[edit]
Nature is the main attraction with some spectacular scenery and excellent opportunities to see wildlife.

The coastal inlets, pushing up to 80 km into the Coast Mountains, are dramatic with a background of snow-capped mountains and waterfalls plunging over steep cliff faces.
50.368-124.6961 Toba Inlet. North of Desolation Sound, is known for its emerald or jade green waters and many waterfalls (particularly in late spring and early summer).   (updated Oct 2023)
50.486-125.0772 Bute Inlet. Is visually impressive. Some of BC’s largest icefields are in the mountains behind Bute Inlet, as well as Mount Waddington, the highest peak in BC’s Coast Mountain range.   (updated Oct 2023)
50.227-125.11183 Read Island floating post office, Surge Narrows, Read Island. More a curiosity than a must-see attraction, the post office is one of the very few floating post offices left in Canada. It’s a relatively short kayak trip from Bold Point (on Quadra Island) or can be seen as part of Corilair’s Mail Run flight. (updated Dec 2015)
Wildlife[edit]
Wildlife is abundant in the Outer Discovery Islands and one of its most popular attractions. The opportunity to see grizzly bears in their natural habitat is the main draw, but many other animals — such as eagles, black bears, sea lions, porpoises and orcas — make their home here or pass through. Viewing is seasonal though, so if you have your sights set on a particular animal, keep the following dates in mind:

Blacks Bears - will forage along the shoreline in spring and early summer, more uncommon after that as they move higher in the mountains for food
Grizzly Bears - also forage along the shoreline in spring and then gather at the rivers in late Aug thru Oct to feed on returning salmon
Eagles - commonly seen, particularly in spring and early summer
Orcas - occasional sightings throughout period, but more common in mid to late summer
Sea Lions - early spring & fall
Do[edit]
The Bute Inlet is one of the best places to see grizzly bears in BC
Fishing is a very popular activity and several lodges in the islands cater to it, as well as operators in Campbell River. Salmon fishing is the main attraction with five species of Pacific salmon present. Halibut, lingcod and rockfish can also be fished. For most species, there are restrictions on the number of fish and size that can be kept, and caught fish can only be kept at certain times of the year (e.g., chinook can typically be kept in spring and coho in fall). The exact dates vary from year to year so confirm with your fishing operator or check the Fisheries and Oceans Canada website. Fishing in BC requires a licence — some lodges will arrange it for you, while others will expect you to arrange it yourself prior to arrival — so it is best to confirm this detail before arriving.
50.596-124.8541 The Bears of Bute Inlet, Orford River, Bute Inlet. The Orford River estuary is a major salmon spawning river and each Aug through Oct, it has one of the highest concentrations of grizzly bears in British Columbia that come to feast on the salmon. The Homalco First Nation provides daily guided tours and viewing opportunities of the grizzly bears in this region with a system of seven viewing areas and five platforms (towers) from mid-Aug to end of Oct. Tours are booked through authorized operators, which include the Sonora Resort, as well as some tour companies operating out of Campbell River. (updated Dec 2015)
Buy[edit]
Limited food supplies are available from general stores. If you're camping, it's best to stock up before you head off into the islands.

50.39278-125.134621 Stuart Island Community Dock & General Store (in Big Bay on the west side of Stuart Island), ☏ +1 250-202-3625. Daily 9AM-6PM. (updated May 2023)
Eat[edit]
Eating options are limited and, unless you have your own boat to travel around, will be determined by your choice of accommodation. Many lodges have restaurants and provide meals as part of the vacation. Lodges that don't have restaurants usually have shared cooking facilities or cabins with kitchens.

Sleep[edit]
There isn't much accommodation in the Outer Islands but it's surprisingly varied. Options range from wilderness camping with no facilities to fishing lodges to a posh all-inclusive resort (with options in between).

Camping[edit]
There are many small and hidden spots for wilderness camping throughout the islands. There are no facilities and you are expected to practice "leave no trace" camping. Private camping facilities or camping in provincial parks are noted below.

50.261-125.0331 Rendezvous Island South Provincial Park, South Rendezvous Island (Calm Channel, northeast of Read Island; roughly a one-hour boat ride from Campbell River). Wilderness camping amid the forests on the southernmost island of the Rendezvous chain with views of the Discovery Islands and Coast Mountains. The best camping spots are considered to be on the southern part of the island. There are no facilities in the park. No fee.   (updated Jan 2016)
