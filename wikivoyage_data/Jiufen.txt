A view from Jiufen
Jiufen or Jioufen (九份; Jiǔfèn), historically spelled Chiufen, is a small town in Northern Taiwan. It's a must-visit for any Studio Ghibli fans who will find many of its streets familiar from the movie Spirited Away. A long standing rumour suggested that Jiufen was the inspiration for the film, but its director Hayao Miyazaki has firmly denied this.


Understand[edit]
Jiufen was a prosperous gold mining town until the digging stopped in the 1950s. It then went into sharp decline. However, its quaint streets, tea houses and stunning views of the Pacific Ocean saved it from becoming yet another anonymous mining ghost town. Jiufen is now a popular escape from the capital for those eager to relive scenes from the past. It has provided the setting for several period movies, including Hou Hsiao-hsien's A City of Sadness, which won the Golden Lion award at the 1989 Venice Film Festival.

By train and bus[edit]
From Taipei, take the train north to Ruifang. Buses to Jiufen and Jinguashi leave from a stop a little away from the train station exit: turn left on the busy street in front of the train station, cross to the opposite side of the street and keep walking straight ahead for 200 m until you pass a police station. The bus stop heading to Jiufen and Jinguashi is located a little past it. Then take the Keelung bus 788 (every 20-30 minutes, NT$15, 15-minute ride) or bus 1062 to Jiufen. On their return journey the buses use the same number, and stop in front of the train station square. Another option is to take the 856 bus[dead link] (also known as the Golden Fulong Shuttle Bus). You may purchase a one-day pass (NT$50) for unlimited rides for that day, or pay per trip (adults at NT$15, students at NT$12, and half-price at NT$8 per section). The 856 bus makes stops at a number of tourist attractions including Jiufen, the Gold Museum, and the Golden Waterfall.
From Taipei, take a train to Keelung, then Keelung bus 788 (every 20-30 minutes, NT$30, 45 minute ride) to Jiufen and Jinguashi. This bus passes through Ruifang. In the weekend bus 788 passes by the National Marine Museum of Science and Technology, the end station for the NMMST-Ruifang-Pingxi tourist train line.
Not all buses show the correct route information or have bilingual signs, or are able to adhere to a strict timetable during peak and off-peak hours. On Saturday and Sunday only public buses and cars can enter Jiufen and Jinguashi. Private tour buses, minibuses, vans must park at designated parking lots, which are served by free shuttle buses.

By bus[edit]
From Taipei, take the Highway Bus (Coach) 1062 (90 minutes, NT$102) operated by Keelung bus, from Songshan station (MRT Songshan Exit 2). Make sure to have the exact fare or an Easycard. There are great views of the valleys below on the left-hand side of the bus as it ascends from Ruifang to Jiufen. On days when the bus is likely to be crowded, the bus will fill up there and may not accept other passengers from the first stops.
In lieu of queueing in Songshan, also, consider taking the same bus from the first stop in MRT Zhongxiao Fuxing (Exit 2). Meanwhile, there might have maxi cabs soliciting for car-pooling with a premium of NT$200+/person; however, please note these ride-share services are illegal since not have hire permits, and may not have the necessary protection since the insurance would very likely be invalid in such circumstances.
Alternatively, the New Taipei City Bus 965 (65~90 minutes, NT$90) would rather be the choice for those who stay in West Taipei, operated by Taipei Bus Co., also runs an entire premium coach fleet. The route briefly stops at MRT Fuzhong (Exit 1) and NTPC Banqiao Bus Terminal (Platform 2)/ MRT Banqiao (Exit 2) in Banqiao; and Wanhua Railway Station, MRT Ximen (Exit 2, 150m walk) and MRT Beimen (Exit 2) in the old midtown (Chengzhong) for the downtown area, then dashing across the motorway to reach Ruifang, Jiufen and Jinguashi. The route map is also available here.
