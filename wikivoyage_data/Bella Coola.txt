Bella Coola is a small community along the Central Coast of British Columbia. The entire Bella Coola Valley had a population of 2,010 (2016). Located within the Great Bear Rainforest, it is the only port between Vancouver and Prince Rupert providing road access to the Interior of BC.


Understand[edit]
Bella Coola is a community in the Bella Coola Valley. Bella Coola usually refers to the entire valley, encompassing the settlements of Bella Coola proper ("the townsite") (population approximately 148), Lower Bella Coola, Hagensborg, Salloompt, Nusatsum, Firvale, and Stuie.
The name "Bella Coola" is an exonym and corruption of the Heiltsuk bḷ́xʷlá, meaning "somebody from Bella Coola" or "stranger". The Nuxalk endonym for the local region is Nuxalk, and the endonym for the specific village site of Bella Coola is Q'umk'uts. The name Bella Coola has been used to refer to the entire Bella Coola valley, and at times to the entire ethnic region not to any village in particular. Increasingly the term Nuxalk Territory is used for the entire region, and Bella Coola refers specifically to the river valley.

Bella Coola's climate is a moderate oceanic climate due to its proximity to the Pacific Ocean, falling exactly on the borderline with the warm-summer humid continental climate and close to the warm-summer Mediterranean climate and the warm-summer continental Mediterranean climate (Köppen Dsb). However, its summers are warmer than coastal places much further south due to its semi-inland position. The maritime air is made warmer by the passage of the outer islands, but is stronger in terms of winter moderation. This results in a climate that far belies its northerly latitude in North America.


Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
There is a 454 km (282 mi) mostly paved road connection by Highway 20 to Williams Lake. Construction of the last section of road, known as "the Hill" or the Freedom Road, has become local legend. Built in 1953 by residents of Bella Coola and Anahim Lake because the provincial government wouldn't build it, it features an 18 km (11 mi) ascent from the Valley floor to the Chilcotin Plateau, gaining 1,225 m (4,019 ft) in elevation to the summit at Heckman Pass. "The Hill" is still gravel with a number of steep grades and switchbacks and very few guard rails — some drivers may find it nerve-wracking.   
The drive to/from Williams Lake is approximately 6-8 hours and about 12-14 hours between Bella Coola and Vancouver. 
The few communities near Highway 20 are tiny and consequently the only portions of the highway with mobile wireless service are in Williams Lake and the last 20 km of the highway in and around Bella Coola.
