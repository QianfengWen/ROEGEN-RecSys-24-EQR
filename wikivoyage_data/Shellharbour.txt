Shellharbour Station
-34.59150.841 Shellharbour Junction station is a commuter station with parking and a bus interchange - quite distant from facilities or towns.  It really looks quite in the middle of nowhere getting off the train there.  It is around a 4-km walk to Shellharbour town, going up and down a few hills.
-34.562150.7982 Albion Park Station is outside the town, but quite close to the HARS Aircraft Museum.
If you want to get the bus into town, or to Shellharbour Square, a better bet may be to get off at -34.572150.823 Oak Flats Station and get a bus.  They run with around a 2 hour frequency to town, and quite frequently to Shellharbour Square.  Check the timetable, and get the first bus to Shellharbour Square if it makes sense to do so.

Eat[edit]
Before the Albion Park Rail Bypass of the Princes Mwy was built, traffic was essentially forced to use a short non-freeway section of highway in Albion Park between two freeways. This resulted in many fast-food chains such as Maccas, Subway, Oporto and Taco Bell in addition to local eateries to open up on the southbound section, which gave Albion Park an unusual amount of eateries. If you find it hard to find a good place in the city centre or if many of the restaurants close early (typical for Australia), many fast food chains will still be open in Albion Park.
