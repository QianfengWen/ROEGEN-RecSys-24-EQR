Not to be confused with Las Vegas, the gambling metropol located in Nevada.

Las Vegas is a lovely town in New Mexico in the United States of America. It is an under appreciated gem and a far cry from the Southwestern chic of nearby Santa Fe, with a large collection of historic Victorian homes and other remnants from when Las Vegas was a roaring railroad town. Other attractions include the Montezuma Castle, Storrie Lake, and the New Mexico Highlands University.


Understand[edit]
Map of Las Vegas (New Mexico)
Las Vegas, NM is  not to be confused with the far larger and better known major city of the  same name in Nevada. Within the confines of the northern New Mexico references to Las Vegas or Vegas are understood to refer to the local community. To avoid being considered rude, refer to the other Las Vegas as Las Vegas, Nevada. As the population is 83% Hispanic, expect to overhear Spanish frequently as many people are bilingual.

Get in[edit]
Las Vegas is about 60 miles east of better-known Santa Fe, along Interstate highway 25.  The nearest major commercial airport is in Albuquerque, about 125 miles away. There are public airports in both Santa Fe and Las Vegas that handle non-commercial aircraft. There is Amtrak rail service via the Southwest Chief, the main Amtrak line across the southwestern United States. This stop has no ticket office and no passenger assistance provided by station personnel, though on-board employees will assist passengers between trainside on the platform and the train itself.  There is a waiting room open at train time, within which is a Quik-Trak self-serve ticketing kiosk (credit card required to activate kiosk), so tickets may be obtained at the station before boarding the train. The New Mexico Department of Transportation also offers limited public bus service between Las Vegas and Santa Fe on a commuter schedule.

Get around[edit]
Drive, walk, bike, do what comes easily.  The town is fairly small.

See[edit]
The Plaza Hotel
Las Vegas was an important waypoint on the Santa Fe Trail, and later on the railroad across the Southwest.  There are over 900 structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In the central area of town, it seems almost every single building you see is significant in some way. Walking tour guides are available. Here are some of the highlights:
The 35.5928-105.22681 Plaza, where Las Vegas was founded in 1835. Today it is a shady park with a gazebo, surrounded by historic structures. On the north side of the plaza is the Plaza Hotel, a railroad-era hotel which remains a fine place to spend the night in Las Vegas. Across the street from the southeast corner of the plaza is the old First National Bank.
Railroad District, where the Las Vegas train station is and so much of the city's growth centered around it. The Mission Revival 35.5941-105.21282 La Castaneda Hotel, an old Harvey House hotel, is definitely worth a look.
35.5928-105.21613 Lincoln Park, a local park surrounded by lots of beautiful old homes.
Douglas/6th Street District, once the central business area of Las Vegas, today there's plenty of interesting buildings here like the 35.594-105.21764 Bank of Las Vegas, the Old City Hall, and the 35.5936-105.21755 Masonic Temple.
35.5977-105.21616 Carnegie Park, an area of town centered around Carnegie Park, which has a Carnegie Library that was modeled after Thomas Jefferson's home, the Monticello. The surrounding blocks are filled with old Victorian homes.

Montezuma Castle
North of Las Vegas on SR-65 (Hot Springs Blvd) is the town of Montezuma and the Armand Hammer United World College of the American West. On the campus is the gorgeous 35.6559-105.28138 Montezuma Castle, which was built as a railroad hotel and served a number of purposes before becoming part of the United World College campus. It is open for free tours, which start at 1PM on certain Saturdays and are led by students of the college. But even if you don't get inside the building, it's worth the drive up to at least see it.
Do[edit]

There are viewing platforms and a few short trails. Best visited in late fall and early spring, when migratory birds are passing through; winter can be bleak and summer hot, and the resident population of wildlife isn't as great as the number of seasonal transients. Entry to the Refuge as well as McAllister Lake are free.   (updated Dec 2021)

A classic drive-in theater from the 1950s that has managed to survive and still shows double features on summer weekends.

There are interpretive exhibits and a 1.6-mile trail among the ruins. Day use, 7 days a week (closed Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years); $3 fee, Park Pass applies.  There are no services near the monument.
Santa Fe National Forest popular destinations near Las Vegas include Gallinas Canyon and Pecos Wilderness.  The Pecos/Las Vegas Ranger District has full details.
Pecos is a small town just off I-25 between Las Vegas and Santa Fe, and is the home of the Pecos National Historic Park, a small NPS site that preserves the ruins of an abandoned Indian pueblo and Spanish mission from the 17th century, as well as the Glorieta Pass Battlefield, site of a major Civil War battle in the West.
Historic Route 66 (the "original" version) passed just southwest of town.  Check its  itinerary page for ideas on things to do as you move on from Las Vegas to your next destination east or south.
Villanueva State Park is located 38 miles southwest of town. Take I-25 to the Villanueva exit and drive south 15 miles.
