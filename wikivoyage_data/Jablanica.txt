Jablanica is a town in Herzegovina on the lake which bears its name, and along the Neretva River. It is known for the railway bridge over the Neretva that was destroyed by partisans during the Second World War, and for its necropolises in the Risovac settlement which are one of the three recognized  UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the country.

While Jablanica itself does not offer overwhelmingly many sights and activities for travellers and tourists, the surrounding mountains offer some great hikes, views and adventures.

History[edit]
The Jablanica area has the scene of human activity since the bronze age, and flourished during the Roman era and Middle Ages, as evidenced by 42 sites with 683 necropolises with stećak tombs. The region acquired its wealth from caravans between Dubrovnik and Bosnia, crossing through the Vbras valley. The first census in 1477 recorded 3 villages in and around Jablanica (Žuglići, Ostrožac and Čehari), and the second census in 1488/89 reported a total of 67 homes with a mixed Christian and Muslim population. During the Ottoman period, the region of Jablanica received little attention, with Konjic receiving funding for hans and roads instead. Urbanization began in the Austro-Hungarian period with the construction of bridges, tunnels, houses and apartments, and a railway station.
Today, Jablanica is an oasis of rest and a popular holiday destination for locals and foreigners on the way from Konjic to Mostar. The town is powered by Neretvan hydroelectricity, and stone masonry remains an important economic activity.

Orientation[edit]
Jablanica and its surrounding villages are located in the Vrbas valley.

Get in[edit]
43.65291917.763851 Jablanica railway station (Jablanica Grad).  (updated Mar 2023)
43.6581617.76252 Jablanica bus station. (updated Mar 2023)
The easiest way to get into Jablanica is either by bus or train from Konjic, Mostar or Sarajevo.
Also hitchhiking is possible.
Despite forming an at places narrow canyon, the Neretva Valley is mostly flat so it is also possible to reach Jablanica from Konjic or Mostar by bicycle. However, there are no provisions for cyclists, and the main road is too dangerous due to Bosnian traffic.

Get around[edit]
Jablanica is fairly small, and all locations of touristic value can be reached by foot.

See[edit]
Jablanica is best known for the railway bridge sabotaged by the partisan resistance during the Second World War in an effort to defend against the invading Nazi forces. The bridge and the nearby museum are the most important tourist attractions.

Remains of the railway bridge over the Neretva river.
43.6540217.762161 Railway Bridge (Srušeni most). 24/7. The original bridge was the scene of a battle during World War II between the Nazi occupation force and Yugoslav partisans under leadership of Joseph Tito. When the partisans found themselves surrounded in Jablanica, they staged an ingenious deception by blowing up the bridge themselves rather than defending it against an overwhelming Nazi invasion force with several armored divisions, a battle they could not win. German air reconnaissance reported that the bridge was sabotaged and concluded a diversion maneuver with an expected attack to the north instead, directing their main force away from the area. The slightly damaged bridge was subsequently repaired by partisan forces to cross the Neretva at Jablanica. Despite seeing through the partisan plan quickly, the Chetnik defenders were caught off guard and sustained heavy losses. By the time the German Luftwaffe provided air support, Tito's partisan forces had already crossed the Neretva. The repaired bridge was destroyed a second time by German bombardment. In 1969, Tito (then president of Yugoslavia) authorized a multi million dollar film production depicting the events at the Neretva railway bridge. Battle of Neretva by Bosnian director Veljko Bulajić spared no expenses, with a 10,000 men strong battalion of the Yugoslav Army participating and several actual Soviet tanks being destroyed for the film. The railway bridge was rebuilt for the film twice, and subsequently also destroyed twice, to get the perfect shot for the film. Because of the thick smoke caused by the explosions, the footage wasn't used in the film; the scene was instead shot on a replica of the bridge built in a film studio in Prague. The remains of the bridge in the Neretva, along with a train used in the film, were left on site as a tourist attraction and can be visited. A path leads down to a viewing platform, which gives visitors a closer view on the bridge remains. Free.   (updated Sep 2017)

There are an estimated 60,000 tombstones in Bosnia, the first of which appeared in the mid 12th century during the Middle Ages. The tombstones reached their peak in the 14th and 15th century, before gradually disappearing during the Ottoman occupation in the early 16th century.

Hiking[edit]
Hajdučka vrata
Blidinje Mountain Natural Park (SW): 43.653317.56731 Risovac–43.62734517.6195064 Veliki Vilinac–43.63039517.6549855 Hajdučka vrata–43.5787917.719511 M17
Hiking from Risovac back to Jablanica is a medium-difficulty 1-2-days hike. It is best done in this direction, because it is easy to get a lift to Risovac, and from there the altitude is descreasing. There are several ways to start or to end the trek. E.g. in case you cannot find a lift to Risovac, you might just want to hike straight into the mountains about 3 km after having left Jablanica on the road towards Risovac.
In Risovac, you can have a sightseeing stop at the 43.66326317.5431356 Dugo Polje Necropolis, and along the trail the impressive rock arch Hajdučka vrata can be visited.
