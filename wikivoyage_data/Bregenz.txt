Shore of Lake Constance at Bregenz
Bregenz is the capital of Vorarlberg in Austria at the Lake Constance. The shore of Lake Constance, one of the biggest lakes in Europe, meets with the town centre. Go down to the lake in the evening and check out the beautiful sunset. 


Understand[edit]
Bregenz has 29,000 inhabitants (2022) and its roots go back to Roman times. The city was founded by the Romans in 15 BC, when it was known as Brigantium. 
Bregenz sits at the northern edge of the Alps, between Lake Constance (the Bodensee) and the Pfänder (1064 m). To the west lies the Rhine delta, a huge valley dividing Switzerland and Austria. To the south lie the mountains of Switzerland and southern Vorarlberg. To the north, overlooking Lake Constance, are the hills of  Allgäu of Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria in Germany.
Bregenz is the capital of Austria's most modern province. Inhabitants of Vorarlberg are said to be much more friendly and open than the rest of Austria.

Munich (MUC IATA) is the biggest airport around. About 2½ hr to Bregenz.
Altenrhein (ACH IATA): Switzerland, about 20 km to Bregenz but few connections to Vienna.

By train[edit]
47.5023669.7398031 Central Station (Hauptbahnhof), Fritz-Mayer-Platz 1 (in the north, near the lake and city centre). Ticket counter: M-F 06:30-19:00, Sa Su 07:30-19:00; ticket automats: 24 hr.

In general the Eurocity trains are faster than the Intercity trains. There is also a high-speed train called 'Railjet Express; the price from Vienna to Bregenz is between €50 and €150, depending on how far in advance you book. Use ÖBB's SCOTTY to look up train information online. Storage lockers available.From Switzerland, France and northwestern Italy, the best option is to go to via Zürich and take a Railjet train to Bregenz.

Average travel time is 7 hours from Vienna and quality of travel in a Railjet is superior.   (updated Oct 2023)
By car[edit]
From direction Vienna: on the A1 via Salzburg via Germany. In Rosenheim (Germany), you have to decide if you drive via Munich (heavy traffic) or via Innsbruck (Arlberg Tunnel €11).
From Chur/Zürich: about 10 km to the Swiss motorway.
Austria requires autobahn drivers to pay a fee and purchase a Vignette (Austrian: Pickerl), a sticker which must be affixed to the windshield. Vignettes are available for €9.99 (10 days), €29 (2 months), and €96.40 (1 year); prices for motocycles are approximately 55% less. Careful: The Vignette is only valid 18 days after the purchase. The fine for not having a vignette is €120, payable on the spot (if you can't pay on the spot it goes up to €300). The well-known tactic of affixing vignettes with Vaseline (so that they can be easily removed and re-used) earns a fine of €240. The vignette must be pasted on the windshield; they are considered invalid if kept in the glovebox, which also earns a fine. The vignettes are available for sale at ADAC, ÖAMTC and TCS motor club offices (in Germany, Austria and Switzerland respectively; membership is not required), as well as at almost all petrol stations before the Austrian border. You can purchase them here.The more affordable so-called Korridorvignette for the 23-km-long stretch of the A14 between the German border and Hohenems is no longer available.
Drivers from Germany should take Exit 2 (Lindau) before reaching the border, as the A14 then enters a tunnel and only emerges south of Bregenz. Likewise when driving toward Germany drivers should head north on 190 and cross the border before driving onto the autobahn.

It later changed ownership several times and in the 17th century it was extended into a stronghold. In 1647 it was captured by the Swedes without any resistance and they blew up the fortress in the same year. From 1670 the ruins gained importance as a place of pilgrimage of St. Gebhard and they were adapted for religious and gastronomical purposes several times. In 1723 the church, which was built within the ruins, was consecrated. In this time the "mountain" got its present name. There is a restaurant there now.
