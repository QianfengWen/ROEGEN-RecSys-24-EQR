Mount Hood reflected in Mirror Lake
Mount Hood (height 11,249 feet) is the highest mountain in the state of Oregon and a major outdoor recreation site in the Pacific Northwest. Located about 50 miles (80 km) east-southeast of Portland, the mountain is visible from the city on clear days and usually forms the backdrop for the Portland skyline in postcards and photographs of the city.
It is a volcano of the conical stratovolcano type. It last erupted in 1907 and the last major eruption was in 1781-82.

There are many things to do including downhill skiing and snowboarding, hiking, and cross country skiing.

Skiing and Snowboarding: Mount Hood is home to three skiing and snowboarding resorts: Mount Hood Meadows, Timberline Lodge, and Ski Bowl[dead link], as well as the two lesser known Summit Ski Area and Cooper Spur.  Mount Hood has the only ski area in North America that is open 12 months of the year and Ski Bowl has the largest night skiing area in America. There are a number of ski and snowboard camps offered. It is best to contact each resort to find out the details.
Mount Hood Meadows (operates November through April or May) offers four high speed quad lifts (and 5 other lifts), including the Cascade Express, which climbs to an elevation of 7,300 feet. The lifts are open daily 9AM-4PM, with night skiing until 9PM on Fridays and Saturdays. For those with limited skiing and snowboarding abilities, Meadows also offers the "Groove Tube" tubing hill on certain days for $5  and includes tube rental. As a side note, Meadows also the hosts local High School Snowboard Club/Team competitions.
Timberline (year round, except maintenance closure 2 weeks following Labor Day) offers four express quad chairlifts (and two other lifts), including the Palmer Chairlift, which reaches an elevation of 8,540 feet. Timberline is able to offer skiing and snowboarding 12 months out of the year, boasting the longest season in North America.  Lift hours are 9AM-10PM Winter weekends, 9AM-4PM weekdays and after Spring break; 8AM-3PM late Spring; 7AM-1:30PM Summer.  Timberline Lodge is a registered National Historic Landmark.

The Pacific Crest Trail is a 2,650 mile footpath which follows the Cascades and Sierra Nevada mountains from Canada to Mexico and passes around the west side of Mount Hood.  It traverses one-tenth mile above Timberline Lodge and descends between Timberline Lodge and Mount Hood Meadows to continue southward toward Timothy Lake.
Timberline Trail is a 40+ mile loop hiking and equestrian path around Mount Hood mostly in protected wilderness, with a variety of magnificent vistas, primitive river crossings, alpine meadows, wildflowers, and dense forest.  17 miles of the Timberline Trail coincides with the Pacific Crest Trail.

Eat[edit]
 El Burro Loco, 67211 E Hwy 26, ☏ +1 503 622-6780. Definitely some of the better, and quite authentic Mexican to be found anywhere near this region. Some of the menu, of course, strays from the authentic, but in a very fun direction—think boar carnitas (or just some ribs). $10-22. 
 Skyway Bar & Grill, 71545 E Hwy 26, ☏ +1 503 622-3775. W-F 3PM-2:30AM, Sa-Su noon-2:30AM. Traditional American food: burgers, salmon, chicken, sandwiches, BBQ, mac 'n' cheese—in an extremely quirky, but very cool building (heck, the name of the community is Zigzag!). Frequent live music, with the calendar posted online. $6-15.

The Shining
Timberline Lodge is the infamous lodge used in the 1980 Stephen King horror classic, The Shining, directed by Stanley Kubrick and starring Jack Nicholson. However, only a few exterior shots in the movie are actually from the hotel - on the inside it looks completely different. Room 227 doesn't exist, nor does the ballroom. Room rates start at $90, not including tax or creepy old ladies in the bathroom.

Stay safe[edit]
Always check the local weather before heading up to the mountain. It is not uncommon for chains or snow tires to be advised or required. While there are snow plows as well as other precautions, it never hurts to be on the safe side.
If you are planning a hike or skiing adventure into areas less traveled it is advised to take a Personal Location Transponder. If you should become lost, injured, or trapped this device will help emergency crews to locate you quickly via a GPS signal. The technology can now locate you to within 10 feet of your actual placement, a great accessory for snow enthusiasts in avalanche zones.
