Sidmouth Sea front
Sidmouth is a seaside resort town in East Devon. Host to an international folk festival for one week every year, for the other 51 weeks, Sidmouth is a very pleasant but small beach-side town. The town has a long stony beach and a vibrant and surprisingly diverse town centre, with a large number of quality independent shops, cafés and restaurants.

It's easy to walk around this compact town. Driving and parking are easy enough off-season, but in summer months can be a lot more challenging. There is a 'park and walk' service from the council offices on station road, which involves a 15-minute walk into town

Events[edit]
50.679299-3.2349961 Sidmouth Folk Week. A significant feature of Sidmouth is this week-long Folk Festival, which takes place during the first week in August every year. The event is remarkable, but free activities are becoming increasingly scarce. Nevertheless, the bustling seafront promenade, thick with musicians performing for change or simply for pleasure, is an enjoyable experience for all.   (updated Mar 2018)
Buy[edit]
Eat[edit]
Despite its size, Sidmouth is something of a foodie town, with several delicatessens and at least one of each kind of artisan food store: bakeries, butchers, greengrocers and fishmongers. 

 Haymens Butchers. It offers a good range of (mostly) meat-based take-away options. Good old-fashioned shop, great value (they do some great cakes for 50p!) and deserved 'Taste of the West' award winners. Highly recommended. The centre of the town has many cafes and restaurants. 
 Sidmouth Trawlers. Not only a good fishmongers in its own right, selling locally caught fish and shellfish, it's also great for lunchtime snacks. The fresh fish baps are popular and delicious, as are the sandwiches (tuna, prawn, Lyme Bay crabmeat...), or why not try an old-fashioned seaside treat, a pot of vinegary cockles. 
The town's restaurants are of generally good quality, and most inevitably have a fishy theme to their menus. 

50.679393-3.2379091 White Horse, Old Fore St, EX10 8LP (From the Market Square walk away from the sea past The Anchor and it's on your left). Fish, chips, etc. to take away or sit in and eat. 
Late afternoon is a good time to grab a "cream tea". Several cafes offer this including The Clock House (at Connaught Gardens), The Chattery and Libra Court.
