Nabiac is a town of 1,294 (2021) in the Mid-North Coast region of New South Wales, and lies about halfway between Coolongolook and Taree on the Pacific Highway. There isn't anything too remarkable about Nabiac, but it contains the rather-small National Motorcycle Museum.


Understand[edit]
Get in[edit]
Nabiac is on the Pacific Highway, about 140 km (87 mi) north of Newcastle and 30 km (19 mi) south of Taree. If you're heading northbound, take the Wallanbah Road exit and then loop around towards where all the businesses are. If you're heading southbound, use the Nabiac St exit and then immediately turn left after the exit.
