Map of Brahmapur
The main mode of transportation in Brahmapur is the auto-rickshaw and taxis. Cycle rickshaws are also available, and are slower but cheaper. You should ask for the price up front, and are expected to bargain.
The centre of town is called the Old Bus Stand Barracks. Located around the Old Bus Stand or Barracks are the five largest hotels in town, Nandan International, Spectrum, Bhubaneswari Classic, Radha and Jyoti Residency. In front of these hotels, you can find taxis. They are more expensive than auto-rickshaws, but more comfortable for longer drives. Again, expect to bargain for your fare up front.

Drink[edit]
Brahmapur is a fairly conservative Indian city, so bars are very rare, almost exclusively for men, and pretty shady. The 'nicest' bar is probably Regency Bar, between Nandan Hotel and Jyoti Residency. Note that women are very rarely patrons of these establishments, and may be refused service altogether. It is not recommended for solo female travellers to go into these bars. Restaurants and hotels do not serve alcohol.

Stay safe[edit]
The biggest hazard in Brahmapur comes from the chaotic traffic. Make sure to look both sides before crossing a street, even in a one-way street!
Although Brahmapur is not a tourist city, make sure to keep your belongings close to you and in a safe place, particularly around the train station or the Old Bus Stand.
There is a police station right next to the Old Bus Stand, in front of Nandan Hotel.

Respect[edit]
Brahmapur is a traditional Indian city. Make sure to wear culturally-appropriate clothes, especially if you are a woman. You won't get in trouble if you don't, but you might attract a lot of unwanted attention from men.
The people may approach you, asking for your name and nationality, and wanting to shake your hand. As a rule, these are not people out to scam you in any way, just curious, friendly people. Take the time to chat with them, and try and make a good impression! Don't feel obliged to agree to anything that makes you uncomfortable.

Cope[edit]
The city can get very hot in the hot season, between March to June. The winter (October to February) is the best time to visit, with dry, cool evenings and very few rain. In the monsoon season (June to October), streets can get flooded with rainwater. 
Like many places in India, although there is a lot of delicious street and restaurant food around the city, not all of them are clean and hygienic. Make sure to observe stalls or restaurants, and only go to those with a lot of people, and that inspire you to eat there. Make sure to regularly wash your hands, especially before meals. If you fall ill, there are a number of pharmacies and health stores around the city where you can get medicine.
