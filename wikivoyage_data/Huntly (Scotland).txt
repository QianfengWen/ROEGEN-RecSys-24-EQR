Huntly is a small town in Aberdeenshire in North East Scotland; in bygone times it was more snappily known as "Milton of Strathbogie". With a population of 4810 in 2016, Huntly is nowadays a commuter town for Aberdeen, as it's on the railway. The main reason to visit is the ruined castle.
This page also takes in Rhynie, often the butt of comedy for its rural obscurity, yet once the seat of Pictish kings.

57.351-2.8594 Tap o' Noth 8 km south of Huntly was long thought to be a volcanic crater. But it turned out to be a prehistoric fortified settlement of 800 huts, which at some stage burned so fiercely that the hillfort walls became vitrified. Some artifacts date to 2000 BC, but its heyday was later in Pictish times. Access is from the car park south on A941.
Rhynie is the small village south of the hillfort. Druminor Castle is an impressive tower house but it's a private residence, no tours. The Craw Stane is a granite slab with Pictish inscriptions: go south half a mile from the village and look east. Another, the "Rhynie Man", now graces the Aberdeenshire Council offices in the city. Other findings include a post-Roman amphora, and evidence of wine drinking, from 500-700 AD when the village may have been the seat of Pictish kings. But in the 1990s comedy review Scotland the What?, which mocked Aberdeenshire's lumpen agricultural ways, Rhynie was a frequent target. How does it have a Station Hotel yet no railway or station? - "Aw, but they were aye hopin' for one."
St Mary's Kirk 2 miles south of Rhynie is the substantial ruin of a 13th-century church. It remained in use to 1810 with its original Romanesque features little altered.
See Strathdon for sights further south, such as Kildrummy Castle.
