History[edit]
Tegueste has been inhabited since the Guanche era, with archaeological remains of found in the Agua de Dios ravine, more specifically at Los Cabezazos. The town resisted Spanish invasion, but was eventually conquered in 1496, and the land divided among Spanish settlers. The city is constructed around the earliest cultural heritage of this period, known as the Tegueste el Viejo, around the Plaza de La Arañita.
Since 1813, Tegueste has been an independent municipality. It has a steadily growing population which quadrupled in the 20th century to a total of 11,000 inhabitants. Its economy is traditionally agricultural, with a focus on vegetables and vineyards, and some livestock.
