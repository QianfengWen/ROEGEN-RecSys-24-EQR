Hayward is a city in Alameda County in the San Francisco Bay Area region of California located next to the San Francisco Bay.
Hayward is located near premier tourist locations (San Francisco), first rate educational institutions (Berkeley and Stanford), and an economic powerhouse (Silicon Valley), however relatively speaking Hayward does not have as much to offer as its neighbors.  Even so, its central location may make it a very economical home base for tourists and commuters, and its panoramic views of the Bay alone are worth the side trip for visitors.
On paper, the landscape of this city of 163,000 people (2020) sounds nearly perfect.  Hayward boasts of a central bay shoreline, a quaint city center with a small town feel in the city flatlands, hills which overlook the bay, and a hub of highways that connect everywhere in the bay area to the inland areas of California.  Unfortunately the shoreline is mostly filled with warehouses and marshland, and the city center is slightly run down, although it is slowly being renovated.

Today the lagoon is supplied with water from EBMUD, and a large shallow area is roped off especially for children. The adjacent lake is closed to boating and swimming, but hikers along the shore will discover a surprising wilderness in miniature, where turtles and frogs splash in the water, ducks rest in the reeds and raccoons and deer come down to drink at sunset. Parking and dog fee collected weekends and holidays..

Cinema place downtown has 3, and 2 long murals are next to Jackson/92, towards downtown. 
Do[edit]
Hayward Shoreline Interpretive Center
Hayward is home to the CSUEB, the California State University East Bay. The highlight of Hayward is in the beautiful panoramic views of the bay which can be seen from and near the university in the hills. Visitors anywhere in the bay should definitely take this detour. From the Hayward hills, one can see Fremont, Silicon Valley, Oakland and San Francisco at once.
The drive from Hayward/Castro Valley to Oakland on Redwood Road is quite beautiful. This road is usually empty, and has the feel of being in a remote area despite the fact that it is near the bay. Beware of the cyclists and the Import racers that frequent Redwood Road.

37.623113-122.1378311 Hayward Shoreline Interpretive Center, 4901 Breakwater Av, ☏ +1 510 670-7270, hayshore@aol.com. F-Su 10AM-5PM.

Buy[edit]
The best shopping in the Bay Area is found in the cities of Berkeley, Oakland, San Francisco, and San Jose.  The downtown lost a lot of its smaller businesses when Southland Mall opened off of 880, which is a fine place for mall and big box store shopping. Cinema Place in downtown on B Street is a new theater with shopping and restaurants.
Every Saturday at Main St. and B St. 9AM-1PM the Hayward Farmers Market is held.
Southland Mall is a large sized old fashioned mall, with a central closed building, and satellite businesses, including some good restaurants like Elephant Bar. Anchor stores include Sears, Macy's.

 Hayward Farmers Market (downtown Hayward). Saturday mornings. (updated Jun 2024)
Eat[edit]
Although the overall number of restaurants in Hayward is respectable by the standards of most cities in the United States, the choices are disappointing compared to those in nearby gourmet powerhouses Berkeley and Oakland. The advantages here: plentiful parking, lower prices, shorter waits. Most of the Mexican restaurants, especially the taquerias, are excellent inexpensive places to chow down on authentic, if non-gourmet, traditional dishes. If you choose to find a place to eat in Hayward, the city center is normally the best place to go, though many eateries can be found all around Hayward. You can also find food on Mission, Jackson, and Foothill Blvds.
There are also the usual chain restaurants including Dominoes, Taco Bell, McDonald's, The International House of Pancakes, and so on.

Like most cities in the United States, Hayward does have its rougher areas. Most of these are small areas right off of the five main streets in Hayward that run east to west. (A St, Winton Ave, Jackson St, Tennyson Ave, and Industrial Blvd.)

Connect[edit]
The City has a free Wi-Fi network or "Hot Spot" for the Downtown area. This area of coverage is approximate and may vary in strength and availability and best reception is found at the Main Hayward Public Library (835 "C" Street). The City does not provide technical support for this Wi-Fi system.

Due to its central location it is easy to get to most parts of the Bay Area using a car, BART, or Amtrak.
