Parque Central in Liberia
Liberia is the capital city of the Guanacaste province of Costa Rica. It is located about 220 km (138 mi) Northwest San Jose. 
After Mexico's War of Independence from Spain, the settlement of Guanacaste, as Liberia was known then, transitioned from being a town in the Partido de Nicoya of the Federal Republic of Central America to being part of Nicaragua and then Costa Rica. Even though this happened later than the annexation of the rival town of Nicoya on July 25th, 1824, Liberia celebrates that day annually as it became the primary settlement of the Guanacaste province.
Liberia's economy centers around agriculture and tourism with the nearby coast and volcanic regions. Even though precipitation is relatively less than other parts of Costa Rica, it can still feel sweltering with an average temperature of 27 degrees Celsius.
