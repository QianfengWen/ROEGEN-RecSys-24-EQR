Naha (那覇) is the capital of the Okinawa Prefecture in Japan and is the main city on Okinawa Island. It has a population of around 317,000 (2019), which is about a quarter of the total population of the island.


Understand[edit]
The first castle at Shuri (首里) was built in the 1200s.  When king Shō Hashi unified the island and founded the Ryukyu Kingdom in 1429, he made Shuri his capital, a role it retained for almost 450 years.  Naha was originally a trade port a short distance to the west of Shuri, only becoming the official capital in 1872 when the Kingdom was abolished.
Alas, it's difficult to see any traces of this lengthy history, since both Naha and Shuri were largely destroyed during the Battle of Okinawa in 1945.  Today's Naha is an unappealing congested concrete sprawl that by and large looks like any other Japanese provincial city, only with worse traffic and more palm trees sprinkled in, and the few historical sites like Shuri Castle are reconstructions.

Tourist offices[edit]

By plane[edit]
26.195833127.6458331 Naha Airport (那覇空港 Naha-kūkō, OKA  IATA). The largest airport in the Okinawa area and the main hub for international and inter-island flights. A monorail connects the airport to the city center. Don't confuse it with the Naha Airport (NAH IATA) in Indonesia.   
Okinawa being a car-centric island, many people rent cars at Naha Airport, but the rental offices are all off-site: you'll be directed into shuttle buses that trundle their way through the jams of suburban Naha, which can easily take half an hour one way.  On the way back, allow plenty of time for dropping off your car as well.
If you have time to kill at the airport, there are half a dozen only mildly overpriced restaurants landside on the 4th floor.  After you've gone through security, it's very slim pickings indeed even on the much larger domestic side.

By ship[edit]
Ferry services to Okinawa have been cut drastically, with Arimura Sangyo filing for bankruptcy and RKK Line stopping passenger services entirely. With long travel times, bumpy seas, frequent cancellations in the fall typhoon season and prices similar to flying, it's easy to see why this isn't too popular anymore.
As of 2014, the only survivors are A-Line Ferry, aka Maru-A (マルエー), which runs twice a week from Kagoshima (25 hours, ¥16,000 2nd class one-way) and once a week from both Osaka/Kobe and Tokyo (44 hours, ¥28,000) to Naha, and Marix Line, which runs between Kagoshima and Naha only. All ferries call at various minor islands including Yoron and Amami Oshima along the way. If you don't speak Japanese, you will find it easier to book through a travel agent.

Get around[edit]
Yui-rail
The Yui-rail (aka Okinawa City Monorail) (monorail website in Japanese only) links the airport, the city and Shuri Castle.  Tickets cost ¥230-370 depending on distance, or you can get a 24 hour pass for ¥800.  You can also get a 48 hour pass for ¥1,400 (2024). There are also many buses that travel throughout the city to every area.

See[edit]

26.217127.71951 Shuri Castle (首里城; Shuri-jō) (monorail Shuri Station). Shuri Castle has partially re-opened after most of the structures were destroyed by a fire on the morning of 31 October 2019. This World Heritage Site is the former seat of the Ryukyu Kingdom, built in the Okinawan gusuku style. Completely destroyed during World War II, the buildings were rebuilt in 1958 and 1992. No original Ryukyuan castles remain and this is the only site where the castle keep has been rebuilt, so it's an important part of preserving Okinawan history and culture. The site is wrapped in scaffolding, but authorities are hoping to reopen at least the exterior of the main building by 2025. See also Japanese castles.   
26.218103127.7172982 Sonohyan-Utaki (園比屋武御嶽). Although it is in Shuri Castle Park, this sacred grove of trees and plants (utaki) is independently famous as one of Okinawa's World Heritage listings.
