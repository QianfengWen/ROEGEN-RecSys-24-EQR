Leamington is a municipality of about 30,000 people (2021) in Essex County, Ontario, and the southern-most city in Canada.


Understand[edit]

Leamington lies on the 42nd northern parallel, the same latitude as Chicago, Boston, the northern border of California, Rome, and Zaragoza. It borders Point Pelee National Park and Lake Erie. The climate is milder than cities further north, like Toronto.
It is billed as the "Tomato Capital of Canada". In 1908, the H. J. Heinz company came to Leamington, bringing many jobs to the area and contributing to Leamington's growth. The factory operated until 2014 and employed 740 people. Tomato juice and tomato paste maker Highbury Canco still employs a few hundred at the former Heinz facility, which still processes much of Leamington's local tomato crop.

History[edit]
Leamington, viewed from Point Pelee National Park
The community was named after Royal Leamington Spa in England, after having been called "Gainesville" or "Gainesborough" for local mill owner William Gaines, and before that, Wilkinson Corners.
It was a crossroads hamlet with about 300 residents, and was known for its lumber products rather than its tomatoes. There were several docks, and fish were plentiful in Lake Erie, so much so that sturgeon could be speared from the shore, and fish was the cheapest food available. Leamington once had many tobacco farms, but now they are virtually nonexistent.

Birding[edit]
Leamington is on the north shore of Lake Erie and is home to Point Pelee National Park, a major site for migrating birds especially in the autumn. As such, it plays host to many birdwatchers from Canada, the United States, and all around the world. The region is also known for the migration of monarch butterflies, which congregate in the fall at Point Pelee before making their way across Lake Erie on their route to winter quarters in central Mexico.
Another important natural area near Leamington is the wetland at Hillman Marsh, 6 km east of the town.
