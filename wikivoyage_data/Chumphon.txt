Chumphon (ชุมพร) is a city and a province of the same name on the Central Gulf Coast of Southern Thailand. With its transport hub of Chumphon Airport in Pathio District, Chumphon is the gateway to the south and the islands of the Gulf of Thailand.


Understand[edit]
Chumphon Province is in the upper part of Southern Thailand. The province is symbolised by the Banyan tree often referred to as sacred in both Hindu and Buddhist teachings. It is a gateway to the popular Gulf of Thailand islands of Ko Samui, Ko Phangan, Ko Tao, and Ko Khai. In particular, taking the ferry from Chumphon is the fastest way to get to Ko Tao.

Get in[edit]
The public bus service operates from two terminals. The main one is some 10 km out of town, and buses from Bangkok and most other places stop there. The other terminal is in town, and buses from there go to and from Hat Yai/Phuket/Ranong only. They stop at the distant terminal both coming and going. There is another bus terminal in town that goes to Bangkok. It's called Chok Anan tour and it's near the fresh market, opposite the 7-Eleven and just by the DIY store.
The railway station is in the centre of Chumphon town or travelers may wish to alight at Pathio station 30 km north of Chumphon if they are headed to the airport, which is only 7 km away.
Various ferry companies operate ferries to, or within reach of Chumphon, and/or a bus service into the centre of town. For those in the gulf islands wishing to return to Bangkok, Chumphon is much more direct than returning via Surat Thani.

By plane[edit]
