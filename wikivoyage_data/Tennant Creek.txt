Tennant Creek is a town in the Northern Territory of Australia. It has a population of around 3,500. It is known as the Territory’s heart of gold mainly due to the people, but also in reference to the gold mining history.


Understand[edit]
Paterson Street, Tennant Creek
Tennant Creek in Central Australia sits on the Explorer’s Way, 500km north of Alice Springs and 1000km south of Darwin. The town is surrounded to the east by the Barkly Tablelands - a huge expanse of land that supports some of Australia’s premier outback cattle stations. Tennant Creek sits in the middle of the outback, but the country is beautiful and anything but barren. The town is situated in open mallee scrubland, surrounded by rocky ranges and brilliant blue skies that give way to millions of stars at night.
Prior to the gold rush era, Tennant Creek’s first European residents were workers on the Overland Telegraph Line, which established a communication link between Australia and the rest of the world. The Telegraph Station was built in 1872, and this historical collection of stone buildings can be explored today.
Aboriginal culture is strong in Tennant Creek. The traditional land owners of this area are the Aboriginal Warumungu people, and they recognise a number of sacred sites in the area, including the region’s most famous landmark – the Devils Marbles – about 100km south of the town. The Pebbles (known as Kunjarra) are another granite outcrop formation, just north of the town, and it's also a sacred site for the Warumungu people. The Nyinkka Nyunyu Culture Centre in Tennant Creek is an award-winning Aboriginal attraction that showcases the people’s stories and art. The Barkly region is steeped in the ancient traditions and beliefs of its traditional custodians, and around nine Aboriginal groups call the area home, including the Warumungu, Walpiri, Kaiditch and Alyawarr people.
The air is fresh and clean here and the colours of the landscape are ever-changing as the rocky hillsides pick up the varying sun's rays between daybreak and evening.
A number of walking trails throughout the region allow travellers to experience the plants, birds and landscapes of Tennant Creek up close. One walking path winds its way through the Honeymoon Ranges to Lake Mary Ann, five kilometres north-east of the town, and the perfect spot for a swim and a picnic.
Adventure lovers have plenty of options in the Tennant Creek area. Four-wheel-drivers in particular are spoilt for choice with the plethora of moderate to challenging tracks available to test their skills and their vehicles. The Davenport Range National Park is an excellent four-wheel-drive destination and there are plenty of nooks and crannies to explore. The Old Police Station Waterhole, located on the Frew River, is the park's best known attraction, and the moderately challenging Frew River Four Wheel Drive Loop Track is an exciting alternative route in. It's a rocky, 17-kilometre track with several kilometres along the ridgeline, which affords spectacular vistas. This is just one of the four-wheel-drive tracks in the region.
Camping in Tennant Creek is an adventure in itself. There are caravan parks and camp grounds in town, but for a real feeling of isolation, where there are no creature comforts, pack up the car and try one of the region's bush camping sites in the peace and quiet of the outback - make sure you take all your own supplies.
Why not aim to go home in style after you discover your fortune in Tennant Creek? There are a number of sites in this area where people can fossick for their own gold - and apparently there's still plenty here to be found.
Another adventurous pursuit in this area is experiencing life on an outback cattle station. Travellers can camp at Banka Banka Station, an operating station 100km to the town's north.

Crime in Tennant Creek is high. It is one of Australia's most dangerous towns, with a murder/manslaughter rate 30 times higher than the national average of the United States. The most common types of crime include pick-pocketing, car vandalism, theft, break-ins – avoid bottle shops, as much of this is alcohol-fueled. Although there is a high police presence in the small town, take extra precautions and avoid public areas at night.

Newcastle Waters Historic Township Located at the junction of three major overland stock routes, Newcastle Waters was an important gathering place for drovers to provision and rest before continuing on with their gruelling overland cattle drives. The township has become a ghost town, but while uninhabited, Newcastle Waters has a rich, vibrant history. Preserved historic buildings such as Jones's Store and the Junction Hotel are a reminder of the early pioneering era. The Drover's Memorial Park, featuring a bronze statue of a drover, is also a must see. Access is through Newcastle Waters Station. Please observe all station rules that apply.

It is a worthwhile diversion from the drive, famous for its bush hospitality, huge meals and quirky decorations on the walls.
