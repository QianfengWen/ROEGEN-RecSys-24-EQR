History[edit]
Lancaster is home to a very diverse group of people. It is a strong agricultural town with various farmlands, lush vegetation and great produce all over. This is because the Amish dwell in and around Lancaster's many townships. The Amish are fairly isolated from the rest of the community, but they are acknowledged, respected, and not bothered. They are masters of farming and simple living, for they don't use electricity. They teach in their own schools, and they have their own churches. They get around by horse and buggy and they are easily seen, wearing black suits, hats, and bonnets.

History[edit]
Founded in 1729, Lancaster was the capital of the United States for a single day on September 27, 1777, as the founding fathers fled the British. Lancaster has evolved from Pennsylvania's capital back in 1799, before Harrisburg was named the capital in 1812, to a strong and well known city in Pennsylvania. It is the oldest inland city in the United States. Lancaster has grown into a contemporary city.

By car[edit]
Interstate highways lead most traffic into Lancaster County.

I-76, also known as the Pennsylvania Turnpike.
One of the most pleasant routes from the East Coast Cities is via I-78 through New Jersey to exit 13, Bethel, then Route 501 south to Lancaster.  It is a beautiful farmland drive, especially at sunset.
Another good routing from I-78 is exit 54A, US-222 South (Hamilton Boulevard). This is also very scenic, but a faster and more direct routing.
A very nice, scenic drive that takes you through the heart of the Pennsylvania Amish Country is a connecting road between Route 30 West from Philadelphia and Old Philadelphia Pike, Newport Road. The gentle rolling hills take the road through open Amish farm land and passes by Pequea Valley High School. Not only is Newport Road a nice, refreshing, scenic road, it also bypasses all the traffic of the Lancaster Outlet areas and takes you to Old Philadelphia Pike which puts you right back on the highway portion route 30 towards York County.
By plane[edit]
40.122222-76.2944442 Lancaster Airport (LNS  IATA). Has non-stop service to Pittsburgh and BWI (Baltimore/Washington, DC) airports via Southern Airways Express. There are more airlines and destinations operating from the airports in Philadelphia (PHL IATA) and Harrisburg (MDT IATA).   
Get around[edit]
Thanks to the Amish and local historical societies, older forms of transportation are common in the Lancaster area.
By car[edit]
Plan on having a car to get around. You may pass the buggies. If you don't, locals will immediately peg you as a tourist. Keep an eye on oncoming traffic, activate your 4-way or hazard flashers for the duration of the manoeuvre, and pass quickly but safely, with sufficient distance from the horses. Lancastrian drivers are generally very polite, with notable exceptions; they will be courteous as long as you return the favor.

By bus[edit]
 Red Rose Transit Authority (RRTA). Service ends by 6PM. Public transportation is provided by the Red Rose Transit Authority, however, don't expect it to be anything like metropolitan areas.

 Queen Street Station. The central nexus of the RRTA network. Includes a parking garage and bike parking. (updated Nov 2019)
By buggy[edit]
It is sometimes possible to pay for a buggy ride. Yes, horses do relieve themselves on the road. If you must dodge "road apples", please be careful!

By bike[edit]
It is possible to tour the county by bicycle, but it shouldn't be attempted unless you're a cyclist who doesn't mind hills!

By foot[edit]
Some places and towns, such as the Rockvale Square retail outlets and the town of Intercourse, are easily navigable on foot. Most of the city of Lancaster itself is walkable, with only outlying areas within the city needing access by car.

The Amish[edit]
An amish buggy on the road
Although the Amish culture dates back hundreds of years, they have not done much to change their lifestyles. They are traditional and they have a strong sense of community. They exist inside a larger community and everyone gets along without internal problems. They keep to themselves, but they give back to the outside Lancasterian community with their goods.
