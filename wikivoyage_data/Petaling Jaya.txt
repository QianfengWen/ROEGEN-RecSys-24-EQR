Petaling Jaya
Petaling Jaya, universally referred to as PJ, is a satellite city on the western edge of Kuala Lumpur, in the state of Selangor.


Understand[edit]
Founded in 1954 as Malaysia's first planned town, PJ has become a busy commercial and residential hub in its own right with almost 640,000 inhabitants (2010). In the later years, further expansion to the north saw the rise of the Damansara area that gave birth to such housing estates as Bandar Utama, Kota Damansara, Damansara Perdana, Bandar Sri Damansara and Damansara Impian.
Addresses in PJ are remarkably bureaucratic.  The town is divided into numbered sections (seksyen), which to further confuse things are denoted with just S (eastern PJ), SS (central and western), PJU (northern), and PJS (southern).  The northern chunk is also known as Damansara.   "SS" is an acronym for "Sungai Way-Subang", and just to keep you on your toes, sections SS 12 through 19 & PJS were part of Petaling Jaya, then reassigned to a new neighbourhood city, Subang Jaya, covering the west area of Kuala Lumpur.
Each road in a section is numbered, so an address like "No. 38, Jalan SS 21/58" means house 38, road 58, section SS 21. There is no definitive form for a PJ address. Therefore, the above example could well be written as 38 Road SS 21/58, 38 Jln SS 21/58 or simply as 38 SS 21/58. Most major roads developed during the 1960s are given names, e.g. Jalan Utara, Jalan Selangor, Jalan Kemajuan. Some secondary roads, even those in residential or industrial areas were also given names. For example, Jalan 8/8 in Section 8 is also known as Jalan Tengas, Jalan 13/1 is also known as Jalan Bersatu. In addition, the roads of PJ Old Town or Section One are named as Road 1, Road 2, etc. As for the predominantly industrial Section 51A, the roads are named as Jalan 222, Jalan 225 etc.
The numbered sections are usually adjacent to each other. For instance, Section 16 is adjacent to section 17 which is adjacent to Section 19. The 'missing' Section 18 (originally to be named Section 1B) is way across the other side of town adjacent to Section 1A. Likewise, without a good map, it can be an onerous exercise to find PJ roads. For instance, Jalan 21/20 is adjacent to Jalan 21/18. However Jalan 21/1 is also adjacent to Jalan 21/18. (Most odd-numbered roads are parallel to odd-numbered road, even-numbered roads are parallel to even-numbered roads, and odd-numbered road and even-numbered roads are perpendicular to each other.) In addition, residents within a local PJ community may sometimes choose to refer to their local roads by their numbers, omitting the prefix altogether. For instance, in Damansara Jaya, residents often choose to refer to the road 'Jalan SS 22/39' as 'Road 39'.

By road[edit]
PJ is well linked with Kuala Lumpur and the rest of the country by road. The main Kuala Lumpur-PJ link is the Federal Highway which goes through the middle of PJ and continues to Subang Jaya, Shah Alam, Klang and Port Klang. The main link to the northern part of PJ is the Sprint Expressway while the southern areas of PJ are served by the New Pantai Expressway.
If using the North-South Expressway (E1), the main exits for PJ are Subang Jaya, and Damansara.

By train[edit]
The Kelana Jaya line [1] light rail transit (formerly PUTRA-LRT) snakes from central Kuala Lumpur to the center of PJ and is a good way of avoiding the traffic jams between the two, especially at rush hour. The main stations in PJ are Taman Jaya (nearest to PJ New Town), Asia Jaya (walking distance to the KL-Klang bus stop), Taman Paramount, and Kelana Jaya.
The KTM Komuter electric trains also stops at several places in PJ, albeit not as convenient as the LRT. The PJ stations, namely Jalan Templer, Kampung Dato Harun, Seri Setia and Setia Jaya, are on the Sentul-Port Klang Line.

By bus[edit]
From Kuala Lumpur: Petaling Jaya is linked to Kuala Lumpur by Rapid KL and Metrobus buses. Main bus hubs are Asia Jaya, Damansara Uptown and Bandar Utama. Main Rapid KL routes linking Kuala Lumpur and PJ are 750, 751 (Shah Alam via Federal Highway), 770, 772 (Subang via Federal Highway) and 780 (Bandar Utama). There are also bus connections from PJ to Klang and Port Klang, served by Transnasional (which can be caught at bus stops along the Federal Highway), and Putrajaya (Rapid KL route 506 from Bandar Utama).
From other destinations: The luxury Aeroline operating between PJ and Singapore with double-deck coaches stops at two locations in PJ - Menara Axis (opposite the Asia Jaya LRT station) and One Utama Shopping Centre. From Menara Axis, there are four services to Singapore daily (departing 08:00, 09:30, 11:00, 18:00) while at One Utama, there are two daily trips (departing 10:00 and 18:30).
By taxi[edit]
All metered taxis operating in Kuala Lumpur also serve PJ.

Get around[edit]
PJ is quite spread out and you pretty much need your own wheels to get around.

By road[edit]
A good web of roads link most parts of PJ. Main highways which cover most of PJ are the Federal Highway (covering central PJ), Sprint Expressway (serving Damansara and the northern part of PJ), New Pantai Expressway (linking the southern sections of PJ) and the Lebuhraya Damansara Puchong or LDP (Damansara Puchong Expressway), which connects the northern and southern parts of PJ.

By train[edit]
The Kelana Jaya Line light rail transit (LRT) is convenient for those moving between PJ New Town and Kelana Jaya.

By bus[edit]
Rapid KL is the main operator. Although the bus service is not up to first world standards, it has improved tremendously. The network is complicated but Rapid KL now provides information on its routes on its website.
Rapid KL's network works on a hub and spoke concept, where trunk routes (the bus number starts with "U") from Kuala Lumpur link hubs in Petaling Jaya where local shuttle buses (the bus number starts with "T") fan out into the numerous residential areas. Local shuttles also radiate from light rail transit (LRT) stations. Main hubs include the Kelana Jaya, Taman Bahagia, Asia Jaya and Taman Jaya LRT stations, and Bandar Utama (next to One Utama Shopping Centre), Damansara Uptown, EPF and Asia Jaya bus stops.
The major hotels (Hilton, Sunway Resort, Eastin, Crystal Crown, Royale Bintang, and Armada) have shuttle bus services that take guests into KL City and various PJ landmarks such as Sunway Lagoon, One Utama, and The Curve Shopping Center.

By taxi[edit]
All Kuala Lumpur metered taxis operate in Petaling Jaya, but there are far fewer roaming the streets and you'll usually need to find a taxi stand or call them up. Some cab company numbers are:

 Comfort Taxi, ☏ +60 3-26922525. RM1 surcharge on top of the meter. 
 Super Cab Taxi, ☏ +60 3-78055333. RM1 surcharge on top of the meter.

Jaya Park
If taking public transport, try the Light Rail Transit (LRT) via the Kelana Jaya Line which covers major residential and commercial sections of this town, starting with stations (from KL City); Taman Jaya, Asia Jaya, Taman Paramount, Taman Bahagia and finally Kelana Jaya. The best way to see this area is to take a leisurely drive during non-peak hours. Some of the major attractions around the Greater PJ area are listed below.

Gasing Hill. Along the same road from the Chetawan Temple is the turnoff towards  the Gasing Hill. The Hill, which is the only remaining forest reserve in PJ, covers approximately 100 acres where rare fauna and flora could be found. There are also trails, a viewing tower and resting area for nature lovers. From the top of Gasing Hill one gets breath-taking views of PJ and Kuala Lumpur. Over 100 species of birds are to be found in this green lung.
Hilton PJ. This legendary hotel has been a hallmark of good food for the people of Petaling Jaya since its opening in 1984 (the longest-operating Hilton in Malaysia). Its Paya Serai coffee house has been delighting diners with its daily hi-tea buffet for many years now and also, the ever popular Chili's Bistro was given a facelift. In fact, most people will know the PJ State area by the mere mention of "Hilton" or its famous neighbor, Menara MBPJ.
Kelana Jaya Lake Park. (Nearest LRT Station: Kelana Jaya) One of the largest in PJ, with its 7 scenic lakes, this park is a former mining area that was rehabilitated in the 1980s into what it is today. Other than a popular jogging track around the lakes, the Kelana Jaya Sports Complex is located nearby and it contains two Olympic-sized swimming pools as well as tennis and badminton courts. The modern MBPJ Stadium is also in the vicinity and it was one of the venues used for the KL 1998 Commonwealth Games.
3.1123101.65661 Kota Darul Ehsan Arch. This huge marble arch, the gateway into Petaling Jaya, was erected to mark the commemoration of the cession of Kuala Lumpur to the Federal Government to form the Federal Territory. Construction commenced in 1974 and the arch was opened in 1981. The arch is most spectacular at night when the lighting creates a "golden" illumination to highway motorists. (updated Aug 2020)
LDP Cable-Stayed Bridge. The LDP (Damansara-Puchong Highway) Cable Stayed Bridge at Persekutuan Interchange crossing the Federal Highway is the first Cable Stayed Land Bridge in Malaysia. The bridge stands out as an aesthetically pleasing and unique design in a highway project in the country. The design and construction methods of the bridge allowed for the necessary traffic management required at the construction site (one of the busiest interchanges); a normal bridge design would have required for the removal of 2 traffic lanes to accommodate the construction of the piers.
MBPJ Tower. (Nearest LRT Station: Taman Jaya) The headquarters of the Petaling Jaya City Council (MBPJ) and a prominent PJ landmark, the 27-storey building which cost RM50m was officiated by the late Sultan of Selangor, Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah on March 16, 1987. The building is unique in the sense that it stands in the middle of a pit-like "sunken plaza" and surrounded by shops as well as commercial areas.

PJ Exchange.  This 35-storey office tower, which is under construction, has a great location in PJ as it's at the doorstep of the Taman Jaya LRT Station and next to the Federal Highway and the popular Amcorp Mall. With its 30-m spire, the PJ Exchange (PJX) became the tallest office tower in PJ and a prominent landmark upon completion in 2010.
Taman Jaya. A spot for those in search of outdoor activities like jogging and cycling is Taman Jaya, a favourite recreational hub for residents with its shady trees and lake. It is a short walk away from the similarly-named LRT station as well as the Amcorp Mall and Dataran PJ Field.
Wat Chetawan Temple. (Nearest LRT Station: Taman Jaya) One of the main Thai Buddhist temples in the Klang Valley, the Chetawan can be seen in full glory either when driving on Jalan Gasing or traveling on the Kelana Jaya Line LRT. With a towering main prayer hall and surrounded by shrines, the temple has been around for more than 40 years, having started as a small temple in Jalan Raja Bot in 1957. The present temple was built in the early 1960s. Today, it is the main attraction for devotees and visitors alike because of its intricate design and statues within the temple grounds. The temple attracts huge numbers of devotees during Thai festivals like Songkran and Loy Krathong, as well as Wesak, and hosts Thai royal visitors during auspicious festivals.

Various pasar malam (night markets) can be found on the main streets in the suburbs around Petaling Jaya. It's the best way to get to know the 'true' Malaysian culture. There you can find fresh foods, quick snacks and it is also a popular target by the local triads to sell their contraband merchandise of anything under the sun: clothing, electronics, mobile phone accessories, pirated DVDs and Audio CDs. You get a very good bargain if you buy them in bulk or if you speak Malay or Chinese dialect (most Chinese in PJ understands Hokkien).
