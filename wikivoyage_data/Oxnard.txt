If you have a couple of large groups near each other, you may need to negotiate for places to pitch tents. Also note that a shift in the coastal dunes has resulted in flooding of the rear areas of the campground so getting to the beach is impossible from the campground and the flooding created marshes in the rear meadow areas. Some of the campsites at the back will also experience intermittent flooding so try to avoid those. $35.
