Gjakova/Gjakovë (Albanian) Đakovica (Serbian) is a city in western Kosovo with about 101,000 inhabitants. Gjakova is a centre of culture and learning in Kosovo.


Understand[edit]
The Gjakova Grand Bazaar
It was established as a trading town, sporting the largest bazaar in the Balkans, called Çarshia e Madhe (the Grand Bazaar). The tradesmanship spirit and some of the trades practiced still remain in the city. The city is centrally located in the Dukagjin Valley of western Kosovo, equal distance between the cities of Prizren to the south and Peja to the north. It also has a historic link to the Gjakova Highlands, now across the border in northern Albania.
The townspeople pride themselves in their sense of town music practised, humour and sarcasm which distinguish it from the rest of Kosovo and enforce the local character. Gjakova has contributed several important leaders to the history of Kosovo, such as World War II partisan and post-war leader Fadil Hoxha and communist Yugoslav Presidency Chairman Mahmut Bakalli, as well as to the cultural scene.
Gjakova was badly hit by the Kosovo War of 1998–99, fought between Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas demanding the independence of Kosovo and Serbian forces. Around 75% of town's population was driven out by the Serb Army during the war, and many of the city's homes and important monuments were burnt down or otherwise destroyed. After the war, much of town's ethnic Albanian inhabitants returned (who make up to 98% of the population). Many of the stores in the old-town area, locally known as Çarshia e Madhe, were rebuilt.
While in Gjakova, make sure you talk to the locals, especially the young ones, since they are more proficient in English. And you will hear a story about every corner of the city.
The town has sizable diasporas in Switzerland, Germany, and Belgium. Especially during the summer months, you might see many expensive foreign cars from these countries circling around town. The foreign family members return here for vacation as well as for marriages because this way the whole family can join the wedding. The Çarshia e Madhe has many shops specialized in wedding attire.
