Pozzallo is a city near the southern tip of Sicily in Italy. It's the port for ferries to Malta. Pozzallo is a major summer tourist destination, with two beaches holding a Blue Flag award, as of Apr 2023, for water quality, environmental education and information, environmental management, and safety and other services. 


Understand[edit]
Very few beaches in Sicily have won the Blue Flag. 

Get in[edit]
The closest local airport is located in Comiso, near Ragusa. Catania-Fontanarossa is further but with better choice of flights across Europe, and good public transport to Syracuse.
The fast-cat ferry to Valletta in Malta runs twice day, taking 1 hr 30. Day-trips from Pozzallo port to Malta are possible on Wednesday and Friday. The service is run by Virtu Ferries[dead link], return fare €80 low season rising to €160 mid-summer. The ferry terminal is 3 km west of town centre. The catamaran is quite stable and enjoyable during a calm summer day, but on the event of bad weather might be delayed or cancelled.
AST bus routes are #50 Syracuse - Noto - Pozzallo - Ragusa - Gela; #56 Pozzallo - Ragusa - Palermo; #57 Pozzallo - Modica - Ragusa; and #59 to Modica. They run all week but are infrequent on Sunday. The bus stop is on Piazza della Rimenbranza along Corso Vittorio Vento, buy tickets on board.
There are six regional trains a day M-Sa: north-west via Ragusa (1 hour) to Gela, with connections to Palermo, and north-east to Syracuse (1 hour), with connections to Palermo, Messina and mainland Italy. No trains on Sunday. The station is on the north edge of town, at the end of Via Giuseppe Mazzini about 10 min from Piazza della Rimenbranza. The station is just a platform halt and has no amenities, not even a ticket machine: buy tickets from shops, e.g. the tobacconist at foot of V Mazzini, or supermarket next to the station.
Taxi might be your only choice on Sunday. Price from Ragusa is about €50, from Catania €160, and from Milazzo €240. Book with "Excursions in Sicily" email: info@chauffeurs-italy.com

Pietre Nere Beach is a sandy but scrappy thing, stretching east for some 400 m from the Tower to the crumbling cliffs. (The banner photo is fish-eyed, elongating it into a spit.)
The Raganzino Beach is another small beach between the west edge of town and the port, overlooked by the masonry scraps of Castello di Martino. In between is the wave-dashed promenade, with a boat slipway.
The Festival of Saint John the Baptist is held on the Sunday before 24 June. The week before a boat flotilla lays a wreath upon the sea. Celebrations always ends with a nice fireworks show.
