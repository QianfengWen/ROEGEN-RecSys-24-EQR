Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Ciamis is along the main road of the Southern Java Route that runs from Bandung to Yogyakarta. To get to Ciamis from Bandung, you will need to take the road over the Nagreg mountain pass. The journey takes about 3 hours if traffic conditions are good. However, serious traffic congestion is common on the mountain pass road. The larger city of Tasikmalaya is just west of Ciamis, and by car the journey from Tasik's city centre to Ciamis takes about 30 to 45 minutes.

By train[edit]

There are four daily economy class trains to the west (to Bandung and Jakarta) and four to the east (2 to Purwokerto, 1 to Surabaya and 1 to Kediri). In addition, there is one daily business class train to Surabaya that also calls at Yogyakarta and Solo.

By bus[edit]
Many buses on the Southern Java Route drop off and pick up passengers in Ciamis. -7.33277108.356942 Ciamis bus terminal is on the southern side of the city. However, as the terminal is a bit off the main road, bus drivers do not always stop there but sometimes just let passengers get off along the main road. From Jakarta, most buses that call at Ciamis depart at Kampung Rambutan bus terminal in East Jakarta (mostly buses with destination Cilacap or Pangandaran). There are also very frequent buses during daytime from the Cicaheum terminal in East Bandung. In Bandung, it is also an option to wait for buses at the Cileunyi toll gate, as all buses from Jakarta towards Ciamis pass there. From other destinations, such as Cirebon, it is usually easier to get on a bus to the city of Tasikmalaya first, and then get on another bus or minibus (or hire an ojek motorcycle taxi) to Ciamis.

Eat[edit]
There are many small restaurants that sell local food. A typical snack from Ciamis is galendo. Galendo is a sweet snack that was a byproduct of the coconut oil production process.
