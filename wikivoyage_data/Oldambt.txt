Oldambt is a municipality in the east of the province of Groningen, in the Netherlands, bordering the East Frisia region of Germany. Oldambt used to be the granary of the Netherlands, and is now known for its landscape with yellow fields of rapeseed, its canals and lakes, and in the north the Dollard bay coast. The main town of the region is Winschoten, nicknamed windmill city because of its three traditional windmills. Villages in the region include Scheemda and spa town Bad Nieuweschans.

The Oldambt is a region in the east of Groningen province, which was an administrative district from the Middle Ages to the 18th century. On the northern side of the region is the coast of the Dollard, a bay of the Wadden Sea. Large parts of the Oldambt were overflowed by the Dollard in the 15th and 16th centuries, drowning at least 20 villages. Starting from the 16th century, land has been reclaimed from the Dollard and the Oldambt region in its current form was created. The region, especially the reclaimed land, was very suitable for agricultural production, and the Oldambt became known as the granary of Groningen province, or even of the Netherlands. The farmers in Oldambt thrived, and this led to the construction of large farming estates, and the development of Winschoten (awarded city rights in 1825) as regional centre.
Nowadays, Oldambt is one of the weakest regions of the Netherlands economically, with a declining and ageing population. Part of the reason for this is the relatively remote location of the Oldambt in the Netherlands, in the northeastern corner of the country. Many of the younger generation therefore move to more central locations, such as the provincial capital Groningen city. The government has attempted to reverse this trend by the implementation of several projects, of which the Blauwestad project is the most notable example. Through this project, an 800-hectare lake has been created, aimed at improving opportunities for tourism, and increasing the draw of the region for wealthy citizens. Although the project has largely failed in attracting people to move to the region, it has benefitted tourism in the region, especially water sports.
In 2010, several municipalities in the region merged to become the municipality of Oldambt. The municipality has a population of about 38,000, and covers part of the historical region of Oldambt. In addition to this municipality, the historical region also covers the more western area, including the villages of Muntendam, Zuidbroek, and Noordbroek. This area is part of the new municipality Midden-Groningen (established in 2018). This article does not include these villages, and only focuses on the current municipality of Oldambt.

Tourist information[edit]

Get in[edit]
Bad Nieuweschans railway station
By car[edit]
The southern part of Oldambt is traversed by the east-west A7 motorway. From virtually all directions this motorway is the best option to enter the Oldambt region. From the western side, from the city of Groningen (and the nearest airport, Groningen Airport Eelde) it takes about 25 minutes to Oldambt, while from Amsterdam the drive takes 2 hours. On the eastern side, the A7 motorway crosses the border with Germany and then continues as the German A280 Autobahn, with a junction to the A31 Autobahn nearby (Oldenburg 1 hour, Bremen 1hr 20min, Münster 1hr 45min).

By train[edit]
The Oldambt is along the railway from Groningen city to Leer (Ostfriesland) in Germany. There are three railway stations along this line within the Oldambt: from west to east Scheemda, Winschoten, and Bad Nieuweschans. The stations in Scheemda and Winschoten are served two times per hour by a train from Groningen (operated by Arriva). One of these two trains terminates in Winschoten, while the other continues to Bad Nieuweschans (hence served 1x/hour). The travel time from Groningen to Oldambt is approximately 30 minutes (Scheemda) to 48 minutes (Bad Nieuweschans).
The train service used to continue to Leer (Ostfriesland) in Germany. However, in 2015 a ship collided with the railway bridge between Bad Nieuweschans and Leer, making Bad Nieuweschans the terminus. The hourly train service that terminates in Winschoten is supplemented by a replacement bus service that runs Winschoten - Bad Nieuweschans - Weener - Leer. Coming from Germany to the Oldambt, you can therefore take a train to 'Leer (Ostfriesland)' station and transfer to the replacement bus to Bad Nieuweschans and Winschoten. (Reconstruction works on the bridge are planned to start no sooner than 2020, with completion set four years later.)

By bus[edit]
It is easiest to get to the Oldambt by train. However, from some destinations in the region (Groningen and Drenthe provinces), regional bus routes operated by Qbuzz can be used.

Bus route 13 from Veendam: 1x per hour during daytime Mondays to Saturdays.
Bus routes 14 and 75 from Stadskanaal: 1-2x per hour during daytime Mondays to Saturdays (route 14 via Vlagtwedde, route 75 via Nieuwe Pekela).
Bus route 110 from Assen via Veendam: 1-2x per hour daily (from Assen it is faster to take a train via Groningen city).
Bus route 119 from Delfzijl: 1x per hour daily.
Get around[edit]

The fastest way to get around in the Oldambt region is by car. In the southern part of the Oldambt there is an extensive road network, including the A7 motorway and several trunk roads. In the northern part, the population density is much lower and there are only some local roads. However, the best way to get around is arguably by bicycle. The main towns and villages are clearly signposted with dedicated signposts for cyclists, and in many cases separate cycle paths are available.
Apart from the train connection from Scheemda via Winschoten to Bad Nieuweschans, as described above, there are two bus routes that can be useful to get around in the Oldambt. Bus route 13 (direction Veendam) connects Winschoten to the villages of Heiligerlee and Westerlee; and bus route 17 connects the stations of Winschoten and Scheemda via the villages Beerta, Finsterwolde, Oostwold, and Midwolda.

Windmills[edit]
Windmill 'Berg' in Winschoten
In the early 18th century, there were thirteen windmills in Winschoten alone, giving it the nickname Molenstad (windmill city). As a result of the industrial revolution and expansion of residential areas, the number of windmills has decreased. Nowadays, there are still three traditional windmills in Winschoten, and five more in the other villages of the Oldambt. Some of the most notable include:

53.146657.031511 Edens (De Volharding), Nassaustraat 14, Winschoten. Open for visits Saturday afternoons. The oldest windmill of Groningen province. The grist mill was built in 1763. (updated Aug 2016)
