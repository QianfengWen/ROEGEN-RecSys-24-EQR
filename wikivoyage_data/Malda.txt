Nandadirghi Vihar
25.04118988.401961 Nandadirghi Vihar (Jagjivanpur). An archaeological site in the Jagjivanpur village. A chance discovery of a copper plate in 1987, with a royal seal on top, contains inscription on both sides in kharoshthi script. It was the charter of a hitherto unknown ruler called Mahendrapal Deva, of the Pala dynasty, who bequeathed a plot called Nandadirghik-odranga to his army chief Mahasenapati Vajradeva for building a Buddhist monastery to help his parents and the people, in general, attain religious merit. The discovery leads to an extensive excavation of the Tulabhita mound in Jagjivanpur. The excavation revealed a structure containing a sanctum sanctorum, bastions-cum-cells, balcony, steps, bathroom complex, well, courtyard and entrance. The archaeological findings suggest that the ruins were the remains of Nandadirghi Vihar, one of the leading centres of learning in the 9th Century AD. The 30m x 30m structure, maintained by the state archaeological department, is enclosed by barbed wire. The four corners of the square structure had four circular constructions, two of which exist to this day. Beautiful terracotta panels adorned the four walls. The panels have been removed to State Archaeological Museum in Behala, Kolkata. The structure has a courtyard in the middle, surrounded on all sides by two lines of square identical cells, which were probably used as students’ residences or classrooms.   (updated Jun 2020)
