Ürgüp
Ürgüp is a town in the Cappadocia region of Turkey.


Understand[edit]
Ürgüp (formerly known as Ossiana in Greek) is an ideal starting point to visit Cappadocia.
It used to be a centre of a trade at Seljuk times. Today it is still popular for its handicrafts and small shops.
The city attracts lots of travellers, thanks to its geomorphological sights and cave dwellings.
It is one of the largest towns in Cappadocia and has many cave hotels and restaurants.

38.63057434.9125142 Bus station (in the centre of the town), ☏ +90 384 341 4766. 
Several bus companies serve Ürgüp: Nevsehirliler, Göreme turizm and Metro. These companies have buses to all major cities in Turkey (Ankara, Antalya, Izmir, Istanbul, Kayseri, etc.) and circulate mainly at night. Beware of companies that will sell tickets not directly to the Nevsehir's or Ürgüp's bus stations as the bus may drop you in the open field about 16 km from your destination.
Also there are local dolmuş minibuses that go to the regional capital Nevşehir and nearby towns of Avanos, Göreme, Uçhisar, and Ortahisar.

By plane[edit]
The nearest airports are at Kayseri (ten daily flights from Istanbul by Turkish Airlines and Pegasus, few direct international flights Pegasus and TuiFly) and Nevşehir (2 daily flights from Istanbul).
The best way to get to Urgup is to book a shuttle bus in advance, which will be waiting for you even if your flight is delayed. They will bring you to any address in any city of Cappadocia. The price is 25 TL per person. To make a reservation contact [1] [dead link] or [2].
Otherwise you will be paying for a taxi.

Hitchhiking[edit]
Hitchhiking also works very well in all of Cappadocia

Get around[edit]
Dolmuş (minibus) service all areas of the city and leave from the bus station every 1/2 hour.

Of the city centre[edit]
Ürgüp
 Fairy chimneys (On the road Nevsehir-Ürgüp). 
 Devrent valley (2 km following the road to Avanos). Devrent valley and its remarkable rock formations, including the one in the shape of a camel. Superb view on the city. Climb the hill Temmeni through narrow streets lined with old Greek houses, to the tomb of a Seljuk Pasha. 
38.61097734.9021712 Pancarlik Valley, SW 3km (there is a turning to the valley 2 km passing Urgup when going to Mustafapasa). A spectacular lunar landscape of the volcanic rock formations. Also there are three rock-cut churches. And the beautiful and frescoed church of San Teodoro Pancarlik (built in the 10th century) is the most important and interesting one. It's surrounded with a number of caves carved into the volcanic rock. Overall, Pancarlik Valley is not crowded at all comparing to some other valleys. 
 Gomeda Valley (on the road to Mustafapasa). 
38.50094334.9234483 Sobesos. Ancient Roman city dating back to the 4th century. It houses some well preserved mosaic areas, two chapels and a few other buildings. 
Do[edit]
Turkish bath in Ürgüp
 Hamam. The Turkish bath is quite basic, but the operators doing quite well. For €25 you will be bathed, massaged and provided with the usual towel. The personal is very helpful and friendly. 
 Ballooning. Cappadocia is one of the best places in the world to make a hot air balloon ride. Admiring the tufa formations of the sky is an unforgettable experience. €120-240, the only difference seems to be the duration of the flight either 1 hr or 1 hr 30 min; price can be bargained down to €90 but you have to push hard. 
 Wine tasting (Turasan winery), Yunak Mahallesi Tevfik Fikret Caddesi No: 6A-B, ☏ +90 384 341 4961. 08:00 – 18:00. Offer guided tours. There is also wine shop available. Guided tour to the wineries + 3 wine samples 18 TL. 
 Various hiking and trekking tours. You can buy tours through the travel agencies to be accompanied by the professional guides, or organize your trips by yourself. With a guide you will save time and you will not get lost, but the pace will be taxed and you will surely end up in a carpet shop or very very expensive pottery at the end of a day. All agencies in Urgup perform more or less the same tricks. Needless to book well in advance, it is better to tour agencies in the centre of the city the night before and put them in competition. Also be aware that you will be mixed with tourists of different nationalities and that the guide should therefore give the explanations successively in different languages. It is quite possible to visit by yourself all attractions using local bus or hitchhiking which works quite well to get to the starting point of your walk. 
Buy[edit]
Many carpet stores and kilims (woven rugs) on the main street sell at prices that are much more interesting than the department stores.
Beware of the store that claims to be "a carpet museum" that is just a shop like the others, but can be a little more expensive than others.

Eat[edit]
Beware of the restaurants which offer you a variety of stews cooked in a wood-fire in pottery, because these dishes require a long cooking and to reduce it they are prepared ahead of time, sometimes several days in advance if the sales were not good, and therefore they pose food safety issues.

There are several patisseries on the main street and near bus station.
 Ürgüp Pide. Excellent pide (Turkish pizzas) and a good assortment of grilled meats in the courtyard of the bus station. The service is friendly and fast. A good solution to eat before taking a bus for a few euros.
