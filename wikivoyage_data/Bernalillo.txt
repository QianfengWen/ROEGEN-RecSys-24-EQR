A Route 66 relic in Bernalillo
Bernalillo[dead link]   is a town in central New Mexico, United States of America, just north of Albuquerque.  It was one of the waypoints along the original route of historic Route 66. This article also covers the city of Algodones.


Get in[edit]
Map of Bernalillo

Bernalillo is just off Interstate Highway 25, although travelers following the  Route 66 itinerary will get there via back roads.  The nearest major airport is in Albuquerque.
A commuter railroad, the New Mexico Rail Runner Express, connects Bernalillo to Albuquerque, Santa Fe, and some of the other small communities along the Rio Grande. There are two stations in Bernalillo: One is on US-550 right near the I-25 exit, which is mainly just a park and ride lot. The second station is right in the center of town, in the old historic area. The train runs with limited service daily.

Get around[edit]
Driving is the most reliable way to move through this town, and just about the only way to get to places on the west side of the Rio Grande, like Coronado State Monument. US-550 is the main drag through town.
Public transportation to points within Bernalillo is largely non-existent. A dedicated shuttle connects the Rail Runner station to the Santa Ana Star Casino, but that's it.
There are a few walkable areas of town, like the old main street of Bernalillo (Camino del Pueblo) with its shops, restaurants, and historic structures. This area of town is also within easy walking distance of the Downtown Bernalillo Rail Runner station.
