Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
The 47.5655569.3794441 railway station is located in the town centre right next to the harbour. Romanshorn is a connecting hub for several lines and as such very convenient to reach by train.

IC from Brig (3 h 30 min) via Berne (2 h 20 min), Zurich (1 h 10 min), Zurich airport (1 h), Winterthur (40 min) and Frauenfeld (30 min), 1 hourly train.
S8 from Schaffhausen (1 h 30 min) via Stein am Rhein (1 h), Kreuzlingen (30 min) and from St. Gallen (30 min), 2 hourly trains. A couple of RE connections again, go on the same route, but end in Konstanz instead.
S7 from Weinfelden (20 min) and Rorschach (20 min), twice hourly.
By boat[edit]
The Swiss Lake Constance Shipping Company (SBS AG) serves a bunch of connections across the lake carrying both passengers and cars. Both the ferry terminal and the passenger boat jetty are just outside the railway station.
A ferry links Friedrichshafen in Germany to Romanshorn (41 min, Fr. 10.40). The ferry has between 8 and 16 connections a day depending on the time of the year and the weekday.
Passenger ships have several trips a day to Konstanz, Kreuzlingen, Rorschach, Altnau and Meersburg. From Lindau a change in Rorschach is necessary.

By car[edit]
The closest motorway is the A1, with a spur road (A1.1) starting just east of town. Either of the main roads to the west (one along the lake in direction Kreuzlingen, the other in direction of Weinfelden) lead to the A7 motorway.
