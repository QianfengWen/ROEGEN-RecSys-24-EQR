Understand[edit]
Mission Beach is a natural mid way point between Townsville and Cairns. Mission Beach is made up of four beach villages linked by 14 kilometres of wide golden beach, a perfect base to relax and explore this unspoilt natural environment. A blend of sophisticated eateries, boutiques and art galleries nestle against lush tropical rainforest. Mission Beach reminds us of how beautiful little beachside towns can be, blending vibrant art and culture with unique tourism attractions.
