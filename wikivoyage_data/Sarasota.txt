Sarasota[dead link] is a popular city on the Gulf Coast of Southwest Florida.  It is known for its vibrant arts community, excellent restaurants, unique shopping, and beautiful beaches.  Sarasota, although a mid-sized city, is considered to be the cultural center of West Central Florida.  The city has a metropolitan flavor unique to cities of its size and to cities in Florida.


Understand[edit]
The Asolo Theater, Florida West Coast Symphony, Sarasota Opera, the Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall, and frequent art shows add to the cultural theme of the city, rivaling the facilities of Florida's largest cities.  Sarasota is also home to the Ringling Museum of Art, the Selby Botanical Gardens, New College (Florida's public honors college), a USF branch, and the Ringling School of Art and Design.
Sarasota's downtown cityscape features office buildings and several upscale downtown condominiums.  It is complemented by Saint Armands Circle, on Saint Armands Key, which is surrounded by Lido Key, across Sarasota Bay from downtown via the Ringling Causeway (with sweeping views of Sarasota Bay.)  Saint Armands Circle is an upscale outdoor shopping area, with several cafes, reminiscent of Europe.  The idea for Saint Armands was from John Ringling who also intended to build a Ritz hotel on Longboat Key.  Today, Sarasota has a Ritz hotel downtown, and the Longboat Key Club on Ringling's original site.  The Longboat Key Club includes two golf courses, tennis, and all other resort facilities and is located just north of Saint Armands on Longboat Key.
The fine white-sand beaches are a major draw to the area.  Siesta Key Beach is consistently ranked among the most beautiful beaches on Earth.  (Siesta Key was also the site chosen for the marriage of Chrissy and Brian, of Home Today fame.)  Crescent Beach, Turtle Beach, Lido Beach, and the beach running the 15-mile (25-km) span of Longboat Key are equally beautiful and accessible. Indeed, much of Sarasota's charm comes from the fact that the beaches are so plentiful and accessible.

Stay safe[edit]
Sarasota is a rather safe city, although regular precautions should be taken just to be safe. The only real place a tourist should avoid is Newtown. Located right near downtown, Newtown is rather small and is normally fine to drive through during the day. However vigilance is required if traveling through Newtown at night.
There is a nice downtown park at the Five Points intersection of Main Street,Pineapple and Central Avenues. Some homeless people congregate there but there is a city ordinance against panhandling and sleeping outdoors.
The northern end of Tamiami Trail near University Parkway is also known for run-down motels and some prostitution arrests. However there are also college campuses nearby and several coffee shops and a comedy club so people do safely walk around the area.

Go next[edit]
Myakka River State Park – 9 miles (14 km) east of Sarasota on SR 72. One of the oldest and largest state parks, Myakka protects one of the state's most diverse natural areas. The Myakka River, designated as a Florida Wild and Scenic River, flows through 58 square miles (150 square kilometers) of wetlands, prairies, hammocks, and pinelands. Visitors can enjoy wildlife viewing from a boardwalk that stretches out over the Upper Myakka Lake, then take to the treetops with a stroll along the canopy walkway. The park's river and two lakes provide ample opportunities for boating, freshwater fishing, canoeing, and kayaking; a boat ramp provides access to Upper Myakka Lake. Hikers can explore trails that cross large expanses of rare Florida dry prairie. Scenic lake tours are offered daily on the world's two largest airboats. Safari tram tours of the park's backcountry are offered from mid-December through May.
Tampa and St. Petersburg are an easy drive North via I-75 and the Sunshine Skyway.  Professional Football, baseball, NHL, and most other sports venues can be found there.  Tampa also has more shopping at International Plaza and Westshore malls.  Ybor City and the University of South Florida are also in Tampa, as is a Museum of Science and Industry (MOSI) and Busch Gardens.
