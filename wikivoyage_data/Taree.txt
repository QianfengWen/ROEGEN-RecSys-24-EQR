Taree is a city on the Mid-North Coast of New South Wales.


Understand[edit]
Taree is a large service town on the Manning River, around 20km from the coast.  The Pacific Highway used to pass straight through the town, and cross the narrow Manning River bridge, but now a freeway section bypasses the town, which no longer has the volume of trucks and traffic passing through it.
There are attractions and tourist facilities in Taree, but it is not developed as a major tourist destination in itself.  It is certainly a reasonable place to stop on the drive along the Pacific Highway.

Do[edit]
It is a little drive from Taree, but if you head over to Old Bar Beach:

During the January summer holiday period there's a sand modelling competition which has become a traditional and popular family fun activity.
The path from Old Bar Beach to Wallabi Point, 2.5 km, is an ideal distance for light exercise and scenic views.
A unique aspect of this beach is that it's alongside a heritage-listed airstrip so that flying enthusiasts can fly into the airstrip and then go to the beach.
