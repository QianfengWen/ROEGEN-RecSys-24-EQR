Port Louis is the capital of Mauritius, and with around 150,000 inhabitants the island nation's most populous city. Sitting in a bay surrounded by mountains, Port Louis is a lively and modern city also with charming districts from colonial times.


Understand[edit]
Port-Louis at dusk
The city of Port-Louis has played a leading part in the struggle between the French and British occupation (1735-1935) and was considered during that period as "the star and the key of the Indian Ocean". There are many historical places and buildings to visit. It is also one of the best place to learn about and appreciate more the Mauritian cultures and traditions, and by far the best shopping destination on the island.
Still, overseas visitors to Port Louis are mostly businesspeople, as most tourists visiting Mauritius are more interested in the beaches and nature elsewhere on the island. In a way, this is true for the locals too, as people from the city relocate to the hills outside the city. On the upside, this means that the city is not overly touristy, and except for the traffic jams at rush hours Port Louis retains a small-town feel.
Port Louis, together with the rest of Mauritius, was part of the British Empire from the Napoleonic Wars to the country's independence in 1968. Still, old Port Louis is a "French" city as the British didn't change much in the city built by the French colonisers. In fact, when the British had conquered the island they even left the administration in the hands of the French inhabitants that remained. Sidewalk decorations, parks and many buildings are remnants from the French era. 
One of the main attractions, the Aapravasi Ghat, is mainly from the British era, though. This now-ruined complex is where Indian indentured labourers entered Mauritius in the 19th century (a bit like the Ellis Island outside New York). More than 70% of Mauritians nowadays have Indian ancestry, meaning this is a really important site in the history of the island.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
-20.43002857.6830221 Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport (or simply International Airport) (MRU IATA), just southwest of Mahebourg, is the main point of entry to Mauritius. There are flights from major airports in Europe, eastern and southern Africa, the Middle East, and South, East and Southeast Asia. 
From there, you have three options to reach Port Louis; by rental car, taxi (MUR 1800) or bus (route 198)[dead link]. If you drive yourself, head north-west and follow the signs for "Port-Louis". Port Louis is at the opposite side of the island, about two hours' drive away.

By bus[edit]
The bus station at the Immigration Square.
There are two bus stations in the city. Buses to and from cities to the north and east, such as Trou aux Biches, Grand Baie and Pamplemousses stop at the -20.1576957.50522 Immigration Square bus station, northeast of the central market. Buses from cities to the south and west, such as Mahébourg, Curepipe and Quatre Bornes use the -20.1633657.497463 Victoria Square bus station in the south of the city. 
There aren't really any schedules, but buses depart and arrive quite frequently and you'll rarely need to wait for more than 15-20 minutes. Usually the first buses depart at 6 AM, and the last at 6 PM, city buses do run until 8 PM, though. Depending on the distance, an intercity bus ticket costs about MUR 15-30 (as of 2020) -  express buses and buses with AC are more expensive, however.
Here is a list of the island's bus lines.

By boat[edit]

The harbour is mostly for freight, but the ships of Mauritius Shipping Corporation take passengers from Madagascar and Réunion.

Get around[edit]
By foot[edit]
The city sprawls more than 8 km across but the main attractions are within walking distance.

By light rail[edit]
Metro Express network map
Since 2020, Port Louis has a small light rail network named Metro Express, that connects suburbs to the city. The service opeates daily from 6 AM to 10 PM in intervals of mostly 12-15 minutes.

By bus[edit]
Intercity buses from the both bus stations to other parts of the island have some stops elsewhere in Port Louis. See the link in Get in by bus above for routes and schedules.

By taxi[edit]
Taxi rides within the city normally costs MUR 10-50, a bit more during nighttime. Avoid taxis during rush hours in the morning and afternoon.

By car[edit]
Driving is not the best way of getting around as traffic can be a little chaotic. If you arrive into Port Louis from elsewhere by car, park it at the marina or at your hotel. Street side parking is allowed for two hours ar most.
Renting a car can however be a good idea for trips to other parts of Mauritius. Car rental in Port Louis is a straightforward process, with many international companies like Hertz and Europcar available in the capital.

When slavery was abolished in 1834, slaves that had been working on the island's sugar plantations were replaced by "free" indentured labourers from India. The complex whose present name translates to "immigration depot" in Hindi was first a French building but it was expanded over the years. From 1849 until 1923 more than half a million Indians arrived here, some to be shipped onwards to other parts of the British Empire, others to be settled on Mauritius. As ancestors of about 70% of the island's population has passed through here, it's a very important site for the history and identity of Mauritius. As the practice of systematically shipping Indians to the island ended, the complex was left to decay, used for other purposes and even partially demolished in the 1970s. In 1987 it was listed as a national monument and got its present name, and in 2006 it became a  UNESCO World Heritage Site.
