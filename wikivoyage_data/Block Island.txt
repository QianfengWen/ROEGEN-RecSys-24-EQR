During the winter months Block Island is the very picture of a sleepy, seaside New England town, with a local population of around 900 people. In summer, the island's population explodes to nearly 10,000 at any given time, and many thousands more on busy weekends or holidays.


Understand[edit]
North Light on Block Island
New England has always been one of America's many summer destinations of choice.  Every year couples and families flock to the coast looking for seafood, sun, and a strip of sandy beach to call their own.  They stay in bed and breakfasts on Martha's Vineyard, rent houses in Cape Cod, and stretch out on Narragansett beaches.  Block Island has become a new destination for those embarking on their annual summer exodus. Located 12 mi (19 km) off the coast of Rhode Island, Block Island has become one of the most appealing New England summer hotspots.  This newfound popularity is due in large part to Block Island's easygoing, low-key atmosphere, which benefits from miles of beautiful beaches, numerous bars and restaurants, and consummate natural beauty.

If you prefer to travel by car you can flag down a taxi or rent one on the island. For a nominal charge, the visitor may bring a bicycle on ferries that serve the island.

Mohegan Bluffs
There are many different sights to see around the island during the summer. All you need is a gorgeous summer day and a pair of walking shoes in order to enjoy all of the sights that Block Island has to offer. Here is a list of some of the main attractions on the island:

41.2275-71.5761111 North Light, Corn Neck Road. Built in 1867, this is the fourth lighthouse built on Sandy Point, where exposure to the elements and shifting sands make keeping a lighthouse in one piece difficult. The lighthouse is on the grounds of the National Wildlife Sanctuary, which contains hiking trails.   
41.152343-71.5546052 Mohegan Bluffs, 122 Mohegan Trail. On the southern end of the island, the bluffs rise 200 feet (61 m) above the water and run along the coast for about three miles (5 km). It's the site of the Southeast Lighthouse, built in 1875. This is one of the most visited places on the island due to the gorgeous views and breathtaking sites. Be warned though, to get down to the bluffs on the beach you have to climb down numerous flights of stairs which isn’t the problem, the only problem is coming back up. Be prepared for a good workout.   (updated Jun 2018)
41.153417-71.5521393 [dead link] Southeast Light (Accessible via Mohegan Trail), ☏ +1 401 466-5009. Stop over and take a visit to one of the most magnificent and beautiful lighthouses in America. The view from the lighthouse looks out from the Mohegan Bluffs which are over 200 feet (61 m) above the water. The sight and atmosphere is so breathtaking it will definitely be worth your while.   
 Lewis-Dickens Farm, Cooneymus Road. Coastal grasslands set on the bluffs above the Atlantic provide habitat for raptors and passerines. 
41.188989-71.5621944 Block Island Historical Society, Old Town Road. The Block Island Historical Society houses permanent and special exhibits that chronicle Block Island's past.   
 The Sacred Labyrinth, Corn Neck Rd. Tucked away on Corn Neck Road is the Sacred Labyrinth and is unknown to most tourists. Marked only by a series of wooden steps, guests can stop and walk this man-made hidden path. The Labyrinth is an old Mayan tradition and has been brought to life on Block Island. The Labyrinth is a large, round, circular path that one walks in silence while wishing for something. Once the person gets to the middle, they are supposed to leave a tiny gift (anything will do), and the wish is supposed to come true. The Labyrinth is a fun attraction that not many tourists know about. 
41.17371-71.607835 Dories Cove, Dories Cove Rd (Off of West Side Road). Dories Cove is a beautiful beach tucked away in a cove. It is a beautiful place to watch the sunset or have a fire on the beach. It can be a little hard to access because Dories Cove Road is dirt and there is little parking at the entrance to the cove. If you are up for the walk it is a great place to relax and soak in the island away from all the tourists.  
Do[edit]
Aerial view of Block Island
Although Block Island mainly consists of 17 miles (27 km) of beachy shore there is still plenty to do:

 Beaches. The seashore is everywhere. The Island encompasses 17 miles (27 km) of beaches and offers many choices. Within walking distance of the ferry landing is 3-mile Crescent Beach, which is divided into three parts: the Fredrick J. Benson Beach, Scotch Beach, and Mansion Beach which is positioned beneath cliffs and the stone walls of a vanished mansion. The beach has lifeguards and restrooms. Food is available from nearby Old Harbor restaurants and concessions. Parking and beach admission are free. 
 Block Island Parasail & Watersports, ☏ +1 401 864-2474. Old Harbor Dock, provides an abundance of fun and diverse watersport activities such as banana boat rides, parasailing, jetboat rentals, sunset cruises and island tours. 
 Boating. Charter boats are available for deep-sea fishing or you can simply cast your line in the surf. The 365 fresh water ponds are home to bass, perch, and pickerel. You can snorkel, scuba dive, kayak, or parasail. 
 Block Island Fishing Charters, LLC, New Harbor, ☏ +1 401 787-2321. Inshore and offshore trips for experienced anglers and newcomers alike. Target striped bass, blues, fluke & gamefish with licensed, professional captain. Nighttime trophy bass trips and island tours also offered. 
 Children's activities. Include a story hour at the library, Nature Conservancy hikes, and a petting zoo. 
 Hiking on The Greenway. More than 40% of Block Island is protected as open space. Both the Nature Conservancy and the Block Island Conservancy have been instrumental in these preservation efforts. As a result, Block Island retains its rural and undeveloped character. Hikers can enjoy twenty-five miles (40 km) of trails through grassy meadows, stone walls, inland moors and Mohegan Bluffs. The main Greenway trail runs from the Great Salt Pond south to Rodmans's Hollow and the south shore. A second trail system starts on Payne Rd. west to Fresh Pond and then connects to the Rodman's Hollow trails. The third major trail system is Clay Head Trail, starting in the north end of the island off Sachem Pond and following the bluffs of the north-east coast. In the center of the trail are the Mazes, a series of trails through woods and brush. The Clay Head Trail can be accessed at three points on Corn Neck Rd. A map of the trails is available from the Nature Conservancy and can be bought in many island stores. 
 Bird Watching. Block Island is a hotspot during Spring and Fall migration as it is on the Eastern flyway. During the breeding season, Northern Harrier and Merlin patrol the skies while Eastern Towhee and Gray Catbird are common in the thickets. 
 Rustic Rides Farm, ☏ +1 401 466-5060. West Side Road,Provides guided horseback rides on the beach, pony rides for children, and carriage rides for weddings and other special events. 
 Block Island Sport Fishing, Old Harbor, ☏ +1 401 487-2425. Fishing charters from Old Harbor, Block Island for striped bass tuna, and sharks on a safe and fast diesel powered Ridgeway express. 
The Empire Theatre: The Empire theatre may be the best and worst place to see a movie, because it is one of the oldest in all of Rhode Island. The theatre is one screen and it shows two films a night, on days that it is raining it will show its “Rainy Day Matinee”. If you are going to the Empire Theatre for a strictly viewing experience than you are going for the wrong reasons. The Empire Theatre is like stepping into a movie theatre time machine, before there was stadium seating and massive screens. Instead the seats are on a flat surface and the screen rolls down over a stage right after the musical entertainment is over, which consists of man or woman playing the piano as viewers file in. Throughout the entire film you really get that “Old School” theatre feel as you watch. It is strongly recommended that you do get there early enough to get a good seat, because the viewing from some areas is pretty poor, but overall the experience is worth it, especially to true theatre buffs.

Stay safe[edit]
Block Island is by and large a very safe locale, but as with any place there are certain precautions you can and should take to stay out of harm's way.  Far and away the most common causes of injury on Block Island are careless bicycle and moped riders.  If you plan on renting bikes or mopeds, make sure that you wear your helmets, follow the rules of the road, and absolutely do not drink while operating them.  Otherwise, just be aware that other vacationers might not follow these guidelines, and stay alert when on main roads.  When on the beach it's wise to wear sunscreen and exercise care when swimming; Block Island's waters are usually calm, but riptides are not unheard of and swimmers have been known to come across the occasional jellyfish.  The only real crime that takes places on the island almost always stems from tourists who have had a bit too much to drink: there are instances of drunk and disorderly conduct every week, accompanied by infrequent bar fights and some petty theft.  Thankfully, this is restricted almost entirely to the late night bar scene and major holidays.  As long you or your fellow vacationers don't get mixed up in any drunken shenanigans, there shouldn't be a problem.

Go next[edit]
There is a ferry service that leaves Block Island and goes to Point Judith every day of the week and throughout the year. There is also a ferry that travels to New London, Connecticut every Monday through Sunday but only operates between the dates July 1 and September 6. For more information see the get in section.
