Understand[edit]
Duke Town, Calabar
Calabar is one of the oldest trading centers in Nigeria. The city is set on a natural hill overlooking the Calabar River. Calabar had been inhabited by the Efik speaking people since at least the 17th century and became a center for slave trade at the dawn of the trade. 
After the abolition of the trans-Atlantic slave trade in the 19th century, the city became a major port for palm oil trade and other export and import commodities to and from the hinterlands. Calabar's economy unlike other neighbouring city-states in the Niger-Delta area for most of the 19th century was based on palm plantations, akin to those in the Americas.
With the coming of colonialism, between the late 19th and early 20th centuries it became one of the biggest colonial administrative centers and capital of the Niger Coast Protectorate, later called the Southern Nigeria Protectorate (1900-1914). 
Calabar is now the capital of Cross River State of Nigeria. The city is a major center of tourism in Nigeria. The Calabar Carnival is the largest street cultural festival in Africa. The carnival holds in December annually and attracts thousands of visitors and guests from all parts of the world. In a nearby municipality called Bakassi, there was a territorial dispute between Nigeria and Cameroon in 1981 based on colonial appropriations that almost caused the two countries to go to war. But Bakassi was eventually and reluctantly handed over by Nigeria to Cameroon in the end.
Like other major cities in Nigeria, power supply could be a major problem. The Federal Government of Nigeria is developing a major plant near the city to boost domestic and industrial power supply. Water is easily available in the city and it is of very good quality. 
The city is a few hours drive to the Obudu Mountain Resort which had hosted many Presidential Retreats and conferences in the past. There is an airport which has connecting flights to other major cities in Nigeria.

Map of Calabar
The local authorities have made a great effort to make the streets safe by enlarging them, removing potholes, and adding stripes between lanes.

The couple now have staff in Calabar where they care for rescued monkeys, e.g. those they capture from people trying to smuggle and export them and they also then return them to the wild at the Drill Ranch in Afi Mountains which is not too far from Calabar. You need a decent vehicle and map to get you to the ranch. The Afi Mountain Ranch (near Katabang) has cabins for guest accommodation and a forest canopy walkway (25 m high!) for people to experience the environment more closely.

Cross River National Park, which has 16 species of primates and Nigeria's most pristine remnant of rainforest, is a good place for ecotourism and wildlife viewing. But it is rather underdeveloped and will require some planning.
The Agbokim Waterfall crosses over the precipice in 6 or 7 different channels to make quite a sight, but necessitates utilizing a local guide in Ikom to the north of Calabar to find it.
If you have a lot of money to burn and want something like an all-inclusive Nigerian highlands staycation, Ubuntu Safari Lodge is about 6 hours north by car.
Douala, Cameroon, is 470 km by car, or 9 hours, but you travel through the English-speaking parts of Cameroon, where there has been a successionist guerrilla war underway since 2017.
