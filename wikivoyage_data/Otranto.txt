Otranto is a town of about 5,700 people in the Apulia region of Italy, on the Adriatic coast of Salento peninsula. It is the easternmost town of Italy.


Understand[edit]
This small town has become a main tourist destination in Apulia, representing a true gem to discover from the medieval walls of its historic center to the fine sands of the Adriatic coast.

History[edit]
The first settlement was founded by the Messapians, the native population of Salento peninsula, probably with the name of Odra. It was then rebuilt by the Greeks that renamed it as Hydrus (Ὑδροῦς – meaning "water"), becoming one of the centres of Magna Graecia. After the Roman conquest the city was called Hydruntum and became soon an important commercial port, due to its location in the easternmost point of Italy.
During the 3rd century AD Hydruntum welcomed a Jewish community that contributed to the cultural growth of the city, in which one of the most relevant libraries of Europe was built. In the 12th century this community counted about 500 families, that continued to receive protection under the rule of Emperor Frederick II, who made the town capital of the justiciarate of Terra d'Otranto (Land of Otranto), part of the Kingdom of Sicily.
In 1480 Otranto was conquered by the Ottoman troops, that beheaded about 800 civilians who refused to deny their Christian faith. The siege lasted 13 months and concluded with the liberation of the city thanks to king Ferdinand I of Naples. Otranto had been reduced to a pile of rubble and its age of splendor definitely finished, leaving to Lecce the role of cultural centre of the area.
