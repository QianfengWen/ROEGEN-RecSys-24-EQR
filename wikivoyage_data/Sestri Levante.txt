Sestri Levante is a city of 18,000 people (2011) in Liguria.

The original part of Sestri Levante is  on a peninsula, with the Baia del Silenzio (also known as "Portobello") on one side and Baia delle Favole on the other.

It seems to have belonged to the Ligurian tribe of the Tigullii.  During the Middle Ages, Sestri Levante began to expand, probably giving the fortress appearance that is due to the terrain.
In 1133, the noble family of Lavagna, the Fieschi, attacked Tigullio, the gulf in which Sestri Levante is located, however, they were fought off by the powerful Republic of Genoa, and therefore, Sestri Levante became a part of the republic, for military protection. In
