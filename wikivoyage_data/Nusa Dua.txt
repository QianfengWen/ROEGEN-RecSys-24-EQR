Sunset in Pura Geger Beach
Nusa Dua is a peninsula in South Bali, well known as an enclave of high end hotels. Nusa Dua host some of best five star hotels in Bali and is the home of the most popular golf course and a convention centre. Nusa Dua gets a lot of bad press amongst travelers as it is so artificial and sanitised. That does not change the fact though that the beaches here are glorious - white sand, deep, long and safe for swimming.

The golden sands of Nusa Dua

Understand[edit]
The place name Nusa Dua can be used in two ways: either it can refer to the entire eastern side of the Bukit Peninsula at the southern tip of Bali, or it can refer to the purpose-built, safe and rather sterile tourist enclave (Kawasan Pariwisata, quite literally Tourism District) at the southeast side of this peninsula.
This article covers everything in the Nusa Dua enclave plus the Tanjung Benoa peninsula and a few points west of the enclave to the village of Sawangan. Everything on the Bukit Peninsula to the west of Sawangan is covered by the Uluwatu article.
The public beach at Geger is the best to head to if you are not staying at Nusa Dua. This is also home to one of the best museums in Bali. The fact that it is nearly always empty is testament that most visitors who stay here in the least Balinese part of the island are, unsurprisingly, rather uninterested in learning much about Bali.
The Nusa Dua enclave has three manned gates and everyone entering is subject to a security search. This can have a slightly claustrophobic effect, and only contributes further to the impression that you are in an artificial location.

Map of the Nusa Dua area
Get in[edit]
Nusa Dua is 40 km south of Denpasar, the provincial capital of Bali. Access is easy from the Kuta area (20-30 minutes) and Jimbaran (15 minutes) on the main southern route called Jalan Bypass Ngurah Rai, which becomes Jalan Bypass Nusa Dua as it approaches the enclave.
The international airport is about 20 to 30 minutes by car and a pre-paid taxi fare from there will cost between Rp 95,000 and 110,000. If you are staying here, then your hotel will no doubt arrange to pick you up at the airport.
Public transport if far from regular in the area, but some bemos from Tegal terminal in Denpasar do ply the main bypass.

See[edit]
-8.815064115.227361 Pantai Geger (Geger Beach). This is the public beach in Nusa Dua. This splendid white sand beach at the western edge of the enclave retains lots of the character that is missing in the sanitised Nusa Dua resort zone. Generally safe for swimming and some beach side warungs. The restaurant, beachbeds and massage ladys all work for the local cooperative. By supporting them you support the locals. Geger has a cooling breeze as it is one of the few beaches facing east and because of the reef far out from the beach it has some of the warmest water temperatures in Bali. Head westwards out of the Nusa Dua enclave passing the golf course and then the St Regis Hotel (on your left). Shortly after the St Regis, take the first turning left towards to the beach and proceed to the Pantai Geger car park. (updated Apr 2017)
Pasifika museum
-8.8115.23062 Pasifika Museum, Blok P, BTDC (near Bali Collection), ☏ +62 361 774935, info@museum-pasifika.com. 10:00-18:00 daily. A truly under-appreciated and poorly known attraction. It is a splendid museum, and is highly recommended for anyone interested in the art of Bali, Southeast Asia and the South Pacific region. Look for the exhibitions focused on European artists who made Bali their home, as well as renowned local painters. The Indochinese exhibition is impressive, as are the displays of Polynesian artefacts.Featuring artworks of well known artists from around the world such us Paul Gauguin, Theo Meier, Le Mayeur, Rudolf Bonnet Hendrik Paulides and Emilio Ambron. Rp 70,000.   
Morning on the beach
-8.7325115.2355563NOT EXISTING LISTING IMAGE Serangan Island (Turtle Island). Boats are available from Nusa Dua and Tanjung Benoa. These are usually glass-bottomed allowing observation of marine life from within the boat. The island can also be accessed via a bridge. As the name suggests, Serangan is a turtle conservation area. The local people keep turtle eggs in traditional conservation houses until they hatch and then the youngster are released from local beaches. Besides turtles, they also have reptiles, birds, snakes and bats. US$25-30.

Any hotel will be able to arrange a round for you - ask about packages on offer as these can save you a lot of money. Booking a tee time is very important on this very busy course. 
Nusa Dua is home to many good quality spas. If you are staying at a luxury resort, then you will certainly have access to in-house spa and treatment facilities.

You can book directly on the beach at Nusa Dua or Tanjung Benoa, or have your hotel organise for you. All the operators work together to ensure that there is very little (if any) price difference. Expect to pay about US$25-30 for most activities.

Eat[edit]
There are not too many quality restaurants in Nusa Dua outside of the luxury hotels. Bali Collection has a dozen restaurants with reasonable prices. The main Jalan By Pass which connects Nusa Dua to Jimbaran, the airport and Kuta is the home of a large number of Japanese and other Asian restaurants aimed at tour groups, but generally these are best avoided.

 Nusa Dua Beach Grill, Geger Beach (just west of the Nusa Dua enclave reached via a small turning south off the main road to the Nikko Hotel). A great long-established dining option on a dreamy white sand beach. One of the few quality options to dine outside of hotels in the Nusa Dua area.
