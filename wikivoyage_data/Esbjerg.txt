Esbjerg is a city in Southwestern Jutland. The town was once Denmark's biggest fishing harbour, and the harbour is still an economic driving force in the town. Esbjerg has grown into an important centre for education with campuses belonging to the University of Southern Denmark and Aalborg University. The town holds an annual music festival spanning two weekends (nine days) in mid-August. 


Understand[edit]
The city of Esbjerg is Denmark's fifth largest city and has a population of 72,000 (2022). It was established around the harbour, which the state had built in 1868 as a replacement for that harbour in Altona that had been Denmark's most important North Sea harbour. In 1874 Esbjerg became connected by rail to Fredericia and Varde.
