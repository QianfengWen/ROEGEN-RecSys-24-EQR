Parachicos in the Fiesta Grande
Chiapa de Corzo is a small city in the southern Mexico state of Chiapas. It's a small town with some colonial charm and a rich indigenous heritage dating back to 1400 BC. There's a small archaeological site in town, but it's nowhere near as impressive as the big city-state sites elsewhere in Chiapas. The town is just across the river from the much larger Tuxtla Gutierrez, close to a number of nature reserves (particularly the Sumidero Canyon), has some great festivals, and is one of Mexico's designated Pueblos Magicos.


Understand[edit]




Parachicos
Parachicos are costumed, masked characters from Chiapa de Corzo who dance during the town's annual Fiesta Grande. 
Local legends say that the parachico tradition began when locals would dress up and try to cheer up a sick boy. Whatever the origins of the festival, the parachicos tradition has been named by UNESCO as part of the "intangible culture of humanity."


The town has a fascinating and very long history. Nobody is sure exactly who or when the town was first settled, but there's evidence of the Olmec living here in 1400 BC, so suffice it to say "a long time ago..." The modern history of Chiapa de Corzo begins in 1528 when Diego de Mazariegos and his band of marauding conquistadors established the first Spanish settlement here as Chiapa de los Indios. The name Chiapa de Corzo is relatively recent, named for a 19th-century politician. 
The largest indigenous group in the region is the Zoque.
The climate is very warm in Chiapas: expect hot weather during your stay in Chiapa de Corzo.

Get in[edit]
Map of Chiapa de Corzo
By plane[edit]
The nearest airport with commercial service is Tuxtla Gutierrez International Airport (TGZ IATA), officially known as Aeropuerto Internacional Ángel Albino Corzo (though never actually called that). The airport is about 35 km south of Chiapa de Corzo. Flights are available from Mexico City and other major Mexican airports.

By bus[edit]
OCC (Omnibus Cristobal Colon) buses leave San Cristobal de las Casas every 30 minutes to Tuxtla Gutierrez. Take that bus and tell the driver you want to be let off in Chiapa de Corzo. The bus will probably let you off close to the tourist embarcadero, which is where the bridge is to cross the Rio Grijalva. You can take a taxi or mototaxi from there to the main town, a few kilometers south.

Get around[edit]
You can walk around the core downtown area easily, otherwise buses, combis and taxis are readily available. Combis between Chiapa de Corzo and Tuxtla Gutierrez depart from the Zocalo (look for the van or bus that says "Tuxtla" in the windshield). A one way fare is typically M$10.

See[edit]
Fuente Chiapa de Corzo, in the Zocalo
 Plaza de Armas (Zocalo). A zocalo is a town square, and in Chiapa de Corzo, locals boast that their zocalo is bigger than the famous square in downtown Mexico City. A water fountain called La Pila is the centerpiece of the Fuente. 
Santo Domingo Church
16.706708-93.017741 Templo Santo Domingo (The Big Church), Av. Capitán Vicente López s/n. Moorish design church built in the late 16th century.

Small site, generally unknown to tourists so you are likely to have the place to yourself. Relics found here date to 1400 BC and are associated with the Olmec culture, which thrived here until about 100 AD, after which it was later occupied by the Zoque indigenous people. The oldest tomb ever discovered in Mesoamerica was found at this site. M$30.

Do[edit]
Tour boats at the Embarcadero Chiapa de Corzo
The main things to do are to take boat trips on the Rio Grijalva through the magnificent Sumidero Canyon and to hike, climb, or mountain bike in the Sumidero Canyon National Park. The canyon's sheer walls are as high as 1,000 meters in places. Like many things in Chiapas, foreign travellers seldom know much about places like Sumidero, and as a result, miss out on many of Mexico's best experiences. 
There are several different places to catch a speedboat tour, but as of April 2024 they all charge the same standardized price of M$320 per person "colectivo" style (shared with strangers, leaving only when full) for a 2+ hour tour through the whole canyon down to the dam at the far end and back. That doesn't include the nearly-mandatory tip for the boat driver, which they'll pressure you to give before taking you back to land (M$50 should be plenty). Prepare to wait up to an hour or two if there aren't a lot of visitors to fill up the boat. The boats generally include a Spanish-language tour guide, and usually can find wild crocodiles and spider monkeys along the edges of the canyon. There are also boats leaving from near the Tuxtla-San Cristóbal highway outside of town, but tour boats from within Chiapa de Corzo leave from two docks:

16.740356-93.0297761 Embarcadero Cahuare Cañon del Sumidero, Embarcadero 100. Docks where you can take a tour boat on the Rio Grijalve through the Sumidero Canyon. 
16.710025-93.0240682 Embarcadero Chiapa de Corzo. 09:00 - 16:30. Main docks for town, short walk from town square. You can take a tour boat from here through the Sumidero Canyon. Boats leave when full, with no need for reservations or to buy a tour from local touts. Departures may only be until about 14:30. 
Festivals[edit]
Fiesta Grande - 8-23 January each year is the town's biggest celebration of the year and different events are held on different days. January 8 is when you'll see the chuntas dance and 21 January is when you'll see the mock naval battle on the Rio Grijalva. Other nights have regional dances, music,  and fireworks. The celebration featuring parachico dancers allegedly has roots in regional Maya culture, though it began in the colonial era to venerate the Black Christ of Esquipulas, Saint Anthony Abbot, and Saint Sebastian. The first Fiesta Grande was in 1599 and was organized by Padre Pedro de Barrientos, pastor of the Santo Domingo church.
Fiesta de Señor de El Calvario - 7 October each year. It honors various saints and also features dances, cultural events, amusements, and fireworks.
