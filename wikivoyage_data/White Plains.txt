A view of White Plains
White Plains is only Westchester's fourth most populous city—after Yonkers, New Rochelle, and Mount Vernon—but as the county seat and home to many corporate headquarters, it's an important destination.
The hamlet of North White Plains is in the adjacent town of North Castle, but since that town does not have an article, the hamlet is covered here.
