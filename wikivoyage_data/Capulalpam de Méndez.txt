The town square is called the zocalo
Capulalpam de Méndez, usually known as simply Capulalpam, is a small village in the rugged mountains of Oaxaca in southern Mexico. The village is tiny with less than 1,500 residents, yet it was the first town in Oaxaca to be designated a Pueblo Magico. Travelers come for the town's reputation for mystical health treatments where shaman healing methods from the town's Zapotec past are embodied in the town's Indigenous Medicine Center. There's also a cool cave to explore, rock climbing, mountain biking, and a super chill zocalo to hang out at in the afternoon or evening.


Understand[edit]
The town has a cool, moist climate due to its high elevation (over 2,000 meters). In addition to the ash and oak trees that commonly grow in the forests, the town is historically known for its chokecherry trees, though various kinds of fruit trees are grown in and around town, including pear, quince, apple, and plum.
Historically, the town is known for initially resisting the Spanish invasion in 1521. Like other towns across Mexico, their efforts ultimately failed. Early Spanish missionaries included Franciscans and Augustinians, though it would be Dominicans who succeeded in converting the locals to Christianity. In the 18th century, mining was the town's main industry. The nearby Dolores mine produced gold and silver.

Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
Several buses per day go from Oaxaca to the nearby town of Ixtlan de Juarez. From there, it is a 5-mile taxi ride to Capulalpam. Buses are operated by AU and Cuenca, both are ADO companies. Tickets cost from M$60 to M$600 for the 90-minute ride, depending on time and bus class. 

By car[edit]
From Oaxaca, take federal highway MEX 175 north to Ixtlan de Juarez, then follow the signs east to Capulalpam. It's about an hour and a half drive on scenic mountain roads. Note that the road between Ixtlan de Juarez and Capulalpam is narrow, undivided, and not particularly well maintained.
