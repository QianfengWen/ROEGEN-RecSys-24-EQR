Geyikli is a village on the Troad Peninsula of Southern Marmara, 50 km south of the regional hub of Çanakkale. With a population of 3284 in 2013, it's the largest of a string of little places on or near the coast. Most visitors simply pass through to reach its ferry port (İskelesi) for the island of Bozcaada. A beach strip of holiday homes and small hotels extends south from the port through Odunluk İskelesi (meaning "wood harbour", as it once exported acorns and charcoal) to Dalyan.
This area's best known sight is  Troy, described separately. But other antiquities dot the area, the most extensive being Alexandria Troas near Dalyan.


Get in[edit]
In summer, buses run from Çanakkale via Geyikli to the ferry pier. At least two Metro Turizm buses come all the way from Istanbul, taking 7 hours. There's no winter service but you might find a  dolmuş. 
Buses coming north from Izmir stop at Ezine, where you should find a dolmuş to Geyikli. Ezine is a large town but lacks accommodation and other facilities, so if it's getting late, maybe best continue to Çanakkale and double back next morning.
By road follow D550 / E87 and look for signs for Bozcaada. From the north the turnoff is at Taştepe a few km south of Troy, from the south it's just before Ezine.
Gestaş Ferry sails from 39.8226.1641 Geyikli Harbour to Bozcaada 3 or 4 times a day, 40 min. It takes cars, and you'll need one on the island.

Get around[edit]
39°51′0″N 26°12′0″EMap of Geyikli
You need your own wheels to explore the scattered sights. The roads from Geyikli to the coast are fairly good. The road south to Alexandria Troas is narrow and potholed, but negotiable by a standard family car. Sporadic dolmuşes will be heading for Geyikli village centre, where you may have a lengthy wait, try hitching.

See[edit]
39.80426.2061 Geyikli village is modern yet ramshackle. Most travellers don't stop on their way to the ferry port: good decision.
39.7626.1482 Dalyan is the small resort at the south end of the beach strip. A little inlet at the south point was the harbour of Alexandria Troas. This included what is now the Pink Lagoon (Pembe Göl), cut off from the sea by shingle and coloured by its algae.
39.75226.1593 Alexandria Troas is the overgrown remains of a Grecian city. Founded by Antigonus in 306 BCE, it may in its heyday have housed 100,000; it lasted into Roman times. Its importance stemmed from its constructed harbour, on a coast that lacked natural shelter, and where contrary winds might thwart a sailing ship's progress into the Dardanelles for weeks on end. Probably the silting of that harbour was the reason for abandoning the city. Much of its stone has been pilfered, and the site obscured by oaks and shrubs, but you can still make out the city walls. Research excavation only got going in 2003 and so far has unearthed a stadium.
39.82226.0294 Bozcaada is the large inhabited island off Geyikli. A day-trip will be plenty, but you need a car.
39.9826.2385 Kumkale is a village that was evacuated in 1915 when Allied troops landed. This was only a diversionary attack in the run-up to the Gallipoli campaign so it wasn't followed through, but Kumkale was only slowly reoccupied from 1928. The village is nondescript but along the lane north to the coast is a memorial to the battle, and "Ajax tomb", an artillery point.
39.95826.2396  Troy is the legendary city just south of Kumkale, described on its own page.
39.99326.1867 Orhaniye Bastion is a gunnery point on the coast. It would be a nice picnic spot but is trash-strewn.
39.93626.1658 Yeniköy means "new village" and there about 70 places so-named in Turkey. This is the one in Ezine district of Çanakkale Province. It's a small port, with a couple of cafes but no accommodation. 1 km south is a beach, and "Achilles Tumulus", an ancient burial mount. 3 km inland, the shell of the Cezayirli Hasan Paşa Mansion redefines the word "dilapidated".
39.93726.0659 Tavşan Adası means "Rabbit Island" - it's the small one seen west of Yeniköy. It's just farmland with no ferry link. Don't confuse with it with Tavşan Adası in the Princes' Islands off Istanbul.
39.71226.20410 Akçakecili has a few ancient columns, remnants of a Greek village.
39.72926.2611 Neandria is the scrappy remains of another ancient Greek city.
See Babakale for the Apollo Temple further south.
