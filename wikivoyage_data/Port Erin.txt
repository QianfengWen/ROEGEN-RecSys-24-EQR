Port Erin (Manx: Purt Çhiarn – Lord's Port) is a village on the southwest coast of the Isle of Man. It was traditionally a fishing village, collecting scallops and crabs off Bradda Head, but the harbour is small with limited shelter. At low tide you can see the scraps of the breakwater built in the 1860s to improve the port, but it was destroyed by a storm. From Victorian times to the 1960s Port Erin was a holiday resort but nowadays most tourists just day-trip, and it's a very quiet place in the evening. In 2021 its population was 3730.
