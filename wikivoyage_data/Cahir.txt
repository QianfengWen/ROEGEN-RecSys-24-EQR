See[edit]
The Square is the town's pleasant well-preserved centre. It's all the better for the opening of the bypass in 2007, which diverted N24 traffic north of town to join the motorway.
52.375-7.9271 Cahir Castle, Townparks, Cahir E21 P652. Daily Oct-Feb 9:30AM-4:30PM; Mar-Jun & Sep Oct 9:30AM-5:30PM; Jun-Aug 9AM-6:30PM. Large castle on an island in the river, so it has a natural moat. It was built from 1142 over the site of a cathair or fort and enlarged to the 17th century. It was besieged twice but surrendered fairly tamely, so it was spared damage and is now one of the best preserved castles in Ireland. It passed into state hands in 1961 and is often used as a film or TV location. Adult €5, child €3, conc €4.  (updated Jul 2020)
52.377-7.9242 St Paul's is the Protestant Church of Ireland. It was designed by John Nash, not the most obvious practice ground for his Brighton Pavilion and Buckingham Palace.
52.38-7.9283 Cahir Abbey or Priory of St Mary was built from the 13th century as an Augustinian foundation. The tower is 17th-century, erected long after the Abbey was dissolved and fell into ruin.
Cahir Park stretches along the west river bank, south from town centre.
52.376-7.9324 Carrigeen Castle, to use its Sunday name, is really Cahir Bridewell or "Nick" - temporary cells for miscreants awaiting transfer to higher courts or to a definitive jail. It was built 1813-16 over an earlier fort, and embellished with mock-castellations and turrets just to show who was in charge. It closed in 1878 and became a residence; in 1976 it was converted into a B&B. The interior is private and modern so just admire it from the street unless you're staying here.
52.357-7.9235 [dead link] Swiss Cottage, Grange More, Cahir (1 km south of town). Mid-Mar to Oct: daily 10AM-6PM. Ornamental or make-believe cottage built in 1810 to a design by Nash, the inspiration being the Petit hameau at Versailles, where the nobility could cosplay in rustic garb. "Why can't those useless real peasants spruce up their hovels like this? - Footman, more chocolate." Adult €5, child €3, conc €4.  (updated Jul 2020)
52.422-7.9266 Knockgraffon north of town has a 13th century ruined church, a 16th century ruined tower house and a 12th century Motte. This is a hummock of ground usually fortified with a bailey, initially of wooden palisades then later stone walls. At Knockgraffon the bailey wasn't converted to stone, and the timber hasn't survived, so it's a Motte-with-no-Bailey.
52.304-8.1097 Mitchelstown Cave, Killavenoge E21 H920 (12 km SW of Cahir, halfway to Mitchelstown). Feb-Nov: daily 10AM-4PM; Dec Jan: Sa Su 10AM-4PM. The one you see by guided tour is the New Cave, discovered in 1833. It opened as a show cave in 1972 when stairs were cut to replace the rope ladder access. Its chambers have been used for concerts. Old Cave isn't open to the public. Adult €10, child €3.50.  (updated Jul 2020)
52.366-8.1798 Galtymore is the highest of the Galtee mountains, and you might be content to view it from a distance. A Munro of 918 m (3011 ft), it doesn't demand technical skills, but the ascent is one long slog, often steep and muddy. The usual approach is from the south by the Black Road Route, which starts from Skeheenarinky on R639. The trail leads through Glengarra Wood, where it's not worth seeking out the fragmentary remains of Galtee Castle.
