The Town of Whitby was incorporated in 1855, three years after it was chosen as the seat of government for the new County of Ontario. Although settlement dates back to 1800, it was not until 1836 that a downtown business centre was established by Whitby's founder Peter Perry.
It is named after the fishing town of Whitby in North Yorkshire, England. It is twinned with Longueuil, Quebec; Feldkirch, Austria and Whitby, England.
