Pahuatlán (also known as Pahuatlan del Valle) is a quaint village in the mountains of northwest Puebla. Sometimes described as part of the Huasteca region, the town is actually home to a large Otomi and Nahua population. It has a picturesque colonial center and is known for a number of handcrafts including weaving, pottery, and the artisans making amate paper in the nearby village of San Pablito. The town has been designated as one of Mexico's Pueblos Mágicos.


Understand[edit]
This part of Puebla is very rural with few large towns. Pahuatlán is the largest town in the municipality (county) with a population just over 3,500 in 2010. The second largest town is San Pablito with a population of almost 3,200. San Pablito is an interesting village that's worth a visit if you are interested in indigenous artesanias because it is the best source for a unique pre-Hispanic type of paper called amate that is made from tree bark. Three artisans have workshops in San Pablito and welcome visitors to learn about their traditional craft and watch it being made. (Amate may also be sold in local artesania shops or the Sunday tianguis.) Other nearby villages include Xolotla and Cuauneutla  (both of which grow a lot of coffee). 
Local culture in Pahuatlan includes traditional huapango music. The town claims to have originated the Danza de los Voladores, which is performed during town festivals. A pole for voladores is in the town's zocalo.
