For the city in Japan, see Nagoya.
Nagoya, also known as Lubuk Baja, is the main town of the island of Batam in the Riau Islands of Indonesia.


Understand[edit]
Nagoya is located on Batam Island's northern peninsula. The local government would like Batam Centre to become the center to governmental offices, business and commerce. However, private enterprise has voted for Nagoya. Nagoya is the city center where you can find most hotels, food or entertainment.
The name comes from Japanese engineers who arrived on the island in the 1970s to work on early infrastructure projects.  Lubuk Baja was where they came to drink and eat, so they dubbed it after the city of Nagoya in Japan, and the name has stuck — although the name remains informal, and in all official contexts it's Lubuk Baja.

Get in[edit]
By boat[edit]
The closest ferry terminal is at 1.1534103.99681 Harbour Bay (Jodoh), a short drive from central Nagoya, with frequent services on Horizon Fast Ferry from Singapore's HarbourFront terminal.  Visa on arrival is available.  The old ferry terminal at Batu Ampar is now closed.

By car[edit]
Nagoya is well linked by road.  During peak traffic periods, it takes about an hour to drive from Nagoya to Batam's furthest places, such as Tanjung Uncang or Nongsapura.
