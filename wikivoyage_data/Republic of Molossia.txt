Republic of Molossia (Esperanto: Respubliko de Molossia), also known as Molossia, is a micronation in Dayton, Western Nevada, with land (referred to as Farfalla colony)  near Alturas, California.
The nearest sizable city is Reno, 27 mi (43 km) away. 


Understand[edit]
This is a one-person self-proclaimed micro-nation not recognized by the United Nations or the United States of America. 
The languages spoken in Molossia are US English and Esperanto.

Get in[edit]
Entry requirements[edit]
You are required to make a reservation in advance. The president sets specific dates for entry into the micronation; slots are available approximately once per month during tourist season (April–October). If you'd like to come on one of the upcoming dates, send an email to mininfo@molossia.org with the number of people in your party. Those wishing to visit can only stay a maximum of three hours, and one hour is plenty of time to see the sites.
At the front gate, there is a mini embassy called the 39.323-119.540011 Custom House in the micronation's Red Square. Passports can be stamped, but this is not mandatory for entry.
Taking these items into Molossia is prohibited, as per their entry page on their website:

Firearms, ammunition, and explosives
Drugs and tobacco
Incandescent lightbulbs
Plastic shopping bags
Catfish
"Fresh" Spinach
Missionaries and salesmen
Onions
Walruses
Bringing in prohibited items may result in a brief detention in the whimsical "Molossia Jail & Political Prison".

By car[edit]
From Reno: Take I-580 south, then NV-341 to Virginia City, then NV-79 (Six Mile Canyon Road) to Dayton.

By plane[edit]
39.499167-119.7680562 Reno-Tahoe International Airport (RNO IATA) is the nearest major airport, around 30 mi (48 km) away. Rental cars are available to get you the rest of the way to the republic.

By train[edit]
Molossia has its own railroad system, established in 2000, but unfortunately it is completely separate from the U.S. rail system and in fact is incompatible because it uses a much smaller gauge. The gauge used in Molossia is more typical of model trains rather than passenger trains in other countries, so there is not much hope of connecting the country's trains with its neighbor's.
The nearest passenger station is in Reno, served by the California Zephyr.
