Stay safe[edit]
Port Harcourt is the centre of oil business in Nigeria. Some people have a strong feeling that the oil is "stolen" from them by local government in cooperation with foreign companies. There are frequent riots, worker strikes and regular reports of kidnapping.
Some bars and clubs, nevertheless, seem relatively safe even during the night.
