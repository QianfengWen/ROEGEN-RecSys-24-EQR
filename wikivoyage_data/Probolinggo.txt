Probolinggo is a port city on the north coast of East Java, Indonesia.


Understand[edit]
This port city has an extensive fishing industry and is the nearest town of any size to Bromo-Tengger-Semeru National Park. Since the National Park can be visited as a day trip from here, this tends to be the main draw for visitors since there is little else of interest.

Get in[edit]
7°44′49″S 113°11′58″EMap of Probolinggo
By bus[edit]
To get to Probolinggo from Surabaya, take a Damri shuttle bus from the Juanda International Airport in Surabaya to the Bungurasih bus terminal (also called Purabaya) in the city. Then take an express Patas air-conditioned bus for the 2- to 3-hr journey from Surabaya to Probolinggo (about Rp30,000).
Alternatively, you can get a train to Probolinggo station from Surabaya Gubeng. This is a comfortable air conditioned ride, taking around 2 hours.
Buses from Malang take around 2 hours.
Be sure to go all the way to the main -7.766234113.1743931 Bayuangga Bus Terminal, 6 km south-west of the centre, instead of getting dropped off at some travel agent (who will pay the driver a commission). Purchase any tickets directly at the bus terminal (or inside the bus after it leaves), as the local travel agents are notoriously mercenary and will happily charge you multiples of the real price and/or issue fake return tickets.
Minibuses to Cemoro Lawang, the nearest settlement to Mount Bromo leave from outside the terminal and take about an hour and a half. They have 15 seats and leave when they are full. Rp500,000 for the whole minibus (Rp35,000 per person).

By train[edit]
-7.742665113.2159982 Probolinggo Train Station is located in the city center. There are trains from/to Surabaya, Yogyakarta, Banyuwangi, and more.  A local bemo from the Train Station to the Bus Station (or opposite) will cost you approximately Rp4,000 per person.

Eat[edit]
Probolinggo is famous for sweet, green mangoes, known as mangga manalagi. Some people also call them mangga arumanis.

You might want to only eat half of these mangoes because they're large with high fibre content.
