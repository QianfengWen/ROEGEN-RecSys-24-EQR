Ballyshannon is a market town in southern County Donegal, 22 km south of Donegal Town, and with a population of 2300 in 2016. It's by the estuary of the River Erne and in Irish it's Béal Átha Seanaidh, "the mouth of Seannach's ford". It's best known as the birthplace of the guitarist Rory Gallagher. 
Bundoran is a beach resort 7 km west, population 1963. It's exposed to the Atlantic so it's good for surfing rather than bathing. The tourist information centre is in village centre, open M-F 11AM-3PM, Sa Su 12:30-5PM.
Belleek 8 km east is just over the border in County Fermanagh. With a population of 904 in 2011, it's famous for its pottery. 
Everywhere in County Donegal is close to the UK border, but especially the pinchpoint of this southern corner. If you take Bus 30 from Ballyshannon to Belleek, it drops you on the main road just over the border; you walk back into the Republic and across the "Magherboy salient" for 200 m before entering Northern Ireland (and exiting the European Union) a second time; and then the same in reverse to go back. In 2021 there are no border checks, but it's your responsibility to ensure your personal and car documents are valid.

1908 railway poster of Ballyshannon
"The Giants Causeway is an object which is scarcely worthy of going so far to see . . . But the salmon-leap at Ballyshannon is a scene of such a singular nature, as is not to be found elsewhere, and is as peculiar to Ireland as the bullfights are to Spain . . . " - Travel guide of 1775
Cathaleen's Falls and Assaroe Falls — so here they aren't, and free to not-see 24 hours. The River Erne descends 45 m from Belleek on the border. Cathaleen's Falls were 1 km east of town, while Assaroe Falls were mid-town near the estuary, with salmon hurling themselves upstream. They were Ballyshannon's top attraction. But in 1946 a hydroelectric scheme created Assaroe Lake and obliterated Cathaleen's Falls, while the lower river was canalised and deepened to maximise the drop for power generation, destroying Assaroe Falls.
Rory Gallagher's statue is at the junction of Main St and Castle St.

St Anne's Church (Church of Ireland) in Ballyshannon is prominent just west of Main St. It was built circa 1740 and re-built in 1840. It's believed to stand over a neolithic tomb, and the grave of a 4th- to 5th-century High King of Ireland, but there's no trace of those. The grave marked simply "Poet" holds the ashes of William Allingham (1824-1889). He was wont to write poems about faeries, but is best remembered for his descriptions of Carlyle, Tennyson and other contemporaries. The Pauper's Graveyard lies just south.
St Patrick's is the Roman Catholic church on Chapel St, east off Market St.
54.49-8.2711 Fairy Bridges are natural arches and blow holes on the coast by Bundoran Golf Course. Roughey Walk is a paved path and cyclepath north from here along Tullan Strand.
54.459-8.2612 Four Masters Bridge is an attractive three-arch stone bridge built circa 1780 across River Clowes, the boundary with County Leitrim. The Four Masters were scholars who in 1632-36 compiled the "Annals" which are one of the main primary sources for early Irish history. The chief editor was a Franciscan friar from Donegal Abbey, which was blown to smithereens in 1601. Its friars found a temporary base somewhere near this bridge, so it's thought the Annals were compiled hereabouts.
Lough Melvin is just south in County Leitrim, see Manorhamilton.
54.535-8.2493 Kilbarron Castle was a 14th century tower house. The ruin is scrappy and you just come for the clifftop views.
54.55-8.2114 Rossnowlagh Beach is 4 km long, exposed to the Atlantic and good for surfing, see Donegal Town.
54.493-7.9745 Castle Caldwell is the bosky ruin of a castle of 1612 in forests by Lower Lough Erne. Its 19th-century owner spotted the potential of the local clay and set up Belleek Pottery. He did not discover any dungeons full of strange monsters, nor hire player-adventurers to rid the castle of them, you're confusing it with Castle Caldwell and Beyond the 1985 "Dungeons and Dragons" game.
