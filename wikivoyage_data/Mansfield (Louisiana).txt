Mansfield, in Northern Louisiana, is an example of a small town with several big stories, the largest of which revolves around the American Civil War. The parish seat of DeSoto Parish (the Louisiana equivalent of a county), the city is home of several historical sites, including the first women's college in the western United States, and the site of one of the largest Civil War battles west of the Mississippi River (which was also the last major victory of the Southern States during the war).
A historic log cabin courthouse, a charming downtown square, larger-than-life stories of days gone by, and a real joie de vivre among the residents, are key signatures of this seemingly hidden city, which lies 10 miles away from the major Interstate highway in the area. Formed by frontier settlement, marked by the tragedies of the American Civil War, and built up by a sense of community, Mansfield is a surprising town surrounded by the pine forests of northwest Louisiana.

Mansfield is in northwest Louisiana, an area that sees some of the widest temperature extremes in Louisiana. Summers are typically very hot and humid, with temperatures above 100 °F (38 °C) common during this time. Although the humidity is somewhat less than the southern and central areas of Louisiana, take the same precautions for this area that you would in New Orleans or areas to the south. During the summer months, it is always advisable to carry several bottles of water in your car, and to dress appropriately for the hot weather. Winters are cool and moist, but the town is still susceptible to colder temperatures than areas further south. Some years have seen winter temperatures as low as 15 °F (−9 °C), so bring plenty of warm clothes during winter months.

Stay safe[edit]
Emergency services[edit]
As in all areas of the United States, dial 911 for any emergency services.
Law enforcement is provided by the DeSoto Parish Sheriff's Office and the Mansfield Police Department[dead link]. The Louisiana State Police patrol areas outside of the city limits and often assist on major crimes.
Fire and Emergency Medical services are provided by the Mansfield Fire Department[dead link] and DeSoto Parish EMS respectively.
Crime[edit]
Mansfield, while a very beautiful and friendly town overall, has a higher than average crime rate for most towns of its size: less than 5,000 people live here, and the chances of becoming a crime victim are 1 in 89: almost on par with some larger cities. Property crime is by far the most common, with theft and burglary being the top 2 offenses. It is advisable to spend as little time as possible outside after dark, especially in the southern half of the town, unless participating in a group activity.
The residential part of town bordered by US 84 Business to the west, Gibbs Street to the north, and the city limits to the east and south is especially inadvisable after nightfall.
During the day time, you should have no issues, but use common sense wherever you go. The aforementioned residential side of the city has beautiful church architecture and an old plantation home, but be alert. If you see someone come up to you and they look sketchy or suspicious in any way, walk or drive away.
Go next[edit]
Logansport (Louisiana) - Fishing on the Sabine River, access to Toledo Bend, last international boundary marker between the United States and the Republic of Texas.
Natchitoches - Oldest city in Louisiana, historic homes and forts, scenic downtown district on Cane River Lake.
Piney Woods - East Texas, known for forestry, lakes, old Main Street communities, and camping.
American Civil War enthusiasts[edit]
If visiting Mansfield for Civil War history, the logical next steps for southbound travelers would be to visit the monuments at the Pleasant Hill Battle Site southeast of the city on Highway 175. From there, it is a two-mile drive south to the modern town of Pleasant Hill, where you can turn left onto Highway 174 and drive east back to Interstate 49 for southbound transit.
If heading north, Shreveport offers tidbits of Civil War history and exhibits at its Spring Street Historical Museum and the Louisiana State Exhibit Museum.

Outdoors activities[edit]
For outdoors enthusiasts, heading west to the Toledo Bend Reservoir on either the Texas or Louisiana side offers a variety of opportunities for boating, camping, and fishing. An hour northeast of Mansfield near the village of Doyline is Lake Bistineau State Park, which offers both cabin, primitive, and RV camping, along with boating and fishing for bass and catfish.
