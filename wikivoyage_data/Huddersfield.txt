Huddersfield from Castle Hill
Huddersfield is in the metropolitan borough of Kirklees in West Yorkshire in England. This article covers the town of Huddersfield, and the district around it including the Colne and Holme valleys. Historically a textile town, the area is now re-inventing itself as a residential and tourist centre.


Understand[edit]
John Betjeman described Huddersfield Railway Station as having 'The finest façade of any such building in the country'. Make up your own mind when you visit as there is no better way to arrive than by train from Manchester or Leeds. Huddersfield has the third largest number of listed buildings in the country after Westminster and Bristol.
In the 1920s Huddersfield Town F.C. became the first football club to win the English League Championship three times in a row, a feat only matched by Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United.
Huddersfield can be considered a university town as the University of Huddersfield, formerly Huddersfield Polytechnic, is one of the town's largest employers and much of the local economy now depends upon it.
Famous connections include former Prime Minister Harold Wilson and actors James Mason and Gordon Kaye.
