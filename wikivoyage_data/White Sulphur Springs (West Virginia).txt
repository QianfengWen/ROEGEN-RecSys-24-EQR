White Sulphur Springs is a city of 2,350 people (2019) in West Virginia. Like neighboring Lewisburg, it's known mainly for its status as a luxury resort town, with lots of leisurely activities and the impressive five-star Greenbrier Resort. White Sulphur Springs was incorporated in 1909, and the large clear spring that inspired its name is now housed in a domed spring house on the grounds of the Greenbrier. The Civil War battle of Dry Creek was fought here in 1862.
