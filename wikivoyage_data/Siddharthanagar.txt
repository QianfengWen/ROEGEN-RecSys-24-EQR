Siddharthanagar is a city in Rupandehi District in Western Nepal.


Understand[edit]
Siddharthanagar - also known as Bhairahawa or Bhairawa - is a pleasant city of about 70,000 people on the Terai plains of Nepal.  It is 265 km (165 miles) west of the capital Kathmandu and three kilometers north of the Indian border at Sunauli.
Siddharthanagar is the main travel gateway to the Buddhist pilgrim's circuit of Lumbini, Kapilvastu and Kathmandu). Hindu pilgrims also enter Nepal here on pilgrimages to Kathmandu's Pashupatinath. Siddharthanagar is also a gateway to Nepal for overland travelers and backpackers heading for jungle and mountain treks, river rafting and other adventures.

Climate[edit]
Summer temperatures reach 35 to 38 Celsius (95-100 Fahrenheit).  Winter temperatures are 9 to 23 Celsius (48-73 Fahrenheit).  Monsoon rains usually start in June and continue into September.

By plane[edit]

Flights from Kathmandu take 35 minutes and cost about $200 for foreigners or $115 for nationals. 160 NRs airport tax applies to all domestic flights. Carriers include Buddha Air and Yeti Air.

By train[edit]
From Delhi to Gorakhpur.  A broad gauge track goes to Nautanwa from Gorakhpur but trains are infrequent so travellers may prefer to hire a taxi directly to Sunauli, taking about two hours.  Or from Nautanwa take a taxi, bus or rickshaw to Sunauli (about 5 kilometres). Cross the border to Belahiya, Nepal and immigration formalities. Then take a bus, taxi or rickshaw on to Siddharthanagar (3 km.). Total time approximately 12 - 18 hours.
From Kolkata (Calcutta) via Patna and Gorakhpur, and from Gorakhpur as from Delhi, above.  Total time approximately 10 - 12  hours.

Get around[edit]
Rickshaws are a good option within the city, or walking.  Expect to pay about 2 rupees per minute, depending on how many people you are or if you have a lot of cargo.
Un-metered taxis are now common at the major intersections as well but prepare to bargain hard.
Bicycles are an excellent way to tour the area.

See[edit]
Lumbini Garden -- 22 kilometres from Siddharthanagar, the sacred birthplace of Lord Buddha. The garden extends one kilometer east–west and 4 kilometers north–south with monasteries representing over twenty nations.  There are abundant birds and even some wildlife.
Devedaha -- 15 km. northeast of Siddharthanagar near the village of Khairhani, has archeological mounds associated with the Koliyas, the maternal tribe of the Buddha.
Ramagram 20 kilometers due east from Siddharthanagar and 4 km south of the town of Parasi  in Nawalparasi district. The remains of a stupa and monastery lie on the banks of the Jahari river near Kerwani village. The large stupa mound is about 30 ft high and 70 ft in diameter. Some have suggested that this was the center of the Koliya Kingdom. The  Koliyas of Ramagram are listed among the eight tribes that received the corporeal relics of the Buddha at Kushinagar. A Japanese funded memorial is located just to the west of the oxbow lake and a monastery is also planned. The all weather road to Ramgram is mostly unpaved and bumpy but passes through wonderful rural village scenes.
Kapilvastu is the name of an ancient Kingdom of the Shakyas -- the royal family of Lord Buddha.  It is an important part of the Buddhist Pilgrimage Circuit. Taulihawa -- administrative center of modern Kapilvastu District -- lies 40 kilometers west of Siddharthanagar or 18 kilometers from Lumbini.  Many ancient archaeological sites are situated within 10 kilometers of Taulihawa. Local roads are in good condition.
Tribeni Ghat -- a small and picturesque village by the Narayani River (known as the Gandak in India) and just across from Chitwan National Park.  An important historical, religious and cultural area due to the presence of the ancient Valmiki Ashram across the river and the auspiciousness of bathing at the ghats on the first day of Magh  (approximately 15 January).  Hundreds of thousands of Hindu pilgrims come to bathe on this holiday.  Cross the river here to visit Valmiki which is believed  to be where Prince Siddhartha got down from his horse Kantaka  and strode off on foot and into the jungles in his search for answers.

Do[edit]
Village Tours. Several tour guide companies offer village tours, especially around Lumbini.  However you can safely walk, bike, motorbike in villages in this area in daytime, unguided.
Bird Watching. In winter, local farmland is a mosaic of different crops and stubbles, marshes, irrigation channels, streams and ponds.  Away from towns, scattered small villages often have large old trees used by roosting vultures and large water birds. Especially try wetland grassland areas north of Lumbini called Khadara Phanta, particularly good for seeing the endangered Sarus Crane. Jagdishpur Reservoir is another important bird area in Kapilvastu District about 40 km NW of Lumbini.
Terai Trekking. A flatland version of mountain trekking. First performed in 1991 by two Peace Corps volunteers who walked from Siddharthanagar, to Trivenighat, and on to Chitwan, some 70 kilometers in three days via existing back roads, farm lands, forests and footpaths. It was their way of attempting to walk a Buddhist Via Dolorosa if you like, the path taken by Siddhartha who renounced his princely life at Tilaurakot and then walked and rode his steed Kantaka east into the jungles. Other versions could be day walks from Siddharthanagar to Lumbini and catching the bus back.
Buy[edit]
Palpali Brass. Search the bazaar for good deals on brassware such as kuruwa's diwas and statuary still produced in Palpa (Tansen in the hills north of Siddharthanagar.
Dhakiya -- Small round baskets with beautiful colors and designs woven from rice straw by local women. There is no established market for these, so don't forget to add a tip if they sell cheaply!
Haat Bazaar -- Siddharthanagar has one of the best weekly bazaars.  If it walks, talks, squeaks or squawks it can be found here. They are held Thursdays and Sundays, becoming active around 11AM or noon and continuing until dark.  Located about 300 meters south from Pawan Hotel, off Paklihawa Road, next to the CDO's (chief district officer) office.
