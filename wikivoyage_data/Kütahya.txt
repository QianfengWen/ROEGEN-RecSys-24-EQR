Kütahya is a city in the Central Anatolia region of Turkey, with a population in 2022 of 578,640. It's industrial but has a well-preserved old quarter, and is renowned for its decorated tiles.
Kütahya is also the name of the province. Of the other towns, the one most worth visiting (usually as a day-trip from the city) is Çavdarhisar for the Roman ruins of Aizanoi.


Understand[edit]
Inside a tile shop
Kütahya is at an elevation of 970 m, so it's routinely below freezing in winter, and summers are dry with temperatures approaching 35°C. It's in a valley hemmed in by mountains, so it's on a trade route, and industrial smog gets trapped above it. 
In antiquity this was Kotyaion (Κοτύαιον), the city of Kotys - she was a war goddess whose riotous, licentious worship would outdo any modern resort nightclub. The region was called Phrygia, which the Romans took over and divided. They assigned Kotyaion to Phrygia Salutaris, the healthy bit, since presumably they couldn't put it in Phrygia Pacatiana, the peaceful bit. It was on the edge of several empires and was captured by many - including by the proto-Mughals under Timur. One of the longer-lasting reigns was the Germiyanid kingdom of the 14th / 15th centuries, in turn overthrown by their northern neighbours the Ottomans. In 1514 the Ottomans captured Tabriz in Persia and copied a trick of Timur in bringing its artisans, especially tile-makers, to embellish their home cities. Many were Armenian Christians, who established workships here and in Iznik. These towns already made Çini - china-style ceramics - but now the artistry and production boomed. 
The Armenians fled in the pogroms of 1915 / 16 and the tile-making trade collapsed, taking 50 years to recover. Kütahya made a living from industry based on agriculture, and from standard bathroom tiles, but it was bypassed by better transport routes to the north. Travellers and freight between Istanbul and Ankara now ply the motorways, and the railway junction city of Eskişehir grew as Kütahya waned. It's a provincial place with few international visitors, though the establishment in 1992 of Dumlupınar University has given it more buzz.
39.419429.98631 The clocktower (Saat Kulesi) is the city's central landmark, on the east side of Zafer Meydanı, Victory Square. Locals refer to the spot as Vazo, the Vase, for the tiled monument on the traffic roundabout - this is 3 m high but less easy to spot if you're new to town. 
The provincial governership (Valilik) is in a kitsch, faux Ottoman-arched building west side of the square, while the town council (Belediye) occupy a modern building east side. All the main streets converge here. Atatürk Bulvarı heads north to the bus station and becomes the main highway to Eskişehir. Abdurrahman Kara Ağa Bulvarı (commonly İstasyon Cd, Station Street) leads northeast to the railway station. Cumhuriyet Caddesi, Republic Street, starts southwest but turns into the pedestrianised Lise Cd, towards Old Town, Great Mosque and the castle. Adnan Menderes Bulvarı runs west and Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bulvarı runs east.

By bus[edit]
Buses from Istanbul run every hour or two and take six hours, for a fare in 2022 of about 300 TL. They may run via Gebze, Izmit and Adapazari or via Bursa. 
Buses from Antalya take 7 hours. Buses run every couple of hours from Ankara (4 hr 15 min) but usually you take the YHT train to Eskişehir. From Eskişehir it's a frequent bus, taking an hour.
Buses from Izmir take 5 hours via Turgutlu, Salihli (for Sardis), Kula, Gediz and Çavdarhisar. They continue via İnegöl to Bursa. 
Operators on these routes are Metroturizm, Pamukkale, Flix Bus and Kütahyalılar.
The 39.442530.00581 bus station is 4 km northeast on D230 towards Eskişehir. It's a modern building with a few small shops (including for the inevitable tiles), cafe, toilets and left luggage. It's usually fairly clean. The old city centre otogar has been demolished. 
Frequent minibuses take 15 min to the centre. Your inter-city bus ticket should be good for this transfer, check when buying.

By train[edit]
Izmir Mavi runs daily from Ankara at 19:00 via Eskişehir at 22:15 to reach Kütahya at 23:30.

39.42302 Kütahya railway station, elegantly tiled, is 1 km east of city centre, at the end of Abdurrahman Kara Ağa Blvd, across the main highway D650.

By road[edit]
The Tile Mosque
From either Istanbul or Ankara head towards Eskişehir, then pick up D230 / D650 south. This winds through the canyons but is a good divided highway. D650 continues south from Kütahya all the way to Antalya.
From Izmir take E96 / D300 east towards Uşak and branch off onto D595 / D240.

By plane[edit]
39.111430.133 Zafer Havalimanı (KZR  IATA Victory Airport) (45 km southeast of the city). The airport has flights from both Istanbul airports: from IST IATA by Turkish Airlines, and from SAW IATA by Pegasus. Havaş buses connect the airport to Kütahya, Afyon and Uşak, departing 25 minutes after each flight arrives. They stop at the university and at their office near "the Vase" before terminating at the bus station.   (updated Aug 2022)

Get around[edit]
Walk, the sights are all central, and you're unlikely to use either the  dolmuşes (various colours) or yellow city buses.

Do[edit]
Hot springs and hamams: this is a geothermal area.
Football: Kütahyaspor play soccer in TFF Third League, Turkey's fourth tier. Their home ground is Dumlupınar Stadium (capacity 11,500), 500 m southeast of town centre.
Buy[edit]
Supermarkets: Migros is the most central, just north of "the vase" behind Hilton Garden Inn. It's open daily 09:00-22:00.
Banks and ATMs also cluster in this area.
Tiles (çini) are the big thing here. They come in three grades. Turist işi is the basic stuff in souvenir shops. If you're looking for something that the cat will knock off the table or the kids crack in cookery experiments, go for these, and haggle. Fabrika işi is quality work prepared by apprentices under the supervision of a çinici, a master maker, and his / her own personal work is özel iş. There are shops just north of the Vazo at the beginning of Atatürk Blv, and south towards old town. Çiniciler Çarşısı ("Tile Bazaar") is on the retail park 5 km out on the Eskişehir highway. Think about the weight in your home-bound luggage, and the average baggage-handler's limited appreciation of the grades of traditional tiles. All the produce is modern, and if it's touted as antique, with any luck it's fake. If you're unlucky, you'll be in big trouble for trying to export a genuine antiquity.
