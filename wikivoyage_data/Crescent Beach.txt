Crescent Beach is a beach town in St. Johns County, Florida, in the First Coast region of the state.


Understand[edit]
The town is on one of the numerous barrier islands on Florida's east coast. It is bounded by the Intracoastal Waterway to the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the east. To its north are the towns of Butler Beach and St. Augustine Beach, and to its south is Matanzas Inlet, Fort Matanzas, and the small town of Summer Haven.
The town has a subtropical climate bordering on temperate. The beach can be battered by tropical storms during hurricane season, between June and October. Summers are hot and humid, while winters are cool to mild.
Due to the town's unincorporated status and its proximity to St. Augustine, addresses in the city use "St. Augustine" as their city even though the town is several miles outside the St. Augustine city limits.

Get in[edit]
FL-A1A provides access to the town, passing through it to the north and south.

29.715278-81.2391671 Fort Matanzas National Monument, 8635 A1A South (parking available west of FL-A1A), ☏ +1 904 471-0116. Daily 9AM to 5:30PM. This small watchtower was built in the 1740s on a small island south of the city to control access via the Matanzas River. Eight ferries a day take visitors from Anastasia Island to the marsh where the fort sits. Free passes for the boat can be picked up at the visitors center there, where a half-mile boardwalk nature trail loops through the woods and dunes (a good way to spend the time waiting for the next ferry). Free admission.   (updated Jul 2018)
