Kelso is a small market town in the Borders region of southern Scotland, with a population of 6900 in 2020. Its name probably derives from Calk Heugh - the "chalk outcrop" which its two rivers cut through. These are the Teviot and Tweed, joining here, both famed for salmon fishing. The town grew up around its Abbey, whose monks farmed the fertile valleys. Its town centre is of a style common in northern France and the Low Countries but rare in Scotland, with a large market square, and Flemish-style buildings. The main reasons to visit are the Abbey and Floors Castle.
Difficult to believe now, but the tiny village of Roxburgh five miles south was once an important settlement, and indeed briefly the capital of Scotland.

Built 1128-1143 by the Tironensian monastic order (who'd split from the Benedictines), this was once one of the wealthiest and grandest monasteries in Scotland. But it suffered repeated attack and destruction, and was in a poor state even before the 1560 Reformation. All that remains is the west tower and the transept, still a striking piece of Romanesque architecture. Free.   (updated Jan 2019)
Kelso Square has well preserved 18th- and 19th-century architecture reminiscent of the low countries.

Grand mansion built in 1720 by William Adam, and embellished with cod-castellations in the 19th century.

55.5964-2.45673 Roxburgh Castle, Kay Brae TD5 8LT. 24 hours. Ruins of a medieval castle established by David I and birthplace of Alexander III. The castle was strategically important from the 12th to the 15th centuries and the adjoining town of Roxburgh (of which nothing is now visible) was a royal burgh and centre of agricultural trade with Europe. The ruins are scrappy, as the Scots destroyed it in the 16th century to put it beyond English use. The main remnants are the earthwork mound topped by stone fortifications, and the main gate on the west side. Free.   (updated Mar 2022)
