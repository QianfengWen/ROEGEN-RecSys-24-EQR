View of the town
Kuujjuuaq (formerly Fort Chimo) is in the Nunavik region of Northern Quebec. It is the largest community in Nunavik, with a total population of 2,754 (2016). "Kuujjuaq" means "great river" in the Inuktitut language. After the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement, a dam reduced the river’s flow.


Understand[edit]
Kuujjuaq is located on the west shore of the Koksoak River, about 50 km upstream from Ungava Bay, in the boreal forest. Black spruce and larch grow in the marshy valleys around the village. The annual migrations of the George River caribou herd pass through the region throughout August and September.
Inuktitut is commonly used, and many older people speak only that language. About 90% of the population is Inuit; anyone who is not Inuit is Qallunaat.  
The village's hospital serves the population of Ungava Bay. The village has hotels, restaurants, stores, arts and crafts shops and a CIBC bank with 24-hour ATM.

History[edit]
Around 1830, the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) started the fur trade business in Nunavik by establishing a post on the east shore of the Koksoak River, about 5 km downstream from the present-day settlement. Inuit, Montagnais and Naskapi people came to trade at the post.
In 1942, a U.S. Air Force base (Crystal 1) was built on the west shore of the Koksoak River, where Kuujjuaq is now. The American presence between 1941 and 1945 sped up the development of the community. After the end of World War II, the United States turned the base over to the Canadian government. In 1948, a Catholic mission was established, followed by a nursing station, a school and a weather station. When the HBC moved upstream closer to the airstrips in 1958, it was followed by the remaining families that still lived across the river at Fort Chimo. In 1961, a co-operative was created.

Climate[edit]
In summer, expect bright sunshine, wind, rain and perhaps even snow. Pack long underwear, a fleece jacket, knitted hat, polarized sunglasses, insect repellent and protective clothing. Mosquitos can be particularly difficult in summer.
Snow can arrive as early as mid-September. In winter, blizzards can whip up in just a few hours. 
Average regional temperatures:

Winter: −23.6 °C (−10.5 °F)

August: 10.4 °C (50.7 °F)
