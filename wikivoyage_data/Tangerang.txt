Tangerang is a city in the province of Banten, and part of the Jabodetabek Greater Jakarta metropolitan area, just west of the Indonesian capital Jakarta. With a population of over 2 million, Tangerang is mainly a commuter city for Jakarta. Although the city has a long history dating back to a 17th-century Dutch colonial fortress, the vast majority of the city consists of extensive new housing developments. Jakarta's main international airport, Soekarno-Hatta, is in Tangerang. Just south of the city is the independent city of South Tangerang.


Understand[edit]
Like most parts of the Jakarta metropolitan area, the area is heavily traffic congested and disorderly, except in some modern housing developments that are maintained by private companies, such as Lippo Karawaci. While such areas have not been designed for tourism, but specifically for the residents, they include attractions such as shopping malls, restaurants, and golf courses. Similar developments, including the major BSD City, are in the neighbouring city of South Tangerang.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Jakarta's main international airport is located in Tangerang. -6.12751106.653681 Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (CGK IATA) is in the northern part of the city.

By taxi[edit]
You can use a metered taxi to reach Tangerang from Jakarta. The cost for a taxi from Central Jakarta to Tangerang is approximately Rp150,000. The trip will take 1 hour without traffic, but commonly up to 2 hours. It is recommended to order the taxi from one of the reputable taxi companies, such as Blue Bird or Express, because taxis hailed on the street may refuse to exit Jakarta and go to Tangerang. Taxis from Jakarta are not allowed to take any passengers from Tangerang to Jakarta.

By bus[edit]
The largest bus terminal in the city of Tangerang is -6.17312106.66472 Poris Plawad bus terminal, east of the city centre opposite Batuceper railway station. The terminal serves a wide range of highly frequent local buses and minibuses to and from destinations throughout Tangerang, Jakarta, and South Tangerang. Many of these buses nowadays have air conditioning, but they are far from comfortable. From Tangerang to Jakarta, the ticket price is about Rp7,000 to Rp10,000. Tangerang is also served by Transjakarta bus rapid transit services. From the Poris Plawad bus terminal, two lines are operated to Pasar Baru in Central Jakarta and to Senayan in South Jakarta, both via Kebon Jeruk (West Jakarta). The ticket price is Rp3,500.
In addition, there are regular buses to cities such as Bandung and Merak and daily long-distance buses to Central and East Java. There is also a wide range of bus routes available from the bus terminal at the airport.

By train[edit]
Tangerang is served by the brown line of Jakarta's commuter train network (KA Commuter Jabodetabek). -6.1769106.6333 Tangerang railway station in the city centre is the western terminus of this line. Other stations served within the city of Tangerang include Tanah Tinggi, Batuceper, and Poris. The eastern terminus of the brown line is Duri station in West Jakarta, where you can change to and from the yellow line to other parts of Jakarta as well as Bogor, and to long-distance trains to Merak. From the stations in Tangerang, long-distance trains are no longer operated.

The cheapest way to get around in Tangerang is, as in the other major Indonesian cities, by minibus (angkot). Angkots follow a fixed route (there are various routes throughout the city), but there is no fixed schedule and there are no fixed stops. To get on, simply raise your hand. To get off, simply shout "Kiri!" to the driver, so he will pull over on the left (Indonesian: kiri) side of the road. The price of an angkot ride within the city is usually about Rp2,000 to 5,000. It is best to ask a local which angkot route to take, and how to recognise the location you want to get off.
The easiest way to get around in Tangerang is by taxi. Taxi ranks are available outside the shopping malls and hotels. The main reputable taxi companies of Jakarta, including Blue Bird and Express, also have a branch in Tangerang. Premium taxis like Silverbird will offer you with better comfort and safety, but price is around 50% more expensive than regular taxis.

Splurge[edit]
Stay safe[edit]
Local law enforcement is unreliable, so you may want to be even more cautious than you do in your hometown. If you are planning to draw your money in the ATM nearby (even in the mall) on Saturday, Sunday, and public holidays, look around to make sure there's nobody wearing civilian uniforms welcomes you and pretends he will guard you. If you are trapped by his 'artificial' kindness, once you finished your banking activities, he will call his crime-partners outside to come in and pressure you to hand over your belongings. Some of them may murder you, even after you have done what they asked. Make sure that the ATM you visit is monitored by a camera.
