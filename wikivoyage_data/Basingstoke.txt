Basingstoke  is a market town in Hampshire. It has been around since the Domesday Book, but was developed as a 'new town', one of several constructed in the 1950s to accommodate overspill population from London. Throughout the 1970s and 80s it was often considered a joke 'dull' town with nothing to offer and had very little to entertain any visitors unless they were into trainspotting or roundabouts. Itis alleged that Basingstoke has the highest number of roundabouts per head population of any UK town, but it's probably no longer true!
21st-century redevelopment of the town centre has seen the growth of a huge shopping area, lots of restaurants and new cinemas and theatre. Basingstoke, it seems, has grown up!

By foot[edit]
Basingstoke has a decently-sized town centre including a shopping centre, cinema and variety of pubs and restaurants all walking distance from the train or bus station. Furthermore, there is a leisure park on the western side of town including an ice rink and cinema that's also walking distance, albeit crossing a few busy main roads.

By bus[edit]
Basingstoke is well served by buses.  The central bus station is situated in the town center and most buses stop at the station.  The buses are regular and serve most outlying areas of the town. Indeed the buses are efficient and the bus stops clearly marked

By car[edit]
Basingstoke is easy to drive around and the town center does not suffer from much congestion (except for at peak times).  There is ample parking in both 'Top of Town' and Festival Place and the town's ring road (called 'Ringway') makes it easy to access any part of Basingstoke without much trouble.
The Park and Ride facility is served by three Centre Shuttle buses, see National Park and Ride Directory
