Downpatrick is a town in County Down in Northern Ireland. It's claimed to be the site of one of the first churches founded by Saint Patrick, at nearby Saul; this was also the place of his death and he was brought to Downpatrick for burial. The area is dotted with prehistoric and early Christian sites, while Downpatrick itself is a small market town. Belfast is only 21 miles to the north so it's become a commuter town, with a population in 2011 of 10,822.

See[edit]
Down Cathedral
Town centre has many pleasant Georgian buildings along English St and Irish St.
54.327-5.7221 Down Cathedral (Cathedral Church of Holy Trinity), 35 English St BT30 6AB, ☏ +44 28 4461 4922, info@downcathedral.org. M-Sa 11AM-4PM. This is claimed to have been the burial place of St Patrick in 461, with St Brigid and St Columba alongside. Multiple churches since that time have been swept away: the present Church of Ireland (Anglican) building from 1818 set out to be so relentlessly medieval Gothic that truly medieval material survives only in traces. These include two 12th-century crosses, an 11th-century font, and part of the walls of the 13th-century Benedictine Abbey. The 10th-century High Cross is a replica: the original suffered weathering and was moved to the nearby museum. A massive granite slab was placed over St Patrick's grave in 1900, to curb a fashion among emigrants of taking a handful of soil away with them. Free. (updated Oct 2020)
54.3285-5.71962 Down County Museum, The Mall, English Street BT30 6AH, ☏ +44 28 4461 5218, mail@downcountymuseum.com. W-Sa 10AM-4PM. This was the county jail in the late 18th century, and United Irishman Thomas Russell was hanged at its gates in 1803. The museum permanent collections cover an overview of town history, the High Cross, farming and the jail. Free. (updated Oct 2020)
54.32742-5.718773 St Patrick Centre, 53A Market St BT30 6LZ, ☏ +44 28 4461 9000, director@saintpatrickcentre.com. M-Sa 9AM-5PM. If you don't know much about the "real" St Patrick, patron saint of Ireland, you're in very good company — most detail is the invention of much later hagiographers. The medieval Armagh scholars were especially busy and inventive, since the primacy of their church depended on the primacy of St Patrick. This gallery and IMAX show explores what we know and why he still matters. Adult £5.75, child £3.50, conc £4.50. (updated Oct 2020)
Inch Abbey
54.337-5.734 Inch Abbey, Inch Abbey Road BT30 9AT. 24 hours. Founded before AD 800 on what was then a drumlin island in the marshes. The remains there nowadays are from the 12th-century Cistercian Abbey, which looks to have been small but wealthy. The Cistercians believed in manual labour, farming to support themselves, as well as prayer, abstinence, and above all No damned Irish! The ruin is scenically sited on the west bank of the River Quoile: either approach via A7 Belfast Road or take the steam railway to the Abbey station. Free.  (updated Oct 2020)
54.35-5.75 Quoile Castle is the shell of a 16th century tower house, along A25 a mile or so northeast of town. The riverbank is a wetland wildlife reserve.
54.344-5.6796 Saul Church was built in 1933, with a replica Round Tower, and incorporating fragments of a medieval abbey. Saul derives from sabhall, barn, where St Patrick is said to have sheltered and preached after the Strangford Lough currents spat him ashore nearby. His colossal statue on the hill is also modern.
 Ballydugan Medieval Settlement, Drumcullan Rd BT30 8HZT (next to Ballydugan Mills). Recreation of a medieval village opened in summer 2020, but they overdid the realism when the Black Death forced suspension of its activities. (updated Oct 2020)
54.29-5.7267 Ballynoe Stone Circle, Ballynoe Rd BT30 8ET (two miles south of town). 24 hours. A stone circle some 30 yards in diameter with 50 upright stones closely placed. The site seems to have been in use from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age. Free.  (updated Oct 2020)
54.3241-5.6788 Struell Wells, Struell Wells Road BT30 6RL (two miles east of town). 24 hours. Sruthail means stream. It flows down a rocky valley, partly underground, supplying a series of wells with supposed healing or holy properties. Inevitably Saint Patrick gets in on the act, but the site predates him. There are four main wells, and the bath houses you see now are from the 17th century. Pilgrims conducted complicated penances and observances, but in the 19th century they became rowdy so there was a clamp-down. The wells dried up around 2006 when the culverts feeding them fell into disrepair, but this has been remedied. Free. (updated Oct 2020)
54.448-5.839 Rowallane Garden, Crossgar Road, Saintfield BT24 7LH, ☏ +44 28 9751 0131. Daily 10AM-4PM. Extensive garden founded in the 1860s with many exotic species. Adult £8, child £4, NT free.  (updated Oct 2020)
54.253-5.60110 Ardglass is a fishing village ringed by medieval turrets in various stages of decay. Jordan's Castle, south end of Quay Street by the golf club, is the only one you can visit within. Isabella's Tower to the west however is a Victorian folly. Ardtole church is a 15th-century ruin on the hill north of the village.
Legananny Dolmen: see Newcastle (Down) for this impressive 5000 year-old megalithic tripod, and for Finnis Souterrain nearby.

The railway from Belfast reached Downpatrick in 1859 and Newcastle in 1869. The line closed in 1950; it re-opened in 1987 as a heritage railway. Steam trains chunter down 3 miles of track to Inch Abbey; see website for schedule of running days. The two locomotives are 0-4-0 "Sugarpuffs" built by O&K of Berlin in 1934/35 for the Irish sugar beet factories: Thurles #1 and Mallow #3. After they were replaced by diesel shunters in the 1960s, a railway enthusiast went to considerable trouble and expense to preserve them for use on a British heritage railway, as he'd been assured — correctly — that they were standard gauge. It was 15 years down the line before he discovered that they were Irish standard gauge of 1600 mm, which all mainline railways across Ireland use to this day. The locos couldn't possibly run on the British and European standard gauge of 1435 mm. Adult £8, child £6. (updated Oct 2020)

This has National Hunt (jumps) meetings, mostly Mar-Oct. Horse-racing is on an all-Ireland basis so the course follows the Irish not the UK race season. (updated Oct 2020)
