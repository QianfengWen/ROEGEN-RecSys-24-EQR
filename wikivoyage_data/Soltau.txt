Soltau is a town on the Lüneburg Heath in North Germany with around 21,000 residents in 2021. It has gained national prominence largely as a result of the attractions such as the Soltau Therme thermal baths and the Heide Park, one of Germany's biggest amusement parks. The large lake of Südsee is also popular with caravanners, campers and day visitors alike.


Understand[edit]
The old Soltau town hall (Rathaus)
The parish of Soltau was founded around 830 by a few farmers, and the first wooden church was built around this time.
Between 1383 and 1388 the village was established, in order to protect against robber barons; this is now the town centre. The castle there was demolished under terms of a treaty. By way of compensation Soltau was given town rights; however, by 1511 the town was completely destroyed by a fire.
The town hall was moved in 1533 and established in an old chapel in Marktstraße. However, by 1567, another fire wiped out the majority of buildings within the town. Much of Soltau was destroyed over the years, especially in the Thirty Years War, after which all that was left was ruined landscape.
By 1914 Soltau held the largest prisoner-of-war camp in Germany during the First World War. This was the same year that the mining of potassium salts began at Heinrichssegen Shaft, but work was then halted due to the war after having reached a depth of just 6 metres.
Again by April 1945 much of Soltau was destroyed by air raids in which many civilians were killed. Soltau become a British Garrison in 1949 during the Cold War and was home of Headquarters 7th Armoured Brigade. This was handed back in 1993 and is now used for doctors' surgeries and a business centre.
Situated in the heart of the Lüneburg Heath, Soltau is an officially recognized health resort. Here, active hikers and cyclists will find more than 1400 km (875 miles) of well sign-posted trails leading through romantic heath land, peaceful villages, and river valleys.
