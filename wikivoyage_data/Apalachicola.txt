Apalachicola is a city on the Forgotten Coast of the Florida Panhandle, on the Apalachicola River and Bay.


Understand[edit]
Miles of uncrowded pristine beaches, an endless supply of protected shallow bays, excellent fishing and acres of national and state forests to explore. Fine oysters and other seafood. Apalachicola or "Apalach", was established in 1831. It was once the third largest port on the Gulf of Mexico. Wide, tree lined streets are still graced by picturesque homes from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries show the wealth and craftsmanship of its early days.  Apalachicola has over 900 historic homes and buildings listed in its extensive National Register District and it was selected as one of the nation's Dozen Distinctive Destinations in 2008 by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.
The Apalachicola basin encompasses what is considered one of the least polluted, most undeveloped, ecologically diverse systems left in the United States. The Apalachicola Estuarine Research Reserve (ANERR) oversees the health of this vast system. The ANERR is the second largest in the nation with over 246,000 acres under its protection. Apalachicola's vibrant history and rich maritime culture can still be seen on its working waterfront. Buildings that once served as 19th century ship's chandleries, old net factories and a sponge warehouse now house a mix of eclectic and trendy shops, restaurants, galleries and meticulously restored hotels and B&Bs.
These locally owned and operated businesses create a quaint and friendly atmosphere for visitors as well as local residents. A grand theater lies in the center of town (see "Do" below).
