Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Sammamish River at Marymoor Park in Redmond
Main article: Seattle-Tacoma International Airport
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA IATA), nicknamed "Sea-Tac", is the nearest major airport. To get to Redmond by public transit from the airport, the best way is to take Sound Transit Link light rail to Downtown Seattle, and then transfer to the Sound Transit Express bus route 545 (see #By bus). Exit Link at International District/Chinatown Station, then walk over to the bus stop on 4th Avenue South.

By train[edit]
Amtrak provides service to Seattle's King Street Station. To get to Redmond, take Sound Transit Express bus route 545 (see #By bus), which stops just around the corner from the station, on 4th Avenue South.

By car[edit]
 from  &  SR-520 Connects Redmond to I-405 (Exit #14), north of downtown Bellevue and I-5 (Exit #168B), south of Lake Union, between downtown Seattle and the University District. The SR-520 bridge crossing Lake Washington is a toll bridge. Tolls vary depending on the time of day and is automatically deducted from a prepaid "Good to Go" pass on the windshield of the car. If no "Good to Go" tag is on the windshield the transponders take a picture of the license plates, front and back, and mail the toll bill to the legal owner of the vehicle. There are no toll booths to collect the tolls.

East Lake Sammamish Pkwy goes 12 mi (19 km) along the east side of Lake Sammamish from Front St &  (Exit #17), north of Issaquah, to its intersection with SR-202 just east of downtown Redmond. Front St continues south though Issaquah and connects to   at "Issaquah-Hobart Rd".
West Lake Sammamish Pkwy  goes 10 mi (16 km) along the west side of Lake Sammamish to Exit #13 of I-90 (Lakewood Blvd) just west of Issaquah.
By bus[edit]
For intercity bus services beyond the region, travel to Seattle.

By bicycle[edit]
Given that Redmond styles itself the "Biking Capital of the Country", you might expect Redmond to be accessible by bike from surrounding areas, but this isn't always the case. Redmond is internally well-connected by bicycle paths, but getting into Redmond, especially from areas due west like Kirkland, can be more difficult than you'd expect.

From the south The 520 Bike Trail offers the safest route into Redmond, as a paved trail separate from the road. 520 Terminates at the Sammamish River near Leary Rd directly south of Downtown and offers connections to several other bike trails from there. West Lake Sammamish Pkway has a bikelane, but it is not protected from high-speed vehicles and can feel very dangerous to ride.
From the west Redmond Rd does not have bike lanes, so the main artery into the city from areas west of Redmond is inaccessible to bicycle traffic. The best option for getting into Redmond from Kirkland is to take Old Redmond Rd, which does have bike lanes (unprotected, but better than nothing) and either taking 154th Ave NE South to connect with the 520 Bike Trail, or riding the short distance from the end of Old Redmond Rd east to the trails on Leary Rd
Get around[edit]

Downtown Redmond is walkable, but better yet, get a bike (see #Do), as it is flat and bike-friendly. The city has numerous trails and the only velodrome in the state of Washington (at Marymoor Park). Just be careful, as some trails end on extremely busy roads. King County has great information on biking paths and trails[dead link].
Outside of downtown, you are probably best off driving, though public transit is available in some areas.

Microsoft Visitor Center
47.6422-122.13691 Microsoft Visitor Center, 15010 NE 36th St (Microsoft Building 92), ☏ +1 425 703-6214. M 10AM-7PM, Tu-F 9AM-7PM; occasionally closed early or all day. The majority of the campus is comprised of office buildings closed to the public, but there is a Visitor's Center. It's not much more than a few small marketing displays, rather than a decent history or behind-the-scenes museum. There's also a large Microsoft Store, which to its credit does have a lot of exclusive merchandise you can't buy elsewhere. To give you an idea of how underwhelming the Visitor Center is, the most popular attraction appears to be taking photos with the large Microsoft sign in front of the building. If this would be your only reason to journey to Redmond, skip it and go to the Living Computer: Museum + Labs in SoDo instead.   (updated Dec 2018)
