Odessa is a city of 120,000 people (2018) in West Texas, 20 mi (32 km) west of its sister city, Midland. Much of the major industry in the area is oil- and gas-related. As such, the Midland/Odessa area is colloquially known as the petroplex. Many of the attractions you will find in the area are in Midland, so if you're visiting Odessa, the Midland article deserves a look as well. It's also notable as the fountainhead for the Friday Night Lights media franchise, which began with a 1990 book that explored football at the city's Permian High School, later followed by a movie that was mostly faithful to the book, and then a TV series that was a looser adaptation.
