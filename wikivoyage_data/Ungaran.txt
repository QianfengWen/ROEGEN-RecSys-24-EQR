The corridor 2 of Trans Semarang bus connects Terboyo in Semarang and -7.1203110.40421 Sisemut bus terminal in Ungaran.

Ungaran is 25 km from Semarang. These are two alternatives, you may use Route 20 National Road or use Route 6 Trans-Java Toll Road (Semarang-Solo) and exit through Ungaran toll gate.

Semarang taxis consider Ungaran to be within the city limits, so are happy to travel there. If traffic isn't too heavy, the journey will not be much more than 30 minutes.
