Varberg is a city in Halland on Sweden's west coast approximately 70 kilometres south of Gothenburg. The municipality, Varbergs kommun, has around 65,000 inhabitants, with half of them in Varberg. Varberg is known for its beaches, crowded at summer with visitors from many parts of Sweden.
Among other attractions is Varbergs fästning, a coastal fortress with a museum, and the Grimeton radio station, a UNESCO World Heritage site.


Understand[edit]
During the Middle Ages, Halland was part of Denmark. Varberg had city privileges at least since the early 14th century, and has been an important centre of commerce since then. In the 16th and 17th century, the expanding Swedish Empire fought Denmark over the southern Scandinavian provinces, eventually annexing Halland in 1645. The fortress was expanded during the centuries, but was decommissioned in 1830 and is a museum today.
