Lishui (丽水市) is a city in Zhejiang province.


Understand[edit]
The area now known as Lishui (丽水 Líshuǐ) has been populated since the Neolithic age. The current city of Lishui was founded in 589 AD during the reign of emperor Yang Jiang of the Sui dynasty as Chuzhou (处州). The name of Lishui is first attested in 621 as a county administered from Chuzhou. The name of the city finally got the name of Lishui during the Qing or Ming dynasty. During the Ming dynasty both pagodas by the city were built. During the Sino-Japanese war Lishui was the administrative capital of the non-occupied Zhejiang province after the fall of Hangzhou. The current administrative unit of Lishui City was created in 2000. The pronunciation of its first character is "lí" instead of the usual "lì".

There's no bus that passes by, nor a parking lot of any real sort, so it's recommended to take a bike or electric scooter there. There's a wee little fenced off area that people park their two-wheeled vehicles in, from which it's an easy few flights of stairs up to the pagoda). A Ming Dynasty pagoda in pretty good condition. The best time to visit is sunset, when one can take full advantage of the western-facing view of the city and its mountains. Make sure to wander around a little, and check out the connected temple, which can be accessed through a small shrine half built into a rock, off the right of the path up to the temple. (updated Feb 2019)

Local villagers grow fruit (tangerines, peaches, mulberries, bayberries) in those mountains, so there are plenty of trails used by farmers. You'll also pass through many old villages with absolutely stunning views and virtually no tourists (since the only 'official' hiking spots are Baiyun Shan, Nanming Shan, Dongxiyen and Kuocang Ancient Rd.).

Connect[edit]
Cope[edit]
Lishui has much better air quality than the rest of China. It is also cleaner and the people are very friendly. Traffic is much safer as people drive more carefully and have more respect for traffic rules than the rest of China. However, the tap water in Lishui is not potable. Most large places will have Western toilets and smaller places might have a Western toilet as the handicapped option. Bring your own toilet paper and hand soap and if there's a bin beside the toilet then use that as most toilets cannot handle paper. International credit cards are generally not accepted so carry plenty of cash. ICBC, CCB and Bank of China ATMs are best for international withdrawals.
