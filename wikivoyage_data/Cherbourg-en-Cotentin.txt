Cherbourg is a port town at the north end of the Cotentin Peninsula in Normandy, France.
Cherbourg is located near the D-Day beaches where Allied forces landed in 1944 during World War II. The town was liberated by American troops shortly after that.


Understand[edit]
The municipality was established in 2016 by merger of the former communes of Cherbourg-Octeville, Équeurdreville-Hainneville, La Glacerie, Querqueville and Tourlaville.

Get in[edit]
Cherbourg Harbour
By ferry[edit]
Cherbourg can be reached by ferry from Poole and Portsmouth in the UK. Crossing times are 4½ hours from Poole and 3 hours from Portsmouth with Brittany Ferries. It is also possible to reach Cherbourg from Rosslare in Ireland with Irish Ferries, crossing time is around 19-20 hours depending on season.  If you're on foot, the ferry terminal is close to the centre of town but you have to take a long roundabout route if you try to walk.  There is a free shuttle leaving shortly after the ferries arrive, which takes you to La Cite de la Mer - which is still a 5-10 minute walk to the old town.  You can also get taxis from the terminal - ask the staff to call one if necessary.

By car[edit]
Cherbourg is easily accessible from Normandy and the rest of France and is around 6 hr from Paris and around 11 hr from Bordeaux.  There is not much traffic except during rush hours. There is limited parking close to the old town (e.g., at the station) and you may have to pay for it during the day.

By train[edit]
49.633333-1.6213891 Gare de Cherbourg (Cherbourg train station). Is about 5 minute's walk from the old town. It is also close to some hotels and a Carrefour but it is difficult to find food near the station.   (updated Dec 2023)
Cherbourg can be reached from Paris St Lazare on a direct train, otherwise, there are services to Brittany and to (sometimes) the southwest of France. Be careful: few trains, mainly delayed.

Get around[edit]

A decent enough network of buses runs round the town, but everything can be reached by foot
