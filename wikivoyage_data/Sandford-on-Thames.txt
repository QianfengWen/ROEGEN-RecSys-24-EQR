Sandford-on-Thames is a village in Oxfordshire, just south of Oxford. It combines the charming peace of a small old-English village with easy access to the nearby city centre, making it a pleasant base from where to explore both Oxford and the surrounding English landscapes.

St Andrew's Church is in the heart of the village

Understand[edit]
This village and Parish Council is just off the A4074, which bypasses the village, beside the River Thames in Oxfordshire. Grown from just 18 families in the Doomsday Book to just 200 people at the start of the 17th century to a population of 1,000 today.
The village was described as "a very good place to drown yourself in" in the book Three Men in a Boat by Jerome K. Jerome (based on a boat trip on the River Thames), probably referring to the "Big Lasher", a weir behind the lock keepers cottage that creates strong currents and eddies and is particularly dangerous having claimed quite a few lives. The site includes an obelisk commemorating 6 students who died here in 3 separate incidents.
