The city can be seen as made up of three parts: to the west of the rail line and around the old airfield a mainly industrial and commercial area; east of the rail station a modern shopping area; and the old town further east going up the hill.

By car[edit]
Böblingen is very well-connected to major highways and many think it is even too well-connected, as road noise is a big issue. There are four exits to the Autobahn 81, that runs in north and south direction. The Autobahn 8, which runs in east-west direction, is only a few kilometres away and is connected by Kreuz Stuttgart to Autobahn 81. Additionally, there is the Bundesstraße 464 which runs along the west side of the city. Three exits connect to Bundesstraße 464 and to some neighbouring cities.
The old city has only access roads and only residential parking. You should never drive into these parts unless you know exactly the spot where you want to go and how to get in and out again. Böblingen and Sindelfingen owe their wealth to the development of the car and the car industries. They are the two cities that treat cars like holy cows, but still do milk them a bit. Never touch a car, it is offensive and keep distance. There is only little free parking in the city centre, however in the industrial and commercial area of Böblingen-Hulb the shopping malls offer free parking.
