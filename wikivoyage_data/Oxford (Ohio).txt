Downtown Oxford
Oxford is a small town in Butler County in Southwest Ohio.  It is best known for being home to Miami University. Recognized as a Public Ivy, which describes state-funded public universities with academic programs akin to the Ivy League schools, Miami University has a body of more than 16,000 students in a town with a summer population just over 10,000.  The City of Oxford's predecessor, College Township, was founded one year after Miami University was established in 1809.  Miami was the second university in the United States west of the Appalachian Mountains (after Ohio University (1804) in Athens).


Get in[edit]
Oxford is 30 miles northwest of Cincinnati, 35 miles southwest of Dayton and about 5 miles east of the state boundary separating Ohio and Indiana.

By plane[edit]
Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG IATA) is on the Kentucky side of the Ohio River, so the distance is farther than that of Cincinnati, amounting to an approximately 50 mile drive to Oxford.
Dayton International Airport[dead link] (DAY IATA) is also a short distance from Oxford (approximately 45 miles).
39.5022-84.78441 Miami University Airport (OXD  IATA). is an airstrip available for the private pilot.   
By car[edit]
Oxford is probably one of the most difficult cities in Ohio to locate by car.
Oxford is most easily accessed:

Off of I-70 west of Dayton via the Eaton exit heading southbound on US-127 and then westbound on SR-73 or
Off of I-70 west of Dayton via the Eaton exit heading southbound on US-127 and then southbound on SR-732 or
Via I-275 (Cincinnati outer belt) using the Colerain exit and heading northbound on US-27
By bus[edit]
Barons Bus Lines provides transportation connecting Miami University with Indianapolis, Indiana and Cincinnati, Ohio. The fare is $10 one way and runs 365 days a year. Barons Bus Lines connect directly to Grey Hound buses that travel across the country, making travel to and from Oxford by bus relatively simple [1].

By foot[edit]
Oxford is a small town that can be easily traversed by foot.  From the eastern edge of the Miami University campus to the western edge of Uptown Oxford, one could walk the distance in less than 30 minutes.

By bus[edit]
BCRTA is the bus system in Oxford. Transportation can be provided around campus, to off-campus housing, and Uptown. There are also routes that travel to the regional branches of Miami University. Students, faculty, and staff may ride freely by displaying their University ID cards and all public passengers must pay $2 for fare. During fall, spring and winter terms the BCRTA buses run daily. Transit is greatly reduced during the summer months.

Drink[edit]
Oxford has typically provided at least 1 bar for every 1,000 students at Miami University. The nightlife is very active Thursday through Saturday night, when most of the bars remain open until 2AM. At most places, if there is live music, expect a cover charge. Because Oxford was once known for its St. Patrick's Day celebrations, Spring Break now always occurs the week of March 17th. However, St. Patty's proxy, Green Beer Day, occurs the Thursday before Spring Break.
