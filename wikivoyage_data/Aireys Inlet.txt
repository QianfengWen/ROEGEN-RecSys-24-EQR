Map of Aireys Inlet

Aireys Inlet is serviced by the V/Line bus between Geelong and Apollo Bay, which forms part of the larger Great Ocean Road service to Warrnambool. From Melbourne, take a Geelong line train and connect with the appropriate bus at the station. The service runs four times a day each direction on weekdays, and twice-daily on weekends. The town has two bus stops; the main one in front of the post office in the centre of town, and the others further to the west at the intersection with Bambra Rd, not far from the lighthouse. There is also a bus stop each in Fairhaven and Eastern View, right next to the arch.

The Split Point Lighthouse was built in 1891 and still shines her guiding light every night to keep ships passing on their way to and from Port Phillip Bay off the rocky shores. Inside, there is a cast iron spiral staircase, lantern room and balcony with a birds-eye view of the dramatic coastline. Australian tourists may recognise it as the lighthouse featured in the children's TV show "Round the Twist"   (updated Mar 2019)
