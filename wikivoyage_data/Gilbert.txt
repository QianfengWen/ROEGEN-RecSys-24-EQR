Gilbert Heritage District
Gilbert is in the southeast valley of the Greater Phoenix region of Arizona. With a population of 270,000 (2021 est.) it is the largest town in the US. people. Once a railway town and the "Hay Capital of the World", Gilbert is now a diverse suburban center, retaining its agricultural and railroad history and celebrating its "small town" feel.


Understand[edit]
Gilbert bills itself as is the largest incorporated town in the United States. It is the 5th most populated community in Arizona. From 1990 to 2003 it was also the fastest growing, outpacing even places like Las Vegas, largely due to its lower initial starting population.
Gilbert is in the southeast valley, south of Mesa, northeast of Chandler, and northwest of Queen Creek and Chandler Heights.

History[edit]
Gilbert owes its beginnings to William "Bobby" Gilbert who provided land to the Arizona Eastern Railway in 1902 to construct a rail line between Phoenix and Florence, Arizona. Ayer's Grocery Store, the first store in Gilbert, opened in 1910 and became the location of the first post office in 1912. The town post office moved several times before settling on the east side of Gilbert Road in downtown, where it still stands today.  In 1912, many Mormons who had fled the Mormon colonies in Mexico due to the actions of the forces of Pancho Villa settled in Gilbert. By 1915, they began holding church meetings at the Gilbert Elementary School. In 1918, they were organized into the Gilbert Ward.
Incorporated in July 1920, Gilbert was primarily a farming community fueled by the rail line and construction of the Roosevelt Dam and the Eastern and Consolidated Canals. It remained an agricultural town for many years and was known as the "Hay Capital of the World" from 1911 until the late 1920s.
Downtown Gilbert (along Gilbert Road between Elliot and Guadalupe Roads, centered on the railroad crossing) has numerous historical buildings, some dating from the 1910s, even before Arizona statehood. A few buildings are listed in the National Register of Historic Places, while others are listed as historical by the Gilbert Heritage District.
Gilbert has remained a town instead of becoming a city in part due to its early population size and how Arizona defined a city as needing more than 3,000 persons, which it surpassed only in the 1970s. Since then, it's due to Gilbert wanting to maintain a "small town" image, even with a population of over a quarter of a million.
