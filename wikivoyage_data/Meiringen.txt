Understand[edit]
Death of Sherlock Holmes
Meiringen is in the upper valley of the River Aare, the Haslital, at the point where several side valleys join. Each valley leads to a mountain pass so the village was at a confluence of routes and grew up as a market town and stop-off for travellers. In the 19th century it was a poor sort of place and many emigrated, but from 1880 Alpine tourism took off; the roads were improved and the railway arrived in 1888. One eminent tourist was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930) who at age 16 had spent a year at the Jesuit school in Feldkirch in Austria, where he took up skiing. Early skiers had to slog up the mountain just to make a single run back, but the railways meant you could ride up and ski down: Henry Lunn and his son Arnold founded Lunn Poly travel company with this in mind. In 1892 Doyle was already famous for his Sherlock Holmes stories when he visited Meiringen, but had had enough of the character and sought to kill off Sherlock to be free for other work. Lunn suggested "Push him over Reichenbach Falls" and this was done in 1892 in "The Final Problem". The arch-criminal Moriarty lures Holmes to the falls: Holmes knows it's a trap but wants to finish Moriarty. They struggle and plunge together.
But the public wouldn't have it, so by-and-by Holmes had to be resurrected. "The Hound of the Baskervilles" appeared in 1903 but set before his death, then in 1903 Holmes made a definitive return in "The Empty Room". His unconvincing escape was that he threw Moriarty in a ju-jitsu move then scrambled up the cliff to hide from accomplices, and lay low for years to make them think he was dead. There's long been a readership fascinated by these stories, and seeking to follow the steps of their hero. Meiringen is not a high altitude or snow-sure destination so it needs to boost tourism in other ways, and has played up the literary connection.

Get in[edit]
Trains from Interlaken Ost run every 30 min and take 30 min via Brienz. Alternate trains continue north from Meiringen to Brünig-Hasliberg, Lungern, Kaiserstuhl, Giswil, Sachseln, Sarnen and Lucerne (another 70 min).
46.72738.18431 Meiringen railway station is central in the village. It has left-luggage facilities and Swiss airline check-in. 
From Meiringen a train trundles 5 km up the Aare valley every 30 min to Meiringen Alpbach, Aareschlucht West, Innertkirchen Unterwasser and Innertkirchen Grimselstor (7 min). It was opened in 1926 to support construction of the hydroelectric power station, and remained owned by the power company until 2021 when it was hived off to Zentralbahn. The line is the same 1000 mm gauge as the Interlaken-Lucerne line but electrically incompatible, with no through-trains.  
There have long been plans to extend the railway from Innertkirchen by building the Grimsel Tunnel to Oberwald. The completion target of 2026 seems highly optimistic.
In summer a bus crosses the Susten pass from Andermatt twice daily, taking 2 hours. Bus 164 to Schwartzwaldalp in summer connects with Bus 128 from Grindelwald, climbing over Grosse Scheidegg pass from the Jungfrau region. 
By road from Interlaken take A8 south of the lake, or the slow road north of the lake via Brienz, then Route 6 into town. A8 turns north to Lucerne. Route 6 continues to Innertkirchen, where Route 11 forks for the Susten pass to Andermatt. Stay on Route 6 for the hairpin Grimsel pass towards Valais.

You can also walk up (say 20 min) any time free, but it's only worth coming when the falls are flowing - in winter they freeze.

Do[edit]
Aare Gorge
Hasliberg ski area is reached by the gondola as above. The top of the area is at 2433 m, the base station is at 1061 m and you can't always ski right down, so it's a limited area and not snow-sure. It's good for families teaching youngsters to ski or snowboard, but competent skiers will soon exhaust its delights. In 2022 / 23 an adult one-day ski pass is Fr. 62.
