Lillooet is the main town in the Fraser Canyon and Bridge River Country region of British Columbia. It was the first native town in the British Columbia Interior, and was briefly the largest town of the Fraser River Gold Rush in 1858-1860.  Described by colonial Governor James Douglas as "the prettiest spot for a town on the Fraser I have seen", local scenery was compared by early travellers to that of the Himalayas due to the extreme heights and sheer precipices around Lillooet and in surrounding canyon country.  In a pronounced desert-like rainshadow, the town's setting is framed by spectacular cliff walls and towering mountains.


Understand[edit]
Lillooet, view from the south
Lillooet is very hot in summer, often sunny when areas toward the Coast are rainy or areas farther east into the Interior are overcast.

Get in[edit]
Lillooet is on Highway 99 and is 225 km (140 miles) from Vancouver, 130 km (80 miles) from Whistler, and 270 km (168 miles) from Williams Lake.  If driving from Vancouver, the route via Whistler is more scenic though slightly slower, though for any of the many routes approaching Lillooet from other directions, you will not be disappointed.  Lillooet is the perfect weekend getaway or day trip from major centres.  With several hotels and motels, B&Bs, restaurants and a well-informed staff at the Visitors Center, Lillooet is well equipped to accommodate a romantic weekend getaway, a quick day trip out of the city and summer family adventures.

This short-haul rail-bus service is operated by the local First Nations band connecting Lillooet to Shalalth and Seton Portage at the far end of Seton Lake. It sometimes serves the community of D'Arcy at the far end of Anderson Lake if there is demand, but there is no scheduled service between D'Arcy and Lillooet, though the shuttle does run daily from Seton Portage to Lillooet and back. On Fridays only, one could do an excursion from Lillooet (departure 10:30AM) to Seton Park and return (noon and 2:30PM) within the same day. (However, the tourist office says only the noon departure is available for visitors.) The trip takes 1 hour each way. On other days of the week, travellers doing this trip will need overnight accommodations in Seton Portage or Shalalth, or a ride back over the mountain pass which accesses this area from Lillooet. Reservations, made by telephone, are strongly recommended; however, according to the tourist office, local residents may still get priority for seats over visitors, even those with a reservation.
