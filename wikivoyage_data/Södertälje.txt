Södertälje, (sometimes referred to by its historical name Tälje or Telge), is a city in the province of Södermanland and Stockholm County in Sweden. Many visit the city for attractions like the science centre Tom Tits and the open air museum Torekällberget. Södertälje is home to truck manufacturer Scania and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, meaning it also receives a lot of business travellers.
While 73,000 people live in the city (as of 2019), the municipality Södertälje kommun has around 100,000 inhabitants in total. This article also covers the nearby municipality of Nykvarn.

Around 1500 - 400 BC, the strait between Lake Mälaren and the Baltic Sea narrowed due to the post-glacial rebound. That boats henceforth had to be towed over the sand ridge created job opportunities. Trade and service emerged. The first time Södertälje is mentioned in historical sources was in 1070 when Adam of Bremen mentions the town in a description of the road between Skara and Birka in his work Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae pontificum. Södertälje received city privileges in the 1300s. The castle Telge Hus was built at Slottsholmen during the 1300s.

The city was called Tälje (several spellings are known; including Telge, Talje, Tælga) until 1622, when the prefix “Söder” (English: South) was added to distinguish from the then recently founded town of Norrtälje, which is 110 km northeast of the city. Statistics Sweden started using the modern spelling in 1900. You will find many establishments in town still use one of the older spellings or the shortened name Telge. 
The city first used St. Olof in its coat of arms. In the beginning of the 17th century he was replaced by Ragnhild of Tälje (Swedish: Sankta Ragnhild). After her pilgrimages to Rome and Jerusalem, her relics are said to have been buried in Södertälje. She is depicted on many buildings, and her name is often used on businesses and places.
In the 1800s, Södertälje became a seaside resort. In 1849 the Södertälje Bathing Facilities in Badparken park was opened, with both a cold bath facility and a hot bath house. The bathhouses and the Societetshus venue have been demolished, but the Bath hotel at Järnagatan street, Strandhotellet hotel, Stadsparken park, Villa Bellevue and several other buildings still remain from the resort era, which lasted for almost a hundred years until 1945.
The tradition of selling the local pretzels Södertäljekringlor is several hundred years old, but has its heyday during the resort era. They were typically sold by older women, often referred to as Kringelgummumor (English: Pretzel ladies). Sale of pretzels was predominantly done to tourists, and especially at the city’s railway stations. The sale of pretzels, among other aspects of the resort town, was described in the magazine Svenska Familj-Journalen (English: Swedish Family Journal) in 1881. The pretzels are hard to come by today, very few bakeries in Södertälje sell them today.

Around the turn of the century several large factories were established in the city, most notably Astra (1913) and VABIS, Vagnfabriks-Aktiebolaget in Södertelge (1891), today called Scania AB.
The 1960s saw a major upgrade of the city centre. Many of the historic buildings were moved to Torekällberget, which is one of the most popular places to visit in the city today.
During the 1960s, the large corporations in the city were in high demand of labour and many foreign workers from Finland, but also Greece, Italy and Yugoslavia settled. During the 1970s, immigration from Finland declined, while many Assyrians (or Syriacs) settled in Södertälje. At the end of the 1990s, many Iraqis arrived, and now constitute the largest immigrant group. The diverse immigration means you can find all sorts of food at the city’s restaurants.
Many of the city’s modern attractions were built in the 1980s. A museum based on the book La Science Amusante by French writer Arthur Good was built. The museum is called Tom Tits Experiment after the author’s pen name Tom Tit. The new bath house Sydpoolen opened in 1987, and is now one of the most visited bathing facilities in the country.

Arriving by boat can be a scenic way of getting to Södertälje. The Södertälje Canal (Swedish: Södertälje kanal) is a canal connecting the lake Mälaren with the Baltic Sea, and goes right through Södertälje. It is 5.2 km long, and it has one lock. The size of this lock is the largest in Scandinavia by allowed ship size. The water level difference between Mälaren and the Baltic Sea is not large, on average 0.6 m (2 ft). This is the main shipping route into the lake Mälaren.

Get around[edit]

There are plenty of ways to make your way around Södertälje.

By city buses[edit]
The SL Access prepaid cards are accepted on SL transportation in Södertälje, but not all Sörmlandstrafiken buses
Due to Södertälje's location close to a county border, both SL and Sörmlandstrafiken operate buses in the city. The city bus network consists of around fifteen bus lines. They use Södertälje C (the Central Railway Station) as hub. Before Järnagatan street became pedestrian buses generally used that route through the city centre. Most now take Nygatan street. Köpmangatan is also a useful bus hub in the city centre.
In addition to regular city buses, there are special services adapted to pensioners and people with disabilities known as Närtrafiken buses. Night services operate all night both weekends and weekdays. The city is served by two circular night bus routes, one on each side of the canal.

Tickets[edit]
If you don’t plan to travel extensively, one way tickets can be purchased on SL buses using a contactless Mastercard, Visa or American Express card. Note that only contactless payment is accepted (there is no option to swipe a magnetic strip). Cash payment is not accepted. Mobile phone tickets are also available (using the SL app), as well as paper tickets from vending machines and certain convenience stores. A single ticket allows free transfers within 75 minutes.
All SL services also use an integrated ticket system with an RFID card called SL Access which triggers electronic readers. A card can be bought at the ticket booth at Södertälje C station, or Pressbyrån at Stortorget square. Some smaller convenience stores sell them too.
Multi-ride passes are available for 24 hours, 72 hours and 30 days, and allow unrestricted rides on all buses, and trains county-wide.
SL Tickets are sometimes accepted on Sörmlandstrafiken as well; see link[dead link].

By taxi[edit]
Don’t step into a taxi without checking the yellow price sign on the rear window first! In Sweden, taxi drivers are legally allowed to charge rip-off prices as long as they are stated clearly on the sign. The taxi to the left is twice as expensive as the one to the right. The price tag should say just above 300 kr for a cab in Södertälje
Taxis are rather expensive. Even worse is the fact that some small dodgy operators charge high prices. The antidote is to always check the black and yellow price sticker on the rear window. The price shown in large digits is the maximum (for instance during night hours) fare for a 10 km, 15 minute journey and reputable companies charge around 300 kr for this. The price can legally be up to 499 kr; if the sticker shows a much higher price, stay away or be ripped off. The taxi market is deregulated, making it considerably easier to find a taxi, but the downside is that the rip-offs aren't even illegal, just "supply and demand"!
Ask for fixed prices if you go to or from airports.

TaxiKurir Södertälje; {{phone|+46 8 550 333 33. A large national company, with local fleet of taxis in Södertälje.
By foot[edit]
Most sights are within walking distance. Due to its topography, walking North/South is often fairly flat. Walking Badparken-Marenplan-Stortorget-Tom Tits Experiment is a nice long level stretch of streets as they all go along the canal. The sides of the canal are mountainous, meaning walking to Torekällberget from the central parts is steep uphill. Keep this in mind when planning your walk.

Buildings from the Seaside Resort Era[edit]
Badhotellet Old Bath Hotel
During the period from the 1800s to 1945, Södertälje was a popular seaside resort town. Many old bath villas and summer houses still exist. The grandest building that still stands is the old Bath Hotel Badhotellet. It was built 1899, drawn by architect Edward Ohlsson.
One of the most noticeable private villas is Villa Bellevue. It was built in 1871 by the royal pastry chef Davidsson, after drawings by architect Ernst Jacobsson. Villa Bellevue is located on the border between the city centre and the centrally located neighbourhood of Mariekälla, which is named after one of the city's water springs. On Parkgatan, which is a parallel street to the district's main street Mariekällgatan, lies Villa Walhall. The villa was built in 1875 by engineer Ludvig Jerving. Villa Walhall and Villa Bellevue were considered so typical of the resort town Södertälje that they were described and depicted in a series of articles in the magazine Svenska Familj-Journalen in 1881.

S/S Ejdern at port in Södertälje
S/S Ejdern; Falkvägen 13, 152 70. Tel: +46 8 550 110 20Take a day cruise on the canal with the world's oldest propeller-driven steamship which still has its original engine; S/S Ejdern. It was originally built by Götaverken in Gothenburg in 1880. During its first years, Ejdern operated in the Gothenburg archipelago, Lake Roxen, and several ports in central Sweden. Since 1906, it has had its home port in Södertälje. The first route from the port in Södertälje was to Mörkö , and cargo hauls in eastern Lake Mälaren . Between 1914 and 1957, the boat had one single owner; Rickard Fredmark. He sold the boat to the City of Södertälje. At that time, the ship was unprofitable and in very poor condition. The city subsequently decided that the boat was to be scrapped. In 1964 the boat was donated to an association for the preservation of old boats. Enthusiasts of this particular vessel broke out and formed Museiföreningen Ångfartyget Ejdern (English: The Museum Association S/S Ejdern), who still own the boat today. Since 1976 they operate museum routs around Södertälje. From 1984, the boat is once again coal powered. S/S Ejdern has a capacity of 90 people, and often operates the route to Adelsö and Viking city Birka.

Stay healthy[edit]
Södertälje sjukhus is the city’s full service hospital, including 24 hour trauma centre
Södertälje is home to one of the county’s six emergency hospitals, meaning round-the–clock emergency services are available.

Södertälje Sjukhus (emergency hospital); Rosenborgsgatan 6-10, 152 40. Tel: In emergencies, call the national number 112Full service hospital, including trauma centre, surgery, birthing centre with midwives, and general physicians
EU/EEA citizens with a European Health Insurance card pay the same (rather low) fee for emergency and necessary care as a local citizen. Others must pay the whole health care cost (which can be between 1,700 and 2,200 kr for a doctor’s visit at an emergency care unit at a hospital). More information on hospital fees can be found at 1177 Vårdguiden.
In an emergency, always call 112 to the national rescue services SOS Alarm who can dispatch ambulance, police, fire service, air and sea rescue, mountain patrol, or priest on call. English-speaking operators are available.
For less serious illnesses and ailments, getting in touch with a local clinic, vårdcentral, is a much better option than the hospital emergency rooms. The Stockholm County healthcare hotline (+46 8 320 100) can give medical advice and help you find a doctor. While information is officially given in Swedish only, the doctors can often speak some English. Several vårdcentral surgeries are available in central Södertälje, and spread throughout the city as well.

Pharmacies[edit]
Lake Maren in the city centre is great for a walk. There are also many restaurants and cafés around it
Certified pharmacies (apotek) have a green cross sign. You can buy over-the-counter medicine in most supermarkets and convenience stores. Prescription medications, including strong painkillers, are only sold at pharmacies, though.
