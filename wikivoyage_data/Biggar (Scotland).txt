This article covers the town of Biggar,  Scotland. For the town in Canada, see 
Biggar (Saskatchewan).
Biggar is a market town historically in Lanarkshire and now within Clydesdale. It's nowadays a commuter town for both Edinburgh and Glasgow, and in 2020 had a population of 2640. Its attractions are a rare combination: a gasworks museum and a puppet theatre.


Get in[edit]
Stagecoach West Scotland Bus 101 / 101A runs from Edinburgh via Penicuik and West Linton to Biggar, 80 min, hourly M-Sa but only four times on Sunday. Three or four buses a day continue from Biggar to Lamington, Abington, Moffat, Beattock and Dumfries, 1 hour 50 min.
Stuart's Coach 91 / 191 runs hourly from Lanark via Thankerton and Symington to Biggar, 30 min.
Borders Bus 91 runs six times a day from Peebles, taking 40 min via Stobo, Broughton and Skirling.
There isn't a bus station, the main stop is midway along the broad High Street, corner of John Street. 
By road from Edinburgh follow A702 along the flank of the Pentlands. From the south follow M74 over Beattock to Jcn 13 Abingdon services then take A702.
From Glasgow there's a choice of routes. The usual recommendation is M74, and stay on it to Abingdon then double-back north on A702. Outside rush hour, you can save miles and fuel but probably no time by cutting off at Jcn 8 via Carluke and Lanark. You can also leave Glasgow on M8 to Jcn 6 then follow A73 towards Carluke.

See[edit]
55.6232-3.52791 Gasworks Museum, Gas Works Road ML12 6BZ, ☏ +44 1899 221070. Closed. Until the 1970s, Britain used "town gas" — mostly coal gas produced by roasting coal without air, mixed with water gas from spraying steam on the coals. The blend was optimised for heating and cooking, rather than for gas lighting or coke production as earlier processes had been. It was rich in carbon monoxide and often the get-out option of the sad or desperate. Every town of any size had a gasworks and a hulking gasometer - a collapsible tank that rose or sank with storage requirements. Then North Sea gas became widely available, the nation's appliances were converted to use it, and all the gasworks became redundant. Most were demolished and the sites redeveloped, but the Biggar site and equipment were preserved. (updated May 2022)

55.617-3.5253 Boghall Castle is a contender for the title of "Borders worst-ruined castle" though it faces stiff competition. It was built in the 14th century over an earlier motte-and-bailey, but only the foundation stumps of two towers remain.
55.6104-3.55934 Coulter Motte is probably early medieval, a hillock at a crossing of the River Clyde. It would have been fortified with wooden palisades but never converted to a stone castle such as Boghall.

55.5462-3.50344 Coulter Fell is 748 m (2454 ft) but part of a ridge of the Southern Uplands, hence less prominent than the isolated Tinto. Approach via the lane from Coulter village, and expect boggy going.
Biggar Show is in July at the showground north edge of town: Highland Dancing, tractors, horse-jumping, prize sheep, bagpipes, what's not to like? The next is probably on 20 July 2024, tba.
Biggar Rally celebrates the cars, buses and trucks produced by Albion Motors. This was founded in 1899 by Thomas Blackwood Murray (who hocked the family estate in Biggar to fund it) and Norman Osborne Fulton, with works in Glasgow. A series of ramshackle buggys was followed by a wide portfolio of commercial vehicles, so the Albion sunrise logo became familiar to anyone waiting at a bus stop. In 1951 they were taken over by Leyland Motors (later British Leyland), but still marketed under the Albion brand until 1972. The next rally is probably 11 Aug 2024 but tba.
Biggar Little Festival is held over ten days in autumn, with a food and crafts fair on the opening Sunday. The next is probably 17-27 Oct 2024, tba.
