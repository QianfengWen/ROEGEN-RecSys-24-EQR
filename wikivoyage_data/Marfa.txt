Marfa at dusk
Marfa is a town of 1,600 people (2019) in the Big Bend Country region of Texas. It's known for two things: innovative art and mysterious lights.


Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
   Marfa sits at the intersection of  US Hwy 67 and 90 and Texas Hwy 17:

 to  Highland St/S Highland Ave US Hwy 67 goes 60 mi (97 km) south to Presidio and 26 mi (42 km) east to Alpine concurrent along US Hwy 90. It then continues another 67 mi (108 km) northeast from Alpine to Ft Stockton on the I-10 corridor (via Exit 248). Going north of town, Highland Ave becomes State Highway (SH) 17 which goes up another 60 mi (97 km) to I-10 in Saragosa (Exit 209).
 San Antonio St Coming from the east, US Hwy 90 makes for an interesting, scenic drive to Marfa. Plan your fuel stops wisely, as it's possible to go almost 200 miles between cities. US Hwy 90 takes in a couple of all-but-ghost towns along the way, as well as the Trans-Pecos crossing and some breathtaking scenery.
 Travelers in more of a hurry may prefer to take Interstate 10 to US Hwy 67 (Exit 248) from Fort Stockton (or from further east) or US Hwy 90 (Exit 140A) from Van Horn, if coming from the west, straight into Marfa. Likewise one can also exit off at TX-17 from Exit 209 of I-10 from either direction.
By bus[edit]

By plane[edit]
For those flying, the nearest airport is in El Paso, which is roughly 190 mi (310 km) west. Midland International Air and Space Port in Midland, Texas is roughly the same distance. Marfa is roughly six to seven hours from Dallas, Austin and San Antonio. Most travelers typically rent a car at the airport and come by car.

Get around[edit]
Visitors will need their own transportation to reach most of the sights in Marfa, although many of the art galleries and restaurants are within walking distance of each other on the main drag in town, between the Presidio County Courthouse and the Marfa post office.

Do[edit]
Visitors should consider planning their trip when the town is most active - between Wednesday and Saturday, when many local shops, restaurants and attractions are open.
For many visitors, the mysterious Marfa Lights are the main attraction. There is a viewing platform several miles east of the city on Route 67. After dark, the famed lights may appear... or they may not. Theories have been put forward as to their origin, but none have been conclusive; there is no way to predict whether they will appear on any given night. Visitors determined to catch a glimpse of the eerie, dancing orbs may have to set aside a couple of nights and wish for luck.

Stay safe[edit]
The crime rate in Marfa is incredibly low compared to other nearby cities and towns. However, visitors are advised to check into their motels before 10PM as the street lights in Marfa turn off at this time, or carry a flashlight or firearm. Once it gets dark, coyotes and pumas come down out of the Davis mountains looking for prey.
Law enforcement is provided by the Presidio County Sheriff's Department and the Texas Highway Patrol, after the disbanding of the Marfa Police Department in 2010.

Connect[edit]
Verizon AT&T and T-Mobile all have cell phone coverage in the whole town. Sprints coverage only covers the western part. The town is covered by a few broadband internet providers. .
