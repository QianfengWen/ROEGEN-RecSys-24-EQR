An ocean beach near Esperance.
Esperance is a town in the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia. It's a popular travel destination for locals, noted for magnificent coastline, spectacular beaches, outdoor activities and fine fishing.


Understand[edit]
Esperance was first named by the French who sheltered in the bay here in 1792.

History[edit]
Pirates roamed the nearby islands during the 19th century, harkening back to a period when the west was indeed wild.
Parts of the NASA Skylab space station fell close to town when it dropped from orbit in 1979.
Esperance has the necessities for a prosperous town - a deep-sea port, airport and railway junction. Esperance is awakening as more people discover the natural wonders of the town.
The weather is very changeable.

Get around[edit]
See[edit]
-33.858023121.8948521 Historic Museum Village, 54 Dempster St. Old buildings of various vintages which were formerly Police Sergeants quarters, a school house, a doctors surgery, a courthouse and a hospital and have been relocated and repurposed as cafes, Art galleries and retail shops. Oldest of the bunch is the tiny wood and iron Methodist Church built in 1895. 
-33.859544121.8938852 Esperance Museum, Cnr James St and Dempster St, ☏ +61 8 9083 1580, museum@esperance.wa.gov.au. Daily 1:30–4:30PM. A rambling array of objects stacked almost up to the hefty timber rafters of the old goods warehouse that houses the collection. Nautical flotsam, domestic ephemera and antiquated machinery are intermingled with all kinds of social curios drawn from a lengthy timeline of Esperance history. The 99-tonne steam engine dominates, but debris from the 1979 crash of Skylab is the arguable highlight. There is a lot to see, so the short opening hours demand a second visit to fully explore every corner. Adults $8.50, children $3.50. 
-33.844426121.8469353 Pink Lake, Pink Lake Rd. Not particularly pink nor lake-like, it's a large salt pan that is either white and crunchy or grey and muddy depending on how much it has rained recently. The northern side has built up dam structures used to harvest the salt that may exhibit a pinkish tinge caused by the concentration of algae.   
 Wind power turbines (19 km west of town). Massive propellers slowly spinning in the breeze look attractive from afar but are quite intimidating up close as the blades slice through the air with a low growl. 
-33.908594121.7947744 Observatory Point, Twilight Beach Road. On the wonderful coast road that heads west from town to the beaches is this lookout offering excellent views over the coast and the archipelago, particularly Observatory Island, where the French ships sheltered in 1792. (updated Dec 2017)
-33.865802121.8944245 Esplanade. Beachside parks wind along Esperance's esplanade with views to the port, the old tanker jetty and the islands. There is a children's adventure park and a cafe towards the southern end and sculptures at various points, notably the whale tail near the museum. (updated Dec 2017)
