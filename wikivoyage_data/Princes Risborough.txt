Princes Risborough is a small town in Buckinghamshire.


Understand[edit]
Risborough Markethouse
Princes Risborough
It's on the A4010 about halfway between High Wycombe and Aylesbury.  The population is around 10,000.  Why "Princes"? Because Edward the Black Prince apparently had a palace near St Mary's Church. (The site is now, in the finest British tradition, a car park.)  Before then, it was "Great Risborough" on the same pattern as Great Missenden, and there was a Little Risborough, which changed its name to Monks Risborough as it had a monastery (no longer extant).
Getting information about Princes Risborough ("Risborough" for short) is very easy.  No emigrants to other parts of the world seem to have called anywhere else by the same name, so a Google search for "Princes Risborough" (with the quotes) will get useful results.  Unless you want to look a chump, don't say or write "Princess Risborough".

For the town, you can just use your feet.  For the local countryside, you need a car or bike unless the bus routes or railway lines suit.

See[edit]
High Street
Church Street
The High Street and Duke Street - some old buildings and good local shops among the vast number of estate agents. Note the Trumpton-style market square.
Manor Park Avenue and Church Lane are worth walking along for some nice private houses, and one cottage in Church Lane has a plaque commemorating Amy Johnson the aviator.
51.7244-0.83461 St Mary's Church, Church Ln, Princes Risborough HP27 9AW. The spire is visible from almost anywhere in town and parts of the church are quite old, though there are no particular features that would get it into a list of churches to visit. Outside the church by the Mount car park is a sign about the Black Prince's Palace. (updated Jun 2017)
51.728689-0.8115612 Whiteleaf Cross. A large chalk engraving in the side of a hill can be seen from nearly anywhere in the town. A steep uphill walk (or drive) to the top will give you views of the entire town and beyond as far as Didcot to the west and Aylesbury and Milton Keynes to the north.   
Red kites: the population started from a breeding programme to the west has reached Risborough, and you can quite often count six or more kites soaring above the town.
51.7499-0.79553 Cymbeline's Castle (½ km SW of Ellesborough church). A motte and bailey castle.   (updated Jun 2017)
51.72-0.82254 Kop Hill Climb (Annual Motorsport Hill Climb Event). ½ mile hill climb event with a gradient of 1 in 4 at its steepest. Event originally started in 1910 but ended in 1925 following a minor accident involving a spectator. The RAC then banned all motorsport on public roads. In 1999 the event was revived as a non-competitive charity event.   (updated Jun 2017)
Do[edit]
Get into local countryside for walks - the Ridgeway National Trail and Icknield way pass close by.
Nightlife: for anything other than pubs and eateries, you need to go to High Wycombe or Aylesbury.

Buy[edit]
Food: Clark's is an excellent butcher. Tesco and Marks and Spencers Simply Food supermarkets are just what you'd expect, though anyone used to modern Tesco stores should be aware that this one is tiny. There's a deli in the High Street as well as the usual shops you would expect in a small town. Thursday sees a street market with some stalls selling some more exotic items. There are about four charity shops with the usual range of stuff - reasonable quality as Risborough has plenty of wealthy people.
