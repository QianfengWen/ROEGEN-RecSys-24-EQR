Farnborough is a town in the northeastern corner of the English county of Hampshire, adjacent to the borders with Surrey and Berkshire. Once an isolated hamlet, Farnborough grew into a medium-sized town over the course of the 20th century. This growth was built on the back of the aviation industry; Farnborough was the site of the first powered flight in Britain, made by Samuel Cody in 1904. Today, the aerospace, defence and technology industries thrive and aviation heritage is evident all around the town. Farnborough is best known as the home of the biennial Farnborough International Airshow, which has been running since 1948.
The town is also the final resting place of deposed French Emperor Napoléon III and his wife Eugénie de Montijo.


Understand[edit]
Orientation[edit]
The northeasternmost town in Hampshire, Farnborough is contiguous with Aldershot (with which it shares a local authority, the Borough of Rushmoor) to the south, and Camberley (in Surrey) to the north. The town's eastern boundary is marked by the River Blackwater, on the other side of which are the suburban villages Ash, Frimley and Mytchett, which are nowadays considered part of Camberley. Farnborough Airport is immediately to the south-west of the town centre, and west of that is beautiful mixed forest and heathland leading to Fleet.
Although locals divide Farnborough north and south, and into other named areas not relevant here, the visitor may understand it better as a town of four quadrants:

The north-west covers the mostly residential areas known as Cove and Southwood, which were formerly independent villages. Although there are some older buildings, the bulk of this part's urbanisation took place in the mid- to late 20th century, and there is little here of interest to a visitor.
The north-east is separated from the NW by Farnborough Road. This is the oldest part of town and contains the former village centre (Farnborough Street), the parish church of St Peter, St Michael's Abbey and Farnborough Hill House (Farnborough Park).
The south-east was Farnborough's 19th-century town centre, and is still today predominantly Victorian in character, known as South Farnborough or North Camp. It is mixed residential and commercial, and has many of the best restaurants and pubs.
The south-west is dominated by Farnborough Airport, and the high-tech industry, business parks and hotels which surround it. This is also the location of the RAE Heritage Quarter and FAST Museum.
The modern town centre sits where these four quadrants meet.

Early history[edit]
While Farnborough has been settled for at least 1000 years (it was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Ferneberga, Old English for "Fern Hill"), it was for most of its history a tiny hamlet in the midst of a lawless and remote heathland, on the outer edges of Windsor Forest, a royal hunting estate. Its location at the borders of Hampshire, Surrey and Berkshire meant it was frequently used by outlaws as diverse as highwaymen and illegal boxers; before the 20th century, county police forces had no powers beyond their areas of jurisdiction, so all criminals had to do to escape justice was pass from one county to the next. The area's comparative remoteness and frontier town vibes kept Farnborough small for centuries; there are therefore few buildings today that date from before the 19th century, and those that do are rustic-looking timber-framed cottages.
The arrival of the British Army to neighbouring Aldershot in the mid-1800s brought more settlers to the area, and many officers built fine villas in what is now Farnborough's southern suburb of North Camp - so called because it is north of the Army garrison ("camp"). Shops, services and a town hall sprang up to serve the growing community, and North Camp remained Farnborough's commercial centre for another hundred years.

The French Connection[edit]
The town welcomed foreign royalty in 1880, when the Empress Eugénie de Montijo moved into Farnborough Hill, a manor house and estate. Eugénie was the Spanish-born widow of Emperor Napoléon III of France. Following the Franco-Prussian War and revolution of 1870, the deposed imperial family fled to England, where they settled in Kent. The Emperor died in 1873, but was survived by his wife and the couple's only child, Louis Napoléon Eugène. The prince imperial was the last hope for a Bonapartist restoration, until he was killed by Zulu warriors while serving with the British Army in southern Africa in 1879. The following year, the grieving Empress moved into and greatly expanded Farnborough Hill, transforming it into a château where she received regular visits from her close friend, Queen Victoria. On the estate, she ordered the construction of a neo-Gothic Roman Catholic monastery, to which were invited monks of the Benedictine order from France, who were to watch over the imperial mausoleum. Named for St Michael, the monastery was made an abbey by the Pope in 1903. Remaining in Farnborough until her death in 1920, Eugénie is buried in the family crypt of the abbey alongside her husband and son.

Aviation pioneers[edit]
Statue of Samuel Cody, Farnborough Road
Farnborough got its economic breakthrough when the Army set up a balloon factory on what was then a grassy plain on the western edge of town. In 1904, the Iowa-born wild west showman Samuel Franklin Cody designed and flew his 'Army Aeroplane Number One' in what was Britain's first powered flight. Within a few years the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), as the Army balloon factory was now known, had made Farnborough its headquarters, and the grassy plain was transformed into an airfield. Cody continued to develop prototype aircraft, and became increasingly ambitious, entering competitions such as the 'Circuit of Britain' and the 'Michelin Cup'. In 1913, his luck finally ran out when his latest prototype broke up mid-flight; Cody and his unfortunate passenger were thrown to their deaths. His funeral procession was attended by 100,000 people and he is buried in Aldershot Military Cemetery.
Ever since Cody's era, the town has been synonymous with the aviation industry. Captured enemy aircraft were 'reverse engineered' in Farnborough during the Second World War, helping to give the RAF the edge over the Luftwaffe. This caused tragedy when a test pilot lost control of a Dornier Do-335 over the town and crashed into a local primary school, scattering burning debris and fuel over the schoolyard. The pilot was killed instantly, but by extremely good fortune, there were only a few minor injuries sustained by the children and their teachers. Post-war, the innovation continued. Jet engines were pioneered here in the mid-1940s, while supersonic passenger flight was successfully engineered with Concorde in the 1960s, continuing Farnborough's French connection. The RAE and airport were privatised in the 1990s, but several large aerospace and defence corporations continue to have their headquarters in the town, while the airport is now Britain's busiest for business aviation.

Airshow[edit]
The first Farnborough International Airshow was held in 1948, and it has taken place every two years continuously in even-numbered years, with the exception of 2020. It is one of the largest airshows in the world, and is held over one week in the summer. FIA is primarily a civil and military trade show, facilitating trade and investment in aircraft and new technologies. It attracts a lot of press attention, usually sees the visit of high profile politicians and/or royalty, and also draws anti-arms trade and climate change protesters. The airshow ground is open to the public at the end of the week, on Saturday and Sunday. However, air displays take place every afternoon of the show, and these can easily be seen from most parts of the town.

Farnborough today[edit]
Farnborough's centre of gravity shifted away from North Camp in the 1960s, when a civic and shopping area was constructed closer to the town's geographical midpoint. The town's population of 57,000 (2019) largely stems from the post-war era, when slum clearance brought thousands of inner-city Londoners to new housing estates. Today's town centre dates from that period of questionable architectural tastes and car-centric planning. Farnborough is now firmly in the capital's commuter belt.
Since the 2000s, thousands of Nepalese people have made their home in Farnborough, Aldershot and the surrounding area, after a long campaign to give former British Gurkhas and their families the right to live in the UK. The presence of Nepali people, language, traditional dress and businesses is very noticeable.

Farnborough is 35 miles (56 km) south-west of central London.

By car[edit]
Farnborough is served by the M3 motorway (junctions 4 and 4a) which runs from London to Southampton. The town is about an hour's drive from central London, and 15 minutes from junction 12 of the M25. The A331 Blackwater Valley Road is a fast dual carriageway running from junction 4 along the eastern edge of Farnborough and Aldershot to the A31 Hog's Back Road (which links the A3 at Guildford with Winchester).
All listed 'see' and 'do' attractions, and most of the sleep listings, have on-site or nearby parking, and visitors to the town in general won't have trouble finding a car park. The Meads multi-storey car park on Kingsmead is particularly helpful, as are the Pinehurst car parks slightly further down the same road. Less useful is the "secret car park" on the roof of Sainsbury's; since it was painted up, it has only been accessible to pedestrians, as a ramp up from the road was never built! Its 'discovery' by a reporter in 2016 prompted much derision in the national media.

Farnborough is a small town and it is very easy and quick to get around on foot or by car. The town centre has lots of signs, maps and information boards for pedestrians. Parking is widely available, though you will be hard-pressed to find anything free.

By bike[edit]
Farnborough has a good network of cycle routes, the majority being either off-road or along lanes segregated from motor traffic. Some of these are shared with pedestrians, and some are reserved for bikes. There are a few unsegregated cycle lanes, but these are mostly on minor roads. Signage is comprehensive with accurate distances, though some of the signs have been vandalised and now point the wrong way, so it would be best to have a map to hand, so check out CycleStreets.

See[edit]
In general terms, Farnborough is not a tourist town, but there are a few sights worth seeing, especially for those interested in history.

Aviation[edit]
Flight helmets through the ages at the FAST Museum
51.2823-0.7531 Farnborough Air Sciences Trust Museum (FAST), Trenchard House, 85 Farnborough Road, GU14 6TF, ☏ +44 1252 375050, secretary@airsciences.org.uk. Sa Su bank holiday M 10AM-4PM. Local gem dedicated to retelling Farnborough's extensive aviation history, from early balloons and canvas aircraft, through the world wars, the first jet engines, wind tunnel trials, supersonic flight and space exploration. Static aircraft on display include a Hawker Hunter, Harrier T4, Lightning, Puma and Gazelle, which you can sit inside. Or you can try your hand at flying in one of the cockpit simulators. The Cody pavilion houses a scale replica of the pioneer's first plane and an exhibition on his exciting life. However, the museum's greatest assets are its volunteers, who are genuine experts on the exhibits and are always keen (occasionally a little too keen!) to impart their knowledge. Free; donations welcome. Small shop and café on-site.   (updated Oct 2021)
After touring the museum, you can visit the following sites on foot:

51.28282-0.752942 Samuel Franklin Cody memorial (in front of the FAST Museum, on the public highway). A statue of Cody's likeness, unveiled in 2013 on the centenary of the aviator's death in a crash of one of his experimental aircraft.   (updated Oct 2021)
51.27841-0.754723 "First Flight in the UK" memorial, Farnborough Road (450 m south of FAST Museum). The now rather mundane site of Samuel Cody's first flight is marked by a stone and plaque. You can still look across the airfield from here and admire Cody's legacy. (updated Oct 2021)
Many of the Royal Aircraft Establishment's buildings and structures are listed, and have been sympathetically integrated into a modern mixed-used business and residential neighbourhood beside the airport called the RAE Heritage Quarter. This area is accessed by walking 300 m north from the museum along Farnborough Rd. At the car dealership, turn left onto an unsigned road which is confirmed as O'Gorman Ave after 100 m. First along here, on both sides of the road, are three buildings that house the 51.2852-0.75574 wind tunnels. There are a couple of information panels to read, but otherwise there's not much to see, other than the NOT EXISTING LISTING IMAGE clock tower on wind tunnel building Q121, Hall Rd. The FAST Museum runs guided tours of the tunnels from March to October; see below.

The airship hangar at night
Walk clockwise around Q121 to its rear, and descend a set of steps; you'll then come to the 51.28502-0.758475 National Aerospace Library. This handsome art-deco building recalls some of the glamour of early air travel, and its important archives are open to the public on Wednesdays and Thursdays by appointment. Also inside is the Aviator's Café (M-F 8AM-3PM), serving coffees, cakes and sandwiches. 
From outside the library, a passage between two red office buildings will get you to the quarter's central piazza, popular with lunching office workers and scootering children, and dominated by the cathedral-like metal 51.28485-0.761156 airship hangar frame. Built in 1911, this vast skeleton is a ghostly reminder of how different aviation could have been were it not for a series of catastrophic accidents in the 1930s which killed off the nascent airship industry.
Other sites around town which may be of interest:

51.291956-0.7579497 Scout Experimental SE5A fighter plane, Princes Mead, GU14 6YA ("Flying" above the food court in Princes Mead shopping centre), ☏ +44 1252 375520. M-Sa 9AM-5:30PM, Su 10AM-4PM. A replica of the first ever aircraft built by the RAE's factory at Farnborough. This model represents that which was flown by World War I ace pilot Edward "Mick" Hancock, who was awarded the Victoria Cross medal posthumously. You can read about his life on a small poster in the centre. Free. (updated Nov 2021)
51.285-0.77918 Sir Frank Whittle memorial (on A327 Ively Road roundabout, outside the main entrance to the airport). A sculpture of Whittle's Gloster Meteor, a pioneering jet aircraft created at the RAE. See the original plane in London's Science Museum.   (updated Nov 2021)
51.268163-0.7926149 Watch the planes coming and going (the best spot is by the iron bridge on Laffans Road, just off the A323). For aviation enthusiasts, there is always something interesting going on around the airport. A loyal band of spotters can usually be found there on most days, often with their car radios tuned into air traffic control, and always open to sharing their passion with like-minded visitors from near and far.

Imperial and religious history[edit]
The dome of St Michael's Abbey


“

A little corner of England which is forever France, irreclaimably French

”


—Monsignor Ronald Knox, on St Michael's Abbey, Farnborough

51.2968-0.749910 St Michael's Abbey (Abbaye Saint-Michel - Chapelle impériale), 280 Farnborough Road, GU14 7NQ (when travelling S on F'boro Rd, turn L at Abbey House, immediately after the Ham and Blackbird roundabout (close to Farnborough (Main) Railway Station); you must wait at the entrance until 2:50PM, when the gates will swing open automatically; when travelling north, go right aroud the roundabout), ☏ +44 1252 546105, info@farnboroughabbey.org. Public guided tours: Sa 3PM, private tours by appointment; mass M-Sa 8AM, Su 9AM, vespers 4:45PM; shop  closed during the pandemic, but open online. Built by Empress Eugénie de Montijo in the 1880s, the abbey's main attraction is its typically French Flamboyant Neo-Gothic chapel, beneath which lie Napoleon III, his wife and their son, Louis Napoléon Eugène. The abbey is home to a small community of Benedictine (Roman Catholic) monks, and also houses a relic of St Alban. The guided tour involves a visit to the chapel, grounds and imperial crypt. The mass and vespers, sung in Latin Gregorian chant, are an unusual experience. The tiny shop stocks handmade religious memorabilia, local history books printed by the abbey press, and produce from the monks' farm. Tours £5 pp minimum donation; children free.   (updated Nov 2021)
51.29248-0.75022211 St Peter's Church, 60 Church Ave, GU14 7AP (from the smaller of the two Clockhouse roundabouts, Salisbury Road leads into Church Avenue), ☏ +44 1252 513111. This Anglican church's crypt is believed to house the remains of many of the Earls of Anglesey, and it is a pretty Norman church in its own right, probably with Saxon origins. On one of the walls inside is the damaged remains of a medieval fresco depicting Saints Agnes, Eugenia, and Mary Magdalene, which was uncovered by accident in 1880 at roughly the same time the Empress moved into Farnborough; coincidence or Divine providence? Free.  (updated May 2020)
The Empress Eugénie's former home is now a private girls' school, called 51.3009-0.750312 Farnborough Hill. This is an impressive grade-I listed monument, essentially a country château mixing French neo-gothic and English mock Tudor styles. It is not open to the public at any time. The best view of the house you can get without trespassing on the estate is from a 51.3013-0.74582 footpath which runs between Ship Lane and Highgate Lane. The distance allows you to view the building in its entirety, but you can't see many of the architectural details. When the school is closed, look out for wildlife including foxes and Canada geese.

Macquarie Infrastructure operates the airport, while Farnborough International are responsible for the airshow and a large events venue. Defence corporations BAE Systems and QinetiQ both have their world headquarters here, and BMW has its UK HQ in the town.

Other major employers include Autodesk, FlightSafety, Fluor, Gulfstream, Syneos Health, Qualcomm, and Zurich.

Buy[edit]
The town centre is reasonably well-equipped with high street chains and supermarkets, but it has a smaller range of shops than might be expected for a town its size. Built between the 1960s and the present day, with some parts still a literal construction site, the result is a depressingly ugly mix of indoor shopping malls (Kingsmead and Princes Mead), pedestrianised high street (Queensmead) and retail parks.

In the south of Farnborough, the suburb of North Camp has a varied selection of independent specialist shops, including bakeries, butchers, delicatessens, book shops, and sports and outdoor equipment stores.

Eat[edit]
North-East Hampshire is the place to try Nepalese food in Britain, being home to around 10,000 Nepali people. The town also has a good choice of independent restaurants and cafés to suit any taste or budget and, with some exceptions, is mercifully free of the chain restaurants found everywhere else (if you're looking for the likes of Pizza Express or Nando's, go to Aldershot). Some pubs listed in the 'drink' section also serve food, but are primarily known as drinking establishments.

Drink[edit]
Farnborough is something of a ghost town after dark, despite the cinema and great restaurant selection bringing in extra evening footfall. Visitors looking for proper nightlife are advised to head into London. The glittering lights of the wallet-munching West End are only 45 minutes away on the train and Tube, after all. The last train home leaves Waterloo just after 1AM, though true night owls will hold out for the first morning service at 5:30AM!
For those content with a quieter evening, Farnborough does offer a selection of decent pubs and bars, many of which hum with locals on weekend nights. If nothing else, you will find a proper pint and good conversation.

Go next[edit]
If you're exploring South East England, Farnborough is a great place to base yourself. All the towns and attractions listed below are within 30 miles of Farnborough (with one obvious exception!), and many are a lot closer.

Immediate vicinity[edit]
Aldershot, Farnborough's immediate neighbour to the south, is the natural next port of call. The "home of the British Army" is home to two military museums, an artificial ski slope and a lido, as well as Rushmoor's two theatres.
Camberley, the neighbouring town to the north with a wider range of shops, the Royal Logistics Corps Museum and the popular canal-side Frimley Lodge Park.
Farnham, an historic market town with an attractive selection of independent shops and a castle. Just to the south is avian zoo Birdworld.
Fleet, the neighbouring town to the west, has the 28-ha Fleet Pond and surrounding nature reserve.
Guildford, the nearby county town of Surrey has the newest Anglican cathedral in Britain, an art deco masterpiece dating from the 1930s.
Odiham, a small Georgian market town surrounded by pretty countryside and a castle which was once besieged by the French.
Sandhurst, a village whose name is synonymous with military prestige, as it is where all British Army officers receive initial training.
Woking, another commuter town like Farnborough with its own sights, including the oldest mosque in Britain.
Brookwood Cemetery, a vast civilian and military cemetery with potentially hours of interest. One stop on the train from Farnborough Main and the south exit of Brookwood station leads directly into the cemetery.
Further afield[edit]
London is impossible to sum up in a sentence, and impossible to miss out when you're this close.
Alton is a pretty mid-Hants market town, start of the Watercress Line steam railway, and near to the homes of Jane Austen and Gilbert White.
Ascot is perfect for a day at the races, with the annual highlight being Royal Ascot.
Hampton Court Palace is often compared unfavourably to Versailles - by fools overlooking the magnificent 500-year-old royal palace in front of them!
The South Downs National Park's rolling chalk hills are south of Farnham.
Winchester, the ancient cathedral city of King Alfred the Great.
Windsor, home to the famous royal castle and expansive Great Park. Nearby Eton is home to the prestigious boys' school, while Runnymede was the island where King John was forced to sign the Magna Carta.
