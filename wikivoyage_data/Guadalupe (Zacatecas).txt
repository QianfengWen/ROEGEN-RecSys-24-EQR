Convento de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe
Guadalupe (Zacatecas) is a mid-size city of more than 200,000 inhabitants that is a suburb of Zacatecas in the Bajio region of Mexico. Guadalupe has been designated as one of Mexico's Pueblos Mágicos.


Understand[edit]
Guadalupe was first settled by the Spanish in 1546. Prior to that, the area was occupied by semi-nomadic indigenous groups like the zacatecos and the guachichiles. No significant pre-hispanic settlements had been built at Guadalupe. For many decades after the Spanish conquest, settlers were primarily secular or military. It was not until the mid 17th century that Christian missionaries developed a significant presence in Guadalupe.
In 1678, construction began on the Convento de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe---the first major church to be established in Guadalupe. More would follow in the 18th century as the Franciscans built a hospital and college, along with more churches and chapels. The college was a significant training center for monks who would be sent north to evangelize in the northern territories of Mexico and what is today the southwest United States (then a part of Mexico).
At the end of the 18th century and into the early 19th century, mining and other industries were developed in Zacatecas and nearby states. At least 6 large haciendas were built in and around Guadalupe.
