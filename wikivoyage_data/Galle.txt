Galle Central Bus Station
From Colombo you can take the train in the direction Mirissa or bus. Both travel along the coastline and have beautiful views.
There are 2 options for bus transport between Colombo and the main bus station in Galle: private a/c minibus and luxury Southern Expressway bus.

 Private a/c minibus. Smaller than the typical big buses, it seats only about 25 people (plus another 7 people will be jammed inside standing). 3 hours in normal conditions; more than 4 hours if Colombo traffic is bad. This option is more convenient than the Southern Expressway bus if you need to start or end in central Colombo. Also more comfortable than the train: on the bus, you can be sure to get a seat if you start at either Galle main bus station or Colombo Fort, whereas getting a seat on the train is a matter of luck (and ability to push). Beautiful ocean views during almost the entire trip (the road is even closer to the ocean than the train tracks and spends much more time on the edge of the water). Rs 270. (updated Nov 2022)
 Southern Expressway bus. 1½ hr. Bus goes from Maharagama station, not Colombo Fort. Direct, comfortable "luxury" bus runs every 20 minutes in both directions. Travels via the Southern Expressway, a very modern, smooth and essentially empty toll highway. Views of forests (many palm trees), but no ocean views. Much faster and direct than the private a/c buses which start and end at Colombo Fort, but not so convenient for tourists who want to be at Colombo Fort. Colombo Fort to Maharagama is around 60 minutes or more on the crowded public buses; luggage bigger than a small bag can be very difficult, but definitely easier than on the private a/c minibus. Rs 370. (updated Nov 2022)
Trains travel several times every day and can be crowded:

6.0333180.214311 Galle Railway Station, Colombo Rd (right on the seashore). Train timetable. The 115km journey from Colombo takes beteween 1½ hr - 3½ hr depending on the train taken. Rs 120 - 220 (depending on class).  
From Ella/Badulla:
There is one public bus in the morning from Badulla at 6:30AM and Ella around 7AM to Galle. From Badulla the ticket costs Rs 346 (as of May 2018).

Get around[edit]
Tuk Tuk or on foot is your best bet if you are traveling in Galle or close by. The Old Town of Galle and its fortifications are within walking distance from the central bus station, so it's better to walk rather than to take a tuk-tuk.
The bus is an easy and cheap way to get to Matara, Unawatuna or Hikkaduwa from Galle.

Prices are typically 10-40% higher than for the same fish direct from fishermen on the beach (for example, compared to the informal market located a 5-minute walk away to the northeast (along the water towards Unawatuna)).

Others[edit]

There is a good gift shop on Pedlar Street called Shoba - it is opposite the Peddlar's Inn and stocks a large range of handmade goods which are direct from the craftsman/women who have made them. It is a good alternative to the large retail chain "Barefoot" which you will find is often crowded with tourists. The owner is very nice and will stop and chat to you about the very interesting history of Galle if you are willing to listen. Their website says that they offer traditional craft courses (Dec 2012).
6.0335280.218086 Municipal Shopping (GMS Shopping Complex), Main Street / Sea St (east to the Galle Central Bus Station). 
Eat[edit]
 Seafood Restraurant (Fish Market Street at the corner of Dickson Road). Literally a hole in the wall located just behind the main Galle Fish Market. 1kg of fresh crabs cooked at local restaurant behind the Fish Market. Total cost for 2 people: Rs 1200, including crabs, coconut curry, rice, vegetable and lentil curries. it's a tiny, one family-operation: father cooks, mother prepares plates and cleans. Only 5 plastic chairs and a small counter, not enough space to turn around. For adventurous travelers looking for a truly local restaurant outside the typical tourist restaurants or the made-only-for-foreigners "authentic cooking experiences", it's by far the best option for seafood in Galle. Buy your seafood fresh yourself, either at the market directly in front of this restaurant or at any other market. Bring your seafood to this restaurant around lunchtime, and the owner will cook it for you with spices and coconut curry. 1 kg of crabs costs around Rs 700 in the market, pay the restaurant Rs 500 more, so for Rs 1200 total, you have a huge feast for 2 people: 1kg of freshly cooked crabs in coconut curry with unlimited rice, dahl (lentils) and vegetable curries. Nowhere in Galle or the surrounding beach towns offers such a good deal, neither in price or in taste. Tuna, prawns, squid... you choose whatever you want, you can get it fresh and cooked in delicious coconut curry. 
 Anura's Restaurant (Inside the fort). serves a mixture of local foods, pizzas, sandwiches and other snacks. 
6.0259180.217041 Karunadasa Restaurant, 23 Light House St (in the Fort). 
 Mama's. Authentic Sri Lanken food. Mama and her daughter run two cooking classes daily (morning and noon) which includes sitting down to eat the food you learn to cook. It is often difficult to get a table at the roof top restaurant, but it might be easier to book the afternoon cooking class including dinner. The cooking class was a highlight of Galle. 
 Serindipity. A good option for dessert. It can be quite hard to get them to serve you food as they often close their kitchen for cooking classes during the day and also closes quite early at night (before 9 PM). 
6.0261180.216592 Cafe The Pedler's Inn, 92, Pedler Street (In the Fort), azeez@pedlarsinn.com. The milkshakes are a must for a hot day, and the sandwiches are pretty good, too! If staying for dinner be sure to finish it off with the home made chocolate brownies with ice cream. 
 Ice cream parlour signed by a large 'Dairy King' poster, Church street. The products are a mixture of home made and bought produce. The home made mango and the home made coconut is particularly good. The brownies are better at the "Fort Galle Hotel".
