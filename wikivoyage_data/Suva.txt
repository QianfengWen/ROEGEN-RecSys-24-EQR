Suva is on the southeast coast of the main island of Fiji, Viti Levu. Suva became the capital of Fiji in 1877. Fiji's tallest building, the Reserve Bank of Fiji Building, is in downtown Suva, also known as the Central Business District (CBD).
The Fiji School of Medicine and one of the three campuses of the University of the South Pacific are in Suva.
Suva tends to be the major commercial and political centre of Fiji, whereas Nadi (pronounced "NAN-dee") is the major tourist centre.

Queens Highway leads west from Suva, passing Lami; the next major towns to the west are Navua, Pacific Harbour, and Sigatoka. It takes approximately 4 hours by bus from Nadi to Suva via the Queens Highway. Princes Highway goes north from Suva, through Colo-i-Suva Forest Park, and eventually connects to Kings Highway in Nausori at the Rewa Bridge, the longest bridge in Fiji and the longest bridge of its type in the South Pacific.
Suva is one of Fiji's major harbors and is home to a fishing fleet and major port.  Cruise ships also stop in Suva.  Several boat companies cooperate with bus companies to permit travelers to visit other islands by taking a bus from Suva, using a roll-on/roll-off (or RO-RO) ferry, and continuing to the town destination on the island.  One example if this bus/boat combination is the trip from Suva to Levuka (Fiji's former capitol) on the island of Ovalau.

Stay safe[edit]
Suva is a friendly city, but there are some pickpockets and thieves. Avoid people who approach you asking for your name and country. They often want to lead you to a shop and then try to sell you overpriced souvenirs they might have hand-made themselves. Goods sold by these people are very overpriced -- tourists are strongly not advised to purchase anything from these places.
Do not let anyone lead you off to another location to see something such as a ship from your country as this is an scam to isolate you and put you in a weak position. You may later encounter something such as a robbery. Offers of anything free are probably not, even in friendly Fiji.
