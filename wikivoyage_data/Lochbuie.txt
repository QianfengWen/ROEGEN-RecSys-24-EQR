Lochbuie (Locha Buidhe, yellow loch) is a tiny settlement on Mull in the Scottish Inner Hebrides. It's in a small fertile patch amid boggy rocky uplands, miles from anywhere. The population might be a couple of dozen, outnumbered 1000 to 1 by the midges.

"We came without any difficulty, at evening, to Lochbuy, where we found a true Highland Laird, rough and haughty, and tenacious of his dignity; who, hearing my name, inquired whether I was of the Johnstons of Glencroe, or of Ardnamurchan." - Samuel Johnson and Boswell visited in 1773.
You need a car, or to be a keen cyclist: Lochbuie is 20 miles from Craignure down a long lonely lane with no public transport.

Get around[edit]
The village sights are all within a short walk.

See[edit]
56.3558-5.85861 Moy Castle, Lochbuie PA62 6AA. Remains of a 15th-century tower, abandoned in 1752. The structure is unsafe so you can't go inside. It was the location for the 1945 Powell-Pressburger film I know where I'm going.   (updated May 2022)
56.3583-5.8582 Lochbuie Stone Circle is a well preserved prehistoric stone circle. It's within the grounds of Lochbuie House but you can walk to it via a boggy path. The house was built in the 18th century and once hosted Johnson and Boswell; it's private.
St Kilda's is the small chapel, built 1876; Episcopal (Anglican) services are occasionally still held here.
56.351-5.8683 Eilean Mòr is the tidal island that shelters the village. It's just rough grazing but has views.
56.3452-5.84234 Maclaine Mausoleum is reached by a two-mile hike south of the village. It's medieval but re-built in 1864.
Do[edit]
The best beach is Laggan Sands, east of the tidal island. Walk south along them to visit the MacLaine clan mausoleum.
