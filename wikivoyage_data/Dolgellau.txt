See[edit]
52.75829-3.8961991 Cymer Abbey (short walk out of town). 12th-century ruined Cistercian abbey   
52.742391-3.8857812 Ty Siamas (The National Centre for Welsh Folk Music), Neuadd Idris, Eldon Square, ☏ +44 1341 421800, idris@tysiamas.com. This lovely old building in the centre of Dolgellau had fallen into disuse after variously being used as a town hall, assembly room, cinema, dancehall and grain store since being built in around 1870. It has been fully refurbished and re-opened as Ty Siamas in June 2007. The centre has an interactive exhibition on Welsh traditional music, as well as a shop and cafe. There is also an auditorium which hosts regular concerts - check websites or local advertising for details. It is named after Elis Siamas, from the nearby village of Llanfachreth. He lived in the late 17th and early 18th centuries and is credited with the development of the triple harp which is synonymous with Welsh harp music. It is said that he was court harpist for Queen Anne (reigned 1702-1714).   
Do[edit]
 Cadair Idris (2930 feet/893 metres). Walk to the summit. Parts of the route are very steep, but once on the shoulder of the mountain, the going is easier. There are several routes, but the closest to Dolgellau takes the so-called Pony Path, and takes about two and a half to three hours to reach the summit. 
 Pan for gold (in the river at nearby Bontddu). Dolgellau was at the centre of a "gold rush" in the 19th Century and its mines at Clogau and Gwynfynydd were worked on and off right up until the 21st century. You're extremely unlikely to strike it rich but it can be fun trying. 
 Mawddach Trail. Walk or cycle along the 9-mile stretch of former railway line, that runs along the scenic estuary of the Mawddach river, through Penmaenpool and on to the sea at Morfa Mawddach. From here you can cross the toll bridge to Barmouth. 
 Mawddach Way. Walk the 49-km-long circular footpath walk around the Mawddach Estuary. 
 Coed y Brenin Forest. Follow one of the 6 mountain bike trails in the forest. This was the first UK forest to be developed for mountain biking, and there are a range of tracks to suit everyone from families to expert mountain-bikers. 
Events[edit]
 Sesiwn Fawr: .  World Music Music Festival in mid-July.  With 6 stages, there's something for everyone.   (date needs fixing)

Go next[edit]
Tucked away on the idyllic southern shore of the Mawddach estuary, the village of Penmaenpool is 3 miles west of Dolgellau. Penmaenpool can be reached by road (A493) or via the disused railway line footpath and cycle route which starts near the main car park in Dolgellau. The railway path "calls" first at Penmaenpool, but extends another three miles or so to Morfa Mawddach and the Barmouth railway bridge which can be crossed for a modest toll.
Continuing westwards from Penmaenpool, the main road turns to the south at Fairbourne. From here it twists and turns along the cliff tops through the pretty village of Llwyngwril to Rhoslefain. Just a few miles to the south lies the town of Tywyn, with miles of sandy beach. Tywyn is also home to the famous Talyllyn Railway.
If you fancy a day at the seaside, then Barmouth is easily reached by local buses or by walking or cycling along the Mawddach Trail.
