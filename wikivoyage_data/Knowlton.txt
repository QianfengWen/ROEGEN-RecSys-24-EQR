Understand[edit]
Knowlton is the main village in the amalgamated Town of Lac-Brome. The town consists of seven nearby villages. The other six villages are Bondville, East Hill, Foster, Fulford, Iron Hill, and West Brome. Lac-Brome has been a summer destination for wealthy families for many years and is ringed with exquisite cottage homes and boasts a marina and municipal beach.
