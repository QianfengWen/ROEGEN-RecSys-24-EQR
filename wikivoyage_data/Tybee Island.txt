Tybee Island Light Station
Tybee Island is a popular beach town and barrier island 18 mi (29 km)  east of Savannah along the Atlantic coast of Georgia.


Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
GA-26/US-80 is the only route onto the island and passes directly through Savannah on its way east.

By plane[edit]
Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport (SAV IATA) is about 45 minutes away from the island and is served by seven airlines. The airport is directly served by Interstate 95 and is located about 20 minutes north of Savannah.
By bike[edit]
It's about 18 miles from Savannah along route 80, and most of the highway has no bike lanes or paved shoulder to ride on.  However, it is a scenic ride, and flat.

Get around[edit]
By car[edit]
GA-26/US-80 is the main street through town and is known locally as Butler Ave. The main drag along the beach is Strand Ave and runs from 14th Street to 18th Street.

By bike[edit]
The island is quite accessible by bike, and is the preferred method of getting around with a more relaxed, beach attitude.  Bikes can be rented for this purpose (see the Do section below).
