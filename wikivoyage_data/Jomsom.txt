Jomsom
Jomsom is a village in the Annapurna mountains of Nepal. It is the capital of the Mustang district of the Dhawalagiri (Dhaulagiri) zone of Nepal.
The town is a popular starting/ending point for treks along the Kali Gandaki River valley as well as up to Muktinath on the Jomsom-Muktinath Trek. Both the treks can be done as part of the Annapurna Circuit.

By plane[edit]
Map of Jomsom
Jomsom Airport
28.78111183.7236111 Jomsom Airport (JMO  IATA). Has daily flight connections to Pokhara although cloud cover at Pokhara or Jomson and high winds particularly at Jomson might cause delays or cancellations. Airlines covering the area include Tara Airlines & Nepal Airlines.   
By jeep[edit]
Jomsom now has a tenuous road connection with Beni and onwards to Pokhara. The road is prone to landslides and flooding particularly during the monsoon.

On foot[edit]
With the new road from Beni, Jomson has now become the terminus of the Annapurna circuit and a large number of trekkers come from Manang via the Thorung-La

Get around[edit]
Jomson is a compact little town.

See[edit]
Jomsom is a beautiful small town, at an altitude of 2,800 meters, in the Kaligandaki River Valley, nestled in the lap of Mt. Dhaulagiri and Mt. Nilgiri. Tibetan culture and beautiful landscapes are featured here.

Do[edit]
Jomson has few attractions of its own but is a gateway for treks to Muktinath and Lo-Mantang as well as a common end point for treks from Manang. Jomson used to be the half-way point on the Annapurna circuit but with the road construction it has now effectively become its terminus.

Buy[edit]
There are a number of shops selling handicrafts as well as all the items trekkers normally would want from chocolate bars to trekking poles. One of the more unusual items commonly for sale are fossilized saligrams that are found in this area attesting to the fact that this was the sea bottom once!

Eat[edit]
All hotels have attached restaurants with remarkably comprehensive menus and as the food tends to subsidize the room cost you are expected to eat in your hotel or they will increase the room rate!
