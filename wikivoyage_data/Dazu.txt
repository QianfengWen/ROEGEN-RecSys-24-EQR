By train[edit]
29.4242105.742291 Dazu South Station (大足南站), Chongqing-Kunming Expressway, Youting Town (The train station is linked to Dazu Bus Station and Dazu Passenger Transport Center via public bus routes 204 and 206 respectively). This station is on the Chengdu-Chongqing high-speed railway. Eight trains serve this station daily from central Chongqing, including five from Shapingba Station (24-31 minutes), two from Chongqing North Station (37-43 minutes) and one from Chongqing West Station (34 minutes). There are also eight trains daily from Chengdu, all of which depart from the Chengdu East Station and take between 54 to 76 minutes to reach Dazu. An important thing to keep in mind is that Dazu South Station is outside Dazu's main urban area and is about 37km further away from the rock carvings than the bus station. For this reason, many people still prefer to go to Dazu by bus. (updated Jul 2018)

Beware of the growling dogs that patrol the grounds!). 
Do[edit]
Dazu is an average semi-urban district of around a million people and at first sight, it may appear that there isn't much to see or do within the area besides going there to view the famous rock carvings. But in fact, that isn't quite true.
One interesting option would be to bike around the verdant farm lands. No rentals are available so bring your own bike. The route to the most impressive carvings located at Baodingshan (宝顶山) is rather scenic and could offer a potential biking destination. It does however require biking up several long steep stretches and Chinese drivers are notoriously dangerous. Wear bright colors and leave early if you choose this option!
Several internet bars are located in Dazu, including on Longzhong Road near Dazu Binguan and Jinyuan Luguan.

29.54514105.803561 Longshui Lake Tourist Resort (龙水湖旅游度假区), Yulong Town (Take a long-distance coach to Longshui Bus Station (龙水汽车站), then take bus no 208 and get off at the Longshui Hot Springs Center (龙水温泉中心) bus stop. You may also catch bus 208 from outside Dazu Bus Station), ☏ +86 23 85311666. This is Dazu's second biggest tourist attraction after the Dazu Rock Carvings. Situated on the northern side of Longshui Lake (actually a man-made reservoir), the resort features numerous hot springs and a water-based amusement park. You can also go on boat rides on the lake or try out a military style obstacle course that runs through a forested area. ¥138 for entry to the amusement park, ¥50 for tour boat ride, ¥70 for sailboat ride, ¥60 to use the obstacle course. (updated Jul 2018)
Buy[edit]
There are plenty of opportunities to buy trinkets within urban Dazu and at many of the cave sites. One local specialty to look for is purple stone jadite, which is carved into a variety of trinkets, from pendants for ¥10 to large statues running into the thousands of yuan.

Eat[edit]
There are numerous restaurants located within the area. The buffet breakfasts at Dazu Bingguan are a good deal at ¥15. Dazu is located in China's spice bowl and famous spicy hotpot is widely available for those who wish to test their intestinal fortitude.
A minimarket is located next to the Longzhong Road bus station and every block has a couple of stores selling food.

Drink[edit]
Cold beer is plentiful in restaurants throughout Dazu and water and soft drinks are readily available at the rock carving sites. Anything near the site will be price inflated as expected.

Sleep[edit]
Numerous hotels are located in Dazu's urban area and around Baodingshan, though not all will accept foreigners.

Dazu Bingquan (大足 兵馆) is the most decent option available. Located on the corner of Longzhong Road (龙中路) and Longgang Road (龙岗路) the hotel is a large complex of several buildings and dozens of rooms. The rates listed on the wall start at over ¥300 per, but the actual price after negotiating starts at ¥180, for a clean twin with air conditioning, to well above ¥300. The telephone number is 02343721888 and the fax number is 023-43722967.
Another option is the family run Jinyuan Luguan (金原 旅官) located at 55 Longzhong Road (龙中路). A clean single with airconditioning starts at ¥120. Unfortunately the sign outside the hotel is only in Chinese and the staff doesn't speak English.
Rooms are also available at the Beishan Bingguan located at the Beishan rock carvings. Rooms start at ¥150.
