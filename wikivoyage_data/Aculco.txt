Cascadas la Concepcion, waterfalls in Aculco
Aculco (sometimes referred to as Aculco De Espinoza, or more commonly as San Jeronimo Aculco) is a small city of about 40,000 souls in rural Mexico State. It is a historic town with a lot of colonial era charm and a mountain setting with scenic waterfalls. It is one of the designated sites along the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Aculco has also been designated as one of Mexico's Pueblos Magicos by the federal tourism department (SECTUR).
Aculco is a popular weekend destination for couples from Mexico City. They come for the romance of the colonial town, with its gleaming white small cobblestone streets (callejons) and its reputation as an artist colony. Aculco is also known for its cheese.


Understand[edit]
Aculco is the center of one of Central Mexico's pockets of Otomi indigenous people. The town was originally founded by the Otomi in 1110 AD. The Otomi are related to the Aztec and their language is a dialect of Nahuatl. The state of Tlaxcala is the traditional homeland of the Otomi, but population pockets are scattered among the states of Central Mexico. Aculco has a rich local history. It was conquered by the Aztecs in the early 14th century and became a vassal state, paying tribute to the Aztec empire under Moctezuma. Aculco was also a site of one of the earliest battles for independence from the Spanish crown in 1810 (spoiler alert: Father Hidalgo's independence force lost the battle at Aculco, though they went on to win the war.)
Aculco has a mild climate, with cool mountain temperatures and moderate rainfalls. The city has an average temperature of 14º C. Temperatures vary by season but are rarely too cold or too hot.  

Get in[edit]

Aculco is off the beaten path so it will take some effort to get there.  The best way is by bus to Acambay, then take a taxi the last 10 miles or so into Aculco. It's also possible to just hire a taxi (or even an Uber) in Mexico City to take you all the way to Aculco. It's about a 60 mile trip, will take an hour and a half, and cost about M$1000 (US$50).
To get there by bus from Mexico City, start at the Observatorio bus terminal and buy a ticket at the Flecha Roja counter. Flecha Roja has several buses per day going to Acambay (about every 3 hours). The trip takes 2 hours, 20 minutes and costs M$180-220, depending on the time of day and bus class.

Get around[edit]
Aculco is a small town. Walking is the best way to explore, or use a local taxi for longer distances.

See[edit]
Plaza Constitución
Church of San Jeronimo Aculco - established by Franciscan padres in 1540, the colonial-era church was renovated and expanded in the early 19th century
Waterfalls: there are two waterfalls not to be missed in Aculco, the largest is Cascadas de la Concepcion, and the other is Cascadas de Tixhiñu. Cascadas de la Concepcion has a broad downspout that drops 15 meters as it sprays the impressive basalt stone columns that rise up alongside a peaceful green basin. Tixhinu is a somewhat smaller waterfall but also displays impressive basalt columns. Mountain sports (climbing and rappeling) are allowed around both waterfalls.
Bullfight arena Garrido Varela - bullfights are usually held in the fall, October-November timeframe
Plaza Constitucion is the main zocalo area in el centro, it's full of towering shade trees and sculpted topiary and is a pleasant place to sit and feed the pigeons or walk hand-in-hand on a warm summer evening
