Florence is a city on the Central Oregon Coast.


Understand[edit]
Many of the ideas in Frank Herbert's Dune series came to him during a 1957 trip to Florence to write a magazine article for Simon & Schuster about a US Department of Agriculture project there to plant a species of European beach grass near the Siuslaw River.  The project, it was hoped, would moderate the widespread intrusion of the dunes upon the local ecology, where the wind and sand interfered with railroads and highways, hindering the growth of local forests and it was feared, the spread would threaten the local water supply.  Interestingly, Herbert never finished the article.
Florence is also known as the site of the exploding whale, an incident when the Oregon State Highway Division tried to remove a beached whale by dynamite - with unintended results.

The Waterfront Depot in Bay Street, with a river deck, is the restaurant most strongly recommended by locals, and reservation is advised.
