Clock Tower
Poros (Greek: Πόρος) is a green island situated in the Saronic Gulf, 59 km (32 nautical miles) from the Piraeus harbour of Athens. It has an area of 33 km², a shoreline of 42 km, and a population of about 3,650.
In ancient times it was considered the island of Poseidon, God of the Sea. This is evident from various literary references and from the traces of the temple of Poseidon, which are to be found in the middle of the island. The word “Poros” in ancient Greek means a small sea passage. Nothing could describe better the island of Poros, since the closest distance between the island and Galatas on the coast of the Peloponnese is 200 m.
The island is divided in two. Kalavria is the bigger part and Sfairia, which includes the town of Poros, is the smaller part.
This quiet yet cosmopolitan island features lush pine trees, crystal clear beaches, a lively waterfront adorned with shops, cosy cafes and restaurants, a picturesque capital with grand traditional mansions and cobbled streets that has been declared a protected settlement and a wide selection of entertainment venues.
As you approach the island of Poros by boat, the historic clock dominates the view on the hill’s highest peak, encircled by prickly pear and pine trees. Constructed in 1927, it is clearly visible from all angles and is considered the town's main attraction. From the clock, the view of the port and the coastal areas across the passage is magnificent.


Understand[edit]
Aerial view
Poros is a quiet island full of pine trees which reach the shores and sandy beaches. The large homes on the beach have a neoclassical style in contrast to the common duplex houses in Brinia, Milo, Pounta and Kasteli. The first dwellings were built in 1463 around the famous clock.
Many tavernas are sparsely located among the picturesque alleyways and the whitewashed houses of Poros which are surrounded by bougainvillea. Visitors can enjoy souvenir shops, cafeterias, tavernas and clubs playing Greek and English music all along the pier.

Orientation[edit]
In the centre of the town you can find the town hall, the archaeological museum, a public library along with a reception hall for exhibitions and other cultural events.
Leaving the centre, you will see the Pregymnasium in the northwest which happens to be Othona's first residence. Today, this area is used for sailors' training and ranking. After passing the field, you will come across a small canal separating Sferia from Kalavria.
After crossing the canal you will encounter Sinikismos, the first community of Asia Minor refugees. Towards the end of Sinikismos, if you follow the spiral road surrounded by enormous pine trees, you will end up at the church of Our Lady Agia Zoni. It's located between a steep cliff with lots of trees and running water where the Temple of Poseidon is also found.
On your way back to the canal's bridge, towards the left and west, you will see an area called Perlia. The road continues along the coast, passes through Villa Galini and Mikro Neorio and, eventually, reaches Megalo Neorio. Further down is the Love Cove, the Russian dockyard along with the islet called Daskalio.
On the right hand side of the canal's road you will pass through Kanali. Heading east leads you to Askeli. As you continue, the road branches out towards the monastery of Zoodohos Pygi. Going north you will reach the temple of Poseidon, Vagionia and passing by Agio Stathi and Profiti Elia it goes back through Sinikismo to the canal.

Get in[edit]
Hydrofoil
Car ferry
By boat[edit]
As of June 2017 there are two companies serving Poros from Piraeus. Hellenic Seaways operates catamarans four to five times a day. Single tickets cost €24.50. Saronic Ferries has bigger and slower ships that also take vehicles, and single tickets cost just €14.
Galatas on the mainland is just a few hundred metres from Poros, and frequent small ferries also carrying vehicles make the crossing in 5 minutes; tickets are only around €1.

By plane[edit]
Poros doesn't have an airport but many visitors come by the way of Athens Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport. It has been rebuilt and now offers spacious air-conditioned halls, shopping facilities, several restaurants and internet cafés.
From Venizelos, there is a shuttle bus (Number X95) going straight to the port of Piraeus (Port no. 8). The buses are also top of the line, very comfortable and air-conditioned. It makes absolutely no sense to take a taxi since it's no faster than the bus but will cost you €30 instead of €3 for the bus ticket. Chances are also very high that the driver will overcharge you, so confirm the price before you get in the taxi. The “Karaiskakis Square” bus stop is next to Gate 8, from which the ferry boat as well as the hydrofoil boat leave for Poros. From Piraeus there are ferries to Poros, per By boat above.
Alternatively you can get a limousine driver to meet you at the airport – or any other meeting place of your choice, and drive you to Galatas, next to Poros. The first 100 km are on the motorway, and then you will continue on country roads through beautiful scenery via Epidaurus to the village of Galatas, where you can get over to Poros in a private boat in four minutes time. This trip takes about 2½ hours door to door, and costs about €300 depending on number of passengers, including tolls and boat.

 Helenic Sun Travel (Constantinos Alexopoulos), Askeli, 18020 Poros, ☏ +30 6977408518. Transfer limousines from/to Venizelos airport 
You can also fly to Poros from the airport by helicopter[dead link], a service which started in 2004. The price depends on your luggage.
Given that the ferries from Galatas take cars too, getting in by car (e.g. rented at the airport) can possibly also be an option, especially if you plan to explore the Greek countryside further (see Greece#Get around).

By bus[edit]
There are public bus connections (KTEL, phone service 14505, in Greek) between Piraeus, Isthmos, Nafplio and Galatas. From there you can get to Poros in just a few minutes by ferry, as mentioned in By boat above.

Walking in town
Poros consists of two smaller islands, connected via a small bridge: Sfairia island with the town of Poros and the pine-clad Kalavria island. Together they cover 31 km² and have a coastline of 42 km. Vigla is the highest peak with an altitude of 358 m.
Bus and taxi terminals are located in the centre of the beach area. Access to boats that go along the shores of Galata is also available there. In general public transport around the island runs smoothly all day. Buses leave every hour while boats depart every ten minutes. On the beach you can find scooter and bike rentals whereas cars are rented just opposite the island, in Galata.

By boat[edit]
Small boats connect Poros with Galata (every 10 minutes), the charming Alike beach, underneath the Lemon Groves, and – upon demand – Askeli beach. The ferry boat to Galata connects the island with the mainland once an hour, from 07:10 to 22:10 daily (€1 per passenger). In the summer it runs every 30 minutes. Taxi service includes cars and boats, both working 24 hours a day, with an emergency service for the late night hours only.

On foot[edit]
Poros is a fairly small island, perfect for hiking, jogging, and lazy strolls through the town’s picturesque alleyways or along the cosmopolitan harbor promenade. A moderately fit person can walk from the town centre to the monastery in approximately an hour.

By bus[edit]
Public transport offers two bus lines, both starting from the central square on the harbor promenade. With “Neorion Line” you can explore the southwest coastline with the beaches of Cochylia, Neorion, Love Bay and the Russian Bay. The “Monastery Line” drives along the southeastern coast with the beaches of Askeli, Panagitsa, and picturesque Monastery Beach. The fares are moderate. They do not, however, tend to run very late into the evening as demand is fairly low at that time. Their timing is fairly predictable except at lunchtime when the schoolchildren break up and buses can occasionally be kept waiting to pick them up.

By taxi[edit]
There are also a number of grey taxis on the island – reasonably cheap to use. Expect to pay about €6 plus tip from the town centre (that is, the port) to the monastery. The island is too small to support a population of rogue taxis.

By car[edit]
In case you travel with your own car or motor bike, a ferry boat will bring you over from Galata every hour between 08:00 and 22:00 daily. In the summer schedules are every 30 minutes. Ticket reservation is not necessary.
Driving one's own car within the town itself is not recommended as the seafront road is narrow and one-way only except for mopeds and motorcycles. It is frequently constricted by pick-ups and vans delivering to tavernas and shops (unavoidable) and the thoughtless people who will park their car anywhere to avoid walking a few extra yards (eminently avoidable).

Sanctuary of Poseidon
Holy Monastery of Zoodochos Pigi
Russian Naval Base
37.4995523.452271 Clock Tower. This clock tower was built in 1927 and is an imposing feature. It is definitely a bit of a climb from the waterfront, being the highest point of the island, but when you reach it, the view is breathtaking and worth the effort. The clock tower also attracts a number of photographers for the view it offers, the coming together of land, water and sky. Although the tower has a simple appearance, when you watch it closely after 10 minutes going upstairs it is worth visiting because the view is wonderful.  
37.4984123.454732 The Archaeological Museum, Korizis Square. Tu-Su 09:00-15:00. Houses findings from the Sanctuary of Poseidon, from ancient Troizen, Magoula, Apathia, Modi and Saint Constantine from Methana.

37.51963323.4813474 Sanctuary of Poseidon. Remains of the ancient sanctuary are located in the northern part of the island in the centre of the Kalaureian amphictyony.

37.50666323.4861535 Holy Monastery of Zoodochos Pigi (4 km east of the main city of Poros). Founded in 1720 AD and built on the slope of a pine forest. In 1814, a group of monks from Mount Athos took refuge in this monastery. A few years later, these monks founded the Zoodochos Pigi Monastery at Longovarda on the island of Paros. It is a basilica with a dome and a tower-like belfry being the main church of the monastery. The temple is simple without many wall paintings. The precious wood-carved icon, which was made in Kappadokia of Asia Minor in the 17th century, together with the wood-carved iconostasis and the imposing bishop throne, are of great interest. 
37.49028223.4750396 Bourtzi castle. It was built by von Heideck at around 1828, at the place where an old church of St. Constantine had stood. The island was given to the Poros monastery from 1770 on by Antonios Serfos. The standoff between Hydra island and Capodistrias gave the cause for severe fight here in 1831. 
37.50055823.4536827 Open air movie theater "Diana". One of the very few opportunities to enjoy watching a film in the open air as in the past. 
37.5050823.456248 Naval Base. Poros was the site of the first naval base in modern Greece, established in 1827 during the Greek War of Independence. Most of the activities of Poros Naval Base were moved to Salamis Naval Base in 1881. The site is still used today by the Hellenic Navy as a training centre for naval personnel. In 1834 warehouses and bakeries were built there for the supply of the Russian fleet sailing in the Aegean. The Russians kept this property until the 1900s. In 1989, with a ministerial decision, the Russian Dockyard was declared a historical monument due to its great architectural and historical interest.
