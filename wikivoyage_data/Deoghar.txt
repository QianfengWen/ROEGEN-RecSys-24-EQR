Baidyanath Temple
24.492586.71 Baidyanath Temple. According to Hindu mythology, Ravana went to Mount Kailash and prayed to Lord Shiva, who gave him a Jyotirlinga to take to his land, with the promise not to place the lingam anywhere else. In case that happened, the lingam would remain fixed on that spot forever. The gods, who were unhappy at the prospect of the divine lingam being established in the enemy kingdom, which would render them powerless against their adversary, worked a trick on Ravana. He mistakenly handed over the lingam to a Brahmin, who grounded it at Deoghar. Ravana did his best to uproot it but beyond breaking the tip he was unsuccessful. In deep remorse, he used to come to this place everyday and worship the lingam by offering water from the Ganges. Historically the temple is dated to 1596. The temple has almost all god & goddesses and whole temple is built on a single rock. During the month of Sawan (June–July) people from across the country come to offer ganga jal to the divine shivalinga. For centuries, devotees, in the month of Sawan undertake a rigorous 100-km pilgrimage on foot from Ajgaibinath (Sultanganj) in Bhgalpur district to offer holy water from the Ganges to the lingam at Deoghar. It is very crowded in Deoghar during this period as more than 5 million devotees visit every year. Hence it is not recommended for a casual traveler to visit Deoghar during these months.
