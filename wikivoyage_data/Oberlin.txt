Get around[edit]
Due to its small size (approximately 3 square mi), it is easiest to walk or bike around Oberlin. Navigation is fairly simple as the streets run mostly in a standard grid system. There are two major east/west streets (Lorain/511 and College St) which are divided by Main/58 into East/West Lorain and East/West College. North/south streets are divided by College St (ex: Pleasant St. is divided into North/South Pleasant by College St. There are many scenic biking trails on Oberlin's periphery that converge on Tappan Square in downtown Oberlin.
Downtown Oberlin is at the corner of Main and College. The central square, Tappan Square, is across College St. from downtown and is a square block with corners at Main/College Sts., Main/Lorain Sts., N Professor/Lorain Sts., and Professor/College Sts. The Oberlin College campus is just west of Tappan Square (the Student Union building, Wilder Hall, is at 127 W. Lorain St).
