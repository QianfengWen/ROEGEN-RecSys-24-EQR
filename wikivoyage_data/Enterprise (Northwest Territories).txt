Enterprise is a hamlet of 125 people (2017) in Northwest Territories in northern Canada. It is at an important junction of the Mackenzie Highway and the road to Yellowknife.


Understand[edit]
Hay River at Enterprise
Enterprise is a significant point on the Northwest Territories highway system, as all traffic originating from Alberta en route to the two largest population centres, Yellowknife and Hay River, must pass through. It was established in the winter of 1948-49 when a service station was opened at the junction of the Mackenzie Highway and the Mills Lake winter road, which connected to the Mills Lake freight staging area on the Mackenzie River below Fort Providence. In 1959-1960, the highway was extended to Yellowknife on the north side of Great Slave Lake, increasing Enterprise junction's importance. The village was totally destroyed by wildfires in August 2023.  

Climate[edit]
Enterprise has a subarctic climate with the yearly mean temperature being below zero in spite of the relatively warm summers around 22 °C (72 °F) resulting in Enterprise being well below the tree line in the boreal forest. Winter average highs are around −20 °C (−4 °F) with lows being −31 °C (−24 °F), typical of the boreal forests north of the prairies.
