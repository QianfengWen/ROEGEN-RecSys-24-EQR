Just south of Orlando in what is commonly referred to as the "Kissimmee-St. Cloud" area, due to the short distance between it and the adjacent city of St. Cloud. It is centered directly between St. Cloud and Disney World on Highway 192 and leads into SR-535, which leads directly into Disney World theme parks.  Most tourist activity is centered around Highway 192 (also known as Irlo Bronson Memorial Highway and Vine Street in the city of Kissimmee).
Since the opening of Disney World in 1971, Kissimmee has been primarily a tourist-driven town.  Before that the town relied on agriculture and ranching, with a population of just over 4,000 through the 1950s.
