Beckley is a city of 17, 256 (as of 2020) in West Virginia, and is the county seat of Raleigh County pop. 74, 591 (2020).  It sits on a high plateau above the New River Gorge at an elevation of 2,418 feet. It was founded in 1838 and named for John J Beckley, the first Clerk of the House of Representatives and the first Librarian of Congress. 
Once a major coal industry hub, Beckley contains a small historic downtown and many suburban neighborhoods. The Beckley area serves as the overall regional commercial center for Southern West Virginia region, and has many big box stores and chain restaurants, in contrast to the small-town nature of its surrounding communities. Beckley sits as the closest town to the Grandview portion of New River Gorge National Park and Preserve, and has easy access within 40 minutes to the park's 2 other visitor centers near Fayetteville and Hinton.
