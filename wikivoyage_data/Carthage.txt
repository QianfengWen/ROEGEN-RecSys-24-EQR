Understand[edit]
See also: Roman Empire
A Phoenician city from the 6th century BCE, it was the base of a powerful trading empire spanning the entire south Mediterranean and home to a population of the order of half a million people. The legendary founder Queen, Dido, bought from the locals 'as much land as a cow's skin can cover', and by cutting finely the skin of the cow, gained Byrsa Hill. Its most famous general was Hannibal, who crossed the Alps to battle with the Romans. Hannibal suffered his defeat against Roman general Scipio "Africanus" at the Battle of Zama in 202 BCE, which ended the 2nd Punic War. After over 50 years of being watched closely by Rome, they were eventually attacked in the 3rd Punic War. The citizens defended the city against the Republic of Rome in 146 BCE yet lost, and Punic Carthage was completely destroyed by the order of the Senate. The site was redeveloped by the Romans a century later and Carthage became the capital of the Roman province of Africa. Today, it is a UNESCO World Heritage List site.
The Byrsa Hill at the rear of the area dominates both the ocean gulf and the lake and plain of Tunis inland to the west, and is therefore the most strategic point.
Today the district is very affluent, with elite schools, wealthy residents, relatively numerous police, a large number of archaeological sites and museums and the President's own seaside residence.

Get around[edit]
36°51′10″N 10°19′24″EMap of Carthage
Mostly it's best to walk.  However, the area is large and sightseeing is sweaty work on a hot day.

By taxi[edit]
If you are tired, you may wish to get a cab between some of the major tourist spots.  This should be cheaper in low season.

Carthage[edit]
Lots and lots of ruins! The president's palace. Sweeping views of Tunis and the gulf.
You can buy a ticket for 12 DT (Jul 2022) that allows access to about 8 different historic sites/museums, which are a big challenge to see in one day. Only some sites have extensive English signage - many, such as the museum, do not. Some are not open, and most signposts pointing to where they are sketchy at best.
The most impressive sights (with better preserved ruins) are Antonin Baths and Byrsa Hill near the Carthage Museum. Amphitheater, Hill of the Odeon, and Water Cisterns are much smaller but still interesting.

36.854310.33511 Antonin Baths. Ruins of the largest Roman baths outside Rome itself. The site also has a Punic cemetery, some old houses, some Punic kilns, a chapel, some graves, and mosaics. Guides are available in a number of languages, and may be worthwhile as the site is large. It is illegal to take photographs in the direction of the presidential palace. Doing so, especially when traveling alone, may land you in jail for up to 3 years, though the guards don't appear too concerned. 10 DT for entry or use the multi-site ticket.   (updated Nov 2018)
36.85314210.3243952 Carthage Museum. 8:30AM–5:30PM (until 7PM in the summer). Most remnants excavated from the ruins have been stored in the cavernous museum located on Byrsa Hill, documenting both the Punic and the Roman eras. Signs within the museum are entirely in Arabic and French. On the second floor, the part nearer to the staircases showcase artifacts from Roman times, and the inner part the artifacts of the earlier Punic period. Fascinating artifacts such as alabaster jars and jewelry remain. The descriptions of the Roman conquest and the legend of Dixon are also vivid, but sadly, inaccesible to English speakers. The museum grounds offer sweeping views of the coast and city, and also include the ruins of some Punic streets, the former site of a public library, numerous sculptures, a chapel or church, some excellent mosaics and some coffins. A few benches under the trees with a great view make for a good resting spot. Unfortunately many items about the grounds are unlabelled, so a guide may be useful (or eavesdrop on a tour group if you can). Ignore the shifty guy trying to charge you 1 DT to use the toilet. As of Nov 2018 visitors are allowed to access museum grounds only, while museum building is closed for reconstruction. Entry 9 DT or with the multi-site ticket.   (updated Nov 2018)
Acropolium
36.85378410.3233563 Acropolium (St. Louis Cathedral). St Louis Cathedral forms one edge of the museum, but does not appear to be open - it was completed in 1890.   (updated Nov 2018)
36.8593110.3188074 Water Cisterns. A very large series of water cisterns which functioned as a water redistribution point at the terminus of a long (90 km?) aqueduct from the hills to the south. The remnants of the end of the aqueduct are still standing. Also offers reasonable views of the city. Free. (updated Nov 2018)
36.8561210.3150785 Amphitheater. An eviscerated Roman amphitheatre constructed in the first century CE, ringed by forested, rolling hills. Interesting for a quick stroll, but it is unlabelled in any language. May therefore be more interesting with an enthusiastic guide. Worth a look. The adjacent forest may be a nice spot for a picnic. Entrance fee included in the 10-site ticket.   (updated Nov 2018)
36.8413110.322956 Punic Tophet (Salammbo Tophet), Rue Hannibal (It's the island like part that juts out into a circular bay - road signs can be misleading). A frustratingly unlabelled, but large collection of what appear to be children's grave stones. Many stones have simplistic symbols carved in to them. There are also a few half-buried structures. Guide or background reading recommended. Accessible with multi-site ticket. (updated Nov 2018)
36.863810.3387 Basilica of Saint-Cyprien, North of Carthage Présidence Station along Route La Goulette/Rue de Rue de Maroc (Walk north a few hundred metres from the station, turn right with the sign just after the bridge and petrol station to your left.). This historic Christian temple was surrounded by a vast cemetery. Rediscovered in 1915, it was oriented toward a spectacular ocean view which can still be enjoyed. The temple is thought to have been dedicated to the well being of seafarers. All of the valuable remains have been removed, leaving the site somewhat empty. On the plus side, it makes a good picnic spot and there's a chocolate and pastry store right nearby with a service station opposite for drinks. Located very far north relative to most of the Carthaginian ruin sites, this is a good option for the start of a long day's walking. Free. (updated Nov 2018)
36.85710.33768 Presidential Palace (Carthage Palace), Route La Goulette (Between Carthage-Hannibal and Carthage-Présidence stations, on the hill. Look for the national flags!). You can walk past the president's well-guarded palace, which includes a private boat moor and helicopter pad, on the main road. You can also see it from the Antonine Baths, and the ruins above (cross under the TGM railway bridge, then turn right up the hill). Off limits to public, but it's free to view from afar.   (updated Nov 2018)
36.858110.33089 Hill of the Odeon and park of the Roman villas. Accessible with multi-site ticket.   (updated Nov 2018)
36.850810.313710 Circus of Carthage. A Roman circus used for chariot racing, it was modeled on the Circus Maximus in Rome and other circus buildings throughout the Roman Empire. Measuring more than 470 m in length and 30 m in width, it could house up to 45,000 spectators. Not much left of it nowadays though. Free.   (updated Nov 2018)
Other sights[edit]
36.86516810.3298611 World War II North Africa American Cemetery and Memorial (Just north of Carthage, a five-minute walk from the Amilcar Station). daily except for December 25 and January 1; 9AM-5PM. The cemetery is the final resting place for 2,841 American military Dead lost during the War in North Africa.

Built in 1924 under President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali on the site of the Carthaginian war harbour. Collection of stuffed birds and animals, several aquariums, skeletons of fossil fishes. 0.5 DT.  (updated Nov 2018)
Do[edit]
 International Festival of Carthage. In the summer is a treat with big name dancers, singers, and artists from all over the world for a very reasonable price (10.5 DT). Plastic chairs are not worth the price (26 DT) unless you are really aching for back-support. Most people bring cushions or blankets for the amphitheatre seats. Plan a late night out with concerts normally ending after 1AM. 
Buy[edit]
Other than tourist trinkets, unless you are looking for high end furniture or daily use commodities and food you may find your options limited.

Eat[edit]
There are a number of eateries scattered around the district, though most lie outside of the major tourist trail.

Carthage-Byrsa and Carthage-Salammbo Area[edit]

Sleep[edit]
