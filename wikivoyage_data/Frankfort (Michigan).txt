44.632417-86.2355312 Frankfort Mineral Springs, 630 Main St. The Frankfort Mineral Springs used to be advertised as an attraction of the area back in the days when the mineral-rich waters were thought to cure a number of ailments. Although some of the fanfare is gone today, the springs are still around providing cool, mineral-rich water to anyone looking to quench their thirst. A pair of nozzles under a small pavilion continuously provide a stream of water for free. The mineral content provides for a unique flavor. (updated Jul 2021)
