Kin Kin is a town (population 764 in 2016) in the Noosa Hinterland region of South East Queensland, Australia.


Understand[edit]
Kin Kin is a small quiet town located along the route of the Noosa Trail. It is renowned for its delicious food, art and beautiful rural scenery. It is also an Aboriginal name which refers to the species of a small black ant that is common here.

Get in[edit]
Despite being part of the greater Noosa, Kin Kin is nowhere near easy to access, and for the most part, only accessible via car. However, from Noosa, use State Route 6 Cooroy Noosa Road up to Cooroy, and instead of turning left to follow State Route 6 towards M1 Bruce Highway, turn right onto Elm Street and then onto Yurol Forest Drive, and head up the long winding road up the forest. Once you're at Pomona, use Pound Road up passing Pinbarren via Pomona Kin Kin Road and finally up to Kin Kin.

Get around[edit]
The town is small enough that walking is the only option.
