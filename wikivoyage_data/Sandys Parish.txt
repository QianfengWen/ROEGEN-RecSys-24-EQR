Ireland Island is home to the 32.3264-64.83331 Royal Naval Dockyard. Built in 1809, from 1812 to 1957 it was the British Royal Navy's Western Atlantic headquarters. Its main historical role was to supply British ships in the War of 1812 and the American Civil War. Somewhat useless after World War II, the dockyard was repurposed as a cruise ship wharf in the 1980s and now features an eclectic mix of tourist attractions, historic monuments, restaurants and shops. Take half a day to visit, more if you really like military tourism.
