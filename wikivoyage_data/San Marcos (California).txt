Do[edit]
 Discovery Creek Trail. Excellent views for hikers and cyclists. Cyclists will have to put in some work, though, to reach the views, as there is an 0.8-mile paved road uphill- but most agree that it’s worth the climb. The trail totals 1.1 miles with an equestrian path running just south of it. The trail begins at La Noche Drive, runs along Discovery Creek and ends at Lakeview Park.
