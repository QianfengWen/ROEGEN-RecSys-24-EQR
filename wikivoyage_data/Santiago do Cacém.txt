Castle of Santiago do Cacém
38.014722-8.6983331 Santiago Castle. Built by the Moors, it was taken by the Templars in 1157, to be lost in 1185 and recovered, the following year, by the Order of Santiago da Espada.   
Igreja Matriz de Santiago do Cacém
38.0139-8.69782 Igreja Matriz (Mother Church). The church, attached to the castle of Santiago do Cacém, was founded in the 13th century by the Order of Santiago. Over the years it has undergone several reconstructions. The church is home to the Treasury of the Collegiate of Santiago, nucleus of the Museum of Sacred Art of Santiago do Cacém.   
Miróbriga
38.0095-8.68393 Miróbriga Ruins (Miróbrica dos Célticos). An ancient Roman city built on the site of an ancient settlement from the Iron Age that had existed since the 9th century BC. With Roman colonization, it developed into the commercial area around the forum. The spas, among the best preserved in Portugal, are made up of two adjacent buildings, possibly one for the male and one for the female, respectively. Residential areas are still little known. Relatively close to the thermal baths, there is a bridge with a single semicircular arch. The racecourse is the only one completely known in Portuga and is located farther from the centre.
