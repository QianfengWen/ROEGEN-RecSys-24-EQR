Sunset on the Uruguay River in Uruguaiana
Uruguaiana is a town in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, in the South of Brazil, on the border with Paso de los Libres in Argentina.


Understand[edit]
Once the tripoint town on the border with Argentina and Uruguay (before Barra do Quaraí got town status in 1995), Uruguaiana remains a place of transit for all 3 nationalities, and a convenient gateway to Brazil for those in Argentina, Paraguay or Uruguay, roughly equidistant from the three nearest countries' capitals: Buenos Aires (678 km away), Asunción (679 km away) and Montevideo (709 km away).

Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
-29.758879-57.080661 Uruguaiana bus station (close to downtown). It has services from Porto Alegre (Planalto, 11 hr, R$120) and a daily straight service to Buenos Aires leaving at 04:00 (JBL Turismo, 10 hr, R$160). There are also 4 services a day to Barra do Quaraí (M-Sa 06:30, 12:30, 16:00 and 18:00, R$32-46, coming back at 08:00, 10:00 14:00 and 20:00), the Brazilian town across the bridge from Bella Unión in Uruguay. 
Coming from Paso de los Libres with the international commuter bus (30 min, 30 pesos or R$8), the -29.758108-57.0881142 bus stop closest to the bus station is the third after the bridge.

By plane[edit]
-29.784-57.0358063 Uruguaiana airport (officially Rubem Berta International Airport URG  IATA). It is managed by the national airport operator and info about its flights can be found at the respective Infraero webpage. Even though the offer is limited, 4 flights a week to Porto Alegre by Azul (Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday), good offers aren't rare and this is usually the cheapest option to reach further Brazil from Argentina (as flights from Foz do Iguaçu tend to be pricey). As of January 2019, there are no public transit options to the airport, and the taxi from downtown costs around R$50 on Sunday and R$35 any other day (Sundays have a legal surcharge).   
By car[edit]
The city is reachable through BR-290 coming from Porto Alegre and continuing west until the Paso de los Libres/Uruguaiana International Bridge (officially Agustin Justo - Getúlio Vargas Bridge), and through BR-472 coming from São Borja and continuing south until connecting with Uruguay Route 3 towards Salto.
