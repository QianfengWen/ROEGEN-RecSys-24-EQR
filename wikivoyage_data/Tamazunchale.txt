Tamazunchale is a small town of about 25,000 people in San Luis Potosi (state). It has a large Mexica indigenous population. The town lies directly on federal highway MEX 85 (Carratera Mexico-Laredo) not quite halfway between Mexico City and the United States border, making it a popular overnight stop for motorists traveling between the capital and the U.S.


Understand[edit]
During the 15th century, when the Aztec triple alliance was forcing other Meso-american people to pay tribute, the local Huastec leadership rebelled against the Aztecs and refused to pay tribute. The Aztecs responded by having an army march into town, along with thousands of Aztec settlers who would permanently live in Tamazunchale and help ensure that taxes were paid and rebellions quashed. As a result, the town has since had a Mexica majority population and the indigenous language of preference here is Nahuatl, not Huastec. Not that tourists need worry about it, since everyone speaks Spanish as their primary language.
The town is at the confluence of the Rio Moctezuma and Rio Amajac. The rivers continue towards the Gulf of Mexico as the Rio Amajac.
Americans and Canadians who struggle with Meso-american location names can easily pronounce this one almost perfectly by calling it "Thomas-n-Charley".
