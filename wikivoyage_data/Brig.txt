Town centre
Brig (French: Brigue, Italian: Briga), officially Brig-Glis, is a municipality of 13,000 people (2018) in Valais in Switzerland. The municipality is made up of two neighbouring towns, Brig and Glis, with a third independent town Naters across the Rhone river to the north. It is a regional centre and a border town of sorts. It does not lie on the Italian border, but is the last stop for trains before going through the Simplon tunnel. The Simplon Tunnel opened in 1906 was the longest railway tunnel in the world until the late 1980s and continues to form part of an important north-south link across the Alps.


Understand[edit]
Mariä Himmelfahrt church
Brig used to be the most important transport hub in the region, as the old Lötschberg line from Berne, the Simplon line from Domodossola and Milan, the InterRegio trains from Lausanne as well as the Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn towards Andermatt and Zermatt all converge here. Since the opening of the new Lötschberg base tunnel, a lot of this has been diverted to Visp, making Brig quieter than it used to be. Nevertheless it remains an important town, and all international trains (EC) still stop here as the last stop before Italy, and not in Visp.

Get around[edit]
While there are some buses with stops around town the city centre is quite small and nice to walk through. Parts of it are pedestrian only and all the main sights are within walking distance.

It's run as a social project and is free for the first four hours. Be sure to check the website first as opening hours frequently change.
