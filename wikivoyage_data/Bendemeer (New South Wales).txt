Bendemeer is a hamlet (population 492 in 2016) in the New England region of New South Wales in Australia.


Understand[edit]
The MacDonald River and the Bendemeer Hotel
The indigenous Kamilaroi people were the original inhabitants of the district. The first European settlement was a sheep farm established in 1834. By 1851 a settlment named MacDonald River had been founded around the farmhouse.  In 1854 the settlement was renamed Bendemeer after a line in the poem 'Lallah-Rookh' by the Irish writer and poet Thomas Moore. In 1864 the bushranger Captain Thunderbolt (Fred Ward) committed one of his first robberies here, holding up the northern mail coach. Bendemeer is principally a hub for the local sheep and cattle farmers. 
Bendemeer is in the Tamworth Regional Council Local Government Area.
