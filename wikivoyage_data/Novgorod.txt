The Millennium Monument
Novgorod (Russian: Великий Новгород Velikii Novgorod) is one of the oldest cities in Russia. It was first mentioned in the manuscripts as early as 859.


Understand[edit]
The city of Novgorod the Great (Novgorod Veliky) is located between Moscow (530 km) and  Saint Petersburg (108 km). Its population is estimated at 230,000 people. Novgorod is inscribed on the World Heritage List. It is part of the Silver Ring of cultural and historical centers of the Northwest of Russia.

History[edit]
See also: Russian Empire
Novgorod was first mentioned in manuscripts as early as 859. Together with Kyiv, Novgorod was a very important cultural, social, and economical centre in Rus, and was the capital of one of the first European democracies, the Novgorod Republic, addressed publicly as "Lord Novgorod the Great". This independence came to be resented by the Muscovite autocrats; eventually Ivan the Terrible forced it into submission. It has ever since been a backwater kind of place.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Novgorod Airport is not operational. It was a busy airport during the time of the USSR. The planned replacement Krechevitsy Airport is also not open to civil aircraft.
Closest airport is Pulkovo Airport (LED IATA).

By train[edit]
The Railway Station
Russian Railways operates trains to the Novgorod-Na-Volhove train station from Saint Petersburg's Moskovskiy Vokzal station (3 hours, early morning and late evening, ~400 руб) and from Moscow's Leningradskii Vokzal station (8 hours, overnight, from 800 руб). The trains from Saint Petersburg are all seated and can be uncomfortable, although there is a lot of leg room. The overnight trains from Moscow feature soft berths and compartments for an additional charge.
