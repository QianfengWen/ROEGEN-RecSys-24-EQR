Goma is a tourist city that is the capital of Northern province of the Democratic Republic of Congo in the extreme east on the border with Rwanda.


Understand[edit]
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the town’s streets, particularly the town centre. Since then, Goma has been a city under constant construction. The town is worth a visit.  While Goma is reasonably safe, any visits outside of Goma should be researched to understand the state of the fighting that persists in the North Kivu province.  In particular any trips out of the city should be planned with caution.  The city is also the base to climb the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa.  It is also a good starting point to Kinshasa via Beni and Kisangani. Goma's climate is considered as tropical savanna climate

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]

By bus[edit]
From Kisoro, Uganda, you can take a minibus in Bunagana at the Uganda border. However, as of May 2015, the road between Bunagana and Rutshuru is not safe. Crossing the border called le petite barriere at Cyanika into Rwanda to reach Goma through Musanze (former called Ruhengeri) and Rubavu (former called Gisenyi) is a much safer and faster option.
From Rwanda there are hourly minibuses from Kigali to Goma, such as Atraco Express and Okapi Car. These will take approximately three and a half hours.
From Butembo you can find a bus in Butembo bus station. They may leave early in the morning.

By boat[edit]
There are daily ferries from Bukavu via Idjwi Island.  There are several companies that offer the 2-5 hour trip.  Prices vary from $10 to $40.

By foot[edit]
