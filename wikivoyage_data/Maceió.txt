Climate[edit]
Maceió's climate is tropical - hot and humid during most of the year. The best time to go depends on your weather preferences. Summer extends from December through March, when temperatures are around 30⁰C. In May through September more clouds make it more pleasant during the mid-day and afternoon.

By taxi[edit]
You can use an Uber or the 99Taxi riee-hailing app.
Other taxis are everywhere and you'll have no problem finding them. There is an initial fee, then it depends how far you go.

By bus[edit]
The bus system is operated by the company "Transporte Tropical," operating in the "Aeroporto - Ponta Verde" line, which connects the airport to Ponta Verde Beach. The price is R$ 3.35 (March 2021) for a single trip. There are no transfers though so each bus you take will require you to pay again. Around half of the local buses require the bus card "Cartão Bem Legal". In the near future all local buses will require the card. You can get it only in the Rua Buarque de Macedo 549 in the city center (M-F 07:00-17:00) and it's free. In March 2021 it was possible to get the card without a CPF.
In the regional minibuses you can pay only in cash.

By car[edit]
You can rent a car. This is a great way to explore the nearby beaches on a day trip.

Natural beauty[edit]
Approximately 140 km south from Maceió there is a very small town called Piaçabuçu, where you can get on a boat and sail through the São Francisco River and see where it meets the Atlantic Ocean. There are vans that can take you there or you can rent a car. The boat ride is absolutely amazing.

 São Gonçalo Belvedere (Mirante São Gonçalo), Praça Rosalvo Ribeiro (next to the São Gonçalo church and the lighthouse). From there, on a clear day, the old city, the harbor and the whole coastline, from Pajuçara up to Pontal da Barra, can be seen. 
Do[edit]
Surfing and bodyboarding are popular in Maceió. The waves are safe and there are no sharks to worry about. There are also no dangerous reefs to worry about. The best place to go surfing near Maceió is at Praia do Frances (Frenchman's Beach). Waves aren't the best in Alagoas; sometimes there are good waves, but that isn't very consistent. There are also many low priced resorts you can stay at for the weekend or for months at a time.
Watch the sunset from Avenida da Paz.
Snorkeling in Ponta Verde beach (with low tide). Bring your own snorkel, there are usually none for rent.
The main tourist attraction in Maceió is the Piscinas Naturais in Pajuçara beach, a naturally shallow area in the ocean about 1 km away from the shore. You can get there by jangada (a traditional wooden sailboat). This is a good place to snorkel and there are always restaurant boats selling food and drinks.
Concerts are very common.

Beaches[edit]
Ipioca Beach
Pajuçara Beach
Maceió is surrounded by beaches. There is no problem finding a nice beach to relax. You can choose between those with a lot of people or the empty ones.
To the beaches in the north of Maceio up to Ipioca you can take the bus line 223. It picks you up for example in Ponta Verde or Pajuçara. On the way you can pick a beach you like and simply get off at the next stop. The fare is R$3.35 (March 2021). For some buses of this bus line you need the Cartão Bem Legal. So it's better when you have the card. Without the bus card you can take a regional minibus from the country road AL-101 to the beaches. For the way back to Maceió you can also take any other local bus or regional mini bus. They stop in Maceió along the country road AL-101. From there you can change to another local bus line or take an Uber to where you stay.
