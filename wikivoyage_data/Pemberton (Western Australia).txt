Get around[edit]
See[edit]
-34.419959115.8685331 Beedelup Falls, Route 10, 10km west of Pemberton. Along with the falls, Beedelup National Park has some walks, including to the "Walk Through Tree", a large tree with a walkway through a central cavity, as well as a lake and resort. (updated Dec 2017)
Do[edit]
Mountain Biking
Hiking
Climb one of the three fire observation trees using rungs bored into the trunks - scary for some but great views from the top (note that these trees are within national parks and you need to have paid for entry):
-34.495332115.9750041 Dave Evans Bicentennial Tree, off Old Vasse Road (dirt road near Pemberton). Not one of the original lookout trees - it was built for the bicentenary on a tree roughly 200 years old - but it is the highest at 75m. The rungs are far apart, making it scarier, but there is a platform 25m up for a rest. (updated Dec 2017)
-34.447622116.0557092 Gloucester Tree, Burma Road (follow signs from central Pemberton). One of the original lookout trees and maybe the most popular, Gloucester is 53m tall and has close-set rungs so feels safer - even popular with kids and old people! (updated Dec 2017)
-34.320558116.120913 Diamond Tree, near corner of Eastbourne Road and South Western Highway, northeast of Pemberton. The third climbable tree and one of the original lookouts, but the shortest at 51 metres. (updated Dec 2017)
-34.442661116.0338854 Forrest encounters by tram, Railway Cr, ☏ +61 8 97761322, pemtram@wn.com.au. Departures at 10:45AM and 2PM everyday. Restored trams run through the Forrest, over bridges and past the river. One of the few trams still running in WA. The ride lasts almost 2 hours with commentary on the history and natural features of the area. The station where trams depart has many old steam and diesel train trains to keep the train buffs amused. Adult $24, Child $12.

Buy[edit]
Eat[edit]
Marron and trout are the local specialty and well worth paying the premium they command at the local eateries. A few places sell marron for you to take home. 

 Millhouse Cafe, 14 Brockman St, ☏ +61 8 9776 1122. Very popular with decent cafe style food with some regional specialties such as marron and trout. Nice indoor seating by the wood fire. People either rave or rant about the food and service. Prices are a bit high and the coffee is quite subpar. Service at can be a bit abrupt and hang on to your cups and plates as the wait staff will clear it away before you finished eating. 
 Crossings Bakery, 17 Brockman St, ☏ +61 8 9776 1411. A typical family run country bakehouse that does a roaring trade in their excellent pies and pasties. Get in early in the morning because they often sell out by 11am, earlier in peak times.
