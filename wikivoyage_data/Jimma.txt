A mosque in Jimma.
Jimma is a city in Western Ethiopia. Historically, it was a lively market town that attracted all of Ethiopia's diverse ethnic groups as well as people from neighboring kingdoms, buying coffee, perfume and other products. 


Understand[edit]
In 2022, Jimma was home to about 207,000 people. The three largest ethnic groups in Jimma are the Oromo (80%), the Amhara (17%) and the Dawro (1%); all other ethnic groups make up 2% of the population. Amharic and Afan Oromo are each spoken by a plurality of inhabitants. The most popular religion practiced in Jimma is Islam, followed by Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity and Protestantism.

History[edit]
What now lies in Jimma's northern suburbs was Jiren, the capital of a late 19th century Oromo kingdom. Formerly named Hirmata, the city during this period was a stopover market town on the trade route between the kingdoms of Shewa and Kaffa, and being only 10 km (6.2 mi) from the palace of King Abba Jifar I.
Jimma was an independent kingdom from 1790 to 1932. Soon after the death of King Abba Jifar II, Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie seized the opportunity to annex Jimma and absorb the kingdom into Ethiopia. 
The city as it is now was established in 1936 by the Italian Empire . At that time, with the goal of weakening the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the Italians tried to make Jimma an important center of Islamic learning, and founded an academy that taught fiqh (jurisprudence). During the East African theater of World War II, the Italian garrison at Jimma was one of the last to surrender to the combined Ethiopian, British and Belgian forces, holding out until July 1941.

Climate[edit]
Jimma has a 8-month long wet season from mid-March to mid-October. During the wet season, the city is very cloudy though still quite warm. Jimma is comfortable for most travellers at any time of year, with average highs peaking in February at 29°C and average lows dropping to 17°C in December. Having said that, to avoid the wet season the best time to visit Jimma is from November to February.
