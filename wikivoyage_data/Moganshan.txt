Moganshan View from Park Observation Deck
Moganshan is a mountain top tourist region near Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.  It is a good weekend retreat from Shanghai, as it is only a 2.5 to 3 hour drive south-west.  It is busiest in July and August, when the weather in the cities and valleys below is much hotter. It is also very nice in the shoulder periods when the cooler weather makes for more pleasant hiking. This contributor has also visited after heavy snowfall in February. The mountain sells half price tickets in the winter, since it is less popular to visit. You can either drive or hike to the summit along the foot paths through the bamboo. In winter it can be lonely and beautiful, well worth the effort.
