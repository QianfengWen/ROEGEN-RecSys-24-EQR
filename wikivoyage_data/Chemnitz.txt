Chemnitz is a city in southwestern Saxony, with around 250 000 inhabitants the third-largest city in the state, after Dresden and Leipzig. The settlement developed around a monastery, and was granted city status in 1170.  Due to its location at the foot of the Erzgebirge (literally ore mountains), in the 16th century Chemnitz began to grow in size an importance as a place of trade, and later as the base of industrial production.
The increase in Saxon coal mining during the 18th century allowed Chemnitz to develop into one of the most important centres of the German machine and textile industries - factors which gave it the nickname of "little Manchester". Several large areas of the city were built during this period including Kaßberg and Sonnenberg.  Due to the economic importance of Chemnitz it was a prime target for the Allied air force during World War II.  By 1945 the city had undergone near to total destruction.  Between 1953 and 1990 Chemnitz was renamed as Karl-Marx-Stadt (even though Marx had never visited nor had anything to do with the city's contemporary history).  A great deal of new building occurred during this period, much of which remains today.  The large bronze head was presented to the town's people in 1971.

Location of Chemnitz in Saxony

Understand[edit]
Chemnitz market square
Unlike Berlin and Leipzig, Chemnitz has experienced much less demolition and rebuilding since the reunification.  Modern buildings like the new department store, communist era flats and more historic buildings are within walking distance of each other.  Parts of Chemnitz allow a glimpse into how a city of East Germany felt and looked, something that is increasingly hard to find in other parts of the former East.
Even with this the centre of Chemnitz has been described as "Germany's most recent city centre". The initial commercial investment after reunification focussed on large out-of-town shopping centres, and it wasn't until 1999 that major building activity started in the city centre. Comparable only to Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, a whole new quarter of the city has been reconstructed. New buildings include the Kaufhof Department Store by Helmut Jahn, Galerie Roter Turm (façade by Hans Kollhoff) and Peek&Cloppenburg Clothing Store by Ingenhofen and Partner.

Get in[edit]

50.84015612.9305941 Chemnitz Hauptbahnhof. Chemnitz, as part of the Sachsen-Franken-Magistrale (train route connecting Saxony and Franconia), can be easily accessed by train from several of the other cities in Saxony but also from Bavaria and Thuringia. Chemnitz is one of the biggest cities in Germany to lack any InterCity or ICE service, in part because many routes through Chemnitz lack electrification - the route to Leipzig is not electrified at all, while the route to Nuremberg is only electrified as far as Hof.   
Leipzig (connections every hour, travelling time is about 50 minutes only)
Dresden and Zwickau (mostly 2 connections every hour)
Nuremberg (once every hour with a same platform change in Hof)
Erfurt, Weimar, Jena and Gera (every two hours)

Map of the Chemnitz tramway network
Get around[edit]
50°49′55″N 12°55′8″EMap of Chemnitz

Like many East German cities, Chemnitz has an expansive network of public transport comprising mainly of buses and trams.
There are six tram lines in operation in Chemnitz, numbered from 1 to 6, and the special line 522. Do note that there is no line number 3. All of the lines stop at the Zentralhaltestelle, which is a collection of tram platforms on the corner of  Rathausstraße and Bahnhofstraße in the very centre of the city. Do note that only lines 2, 6 and 522 reach the Hauptbahnhof. Line 1 and Line 4 form a continuum - trams on line 1 become line 4 past the Straße der Nationen stop, and the other way around.
Hauptbahnhof's status as a terminus rather than a through station is temporary, pending the completion of the works on the tracks passing through the station.
A map of the tram/bus network can be obtained from the tourist information office, found near to the main square in the city centre, or at this link.
