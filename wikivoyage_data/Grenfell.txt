Grenfell is a town of 1,996 in the Central West region of New South Wales.


Understand[edit]
The town was built as a service town during the gold rush in the 1800s.  
It was the birthplace of Henry Lawson, who was a prolific and famous Australian poet.  However, he left while still a baby, and never wrote much about the town. The single poem, "Said Grenfell to my spirit", is never-the-less quaint.  You'll have no shortage of places to read the entire poem when you get there, especially during the Henry Lawson Festival, when you'll hear it recited.

Get in[edit]
