Ghent (Dutch: Gent, French: Gand) is a city in East Flanders in Belgium. Ghent is a city with a population of 265,000 in 2020, with rich history. During the Middle Ages, Ghent was one of the richest and most powerful cities in Europe. The impact of this rich past can be clearly seen when viewing the imposing architecture of churches and the houses of rich traders. The city centre is restored, and breathes the atmosphere of a thriving late-medieval city state. It is free of cars, so it is a very welcoming and open area. 


Understand[edit]
Ghent at night
Ghent was once considered the second largest city north of the Alps, after Paris. It has a relatively high proportion of young people, and a significant seasonal student population.  Unlike Leuven, another university town in Flanders, youth is not the only category of people living there. There is an interesting mixture of foreigners who came to live there, professionals working for major international firms, and artists among the people of Ghent. This mixture makes the people more tolerant and open-minded. This atmosphere seeps into every aspect of city life, making the city different from the smaller provincial cities or the bigger city of Antwerp.

Get in[edit]
Gent Sint-Pieters
By train[edit]
Ghent is a 30-minute train ride away from Brussels and is on the line from Brussels to Bruges and the coast. If you're planning to visit Bruges and Brussels, definitely stop over in Ghent as well. There are also direct trains to Brussels Airport (BRU IATA), Antwerp, and Lille.
There are two train stations in Ghent, 51.0563.74071 Gent-Dampoort.  and 51.03553.71072 Gent-Sint-Pieters.   . Gent-Sint-Pieters is the main station, to go to the centre, take tram  1  (until 51.054543.721983 Korenmarkt. ). Journey time is ten minutes. Gent-Dampoort is closer to the center (about 15 minutes walk), but only trains coming from the direction of Antwerp stop there.
If you're visiting from Bruges, Brussels or Antwerp during the weekend, it's much cheaper to get a return ticket (special rate: weekend return).
Trip planning and ticket purchase can be done on the SNCB website[dead link] or the SNCB app.

On foot[edit]
The centre of Ghent is quite small, so you can walk around on foot. However, the main station (Gent Sint-Pieters) is not in the city centre, but takes a walk of about half an hour. The best option is to take the tram, which takes you directly to the centre in 10 to 15 minutes.

Bicycles are the preferred mode of transportation around Ghent
By bicycle[edit]
A bicycle is the recommended way to get around in Ghent. However, there are many roads with cobblestones that make cycling a shaking experience. Also make sure you stay clear of the tram rails. Nevertheless, you will see you are not alone on your bike: many inhabitants use bikes to get around. Even the former mayor uses his bicycle all day. There are many bike stands around to make it easy to lock your bike (important!) Many one-way roads are made two-way for bikes.

By public transportation[edit]
The transport system is Ghent is excellent and usually on time.  The transportation company is De Lijn[dead link], whose website is available in English. A single ticket costs €2.50 if bought in the bus or tram (contactless only from white card reader) or from ticket machines near stops. Such a ticket is valid for an hour's travel on all trams and buses.  If you are planning to stay for a while, either buy a three day pass for €15 or 10 trips for €17 — they are valid for within the city and can also be used throughout Flanders (e.g. Antwerp or Bruges). The trams are the quickest and most comfortable way to travel, especially from the railway station to the city centre. There are 3 tram lines  1 , 2  &  4 .
There is a De Lijn app available for Android or IOS smartphones which offer journey planning, real time travel info and ticket purchase in English. 
Tickets purchased on a card should be validated on the reader (not the white one) when entering the bus/tram while tickets purchased on the website or app should be validated before entering the vehicle. With a few exceptions, the tickets are usable throughout Flanders.

The mystery of the Just Judges
Ghent was deeply shocked in 1934 when 2 panels of Jan and Hubert van Eyck's famous The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb were stolen from St. Bavo's Cathedral, an event known as "the bold theft" as stealing religious inventory was unheard of at the time. The culprit demanded ransom from the diocese of Ghent, and returned one of the panels to support their claim. The diocese refused to pay, but at this point the theft had become infamous enough to make a sale or auction of the other panel, called The Just Judges, impossible. A search operation of unseen proportions was initiated stretching well beyond Belgium's borders, but to no avail. The only clues were given by Arsène Goedertier, who confessed on his death bed that only he knew where the missing panel was stored, and that "no one can recover it without drawing considerable attention from the public". Detectives found letters to the diocese in his office, linking him to the crime, but he died before he could reveal the location of the panel. The confession sparked a treasure hunt which continues until today, as the panel remains missing. Numerous professional and amateur detectives are on the case, and every few years one of them comes out with a theory credible enough to justify excavations. Churches and chapels in Antwerp, Tervuren, and many other places have been searched and have even had walls broken out in the hope of recovering the lost panel, but all efforts have been unsuccessful. There are even rumours that the SS exhumed Arsène's body from his grave during the Second World War hoping to find more clues. Some think the panel has been lost in time, but many others firmly believe it still exists, and it could very well be hidden in Ghent! If you choose to participate in the treasure hunt during your visit to the city, who knows? Perhaps you could find it.

It is one of the largest of its kind in Europe, attracting about 2 million visitors every year.

Young up-and-coming bands and arises get their chance in the intimate "mirror tent" in that same parc. The Beverhoutplein is taken over by French chanson. The roots of the festival are at the Sint-Jacobs square, where you can find Belgian and world artists, blues and rock music. Last-but-not-least in this non-exhaustive list is Vlasmarkt, where the party literally (i.e. not figuratively) never ends. It defies description and comparison and needs to be experienced to be understood. And for once these are not idle words. Party until long after the sun comes up and get a botram me uufflakke or sjoko (a sandwich with meat or chocolate paste). Besides this musical programme, the city's cultural houses and organisations open their doors. There are theatre and comedy shows, puppetry and workshops for kids and adults alike, exhibitions, guided tours and many random street acts such as mimickers, buskers, etc. Additionally a number of festivals within the festival are held, like Ghent Jazz for jazz music, 10 Days Off for electronic music and Boomtown for the most traditional music festival atmosphere, all three consistently having an impressive and international line-up. The festival starts on the Friday before July 21 (Belgium's national holiday) and lasts ten days. All of this: mostly free!.

Eat[edit]
Ghent provides an excellent and affordable sample of Flemish cuisine, which in the eyes of the locals is one of Europe's finest as it combines French delicacy with northern European sturdiness. Try some local specialties like mussels, spare ribs or 'stoverij' (a kind of tender meat cooked for three hours in dark beer with a brown gravy) with Belgian fries.
Another dish from Ghent is the "Gentse waterzooi" (litt. "boiled water from Ghent"), which was the food for the poor originally, a stew of cheap fish (usually turbot) and vegetables. Now it is often made with chicken as well.
Belgian waffles are available from a number of street stalls around the town.
The restaurants on Korenmarkt and Vrijdagmarkt are a good deal, reasonably priced; the menus and 'menus of the day' at the Brasserie Borluut provide terrific value and this includes Gentse waterzooi.
The real upmarket restaurants are to be found in the 14th-century quarter called 'Patershol', near the Castle. There is also a big Turkish community in Ghent, centred around Sleepstraat a bit further north, which is home to numerous Turkish restaurants.

For authentic pubs, go to St. Veerleplein (the square in front of the Castle), the pubs around St. Jacob's church (especially during weekends), or the student area around Blandijnberg (Mount Blandin), especially in the proximity of the School of Arts and Philosophy, recognisable from afar by the 64-m-tall art deco Library Tower. Ghent is known for its many pubs and clubs and most have friendly staff. If you visit Ghent for its great nightlife, be sure to check out the bars listed in the "Off the beaten path" section.

Central Area: Castle-Korenmarkt-Graslei[edit]
Graslei
51.0563833.7223821 Waterhuis aan de bierkant (The Waterhouse on the beerside), Groentenmarkt 9 (near the Castle), ☏ +32 9 225 06 80, waterhuis.aan.de.bierkant@skynet.be. Boasts about 400 different kinds of Belgian beer, but is fairly touristy. 
51.0560313.7220332 Het Galgenhuis (the Gallows house) (near Waterhuis aan de bierkant). A tiny tavern in a lean-to built on to the Gothic Butchers' Hall. A good selection of draught and bottled beers.

51.0583653.723874 Het Velootje (The Little Bike), Kalversteeg 2 (between the Castle and Vrijdagmarkt). Considered as the only tourist trap of Ghent, but even with this negative reputation it's worth a visit. The bearded owner Lieven calls his place a museum café with an authentic atmosphere by candlelight. This is all true but forgot to mention his collection of 200 antique bikes decorating the place. Drink prices are steep. everything costs €4.50.

Student area[edit]
Overpoortstraat is a street packed with 34 pubs and bars where during the week (especially Wednesday and Thursday nights) all the students go crazy. Because on Thursday it is so crowded over there, dancing usually happens on the tables. Some notorious bars/clubs are Decadance (house, techno, drum&bass), Boom Boom (rock'n roll), Den Drummer (rock and metal), Twieoo (often new wave and holebi parties), Cuba Libre[dead link](also known as the Puta Libre) (commercial, R&B, etc.), The Frontline underground concert venue featuring mainly metal, punk and hardcore concerts.

Off the beaten path[edit]
Want to try some bars you won't find in any tourist guide? This is a great selection:

51.0533.73809310 Het Gouden Hoofd (The Golden Head), Slachthuisstraat 96. If you find yourself on the other side of the canal, in the area known as "De Visserij", hungry and/or thirsty, be sure to check out this great place. It has moved to a former slaughterhouse. They have great dishes and the local beer on tap, Gulden Draak, is also great. 
This is not the only great place in De Visserij. Check out the cosy De Kleine Kunst and jolly Fabula Rasa along the canal at the Ferdinand Lousbergkaai. Drinks and food are generally quite cheap in this area.

51.0543723.71651211 Hotsy Totsy, Hoogstraat 1. Not far from the Graslei you can find this pearl. In a roaring twenties style this place breathes jazz. It's a good alternative for the sometimes crowded Hot Club De Gand. Prices are average to expensive, but the atmosphere is one of a kind. 
51.0555343.72323112 Old Fashioned, Hoogpoort 1. Ghent doesn't have a lack of bars, but finding a good cocktail bar might be tough. You might be glad with some other cocktail bars near the centre that have fruity drinks with cheap alcohol and not a drop of fresh juice, but some local connoisseurs consider Old Fashioned to be the only "Cocktail & Absinth bar" that is worth its name. They serve all the classics in a beautiful Medieval decor. 
51.0508693.7023613 De Spinnekop, Einde were 44 (nearest bus stop across across main road on next parallel street Beneluxpleinn #38, 39). M-Th 18:00-. If you have found this bar on your own you must have been really lost. The name of the street means "End of the world", and it feels like it. This was Ghent's best kept secret and has existed for many years, but now it's in the open. This bar is what people in Ghent call a "brown bar". It's a bit quirky but the owners are very friendly. The food is simple although the home made pesto pasta is amazing. Really cheap as well. It has the widely known beer, La Chouffe, on tap for around €3, food is €13 max and has great vegetarian alternatives. 90% chance that you will hear Bob Dylan or Tom Waits. In the summer you can sit outside in the garden. Food served till 22:00, F-Su closed. (updated Jun 2023)
51.0657043.73192114 Dok Brewing Co., Hal 16, Dok Noord (bus# 5&8 Dok Noord (shortcut down Denise de Weerdt), Heilig-Kerst  4 + 5 mins walk.). Tu-Su 11-23. Large out of town micro-brewery with food, located in a former transformer hall in the old dock area. Lots of outdoor seating. Very large selection of beers. (updated Jul 2023)

Go next[edit]
The Belgian train system is very efficient and the country not that large, so getting between major cities by rail is easy – in the day. A day trip to even multiple cities is easily doable. From Ghent, multiple railway lines radiates to major destinations in Flanders:

Bruges, famous for its canals and medieval heritage as well, is 20 minutes by train from Ghent
In the opposite direction, the often-overlooked town of Sint-Niklaas, with Belgium's largest market square, is also 20 minutes away
Just across the Dutch border, the very well-preserved historic fortified city Hulst attracts lots of day-trippers from Belgium. It was once part of Flanders, and its main street and city entrance gate still refer to Ghent.
Kortrijk, a charming and historically important provincial city in West Flanders is 30 minutes away
Antwerp, Brussels, Mechelen and the seaside resort of Ostend are around 40 minutes away
All the major cities in Wallonia are within 1.5 hours of train ride - either direct or with a quick change in Brussels
The French city of Lille is an hour away by direct train
Sint-Martens-Latem is very near and offers a great half-day trip to those who are interested in arts.
