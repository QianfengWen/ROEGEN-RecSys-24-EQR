The Atlantic City Boardwalk
The entertainment capital of the Eastern Seaboard, Atlantic City is New Jersey's most popular resort destination. Its streets are familiar to anyone who's ever played Monopoly (the American version), but board game fans aren't the only ones who want to "take a walk on the Boardwalk". The city's beaches and the famous wood-plank walkway have attracted visitors for more than a century.
While many visitors come just for the casinos, which had revitalized Atlantic City in the late 1970s after decades of decline, if you never set foot on the beach it's fair to say you're missing the whole point. Atlantic City is more than just a gambler's haven; it's a legendary resort town like no other.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
From its founding, Atlantic City has always been about tourism. It was founded in the late 19th century as a resort destination after railroad companies built track between Absecon Island (on which the city exists today) and Philadelphia. In its early days, Atlantic City catered to urban workers from Philadelphia. The heyday for Atlantic City as a beach resort lasted through the first half of the 20th century, when it fell out of favor. Atlantic City was revived after a state-wide referendum in 1976 legalized casino gambling in the city, and casinos began popping up along the Boardwalk and in the Marina District in 1978.
In the 21st century, Atlantic City's casinos have fallen on hard times due to competition from other states. Pennsylvania legalized casino gambling in 2006; Maryland, New York and Delaware have also entered the fray. Atlantic City's annual casino revenue dropped by half, from $5.2 billion in 2006 to $2.86 billion by 2013. Four of the twelve Atlantic City casinos closed in 2014 (Atlantic Club, Showboat, Revel and Trump Plaza); the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort permanently closed on Labor Day 2016.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
39.4575-74.57721 Atlantic City International Airport (ACY  IATA) (about 9 miles to the west of Atlantic City along the Atlantic City Expressway), ☏ +1 609 645-7895. Atlantic City International Airport is a smaller airport primarily serviced by Spirit Airlines. It's poorly connected to major airports, since Spirit flights are generally bound for other tourist destinations in Florida and the Caribbean.   
Car rentals are available in the airport, as well as taxi service and passenger vans for larger groups. Bus service via NJTransit is also available with a connection through the Pleasantville Bus Terminal. 
For many travelers, it will make sense to fly into Philadelphia and drive the hour it takes to reach Atlantic City or take the train.
Philadelphia International Airport (PHL IATA) is located about 60 miles to the west of Atlantic City. It is significantly larger than Atlantic City International and has more flights. SEPTA offers Regional Rail service from the airport to 30th Street Station, where travelers can connect with NJ Transit service to Atlantic City (see below).

Private aviation[edit]
Atlantic City was once a popular destination for commercial airlines; however, years of financial distress resulted in many scheduled services becoming discontinued and/or canceled due to lower passenger totals. Today, less than 20% of total aircraft operations are for scheduled flights, though Atlantic City is still a popular hub for private jets and general aviation, especially from the Northeast.

By train[edit]
The Atlantic City Expressway, an east-west highway connecting Atlantic City with Philadelphia, which is 62 miles (100 km) to its northwest
NJTransit offers train service from Philadelphia's 30th Street Station to Atlantic, with several stops in New Jersey. One-way fare is $10, and the ride takes about an hour and a half. The train also has several stops along the way, including Cherry Hill, Lindenwold (with connections to PATCO Speedline), Atco, Hammonton, Egg Harbor City, and Absecon.
On
The 39.3635-74.4422 Atlantic City Rail Terminal  in Atlantic City offers free Jitney shuttles for rail patrons to area casinos. Taxi service is available, and within two blocks is the Atlantic City Bus Terminal.
If you are coming from New York City, you can take the Northeast Corridor Line from Penn Station, New York to Trenton. Transfer to the RiverLINE light rail to Walter Rand Transportation Center for the PATCO train to Lindenwold. From there, take the Atlantic City Rail Line. This costs about $24 each way.

By car[edit]
Atlantic City Expressway exit for Atlantic City
North Carolina Avenue
Atlantic City is well-connected to a number of major highways.
The Atlantic City Expressway ($3.75 toll) connects Philadelphia and South Jersey and deposits right into the center of town as well as to the Marina district and Brigantine.
The Garden State Parkway (toll) intersects the Expressway about 10 miles away from Atlantic City. It connects New York City and Cape May. A slower (toll-free) alternative is US Highway 9.
Be aware if driving into Atlantic City that parking can be quite expensive, especially if you are staying at one of the casino hotels and parking in the hotel garage.

By bus[edit]
Greyhound now offers scheduled service from Washington, DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York directly to many of the Atlantic City casinos, and to the Atlantic City Bus Terminal. Round-trip fares are typically between $20–40, depending on the city and destination. Greyhound's website lists the routes and schedules offered, as well as the various free play offers for bus passengers.
Many charter bus operators will offer Atlantic City trips originating from other parts of New Jersey, Eastern Pennsylvania, and Southern New York. Many trips will come with casino chips and/or food vouchers for patrons. These routes are popular with senior citizens.
New Jersey Transit provides comfortable motorcoach transportation from New York City (Port Authority Bus Terminal) and many points within New Jersey to the Atlantic City Bus Terminal.  Check the NJ Transit website for fare and schedule information.
There are also buses from Manhattan's Chinatown to Atlantic City.

Get around[edit]

The Atlantic City Boardwalk
The most popular way to get around Atlantic City is on the 4-mile (6.4 km) long Boardwalk (the oldest in the United States), as most of the operating casinos are on the Boardwalk. While one's feet are the most popular way of navigating the boards, there are also old-fashioned rolling chairs that can be hired. These shaded surreys are rolled up and down the length of the Boardwalk by experienced guides, who are out soliciting riders day and night. The fee is based on the distance traveled, but expect a minimum fare of $5 plus tip.
Bikes can be rented as well, with the Boardwalk being the favorite spot to ride. Bikes are only allowed on the Boardwalk from 6:30AM to 10AM during the summer months, so be sure to get up early. Bikes of all sorts can be rented (single, tandem). One bike rental location is B & K Bike Rental at N Carolina Ave and the Boardwalk.
Taxicabs are plentiful throughout the city. The easiest way to get a cab is to call a local service, go to a taxi queue outside of any casino, or visit drop-off points at the Atlantic City Convention Center. The maximum cost for a taxi ride within city limits for up to five passengers is $13, not including tip.
One can also travel between the casinos along Pacific Avenue, which runs parallel to the Boardwalk 1 block inland, aboard the Atlantic City Jitney ☏ +1 609 344-8642, a fleet of minibuses that run 24 hours a day; the fare is $2.25. The Jitneys also run to the Marina section of the city, where the Golden Nugget, Borgata, Water Club, and Harrah's casinos are located.

Stay safe[edit]
Atlantic City has many high rise condominiums and other major hotels along the Boardwalk and Marina Districts. The Atlantic City Police Department patrols the Boardwalk via bicycle and ATV details. Like any other major city, it is always wise to be aware of your surroundings in this heavily visited tourism district. Many areas away from the casinos are significantly less safe; as of 2012, Atlantic City has the second-highest violent crime rate in the state.
Like many cities that attract money and gambling, Atlantic City has a significant population of homeless beggars. The homeless aren't aggressive and are usually found asking for change on the Boardwalk. Simply say "no" or ignore them. They'll usually move onto the next person.
The casinos themselves are very well-policed and if you run into problems, simply ask security for assistance. Be careful with your winnings! There's always a chance that pick pockets are waiting for an opportunity to cause trouble. If you're lucky enough to win at the slots, but feel uncomfortable carrying large sums of cash to your car or hotel room, ask the casino for either an escort or to receive your winnings via check.
