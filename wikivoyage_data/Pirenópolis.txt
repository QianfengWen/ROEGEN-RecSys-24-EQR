Pirenópolis (often misspelled Pirinópolis) is a historic city in the state of Goiás, Brazil.


Understand[edit]
Pirenópolis, like other historic cities in 18th-century Goiás, was founded by Bandeirantes from Minas Gerais, São Paulo, and Portugal. Exploration for gold in the Serra dos Pirineus region began in 1728, one year after exploration began around the city of Goiás. Soon, Manoel Rodrigues Tomás, associated with Bandeirate Bartolomeu Bueno da Silva (Anhanguera), founded some mines he called the Minas de Nossa Senhora do Rosário de Meia-Ponte. With the production of gold, Pirenópolis became an important urban center, well known for its cotton production as well. It was the first center for goiana music, and had Goiana's most important newspaper during the 19th century.
When the gold ran out at the end of the 19th century, the city's population began to shrink. Many moved to the new capital at Goiânia, or to cities in the south of the state, like Jataí, Rio Verde, Itumbiara, and Catalão. With the construction of nearby Brasilia in 1960, the city again began to grow, and the government decided to turn the city into a tourist destination, preserving many old buildings and the historic center.

It was built by African slaves in 1728 with funds gained through gold mining. In September 2002, it was partially destroyed by a fire. It has since been restored but the altar was lost. Another church, the Matriz dos Pretos, had fallen into ruins and nothing remained but the altar, so the church-less altar was united with the altar-less church here in 2005.
