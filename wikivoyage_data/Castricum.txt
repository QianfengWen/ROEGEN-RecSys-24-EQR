Castricum is a town and municipality in the province of North Holland in the Netherlands, located along the North Sea.


Understand[edit]
Castricum is first mentioned in a 10th century document, but archaeological digs have proven that the area was already settled in Roman times. Over time, smaller settlements popped up around the town of Castricum, with Castricum being the central hub for these hamlets, which would not much later be swallowed by Castricum's growth. Of these hamlets, only Bakkum, located to the north, survived. It is connected to Castricum, and has since grown into a proper town.
Castricum was a battleground of the War of the Second Coalition, between 1798 and 1802, having the British and Russians one the one, and the Dutch and French on the other side of town. The Battle of Castricum took place on October 6th, 1799, which stopped the British and Russian troops from progressing further into Dutch land.
Castricum boomed in growth in the twentieth century, when it was to dampen the growth of the Randstad. Nowadays the municipality of Castricum houses 35,300 people, and thrives mostly off of tourism, due to its seaside location.
