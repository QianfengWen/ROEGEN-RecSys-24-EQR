Blaenau Ffestiniog is a small town in the Snowdonia Mountains in Wales. Blaenau Ffestiniog is a former slate-mining village and consists of one main road with all the others leading off it.


Understand[edit]
A narrow-gauge railway, the Ffestiniog Railway, was built from Blaenau Ffestiniog to take the slate down to the sea at Porthmadog. The railway ceased operation after some 110 years of operation due to the run down of the slate industry, road competition, and the Second World War. It was fully reopened to Blaenau Ffestiniog in 1982 and is one of the town's main tourist attractions.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The best option to get to the town is by car - mostly because there aren't that many buses or trains to get around. The town is on the A470 from Llandudno to Dolgellau and the A487 from Porthmadog.  There are no fuel stations in the town, so fill up your tank well before you get there.  There is a Shell station near Betws y Coed on the A5 (11 miles from Blaenau).  Other options are at Porthmadog.

By bus[edit]
There aren't that many buses to Blaenau. X1/84 run from Llandudno and Betws-y-Coed, every 1-2 hours on workdays. There are also buses to Porthmadog (1B - approximately every 70 minutes) and Dolgellau.

By train[edit]
The Conwy Valley Line runs from Llandudno to Blaenau, but only has a train every 3 hours or so. The main 52.9946-3.9383811 railway station  is also the terminus for the narrow-gauge heritage Ffestiniog Railway from Porthmadog. On some summer days it has more frequent departures than the "real" railway.

Get around[edit]
Map of Blaenau Ffestiniog
As the town is quite small you can easily get around on foot and the town has undergone a face lift to help attract visitors to what was the 'Slate Capital of the World' in its hey-day. The Llechwedd Slate Caverns, which celebrate the town's famous history, are a mile's walk from the station on the road to Dolwyddelan over the Crimea Pass - or go by car. As all the main roads in and out of town are very narrow main roads with quite fast traffic, so the bicycle isn't a good idea - and for mountain biking other towns in the area are better bases. Blaenau Ffestiniog is celebrated as the only town in North Wales where all roads lead into the Snowdonia National Park. At 850 ft above sea level, it makes the town an ideal base for exploring the park.

One of north Wales' premier tourist attractions, and with good reason. The Deep Mine tour involves some walking, including steps, and takes you down as far as 450 ft below the summit of the mountain. This tour starts with a ride on Britain's steepest passenger railway, dropping down several levels within the mine. There follows a walking tour through 10 of the huge "chambers" within the mine. There are a number of attractions and displays on the surface, including the Victorian Village which aims to paint a picture of daily life for local people in the mid 19th Century. Can get fully booked on busy days such as bank holiday weekends so worth booking in advance to avoid disappointment. Deep Mine Tour: Adults £20.00 per person Group discounts.   (updated Sep 2016)
