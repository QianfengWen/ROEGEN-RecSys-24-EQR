Delft is a mid-sized city in the west of the Netherlands. It's a beautiful, unspoiled town with traditional architecture, canals and bikes. It's also home to the world famous blue and white ceramics. Delft makes a great destination for a day-trip or can serve as a base to explore the region. And if the bustling crowds of Amsterdam are not really your thing, Delft is a lovely alternative, offering an equally interesting insight into the cultural wealth of old "Holland", on a far more intimate scale.

Understand[edit]
Delft is more than 750 years old. Its name is derived from the Dutch word 'delven' which means delve or digging. Delft's oldest canal is called The Old Delft (de Oude Delft). Delft expanded around it; later on many other city-canals were dug as life lines through the city. These grachten are still the pride of Delft.
In 1246 Delft received city rights, granted by Holland's Count William II. Delft grew prosperous and new neighbourhoods were added to the city. In 1355 it reached the size it would remain at until the 1900s.
In 1536 a great fire destroyed 2300 houses. The most likely cause was lightning striking the tower of The New Church. About 100 years later, in 1654, an explosion destroyed large parts of town; a warehouse with 36 000 kg of gunpowder blew up. A new warehouse (Kruithuis) was later built, outside the city perimeter.

Nieuwe KerkDelft has long been a centre of art and science. With the foundation of the Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (East India Company) in 1602, Delft also became a trading center. The VOC was at one time the largest trading company in the world, with a huge fleet and offices all over Asia. One of the Dutch offices was in Delft.
In 1842, the Royal Academy for Civil Engineering (Koninklijke Academie ter opleiding van Burgerlijke Ingenieurs) was founded. Now known as Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), it is Delft's biggest employer. About 13,000 students study in Delft.

From The Hague[edit]
Delft is a short tram ride from The Hague by tram. Tram  1  runs from Scheveningen, through the middle of The Hague and Den Haag HS to Delft. Travelling time is approximately 30 min from The Hague (Centrum) to Delft. From Scheveningen to Delft the journey takes 45 minutes.

You can take tram  19  from Leidschenhage to its end point at Delft's train station. From Leidschenhage to Delft it takes 40 minutes. Leidschenhage is on the route of trams  2  and  6 .

By car[edit]
Delft, between the A4 and A13 motorways, is easily reached by car. Both highways are easily accessible both from Amsterdam/Schiphol and from Rotterdam. Delft has three exits off the A13 motorway. The city centre is best reached via exit Delft (exit 9). During the weekend this exit can be busy with IKEA shoppers. Then take the North exit (exit 8), or the South exit (exit 10) to reach the University. From the A4 motorway, take exit 14. Then, go along the Kruithuisweg (N470), until the third stoplight.

By public transport[edit]
Local public transport in the town is a part of the public transport system of the Hague. As said, the historical centre of Delft is small enough to be explored on foot, but local public transport could be used to reach the Hague and come back. HTM travel cards are also valid here.
There are two frequent tram routes that run north of the city center, although there are several suburban/regional bus routes operated by EBS as well. These are better suited to travelling between towns not directly connected by rail.

By foot[edit]
Walking - the centre is small enough to walk across in ten minutes. Most streets in the city centre are pedestrianized. But do take care: taxis are allowed to use these streets. Especially at night they drive at inappropriate speeds. When walking through town make sure you leave room for traffic on bikes. The locals are zooming around going about on their daily business.The locals are usually aware of tourists looking up at the gables and are ready for unsuspended side steps, but do try to keep an eye on the traffic. A collision with a bike can ruin your whole day. Walking around without a top is considered uncouth.

By bicycle[edit]
The Netherlands is a perfect country for cycling. The land is flat, the views broad and cycle paths are everywhere. For the Dutch cycling is not only useful for the daily commute but also considered an excellent leisure activity. Inexperienced cyclists are few and far between. Cyclist are expected to ride their bikes in an assertive way. If you have a wobbly and uncertain trajectory, cars tend to overtake. This would make the cycling experience a harrowing experience. But realize that even if you have right of way, a car is still a lot harder than you.
Inside the Delft canal streets, most locals will mount the pavement shortly to let cars past on the canals where possible. This is just courteous because the next time when you are driving the car you hope to be let through as well.
At the train station in Delft you can rent bicycles. To rent a bike you will need a valid ID and a deposit (€50 for a simple bike or €145 for a tandem). The rental fee for a normal bike with a back-pedal brake will be €7.50 per day. (including insurance cover for theft). Often it is possible to rent a bike with gears or one with electric assistance. Especially if you are with a group it is best to reserve the bikes per telephone (015-2143033) beforehand. (Please) Make sure you understand the traffic rules before you set off.

By car[edit]
In brief, getting around by car in Delft is, similar to many other Dutch cities, discouraged through spatial planning and parking fares. The old city has been made largely car-free, but there are three large car parks at the edge of the city centre (Parkeergarage Zuidpoort, Markt and Phoenix). These car parks are expensive, but parking on the few public parking spaces on the streets in or near the city center can be even more expensive. The parking policy differs per area and is not always clear. Beware of the signs "alleen vergunninghouders" (permit holders only) in some streets in the vicinity of the city center, especially in residential areas. Sometimes only a floor tile with a "P" is visible. This means Permit parking. Many tourist assume "P" means parking and end up with a parking fine. Parking is energetically policed. Unauthorized parking will cost you about €70. A 10-minute walk from the centre parking for free can be found at the Nijverheidsplein. The University area will have space in the weekends.
Traffic rules on priority consider the vulnerability of the mode of transport. This means a car has to give way to a bike to avoid a collision. Even a bike travelling the wrong way up a one-way street, without lights, driven by someone clearly over the limit colliding with a car will put that car driver at fault. Because of the risk to the cyclist, the car should have done everything to avoid the collision, or he is at fault.
Be sure to check the mirrors before you make a right turn. There is a good chance a cyclist is between you and the pavement.

Oude Kerk towering over the city
52.0125524.35556410 Oude Kerk (Old Church), Heilige Geestkerkhof 25, ☏ +31 15 212-3015. Closed on Sundays. This is Delft's oldest church, built in 1246. The interior of this church is excellent. Famous Dutchmen are buried in this church, including: Piet Hein, Maerten Tromp and Johannes Vermeer. The Old Church leans out considerably over the Oude Delft canal. When the tower was built the canal had to be moved away from the church as the tower would have been half in the water. During the building works it became apparent that canal-half of the base soil was not firm enough to support the tower. To compensate for the tilt the upper part of the tower was built with a compensating counter curve. See New Church, since it's one ticket for both, but only the New Church tower may be climbed.

The national and international stores like C&A, H&M and McDonald's concentrate on the southern part of the city, while the more alternative small stores and gift shops can be found more to the north. Apart from some supermarkets, shops are usually closed on Sundays and on Monday mornings.

Vrouwjuttenland: In this short street along a canal, near the New Church, alternative clothing and gift stores can be found. Pipe or cigar smokers should definitely visit "Van Renssen". The street also contains an organic/health food supermarket. On summer evenings, once a week there are performances of musical artists, performing from a boat on the canal. Check the health food supermarket for the exact dates.
Choorstraat: Just around the corner from the Vrouwjuttenland, the Choorstraat can be found. This pleasant small street offers a variety of stores, like a drugstore selling all sorts of tea, an international gift store selling everything from tajines to Buddha statues, a chocolate store, a gameshop and a large book store with many international newspapers.
Hippolytusbuurt: At the end of the Choorstraat, until Wijnhaven is Hippolytusbuurt. This is one of the two major canals. It boasts the one of the oldest shops in the world. The Fish shop dates from 1342. The Tourist information point is here. A funny little sweets shop, two toy shops, two hairdressers, a Moroccan butcher with an excellent selection of olives and tapanades and two upmarket restaurants.
Bastiaansplein: The newest shopping area in town, consisting of a large supermarket (7 days a week open until 22:00) and several clothing stores. Tiles in the street light up at night.
Voldersgracht: For those who need good advice on tasteful alcoholic beverages, they definitely should visit the store Wines and Whisky's. Furthermore, the Voldersgracht holds a large record shop, which sells a wide range of LP's and CD's from all ages. The street also has a religious gift shop, the Bijbel-In.
Martinus Nijhofflaan: The "Hovenpassage" is a covered shopping area, 15 minutes of walking outside the city centre. The shops are smaller and less alternative, but it contains a wide variety of stores and a large supermarket, the "Jumbo". Another large supermarket, the Albert Heijn, is on the other side of the street.
Oude Delft: Wine shop "Van Dorp" is near the Old Church. The shop is in the vaulted basement of a monumental house. The atmosphere inside is cool and tranquil and worth a visit by itself. The shop has an extensive selection of wine in every price category. The customer service is highly personal and very friendly. Because the shop doesn't lend itself to much browsing the shopkeeper (a wine connoisseur himself) will try and find out what is to your liking and then recommend a suiting wine without pushing expensive wines. The venue can also be hired for wine tasting sessions. A visit here will cure you from supermarket wine forever.
Delftware[edit]
Delfts Blauw (Delft Blue) is a traditional Delft pottery. In the 18th century the city was famous for its porcelain. Around 1750, 32 earthenware factories were located in Delft.

view from canal cafe

The great beer history is alive and well again in Delft. Many bars feature an extensive beer menu, and one can try a beer from the local brewery (De Koperen Kat) or the historic brew 'Delftse Mueselare Bier'

Al fresco at one of the many bars around the market square, or on a floating terrace (apparently unique to Delft) on a canal.
"De Beestenmarkt"; around this square in the city centre are many pubs and bars. In the summer it is filled with people drinking a beer under the maple tree canopy.
Many students get a drink at their fraternity (extremely cheap). Mostly you need to be a member or be introduced.
Specific cafés[edit]

Bed and breakfast[edit]
There are several bed and breakfasts in Delft [11][dead link].

Holiday rental houses[edit]
There are several international websites offering canal houses for rent. Mostly these rentals need to be organised some time in advance. Because they are only slightly more expensive then a hotel room, they can work out to be cheaper for families with children who want their own room. Add the privacy and the facilities and they can be a very good alternative to a hotel or B&B. The three mayor websites competing are: [12], [13] and [14]

Long-term rentals[edit]
Most estate agents in the Netherlands are a working together. This means real estate for sale and rent are pooled on a website covering nearly everything on the market. The advantage is that one website has most properties. The disadvantages of a near monopoly are also obvious. Long term stay houses for expatiates and PhD students can be found here.

Camping[edit]
There are three campgrounds in Delft.

Camping Delfse Hout is located near a small artificial lake, suited for swimming. A camping spot for two persons, including a car costs between €19.50 and €24. Cabins (for three/four persons) are also available for €36. Cottages can be rented for €265 per week. Services include a restaurant, recreation room, supermarket, launderette, playground, table tennis, bike rent, swimming pool. This is not a quiet place. Korftlaan 5, tel: 015 2130040.

Religious services[edit]
There are several church services available also in English. Some of them offer partly English spoken services, others offer translations by a headset or written on paper (both handed over at the entrance). The list below is not complete, but gives an impression of the possibilities.

International Reformed Evangelical Fellowship[dead link] (Ecumenic service), Heilige Geestkerkhof 25. Su 12:00 (in English)

Go next[edit]
The beach at Scheveningen — Tramline 1 takes about 1 h and terminates right on the beach (the same trip by train is faster, you have to change in The Hague).
The Hague is a city worth a visit on its own (and it's on the way to Scheveningen). You can cycle to The Hague in 30 min. Start at the Oostsingel and follow the canal. It is well-sign-posted, and The Hague is visible as soon as you leave Delft.
Schipluiden is a very small town on the outskirts of Delft, with a large canal with beautiful bridges and colorful boats. It's a popular watering hole for cyclists. There are also kayak and paddleboat rentals (€6 for first hour, €2/hr after).
Schiedam is the next small city south along the train line. The small historic city centre is an undiscovered gem.
Hook of Holland has a quieter and cleaner beach than Scheveningen's, and it faces the Port of Rotterdam so is nice when you want to see the big seagoing ships: Great views. Cycling from Delft takes you past farms, sheep, and greenhouses. If you only want to cycle one way there is a train station at the Hook of Holland. You can take your bike on the train for about €7.50.
