Davis is a small town at the foot of the Arbuckle Mountains in the Chickasaw Country region of Oklahoma.


Get in[edit]
The main part of Davis is easily accessible from Interstate highway I-35 at Exit 55, to the east.
The city's boundaries are quite strange.  The city has owned the Turner Falls area for about a century, even though it's a couple of miles away from the main town.  As a result, the city boundaries encompass one large area southwest of the I-35/US-77 interchange and a smaller area around the intersection of US-77 with Oklahoma State Highway 7, plus the highways to the west and south of the old city to connect the two areas, and two miles of Crazy Horse Airport Road heading north.
