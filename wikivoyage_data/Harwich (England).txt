King's Head Street
Harwich, pronounced 'Harich' or 'Harridge', is a port town in Essex, East Anglia.
Harwich lies at the junction of two estuaries and the area forms one of the UK's major harbours (although most freight shipping operates from Felixstowe, a short distance over the water, rather than from Harwich). Ferries to northern Europe operate from adjacent Parkeston, while there are fast rail and road links to London.


Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
The conurbation of Harwich, Dovercourt and Parkeston is served by 3 train stations. The town is on the Mayflower Line (a branch of the Great Eastern mainline), which is operated by Greater Anglia.

51.9471.2551 Harwich International, Parkeston Quay, Harwich, CO12 4SR. Largest of Harwich stations. Serves port and Parkstone area.   (updated May 2017)
51.9441.2872 Harwich Town, George St, Harwich, CO12 3NA (5 minutes walk from the Ha'penny pier).   (updated May 2017)

There's an hourly local service between Harwich Town and Manningtree, calling at all stations. As of May 2011, a few services run to London Liverpool Street. If you are heading north to Ipswich or Norwich, change at Manningtree, cross the tracks via the underpass to Platform 3 and there's often a connecting service waiting on platform 3. From Harwich International (which is part of the Ferry Terminal), there is also the DutchFlyer train, which carries arriving and departing Stena Line passengers between the terminal and London Liverpool Street Main Line station. This train is usually more spacious (12 carriages instead of the usual 4 ) and is much faster than the local trains. There is also a twice-daily service to and from Cambridge (via Ipswich) which connects with the Stena Line ferry sailings.

By car[edit]
The main route into Harwich is the A120 trunk road, which connects with the A12 at Colchester and the M11 near Stansted Airport. If coming from the Midlands along the A14, change to the A12 at Ipswich and then to the A120 at Colchester, or alternatively exit the A14 at Ipswich and take the A137 local road towards Manningtree and then take the B-roads towards Harwich - this way is more direct but slower as it uses narrow countryside roads.

By bus[edit]
Regional bus services terminate at Harwich Town Bus Station, opposite Harwich Town train station. There are two principal routes - services to Colchester run every 30 minutes and take about 1 hr 20 minures, and services to Clacton which run hourly and take just under 1 hour.

By boat[edit]
Most travellers arriving at Harwich will use the Harwich International Terminal at Parkeston Quay (approximately one mile west of the historic Harwich port area.

There are several ferry services per day to Hook of Holland in The Netherlands, taking around 8 hours each way. The ferry port is easily accessible from the A120 road if travelling by car, and Harwich International railway station is directly connected to the ferry terminal building. The DutchFlyer mixed-mode ticket at £50 one way allows travel from any National Express East Anglia rail station (including London Liverpool Street, Cambridge and Norwich) to any Dutch Railways (NS) station including the ferry from Harwich to the Hook of Holland.

The Treadwheel Crane is the strange contraption on St Helen's Green, 100 yards east of the lighthouse. It worked from 1667 in the Navy dockyard but was moved here in 1932. The crane was powered by men walking within two wheels, which are within the pantiled hut, only open by arrangement. The main design flaw is that it doesn't have a brake, so if the load started to gather momentum, general wreckage could ensue.
