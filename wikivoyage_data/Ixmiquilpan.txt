Ixmiquilpan is a town in central Hidalgo, Mexico. Set in the heart of Mexico's volcano belt, this picturesque riverfront colonial town is famous for its hot mineral springs. This is the weekend playground of Hidalgo. Dozens of spas and water parks in and around the town make it a popular family destination. 


Understand[edit]
Ixmiquilpan is a small city with a population of about 37,000 (2020 census). It was settled by the Hñahñus, a subculture of the Otomi indigenous people, along the banks of the Tula River. The Otomi would later be dominated by the Toltec and eventually the Aztec, but all of these peoples shared some common culture, and all spoke the Nahuatl language (and as much as a third of the town's population still do).  
Spanish invaders moved into the area and established Ixmiquilpan as a town in 1530. Augustinian monks settled in the area and established the Parroquia de San Miguel Arcángel in 1550 (though the church and monastery were big projects that wouldn't be completed until the early 1600's). The Chapel of Nuestra Señora del Carmen was built by Patricio Joseph Tovar between 1752 and 1772.

Plaza Juarez in Ixmiquilpan
20.48414-99.2189241 Plaza Juarez, Lib. al Cardonal 13, Centro. The town square with benches, sidewalks, fountains, and towering shade trees. The Town Hall (Palacio Municipal) faces one side of the park with two sides consisting of charming colonial era buildings with graceful arched porticos under which you'll find shady sidewalk cafes, ice cream shops, and shops selling souvenirs and local hand crafts. The plaza features a famous Diana sculpture. This is the original Diana sculpture from Paseo de la Reforma in Mexico City, but it caused a political scandal when it was first unveiled in the capital. Sadly, President Avila's wife, Soledad Orozco de Ávila Camacho, was an uncultured philistine who declared it "indecent" and forced the artist to re-cast the statue with a loincloth for modesty. The more classically inspired statue of the huntress now graces Ixmiquilpan. 
Historic murals in the church of San Miguel Arcangel
20.482753-99.2183882 Ex-Convento de San Miguel Arcángel (Church of St Michael the Archangel), Nicolás Romero 34, Centro, ☏ +52 772 110 0507. Augustinian church and monastery built in the 16th century and designed by Fray Andrés de Mata de Barrios. It's a spectacular church that embodies everything tourists love about Mexican churches of the viceregal era. This one stands out because of a series of murals that were originally painted by indigenous artists but were covered up for a couple hundred years until being re-discovered during a mid 20th century renovation. The murals mix Christian symbology with Mexica symbols, jaguar warriors, and fanciful creatures reminscent of the alebrijes that are part of Mexican popular art culture. Historians say that these murals were created by Otomi artists and chronicle Otomi battles against nomadic Chichimecas, who were hostile to the Spanish missionaries. The friars evidently didn't take to having their missions attacked and encouraged the Otomi to take care of the problem "their way", and so the friars rewarded the Otomi by letting them immortalize the story in murals on the church walls. 
20.479395-99.2155633 Capilla de Nuestra Señora del Carmen (Chapel of Our Lady of Carmen), Fco Javier Mina 8. Elaborate churrigueresque style church built in the 18th century. Stunning interior with gilded altars and many paintings of biblical scenes. 
20.478211-99.2222834 Museo de la Cultura Hñähñú, Av. Insurgentes No. 1, Centro (across the street from the bus station), ☏ +52 759 723 4408. M-F 10:00-19:00, Sa 10:00-14:00, closed Su. This place holds the world's record for most unpronouncable name. It's a small museum with 5 galleries showcasing the Hñähñú indigenous culture. Items include religious objects, everyday household items, artifacts that demonstrate the interrelationship of the people with their natural environment, rituals, calendars, and more. The museum includes a botanical garden with about 40 plants that are endemic to the Mezquital River Valley. (updated May 2023)

Extreme sports[edit]
20.388475-99.0273071 Xoxafi. Originally known for cave tours, it's expanded into an adventure park for extreme sports enthusiasts. There are different activities you can choose from or you can do a combined package. Activities include zip lines, various caving experiences (including one where you descend on ropes, and one that includes a subterranean zip line in near total darkness), and an activity they call "xoxobike" which is a totally unique adrenaline rush: it involves steel cables strung 50 meters over a deep canyon and you ride a bike across the cable -- it's scary but safe because the tires are replaced with channeled wheels that grip the bottom cable and you and the bike are secured to a pulley on the top cable. Not for the faint of heart. An on-site campground is available. M$220 and up. 
Water parks[edit]
Pool at Te-Pathe
Hot mineral springs provide 38 °C water that's perfect for relaxing the muscles. Spas have operated in the town for decades, but since 2000, they've been eclipsed in fame by large water parks that cater to families. Some of these have big water slides, lazy rivers for floating along in inner tubes, and big wave pools that mimic the feel of being at the beach. Most provide campgrounds. There are also cabins for rent nearby.

Caves[edit]

20.626761-98.9863265 Grutas de Tolantongo, ☏ +52 772 126 5156. Amazing caves full of unusual rock formations, stagmites, stalactites, and narrow passages, but the caves are almost eclipsed in beauty by the river area with its unworldly cyan blue water and its warm (but not hot) soothing temperatures, and a popular hot-spring fed swimming pool perched on a terrace embedded on the mountain side. There is camping and on-site restaurant and a picnic area with grills if you bring your own picnic lunch. M$150.
