By plane[edit]
The Asheville Regional Airport (AVL IATA) offers jet and commuter service on American, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines and has direct flights from Atlanta, Charlotte, Cincinnati, Detroit, Houston, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Newark, NJ, and Orlando. It is located fifteen miles south of downtown Asheville near the town of Fletcher. Ground transportation and major rental car companies are available at the airport terminal.
Flights into Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport (GSP IATA) located in Greenville, South Carolina, Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT) located in Charlotte, North Carolina, or McGhee Tyson Airport (TYS) located in Knoxville, Tennessee, are sometimes cheaper than flying directly to Asheville.  Greenville is about a 1½-hour drive, Charlotte and Knoxville are both about 2-hour drives.

Like most of Western North Carolina, you do need a car to get to and from Weaverville.  Once on Main Street, it's an easy walk to much of the shopping, restaurants, and accommodations in the area.  Limited bus service to and from Asheville is also available.
