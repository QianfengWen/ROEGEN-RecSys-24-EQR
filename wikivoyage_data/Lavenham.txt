Lavenham, is a village in the south-west corner of Suffolk. It is one of the finest examples of a medieval wool town. Most of the houses were built between 1450 and 1500 and are in a remarkable state of preservation. Walking through Lavenham is like walking through a movie set: the half-timbered houses and pastel coloured cottages lean against one another in street after street. 


Understand[edit]
St Peter & St Paul Church
Several of the buildings, including the Guildhall, are open to the public and contain displays of life in a mediaeval English wool town.
Lavenham was the 14th wealthiest settlement in England in 1524, with 33 cloth making businesses and was richer than Lincoln and York, when the church was being rebuilt (1486-1515) and the Guildhall of Corpus Christi completed (1529). Lavenham's position as a manufacturing town of national importance is hard to imagine when you see the quiet, rural charm of the village today.
