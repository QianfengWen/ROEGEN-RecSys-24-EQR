Geiranger[dead link] and Hellesylt are villages in Møre og Romsdal. The Geirangerfjord is one of the most beautiful mainland fjords and one of the most popular tourist destinations in Norway. In a rating of UNESCO World Heritage Site, Geirangerfjord (along with Nærøyfjord in Sogn og Fjordane) obtained top score in a survey conducted by the prestigious National Geographic Magazine. A visit to Geiranger can be included in a trip along the Norwegian coast. The villages of Geiranger and Hellesylt sit at either end of the Geirangerfjord and Hellesylt is included in this article.

Geirangerfjord and Geiranger, from Flydalsjuvet 2016
Geiranger is the tiny village and rural community at the eastern end of Geirangerfjord. Hellesylt village sits at the western end of Geirangerfjord, and from there the fjord does a sharp turn north with the name Sunnylvsfjord. The latter fjord is in turn connected to the main fjord, aptly named Storfjord (large fjord), at the small town Stranda. Strictly speaking Geirangerfjord is merely the inner 15-kilometer section of the wider Storfjord system. Storfjord is about 100 km long and one of main fjord systems in Western Norway. While Geiranger and Hellesylt are small villages, Stranda is the municipal centre.
Several hundred cruise ships with some 300,000 passengers visit Geirangerfjord every summer, making Geiranger the 2nd biggest cruise port in Norway, only surpassed by Bergen. Many tourists also arrive by charter bus. In addition there is a large number of independent travellers. Geiranger is a small village of 200 people, but the influx of 5,000 or more tourists daily makes Geiranger a relatively crowded place at day time.
The Geirangerfjord is one of Norway's oldest destinations for international tourism. Cruise ship tourism began in the late 19th century. Kaiser Wilhelm visited Geiranger every summer until World War I. Road 63 between Åndalsnes and Geiranger via Valldal is one of Norway's 18 national tourist routes, these being the most scenic drives in Norway.

Geiranger self-propelled Seawalk on pontoons
Cruise ships make semi-regular visits to Geiranger in the Summer months (May-Late August). Cunard Cruises, Queen Elizabeth and other lines visit the Geiranger Fjords every summer.  The Geiranger Port has a cruise terminal, a Seawalk, and 3–4 anchor positions depending on the size of the ships.  Opened in 2013, the Seawalk is a self-propelled three-segment articulated floating pier, 236 m-long by 4.5 m-wide steel platform on 10 pontoons, which moves out to the ship (like a floatable jetwalk) to accommodate 4,000 passengers per hour disembarking from a single ship. With Geiranger a busy cruise port, you may have to take a short tender when there's more than one ship in port.  Hellesylt now offers a sizable pier for single ships, while local car ferries use a separate facility for both locations.
The sailing into the fjord is not to be missed as many cruisers wake up as early as 4am to witness the stunning beauty of this Norwegian fjord. Or enjoy the Geiranger sail away in the afternoon. Small towns and homes cling to the high cliffsides. Friendly Norwegians' can be seen doing their farmwork, milking cows, working in cliffside garden fields. Temperatures and weather can vary by the minute, it is best to wear warm clothing layers and bring your binoculars to see animals grazing on cliffsides, small Norwegian homes, and the beauty of this fjord. Check if your cruiseline visits the Geiranger Fjord, it is truly one of the best, most relaxing, awe-inspiring cruises that you will ever take.
Both towns are easily walkable and scenic, and each blessed is by a waterfall.

Get around[edit]
62°6′58″N 7°7′19″EMap of Geiranger
It's a lovely small Norwegian town that you must visit in the summer months.  Plenty of photo opportunities in and around Geiranger.

On foot[edit]
Adventurers take to the hills of Geiranger via walking and sometimes even biking. Winter closes most of the roads in the Geiranger fjord, so its best to visit in the summer. Watch out for campers, trucks, and tour buses, especially when biking, walking or hiking. Hills are steep and for more fit adventurers.

By boat[edit]

Geiranger's other great hairpin road, Ørnevegen, was completed in 1955. (updated Dec 2020)

This lake is usually hidden by over 9 m (30 feet) of snow in the wintertime in Norway. August 2012 while on a bus tour.
Walk around the lovely, hillside town. Main road wraps the coastline. Townsfolk are very friendly and engaging. Many different tour buses available in the summer, June-late August. Weather changes many times during the day: warm, windy, cool, freezing, and do not forget the sunscreen, especially when leaving Geiranger and visiting the Geiranger Valley and glaciers. You might need some bug spray for the mosquitoes and sunscreen is a must!
Sadly many Geiranger citizens talk about the glaciers retreating more and more each year.
