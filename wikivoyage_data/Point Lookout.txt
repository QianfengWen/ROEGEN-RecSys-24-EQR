Point Lookout Lighthouse
38.073552-76.3408731 Confederate Memorial Park. Sunrise-sunset. During the Civil War, General George McClellan's Peninsula Campaign failed to capture Richmond, and the Union Army built a hospital at Point Lookout to treat the injured soldiers. After the Battle of Gettysburg, the Union established a prisoner-of-war site at Point Lookout for captured prisoners. During its two-year existence, more than 50,000 prisoners were at the site. Only tents were provided to prisoners for shelter, which were insufficient, and 3,384 prisoners died. The prisoners were originally buried in two cemeteries nearby. In 1870, the state of Maryland moved the bodies to a more favorable site one-mile inland, and the individual graves could not be identified, so the remains were buried in a common grave. An 80-foot-tall granite monument was built at the gravesite, with the known names of the people buried at the site. There is a marble monument as well.
