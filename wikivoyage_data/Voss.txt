Voss village

Understand[edit]
Voss is the wide interior district in Hordaland county. Even if not directly at one of the great fjords, Voss is still a good base for a visit to fjords of Norway. From Voss the great Sognefjord and the romantic Hardangerfjord in less than 1 hour. Voss village, Vossevangen, sits a lovely lake, Vangsvatnet, and is a key station on the Bergen railway as well as a hub for roads Bergen-Oslo and roads north-south in the fjordland. A web of valleys converge at Voss village and Vangsvatnet is the confluence of several rivers. Below the lake Voss is connected to the inner fjord through a narrow valley. Voss river, Vosso, flows through the narrow valley through Evanger lake and drains into Bolstadfjorden. Vosso is known for its large salmon, average has been over 10 kilogram and records at 30 kg. The unique Vosso salmon is largely extinct. Evanger lake and Bolstadfjorden are narrow and complicated. Voss lake and village is only 50 meters above sea level. Voss is the only notable village in West Norway not situated at a salt water.

Road E16 and Bergen railway between Voss and Bergen.
From Voss the uplands at Myrdal and Finse is only an easy train ride away, areas that are available by train only. From Voss village several valleys stretches into the hinterland: Raundalen (with Bergen railway), towards Granvin and Hardanger, towards Myrkdalen, Vik/Vangsnes (road 13), and Opheim-Stalheim (road E16 to Gudvangen and Flåm). Raundalen valley cuts right east into the bedrock and the Raundal river partly flows through gorges, the road is dead end only the railway continues through a tunnel (Gravhalstunnelen) to Myrdal in Flåm district. The Gravhalstunnel from Raundalen to Myrdal is more than 5 kilometers and was the longest tunnel north of the Alps when completed in 1905. This railway tunnel was an engineering achievement as work began from both sides and workers missed by only 4 centimeters deep in the bedrock. The British army for many years used Raundalen area for winter training.
In the area you will also find a wide range of activity providers - including rafting, paragliding, mountain walking and guided excursions. Year-round there is a lot of cultural events, the most famous being The Extreme Sports Week - the world's biggest extreme sports festival. 
Voss is sheltered by surrounding mountains giving relatively dry and warm summers and relatively cold winters. As Bergen has unstable weather and little snow, many travel from Bergen to Voss for skiing. Voss has a drier and more stable weather, winters are colder and summer warmer. In the Myrkdalen there is often heavy snowfall making the new ski resort there popular. Myrkdalen in 2018 was ranked as the 5th best ski resort in Norway, up from 9th in 2017. Good off-piste options and children's area.
Voss has a long history, and have been welcoming international tourists for almost 200 years. Visitors come to experience the magnificent scenery - never-ending vistas of mountains and nearby glaciers and fjords, lakes and fast-flowing whitewater rivers - and to have plenty of active fun year round.

Ancient Finnesloftet, a guild hall from 1295 AD.
60.6270716.3954166 Finnesloftet. Finnesloftet is a medieval wooden building near Voss village, built in year 1295. It is one of the oldest non-religious wooden buildings in Norway and this is one of the few in Western Norway. Norway is the only country with a considerable number of ancient wooden buildings, about a half of these in Telemark and only a small number in Western Norway. Finnesloftet belongs to the Finne farm, presumably a rich property in the middle ages. This building is of the loft type, a traditional two-storey building for storage, bedrooms and official receptions. During the middle ages and well into the 17th and 18th centuries two-storey houses were uncommon, and two-storey lofts were the most prestigious and elaborate buildings. Finnesloftet is unique among loft as the first level is a log construction while the second is a stave construction like stave churches. The upper level of Finnesloftet was presumably used as guild hall and was in the middle ages more prominent in an area with only small single-storey houses.  (updated May 2021)
