Dundalk is the county town of County Louth on the east coast of the Republic of Ireland, 7 km south of the border with Northern Ireland. It's industrial and residential but there are scenic areas to the north, especially the Cooley peninsula. Its Irish name Dún Dealgan means "Dealgan's Fort" and there are several ancient sites nearby, such as Dromiskin monastery and Louth village. 


Understand[edit]
St Nicholas, the "green church"
Dundalk has long been a border town, even in legend and prehistory. To the south is low-lying fertile Leinster, settled by many invaders, such as the Normans from the 12th century. To the north rise the mountains of Ulster: the Ring of Gullion and the Mourne Mountains, with a gap between. Communications are funnelled into this gap, towards Newry.
Dundalk was wrecked and its townsfolk slain on so many occasions, but a long peaceful period began from 1801 and created the 19th-century town you see today. It developed into a miniature Belfast with linen and other textiles, food-processing, metal-bashing, shipping, the shoe trade, tobacco and distilling, and the Dublin-Belfast railway arrived in 1849. It grew even in the famine years when rural Ireland was being eviscerated. A slump set in when the 1921 partition of Ireland drew the border with Britain a few km north of town, traditional industries were lost to foreign competition, and from the 1960s "The Troubles" blighted the border. But in December 2000 after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, 60,000 people heard U.S. President Bill Clinton's open-air speech in Market Square, heralding "a new day in Dundalk and a new day in Ireland."
The new day was more like a long grey morning here, as industry and tourism were slow to recover. Currency and tax differences drove cross-border shoppers north to Newry not south to Dundalk. But the area is dotted with prehistoric and medieval sites that you can have to yourself, and there's coastal and hill scenery especially on the Cooley Peninsula. It takes little more than an hour to reach Dublin or Belfast, so Dundalk is very accessible. It's thus become a commuter town for both cities, and in 2022 had a population of 43,000.
The Tourist Information Office is in the municipal building on Magnet Rd, south end of Long Walk. It's open M-F 10AM-4PM.

Get in[edit]
Every couple of hours, the Enterprise Train runs from Dublin Connolly via Drogheda to Dundalk, taking 90 min, and continues to Newry, Portadown and Belfast Lanyon Place. There are also morning and evening commuter trains from Dublin. A walk-up single is €15, see Irish Rail for timetables and ticket deals. 
54-6.4131 Dundalk Clarke Railway Station is 500 m west of town centre. It has a ticket office open M-F 5:30AM-6PM, Sa 7AM-5PM, Su 10:30AM-2:30PM  and ticket machines, toilets and a cafe. It's the original 1894 station, named for Tom Clarke (Tomás Séamus Ó Cléirigh 1858-1916), executed for his part in the Easter Rising; along with Pearse and MacDonagh he was one of its chief instigators. 
Expressway Bus 100X runs hourly, daily from Dublin (several city stops but not Busáras) via the airport and Drogheda to Dundalk, taking two hours. The Aircoach and Belfast buses bypass the town. 
54.005-6.4042 Dundalk bus station in town centre is called the Long Walk. Remarkably for an Irish transport facility, this name is nothing to do with being executed by the British. 
By car from the south follow M1: there's a toll at Drogheda. From the north follow A1, which sweeps across the border at Killeen to become N1. 
54.034-6.1323 Carlingford Ferry plies across the opening of the lough between Grenore east of Dundalk and Greencastle in County Down. A car with all passengers is £12, a foot passenger, cyclist or motorbike is £2.25. It sails hourly Apr-Sep: daily 9AM-9PM, Oct-Mar: Sa Su 10AM-5PM, and the crossing takes 15 min.
There were ferries from Liverpool to Dundalk until 1968. It's still a busy port but only handles freight.

Interior of St Patrick's
54.003821-6.3991061 St Patrick's Church (St Patrick's pro-cathedral), Roden Place. Large Roman Catholic church built 1842-60 in Gothic style.   (updated Jan 2021)
Kelly's Monument next to St Patrick's commemorates the 1858 loss of four lifeboat men while attempting to rescue the crew of the wrecked Mary Stoddart.
St Nicholas on Church St is Church of Ireland, and called "the green church" for its verdigris spire. There's a monument to the poet Robert Burns, whose sister Agnes moved to Dundalk; her husband William Galt built the reservoirs for Stephenstown House, now just a sorry ruin. She retained her Ayrshire rural accent and recited her brother's poetry in its original inflection, which meant nobody could understand a word. Agnes and William are buried here.
Seatown Castle at the corner of Mill St and Castle Rd is a bell tower, all that remains of a Franciscan friary.
 County Museum, 8 Jocelyn St A91 EFY9. Tu-Sa 10AM-5PM. Museum in an 18th century warehouse depicts county life. (updated Jan 2021)
53.964-6.3652 Blackrock is a coastal village. In the 1950s / 60s this was the Costa Cavan, a budget beach resort for the nearby landlocked counties. The beach is artificial, as it keeps washing away to silt up the harbour. What the place lacks in sand it recompenses in mud, with mudflats stretching out for 5 km at low tide, a habitat for sea birds. The St Oliver Plunkett Church (Catholic) is attractive with a round tower, but it was only built circa 1920.
54.014-6.433 Dún Dealgan Motte in legend was the birthplace or castle of Cú Chulainn, and in fact was a motte-and-bailey: an earth mound topped with a palisade. But what you see now is "Byrne's Folly", a single tower of an incomplete 18th-century Gothic house. Byrne was said to be a pirate though it was probably just the common sport of smuggling. The house was rebuilt in the 1850s, to fall down again, so the folly has outlasted more sensible constructions.
54.046-6.4884 Castle Roche is the substantial ruin of a 13th century castle perched on a rocky outcrop 10 km northwest of town. It's free to stroll around.
Proleek Dolmen
Proleek Dolmen or "Giant's Load" is within the grounds of Ballymascanlon House, see Sleep. There's also a wedge tomb nearby.
54.052-6.3855 Hill of Faughart is a viewpoint north of town. There's a shrine to St Brigid to the west. Faughart Old Graveyard southeast of the hill has the grave of Edward Bruce, who was High King of Ireland until slain in battle here in 1318.
53.986-6.2340836 Gyles' Quay  is a historic wharf (popular with 18th- and 19th-century smugglers) and beach strip on the Peninsula.
54.04294-6.186097 Carlingford  is a small resort town on the north coast of Cooley Peninsula, looking across the lough to the Mourne Mountains in County Down. The Tholsel is the medieval gatehouse, The Mint is a 15th- or 16th-century tower house, and there's a ruined friary and castle. Lots of accommodation here.
53.922-6.48 Dromiskin is a village 10 km south of Dundalk with a monastery, active from the 6th to 12th century. There's a squat but impressive Round Tower, High Cross and ruined church.
53.974-6.4669 Clochafarmore is a standing stone 3 m high, on R171 four km southwest of town towards Knockbridge. In legend Cú Chulainn was slain here, but while his body was lashed to the stone he was able continue hacking bits off his foes.
53.951-6.54110 Louth village is the tiny place that gave its name to the county. St Mochta founded a monastery here circa 528 AD. Nothing remains that, but there are the ruins of the 12th-century St Mary's Priory, and St Mochta's House a medieval oratory reconstructed in the 1920s.
Louth Hall Castle 3 km south of the village is just a shell. it's on private land but you see enough from the road towards Ardee.
Knockabbey House and Gardens 3 km southwest of Louth village is closed, and in 2021 the property is for sale.

Go next[edit]
Newry just across the border is an interesting old market town. You usually have to go that way to reach the Mourne Mountains, as the ferry is summer-only.
Drogheda to the south is a historic town near the Boyne battlefield and Brú na Bóinne megalithic complex.
Dublin and Belfast can both be reached in little over an hour. You can easily day-trip, thought they're both worth at least a lost weekend.
