Understand[edit]
History[edit]
The first recorded mention of the Natuna Islands dates back to a visit by Chinese monk-explorer I-Tsing in 671 AD.  In 1597, Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah III of Johor claimed the islands, which were already settled by this time.  In 1824, the Dutch and British signed a treaty which carved the Johor Sultanate into three parts: Johor proper (now Malaysia), Singapore as the Straits Settlements, and Riau-Lingga Sultanate as a sphere of Dutch influence. During Riau-Lingga Kingdom, each of the islands were ruled by one Datok Kaya, except Great Natuna, which was ruled by two.
After the King of Riau-Lingga was forced to exile to Singapore in 1911, Natuna Islands became part of the Dutch division of Pulau Tudjuh ("Seven Islands") together with the other island groups between Riau and Sumatra, namely the Anambas, Tambelan and Badas Islands.  This split carried over into independent Indonesia, but in 1999 Tambelas and Badas were moved into Bintan and in 2008 Anambas became its own regency.
In 2007, a Marine Protected Area (MPA) was declared around the Natuna Islands.  Alas, enforcement has been minimal and rampant overfishing continues, further complicated by a territorial squabble with China over fishing rights at the northernmost tip of the area.

People[edit]
The 2000 census stated that, at least, almost 86% or 85,27% people in Natuna Regency registered as people with Malay ethnicity. 6,34% of the whole Natuna Regency population comes from Java and 2,52% of them are people with Chinese background. From people with Malay background, several can be broken down into some regions such as Terengganu, Pattani, Batam, Bintan, and plenty other Malay from mainland Sumatra.

Located only a few degrees north of the equator, the Natuna Islands are tropical, hot and humid throughout the year.  October to December is the rainy season, when it's frequently overcast for days, while February to April is the driest period.

Talk[edit]
Indonesian is the main language of the islands. Plenty of Terengganu and Pattani people came over here for decades so knowledge of Malay is helpful for travelling around the regency. Few locals understand English.

Respect[edit]




Ramadan
Ramadan is the 9th and holiest month in the Islamic calendar and lasts 29–30 days. Muslims fast every day for its duration and most restaurants will be closed until the fast breaks at dusk. Nothing (including water and cigarettes) is supposed to pass through the lips from dawn to sunset. Non-Muslims are exempt from this, but should still refrain from eating or drinking in public as this is considered very impolite. Working hours are decreased as well in the corporate world.
Exact dates of Ramadan depend on local astronomical observations and may vary somewhat from country to country. Ramadan concludes with the festival of Eid al-Fitr, which may last several days, usually three in most countries.

11 March – 9 April 2024 (1445 AH)
1 March – 29 March 2025 (1446 AH)
18 February – 19 March 2026 (1447 AH)
8 February – 8 March 2027 (1448 AH)
If you're planning to travel to Natuna Islands during Ramadan, consider reading Travelling during Ramadan.

Riding motorcycle outside Great Natuna/Bunguran Island, especially in small islands, with 30 km/h speed can be considered as rude gesture. Make sure you ride your motorcycle for at least 20 km/h. 20-30 km/h speed can still be tolerated.
