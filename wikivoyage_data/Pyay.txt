Bagan – One of the most famous attractions in Myanmar. Due to the new and direct highway between Yangon and Mandalay, it has become harder to catch a bus to Bagan from Pyay—but also reachable by ferry.
Mrauk U – Famous for is ancient sights and traditional, surrounding Chin Villages.
Ngapali – Has the most beautiful beaches in Myanmar, but is mostly a resort place with few budget options available. The best option is to go by bus to Taungup and catch onward travel to Thandwe bus station (6 km from the beach) from there.
Pathein – Famous for its handcrafted umbrellas. Reachable by bus or ferry.
Sittwe – Not particularly famous, more a transport hub for in- & outbound travel from & to Yangon (via plane), mostly for Mrauk U.
Taungup – Is nothing special, but there exist some tourist accommodation options. It can be a convenient hub for road travel between Pyay, Mrauk U, Sittwe and Ngapali.
Yangon – Reachable by bus, train or ferry.
