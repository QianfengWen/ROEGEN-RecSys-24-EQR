View from Fort Hill
Eastham is a town of 5,800 people (2020) in Massachusetts on Cape Cod, and includes the village of North Eastham.  Eastham is home to some beautiful bay and ocean beaches, most notably Coast Guard Beach and Nauset Lighthouse Beach,  as well as several fresh water kettle ponds. 


Understand[edit]
The scenic Fort Hill Area marks the beginning of the Cape Cod National Seashore and offers a panoramic view of Nauset Marsh with walking trails through a historic landscape of fields, forest and Red Maple Swamp. Further north, the Salt Pond Visitors Center makes a good starting point for orientation to the Cape Cod National Seashore beaches, activities, bike trails and walking trails. 
First Encounter Beach, one of Eastham's popular Bay beaches, is where Myles Standish and his Pilgrims first met up with Nauset Indians in 1620. Since Eastham is only 3 miles wide from the Atlantic Ocean to Cape Cod Bay, the town is a popular place to watch both sunrise and sunset over the water.  
The Cape Cod Rail Trail, a popular bike trail, runs the length of Eastham from Orleans to Wellfleet. There are 4 lighthouses along the coast in Eastham and one historic working windmill on the town green.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Eastham is 45 minutes on Route 6 from the Cape Cod Canal in Bourne and about two hours from Boston (100 miles). Travel time varies greatly from the off season to the on season, depending on traffic, weather conditions, road work, etc.

From Boston take I-93 south to Route 3 south to the Sagamore Bridge (Becomes Rt. 6).
From Providence or points south take I-95 north to I-195 to Route 25 south to the Bourne Bridge (I-495 also becomes Route 25). At the rotary (traffic circle) on the Cape side, go almost all the way around and travel along the Canal to Route 6 east.

A car is the easiest way to get around, though regional bus routes provide easy, frequent and cheap access to other towns. Eastham is also good for biking as most of the traffic stays on Route 6, the single main highway through the town, the Cape Cod Rail Trail (which follows the old railway right of way) runs through the entire town, and there is a beautiful bike trail at the CCNS Visitor's Center to Coast Guard Beach.
