Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky (Russian: Петропа́вловск-камча́тский, pee-truh-PAHV-luhvsk kahm-CHAHT-skee) is the capital and largest city on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula. It is a port city on the Avacha Bay and surrounded by high, snow-capped mountains and volcanoes. This city of roughly 180,000 residents (2018) is the principal entry point for travelers visiting the peninsula, and has good tourist infrastructure, offering activities ranging from wildlife viewing to bear hunting to paragliding. Far afield, the city is geographically closer to San Francisco, California, across the Pacific Ocean, than to the capital, Moscow.

Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky shares the same parallels as Manchester and Dublin, but is harsher climate-wise.
In summer the daily temperatures happen to reach 25-30°C. Rains are frequent at daytime with mists that occur in evenings. Winters are mitigated by the sea and are much milder and snowier than the rest of Siberia. The end of January and beginning of February are frosty, often about -20 °C.
The closest analogues in climate are Alaska's Anchorage and Juneau.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The only practical way to reach Kamchatka is the 53.1677158.45361 Petropavlovsk Kamchatsky Airport (PKC  IATA) (in Yelizovo, 16 km north-west of the city).   
Most visitors arrive on the Aeroflot flight from Moscow, but S7 offers a 3-hour flight from Vladivostok (10000 руб). There is also a regular connection to Khabarovsk by SAT Airlines. The Aeroflot flight is on an A330, S7 and Vladivostok Air use A320s.
Other possible destinations include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk and Krasnoyarsk. Beginning in July 2012, service will begin to Anchorage on Vladivostok Air.
Bus #113 goes from the airport to the city centre; a taxi would cost about US$20.

By bus[edit]
Public transportation in Kamchatka is limited to buses. The main bus station is on Pobedy Prospect and offers daily services (in high season) to Esso, Oktyabrsky, Milkovo, and Ust-Kamchatsk. Be sure to get to the ticket office early in the morning. It opens at 08:00.

By road[edit]
Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky is the second largest mainland city in the world that is unreachable by road from any other noticeable city, behind Iquitos in Peru. However, a handful of roads on the peninsula connect the city with its airport (in Yelizovo), and with the closed city of Vilyuchinsk.

Get around[edit]

Most things of interest within the city are located within a compact area that can be covered on foot. The central square Teatralnaya is a venue for all major city events. Out of the square are running up three main streets: Leninskaya, Sovetskaya and Partizanskaya. There are also cheap buses and minbuses operating fixed routes throughout the city, mostly along the main road (fare as at July 2011 was 16 руб flat fare, pay driver as you alight).

Further afield[edit]
53.09078158.2438844 Pimchakh (Пимчах). It is a reconstruction of a traditional Itelmen village serving as a cultural center for the Itelmens (original inhabitants of southern Kamchatka, now mostly assimillated, with their language on the verge of extinction). The camp is located in beautiful countryside at the base of Ostraya Gora ("Steep Mountain" in Russian, due to the peculiarly conical shape), a few kilometers beyond Sosnovka village (Сосновка). It is possible to visit the place independently, if you're an adventurous traveller. One first needs to get to Sosnovka. Sosnovka can be reached by infrequent public buses from Yelizovo bus station (Yelizovo is the small airport town served by frequent buses from Petropavlovsk.) There are also more frequent public buses that go to the Sosnovka/Nikolaevka intersection on the main road between Yelizovo and Termalny, from where one can walk on the paved road to Sosnovka (around 4km). In Sosnovka, one has to find the dirt road starting at Tatyana shop (Татьяна) next to the bus stop. One can then walk on that dirt road for 1.5-2 km through the cultivated agricultural land. At some point, the fields on the right end, giving way to the forest. Behind the last field, one takes a right turn to another dirt road. That place is marked by a small ПИМЧАХ sign. From there, it's a nice walk for a couple more kilometers to the Itelmen cultural center. Google map. (updated Sep 2016)
