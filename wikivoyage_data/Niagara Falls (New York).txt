See Niagara Falls (Ontario) for information about the Canadian side of the falls.

Niagara Falls is in the Niagara Frontier region of New York state.


Understand[edit]
The Niagara Falls consist of three sections.  The large Canadian falls—with their distinctive curved shape—are also known as the Horseshoe Falls.  They are separated by Goat Island from the American Falls, which are separated from the narrow Bridal Veil Falls by a small island at their south end.
Each side of the falls offers a different perspective, and it is always best to visit both sides to maximize your experience. In contrast to the panoramic view of the falls afforded by the Canadian side, what is seen from Niagara Falls, New York is a heart-pounding, sidelong, close-up look at the rushing water at the moment it tumbles over the precipice. On the American side, the immediate vicinity of the falls is part of Niagara Falls State Park, the oldest state park in the nation.  The presence of the state park (originally laid out by renowned landscape designer Frederick Law Olmsted) serves to preserve the natural beauty of the area and prevent the kind of commercialization that you'll find on the Canadian side. Visitors looking to experience the falls as a natural wonder will appreciate this.
During the winter season, a lot of maintenance of the falls, tours, and surroundings takes place. Many areas, such as Terrapin Point and Luna Island, are closed due to slippery conditions. Winter brings a different kind of beauty to the falls and a visit during that time is certainly worthwhile, but if you want to experience the full range of tourist amenities described in this article, plan to come in the warmer months.
In contrast to Niagara Falls, Ontario, Niagara Falls, NY has fallen into tough economic times. With manufacturing jobs gone, the population has continued to decrease over the years and the economic state of the city is apparent once you venture out of the actual Falls area.

By bus[edit]
Greyhound offers service from Buffalo. There are two daily departures from the Municipal Transportation Center in downtown Buffalo, at 7AM and 9:30PM respectively, which drop you off in the Falls at the Quality Hotel at 240 1st St. The trip takes half an hour and costs $7. If you're headed in from elsewhere, you'll have to transfer at Buffalo first; see Buffalo#By bus for information on service from destinations further afield.
A cheaper ($2) but slower (50 minutes) option from downtown Buffalo is NFTA Metro Bus #40[dead link], which you board at the Buffalo Municipal Transportation Center and will drop you off at various locations in Niagara Falls. See the linked schedule and map for details.
OurBus serves Niagara Falls from New York City with intermediate stops in Binghamton, Syracuse, Henrietta, and Amherst. There are six weekly departures from New York (8AM every day but Wednesday) arriving at 4:30PM at the Niagara Falls USA Visitor Center at 10 Rainbow Blvd. Fares are about half what Greyhound charges.

Get around[edit]
The City of Niagara Falls in winter
By foot[edit]
You can really do a lot without a car once you get to the immediate vicinity of the Falls.  If you are staying downtown you may be able to get by without a car.   The toll for walking the Rainbow Bridge westbound to Canada is $1 (both U.S. and Canadian currency accepted), paid on the Canadian side coming into Canada. (There is no eastbound toll.)  If you travel with any baby carriage, you pay no extra toll. Do not photograph or film on the Bridge without getting Bridge Commission approval and signing a liability waiver first. You cannot walk across the Lewiston-Queenston Bridge.

By bicycle[edit]
Bicycling can be faster than walking to get around. The toll for bicycling and walking the bridge across the national border is the same. On the bridge sidewalk, bicyclists are officially supposed to walk their bikes, but you may bicycle on the far right lane of the Rainbow Bridge and Lewiston-Queenston Bridge like a car.
Reddy Bikeshare, Buffalo's bike-sharing network, expanded to Niagara Falls in 2019, with about three dozen locations spread out citywide but (as you might expect) most heavily concentrated in the downtown tourist area. To use a Reddy bike, sign in to the SoBi mobile app to find and reserve an available bike at any of the various Reddy racks around the city (or simply walk up to a rack and enter your account number and PIN on the bike's keypad to unlock it). Then, when you're finished, simply lock your bike up at whichever Reddy rack is nearest you. There's a $2 fee for locking a Reddy bike up anywhere other than a Reddy rack. If you need to stop off somewhere along the way, you also have the option to "hold" your Reddy bike, which will enable you to lock it temporarily without incurring the $2 fee and without the bike becoming available for reservation by other users. When you're ready to take off again, simply enter your PIN number on the bike's keypad and you're good to go. Rates are $8.50 for a 30-day membership or $55 for an annual membership, after which point use of the bikes costs 6¢ and 1¢ per minute, respectively. If you're planning on visiting Buffalo before or after your trip to the Falls, your Reddy membership works there too.

By car[edit]
Car is a convenient option to get around, and to see the attractions surrounding the Falls.
Parking at Niagara Falls State Park is a breeze, with four ample-sized parking lots that charge $10/day. Parking on the American side and walking across the bridge may be an attractive method of getting to the Canadian side for a day trip.
Once you leave the park and enter downtown Niagara Falls proper, rates get steeper and availability gets scarcer. There are four public parking ramps downtown that each charge the same rate: $20/day M-Th and $30/day F-Su during tourist season (May-Oct), $10/day offseason. On-street parking is more expensive still, at $5/hour during the tourist season and $3/hour offseason.
If you're parking downtown, there are clearly posted signs directing you to the tourist area. Most shops and attractions are within walking distance from downtown.

Crossing the border[edit]
If you want to see the Canadian side, you can cross at the Rainbow Bridge (downtown) or the Queenston-Lewiston Bridge (north of the city). Be sure you have proper documentation for yourself (passport or other approved alternative) and your vehicle (registration, insurance card, etc.) If you're driving a rental car, pay particular attention to your rental contract. Unlike driving into Mexico, most national rental firms in the US don't have an issue with you driving into Canada; however, there's a decent chance that Canadian travel is not included in your unlimited mileage allowance (unless the rental originated in New York State) and surcharges may apply. Remember, you can always park in downtown Niagara Falls, New York and walk across the Rainbow Bridge to enjoy the sights on the Canadian side.

By bus[edit]
In addition to the aforementioned #40 bus, the NFTA municipal bus system includes five additional routes serving Niagara Falls. The two of most interest to tourists are:

Bus #55T (Trolley)[dead link], which begins at Niagara Falls International Airport and runs westward down Niagara Falls Boulevard past the factory outlet mall, then along Pine Avenue through Little Italy as far as the Aquarium of Niagara, then descends southward into the downtown casino and hotel district, and
Bus #50 (Main-Niagara)[dead link], which begins at the outlet mall, proceeding westward from there into downtown via Buffalo Avenue and Niagara Street, and from there northward, with service to the destinations in the upper Niagara Gorge (Whirlpool State Park, DeVeaux Woods State Park, Devil's Hole State Park, and the Niagara Power Vista) en route to its terminus in Lewiston.

The Maid of the Mist and the American Falls
43.0865-79.06792 Maid of the Mist. A boat ride, taking you down around the bottom of the falls. Some information is given about the falls, but the real experience is looking up at the falls from below and feeling the mist coming off the falls (hence the name). Wear a poncho to avoid getting wet. Boats leave from both the American and Canadian sides, so you may want to check the exchange rates to see which will be more cost-effective when you visit! Apr-Oct. Adult: $28.25, Child: $17.75, 5 and under: free.   
43.0864-79.06843 Niagara Falls Observation Tower (Prospect Point). $1.25.   (updated Feb 2019)
43.0935-79.06224 The Niagara Gorge Discovery Center, ☏ +1 716 278-1070. Although it's easy to enjoy the falls visually, the Discovery Center provides another way to appreciate the magnificence of the falls; geologically. Exhibits show the history of the entire area, including the falls, how they were originally formed, and how they've changed over time.   
43.094325-79.0601435 Aquarium of Niagara, 701 Whirlpool St, toll-free: +1-800-500-4609. 9AM-5PM. The aquarium at Niagara Falls. $10.

Whirpool Tours in nearby Lewiston is a jet boat ride that will take you to the falls.
Helicopter Rides Howard Johnson's on Rainbow Blvd.

A feast for the eyes: the Prophet Isaiah's Second Coming House.
43.108793-79.0459879 Prophet Isaiah's Second Coming House, 1308 Ontario Ave. This off-the-beaten-path local landmark was the brainchild of Isaiah Robertson, a Jamaican-born house flipper who, so the story goes, had a religious vision wherein God told him that the end of the world would happen in Niagara Falls in 2014, and that he was to take his house and decorate it as garishly as possible with colorful wooden trinkets so that anyone who passed by would be so impressed and inspired that they'd be saved. The centerpiece of the decor scheme is the cross to the east of the house, which stands 25 feet tall, supposedly the same height Christ would be at the Second Coming. Undeterred by the fact that 2014 came and went without any such happening, Robertson continued his work until shortly before his death in January 2020. (updated Jul 2020)
Do[edit]
There are literally dozens of operators offering tours of the area; only a few offer value-added services on top of simply ferrying you place to place and describing the sites.

 Rainbow Air Helicopter Tours. It's safe to say it's hard to replicate the experience of flying over the falls without booking a helicopter tour. It's an awesome experience, though $165 may seem like a lot of cash for a 11-14 minutes ride. (updated Jul 2018)
If you get bored with the scenery and don't much care for probability and statistics, the local Native American tribe has just the place:

Three floors filled to the brim with new books and used treasures. Shows and other events on the third floor. 
 One Niagara Welcome Centre, 360 Rainbow Road. ***AVOID THIS BUILDING***This building is large and flashy and markets itself as the Niagara Falls Visitor Centre. The real visitor centre is a few blocks away. This building sells lots of useless junk of dubious quality. It also sells food that appears to be problematic, not to mention how expensive the food is in total. Any packages or whatnot purchased here (such as Maid of the Mist) are also more expensive than from official vendors. People have said that they also add hidden "taxes" to anything purchased. In addition, they charge $25 for parking to unsuspecting tourists who don't know any better, which is more expensive than most other parking. (updated May 2022)

Pizza[edit]
Aside from a single Papa John's location inside the Quality Hotel downtown and a Pizza Hut way out by the outlet mall, the big national pizzeria chains don't have much of a presence in Niagara Falls. So you may as well take the opportunity to get acquainted with the local style, a closely guarded local secret that's practically unknown even to folks from elsewhere in Western New York. Classic Niagara Falls pizza is cooked in a square pan and always sliced into squares, with a crust that's thin like New York-style but with a pillowy consistency and nutty flavor, and a sauce that is subtly seasoned with oregano and has a faint tinge of sweetness (though nowhere near as assertively sweet as on Buffalo pizza). The cheese is thin and sparse — generally there's just enough to fully cover the crust — with pepperoni baked underneath and any other toppings (generally there are none) on top. If you're intrigued, the stretch of Niagara Street between Portage Road and Hyde Park Boulevard is where you'll find the two best exponents of the style: Frenchy's and The Pizza Oven. Or if that's too rough of a neighborhood for you, head north to Mr. Ventry's on Pierce Avenue.

Drink[edit]
The drinking age in New York is 21, however, due to the fact that Niagara Falls straddles the border, 19 and 20 year-olds may cross the border into Canada to legally drink. Alcohol is more expensive in Canada.

43.09944-78.9764781 Judi's Lounge, 2057 Military Rd, ☏ +1 716 297-5759. Townie bar specializing in wings. 
Sleep[edit]
There are not really any major luxury hotels in the area, but a new hotel is now at Seneca Niagara Casino. There are several other nice-looking hotels downtown by the Falls, and then a series of motels on Niagara Falls Boulevard, including several $20/night fleabag specials (where they really always charge you more than that anyway).
Downtown, the best hotels are Seneca Niagara Casino & Hotel, Doubletree Hotel & Conference Center, and The Red Coach Inn. Radisson on the River is coming soon on Buffalo Avenue and is located on the Niagara River overlooking the North Grand Island Bridge.
There are several B&Bs: Butler House, Park Place B&B, and the Elizabeth House.

Downtown Niagara Falls — that is, the area immediately surrounding the falls themselves — is undergoing something of a renaissance, with a small boom in new hotels being constructed, new shops and restaurants on Old Falls Street, and a general sprucing up compared to a few years back. However, many of the residential neighborhoods surrounding downtown remain rundown, a victim of the economic malaise that swept over the region as a whole in the late 20th century, a time when many of the chemical plants and other industries that employed residents shut down. If you're straying outside of downtown, common-sense rules for any urban area apply: lock your car doors, avoid flashy displays of wealth, keep your wits about you. Exceptions to this rule are the DeVeaux neighborhood as well as adjacent areas along the lower Niagara River north of downtown, which are quite well-to-do residential neighborhoods, as well as the busy commercial strip of Niagara Falls Boulevard and the adjacent middle-class neighborhood of LaSalle, near Niagara Falls International Airport.

Go next[edit]
There are numerous other waterfalls in western New York (all much smaller), notably the 3 falls of the Genesee River within Letchworth State Park. Old Fort Niagara, a historical site, is around half an hour to the north, and Buffalo is about half an hour away.
You can travel to the Canadian side for a closer view of Horseshoe Falls and to visit the other attractions in Niagara Falls, Ontario and Niagara-on-the-Lake, although you will need a passport or another document proving both identity and citizenship, the main Canada article covers documentation requirements and crossing the border by land in depth.
Lewiston is just to the north, and is usually visited as part of a trip to the Falls. Lewiston sports a cute village center filled with shops, restaurants, and bed and breakfast inns. Lewiston is also home of Artpark State Park, with a popular open-air auditorium in addition to normal park activities.
