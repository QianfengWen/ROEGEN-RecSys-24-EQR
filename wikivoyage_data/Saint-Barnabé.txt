History[edit]
The emblematic flower of the town is the impatiens. This flower signifies a long flowering if it is given good care. Blue is associated with calm. This flower is also a symbol of truth, trust and beneficence. The municipal motto "at the heart of our lives" refers to belonging.
In 1820, the colonists (numbering about 600) thought of breaking away from Yamachiche in order to form their own parish. In 1832, the first church was built. The first school was built in 1842.

Geography[edit]
The territory of Saint-Barnabé is crossed by a segment of the Yamachiche River and Little Yamachiche River (to the southwest).
From an aerial point of view, this landscape of the St. Lawrence plain is dotted with forest islands, especially for areas unsuitable for agriculture and shrubs that magnificently mark out the lot line. The old barns with their often rusty tin roofs reflect the preservation of the ancestral character of the old farm buildings. Around the old houses, which are generally well restored, there are sheds, old dairies, machinery shelters, gardens and mature trees. You can also observe the agricultural machinery that has been released according to the seasons. Maize, oats and hay grow abundantly there until haymaking. Where there are cattle in the fields, there is an automatic baring infrastructure installed at the end of the cattle barns. In Saint-Barnabé, in terms of real estate, the rustic and the modern come together.
A tourist tour in the rang du Haut St-Joseph, the rang du Bas St-Joseph (route 153), the route des Dalles, the chemin de la Grande Rivière, the rang de Bellechasse and the route Bournival, allows you to admire the agricultural and sometimes forest panoramas, as well as the cachet of old buildings.
