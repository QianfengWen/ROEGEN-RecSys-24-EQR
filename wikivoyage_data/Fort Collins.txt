Fort Collins is a city of about 170,000 in north central region of the western U.S. state of Colorado. The seat of Larimer County, the city lies 59 miles (95 km) north of Denver on the Cache La Poudre River at the eastern edge of the Front Range foothills. Fort Collins is the home of Colorado State University and is a major research center.


Understand[edit]
Old Town Fort Collins.
Old Town is the downtown area of the city, centered on the cross-streets of College Avenue and Mountain Avenue. It is the historical beginnings of the town, with a vast variety of older buildings and historical monuments. Those seeking to visit architecture from the early 20th century should come to Fort Collins for its prime examples.
The Colorado State University campus is right in the middle of the city, extending from Prospect Road on the South to Laurel Street on the north, and from Shields street on the west to College Avenue on the East.  The university also has several other smaller campuses throughout the city. The big white "A" on the mountain west of town stands for Aggies, a relic from when CSU was Colorado Agricultural College.

Bustang is a state-wide bus service operated by the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT). The buses are new, clean, and punctual, offering affordable fares. Additionally, the buses are equipped with a bike rack, and passengers can bring bicycles at no extra charge. For only $10, the North Line provides a direct connection to Denver.
Flex is a service run by Transfort that connects to Loveland, Berthoud, Longmont, and Boulder. Fares are suspended as of June 2023. Buses have bike racks.
The Poudre Express is a bus service operated by Greeley Evans Transit (GET), which conveniently connects Fort Collins to Greeley and . This bus service boasts of its modern and well-maintained vehicles, however, the buses do not run frequently and often experience delays, particularly during rush hour. Fares are reasonably priced at $1.25 for individuals who are 19 years old and above. Free wifi and bike racks on board.
Greyhound Lines has connections with Denver and towards Salt Lake City, through Cheyenne. Furthermore, there is also a connection to Laramie.
By rail[edit]
The nearest train station is Denver Union Station, which can be accessed by Amtrak's California Zephyr.
Amtrak operates a throughway bus route from Denver through Fort Collins, but if you attempt to schedule this on their website, it will not allow you to do so (as of June 2023). However, there is a throughway connection to Greeley. Nevertheless, it is likely more affordable and less strict on luggage sizes to use the Bustang North Line, which has a stop at Union Station in Denver.

By bicycle[edit]
Fort Collins is renowned for being incredibly bicycle-friendly according to US standards, boasting numerous paved trails and designated bike routes. Remarkably, bike lanes are found everywhere, including on the most uncomfortable arterial roads. In fact, biking can often be faster than driving, particularly during rush hour, as bike trails often take more direct routes and are typically given priority at street crossings. To aid navigation, a bicycle map is available here. 
There are many bike rental options in Fort Collins:

Recycled Cycles rents bikes for $30/day.
Guests at the Armstrong Hotel are provided free bikes to ride during their stay.
Spin ride share e-bikes and scooters can be found all over the city.
Many other bike shops such as The Gearage may also rent bikes.
The Fort Collins Bike Coop is likely the most affordable choice for both parts and repairs. This nonprofit charity is operated by volunteers, enabling them to offer significantly lower prices compared to other places. The mechanics are highly experienced and provide you with the opportunity to return to the shop and learn how to fix your bike while they work on it. Additionally, they have a vast selection of used parts.

 Cache La Poudre River, ☏ +1 970-232-3840, toll-free: +1-800-274-3678, information@ftcollins.com. The Cache La Poudre river flows from the canyon proper, several miles north, through town and offers excellent fly fishing for wild rainbow and brown trout. In town, quick fishing access is available starting from the crossing at North Shields and continuing through town. You can tube and swim at various locations in the river in town, though take great care. The river is MUCH more powerful than you might think. The current can easily trap you if you aren't careful. Every year there are stories of naïve people on the local news who drown in tubing accidents. There are even signs posted at many parts of the river that are particularly dangerous. Tubing and swimming can be done safely, but make sure you check with somebody experienced first. There is a paved trail called the Poudre trail that runs parallel to the river through much of town. The canyon itself can be reached by taking College Ave./Hwy 287 north out of town and turning onto Poudre Canyon/Hwy 14. Pressed between narrow canyon walls and fed by snow-melt, the water here is wilder and colder and swimming should be done with caution. Several companies offer whitewater rafting in the canyon and kayaks are a common sight. There are several hiking trails in the canyon, including Greyrock Trail, which takes you across the river via bridge into open pine forest and meadow. Wildlife are common, including deer, fox, rabbit and black bear, as well as the occasional mountain lion and many kinds of birds. Camping and summer cabins are available throughout the canyon. The Columbine Lodge, in the small community of Poudre Park, offers both as well as beach access (for campers and residents), a good supply of snacks, drinks and good company. Seasonally, a shuttle is available between the Lodge and nearby Mishawaka Amphitheatre, a lively local bar on the river that opened as a dance hall in 1916 and continues to attract various famous acts and music-lovers every year.

 Bike Parks and Trails. There is an extensive set of biking/walking trails throughout town. The Poudre Trail follows the Poudre River from Bellvue, through Fort Collins, to CSU's Environmental Learning Center. It is fully paved and extends all the way to Greeley, although there is a significant gap in the trail between Fort Collins and Windsor. However, from Windsor, the trail becomes paved again and continues to Greeley.
The Spring Creek Trail runs alongside the Spring Creek, from where it meets the Poudre River westward to Spring Canyon Park. Spring Canyon Park also includes a bike park. Another paved trail is the Fossil Creek Trail, which starts at the edge of Loveland's trail network and connects to the Power Trail in the east.
Additionally, the Power Trail and the Mason Trail are paved routes that run north/south along Timberline and College, respectively. These trails provide low-stress cycling options. Heading north from Spring Canyon Park towards Bellvue, there is an extensive collection of mountain bike trails on the hogback, which forms the eastern side of Horsetooth Reservoir. Lory State Park, located on the northwest side of Horsetooth Reservoir, features a small bike park with various challenging elements such as jumps, a pump track, jump runs, and a wooden trials track.
For adventurous mountain bikers, it is possible to ride from Bellvue through Lory State Park, along the western side of the reservoir, and onto the challenging Blue Sky Trail, leading to Loveland. However, it is worth noting that the Blue Sky Trail is highly technical. If you lack confidence in riding a bike up staircases, it is recommended to tackle the trail from north to south. Be prepared to allocate twice the amount of time you anticipate needing and be ready to walk your bike if necessary. (updated Sep 2023)
