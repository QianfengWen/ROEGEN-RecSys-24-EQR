Jackpot is in Northern Nevada, just across the border from Idaho.


Understand[edit]
Jackpot owes its existence to a 1954 law banning all forms of casino gaming in Idaho. In response two established Idaho casino operators, Don French and "Cactus Pete" Piersanti, moved their operations to this previously uninhabited point less than 1 mi (1.6 km) south of the Idaho border. French's and Piersanti's establishments – both still in operation today – were called the Horseshu Club and Cactus Pete's respectively. Less than a decade after its founding, the town had grown to over 400 full-time residents. Today Jackpot supports its own post office and high school.
Piersanti bought out French in 1964 to form what would eventually become Ameristar Casinos. Today Ameristar operates Cactus Pete's and the Horseshu as a single entity. Barton's Club 93, Ameristar's main competition in Jackpot, set up shop in 1967. All three properties are within easy walking distance of each other.

Get in[edit]
By road[edit]
U.S. Highway 93 runs north/south through Jackpot and is the only direct route into town. Driving south from Twin Falls, it's about 45 mi (72 km) to Jackpot. From points east and west, Interstate 80 has a junction with Highway 93 at Wells, 67 mi (108 km) south of Jackpot. From Boise and the Pacific Northwest, Interstate 84 has a junction with Highway 93 just north of Twin Falls. From Montana, Interstate 84 can be accessed through southbound Interstate 15 to Pocatello and then westbound Interstate 86. Caldwell Transportation offers regular chartered bus service to Jackpot from the Boise metro area.

By plane[edit]
The nearest commercial airport is 42.481667-114.4877781 Joslin Field – Magic Valley Regional Airport
(TWF IATA) in Twin Falls.

Get around[edit]
Jackpot is compact and very walkable. All of the city's casinos are located along U.S. 93. The town's few side streets are almost entirely residential.

41.94344-114.687161 Salmon Falls Creek. 
Do[edit]
41.989593-114.6606321 Jackpot Golf Club, 415 Ace Dr, ☏ +1 775 755-2260, info@jackpotgolfclub.com. Open March–November. Measuring 6,436 yd (5,885 m), this full 18-hole golf course provides one of the town's few non-gaming diversions. With a slope rating of 107, it is considered a slightly easier course than average. $27/player for 18 holes (cart rental extra). 

Gambling[edit]




If you win...
Chances are that, if you win it big in Jackpot (hit the jackpot) and you are not a U.S. citizen your winnings will be subject to a 30% withholding tax from the Internal Revenue Service. That $10,000 slot winning can dwindle quite quickly if that is taken off the top. Not to worry though you can reclaim your gambling winnings tax through a 1042-S form. You should get this from the casino so don't lose it: it is your starting ticket to getting your gambling winnings back.


Virtually all of the city's economic activity revolves around its casinos. Gambling has been the main pastime in Jackpot since day one, and that's unlikely to change anytime soon. However, Cactus Pete's features shows with relatively big-name talent. As in the rest of Nevada, you must be 21 to gamble or to even be on the casino floor, laws which are strenuously enforced.

Buy[edit]
There are souvenir shops in the casinos and a small supermarket near the Horseshu. That's it. You'll need to go to Twin Falls, Wells or Elko for anything more substantial.

Eat[edit]
There are no freestanding eating establishments – fast food or otherwise – in Jackpot. However Cactus Pete's, the Horseshu, Four Jacks and Barton's Club 93 all have established restaurants, some of which are open 24 hours. Menus are pretty similar, and not particularly exotic.

 Rag Time Café, inside the Four Jacks Casino, ☏ +1 775 755-2491. 
 Plateau Room, inside Cactus Pete's, ☏ +1 775 755-2321 ext 6315. W–Su 5:30PM–9:30PM, M Tu closed. 
Drink[edit]
Once again, the only drinking establishments are in the casinos. In stark contrast to nearby Idaho, many Jackpot bars serve 24-7 (including holidays) and have for well over 40 years.

41.989622-114.6714091 Stateline Liquor, 810 US Highway 93 N (just inside the Nevada border, on the west side of the highway), ☏ +1 775 755-2368. A small liquor store on the north end of town, often offers products unavailable in Idaho, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Montana. Typically lower prices due to private ownership of liquor stores in NV. (updated Nov 2016)
Sleep[edit]

Cope[edit]
Although legally in the Pacific Time Zone (UTC−8 standard time, UTC−7 daylight time), Jackpot de facto observes Mountain Time (UTC−7 standard, UTC−6 daylight) due to its economic ties with southern Idaho. Of particular note, show times at Cactus Pete's are always Mountain.

41.9901-114.66561 Jackpot Community Health Center, 950 Lady Luck Drive, ☏ +1 775-755-2500. M-Th 7AM–noon, 1-6PM. Provides primary and preventive care. (updated Dec 2016)
41.9796-114.6732 U.S. Postal Service, 1925 Gurley Dr., ☏ +1 775-755-2252. M-F 9AM-1:30PM, 2-5PM; Sa 9:30AM-noon. (updated Dec 2016)
Stay safe[edit]
Because of its remoteness, rough terrain, unpredictable weather and consistent problem with drunk drivers, the approximately 45 mi (72 km) of U.S. 93 between Jackpot and Twin Falls is statistically one of the single most dangerous highways in the United States. Avoid travel at night or during winter storms whenever possible.
