Pandeglang is a town in the province of Banten, in the  Western Java region of Indonesia.


Understand[edit]
Pandeglang is the capital of the regency of Pandeglang, which is the most southwestern regency of the island of Java and also includes Ujung Kulon National Park. The town of Pandeglang is in the far northeast of this regency, to the west from Rangkasbitung and to the south from Serang. The town of Pandeglang has a population of about 40,000 and is a regional economic centre, along with the fishing towns along the coast, mainly Labuan.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Pandeglang is not connected to the toll road network. The easiest way to get to the city from the capital Jakarta is by taking the Jakarta-Merak toll road until exit Serang Timur (East Serang). From there, take the trunk road south. Without traffic, the drive from Jakarta takes 2 hours. However, due to traffic congestion this is usually about 3 hours. Pandeglang is also along the east-west trunk road between Labuan and Rangkasbitung.

By bus[edit]
As the railway to Pandeglang is no longer operated, the only way to get to the town by public transport is by bus. The -6.30423106.107791 Kota Badak bus terminal, just north of the town centre, is served by frequent buses and minibuses to nearby destinations such as Labuan, Serang, Rangkasbitung, and the port of Merak, as well as to various bus terminals in Jakarta. There are also daily buses to some other cities, including Bogor and Bandung.
