Connect[edit]
By phone[edit]
Most telephone numbers in Meade County consist of +1 270 plus a seven-digit number, but the area is now served by an overlay complex of two area codes, with +1 364 being the second. A local or in-state telephone call now requires all 10 digits of the local number be dialed (omitting just the leading +1 from a local landline call).
Signage on many established businesses may still display the original seven-digit numbers; dial 270 before these if no area code is indicated.
Note that Muldraugh is served by area code 502 instead of 270/364. That community is completely surrounded by the Fort Knox Army base, which is also in area code 502. No overlay has yet been imposed on that area, so 7-digit local landline dialing is still allowed.
