The permanent settlement dates to 1814, when a church was established on the bank of the river. The settlement was originally part of Tefé. On December 1, 1938, Tonantins was made a part of São Paulo de Olivença. On December 19, 1955, Tonantins was made a part of Santo Antônio do Içá. On December 10, 1981, it was separated to form its own jurisdiction. Tonantins was incorporated on July 2, 1985.
The municipality is directly east of and overlaps parts of the ESEC (Ecological Station) Jutaí-Solimões. It is only accessible via boat.
