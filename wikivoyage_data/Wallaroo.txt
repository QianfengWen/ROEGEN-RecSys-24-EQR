Wallaroo is a coastal town on the western side of Yorke Peninsula in South Australia and is a popular tourist destination.  Along with Kadina and Moonta, Wallaroo forms the Copper Coast, formerly known as the Copper Triangle.


Understand[edit]
The name Wallaroo comes from the Indigenous Australian Narungga word 'Wadlu Waru' meaning wallaby urine. The early British colonials tried to copy this word by calling it Walla Waroo, however they found this too big to stamp on the wool bales, so they shortened it to Wallaroo.
Wallaroo has a deep sea port, at which the Viterra grain terminal is located and ships dock to fill up with grain. When there's no ship in port, the jetty is a favourite location for fishing.
Wallaroo is also home to the Spencer Gulf Prawn fleet, and has a multi-million dollar marina - Copper Cove Marina.

Contact[edit]
Cellular (mobile) telephone network reception may not be available in many areas especially those distant from cellular network repeater towers normally located along the major highways and near larger townships. Hilly terrain will also effect reception. In an emergency seek higher ground. Some networks provide a poor coverage in regional and rural areas. It is generally considered that the best reception is available from either Telstra or Optus when in areas such as Yorke Peninsula.
For emergency services including police, fire services and ambulance call 000 from any telephone and ask the operator to connect you. Such calls are placed without charge to the calling party.
