A Coruña (Spanish: La Coruña) is the second most populous city in Galicia, and capital of its own province. It is home to a very busy port as well as the main industrial and administrative centre of the area.


Understand[edit]
Orientation[edit]
A Coruña is located on a peninsula on the northwestern corner of Spain. Originally, it was just a tiny strip of land, but over time, sand and rock built up to form the area we see today. In A Coruña, autumn and winter are usually unpredictable, with everything from overcast to snow. Summers are mostly sunny, and rain is rare. Spring is the most stable season in the city, with cool temperatures and calm weather.
A Coruña has a ring road that runs around the edge of the coast. The city is divided up into five parishes.
A Coruña is also known for its characteristic glazed window balconies, called galerías. These balconies were first designed as a naval solution for bad weather and rainy days. However, in the 18th century, workers at the Royal Dockyards had the idea of putting these balconies on modern buildings: and the fashion was born.
Most of A Coruña's historic sights can be found in its Old Town, or Cidade Vella. Notable buildings in the Old Town are the Royal Galician Academy, the churches of Santiago and Saint Mary, As Bárbaras Monastery, and the headquarters of the Operational Logistics Force of the Spanish Army. Each year in July, a Medieval Fair also takes place in the Old Town.

Climate[edit]
Being exposed to Atlantic winds and low-pressure systems bringing plenty of rainfall for most of the year, it has the coolest summers of Spain's major urban areas, but likewise has very mild winters for its latitude.

They begin in León and Zamora and connect A Coruña with central Spain. High-speed trains connect the city with Santiago de Compostela, Ourense-Empalme, Pontevedra and Vigo-Guixar. Regional lines also connect the city with Lugo, Monforte de Lemos and Ferrol.

By bus[edit]
The bus station has numerous connections both international (operated mainly by ALSA) and local, operated by (among others) Arriva Noroeste, Autos Cal Pita or Monbus. Some local connections include the immediate metropolitan area (municipalities of Oleiros, Culleredo, Sada, Betanzos...), as well as most of the Costa da Morte area, Ferrol/Rías Altas. There are relatively frequent connections with the Lugo coast (Ribadeo, Viveiro, Foz).

Get around[edit]
If you want to go along the seafront promenade (paseo marítimo), you can use the tram for €2, which will carry you from the football stadium (Riazor) to the other side of the city, near the town hall.
Taxis are white in color. If they have a green light on the top, this shows they are available for hire. A ride from the centre within the city might cost you around €5-7, depending on the traffic.
