Hammock Beach is a coastal community and resort in Flagler County, part of the First Coast region in northeast Florida. Although outside of the Palm Coast city limits, the community is part of the Palm Coast metro area, and businesses in the area use Palm Coast in their addresses. In the Hammock Beach are two significant tourist attractions: Mala Compra Plantation at Bing's Landing and Marineland, a village and theme park to the north of the resort.


Understand[edit]
The Intracoastal Waterway separates Palm Coast from Hammock Beach. Hammock Beach is therefore about half a mile wide in the east-west direction, with the Intracoastal aka Matanzas River to its west and the Atlantic Ocean to its east. Hotels and resorts are concentrated on the eastern side of the town nearest the beach. To its south, Hammock Beach is bounded by Bon Terra and Beverly Beach, while to the north it is bounded by the theme park Marineland and the county line with St. Johns County.
Hammock Beach is one the most historic beach towns in Florida, as Mala Compra Plantation was constructed in 1816. Although it was later destroyed during the Seminole Wars, excavations conducted during the late 20th and early 21st century have once again shed light on this part of Florida's history and led to the site's inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places.

Get in[edit]
FL-A1A passes through Hammock Beach from north to south. Additionally, Palm Coast Pkwy crosses the Intracoastal Waterway from Palm Coast. An offramp connects Palm Coast Pkwy to FL-A1A in a part of Hammock known as Bon Terra on some maps.

Get around[edit]
FL-A1A is the backbone of the local road network, with boulevards leading to the beaches and resorts.

29.616111-81.2033331 Mala Compra Plantation (Bing's Landing), 5862 N Oceanshore Blvd (northwest of the junction of Mala Compra Rd and FL-A1A; on the Intracoastal Waterway), ☏ +1 386 313-4020. The Mala Compra Plantation, ironically translated to "bad purchase," was constructed circa 1816 on the Matanzas River. It operated as a slave plantation owned by Joseph Marion Hernández for twenty years before it was burned by the Seminole Tribe during the Second Seminole War. Prior to the battle, the plantation included 1,500 orange trees, 80 slaves, a cotton plantation, cattle pens, oxen, and horses. The site left behind a remarkable 14,000 artifacts providing valuable insight into life in the region during the early 19th century. Excavations in 1999 were followed by inclusion of the site on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004, but little remains of the main building, which changed hands twice during the war and was destroyed by the tribe during the U.S. military's abandonment of the site in early 1836.
