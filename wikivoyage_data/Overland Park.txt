Overland Park is a city in northeastern Kansas within the Kansas City metropolitan area. It is a melting-pot of both urban and suburban living. With 197,000 residents (2020), it is one of the most affluent cities in the U.S.


Understand[edit]
Overland Park is the largest community in Johnson County.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Kansas City International Airport is about 45 minutes away and is the primary airport for the entire Kansas City metro area.

By bus[edit]
There is a bus to the overland park campus from Lawrence k-10-connector.

By car[edit]
Interstates 35, 435, and 635 with U.S. 69 pass through Overland Park.  Roads are generally uncongested and nearly all parking in the entire city is free.

Get around[edit]
North and South streets are named while East and West streets are numbered. Metcalf Ave will take you just about anywhere, although at parts, it has many lanes and is a bit confusing. Before driving on this street, make sure you know where you're going and don't drive on it during rush hour (5PM-7PM), or expect to be sitting there at least an hour.
State Line is the street directly between Kansas and Missouri, thus the name.
One strange road name is College Blvd, but is mainly due to Johnson County Community College in western Overland Park. College Blvd is 111th Street, despite the confusing name.
Also, 135th St turns into Santa Fe as you're heading West. If you happen to be on Santa Fe, that means you're no longer in Overland Park, you are in Olathe.
Overland Park lies between I-35 (north) and 199th St (south) and State Line (east) and Quivira (west).

By bus[edit]
The RideKC from Kansas City also runs in Overland Park, read more there Kansas City#Bus service. The transit stops are on google transit and searchable there, except for the k-10 connector.
