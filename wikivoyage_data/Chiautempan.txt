Railroads came to town in 1869 and the first textile plants were built in the early 20th century.

Historic train station in Chiautempan
Parque Hidalgo - The town's principal plaza is a rectangular greenspace crisscrossed with pink cobblestone paths. Built in the early 1900s, it contains a statue of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla. Hidalgo Park is a public space, it has a rectangular shape with a pink cobblestone paved façade, inside it contains a sculpture dedicated to Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla. Located at the corner of Iturbide and Manuel Saldaña.
Convento Franciscano de Nuestra Señora de los Ángeles - This is one of the oldest churches in town, with construction having begun in 1564 and completed in 1585. The church contains a number of religious oil paintings dating from the 17th and 18th centuries. The church is also known locally as Padre Jesus because of the life-size wood statue in one of the side chapels of the church. The statue dates from the 16th century. Local legend has it that the statue mysteriously came to the church shortly after it was built: a mule carrying a pine box came to the church and stubbornly refused to move. Nobody claimed the animal or knew where he came from. The friars opened the box and discovered the statue of Padre Jesus, and it has been a fixture of the church ever since.
Parroquia de Nuestra Señora del Carmen - The Church of Our Lady of Carmen is one of several early 20th century churches built in town. Construction of the church began in 1911. It contains several oil paintings by Isaac Gonzalez.
Parroquia de Santa Ana - is the largest church in Chiautempan. Built in the 17th century in a mix of architectural styles, it has an unusual façade with a representation of the sun and the moon with the choir window in the shape of a star.
Templo expiatorio de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe - Built in the early 20th century, the temple is home to a community of nuns called the Guadalupanas.
Templo de La Soledad - The church was built in the 17th century as an offering in the face of the epidemics that the city suffered. It is made from stone, adobe and brick materials. It has two towers, one with a clock, followed by three semicircular arches with bells placed in a pyramid shape.
Capilla de San Sebastián - 16th century temple, previously called "La Villita", where the Virgin of Guadalupe was venerated. It is at corner of Saldaña and Ermita de la Concepción.
Train station - the early 20th century train station (estacion de ferrocarril) has been designated by INAH as an historical landmark, though it has not been restored and looks more like an eyesore than a piece of history.
Do[edit]
La Malinche National Park is Mexico's fifth highest volcano and is a popular place to learn basic mountaineering skills. It's also great for hiking and mountain climbing. La Malinche is about 20 km by car from Chiautempan.
Buy[edit]
The city is known for the production of textiles, though the man-made fibers spewing from local  modern factories is a far cry from the handcrafted textiles that built the city's reputation. You can still find hand-woven artesanal textiles in local shops and Chiautempan is known for sarapes, blankets and similar products in colors and textures reminiscent of Saltillo.

Eat[edit]
The town is famous for its local variation on mole called mole prieto or Tlilmolli, a traditional dish served for the Toci festival. Originally made from turkey and venison, modern cooks generally use pork. Try it if you see it at a local restaurant because it's not widely served outside the region.
