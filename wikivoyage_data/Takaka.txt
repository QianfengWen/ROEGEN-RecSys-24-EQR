Takaka is the largest town and hub of Golden Bay, in the northwest corner of the South Island of New Zealand.
Agriculture and tourism are the main industries in Golden Bay, so the economy is fairly seasonal.


Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Drive over the Takaka Hill, which is also known as the Marble Mountain (because that's what its made from). A stunning drive with roughly 250 bends and stunning views over both Tasman and Golden Bays. (Which probably explains its undiscovered nature.) It is about 100 km or 1 h 40 min drive from Nelson. You can hire a rental car from Nelson Airport.

Go next[edit]
Onekaka – where the finest beer (Monkey Puzzle) and some of the tastiest grub can be found at the Mussel Inn, about 17 km past Takaka. Great place to do a little drinking, eating, making friends and listening to music.  There's a glow-worm trail across the way that's just lovely to wander through once you've had a few.
Collingwood – great beach, and the departure point for tours along Farewell Spit to the historic lighthouse on the tip
