It consists of a few villages, the largest being Siuntion asema ("Siuntio station", railway station and administrative center), Siuntion kirkonkylä ("Church village") and Sjundby. The Finnish national poet Aleksis Kivi lived in Siuntio. The municipality has a 30% Swedish-speaking minority.

Map of Siuntio


By car[edit]
From Helsinki follow highway 51 for about 50km towards Raseborg and Hanko, then turn right to the local road 115 to Siuntio. It's a 45-min drive, but watch out for the speed cameras along the highway. If you're coming from Turku, exit the motorway at Lohja, drive a few kilometres south along highway 25 and take local road 115 to Siuntio.

By train[edit]
60.14087224.2222541 Siuntio railway station (Siuntion rautatieasema), Ratapihantie. A typical early 20th century wooden railway station, renovated in 2000.   (updated Mar 2022)
Take the commuter train from Helsinki. Siuntio is served by lines Y, X and L on the Helsinki commuter rail network, for which it is one of the termini along with Helsinki railway station. The station is part of HSL fare zone D. If you're coming from Turku, either change to the commuter train in Leppävaara, Espoo, and backtrack, or get off in Karis and take a bus, as the long-distance trains no more stop in Siuntio.

By bus[edit]
See Helsinki#Get around for information about public transport fares and tickets
There are a few buses each day from Helsinki, catering to commuters. For some of the buses you need to transfer in Kirkkonummi. The current bus timetables are available at the national public transport journey planner website.

By bicycle[edit]
You can well get in by bike from the neighbouring municipalities. Traffic is generally low. If you're coming from west or east, why not bike along the historical King's Road?

Get around[edit]
See Helsinki#Get_around for information about fares and tickets
In the villages the points of interest are within walking distance from each other. However driving is definitely the best way to move around between the villages. On workdays there are a few buses a day along the main roads, but you will likely be in for a long wait. If you have time, getting around by bike or foot might be an option in the summer.
