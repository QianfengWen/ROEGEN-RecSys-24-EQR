Understand[edit]
Sainte-Agathe centre-ville
Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts is a service centre for the surrounding region: its economy is based on tourism activities that include, in the summer, horse-back riding, boating, fishing, and lakeside recreation, and in winter, cross-country skiing, dog-sled racing, skating, and ice hockey. While the train is no longer in service, there is an extensive bike path that has replaced it called "Le Petit Train Du Nord". It directly connects to other paths that extend as far as Montreal.
The town is characterized by its history and tradition of B&Bs, inns, hotels, and spas. As a growing municipality, it has a developing service area that includes a new Walmart, Super 8, and Jean Coutu (among others) strategically placed on the edge of the town so as to not affect its village atmosphere.
Canadian author Mordechai Richler set his novel The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz in Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts. Former Quebec premier Jean-Jacques Bertrand (1916 - 1973) was a native of Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts.

History[edit]
In 1849, the first European families arrived on the northern fringe of the area. Beginning in 1850, a rapid colonization of the region began. The arriving families were primarily of French Catholic background. In 1865, the land on which the church stands was donated to the parish by Dr. Luc-Eusèbe Larocque, brother of the Monsignor. Dr. Larocque had amassed a fortune in the California Gold Rush and had decided to live the life of a seigneur. He bought several farms around Lac à la Truite (Trout Lake) and area but was too kind-hearted to ask for the rents. The English Protestant community grew from the time the train first arrived in 1892.
With the completion of a railway to Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts in 1892, the town experienced a rapid increase in population. Between 1892 and 1911, spas and hospitals were established. In 1899, a tuberculosis hospital was founded by Dr. Arthur Richer. Elizabeth Wand, a nurse from New York City established a spa, which still operates as Auberge Tour du Lac. It was believed at the time that fresh mountain air could help cure tuberculosis and other pulmonary diseases. 
By 1910, many wealthy families from Montreal and northern United States had built residences along the shoreline of Lac des Sables. From the 1950s to the 1980s, the town was a popular tourist centre with large resort hotels and many shops and restaurants. In the 1980s, Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts grew as a four-season tourist destination. 
Next to Mont Tremblant, Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts has the largest population of English-speaking summer cottage residents in the Laurentians (with a smaller but still sizable winter cottage population as well, particularly on the weekends). Generations of cottagers from English Montreal, Ontario, New York, and New Jersey vacation amidst the lakes and mountains surrounding the town.
