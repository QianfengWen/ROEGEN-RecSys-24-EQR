Visitor information centre at Forest Park.
Orbost is themed as Snowy River country, and the Snowy River runs adjacent to the town centre. You can go for a walk along the river, and read about how the river is coming back to life. Those who haven't seen the Snowy for a few years will be surprised how the increased water flows from the Snowy Mountains Scheme have changed the river.
