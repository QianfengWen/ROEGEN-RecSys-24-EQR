Balıkesir is a city in the Southern Marmara Region of Turkey, which in 2020 had a population of 662,199. It's mostly modern but has several old mosques. 


Understand[edit]
The town is on the main trade route from Istanbul to Izmir, so it's been settled from antiquity. In Roman times circa 124 AD there was a hunting lodge and small town somewhere around the present football stadium. It became known as "Old Castle", in Greek "Palaeokastron" and in Turkish "Balukiser", and grew into the provincial capital. Very little remains of these times, as in 1898 there was a devastating earthquake, so what you see now is mostly modern.
The area is hilly but fertile, so Balıkesir has industries based on dairy, wheat, olives, sunflower oil and other agriculture. It quarries limestone and borax (sodium borate), which has a remarkable range of uses such as cleaning. Balıkesir has a university and as one of the "Anatolian Tiger" towns continues to develop new industries.

By plane[edit]
International visitors will find it most convenient to fly into either of the Istanbul airports and take overland transport or a ferry. 
Edremit Airport has been re-named Balıkesir Koca Seyit Airport (EDO IATA) but you might wonder if "Koca Seyit" is Turkish for "nowhere near". (Actually it's "Corporal Seyit", the gunner hero of Gallipoli.) It's 100 km west of town, with daily flights from Istanbul and once a week from Ankara. The airports at Bursa and Çanakkale are just as inconvenient and sparsely served.
Balıkesir Merkez Airport is 5 km southeast of town but even less convenient, as it has a military airbase but no commercial flights and is regarded as an expensive joke.

By train[edit]
Balıkesir is at the junction of two railways. All your patience will be needed to use them, and there are no plans to extend the YHT high speed trains to town.
From Ankara the İzmir Mavi Treni (Blue Train) runs nightly, taking nine hours via Eskişehir and Kütahya. From Balıkesir it takes another four hours via Manisa and Soma to Izmir. Ege Ekspresi is a daytime train on the section between Izmir and Eskişehir, which has YHT trains from Istanbul, Ankara and Konya.
Also from Izmir, 6 Eylül Ekspresi (6th of September) runs daily via Manisa and Soma, continuing north from Balıkesir to Bandırma on the coast (another two hours). When it returns south from Bandırma it's called 17 Eylül Ekpresi (17th of September) but even TCDD can't dawdle for ten days: it departs at 16:00, so you can connect with the ferry from Istanbul.
See Turkish State Railways TCDD[dead link] for timetables, fares and online tickets. 
The 39.647127.88841 railway station is on Cumhuriyet Meydanı at the east edge of downtown. Across the highway from the station is the old bus terminal, Eski Garaj, focus of local transport.

By bus[edit]
Balıkesir is on the main route between Istanbul and Izmir, so it has a service every 30 min with competing companies. These buses take six hours via Gebze and Bursa for a fare of 200 TL, and continue south via Akhisar and Manisa to Izmir (another 3 hours, 70 TL). Bus lines include Metro Turizm, Pamukkale and Flixbus. 
The 39.677327.94222 Otogar is 5 km northeast of town along Bandirma Cd D220. Buses ply frequently to Eski Garaj the old bus terminal north side of the railway station.

By car[edit]
Balıkesir is near motorway O5 from Gebze (for Istanbul and Ankara via O7) via Bursa, continuing south to Izmir.

Get around[edit]
Walk: most places of tourist interest are within 500 m of the railway station and clock tower.
Local bus and dolmuş lines radiate from Eski Garaj by the railway station.

Zağnos Paşa Mosque
39.645327.87921 Clock Tower (Saat Kulesi) is the focal point of the city, on Anafartalar Cd. It's described as a copy of Istanbul's Galata Tower, which is cylindrical and doesn't remotely resemble this Italianate tower which ought to grace a railway terminus. The original of 1827 was destroyed by the earthquake of 1898 but it was rebuilt to the same design.
 Balıkesir National Forces Museum (Balıkesir Kuva-yi Milliye Müzesi), Anafartalar Cd 58 (by clock tower), ☏ +90 266 243 3181. Daily 08:30-17:30. Kuva-yı Milliye were an irregular force assembled in 1919 in the wake of Greek troop landings in Smyrna. They were the main resistance until 1920, when they were absorbed into the regular army fighting for Turkish independence. Hostilities ended with the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. This former mansion house was their headquarters. Later it became Balıkesir town hall, but the council vacated in 1986 and it was converted into a museum. This displays documents, personal items and photos of the fighters, and photos of Kemal Atatürk visiting the city. Archaeological and ethnographic findings from the region are exhibited upstairs.   (updated Apr 2022)
Ömer Ali Bey Yazma Eser Kütüphanesi is a reference library of early Ottoman books and manuscripts, for serious scholars only by prior arrangement. It's by the clock tower.

Umurbey Mosque is fairly simple. It was built in 1413 and repaired in 1635 and 1925. It's 200 m west of the railway station.
39.648627.87972 Zagnos Pasha Mosque (Zağnos Paşa Camii), Turan Cd. This was built around 1461 by Zağnos Pasha, grand vizier of Mehmed II, as a religious complex. The hammam survived the earthquake of 1897, while the mosque, tombs and shadirvans (decorative ablutions fountains) were rebuilt. The engravings on the minbar - pulpit - are especially fine; Atatürk himself preached a sermon here in 1923. The tombs of Karesi Bey and his five sons are south side of the mosque. He founded the Karasid dynasty or emirate, which ruled Southern Marmara 1297–1360 until engulfed by the nascent Ottoman Empire. Free.   (updated Apr 2022)
39.650527.8833 Yıldırım Mosque. This was built by Sultan Bayezid I in 1388. A couple of years later he built the similar Yıldırım or Bayezid mosque in Bursa. Free. (updated Apr 2022)
39.648527.88684 Devril Erbil Contemporary Art Museum (Devrim Erbil Çağdaş Sanatlar Müzesi Kent Arşivi), Gazi Bv. M-F 08:30-17:30. The stated opening hours are just a token of good intentions. (updated Apr 2022)
Old houses: town centre is modern. A few higgledy-piggledy streets with traditional houses survive in the Aygoren and Karaoglan neighbourhoods east of Atatürk Park.
39.656927.85125 Atatürk House, Edremit Cd, ☏ +90 533 050 9079. Tu-F 09:00-17:00, Sa Su 10:00-17:00. Opened in 2021, this is a replica of the house where Atatürk was born in Thessaloniki, and depicts events of the War of Independence. (updated Apr 2022)
Kuş Lake: see Bandırma for this birdlife reserve on the road north to the coast.
39.7527.5833066 Balya  is a town 50 km northwest on the scenic mountain road to Çanakkale (D555/210). Today, it's a struggling community of 2,000 people, but back in its heyday, it was home to about 20-30,000 thanks to the lucrative business created by its lead and zinc mines. In the 19th century, a French company got a concession to exploit the ore, but in the 1930s, the economically extractable portion of it by the technology of that time was running out so the company left and the town has never recovered since. When the mines were active, Balya had the earliest public electricity supply anywhere in Turkey, and it also saw the earliest use of cyanide processing in the world, so there are still patches of ground any grass barely grows and some of the local streams still run acidic, even almost a century after the end of the practice. The main mining heritage is to the north of the town, around the road to Gönen. Follow the brown signpost at the turn-off 1 km north of the town to arrive at the atmospheric shell of a stone building overgrown by pine forest. The signboard on site doesn't mention what purpose it served, but it's safe to assume that it was some kind of administrative building. The ruins of the actual extraction and processing units are just behind the corner and are far more extensive: shells of much larger buildings cascading down the hillside and those of what seems to be furnaces on the level ground beneath. As of Jan 2023, this area is messy as it's once more developed for further mining. Back on the main road, about 350 m north of the turn-off is a pair of derelict villas, one on each side of the road, known locally as Fransız evleri ("French houses") — perhaps residential quarters for the white collar.

Drink[edit]
Suma is a fiery spirit drunk in Balıkesir
Rakı is Turkey's national drink, the aniseed-flavoured twice-distilled spirit similar to anise, ouzo, sambuca and arak. The first distillation produces a fiery spirit called suma, and in Balıkesir there's a tradition of drinking this. Visitors who wish to avoid concussion should await the second distillation, the standard commercial rakı at 40% abv strength - Manisa near Izmir is where most of it is made.
Ayran is a cold savoury yoghurt drink found throughout the Turkic regions and the local brand is called Hisar ("fortress") Ayran. It's often drunk to accompany rice and meat. Under no circumstances display any signs of sleepiness after quaffing it. In 2015 the President in his wisdom declared this to be a national insult, when an advert for tea dissed ayran in that way.
