Haridwar (Hindi: हरिद्वार Haridvār), also spelt Hardwar, is a Hindu pilgrimage site at the Ganges River, in the Indian state of Uttarakhand.


Understand[edit]
Har Ki Pauri
Haridwar (huh-rihd-wahr) literally means the Gateway to God, is one of the Hindu holy places in India and a centre of Hindu religion and mysticism for centuries.  Located on the banks of the River Ganges (Ganga), at the point where the Ganges descends from the hills to the North Indian plains, Haridwar attracts a large number of Hindu pilgrims from all over the world.

Get in[edit]
Haridwar is about 200 km from Delhi, the capital of India and is well connected by road and rail network from all parts of India. Although the town is nicely connected by train and bus, you should remember to book in advance, especially during pilgrimage season.
It is better to avoid travelling to Haridwar during the Hindu month of Sawan (around July) since there is a heavy crowd and all important roads are blocked and most of the hotels, buses, and trains are crowded. It is also not good choice to visit this place during the monsoon season (late May to August) as the rain will hinder your visit.
To travel from Delhi to Haridwar you can rent a car or private taxi. You can also prefer to go by train as frequent trains are available and those are less costly as compared to private cabs.

By plane[edit]
Dehradun's Jolly Grant Airport is nearest airport to Haridwar. It is domestic airport 20 km away from the city centre. Taxis from the airport to Haridwar cost ₹400. Frequent flights from Delhi are available as well.
Around 200 km away, Delhi is the nearest international airport, which is well connected to domestic and foreign airports.

By bus[edit]
Haridwar's bus station, close to the train station, is chaotic and has no signage whatsoever in English.  There are regular bus services from Delhi (theoretically 4 hours), Rishikesh (one hour) and other important towns of North India to Haridwar.  Before booking the bus check the bus condition. Always go for cushioned and push-back seats. The long and bumpy ride will take a toll on your mood and body.
As there is shortage of AC buses during summer vacations so always go before 1 or 1.5 hour your suitable time so as to get the prior reservation.

Haridwar, the holy city is one of the most renowned pilgrimage centres in India. Pilgrims from all over the world flock to this sacred city to take a dip in the holy waters of River Ganga. Being a destination for pilgrimage tourism, shopping in Haridwar is not on the itinerary of the tourist.

Stay safe[edit]
During festivals, especially the Kumbh Mela, Haridwar is packed to bursting and beyond.  Stampedes are a regular occurrence, with over 50 killed in 1986, 21 killed in 2003 and 5 killed in 2010; the bridges across the Ganges are the most dangerous spot.
Alcohol is strictly banned in Haridwar. So don't get trapped in any illegal alcohol consumption as no one wants to end his journey in prison.
Similar to other holy places, Haridwar has significant number of beggars and charlatans. Watch out for the motives of Sadhus trying to offer some one-to-one tutoring in return of money.  Beware of greedy monkeys which may attack anytime to grab food from your hands. Be watchful when you walk, as cows and their abundant leftovers can be seen on the roads.
