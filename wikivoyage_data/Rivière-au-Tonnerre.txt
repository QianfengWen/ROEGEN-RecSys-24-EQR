Understand[edit]
The municipality of Rivière-au-Tonnerre is actually made up of two villages on the North Shore: Sheldrake and Rivière-au-Tonnerre. The place, meaning "Thunder River" is so called because of a series of waterfalls of about 50 metres (160 ft) on a tributary of the St. Lawrence whose crash recalls the sound of thunder. Together, in 2016, the villages had a total population of less than 300 inhabitants.

History[edit]
The first settlers to settle permanently in this place arrived around 1853 or 1854 and founded Sheldrake and Rivière-au-Tonnerre as fishing villages. In 1875 more settlers arrived. They came mainly from Paspébiac in Gaspésie. In 1890, the post office opened in Rivière-au-Tonnerre, but it was called Thunder River. The name was Frenchified in 1933.
