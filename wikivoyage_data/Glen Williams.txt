"Beautiful spot! A perfect oasis in the leafy desert...." Such were the first impressions of a traveller who arrived in the Glen in 1847. Glen Williams is a tiny village, a hamlet, in the Credit River valley just north of Georgetown, a 45 minute drive west of Toronto. The Glen is part of Halton Hills in the Halton Regional Municipality.
Today the "perfect oasis" takes considerable pride in its legacy of well-constructed buildings, its long manufacturing history and its sense of community (an irreplaceable commodity these days).
If you like art, crafts, antiques, and well-preserved heritage buildings, then you’re going to love this place. In the Glen you can visit artists' studios at the Williams Mill Visual Arts Centre, housed in former grist and sawmills, and shop for antiques in the Beaumont Mill, another industrial heritage building.  You can go for a hike.  You can watch artists at work, see glass blown, take a class, have a beer in the pub. You can build a canoe (really!)
Throw in some charming rural scenery and a few tasty, cosy country places to eat, and you’re all set for a perfect girlfriend getaway or a great romantic weekend retreat.

Origins[edit]
The Glen has nestled at this quiet place in the Credit River Valley since 1825.  Founded by hardworking Loyalists who harnessed the power of the local stream to run saw and flour mills.  They kept at it, built bobbin mills, grist mills, woollen mills, knitting mills. They build beautiful brick homes for their families out of locally made brick. They built a Town Hall, churches, shops, stores, a tannery, a post office.  They built a community.
