Cley next the Sea is a small village with a high street in Norfolk. It lies in the North Norfolk Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, near the mouth of the River Glaven. Cley lies roughly midway between the towns Wells-next-the-Sea and Sheringham. The village is home to a beach, which extends eastwards to Blakeney Point, Britain's largest grey seal colony, which is named after the neighbouring village.


Understand[edit]
Cley lies on the A149 Norfolk Coast Road. The village is surrounded by rare habitats for protected species.
The River Glaven is a habitat for the critically endangered European Eel (Anguilla Anguilla). They breed in the Sargasso Sea near Bermuda and return to Europe for much of their lives. Their population has fallen by around 95% in the last 40 years, according to the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust.
Norfolk Wildlife Trust's Cley and Salthouse Marshes were purchased in 1926 to be held "in perpetuity as a bird breeding sanctuary". It is a 300-hectare coastal reserve and birdwatching site. The marshes are homes for avocet, spoonbill, lapwing, bittern, wigeon and marsh harrier.
Blakeney National Nature Reserve - a National Trust reserve - is named after the neighbouring village of Blakeney. It is a breeding ground for the tern in summer and grey seals in the winter. The grey seals reside at Blakeney Point all year 'round. Visitors can access Blakeney Point on ferry trips, departing from Morston Quay. Access on foot is via a footpath from Cley Beach, but dog restrictions apply throughout the spring and summer for bird nesting season.
Cley was recorded in the Domesday Book, with 38 households in 1086.
Cley Harbour is a former port, and a restoration project is underway after it was left stranded by the receding North Sea. According to quay custodians, the harbour was reported to have been "in the grip of organised gangs of pirates" in 1317. In the 1600s, trade with today's Benelux region - the Low Countries. The port became a major outlet for North Norfolk farm produce, particularly grain, until its demise in the 1800s. The Custom House closed in 1853.

Map of Cley next the Sea
Cley is a very small village. There is car parking at the village hall and at the beach. These car parks are signposted.
Although it is easy to get around by foot, some roads are narrow and drivers must share the carriageway with pedestrians, including on the A149 High Street.
Cobbled and narrow streets may prove difficult for some wheelchair or pushchair users, but not impossible.
Cley Beach is roughly one mile from the village centre. The Norfolk Coast Path connects both locations and is signposted. Blakeney Point is roughly one mile from Cley Beach and is only accessible on foot from the village. Dog restrictions may apply in bird nesting season. Ferry tours depart from Morston Quay, in the next village.
