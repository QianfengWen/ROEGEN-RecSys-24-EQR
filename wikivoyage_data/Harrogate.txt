Harrogate is an attractive Regency / Victorian spa town in North Yorkshire, with fine public gardens, and on the edge of the Yorkshire Dales. Its spa hotels have morphed into conference and "wellness" centres, and it's well stocked with good eating places, including the famous Betty's Tea Rooms. In 2024 the population was 164,100.


Understand[edit]
In Old Norse hǫrgr gata indicates a street to a heap of stones. It was a cluster of separate villages until its spa waters became fashionable in the 17th century, and accommodation and amusements were built for its visitors. (Those amusements were essential, as the waters are cold and pungent.) Harrogate's heyday was 19th century Regency / Victorian, so it was already past its best when Agatha Christie fled here in 1926. Meanwhile it was becoming industrial, and a commuter town for nearby Leeds. However the local council realised the value of protecting Harrogate's old centre, so this retains its period charm with relatively few modern intrusions. 

Get in[edit]

By plane[edit]
53.866-1.6611 Leeds-Bradford International Airport (LBA IATA). This is actually more accessible from Harrogate than it is from Leeds or Bradford, as it lies north of those cities and you dodge most of the traffic on the approach; so flying to London (by BA to Heathrow LHR5) can beat the train. LBA has good connections from western Europe, e.g. Dublin, Amsterdam, Düsseldorf, Paris and Brussels, as well as domestic flights from Southampton, Exeter and Belfast. The budget carrier Jet2 is based here. Bus 737 connects LBA to Harrogate town centre. (updated Apr 2024)
From beyond western Europe, use Manchester Airport (MAN IATA). It has global connections, competitive fares, and an hourly train from Leeds.
Flying into any of the London airports involves a one-hour journey into London Kings Cross, then a 3-hour train ride north.

By train[edit]
53.9933-1.53742 Harrogate station stands on a loop of line from Leeds (35 minutes) to York (40 minutes via Knaresborough). Direct trains from London Kings Cross run every two hours, taking 3 hours via Stevenage, Grantham, Doncaster,  Wakefield and Leeds. 
From other destinations change at Leeds or York for the loop train, which runs every 30 min. At Leeds this is shown as going to Poppleton, a small halt just outside York, to avoid travellers for York going the long way round. Similarly at York, it's shown as going to Burley Park in the Headingley / University quarter of Leeds.
Harrogate station is central in town and has a staffed ticket office and machines. There are toilets, a waiting room, a cafe and ATMs. There is step-free access to all platforms. Plusbus tickets are available for this station.

By road[edit]
From the north, follow the A1 then A59 west then bypass Knaresborough via A658 and A661. From the south, the signed route is the same, but consider leaving A1 sooner at Junction 45 into Wetherby and going via A661. From the south end of Leeds use the new A63 to join M1 which merges into A1 then heads towards Wetherby; but from northern or central Leeds just go straight up the A61.

By bus[edit]
Long-distance bus lines no longer run to Harrogate, change at Leeds.
From Leeds take Harrogate Bus 36 (the plum-red one), which runs every 15 minutes, taking 70 min via the A61 past Harewood House. Alternate buses continue to Ripon. Bus 7 from Leeds takes twice as long, via Bramham, Boston Spa, Wetherby and Spofforth. 
From Bradford Bus A2 runs hourly via the airport, taking 75 min.
From Knaresborough Bus 1 runs every 30 min, taking 30 min via Starbeck. 
From Pateley Bridge Bus 24 runs every two hours, taking 55 min. 
No direct bus runs from York, change at Leeds. Bus 23 / 24 from York to Knaresborough rambles through more Yorkshire villages than you'd think possible. 
Harrogate bus station is 100 yards north of the railway station. It's just a long draughty bus shelter with no facilities.

Get around[edit]
Walking is best for town centre, and cycling will quickly get you to outlying attractions. Avoid driving in town, as it can be very congested.
Harrogate Buses circulate around town. Bus 1 plies the main road to Knaresborough.
The trains from Leeds also stop at Pannal and Hornbeam Park in the south of town, and at Starbeck on their way to Knaresborough.
The most reliable taxi operator is Mainline (+44 44 1423 555555).

Betty's Tea Rooms
Town centre: Simply strolling the central streets and arcades is a joy.

 Royal Pump Room Museum, Crown Place HG1 2RY (next to The Crown), ☏ +44 1423 556188. W-Su 10AM-4PM. This celebrates the town's spa heyday. The original Spa is a town in Belgium: Harrogate's natural spring waters were discovered circa 1571 to have similar composition. Add in a Georgian / Victorian social scene, the invention of railways and leisure travel, and oodles of publicity, and here you are. The mineral-rich springs are variously of "chalybeate" (iron) and of sulphur. Do taste some: it's the sulphur that you're destined to remember. Adult £4, conc or child £3.   (updated Apr 2024)

Many of the historic town springs emerge in this area, though they're nowadays mostly capped off or bottled.

Sleep[edit]
Mystery solved: Agatha Christie wasn't dead but hiding at the Old Swan Hotel
As a spa town, many Harrogate hotels date back 200 years, and you can aim to stay somewhere with real character. There are many modern chains within a mile or two, while B&Bs are in the leafy suburbs further out. 
Harrogate does a lot of corporate and event accommodation and can become booked out, especially for the Great Yorkshire Show in July. Big events in York can have the same effect. If you can't get in, consider staying in central Leeds and day-tripping by train.
