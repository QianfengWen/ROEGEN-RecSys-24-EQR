Clock tower in Tecozautla
Tecozautla is a small town in the Central Mexican state of Hidalgo. It is a colonial town with narrow streets and a colorful town square set in a valley with dramatic mountain scenery of sheer cliffs, volcanic cones, and hills covered with desert vegetation. Tecozautla is one of Mexico's Pueblos Magicos and is a popular weekend retreat. If colonial charm isn't reason enough to visit, there's a cool but seldom visited archaeological site where you can still climb the pyramids, and the town is known for its geothermal mineral springs, which feed several nearby waterparks and spas.

Pahñú archaeological site
 Pahñú Archaeological Site. 09:00 - 16:00. One of only 5 sites known to have been used by the Xajay culture, a little known indigenous group who were evidently related to the Otomi and who paid tribute to Teotihuacan. The biggest building at Pahnu is the Pyramid of Xiuhtecuhtli. It's fairly large, but it won't impress you if you've been to big sites like Teotihuacan. However, while many Mexican archaeological sites have been closing off structures so visitors could no longer climb them, visitors can still climb the steps of Pyramid of Xihtecuhtli and admire the panoramic vistas of the arid valley. A small site museum displays relics from the site. M$75.
