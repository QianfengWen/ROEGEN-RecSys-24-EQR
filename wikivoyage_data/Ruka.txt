Ruka is a ski resort and village near Kuusamo in the Oulu province of northern Finland.
Rukatunturi's highest point is 492 m. The longest run in the mountain is 1,300 m. In winter Ruka is the place to be for people who love winter sports. In summer time Ruka welcomes people to enjoy the beautiful nature, for example as a base for hiking the Karhunkierros trail or shorter hikes in the Ruka area.


Understand[edit]
Ruka Ski resort
Ruka is part of the Kuusamo municipality, with the centre Kuusamo and the airport some 23 km to the south.
Ruka got its first dauntless downhill skiers already in the 1930s, but it took until 1954 before the first prepared slope, the modern day Front Slope, was opened. The first ski lift was opened three years later, and a hotel-restaurant Kaltiomaja opened in 1962. Since then the resort has been steadily growing and the modern, pedestrian friendly centre was completed in 2010. The resort has been owned and developed by the Finnish company Aho Group since 1974.
Ruka offers the longest skiing season out of any resort in Finland, over 200 days a year. The First Snow Track (Ensilumenlatu) is opened in early October and the slopes stay open until early May. The resort is mostly a winter sports centre, but since the 2000s Ruka has been developed and marketed as a summer destination as well.
Ruka is the second most popular ski resort in Finland (after Levi) having 23,000 beds, 35 slopes, 125 kilometres of cross-country ski tracks, some 30 restaurants, and 549,000 registered nights a year (in 2018–2019).

Get in[edit]
The simplest way to get to Ruka is to fly to Kuusamo and take the airport bus to Ruka. If you travel by train from southern Finland, the nearest train stations are in Oulu, Rovaniemi and Kemijärvi; also Kajaani may be an option. From there, take a bus to Kuusamo. You can bring your car on some of the trains. Driving from southern Finland will take around 10 hours.

Get around[edit]
The new Ruka Pedestrian Village was finished in November 2010. You can now walk to the slopes from the hotels without any road crossings. Also Talvijärvi is close to the slopes. Some accommodations are some 5 km away, more suitable for those coming for cross-country skiing or other activities.

By bus[edit]
There are two coach connections a day on weekdays between Kuusamo and Ruka. There is also a dial-a-ride service available from Kuusamo to Ruka. It can be ordered using Matkahuolto Trip Planner and Tickets mobile app. The passenger can pick up the ride up to five days, can check availability at any time, and secure the ride as well as the seat just by ordering transportation. The app always shows the final binding price before confirming the order. 

By taxi[edit]
Smartphone app: Taksini is available from App Store and Google Play. Other apps: Valopilkku, 02 Taksi.

See[edit]
Aurora borealis
Although the highest hills here are often referred to as fells, there are no true fells here. However, the adjacent peaks of Ruka massif are by far the tallest hills around. The views from Valtavaara are well-known. Also the views from Juhannuskallio and from Konttainen are very nice. You can also enjoy the views from Ruka. In Juhannuskallio there are also caves, the biggest one known as Pirunkirkko ("Devil's church").

Fells
66.21229.21281 Konttainen. Peak 407 metres a.sl., about half a kilometre from the popular hiking trail Karhunkierros. The northernmost peak in the Ruka massif belongs to Valtavaara-Pyhävaara Nature Protection Area. 
66.186729.19172 Valtavaara. The peak at 492 metres is famous for its views. A lush Surmanoro gorge (up to 40 m deep) is located here, on the north-west side of the hill. There is a "lapp pole hut" and a day hut on the peak. Belongs to Valtavaara-Pyhävaara Nature Protection Area. 
66.165529.15143 Rukatunturi. Climbing up to 500 meters a.sl, Ruka is the highest hill around. Even though it isn't a true fell, human action has once turned the top into a treeless heath, and there are great views to surrounding landscape. The hiking trail Karhunkierros starts from here and heads to the north. 
66.133129.15414 Pyhävaara. Peak 461 m a.sl. The southernmost peak in the Ruka massif belongs to Valtavaara-Pyhävaara Nature Protection Area, and is assumed to have been a sacred place – a sieidi – to the Sami people. Avoid leaving the marked trail as the rocky terrain might be dangerous and there are some very rare plants growing around. There is a "lapp pole hut" on top of the secondary peak Pikku Pyhävaara. 
Do[edit]
Cross-country skiing, noon in February
In winter the ski resort offers are the main things to do in Ruka. There is also a large cross-country skiing route network (90 km). In summer the beautiful nature provides a lot to do, e.g. visiting Valtavaara-Pyhävaara Nature Reserve[dead link].

The other end of the trail is at Karhunkierros visitor centre in Hautajärvi or e.g. at Kuntakkivaara. Being popular and well maintained the trail is suited also for less experienced hikers, but map and basic survival skills are needed and the terrain is hilly. The suspension bridges are not suited for dogs. There are eight open wilderness huts along the trail, free but often crowded in season (and due to the popularity of the trail, first come first served prevails, rather than latecomers' rights). In summer basic food can be bought each other day with normal speed. It is recommended that water be had at service points or treated (boiled) before drinking. There is an ultra running competition along the trail (83 km) yearly in May (winner times: men 08 hr 20 min, women 10:30). There are also shorter versions of Karhunkierros, 18–31 km.
