Understand[edit]
Trogir is on the UNESCO World Heritage List as it is one of the best preserved medieval towns in Europe. It is a fascinating place to just wander and also contains a range of accommodation. The town is benefitting from massive investments.
Trogir is a jewel of a town encased in 15th-century walls. Tiny medieval streets wind through the enchanting town revealing hidden restaurants and eye-catching galleries. A wide seaside promenade snakes around the town, culminating in a charming port full of sailboats waiting to take you to the islands of Drvenik Mali and Drvenik Veli with their pristine sand beaches and secluded coves. Stretching out from the main land of Trogir to either side is an infinite number of beautiful beaches. A pleasing blend of Romanesque and Renaissance architecture. Trogir is a delightful little town from which to explore Central Dalmatia.
