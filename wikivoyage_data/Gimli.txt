History[edit]
The first European settlers in Gimli were Canadian Icelanders, moving west from Ontario to the region they called "New Iceland".
Volcanic eruptions in Iceland soon spurred additional immigration. In 1875 300 people left Iceland, arrived in Ontario and took a ship to Duluth, from there they made their way to Grand Forks, North Dakota, and took a steamer up to the mouth of the Assinboine. 75-100 people stayed in the Winnipeg area while the rest made their way to Lake Winnipeg and onto boats; they landed south of Gimli at Willow Island and then walked the rest of the way. A second group of approximately 800 would follow in their footsteps the next year.
The Canadian Pacific Railway reached Gimli in 1906 and soon the town and surrounding region became a tourist and vacation destination for people from Winnipeg. By the 1930s the south shore area of Gimli began to see cottages replacing farmland. With 68 km (42 mi) of shoreline on Lake Winnipeg, Gimli is a popular fishing destination in summer.
During World War II an area west of the community was appropriated by the Royal Canadian Air Force to construct a training facility. RCAF Station Gimli was opened in 1943 and remained in operation until 1945. The Station was reactivated in 1950 and was closed again in 1971.

The public beachfront is lovely for barefoot sunset walks on the water.

 Icelandic Festival (Islendingadagurinn). An annual festival held in early August, Islendingadagurinn celebrates the fact that Manitoba is home to the largest Icelandic population in the world outside of Iceland. The festivities include a film festival, a music festival, and daily Viking battle re-enactments. You can become an honorary Icelander by eating dried fish and knocking back a shot of Icelandic schnapps. Watch or compete in the Islendingadunk, in which two combatants sit on a soap-lubricated plastic pole suspended over the water. Each tries to bat their opponent off the pole and into the water using a wet sack filled with sponge. (updated Feb 2021)
