Marathon is a town of 3,100 people (2021) on the north shore of Lake Superior in Northern Ontario.  It is the largest town on the Trans-Canada Highway between Sault Ste Marie and Thunder Bay.


Understand[edit]
Marathon Pulp Mill, operated 1946-2009
Marathon's resource economy was built on wood pulp. In 2009, the Marathon Pulp Mill was shut down indefinitely shutdown, eliminating hundreds of jobs from the region. Starting in the mid-1980s Marathon's economy expanded to include gold mining.

History[edit]
As long ago as 500 BC the area was inhabited by Ojibway First Nations (Indigenous) people who lived along the Pic River. Their descendents still live in the area.
Marathon was born as a railway community named Peninsula, due to its location on a peninsula on Lake Superior.
The pulp mill was constructed between 1944 and 1946, the population rose to 2,500, and the town's name was changed, first to Everest - after D.C. Everest, president of Marathon Corporation of Wisconsin, owners of the pulp mill in the town - then, later that year, to Marathon, in honor of the paper company. The Everest name was discarded because it was too similar to Everett, Ontario.
In the early 1980s, gold was discovered at Hemlo, an uninhabited area adjacent to the Trans Canada highway some 40 km east of Marathon. By the late 1980s, three mines were running at Hemlo, with two of the three mines locating their employees in Marathon, which effectively doubled its population and made it the largest town along the North Shore between Sault Ste. Marie and Thunder Bay.
