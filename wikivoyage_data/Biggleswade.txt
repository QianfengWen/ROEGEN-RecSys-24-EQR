By car[edit]
Biggleswade is on the A1, about 10 mi (16 km) north of the end of the Southern Section of the A1(M).  It is therefore well connected to London, the M25, Hertfordshire, Peterborough and the North.  The A14 passes North of Biggleswade, linking the A1 to East Anglia and the East Midlands.
Smaller roads link the town to Bedford and Cambridge.
By bike[edit]
The A1 is not a very cycle-friendly road; other, smaller roads in the area are far more so.
There are several bridle paths linking Biggleswade to surrounding towns, which are passable for mountain and hybrid bikes.
The National Cycle Network Route 51 is due to be extended from Biggleswade to Sandy and Hitchin, using some of these bridle paths and minor roads.
The old Sandy—Bedford railway line nearby is now a dedicated cycle route (National Cycle Network Route 51).
