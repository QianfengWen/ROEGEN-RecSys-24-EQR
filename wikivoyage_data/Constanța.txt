Constanța (pronounced Con-stan-tza) is a coastal Black Sea city in southern part of Northern Dobruja, Romania, the second most important city in the country and, during summer, a somewhat tourist city. It is the capital of the Constanța county and the Black Sea's largest seaport, a great city to begin to explore the wonders of the sea.

Understand[edit]
Constanța, being founded as a city almost 2,600 years ago, is the oldest attested city in Romania, the biggest port on the Black Sea and also the fourth-largest city in Romania, with 400,000 inhabitants. It was founded by the Greeks as a port on the Black Sea Coast for trading with inland people and called Tomis (6th c. BC). The city was renamed later after Constantina, niece of Constantine the Great (274–337). It was still a flourishing port city in the 10th and 11th centuries, trading with the Byzantine Empire and the city of Genoa.

Also, frequent minibuses leave from the bus station at the railway station to resorts south of Constanța.

By taxi[edit]
A legal taxi must be painted yellow and have the fee written with green or black characters on the driver's door.

The typical fee is 1.79 lei/km during the day; 2.15 lei/km during the night, and 2.75 lei/km outside the city limits (October 2011). You can ask in advance the taxi driver how much does he think the ride will cost. If it is more than €10 do not accept. Taxis do not accept credit card payments.

Located on the western shore, the complex was built in three terraces and connects the city and the ancient port. The monumental building (with over 2,000 m² of mosaic) was erected in the 4th century AD, probably under Emperor Constantine the Great, being repaired at various stages by the end of the 6th century, when their existence ends, falling in decay ruin with the commercial activities of the city. From the original 2,000 m² area still maintains about 700 m², but enough to infer that we are in front of a large port construction. Upper terrace was occupied by an impressive hall (100 m long and 20 m wide), probably covered in antiquity, with a huge dome supported by pillars. From this room there are still today part of the long wall and one of the side walls.

Parks[edit]

Do[edit]
Walk – You can stroll the city's streets, the historical peninsular area which has a special charm, the sea coast, the Tomis marina or one of the many parks, on the lake-side or through the ruins of the ancient Greek colony Tomis.
Beach – You can sunbathe or swim in the Black Sea. There is a large beach called Modern right in the middle of the city, which is favored by locals and is near the marina. Very very shallow waters (you can walk for 20–30 meters and the water won't pass your knees) so it's suited if you want to take your kids there and let them play safely in the water.
The best beaches are in the Mamaia resort which is in the north part of Constanța. It consists of about 6-7 km of sandy beaches with absolutely no rocks; the width of the beaches vary from 20 to 150 m. It's also full of hotels, clubs and bars and extremely popular and fashionable in the summer. Moreover, in the off season (September–April) they are a great place for taking pictures walks, or rides with the ATV or enduro motorcycle and there are some centers for renting ATVs near the Cleopatra bar at the beginning of the resort. If you arrive by car not registered in the county of Constanța from May/June to September expect to pay an entrance fee of 3 lei at the entrance ticket booth for your car. The ratio of free parking/paid parking is around 25%/75% and the parking lots with the fee are guarded and not that expensive (3 lei per hour) and a good alternative especially if you are on a motorcycle because people will climb your bike to take pictures on it. The paid parking places are marked with a white P on a blue background. The unpaid parking lots are on the sides of the main boulevard.
Football – Farul (meaning "lighthouse") play soccer in Liga 1, Romania's top tier. Their home ground is Stadionul Viitorul (capacity 4550) in Ovidiu 10 km north of city centre.
Resorts – To the south are a string of summer resorts: Eforie Nord/sud, Costinesti, Neptun, Olimp. Neptun is recommended because it has a more relaxed atmosphere and for its lush forests that end near the sea.

Stay safe[edit]
Constanța is a pretty safe city even by European standards, but as a precaution avoid taking taxis near the train station and insist that they turn the meter on. If you visit the historical peninsular area at night, try to do this in a group. Unlike some other cities in Romania, people from Constanța are well used to foreigners and are generally helpful. Walking at night is okay even alone, though you should avoid walking with your camera around your neck and be mindful of pick pockets when using public transportation. Your religion is not of concern since a lot of locals come from very different ethnic and religious backgrounds, but refrain from commenting on religious matters. The local Muslim population is pretty secular and don't have a problem with western culture or habits.
Stay away from dodgy small casinos and avoid exchange offices especially those located in Mamaia. They have hidden commission (written with small letters) or separate exchange rates for travel checks and cash. Use only trusted exchange offices, like Balkan Exchange. If you are unsure go to a bank, Your best bet is to exchange money at banks, which are located throughout the city. Although banks don't have good exchange rates, they are still better than the rip-offs).
As with Bucharest and other big cities in Romania your biggest safety concern could come from feral dogs. If confronted by a group of barking dogs don't lose your cool and back away since they are usually territorial and won't chase you. If they get too close, pretend you are picking a rock from the ground. Whatever you do, don't run.
Women will not be permitted access in churches or mosques if they wear short skirts.

Connect[edit]
Constanța has 4G from all Romanian carriers. As of Aug 2022, there is patchy 5G from Digi and Vodafone, and wide coverage of 5G from Orange. 

Go next[edit]
Vama Veche – To the south, close to the Bulgarian border is a former hippie/bohemian beach village turned into a commercial venture over the years but still one of the few places on the Romanian coast where camping is still hip (although there have been agents patrolling the beaches asking for a 10 lei fee from people they find at the tent. Just say it's not your tent and you'll go look for the person who's tent you are watching. They'll go bother someone else.)
Limanu cave – Near Mangalia there is a 3,200 m long cave unique in Romania. The only way to reach it is by personal car. Entrance to the cave is closed off but there are some phone numbers on the door that will get you in touch with a guide. A good measure to keep the bat population happy and to keep the vandals out. Guide and entrance fee is 3 lei.
Bucharest – Throughout the day every 45 minutes from the Bucharest Railway Station. The trip takes about 3½ hr on the A2 highway. Tickets costs 50-55 lei, which is 10-15% less expensive than the train. Though buses are slightly slower than the train, they are clean and comfortable and the newest ones have free Wi-Fi, which the train does not.
Istanbul, Turkey – There are also several daily buses leaving from Constanța to Istanbul. The duration is less than 12 hr including time spent crossing borders and the prices for 2011 are 200 lei a return ticket, including 1 night accommodation in Istanbul.
Bulgaria – Direct to Varna, or you take a bus to Ostrov-Vama Veche (€5), which is a town near the border with Bulgaria, cross the border and you are in Silistra, a town in Bulgaria. From there there are several connections to other Bulgarian cities such as Ruse, Dobrich, and Sofia.
