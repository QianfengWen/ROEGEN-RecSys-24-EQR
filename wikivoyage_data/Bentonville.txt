Bentonville is a city of 51,000 people (2018) in the Northwest region of Arkansas. Widely known as the home to the corporate headquarters of retail giant Walmart, the city was noted by Travel + Leisure magazine as one of the "Hottest Travel Destinations of 2012".


Understand[edit]
Tourism is the area is booming, thanks to the corporate traveler during the week and families on the weekends. If you are looking for things to do while in town, visit the local Chamber of Commerce's website, or stop by the Bentonville Convention & Visitors Bureau, which is on the Bentonville square.
Because the majority of the population are "transplants" from other areas of the country (moved here for business), people are open to visitors and very friendly. There is also an air of "southern hospitality."
