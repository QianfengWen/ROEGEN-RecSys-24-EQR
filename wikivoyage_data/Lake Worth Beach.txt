Lake Worth Beach is a city of 39,000 people (2019) in Palm Beach County, Florida, about 10 miles (16 km) south of West Palm Beach.


Understand[edit]
In 2019, the city changed its name from Lake Worth to eliminate confusion with unincorporated areas of Palm Beach that people call Lake Worth.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Palm Beach International Airport (PBIA  IATA), in neighboring West Palm Beach, is a small airport serving most major cities in the Eastern and Midwest United States, along with a handful of international destinations in the Caribbean. The airport is about 8 miles north of Lake Worth Beach, just off I-95. Lake Worth Beach is also accessible from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL IATA), which serves a greater variety of domestic and international destinations. Further afield, Miami International Airport (MIA IATA) has flights to most American cities along with Europe and the Middle East.

By train[edit]
Intercity passenger rail service is pretty non-existent in Lake Worth Beach, but Amtrak has a station in neighboring West Palm Beach served by the Silver Star, Silver Meteor, and Palmetto lines connecting to elsewhere in Florida and other cities on the Eastern Seaboard. West Palm Beach is also served by the new Brightline, which offers higher-speed connections to Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and by 2022, Orlando. Both stations are located in downtown West Palm Beach, which can be reached from Lake Worth via I-95.
The regional Tri-Rail commuter line connects Lake Worth to other cities in Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade Counties, including the Fort Lauderdale and Miami airports. The Lake Worth station is immediately west of I-95 on Lake Worth Road. Like most stations on the line, facilities are very minimal - little more than an outdoor platform with an automated ticket machine and a parking lot. The station is connected to the rest of the city by PalmTran buses. If using the train to venture to other destinations within South Florida, be aware that the stations are several miles west of the beach and most cities' downtown cores - great for commuters who have a station close to home, but a little inconvenient for travelers attempting to tour the area without a car, unless you're willing to connect via a ride-share service at both ends of your trip.

By car[edit]
I-95 serves as the main north-south thoroughfare connecting Lake Worth  Beachto other destinations within South Florida and beyond. Exits 61-64 serve Lake Worth Beach from both directions. If heading downtown or to the beach, take either exit 63 (6th Ave S) or 64 (10th Ave N) east to US-1. This will take you to Lake Avenue and Lucerne Avenue, each of which are one-way only in the downtown area. The roads merge into two-way Lake Avenue at the Intracoastal Waterway, where you'll cross a drawbridge to the barrier island that houses the town's beach facilities. West of downtown, the roads merge into Lake Worth Road, which reaches the city's western suburbs.
