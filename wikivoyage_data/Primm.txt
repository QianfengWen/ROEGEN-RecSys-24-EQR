Primm is a small community in Southern Nevada located at the California and Nevada State Line. It is 40 mi (64 km) south of Las Vegas and 12 mi (19 km) from another small town called Jean. It sits right next to Interstate 15.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
In the 1920s, the area only had a gas station which was owned by Pete MacIntyre. The story goes that he was having trouble selling gas so he resorted to bootlegging. He died in 1933 and was initially buried in an unmarked grave close by, though unintended exhumation caused his body to be moved into a cave. The man is now often known locally as "Whisky Pete", with the town's first casino named eponymously after him.
Between the early 1950s to the early 1970s, Dale Hamilton owned the town known as State Line at the time with an ambition to place a few slot machines in his gas station to entice travelers, a tradition that continues to this day.
In 1977, businessman Ernest Jay Primm opened Whiskey Pete's  to capture gamblers on their way to or leaving Las Vegas. He passed this venture on to his son Gary Primm.
Several decades later and in 1990, State Line's second casino The Primadonna Resort was opened to the public. Its current name is the Primm Valley Resort.
Buffalo Bill's and its Desperado hypercoaster were opened in 1994.
In 1996, State Line was renamed to Primm to remove confusion from the Nevadan town of Stateline near Lake Tahoe and to acknowledge the Primm family's success.
In 2010, the town was featured in the video game Fallout: New Vegas along with much of Southern Nevada including nearby Goodsprings, Jean, and Searchlight.

Climate[edit]
As with the rest of the Mojave Desert, Primm has a typical climate of hot days and cold nights. It is constantly arid with little rainfall as well as hot summers and warm winters.

Gambling[edit]




If you win...
Chances are that, if you win it big in Primm and you are not a U.S. citizen your winnings will be subject to a 30% withholding tax from the Internal Revenue Service. That $10,000 slot winning can dwindle quite quickly if that is taken off the top. Not to worry though you can reclaim your gambling winnings tax through a 1042-S form. You should get this from the casino so don't lose it: it is your starting ticket to getting your gambling winnings back.
