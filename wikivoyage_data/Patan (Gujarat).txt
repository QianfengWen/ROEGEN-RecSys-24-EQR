Rani ki Vav
Patan is a town in North Gujarat and it was a capital of Gujarat for about 700 years. The city is rich in historical and architectural monuments. It was a major centre of Jainism and has a large number of Jain temples. Rani ki Vav, a stepwell which is inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site, is the finest example of its kind.


Understand[edit]
First founded as a fortified city in 754 AD, Patan is estimated to have been the world's tenth largest city in the beginning of the 11th century. Sacked and destroyed during the 13th century, the city was soon rebuilt, and the world heritage listed stepwell was also constructed during this period.
The ancient city of Anahilvada Patan was founded by Vanraj Chavda, the first of the Chavda dynasty kings, in the 8th century. According to legend, the town was founded at the place pointed out by his childhood shepherd friend Anahil, so he named the city after him.
The city was the capital of Gujarat for 650 years, from 746 to 1411. During these years, it was ruled by several dynasties: the Chavdas, Solankis and finally Vaghelas. Under Solanki rule, 942-1244, Patan was a centre of trade, knowledge and architecture. It was also a major centre for Jainism. The Solanki rulers commissioned a large number of Hindu and Jain temples. They also constructed many civic and religious buildings.
At the end of the 13th century, Ulugh Khan, commander under Alauddin Khalji of Delhi Sultanate, plundered and destroyed the town. In 1411, the capital of Gujarat Sultanate was shifted to Ahmedabad. The glory of the town diminished with this shift; however, Patan still holds the earliest Muslim constructions in Gujarat.
