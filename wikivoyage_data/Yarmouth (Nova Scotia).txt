Yarmouth is a town of 6,500 people (2016) on the western tip of Nova Scotia, Canada. The town is known for the Cape Frochu Lighthouse and the nearby area boasts traditional Anglo-Scottish and Acadian French culture. It also makes a good base for exploring the inland wilderness areas, which feature over 365 lakes and several major rivers.

Fishing boats in Yarmouth
Long connected to fishing due to its proximity to Georges Bank, the town is in the heart of the world's largest lobster fishing grounds and as a result receives Canada's largest lobster landings each year.

History[edit]
It was inhabited by the Mi'kmaq First Nations (Indigenous) people, who called it Keespongwitk", meaning "Land's End" due to its geographic isolation being at the southwestern tip of the Nova Scotia peninsula.
The region may have possibly been visited by Leif Ericson. An object known as the Yarmouth Runic Stone was found at the nearby village of Overton in 1812. It was interpreted by some to have been carved by Ericson, while others feel the markings are natural scratches gradually enhanced over the years. The stone is preserved at the Yarmouth County Museum & Archives.
The region was visited in 1604 by Samuel de Champlain, who named it "Cap-Fourchu", meaning "forked or cloven cape." The first Europeans to make a settlement on these shores were the French Acadians in the mid-17th century. New England Planters settled at what is now the town of Yarmouth in 1759; the grantees were from Yarmouth, Massachusetts and they requested that Yarmouth be named after their former home. Yarmouth was founded in 1761 when a ship carrying three families arrived from Sandwich, Massachusetts. During the American Revolution, some in Yarmouth were sympathetic to the rebellion. Following the war, Acadians from the Grand-Pré district who returned from exile in 1767 settled in the Yarmouth area. After the American Revolution, substantial numbers of United Empire Loyalists arrived in 1785.
Through the 19th century the town was a major shipbuilding centre, at one point boasting more registered tonnage per capita than any other port in the world. As wooden shipbuilding declined in the late 19th century, Yarmouth's shipowners re-invested their capital into factories, iron-hulled steamships, and railways.
Tourism has been a major industry in Yarmouth since the 1880s when Loran Ellis Baker founded the Yarmouth Steamship Company. Steamship and railway promotion based in Yarmouth created the first tourism marketing in Nova Scotia. Baker's steamships operated between Yarmouth and Boston.
In 1939, examiners at Yarmouth's Merchant Marine Institution made seafaring history by issuing master's papers to Molly Kool, the first female ship captain in the Western World.
The growth of post-war automobile-based tourism led to additional ferry service with New England, a region with many family connections to the Maritimes dating to the 18th century and which accelerated during the first half of the 20th century.
During the first year of the Second World War, Yarmouth was selected as the location for a British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP) facility. RCAF Station Yarmouth was opened in 1940. RCAF Station Yarmouth closed in 1945. The airfield was sold to the Department of Transport in 1946 and became the Yarmouth Airport. A Canadian Army training camp (known as Camp 60) on Parade Street provided basic and artillery training for 20,000 soldiers during the war.

Climate[edit]
Downtown: Main Street looking north from the corner of Brown Street
Winters are cool and rainy with a January average of −3.0 °C (26.6 °F) though owing to strong maritime influences, temperatures below −20 °C (−4.0 °F) are very rare, and the average high never drops to below freezing at any point in the year. The weather can be unsettled and cloudy due to the Nor'easters coming up the coast from the southwest. As a result, Yarmouth averages only 68–100 hours of sunshine from December to February or 25%–34% of possible sunshine.
Yarmouth's summers are cool due the strong coastal influence from the sea which keeps summer temperatures cool, meaning temperatures above 30 °C (86.0 °F) are very rare. The average temperature in the warmest month, August is 17.0 °C (62.6 °F).
Spring and fall are transitional seasons in which falls are warmer than spring since the waters are at the warmest temperatures in fall and the coldest during early spring. Precipitation is significant, averaging over 1,292 millimetres (51 in) a year, with July and August the driest months on average and November the wettest month on average. An outstanding feature is Yarmouth's late-fall to early-winter precipitation maximum. Summer is the sunniest and winter being the cloudiest. Yarmouth averages 191 days of fog each year.
