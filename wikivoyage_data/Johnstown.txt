Johnstown is a city in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, 41 miles (66 km) west-southwest of Altoona, and 70 miles (110 km) east of Pittsburgh. The Conemaugh River forms at Johnstown from its tributaries, the Stonycreek River and the Little Conemaugh.


Understand[edit]
Like many other Rust Belt cities, Johnstown has fallen on hard times since the decline of the manufacturing industries that once provided the majority of jobs in the region.  Certainly not helping matters is the fact that the area was subject to devastating floods for some time, most recently in 1977 (although modern dams and rainwater diversion systems have since been installed to mitigate further flooding).  Nonetheless, for American history-minded travelers, Johnstown and the surrounding area offers a number of interesting attractions.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The main highway connecting Johnstown to the Pennsylvania Turnpike is US 219. In addition, there is also State Route 56, which is an expressway from 219 until Walnut Street. From there, it provides a connection to US 22 to the north of Johnstown, which connects to Pittsburgh and Altoona.

By plane[edit]
40.315556-78.8347221 John Murtha Johnstown-Cambria County Airport (JST  IATA) (located three nautical miles (6 km) northeast of the central business district). Although centrally located, with just one airline (United Airlines) serving only two destinations (Chicago O’Hare and Washington-Dulles).   (updated Oct 2023)
A likely cheaper alternative (even factoring in rental car costs and tolls) would be to fly into Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT IATA) and then make the two-hour drive to Johnstown via I-376 to the PA Turnpike.
