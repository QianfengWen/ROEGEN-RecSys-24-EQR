For those only going to Ikkyuji, the Ikkyu Tonchi Road is a nice walking course. The road is an attraction itself with 15 Ikkyu karuta cards with interesting facts about Ikkyu scattered along the road, so you can learn about Ikkyu as you walk to his temple. They're only in Japanese, but non-Japanese may still enjoy the images and they are good indicators that you're going the right direction.
