Katoomba is the largest and best-known town in the Blue Mountains, around 100 km (60 miles) west of Sydney and 1,017 m (3,337 ft) above sea level.


Understand[edit]
One of the Three Sisters rock formation
Katoomba developed as a popular mountain resort town in the early 20th century, with holidaymakers taking advantage of the train services along the current line from Sydney. The town reached an early heyday in the period between the world wars, attested to today by the numerous examples of art deco architecture and shop fronts along the main street of the town.
Today it serves as the main base for travellers to the Blue Mountains, and the main gateway to the two most popular tourist spots at Echo Point and Scenic World.  It has the most shops with all the supplies you need, tourist offices, motels, transport restaurants and even some nightlife.  However, it has lost the quaint village charm to Leura, its immediately adjacent neighbour to the east.

By car[edit]
Katoomba is located just off the Great Western Highway, and is a well signposted destination. Parking is available in town, with timed parking on the street.  Parking fees are charged at Echo Point and availability is limited, so if you are also visiting Scenic World, consider parking there in its large car park, and walking to Echo Point from the Scenic Skyway terminus.

By coach[edit]
Australia Wide Coaches operate a daily express service from Katoomba to the Sydney City and on to Sydney airport every morning, and return in the afternoon.

By bus[edit]
CDC NSW operates 38 buses per week between Springwood and Katoomba.

Get around[edit]
From the train station the 686 bus goes every 30 minutes during the day from Katoomba Station to Scenic World and Echo Point.  You can use your Opal card on the service, and if you're coming off the train you'll get the $2 transfer credit changing modes.
Alternatively, you can take one of two Hop-on-hop-off services.
Blue Mountains Trolley Tours charge $30 for a day's hop-on/hop-off (around 9AM to 5PM) but ask nicely at their sales office near the train station and you may get stamps for extra days for free. Their ticket office is across the street from Katoomba railway station. The regular bus departs each hour and goes to Leura, along the canyon edge to Three Sisters, Echo Point, Scenic World and back also stopping at some resorts, golf courses and museums.  The starting point for Trolley's buses is outside Carrington Hotel, around the corner from the ticket office.  The Trolley Tours HOHO ticket also allows you to take the 686 bus (which they call the 'express trolley').  The service isn't actually a "trolley".

A little outside[edit]

Do[edit]
Scenic Skyway as seen from Echo Point
-33.728407150.3009961 Scenic World, corner of Violet St & Cliff Drive, ☏ +61 2 4782 2699, fax: +61 2 4782 5675, info@scenicworld.com.au. The Scenic Skyway and Scenic Railway have been part of a visit to the Blue Mountains for as long as any Sydneysider can remember. The scenic railway is a really steep caged railway, and gives quite a thrill. The front seat is best if you can get it. The scenic cableway is much more sedate as descends down into the forest, and although it is common to do the railway down and the cableway back, if you want to enjoy the ride and not just the view, you'll have more fun just taking the railway both directions. Recent renovations to the railway have made it not quite as scary as it once was. Down in the valley you can walk on boardwalks along in the rainforest, the avalanche and see some mining remnant artifacts. There can be crowds on weekends, but you'll still get on okay. There can be school groups too, so just have a cup of coffee and wait for them to do their thing. $49.90 on weekdays, $55.00 on weekends and during school holidays (2023). 
Bushwalking in the valleys, including longer walks to the Ruined Castle (an eroded mountain) and Mt Solitary. Watch out for large, noisy lyrebirds scratching up food on the ground. If you're not prepared for bushwalking in the mountains, stick to walks along the cliff base, or connect with a guide. Good shoes, a bottle of water and some sun protection are highly recommended.
-33.710573150.3149022 The Edge cinema, 225 Great Western Highway, ☏ +61 2 4782 8900. The main attraction is a 38-minute giant screen movie about the Blue Mountains, called Wild Australia: The Edge. This is an amazing show about the stunning scenery and the rainforest, filmed from an "adventure sports" and "conservation" viewpoint; not at all tacky or "touristy". The cinema also screens other giant screen films and conventional movies including classic films, so be sure to check the schedule before making the trip.

The Carrington Main Bar is the 'default', stock-standard Katoomba pub, generally known as the 'Carrington' or just the 'Carro'. It's opposite the train station and taxi stand.
