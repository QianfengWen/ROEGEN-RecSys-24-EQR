Gorontalo is a city in Northern Sulawesi, and the provincial capital of Gorontalo province.


Understand[edit]
With its old Dutch colonial buildings, surrounding waterfalls, hot springs, and pristine coral reefs for diving, Gorontalo should be a world famous destination. However, most travellers only use it as a hub for the Togean islands. A large majority of Gorontalo residents are Muslims.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Gorontalo is served by 0.637188122.8484381 Jalaluddin Airport (GTO  IATA). The largest Indonesian airlines all connect Gorontalo to Makassar. Garuda Indonesia in addition has direct flights to Jakarta. Lion Air subsidiary Wings Air has regional flights to and from Manado, Luwuk, and Palu.

By boat[edit]
The overnight ferry, Touna Tomini, from Ampana / Togean Islands calls on Gorontalo every Thursday and Sunday, making the return trip the next day. Note: There's only 1 ferry and when it breaks down there's none.
The new fast ferry from Togean leave Dolong (handy for Malenge) on Wednesdays at 7:00 and Saturdays at 8.00AM to Buckland (arrive at 13:00) from where it's a 3-hour drive to Gorontalo.
By bus[edit]
Buses from Manado run daily (price Rp60,000).
Kijang (public cars) from Manado is a more comfortable option that will drop you at your preferred hotel. Rp150,000 for front seat (more comfortable), Rp100,000 for backseat (brace yourself for a bumpy ride).
Get around[edit]

Bentor is a cross between a rickshaw (Indonesian: becak) and a motorbike (motor), and will take you around town for Rp5,000. The price is about Rp20,000-30.000. for destinations outside of town, such as beaches and waterfalls. Arriving from the Togeans, the 4 km ride from Gorontalo harbor to the city should cost you Rp40,000 (Oct 2018).
Local buses and bemos (minivans in light blue color) have been observed, but they seem only useful for the locals.
Transportation sharing app like Grab and GoJek is available, although the number of cars is still limited. There is also some limitation (e.g. you can be dropped to the shopping center, but you can't be picked up from there).

Do[edit]
Diving[edit]
Gorontalo is home to the Salvador Dali coral sponge, indigenous to this region. With more than 25 dive sites accessible from the shore around Gorontalo, this should be a mecca for dive enthusiasts. However, so far this gem has remained relatively hidden.

Snorkeling[edit]
Visit North Gorontalo, There is 0.926813122.8644381 Saronde Island with good condition coral and fish also the white sand beach. As of June 2022, the island has become a private island with an entry fee of Rp5,000,000. Another 0.925063122.8768122 Mohinggito Island is also good place for snorkeling with cheaper entry fee of Rp40,000.

Whale shark watching[edit]
Whale shark watching in Botubarani village.
Probably the one thing that the city is most famous for and the main reason why some tourists stay overnight. You can do this in 0.474688123.1010623 Desa Wisata Botubarani and Olele Marine Park, and you can snorkel in the area as well. 
There used to be a prawn processing plant nearby which attracted whale sharks for feeding. The plant has closed, but the locals are feeding the whale sharks to keep them in the bay so that it is "guaranteed" that tourists can see them all year round. This is arguably unethical because whale sharks are normally migratory animals. Secondly, tour operators and tourists alike are not educated enough on how to avoid injuring white sharks (for a start: do not touch them, and get out of their way). So knowing these things, act according to your own conscience.

Buy[edit]
Buy supplies for Togean Island because the island is remote and essentials are expensive so bring sunscreen, mosquito spray/coils, and other essentials that you can think of.
