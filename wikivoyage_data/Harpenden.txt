To the south St Albans,5 mi (8.0 km) along the A1081 (was A6).
If you can get hold of a bicycle and a map (or a desire to explore independently), there are great opportunities for discovering nearby villages such as Kimpton, Peter's Green, Whitwell, Wheathamstead, Redbourn or Flamstead. All of these have more individual small-town feels to them, and often have nice pubs to stop by in.
