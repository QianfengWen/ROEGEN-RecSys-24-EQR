Camden is a city in Camden County, New Jersey, across the Delaware River from Philadelphia. Camden is a former industrial boom-town that has fallen onto hard times. 
Decades of disinvestment and government mismanagement have contributed to Camden's sky-high crime rate, and many of the city's neighborhoods are hotbeds of gang- and drug-related violence. However, the government has begun developing the Delaware River waterfront, which is now a popular and well-traveled tourist destination offering grand views of the Philadelphia skyline and a multitude of activities for adults and children. Headlines about violence and crime in Camden may dissuade many tourists to the Philadelphia area from visiting, but a one-day trip to the waterfront may be well worth the trip.


Understand[edit]
The revitalized Camden waterfront is a recreational center of the city
Nearly all attractions in Camden are found along the Camden waterfront, which offers family-friendly activities and scenic views of Philadelphia across the Delaware River. The downtown area contains the Rutgers University-Camden campus and the city's small central business district. The Camden waterfront and downtown areas are considered safe and are patrolled by police. Although the rest of Camden is plagued by urban blight, poverty, and gang-related drug violence, you will be safe as long as you stay in the waterfront and downtown areas and take sensible precautions. 

Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
New Jersey Transit handles bus routes into the city.
Megabus. Direct service to Camden from Pittsburgh, State College, and Harrisburg. Many more cities have service to Philadelphia just across the river.

From New York and Northern New Jersey, take the Turnpike to Route 73 North (Exit 4). Take I-295 South to Exit 26. Follow the signs for I-676 and Camden.
From Delaware, take the Delaware Memorial Bridge to New Jersey. Take I-295 North to Exit 26. Follow the directions from New York and Northern New Jersey.
By plane[edit]
The nearest major airport is the Philadelphia International Airport (PHL IATA), which is about 20 minutes away. From the airport, you may either take a cab (which will be costly), or use public transportation. By train, take the SEPTA Airport Line to the Jefferson Station, then travel five blocks to the 8th and Market PATCO station. From there, take the PATCO Hi-Speed Line into Camden.
By train[edit]
The PATCO Hi-Speed Line  is a rail line that operates between Center City Philadelphia and Lindenwold, New Jersey. The train operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, albeit with very infrequent trips between about 2AM and 6AM. Fares to downtown Camden (City Hall and Broadway stations) are $1.40 from Philadelphia and $1.60 from other stations in South Jersey.
The River Line[dead link]  is a light rail line serving 20 stations between Trenton and Camden, following the Delaware River in New Jersey. Trains run every 15 minutes during rush hour, every half hour at other times. Trains run until 1AM on Saturday and 10PM (very early!) on other days. The line connects with the PATCO Hi-Speed Line at Camden's Walter Rand Transportation Center. One-way fare between Trenton and Camden is $1.50. There are discounts for senior citizens, children and families. Monthly passes are available.
By boat[edit]
 RiverLink Ferry, Columbus Blvd and Walnut Street, ☏ +1 215-925-LINK (5465), info@drwc.org. From May through September, the RiverLink Ferry is the most entertaining way of crossing the Delaware River when visiting the Camden Waterfront and historic Penn's Landing. Enjoy the scenic view atop the open deck of the double-decker Ferry or take cover inside the sheltered cabin. It's also a great location for a private party. The ferry runs between Penn's Landing in Center City Philadelphia and the Camden waterfront. Boats run hourly between the two points. Express service to the Susquehanna Bank Center is available when events are held there, and ferries run until 30 minutes after the event ends. Roundtrip: Adults $7, seniors 65+ and children 3-12 $6, children under 3 free.   (updated Mar 2017)
Get around[edit]
Map of Camden (New Jersey)
By car[edit]
This is the easiest way to get around Camden. There is ample parking in the waterfront area, which is where all of the day time attractions are found.

By foot[edit]
Most of the worthwhile attractions in Camden are clustered in the Riverfront and Rutgers University areas, so walking is an option, once parked and decided on where you will visit. It is very nice to walk around the waterfront,especially on a beautiful day.

By public transportation[edit]
There are bus lines operated by New Jersey Transit that run throughout Camden. The NJ Transit RiverLine runs near the waterfront. The Walter Rand Transportation Center is a big transit hub, from where you can get the PATCO train to Philadelphia, as well as the RiverLine. The closest PATCO station to the waterfront attractions is at City Hall (at the intersection of 5th and Market Streets), but it is a good 10 minutes' walk down Market from the aquarium and further still from the music hall; if you do not want to walk, a better bet for a visitor from Philadelphia would be to disembark at PATCO's Broadway stop (which is part of the Walter Rand complex) and catch the RiverLine to the Aquarium or Waterfront Entertainment Center stop.

 Market Street Pizzeria, 1 Market Street, ☏ +1 856 541-4100. Family-friendly pizzeria and Italian bistro. On the entrance side of the Victor Lofts. It is such a popular place for Rutgers students, surrounding businesses and aquarium visitors. Their pizzas are made with Grandee cheese. Special pizzas are really special. Not cheap but reasonable. $2.50 single slices, everything else $8-20. (updated Apr 2016)
 Market Gourmet, 1 Market Street, ☏ +1 856 361-7006. At the Victor Lofts. Popular with locals and students, it is rather like a Wawa: a convenience store with good sandwiches and other deli-esque fare. Great grocery selection, with imports from the owners' native Turkey alongside more typical convenience-store fare. Very friendly people. Seating and Wifi available. Their Nescafe cafe hot drinks are worth to try. (updated Apr 2016)
 Cooper Court, Cooper Hospital/University Medical Center, Haddon Ave & Mickle Blvd, toll-free: +1-800-8-COOPER (266737). The chicken caesar salad is wonderful. (updated Apr 2016)

 Latin American Restaurant, 2 locations: 515 Market Street, and 3521 Federal Street. M-F 8AM-5PM. Don't let the ludicrously simplistic name fool you.

The Federal Street location is the original, but as it's in the barrio it isn't really accessible to tourists. $5-10; standard lunch is about $6.. (updated Apr 2016)
Drink[edit]
 The Victor's Pub, 1 Market Street. 10AM-2AM daily. The main watering hole in downtown Camden, occupying a good chunk of the first floor of the Victor Lofts. A relaxed community bar; the patrons are a mix of students--especially law students and medical students--and assorted others from around the community. Prices for drinks are quite reasonable, although the beer selection is somewhat limited. Drink specials are available some nights and generally quite good. Food is available and ranges from bar snacks to full-price entrees. Try the crab and artichoke dip. $2-6 for beer, $5-10 for cocktails and wine, $5-25 for food. (updated Apr 2016)
Sleep[edit]
There is a hotel by the waterfront area called Hilton Garden Inn. The hotel is luxurious and provides paid parking. It was built c. 2020, with a restaurant inside that serves breakfast and lunch.

Stay safe[edit]
Camden has a national reputation for its violent crime rates, which once ranked as the highest in the country, although there has been a significant drop in violent crime, with 2017 seeing the fewest homicides in three decades. Real estate analytics company NeighborhoodScout has named it within the top 5 "most dangerous" cities in the United States every year since it has compiled the list. In addition, since the FBI began uniformly reporting crime data in the mid 1980s, Camden has never seen its yearly violent crime rate drop below 2 per 100 residents. In comparison, the national rate is about 0.37 per 100 residents.
Don't wander past the riverfront and Rutgers areas along with the block of the Susquehanna Bank Center.  During the day, the riverfront and downtown areas are safe, provided that you don't flash your valuables. The Rutgers and Camden police are also highly present. Approach them if you have any concerns. However, do not wander around alone at night. It is dangerous. The downtown area is nearly empty after the Court House, Rutgers University, and other major businesses close down for the evenings. Keep in mind that the drug trade fuels a lot of Camden's crime. Even if you don't experience violent crime at night, the police will be curious about why a tourist is wandering alone on the streets and you may be subjected to questioning.
The city is one of the poorest in the country.  In June 2018, the unemployment rate was 9.8%, compared to 4.7% for the state, and in 2015, over 30% of households were living in poverty, compared to 10% for the state.
