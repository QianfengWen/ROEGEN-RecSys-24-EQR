San Blas is a city and port of about 10,000 people (2010) facing the Pacific Ocean in Nayarit state of Mexico. It is a relaxed beachside town, complete with a lively village plaza, historical attractions, and jungles and swamps full of wildlife for the nature lovers in the family. The town is one of Mexico's designated Pueblos Mágicos.


Understand[edit]
Sculpture on the Muelle de San Blas
During Mexico's colonial era, San Blas was established as a port city with connections to the Spanish Empire's Asian outposts via Manila. During this era, Acapulco was the primary commercial port while San Blas took on the role of primarily serving the Spanish armada as a military base and a shipyard for repairing naval vessels. (The town still has a naval base, and visitors may sometimes see patrol boats going in and out of the harbor.)
At one point San Blas was earmarked for tourism development. The town (and beach) are plagued by small biting no see-ums, and as a consequence no mass-scale tourism happened.

21.525715-105.2760343 Playa Hermosa. This once-glamorous luxury hotel, built in 1951, is on a lonely but beautiful stretch of beach about a mile from the plaza. In the 1960s, Hollywood had a brief hideaway flirtation with San Blas when actors, including Lee Marvin, Elizabeth Taylor, and Richard Burton discovered San Blas for its fishing and its well-appointed bedrooms. Jim Morrison came to drink and get high as he wrote L.A. Woman during his more lucid moments. The sprawling hotel complex is now abandoned but could make for an eerie Urbex adventure. 
Do[edit]
Surfing. You are able to hire surfboards on the street running between the plaza and the beach, and also from beachside restaurants. San Blas has some of the best surfing conditions in Mexico with a number of challenging surfer beaches close to town.
Matanchen Bay offers legendary breaks. In fact, many surfing enthusiasts consider this area to have the world’s longest most rideable waves (allegedly riding a mile on one wave)!

Lolas is slightly remote but can be reached by panga from the San Blas waterfront. Because its remote, the beach is mercifully crowd-free with the only people there likely to be fellow surfers.
