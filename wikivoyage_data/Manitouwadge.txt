Manitouwadge is a township in Northern Ontario. It has about 2000 people (2021).


Understand[edit]
"Manidoowaazh" means "Cave of the Great Spirit" in Ojibwe. 
While mining was at the forefront of Manitouwadge's economic activity, forestry also plays a significant part in the town's economy. The town is also turning itself into a retirement community, offering some of the lowest housing prices in the country.

History[edit]
Manitouwadge (Manidoowaazh in Ojibwe, meaning "Cave of the Great Spirit") was part of the range of the nomadic Ojibwe indigenous people. 
The town was founded by Noranda (now part of Xstrata) in the early 1950s to support the company's Geco copper mine. Other mine in Manitouwadge is the Willroy mine, named after two of the "Weekend Prospectors", William Dawidowich and Roy Barker.
In the early 1980s, gold was discovered at Hemlo, near the intersection of highways 614 and 17, about 50 km (31 mi) south of the town. Noranda acquired the mining rights to a significant portion of the ground in that area, and built the Golden Giant Mine. It offered housing in Manitouwadge to many of the employees of the new mine, and the town boomed.
When the Geco mine closed in 1995, Manitouwadge's population decreased significantly. After peaking at nearly 4000 people in the early 1990s, it decreased to less than 3000 by 2001. With the closing of the Golden Giant Mine in 2006, the population dropped to 2,100 by 2011.
