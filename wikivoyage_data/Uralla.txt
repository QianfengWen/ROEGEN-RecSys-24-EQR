Uralla is a small town (pop. 2,743, 2016) at the junction of the New England Highway (A15) and Thunderbolts Way (19) in the New England region of New South Wales in Australia.


Understand[edit]
Autumn along the New England Highway (A15) near Uralla
The name Uralla comes from the language of the indigenous Aniwan people, and means 'a ceremonial meeting place and look out on a hill', in reference to Mount Mutton on the outskirts of the town. The first European settlers established themselves on the site of the town in 1841. A gold rush began near the town in 1852. The infamous bushranger Captain Thunderbolt (his real name was Frederick Ward) operated in the district and is buried in the Pioneer Cemetery. 
Uralla is the main centre of the Uralla Shire Local Goverenment area.
