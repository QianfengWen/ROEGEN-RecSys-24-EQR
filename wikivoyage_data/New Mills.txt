New Mills is in Derbyshire.  It's unlikely to feature on many itineraries in its own right, but it's worth stopping off for an hour or two if travelling between Manchester and the Peak District.


Understand[edit]
The Torrs, New Mills
New Mills is a small mill town at the junction of the Rivers Sett and Goyt. The town is bisected by the impressive gritstone gorges of the two rivers, contained within a recreational area known as the Torrs (or the "Park under the Town"). Half Man Half Biscuit's laconic summary is probably fair comment: "No frills, handy for the hills, that's the way you spell New Mills."
