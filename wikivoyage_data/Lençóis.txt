Lençóis is a small city in Bahia, Brazil.  The city is very charming with cobblestone streets and many wonderful hole in the wall restaurants. Lençóis and the nearby Vale do Capão serve as a "base camp" of sorts for tourists from all over the world setting out to explore the Chapada Diamantina National Park, with or without a guide.


Understand[edit]
Lençóis was founded in 1844 when diamonds were found in the countryside.

Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
There are buses coming from Salvador everyday. And there are often extra buses during the high season. Just check the current departure times on the apps from Clickbus or Buscaonibus. The trip takes about 6 hours.
From Brasilia there are buses, too. You can depart in the afternoon and arrive in the late morning in Seabra. It costs around R$170 (Feb 2021). There you may have to walk six minutes to another intercity bus station. Just ask where you arrive. The bus to Lençois is for R$15 (Feb 2021). The app from Buscaonibus shows all operating bus companies on this route with their departure times.

By car[edit]
From Salvador, take the BR-324 until Feira de Santana, then take the BR-116 until it meets with the BR-242 (Bahia-Brasília) highway; or take the BA-052 from Feira de Santana to Ipirá, and then the BA-488 to Itaberaba, then continue along the BR-242 heading west. Lençóis is just 12 km off the BR-242 Bahia-Brasília highway.

By foot[edit]
Since Lençóis is a small, you can walk anywhere around town.  To get out of town to see the sights in the Chapada Diamantina, book a tour and they provide transportation and guide. There are some waterfalls, swimming holes and natural slides on the outskirts of Lencois all at a walking distance.
Other than that the main attraction of Lencois the town serves as a good base for trekking trips into Chapada Diamantina National Park. There are day trips as well as longer treks of up to 5 days. The trips can be organized with a tour agency which takes care of everything including transport, guide food etc., but you can also buy a map of the park and venture out on your own. The tour agencies charge upwards of R$120 per day.

By car[edit]
The roads outside Lençóis are full of pot holes.  Be prepared for a bumpy ride when you leave the town to go on tours.
You can rent a car for R$100 for 12 hours (200km limit) or R$150 for 24 hours (no km limit). This is a cheaper alternative for seeing some of the nearby attractions without booking through a tour agency.

Waterfalls[edit]
Cachoeira do Diabo
-12.564396-41.3983991 Piscinas Naturais do Serrano. – 1 km. 
-12.561512-41.4027522 Poço Halley. – 2 km. 
-12.561473-41.4065323 Cachoeira do Primavera/  Cachoeirinha. – 2 km. To get to these waterfalls you have to go up the hill at the Banco do Brasil, passing the Policia Militar and head uphill until you reach the water treatment facility. There you turn right and follow the pipeline bringing water into the facility. If you continue following this river upstream you will find Cachoeirinha at the left side of the river at a tributary. Facing Cachoeirinha you can go further on the right side. Either to visit some nice pools upstream of Cachoeirinha or take the trail a little bit to the right and follow it until Cachoeira do Primavera. It is an easy afternoon trip with not too much sun exposure. No guide needed! 
-12.587654-41.3890554 Ribeiro do Meio / Cachoeira do Sossego. – 3 km. You have to leave the city close to the southern church. Facing the church you follow the road on the left side for approx. 15 min. You will get to a sort of T-Junction where you should continue on a stone trail, and there should be a blue/green/yellow/red sign saying Ribeiro do Meio 4 km/40 min. On the way you will pass little stalls selling stones and drinks. 100 meters before the second stall you have to turn right to get the trail to Cachoeira do Sossego. You just need to follow the arrows indicating the trail. After about 30 min you will reach the riverbed. You jump from stone to stone for about 45 m more and you will get to the Cachoeira do Sossego. Contrary to what every "guide" in town will tell you it is an easy-to-find trail (2.5 h each way). (updated Aug 2022)
