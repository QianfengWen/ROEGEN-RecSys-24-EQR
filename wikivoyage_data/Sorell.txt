Sorell is a town in the southeast of Tasmania. It is one of Tasmania's oldest towns, settled in 1808, and officially gazetted in 1821. Sorell has many historic buildings, as well as amenities and accommodation. Sorell is the business and shopping hub of the Sorell municipality, and serves as the gateway and main town for what is sometimes called the Southern Beaches region, famed for its many beaches and shack communities. Sorell also sits at the start of the Arthur Highway towards Port Arthur. 


Understand[edit]
Sorell is named after William Sorell, Lieutenant-Governor of Tasmania. It is just 25 kilometres from Hobart, accessed via the Causeway and McRobies Bridge. It has a long history as one of Tasmania's first towns, primarily acting as a nexus for the agricultural regions around it, and as the first stop on the way to the Tasman Peninsula. In addition, it remains the closest major town for the southern beach communities of Lewisham, Dodges Ferry, Carlton River, Connellys Marsh, and Primrose Sands - historically holiday towns. Today, many people in Sorell and surrounds commute to Hobart for work.
Sorell has both major supermarkets, three pharmacies, a doctor's clinic and most other major amenities. It also features many historic buildings, from its art deco town hall to its three historic churches. Sorell is the regional seat of the Sorell Council, covering 583 square kilometres, which operates from offices behind town hall. 

Get in[edit]
42°47′7″S 147°33′29″EMap of Sorell
It is a 30-minute drive from Tasmania's capital, Hobart via the A3 Tasman Highway, and a 13-minute drive from Hobart International Airport.

Get around[edit]
Sorell is small enough to be traversed on foot; finding parking is generally not an issue. Crossing its main street, Gordon St (Tasman Hwy / A3), can be a bit of a challenge at times, especially during peak hours. 
One thing that can be confusing in Sorell is its route numbers. Before the winter of 2022, things used to be fairly straightforward, but ever since the Sorell Southern Bypass opened, has rerouted the route numbers more conveniently for those bypassing the town. However, if you're following route numbers and are in Sorell, whether a road is part of the A3 or A9 can get confusing. To put it in a nutshell:

Sorell Southern Bypass: A9 in both directions
Main Road and Gordon Street (Tasman Highway): A3 in both directions
Cole Street (Arthur Hwy): A9 eastbound, A3 westbound, with the signs in between showing either.
Navigation applications tend to be inaccurate. If anything, follow the local signs and ignore your GPS – the signs will clearly indicate the focal points and the distance, and these are more accurate than map applications.
