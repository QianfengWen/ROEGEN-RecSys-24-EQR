Jundiaí
Jundiaí is a city in the Campinas Region of São Paulo state. More than just a medium-sized city between São Paulo and Campinas, Jundiaí is renowned by its wineries and  traditional fruit farms open to visitors, as well as by the Serra de Japi, a rainforest-covered mountain range with unique characteristics.


Understand[edit]
In 1615, the region called by Native Brazilians as "Jundiahi" was settled by bandeirante Rafael de Oliveira. Jundiaí was officially recognized as a village in 1655, and dedicated itself to mining on its early decades of existence, followed soon by a period of economical stagnation. This started to change in 1785 with the boom of agriculture, including fruit cultivation, which is still one of the main characteristics of the region today. With the inauguration of the train station in 1867, Jundiaí started receiving a lot of European immigrants (from Italy, Spain and England) and became a major agricultural exporter.
In the 20th century, industry in Jundiaí has steadily developed and the city is today one of the most attractive places in the state for industries. Unfortunately, despite the agricultural and industrial prosperity, the somewhat disorganized population growth lead Jundiaí to have rates of social and crime problems which are significantly high for a city of its size.
Most visitors come to Jundiaí to relax in its charming countryside, or to adventure in the Serra do Japi. But as the only large city of the state outside the São Paulo metro area to still have a fully operational passenger train station, urban Jundiaí contains important testimonies of the shining days of rail transport in Brazil. Not by coincidence, Jundiaí is likely to be the first city in the state to have a rapid train service, around 2016.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Jundiaí is easily accessible from either São Paulo (50 minutes) or Campinas (40 minutes) by Rod. Anhanguera (SP-330). From São Paulo, a frequently used alternative is to take Rod. dos Bandeirantes (SP-348), and change to Rod. Anhanguera shortly before arriving in Jundiaí.

By train[edit]

Jundiaí is one of the few places outside the São Paulo metro area where it is possible to arrive by train. The CPTM train of Line 7-Ruby, that departs from Luz station in São Paulo, is ridiculously cheap (same price as a regular CPTM/Metrô ticket) but since it is a stop train, it is very slow (takes at least 1½ hours, plus transfer time at Francisco Morato station which can add a further 20 minutes on occasion). The train can also get overcrowded at peak hours, and you should keep track of where your valuables are if people are brushing up against you. The train goes through some rough-ish neighbourhoods but security at every stop do a good job of keeping everything under control. You can see some pretty interesting views from the rail route that you simply don`t get to see from the motorway, such as favelas on the sides of hills and dirt football pitches humming with activity, not to mention the occasional buskers and serenaders wandering up and down the carriage looking for money. The Jundiaí train station is about 1.7 km from the city center proper, and approximately the same distance to Museu da Companhia Paulista.

By bus[edit]
Getting to Jundiaí by bus is a far more comfortable option than the CPTM train. The intercity bus terminal of Jundiaí is Terminal Rodoviário José Alves, at Av. 9 de Julho, 4000. A local bus or a taxi is necessary to reach the city center from the terminal.

Buses from São Paulo (departing from the Tietê terminal) are provided byViação Cometa, and cost about R$17.50
Buses from Campinas are provided by LiraBus or VB Transportes and cost about R$14
Buses from São Paulo and Campinas are quite frequent and seldom require reservation.

Get around[edit]
The city center and its attractions can be easily explored on foot. To explore the countryside and the nature around the city, however, you will need an uber lift, share a blablacar ride, or hire one of the tour agencies that operate in the city.
