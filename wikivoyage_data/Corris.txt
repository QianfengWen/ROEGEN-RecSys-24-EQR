Corris is a small village in the hills of Gwynedd, on the border with Powys. In the 19th century it was a slate-mining town and has many remnants of those times, especially the narrow-gauge railway, which has been restored. The hills around are nowadays peaceful and are part of Snowdonia National Park.
