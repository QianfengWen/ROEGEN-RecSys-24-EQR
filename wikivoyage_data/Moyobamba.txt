Moyobamba, the City of the Orchids, is the capital of the San Martín region in northern Peru.


Get in[edit]
Moyobamba
Since the airport is not in use, the only way to get into Moyobamba is by road. Your best option is to use a bus company. There are buses from Lima, which take 24 hours to get to Moyobamba and travel during the night. Prices vary, with the most expensive being around S/120 (soles).
The fastest way to get to Moyobamba is to fly from Lima to Tarapoto and from Tarapoto take a taxi or bus to Moyobamba. LAN Peru and LC Perú fly to Tarapoto from Lima. A taxi will cost S/25 and a bus will cost S/20. The average time from Tarapoto to Moyobamba is 2 hours. Enjoy the view on the way!
You can also arrive from Iquitos, by boat to Yurimaguas and then a bus or taxi to Tarapoto and Moyobamba. The road is winding, with several ups and downs, and it can be a problem if you are prone to motion sickness. It is otherwise breathtaking in its beauty.

Get around[edit]
You can either walk or catch a moto-taxi (a modified motorbike with three wheels and a carriage at the back for three passengers). Most journeys with a moto-taxi cost S/2.00. Some drivers may try to charge more when they see you are not from Peru. Remember to state your price before you get into the taxi.
