Bordentown is a city in Burlington County, New Jersey.


Understand[edit]
Downtown Bordentown
Bordentown is a town a few miles south of Trenton and is near the Delaware River, a fairly wide river that flows south along the New Jersey-Pennsylvania border to the Atlantic Ocean. It is at Bordentown where Crosswicks Creek meets with the Delaware River, and the I-295 crosses the mouth of the Crosswicks Creek.
The town is largely on a grid layout, although the grid is not aligned with north, south, east, and west.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The main road to town is the I-295, a side-route of the I-95, which goes along the western side of the town. Two U.S. Routes go past the southern and eastern portions of Bordentown, and one of these, the US-130, intersects with the I-295.

By train[edit]
A train line runs along the northwestern side of Bordentown, and there is a train station for Bordentown.

By car[edit]
Farnsworth Avenue crosses the town in an almost north-south direction. In the south, it intersects with US-130, and it continues north to the Crosswicks Creek. Much of Farnsworth Avenue is part of Bordentown downtown. Crosswicks Road enters the town from the eastern side and goes to Farnsworth Avenue. The western end of Crosswicks Road is part of the downtown.
To get from the hotels to the gas stations and supermarkets, the US-130 is a decent connector.

By bus[edit]
There are several bus stations scattered around Bordentown. Most of these are on Burlington Street (southern Bordentown) and Park Street (northern Bordentown).
