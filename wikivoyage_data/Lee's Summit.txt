Understand[edit]

Lee's Summit can provide a family-friendly vacation, and let you get away from the hustle of Kansas City. You come here to see historic towns, have great shopping, fish, go boating, and slow your world down. Lee's Summit covers a large area, so renting a car or driving here are the easiest ways of getting around and getting out. Lee's Summit is a place you really have to experience. When you're here, you can't help but smile!
From LS's location in the midwest it is probably fall that is the best time. With great weather. Several local festivals. Less crowded stores, restaurants, and attractions. And best of all, there is peace and quiet here on weekdays. Spring and summer are still great times to visit themselves, but avoid winter here if you can. They are cold and snowy.
