Strahan (pronounced "straw-n") is  on Tasmania's west coast at Long Bay at the northern end of Macquarie Harbour.


Understand[edit]
Strahan is about 300 km west of the state capital of Hobart, in one of the most isolated (and beautiful) parts of Australia.  It is also an excellent base where the West Coast Wilderness Railway can be accessed, Gordon River cruises can be taken, and other adventurous ways of negotiating the western edges of the South West World Heritage area.
It began as a staging place for explorers into the South West, and mining areas in the Western areas of the state. It later became a mining port and  was the main timber industry and general shipping centre for the area.
For most of the 20th century Strahan was smaller than Queenstown and Zeehan – and served as a port for both locations.  Now Queenstown and Zeehan are ghosts of their former glory, and Strahan is now promoted as the main tourist centre for Tasmania's west coast region.
It is considered to be the 'gateway' for boats, planes and helicopters taking visitors to the world heritage southwest wilderness area.
There is also an oceangoing small fishing industry that still operates out of Strahan. In the harbour to the south of Strahan there are a number salmon farming ventures, which can be seen from the boats that travel to Sarah Island or the Gordon River.

Get in[edit]
West Coast Wilderness Railway at Regatta Point terminus
By car[edit]
From the south east, take the A10 highway from Hobart, the Lyell Highway via Queenstown. This is about a 300-km drive and usually takes about 5 hours.
From the north coast, take the A10 which passes through Tullah, there are two ways to Strahan from just south of Tullah:

Rosebery, Zeehan and via B27 down to Strahan
Take B28 that runs just west of the spectacular West Coast Range, down to Queenstown, and then the B24 which runs to Strahan
By train[edit]
Map of Strahan
The West Coast Wilderness railway has re-commenced operations following a time of changing ownership and maintenance on the line.
The West Coast Wilderness Railway operates a railway line between Queenstown and Strahan, a distance of 34 km.
There are services that use Strahan as a base for a trip to Dubbil Barril and to Queenstown.
The ordinary railway connection between Strahan, Zeehan, and the rest of Tasmania closed in 1960. The old railway line became a road that provides access to views of Ocean Beach and the West Coast Range.
Other old railway lines on the west coast have become walking and driving trails.

By plane[edit]
Strahan Airport - Although helicopter and fixed-wing flights operate from here for charter flights into the south-west wilderness area, or over locations in western Tasmania, there are no regular passenger flights to Strahan from other airports in Tasmania or the mainland. Regional Express (Rex) fly to Burnie daily and Jetstar and Qantas fly to Launceston Airport.

By boat[edit]
Not implausible - commercial yachts or launches are not known as regular visitors - Hells Gates (the head of Macquarie Harbour) is the main restriction due to shallow draught and difficult maneuvering.  Private larger sized sea-going boats have been seen at the wharf in Strahan and Regatta Point over time, although regular shipping services relative to the mining industry in Zeehan or Queenstown had mainly ceased in the mid-1970s.  The possibility of arranging a passage from mainland Australia, the north coast of Tasmania or Hobart by private boat in the summer time is very low, but possible, and would require patience to track down whether anyone was venturing into the west coast waters.  It would be very ill-advised to hitch a ride with anyone who did not have local knowledge (or access to it) of the negotiation of Hells Gates and West Coast conditions - Captain Fathom [1] is a very good indicator of the height of the swells that would be encountered.  A visit to Ocean Beach for a view during a storm is also a salient and sobering experience for anyone considering access from the ocean.

By bus[edit]
TassieLink runs a service from Hobart to Strahan a couple of days a week. It's a big trip (5 hr plus a wait at Lake St Clair), but will get you in.

Get around[edit]
Foreshore walk from Strahan to Regatta Point
Strahan is connected to other parts of the west coast by a bus service.
There is no local service within the Strahan/Regatta Point area, and a significant number of features of the two locations can be walked.

By bike[edit]
Strahan and Regatta Point are bike friendly, despite the immediate hill up to the level at which part of Regatta Point and Strahan are on.

By car[edit]
Most of the roads on the west coast are sealed and easily usable by cars of any capacity.  The roads further off the mainroads can be both unsealed, and not suitable for domestic vehicles.  The more out of the way locations on the map which appear to be accessible
Watch out for logging trucks on the Strahan to Zeehan road.

By foot[edit]
A number of the local attractions like Peoples Park require walking into.

By tours[edit]
Strahan is the base for some of the tours in the area, others start in Queenstown.

By boat[edit]
Boating in Macquarie Harbour is safe, but all weather warnings and boating regulations are well worth taking note of.  Travelling out to sea through Hells Gates is not recommended. (See above in 'Get In' section about boating out to sea, or arriving by boat.)
