Tabatinga is a Brazilian city on the triple border with Brazil, Colombia and Peru, in the northwest of the state of Amazonas. It forms a contiguous settlement with the Colombian town of Leticia, on the Amazon River. Santa Rosa on the nearby island in the river is in Peru.


Understand[edit]
The border with Brazil and Colombia at Tabatinga. Tabatinga is on the left bank of the Solimões River. The municipality has a population of around 70,000, the 6th most populous in the state of Amazonas. Its population is quite heterogeneous, formed by Brazilians, Peruvians and Colombians, among them indigenous people of different ethnic groups. The city also receives non-permanent Brazilian inhabitants who are employees of government agencies or military personnel of the armed forces.
The city's economy is driven by a significant portion of the informal economy and subsistence agriculture. It is also made up of public sector jobs and the extensive financial exchange of the Colombian city of Leticia, which, based on dollar regulation, takes place in parallel in the city between the Colombian peso and the Brazilian real.

History[edit]
The formation of the city of Tabatinga dates back to the 17th century, when Jesuit missionaries founded a village close to the Solimões River. In 1766, a military post, a fiscal post and a border post between the Portuguese and Spanish colonies were installed in the region. From the creation of these two posts, the settlement of São Francisco Xavier de Tabatinga was founded. In 1866, the border between Brazil and Peru was drawn near the village. In 1898, the city became part of the newly created municipality of Benjamin Constant. A post between the borders of Tabatinga and Letícia in 1924 consistently defined the borders between Brazil and Colombia. On December 10, 1981, the municipality of Tabatinga was emancipated from the municipality of Benjamin Constant. The installation of municipal offices took place on January 1, 1983.

Climate[edit]
Tabatinga has a tropical rainforest climate with high humidity and minimal differences in average high and low temperatures throughout the year. Average temperatures range from 22 °C (71.6 °F) to 30 °C (86 °F) throughout the year. Rain falls throughout the year, although between June and September there is less rainfall.

Get in[edit]
Inside a dense tropical rainforest with no land connection with other Brazilian or Colombian cities, it is only possible to reach Tabatinga by plane or by boat.

Immigration[edit]
Movement between all three countries' border towns is unrestricted; but of course, make sure you're stamped into the correct country if leaving the border area. Try to minimize the number of times you go through immigration: i.e. if entering the region from one country and leaving from another, just get one exit and one entry stamp, even if you visit all three towns in this area. Anything more seems to annoy the immigration officers.
The Brazilian immigration office is some way down Tabatinga's main avenue, Avenida da Amizade, next to the Federal Police station. It is only open Monday to Thursday. Exit-stamps are given by the Federal Police (next door to the left), not by the immigration.
The Colombian immigration office is at the airport, so if you're flying in and moving on to a different country, you may as well get an exit stamp when you land. Don't wait several days between getting your exit stamp and the next entry stamp; however leaving it one day doesn't cause any problems.
The Peruvian immigration office in Santa Rosa is fairly central and easy to find, just ask someone.

By boat[edit]
There are two ports divided by a river.

Get around[edit]
Taxis and moto-taxis abound; just avoid the taxis at the port - they overcharge 2 to 4 times. The city is pretty large, walking in the heat of the day is something one might want to think twice about.

See[edit]

You can see all three countries at once at the -4.254083-69.9463981 viewpoint Barranco da Comara and at a -4.252067-69.9462412 viewpoint near the airport runway just 5 minutes walking away. Both are free of charge.

One of the greatest experiences in South America - voyaging down the Amazon.

-4.23654-69.937381 Federal Police (exit stamps here), Av. da Amizade, 2502-2530, Tabatinga - AM, 69640-000, ☏ +55 97 3412-2047. Exit-stamps are given by the federal police (next door to the immigration office), NOT by the immigration office! (updated Aug 2017)
Buy[edit]
There is a -4.226998-69.936561 Bradesco bank with ATMs on the main street.
Both Brazilian reais, Colombian pesos and Peruvian soles are generally freely traded in the town, though Peruvian Soles may not be willingly received. 
Changing money is not difficult though.
Due to the isolation of the city and the distance from the capital of the state, the cost of living in Tabatinga is higher than in the rest of the state. However, shopping in the Colombian city of Leticia is tax-free, and for this reason, the locals and tourists generally prefer to shop on the Colombian side of the border.
