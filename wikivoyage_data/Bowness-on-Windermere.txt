Bowness-on-Windermere is the main tourist centre for the South Lakes area of Lake District National Park. It sits on the shore of Windermere lake within the boundaries of the historic County of Westmorland. In 2011, it had about 3,800 permanent residents.


Understand[edit]
Lake Windermere at Bowness.
"Windermere ought to be seen both from its shores and from its surface. None of the other Lakes unfold so many fresh beauties to him who sails upon them. This is owing to its greater size, to the islands, and to its having two vales at the head, with their accompanying mountains of near equal dignity. Nor can the grandeur of these terminations be seen at once from any point, except from the bosom of the Lake." – William Wordsworth in Guide to the Lakes.
Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
It is about a mile from the Windermere railway station which links to Oxenholme (near Kendal) on the west coast main line. One can walk, if one likes, from Windermere station to Bowness. Alternatively, buses are available every 20 minutes from the railway station to the ferry jetty. Taxis are also available. If there is a group of 4-5 people, taxis may be economically more viable, because buses would cost almost as much.

By ferry[edit]
A car ferry operates daily (except 25, 26 Dec) from Far Sawrey, running M-Sa approximately every 20 minutes between 6:50AM and 8:50PM, starting Su at 9:10AM on, and with later sailings in summer. Cars £4.20, pedestrians 50p.
