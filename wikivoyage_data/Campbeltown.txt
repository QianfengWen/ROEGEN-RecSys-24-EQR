Not to be confused with Campbelltown or Campbell Town.

Campbeltown (Gaelic: Ceann Loch Chille Chiarain) is a town near the south tip of Kintyre, the long narrow peninsula of  Argyll in the west of Scotland. It's only 60 mi (97 km) from Glasgow as the crow flies, but 135 mi (217 km) by road winding around the many lochs and mountain ranges. In 2021 the population was 4490. 
Kintyre has inspired two famous songs: the one that isn't by Paul McCartney goes "Campbeltown Loch, I wish you were whisky, I would drink you dry...." Wishful thinking but not for want of industry by the town's distilleries - there used to be 30 in this small place. As with Islay, the isolation was a factor. Barrels of whisky were loaded onto ships for export, duty free; but on dark nights many of them mysteriously found their way back to the mainland cities. By the 21st century only two distilleries remained in Campbeltown, but a change in the law in 2009 encouraged new production.

By road[edit]
After all the twists and turns of the main road A83 to reach  Tarbert on Loch Fyne, the last section to Campbeltown is a 37-mile straight run along the west coast. Most motorists and buses follow this route. A scenic route is the B-road along the east coast. This branches off just south of Kennacraig ferry terminal, runs over the moors to Claonaig (for Skipness Castle, and summer ferries to Lochranza on Arran) then south via Carradale, Saddell and Peninver to Campbeltown.

By bus[edit]
Scottish Citylink Bus 926 runs 4 or 5 times daily from Glasgow Buchanan Street to Campbeltown, taking 4 hours. The route is via Dumbarton, Tarbet on Loch Lomond, Inveraray, Lochgilphead,  Tarbert on Loch Fyne, Kennacraig, Tayinloan and Muasdale. One bus a day runs via Glasgow Airport. Booking is recommended, as this is a busy route connecting with several ferries.
On school days there are a couple of extra runs by West Coast Bus 449 from Lochgilphead via Tarbert and A83 to Campbeltown.
The bus terminus is 200 yards north of the ferry pier.

By plane[edit]
55.4372-5.68641 Campbeltown Airport (CAL  IATA), PA28 6NU (4 miles west of town). Two Loganair flights M-F and one on Sunday from Glasgow GLA take 45 min. The terminal is tiny, check-in here an hour before flight will be plenty. Car hire (pre-booking essential) is available from Kintyre Hire or Campbeltown Motor Company - see "Get around" for these and taxis. There's no bus service to the airport.   (updated May 2023)

By boat[edit]
Calmac ferries sail three days a week May-Sept from Ardrossan (which has trains from Glasgow Central) to Campbeltown, taking 2 hr 40 min. A day trip is not possible. Return fares until end of March 2025 are £99.30 per car, £18.60 per adult passenger including driver, £9.40 per child aged 5-15. A quirk of this route is that the Saturday morning ferry from Campbeltown also calls at  Brodick on Arran on its return to Ardrossan; it doesn't call on the outbound sailing. There's no ferry Oct-April. The 55.423-5.62 ferry terminal is at the head of the loch, 200 yards south of the bus terminus. 
Kintyre Express is a foot-passenger ferry between Campbeltown and Ballycastle in Northern Ireland. This runs Apr-Sep F-M, sailing from Campbeltown at 7:30AM, taking 90 min and returning at 4:30PM, so a day trip is possible. Adult fares in 2023 are £80 single, £150 return, bikes are free. 
There's no car ferry between Kintyre and Ireland: with a vehicle you have to wind all the way back through Tarbert, Inveraray, Loch Lomond and Glasgow to sail from Cairnryan near Stranraer.
See  Tarbert for details of ferries: 

- from Portavadie on Cowal to Tarbert, which, combined with the Gourock-Dunoon or Isle of Bute ferries, create a short cut from Glasgow or circular itinerary;
- from Kennacraig to Islay, thence to Jura and Colonsay;
- from Claonaig to Lochranza on  Arran.
See Gigha for the ferry from 55.657-5.673 Tayinloan.

55.424-5.5452 Davaar Island is a tidal island in the bay east of town, reached by the Dhorlin shingle causeway at low tide. There's a Stevenson lighthouse, and several caves: a painting of the crucifixion appeared in one in 1887, causing consternation among locals who took it as a sign from God. But "a prophet is without honour in his own country" (Mark 6: 4) and when they learned it was by a local man, Archibald MacKinnon, they ran him out of town. The painting is occasionally vandalised but has been restored. You can see it without a flashlight, though it's a bit gloomy and damp in there.
55.309-5.7883 Mull of Kintyre is the scenic headland at the tip of the peninsula, with cliffs, a lighthouse, and the coast of Northern Ireland only 12 miles away, not much further than is Campbeltown. The mist-wraithed cliffs and ridges have claimed several ships and aircraft; a memorial near the car park commemorates the Chinook helicopter crash of 1994.
