The bicycles are available from Easter until November. The bikes can be used to getting around to attractions, outside of Frederikshavn city centre easily, as the city has, and expands on, a quite well functioning web of bicycle paths and roads and it is also possible to take the bike with you on the train to Skagen if space is available.
Getting around in own car is rather easy, as Frederikshavn has quite a number of parking areas, of which the majority is free. City centre is an exception to this, with a couple of paid parking areas.

Nature[edit]
Frederikshavn is a starting point of the truly epic hike of Hærvejen, leading down the entire Jutland peninsula for 500 kilometres, all the way to the border with Germany. The trail follows ancient trails used in olden times to transport cattle and soldiers, and presents the nature and cultural of Jutland in its variety. It is designed for an 18 day journey, but you can chose to hike shorter individual parts and still get a great experience.

Buy[edit]
Frederikshavn has a small pedestrian area, surrounding the main pedestrian street, which contains the south end of Danmarksgade and north end of Søndergade. The main pedestrian street is approximately 750 metres long, and the area houses a number of retail shops with various consumer goods, such as clothes, telecom shops, radio/TV shops and restaurants.
For bigger shops such as supermarkets, DIY retailers, furniture shops and such, the north/west end of the city houses the majority of those along Hjørringvej between Suderbovej/Knivholtvej and Toftegårdsvej/Maigårdsvej.
Opening hours follows those otherwise found in Denmark; supermarkets are mainly open between 09:30 and 18:00, other shops between 10:00 and 17:30 and restaurants between 11:00/16:30 and 22:30-23:00.
