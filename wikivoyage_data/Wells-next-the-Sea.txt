52.8940.8743 Walsingham is an attractive village 5 miles south of Wells. In the Middle Ages it was a major destination for pilgrimage, and this tradition was revived in the 20th century. The Augustinian priory was virtually erased in 1538 by Henry VIII, leaving only the east facade. The shrine just north, built in 1938, is an unusual example of an Anglican Marian shrine, commemorating a vision of 1061. The equivalent RC shrine and basilica is just south. There are some dozen other chapels and shrines dotted about. You can get here on the W&W Light Railway (see below), but in a twist worthy of Tolstoy, the original railway station is now a Russian Orthodox chapel.
