Willemstad is the capital and largest city of Curaçao. The city center and the waterfront is inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.


Understand[edit]
Willemstad is mostly a destination for cruise ship tourists who usually spend one, max. two days there. Prices in bars, restaurants and shops tend to be very high and the originality and quality of products sold is often questionable - especially in the main tourist district Punda. But by comparing prices and using happy hours (usually 1 hr per bar, sometimes between 16:00 and 20:00) costs can be reduced considerably.
Cocaine and cannabis is offered to tourists pretty openly, but a friendly "no, thank you" is sufficient to be left alone.

Districts[edit]
Punda: The historic city center, today the main destination for tourists, has lots of shops and restaurants.
Otrabanda: Residential neighborhood just across St Annabaai from Punda, connected by the Queen Emma bridge and a ferry. The rif fort and mega pier are on Otrabanda's side of St. Annabaai. Some restaurants and fast food joints line up on St Annabaai, lots of shops targeted at locals can be found along Breedestraat.
Scharloo: Scharlooweg, between Van Radersstraat and Bargestraat, was the main avenue of Jewish merchants at the end of the 19th century.
Brievengat and Gosie: Residential neighborhoods at the northern end of Willemstad.
Buena Vista - Gasparitu: A residential, suburbian district built for employees of the refinery.
Santa Maria: Residential neighborhood between Hato airport and the refinery.
Suffisant: Residential neighborhood between Santa Maria (to its west) and Brievengat (to its east).
Get in[edit]

Cruise ships moor either at Otrabanda's mega pier or at the entrance to the harbor - all mooring locations are within easy walking distance to the main tourist attractions.

Get around[edit]
Map of Willemstad
The main tourist destination, the district of Punda, can be covered on foot easily (and much faster than by car).
Regular buses are cheap but they don't serve many points in Willemstad.
Shared taxis are inexpensive and flexible about the route they take. The main shared taxi spot in Punda is just behind the floating market.
Regular taxis are expensive, renting a car is usually the cheaper option if one wants to visit the various beaches in and around Willemstad.
While it is possible to get to all places by bicycle it is not advised for inexperienced riders since dedicated bike lanes are rare, cars tend to speed and the always blowing wind and slight but long elevations can be strenuous for untrained people.

You get to see the bridge open and close to allow marine traffic into St. Anna Bay. (In the event the bridge is open for a prolonged time, there is a ferry service across the channel as well.) There is not a feasible way off the bridge if you're caught on it when it opens.

Buy[edit]
Luxury goods: Most shops in Punda specialize in luxury goods, though it is sometimes questionable whether they are real or fake. Prices are, despite huge tax breaks, not always competitive and one might get the same goods for cheaper in one's country of residence.
Blue Curacao: Historically just a double accident (the oranges from Spain did not grow well and were inedible and how the distillate of the peels once turned blue is a mystery - nowadays it is colored with food coloring) it's still the most famous local product and comparatively cheap.
Hammocks: Some merchants from Venezuela offer high quality hammocks for a good price (about US$20) at the floating market and in stalls in Otrabanda, along St. Annabaai.
Souvenirs: Since Curacao's culture is one of mixed heritage there are no typical local goods, most people settle on T-shirts instead.
Electronics: Along Breedestraat in Otrabanda several shops offer electronics for competitive prices, this is a good opportunity to replace broken gadgets without paying the premium asked for on cruise ships.
You can pay in Antillean Guilders (Nafl) or USD everywhere, the exchange rate is fixed. Change might be given in guilders, though.
