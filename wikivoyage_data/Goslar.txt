Goslar's Imperial Palace Kaiserpfalz
Goslar[dead link] is a medieval town in Lower Saxony and serves as a regional hub to the wider Harz area. It lies at the foot of the Harz Mountains (highest elevation 3,744 feet). Goslar is much older than Berlin and worth a visit. If you are interested in history, outdoor pursuits (especially hiking), tranquility and nature, then Goslar is the right spot for you.  In 2019, it was home to 51,000 people. 


Understand[edit]
Goslar was founded in 922 AD, although it is widely assumed that there had been a settlement since pre-Roman times. The town is famed for its magnificent gates and ramparts, the medieval Imperial Palace, Romanesque churches, its half timbered guild houses, the ancient Rammelsberg ore mine... and its witches, the last of which was burned at the stake in 1657 AD. In medieval times the city was a major producer of armouries and coins—the raw ores for their manufacture came from the Rammelsberg mine just outside the city's walls.

History[edit]
What, Ram + Goat = Goslar?
Not quite...! According to legend, Ramm, a knight to Henry's son Otto the Great, tied his horse to a tree, halfway up the Rammelsberg, to continue hunting in the undergrowth. In anticipation of the return of its owner, the horse scraped with its hoof in the ground laying open a ledge of silver so rich that it took over a millennium to mine. Hence the mountain and mine were called the Rammelsberg, after Otto's knight Ramm.  As the wife of knight Ramm was called Gosa, they named the town Goslar in her honor.
Emperors, Dukes, and Townsfolk
Essentially Goslar was a Free Imperial City, which was under direct control of the Emperor and there were no regional feudal overlords, who were in charge of the city until the end of the Thirty's Year War. Thus the citizens were largely left to their own devices, since the emperors had mostly better things to do than to sit in their Imperial Palace at Goslar. There were several other imperial palaces throughout the Holy Roman Empire, where the emperors held court.  The only problem for the city's craftsmen was that their Free Imperial City ended right behind the city's walls.  Unfortunately for them, the mine they depended upon, for the delivery of the ores, was immediately outside these very city walls. So they had to lease the rights to the mine from even such regional feudal overlords, the Dukes of Brunswick, who would have fancied it, if the city was theirs. This inevitably let to regular skirmishes between the Dukes and their men on the one side, and the burghers on the other side, which were not resolved until the end of the Thirty's Year War in 1642 AD with the Goslar Accord.
Goethe's Goslar Gothic Ghosts. With the onset of the Reformation in 1517 AD Goslar has escaped the interest of the emperor, and its riches declined so that Goethe, Germany's national polymath, writes in 1777 during his visit to Goslar: "Imperial City, which rots 'inside' and 'with' its privileges!"

UNESCO World Heritage Status[edit]
This might be a reason why the Rammelsberg Mine and Town have been so uniquely preserved that they hold UNESCO World Heritage Status.
Goslar is the Harz region's festival town, culminating in the annual award of the "Imperial Ring" [dead link].

Get in[edit]
Goslar is 250 km west of Berlin. The nearest cities are Brunswick, Hanover, and Magdeburg. 

By plane[edit]
If you own a plane, a helicopter or even a flying saucer then you might wish to land at the club airport Salzgitter-Drütte in the immediate vicinity (24 miles) of Goslar or the Brunswick-Wolfsburg Airport. Maybe try the disused military airfield at Goslar itself, but don't get yourselves into troubles over this.
However, as a lesser mortal you need to take a plane into either

Hanover International Airport[dead link] (HAJ IATA) (65 miles)
Leipzig/Halle Airport[dead link] (LEJ IATA) (103 miles)
and make your way to Goslar by car or by train. Both airports are connected to the S-Bahn network of their respective cities from where you can take a train to Goslar.
A further option is flying into Frankfurt Airport (FRA IATA) and taking the train from there

By train[edit]
51.91111110.4230561 Goslar Station, Hildesheimer Str. 53.   (updated Jun 2024)
Goslar can be accessed by regional trains from Hanover, Brunswick, Göttingen, Halle and Magdeburg. In Hanover, Halle and Göttingen there is access to Germany's ICE (Inter City Express) network. Connections from other cities might require a change along the way, often in Hildesheim, Salzgitter or Kreiensen.

By car[edit]
From Paris/London/Brussels/Cologne  take the Autobahn A44/E331 to Kassel and take the A7/E45 in the direction Hamburg at the Kassel intersection. For further directions see below.
From Madrid/Rome/Vienna/Zurich/Munich/Frankfurt take the A7/E45 and leave it at either the intersection Seesen. Take the Bundesstraße B248 and then the Bundesstraße B82 to Goslar. If you wish to take the route via the Harz mountains, exit the A7/E45 at Northeim and take the Bundesstraße B241 via Osterode, Clausthal-Zellerfeld to Goslar.
Coming from Moscow/Warsaw/Prague/Berlin, take the A2/E39 to the intersection Braunschweig and head via the A395 in the direction of Bad Harzburg. At Vienenburg you leave the A395 and take the Bundesstraße B241 to Goslar.
Arriving from Amsterdam/Düsseldorf/Ruhr Basin take the A2/E39 to Hannover and at the Intersection Hannover leave the A2/E39 and take the A7/E45. For further directions, see below.

Goslar is a popular destination for bikers who enjoy riding their bikes through the Harz mountains.

By bus[edit]
Bus services to and from Goslar are relatively frequent and efficient. The regional bus operator Brunswick Regional Transport RBB[dead link] runs a website [formerly dead link] , which assists you with finding the relevant connection. In Goslar, their hub is in front of the central railway station. Here you also find a small travel centre, where staff can provide you with further advise. Essentially, the most frequent routes are between Goslar, Seesen, Harzburg-Spa, Salzgitter and Clausthal-Zellerfeld, with less frequent services to other destinations in the Upper Harz (lines 440, 450, 462, 831, 838, 841, 842, 850, 861, 879). The RegioBus lines are the express ones—the others are slow. The handy thing is that the RBB forms a  partnership with other regional public transport operators, so that you only have to buy a single transferable ticket. Thus, there is no need to purchase a new one every time you change your train or bus.

51.902910.43281 Zwinger, Thomasstraße 2, ☏ +49 5321 43140, museum@goslarer-zwinger.de. Mar - Oct: 11:00-16:00. 25 Dec - 10 Jan: 10:00- 15:00. Guided-tours outside opening hours on appointment. The massive Zwinger Tower arrests the attention of those driving by. Pedestrians in the green belt park, as well, stop to gaze in awe. Built to protect the Rammelsberg and the east flank of the town up to the Broad Gate, it was one of the mightiest defences in Europe. Up to 1000 people could find safety in its four storeys in case of siege. Measuring 26 metres in diameter, the tower's lower walls are over 6 metres thick. Today it houses a private Museum of the Late Middle Ages where armour and weapons for knights and musketeers, instruments of torture as well as boors’ weapons from 1524 are on display.

During the rest of the year the Hall of Homage can be visited during the guided city tour One Thousand Steps through the Old Town (daily 10:00). Tickets at the Goslar Tourist Information.. Town Hall (Rathaus) – The Goslar Town Hall is, indeed, a building of the centuries: the east wing with the arcades opening onto the Market Square was begun in the middle of the 15th century and over the following 400 years the Town Hall was continually extended and enlarged. Today its overall impression is determined by the 16th-century additions: a period of great prosperity for Goslar, which, as a member of Hanseatic League and a Free Imperial City, profited from the flourishing mining industry. The Town Hall still serves its original purpose, housing the Lord Mayor’s Office and the hall where the Town Council still discuss the weal of the town under the beautiful star-studded wooden ceiling. Hall of Homage (Huldigungssaal) – The Hall of Homage was set up as a council chamber between 1505 and 1520. It is a unique jewel of late Gothic interior decoration: its walls, the ceiling and even the window alcoves are completely covered with wood panel paintings. Each painting is an artwork of quality, contributing to the overwhelming complete ensemble. Richly carved wood decorations surround each painting. After many years of restoration the room is now protected by complex environmental protection devices so that this masterpiece can be preserved for future generations. Adults €3.50. Groups €2.50, children/youth €1.50.. 
Gildehaus Kaiserworth at the market place
Kaiserworth – The main building of the Town Hall had not long been completed when the cloth merchants built their guildhall in its immediate proximity in 1494. For nearly 200 years the Hotel Kaiserworth has been at home here.
 St. Anne’s House, St. Annenhaus, ☏ +49 5321 39870. Tu - Th 14:00-16:00.

This almshouse was founded in 1488 and contains portions of a Romanesque stone “Kemenate” with a medieval kitchen, the large one-room hall, and a chapel. Of particular note is the Baroque altar by Jobst Heinrich Lessen and the artfully-worked Margarete Tapestry from the 15th century with 32 illustrations of the life of the martyred saint. 
Houses of worship[edit]
Collegiate Church Vestibule
51.9027210.421862 Claus Chapel, ☏ +49 5321 22464, +49 5321 22566. Opening hours: Viewing and guided tours on request. This small Romanesque hall church from the 12th century was incorporated in the town fortifications and served as a gate chapel. From 1537 onwards it was the miners' hospice chapel, replacing their former church in the Bergdorp village, which had been destroyed. The miners passed through the Claus Gate going to and coming from mines and the chapel served for hundreds of years for prayer and church services. The Frankenberg Parish had the pulpit rights and obtained the chapel from the mine administration in 1969. In 1988 following the last shift in the mines the miners visited the chapel for the last time. Today it is used regularly by the Frankenberg parish congregation for prayer and church services.  
51.903210.41843 Frankenberg Church, Frankenberger Plan 4, ☏ +49 5321 22464, +49 5321 22566. Apr-Oct: 09:00-18:00; Nov-Mar by appointment. Guided tours on request. The Frankenberg Church of St. Peter and Paul Church was built in the 12th century as a three-aisled, cruciform, pillared basilica with a flat ceiling. It stands on the highest point in the west of town. The steeples were part of the town wall. The existence of the church is documented for 1108 and beginning in 1234 it was also used for the nuns of the neighbouring St. Mary Magdalena Convent. Around 1240 the roof was vaulted, in the 14th and 15th centuries Gothic alterations of the choir and the southerly transept are recorded, in 1783 the badly deteriorated steeples were removed and the Baroque tower roof added, and in 1873/80 extensive restoration of the interior and exterior was carried out. The Frankenberg Church was the parish church of miners who lived in close proximity to the mines in the Frankenberg Quarter. The bell inscriptions and the Mining Thanksgiving festival on Sunday before Ash Wednesday are reminiscent of this.  
51.90559410.4275974 Market Church St. Cosmas and Damian, Evangelisch-Lutherische Marktkirche in Goslar, Kaiserbleek 5, ☏ +49 5321 22922. Daily Apr-Oct: 10:00-17:00; Nov-Mar: 10:00-16:00. Guided tours: M 12:30-15:30PM. Short service: May-Oct Tu F 11:30-11:45. North Steeple opening hours: daily 11:00-17:00. The Goslar Market Church, first mentioned in 1151, was built as a smaller copy of the Imperial Church, which no longer exists, in the form of a triple-aisled, pillared basilica with two spires in the west. In the 14th and 15th centuries the choir was enlarged and an additional nave was added on both sides. Today it not only attracts attention through its central location on the Market Square but also because of its very high unmatched steeples, which assist in orientation and provide attractive views from various points in the Old Town. Of special note are the nine medieval stained glass windows from the first third of the 13th century, the old library, the bronze baptismal font from 1573, the remnant of a Late Gothic mural from around 1440 and the wooden Baroque altar from 1659. The North steeple of the Market Church has been made accessible for a view over the town.

Bad Gandersheim The Market Place
Bad Gandersheim -  a town in South Lower Saxony. It is a town is full of character and is made up of many half-timbered houses. (40 minutes from Goslar)
Bad Harzburg - a small spa town nestled in the foothills on the northern edge of the Harz. It is named after a former imperial castle, the Harzburg, which used to stand proud on the heights above the town, but is now a ruin with just a few walls and ramparts remaining. The town itself caters largely for residents taking the "cure" as well as tourists - especially ramblers and cyclists - visiting the Harz. As a result, the centre is a pedestrian zone with small shops and timber-framed houses, surrounded by sprawling suburbs - a mix of impressive timber-framed residences and functional modern buildings. Bad Harzburg is a great base for exploring the northern Harz. There is an 80-year old cable car to the Harzburg above the town called the Harzbergbahn. Once on the top, there is a network of easy walking trails and numerous sights within striking distance including the Lynx Enclosure near the Rabenklippe crags and several outstanding viewing points over the surrounding area. (Only 12 minutes from Goslar).
