Kinnity is a village in County Offaly, 13 km east of Birr. In Irish Cionn Eitigh means "the head of Etech", a mythical princess whose head is supposedly buried here, and the rest who knows where. The population (as of 2016) is only 381 but Kinnitty does have accommodation; the main reason to visit is to hike in the Slieve Bloom Mountains.

See[edit]
53.096-7.721 The Pyramid behind St Finian's Church of Ireland church is a burial crypt for the Bernard family, former owners of the castle. Standing 10 m high, it was built in 1834, with the last burial in 1907.
Kinnitty Castle or Castle Bernard is now an upmarket hotel, see Sleep. Non-residents can still visit the High Cross, which is all that's left of St Finnian's monastery. It's 2.4 m tall: the carvings are 9th century though the cross may be much older. It's reached by a path from the castle car park. The castle is from 1811, was torched in 1922 but reconstructed.
53.127-7.6542 Cadamstown is a village 6 km northeast on R421 when the road crosses the gorge of the Silver River. St Lughna's Church (Roman Catholic), built in 1842 on the site of a 9th century abbey, has a medieval inscribed grave slab, a 12th century decorated animal head and a human face. The tumbledown Old Morrow's Mill is from 1830. An ancient drystone bridge, perhaps 500 years old, just-about-stands north of the R421 crossing: it's reached by a muddy riverside path 1 km from the village. No trace remains of Cadamstown Castle, though its stone may have been re-used for the mill.
53.123-7.6153 Giant's Grave 4 km upriver from Cadamstown is a megalithic tomb. Nothing to see but eight large boulders, you come for the riverside walk.
53.174-7.7264 Kilcormac is on the main road between Tullamore and Birr. The main sight is the RC Church of the Nativity, built in 1867 but with a remarkable 16th-century Pieta carved from a solid block of oak.
53.073-7.7965 Clareen is a village 5 km southwest on R421. There's the scrappy remains of an Augustinian priory, with Round Tower, turret and High Cross all sadly truncated, and earthworks from a prehistoric ring fort. Nearby is a Holy Well and "rag tree": people dip scraps of clothing in the water, wipe the afflicted body part then pin the scraps to the bush in hope of cures or blessings. These ensue just as often with charity shop tat and knickers made in China as ever they did with traditional garb.
Leap Castle is another 5 km along R421, see Roscrea#See.

The Hitchcock Vanishes
The film director Rex Ingram (1892-1950) was born in Dublin and grew up in Kinnitty before moving to the United States. His real surname was Hitchcock, but he must have realised that he'd never get far in the movie business with that name. He made some 30 films, best known being The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1921) and The Prisoner of Zenda (1922). Michael Powell and David Lean both cite Ingram as a major influence on their work. But he couldn't manage the transition from silent movies to talkies, took up sculpting and writing instead, and converted to Islam. He died of a stroke in North Hollywood.
