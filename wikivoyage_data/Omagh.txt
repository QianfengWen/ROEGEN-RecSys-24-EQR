Omagh is  the county town of County Tyrone in Northern Ireland. It's a market town with a population of 20,000 in 2021, standing at the confluence of two small rivers that creates the Strule River. The nearby Ulster American Folk Park explores the journey made by the Irish (specifically those from Ulster) to America during the 1800s, and hosts festivals and events.  


Understand[edit]
In 1998 there was optimism in Omagh, as elsewhere in the UK and Ireland, that the Troubles were behind them. The Good Friday Agreement, signed on 10 April 1998, bound all sides to non-violence and a series of reforms on civil rights, policing, military de-escalation and recognition of sovereignty. Sinn Féin the republican political faction supported the agreement, but a splinter group called the Real IRA saw it as betraying the struggle for a united Ireland. They began a campaign of bombings against symbolic targets and the security forces, and their car bomb in Omagh was the worst single act of violence in the entire Troubles.
On 13 Aug a maroon Vauxhall Cavalier was stolen in the Republic, fitted with fake Northern Ireland plates, and loaded with 500 lb (230 kg) of explosives; the man who stole the car was a double agent. On 15 Aug it was driven to Omagh, with a scout car ahead to warn of checkpoints. Security forces were listening to these mobile phone conversations, and there had been other intelligence. The target in Omagh was the courthouse on High Street but they couldn't find a nearby parking spot, so they parked further east on Market Street near its junction with Dublin Rd. They set the timer for 40 minutes, walked clear and drove off in the scout car. A family of Spanish tourists happened to pose for a photo next to the car.
The Real IRA phoned three warnings, but they caused police to believe the site was the courthouse, so people were evacuated along Market Street towards the bomb. It exploded at 3:10PM, turning the car into a fireball and hail of shrapnel. 27 people were killed outright or died of their injuries, including two of the Spanish tourists, and a woman who was pregnant with twins.
The aftermath was universal condemnation; the Real IRA became pariahs and said they would abandon their bombing campaign. There were years of police, legal, political and media enquiry, and several suspects were arrested but no convictions could be secured. However the families of children killed by the bomb launched civil litigation against the main suspects, and four were found liable for the deaths.

54.603-7.3073 Omagh Jail: all that remains is the octagonal tower of the Governor's House, built in 1804. (The town's monastery and Franciscan Friary also stood here, but were obliterated by later building.) It's privately owned and you can't go inside. Most of the inmates were debtors, but one notorious criminal hanged here in 1873 had killed the cashier while robbing the bank at Newtonstewart. The crime was diligently investigated by District Inspector Montgomery, but in a twist worthy of The Real Inspector Hound, the murderer turned out to be himself.

Cookstown has a famously long wide main street, but the real attractions are the ancient sites (including the inauguration site of the Kings of Tyrone), and the "beetling mill" that put the final shine on Ulster linen.
County Fermanagh starts 15 miles southwest. Irvinestown, the first place you reach, has a couple of castles, though they're really mansion houses.
Derry is a fascinating historic city and its walls still stand.
