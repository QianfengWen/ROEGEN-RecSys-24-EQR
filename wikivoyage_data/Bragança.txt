Bragança's main claim to fame lies in the Cidadela (Castelo de Bragança), virtually a separate village above the town and one with a distinctly medieval flavour. There are four particular sights here. (updated Mar 2021)
Torre de Menagem - the massive keep of a castle belonging to the Dukes of Bragança, the last Portuguese royal family, but not their principal residence, which was at Guimarães. The quadrangular tower is 34 metres high. The Military Museum is open inside.
Domus Municipalis - a pentagonal lay building - probably an 11th-century council chamber. it is an interesting example of Romanesque civil architecture. According to Leite de Vasconcelos, it was built in the 12th century. It has already served as a cistern and was later adapted to city halls. It has a hexagonal plan and granite walls. It has a set of low-arch windows, which provide lighting to the building. Along the cornice, which is supported by 64 dogs, a gutter runs, designed to collect rainwater, then led to the cistern.
A preaching cross rising from the back of a prehistoric pig outside the castle.
Military Museum — Located in the keep of the castle, it has an important collection of armory, from the Middle Ages to the present day.
41.799-6.80452 Mosteiro de Castro de Avelãs. This is what remains of the 12th century Benedictine monastery, unmistakable by its head, with an apse in red brick. It is a rare example of "clay architecture", being an exception to northern granite architecture. It has a simple interior, of which stands out the golden carving of the altars and an interesting pulpit, supported by three wooden angels. Next to the churchyard there is a quadrangular granite tower. Access is via the direction of Vinhais. (updated Jun 2021)

The roof of the church, of a single nave, is subdivided into three vaults with cross arches and corbels; the main altar features gilded wood carving in national style; the balustrade choir is from the 18th century. It deserves a close visit to the Sacristy, from the 17th century, for the beauty of the decoration, for the richness of the paintings on the paneled ceiling (narrating the life of Saint Ignatius) and for the paintings that flank the arch. The Cloister also deserves special attention.   (updated Jun 2021)
