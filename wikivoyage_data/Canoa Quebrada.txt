Most people working in restaurants and bars in Canoa works for minimum wages and often without a proper contracts. In a lot of cases the menu states that the restaurant adds 10% tip. This is a tip for the owner, the workers never see this money. You can give tips directly to the waiter in her/his hand. Even a few R$ will be welcomed.

Drink[edit]
Weekdays are rather dead, apart from January. Fridays and Saturdays have people pouring in from the whole eastern part of the state, and also some crowds from Rio Grande do Norte. Broadway turns into one big party. If there is something big on in Aracati the crowds might never arrive.

 Caverna, Broadway. Live music on Thursdays. Shoulder rubbing on the street benches. Pool tables. Large beer R$4. 
 Todo Mundo, Broadway. Slightly loud rock hits Shots from R$1! Large beer R$4. 
Daytime drinking is on the beach:

 Jegue's Bar, On the beach (Sit down and wait till he comes along). Probably the only donkey-driven bar around. 
 Freedom Bar, On the beach (Follow the crowd from the lower end of Broadway). Midnight-dawn, a couple of days a week.. Reggae in a dozen languages, bonfire in the sand. Lack of toilets and illumination takes its toll. As of January 2010 several muggings have been reported. Do not walk home alone! Beer can R$3.
