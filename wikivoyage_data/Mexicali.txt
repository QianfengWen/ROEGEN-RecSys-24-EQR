Mexicali (also known informally as "Chicali") is the capital of the state of Baja California in Mexico, directly across the border from Calexico, California, United States. Its proximity to the United States has made it a very popular tourist destination, especially for day-trippers. Growing violence has curtailed that traffic, although Mexicali remains safer than other large border cities like Tijuana and Ciudad Juárez.


Understand[edit]

The municipality of Mexicali has a population of around 1.1 million people (2020), of whom about 800,000 people live in the city proper. Mexicali has grown from a small border town to a modern city with a sizable middle class and an even bigger upper class. The standard of living is among the highest in Mexico. It is recognized in Mexico for its sizable investment in education and low unemployment. It is a progressive city with main industry that has gone from agricultural to industrial. 
Economically, a growing middle class with disposable income has fueled Mexicali's transformation into a modern city with a vibrant culture, a characteristic that has attracted many national and international businesses which had largely ignored the city before and had turned to Tijuana. Mexicali is considered among the most prosperous cities in Mexico. Some areas of the city reflect the significant number of wealthy people who inhabit the city, in areas such as San Pedro, Villafontana, and Col Nueva. There remains poverty in rural villages surrounding the modern, upper-middle class enclave of Mexicali proper. The North American Free Trade Agreement of 1994 that eliminated most trade restrictions between the two nations offers Mexicali an economic boom in the next decade. 
Mexicali is a transit point for illegal immigration into the United States, as well as a common destination for any illegal Mexican immigrants deported from the West Coast of the U.S. Some areas are swollen with poor people with no roots in the city, who inhabit shantytowns, mainly in the outskirts of the city.  
Mexicali's growing reputation as a cosmopolitan city is justified. Not only is the city home to many people who have migrated from within the same country, as well as some native Mexican Indians, but it boasts many Asian residents (especially Chinese), as well as Americans, Europeans, and South Americans. Informally, Mexicali natives are known as "cachanillas", after a shrub (Pluchea sericea or arrowweed) endemic to the region.
Mexicali is known mainly as a business and industry town, but has an excellent reputation for hospitality and tourism in the country.
Mexicali is known as "the city that captured the sun". Its residents frequently joke regarding its extreme heat during the summer, reaching record desert temperatures. Mexicali's primary newspapers are La Voz de la Frontera and La Cronica de Baja California. 
While the Mexican peso (M$) is the legal currency, US dollars are widely accepted. Mexicali observes daylight savings time (DST) and is in the Pacific Time Zone like California.

Chinese community[edit]
Mexicali has one of the largest Chinese communities in Mexico. It even hosted the North American headquarters of the Kuomintang (KMT) at one point. Many old-time Chinese-Mexican natives of Mexicali have since intermarried with the local mestizos or emigrated to the United States. Although Mexicali has had a history of Chinese immigration for about 100 years, the restaurant workers tend to be recent immigrants from Guangdong, China, who are multilingual in Taishanese (a distinct dialect of the Cantonese language), Mandarin, and Spanish. Nearly all of them are from just two cities in Guangdong, namely Taishan and Kaiping, with a small minority from neighboring Enping, Zhongshan, and Hong Kong.
The historic Chinese neighborhood is known as La Chinesca, centered on Avenida Benito Juárez, several hundred feet to the south of the Calexico point of entry.

Talk[edit]
People in the city of Mexicali speak Spanish. However, English is spoken at least marginally by the majority of the population. It is very easy to find someone who speaks English, and due to the city's international standing, other languages are used for business and are heard throughout the city, such as Chinese, Japanese, German and French.

Climate[edit]
While winters are pleasantly mild, visitors can expect a very hot climate during the summer months with average high temperatures ranging from 101°F to 108°F (38° to 42°C). Rainfall and clouds are scarce throughout the year.

Get in[edit]
Map of Mexicali
By car[edit]
Mexicali is accessible from the United States through Calexico on Highway 111 (from El Centro and points north) and Highway 98 East (Yuma) and West (San Diego) via I-8.
Either park at the border and continue on foot or you drive into Mexico. Driving from the US to Mexico usually requires no stopping. Driving across the border from Mexico to the US may involve a long wait, especially during evening rush hour or on holiday weekends. Mexican insurance is required, which should be bought before your trip. Mexicali has two border crossings, Mexicali East (Newer) and Mexicali West (Traditional),  both of which have a SENTRI lane.
Mexicali is the northern terminus for Mexican Highway 5 to San Felipe.
Mexicali can also be reached from Tijuana and Tecate on Mex-2.  Though much of this highway is a toll road (the "Libramiento" aka Autopista), it is more scenic but will take longer than I-8 and is considered more hazardous, especially the "Rumorosa Grade".  The toll either to or from Tijuana is around $14.

By foot[edit]
Many people drive to the border, park on the US side, and walk across. There are many lots available for this, which charge US$4-9 a day. While there are many taxis waiting to take you across, it's only about a five minute walk; follow the signs across.

By plane[edit]

In addition, Mexicali has access to the Imperial County Airport IPL IATA, 15 mi (24 km) north across the border from Mexicali with flights from Los Angeles and Phoenix on Southern Airways.

Get around[edit]
Public transportation[edit]
Taxis are abundant in the city. You may either call for a site taxi (taxi de sitio) which are called beforehand and they can take you where you ask, or route taxis (taxi de ruta), which, like buses, have specific routes which they take.
There are also multiple public buses, which can range from old school refurbished school buses with no air circulation to brand new metrobuses with air conditioning and television screens, which are more expensive.

Stay safe[edit]
While Mexicali has saved itself from the severity and degree of violence along the US-Mexico border and the insecurity is not as big as that of Tijuana, there is still potential for it to become dangerous, along with the violence that a regular metro city has such as petty theft, violence, and gang-related incidents. The emergency number is 066. Avoid giving out money to beggars and homeless people standing in the street or along sidewalks and avoid buying things off the street to avoid trouble later.
To avoid becoming part of the ongoing violence, do not buy illegal drugs. Overstocking yourself with prescription drugs will also warrant getting checked. While partying and clubbing in Mexico is all in good fun and alright, keep in mind that you will not get away with it because it is Mexico. You probably will get caught and kept a special eye on because you are an American, even if you look Latino.
If you do anything unlawful, even if you are underage, you will spend time in prison. You do not get preferential treatment because you are an American citizen. Also, keep in mind that Mexico uses kilometers and not miles, and speed limits in KPH are much slower than MPH in the United States.
Do not try to bribe the Mexican police officers, even if they are hinting at it. If you try to bribe, you will go to prison. Driving while using a cellphone or a radio without a hands free device is illegal in the state of Baja California and it will get you ticketed. 
Trying to bargain prices will sometimes help, but in most places in Mexicali today it is not practiced and such behavior will be ignored.
Do not be caught with any type of weapon in Mexico. This can include a small pocket knife, or even ammunition or bullet casings. American motorists have been jailed for driving into Mexico with spent ammunition casings in their car trunk.
In the unlikely event of a major earthquake, duck and cover and stay where you are during the shaking, then go outside once the shaking stops. Buildings and other structures are unlikely to collapse. Your largest threats come from breaking windows and falling objects such as ceiling tiles and bookshelves. Try to get under a table, desk, or doorjamb to reduce your exposure to these threats. You are more likely to be injured if you try to run during the shaking.

Stay healthy[edit]
While the city's restaurants are registered by the Health Department and clean water is available city-wide, eating at roadside taco shops and drinking tap water is discouraged because one that is not used to this will probably get food poisoning. Avoid any foods you are not used to. Bottled water, carbonated and still, is available widely and you are encouraged to drink of it.
If you need emergency medical treatment, it is preferred that you attend a private hospital and call 066, attending a public hospital or a Seguro Social hospital will be futile, as they are only for registered Mexican citizens and have problems getting medical attention there. There are drugstores and private medical and dental clinics throughout the city.
A prescription from a licensed doctor in Mexico is needed to fill prescription drugs in any pharmacy in Baja California. These can be acquired at some pharmacies through their on-location doctor.

Connect[edit]
The country code for Mexico is +52, and the area code for the Mexicali Metropolitan area is 686. Phone numbers have 7 digits (XXX-XX-XX) and cellular phone numbers are dialed using access code 044, the area code, and the number (044-686-XXX-XXXX). Your mobile carrier will work if they have an agreement with either Telcel, Illusacel, Telefonica (Movistar), or Nextel. They may also work in the areas close to the international border with American carriers such as Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile.
Most hotels (and all of the high-end ones) have high-speed internet access and are wi-fi enabled. This is the same for shopping malls and coffee shops. You may also find hot-spots at college and university campuses throughout the city.

Go next[edit]
Guadalupe Canyon Hot Springs offers a running stream and a variety of primitive (hose-fed from local springs) hot baths and camping; the area is popular with Mexicali locals; it is 48 km (30 miles) down a rough dirt road, 32 km (20 miles) west of town on the road to Tijuana.  The area also contains a significant number of petroglyphs in nearby canyons accessible by foot.
San Felipe is 172 km (120 miles) south on Highway 5.
