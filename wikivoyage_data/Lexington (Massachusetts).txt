By train[edit]
There are no MBTA Commuter Rail stops in Lexington.  However, there are stations in several surrounding towns, including Belmont, Waltham, Lincoln, Winchester, and Woburn.
By car[edit]
First Parish Church
Lexington is most accessible by the two highways that run through it, Interstate 95 (Route 128) and Route 2.  On Interstate 95, take exit 31 or 32.  On Route 2, take exit 53, 54 (westbound only), 55 (eastbound only), or 56. From Boston or Cambridge, if you follow Massachusetts Avenue through Arlington to Lexington you are retracing the route that William Dawes (and to some extent Paul Revere) used to warn the colonists in Lexington of the approaching British troops.
By bus[edit]
MBTA bus #62 [1] and #76 [2] provide service to Lexington. They run from the Alewife subway station (the end of the line on the Red line) that bring you to the center of town, where 'the Green' is (site of the skirmish between British controlled forces and colonial irregulars).  Of these the 76 - Hanscom Field bus should also be able to bring you close enough to walk to some of the other Revolutionary War sites on the far side of 95 aka Route 128.
There is an intra-town bus service, Lexpress, which can be useful in getting to different points in the town. See  "Get around".
By bike[edit]
Minuteman Bikeway, Massachusetts Av. at Miriam Av. On the trackbed of the railroad. The bikepath starts at the Alewife subway station, near the Arlington/Cambridge border, and roughly parallels Massachusetts Avenue through Arlington and Lexington.
Get around[edit]
Most of the attractions and dining, shopping and entertainment options are in or near the town center, so be sure to first visit the center, and then fan out from there.
