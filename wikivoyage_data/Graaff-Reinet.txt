Graaff-Reinet is a town of 36,000 people (2011) in the Karoo Heartland. A touch of history wafts around the old houses, the small church and the busy main street of Graaff-Reinet. As one of the oldest cities in South Africa, it is littered with listed buildings from the Wilhelminian era, and has its own flair. The nearby Valley of Desolation attracts thousands of visitors annually with its desert atmosphere.


Understand[edit]
The Dutch Reformed church dominates the skyline of Graaff-Reinet
Graaff-Reinet was established in 1786 and is the 4th oldest town in South Africa and the oldest town in the Eastern Cape Province. It was established to bring law & order, religion and education to the many Dutch farmers on the Eastern Frontier. It was named after the then Dutch East Indian Company Governor of the Cape, Cornelius Jacob van der Graaff, and his wife Cornelia, whose maiden name was Reinet. The town is renowned for its architectural heritage and at 220 sites, has more national monuments than any other town in South Africa. It was once one of the largest centres in the Cape Colony, as it was on the direct route to the minefields of the interior. Today it still functions as an important farming centre with the raising of Merino sheep, Angora goats, ostriches and game being the main activities in this area of the eastern Great Karoo. It is also well known for the nearby Valley of Desolation, which today forms part of the Camdeboo National Park of about 15,000 ha.
