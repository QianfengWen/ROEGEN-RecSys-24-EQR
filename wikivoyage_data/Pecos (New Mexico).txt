The New Mexico Campaign

 When people think of key battles in the American Civil War, they tend to think of places like Gettysburg, Vicksburg, or Antietam, far to the east. But a deciding battle early in the war was fought here, in Glorietta Pass just west of the town of Pecos. In early 1862, a Confederate force marched up the Rio Grande from Texas with the intent of seizing Union strongholds in New Mexico before marching northward to capture gold fields in Colorado, securing substantial wealth and territory for the Confederacy while cutting California off from the Union. Initially the Texans were successful, overpowering Union forces in southern New Mexico and capturing Albuquerque and Santa Fe. However, Union reinforcements from Colorado were making their way south along the Santa Fe Trail, with the two forces meeting in Glorietta Pass. A fierce battle amidst the rocks and trees of the narrow pass followed, eventually resulting in the Union forces retreating. But during the battle, a small Union force had flanked the Confederates and destroyed the supply train at their rear. Without food or supplies and with no reinforcements on the way, the Confederates were forced to retreat back to Texas and abandon their plans for a Confederate-controlled West.

35.56-105.7855562 Glorietta Pass Battlefield. In the Glorietta Pass west of town, this battlefield was the site of a significant battle of the American Civil War, and today is administered as part of the Pecos National Historical Park. A 2.3 mile interpretive trail leads visitors to the site, although it is located on private land behind fences. To get there, first stop by the visitor center at Pecos National Historic Park (above) and the park rangers there will provide you with directions to the trail and an access code to get through the gate. An annual commemoration takes place on the last weekend of every March and offers demonstrations by historians and a living history encampment.   (updated Dec 2015)
Do[edit]
The Pecos Wilderness, a wild, roadless realm of the Sangre de Cristos that's popular with hikers and backpackers, is located north of town. NM 63 heads deep into the mountains alongside the Pecos River, dead-ending at Cowles near the headwaters of the Pecos and passing by several campgrounds and trailheads with ready access into the wilderness. The Santa Fe National Forest administers the wilderness and the lands surrounding Pecos and has a ranger station right in the middle of town on NM 63 just south of NM 50 (+1 505 757-6121; open M-Tu and Th-F 8-noon and 12:30-4PM), where you can purchase maps and get information on conditions in the forest.
Decent fishing can be found along the Pecos River between Pecos and Cowles, but be careful of private property restrictions.
