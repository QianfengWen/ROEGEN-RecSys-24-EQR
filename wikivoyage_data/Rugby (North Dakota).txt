Get around[edit]
If you come into town by train, you'll have to walk or hitch around town.  There isn't any public transport, taxi service, or car rental.  Not that this can be a bad thing if, say, you had a rail pass and wanted to spend a day in small-town North Dakota.
However, the more timid may want to take the train to Minot, rent a car, and circle back.
