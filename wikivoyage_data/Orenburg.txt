Orenburg (Russian: Оренб'ург, Uh-rehn-BOORK) is the capital of Orenburg Oblast. Every citizen will point you the sign at the bridge across the Ural river, supposedly landmarking the geographical border between Europe and Asia (the actual boundary is further east). Orenburg has a sizable Turkic population, which gives to the city a bit of a Central Asian colour.

The bestowing of a German name ("eastern walled town") on a brand new Russian fortress city would not sound unusual in 1743, when German-born nobles played a significant role in the Russian Empire. The chosen place, where the Or and the Ural rivers join, was the Empire's eastern border at the time.
Orenburg played a major role in Pugachev's Rebellion (1773–1774), the largest peasant revolt in Russian history. It was then a capital of a vast district, the seat of a Governor. Yemelyan Pugachev besieged the city and its fortress from nearby Berda from October 1773 to March 26, 1774. The defense was organized by Governor Lieutenant-General Reinsdorf. Most of the city was left in ruins, and thousands of inhabitants died in the siege. Imperial forces crushed the revolt towards the end of 1774.
Orenburg was the base for General Perovsky's expeditions against the Khanate of Khiva in the 1830s through 1850s. As Central Asia was absorbed into the Russian Empire, Orenburg became a trading station and, since the completion of the Trans-Aral Railway, a prominent railway junction en route to the new Central Asian possessions and to Siberia.
Alexander Pushkin visited Orenburg in 1833, during a research trip for "The History of Pugachev" and his novel "The Captain's Daughter", whose themes famously overlap. Here he met his friend Vladimir Dal, who would later write the first serious dictionary of the Russian language.
Orenburg functioned as the capital of the Kirghiz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (in present-day Kazakhstan) within Russia from 1920–1925. When that republic was renamed Kazak Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1925, Orenburg joined Russia.
From 1938 to 1957, the city bore the name Chkalov (Чка́лов), after the prominent test pilot Valery Chkalov. The city's distance from the German invasion during World War II led many Soviet enterprises to relocate here, helping to spur the city's economic growth.

Climate[edit]
Orenburg has a relatively dry humid continental climate with quite long and hot summers and long and cold winters. April and October are transition months, with the rest of the months being either summer or winter.
