Eastbourne is a popular and traditional sea-side resort town in East Sussex, on England's South East coast.  It has one of the highest recorded days of sunshine per year in Britain and its climate is notable for its relatively high sunshine levels, with the town claiming to be the "Sunniest Place in the UK".


Understand[edit]
Eastbourne Seafront
Eastbourne is about 110 km from London. It has a population of just over 100,000 (2021), making it the second largest town in Sussex. It lies at the eastern end of the South Downs range of chalk cliffs and hills: its most famous feature being Beachy Head, the highest chalk cliff in Southern England. To the east it is bordered by the low-lying flood plains of the Pevensey Levels and beyond.

The town has a reputation of being "God's waiting room" due to the high population of elderly residents, with one district of town having an average age of 71.1! Most of the population is younger, however, and you probably wouldn't see that many elderly people if you visited. The main shopping centre is being renovated to have more, better-known shops, which should make it even more popular with younger people.
Part of the town's charm is its largely undeveloped seafront, devoid of the amusements and loud activity associated with Brighton, its bigger and brasher western cousin.  Eastbourne's front remains composed mainly of Victorian hotels, as much of Eastbourne has traditionally belonged to the Duke of Devonshire, who retains the rights to these buildings and refuses to allow them to be converted into shops.
The lovely 1935 bandstand remains, and traditional seafront concerts still take place every day in the holiday season for those content to listen and laze in a deckchair.  The relative peace is only shattered in mid-August by the biggest event of the year for the town, "Airbourne". This justifably and proudly claims to be the South Coast's biggest free air display, and takes place over the sea attracting visitors of all ages during its four days. Many come just to see the world famous RAF Red Arrows who are regular visitors, but there are many other attractions at ground level too, such as live bands, with Scouting for Girls performing one year.

Visitor information[edit]

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The main roads into Eastbourne are the A27, which runs west to Brighton, and the A259, which heads east to Hastings. The A22 (joining the A27) goes north towards London.

"Welcome to Eastbourne - 'The Sunshine Coast'", this sign is usually only seen when it's pouring with rain.
By train[edit]
Southern Railway is the principal train company serving Eastbourne. It is linked by train to the west with Brighton, and to the east with Bexhill, Hastings and Ashford International (for Eurostar services to France and Belgium). There is a direct line to London, stopping in London at Clapham Junction, East Croydon and finally London Victoria, with trains running between two and three times an hour, journey time between 1 hour 20 minutes to 1 hour 45 minutes. If you arrive at Gatwick Airport, you can catch a Southern train to Eastbourne (which is the same train as the London Victoria-Eastbourne train), with journey times here taking about 50 minutes to an hour. Trains also come from Bedford via St Pancras and Gatwick Airport and into Brighton; although the train doesn't go to Eastbourne, you can either change at Haywards Heath or Brighton for a separate train to Eastbourne.
Fare and timetable information is available from the Southern Railway website or National Rail Enquiries- ☏ +44 8457 484950 (local rate call, UK only number)
50.7693770.2812571 Eastbourne Train Station (EBN), Terminus Road, BN21 3QJ. The main train station here, in the town centre. There is a taxi rank and a pick up/drop off point outside the station (head towards the ticket machines from the platforms, go right and leave through the exit past the photo shops), plenty of taxis will be waiting there for you. If not, there is a taxi freephone (for 720 taxis) through another exit; from the ticket barriers, turn left and go left past the health centre and barbers, the phone is in the outside wall on the right. See a station map here.   
50.7963590.2793662 Hampden Park Train Station (HMD), Station Approach, BN22 9ND. The second station in Eastbourne. For most attractions and hotels, it is easier to go into Eastbourne station and travel onwards from there, but for Willingdon, Hampden Park or Langney, this station is better. See a station map here.

By bus[edit]
Services within Eastbourne borough are mainly operated by Stagecoach Buses Ltd, which is the successor of the company to the world's first municipal bus operator. Stagecoach Buses also operate country services to Tunbridge Wells, Heathfield, Uckfield, Willingdon, Polegate, Pevensey Bay, Hailsham, Bexhill and Hastings.
Hailsham, Pevensey Bay, Polegate, Willingdon and Hailsham are included in the local Eastbourne fare zonal system. Within the fare zone system there is an unlimited day rover ticket for £3.00, while single fares can be £1.90 as far as Polegate, rising to a higher price if continuing to Hailsham. A weekly ticket is available from the driver for £11.50 to cover this zone.
Town services are covered by services 1, 1A, 2, 3, 5, 5A and the LOOP, while out of town services are covered by services 1X, 51 (251), 52 (252), 54, 98 and 99 (as at 28 November 2010).
To Hailsham: 1X, 51, 52, 54, 98;
To Bexhill and Hastings: 98, 99;
To Heathfield: 51 and 52;
To Tunbridge Wells: 251 and 252 (same buses as for Heathfield, which are then prefixed with a 2 from Heathfield);
To Pevensey Bay: 99
Brighton is served by Brighton and Hove Buses on services 12, 12X and 13X.  Brighton and Hove offer an excellent value all-day ticket for £5.00 from the driver, or £3.50 if purchased in advance on the Internet, which includes the return journey between the two towns and unlimited travel in Brighton and Hove. Those travellers who also wish to use local services in Eastbourne as well as wanting to go to Brighton for the day with unlimited travel, may wish to purchase an Explorer ticket on a Stagecoach bus for £5.50, which then gives total unlimited travel on most services in Kent and Sussex for one day, including all Stagecoach, Arriva and Brighton & Hove. The same explorer ticket on a Brighton and Hove Bus costs £7.00, so the same ticket from Stagecoach is better value.
Services 12 and 12X serve East Dean, Seaford, Newhaven, Peacehaven, Rottingdean and Saltdean en route to Brighton from Eastbourne.
Eastbourne's art deco bus station closed some years ago, but almost all services now stop in a buses-only area of the main shopping precinct at Terminus Road, near the railway station.  There is no formal bus office in the town centre, but information and timetables are posted at all stops in the central area. Limited bus information can be obtained from the Tourist Information office in Cornfield Road.

Events[edit]
The two biggest events in Eastbourne are Airbourne (in August) and the Nature Valley International (in June), with other events taking place mainly in summer. If you visit Eastbourne between May and September, visit the Western Lawns (near the Wishtower on the seafront, opposite the Grand Hotel) as quite often, there are events taking place there on the weekends.

The Red Arrows flying over the beach during Airbourne
 Beachlife Festival: , ☏ +44 1323 415 415 (phone number of the Eastbourne tourism agency).  This is an annual extreme sport festival that takes place around town, though mainly on the seafront around Princes' Park. Sports like roller skating, skateboarding, SUP (stand up paddleboard), roller hockey, BMX, windsurfing and "surfkraft" (extreme windsurfing) are all represented, amongst others. There is live music on stages during the event and there is no cost to visit. Late July-early August. (date needs fixing)
 Eastbourne Airbourne: , ☏ +44 1323 415 415 (phone number of the Eastbourne tourism agency).  This is an annual airshow that takes place over the sea on the 3rd weekend in August. Every summer, the Red Arrows, helicopters, parachutists, and other fast jets come and fly for four days. There are other ground attractions too, including live music. The main attractions are at the Western Lawns near the Wishtower, although you can get some pretty good views from the foot of the South Downs. It's free, although the organisers appreciate donations as it is quite expensive to run. (date needs fixing)
 Beachy Head Marathon: , ☏ +44 1323 415 442.  An annual marathon in late October that claims to be "one the biggest off-road marathons in the UK". It starts in the Meads area of Eastbourne, and routes round the nearby South Downs National Park, Cuckmere Haven, and Seven Sisters Country Park. The route does follow some quite difficult terrain, but the views are pretty impressive. There's also a 10K race which happens at the same time that only goes as far as Birling Gap and back, but still follows the Seven Sisters, giving good views of the sea. Entry costs at least £20 for the 10K race, and £36 for the marathon, with prices rising closer to the event, so if you want to enter, do it soon! (date needs fixing)
 Beer and Cider by the Sea: , ☏ +44 1323 412 000.  This is a beer and cider festival that takes place on the Western Lawns over the May Bank Holiday.

You can also get more expensive tickets, with reserved centre court tickets. (date needs fixing)

One of the new shiny entrances to the Beacon (formerly the Arndale Centre)
The entrance to the Enterprise Centre, hidden behind the town's train station
Part of Meads Street, the 'posher' shopping area of town
While it does not perhaps offer the same range as other more fashionable shopping areas like Brighton or Tunbridge Wells, Eastbourne has a good mix of the familiar "high street" names and unusual retailers.
50.7693260.2850021 The Beacon, BN21 3NW, ☏ +44 1323 643431. M-W 9AM-6PM; Th-F 9AM-7PM; Sa 9AM-6PM; Su 10:30AM-4:30PM (some restaurants open longer). The town's redeveloped main shopping centre, now with light modern architecture. The centre features a wide range of shops, including both national chains, and local independent stores. It has several restaurants including a Nando's. It is in the centre of the town, next to the train station, and with easy access to the shops on Terminus Road. 
50.7699440.2806622 The Enterprise Centre, Station Parade, BN21 1BD, ☏ +44 1323 639504, info@enterprise-centre.org. Next to the station is another often forgotten treasure. It has a feel of faded glory and better days when it was a vibrant place. Under one roof is everything you might need: fresh fruit and veg, a butchers and a fishmongers. It has an amazing bookshop which has thousands of new and secondhand books, and an ordering service for any book. There is a fair trade shop which is excellent. There are also opticians, complimentary therapy, a hair dressers and a beautician. A pet shop. A wonderful cafe called Jocelyn's where you can get gorgeous cakes, delicious soup and service with a smile!  There is also a shop devoted to stationery for stationery lovers called All Things Analogue.
For those with more eclectic tastes, 50.766340.2831263 Little Chelsea is a good area of town to visit.  While it's hard to ignore the several funeral directors in South Street and Grove Road, reflecting the higher than average proportion of aged residents of the town, there are many shops for those who want to live life to the full, whatever their age. Particularly recommended is Camilla's second-hand bookshop which is stacked to the ceiling with books on just about every subject imaginable, Mr & Mrs Doaks Bumper Bookshop selling children's books including a child-friendly teashop, a Belgian chocolate emporium and a Bang and Olufsen hi-fi and TV specialist dealer.
The 2-km-long road known as 50.7796290.3002684 Seaside (somewhat confusingly, just inland from the seafront) is like a mini-town, with two bank branches, post offices, takeaways, convenience stores, antique and curio shopping, furnishers, kitchen and carpet suppliers.  This is the main A259 road, and leads northwards to Langney, where there is a district shopping with a Tesco Metro, Iceland, Family Bargains and several other smaller stores.
50.7562420.2680825 Meads High Street is more of a traditional village high street in the "posher" part of town. Even though it has two small chain supermarkets, it still has several small, independent shops, including hairdressers, florists, cafes, a bike shop, and a physiotherapist among others. While some shops have closed, business is still thriving here. It is a good place to stock up on food and drink before going to explore the nearby South Downs, being only a few minutes from the edge of the national park, and the sea
50.7873180.3029746 Admiral Retail Park houses a large Tesco Extra store, Pets at Home, Homebase, Argos, Vokins, Wickes, McDonald's Drive-thru and Pizza Hut.
50.7958710.322677 Crumbles Retail Park comprises Asda, Next, Boots, Matalan, Harvey's, Brantano, Cineworld Cinema and Frankie & Bennys, which adjoins the man-made Sovereign Harbour development, which also houses a number of small shops, bars and restaurants.
50.7925480.2797328 Sainsbury's Retail Park in Hampden Park houses a Sainsbury's Superstore, DFS and a Currys/PC World, adjacent to which is the David Lloyd Centre and Lloyds Lanes Bowling Alley. Nearby are Dunelm Mill and Halfords.

Eat[edit]
As would be expected of a seaside resort, Eastbourne offers food to suit all tastes, budgets and time demands.  There are plenty of fast food outlets including McDonald's and Wimpy in Terminus Road.  However, for those wanting something a little more traditional, the best fish and chip restaurants include Seaquel and Qualisea, both around the junction of Terminus Road and Seaside Road, or the Dolphin fish bar on Seaside.
Fresh seafood and shellfish can be obtained near the pier or if you are in self-catering accommodation, you can buy and cook fresh local catches from the wet fish shops alongside the fisherman's boat stores on the seafront walking east towards Princes Park.
Many different cuisines are also on offer in Terminus Road, the main street for restaurants.  If you like a sea view along with good food and drink, try the Cafe Belge at the seaward end of Terminus Road, which offers around 80 Belgian beers along with a menu reflecting the culinary traditions of Belgium.
Development on the seafront is limited, but the hotel restaurants are always worth a try, as are the cafes and kiosks on the lower promenade — small establishments along the seafront, which are especially good in warm summer weather — including some that have opened in former seafront shelters.  Eastbourne seems to be trying to follow the lead of Brighton in making more of its beachfront for food and entertainment and several cafes and restaurants now open into the late evening on the shoreline.
There is also a good choice of bars and restaurants available in the Sovereign Harbour Waterfront development, including some big chains like Harvester and authentic smaller restaurants like the Thai restaurant there—  a great place during summer with views over the town's harbour.

Restaurants in Sovereign Harbour - summer evenings can be spent eating outside here, with views of the impressive yachts in the harbour

Drink[edit]
Eastbourne has plenty of pubs ranging from the traditional to the trendy. Particularly recommended for those who love, or want to try, the best local "real ale" are The Marine on Seaside, which also offers an excellent restaurant and bar menu- all day on Sundays. Also recommended are The Terminus, a refurbished Harveys of Lewes pub in the town centre. Most nightclubs are situated in Langney, Pevensey and Terminus Roads though the pier with the Atlantis nightspot is something of a honeypot for language students and other smart young things.
If you're looking for something refreshing but not intoxicating, there are plenty of stops for a cuppa and the usual coffee chains. The Pavilion Tea Rooms, east of the pier, are recommended for afternoon tea when a piano player often adds to the polite, typically English ambience of the place.

50.7680890.2859271 Urban Ground, 2A Bolton Road, BN21 3JX, ☏ +44 1323 410751, info@urbanground.co.uk. M-Sa 7:30AM - 6PM, Su and Bank Holidays 9AM - 5PM.

They give you an egg timer with your pot of tea to tell you when your tea is properly brewed. You can also visit the cafe at the Towner Art Gallery (run by Urban Ground), sitting on the balcony overlooking the sunset in the evening if you want. 
50.7714540.2951352 The Marine, 61 Seaside, BN22 7NE, ☏ +44 1323 720464. It is always a friendly and comfortable place, but is at its best around Christmas time, when an extraordinary array of festive lights turns it into a fairyland to enchant young and old alike. 
50.7727140.2669613 The Lamb, 36 High Street, BN21 1HH, ☏ +44 1323 720545. This is the oldest pub in Eastbourne in the Old Town area, built in the 12th century.

Sleep[edit]
Hotels are all along the seafront, so there won't be a lack of places to sleep. If you're walking along the promenade, you'll see hotel after hotel after hotel. And most of the town's 4- and 5-star hotels are, unsurprisingly, on the seafront and generally towards the Meads end of town.

50.7579040.2769171 The Hydro, Mount Road, BN20 7HZ, ☏ +44 1323 720643, sales@hydrohotel.com. Once featured in a TV Agatha Christie adaptation.

The Belle Tout was the first lighthouse at Beachy Head, until 1902 when a better-sited lighthouse replaced it. It was almost wrecked by Canadian artillery fire in the Second World War - the gunners clearly were much in need of practice. It was at risk of tumbling over the eroding cliff edge until in 1999 when, in a remarkable feat of engineering, the whole thing was shifted in one piece 17 m back from the edge. The system it slid along can be re-used, which might again become necessary circa 2030. It's now a very stylish B&B, with one room in the light tower and five in the adjoining house. No children under 15 or dogs. B&B double £160.  (updated Jun 2020)
There are also many "bed and breakfast" establishments such as The Sea Breeze Guest House [dead link]. There are self-catering flatlets such as "Beachside Guesthouse and Self-Catering Apartments" and there are also campsites on the edge of town such as Fairfields Farm. The town's Youth Hostel is in a very picturesque spot on top of the Downs going out of town westwards, near one of the golf links.
