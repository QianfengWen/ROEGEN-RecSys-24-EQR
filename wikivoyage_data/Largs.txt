Largs is a seaside resort on the Clyde coast of Ayrshire, with a population of 11,030 in 2020. It’s where Viking power in Scotland was broken, at the Battle of Largs in 1263, and the Vikingar Exhibition is the town’s main attraction. Largs is the ferry port for the short crossing to the Isle of Great Cumbrae, and a base for exploring Ayrshire.


Understand[edit]

The Battle of Largs was a small and indecisive affair, but it spelt the failure of a Norwegian sea expedition to re-assert their control in this region. They were beaten by storms more than Scots, in an era when climate change was sapping sea-borne power across the far north, and the Vikings disappeared from history to be replaced by Nordic nation states. Subsequently the Norwegians ceded Strathclyde, the Hebrides and the Isle of Man to Scotland, while retaining Orkney and Shetland. The Scots named the place An Leargaidh, “the slopes”. 
Not much else happened in Largs for another 600 years, and then its fortunes rose as the city of Glasgow expanded, becoming a fashionable place for city merchants to have a country retreat. Lord Brisbane, governor of New South Wales, was born here in 1773, and the physicist Lord Kelvin lived here. In the 19th century Largs became part of the “Costa Clyde” or “Glasgow Riviera” — the string of small resorts such as Troon, Ayr, Girvan and Arran. It remains popular in summer with day-trippers from the city. 
In 1944 King Haakon VII of Norway was in exile in Britain and was made the first honorary citizen of Largs, just to let bygones be bygones.

55.7945-4.8692 Largs Museum remains closed in 2022.
Largs Old Kirk behind the museum was demolished in 1802 when the new parish church opened, but its grounds (open May-Sep daily 2-5PM, free) contain two notable 17th-century tombs. The Skelmorlie Aisle is the ornate tomb of Sir Robert Montgomerie and his wife Dame Margaret Douglas (killed young in a riding accident). The Montgomeries lived at Skelmorlie Castle, some miles north of town, nowadays a private mansion which can’t be visited. The Brisbane Aisle is the 17th-century free-standing burial vault of the Shaws of Kelsoland.
55.7791-4.85953 The Pencil is a monument in the style of an Irish medieval round tower, built in 1912 to commemorate the Battle of Largs.
55.771-4.8444 Kelburn Castle: how come Disney never thought of doing up his castle like this? Or Ludwig II at Neuschwanstein? It's a large house 2 miles south of Largs dating to 14th century but prettified into a chateau in 1700. The facade needed replacing in 2007 and its owner Lord Glasgow hired Brazilian graffiti artists who gave it a bold, jazzy makeover. Lips were pursed by heritage officialdom, but M'Lud won them over and the graffiti stays. The castle and grounds are open Apr-Oct, with tours daily mid-Jul to early Sep. The nearby Kel Burn is scenic, rushing down from the hills.
Glengarnock Castle: see Kilbirnie for this battered medieval stump over the hills to the east.

William Smith was Largs church minister when plague struck in 1647, and many townsfolk fled to camp out in Noddsdale.

Largs is a popular tourist destination and has many hotels and B&Bs throughout the town. The bigger and more expensive hotels can be found on the beach front.
In the summer Largs can be rather busy and pre-booking hotels is recommended however there are many Bed and Breakfasts which offer rooms at an affordable price on a non-booking basis.

55.7973-4.86771 Brisbane House Hotel, 14 Greenock Rd, Largs KA30 8NE, ☏ +44 1475 687200. Decent hotel with grand views across the water. If you use their car-park, however briefly and even with a disabled sticker, you must promptly register the car at reception or you'll get a £100 fine. It would be sort of nice if they did a better job of warning their clients. B&B double £130. (updated Apr 2022)
