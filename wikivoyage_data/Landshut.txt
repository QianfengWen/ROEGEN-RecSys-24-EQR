Landshut
Landshut is the capital and the biggest city of Lower Bavaria in the German federal state of Bavaria. The city is best known for the Landshut Wedding (Landshuter Hochzeit), a quadrennial re-enactment of the actual medieval wedding, including knights' tournaments. In times the Wedding isn't scheduled, Landshut still is good for a nice day trip from Munich.


Understand[edit]
Landshut was founded in 1204 by Duke Louis I Wittelsbach. Not even 30 years later it already became residence, and after the division of the duchy of Bavaria in 1255 the capital of Lower Bavaria. In the 15th century the famous Landshut Wedding took place, one of the most splendid festivities of the Middle Ages. At the beginning of the 16th century Lower Bavaria and Upper Bavaria were reunited. Although Landshut at that point lost its status as capital, the 16th century was the city's architectural boom era. After that, Landshut lost most of its significance, besides a short time of importance in the beginning of the 19th century, when the University of Bavaria resided a mere 26 years in Landshut.
For a brief time towards the end of World War II, a subcamp of the Dachau concentration camp was located near Landshut. During the war Landshut only had to suffer one major Allied bombing, when the area around the train station was heavily hit. However, most parts of the city were virtually unharmed by the war, and much of the medieval city centre is still intact.
Since the opening of the new Munich International Airport close to Landshut in 1992, the city has become an attractive business location. In 2021, it had 73,000 residents

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Munich International Airport (MUC IATA), Europe's sixth busiest airport, is 40 km (25 mi) west of Landshut. It is a major hub for Lufthansa and its Star Alliance partners and offers connections from most airports in Germany and Europe, as well as from many intercontinental destinations. The airport is easily accessible by car via autobahn A 92. Furthermore, there is a bus service, that directly connects the city with the airport. The buses leave the airport once every hour and it takes approx. 40 min to reach Landshut, where the buses stop at Landshut Central Station and in the historic city centre. A one-way ride costs €10, with discounts for families and regular customers.

By train[edit]
Landshut Central Station is located 1 km (0.6 mi) north of the historic city center. It is a stop of approx. 120 regional trains daily, with frequent connections from Freising, Ingolstadt, Munich, Nuremberg, Passau, Regensburg, Rosenheim, and Salzburg. The hourly service from Munich takes approx. 45 min.

Get around[edit]
48°32′10″N 12°9′0″EMap of Landshut
Landshut is small enough to be explored on foot. The medieval city centre is a pedestrian zone with no motor vehicles allowed. Going by bike is an option, too. However, the extensive use of cobble stone pavement in the city can make for a very unpleasant ride. An alternative for the less sporty type is the city's bus network (StadtLinie). Its 15 lines will take you to every point of interest, within the city and the surrounding countryside.

48.53224912.1598511 Hofgarten, Pfeifergorigasse 1 (Bus: Landshut, Burg Trausnitz), stadtgartenamt@landshut.de. 6:00 — 21:00. After the city was founded in 1204 by Duke Ludwig the Kelheimer, today's Hofgarten was used as a zoo (Hag) until the middle of the 18th century. After that, the area was converted into a cultural enterprise and a state fur school for the cultivation of fruit trees was founded and silkworm breeding began. After the royal university was relocated from Ingolstadt to Landshut in 1800, the courtyard garden became the property of the university on September 30, 1804. At that time it was designated as an economic garden and was used for agricultural and forestry experiments until 1826. In June 17, 1836 the city of Landshut was able to acquire the Hofgarten after many years of negotiations, and it was made accessible to the public in 1837. (updated Jun 2023)

Do[edit]
Landshut Wedding
48.531312.1451 Bartlmädult Beer Festival (Bartlmädult), Grieserwiese (Bus 1, 10: Grieserwiese). Late Aug. One of the smaller and cozier festivals of its kind, with only about 200,000 visitors each year. In contrast to Oktoberfest in Munich, you can still find original Bavarian traditions at this festivity. 
48.535812.156542 Christmas fair (Christkindlmarkt), Ringlstrecherwiese (grass next to the Grieserwiese). Dec: M-Th 10:00-20:00, F Sa 11:00-21:00, Su 11:00-20:00. The Christmas fair in Landshut next to the Grieserwiese is the city's main attraction during Advent. The big illuminated Christmas tree and a cup of hot Glühwein (spiced wine) or alternatively Punsch in your hands and Christmas music and scents in the air will get you in the Christmas spirit. 
48.5334512.146923 Landshut Wedding 1475 (Landshuter Hochzeit). Summer. Festival held once every 4 years (next: summer 2023). Landshut's biggest attraction undoubtedly is the Landshut Wedding, the re-enactment of the medieval wedding of George the Rich, Duke of Bavaria, and Hedwig Jagiellon, the eldest daughter of the King of Poland, in 1475. Basically the whole city becomes a stage, as the festival takes place all over town, with different venues like Trausnitz Castle, the medieval city center and the Residence, when over 2,300 actors (mostly Landshut residents) bring the Middle Ages to life. During the three weeks of the festivities, Landshut is flooded with over 700,000 visitors from all over the world and becomes a bustling medieval metropolis, when everyone gets carried away with medieval jousting, pageantry, feasting and knights' tournaments. It even became custom to the citizens of Landshut to wear hair and clothes to the fashion of the Middle Ages, even if they are not part of the acting crew. The downside of the spectacle obviously is, that accommodation gets extremely scarce within the city - however, the proximity to Munich provides a feasible lodging alternative. €2.50-36.
