Kirants Monastery
41.01189544.9903367 Kirants and Deghtsnuti Monasteries. Another pair of virtually lost monasteries, these two are about 5 and 10 km of dirt trail past the last village, deep in the forest. The road is often closed to cars at the village, and you need to scurry around to get a key, but you will need to walk partway regardless. Kirants is built of burnt bricks, and has some glazed tiles in the copula as well as some small preserved frescoes. Deghtsnuti is in beautiful ruins, with arches still standing, nice carvings, and another great setting. Once again, a GPS is indispensable.
