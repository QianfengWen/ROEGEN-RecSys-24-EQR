Garut is a town in the Parahyangan mountain region of Western Java, Indonesia. It's located within Garut Regency.


Understand[edit]
In colonial times, Garut was known as 'the Switzerland of Java'. The town is surrounded by various mountains, including the Mount Galunggung volcano in the east, Mount Guntur volcano in the west, and Mount Cikurai volcano (over 2,800 metres high) in the south. 
Garut is the capital of Garut regency, which stretches from near Sumedang in the north to the Indian Ocean coast in the south.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Garut is about halfway between the cities of Bandung and Tasikmalaya. To get to Garut from Bandung, you will need to take the road over the Nagreg mountain pass. The journey takes about 2 hours if traffic conditions are good. However, serious traffic congestion is common on the mountain pass road.

By bus[edit]
On the northern side of the city, Garut's -7.20041107.905831 Guntur bus terminal serves a wide range of local, regional, and intercity buses. There are frequent buses from several bus terminals in Jakarta. For example, there are Primajasa buses from Lebak Bulus terminal in South Jakarta from 05:00-21:00 every half hour (Rp52,000). The journey from Jakarta usually takes about 5 hours, but this heavily depends on traffic conditions. 
Regular buses also depart from Cicaheum terminal in East Bandung. In addition, to travel from Bandung to Garut, you may opt to wait at the bus stop near the toll gate in Cileunyi (east of Bandung), because all buses from Jakarta and several other destinations pass here on the way to Garut.
