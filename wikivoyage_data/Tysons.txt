Tysons, originally known as Tysons Corner, is in Fairfax County, Northern Virginia. It is best known for its shopping malls and restaurants.


Understand[edit]
The original Tyson's Corner was the intersection of Leesburg Pike (VA-7) and Chain Bridge Road (VA-123), named for 19th-century landowner William Tyson. Since the completion of the Tysons Corner Center shopping mall in 1968, it has developed rapidly into a central business district in its own right, home to many consulting and technology companies, a variety of restaurants, and the largest concentration of retailers in the area outside of Washington, D.C. This growth has manifested largely as suburban office parks and sprawling shopping centers, however. After a long wait, Phase 1 of the Metrorail Silver Line was opened in 2014, which has stations in Tysons.

Get in[edit]
By public transport[edit]
WMATA, which operates the DC Metrorail, operates several stations in Tysons. For more information on riding the Metrorail, see Washington, DC#By public transportation.

By car[edit]
There is plenty of free parking. Tysons is conveniently located right by the intersection of I-495 (the Capital Beltway), I-66, and VA-295.

Get around[edit]
Tysons is small enough to get around on foot, although it is quite auto-friendly.

Great (non-chain) food is not far away. Falls Church in particular has fabulous destination dining, just across the Beltway at 2941 Restaurant (contemporary American, and easily some of the best in the D.C. area), as well as some of the best Vietnamese food outside Vietnam, particularly at Eden Center.
