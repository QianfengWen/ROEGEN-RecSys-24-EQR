Juneau (JOO-noh) is the capital of Alaska, in the state's Southeastern region. Juneau is on the North American mainland and yet cannot be reached by land. Effectively, the rugged mountains surrounding it make Juneau into an island city, reachable only by air or by sea. Juneau experiences a daily influx of thousands of people from visiting cruise ships between May and September.


Understand[edit]
It has a population of about 32,000 (2019). The municipality of Juneau, with an area larger than Rhode Island and Delaware combined, is the second largest in area in the country.  It has been the capital of Alaska since 1906, when the government of the then-Alaska Territory was moved from Sitka. Alaska became a state 53 years later.
It is the only state capital that can not be reached by land from the state it serves.  Moreover, Juneau is the largest US state capital in area and the only one that borders a foreign country.  The economy is based on government, tourism, mining, and fishing.
One of the interesting things about Juneau and Alaska is the effect on public life of being such a geographically large state with an "island" state capital. The state legislature, for instance, takes telephone testimony during its committee hearings. They have a state-wide video conferencing system to facilitate government meetings and deliberations.  There are more state employees in Anchorage (600 miles northwest) than in Juneau.

The climate in Juneau and the southeast panhandle is best described as a "cooler, wetter version of Seattle." It is a mid-latitude oceanic climate in the southern sections and a subarctic oceanic climate in the northern parts. On an annual basis, this is both the wettest and warmest part of Alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year. Juneau averages over 50 inches (1,270 mm) of precipitation a year, while other areas receive over 275 inches (6,990 mm). This is also the only region in Alaska in which the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months.
Average annual rainfall ranges from 55 inches to over 90 inches (1400 to over 2300 mm) depending on location; annual average snowfall is 101 inches (257 cm).
The average high temperature in July is 65°F (18°C), and the average low temperature in January is 20°F (-4°C).

Tourist information[edit]

Get in[edit]
Harbor view, Juneau and the rugged coastal mountains
Juneau is Alaska's capital and is on the mainland, but you can't get there by road or rail. Southeast Alaska is sandwiched between the rugged coastal mountain range and the Pacific Ocean. Constructing roads between many of the towns and cities of SE Alaska is prohibitively expensive and sometimes impossible. Only three towns (Haines, Hyder, and Skagway) in the SE Panhandle are connected by a roadway to the lower 48 states (often called "down south"). Access to the rest (including Juneau) is only possible by air or by sea.

By plane[edit]
58.35909-134.583561 Juneau International Airport (JNU  IATA) (7 mi (11 km) northwest of downtown Juneau.). The airport serves as a regional hub for all air travel, both bush carriers and the regional airline, Alaska Airlines, which provides daily jet service to Anchorage (600 mi northwest) and Seattle (900 mi south). Alaska Airlines also has regularly scheduled flights to Cordova, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Sitka, Wrangell, and Yakutat-- with summer service to Gustavus. Alaska Airlines and Delta Air Lines operate from Seattle to Juneau. Smaller airlines that operate regularly scheduled and chartered flights to Juneau from nearby communities have offices at the airport. The most trusted are Wings of Alaska, Haines Air, and Air Excursions. There are other airlines that fly to Juneau as well.   (updated Apr 2020)
By sea[edit]

Juneau is a main port for the 58.38201-134.687092 Alaska Marine Highway System (AMHS). , Alaska's ferry system.  The ferry runs regularly throughout Southeast Alaska with regular stops in Ketchikan, Petersburg, Wrangel, Sitka, Haines, and Skagway.  Small communities, such as Angoon, Hoonah, Tenakee Springs, Pelican, and Kake, get occasional AMHS service.  The closest port with a road connection is Haines, about a five-hour ride away from Juneau by regular ferry or a two-hour ride on one of the state's new catamaran ferries.  The ferry system is the only way to transport a car to Juneau, short of shipping it up on a barge. The ferry terminal is on the northern shores of Auke Bay at 13.8 mi (22.2 km) from Juneau on the Glacier Highway (Hwy 7). 
Juneau is a major port of call for cruise ships plying the Inside Passage, which bring several thousand visitors almost every day between May and September.  The cruise ships typically dock just south of downtown Juneau in the following docks, listed in order of distance from downtown Juneau, with nearby facilities:

Sea Drome Dock (SD) -- small ship
Alaska Steamship Dock (AS) -- large ship -- Library and parking garage
Cruiseship Terminal (CT) -- large ship -- Visitor Information Center (summer)
Intermediate Vessel Float (IVF) -- medium ship -- Mt. Roberts tram
South Franklin Street Dock (FKL) -- large ship
A J Dock (AJD) -- large ship -- the furthest dock sticking out into the harbor, 1 mile walk around the fuel depot or shuttle to CT and visitor information center
A typical summer day may have four or five cruise ships calling on Juneau, which could bring up to 10,000 visitors for the day.  To plan your day, check the cruise ship schedule for Juneau.
Juneau is also the Alaska home port for the luxury yachts of the UnCruise.

Get around[edit]
58°18′7″N 134°24′38″WMap of Juneau
On foot[edit]
Downtown Juneau is compact and very walkable, though above 4th Street it gets very hilly. The downtown streets are on a slanted grid, with Franklin, Seward, and Main Sts running parallel, and with Front, First, Second, Third, Fourth, etc., cutting across.  The State Capitol is at Fourth and Main, City Hall is at the foot of Seward and Marine Way, and touristy grazing is along Franklin.  Watch for the 20 historical plaques that detail the fascinating history of Juneau.

By bus[edit]
The public Capital Transit provides daily bus service for downtown Juneau and vicinity and charges $2.00 for travel in one direction (Oct 2019).  The Downtown Transit Center is on Main St and Front St, two blocks northwest of City Hall.  Route 3/4 serves the Mendenhall Valley, but can get you no closer than about a mile to the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center.
Capital Transit offers a Ride Free Zone that includes the Capitol, the Juneau-Douglas City Museum, the Dimond Courthouse, the hostel, and other locations at the top of the hill.
At the cruise ship docks, several bus services offer low-cost rides to the Mendenhall Glacier during the summer visitors season.

Mighty Great Trips "Blue Glacier Express" is a blue schoolbus that departs every 30 minutes, 9AM to 6:30PM on most summer days ($20 round trip).
Juneau Tours Glacier Shuttle runs from the cruise ships to the Mendenhall Glacier and back every 30 minutes on most days ($30 round trip).
By taxi[edit]
Taxis are an economical alternative.  Taxi vans can carry up to 7 passengers and cost about the same as buses for 5 or more.  Drivers who want to do tours can often be found in the taxi zones near the Mt. Roberts Tram or the Red Dog Saloon.  Metered fares and charter rates are regulated by the city.

By car[edit]
Car rentals are available at the airport and are necessary if you wish to explore the surrounding areas, outside of town on your own. The following are the main roads through the area:

 Egan Dr / Glacier Highway serves as the main highway through the area, spanning 40.5 mi (65.2 km), between Thane and Point Bridget State park in the north. It goes 4 mi (6.4 km) from Thane into Juneau as Thane Rd and another 36.5 mi (58.7 km) to its northern terminus at the southern shores of Berners Bay in Point Bridge State Park as Glacier Highway and through town as Egan Dr. It passes by the airport and the ferry terminal at Auke Bay.
Douglas-Juneau Bridge goes across Gastineau Channel between Juneau and Douglas Island. On the other side, the road goes around to the northwestern side of Douglas Island as Douglas Highway.

When the Russians were still in Sitka 50 years earlier, Father Ivan Veniaminov of the Russian Orthodox Church translated the Bible into Tlingit. Thus this building became southeast Alaska's oldest continuously operating church.   (updated Oct 2020)

Complimentary 30-minute tours are available from mid-May through mid-September. Free.   
 Mendenhall Glacier. This is a massive 1.5-mile-wide glacier calving into its own lake about 13 miles north of downtown Juneau. To get there, you may take a bus or taxi from where the ships dock to the Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area. You can pay the driver in cash or buy two tickets at one of the many kiosks on the dock. A taxi ride is about the same cost as a bus if you have 5 or more passengers. 
58.416718-134.547054 Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center, 6000 Glacier Spur Rd, ☏ +1 907 789-0097, fax: +1 907 789-6643. May-Sep: daily 8AM-7:30PM; Oct-Apr: Th-Su 10AM-4PM. Although you can't get right up to the glacier without a long walk, you can get a great view of it from the visitors center, which is operated by the US Forest Service and is very informative. Photo Point Trail and the salmon, bear and Steep Creek Trail are easy and accessible trails. In August and September, black bears, often with cubs, visit Steep Creek to feed on spawning sockeye (red) salmon. Some trails may be closed then. A series of viewing platforms let the bears walk underneath the many folks watching them fish. No food or soft drinks are allowed in the recreation area, and dogs must be on leash.If you want a moderate hike through some beautiful forest, try the East Glacier trail which loops around east of the visitors' center. Follow the trail clockwise to avoid having to climb many steps -- you'll come down those steps at the end of your hike and to keep the best views of the glacier ahead of you, instead of over your shoulder. $3 fee for visitors center from May to September. Activities outside the center building itself are free of charge, and visitors may use the restrooms and visit the bookstore without paying the fee. 
58.4186-134.6259495 Mendenhall Glacier West Glacier Trail. For the more adventurous, the West Glacier trail which leads directly to the glacier (you can walk on it, but be careful to stay away from crevasses!) and also to a look out. Get off the bus just past the Mendenhall Glacier Campground stop. The stop is called Montana Creek. Walk up the road to the car park at the end (around 2 km) and you will see the trail-head. Stick to the path, maybe dropping down to the lake side to checkout the icebergs and grab some photos. Continue along the path, across several bridges and up some switchbacks with fixed cables. Soon you will come to fork in the path, the left is steep and heads to the lookout, the right goes downhill into some dense vegetation. Shortly into the right-hand trail you will come across a shelter slightly off the track. Continue for several miles along the track, taking care on the slippery rock areas. Eventually you will come to a break in the cliff where it is possible to scramble or climb to the top. Recommend taking crampons if you want to walk on the glacier, stay away from crevasses and don't fall in. There are usually guides walking people out there so watch where they walk. Return the way you arrived, the whole thing should take about 5 hours. Don't forget to sign out when you leave the area.

It's difficult going in places, but provides some stunning views of the channel and city far below. If you don't want to pay $27 to ride up the tram, you can also hike the whole mountain. The trailhead is on Basin Road and takes about an hour to climb up to the top of the tram. A one way tram ride down the mountain is $5 or free if you eat at the restaurant at the top and show your receipt. $27 adults, $13.50 children, 5 and under free.   (updated Oct 2016)

Do[edit]
The most popular activities in Juneau for visitors are shopping, flight seeing, charter fishing, visiting the Mendendhall Glacier, and hiking. Be aware that Juneau is very spread-out. It is broken into sections. There is "Downtown", and "The Valley" (where the Mendenhall Glacier, Mendenhall Mall, a skate park, and most of the residential are located). The distance between the two is a good 15 minutes.
Of the cruiseship tour options, an air tour leaves the biggest impression—especially if the weather is clear. Behind Juneau lies the Juneau Icefield. Helicopter and floatplane tours are available. The most popular floatplane tour is with Wings Airways to the Taku Lodge. Most of the helicopter tours include a stop landing on the glacier. Trips are fairly expensive (about $200 per person and up, depending on the length of the excursion), but a remarkable experience that many consider well worth the price. Alternatively, get a group together and charter a small airplane tour. These will generally be less expensive (you pay by the hour) and allows you to customize your experience. Ward Air is highly regarded, but Wings of Alaska and other carriers offer charter flights.
Be sure to go for a hike while in Juneau. There are over 90 hiking trails in the area (many very steep). A few lead to rental cabins available from the US Forest Service or State of Alaska parks. If you want a guide, Gastineau Guiding  offers guided hikes on many popular trails and combines some hikes with whale watching or kayaking.

Buy[edit]

Drink[edit]
By far the most popular with locals is the Alaskan Bar (South Franklin Street) to hang out with locals, listen to music (Thursday is open mic night) and drink an Alaskan (beer) with an Alaskan in the Alaskan. A bit rough looking but a great hangout.

Respect[edit]
Juneau is in a temperate rain forest, so complaining about the rain will probably warrant a few eye rolls, or flat-out rudeness.

Dawes Glacier at the head of Endicott Arm, 2010
Juneau is a great place to base for a camping vacation or cruise tour.  It's the gateway to the Admiralty Island National Monument[dead link] and the Tracy Arm/Ford's Terror Wilderness Area[dead link].  Both areas are popular with kayakers.

The U.S. Forest Service operates two campgrounds[dead link] on the Juneau road system, one at Auke Bay Recreation Area at the site of Juneau's original Tlingit village, and one located on Mendenhall Lake near Mendenhall Glacier.
If you don't want to tent camp, there are a number of public use cabins in the Juneau area, some on trails accessible from the Juneau road system.  Those located in state parks are operated by Alaska State Parks[dead link], and those located in Tongass National Forest[dead link] are operated by the U.S. Forest Service.  They are often fully booked for weekends and holidays early in the year, but it's possible to find cabins available on weekdays.
Tracy Arm/Sawyer Glacier and Endicott Arm/Dawes Glacier are two spectacular deep-water fjords with active tidewater glaciers at their termini (Dawes, a compound glacier, is about 20 stories high and a mile across).  The mouth of these sister fjords (Tracy is the north arm and Endicott the south arm) is about 50 miles south of Juneau, off Stephens Passage east of Admiralty Island, and both fjords/glaciers are accessible by cruise ship big and small.  Small vessel day cruises operate daily in the summer.
