Golden is a small town in the Columbia-Rockies portion of the Kootenays in British Columbia near the Kicking Horse Mountain Resort.


Understand[edit]
Golden, British Columbia
The town was established in 1883 as a railway base camp named Cache. The name was later changed in an effort to compete with the nearby camp of Silver City. Since 2000, and the development of Kicking Horse Mountain Resort, Golden has become increasingly tourist-oriented.
Golden has a population of less than 4,000 (2021), but a drawing area of approximately 15 000. The face of the town is changing with the development at the ski resort, drawing a multitude of transient visitors and wealthy Albertans and international visitors purchasing second homes.
There are two visitor information centres in Golden.

Note: There is major construction to expand a 4.8 km (3.0 mi) section of the Trans-Canada Highway just east of Golden, through the Kicking Horse Canyon, to four lanes. You may encounter delays and stoppages due to construction, closures of up to nine hours overnight, multi-day extended closures from April 1 to the end of May and from mid-September to the end of November.

Get around[edit]
51°18′7″N 116°58′0″WMap of Golden (British Columbia)
Golden is so small that you don't necessarily need a car (especially if you are staying in the proximity of the centre). The town is divided by a river and each side has a supermarket (IGA on the north, SavOn on the south) which makes it easy to get the necessities by foot.
During the winter months, Kicking Horse Resort runs a Snow Shuttle ($6/trip as of Feb 2007 - daily, weekly, monthly passes are available) which runs every 2 hours or so. The Snow Shuttle does a route going around town, up along the strip on the highway (Trans-Canada 1) and up to the mountain.
Of course, the easiest thing is to have a car, especially if you want to explore. There is a National Car & Truck Rental, 915 11th Ave S, ☏ +1 250-344-9899, in town, however, their fleet is very limited.  There may also be some in nearby towns (Kamloops, Revelstoke, Canmore, Invermere). Otherwise Calgary would be a good bet.

 Mount 7 Taxi, ☏ +1 250-344-5237. Open 24 hours per day. A trip across town will probably cost you $10-15, up to Kicking Horse is likely $30-40. (updated Jul 2022)
