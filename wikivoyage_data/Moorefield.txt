Moorefield is a town in the Potomac Highlands region of West Virginia. This article also covers the nearby city of Petersburg and the surrounding area in the South Branch Valley.


Understand[edit]
Moorefield is the main settlement on the South Branch of the Potomac River, and the county seat of Hardy County.  It sits in the center of an unusually large area of flat land for the area, being completely surrounded by rugged mountains.  The South Branch Valley used to be one of the more remote areas of West Virginia, but with the construction of U.S. 48 as a four-lane divided highway in the early 2010s, it is now much easier to reach.
Unlike the regions surrounding Davis to the west and Wardensville to the east, the South Branch Valley is not particularly touristy, instead being dominated by poultry and cattle farming.  It however makes a good side trip from those two towns, as Moorefield has many more options for retail and dining.  It is also itself a good base from which to explore the surrounding backcountry.
Hardy County has a tourism web site with an email contact link for more information. 

Get in[edit]
Map of Moorefield
Moorefield is not served by public transportation.  No bus, train, or passenger airline service exists.
From anywhere outside the Appalachians, the best driving route is to take U.S. 48, which connects to I-81 near the I-66 junction in the east, and to I-79 in the west.  As of 2020, most of U.S. 48 is a four-lane divided highway, with the exception of the easternmost portion from Wardensville to Strasburg, and a segment from north of Elkins to Davis.
If you're already in the Appalachians, U.S. 220 is the main north-south highway through the regions.  It is a two-lane highway, so unless you're already close, it probably makes more sense to cut over to the Interstates and take U.S. 48 instead.

Get around[edit]
Moorefield has no public transportation.  You will need a car to get to most destinations.

Cellular voice service is pretty consistent throughout the region, but cellular data appears to be limited to 1x (for Verizon at least). Moorefield is on the northern fringes of the National Radio Quiet Zone, which might be the reason for this. Also, note that there is no cellular service along U.S. 48 east of town almost all the way to the Virginia state line.
