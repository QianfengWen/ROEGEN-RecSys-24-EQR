Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Aki is served by Kochi Airport (KCZ IATA), which is 35 minutes away by car.
By public transport, the best way from the airport to Aki is to take the omnibus taxi to Noichi Station (10 minutes and ¥500), where you can change to the train (35 minutes and ¥710) or bus (45 mins and ¥750). These must be booked at least 3 hours in advance: you will have to call one of the two numbers given (depending on whether you are going to or from the airport) and tell them your name, contact details, number of passengers, flight number, and whether you have large luggage (such as suitcases). If doing this is too much for you, the alternative is to take a bus to Kochi Station; this is a large detour, and should be avoided if possible.
The nearest airport with regular international flights is Takamatsu; from there, take the bus to JR Kotohira Station and change there to a Limited Express train towards Kochi. Other international airports worth considering are Okayama and Osaka-Kansai.

By train[edit]
Aki is served by 6 stations on the non-JR Tosa Kuroshio Railway Asa Line, usually known as the Gomen-Nahari Line, which branches off from the JR Dosan Line at Gomen. Much of the line is elevated, and therefore offers good views of Tosa Bay to the south (on the right of trains from Gomen to Aki).
There are usually one or two trains per hour to Aki from Gomen: Rapid trains take 35 minutes, while Local trains take 45 minutes. Either type costs ¥910. Some of these trains run directly to Kochi (55 minutes and ¥1170), while others require a change at Gomen. An alternative option for travel between Kōchi and Aki is to take the streetcar to Gomemmachi and change there to the train: from Harimayabashi this takes at least 1 hour 10 minutes and ¥1170.
For most long-distance travellers, the best way in by train is to take a Limited Express towards Kochi (Nampū from Okayama or Shimanto from Takamatsu) and change at Gomen.
While the Japan Rail Pass does not cover the Gomen-Nahari Line, most rail travellers from outside Shikoku should still consider buying it for use as far as Gomen. Alternatively, the ALL SHIKOKU Rail Pass (which is available to Temporary Visitors with foreign passports) covers travel on all railways in Shikoku, including the Tosa Kuroshio Railway.

By highway bus[edit]
Tosaden Kōtsū and Hankyū Bus operate two Yosakoi buses a day (one day, one night) to Aki from Osaka Umeda (Hankyū Sanbangai), as an extension of their service to Kochi. The day bus takes 6hrs 45mins, while the night bus takes 8hrs 20mins; either costs ¥6850 (¥12,400 return, valid for 10 days).

By local bus[edit]
Kōchi Tōbu Kōtsū run 6 buses a day from Kannoura, which is the end of the train line along the east coast from Tokushima, taking 2hrs 20mins and costing ¥2880.
They also run 10 buses a day to Kochi (Harimayabashi), taking 1hr 40mins and costing ¥1240. These do not serve any JR stations.

Get around[edit]
Most of the sites can be easily accessed by a 20-30 minute walk from Aki Station or a 10 minute bike ride. Free rental bikes are available at the souvenir shop outside Aki Station.
