Madaba [dead link] is a small town in central Jordan located south of the capital Amman on the King's Highway, some 10 km from Hesban.


Understand[edit]
Church floor with Jerusalem & the Holy Land
A town with a long history, Madaba is best known as the location of the "Madaba Map", a 6th-century mosaic depiction of Jerusalem and many parts of the Holy Land.
In biblical times the city was part of the Moab Kingdom. After having been conquered by the Persians and after a devastating earthquake in 746 A.D., the city was left alone and remained mostly abandoned until 1890, when the reconstruction of a Greek Orthodox church revealed the famous mosaic.
Madaba with about 80,000 inhabitants is approximately 10% Christian (Catholics & Greek Orthodox). Much of the traveller and pilgrim infrastructure is run by the Franciscans. For the Bedouins living around the area, Madaba is an important market place.

Get in[edit]
31°43′6″N 35°47′43″EMap of Madaba
The city is 25 km from Queen Alia International Airport and 35-40 km from the Dead Sea, potentially making it the ideal place to start or end your trip to Jordan.

By bus[edit]
31.71510135.7988241 Madaba Bus Station (in the east of town, next to the highway). (updated Oct 2018)
Madaba is about 1 hr from Amman. Buses from Amman's Tabarbour Station cost 1.20 JD (Oct 2018). Also, there are frequent minibuses from the 7th circle in Amman (1 JD)—they come from the center direction and take a turn south onto the airport road, directly after which you will find the bus stop.
You can also get buses from the Mahatta bus station, and minibuses from the Muhajireen bus station near the Jordan Museum (0.65 JD) which enter Madaba from the west rather than from Airport Rd.

By taxi[edit]
A taxi is a good option, especially if you're in a group. The cost depends on your bargaining abilities but it can go from 8-12 JD. Or you go by meter, which is about 12 JD. from northern Amman.  Service taxis leave from Airport Rd near 7th Circle and cost 2 JD per person.
Because Madaba is close to Amman, Uber is available throughout town, including at Mount Nebo. The Uber price from the airport to Madaba city centre was around 6 JD as of Feb 2019.

By car[edit]
The very centre of town has narrow, crowded streets, but just a few hundred metres away, you can find wide roads with plenty of parking.

Get around[edit]
Madaba is a very small city, so one can easily get around by on foot, although a taxi from downtown to the bus station is a good idea (1-2 JD). Taxis traveling within the city do not use the taxi meter but operate at a standard fare of 1 JD per trip. Make sure you agree on this price with the driver before hopping on. Uber is also available inside the city. Very good option for a ride to Mt. Nebo (around 5 JD from Madaba center) (Feb 2019).

There are many little falafel and kebab places, some better than others.

Alcohol is widely available and there are a lot of liquor shops in town.
