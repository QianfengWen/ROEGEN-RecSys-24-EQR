Get in[edit]
By boat[edit]
Galiano Island is the closest and most convenient to Vancouver. Galiano is the perfect island for "island hopping." Visitors can stay on Galiano, and use BC Ferries (or a summer water taxi) for visits to other islands, returning to Galiano at the end of the day.

By ferry[edit]
 BC Ferries, toll-free: +1-888-223-3779. Car ferries connecting the larger of the Southern Gulf Islands (Galiano, Mayne, Pender, Salt Spring, and Saturna) with Vancouver (Tsawwassen) ferry terminal in Delta and Victoria (Swartz Bay) ferry terminal near Sidney. Free reservations are strongly recommended, especially in the summer and can be made online or by phone.   (updated Jun 2022)
48.87658-123.314881 Galiano Island (Sturdies Bay) ferry terminal, 2622 Sturdies Bay Road. Is the first stop on the BC Ferries' route to the Southern Gulf Islands from Vancouver (Tsawwassen) ferry terminal, a 55 minutes crossing. In the quiet season there are just two ferries a day from Tsawwassen. In the busier summer months, there may be up to 4 sailings a day.  (updated Oct 2023)  If traveling with a car, reservations are advisable and there is no additional charge for reserving on the Gulf Islands Route. If you want to, it is very feasible to leave your car behind on the mainland, and travel as a foot passenger to see Galiano. There are several sailings a day from Victoria (Swartz Bay) ferry terminal, ranging from direct 1 hour and 10 minute crossings, to multi-stop "island-hopper" ferries.
By water taxi[edit]
In the summer months only (July and August), a water taxi operates on Saturdays between the dock beside the ferry terminal on Galiano Island and the Village of Ganges on Salt Spring Island. The remainder of the year, the same boat provides school transportation between Galiano Island and Salt Spring Island from Monday to Thursday. Space permitting, non-school passengers can ride the school trips. 

By charter boat[edit]
Private charter boats are also available at the discretion and timing of the passengers which affords guests the convenience of their own time table as well as privacy. These are reservable and can fit parties of almost any size, though they are more expensive than taking BC ferries.

By private boat[edit]
Visitors and residents arriving by boat can certainly find lots of moorage space.

Galiano is the second largest of the Southern Gulf Islands: approximately 27 kilometers long and very narrow. While hiking can take you to many beautiful places on Galiano, it also helps to have a little assistance with transportation.

Do[edit]
Galiano Island has as many amenities as larger centres, but they are smaller, more one-of-a-kind. There is as much to do on the island (and its surrounding waters) than other vacation places in British Columbia, but without the crowds or signs of urbanization. Many world-class artists make their home on the Gulf Islands, and Galiano is no exception. Be sure to combine the outdoor activities with a visit to an artist's studio, a visit to the spa, and a glass of wine with some live music at a local watering hole.

Island-hopping - Galiano is the Gateway to the Gulf Islands, with easy first-stop ferry access from Vancouver, and many travel options via inter-island ferries to explore the other islands.
Spa
 Galiano Oceanfront Inn & Spa (Madrona del Mar Spa). See listing under Sleep section for further information. (updated Apr 2023)
Art Tour - Take a tour around the island (pick up an Art Tour guide at the Tourism Information Booth or one of the local businesses) and visit some of the great art studios in the forest homes of the artists, or see several of them at Art and Soul Gallery in the Village. Many are walking distance from the ferry, in the Village. Or take a drive to visit artists in their studio galleries throughout the island. See the Buy section for some locations.
Hiking - Hiking trails are everywhere, and the vantage points atop Mount Galiano, Bodega Ridge and Bluffs Park present spectacular views across the other Gulf Islands, all the way to the mountains of Washington state.  You can also walk along Mathews Park Beach. Depending on where you hike, may be able to see Orcas in ocean, Bald Eagles in air, and wandering deer.
Whale watching - The beautiful Orca (killer) whales are at home in the waters off Galiano Island, following the food source (salmon and other fish) in pods through Active Pass.
 Salt Spring Adventures, ☏ +1 250-537-2764. For a closer view of whales, take a whale watching boat tour.  Note that the tour operator is on Salt Spring Island, though for an additional fee, offers tours starting from the Government Dock attached to the Galiano Island's BC Ferries terminal dock. (updated Apr 2023)
Cycling - Bicycle and mountain biking trails are definitely strenuous, but well worth it. Just ensure that you stock up on water and supplies when leaving the village of Sturdies Bay, or at the Corner Store just 3 kilometers further but still on the South End, as there are no shops or services traveling north on the island. You will need to bring your own bicycle as there are no bicycle rentals on the island.  See the Get Around section for eBike rental options.
Boating, kayaking, and fishing
Kayaking - See the islands as they should be seen, from the water. The waters of the Island and the islets that surround Galiano are relatively sheltered. Explore the islets and inlets.  See seabird cliffside colonies, seals and whales. Or pack a picnic lunch and paddle to nearby James Bay (Prevost Island), part of Gulf Islands National Park Reserve. There are no services at James Bay (Prevost Island) so bring plenty of drinking water with you.
Boating -  Explore hidden bays and beaches that are to be found in Trincomali Channel or spend an afternoon at Ganges on Saltspring Island or a shell beach for a picnic. A trip to Wallace Island for an afternoon is a must. Whales such as J Pod can often be seen as they pass through Active Pass, or view the seal colonies on Collinson Reef or Gossip Island

Stay safe[edit]
If you are boating or kayaking, be aware of the busy waters on the east side of the Galiano island between Galiano and Mayne Islands.  This area of water is known as Active Pass.  Active Pass is relatively constricted, especially given that the largest of BC Ferries' vessels travel through here at frequencies of up to multiple times per hour in the summer.  Stay closer to the shores and consider spending more of your time on other areas, which will be less busy.
Roadways on the island are narrow with no shoulders, so bicyclists and hikers need to take care.
