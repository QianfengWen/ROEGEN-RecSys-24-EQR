Kingston is on the Kitsap Peninsula in the Puget Sound region of Washington state. Kingston, on the shore of Appletree Cove, is a 30-minute ferry ride from Edmonds for cars and walk-ons.
A rip-roaring lumber town 100 years ago, it's quieter now as the constant whine of the sawmill has given way to the occasional blast of a ferry whistle.
Known as the "Little City by the Sea", Kingston is the northern gateway to the Kitsap Peninsula and Olympic National Park & Forest.


Understand[edit]
Boats docked at Kingston
An early settler named Michael King came to the area in 1878. He moved in along with 10 oxen and 10 men. They slowly logged the hills around Appletree Cove. Mr. King built many small buildings and shacks along the shore for his men and animals. In 1882, the trees were gone and King moved on. The shacks and bunkhouses were left behind and lived in by drifters, squatters and old loggers. People living in the area often referred to this as King's Town, probably as a joke. The name slowly evolved in to Kingston and stuck.
The Kingston townsite was platted on April 24, 1890 by C.C. Calkins and Samuel B. Brierly. Calkins dreamed of Kingston as a resort town for vacationers from Seattle. Calkins called it The Monterey of Washington. Calkins had drawings and designs for a giant hotel on the waterfront, with a boat launch, a church on the hill, along with a college. After Calkins and Brierly platted the town, a lower than expected number of people showed up to settle there. Calkins then gave up and left. The town slowly grew, but not at the pace that Calkins had dreamed and it eventually became the quaint harbor town we know today.

They also developed a checklist of birds likely to be seen birds in the area.
The state Audubon society developed 'The Great Audubon Birding Trail' which includes key migration flyways.  Flyways are major north-south routes of travel for migratory birds and likely areas to see birds along the route extending from Alaska to Patagonia. Point No Point County Park near Hansville just north of Kingston at Kitsap Peninsula's northern tip is particularly important for birds migrating the Pacific Flyway. The Audubon Society designated it an IBA or an Important Bird Area and it is easily accessible from Kingston.
