Madikeri[dead link] (also Mercara) is a beautiful hill station and capital of Kodagu region of Karnataka State, between Mangalore and Mysore. It has a population of over 33,000 people (2011).


Understand[edit]
The history of Madikeri is related to the history of Kodagu. Kodagu became the part of British India after 1834.
The history of Madikeri is related to the history of Kodagu. From the 2nd to 6th century AD, the northern part of Kodagu was ruled by Kadambas. The southern part of Kodagu was ruled by Gangas from 4th to 11th century. After defeating the Gangas in the 11th century, Cholas became the rulers of Kodagu. In the 12th century, Cholas lost Kodagu to the Hoysalas. Kodagu fell to the Vijayanagar kings in the 14th century. After their fall, the local chieftains (Palegars) started ruling their areas directly. These were defeated by the Haleri kings who ruled Kodagu from 1600-1834 AD. Haleri kings made the place Haleri, near Madikeri as their capital. Mudduraja, the third king among the Haleri kings started levelling the land around Madikeri and built a fort in the year 1681. This place was named as Muddurajakeri which later became Madikeri. Kodagu became part of British India after 1834.
The traditional sari is worn here in reverse, and you can still see older women wearing it in the traditional Kodagu style.

Get in[edit]
By road[edit]
Madikeri lies on the Karnataka State Highway 88 that runs from Mysore to Mangalore. It is 120 km west of Mysore and 136 km southeast of Mangalore. From Bangalore, the state capital of Karnataka, take the State Highway 17 (Bangalore-Mysore highway) and take a deviation just after the town of Srirangapatna to join State Highway 88 towards Madikeri. From Bangalore, Madikeri is at a distance of 252 km. The nearby towns are Hassan (115 km) in Karnataka and Kannur and Tellicherry in Kerala (each around 115 km away).

By rail[edit]
Madikeri does not have a railway station. The nearest railheads are in Hassan, Kasaragod, Cannanore and Tellicherry (each of which are almost equidistant 115 km away). Mysore and Mangalore have railway stations with very good rail connectivity and are good alternatives to reach Madikeri.

By air[edit]
Madikeri does not have an airport. The nearest airports are in Mangalore (136 km away) and Kozhikode (180 km). Bangalore Airport is an alternative. However, Kannur International Airport, which started services in 2018, is now the closest airport to Madikeri.

Get around[edit]
12°25′0″N 75°44′0″EMap of Madikeri
Taxis and autorickshaws are available at reasonable rates. Local buses are not available in plenty. Walking may look tedious inside the town but once you are one km away from the main road it is a very pleasant experience with the smell of coffee piercing your nose.

See[edit]
12.4582675.719551 Abbey Falls. Beautiful falls 7-9 km from Madikeri (depends where you are). Abbey means "falls" in Kannda. The falls are inside a coffee plantation. Abbey Falls is a breathtaking waterfall where the Kaveri river cascades down a rockface. A hanging bridge has now been built across the gorge here offering a good view of the falls. A rickshaw to the falls and back with half an hour stop is ₹150, but if you would like to take a swim at the pool, then a longer stay is advised. Negotiate the price beforehand, aim for around ₹200 for a 2-hr stay.   
12.368575.904952 Dubbare Elephant camp (accessed from the road connecting Madikeri and Kushalnaga, turn off 3 km from Kushal Nagar and then travel 10 km on that deviation). The road in passes through scenic rice fields and coffee estates. Activities include boat rides, rafting and the cauvery. Crossing the river to take you to the camp is quite adventurous. 
 Kushal Nagar. The largest Tibetan settlement in Southern India and monastery locally called "Golden Temple", in Bylakuppe, near Kushal Nagar. There are 2 monasteries nearby, one old and the other is new. Don't miss the new, on the way, while going towards old one. You can shop for Tibetan and Chinese handicrafts, decorative and religious items. 
12.4407475.936163 Nisargadhama (3 km from Kushalnagar). A beautiful picnic spot called Nisargadhama. Park is not too great, has some bamboo "machans" on trees, but the best part of it is the river is on the back-side. If you want to go for elephant ride at Nisarga Dhama, please remember to buy ride-tickets along with your entry-ticket before you get in. They do not sell ride-tickets inside; it is a 0.5-km walk back to ticket counter if you forget. 
12.4205675.741784 Omkareshwara Temple. A complex of two temples and a stunning pond in the middle of Medikeri. 
 Raja's Seat. Legend says that the local rajas used to watch the sun set from here. There is a nice garden and a beautiful panoramic view to the valley. In the middle of Madikeri, ask for directions from the point you are in and walk (or take a rickshaw). It's a fantastic scene during sun rise or sunset. 
12.3835975.494185 Talakaveri (Tala Kaveri) (42 km from Madikeri). The source of the Cauvery river. The river is famous for annually over flowing the banks here on 17 or 18 October. It is an important pilgrimage site for Hindu people. Cauvery river starts here. You can see a very beautiful view of western ghats by climbing the Brahmagiri Hill. Can be reached by bus. 
 General Thimmayya Museum, Madikeri town (1 km.). 10AM-1:30PM and 3-6PM. One of the best war museums in India inaugurated by the President himself. Huge cement shoe and other attractions.

Madikeri Fort[edit]
12.4208575.738976 Madikeri Fort.   This 19th century fort, in the centre of Madikeri, houses a Ganesha temple, a chapel, a district prison and a small museum. The fort offers a beautiful view of Madikeri. Mercara, the headquarters of Kodagu district, was founded by Prince Mudduraja of the Haleri Dynasty in 1681 CE, and was named after him as Muddurajanakeri -- which became "Muddukayray" and Madikeri over time. 
Mudduraja built a mud fort and a palace inside the fort, in the last quarter of the 17th century. This fort was later rebuilt of granite masonry, after it was captured by the "Tiger of Mysore" Tipu Sultan. Tipu named it Jaffarabad. In 1790, Doddaveer Rajendra took possession of the fort, and in April 1834, the British took control of it.
Built on an elevated area, the fort has been described as an "irregular hexagon" on plan, almost confirming to the shape of the hilltop. There are six circular bastions at the angles, the entrance on the east is intricate and circuitious and guarded by three successive gates.
Majestically looking over the area are two life-sized elephants made of mortar in the north-east corner of the entrance. A small but imposing church at the south-east corner was built in 1855 and is home to an archaeological museum (photography prohibited inside). The palace, renovated by Lingarajendra Wodeyar II in 1812-1814, accommodates government offices.
