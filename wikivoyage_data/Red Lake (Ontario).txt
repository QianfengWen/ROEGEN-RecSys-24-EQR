Red Lake is a town of 4,100 people (2016) in Northern Ontario. It is a regional transportation hub.


Understand[edit]

The name of the town comes from a local legend telling of two men from the Chippewa tribe who stumbled across a large moose. They then proceeded in killing the moose, the blood of which drained into a nearby lake. This turned the lake's waters red in colour, which gave the area its name.
The three primary sources of employment in Red Lake are support services for the numerous mines surrounding the town, small scale logging and a tourism sector specializing in hunting and fishing. It is known as the "Norseman Capital of the World", referring to the Noorduyn Norseman aircraft which played a significant role in the development of the area.
The town acts as a cargo, passenger and tourism hub for Northwestern Ontario. With Pickle Lake, Red Lake serves over twenty northern fly-in communities.

History[edit]
The First Nations (Indigenous) people are believed to have inhabited the Red Lake area for 2,000 years. The first people to live in the land were members of the Sioux and Cree tribes. Approximately 200–300 years ago the Ojibwe people began to inhabit the area, effectively becoming the predominant people at the time.
In 1897, the R.J. Gilbert expedition discovered gold and staked 8 claims. However, the remoteness of the site precluded further exploration until 1922, when the town experienced a sudden surge of economic, industrial, and population growth. By 1936, Red Lake's Howey Bay was the busiest airport in the world, with more flights landing and taking off per hour than any other.
In 1995 Goldcorp, owners of the Red Lake Mine, discovered that it contains the world's richest grade gold ore (two troy ounces of gold per metric ton). Shortly thereafter, the mine suffered through a four-year-long miners' strike. Since then, the mine has become one of the richest gold mines in the world.

Climate[edit]
Snow usually starts falling around late October or early November, and starts melting around March but is not normally fully melted until late April, whilst late-season snow in May is not rare. This long winter is ideal for the local snowmobilers and for ice fishing though during this period, although the wind is often very cold and temperatures may drop to below −35 °C or −31 °F. During winter, residents and visitors participate in snowmobiling, ice fishing, skiing, ice hockey, and downhill sliding.
During the summer, the area experiences a moderate climate with little humidity, which is ideal for camping, boating, canoeing, and hiking.
