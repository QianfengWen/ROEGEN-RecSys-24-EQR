Iseo is a town in Lombardy, in the northern part of Italy. It is not only the most known town by Lake Iseo, but it has many historical buildings such as the medieval Oldofredi Castle, the Parish Church and the first monument ever built to Giuseppe Garibaldi. Near the town centre there are also many vineyards where the well-known Franciacorta wine is produced.


Understand[edit]
Clusane
Iseo is on the southeast shore of Lake Iseo. It is bounded by the communes of Provaglio d'Iseo, Sulzano, Polaveno and Paratico.
It is between Franciacorta, famous for its sparkling wine, and Val Camonica, an alpine valley famous for the Rock Drawings, UNESCO world heritage site.
Iseo has three hamlets:

Clusane - between Iseo and Paratico. It is called The village of the roasted tench (in Italian: Paese della Tinca al Forno);
Pilzone
Cremignane
The best season to go to Iseo is the summer, with beautiful sunny and hot days. Christmas time is also pleasant, as that's the season when there is a big street market (called Natale con Gusto) that sells many local products. During January/February it rarely snows.

History[edit]
Iseo was already important in Roman times and in the Middle Ages; it became a flourishing trade centre. In the 19th century, the textile industry developed (you can see the spinning mill to the side of bar “Papillon” or in Via Campo). At the beginning of the 20th century, the railway was extended to Pisogne and Edolo, so Iseo lost its importance. In the 1960s, Iseo's economy became stronger thanks to tourism.
