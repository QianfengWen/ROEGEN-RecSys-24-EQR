Hartville is a village in Stark County in Northeast Ohio.


Understand[edit]
Hartville is known as a "dry" town, meaning no alcoholic beverages are served or sold in the village.  Very few shops are open on Sundays, and a few restaurants are closed too.  This is possibly due to the fairly large Mennonite population.
