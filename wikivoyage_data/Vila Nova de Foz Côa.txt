Vila Nova de Foz Côa (VEE-luh NAW-vuh d(ih) FAWSH KOH-uh, /vi.ɫɐ ˈnɔ.vɐ dɨ ˈfɔʃ ˈko.ɐ/)
The rock engravings were discovered in 1994. They are supported by vertical shale surfaces, with preferential exposure to the east. The dimensions of the engravings vary between 15 cm and 180 cm, although those 40–50 cm in length predominate. The engraving techniques used are perforation and abrasion, which sometimes coexist, with the abrasion regularizing the perforation. The strokes are wide, although they are sometimes accompanied by a large amount of fine strokes, which served as a sketch or complemented the previous ones. In other cases, these thin lines draw shapes that are difficult to perceive. There are also engravings filled with multiple strokes.
