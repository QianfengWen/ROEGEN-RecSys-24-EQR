A city in Lower Assam, Tezpur (Assamese: তেজপুৰ Tejpur, Hindi: तेजपुर Tejpur) is the largest city in the northern banks of the Brahmaputra River. It houses numerous sites of historical significance of the Ahom Kingdom and is also mentioned in several Hindu Puranic scriptures.


Understand[edit]
Tezpur (tehz-poor or tehj-poor - not to be confused with the similar-sounding Dispur) is the administrative headquarters of the Sonitpur district of Assam. The city's existence dates back to the Vedic period. It is a major tourist hotspot with a growing commercial market. It has numerous tea plantations and acts as a gateway to Arunachal Pradesh through Bhalukpong. 

History[edit]
Usha telling Chitralekha about Aniruddha whom she saw in her dream.
The name Tezpur means 'town of blood'. According to Hindu Puranic scriptures, the ruler of Sonitpur, Banasura had a daughter named Usha. Banasura locked her up in a fortress called Agnigarh as many young suitors had come to him asking for her hand. Once in a dream, Usha fell in love with Aniruddha, the grandson of Lord Krishna. Usha's friend Chitralekha who was an artist helped Usha portray Aniruddha. Chitralekha, through her supernatural powers, abducted Aniruddha from the palace of Krishna and brought him to Sonitpur. When Banasura came to know about this, he started a war with Lord Krishna which ended up in bloodshed. This justifies the name of the town. At the end of the war, Banasura was defeated by Lord Krishna. Lord Krishna forgave Banasura as he pleaded for his life. Lord Krishna then married his grandson Aniruddha to Bana's daughter Usha and the war ended on a happy note. The city has numerous ruins dating back to 9th and 10th centuries of the Gupta period. Antiquities found at the Da Parbatia are inferred to have been from a temple complex built during the 5th or 6th century, prior to the Bhaskaravarman period.
During World War II, the United States Army Air Forces Tenth Air Force used Tezpur Airport as a B-24 Liberator heavy bomber base for the 7th Bombardment Group.
During the Sino-Indian War in 1962, the People's Liberation Army of China penetrated close to the outskirts of the city. The local government ordered the evacuation of the civilians in Tezpur to the south of the Brahmaputra River, all prisoners were released, and government officials who stayed behind destroyed Tezpur's currency reserves in anticipation of a Chinese advance. Due to this, the Indian Armed Forces have a significant presence in the city till today.

Tickets can be booked online at ASTC's website or through the RedBus. Timetable is available in the RedBus website. There are air-conditioned buses as well as ordinary buses.

Get around[edit]
The Harihara war depicted on the Agnigarh Hill.
Getting around Tezpur can be quite hectic. There are e-rickshaws, public transportation like buses, and rental cars. E- Rickshaw operators can charge huge fares on seeing a tourist. Usually e-rickshaw rides are short and cost ₹10-20 per person (as of 2022). It is recommended to use e-rickshaws instead of public transport to go around in the city as public transport vehicles are packed with people, at least most of the times. Walkarounds are usually safe and can be done easily. Cycling is a good option but don't expect anything like Copenhagen.
Going to villages and nearby towns is surely a good idea but e-rickshaws and other private vehicles are a bit overpriced. Public transportation like bus or train is recommended.
