By plane[edit]
42.9278-71.43731 Manchester - Boston Regional Airport (MHT  IATA), Brown Av (Route 101 exit 2), ☏ +1 603 624-6556. A convenient way to get to the city and much of southern New Hampshire. Sometimes used as a low-cost, low hassle alternative to Logan International Airport in Boston. Airlines serving Manchester include American, Avelo, Southwest, Spirit and United. Southwest is the primary passenger air carrier for the airport, and now accounts for more than half of the airport's annual passenger traffic. There are non-stop flights to Manchester-Boston Regional Airport from the following cities (some cities may be seasonal or only offer service certain days of the week): Atlanta, Baltimore, Charlotte, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Detroit, Fort Lauderdale, Las Vegas, Minneapolis-St. Paul, New Orleans New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Tampa, and Washington. Delta has been increasing service to MHT including larger aircraft on the MHT-ATL route.Travelers at the airport will find it a convenient and easy to navigate facility. There are two security checkpoints, one on the second level in the center of the terminal, and one on the west end's ground floor, to the "right" of the airline ticket counters. Use the ground floor checkpoint if the center terminal one is busy; they both go to the same place, and the walk between the two is short.Smokers will find -- to their joy -- that there are two smoking rooms in the airport, one on the ground floor by the main baggage claim area, and one behind the security checkpoint. However, the future status of these rooms is uncertain, and they may soon be supplanted. One can smoke outdoors with no trouble.You can take the number 3 MTA bus from the airport to the city Monday through Friday. The buses run between 5:25 - 9:25AM and between 1:25PM and 7:25PM.

The "back" room will usually have sound and one of the main high-definition televisions turned to the Steelers game when the Steelers are playing, due to a large group of Steelers fans who gather there weekly.

Hotels[edit]
Most travelers will find themselves staying in two-diamond or three-diamond (AAA) properties, with rates generally in the $75 to $150 per night range. Some properties may be slightly cheaper, although one tends to get what one pays for. The majority of Manchester's hotel stock is in the two- to three-diamond range, although business travelers with expense accounts should consider the Bedford Village Inn, an excellent inn in suburban Bedford, N.H.
Travelers with business downtown might consider the Hilton Garden Inn, immediately adjacent to the city's baseball stadium (rooms overlook the park, and home runs occasionally bounce off the hotel), or the Radisson Hotel Manchester, a popular place to hold conferences and meetings. (The Radisson is co-located with the Center of New Hampshire convention center. )

Stay safe[edit]
Compared to American cities of its size, Manchester has an extremely low crime rate. Violent crime and property crime is rare, and even at night, visitors should feel safe in pretty much every area of the city.
Although crime in the city is very rare, one should not take leave of one's common sense either. The downtown area is largely safe at all hours, although there are areas of the center city and the West Side where traveling alone, on foot, at night might be inadvisable. Female visitors should take all customary precautions.
Manchester Police Department's main police station is at 405 Valley Street, ☏ +1 603-668-8711. 

Go next[edit]
Particularly in early fall, a trip to the White Mountains for foliage viewing is rewarding. Boston, Vermont and the Southern Maine Coast are only a short distance away,
A trip down State Route 101 heading west will bring you to many of the type of small towns that New Hampshire and New England are famous for, including Amherst, Milford, Wilton, and Peterborough. Past Wilton, the road becomes more windy and scenic, but is still a major east-west thoroughfare. The route ends in Keene about an hour away.
