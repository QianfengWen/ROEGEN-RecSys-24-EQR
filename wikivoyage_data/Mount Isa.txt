The roads into and out of Mount Isa are generally of good quality and passable for all vehicles. Care should be taken if travelling during the wet season as many of these roads can become flooded and impassable. Never try to cross covered causeways even if no signage or barricades are erected at the site. Purpose built signs are placed along the Barkly Highway to Townsville to indicate which roads are passable during flood times.
