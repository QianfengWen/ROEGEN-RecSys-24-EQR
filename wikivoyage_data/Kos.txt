The island of Kos is part of the Dodecanese. It is the third largest of this group of islands and the second most popular and touristy island after Rhodes. It is located between Kalymnos and Nysiros. It is very well organised and has everything in terms of tourism infrastructure.
The island is part of a chain of mountains from which it became separated after earthquakes and subsidence that occurred in ancient times. These mountains include Kalymnos and Kappari which are separated by an underwater chasm c. 70 m (40 fathoms deep), as well as the volcano of Nisyros and the surrounding islands.
There is a wide variety of rocks in Kos which is related to its geographical formation. Prominent among these are the Quaternary layers in which the fossil remains of mammals such as horses, hippopotami and elephants have been found. The fossilised molar of an elephant of gigantic proportions was presented to the Paleontology Museum of the University of Athens.
The shores of Kos Island are washed by the waters of the Aegean Sea. Its coastline is 112 km long and is caressed by long immaculate beaches, leading to its main industry being tourism. Farming is the principal occupation of many of the island's inhabitants, with their main crops being grapes, almonds, figs, olives, and tomatoes, along with wheat and corn. Cos lettuce may be grown here, but the name is unrelated.
The main villages of Kos island are Kos Town, Kardamena, Kefalos, Tingaki, Antimachia, Mastihari, Marmari and Pyli. Smaller ones are Zia, Zipari, Platani, Lagoudi and Asfendiou.

Hygeia (or Hygieia) gave to us the English word "hygiene" and her sister Panacea (meaning "a cure-all remedy") was considered in the Greek antiquity as a medical helper who was knowledgeable on healing via plants (phytotherapy). 
 Asclepieion (Asklepieion) (on the right side of the island), ☏ +30 22420 22131. An Asclepieion (plural "Asclepieia") was a therapeutic center built around a temple of Asclepius -- known as the ancient Greek god of medicine. This ancient healing center is an impressive archaeological site, one of the first ancient hospitals and medical schools in the world, built according to the principles created by the great physician Hippocrates (c. 460 BC - c. 370 BC) and later directed by his sons Thessalus and Polybus. Hippocrates, the "Father of Modern Western Medicine", was born on this island and (according to ancient sources) is believed to have thought medicine to his disciples here, first in a place called Astypalea of Kos (near the small town of Kefalos), and later in the Asklepieion. Hippocrates divided the art of medicine from the practices available in the ancient temples of Greece and established the first rules of scientific diagnosis and therapy. He is also the author of the Hippocratic Oath and is believed to have written some of the books included in the Hippocratic Corpus (a collection of ancient writings on medicine). A large museum and garden dedicated to Hippocrates can be visited at The International Hippocratic Foundation, between the Asclepieion and the town of Kos.
