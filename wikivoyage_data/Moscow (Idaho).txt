Moscow is a city in North Central Idaho with a population of around 22,000 people, an agricultural center and the home of the University of Idaho.  The surrounding area is generally referred to as the Moscow-Pullman area -- Pullman is a city in Washington, that is fairly symbiotic with Moscow.  They are 8 miles apart.


Understand[edit]
Unlike the larger Idaho cities of Boise and Pocatello, which also have public universities but also characters distinct from their respective schools, you won't confuse Moscow for being anything other than a hard-core college town. Founded in 1889, the University of Idaho is the single dominant institution in the city in just about every respect. The presence of Washington State University in similarly college culture-intensive Pullman less than 10 miles (16 km) away only adds to that feel.
Moscow is in the heart of a region known as the Palouse, noted for its rolling hills. Once outside the city and the university's sphere of influence, agriculture becomes the driving force in daily life.

Get in[edit]
Map of Moscow (Idaho)


By plane[edit]
The closest airport for commercial flights is the Moscow/Pullman Regional Airport PUW IATA, 5 mi (8.0 km) east along Hwy 8/Hwy 270. The next closest airports are the  Lewiston-Nez Perce County Regional Airport LWS IATA located 33 mi (53 km) south in Lewiston and Spokane International Airport' GEG IATA, 90 mi (140 km) north. Spokane International Airport is the major airport in the region served by several airlines including Southwest Airlines which means cheaper and more competitive fares than to Lewiston or Moscow/Pullman Regional Airports.  The Wheatland Express Airport Shuttle connects Spokane Airport to Colfax, Pullman and Moscow. Horizon/Alaska Air serve all three airports from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport where you can sometimes find comparable rates to fly into the smaller airports and avoid the 1½-hour drive from Spokane.

By car[edit]
US-95 and Highway 8 both cross through Moscow.

A special service is also deployed during the holiday seasons and university breaks. Journeys take 6 hours to Seattle. 
Get around[edit]
Bus travel has grown to be a lot better.  Bus services are run by the Wheatland Express with many stops on and off campus, which also features a shuttle between Moscow and Pullman.  Cars are not required to get around Moscow, the town is fairly small and if you're willing to bike or walk, you can get almost anything done here.  If you do need a car,  there are car rental services available at the airport,  Budget (+1 509-332-3511) and Hertz (+1 509-332-4485), and in town (Ambassador Auto, +1-800-422-0297). Enterprise Car Rental (+1 208-746-2878) is available if you fly into Lewiston.
There is a bike trail between Moscow and Pullman.  Bicycles are a common mode of travel in summer, but not in winter, due to the colder, wet weather. In the summer, it is very common for residents to bike-commute back and forth to work between Moscow and Pullman.   There is also a bike trail between Moscow and Troy, to the east.
There are, at any given time, two to three taxi services in Moscow.  There is significant turnover as they go out of business.

See[edit]
Moscow is a pleasant town where a great deal of the population is made up of full-time or half-time students rather than full-time or half-time workers. Thus most of the businesses in the area are adapted to cater to the students, or other visitors. It has a few points of interest.

Do[edit]
Moscow is fairly well located for outdoor activities.

Hiking - There are various national forests within easy driving distance; including places like the Hoodoo mountains and Saint Joe National Forest.

There is also usually live music performed in the square. The exact selection varies.
