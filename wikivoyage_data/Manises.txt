Manises is a small city of 31.000 people (2018) in Valencia (province). It is the site of Valencia's airport, and is an important centre for ceramics, which has been practised for at least 700 years.


Understand[edit]
This former ceramics factory houses the Tourist Information Office
Although there is evidence of occupation since the Roman period, Manises as a town was established by the Arabs, who developed it into a centre for the production of ceramics. In 1237 the town was conquered by King Jaime of Aragon, who permitted the Muslim residents to remain and to train Christian newcomers in the craft. By the Middle Ages ceramics from Manises became highly prized in royal courts throughout Europe, especially those with the distinctive blue and gold style first developed by Moorish craftsmen.
Unlike other nearby towns where the tradition of pottery died out, Manises today is still well-known for its ceramics. It is today Spain's largest production centre, with more than 100 workshops and factories located in the city and another fifty in neighbouring towns.
