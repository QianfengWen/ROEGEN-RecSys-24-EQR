Open pit iron mine in Wabush (Labrador), on the North of Knoll Lake
Wabush is a town in western Labrador, close to the Quebec border, in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. It is known for its gold mining industry and its regional airport.
Wabush and Labrador City are a pair of towns forming Labrador-West. Dedicated primarily to iron ore mining, their burgeoning population of 9,350 people makes them the largest metropolitan area in otherwise sparsely-populated Labrador, rivalled only by Happy Valley-Goose Bay (with 7,750 people). The bulk of this population is in Labrador City, with Wabush (established 1955) as a de facto suburb of 1,860.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Route 500 at Labrador City
Labrador City and Wabush are just across the Québec-Labrador border on the Trans-Labrador Highway; this border is 25 km from Fermont, Quebec. From the intersection of route 138 in Baie-Comeau, take Quebec Route 389 (northbound) on 582 km up to the Labrador border (route 510 in Labrador City), with only one intermediate point (Relais Gabriel) to stop for fuel or lodging. Quebec 389 is a gravel road from the Manic 5 hydroelectric dam to Fermont (RCM of Caniapiscau). The road improves on becoming Route 500 in Labrador, continuing as asphalt through Goose Bay, Port Hope Simpson and Red Bay to Forteau.
From the Québec-Labrador limit, the distance to be traveled on Route 500 is 243 km to Churchill Falls, which has a gas station, hotel and some services, and another 288 km beyond there to Happy Valley-Goose Bay, which is the next city with a hospital.
