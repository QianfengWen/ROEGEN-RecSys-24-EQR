Rakiraki is on the north coast of Viti Levu, on a beautiful strip of land known as the Suncoast.


Understand[edit]
Rakiraki is roughly halfway between Nadi and Suva when driving along the north coast via Kings Road. "Rakiraki" refers to the district and the main town of the district is actually Vaileka. However, it has become commonplace to call the town Rakiraki too.
Rakiraki was declared as a township in 2010, though many in Fiji felt this was long overdue.

See[edit]
-17.37389178.141671 Tomb of Udre Udre. Chief Udre Udre is infamously known as the world's most prolific cannibal. During his life, it is estimated that he ate between 872 and 999 human bodies and in doing so, holds the Guinness World Record. The tomb is hard to find and not well maintained. It is best to go with a driver who knows the stories and history surrounding the legendary chief. (updated May 2017)
-17.3719178.112 Navatu Rock, Vitawa village. The rock stands out proudly and can be easily seen when driving along Kings Road.
