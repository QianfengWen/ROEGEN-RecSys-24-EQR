Gig Harbor is a town on the Kitsap Peninsula in the Puget Sound region of Washington state.
Gig Harbor, the southern gateway to the Kitsap Peninsula and the Olympic Peninsula, lies just across the dramatic Tacoma Narrows Bridge from Tacoma. This tucked-away town sits on a scenic inlet framing a postcard-perfect view of Mount Rainier. Gig Harbor's strong Scandinavian and Croatian heritage has always influenced its nautical lifestyle and fishing-village character. Today specialty shops, creative boutiques, art galleries and waterfront restaurants add to its appeal and make it a wonderful get-away.

The smoke-free, 21 & over (it's a bar in the Washington State Liquor Control Board's eyes) environment is set on pilings over the harbor and is the perfect spot to enjoy a glass of wine or beer, a tasty meal from an extensive menu. Perfect for kicking back, while looking the Sound wildlife, boat traffic, and locals coming in and out of The Tides. 
 Anthony's Restaurant. Part of a chain of Northwest-centric restaurants in the Puget Sound area and Gig Harbor's is one of the jewels in the chain's crown. Fairly upscale seafood fare shares the menu with traditional beef, chicken, and salad items. The restaurant's location is fantastic. at the head of the harbor with a drop-dead gorgeous view of the marinas, the homes clinging to the sides of the hill, and Mount Rainier. A bar downstairs features happy hour 1/2 price appetizer options and the same spectacular view. 
 Dexter's Drive-In, 6701 Tyee Dr NW, ☏ +1 253 851-4552. Classic hamburger and fries type drive-in. 
 Brix 25°. A fairly new dining establishment in the Harbor, but has quickly become one of the favorites.

The fare is primarily continental with a Northwest twist. Expect halibut, salmon, some shellfish, along with a filet mignon, or a duck breast on the menu most nights. Their wine selection is impressive and has won several awards, including the 2008 Washington Wine Restaurant of the Year.
