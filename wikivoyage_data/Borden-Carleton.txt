Understand[edit]
Pier in Borden-Carleton
Borden-Carleton is on the south shore of Prince Edward Island fronting on the Northumberland Straight and was formed in 1995 through the amalgamation of the town of Borden and the community of Carleton. It was a train and car ferry port until the Confederation Bridge was completed to the mainland in 1997. The province later constructed Gateway Village, a tourist rest area, information, and shopping complex on the grounds of the former rail yard.

Get in[edit]
The monumental Confederation Bridge, almost a visitor attraction in itself (viewing stations on the New Brunswick side offer good photo opportunities), crosses the Northumberland Strait between New Brunswick and PEI. It's reached from the mainland on Route 16, near Aulac, and stretches 13 km (8 mi) across open water to the island. 
The toll of $50.25 toll for a car, $20.00 for a motorcycle (2022 rates, 2-axle vehicle, $8.50 for each additional axle), is collected on the PEI side when returning to the mainland. Travel across the Bridge as a pedestrian or cyclist is possible via the passenger shuttle service which travels between Borden-Carlton, PEI, and Cape Jourimain, NB. The price for the shuttle is $4.75 for pedestrians and $9.50 for cyclists (this price includes the bicycle as luggage). The first article of luggage is free and every additional piece of luggage is $4.25 (not including luggage attached to a touring bicycle). 
There is no stopping allowed on the bridge and is open 24/7 year round, with the exception of severe wind conditions which may close the bridge for an indeterminate amount of time.
Route 16 in New Brunswick becomes Highway 1 on Prince Edward Island, and continues to Charlottetown.  Route 16 and Highway 1 are part of the Trans-Canada Highway.
