Kretinga is a city in Samogitia in the west of Lithuania, with a population of 17,249 in 2021. It's one of the oldest cities in the country, but repeatedly wrecked, so what you see now is mostly modern. 


Understand[edit]
The name of the town may drive from "kret-", shaking or boggy ground, but there are several other explanations and only one man ever knew its origin for sure. In 1609 Žemaitija Jonas Karolis Chodkevičius named the place Karolstadt after himself, but no-one else called it that, so Kretinga (in various spellings) it remained. It gradually industrialised, between the horrors of war and Nazi and Soviet occupations, based mostly on agriculture such as knitware and woodwork. A large employer today is local government, as the Klaipėda County admin is based here not in Klaipėda city. 
Tourist Information Centre is just south of the monastery church at Vilniaus g 2B, open M-Th 08:00-17:00, F 08:00-16:00.

The Bernadine monastery and Church of the Annunciation were founded in 1605, twice wrecked by the Swedes but repaired. The church was rebuilt and enlarged from 1907, and the monastery took in monks driven out of other parts of the Tsarist realm. In 1940 / 41 the Soviets closed the monastery and confiscated its property, the church burned down, and (just in case he hadn't taken the hint) the pastor was sent to Siberia. The church was rebuilt in 1950 and the monastery revived by the Franciscans in 1989. The building is Gothic / Renaissance, with striking wooden doors and altar.  (updated Jan 2024)
