Understand[edit]

Uranium City began in 1952 when the provincial government decided to establish a community to service the mines in the Beaverlodge uranium area developed by Eldorado Mining and Refining, which was owned by the Government of Canada.  By 1954, 52 mines were operating and 12 open-pit mines were next to Beaverlodge Lake. Most of the residences in Uranium City at this time were tents.
Uranium City was modelled after the community of Arvida, Quebec.
The population of Uranium City started to grow significantly in 1960 when Eldorado Resources began to house staff in Uranium City instead of the Eldorado campsite.

Uranium City was a thriving community until 1982, with its population approaching 5,000. The closure of the mines on 30 June 1982 led to economic collapse, and most residents of the community left. The local hospital closed in the spring of 2003. The population in 2016 was 73, including a number of Métis and First Nations people.
