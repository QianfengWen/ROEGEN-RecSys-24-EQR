Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
Kolding does not have a very big train station (3 platforms), but trains between Aarhus and Copenhagen normally stop in Kolding. If not, the 2nd-largest train station of the country in Fredericia has a train departing for Kolding every 10 or 20 minutes.

By car[edit]
When following the E45 motorway (mid-Juttish motorway), follow motorway exit 62, which should take you directly in to the city at ease.

By plane[edit]
The nearest big commercial airport near Kolding is Billund (2nd-largest of Denmark). From Billund, either take the train or a bus to Kolding (both easily found. If you can't find one, take a bus to Fredericia and then take the train to Kolding (the personnel will happily help you on your way).

By bus[edit]
Due to the Bosnian war in the 1990s there are several bus companies, mainly serving the Bosnian diaspora, which provide a cheap and clean way of getting to the other side of the European continent.

 [dead link] Toptourist, ☏ +45 48 25 38 37, info@toptourist.dk. Various destinations in Bosnia and Hercegovina. Off-season approx €140 for a return ticket. 
Get around[edit]
Kolding city center isn't very big, so getting around in the city centre is quite easy. If you wish to go to more remote locations, e.g. the botanical garden of Geografisk Have, buses run by Sydtrafik[dead link] are cheap and drive all over town. It should also be possible to get a taxi cheaply (by Danish standards. Taxi-driving is mostly very expensive in Denmark.)
As Kolding city center is not very big, you should somewhat easily be able to get around by foot.
