A small, rather underwhelming museum containing exhibits of Bega's cheese and dairy history, mostly in the form of rustic equipment with informative labels like "Baltic Separator".  There is a cafe and a cheese tasting area where you can try a range of cheeses that Bega offers. Unfortunately there are no factory tours showing how the cheese is made.

A country hostel made of mud-bricks and with a casual air. Traffic noise from the highway might annoy light sleepers a little, so rooms on the south side are preferable.
