Ipswich is the county town of Suffolk. The Ipswich Waterfront was once known as the largest and most important dock in the kingdom. Mostly recognised for its football club, it has had new developments such as the Waterfront entertainment district, the University Campus Suffolk and new shopping developments.


Understand[edit]
Ipswich was one of the most prosperous cities in the UK since Saxon times. During its heyday it was a major trading port, being on the estuary of the Orwell River on the East Coast. Ipswich fell into rapid decline after the opening of the new ports at Felixstowe and Harwich and stayed that way until the 1970s when much of London's financial services industry used Ipswich as a hub for their secondary offices with names such as Royal Bank of Scotland, Willis Group (aka Willis Faber & Dumas), Norwich Union and AXA opening shiny new skyscrapers in a new CBD development just north of the river. The new University Campus Suffolk brought on rapid development along the waterfront area with lots of trendy new bars, restaurants and apartments lining the east bank of the river.
Anyone expecting a typical, small provincial town will get a little culture shock when stepping out of the train station as 1960s tower blocks, Saxon half-timber cottages, Victorian townhouses and shiny new high-rise developments sit side-by-side. In 2019, it was home to 133,000 people.

Get in[edit]
Ipswich
By air[edit]
Ipswich has good connections to both London Stansted (STN IATA) and Norwich International (NWI IATA) airports.
From Stansted, there is an express bus service (X5) which runs between Ipswich Old Cattle Market Bus Station and Stansted Airport Coach Station every 2 hours, 24 hours a day; taking about 90 minutes. Expect to pay around £75 for a prebooked minicab and over £100 for a metered taxi.
Norwich Airport can be reached in 1-1½ hours. From the airport, take a local bus or a taxi to Norwich Railway Station and from there it's about 40 minutes by train to Ipswich. A taxi will be £50-60.

By train[edit]
Ipswich Railway Station
52.0505641.1449381 Ipswich station is on the West Bank of the Orwell River on the intersection between Princes St, Burrell Rd and Ranelagh Rd, about 1 mile from the town centre. Trains to Norwich (calling at Stowmarket and Diss) depart from Platform 3 at 8 and 44 minutes past the hour. The journey takes about 45 minutes. Express trains to London Liverpool St (calling at Manningtree and Colchester) depart from Platform 2 at 9 and 43 minutes past the hour. A third, slower train to London (calling most stations) departs from Platform 4 at 53 minutes past the hour. Express services take about 1 hour and 10 minutes to reach the capital, whereas the stopping train takes about ten minutes longer. There are also hourly services to Cambridge, Felixstowe and Lowestoft, and bi-hourly services to Peterborough.
There is also a smaller station called 52.0511.1832 Derby Road (Ipswich), on Derby Rd in the eastern suburb of Rose Hill. It is unstaffed and has an hourly service between Ipswich and Felixstowe. It's not recommended to take a train from here at night as there are no staff and very little lighting or CCTV.

By bus and coach[edit]
Old Cattle Market bus station on Falcon Street serves all regional and long-distance bus services. Frequent regional buses run to Stowmarket, Sudbury, Woodbridge, Felixstowe, Colchester, Framlingham etc., while National Express services run to London (3 times per day), Liverpool (1 per day), and Stansted Airport (every 2 hours). Rural bus and minibus services run to surrounding villages, although some are very infrequent. There is no ticket office at the station, so tickets should be bought on board (change is usually available but drivers will be reluctant to change large bills), except for National Express services, which must be prebooked by phone or over the internet. Electronic signboards display the next 20 or so departures and which stand they will depart from. Schedules are displayed at each departure gate.

By car[edit]
Ipswich is at the intersections of the A12 (London - Great Yarmouth) and A14 (Felixstowe - Birmingham) highways with several exits along both routes. Driving into the city can be slow as traffic congestion is heavy. Also, a very confusing one-way system runs around the edge of the city centre, feeding drivers into the rabbit-warren of small streets. Maps and sat-navs are a bit useless once you're past the inner ring-road so allow plenty of time. Parking is very limited and expensive (in an underground or multi-storey city centre car park expect to pay about £9 for 3 hours) although some parking areas close to the inner ring-road will charge around £2.50 for one day, although they are not as secure. Alternatively, Park & Ride bus services run from 3 parking sites on the edge of the city close to the A14, costing £2.80 per day including free bus travel to the city centre. Look out for the blue Park & Ride signs (displaying a letter 'P' alongside a bus) when approaching Ipswich on the highway.

Get around[edit]

By bus[edit]
Local urban bus services are provided by Ipswich Buses and First Eastern Counties and radiate from the Tower Ramparts Bus Station. The green and purple Ipswich buses cover most urban routes and link to surrounding suburbs and retail parks. Most services run every 10–20 minutes during the day time and every 30–60 minutes in the early morning and late evening - most services start around 5:30AM and finish around 11PM. There's a flat fare of £1.80 which is paid into the farebox next to the driver - if you don't have exact change you'll be issued with a voucher that can be used as part-payment on your next journey or can be refunded at the Ipswich Buses customer service office at Tower Ramparts bus station. Day passes, weekly and monthly tickets are available, as well as a rechargeable smart-card for regular travellers. First Eastern Counties services are less frequent except for #66 which runs every 15 minutes between Bourne Bridge and Martlesham and runs 24 hours a day. Fares on First buses are charged by distance and return tickets are available - change is also given but drivers are reluctant to change anything bigger than a £5 note. Tickets are not interchangeable between operators.
A useful service for tourists is the #38 which loops the town centre and is free of charge - useful for getting to know your way around. An open-top sightseeing bus runs a circuit of nearby tourist attractions during the summer months.

By car[edit]
Driving around Ipswich is not recommended - traffic is often heavy, the rabbit-warren of one-way streets is confusing and parking can be expensive. However, a car is more useful if you're staying in the suburbs or plan on travelling to some more remote attractions away from the town.

By taxi[edit]
Taxis in Ipswich are cheap by British standards. Metered taxis can be found at taxi-stands outside the train station, the Old Cattle Market bus station and on a side-street beside Debenhams just off Crown Street; hailing a taxi in the street is not recommended as most taxi drivers will wait in a taxi rank rather than cruise for passengers. Phone-booked minicabs are cheaper and will take you to more inaccessible locations, but can be hard to book late on Friday and Saturday nights. If you want to travel by taxi to a nearby town such as Felixstowe or Stowmarket, local minicabs in those towns will usually be cheaper than those in Ipswich.

On Foot[edit]
Ipswich town centre is very compact and much of the town-centre is pedestrianised, so walking is often the fastest and most pleasant way of getting around. However, walking at night is not so fun: walking beyond the town centre usually involves passing some unpleasant areas and walking through the public underpasses that cross the 'inner ring' or along by the river can sometimes be unsafe. Take a taxi instead.

By bicycle[edit]
Ipswich Borough Council has gone to great lengths to make the town more cycle-friendly, and most major routes into the town centre have cycle or bus lanes, although they are often ignored by motorists, many of whom are not happy with sharing the road with cyclists, so it helps to have a good level of confidence in urban cycling. Alternatively, there are several signposted cycle routes taking in quiet residential streets, traffic free trails through the towns many parks and contraflow cycle lanes that allow cyclists to travel in both directions on a one way street. National Cycle Network routes 1 and 51 pass though Ipswich, and the borough council produces a free cycle map.

See[edit]
Ipswich sits in a beautiful area of East Anglia - "Constable Country". In fact, the setting of Constable's most famous painting, "The Haywain", is only a few miles down the A12 road (heading towards London) in nearby Flatford. Click here to see how the site looks today. There is a National Trust centre in Flatford that is worth a visit, if only for the good home-made cakes on sale.
Further out of Ipswich, Orford Castle (12 miles outside Woodbridge, on the B1084) is worth a visit in good weather. The castle is over 800 years old, in good condition for a building of that age. Orford is an attractive village, with good fish and chips available from pubs and restaurants at the far end of the village.

Buy[edit]
Ipswich was nothing special when it came to shopping - however several independent stores have opened, Urban Vintage is the best choice for men on Queen Street, and Blacksheep near the buttermarket, further along on St. Nicholas Street and St. Peters Street there are several choices for women in Aura, Marianna and Caramel. Other independent stores for men include Jonty's(Tacket Street) and the department store Coes on Norwich Road.
A long pedestrianized street (Northgate Street, Tavern Street, Carr Street) runs right across the town centre and is lined with big-name stores such as H and M, Gap, Debenhams, Boots, and Marks & Spencer. A few smaller pedestrian streets house some smaller retailers and is the best place to find small, independent retailers. There are 2 main indoor shopping malls (Buttermarket Centre and Sailmakers Shopping Centre( formerly Tower Ramparts)) although neither are anything special, this is where you can find Topshop, Topman and TK Maxx.
The south-eastern part of Norwich Road is a good place to see Ipswich's vibrant ethnic community and the street is lined with shops and restaurants selling food, snacks and local products from the Middle East, Eastern Europe, India and elsewhere.
Many locals now prefer shopping in out-of-town retail parks and superstores. Copdock Interchange retail park close to the intersection between the A12 and A14 highways in the southwest of Ipswich is one of the largest with a 24-hour Tesco Extra superstore, Currys PC World (electronics and appliances), B&M (variety goods value retailer) and several fast-food chains including Burger King, Costa Coffee and Pizza Hut (take Bus 13 from Tower Ramparts and get off at the last stop - by car it's close to the A12/A14 Copdock Interchange and at the end of the A1214 London Road from Ipswich town centre - free parking). Anglia Retail Park in the northwest of Ipswich close to the A14 highway is also popular and has an Asda superstore, Bounce Ipswich (trampoline centre), Go-Outdoors (outdoor supplier) and the usual furniture and appliance stores, plus a McDonalds, Costa Coffee and a KFC (Bus 8 from Tower Ramparts - get off at the last stop - by car it's close to the Ipswich/Bury Road exit of the A14, at the top end of Norwich Road from the town centre).
The main supermarket serving the town centre is Sainsbury on Upper Brook Street. There is a larger Sainsbury on Hadleigh Road close to the train station. Most other supermarkets are out of town in large retail parks; the two largest are listed above. Convenience stores such as Martins, Co-op, Spar, Tesco Express and Premier can be found everywhere; most are open from 6AM-11PM, although many petrol station convenience stores are 24-hour.

Eat[edit]
St Nicholas Street in Ipswich has several restaurants. You can eat Turkish, Italian, French, Thai, Chinese, Indian and modern British cuisine.

Stay safe[edit]
Despite the sensationalized news reports about the Suffolk Murders and the nightclub shootings in Ipswich, crime is no more rampant here than in any other similar-sized town. Avoid getting into confrontations, particularly in bars, as things get a bit nasty. There are several no-go areas at night - most notably Chantry, Gainsborough and Greenwich, as well as the residential areas around Norwich Road, although the average tourist will find no need to go to these areas, and if you stick to the main arterial roads you'll be safe. Be careful of parking your car in quiet residential streets at night, or leaving your car in a privately run 'budget car park' such as the one at the waterfront, as car break-ins and car-thefts are common. Use a town-centre car park operated by Ipswich Borough Council or NCP instead.
There's a strong rivalry between Ipswich Town FC and Norwich City FC - on match days avoid wearing football colours or saying things that may provoke a football-related confrontation. That said, football hooliganism is rare.

As of Sep 2022, Ipswich has 5G with EE and O2, and 4G with Three and Vodafone.

Dedham — 20 minutes drive
Woodbridge - less than ten miles out of Ipswich is this attractive market town (on the A12, heading out towards Lowestoft). Woodbridge was once a major port, in Tudor times, and the town is still popular today amongst sailors, with a high population of retired City types who have settled in this part of the world to "mess around on boats". You can also reach Woodbridge via train from Ipswich, although the service is far from frequent. Woodbridge has many antique shops, tea shops, and old pubs, and is mainly pedestrianised. Worth a visit, especially if you are, or are travelling with, someone elderly. On the outskirts is a mill (clearly signposted from the A12), the only survivor of the 10 or more which used to feed the soldiers barracked in the area during the Napoleonic wars. Places to eat: "Spice" on the main street "the Thoroughfare" or the Captains Table. To drink: the Kings Head on the town square.
Sutton Hoo — just outside of Woodbridge. An Anglo Saxon burial ground of royal princes, buried alongside priceless treasures in ship graves. There is a National Trust exhibition centre]. In all honesty, although the site is doubtless of great historical interest, the exhibition itself is somewhat thinly stretched. (If you want to see any of the treasures found here, you'll have to go to the British Museum in London.) Worth going to if you are in the area, anyone travelling some distance to the site could be disappointed.
Newbourne — off the A12
Waldringfield — on the way to Woodbridge. Has an attractive view over the River Deben.
Rendlesham Forest — site of the most notorious UFO incident in the UK, but also good for cycling round, with bikes available to hire in the Easter and summer school holiday periods.
Levington — between Ipswich and Felixstowe, it sits on a river estuary, and features preserved wetlands which house many migratory birds. The pub there ("The Ship") does wonderful food: the liver and bacon and any of the seafood especially recommended. No bookings are taken. Their wine is pretty poor though. Have a quick walk before or after visiting the pub down to the river; the  footpath just opposite the pub, which is the only place to park in the village.
