Plaza Juarez, Actopan's town square
Actopan is a small city in Central Mexico in the Mezquital Valley in the state of Hidalgo. It is 35 km from the state capital of Pachuca and 125 km from Mexico City. It is a lively city with several festivals, known for its colonial heritage and for its tasty local cuisine, especially variations of barbacoa.


Understand[edit]
Actopan has a population of about 30,000 (2020). The city lies within the Trans-Mexican Volcano Belt and occasionally experiences earthquakes and tremors.
The area was first settled by the Otomi indigenous people. It was conquered by the Chichimeca in 1117, by the Tepanecs in the 14th century, by the Mexicas/Aztecs in 1427, and by the Spanish in 1546. 
The first orders of business for the Spanish were to build an aqueduct and a church (some of the oldest structures in town). The first major church to be built was San Nicolás de Tolentino, an Augustinian monastery, which was constructed between 1550 and 1570. During the 17th and 18th centuries many local indigenous people were taken to other towns in Hidalgo as forced labor for mines (the ugly side of Mexico's "proud silver mining tradition"). 
The 1910s was a period of revolution in Mexico and several actions took place in and near Actopan. Since then, the town has continued to grow slowly as a peaceful and somewhat prosperous community.
The climate is temperate and semi-dry. The coolest and driest months are December-February while summer is the wettest season of the year with May being the warmest month.

Frescoes in the convent of San Nicolas Tolentino
Indigenous murals in the open chapel
20.268546-98.9430281 Parroquia San Nicolas Tolentino, Lerdo de Tejada, Centro, ☏ +52 7727283580. Actopan's oldest church was established as an Augustinian monastery, built between 1550-1570. The church has some remarkable 16th century religious artwork inside but is most noted for a unique outdoor chapel decorated with murals painted by indigenous artists in the 1550s. These murals have degraded significantly in the intervening centuries but are remarkable in the way they fuse indigenous Mexica elements with the newly enforced Christian themes being proselytized by the Spanish. The convent too has some remarkable artwork done by European artists featuring elaborate patterns and interpreting biblical passages in more Euro-centric ways.
