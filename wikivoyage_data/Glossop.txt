Old Glossop
Glossop is a town of 33,000 people (2014) on the edge of the Peak District. It lies in the county of Derbyshire, which is part of the East Midlands (though most residents would consider themselves part of the Northwest of England).


Understand[edit]
Glossop is at the northwestern extremity of Derbyshire and the Peak District, close to the borders with Greater Manchester and Yorkshire. It also lies at the start of two of the most infamous Pennine passes, the Snake and Woodhead passes. Its main development is owed to the 19th-century cotton industry which generated the wealth to build much of the town we see today, although the cotton industry has since declined and almost disappeared from the region. Despite this, the historic mill buildings still dominate the town, such as those at Wren Nest and Howardtown, both of which are undergoing major transformations into new multi-use buildings including retail, leisure and residential.
Glossop is predominantly a commuter town for the nearby conurbation of Greater Manchester, where quite often people have moved to enjoy a more relaxed and laid-back quality of life whilst enjoying the benefits of living near a city. It has a regular market, the usual range of high street chain stores and some independent shops. It attracts tourists mainly due to its good transport links with the surrounding Peak District National Park and its stunning countryside, though the town is not without interest and parts (e.g. Manor Park, Old Glossop) are quite attractive. It is not of any administrative significance due to its geographic location and local government structures.

By car[edit]
Snake Pass
Glossop has connections in all directions to the UK road network; however, the main road (though not a primary route) is the A57. To the West this joins with the A628 Woodhead pass at Hollingworth, to become a primary route and then it is a short distance until it meets the UK motorway network via the M67 to allow quick and easy access into Greater Manchester. To the East is the A57 Snake Pass, an infamous transpennine pass to Sheffield. To the south the main road is the A624 which goes to Hayfield, Chapel-en-le-Frith and eventually Buxton via the A6; this is the main route into Derbyshire and towards the towns and cities of the East Midlands. To the North is the B6105 which links to the A628 Woodhead Pass at Crowden: the A628 is the easiest route to access the M1 from Glossop via Junction 37 at Barnsley. The A628, however, goes through Barnsley and to Pontefract in West Yorkshire.
