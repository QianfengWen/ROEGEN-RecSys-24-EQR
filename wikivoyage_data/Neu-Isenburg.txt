Neu-Isenburg[dead link] is a city in Hesse that borders directly in the north to Frankfurt. The city is regionally known for its proximity to the Frankfurt airport, its shopping mall and some nicer garden restaurants.


Understand[edit]
Neu-Isenburg has almost 36,400 inhabitants and was a sleepy town until the industry took advantage of the good location and the proximity to the airport. Nowadays it is a very multicultural city with many people that live only temporarily in town. It still has a nice old town centre, but the city is spread out. After the business hours it is calm, except for the noise caused by the planes taking off and landing at Frankfurt airport.

Get in[edit]
Map of Neu-Isenburg
Neu-Isenburg is very well connected and has entries/exits to the Autobahns A3, A5 and A661 plus the federal street B43 (shortcut to the airport). In the morning and evening rush hour most Autobahns are congested so plan additional time if you travel to Frankfurt or to the trade fair. There is a direct bus to/from the airport (Bus 651 from Airport Terminal 1) that leaves twice per hour and the railway is well connected to the Frankfurt and Darmstadt main stations. There are trains to Wiesbaden and Offenbach, but you have to change trains in Frankfurt main station.

Get around[edit]
Neu-Isenburg is part of the RMV and therefore connected to the public transport system of the greater Frankfurt area and most of south and east Hesse. Within the center you can easily walk, or taxis are available in front of the Hugenottenhalle and the railway station. Keep in mind that the public transport almost stops early in the evening, so if you intend to go around after 20:00, check the schedules or have a bike. Trains to Frankfurt an Darmstadt generally are available until midnight.
