Newtown (Welsh:Y Drenewydd) is in Mid Wales. 


Understand[edit]
A former hub of the textile industry, it lies on the River Severn (Welsh: Afon Hafren) and is now home to high tech industries. It retains a traditional town centre of independent shops and many pubs and cafes. There's also an art gallery, nightclub and indoor market. The name of the town is deceptive as it has been in existence since the 13th century, when a market was established here.

Get in[edit]
Newtown is well connected by bus and train. Buses run to destinations including Llandrindod and Llanidloes in Wales, and Shrewsbury in England. Trains run on the Cambrian line. To the west there are services to Machynlleth and Aberystwyth and on the Cambrian Coast line through Tywyn and Barmouth to Pwllheli.
