Coolongolook is a highway town along the Pacific Highway in the Mid-North Coast region of New South Wales. Unlike many other towns along the Pacific that have been bypassed by four- to six-lane freeways, the Pacific runs right through the middle of town.


Understand[edit]
Coolongolook is only a tiny town of 382, but in many retrospects, it can feel like a township or a village, and many be considered a village by many (the latter term is not used in Australia). There isn't a whole lot of history behind this town, except that gold was mined in this area during the 19th century.
During the late 1990s when planning for the Pacific Highway upgrade began, most towns were bypassed. However, the NSW Government decided in 2001 not to bypass Coolongolook – it wasn't cost-effective at the time, and probably still isn't today.
Although traffic volumes have greatly increased today, there are no plans for Coolongolook to be bypassed, and it's unlikely there ever will be as bypassing Coolongolook will result in its demise (on top of a ghost four-lane highway through town). The town solely exists due to its highway amenities, and although you'll have to slow down to 80 km/h (50 mph), you don't need to exit to have some coffee.

Get in[edit]
The ideal way to get into Coolongolook is by using the Pacific Highway from either end. 
The 154 bus route also makes a stop in Coolongolook from both directions. However, given there's virtually nothing to see or do in Coolongolook, there's little reason why you as a traveller will need to use this line.

Get around[edit]

Either by car or on foot. You probably won't need to get around, though.
One important thing to note is the Pacific Highway's local name is called Bengal Street. On most GPS systems, most of Coolongolook's addresses will use Bengal Street as its address, not Pacific Highway. However, for the purposes of this guide, places with a known address and street number will use Bengal Street, but places that have unknown street numbers will use Pacific Highway.

See and do[edit]
There is nothing to see or do in Coolongolook. The reason why travellers visit this town is for the eateries along the way.
