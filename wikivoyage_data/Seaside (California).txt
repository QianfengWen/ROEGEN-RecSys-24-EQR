Seaside is a city in Monterey County in the Central Coast region of California.  It is on the coast of the Monterey Bay, just north of the city of Monterey. Formerly the site of the Fort Ord military base, Seaside now has a PGA Tour-hosting golf course and the California State University of Monterey Bay. It is a good home base from which to see all the towns on Monterey Bay.
Sand City, a three-square-mile town with a population of around 300, is surrounded by Seaside on three sides. A former sand manufacturing area, it has become an artist's colony, and its industrial buildings now house an array of galleries.
