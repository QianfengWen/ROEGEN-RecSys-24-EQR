Mars is a town in Pennsylvania. Yes, you read that right. It is one of the most quirky places you can find in Pennsylvania. The main reason to visit us to enjoy the signage that makes use of the town's name, and to see the flying saucer, if it's there.


Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The Pittsburgh Butler Regional Airport terminal building.
While not having any airports in its own right, there are multiple airports nearby the small town. For example, Pittsburgh International Airport is a nearby airport you can take to get in the small town. There is also the Pittsburgh-Butler Regional Airport, which is a viable place to land if you can, being non-commercial and all. The pro to this airport is that it is closer, however it is a private and business airport. This makes it hard to use as a normal person. This means, despite being farther, PIT is probably your best bet to get in the general North Pittsburgh Region area as it is a more accessible, commercial airport.

By car[edit]
There are multiple ways to get in the small town of Mars by car. It is easy to get in from Pittsburgh, as it is easily serviced by the multiple highways. From Pittsburgh, get onto I-279 and travel down that road until you reach I-79, which you merge onto. Then you drive on that until Cranberry township, where you turn onto route 228. Then, continue until Mars. From Butler (North), go on Route 8, then turn onto route 228 until you reach mars. With these directions you can get here from anywhere along these routes as long as you are close to along them.

Get around[edit]
