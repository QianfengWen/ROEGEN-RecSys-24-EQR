Milton Keynes is a city of 245,000 people (2019) in the South East of England. Milton Keynes is well known in the UK as a planned city built in the 1960s with emphatically modernist architecture. Milton Keynes is a thriving city of contrasts; from innovative new business and entertainment hubs, to theatre, cinema, walks in natural parkland, pub lunches and peaceful canal trips; and yes, it really does have the famous concrete cows (as well as real ones)!


Understand[edit]
Imagine being able to design the perfect city almost completely from scratch. This is the premise under which internationally renowned urban planners and architects set out to create Milton Keynes in the 1960s and '70s. Of course, when mentioning Milton Keynes, people will often be met with "Ugh, it’s a soulless new city" or "What, is that the place with the concrete cows?" Most irritating is that often, the people that make those comments have neither lived there nor indeed spent much time there.  Yes, it is a new city and yes, the centre of that city could be described as a little soulless with its chain restaurants and large shopping centre, but it was built on and around land already settled and dotted around the 22,000 acres of countryside it resides in are many things to do, see and explore. Sites dating back to 2000 BC have been unearthed along with the remains of a major Roman villa, then dispersed amongst the city, itself built amongst many old towns. Also are numerous green spaces, a plethora of indoor and outdoor activities, and fabulous shopping opportunities. The Ministry of Housing and Local Governments brief in 1967 requested a new town that could accommodate an incoming population of 150,000 Londoners over a period of 20 years.  
The city includes a number of previous settlements and villages including Wolverton, Bletchley and Stony Stratford, all of which have expanded as part of its development.  Stony Stratford in particular has fabulous British pubs serving good food and beer, a good variety of quaint shops to browse and beautiful river walks just behind the high street.  Stony Stratford claims to be the place where the phrase ‘Cock & Bull Story’ was coined (from the name of two pubs/hotels on the High Street).

Buses in Milton Keynes are frequent, and all estates are quite well covered. There are regular buses from most places to the city centre, train station, and Bletchley. Travelling by car is usually preferable as one of Milton Keynes's saving graces is its road network, although during rush hour, it can get somewhat congested in some areas.
The dominance of the car is greatly helped by the road layout – the main roads of the city are laid out in a grid system with roundabouts at the intersections, so getting about is quick, although predictably less so in rush hour. The grid is formed of numbered 'H' roads running horizontally on the map and 'V' roads running vertically. Visitors who drive to Milton Keynes often get lost on these roads because they all look the same—the main roads are in tree-lined linear valleys to reduce road noise so there are few landmarks visible to navigate by. A map is recommended for people who are new to the town.
Pedestrians and cyclists have their own network of 'redways' – paths made of red tarmac that broadly follow the grid roads but never meet them, either crossing over or underneath. The redways are a good way to get about. As with any place you are unfamiliar with, caution is advised, and as many of the redways cross minor roads cyclists and those with children should beware of traffic!
The redways are often not well signposted, and that traversing them without a map can lead to you getting lost quite quickly!

Bletchley Park
51.996944-0.7419441 Bletchley Park, The Mansion, Bletchley Park, Sherwood Dr, Bletchley, MK3 6EB (next to Bletchley railway station), ☏ +44 1908 640404. During World War II this country estate was the headquarters of a code-breaking project named ULTRA. This was a huge triumph for British Intelligence; they broke nearly all the codes used by the Germans and Italians and read most of their supposedly secret communications throughout the war. This was of enormous value to Allied commanders.Arguably the Colossus machine — built at Bletchley to crack the Lorenz cipher used by parts of the German army — was the first programmable digital computer. Certainly Alan Turing — a Cambridge mathematician who was a key code-breaker during the war — made large contributions to the theory of computation before the war, and to both theory and practice after it. Several other ex-Bletchley people also became computer pioneers in the postwar yearsThe historic value of this site has now been belatedly recognised in the form of a museum with a significant number of things to do for both adults and children. All tickets are annual passes with unlimited entry for up to a year.

The Salford Swan, while not in Milton Keynes, is well worth a look for some excellent pub-restaurant food with a delightful atmosphere.

Drink[edit]
On a summer evening a trip to the theatre district or Xscape almost transports you to a Spanish holiday resort, such are the number of bars and clubs with people walking between them. Not much for a CAMRA member here though, as it's more for the bottle of Bud or Smirnoff Ice crowd.
More traditional pubs can be found along the Stony Stratford high street, popular for pub crawls at weekends. Newport Pagnell, a few miles from the city centre, is also a good option with many good pubs and a good atmosphere
