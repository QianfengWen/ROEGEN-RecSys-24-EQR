Devon is a town in Edmonton Capital Region.  It has a population of 6,600 people (2016). It is known for its botanical gardens.


Understand[edit]
Devon owes its existence to one of the largest oil discoveries in the world. On 1947 February 13, the Imperial Leduc #1 well struck oil, and the new town of Devon was constructed shortly thereafter by Imperial Oil to accommodate its workers. Devon sits on the south bank of the North Saskatchewan River; Parkland County is north of the river and Leduc County is south of the river.
