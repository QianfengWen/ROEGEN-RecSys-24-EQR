Heading south, Wollongong starts where Sydney finishes.  It is the third largest city in New South Wales behind Sydney and Newcastle and is thinly wedged on a coastal plain between an escarpment and the Pacific Ocean, in the Illawarra region. It is pronounced Wool-un-gong, a word of Aboriginal origin although the translation is not certain. The traditional owners of the land are the Dharawal people.


Understand[edit]
Geography[edit]
Geography defines Wollongong, as the city is never more than roughly 6 km at its widest but stretches over 40 km from south to north. Its growth was limited by mountains, which are not so much high as steep, and the sea, Wollongong has grown to include a whole chain of coastal towns, from Dapto and Port Kembla in the south to Bulli, Austinmer, and even up to Stanwell Park in the north. Continuous development has stretched the urban area along the coast as far as Kiama in the distant south but those areas are serviced by the growing centre of Shellharbour.
Most of Wollongong's suburbs, including several popular beach towns, are covered in this article. The very northern suburbs of Helensburgh and Stanwell Park are covered in their own articles; in many ways they have closer ties to southern Sydney than to Wollongong.

Industry[edit]
Its modern origins are in coal mining and steel production, industries which persist, notably the BlueScope steel facility at Port Kembla to the south. A dedicated port exists for the transport of materials whereas private craft and fishing boats use a separate facility nearer the CBD in Belmore Basin. New industries, such as financial services, information technology, tourism and education are fast becoming trademarks of the city.  Wollongong people are proud of the employment and heavy industry in the area, and choose to be more than just an outer commuter suburb for Sydney.

Community[edit]
The University of Wollongong is popular with local, other Australian and international students. Due to post war migration involving heavy industry, Wollongong also includes a large Mediterranean, Indian and Asian population which has left its mark on the city and means there is a great range of food and entertainment options.
There are many interesting and beautiful locations within easy reach. The immediate area possesses some fine, often uncrowded beaches and reasonable surfing.

By car[edit]
Grand Pacific Drive to Wollongong
The quickest way from Sydney is to take A1/M1 south.  You leave Sydney, and enter greater Wollongong just before the motorway starts. Its about 50 minutes drive to this point, and around another 20 minutes down the motorway to the Wollongong CBD.  Expect to take longer in the afternoon peak, Wollongong is a part of the Sydney commuter belt.
If you have a little longer, you can take a route via the Bulli Pass and the Wollongong Northern Beaches. At the end of the motorway the Bulli Pass road throws itself straight down the escarpment and along the coast.  The exit is well signposted after the end of the motorway.  Add 10 minutes for this diversion.
If you have a little longer still, a very scenic way to see more of Wollongong, the escarpment and the cliffs, is to take the Grand Pacific Drive (official website). Exit from the motorway at Helensburgh through Stanwell Park and down the coast. The road is well signposted to Wollongong.  The Sea Cliff Bridge is a highlight of this trip, between Coalcliff and Scarborough.
From the south of Wollongong, follow the Princes Highway (A1) north.
From Canberra or Melbourne, you can access Wollongong via the Illawarra Highway (A48) or via Picton Road (B88). Picton Road offers a faster, straighter trip, while the Illawarra Highway (A48) offers scenery with windy roads and the occasional waterfall and picnic areas.  To go the quick, Picton Road (A48) route, ignore the first exit sign to Wollongong from the Hume Highway (M31) at Moss Vale, and take the second, where the exit is also signposted to Picton and Cataract.

By train[edit]
The train services from Sydney to Wollongong are operated by NSW TrainLink, and have a usual weekday frequency of 15-30 minutes and 60 minutes on weekends. Each four-car train has two quiet carriages for those who want peace and quiet during their journey, and one easy access toilet on board. The trains can get pretty crowded during the morning and evening peaks heading towards and away from Sydney respectively (especially if there are only four carriages), but you should usually get a seat. In the weekday evening peak, these trains fill to standing room only until you pass Sutherland, as well as on Sunday afternoons heading back into Sydney. Similarly to all trains in the region, you can't book a seat, but rather pay with a reloadable Opal Card, a single trip Opal ticket, or a contactless credit/debit card at the Opal gates.
-34.42736150.887581 Wollongong Station is conveniently located in the CBD, and many of the other suburbs going up and down the coast have their own stations.
The train journey is a scenic, albeit a slow one, traversing the Royal National Park with views of the ocean and forest.  Sit on the left-hand side and upstairs (looking in the direction of travel) when travelling from Sydney or the right-hand side travelling to Sydney to get the best views. The trip on the limited stops trains takes around 90 minutes.

By plane[edit]
Wollongong is primarily serviced by scheduled international and domestic airline flights operating into Sydney Airport (SYD IATA) to the north of the city. Connecting links to Sydney are provided by rail and road.
To get to Wollongong by car from Sydney Airport drive 60 minutes south along the A1 Princes Hwy and M1 Princes Motorway. Follow the signs from the airport towards Wollongong and Rockdale to get to the Princes Highway, and from there follow the road and directional signage south to Wollongong.
To get to Wollongong by train from Sydney Airport, you have two options:

catch a T8 Airport Line train one or two stops to Wolli Creek, and then change for a train to Wollongong. All trains to Wollongong stop at Wolli Creek.
catch a T8 train to Central, then a South Coast line train down to Wollongong.
The latter is a better option during peak times as you're more likely to find a seat on the train from Central.
Private bus companies operate shuttle services from the airport to any destination door to door in the Illawarra/Wollongong region.

By train[edit]
The northern coastal suburbs of Wollongong are well-serviced by train; however, depending on the station, you can still be a kilometre or so from the beach. Stanwell Park, Austinmer, Coledale, Wombarra and Bulli are the best stations to access nearby beaches, with Austinmer the most popular.  All stations see hourly services.

By bike[edit]
See also: Cycling in New South Wales
An extensive cycle track runs from Wollongong north for 10 km to Thirroul, hugging the scenic beaches, or the same distance south to Windang and Lake Illawarra. This is generally uncrowded and a great way to get a feel for the city and surroundings. Within the city itself, cycling is a bit more challenging thanks to the numerous inclines. However, there are pop-up cycleways on Smith and Harbour Streets to Belmore Basin, and on Kembla Street between Smith and Crown Streets. Cycling is not allowed in Crown St Mall, although people can be seen pedalling through the mall regardless.
A good cycle route could take 60 km mostly off-road from Bulli to Kiama, hugging the coast and headlands the whole way, and passing close to all Wollongong has to offer.  You can put your bike on the train for the trip back.
You can hire bikes at Thirroul to ride south:

You can also find taxi ranks outside shopping centres in the Illawarra such as in Corrimal, Warrawong, Figtree, and Shellharbour.
Aside from taxis, ridesharing provider Uber also operates around Wollongong.

On foot[edit]
Despite its hilly topography, Wollongong is a relatively walkable city - you can easily walk from the train station to the Wollongong CBD, and all the way to Wollongong City Beach in about 30 minutes. There are several grey and orange wayfinding signs scattered around the downtown area, most of them situated at major intersections. These indicate the directions to points of interest such as the CBD, Arts Precinct, Wollongong train station, and foreshore.

Do[edit]
Swimming and surfing[edit]
During the summer months, Wollongong has 17 surf beaches to choose from, each with less crowds and more space than most Sydney beaches.  All have free foreshore parking, and most are accessible by public transport and bicycle.
To the north of the city try...

 North Beach. One of the most popular beaches, in front of Stuart Park and the Novotel. There is a kiosk right on the beach as well as other takeaway and restaurant options nearby.  You can find a shady spot under the trees in the park, just a few steps from the sand. 
 City (South) Beach. Right at the end of Crown St, by WIN Entertainment Centre.  Not as popular as North Beach, perhaps because the views to the south take in the steelworks and dunes rather than parks and headlands. Still, it is nice sand and a place to cool off only minutes walk from the CBD. 
 Austinmer. A very pleasant cove and small beach. Cafes and restaurants across the road, park and barbecues behind, some would say the ultimate beach, sometimes suffers from its popularity.  Go early or late on a sunny day. 
 Towradgi. A beach you are sure to get your own stretch of sand. 
To the south of the city try..

 Port Kembla. Maybe the Gong's most underrated beach.  Possibly associated with the steelworks and the town, but the beach is over the headland, very pretty, and possibly the longest stretch of sand on the Wollongong coastline.  Has parking, is on the coastal cycle track, and is about 2km from Port Kembla station. 
 Windang. Has the caravan park, and a feel more like a south coast beach.  Just near the entrance to Lake Illawarra, there are also nearby parks and bicycle rides near the lake. 
If you just want to do some laps, or for the kids to splash in the water, try the lap and leisure pools at Beaton Park, on Foley St (off Gipps Rd).

Walk and pedal[edit]
View from Sublime Point Lookout
 Cycle. There are designated cycle routes all across the Wollongong Region. If you want coastal scenery, cycle north from Wollongong towards Bulli, all off road and long stretches through parks. If you want to see Wollongong industry close up, cycle south to Port Kembla, passing the steelworks along the way. 
 Mount Keira Ring Track, 5 km loop. A very popular 5 km walk around Mount Keira. Eucalypt and rainforest scenery. However, beware of leeches if there is the slightest bit of rain. 
 Mountain Bike. There are rides for all levels of fitness and technical abilities on or around the escarpment. Rides include fire trails, single track and lightly used roads which provide a good workout for all ages. 
 Hiking. Various trails crisscross the escarpment west of Wollongong's northern suburbs. For instance, some nice hikes start from Foothills Road in Austinmer and Stephen Drive in Woonona. (updated Aug 2022)
-34.30279150.9259431 Sublime Point Walking Track. A steep, physically demanding hike through dense forest up the escarpment. Roughly an hour of hiking (if you don't take breaks), including lots of steps and some ladders, is rewarded with beautiful views of the Illawarra and the ships out at sea. The trailhead is about 30 minutes from Austinmer train station on foot. As of October 2022, the top part of the trail is temporarily closed for repairs, though the lookout is still reachable by car.

Drink[edit]
A growing city, Wollongong city holds a wide variety of bars. Generally, pubs close to the city but not in the actual CBD/North Wollongong proper tend to have unsavoury reputations. Wednesday nights are 'uni nights', and at places such as Castros and the Grand feature drink specials and cheap or free entry - expect a lot of young patrons.

 The North Wollongong Pub (North Gong for short) (North Wollongong train station). The "local" for the University of Wollongong, across the Princes Hwy from the North Wollongong train station. Major renovations in 2006 provided several bars, including a spacious outdoor garden, a bistro and bar inside, and a more formal (and dress-coded so you can't just wear your thongs/flip-flops) upstairs cocktail lounge. Although frequented by UOW students, North Gong remains popular with all ages. 
 Hotel Illawarra (Illawarra). Large hotel/pub that has been refurbished in wood and chrome. It receives the early morning crowd as it is the only bar that consistently closes at 3AM most nights of the week. Somewhat upper-class. Dress in smart casual. 
 The Grand Hotel (previously known as Cooneys) (at the south end of Keira St). A three part hotel. One features a number of 'pokies', pool tables, a bar, game machines and a lounge area. The second is a large outdoor beer garden and smoking area, while the third is a proper nightclub, complete with DJ booth and impressively sized dance floor and two separate bars. Hosts local and international acts on occasion. 
 Harp Hotel, 124 Corrimal St. A 'working class' pub with two bars (And a third that is only open day times or during special events, such as Australia day, for punters) featuring pokies, karaoke on Saturday nights, some live music Thursday evenings and a crowd of locals the rest of the time. The 'new bar' features a night club and a window onto the smoking section and the old bar is an area with a stage and a number of seating options. 
 Five Barrels Brewing, 318 Keira St (for directions see below), ☏ +61 2 4200 8881, phil@fivebarrels.com.au. Craft beer and burgers. 
 Dicey Riley's, 329-333 Crown St. An Irish hotel near Wollongong Train Station. Once known for being 'dicey', it is now one of the only venues in Wollongong to have live music on Friday and Saturday nights. With a new bistro, The Red Fox, it is the place to be. Especially on St Patrick's Day. 
 Fever Nightclub. Opens at 9PM yet is the only bar in town open past 3AM. Fever closes at 6AM weekend evenings, so if you want to make the most of a night out, it is the place to be! The club is smaller than some of the other venues in town, but makes up for it in atmosphere. The bar staff are entertaining, drink prices low and the music always lures you to the light-up dancefloor. 
 The Builders Club, 61 Church St (close to the CBD). Mainly older laidback crowd but The Builders is also very popular with students taking advantage of cheap drinks and $2 pool. The Builders is fantastic for a few early drinks and then maybe kicking on to the nightclubs later. Worth visiting to see the huge mural painted on the front wall. Thursday night and Friday day poker games.

Connect[edit]
Most of Wollongong has good mobile phone and data reception with all three carriers. You can easily get download speeds of at least 30Mbps in the CBD. However in the northern suburbs like Fairy Meadow and Corrimal, the Vodafone and Optus reception are quite poor (more so if you're not close to Princes Highway). If you'd be spending most of your time away from the downtown area, it's best to have either a Telstra SIM card or an operator like Boost Mobile that shares their network. Even then, coverage may be dicey in outlying suburbs like Austinmer where the escarpment can block signals.
There are a few coffee shops and McDonald's that offer free WiFi. Wollongong Library has free internet access at all libraries, and free WiFi at the City Library (ask staff for a ticket with username/password). The city library is in the council building on Burelli St, which runs parallel to and one street south of Crown St.

Cope[edit]
Media[edit]
Illawarra Mercury – the Illawarra region's daily newspaper, printing a mixture of quaintly mundane local stories, sensational crime reporting, and useful advice about upcoming events in the area.
Stay safe[edit]
There are some cases of drink-spiking so never leave your drink unattended. If you believe your drink has been spiked, speak to the security staff immediately. They will determine whether you have been spiked or not and if so will call an ambulance for you to ensure your safety.
Alcohol-fueled violence is common in town at night, primarily in Crown Street Mall and around takeaway food shops. Also beware of groups of young men in cars at City Beach (South Beach) at night and the Lagoon carpark. Do not wander around Unanderra and Dapto at night - both are unsafe, and sometimes during the day. Figtree can be nearly as bad, and Thursday nights in Crown Street Mall are often similar.

Go next[edit]
From Wollongong you can follow the coast southwards towards the Victorian border along the Princes Highway. This road is quite an interesting stretch of highway in Australia in that it follows the coast and headlands, giving you views as you drive along it. Many other coastal Australian highways usually stay a small distance from the coast, requiring side trips to see the scenery. At Batemans Bay you can turn inland to the Hume Highway via Braidwood to Canberra and Melbourne via the highway.
The Illawarra Highway (A48) is a scenic route through the Southern Highlands to the Hume Motorway/Highway. The road winds its way up through the Macquarie Pass, through Robertson and then on to the open road.

 Royal National Park. Travel north to the world's second national park and camp by the beach. 
 Kiama Blowhole. Travel south by train or car to Kiama, and visit the blowhole. The wait is worth it. 
 Kangaroo Valley. Kangaroo Valley is a peaceful location, inland of Nowra, and hour south of Wollongong. 
Minnamurra Rainforest and the larger, Budderoo National Park, near Jamberoo, is one of the state's most visited national parks. There's a visitors centre and many boardwalks through subtropical rainforest. Go early in the morning for the best chance at seeing wildlife such as lyrebirds and wombats.
If you are staying in Wollongong, Sydney is a fairly comfortable day trip.
