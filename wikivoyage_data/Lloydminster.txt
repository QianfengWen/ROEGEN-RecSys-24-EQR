Lloydminster is a city straddling the border between East Central Alberta region of Alberta and the West Central Saskatchewan region of Saskatchewan.  A geographic anomaly, it is one of only two settlements in Canada to operate a single municipal entity across two provinces. (The other, Flin Flon, is a small Manitoba mining village with one tiny portion in Saskatchewan.)

Map of Lloydminster
Lloydminster City Hall
The city was founded in 1903, at a time when modern-day Alberta and Saskatchewan were still part of the Northwest Territories. The provinces were created later with a boundary at 110° west longitude, right down 50th Avenue (Meridian Ave.). By 2021 the city had 31,600 people; principal local industries include agriculture and oil refining.

Due to differing sales tax structures (Alberta has no provincial sales tax) and time zones (Alberta observes Mountain Daylight Savings Time seasonally, Saskatchewan keeps Central Standard Time year-round), Lloydminster and its immediate trading area are part of Alberta's time zone and its businesses follow Alberta's sales tax rules. A 163-bed hospital in Saskatchewan serves both provinces; the city's Lakeland College campus is in Alberta and the local airport (YLL  IATA) moved from Saskatchewan to Alberta in 1981.
Saskatchewan addresses may be identified by their postal codes (which have a leading 'S') and telephone area codes (usually +1 306, sometimes +1 639).
