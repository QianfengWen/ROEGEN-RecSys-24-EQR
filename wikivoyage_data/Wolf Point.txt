Wolf Point is a town in northeastern Montana. About 2,500 people live there. It is the largest community on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation. The reservation is home to both the Assiniboine and Sioux Nation. It is unusual to have two tribes on the same reservation. 


Understand[edit]
Wolf Point is located on what Montanan's refer to as the Hi-Line. The group of towns on the Hi-line fall along Highway 2 from Culbertson to Browning. Other far northern towns are also sometimes referred to this way.
