Butterworth is the main town on the mainland side of Penang state in Malaysia. It was named after William John Butterworth, governor of the Straits Settlements from 1843-1855.

Butterworth Docks
Smaller, more industrial and practical, Butterworth does not have any of the atmosphere which George Town across the Penang Straits has. However, it is an important transportation hub for all train and many bus services which do not go directly to Penang Island.
Butterworth is also the mainland terminal for the Penang Ferry.

By bus[edit]
The 5.3943100.36752 bus station is a few metres from the train station, under the highway overpass. Any train station representative can point you in the direction of the bus stop.
Buses go into many destinations throughout the country.

To/from Kuala Lumpur - almost hourly, journey takes 5 hours and costs around RM25. If you are in a rush to get to KL, the bus may be your best bet. The journey time can be half as long. Most of the coaches have air-con, as well as other comforts. The buses, in most cases, do not have restrooms. However, the buses make a number of breaks at rest stops, which have restrooms, food and drinks available.  Much of the journey is very scenic.
Beware of the friendly and helpful touts preying on tourists at the bus station. They aren't selling tickets; they sell a voucher which you later exchange for a ticket, at which stage you'll find you've been overcharged by several ringgit.

By boat[edit]
The much-loved Penang ferry departs regularly from the 5.3948100.36363 Butterworth Ferry Terminal for George Town. The ferry terminal is connected with the railway station and bus terminal via covered walkways. In 2019 there was ongoing building work, making connections a little convoluted: in general, from the train station entrance take a left to the bus terminal, where the ferry terminal may be reached from the first floor, above the buses. Travellers may want to consider using toilets at their hotels or at restaurants as the ferry toilets are infamous for their overuse and offensive odours.
