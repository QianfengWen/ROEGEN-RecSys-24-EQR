Grahamstown, also known as Makhanda, is a town of 140,000 people (2022) in the Cacadu District of the Eastern Cape. This charming and picturesque small city is well worth a visit. It has maintained its old-time demeanour, and has many examples of buildings in the Victorian, Colonial and Gothic Revivalist styles. It is known as The City of Saints because it has more than 40 churches, and as Africa's Festival Capital because six national events are celebrated here each year.

Frontier Country is a vibrant mix of all the best of Africa - where many intense battles were fought and many famous warriors are remembered. True country hospitality reigns in this area with its world class game lodges, hotels and guest houses. The delightful towns of Alicedale and Riebeeck East are also situated in the area and are fast gaining local and international popularity for their lingering history and the many prestigious game reserves that surround them.
The town was named after Colonel John Graham, its founder in 1812, after the Fourth Frontier War, between the British and Xhosa. In 2018, it was renamed "Makhanda" (prophet) in memory of Xhosa warrior and prophet Makhanda ka Nxele.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
There are two airports near Grahamstown. The closest is the Port Elizabeth airport which is 114 km from Grahamstown. The East London airport is 123 km away. There are regular flights from Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban and other South African destinations to the airports in Port Elizabeth and East London.

By road[edit]

Grahamstown lies just off the N2 highway about 110 km (70 mi) northeast of Port Elizabeth and 130 km (80 mi) southwest o East London. From Port Alfred in the south, follow the R67 north through Bathurst. From the north, a number of different routes converge on Grahamstown. Grahamstown is easily accessible by motorways from Cape Town (887 km), Durban (671 km), and East London (152 km). You could also drive in from Johannesburg (950 km). The road conditions are fairly good if you are coming from any of these cities.

By rail[edit]
The station is on Ayliff street (right in town). However there is no longer a train between Grahamstown and Alicedale, inland to the west.
From Alicedale there are regular trains south to Port Elizabeth and north to Bloemfontein and Johannesburg.
For several years there has been talk of reviving the disused rail link between Grahamstown and Port Alfred, but this project is still very far from completion.

By bus[edit]
Several companies, including Greyhound and Intercape, run long distance buses between Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, which stop off at Grahamstown along the way. If you choose to travel like this, remember to take some toilet roll as the bus may run out pretty quickly. Minibus taxis from Raglan Street go to Port Elizaberth R40 3 hours, and East London R60 4 hours.
