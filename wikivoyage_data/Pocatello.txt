Pocatello is a college town in Southeastern Idaho. About 57,000 people lived there in 2021.


Understand[edit]
Named after a noted 19th-century Shoshoni chief, Pocatello is a working-class town with a strong railroad and trade union heritage. As such it has more of a blue-collar feel to it than the other major Idaho cities. At one time the city boasted the largest rail yard west of the Mississippi River. The city has a reputation for being a (slightly) more progressive enclave in otherwise conservative, Mormon-dominated Eastern Idaho.
Although the presence of Idaho State University in Pocatello unquestionably makes it a college town as well, student life is somewhat more sedate than in other college towns in the region such as Moscow, Idaho, or Missoula, Montana. The bar scene can be lively on the weekends, but don't expect to find too many raging frat house keggers here.

Get in[edit]
42.9098-112.5961 Pocatello Regional Airport (PIH  IATA), 1950 Airport Way. Is served by regular flights from Salt Lake City on SkyWest Airlines. There are no scheduled commercial flights to or from other locations in Idaho. The airport in Idaho Falls, 45 minutes away, offers a more robust schedule.   
Pocatello can be accessed by car via Interstate 15 from Idaho Falls in the north and Salt Lake City in the south. Pocatello is the eastern terminus of Interstate 86, which connects the city to the Twin Falls area in the west.
Intercity bus service is provided by Salt Lake Express and Greyhound.
Despite its railroad heritage, Pocatello now has no passenger rail service. For decades the railroad tracks have been used only for freight trains.
Get around[edit]
Pocatello Regional Transit offers limited bus service.

Stay safe[edit]
Pocatello tends to have more snow and more severe snowstorms than the other major cities in Idaho (although not as severe as places like Stanley). Given that and the city's hilly landscape, driving can be a challenge in the winter.
The Pocatello area is also subject to inversions in the winter months. This, combined with the output of nearby fertilizer plants, can make air quality an issue.
