For other places with the same name, see Liverpool (disambiguation).

Liverpool is a big city in Merseyside, England, within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire, famed for its football teams, the Grand National horse race, music (including The Beatles), vibrant nightlife and its links with the arts and culture.
The city served as one of the leading ports linking Europe to the Americas, expanding to become England's second most populated city by the census of 1861, before slowly declining after 1921 as levels of transatlantic shipping dropped. Before airline travel, many Europeans migrating to the New World passed through the city, particularly the Italians and Irish; to this day the city enjoys a large Irish community, with impressive cathedrals for the Anglican and Roman Catholic faiths. In the 18th and early 19th century the port also acted as a gateway for the slave trade, with echoes of this period still evident in places around the city.
A comprehensive regeneration of the city centre has caused an influx of new shops, boutiques, and large performance/conference arenas near the waterfront; this has resulted in an upturn in population figures.  The regenerated city now plays regular host to national and international conference, media and music events; examples include major political party conferences, the BBC Worldwide Showcase, the MTV Europe Awards, and the Global Entrepreneurship Congress.


Understand[edit]
The Three Graces, Pier Head, Liverpool
Liverpool is a city with great cultural heritage and was awarded the title of European Capital of Culture 2008, with the famous Pier Head Waterfront being a UNESCO World Heritage site between 2004 and 2021. Liverpool is home to the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and is also renowned for nurturing the talents of a wide range of musicians and band such as The Beatles, Gerry and the Pacemakers, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Echo and the Bunnymen, and Elvis Costello. The city possesses the largest national museum collection outside of London and has a fascinating and turbulent history as a great world maritime centre. Liverpool is home to Europe's oldest Chinatown. The famous Grand National Horse Race takes place in the outskirts of the city (Aintree). It is also home to two very successful Premier League football clubs, Liverpool and Everton. People from Liverpool are called Liverpudlians, or more popularly, Scousers. The latter name comes from the local lamb stew recipe, scouse. The word "Liverpudlian" can also refer to supporters of Liverpool FC, while "Scouser" is seen as more inclusive of Evertonians.
Although historically part of Lancashire, in contrast to natives of neighbouring Manchester, most Scousers have a strong local identity and do not identify as Lancastrians.

Talk[edit]
English is the main language, but it is spoken with a very distinctive Scouse accent that has strong Irish and Welsh influences, and differs greatly even from that of the surrounding areas. There was historically a large Welsh-speaking population in Liverpool, to the extent that the National Eisteddfod was held in the city three times between 1884 and 1929. While there is still a Welsh-speaking minority, most Welsh-descended people adopted English as their sole native language over the course of the 20th century. Due to the city's status as a port city and waves of immigration over the centuries, Chinese, Italian, French, and Spanish are spoken by some. Indeed, Liverpool is home to Europe's oldest permanent Chinese community. In some parts, South American Spanish is spoken due to immigration from Latin America. Creole languages can be heard occasionally due to the large Afro-Caribbean community.

Liverpool John Lennon Airport
53.333611-2.8497221 Liverpool John Lennon Airport (LPL  IATA) (about 12 km (7.5 mi) to the south of the city centre). Around 160 flights arrive daily from within the UK and Europe. The airport is well-served by low-cost airlines including Easyjet and Ryanair. For a complete listing of airlines and destinations, please see thedestination list.   (updated Jun 2022)
Immediately outside the arrivals area, you will find a taxi rank and bus stops. Taxis to the city centre cost around £20-25 for the 25-minute journey. There is £5 additional fee for taxis hailed at the airport.
The airport is served by several bus routes, all costing £2 per single adult journey, which can be paid using contactless. Cash is accepted but you should ideally have the correct change or a small note (£5).

Bus 500 - This is the most important bus for tourists as it serves the city centre with limited stops. It operates every 30 minutes and takes roughly 30 minutes to reach the city centre.
Note - Other buses such as the 86A will have Liverpool One as their destination. While more frequent than the 500, the journey time is significantly longer. It would typically be better to wait for the 500 bus if your hotel is in the city centre.

The No. 80A, run by Arriva, runs every 15 minutes and takes 45 minutes to the city centre.
The No. 82A, also run by Arriva, runs every 30 minutes and takes around 40 minutes to the city centre. This runs directly to Paradise Street interchange without stopping elsewhere in the city centre.
The No. 86A (Arriva) runs every 15 minutes during the day and now runs through the night, every half hour. This takes a little less time than the 80A as it is a more direct route down Smithdown Road. The journey time is 40 minutes but may be longer at peak traffic times.
The No. 81A also serves the airport but does not go into the city centre. It may prove useful if you want to visit Woolton or the north of the city, as the route goes around the city ring road, Queens Drive, and terminates in Bootle.
53.3577-2.88972 Liverpool South Parkway station. The 80A and 86A buses also stop here. It's a 10-minute journey from where a frequent train service runs to the city centre in about 15 minutes. This may be a better option at times of peak road traffic (8AM-9AM, 5PM-6PM).   (updated Jun 2022)
The airport has two onsite car parks and Skypark[dead link] is nearby.
The airport offers a Fast Track service, which for a charge, means you can bypass the queue at security, but this tends to be worthwhile only for first flights of the day or if you risk missing your flight.
Manchester Airport (MAN IATA) can also be used and may be a better option. It is about a 45-60 minute drive away from Liverpool. Direct train services also run between Liverpool Lime Street Station and Manchester Airport operated by Northern Rail. Manchester Airport serves a variety of long haul destinations in North America and Asia, as well as short haul services throughout Europe.

By train[edit]
Liverpool Lime Street Station
Wikivoyage has a guide to Rail travel in Great Britain.
Liverpool is served by 53.4075-2.97843 Liverpool Lime Street station which is in the heart of the city centre. Trains arrive frequently from many parts of England. Trains from London Euston arrive on the south side (right when viewed from the main entrance), while those from Manchester arrive on the north side. The Wirral Line of the city's underground network (detailed in the Merseyrail section below) stops in a tube tunnel under the station.
You can get to Liverpool easily from London, Manchester, and the major cities of northern England by high-speed rail (by British standards - 125 mph) without changing trains. These services are provided by Avanti for London and the west coast and Transpennine Express for the north. These destinations are served by other companies, including Northern, EMR, and LNWR, which offer regional stopping services calling smaller destinations on the route. Birmingham and Norwich are the odd-ones-out, and are only connected by stopping services provided by LNWR and EMR respectively. Like all rail travel in the UK, there is no cost premium for using a high-speed service over a stopping one, and high-speed trains are often more modern and comfortable than stopping ones.
Liverpool is only about 2½ hours from London by train. There's a train about every hour, with extra weekday evening peak services from London, and it's not too expensive to get there. You can get a saver ticket for £100 on the day of travel, or for as little as £21 if you book a couple of weeks in advance (Feb 2024). Tickets are released three months in advance.
There is a direct train from Manchester Airport to Liverpool every hour at peak times (around 6:30AM–7:30PM). In addition, it is possible to reach Liverpool from Manchester Airport by changing at Manchester Piccadilly or Manchester Oxford Road.
Other main services:

Birmingham, 1 hr 30 min – 1 hr 45 min, half hourly
Manchester, 50 min – 1 hr 10 min, 5 trains an hour (3 fast to Piccadilly and Oxford Road, of which 1 via Earlestown and 2 via Warrington, 1 slow to Oxford Road (extra services in peak times) and 1 slow to Victoria)
Leeds, 2 hours, hourly. These trains continue to York (2 hr 15 min) and Newcastle upon Tyne (3 hr 15 mins).
Sheffield and Nottingham, 1 hr 30 min and 3 hours respectively, hourly
By bus[edit]
Liverpool Motorways
National Express, the UK's largest scheduled coach company, uses Liverpool One Bus Station. London is 4-5 hours away by coach and is served by a half a dozen services per day. Manchester is served by an hourly service taking a similar time to the train (except at rush hour). Manchester Airport can be reached by coach in under one hour, six coaches run per day.
Megabus operates a network across the UK. There is one bus daily from London to Liverpool. Journey time 4–5 hours. Prices also start at £1 and then increase depending on how far in advance you book. Megabus use the Liverpool One Coach Station.
A Park and Ride scheme aims to provide easy access to the city centre, for more information see National Park and Ride Directory.

By car[edit]
Liverpool has good motorway connections, being served by the M62 (from the M6), M53, M57 and M58.
If you are travelling from the south, your journey may take you across the River Mersey through one of the two road tunnels from Birkenhead or Wallasey, or across the Mersey Gateway or Silver Jubilee bridges from Runcorn to Widnes. Each of these crossings are tolled. At the tunnels, payment can be made in cash at the toll booth, but the bridges have only e-tolls. You must pay online at Merseyflow by midnight the following day or face a penalty charge through the post.

By boat[edit]
RMS Queen Mary 2 with HSC Manannan (Isle of Man Steam Packet)
53.4073-3.00014 Liverpool Cruise Terminal. Opened in the city centre in 2007.   (updated Dec 2023)
Isle of Man Steam Packet services aboard HSC Manannan operate between Douglas and Liverpool city centre during summertime. At other times of the year, ferries going to the Isle of Man dock at Birkenhead, on the other side of the Mersey; for Liverpool, take the train or Mersey Ferry to get to Birkenhead ferry terminal.
53.4549-3.01895 Gladstone Dock. Port of Liverpool, in neighbouring Bootle, has P&O Ferries to and from Dublin.For leisure boats coming from inland, there is a direct connection between the Mersey and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal.   (updated Dec 2023)
53.40473-2.996686 Pier Head (George's Pier Head). Ferries run from Birkenhead to Liverpool.   (updated Dec 2023)
From Birkenhead, pedestrians and cyclists can catch the Mersey Ferries commuter service every 20 minutes between 7:20AM and 9:40AM, with a journey time of 10 minutes to Liverpool's Pier Head. The evening return service operates every 20 min between 5PM and 6:40PM. An adult ticket costs £3/£3.80 single/return, and a child ticket costs £1.45/£2 single/return. You can also bring your bicycle for free. Between rush hours, the ferries operate a river cruise service which provides an hourly link from Birkenhead to Liverpool. However, this is aimed at tourists so the crossing is much more leisurely and the tickets cost three times as much.

Liverpool City Centre is walkable, but those with mobility impairments or who are feeling lazy may prefer buses, Merseyrail, or taxis (including Uber, Ola, and local Delta as well as well as plentiful black cabs).

By public transport[edit]
By bus[edit]
Buses run out from the centre regularly from Liverpool One Bus Station in Canning Place (mainly to the south) and Queen Square Bus Station in Roe and Hood Sts. (mainly north/east). Both bus stations have travel centres with staff who will assist with which bus to get and from where. These travel centres also stock free transport guides and detailed timetable leaflets for each bus and train service. Highly recommended are the free 'map and guide' leaflets of the four main transport subdivisions of the Liverpool metropolitan area: Liverpool, Wirral (west), Southport (north) and St. Helens (east); these giant fold-out street maps show at a glance the route of every bus service (individual service leaflets are required for timetable information).

By Merseyrail (underground / metro)[edit]
Liverpool and the surrounding region is served by an excellent mass-transit system, which is indispensable for the visitor who wishes to explore outside the city centre. Destinations such as Chester, the Anthony Gormley sculpture "Another Place" (in Crosby), and the seaside town of Southport are popular tourist destinations on the network.
Due to the short distances involved, and the few central stations, the Merseyrail network is of limited value for money getting around the City Centre as the stations can be usually be walked between in the time it takes to descend, travel, and ascend, with the possible exception of James Street to Lime Street. The network has several gaps in coverage as the latest expansions of the City Centre (such as the Baltic Triangle and North Docks), and Anfield Stadium do not have nearby stations. The Knowledge Quarter university district also suffers from poor Merseyrail connectivity, with the nearest station down a steep hill. The local government is seeking to amend some of these deficits - for example, funding has been approved to re-open a defunct station in the Baltic Triangle.

Map of the Merseyrail network and City Line.
The Merseyrail lines are:

Northern Line (blue): This runs south-north from Hunts Cross to Southport, with branches to Ormskirk and Kirkby. Each branch runs at least twice an hour from 6AM (8AM on Sunday) to midnight, as does the main line, & the Ormskirk and Kirkby branches run along the main line as far as Liverpool Central.
Wirral Line (green): Trains on this line serve the city centre in a loop (James Street > Moorfields > Lime Street > Central > James Street), before running through a tunnel under the Mersey to Birkenhead. There, they branch out to West Kirby and Chester, with further branches to New Brighton and Ellesmere Port. Each branch runs at least twice an hour from 6AM (8AM on Sundays) to midnight, and all 4 branches run onto the loop.
Merseytravel also manages:

City Line (red): Not really a Merseyrail line, but a collective name encompassing all mainline local services from Lime Street. It has 4 branches, unusually named "books" after the booklets the timetables are distributed in:
Book 1 serves the Liverpool to Manchester route via Warrington.
Book 2 serves Liverpool South Parkway, branching out there to Runcorn and Crewe (local half-hourly; expresses to London and Birmingham also use this line), and to Warrington Central and Manchester Oxford Road & Piccadilly (local half-hourly, express half-hourly).
Book 3 services, along the world's first mainline railway, run to Manchester (hourly stopping trains to Victoria, hourly expresses to Oxford Road and Piccadilly (local services half-hourly, expresses half-hourly).
Book 4 connects Liverpool with St Helens and Wigan North Western, and Blackpool. Local services at least twice an hour run 6AM (9AM on Sundays) to midnight. Hourly express services continue to Preston. On their previous journey into Lime Street, many of these expresses came via South Parkway, which may be beneficial to passengers bearing luggage.
The City Centre is served by four stations. The Wirral Line serves all in a clockwise loop, while the Northern Line runs both ways north-south and serves Liverpool Central and Moorfields. City Line trains use ground-level platforms at Lime Street.

53.4087-2.98947 Moorfields is located on a small one-way street between Dale and Tithebarn Sts. in the business district.
53.4075-2.97848 Lime Street is in a prominent position in the north-east of the city centre. It is closest to the museums on William Brown St.
53.4048-2.98029 Liverpool Central is in a shopping centre accessed from Ranelagh and Bold Sts. It is most convenient for the shopping area & cathedrals.
53.4048-2.991710 James Street is accessed by lifts on James St. or a steep ramp (limited access, rush hours only) on Water St. Nearby sights include the Liver Building on Pier Head.
Liverpool South Parkway, on the City and Northern Lines. It is the closest station to John Lennon Airport, to which it has a shuttle bus. It also provides a direct interchange from regional and long-distance services to the Northern Line, should your train stop there.
If you are switching from Merseyrail to the National Rail network, use Lime Street, which is Liverpool's main station; Liverpool Central is only the central station of the Merseyrail network. In addition, some locals may refer to services on the City Line as the Northern, named after the regional train operating company, which should not be confused with the Northern Line run by Merseyrail.
A common mistake made by visitors is to think of the Wirral Line's city-centre loop as a circular line - implying that if one misses their stop, they may wait for it to come around again. In reality the loop is shaped like a lasso; if you stay on a train after passing through James Street a second time you will unexpectedly find yourself in Birkenhead.

Ticketing[edit]
Although an urban system, Merseyrail is a National Rail operator, meaning that ticketing is seamless between it and mainline rail services. A ticket can be bought from anywhere in the country to a Merseyrail station, and vice-versa, with no need to purchase a separate ticket for the Merseyrail network. This saves money and is very useful if you wish to travel directly to a part of the Liverpool City Region with no mainline rail service. Buying a simple single or return ticket from a ticket office or machine is the same as buying any other National Rail ticket.

Northern Line trains at Liverpool Central, a major interchange between the two lines of the Merseyrail network.
Saveaway, Solo and Trio travel passes can be purchased from travel centres or Merseyrail stations. Liverpool and its surrounding areas are divided up into areas, each sub-divided into zones: the cost of each ticket typically depends upon how many zones/areas you want to travel in. If a journey takes you outside the boundary allowed by your ticket, you can typically purchase a regular ticket on the bus or train to cover just the extra required.

Solo and Trio passes are weekly, monthly or annual travel passes, usable at any time of the day. Solo tickets may be used only on buses; Trio tickets may be used on buses, ferries or Merseyrail trains. The pass may only be purchased from Merseytravel centres, but it can be renewed (up to three days before expiry) at any travel or train station in Merseyside.
A Merseyrail Only Railpass is a cheaper alternative, but is not valid on the City Line (despite stations carrying Merseyrail branding, the train service is provided by regional operator Northern).
Metro Cards are smart travel cards that are ideal for the majority of short term visitors. They are cheap, off-peak (after 9:30AM M-F, all day Sa & Su) single-day tickets that cover buses, ferries and Merseyrail trains. They may also be used by more than one person (although not at the same time). They are £3.90 for unlimited off-peak travel in 'Area C' (covering the city centre, west out to Huyton, north to Crosby and south to Speke), and £5.20 for an 'All-Zone' ticket covering the whole of the Merseytravel area (perfect for visiting the Wirral, Chester or Southport). Cards are available from all stations, Travelcentres, and shops displaying the yellow 'PayPoint' sign. The card allows including online ticket purchasing and tap-in-tap-out ticketing.
Adult bus fares on the main operators are:
Arriva flat fare of £2.30 throughout the Liverpool area, £3.70 for Liverpool area Day Ticket, £4.40 for Northwest area.
Stagecoach flat fare of £2.00 throughout the Liverpool area, £3.30 for Liverpool area Day Ticket, £3.60 for Northwest area.
Arriva and Stagecoach Day and Weekly tickets may be used on either companies buses on new Quality Partnership Routes 10/10A/10B/10C (Huyton,St Helens), 86/86A/86D/86E (Speke,Airport,South Parkway), 53/53A (Crosby,Aintree), 14/14X (Croxteth,Kirkby). Similar flat fares are available from the other operators as well. There are a few night bus services on a Saturday night costing £3.00. (All prices correct as of April 2017.)
Some buses, such as early morning and hospital services, have a fixed fare of £1.10. This includes the City Centre Circular buses C1 to C5.
If you plan to travel a lot, a pass presents much better value. Generally speaking, you save money with two or more train trips or three or more bus journeys.
Both major bus companies accept contactless payment (including Apple Pay and Google Pay, although unlike London you still have to buy a ticket from the driver). Having spare cash is recommended as some buses on minor routes may not yet be equipped.

Old (St. Nicholas and Our Lady Church) and new architecture
Liverpool is particularly famous for its architecture, to the point where English Heritage consider it England's finest Victorian city. Once dilapidated and dirty during the dark times of the 1980s, modern Liverpool presents its architecture with full civic pride.

Pier Head[edit]
Museum of Liverpool
The Wheel
The harbour of Liverpool has played a very important role in modern history of the city. The wharf area drained by the Mersey River gives to the city an air of antiquity, which is quite strange and interesting because of the contrast between modern buildings and conventional buildings. The Pier Head was recognised as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO between 2004 and 2021, when it was controversially delisted due to modern development.

Sports[edit]




Better view from up here?
Spioenkop is Afrikaans for "Lookout Hill" - a steep hill 25 miles west of Ladysmith in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. In 1900 Ladysmith was besieged by the Boers; British troops stormed the hill to try to break their lines, and held it for 24 hours in a bloody and bungled battle. Gandhi was a stretcher-bearer here, and Winston Churchill in the thick of it as a war correspondent. The Lancashire Fusiliers and the Royal Lancasters, both with many Liverpool men, were heavily engaged. The British eventually withdrew, but succeeded in relieving Ladysmith four weeks later.
In England, 19th century football crowds just stood around the pitch, jostling for a view. At the big clubs this became unmanageable so they erected earth embankments, and later built stadia. Arsenal's was the first to be called "Spion Kop", closely followed by Liverpool then other clubs, and meant a steep terrace for home supporters behind the goals. These give a great view of action around the near goal, but on a misty winter evening it's sometimes hard to see what's happening around the far goalmouth.
But that was a familiar feeling to those fans' Victorian forebears. The British assault on Spioenkop took place in night, fog and confusion. Had they taken the nearby main summits as intended, they would have routed the Boers. Instead, as daybreak burned away the mist, they found themselves on a lesser hill from which they couldn't bombard the enemy, and couldn't defend. They'd captured the wrong Kop.

Lark Lane[edit]
The Albert, Lark Lane
Lark Lane is about 2.5 miles to the south of the city centre, a very pleasant (and less stressful than the city) place and is one of the better places to eat out. The road, which connects Aigburth Road with Sefton Park, is home to many unique restaurants, cafés and other shops. It is quite isolated, i.e. you will only find residential areas around it, but the street itself is worth the trip. Most pubs and bars serve real ales. Some choice picks include:

53.380311-2.94672548 Third Place(?) Café, Little Parkfield Road, L17 8US (At the corner with Lark), ☏ +44 151 728-8259. Bills itself as The first choice cafe for veggies.

Liverpool's nightlife is both famous and infamous, with Rough Guides placing a night out in the city at number three on their list of fifty things to do before you die. There's a huge selection of pubs, clubs and bars to suit a variety of music and atmospheric tastes. Friday and especially Saturday nights are the busiest nights, although a few bars are busy with students throughout the week. The areas around Mathew Street and Concert Square with nearby Wood Street are the main two nocturnal focal points. There is a good mix of locals and students. It is best to dress smart for the majority of bars and clubs (such as "Society" and "Garlands"). Notable exceptions are places like Le Bateau, the Krazy house, the Caledonia and other places of a similar alternative style. Like any major UK city, it is pretty safe out at night. The local police have had a heavy presence on a Friday and Saturday night to combat any problems and are largely succeeding. It is pretty busy getting out of the city centre at the end of a weekend (especially at the start of university term time - Sep/Oct). There are plenty of black hackney cabs which congregate at various taxi ranks. The Merseyrail system works until about midnight, whilst there are a series of dedicated night buses which run from the main bus stations, usually for a flat fare. All modes of transport tend to become very busy from around midnight.
Liverpool is home to the Cains brewery which produces a large selection of cask beers.

Dr Duncan's, St John's Lane – This is the premier pub for the local Cains brewery. It has a fine reputation and consequently is full of middle-aged professional drinkers. The pub has the full range of Cains beers, including Dr Duncan's IPA. Rudimentary bar menu, but good busy atmosphere on the weekend.
The Dispensary, Intersection of Renshaw and Leece Streets – Another of the local Cains brewery houses. Charming Victorian bar area. Usually has two rotating guest beers, plus a large selection of bottled beers and ciders.
 The Globe, 17 Cases St (tucked away, adjacent to Clayton Square shopping centre, opposite the Ranelagh Street entrance of Central Station). A small, often cramped. This is a traditional Liverpool pub, with no-nonsense barmaids. Usually busy after 5PM and during the weekend, acting as a refuge for husbands abandoned by, or having escaped from, their shopping-mad spouses. Always a good variety of guests. 
 The Richard John Blacker (JD Wetherspoons), Charlotte Row, Unit 1/3, 53 Great Charlotte St, L1 1HU, ☏ +44 151 709-4802. 
 The Crown, 43 Lime St. Next to the station. Most likely the first pub you will see upon arriving in Liverpool. 
The Pilgrim, Pilgrim Street – Located off Hardman Street, this pub serves the best breakfast in town, £4 for a king size feast. You also get to share the pub with stag parties and students wondering what happened the night before.
 The Canarvon Castle, 5 Tarleton St. Established for about 200 years, this small and homely pub was named after Lord Carnarvon. Packed full of collectors items - model cars, lorries, handcuffs and truncheons - it attracts a mixture of clientele. Serving good quality real ales, the pub is also popular for its range of hot snacks including the well-loved Carnarvon toasties. 
Pig & Whistle, 12 Covent Garden. This pub has been refurbished and transformed into a rather fake-looking pub.
 Peter Kavanagh's, 2-6 Egerton St, ☏ +44 151 709 3443. An unusual and old-world hideaway can be found just outside the city centre. Built 150 years ago, the walls are adorned with art deco murals painted in 1929 and the snugs are themed with various artefacts such as musical instruments and chamber pots. The friendly atmosphere makes this a favourite with artists, locals, travellers and musicians. George Melly, a famous jazz player is known to frequent this pub when visiting the city. If you're in for a traditional English breakfast, this pub serves great black pudding and all the fixings from noon to 4PM. 
 Poste House, 23 Cumberland St. Most nights has a gay friendly bar serving cheap cocktails upstairs from the main pub. 
The Brookhouse Smithdown Rd. Used to be one of Liverpool's pubs was a hangout of bands of the late 1980s such as the La's. It's now most popular with students, and is known for its Liverpool games when locals lead the Liverpool chants and become the vocal cords of this old pub.
 The Old Post Office, School Ln. Friendly pub famous for its steak and mixed grill meals. Great for watching sports as there are three TVs including one big screen. 
The Vines, Lime Street – A stylish club.
GBar, Eberle Street – Popular gay-friendly club with two floors. Upstairs, 'The Church' offers funky house music and campy classics in the 'Love Lounge'. Downstairs 'The Bass-ment' pumps out quality vocal house music. Open Th-M. Costs £5-7 for non-members.

O'Neills, Wood Street – Part of the O'Neills chain but don't let that put you off. Its managed by two real Irish men who know what a real Irish bar means. Good beer, food and good music is always on hand here. You also might bump into a few Liverpool FC players drinking in the corner.

Although the original Cavern Club—a former bomb shelter in the basement of a Liverpool warehouse—was filled in in the 1970s, it was re-excavated and recreated in the 1980s using many of the same bricks. Today it continues as a live music venue, not to mention a tourist attraction. Many of Britain's most popular groups played its stage in the 1960s, most famously The Beatles, who made almost 300 appearances here between 1961 and 1963.

An open fireplace and displays of old prints add to the comfortable ambience.

Stay safe[edit]
Liverpool is policed by Merseyside Police. If you need immediate assistance in an emergency, dial 999. For non-emergency assistance, either telephone 101 or visit one of two city centre Police stations open to the public:

St Anne's St Police Station, St Anne's St, Liverpool, L3 3HJ
Merseyside Police Headquarters, Canning Place, L1 8JX
Crime rates in Liverpool are low compared with most other large cities in the UK. You are no more likely to be a victim here than most other European cities. However, as in other cities, you should observe a few simple precautions. Don't leave valuables on display in an unattended car, for example. Even an empty car will get a smashed window from time to time, so try to park yours at private parks when the night comes. Try to stay aware of your surroundings and be discreet with cash, expensive camera equipment, etc.
Scousers are mainly gregarious and friendly people, but there are still some who seek to take advantage. You will find, however, that Mancunians and Scousers get along much better than the stereotype suggests and you will very often come across each in each other's city. Be particularly aware of people who approach you in the street with stories of having lost their train fare home. These are typically begging techniques.
Stay on the beaten track at night and stick to the many themed pub and bars and avoid some of the larger dance clubs as these are more suited to streetwise locals or people who understand Liverpool culture well, although to be fair, most Scousers will welcome anyone to their city, and especially their clubs! Be prepared to wait for a taxi at night and don't be tempted to walk back to your hotel unless you are close by. Although Liverpool is a quite friendly place, a slightly sinister side appears after hours.
Some of the City's districts should be avoided by non-locals. Areas such as Croxteth, Dovecot, Everton, Huyton, Kensington, Kirkdale, Norris Green, Page Moss, Stockbridge Village and Toxteth are seeing some serious issues with gang related violence including increases in gun and knife crime and several murders have been recorded.
Around the city centre, be aware there are many homeless people, especially around William Brown Street near the museums. Unlike, in, say, the United States of America or other parts of the United Kingdom, these are less likely to pose a threat to you, and although they may beg for money, they tend to be friendly and often want to talk about their backstories openly with you. Give them money, but at your own risk, as long as it's small change.
Also, older women may (and often do) flirt with younger men, but accept this part of the Liverpool cultural milieu. This also applies to the homelessness situation mentioned above, which much the same situation tends to happen. This should not be confused with prostitution (mentioned below). It is explicitly not solicitation, and is just flirting.
Although prostitution is legal in the UK, solicitation is illegal and it is a fact of life in most cities, Liverpool being no exception. The "Red Light" areas are as follows: around Netherfield Road North and the Shiel Road area of Kensington. Although quiet during the day, there is a lot of business at night and particularly on weekends. Women walking by themselves have been known to be approached by men looking for prostitutes and people in vehicles have been known to be approached by prostitutes looking for business.
Avoid Manchester United shirts, which worn in the wrong place makes you an easy target for abuse or even assault, especially on match day.
A friendly manner, a polite smile, and a sense of humour go a long way in this city, but a sensible approach to travelling is, as always, advisable.
The 1989 Hillsborough Stadium Disaster, when 97 Liverpool FC fans were killed, is still a very sensitive subject that is best avoided. Carrying or reading The Sun newspaper, which lied about Liverpool fans' behaviour during the disaster, holding them culpable for the deaths, is practically guaranteed to attract negative attention. This is especially true around people who may have been drinking. Most local shops do not sell the paper and a strong boycotting movement exists in the city to this day. Similarly, "Hillsborough chants" and related slurs cause deep anger and hostility among Liverpool FC fans, and could result in a violent response.
Be aware that the streetlighting (Urbis Evolo 2, shown on the right-hand side of the picture) is brighter than you might expect, and drive more cautiously. These streetlights are common across the city centre and in Kensington. Drive much more cautiously if you see them. These are less common outside of Liverpool. Americans may be used to bright lights, but Evolos are really bright.

Less than an hour away, Manchester holds a wealth of sights and attractions.
Go next[edit]
Chester - A beautiful historical city on the River Dee, which is famous for its Roman ruins and city walls. It is also the Gateway to North Wales and the delights of Llandudno and Snowdonia National Park.At the end of a branch at the end of the Merseyrail (metro) Wirral Line, trains taking 41 minutes from Liverpool Central.
Crosby - Just north of Liverpool with Anthony Gormley's Another Place famous sculptures on the beach.Merseyrail Northern Line takes 20 minutes from Liverpool Central to Blundellsands station.
Manchester – Once the home of the industrial revolution, it has now swapped its chimneys for skyscrapers, and mill workers for urbanite accountants and designers. It is also the home of the biggest rival of Liverpool FC, the second most successful football club in England, Manchester United FC. Well worth a visit and is easy to get to; hourly local trains from Lime Street run to Manchester Victoria taking 56 minutes, expresses to Victoria or to Oxford Road and Piccadilly taking 41. Also accessible by coach/bus.

Wirral[edit]
Birkenhead – Across the Mersey, Birkenhead has a football club called Tranmere Rovers. Although this club has always lived in the shadow of Everton and Liverpool, it has a long tradition and a great family atmosphere. Well worth a visit.Ferries ply across the Mersey from Pier Head to Birkenhead Woodside. It takes 3 minutes for a train to go from Liverpool James Street to Birkenhead Hamilton Square; Add 2 minutes for each additional stop if getting on earlier around the loop, & add 3 minutes for Birkenhead Central (shopping centre & Priory) or 7 for Tranmere Rovers' local station, Rock Ferry.
Port Sunlight -  It was built as a model village by Lord Lever and contains the Lady Lever Art Gallery, a marvelously eclectic collection of objects, similar to the Burrell Collection in Glasgow. Twenty minutes on the Wirral line.
West Kirby - Boasts a superb beach. There is also a 52-acre marine lake which has sailing and windsurfing. 36 minutes by Wirral line.
