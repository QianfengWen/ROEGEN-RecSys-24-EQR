Understand[edit]

Local roads provide access to Cap de Creus, the easternmost point of the Iberian peninsula, about 6 km away and the conservation area around it. The French border is about 20 km to the north. Prior to the explosive growth of beach tourism in Spain, Cadaqués was a sleepy fishing town, and some elements of this past exist to this day.

Get in[edit]

There are many local buses that go from Figueres to Cadaqués and even organized tours. You can also reach Cadaqués by bus from Barcelona. For those traveling on their own, it is easy to drive there from Figueres as well taking the C-68 in the direction of Roses and then following the signs to Cadaqués.

By train[edit]
There's no direct train connection to Cadaqués, but you can make the first part of your ride by train. From Barcelona, one way to reach Cadaqués is by train from the Plaza Catalunya, at the center of the city on the west point of Las Ramblas. From here, hop on a train heading North to Figueres, a journey that should last about an hour and a half. From the Figueres train station, walk straight out into the city and you'll see the bus station on your left. From here, you can hop on a bus to Cadaqués (which leave frequently), where you'll take an hour long journey up through the Catalonia hills and at last down into the beautiful sleepy town of Cadaqués.

By bus[edit]
The company Sarfa operates a daily service direct from Barcelona to Cadaqués. The timetable changes depending on the season. The buses leave from the North Station which is close to "Arc de Triomf" (and metro station) and is also within walking distance from the centre of the city (about 35 minutes walk). Beware holidays! The timetable is reduced considerably and you might have to wait 7 hours between the busses, especially if you want to leave Cadaqués and catch a plane. In this case you can take a taxi to Rosas and hop there on one of the more frequent buses.

By boat[edit]
It is possible to catch a ferry from the nearby town of Roses. During much of the year these ferries travel several times a day.

By car[edit]
Arriving by car is quite easy; there are several free parkings in the city. One of them is left side from the downtown when you arrive by car, close to the beach (open 09:00-20:00).

Get around[edit]

The city structure of Cadaqués is short and sweet, where shiny tiles lead travellers all through the city, from the bars and cantinas at the city center beachfront, to the hotels and private homes on the surrounding sides of the Cap de Creus peninsula. You can pretty much walk everywhere you want, but renting a vespa is nice option to explore the surrounding countryside.

By foot[edit]
Because of the geography surrounding the town of Cadaqués, the traditional way for the town people to travel was walking, by boat (rowing or sailing) or by "Tartana". It is still possible (and enjoyable) to walk to Cadaqués either from Roses or El Port de la Selva. From Roses there is a marked trail which follows the coast. The walk is approximately 15 km and passes several bays and beaches on the way. The walk is marked with small red and white painted marks which are located on rocks and signs.
