Crosshaven is a village in County Cork, at the point where the River Owenabue flows into Cork Harbour. It grew up from the 18th century when the harbour was fortified, becoming a garrison town for Fort Camden (which remained in British hands until 1938). Tourism developed when the railway arrived in 1904, and it also became a commuter town for Cork. However it was outgrown by Carrigaline 8 km west upriver, which is industrial but has accommodation and other facilities described on this page. In 1966 the Royal Cork Yacht Club, based in Cobh since 1720, relocated to Crosshaven and brought the Cork Week Regatta with it.
Crosshaven, which in 2016 had a population of 2577, in Irish is Bun an Tabhairne, thought to mean "mouth of the river Sabhrann". 


Get in[edit]
Bus Éireann 220X runs M-Sa hourly from Ovens and Ballincollig via UCC campus and Cork city centre to Carrigaline and Crosshaven, taking just under an hour from the city. The most central city stop is Grand Parade, a block south of Parnell St bus station, which the bus doesn't enter. On Sunday take the slower 220 which runs every 30 min.
By road from Cork follow R612 past Carrigaline, 19 km. The railway closed in 1932 and there are no plans to reinstate it. 
Visiting boats can moor at The Boatyard east of the inlet or Royal Cork Yacht Club west.
51.833-8.3221 Cork Ferry Terminal is at Ringaskiddy a few km north. In summer there are ferries from Roscoff and Santander.

Do[edit]
Cork Week Regatta
Piper's Funfair[dead link] (aka "The Merries") at 2 Point Rd is a timewarp kiddy funfair: dodgems, roundabouts, nothing white-knuckle. It's open daily 2:30-9PM.
La Scala in The Square is a games arcade.
Golf: there isn't a full-scale course nearby, but there'a Pitt and Putt by Crosshaven House, open daily. The military have blocked access to the course by Fort Templebreedy.
Beaches lie west of the village.
- 51.805-8.2781 Graball offers quiet, safe bathing in an atmosphere of faded grandeur.
- 51.795-8.282 Church Bay was primly divided in Victorian and Edwardian times into "The Men's Pool" and "Ladies Bay".
- 51.786-8.293 Fennel's Bay is further away and usually the quietest.
- 51.783-8.2954 Myrtleville is a popular spot in summer for its clear sands.
- 51.775-8.3115 Fountainstown is another sandy beach that can get crowded in summer.
Walk:
- upriver, west towards Carrigaline, R612 is flanked by a footpath and cycleway. This leads past the sheltered reach of river called "Drake's Pool", as Sir Francis Drake's ships supposedly hid there from a Spanish fleet in 1589. They did no such thing: Drake spent 1589 getting the English navy sunk in a disastrous expedition to Corunna.
- downriver, east to Fort Camden, where you view of harbour and fort from a grassy hillock. You can continue south along the rocky coast to Graball, Church Bay and Fennel's Bay, but the last section is a scramble and only uncovered at low tide. You can't continue along the coast inland as Fort Templebreedy is fenced off.
- however you can circle inland from Church Bay up a steep hill to the ruin of St Matthew's, and from there to Fennel's Bay and the hamlet of Myrtleville.
Cork Week is a sailing regatta held in July in even years, hosted by the Royal Cork Yacht Club.
