Downtown Sutton

Sutton is a town of 876 people (as of 2020) in West Virginia. It's located in Braxton County, which is known as "the Geographic Center of West Virginia". Sutton was first settled in 1792, and incorporated in 1860, having been named in honor of one of the early settlers. The area is noteworthy for its Civil War heritage, as well as the Braxton County Monster (aka the Phantom of Flatwoods), a green space alien with fiery red eyes and a pungent odor that reportedly frightened a group of local residents in September 1952 and remains one of the most famous creatures in UFO lore.
Sutton sits directly adjacent to Sutton Lake, regionally popular for outdoor recreation.

Downtown Gassaway
Sutton's twin town, the smaller town of Gassaway, population 769 is 2 miles west, on the other side of I-79. Flatwoods is a collection of mostly chain businesses adjacent to I-79, about 5 miles north of the town.  
The Sutton area, including Gassaway and Flatwoods, is a major highway stop along I-79 in West Virginia, sitting at roughly the halfway point between Charleston to the south and Clarksburg to the north, and it is the last town with significant highway services before or after a more than 40-minute drive southwest on I-79 through a very rural area with sparse population and few services before beginning to enter the Charleston metropolitan area. 
The proximity of the Sutton area to the Charleston area, as well being partway between it and the Morgantown-Fairmont-Clarksburg area makes it a popular day or weekend trip from these larger towns.
