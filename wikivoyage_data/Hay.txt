Hay is a rural town of about 3000 people, with several motels and many country pubs, at the intersection of three major highways on the main route from Sydney to Adelaide, making it a good place for a stop on a long road trip. The Hay tourism board maintain a useful website , which provides good information about accommodation, directions and activities in Hay.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Aboriginal communities in the western Riverina were traditionally concentrated in the more habitable river corridors and amongst the reedbeds of the region. The district surrounding Hay was occupied by at least three separate Aboriginal groups at the time of European settler expansion onto their lands.  The area around the present township appears to have been a site of interaction between the Nari-Nari people of the Lower Murrumbidgee and the Wiradjuri who inhabited a vast region in the central-western inland of New South Wales.
In late 1829 Charles Sturt and his men passed along the Murrumbidgee River on horses and drays. They launched their whale-boat near the Murrumbidgee-Lachlan junction and continued the journey by boat to the Murray River and eventually to the sea at Lake Alexandrina (before returning by the same route). During the late-1830s stock was regularly overlanded to South Australia via the Lower Murrumbidgee.  At the same time stockholders were edging westward along and the Lachlan, Murrumbidgee, Billabong and Murray systems. By 1839 all of the river frontages in the vicinity of present-day Hay were occupied by squatters. By the mid-1850s pastoral runs in the western Riverina were well-established and prosperous. The nearby Victorian gold-rushes provided an expanding market for stock. The prime fattening country of the Riverina became a sort of holding centre, from where the Victorian market could be supplied as required.  One of the popular routes established in the mid-1850s crossed the Murrumbidgee River at Lang's Crossing-place.

Landscape[edit]
The landscape is mostly flat, with very few hills, with the Murrumbidgee river running through the middle of it.

Flora and fauna[edit]
Mostly dry arid types of flora with mainly emus here, but there are also some roos that live here as well.

Climate[edit]
It's usually hot during the day, and cold during the night, just like any outback town.
