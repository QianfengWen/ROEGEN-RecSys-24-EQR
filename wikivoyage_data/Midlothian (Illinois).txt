History[edit]
Like many suburbs of Chicago in the 1800s and early 1900s, the area now known as Midlothian began with just a few local farmers who were surrounded by large and small endeavors alike. Once the industrial age began, however, the Midlothian community started to grow exponentially. By 1927, the Village of Midlothian was incorporated, and in 1949 a village hall was constructed at the intersection of 148th and Pulaski roads.
