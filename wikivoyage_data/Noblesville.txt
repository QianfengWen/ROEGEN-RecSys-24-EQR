The oldest decoys ever found were Canvasbacks made from reeds and feathers and date back over 1400 years ago. Over the centuries decoys evolved into wooden carvings. Each decoy carver developed his own distinct style. While the decoys are not used for hunting, they are American folk art and we carve them with craftsmanship and pride, one of a kind, one at a time. No two Bundy Decoys are alike, which is partly why they are so collectable. The one you purchase will be one of a kind.
