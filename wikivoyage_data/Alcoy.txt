Alcoy (Valencian: Alcoi) is an industrial city in Alicante province of the Valencian Community of 59,000 people (2018). It is best known for its large Moros i Cristians (Moors and Christians) festival.


Understand[edit]
Alcoy has been inhabited since prehistoric times. The name's etymology is unclear, but is believed to derive either from Arabic (al-Qawi – the fort/village) or from Latin (Arabic article al + Latin cola – cultivator/inhabitant). The town in its current incarnation was formally established after the Christian reconquista in 1256, and was the setting for repeated Arab revolts. The last of these was suppressed in 1276 and is still commemorated today in the city's annual Moors and Christians festival.
In the mid-19th century the city became heavily industrialized; most architecture in the centre dates from this period. Today the city  is a regional commercial and financial centre.

Festivals[edit]
Moros i Cristians in Plaça d'Espanya
 Moros i Cristians (Moros y Cristianos / Moors and Christians). Usually 21-24 April; dates may vary depending on Easter. Alcoy hosts the largest and possibly the most elaborate of the annual Moors and Christians festivals, listed as a festival of 'International Tourist Interest'. Celebrated since the early 16th century, it reenacts the Battle of Alcoy of 1276 during the Muslim insurrection against the Christian reconquista. According to legend, St. George appeared on a horse on the city walls during the battle and thereby turned the tide against the rebels, resulting in the death of the Moorish commander Al-Azraq.The celebration commences with a marching band parade on the evening of the 21st. The Día de las Entradas ('Day of Entrances') is devoted to parades, starting with the Christian parade in the morning and the Moorish parade in the late afternoon. The following day, Día de San Jorge ('St. George's Day') is more solemn, with a morning religious procession, high mass, and an evening parade. The battle takes place on the final day, the Día de Alardo ('Alardo's Day'), first with a verbal exchange between the Moorish and Christian ambassadors, and then with arquebuses (muskets), each side retaking in turn the castle in the 38.69794-0.473071 Plaça d'Espanya. The appearance of St. George in the evening brings the battle to a close. A full schedule and parade route map is available for download from the tourist office.   (updated Nov 2017)
