Red Rock is a scenic township of about 900 people (2021) on the shores of Lake Superior in Northern Ontario. A good spot for outdoor enthusiasts, its rugged cliffs and the Nipigon Bay waters provide opportunities for hunting, fishing, canoeing, kayaking, snowmobiling, and skiing.


Understand[edit]
Red Rock
Red Rock's main source of employment was a paper mill, but it shut down in the early 2000s, leaving many locals without work.

History[edit]
In the 1930s the townsite was carved from the forest at the edge of the lake.
The township was named for the large cuesta (hill or ridge with a gentle slope on one side, and a steep slope on the other) on Hwy 17 between Red Rock and Nipigon.
During the Second World War, a prisoner of war camp was established here housing primarily German prisoners. 48 bunkhouses, that previously housed construction workers at Lake Sulphite Pulp and Paper company, became the home to 1145 German prisoners for eighteen months.
Not all prisoners at the camp were members of the German military, there were also merchant seamen and several German Jews. This diverse group included Nazis and anti-Nazis. The integration of people with opposite view points cause tension and often led to physical fights.
