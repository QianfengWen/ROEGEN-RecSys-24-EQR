Hoensbroek is a town in South Limburg, the southernmost region of the Dutch province of Limburg. It's part of the municipality of Heerlen but has a long, separate history and was an independent municipality until 1982. Hoensbroek's castle is one the most well-known castles in the country. Since there isn't much more to see or do for the average traveler, Hoensbroek castle is best visited as a day trip from one of the many destinations in the area. However, if you do find yourself staying the night here, there are a few options to eat, drink and sleep.


Understand[edit]
With over 20.000 inhabitants, Hoensbroek is a major part of Heerlen. Rather than being a district of that city, it's a town on itself and its people will tell you they live in Hoensbroek, not in Heerlen. Nevertheless, for outsiders it's somewhat hard to distinguish, as the two have grown together as one large built-up area.

Get around[edit]
The impressive castle makes a great background for the annual sand sculpture festival
Hoensbroek's center is not very large and you can get around on foot or by bike. However, since the town has limited tourist attractions apart from the castle, it's convenient to have a car at hand to explore sights in nearby towns. There's a good bus network operated by Veolia in case you're headed for the outer parts of the town.

See[edit]
50.917015.917451 Hoensbroek Castle (Kasteel Hoensbroek), Klinkertstraat 118, ☏ +31 45-522 72 72. One of the largest castle's in the Netherlands, Kasteel Hoensbroek with its towers and water-filled moat is an impressive sight. Although records exist of an even earlier stronghold on the site, the oldest parts of the current building date back to the mid 13th century. It was Sir Herman Hoen who became the towns first lord (in 1388) and gave the castle its name. Once a prominent stronghold on the busy travel roads between the northern regions of Brabant and the more southers cities of Maastricht, Aachen and Cologne, it is now a great museum where you can walk through the castle halls as they were in the 17th and 18th century. There are guided tours and workshops, including sword fighting, perfume making and shepherding sheep. Large and small events are organized regularly in and around the castle, previously including sand sculpture and knight festivals.   (updated Nov 2021)
Do[edit]
 Zwemparadijs Otterveurdt, Gravin von Schönbornlaan 2, ☏ +31 45-523 2626. Closed on Mondays. This local swimming pool isn't state of the art nor very large, but it's a fine place for a few hours in the water, especially with children. In summer, there's an outdoor pool and sun bathing field too. 
Buy[edit]
Hoensbroek's town centre has a range of shops and supermarkets, but they clearly cater to daily needs of locals. Don't expect too much in the sense of shopping for fun, as there are only a few gift and speciality shops. While you're better of in Heerlen or Maastricht for a shopping spree, there are a dozen or so clothing stores and several drug stores. Most shops close on Sundays, although the Albert Heijn supermarket (Kouvenderstraat 100) is open from 10.00-18.00h.
