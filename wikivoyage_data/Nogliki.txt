Nogliki (Russian: Но́глики NOH-glee-kee) is a city in on the island of Sakhalin in Russian Far East, roughly 2/3 up the island. The name is a canny reference to the booming oil business here as it's derived from the indigenous Nivkh word noghl-vo which means 'smelling-village'. Around 10,000 people live here, and as the intro might suggest - it's one of the main population centers for the Nivkh tribe.


Get in[edit]
Nogliki Airport (Аэропорт Ноглики,ICAO:UHSN) for years a rough airstrip, now has a 1750-m paved runway and a fancy terminal building - made possible by a multi-million dollar investment from the oil industry.  Chartered flights with a Dash-8 to Yuzno-Sakhalinsk and occasionally Khabarovsk for the oil companies,  may allow you to secure a spot on the 5-10 seats usually left for regular passengers.
Nogliki Railway station (Ноглики вокзал) 613 kilometers north of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk has a daily nighttrain arriving from Yuzhno at 10:45, returning south again at 18:20, the journey takes just over 13 hours, and stops in Tymovsk on the way for bus connections to Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky. A 6-wheeled bus connects with the train to take you 250 km up a grueling dirt road to Okha in the far north of the island.
Get around[edit]
