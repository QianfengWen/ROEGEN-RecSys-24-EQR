Warrington is an industrial town in Cheshire, with a population in 2020 of 172,330. Motorway traffic scoots by and you're only likely to stop here for business, or to watch a rugby league match.  


Understand[edit]
Brian Bevan, rugby league star of the 1950s
The Wærings were Saxons, so the place they lived was called Weringtun. It was the lowest place you could wade across the Mersey, and for centuries people hoisted their cloaks and tunics to do so. The ford was a mile upstream from the present town centre, so the medieval settlement lay east around St Elphin's church, and a bridge was first documented in 1285. It was a quiet market town until the 17th century. Then the Mersey was made navigable, and the Industrial Revolution powered the growth of Liverpool, Manchester and the corridor between. The Manchester Ship Canal opened in 1894 and enabled large freight vessels to sail 40 miles inland. Warrington developed through textiles and metal-bashing, especially the production of metal wire. It also had military facilities to the east around Risley and Birchwood, such as an RAF base and a munitions factory, best not sited next to residential areas. 
This industrial corridor developed professional sports clubs in the 19th century, and Warrington was part of the faction that broke away from the rugby union in 1895. They did so for the right to recompense players for time and wages lost from regular jobs in mills and collieries and foundries. These clubs became the Rugby League, and Warrington have always played in the top tier - they're called "The Wire" for the town trade. The game in England remains concentrated in the northern industrial cities, but was successfully exported especially to Australia. In 1947 Australia returned the favour when Brian Bevan of Sydney NSW signed for the town club, and scored tries prolifically for the next 13 years.
The Mersey was the historic boundary between Lancashire and Cheshire, so Warrington north of the river was in Lancashire until 1975. Local government changes then risked making it an exclave, a detached part of the county, so it needed a new governance tier to relate to. "Anywhere except Liverpool! Not with those dreadful scallies!" was the popular verdict, so it was assigned to Cheshire — this is nominal, since the town is nowadays a free-standing metropolis. It's a typical post-industrial place, with retail parks populating former factories, and much brownfield. A good start has been made by re-greening along the river and canal, and to the east around Risley, but it's a work in progress.
Local information is available from Warrington Council.
