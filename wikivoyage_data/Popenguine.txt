Popenguine is a village in the Cap Vert-Thies region of Senegal. It is known for its natural reserve, pristine sandy beach, and religious significance.

This small village on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean is located just 70 km south of Dakar on the Petit Cote. Popenguine is a member of Global Ecovillage Network of Senegal (GENSEN). It is the weekend getaway for the President of Senegal, as the second presidential residence is located between Popenguine and the village of Ndayane.
The Natural Reserve of Popenguine is located to the south and was created in 1986 thanks in large part to the local women's group, RFPPN. It is the first and only reserve managed by the Park Service in partnership with the local women’s group. The woman’s group had the foresight to ensure the protection of the natural habitat before it could be destroyed by the locals in their search for wood for cooking. Through their efforts, the women were able to protect 1500 ha (2493 acres) of the park in which a variety of plants, birds,and other animal species have been able to thrive. Due to their hard work, the Reserve is now the major draw for tourists.
Popenguine is also known for the sighting of the Black Madonna in the reserve. Due to this appearance, an annual pilgrimage to Popenguine takes place in which all the Christians in Senegal and nearby countries visit. The pilgrimage usually takes place around May/June for any tourists who are interested in witnessing this event.
Over the years, Popenguine has become a very cosmopolitan village. Popenguine is home to a famous Senegalese film director, a local artist (Gade Diouf - Artist's Website), a Ghanaian author, and Ex-patriots from a variety of countries. Due to the uniqueness of the village, it has come to have all the amenities of a big city while still maintaining the charm and peacefulness of a small village.
Popenguine is one of the few tourist villages in which the tourists are not constantly harassed by the locals. You will rarely hear the locals asking you to give them money, water, or food. You will also rarely hear them call you "toubab" (white man). They will actually take the time to greet you and ask for your name. Senegal is the nation of Teranga (hospitality), and the citizens of Popenguine will ensure that tourist will leave believing it to be so.
The dominant ethnic group in this region is Sereer. The most prevalent languages heard in the village are Wolof, Sereer Safin, and French. There are a few locals who speak English as well.

This time of year is characterized relatively with little rainfall, low humidity and mild temperatures. Temperatures range in the mid to high seventies during this time. During this period, the migratory birds of Europe come to Senegal for nesting giving the tourist the perfect opportunity for bird observation. The months of June through October see increased rainfall rising temperatures peaking around August through October.

Stay safe[edit]
Popenguine is a relatively safe and secure place because it's a pretty small village in which everyone knows each other. However, crime against tourists in towns such as Mbour, and Saly is common. Use common sense everywhere in Senegal: keep a close eye on your belongings, watch your pockets in crowded places, women should not walk around alone after dark, try not to wear any outwardly expensive items of clothing or jewelry. There are many different scams to get money from tourists, so be wary. Overall, though, the Senegalese are an incredibly friendly and hospitable people and you will meet many people who are genuinely interested in just talking to you and making sure you are having an enjoyable time in Senegal.
In case of emergency, there is a police station and a hospital located in Popenguine.

Respect[edit]
The Senegalese are a very friendly and hospitable group of people. In order to continue receiving their hospital, please follow the actions listed below.

Always greet and ask how their day is going (and if you would like to learn basic Wolof greetings, please visit the PC Wiki page; the link is on the bottom of this page)
Never use your left hand to shake hands or give something to someone. By doing so, you would be showing a lack of respect towards the locals.
Never tell a Senegalese that he/she is lying even if they are
Always ask for permission before taking pictures of the locals
As a tourist, you will be asked by many people to give out money, and even if you want to, Please do not give out money! By giving the locals money, you would be making the locals dependent on foreign aid instead of them working for themselves for their own livelihood. The reason the locals in Senegal always ask tourists for money is because the tourists had done so in the past. In order to break the cycle, tourists should stop giving out money.
If you really want to donate something to the community, please go to the local schools and give school supplies to the principal who will then distribute the supplies appropriately.

Go next[edit]
Day trip options include Saly, Toubab Dialaw, or Mbour which have plenty of activities for tourists:

Saly is a large beach resort town about 15 km south of Popenguine. There the tourist can find many water, beach, and land activities to keep them entertained.
Toubab Dialaw is a coastal village 7 km north of Popenguine. It has a beautiful beach and lagoon to keep the beach and nature enthusiast happy
Mbour is a large coastal town about 20 km south of Popenguine. Mbour has a large traditional market in which the tourists can purchase anything from food to cloth. Mbour also has an artisanal village in which the tourists can purchase his/her souvenirs. (Bargaining is a must here. As a good rule of thumb, don't pay more than 1/2 of the initial price given to you by the vendor.)
