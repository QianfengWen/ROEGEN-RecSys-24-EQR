Acaxochitlán is an ancient and timeless small town in the mountains of Central Mexico's state of Hidalgo. The town's original settlers were the Tula and Teotihuacan peoples who pre-dated the Aztecs who dominated the region long before the Spanish conquest. As one of Mexico's Pueblos Magicos, it is a popular weekend destination for romantic couples enjoying small-town hospitality and for naturalists exploring the misty mountains and forests that surround the town.
