East Rutherford is a borough in Bergen County which is in the northeast part of New Jersey. Formerly known as the township of Boiling Springs, East Rutherford was renamed on May 23, 1893 when it was purchased by the Borough officers of the East Rutherford Borough. There was no change in the territory, only in the government and name. East Rutherford holds a population of approximately 10,000 residents. The small town occupies approximately 3.9 square miles and also houses hundreds of businesses and restaurants. It is still somewhat overshadowed by MetLife Stadium, home to the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets as well as a venue for various concerts and events.


Get in[edit]
By car[edit]

Do[edit]
 New York Giants. One of the oldest teams in the NFL, the Giants have amassed four NFL titles before the introduction of the Super Bowl, as well as four Super Bowls, including 2007 and 2011 with Eli Manning under Center defeating Tom Brady and the New England Patriots. While some New Yorkers still resent their "abandoning" the city for greener pastures (or meadows) in New Jersey, their on-field success has endeared them to many people in the area, even though their regular season play can be mediocre at times. If they make it to the post-season all bets are off and upsets are a bit of a specialty for the modern era Giants. regular season tickets starting from $120. (updated Nov 2015)
 New York Jets. The other New York football team are the most successful "challenger" to the Giants for the hearts and minds of New Yorkers. While they were a charter member of the upstart AFL under the name "Titans" (Titans being bigger than Giants and all that) and the first AFL team to beat an NFL team in the Super Bowl, they have since failed to return to the big game and often play second fiddle to the Giants. The fact that they share a common home stadium may not have helped in that. (updated Nov 2015)
