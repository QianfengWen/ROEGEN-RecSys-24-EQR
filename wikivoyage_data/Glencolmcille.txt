Glencolmcille is a straggle of villages on the northwest coast of County Donegal, with a population of 217 in 2016. The main settlement is also called Cashel, indicating its cluster of prehistoric and early Christian ritual sites. The lane then meanders through Malin More to end at Malin Beg. Also described on this page are other sights and amenities on the road out to this peninsula, such as Killybegs and Teelin. 
Glencolmcille means "the valley of St Colmcille", better known outside Ireland as St Columba (521-597). He was born and grew up around Donegal, studied on the east coast, then after a dispute fled to Scotland where he founded the monastery at Iona and many others. He later returned to establish churches in Ireland - there's no firm evidence he was here, but he got around by sea and this particular legend is credible. 


Get in[edit]

For intercity routes see Donegal Town. Local Link Bus 293 runs five times daily from Donegal Town via Mountcharles, Killybegs, Kilcar and Carrick to 54.708-8.7291 Glencolmcille and Malinmore, 75 min.
McGeehan Coach 991 runs once M-Sa afternoon plus in college term on Sunday from Letterkenny to Fintown, Glenties, Ardara, Killybegs, Kilcar, Carrick and Glencolmcille (2 hours 10 min). The morning bus turns back at Killybegs and the service beyond is only drop-off with no return run, so to go back to Letterkenny take the 293 to Killybegs then the 991.
By road from Donegal Town follow N56 west then R263 through Killybegs and twisting and turning over the hills, if the sheep can be bothered to shift their fat ovine backsides off the road. From Derry or Letterkenny you could go via Donegal Town or go cross-country on R250 to Ardara, then the scenic R230 via Ghleann Gheis.

Get around[edit]
You need wheels to explore this scattered area.

See[edit]
St Columba's Church (C of I) was built in 1828. There's a 10 m stone set into the west wall of the graveyard which was probably part of a court tomb (like Cloghanmore, below) then was used for monastic buildings. There's also scraps of an 8th century souterrain. The east side of the graveyard is Catholic, with an intricately carved pillar, now broken. 100 m west of the church is a 1.85 m stone pillar inscribed with a cross.
Farranmacbride 400 m north of the church is another ruined court tomb - it was used as a livestock pen - and has a decorated perforated standing stone 2 m tall. Through the perforation, heaven may be glimpsed by the pure and devout; needless to say there have been no recent credible sightings.
54.707-8.7441 Glencolmcille Folk Village, Glencolmcille (on R263), ☏ +353 74 973 0017. Daily Apr-Sept 10:00-18:00, Oct 10:00-16:30. Small but impressive outdoor folk museum, with 18th-20th century schoolhouse, fisherman's dwelling, pub-cum-village store and other cottages. Adult €6.50, conc €5.50, child €3. (updated Aug 2021)
54.689-8.7462 Cloghanmore is a megalithic court tomb: these were mostly constructed around 3500 BC but re-used for much later burials. It's aligned east-west so the mid-winter sun peaks over the mountains to shine into its chambers. Reach it up the lane L1025 that branches inland from Malinmore.
54.665-8.7783 Malin Beg is the small village where the road ends at Silver Strand / An Trá Bhán. Steps lead down to the scenic horseshoe of a cove (no boat ramp); the sea-stack at its west end is popular for rock-climbing. The Uaig is the next inlet west, small and rocky with a fishing pier. Temple Cavan is the scrappy ruin of a medieval church to St Kevin, looking like a derelict cow shed.
54.664-8.8334 Rathlin O'Birne or Reachlainn Uí Bhirn is the small island seen 2 km off Malin Beg, uninhabited since the lighthouse was automated. It's a popular area for sea-angling, and you're permitted to land, but these waters are hazardous. In June 2017 some anglers were lucky to be rescued when their Rib ran out of fuel near the island. A month later they did the same again, only this time their bodies were found by the lifeboat.
Cottage at the Folk Museum
54.632-8.6465 Teelin or Teileann is a small fishing village. It has accommodation and you come this way for Slieve League.
54.628-8.6846 Slieve League or Sliabh Liag is a mountain of 596 m / 1955 ft, with its south face etched into great sea-cliffs. The usual viewing point is Bunglass: branch off R263 into Teelin. Sept-June you can drive up the narrow lane to the free car park, hoping you don't meet a campervan coming the other way, then it's an easy paved walk of 1 km. July-Aug the lane is closed to visitor cars, you have to park in Teelin and take a shuttle bus (€6). Tourist guides will bend your ear about how much higher these are than the  Cliffs of Moher, but they're sloping not sheer. South across the bay is Sligo's Ben Bulben. Trails lead to the summit of Slieve League: One Man's Pass and Pilgrim's Path will get your attention as they teeter along the sharp ridge with the wind blasting up off the cliff face.
54.637-8.4457 Killybegs is the village near the turn-off from N56 onto R263, so it might be your first or last stop on the way to Glencolmcille. It has the best harbour on this rugged coast and is an active fishing port. Outside St Mary's Church is the elaborate 16th century grave slab of Niall Mór Mac Suibhne or MacSweeney, depicting a chain-mailed warrior and grappling wrestlers. The carpet weaving factory closed in 2003; it was turned into a heritage centre but that too has closed. There's a sprinkling of B&Bs, see Sleep, so you could base here and day-trip further west.
Do[edit]
Standing stone by St Columba's Church
“And whereas the superstitions of Popery are greatly increased and upheld, by the pretended sanctity of places, especially of a Place called St. Patrick’s Purgatory in the County of Donegal and of Wells to which Pilgrimages are made, by vast numbers at certain seasons . . . Be it further enacted that all such meetings and assemblies shall be deemed and adjudged Riots and unlawful Assemblies.”
- Proclamation of Queen Anne in 1703
