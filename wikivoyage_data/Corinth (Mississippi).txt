 Verandah/Curlee House Museum, 705 Jackson Street, ☏ +1 662 287-9501, toll-free: +1-800-748-9048. Tours by appointment. Completed in the spring of 1857, the Verandah House was built for one of the two founders of Corinth, Hamilton Mask. The house is a significant example of Greek Revival architecture. As a result of the crossroads of the two standard-gauge railroads in Corinth, the area became of prime importance to both the Union and Confederacy. On the evening of April 2, 1862, Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston met with Gen. Braxton Bragg in his bedchambers at the Verandah House to sign Order No. 8 to launch the Confederate counter-offensive against the Union army that ended in the Battle of Shiloh, April 6–7, 1862. Throughout the war, generals from the Confederacy and the Union were quartered in this house. Following the war, the Corinth Female Academy occupied the house for a short period of time. It was then purchased by the William Peyton Curlee, one of the founders of the Curlee Clothing Company. After Mr. Curlee’s death of yellow fever, Mrs. Curlee, a descendent of Daniel Boone, sold the house to the Leroy Montgomery, who raised a large family in the home. In 1921, Shelby Hammond Curlee, oldest son of the previous Curlee owners, bought the house. The descendants of the Curlee family donated the house to the city in 1961.

 Corinth Contraband Camp, 902 North Parkway, ☏ +1 662 287-9273. Open dawn to dusk. Many African Americans who fled Southern plantations and farms seeking freedom and protection found the Union-occupied Corinth to be a secure location. Union General Grenville Dodge understood what effect the defection of thousands of African Americans would have on the Confederate War effort. He began to enlist the escaped slaves who came into his lines as teamsters, cooks, and laborers. He actively recruited male refugees, armed them, and placed them in charge of security at the newly organized contraband camp in Corinth. Dodge’s refugee administrative efforts led to the formation of the 1st Alabama Infantry Regiment of African Descent, consisting of approximately 1,000 men. Under the supervision of Chaplain James M. Alexander of the 66th Illinois Volunteer Infantry, the Corinth camp resembled a small town, complete with a church, commissary, hospital, both frame and log houses, and a street grid with named streets and numbered houses. An American Missionary Association School operated where eager students of all ages sought knowledge day and night. Today, a portion of this camp has been set aside to commemorate the events which changed the lives of so many people. Bronze figures surround the trail through the camp depicting the lives of these people considered “contraband” of war. Free.
