For other places with the same name, see Hobart (disambiguation).

Hobart is the capital city of Tasmania and is Australia's second oldest city, after Sydney. Hobart sits along the Derwent River and began humbly as a penal colony. Hobart is now a small and intimate city with a population of around 247,000 (as of 2020) in the Greater Hobart area. The city is renowned for its many historic buildings, including the famous Salamanca Place, and is the gateway to Southern Tasmania.  Hobart played a major role during the heroic age of Antarctic exploration and is one of the five gateway cities to Antarctica.

History[edit]
Founded in 1804 by Colonel David Collins, Hobart is the second oldest city in Australia. It grew out of the penal settlement on the island at Risdon Cove, 8 km upriver, which was founded in 1803 and abandoned five months later for the present site of Hobart.
In the first half of the 1800s, the whaling boom generated a surge in maritime support industries and infrastructure. Whaling ceased in the late 1800s, but Hobart never lost its boat-building, ship-chandlery and provedoring legacy. This made Hobart a logical staging post in the heroic age of Antarctic exploration. France’s Dumont d’Urville, Australia’s Douglas Mawson, England’s James Clark Ross, and Norway’s Carsten Borchgrevink and Roald Amundsen all paused in the Derwent on their way to Antarctica.
In December 1911, the Australasian Antarctic Expedition led by Mawson was given a rousing send-off from Hobart’s Sullivans Cove.  A few months later, Amundsen brought Fram into Hobart in order to send a telegram to the King of Norway with the news that his party had reached the South Pole. After sending the telegram, Amundsen publicly announced his feat from the Hobart General Post Office sandstone steps. A few months later, Mawson’s Antarctic party sent the first wireless messages from Antarctica to the outside world – to a receiving station on Hobart’s Queens Domain.

Hobart has a mild temperate oceanic climate owing to its fairly southerly latitude (42.88°S) and proximity to the Southern Ocean. As such, daily temperatures rarely reach above the low 20s, except during heat waves in summer. Nightly lows typically range around 10-12°C during summer and 4-5°C in winter, so cold weather gear is recommended all year round. It is not unheard of for temperatures to drop below zero during winter, with Hobart's lowest temperature on record being a chilly -2.8°C. Interestingly, Hobart has the second fewest daily hours of sunlight out of all Australian cities, at 5.9 hours on average for the year. However, during the summer it has the most hours of daylight of any Australian city, with 15.2 hours on the summer solstice.
Rainfall is fairly similar year round, averaging 50 mm per month, occurring around 15 days a month during winter and 10 days a month during summer. Despite the cold weather and occasional rainfall you should not expect to see any snow within Hobart, although it is not unheard of. The city receives snowfall at sea level on average only once every 15 years, caused by cold masses arriving from Antarctica. More often, some outlying suburbs of Hobart at higher elevation can receive snowfall. The nearby Mount Wellington is often seen snowcapped during winter, and its temperatures are much colder than Hobart — typically 10 degrees colder and easily reaching below zero during winter.

Ground transportation options from Hobart Airport include an airport shuttle operated by SkyBus which meets every arriving flight and serves most accommodation within Hobart. Reservations are not necessary for Hobart bound trips on this shuttle, but are required for the return leg to the airport. A ticket costs $22/38 for adults and $19/35 for children or pensioners for one-way/return trips respectively. Those wanting a faster or more direct option should consider taking a taxi. Depending on traffic the journey should take around 20-25 minutes and cost approximately $38-45. Car rental is also available at Hobart Airport with rental companies including Avis, Bargain Car Rentals, Budget, Europcar, Hertz, Red Spot and Thrifty. All of the car rental offices are just past the arrivals gates on the way to the exit
Hobart has a small airport for the volume of passenger traffic it often accommodates. You'll have no problem finding the cafes, bars, and bookshops that are mandatory airport fare, and a souvenir shop. On the positive side you can expect to get your luggage quickly through onto the conveyor. On the negative side, there isn't enough seating in the departure lounge for a few full flights departing simultaneously. You'll still be walking across the tarmac to get on your flight.

By car[edit]
Hobart can be easily reached from all other cities and towns in Tasmania by car. Driving from Launceston via National Highway 1 takes around 2.5 hrs with car hire available from the airport or in Launceston itself. You can also take a car from mainland Australia via Devonport, with a ferry departing nightly from Melbourne. The journey from Devonport takes around 4 hrs.

By boat[edit]
Hobart offers a beautiful deep-water port with cruise ship berths in the heart of the historic Salamanca area of the city.  Large cruise ships dock at Macquarie Wharf.  Volunteer greeters meet the cruise ships, answer questions, and point the way. The immediate area, which includes Constitution and Victoria Docks, offers shopping for art, crafts, clothing and souvenirs; light snacks and food; fishing boats; a yacht basin; and the maritime museum.

Hobart is perhaps the most car-centric capital city in Australia. The only form of public transport it has is its BRT and its inefficient ferries. There are only two bridges in Hobart crossing the Derwent River (Tasman and Bowen Bridges), and both these bridges can get congested during peak hours. You are best off using a car to get around the city, though it may be much easier to explore the CBD on foot.

On foot[edit]
Walking is the best way to explore the downtown area.  It is easy to walk between the city centre, Salamanca, and the port/harbour area.  If you are staying in the Salamanca area, you may not need any other form of transport.  Between the City Centre and Sandy Bay via Battery Point is only half an hour to walk (although there are some hills).

By bus[edit]
Hobart has a sufficient public bus system. The main interchange is in front of the GPO (General Post Office). Ticket prices depend on the distance and start slightly above a dollar.  Services are considerably less frequent on Sundays.  Timetables are all available online from the MetroTas website.

By bicycle[edit]
Hobart is hilly any which way you choose to head, so bike riders should be prepared for hills.  There is a poorly developed network of off-road cyclepaths, but Hobart drivers tend to be tolerant of cyclists, and most roads tend to be wide enough to accommodate them.  One old railway line from the city as far as Claremont has been converted to a first-class cycle and walking path (take care from motor vehicles at intersections).

By car[edit]
The Southern Outlet is one of the three freeways in and around Hobart
Hobart is the favourite launching off point for visitors keen to explore other areas of Tasmania. A car is certainly the best and most convenient way of getting to the more rural and scenic spots.  As most domestic travellers arrive by plane, there are plenty of options for car hires at Hobart Airport.
Roads west of the Derwent River are generally not congested, although you can expect to pay for parking in the city areas. Hobart City Council operates an app that can be used to pay for car parking. Avoid driving in the Salamanca area on a Saturday, due to road closures and traffic snarls due to the markets.

By boat[edit]
A public ferry operates in the mornings and afternoons from Hobart waterfront to Bellerive pier. Numerous ferries, sightseeing harbour cruises and a water taxi service also operate from the Hobart docks (Brooke St Pier) to outlying attractions including MONA at Berriedale. Some of these include dining on board, while others may terminate at a site with a restaurant such as Peppermint Bay and MONA.

Buildings and landmarks[edit]
As one of Australia's oldest cities, Hobart is home to a multitude of historical buildings that often showcase splendid examples of Georgian and Victorian architecture. In fact, over 90 buildings within Hobart are classified by the National Trust, with around 60 of them along Macquarie St and Davey St alone. Many, but not all, of the historical buildings are located within or near Hobart's Central Business District (CBD) or around Battery Point.

The guns were eventually removed for fear the residential homes would come under fire in the event of an invasion. Thanks to a green ban in the 1970s, most of Battery Points original Georgian architecture remains intact, and today it is still home to one of Australia's oldest subdivisions and few planned circus', Arthur Circus. If you venture deep within Battery Point, you may stumble upon -42.89202147.330662 Nanny Goat Lane, a well-known steep laneway with superb views of the suburbs at the top and a whimsical sign to match its odd name.

Museums and art galleries[edit]
One of Hobart's biggest cultural drawcards is the multitude of museums and art galleries that are dotted around the city. Many of the exhibits, particularly in the museums, have a distinct Antarctic theme, a result of Hobart's long history of being a Gateway City to East Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. The Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) is among the best museums in Australia has and has fast become a Hobart icon.

Hobart is a good base for exploring Southern Tasmania and a great starting point if you plan to explore the rest of Tasmania. Many nearby destinations are close enough to allow for a day trip from Hobart or even a few days away if you wish.

Casey station from the air
Bruny Island — Actually two islands connected by a narrow isthmus. Bruny has much to explore from its amazing food and produce to spectacular scenery and lookouts. If you are lucky and hang around until dusk you may spot Little Penguins as they plod from the ocean to their nests at the isthmus.
Freycinet National Park — On the east coast and home to the famous Wineglass Bay, previously voted one of the top 10 beaches in the world. The rugged natural beauty of Freycinet is spectacular and there are various scenic drives or walks you can take to soak it all up.
Huon Trail — An expansive region to the south-west of Hobart, incorporating the D'Entrecasteaux Channel and Huon Valley. Huonville is one of the main towns in this area although there is plenty more to explore in this region. If you continue far south you will reach Cockle Creek, the southernmost point you can drive to in Australia. It's best to take a car to explore the Huon.
Mount Field National Park — A small, yet impressive National Park just over an Hour north-west of Hobart. The park is home to Russell Falls, one of Tasmania's finest waterfalls, and in winter you can ski down the slopes at Mt Mawson. Stop off at New Norfolk along the way to explore the charm of this small town.
Port Arthur — A former convict settlement on the Tasman Peninsula that is steeped in history. A popular day trip from Hobart, there is much to explore on the whole peninsula including Tasman National Park, which is brimming with spectacular views and natural rock formations.
Richmond — A quaint little town less than 30 minutes north-east from Hobart. The town is home to the oldest bridge in Australia and Australia's oldest intact prison. On the way you can eat and drink your way to Richmond by visiting some of the wineries dotted along the road.
