Ben Hill County Courthouse
Fitzgerald is a small town in Georgia's Plantation Midlands region, and is the (get this) center of the Fitzgerald Micropolitan Area. It was founded in 1895 by former Union Army drummer boy Philander H. Fitzgerald on behalf of Union Civil War veterans, leading to the nickname The Colony City. You'll see the Civil War history in the street signs: Union generals on the east, Confederates on the west, and at the Blue & Gray Museum. More importantly, though, tropical jungle chickens.

Get around[edit]
A Red Junglefowl relation (back in India)
See[edit]
Wandering around town, keep an eye out for Red Junglefowl, a tropical pheasant from India or Burma or somewhere that looks an awful lot like a chicken, several of which were introduced for reasons well-masked by a Fitzgerald sense of humor. They have fled the boring old woods for the charming city center—look for them downtown. Today they are the city mascot, loved and unloved by a whimsically ambivalent populace.
