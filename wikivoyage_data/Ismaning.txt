Ismaning is a small town of 17,000 people (2018) in Upper Bavaria 12 km north of Munich city ​​centre on the right bank of the Isar. It is known for the media centre that was built on a former ceramic manufacturing site in the southern part of the town. Several private broadcasters have their headquarters and their production facilities there. 


Understand[edit]
Ismaning lies on the east side of the Isar on the northern outskirts of Munich. Having a village feeling makes it a pleasing place to stay just outside of the city with convenient access to destinations in the north of Munich. 

History[edit]
Beginning in 750, Ismaning was part of the Freising monastery, a small spiritual territory of the Freising bishops, seat of a bailiff and court of justice. After 1319 it belonged to the Freising county on the Isarrain, and was its administrative centre. In 1803, it became  part of Bavaria.
The community was dominated by agriculture and small businesses until the middle of the 20th century. The only employers similar to industry around 1900 were a paper mill on Seebach and two brick factories and two herb factories. Around 1960, the ceramic manufacturing company Agrob was the largest local company. 
From the 1980s, economic development was determined by the proximity to Munich and thus by the settlement of companies from the service segment: the number of agricultural businesses fell from 115 to 82 between 1979 and 2007, and today there are around 12,500 jobs in the municipality more than two thirds are in the service sector. The former Agrob site became a media centre after the production ceased in 1990
