Understand[edit]
Ixtapan de la Sal was a salt flat harvested by the Nahual in pre-Hidpanic times. It was conquered by the Aztecs in 1472 and was forced to pay tribute to the empire in the form of sacks of salt. 
Ixtapan de la Sal is famous for its waters. Two rivers run through the town: the Rio Salado flows year round and the Rio Salitre flows only during the rainy season. There is also a historic aquaduct that once carried water to the town. Mineral waters flow from La Laguna Verde spring.
