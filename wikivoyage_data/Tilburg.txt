Tilburg is a large city in southern Netherlands. It started to grow during the Industrial Revolution, when wool factories were set up, thus making it the wool city of the Netherlands. Because wool was treated with urine during processing, employees had to bring along a full bottle to work every morning. This gave the Tilburgers their nickname of Kruikezeikers. Tilburg has about 215,000 inhabitants (2017).


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Tilburg already existed in the late medieval period, when there was West-Tilburg and East-Tilburg (Which is now in Oisterwijk). The lordship was known as Greater Tilburg, of which it was first Oisterwijk also with it, later it was Goirle. It was a part of the Bailiwick of 's-Hertogenbosch. Around the late 15th century, Tilburg contained a castle and Herd Places. These small places, streets with houses along it and agriculture between those streets formed the structure of which would once become the city of Tilburg.
Going further to the 18th century, slightly the first herd places became filled. In 1809, Louis Napoleon gave Tilburg city rights, after centuries of neglecting by the Dutch politics due to the catholic background of the city. However, the King William II, had found his nice place in Tilburg, and gave the mission to build a palace. Three weeks before completion in 1849, William II died. The palace is still standing as one of the few who survived the Mayor Becht's destructive urban renewal in the 1960s.
The city expanded rapidly in the coming century, from being not much more than a village, to one of the largest cities in the Netherlands. The industrial revolution meant that hundreds of looms were standing in the city, filling the rest of the former herd places. Wool and textiles from Tilburg were very known at the first half of the 20th century. These times gave Tilburg the name of Kruikenzeikersstad (Jars-pissing-people city).
As the Second World War was over, Tilburg shortly retained this position until halfway the 1960s. Since then, the economy would implode, that did not happen due to government money to attract Tilburg for modern industries.
Many monuments have not survived the renewal terror from Cees Becht in the 1960s. Beautiful historical buildings have made place for wider roads and gray flats. Also the train station was a historical one, but isn't anymore.

Get in[edit]
Central Station of Tilburg
By train[edit]
Tilburg is connected to the rest of the country by a twice an hour Intercity service, bound to both Eindhoven and Breda - Rotterdam - The Hague.
A second intercity goes twice an hour from Roosendaal-Breda to Tilburg and goes further 's-Hertogenbosch-Nijmegen-Arnhem-Zwolle. Trains in the Netherlands usually drive from 05:30/06:00 up to 00:00.
Intercity trains will drive in the night on Friday and Saturday nights from and to Eindhoven, 's-Hertogenbosch and Breda/Rotterdam/The Hague from 00:00 to 04:00.

By car[edit]
Tilburg is connected by highway only from Breda (with Belgium, Rotterdam-The Hague) and Eindhoven (Limburg, Ardennes, Rhine-Ruhr). To Waalwijk, it goes partially on a highway, and that is also for the city of 's-Hertogenbosch (!), which is not recommended for travelling fast and safe.
From Turnhout it is the small road via Ravels, Poppel and Goirle.

By bus[edit]
Flixbus serves the city. Breda and Eindhoven may have more intercity bus connections, both of them can be reached by train. Regional buses go from Waalwijk, Efteling, Oosterhout and Turnhout to Tilburg.

Efteling with 169 or 137
Oosterhout with 127
Turnhout with 450 (De Lijn)
Waalwijk with 137
By boat[edit]
No scheduled ferries come along the Wilhelminakanaal, but if you have a private boat, you can reach it from Eindhoven and the Meuse on the Wilhelminakanaal.

Get around[edit]
Map of Tilburg

Tilburg has three railway stations, and around ten city bus lines, going through all of the city, so every neighborhood is connected easily with the city centre. Some night buses drive through Tilburg, but not in every neighborhood.
Buses are operated by Arriva (Bravo)[dead link].
Tilburg is a very bicycle-friendly city, and has, like many other Dutch cities, red bicycle lanes. Bicycling might be faster than driving in a car or bus, and brings you much closer to many places. On the Heuvel, Pieter Vreedeplein and at the train stations are bicycle parkings.

See[edit]
Tilburg heritage is both historic and industrial of nature. The Oude Markt (Old Market) is a good place to start sightseeing, with the 1828 Heikese church and its 15th-century tower as the main point of interest. There are many churches in the city, and the 19th-century neo-gothic Heuvelse kerk (devoted to St. John) is another one you'll easily spot when exploring the town centre. It sits on the cosy Heuvelplein, where you'll also find outdoor terraces and an 1852 neo-classical statue of Dutch King William II (died 1849). William II enjoyed Tilburg and spent a lot of time in the city. Streets, schools, and the local professional soccer team are named after him.

Paleis-Raadhuis
51.554755.086841 City Hall of Tilburg (Paleis-Raadhuis Tilburg). It was built in 1847 as a royal residence for Kind William II. The royal family donated it later to the city to house a secular school for the middle class, founded in 1866. One of the early students was Vincent Van Gogh, later recognized as a brilliant painter. The school moved out to new facilities in 1934, when the city decided to refurbish it for use as a city hall. A new, much larger city hall building opened later in 1971 right behind the palace, and the historic building is now used for official ceremonies, including weddings 
Lancierskazerne
51.556135.094032 Lancierskazerne, Kazernehof. The oldest former army base for the Dutch cavalry to have survived.

Drink[edit]
Because Tilburg University had several undergraduate and graduate schools, this college town boasts lots of places where people congregate for a drink. Cafés to drink are allowed to be opened until 04:00, where in the last hour before closure time, only may come people out and not in. To neutralize the effects of alcohol, the municipality decided that bread-selling shops, shoarma/kebab tents and equivalent places are allowed to open up to 05:00. These opening times mostly will only be applied on Friday and Saturday nights.
A typical drink for Tilburg is the Schrobbelèr. This is a liquor with an alcoholic percentage of 21.5%, and is an herbal (and bitter) liqueur, although sweeter than most bitter liqueurs. The drink is sold throughout the year, more popular during carnival. It's sold in many restaurants and liqueur stores, also national stores in the city, for example in Café Tribunaal.
Most out and about places are in and around the city center, in three areas, all of them within a 1-km radius:

Heuvel and Heuvelring, with the city's most discos and some restaurants.
Korte Heuvel, which is a small street, packed with nice and cosy cafés.
Piusplein — a residential area with one McDonald's and several cafés and restaurants.
You can visit a traditional beer brewery in Berkel-Enschot (just east of Tilburg) at the Trappistenklooster. The brewery is now owned by the big brewer Bavaria, so it's not that traditional anymore.
