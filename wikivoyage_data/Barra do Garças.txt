Barra do Garças
Barra do Garças is in Mato Grosso, at the border with Goiás, where the Garças river flows into the mighty Araguaia.


Understand[edit]
Similar to Alto Paraíso in Goiás, Barra do Garças is known for its mystical atmosphere, with regular UFO sightings, strange unexplained lights, legends of crystal skulls, and a rumored connection with the genesis of the Inca civilization - some even say the surrounding Serra do Roncador range has a secret portal which leads to Machu Picchu. Like its American counterpart, Roswell, Barra do Garças has its share of alien-themed attractions, such as the alien landing pad under construction, and its share of hippie UFO-chasers as well.

Get around[edit]
See[edit]
Site of the future Discoporto, spaceport for UFO landings
 Cristo Redentor. On a hill overlooking the city, this smaller Christ statue, in combination with the city's beaches, causes the city to be somewhat exaggeratedly known as the "Rio de Janeiro of the West". 
 Freshwater beaches. At the confluence of the Garças and Araguaia rivers, there are popular freshwater beaches in June, July, and August, just when the rest of the country is in full winter mode. 
 Serra do Roncador. The "Snorer´s Range", so named because of an unexplained snoring sound reportedly heard from time to time, also receives many reports of UFO sightings and strange, levitating fireballs, and many inexplicably disk-shaped stones can be found in the area. The area has many trails by which you can visit many interesting sites such as the Caverna dos Pezinhos ("Little Feet Cave"), the Gruta Seca (Dry Grotto), and the very deep Lagoa Encantada ("Enchanted Lake"), whose lifeless waters hold spiritual significance for the Xavantes, the local indigenous people. 
 Parque Estadual da Serra Azul. This 11,000 hectare park, an arm of the Serra do Roncador, has trails, waterfalls, caves, archeological sites, and the site of the future "Discoporto", an area being constructed to make it easier for UFOs to land here.
