Squamish is a town of about 20,000 people (2016) in the Sea to Sky region of British Columbia half-way between Vancouver and Whistler. Squamish calls itself the Outdoor Recreation Capital of Canada due to the abundant rock climbing, hiking, mountain biking, golf, fishing, kayaking, bouldering, white-water rafting, horseback riding, scuba diving and other activities readily available in the area.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
The town of Squamish had its beginning during the construction of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway in the 1910s. It was the first southern terminus of that railway (now a part of Canadian National Railway). The town remains important in the operations of the line and also the port. Forestry has traditionally been the main industry in the area, and the town's largest employer was the Western Forest Products pulp mill. However, Western Pulp's Squamish Operation shut down in 2006. Before the pulp mill, the town's largest employer had been International Forest Products' (Interfor) sawmill and logging operation, but it closed a few years prior to the pulp mill's closing.
Squamish has become popular with Vancouver and Whistler residents escaping the increased cost of living in those places, both less than one hour away by highway. Tourism is an increasingly important part of the town's economy, with an emphasis on outdoor recreation.

Climate[edit]
Squamish is one of the wettest inhabited locations in Canada, with over 2,200 millimetres (87 in) of rainfall per year, often falling in long stretches through the winter.
Located at the head of North America's southern-most fjord, glacier capped mountains rise from the Pacific waters to create stunning views from the protected waters below. Steady, predictable winds practically assure a great day of sailing every day between May and Sept.

The Stawamus Chief
Rock climbing - Squamish is world renowned among climbers. The towering granite monolith, the Stawamus Chief, serves as the primary draw. There are over 600 established routes in the area, most of them traditional in nature, requiring the placement of gear for protection. There are many sport routes in the area with fixed/bolted protection though the majority of sport climbing in the area is along the Squamish-Whistler corridor. The boulders located at the base of the Stawamus Chief are starting to attract many climbers. This is to be partially attributed to the climbing DVD Rampage starring Chris Sharma. There are several quality guide books available for the established climbers as well as several commercial guides for hire.
