Drumshanbo is a small town in County Leitrim in northwest Ireland: in Irish Droim Seanbhó means "ridge of the old huts". It's at the south tip of Lough Allen, which almost bisects the county, and is drained by the River Shannon. The area was industrial in the 17th-18th centuries because of local coal and iron, and became connected to Ireland's waterway network. Those links fell into disrepair in the 19th / 20th centuries but have been restored, so Drumshanbo is now a centre for pleasure boating. Its population in 2016 was 902.

You can just about tour the sights by bus, but your patience will be sorely tested. You really need wheels.

See[edit]
High Street, or is it Main Street? Drumshanbo's main thoroughfare, only 100 m long, on its west side is Main St and carries the traffic, while its east side High St is a raised sidewalk.
Churches are both just north of Main St. St John's Church (C of I) is a gothic structure of 1829. St Patrick's (RC) on Convent Ave is also 19th century, refurbished in 2020. The convent remains active: these are the Franciscan Poor Clare Sisters founded in 1864; they're a secluded order and you can't visit.
54.038-8.051 Acres Lough is a small lake below Drumshanbo with coarse angling. The main attraction is the 600 m floating boardwalk, part of the Shannon Blueway.
54.078-8.122 Arigna Mining Experience, Dereenavoggy N41 YP48, ☏ +353 71 964 6466. Daily 10:00-17:00. Coal has been mined here since the 1700s, along a very narrow seam. It was used locally to make iron - Dublin's Ha'penny Bridge is made of Arigna iron. The seam was exhausted in 1992 and the mine was converted into an industrial museum. Adult €10, conc €8.  (updated Nov 2020)
54.093-7.9723 Sliabh an Iarainn ("Iron Mountain") is the scarp east of Lough Allen. Its iron ores have been mined since prehistory (in the Iron Age they were just what people were looking for) and on an industrial scale from 1600 to around 1780, with a cluster of iron-making villages nearby. The furnaces initially used charcoal, but the local forests became exhausted, with coal filling some of the gap. The top is a very boggy tableland, and near the summit hidden in a gully is a rock where mass was secretly celebrated in penal times.
53.991-8.0644 Leitrim: see Carrick-on-Shannon for this village at the upper limit of navigation of the River Shannon. A canal rises from Battlebridge 1 km northwest of Leitrim through Acres Lough to Lough Allen, while the Shannon-Erne waterway (here the refurbished Ballinamore Canal) starts from Leitrim itself. See Waterways Ireland map for current navigation status of both.
54.025-7.9555 Lough Scur is the first lake reached above Leitrim on the Shannon-Erne waterway, and has a marina and a couple of pubs. In the lough (which continues through a channel into Lough Marrave) are half a dozen crannogs, and the Keshcarrigan Bowl was found here. Several "castles" were constructed around the shores - Castle Sean was the most substantial but is now beyond a ruin. In 1605 the same Sean built a jail on an islet, suitably gruesome, but little remains of it. The waterway continues east to three smaller loughs and Ballinamore.
54.02-7.8356 Fenagh is a tiny village in the east of the county (not to be confused with Fenagh in County Carlow or Fenagh Crater on Mars). It has a ruined abbey, where the Book of Fenagh was composed in 1513. Nearby is a portal tomb and several standing stones, reputed to be pagan druids turned to stone for trying to eject a Christian saint. (Archaeologists think this is unlikely for a first offence.) The visitor centre is open M-F 10:00-17:30, Sa Su 12:00-17:30.
