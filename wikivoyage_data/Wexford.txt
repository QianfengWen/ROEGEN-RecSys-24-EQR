Wexford (Irish: Loch Garman) is the county town of County Wexford, on the southeast corner of Ireland. The bay that forms its harbour has for centuries drawn incomers, and it was at the centre of the rebellion of 1798. In 2016 it had a population of 20,188.


Understand[edit]
"The Pikeman", a memorial to the rebels of 1798 in the Bullring
Wexford began in the 10th century as the Viking harbour of Veisafjörðr - "Bay of the Mud Flats". A long sand spit stretched north from Rosslare to enclose the bay of Wexford Harbour: it was shallow but afforded protection for small wooden vessels. The bay also attracted other visitors: the Normans established a walled town in the late 12th century, the crusading Knights Templar had a base here, and Wexford was a major port into early modern times. Indeed it was a nest of privateers until Oliver Cromwell's forces arrived in 1649, killing not just them but most of the inhabitants. In 1798 Wexford, and the entire county, was at the centre of the United Irishmen rebellion - see County Wexford#Understand for this event which convulsed the whole of Ireland. And then came the worst of a series of famines. 
By the 20th century shipping had outgrown the harbour, the whole bay was silting up, and the sand spit was eroding and losing its protective value. A new port was therefore established at Rosslare to the south; Wexford became a backwater only used by small pleasure craft and fishing boats. Agriculture and fishing remain its main industries. 
The Tourist Information Centre is on the Quay front, 200 m south of the river bridge.

Get in[edit]
Five trains a day run from Dublin Connolly, taking 2 hr 30 min to Wexford via Dún Laoghaire, Bray, Wicklow Town, Rathdrum, Arklow, Gorey and Enniscorthy. The trains continue to Rosslare Strand and Rosslare Europort (for ferries daily from Wales, and in summer from Cherbourg, Roscoff and Bilbao). A walk-up single from Dublin is €16, see Irish Rail for timetables and ticket deals. This is the only railway route to Wexford, the line to Waterford was axed in 2010. 
52.343-6.4641 O Hanrahan Railway Station is by the river bridge. It's named for Michael O'Hanrahan (1877-1916), executed for his part in the Easter Rising.  
By bus there's competition on the route from Dublin. Expressway Bus 2 / X2 runs hourly from Dublin Airport and Busáras via Arklow, Gorey and Enniscorthy, taking 2 hr 45 min to Wexford, adult single €11. Wexford Bus 740 also runs hourly from the airport, with several stops in central Dublin (but it doesn't use Busáras), Arklow bypass, Gorey and Enniscorthy to Wexford; 2 hr 45 min but higher fares than Expressway. Change at Gorey for buses to Wicklow Town. 
Expressway Bus 40 / 440 is the Marco Polo of Ireland, trekking the width of the country from Rosslare ferry port via Wexford to Waterford, Dungarvan, Youghal, Cork, Macroom, Killarney and Tralee. The section between Wexford and Waterford runs every two hours and takes an hour. 
The Expressway bus between Wexford and Rosslare Europort only runs four times a day, to meet the ferries, and bypasses Rosslare Strand - use Wexford Bus 878, which runs from Strand M-Sa thrice.
Wexford Bus 376 runs twice or thrice a day from Carlow and Enniscorthy to Wexford. Bus 390 runs thrice M-Sa from Kilmore Quay.
Wexford bus station is next to the railway station: it may be shown on timetables as Redmond Square.

See[edit]
Town centre retains its Viking street pattern, with Main Street winding from the Abbey. Westgate, of 14th century, is the only surviving gate in the town wall, with other portions of the wall remaining at Abbey Street and Mallin Street. The quays are pleasant to stroll; "keysers" were the narrow alleys between quays and town in Viking times, with Keysers Lane the main thoroughfare.
Churches: the finest is the 18th century St Iberius (C of I) on North Main St, with Renaissance front and Georgian interior. See also Church of the Assumption on Bride St (RC, 19th C neo-gothic though much altered), Church of the Immaculate Conception on Rowe St (RC, likewise 19th C neo-gothic), the Presbyterian Church on Anne St, and the Franciscan Friary church. The friary was wrecked by Cromwell but remains active.
52.342-6.4651 Selskar Abbey in its present form was founded in 1190, dissolved in 1542 and utterly wrecked by Cromwell in 1649. There's a legend that Henry II spent Lent of 1172 at its predecessor abbey, doing penance for the murder of Thomas Becket. The story is credible since Henry II was in Ireland at that time, and trying to repair the political damage caused by the murder. Another credible legend is that a Viking temple to Odin originally stood here. In 1826 the ruin was incorporated into a Protestant church, which in turn has closed. There are tours of the site M-Sa at 15:00.
52.348-6.5172 Irish National Heritage Park, Ferrycarrig Y35 X313 (3 km west of town on N11), ☏ +353 53 912 0733. Daily Sep-Apr 09:30-17:30, May-Aug 09:30-18:30.

52.357-6.424 Wexford Wildfowl Reserve is on North Slob, an artificial island of reclaimed farmland created in the 1840s and lying 2 m below sea level. It's open daily 09:30-16:30, free.

The castle is a Gothic Revival mansion built in 1810. In 1945 it was given to the state in lieu of tax, and became an agricultural college and research station. The outbuildings in 1979 became the Agricultural Museum. The main house languished unoccupied until 2019 when it was restored to its original decor, and guided tours resumed - these include the 86-m servants' tunnel. There's an extensive park with gardens, woodlands, ornamental lakes, Gothic follies and statues. Museum adult €9, conc €7, child €4, plus €4 for house tour..   (updated Dec 2020)
52.388-6.3626 Curracloe Beach is a very long sandy beach northeast of town, 11 km away via R742. It's backed by sand dunes, and further south by the woods of Raven Nature Reserve. It was used as the location for Omaha Beach, the D-Day landing site in Normandy, in the 1998 film Saving Private Ryan. There are more sandy beaches south of town, see Rosslare.
