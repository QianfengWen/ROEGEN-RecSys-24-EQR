Chingunjav Memorial and administration buildings on Mörön's main square
Mörön is the capital of Hövsgöl in Northern Mongolia, and a usual stopover en route due to its central location in the province.


Understand[edit]
Mörön, whose name means "river" in Mongolian, was established as the administrative center of Khövsgöl Aimag (Province) on the site of a monastery in 1933. The Murungiin Khuree Khiid Monastery was built in 1809 and had a population of 2,500 monks at its peak. It was destroyed during religious purges in 1937. A new monastery was built in the 1990s, with maybe 40 monks. Today there are several museums and a large collection of deer stones 20 km outside of town, though most people simply pass through Mörön on their way to Lake Khövsgöl.

Get around[edit]
The town is small enough to walk around. From the town there is biggest fresh water lake Lake Khövsgöl located 100km to the west that is main attraction in the province.

See[edit]
Deerstone Complex
 Bronze Age Complex Site with Deer Stones at Uushigiin Ovor (UO) (17 km west of Mörön). Deerstones are large 2- to 3-m-tall stones with deer and other images carved on the surface. They're from the Bronze Age (1500 BC). In 2023 this site, together with three others near Tsetserleg were listed as a  UNESCO World Heritage Site. (updated Sep 2023)
Museum
Monastery - Danzandarjaa Khiid - on the western edge of town, from 1890, rebuilt in 1990, well worth a 20-minute visit. Arrive in the morning around 10:00 for morning prayer. A small donation would help renovation work.
Wrestling stadium - at eastern end of town
Town Square - with monument to Davaadorj
Mörön Monastery

Do[edit]
At the south east of the town there is nice Mörön river flows and you can fish, swim there and have a boat tour there.

Buy[edit]
There is a cluster of supermarkets around the 50° 100° Hotel; the largest and the best is directly across the road from the hotel's car park in a newer building. It's worth trying all the supermarkets as some stock things the others haven't.
Eat[edit]
Mörön statue
50° 100° Hotel - Popular and until midnight. Some unfortunately tiny but unique (for northern Mongolia) salads. Otherwise a variety of Mongolian (try the honey beef for 6000 ₮) and perhaps Western fare such as pizza and lasagne (although apparently empty promises as they're never available). Guests at the hotel do not need a reservation. Free decent WiFi. No real coffee for now, just instant coffee mix. Cross your fingers they buy an espresso machine to complete the cosiness. Cinnamon roll: stock up for those long horse treks north.
Jargalan Restaurant - further west from the 50° 100° Hotel on the same side of the road is the Jargalan Restaurant (look for the Cyrillic sign) which, although looking shabby from the outside, is pristine inside with bilingual menus (Mongolian and English) including pictures. Offering Mongolian fusion cuisine including Kimchi Hurshuur and a variety of soups. Tel: 24409 or 99509707.
Shalom Burger - apparently no burgers, but definitely sweet snacks. Upstairs over the supermarket on the NE corner of the 50° 100° Hotel intersection.
If you look carefully in the glass cabinets that masquerade as refrigerators at the supermarkets early enough in the afternoon before the staff have managed to eat them all, there are small pizza-like objects (around 12 cm in diameter) in plastic wrapping. Amazingly, they taste like pizza!
Aynii joloo coffee shop is very nice coffee shop and bakery in town really good place to have a coffee. Facebook video https://m.facebook.com/story.php/?id=100001510090095&story_fbid=7024410414285892
Drink[edit]
Don't forget Wednesdays are alcohol free. So stock up on Tuesday and drink at home, if you are so inclined.

Sleep[edit]
 50° 100° Hotel (East of town on the road to the airport), ☏ +976 99382345. Reputedly the best hotel in town. Deluxe double rooms with TV and immaculate bathroom featuring a hot shower for 50,000 ₮, although possibility of broken window panes. Situated on the central 'roundabout', N49° E100°. Wi-Fi in the restaurant on 2nd floor. If you're lucky the pizza on the menu will be available. Otherwise the best cinnamon rolls outside of Sweden. They also have a ger camp at Lake Hovsgol. 
 Eco Darhad guest house, ☏ +976 88826188, bold_v99@yahoo.com. It has apartments and gers in the centre of the city at USD5-10 per person per night. They also can help you with transportation, pickup service, translation, horse trips, guides and information and organize trips in Khovsgol region.
