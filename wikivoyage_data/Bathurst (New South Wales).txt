Bathurst is a city in the Central West region of New South Wales, some 200 km west of Sydney, mostly known for the Bathurst 1000 racing event.


Understand[edit]
The area's traditional owners are the Muurrai clan of the Wiradjuri people. The British town was founded in 1815 as the first inland European settlement on the Australian continent and Bathurst quickly became an expanding regional centre. Its wealth grew considerably during the first wave of the Australian Gold Rush in the 1850s and to this day plays off its history and gold rush heritage to attract visitors. Today it is a modern rural city, with good visitor facilities and walking down the main street you may be mistaken for thinking you're in a major urban centre.
Being inland of the ranges, Bathurst has greater temperature extremes than the coast. Summer days can be very hot, and there can be an occasional day of snowfall in winter. Bathurst also has areas of colourful leaves and flowers in the autumn and spring.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Bathurst is approximately 2.5 hours drive west of Sydney. Cross the Blue Mountains on either the Great Western Highway from the Penrith area or the Bells Line of Road from the Windsor area. On the other side of the mountains, follow the Great Western Highway from Lithgow to Bathurst.
The road between Lithgow and Bathurst is straight and quick with parts of it being a divided highway, however expect significant traffic delays when crossing the Blue Mountains away from Sydney on a Friday afternoon or returning to Sydney at the end of a weekend.

Stay safe[edit]
The weekend of the Bathurst 1000 is a risky time to be driving in the area: the fans are keen to emulate their heroes, and reckless driving is much more common than at other times.

Go next[edit]
The second large town in the area, Orange, is only half an hours drive west on the Mitchell Highway, and several bus services run between the two every day.
The interesting historical gold mining towns of Sofala and Hill End are about an hours drive away if you want to try your luck panning for gold.
Abercrombie Caves offer a less crowded alternative to the more famous Jenolan caves.  Cave tours are available (as well as a self-guided tour).  The route via Abercrombie is a scenic route to Canberra and the Southern Highlands.
