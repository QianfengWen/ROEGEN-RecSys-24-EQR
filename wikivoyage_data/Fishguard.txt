Fishguard (Welsh: Abergwaun) is small coastal town in Pembrokeshire, South Wales.

Fishguard Harbour

Understand[edit]
Fishguard is a port of entry into South Wales from Rosslare in south-east Ireland, and lies at the western end of a historic road to London, which eventually becomes London's Oxford Street, (The modern A40 by and large follows this route). The town has a population of around 3,000. 
Historically attempts were made by the Great Western Railway to make Fishguard a more significant port to allow passengers from London a slightly quicker journey to North America, by traveling by train from Paddington to Fishguard and then join a liner, rather than taking the train from Waterloo to Southampton.
