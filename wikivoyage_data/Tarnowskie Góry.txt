Understand[edit]
Zatym książę rozkazał, aby wysiekano; On las, a na tym miejscu miasto zbudowano.
A stąd ludzie – zszedszy sie zewsząd – w krótkiej chwili, Robiąc kruszce, niemałe miasto zbudowali . . . 
This poem of 1612 by Walenty Roździeński describes the founding of the city; in short, they cleared away the forest and dug up the ore.
Many villages in Silesia mined coal and metal ores, and grew into steel-making cities. The difference here was that in 1490 they found silver, and sparked a boom. Tales of hauling up near-pure metal would only be swallowed by the most gullible investor or prospector: natural silver is always found in combination with copper, nickel, zinc or lead. Anything better than 0.035% is nowadays rated high grade, and 0.1% silver content is "bonanza grade". But those other metals are also valuable so the town did very nicely, whenever it wasn't being ravaged by plague, wars or foreign occupation. The local ores were worked out in the early 20th century but Poland is still a major producer of silver, from mines near Lubin in the west of Silesia. Tarnowskie Góry's traditional industries have withered but parts of its vast network of mining tunnels are still accessible as visitor attractions.
Tourist information is at 8 Rynek, east side of the market square. It's open M 09:00-17:00, Tu Th 08:00-16:00, F 07:00-15:00.

Bus M14 runs direct from the airport to Tarnowskie Góry (multiple stops including the bus station) and Gliwice. It's every 30 min daytime and hourly overnight. 
Trains from Katowice run every hour or so, taking 50 min via Chorzów. In 2024 this service is replaced by a bus; so too is the train from Bytom.  
50.446718.86432 Tarnówskie Góry Railway Station is central, but it's decrepit with poor facilities.
Osada Jana is a small halt in the south of town which you're unlikely to use.
Long-distance buses don't call here, usually you change in Katowice. But some buses from Berlin and the Czech Republic stop at Gliwice on their way to Katowice and Kraków, so you can change there. Bus 5 runs every 30 min from Katowice to Tarnowskie Góry via Dąbrówka Wielka. Bus 19 runs from Bytom every 30 min. 
The bus station (Dworzec autobusowy) is at the railway station.
By road the direct route from Katowice is 26 km, but this drags through Chorzów and Bytom. During the working day it's quicker to go west on Highway 902 to Gliwice then branch north on A1, 46 km.

The Katowice tram network doesn't come this far out. Bus 3 runs every 30 min from Osada Jana in the south to the bus station then west to Stare Tarnowice.

50.425918.84983 Historic Silver Mine, Szczęść Boże 81, ☏ +48 32 285 4996. Daily 09:00-15:00. This mined galena - lead sulphide - with a byproduct of silver. As they plumbed deeper they hit the usual problem of flooding - horse-drawn pumps just couldn't keep up. In 1784 they found silver-rich seams, which steam-powered pumps let them exploit, and later a series of adits were drilled - sideways passages into the workings so the water drained naturally. The mine closed in 1913 when the best seams were exhausted. You descend one shaft with a guide and tour through the tunnels (1700 m in all, 270 m by boat) to emerge through another shaft. Tours take 1 hr 45 min, must be pre-booked and are available in English. A narrow-gauge railway potters about the surface site. The mine and adits are listed as a  UNESCO World Heritage Site. Adult 72 zł, conc 62 zł.   (updated May 2024)
