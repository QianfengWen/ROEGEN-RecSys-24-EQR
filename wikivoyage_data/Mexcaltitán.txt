Island of Mexcaltitan
Mexcaltitán, also known as Mexcaltitán de Uribe,  is a very old island settlement in Nayarit that may be the original home of the Mexica (and other Nahuatl-speaking peoples). Mexcaltitán has been designated as one of Mexico's Pueblos Magicos, despite having a population of only 818 in 2010, usually considered too small to support tourism. 


Understand[edit]
Aztec mythology holds that the Mexica people left their ancestral home of Aztlan in the year 1091 AD to embark on a journey to find a new place to live. They were to look for a sign from the gods, who would show them an eagle sitting on a cactus eating a snake. In 1325, they found that symbol and founded Tenochtitlan, the island in the Valley of Mexico that would become their capital, and eventually, Mexico City. Most historians accepted the story as mythology, but a few dug deeper to try to determine if the oral history had a factual basis.
In the 1880s, archaeologist and historian Alfredo Chavero put forth the suggestion that Aztlan did exist and that it might be the island of Mexcaltitlan. In the 1960s, that idea began to get more traction as historians did not find evidence that would negate the theory (but neither did they find conclusive proof that Chavero had been right). Today, the subject remains a lively topic of conversation when Mexican historians get together over a few tequilas.
Mexcaltitan is an island in the Laguna Grande de Mexcaltitan. It is a shallow lake that is mostly mangrove swamp in the area near Mexcaltitan. The island is very low and prone to localized flooding during the rainy season.

Get in[edit]
Mexcaltitlan is not particularly easy to reach and is likely to require a bit of flexibility and perseverence. The easiest way is probably to take a bus to Villa Hidalgo (Autobuses Orizaba runs one bus per day from Tepic), getting to Embarcadero la Batanga, and hiring a boat to take you to the island. On a nice day, it's an enjoyable 15-minute ride in the boat through mangrove swamps and channels to get to the island.
Getting there on your own is likely to require good Spanish skills and knowledge of backroad travel in Mexico. The road is basically a straight shot and it's in pretty good condition. Embarcadero la Batanga is to the south of the island and is at the end of the road from Villa Hidalgo, there is free parking if you drove (it is customary to tip the parking lot watchman). Several boat operators are available to take you whenever you want to go. The going rate is M$170 one-way or M$350 round trip, that's per boat, not per passenger. There are also collective boats that go at established times and cost less, assuming a group wants to go. These are cheaper, but you often have to wait a long time before one is ready to go.
Less adventurous tourists can sometimes find guided tours available from San Blas. Just pay their fee and let the guide worry about how to get there and back. A one-day trip is sufficient for most visitors. There are two docks used to drop off and pick up passengers. The docks are used either for boats arriving from Embarcadero Batanga or the other, smaller docks to the northwest of the island. To catch a ride back to the mainland, return to the same dock you arrived at.

Get around[edit]
0°0′0″N 0°0′0″EMap of Mexcaltitán
Walk. It's a small island, the city has a ring road with an interior grid layout with just 2 main north-south streets and 2 main east-west streets. It's easy to navigate and nothing is further than a few blocks. The town is small and everyone knows where everything is located so street numbers or complicated addresses are not used. 
If you don't like walking, I hope you can crawl, because you won't find taxis here (or any vehicles at all). The roads are solely pedestrian walkways, making the town a joy to stroll through. All the residents have boats though and small docks ring the island. If you're carrying luggage, there are porters with bikes or hand carts at the ferry dock that will take things to the hotel for you.
