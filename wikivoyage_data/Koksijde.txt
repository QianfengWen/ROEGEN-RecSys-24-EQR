Get in[edit]
Even though there is a train station called Koksijde it is easier to continue until the train station of De Panne (the terminal station of that railway line) and hop on the coastal tram to Nieuwpoort. For direct trains from Bruges, Ghent and Brussels it may be easier to get off in Ostend and hop on the coastal tram there.

Get around[edit]
Coastal trams connect the resorts of Koksijde-Bad with Oostduinkerke-Bad. Close to the sea promenade there are several places where it's possible to rent bikes, but these might be closed on weekdays in the less busy winter months.
