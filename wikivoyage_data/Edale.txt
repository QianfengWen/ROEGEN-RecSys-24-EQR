The village centre
Edale is in Derbyshire. Edale is the name of the valley of the River Noe and the name used by most people for Grindsbrook Booth, the settlement where the only train station in the valley is located. It is the southern terminus of the Pennine Way, a 268-mile long-distance walk to Kirk Yetholm in Scotland. Its railway station provides a quick and direct public-transport route to the heart of the Dark Peak countryside from Manchester or Sheffield.

Do[edit]
Pitch a tent (campsite in the village centre) before you walk the hills.
Kinder Scout, rising abruptly on the north flank of Edale, demonstrates the contrasts of this area. The landscape to the south is attractive limestone, but north of Edale, this changes to a gritstone plateau, poorly permeable to rainfall and overlain by peat bog. The plateau is bounded by steep scarps, so there are great views on the way up (an excuse to catch your breath) and along the scarp edges. But the interior is dismal: if you go in search of the summit, you'll struggle through bogs and lose the view, all for the sake of a couple of metres extra altitude. The summit is marked by an OS triangulation point at 636 m (2,087 ft); you'll be past caring when you reach it.
If you're doing all 267 miles (429 km) of the Pennine Way end-to-end in a single sortie, then the usual direction is northbound to have the sun and weather at your back, and Day One is from Edale across Kinder Scout and Bleaklow to Crowden-in-Longdendale. There are two routes out of Edale, which can combine into a circular walk for hikers who are simply day-tripping. The traditional route is to ascend Kinder Scout immediately up Grind's Brook, then head northwest across the plateau. The alternative route, more scenic and less boggy, is west across the fields to ascend by Jacob's Ladder, then north along the scarp edge. The two routes meet at Kinder Downfall, from where you trudge on north gradually descending. The plateau is crossed by A57 but with no nearby facilities, so you continue north over Bleaklow before the last descent into Longdendale, with a zigzag around the reservoir to reach Crowden. The route is well marked and has boardwalks over the worst bogs. 13 miles done, only 254 to go. It's similar gritstone terrain all the way to Gargrave in North Yorkshire, where the route re-enters limestone scenery in the Yorkshire Dales.
