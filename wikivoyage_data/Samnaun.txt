Samnaun is a city in Graubünden, in Switzerland.
It is close to the Austrian border and is a separate duty-free area, which means that you might be controlled by the Swiss customs as well when going to or leaving Samnaun. There are four villages inside the Samnaun area, Samnaun-Dorf (at the end of the road going through the area), Compatsch, Laret and Ravaisch. 
In the winter Samnaun is a place for snowboarders and skiers, as Samnaun is a part of the ski center in Ischgl at the Austrian side of the border, in the summer people come there mostly for shopping and enjoying the nature. There are many shops selling jewellery, swiss watches, alcohol and tobacco as well as many restaurants and hotels.
