Broken Hill is a historic mining city in the Outback of New South Wales.  Mining has occurred throughout the entire life of Broken Hill since its founding in 1883.  Australia's largest mining concern BHP has its origins here with the initials BHP standing for "Broken Hill Proprietary". The mining industry has declined, but it still plays an important part in the story of the town with many tourist attractions associated with mining.  The other main reason to visit Broken Hill is for the artists who have called the city home.  There are many galleries around the city that are worth visiting.


Understand[edit]
Broken Hill streets are often named after elements of the periodic table
Broken Hill and Silverton operate on Australian Central Standard Time (ACST). All other towns in the region operate on Australian Eastern Standard time (AEST). Despite its location in New South Wales, it has much closer ties to South Australia. When Australia adopted standard time in 1895, Broken Hill's only direct rail link was with South Australia's capital of Adelaide; it was not linked by rail to Sydney until the late 1920s. Broken Hill is regarded as part of South Australia for postal parcel rates and telephone charges, and most advertising offers directed to South Australian residents specifically include Broken Hill (and by extension Silverton).

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
It is just over 1,000 km of mostly long straight driving to Broken Hill from Sydney, and just over 500 km to Adelaide. Both roads are mostly good quality and sealed.  The scenery will change slowly along the way.  Broken Hill is in the outback, but is easily accessible by car. Traveling via car (even with bull-bars) from dusk to dawn should be avoided. It is the peak time for accidents with kangaroos. A large number of motorists are caught in the Outback having collisions with kangaroos. Any repairs in this isolated community can take quite a while to complete.

By train[edit]
NSW TrainLink run weekly direct services to Broken Hill from Sydney. It is called the 'Outback Explorer'. The Sydney to Broken Hill leg is on the Monday (6:20AM–7:10PM). The return journey is on the Tuesday (7:45AM–9:48PM). NSW TrainLink also run a daily service that is a train to Dubbo from Sydney and then a bus from Dubbo to Broken Hill. Sydney to Broken Hill is 7:10AM–10:45PM and the return is 3:45AM–8:48PM.
The Indian Pacific stops at Broken Hill twice a week as it makes its way from Sydney to Adelaide and Perth. Tours of the town are included in the price of the ticket of the westbound train.
Broken Hill train station is one block from the main shopping strip and it is walking distance to some accommodation. Taxis are available at the station to meet the trains.

By plane[edit]
-32.001388141.4716671 Broken Hill Airport (BHQ  IATA). Regional Express has direct services from Sydney, Adelaide and Dubbo. The Sydney service can either be direct (one return flight per day) or with a stop over in Dubbo. Essentially there are two flights per day from Sydney to Broken Hill; however, they book out quickly. The Adelaide service is a direct flight with two to three return flights per day.   
The airport is on the edge of South Broken Hill. Taxis are available at the airport into the town centre. Ask the flight attendant to arrange for a taxi pickup.

Coach tours are an option. Taxis are also available. But you will need a car to see the town and surroundings independently. This poses problems for the adventurous. Rental cars in the city often charge a premium for travelling further than 100–200 km, which is easy to do. After that, the rate is generally 25 cents a kilometre. Driving on unsealed roads is only allowed if you hire a four-wheel drive; even then, if you have an accident, you are liable for the entire insurance excess. So getting off the beaten track is difficult. At least one company only lets you drive to Menindee or Silverton.
Avis and Thrifty rental car offices are located in Argent St. in the town centre. The Hertz office is in the Visitor Centre building.

Do[edit]
 Mine tours. You can go underground in the mining shaft and get a real experience of mining. Active mining in the vicinity had caused the mine to close to tourists.

Try a spider at Bell's milk bar.
Bars[edit]
As one would predict for a mining town, Broken Hill has its fair share of bars but those expecting frontier style pubs will be disappointed. The majority of bars in Broken Hill are of the RSL club style, full of cheap drinks and pokie machines. Don't miss out on a game of two-up at the Musicians Club held on Friday and Saturday nights. The Barrier Social Democratic Club holds a disco night on Saturday night in which the young people from the town come out to play.

Sleep[edit]

Go next[edit]
Obtain a key from the Information Centre to see the Sculpture Symposium about 6 km from the city. The key allows car access to the sculpture site. Alternatively drive to the car park and walk 2 km to the site. A $10 park access charge is levied, payable at an honesty box near the site.
The historic boomtown of Silverton which has been the setting of several movies. Even though it 'poses' as a ghost town nowadays, it does in fact maintain a tiny population, having a camel farm. You can explore at will the ruined church and the Silverton Tramway, a now abandoned trainline which runs into South Australia.
The opal mining town of White Cliffs is an interesting spot to visit or for prospecting.
Stephens Creek Reservoir is an artificial dam 17 km north east of Broken Hill.
When full of water, the Menindee lakes make a spectacular and surreal sight in the otherwise arid landscape. A drive through the river red gum forest in the adjacent Kinchega National Park is also worthwhile. Several quarries are worth exploring and the Mundi-Mundi plains too, perfect for a romantic sunset.
Drive further to and through Mungo National Park to discover some old human history.
Head north on the Silver City Highway to Tibooburra and the remote Sturt National Park.
