 Park Cafe, 3147 Hwy 89, ☏ +1 406 732-4482. Jul-Aug: 7AM-10PM daily; Jun,Sep: 7AM-9PM daily. Expect to wait an hour or longer on weekends as weary hikers and local residents alike crowd the small restaurant for their famous pies (those in the know go early for the fresh strawberry pie, which usually sells out before dinnertime).  The other menu items are many and of good quality.  Mid price range.  No reservations.  Park Cafe closes for the off-season (mid-September). 
Also consider heading up the highway toward Babb and the Two Sisters.
