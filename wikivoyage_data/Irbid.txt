Irbid is a city in northern Jordan, some 88 km north of the capital Amman. Archaeological evidence reveals that Irbid has been settled since the Bronze Age. During the Roman period, Irbid was known as Arabella. The city's ancient past now lies hidden beneath modern roads and buildings.


Understand[edit]
The main industrial and administrative centre in the north of the kingdom, Irbid is home to the Yarmouk University, the Jordan University of Science and Technology and a good range of services, making it a staging point for exploration further afield to Umm Qais (Gadara), Pella and other nearby sites within the region.

Get in[edit]
In Irbid, almost all means of road transportation arrive at 32.5351835.8696961 Amman Jadeed Transport Terminal. Once there, you can hire a cab or local bus to anywhere in Irbid.
The 32.53336235.8694282 JETT Transit Station is just south from here.

By bus[edit]
To get to Irbid you have to start out from (Tabarbour) Transport Terminal in Amman. Buses to Irbid cost from 1 JD. From the same terminal, the more comfortable coaches run by Hijazi Buses Co. cost 2.10 JD and are more direct as they do not stop between Amman and Irbid.

By taxi[edit]
Ordinary cabs, recognized by their yellow or beige colour, are more expensive. But many of them have air conditioning, so they might be worth a try in the summertime.

Get around[edit]

You can get anywhere in Irbid by taking one of the many yellow or beige coloured taxi cabs. Unlike in Amman, in Irbid it is rare for a taxi to use the meter, even if you insist. Taxi rides in Irbid will typically be a set cost in increments of 0.5 JD, and you should negotiate the price before you depart. You can also take a "service" taxi or a bus, which have scheduled routes and can drop you off on the way. Ask the locals about the routes, because a) there are no regular departure time tables, and b) buses and taxi cabs wait up to take enough passengers in before taking off. You should not pay more than 0.20 JD

Finally, McDonald's is close to University Street Roundabout and Yarmouk University. For fast food, there are also Quick Burger, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Popeye's and other places, all on University Street.
