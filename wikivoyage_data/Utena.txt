Understand[edit]
Utena is first documented in 1261. It was a provincial capital and market town which grew from the 1830s when the St Petersburg-Warsaw highway was built this way, now the A6. It industrialised, and was rebuilt in stone after two fires ravaged its wooden structures in the 1890s. Utena was occupied by Germany from 1915 to 1918 then by the Soviets until 1919. It had a Jewish population of 2000 until 1941, when the Nazis wiped them out. Since World War II the town industries have been food processing, brewing, knitware and engineering.

From 1652 the Russian orthodox church re-aligned its liturgy and rites with the Greek orthodox. There was a furious reaction and schism, and those who wouldn't accept the changes were persecuted. These "Old Believers" scattered across the Tsarist domains, decrying the Antichrists who'd taken over, and insisting on making the Sign of the Cross the traditional way so not the ungodly new way so. In Utena an Old Believer congregation coalesced from the 1950s as they abandoned farming for town life, and by Independence they numbered 1000 and had enough money for their own church.
