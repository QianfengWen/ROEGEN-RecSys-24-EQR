Milngavie (pronounced "Mill-GUY") is a town in Clydeside in the Central Belt of Scotland. With a population of 12,840 in 2020, it's a commuter and retirement town for Glasgow six miles to the southwest. The main reason to visit is to walk the West Highland Way, which starts here. Milngavie is also a good base for exploring the Campsie Fells to the northeast, and Loch Lomond to the northwest.


Understand[edit]

"Milngavie" may mean windmill (Gaelic muileann gaoithe) or windy hill (meall na gaoithe). Local lore derives it from muileann Dhàibhidh, "Davie's mill", but that was somewhere else and Davie was some other guy. It was a small farming village, sometimes allocated to Stirlingshire and sometimes to Dunbartonshire, before becoming industrial in the 19th century with paper mills and bleach works. It became a leafy well-to-do suburb once the railway arrived in 1863, then was heavily urbanised from 1950 to re-house those bombed out along Clydebank during the war. For a time the Glasgow trams even ran this far out. Those were axed in 1956 but Milngavie retained its rail and bus links to the city, and is now mostly a commuter town.
Milngavie pitched a daring bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics. Somehow the decision went to Tokyo, then Paris pipped it for 2024. Huh, it's obvious money changed hands... better luck for 2028?

See[edit]

Gruffalo Trail is just across the town boundary south, see Bearsden.
55.9603-4.27332 Auld Wives Lifts are two massive boulders on the hillside with a third perched on top. So they look like a prehistoric megalith but are believed to be a natural formation, and a circular etching on one was probably by a modern quarryman. Their name stems from a folk tale that three old women had a contest for the heaviest stone they could carry here in their aprons.

The West Highland Way starts here and stretches 96 miles (154 km) to Fort William. It's usually done south to north, to have the sun and wind at your back, and to have the easier southern sections prepare you for the tougher terrain ahead. There are eight stages of 10-15 miles apiece. One easy way to do it, especially for working folk who are time-poor, is to tackle each half-stage as a Sunday afternoon bimble there-and-back, no rucksack no grief, drive home three hours later and do the next half-stage whenever you please. The first stage is Milngavie to Drymen, 12 miles (9 km), all easy lowland going. Start from the granite obelisk in town centre and plod north across the golf course and Mugdock Country Park, on into the fields and by small lochs. Zag west on B821 then on north by Dumgoyach Standing Stones, Dumgoyne village, west at Gartness to cross the river then bear north into Drymen.
John Muir Way is a 130-mile (215-km) walking trail from Helensburgh to Dunbar on the east coast. It's named for the naturalist John Muir (1838-1914) and initially stretched from Dunbar his birthplace to Edinburgh, but in 2014 was extended to Helensburgh. Hiking east to have the weather at your back, Stage Two is from Balloch across the hills to Strathblane near Milngavie, with an alternative route for bikes via Gartness and Dumgoyne coincident with the West Highland Way. Stage Three is through Lennoxtown to join the Forth-Clyde Canal at Kirkintilloch, thence along the towpath towards Edinburgh.
Campsie Fells are a few miles north, surrounding Fintry. Their highest point is the Earl's Seat at 578 m (1896 ft). "Campsie" is from the Gaelic for "crooked fairy", but it's best not to dwell on this.
Bearsden & Milngavie Highland Games are held in June at the West of Scotland rugby ground, midway between Bearsden and Milngavie. The next are on Saturday 8 June 2024.
