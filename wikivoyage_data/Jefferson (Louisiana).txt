Jefferson is an unincorporated area in Louisiana's Jefferson Parish along the East Bank the Mississippi River, just upriver from New Orleans. Jefferson has few attractions, but is close to New Orleans, Louisiana's largest city and main visitor attraction.


Understand[edit]
Jefferson is often called "Old Jefferson" by locals, to distinguish it from the rest of Jefferson Parish. 
Jefferson is separated from Metairie, Jefferson Parish's largest city, by a set of railroad tracks, a drainage canal, and the Earhart Expressway highway. Only a few routes cross this boundary. 
Although settled since the early 19th century, post-World War II US suburban style architecture predominates.
Jefferson is home of the main campus of Ochsner Medical Center, one of the region's most esteemed hospital complexes.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
From Armstrong New Orleans Airport or Interstate-10, take the Causeway Boulevard exit; Jefferson is near the river end. 
From Metairie, take Causeway Boulevard of Clearview Parkway and head south.
From New Orleans, Jefferson may be accessed by the Earhart Expressway, Deckbar exit -or-  Claiborne Avenue headed west; Claiborne becomes Jefferson Highway at the border. From the Carrollton section of New Orleans, the upriver (west) end of Oak Street turns into River Road in Jefferson.
