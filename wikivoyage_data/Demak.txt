Demak is regency in Central Java. The capital city has the same name. It was the center of the once-mighty Demak Sultanate.


Understand[edit]
Demak was the capital of the Demak Sultanate, the first Islamic kingdom in Java. The sultanate was founded in 1475 by Raden Patah and it played an important role in the spread of Islam in Java. It reached its peak during the reign of Trenggana when it expanded to East Java and conquered the last remnants of the Majapahit Empire. It declined because of succession conflicts and the capital was moved by Hadiwijaya to Pajang in 1568.
