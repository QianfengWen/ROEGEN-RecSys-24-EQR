Map of Mulberry (Florida)
By car[edit]
Mulberry is at the junction of State Road 60 and State Road 37. S.R. 60 is a major east-west route across Central Florida and connects Mulberry with Brandon, Tampa, and Clearwater to the west and Bartow, Lake Wales, and Vero Beach to the east. Heading north, S.R. 37 becomes the busiest north-south road through Lakeland—signed as South Florida Ave. To the south, S.R. 37 runs into sparsely populated rural area, dotted with many phosphate mines and associated chemical plants. The road passes through the 4-corners border between Polk, Hillsborough County, Manatee County, and Hardee County directly and jumps diagonally from Polk to Manatee County and is the quickest route from Polk County to the Sarasota/Bradenton area (via S.R. 64).

By bus[edit]
By air[edit]
The nearest commercial airport is Tampa International Airport (TPA IATA) on the west side of Tampa. Lakeland Linder Regional Airport (LAL IATA) is roughly 10 miles away, but does not have scheduled, commercial flights (as of November 2012).
