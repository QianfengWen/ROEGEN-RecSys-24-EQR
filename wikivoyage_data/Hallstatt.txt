Hallstatt is a small town overlooking the Hallstätter See (Lake Hallstatt) in the Salzkammergut, in the federal states Upper Austria of Austria. 
Formerly more known as a sleepy settlement nestled by a large salt mine, Hallstatt is spectacularly picturesque, due to its location on a narrow rocky west bank of the lake with the sheer rising mountains behind it.  Considered by some to be one of the most beautiful places on earth, Hallstatt is sometimes called "the pearl of Austria".


Understand[edit]
A view of Hallstatt, as typically shown in guide books and brochures.
The Hallstatt-Dachstein/Salzkammergut area has been added to the UNESCO World Heritage List with the following inscription [1]:  "Human activity in the magnificent natural landscape of the Salzkammergut began in prehistoric times, with the salt deposits being exploited as early as the 2nd millennium BC. This resource formed the basis of the area’s prosperity up to the middle of the 20th century, a prosperity that is reflected in the fine architecture of the town of Hallstatt."
Hallstatt was the site of an early Iron Age culture from 800 to 400 BC, which is known as the Hallstatt Era.  Hallstatt is considered to be the oldest still-inhabited village in Europe.
The charm of the small town has enticed several motion picture producers to illustrate or film in the town as part of its plot, from South Korean 2006 television series Spring Waltz to the village of Arrandelle in Disney's Frozen films, although tourists would better off venture to Norway instead to see a perfect depiction of the latter. Even a Chinese housing development, also called Hallstatt, is modelled almost exactly based on the original town centre. Since then, Hallstatt's 780 residents (2018) have been feeling the effects of over-tourism, especially from East Asia.  Residents have complained that the one million tourists each year, many of whom merely drive into town, take a few pictures, and leave a few minutes later, are exploiting the town.
During the off-season from winter (except the Christmas holidays) to early spring, fewer shops and restaurants are open, However, you are at an advantage of fewer tourists and can therefore easily stretch your visit by a few hours to a few days without the worry of crowds.

Get in[edit]
Hallstatt is normally included as part of a day-trip out of Salzburg for being the closest large city, but it is also easily accessible from other parts of Austria.

By plane[edit]
The nearest airport is at Salzburg, 75 km from Hallstatt, and should take less than two hours by car.
Vienna Airport, a larger airhub for Austria, is reachable in 3.5 hours. 

By train[edit]
To get there by train is most scenic indeed. From the main line between Salzburg and Vienna (2 or 3 trains per hour), get off at Attnang-Puchheim. Take a connecting train from here towards Bad Ischl and Obertraun (trains are sometimes labelled "Stainach-Irdning"). Get off at the 47.567513.66181 Hallstatt train station, which looks more like a halt in the woods, and find yourself on the other side of the lake with a gorgeous view. A ferry service from dawn to dusk will meet each arriving train and take you to the 47.563113.64962 ferry terminal across the lake in 10 minutes for €3.50 one way. During the ride, let yourself be captivated with a postcard view of the village, especially in the morning when the rising sun is turning the town orange and yellow. Beware the weather: in winter the lake may freeze, hence no boat. In this case, ask at the station or the train conductor.
If you are based in Austria and want to visit Hallstatt in only one day, a cheap option is the Einfach Raus Ticket (€32 for up to 5 persons), allowing unlimited train rides throughout Austria for a whole day (from 09:00 to 03:00 the next day). You can only take regional trains (R or REX), but fortunately such trains circulate on most lines in Austria. The train from Attnang-Puchheim to Hallstatt is of course a regional train too.

By bus[edit]
As of 2020, the town is limiting bus tours and requiring most groups to stay in the town for at least two hours, with the result that both prices and the overall quality of the trip may rise.
Budweis-shuttle, ShuttleCeskyKrumlov and CK shuttle [2] Czechshuttle.com, offers a door-to-door transportation service from Český Krumlov to Hallstatt and back for €39–81 per person (Dec 2018), depending on the number of passengers. The ride takes about three hours.
From Salzburg, there are direct buses to Bad Ischl (€10.20), and then you can either take the train and ferry (see above) or another bus.
Hallstatt is served by bus line 542 from Bad Ischl train station (€6.20 one way) and 543 from Obertraun train station (€2.50 one way) daily from 07:30 to 19:00. The bus stops for the town are Lahn and Demelgasse.

By taxi or car[edit]
It is generally not recommended to take a car to Hallstatt, as the village center does not allow vehicles and the few parking spots within the immediate vicinity are reserved for local residents. 
Hallstatt is located at the exit of Highway 166 between its entry just outside the nearest major settlement, Bad Goisern, and the Dachstein ski resort. The road goes along the west side of Lake Hallstatt.
From Salzburg, take Highway 158 to Bad Ischl and Highway 145 to Bad Goisern before joining Highway 166. From Vienna, you can connect to Highway 145 after exiting the A 1 freeway at Regau and continue southbound under the freeway for Bad Ischl. 
From the south, exit the A 9 freeway at Selzthal before continuing along Highway 320 towards Liezen and detour to Highway 145 in the direction of Bad Aussee. Follow the highway until the junction with Highway 166 just outside Bad Goisern. 
Alternatively, if you wish to enjoy a view of the lake from the south side, you can exit the highway at Bad Aussee by taking the second junction adjacent to Landmarkt turn left at the end of the road. The road has a high grade downward slope.

Parking[edit]
As no private vehicles are allowed to roam at the center, they must be parked at dedicated lots, two of which are right within the village - 47.5523213.648483 P1 behind the petrol station for overnight guests with shuttle service and electric cars, and 47.5549813.645124 P2 adjacent to the salt mine for day visitors. 
If both lots are full, there are two more outside the village at the south side of the lake: 47.5463613.660955 P3 which also serves drop off and pick up for tour buses, and 47.5461413.663516 P4.
Parking rates at all lots are free for the first 15 minutes and thereafter:

1 hour: €4.00
2 hours: €7.00
3-4 hours: €9.50
5-6 hours: €10.00
7-12 hours: €11.00
13-24 hours: Day ticket €16.00
Some visitors can also get away with free parking using several pullouts before the village at the north side as well as short term parking in the tunnel, however the former risks you walking to the village and back on the road shoulders, while the latter has few spots and most are reserved for residents.

On foot[edit]
Hallstatt is on the Austrian Northern Alps Trail, a 1000-km footpath that goes from Bregenz near Bodensee at Tyrol to Vienna in the east.

Get around[edit]

47.56363813.648683 Ossuary (Beinhaus). "Bone House" in English. Due to the extremely limited space in the cemetery, burials are only temporary. After 10-15 years the grave is opened and the bones are removed and bleached in the sun. Then they are stacked in the Beinhaus. It's not as gruesome as it sounds. Skulls are often decorated with painted flowers and the family name. This practice was stopped in the 1970s with the approval of cremation by the Catholic Church - you will see that those who remain buried all have recent dates of death.  (updated Mar 2019)

Eat[edit]
Despite the frequent tourists from all over the world, restaurant options are generally limited to typical Austrian fares, pizzas, and snack kiosks, while special dishes such as locally caught freshwater fish can be found at the fine dining establishments.

Drink[edit]
The local Fassbier (tap beer) is from Salzburg: Stiegl. This is available throughout Austria, however. A more interesting regional beer to try is "König Ludwig Dunkel Brau" (King Ludwig Dark Brew) which is not as widely available, although you will find it also in Tirol, to the west. Stop by the local grocery store "Konsum" (which is in Lahn) to check out the local selection of beers and wines without paying restaurant prices.

Sleep[edit]
Most hotels in Hallstatt are small with less than 50 rooms and family run, so that the cheapest finds here would count as mid-range elsewhere. There are villas (German: Ferienwohnung) that can be rented affordably for group travel.
Some hotels offer shuttle from the P1 parking lot for overnight guests.
