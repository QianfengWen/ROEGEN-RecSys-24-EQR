16th-century illustration of the Pied Piper legend
Hamelin (German: Hameln) is a town in Lower Saxony, 50 km southwest of Hanover. It is the scene of the Pied Piper story (German: Rattenfänger von Hameln), about the man who expelled rats from the town by playing the pipe, and then abducted the town's children when the citizenry refused to pay him what they had agreed. The town is visited by some three million visitors each year and is easy to reach from Hannover by train (S-Bahn).
