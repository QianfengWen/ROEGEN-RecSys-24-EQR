Ponce Inlet[dead link] is a town in Volusia County, East Central Florida.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Ponce Inlet Lighthouse, the tallest lighthouse in Florida.
It is said that in 1513, Juan Ponce De Leon was exploring the land and waters around the inlet that today bears his name. In 1886-87, a 175 foot high lighthouse was built and named after Ponce de Leon.
Ponce Inlet was named after Antonio Ponce, who was granted land here during the Spanish occupation of Florida.
In 1963, the Town of Ponce Inlet was incorporated; the first town council was sworn in at the lighthouse office. The lighthouse still dominates this small, sleepy town of fishing boats, natural parks, and growing condominiums.

Climate[edit]
Ponce Inlet offers a humid, subtropical climate that is typical throughout Florida. Winters are dry and mild, marked by a constant series of cold fronts and warm-ups. Temperatures dip into the low 40s and upper 30s (°F) on occasion, although freezes are rare. Snowfall is very rare.

Thunderstorms are frequent in summer afternoons. Dangers include hurricanes from June until November.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]

By train[edit]
Amtrak offers the Amtrak Auto Train service with its southern Terminus located in Sanford (Florida), about 35 miles (57 km) west of Ponce Inlet. The Amtrak Auto Train carries passengers and automobiles between Sanford and Lorton, Virginia, effectively serving as a car-rail link from Florida to the Washington, D.C. Metro Area. You can easily drive your car into Ponce Inlet after departing from the Auto Train.
Amtrak offers regular passenger service with the closest stop being near the city of DeLand. This stop is rather remote and is not recommended as an option.
