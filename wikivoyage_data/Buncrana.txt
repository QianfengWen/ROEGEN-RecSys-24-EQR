Buncrana (Bun Cranncha, "foot of the river Crana") is a town on Inishowen Peninsula in County Donegal, on the shores of Lough Swilly. It was a textile town, but the "Fruit of the Loom" factory closed in 2006, so Buncrana now gets by as a commuter base for both Derry (23 km) and Letterkenny (43 km). Its population in 2016 was 6785, making it the second-largest town in the county.
The main reason to come is to explore Inishowen Peninsula, the northern tip of the Irish mainland. The TIC is Go Visit Inishowen on Railway Rd, open M-F 09:30-17:30, Sa 10:00-16:30.

See[edit]
Castle Bridge at the outlet of Crana River leads to the Keep and Swan Park.
55.14-7.4631 O'Doherty's Keep is the shell of a tower built by the Normans in the 14th century. The third floor was added in 1602 to welcome the Spanish army that would surely drive out the English; but they landed altogether the wrong end of the country at Kinsale, and were besieged then sent packing. Nothing daunted, Sir Cahir O'Doherty launched his rebellion of 1608, burning Derry, but he and his men were soon beaten. It only remained for the English to burn this place in reprisal, put to death any remaining rebels, and award the land to their own supporters. The Keep passed to the Vaughan family, who in 1718 recycled much of the stone to build Buncrana Castle adjacent (a private mansion, no tours), and they laid out the town on its present pattern. The Keep is unsafe to enter but you come for the scenic riverside park.
55.141-7.4752 Ned's Point Fort half a mile beyond the Keep is a gun battery built in 1812 against Napoleonic invasion. It was re-armed in the 1890s but disarmed in 1905. The structure is derelict and you can't enter.
55.197-7.5533 Fort Dunree, Linsfort. M-F 10:30-16:30, Sa Su 12:00-18:00. Built against Napoleon like Ned's Point, but this is an altogether sturdier battery on a scenic outcrop. It was similarly disused after 1815 but re-armed later in the century, and stood ready through the First World War. In 1938 it was one of the last fragments of British territory handed over to the Republic of Ireland: a few "Treaty Ports" and their defences had been kept on after independence in 1921. The Irish army continued to use the fort until in 1986 it became a museum. Adult €7, conc & child €5.  (updated Aug 2021)
Dunree lighthouse 200 m north of the fort was first lit in 1876 and remains in use.
55.084-7.4624 St Mura's is a C of I church in Fahan with monastery ruins in its graveyard.
55.065-7.4955 Inch Island is connected by road to its east and a footpath causeway to its south. A 15th century turret stands at its southwest point, but you mostly come for the bird life in the lough channel. An 8 km loop path follows the shore.
55.197-7.3346 Slieve Snaght is the 615 m mountain between Buncrana and Carndonagh. You might be content to admire it from afar, as it's boggy and midge-ridden by any route. Shortest but soggiest approach is from the lane to the east, 12 km return. Many prefer to ascend from R244 around Drumfrees: a track leads up towards Slieve Snaghtbeg (505 m), then pick your way to the main summit.
Grianan of Aileach: see Derry for this sturdy ringfort above Burt village.
