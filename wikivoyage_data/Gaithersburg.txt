Understand[edit]
Gaithersburg was settled in 1765 for agricultural purposes. It grew into a town after the opening of a stop on the B&O Railroad in 1872; however, the area remained predominately rural until the 1970s. It is now famous for being the site of the headquarters of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
