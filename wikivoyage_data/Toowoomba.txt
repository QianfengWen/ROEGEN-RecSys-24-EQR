Toowoomba (also referred to by locals as "Woombie" or "T-ba") is a regional centre in Queensland, 127 kilometres WSW from the City of Brisbane and 90 kilometres west of Ipswich. With a population of 142,163 (2021), Toowoomba is Australia's largest inland city that is not a planned city (i.e. not Canberra).


Understand[edit]
It's 130 km west of Brisbane on the escarpment of the Great Dividing Range; travel time is approximately 90 minutes by road.  After Canberra, Toowoomba is the second largest inland city in Australia.

By plane[edit]
-27.5586151.7951 Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport (formerly Brisbane West Wellcamp Airport; WTB  IATA) (is 17 km west of Toowoomba). Despite its former name the airport is 130 km from Brisbane and is not a practical alternative to Brisbane Airport (BNE IATA).   
There are few passenger flights operating from the airport. Services include:

QantasLink operates direct services to Sydney. There are 2 flights on weekdays and 1 flight a day on weekends.
Regional Express (REX) operate services from Brisbane to Toowoomba and onwards to the rural towns of St George, Cunnamulla, Thargomindah, Charleville, Quilpie, Windorah, Birdsville, Bedourie, Boulia and Mount Isa.
Bonza operates direct services to Townsville and Melbourne. Flights to Townsville operate on Sundays & Wednesdays, while flights to Melbourne operate on Mondays, Thursdays & Saturdays.
Airport transportation[edit]
Rental car companies are represented at the airport. Given this is not a major airport it may be advisable to reserve a vehicle in advance.
Taxis are available from the airport into Toowoomba City however considering the considerable distance from the CBD, commuters should expect at least a $50 fare.
No public transport services exist for the airport.
By train[edit]
Toowoomba does not have frequent rail services – it is not at all a popular means of getting into the city. Queensland Rail's Westlander service passes through the city twice a week on its journey between Brisbane and Charleville. Travel time by train between Brisbane and Toowoomba is approximately 3.5 hours, making the train journey substantially longer than the 90-minute trip by car or bus.

The westbound service departs Brisbane at 7:15PM on Tuesday and Thursdays, travelling through the night to arrive in Toowoomba at 11PM.
The eastbound service departs Toowoomba at 7AM on Thursday and Saturday, arriving in Brisbane at 11:30AM.
The east bound service descends down the Toowoomba Range in the early morning, offering excellent views of the rugged landscape.

By car[edit]
There are three main ways to get into Toowoomba from the south, though there are some additional highways coming from the north and northwest. They include:

From Brisbane, it's about an hour and a halfs drive west via the A2 Warrego Highway and the A21 Toowoomba Connection Road from Brisbane.
From Stanthorpe, it's about 1 hour 45 minutes drive north for 144 km (89 mi) via the A3 and A15 New England Highway, and is also the route that you'll need to take if you're coming from Armidale or Tamworth.
From Goondiwindi, it's about a 2.5-hour drive northeast via the A39 Gore Highway and the A139 Toowoomba Athol Road, and the route you'll need to take if you're coming from Victoria or Central NSW.
By bus[edit]

Get around[edit]

Silver Service is a lesser-used taxi service that offers fully qualified drivers and is often regarded as a pricier but better service.
A limited bus service operates in Toowoomba, with 6 bus routes covering the city. For the most part frequencies are hourly, increasing slightly for the AM and PM peak period. On Saturdays some routes are less frequent and others do not operate. No routes operate on Sundays. Information on timetabling and fares is available from the Queensland Government website.
By car[edit]
The Toowoomba Bypass at the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing
Getting around Toowoomba by car is the most convenient option, as with almost every regional city with a population fewer than 200,000, public transport options are severely limited.
There are three major roads that traverse and connect Toowoomba. 

The A21 is no longer one single road, but a series of roads that make up the old A2 Warrego Highway. A21 starts at Helidon Spa just before when the A2 Warrego Highway becomes a motorway, heads up towards East Toowoomba, winds its way through the CBD, and then heads west back toward the A2 Warrego Highway where it continues west.
The A3 New England Highway traverses Toowoomba in a north-south direction, also passing through the CBD.
The A139 Toowoomba-Athol Road connects Toowoomba to the locality of Athol about 10 kilometres southwest. It makes up the road of what used to be the A39, before it got rerouted towards the Warrego Highway on the new bypass.
The last one doesn't traverse Toowoomba, but connects the outer suburbs, the A2 Warrego Highway is Toowoomba's only motorway, mostly two lanes in each direction, but not a very convenient route in getting around Toowoomba. The motorway is perhaps one of the most scenic as it passes through mountainous terrain (and no other motorway in Australia outside the ACT goes through this kind of terrain), but it is tolled – as of early 2024, the tolled motorway costs $2.71 for cars and $1.36 for motorcycles, but only if you pass under the New England Highway. Otherwise, it's free to use.
