Orvieto[dead link] is a city in Umbria. Designed to be impregnable, it was founded by the Etruscans on the top of a steep hill made of tufa, a volcanic ash stone.

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
The Orvieto train station is at the base of the hill at Orvieto Scalo and there are several daily trains to Florence, Chiusi, and Rome. The station is small and it is easy to find a taxi or a public bus up to the town. The best option however is to walk over to the funicular terminus just outside the station and take the spectacular ride up!

By bus[edit]
The bus station is at Piazza Cahen on the Eastern edge of the town. Public buses, taxis, or a quick walk will get you into the town itself. Frequent buses run to and from Rome (2 hrs), Viterbo, Bolsena, Perugia (1 hr), and Todi (2 hrs). Bus A connects Piazza Cahen to the Piazza del Duomo and Bus B to the Piazza della Repubblica.

By car[edit]
Orvieto is on the A1 autostrada that runs from Milan to Rome via Florence. After exiting the autostrada, a steep road winds its way up to the town. The approach to the town is one of the most glorious things about visiting Orvieto, but parking in the upper town is very limited and many streets are pedestrianized. It is better to use the free parking available at the railway station (then take the funicular up to center of the town) and on Via Roma if you eat at a restaurant in the centro storico (ask for a voucher at the restaurant).

Get around[edit]
Map of Orvieto
A funicular railway runs from the railway station to Piazza Cahen and is an easy and spectacular way of getting into town. The town itself is small and walking the entire length of the town is easy. Frequent public buses run through the town and taxis are also available. Parking in the upper town is very limited and many streets are pedestrianized, so that driving is neither convenient nor necessary.
Useful bus routes:

Bus 1: Railway Station to Piazza della Repubblica.
Bus A: Piazza Cahen to Piazza del Duomo.
Bus B: Piazza Cahen to Piazza della Repubblica.
Bicycles are available for rent at Testa Renato on the Via Montmarte and at Ciclo e Trekking Natura e Avventura on via Montenibbio near the station.

"Luca Signorelli and Orvieto"
"When Luca Signorelli was given the contract for the frescoes at the Orvieto Duomo, he added a stipulation that he should be given all the wine (from Orvieto) that he could drink! Whether it was the wine or his talent, his Last Judgment at the cathedral is a masterpiece. Credited with being among the first to introduce anatomically correct nudes, this series is considered to have provided the inspiration for the more famous Last Judgment of Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel."


Just wandering around within the walled city is part of the experience. Piazza del Popolo, Saint Patrick's well, La Cava well (etruscan), Corso Cavour (with its shop and restaurants), the Medieval quarter, Saint Giovenale, Saint Giovanni and Saint Francesco churches, Albornoz rock and the surrounding promenade of the downtown are all worth a visit.

42.71701112.1132721 Orvieto Cathedral (Duomo di Orvieto). The wonderful Duomo of Orvieto is the main 'must-see' sight in this town. Constructed in the 13th and 14th centuries, the black and white striped building is in mixed Romanesque and Gothic styles. The setting, on the Orvieto hill and visible from miles away in the Umbrian countryside, doesn't hurt either. But, impressive as the cathedral is, the piece de resistance is inside, the frescoes of Luca Signorelli on the theme of the Last Judgment inside the Capella di San Brizio.   (updated Dec 2020)

Eat[edit]
The gelato in piazza del Duomo is the best.

Budget[edit]
Pizzeria Charlie's- Corso Cavour. Some of the best pizza you will eat in all of Italy. A varied menu, wines, on tap beers, etc. Open for dinner at 19:00. Pizza prices range from €5-7. Delicious.
Pasqueletti's- Gelateria, (Next to Duomo, and on the corner of Corso Cavour and Via Duomo) fresh gelato, open from mid day until 00:30. €2-3.5 for a cone/cup. They will let you put up to three flavours on one order. (It's a chain-there is also another Pasqueletti's on Via Corso Cavour near to Via Duomo, a much smaller store though.)

Mid-range[edit]
 L'Asino d'Oro, Vicolo del Popolo (In a narrow lane off the Piazza del Popolo). Orvieto's sole chef inspired restaurant with a menu that changes daily but stresses the boar and truffles that the area is famous for. The chef, Lucio Sforza, does the rounds and the setting is quiet with most tables outside in the patio. Closed in winter. 
 Maurizio, Via Duomo (right by the Duomo), ☏ +39 0763-341114. Umbrian food. Typical great dishes, great wines at reasonable prices. 
 Ristorante dell'Ancora, Via di Piazza del Popolo 5-11. The owner is local and his name is Carlo, his wife silvna owns a shop in the town as well. Tiramisu is exceptionally delicious. Eat on the outside candle lit terrace surrounded by lush green vines for a more romantic experience 
Splurge[edit]
 Etrusca, Via Lorenzo Maitani 10 (Near the Duomo). Traditional food in a fifteenth century building. 
 Locanda Del Lupo, Corso Cavour, 231. Wednesday night. 
Drink[edit]
Orvieto Classico Amabile white wine. There is a little shop with yellow awnings that sells meats and cheeses and wines on Via Duomo that has a nice array of Orvieto wines. An old married couple, Vera and Giovanni, work there. They will be happy to assist you in picking out the perfect "vino", depending upon what food you will be drinking it with.

 [dead link] Cantina Foresi, Piazza Duomo, 2 (on the corner of the main entrance to the Cathedral square). A nice place to have a glass of wine and traditional processed meats and cheeses from the Umbrian region. But what makes this place really interesting is the opportunity to visit the cellars cut into tufo rock and dating back to the 13th century. The walls (and bottles!) are covered by a white mold. 
 Blu Bar (through the arches out of Piazza Della Reppublica, on the left side further down the street). Local hangout, amicable bartenders, and wi-fi internet access. 
 Caffe Corso, On the main street, Via Corso Cavour. Free Wi-fi access, nice little place to sit and get on the internet, very friendly staff, quick snacks and drinks. Open late, usually till midnight. 
Sleep[edit]
