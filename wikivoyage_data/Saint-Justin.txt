Understand[edit]
History[edit]
The zinnia flower is the emblem of the municipality. The municipal motto is: "By the cross and the plow" signifying the toil of the farmers and the Catholic faith of the inhabitants.

Geography[edit]
The village of Saint-Justin was built at the junction of the Gérin road and the Duchesnay street. The population lives mainly in two areas:

along rue Duchesnay (west bank of the Ormière river) and Gagné road (east bank of the same river);
along the rue Savoie (west bank of the Bois Blanc river) and the Bois Blanc road (east bank of the same river).
The north-western part of the territory is mostly wooded and mountainous. Apart from the main village, the south-eastern zone is mainly agricultural. The Canadian National Railway, which was built at the foot of the mountains, separates the two zones.

Economy[edit]
The economic activities of Saint-Justin are centered on forestry, agriculture, recreational and tourism activities (resorts, sugar shacks, bike, snowmobile, VTT).
