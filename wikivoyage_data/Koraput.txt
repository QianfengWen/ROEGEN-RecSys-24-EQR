Koraput is a city in the state of Odisha (formerly Orissa), near the borders of Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh states. It has enchanting hills, verdant forests, winding streams, exotic wildlife and a rich tribal way of life.


Understand[edit]
It is the commercial nerve centre of the region.  The aircraft engine plant of Hindustan Aeronatics Limited (HAL) is at Sunabeda about 20 km from Koraput. National Aluminium Corporation (Nalco) operates at Damanjodi nearby. 

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
There are three airports in the area - one at Visakhapatnam which is 5 hours by road, the second one is Raipur which is 7 hour to Koraput. The third one is Jeypore airstrip, which has some air connections with Bhubaneswar (IndiaOne Air).

By train[edit]
Koraput is connected to Vishakapatnam by a day train and Bhubaneswar by a night train. The Hirakand Express (train number 18447) leaves from Bhubaneswar at night (7:35PM), and reaches Koraput, the next morning (9:15AM). Most of the people get down at Vizianagaram  at around 2AM (tell the TTE to wake you up) and catch share taxis for Koraput, Sunabeda or Jeypore - it takes around 3 hours and costs ₹350-400 per person. A passenger train (Visakhapatnam-Kirandaul Passenger, Train Number 1VK) leaves from Vishakapatnam in the morning (6:50AM), and reaches Koraput by evening (1:20PM). The journey through the scenic Araku Valley is breathtaking and attracts many tourists.
Samleshwri Express has two sleeper, one AC three tire and some general coaches for Koraput. It leaves Howrah at 9:35PM daily and takes almost 24 hours to reach Koraput via Rourkela, Sambalpur and Rayagada. From Kolkata you can take the Howrah-Koraput express. Another way is to take a train on the Howrah-Chennai route, get down at Vizianagaram (50 km before Visakhapatnam from Kolkata side) and catch share taxis to Koraput which takes 3 hours and costs ₹350-400 per person.

By road[edit]
Koraput on the hills can be reached from most places in either Odisha or Andhra Pradesh by travelling up a heavily forested winding road (also called a ghat road), with many sharp hair-pin bends. The road trip from either state is quite scenic. It is the most travelled and well maintained. If travelling in the early morning or late evening, you definitely will spot wildlife feeding along the road, or even spot the odd carnivore. There are forests of sandalwood trees all the way.
There are 2 ways to get to Koraput from Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram:

The route from Visakhapatnam traverses along Pendurthi, Kottavalsa, Srugaravarapu Kota (S.Kota), Araku, Araku Valley and Koraput. This route is a bit long and is well paved till at least the Andhra Pradesh-Odisha border. As Araku Valley is a hill station and major tourist attraction in the northern parts of Andhra Pradesh one can get decent accommodation in one of the 3 Andhra Pradesh Tourism Department operated resorts or private hotels at Araku Valley. And from there one can travel to Koraput after a refreshing night in the laps of nature. The road from S.Kota to Araku Valley is a ghat section or a winding mountain road which has 9 hair pin binds on route 1.
The other route to Koraput from Visakhapatnam goes via Vizianagaram, Gajapathinagaram, Rambhdhrapuram, Salur, Pottangi, Simliguda, Sunabeda (HAL) and Koraput. From Vizianagaram the trip to Koraput is around 150 km and the journey time is usually 4-6 hr depending on the road conditions, traffic conditions and the weather. The road till the Andhra Pradesh and Odisha border is well maintained on the Andhra Pradesh side.
The journey to Koraput is scenic and as mentioned above and one will definitely see wolves, foxes, and if one is lucky enough hyenas and bears on the roads. Coming to the scenic part, it is a very scenic to watch but really dangerous for the inexperienced driver who never drove earlier on winding ghat roads (mountain roads), especially trying to avoid ditches, potholes and all other obstacles
