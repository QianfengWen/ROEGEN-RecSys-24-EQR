Understand[edit]




Origins of the name
Before the Second World War, a native of Batangas arrived to sell blankets and mosquito nets, in this place that was still then named "Tongotong", a barrio of the Bangui municipality. Tired and hungry, the peddler sought sustenance and shelter in one of the houses nearby. After settling down, he was asked about his intentions, but, not understanding, he merely answered, "Ako'y pagud na pagod at ang sapatos ko'y pudpod," in his usual Batangas accent. This reply became the byword of the residents of Tongotong. Months later, a native of the Bicol Region coming to seek employment in one of the local logging companies alighted in Tongotong and asked one of the bystanders the name of the place, to which he was toldː "Ako'y pagud na pagod at ang sapatos ko'y pudpod,". The Bicolano thus ascribed the name Pagud-pudpod which was later shortened to Pagudpud (and supposedly means soft sandy soil) to the place which held for perpetuity.
