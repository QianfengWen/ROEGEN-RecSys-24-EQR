Gemlik is a city in the Southern Marmara Region of Turkey, with a population of 91,070 in 2018. "Gemlik" means shipyard and it's a commercial port and centre of industry. 


Understand[edit]
Gemlik is industrial
"Gemlik'e doğru denizi göreceksin; sakın şaşırma" - Orhan Veli Kanık (1914–1950)
"Towards Gemlik / You'll see the sea / Don't be surprised"
Gemlik is hemmed in by mountains north and south, and sits on a plain at the head of the Gulf of Gemlik, an inlet of the Sea of Marmara. So the traveller between Yalova and Bursa gets unexpected glimpses of the sea, which inspired Kanık's three-liner, much quoted locally. But Kanık should have looked where he was going instead of bumbling into a workmen's trench, receiving a terminal surprise. 
The plain is fertile and there has been settlement here for at least 8000 years, and the Hellenistic city of Kios (Kίος) stood here. The town continued to have a majority Greek population until the exchanges and deportations laid down in the 1923 peace treaty. Basically nothing of those times remain. Gemlik is nowadays a large industrial sprawl; it has a beach strip but there are better elsewhere. You'd probably only come here to change buses towards Armutlu, or because you're involved in the manufacture of automobiles or pickles.
