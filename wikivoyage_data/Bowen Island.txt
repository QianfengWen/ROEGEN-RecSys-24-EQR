Bowen Island is a small island and a municipality at the entrance to Howe Sound, connected to Vancouver and the rest of the Lower Mainland by a short ferry ride from Horseshoe Bay in West Vancouver - additionally, private water taxis can be chartered but there are no regular/scheduled water taxi services available. The island has become a favourite tourist destination although amenities and activities are limited. Most activities involve wandering the shops or exploring the parks and natural areas.
