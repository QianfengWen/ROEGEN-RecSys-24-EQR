Palizada is a small town in western Campeche near the border of Tabasco, Mexico. It's a town that historically harvested brazilwood, but that tourists will find more interesting for its rivers  and jungles around the Laguna Terminos, as well as for a small Mayan archaeological site, El Cuyo.


Understand[edit]
The area surrounding Palizada was originally home to Nahuatl and Chontal groups, though they did not build any significant permanent settlements here.
Palizada was first established as a Spanish settlement in 1772, though logging began as early as 1668 when stands of brazilwood were found in the local area. The trees were mostly wiped out by the eruption of Volcan Santa Maria in 1818, and with it, the lucrative logging business. A few small stands of brazilwood can still be found in the area. 
The town's Centro Historico provides an interesting architectural perspective with its masonry buildings and French tile roofs (the tile was bartered by France in exchange for hardwoods from the nearby jungles).
