'Come as you are' in honor of Kurt Cobain
Aberdeen is a city in the Olympic Peninsula region of Washington. The city is the economic center of Grays Harbor County, bordering the cities of Hoquiam and Cosmopolis. The population was about 17,000 in 2019.


Understand[edit]
Aberdeen is called the "Gateway to the Olympic Peninsula", because of its proximity to the southern end of the peninsula and to Olympic National Park. Since the late 1980s, Aberdeen has been famous as being the "Birthplace of Grunge", and the hometown of Nirvana members Kurt Cobain and Krist Novoselic. A sign welcoming visitors to Aberdeen proclaims "Come As You Are" as a tribute to the band. Professional wrestling fans will know it as the hometown of Bryan Danielson, now performing under his real name in All Elite Wrestling but perhaps better known for his long run in WWE as Daniel Bryan.
Although it's hard to imagine today, at one point Aberdeen was a notorious Western outpost at the turn of the 20th century, with a number of saloons, brothels, and gambling halls in and around the town. Because of the wild atmosphere associated with these establishments, Aberdeen was nicknamed "The Hellhole of the Pacific."

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The nearest major airport for commercial flights is Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA IATA), which is about 80 miles away.
