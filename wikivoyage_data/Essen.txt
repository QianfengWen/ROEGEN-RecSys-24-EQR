Understand[edit]
Winding tower of "Zollverein" pit—Essen's most iconic landmark
Essen is a regional centre of the Ruhr area. Although its history goes back a long way, it was not until the middle of the 19th century that it grew from a small town to a large industrial city, with over 750,000 inhabitants at its heyday. 
Essen was famous as a classic heavy industry centre; this has changed since the 1970s. Only a few symbols remain from the former mining industry. Steel production is no longer as important as it used to be. Like the rest of the Ruhr area, Essen is affected by emigration. From 1990 to 2008 alone, the population fell by almost 50,000. However, unlike most of the Ruhr area, Essen's economy is one of the strongest in Germany; it houses numerous energy companies (thus giving it the title of "energy capital of Germany") and logistics firms.
The meaning of the city name is unclear; it probably means "(place in) the east".

Stay safe[edit]
Despite having a fairly strong economy compared to other cities in the Ruhr area, Essen has a very high crime rate by German standards. The poor northern suburbs of Essen (especially Altendorf, Altenessen and Karnap) suffer from occasional, potentially armed, robberies at night. Be aware of pickpockets on the Christmas Market and watch your bags in crowded bars and near the train station. Aggravated assaults have also been reported.
