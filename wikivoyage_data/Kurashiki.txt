Kurashiki (倉敷市 Kurashiki-shi) is one of Japan's great old merchant towns, with around half a million citizens today. Sitting along a scenic canal at the foot of Mt. Tsurugata, Kurashiki's white-walled storehouses are beautifully preserved and open for exploration.


Understand[edit]
Canal and bridge in Kurashiki
During the Edo period, Kurashiki did heavy trade with the capital in rice, sugar, and other goods. Later, during the Meiji Restoration (i.e. after 1868), the city became known for textiles. Kurashiki escaped World War II largely unscathed, and as a result, many of the original storehouses, mills, and shops remain in beautiful condition, open to visitors in the Bikan Historic Area.
The effect is delightful — storehouses (倉 kura) with lattice windows share space with weeping willows along the banks of the old canal, which is illuminated at night. The canal has led some overly optimistic tourist associations to call Kurashiki "the Venice of Japan". If not that — the city surrounding the Bikan area is as much a concrete jumble as any other in the country — Kurashiki is still a rare piece of old Japan, one that gives a sense of where people lived and worked, not merely the temples at which they worshipped.

Tourist information[edit]
Tourist Information in the Bikan Area
Tourist information can be found at the two main train stations.

34.595681133.7715561 Bikan Historic Area (倉敷美観地区), 1-4-8 Chuo-dori, ☏ +81 86-422-0542. 09:00-17:00. 
The local tourist association has a Japanese-only guide site with integrated machine translation.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
 Okayama Momotarō Airport (岡山空港 OKJ IATA), Okayama. A shuttle bus connects Kurashiki Station with the airport (45 min, ¥1,130). Tickets can be purchased from a vending machine outside of the airport. Large luggage is okay; the driver will stow it underneath the seats. Staff at the information booth just beyond baggage claim are very helpful, and will go outside with you to purchase the ticket and get you on the appropriate bus.  Catch a flight there, or take a second shuttle bus to Hiroshima Airport (2 hrs, ¥2,100). (updated Jul 2020)
By train[edit]
Kurashiki is on the San'yo Main Line between Okayama and Fukuyama. The best way to reach Kurashiki from the San'yo Shinkansen is to transfer to a local train at Okayama; the ride takes about 15 minutes (¥320). The few express trains between Okayama and Kurashiki are more than twice as expensive, and will only save you a couple of minutes. However, if you have a Japan Rail Pass, you can take either a local or a limited express; on the latter, hop onto any non-reserved car and flash your rail pass to the conductor, declaring Kurashiki as your destination.

34.602262133.7651082 JR Kurashiki Station (倉敷駅), Achi 1-1-1, ☏ +81 86-424-1220. 09:00-17:00. Exit the train station to the south (left from JR ticket collection), overlooking the bus depot. Stay on the upper level, and you'll find the office among the shops to the right (west). 
34.564978133.6778163 JR Shin-Kurashiki Station (新倉敷駅), 390-4 Tamashima Tsumasaki, ☏ +81 86-526-8446. 09:00-17:00. The Kodama Shinkansen stops here. 
By bus[edit]
Several companies run daytime and overnight bus routes from Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, Matsuyama, Tokushima, Kochi, Fukuoka, and elsewhere. Operators include Chugoku JR Bus Company (☏ +81 86-236-1123). Buses arrive and depart outside the north exit of JR Kurashiki Station.

Get around[edit]
Kurashiki - city center and Bikan area
On foot[edit]
The sites in and around the Bikan Historic District can all be reached on foot from the south exit of Kurashiki Station - about a ten minute walk down Chuo-dori or the Ebisu-dori covered arcade. Other areas of the city are spread out too far apart to walk between them. The jeans-related attractions can be reached on foot from Kojima Station but not the Washuzan or Shimotsui areas.

By train[edit]
Although the city is all connected by land, in terms of rail travel, it feels disconnected. Shin-Kurashiki and Kurashiki Station are located along the JR Sanyo Main Line, but the other areas require train transfers outside of the city to reach. To get to Kojima Station from Kurashiki Station you need to travel to Okayama Station and transfer to the Marine Liner. Similary, to reach the Makibi area, you need to take a train to Kiyone Station in Soja on the Hakibi Line and transfer to the private Ibara Railway which has three stations in Kurashiki: Kawabejuku Station, Kibinomakibi Station, and Bitchukurese Station.
Mizushima Rinkai Railway is a private railway company that runs from Kurashikishi Station (next to Kurashiki Station) to Mizushima Station (select trains go one stop further to Mizubishijiko-mae Station) in the Mizushima area.
For JR Rail Pass holders, the pass can be used on the Marine Liner to Kojima and to Kiyone Station however, Ibara Railway and Mizushima Rinkai Railway are private railways not covered by the pass.

By bus[edit]
Some parts of the city are most easily accessed by bus. For access to Washuzan, Washuzan Highland Park, and the Shimotsui area, there is an hourly bus from Kojima Station that does a loop to each of these areas.
The Tamashima area can be reached by bus from Shin-Kurashiki Station. Ikasa Bus and Ryobi Bus can both get you within walking distance of Entsuji and the Saisou-tei.
Although Kojima has a train station, there is a bus that operates twice per hour between Kurashiki Station and Kojima Station in about 50 minutes. If you don't have a rail pass, the bus is cheaper and more convenient than going by train. It also travels directly by the Bikan Historic District and Jeans Street, so you don't have to backtrack to or from any stations to reach them.

Bikan Historic Area[edit]
Even if you're not interested in the subject of a certain museum, the chance to explore inside these old warehouses and mills might be worth the price of admission. Virtually all of the museums (and many of the stores) are closed on Mondays, which does at least mean fewer crowds and photo hounds competing for that perfect shot at the foot of a bridge.
For a terrific view of the entire Bikan area, head up the granite stairs on Mt. Tsurugata to the Achi Shrine, and have a wander around the park at the top.

Events[edit]
Su-inkyo with his fortune-granting fan
Since the Edo Period, Kurashiki has had an interesting mascot known as Su-inkyo (素隠居) that appears at Achi Shrine's May and October festivals. The Su-inkyo are people wearing masks of an old man and woman carrying fans. If they touch your head, it is said to bring good luck.
