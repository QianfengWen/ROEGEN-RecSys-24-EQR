History[edit]
The name Masset was a gift from the captain of a Spanish vessel that was repaired with the assistance of the Haida citizens of Atewaas, Kayung and Jaaguhl. These three villages accepted the gift and adopted the name Masset to commemorate what might be the first ever contact between Europeans and the Haida.  The name Masset is now used by the Village of Masset and the Village of Old Massett, the original recipient of the name and a village under the Constitution of the Haida Nation.  Masset's name in the local dialect of the Haida language is Uttewas, "white slope", probably referring to a small hill south of the village.
