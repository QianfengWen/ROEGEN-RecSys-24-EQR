The Bauernkrieg is a part of the history of Böblingen and Sindelfingen. Memorial by Lutz Ackermann, in Stuttgarter Straße, Böblingen.
Böblingen  and Sindelfingen are two cities next to each other near Stuttgart in Germany.  Most of the travellers are here for work or to do business. Some travellers to Stuttgart stay here to avoid the centre of Stuttgart for whatever reason and still enjoy access to the city via the S-bahn. Some of them are visitors to the nearby exhibition and trade fair centre Stuttgart Messe or just need a place to stay near the airport. Some come to Sindelfingen to get their new Mercedes Benz directly from the manufacturing plant. 


Understand[edit]
There is a long rivalry between the cities that predates the bloodshed of the Bauernkrieg in 1525, but today both cities have the long-term plan to unite. Böblingen and Sindelfingen today share aspects of city development like the waste water treatment plant, incineration, road maintenance, electricity grid, telephone network, district heating and public transport. Both cities even share one common city quarter. On other aspects, both cities are still divided. They are different political entities, have two town halls, two mayors, two budgets, separate fire and police departments, different sports facilities, different concert halls, and different events.
Both cities have developed well. While the city of Sindelfingen has the car manufacturing plant, a lot of the connected industry and logistics is situated nearby in Böblingen-Hulb. This gave both cities a diversity of well paid jobs in different industries and a lot of tax revenue and the opportunity to grow.
Autobahn 81, that runs between Sindelfingen and Böblingen, is undergoing a major upgrade from 2021 until at least 2026. All bridges and exits will be renewed, and also some supporting roads undergo a major upgrade. This will lead unavoidably to a lot of inconvenience for locals and travellers to both cities with construction noise, unpredictable changes in traffic flows, clogged streets and unreliable time frames for public buses. Traffic and quality of life will improve dramatically as soon as the project is finished.

Sindelfingen[edit]
Sindelfingen has about 65,000 residents and has maintained many old framework buildings in the old city. Its citizens and visitors enjoy a rich cultural life of high quality. The city has one of the highest percentage of residents from other nations in comparison to other cities of the same size. In fact residents of foreign origin now outnumber residents of German background.The people of all the different nations come together every year to celebrate Internationales Straßenfest and try the different traditional foods and enjoy music and dance performances. The villages of Maichingen and Darmsheim are a part of the city of Sindelfingen.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
48.69059.19261 Stuttgart Airport (STR IATA), ☏ +49 711 948-0. Stuttgart Airport is the nearest international airport. There is no direct connection from the airport to Sindelfingen, but you can reach Sindelfingen by Stuttgart's S-Bahn system, changing trains (from S2 or S3 to S1) at Stuttgart-Rohr. Taxi still is in reasonable distance. Some hotels in Sindelfingen offer shuttle service to the airport.   
You can also use the Frankfurt Airport (FRA IATA), which has a direct high-speed railway connection to Stuttgart, which takes little 80 minutes, landing you at Stuttgart's Hauptbahnhof (central railway station). From there you can use the local public transportation. Other less convenient options could be Munich and Zürich.

By public transportation[edit]
Böblingen and Sindelfingen are part of the unified public transport system of VVS that covers the whole region of Stuttgart. There are five train stations of the S-Bahn Stuttgart and four stations of the Schönbuchbahn that give access to local bus lines of the stadtbus. From Stuttgart main station or from the airport, the shortest route is S1 to Herrenberg. The trip from Stuttgart main station or from the airport to Böblingen station should take around 30 minutes. Sindelfingen also has a direct bus line to Stuttgart-Vaihingen, that stops near some hotels.

By car[edit]
Böblingen and Sindelfingen are very well connected to major highways and many think they are even too well connected. There are four exits to the Autobahn 81, that runs in north and south direction between the cities. The Autobahn 8, which runs in east-west direction, is only a few kilometers away and goes through the woods of Sindelfingen and is connected by Kreuz Stuttgart to Autobahn 81. Additionally, there is the Bundesstraße 464 which runs along the west side of the cities and is the main access road for cargo transport to the car manufacturing plant. Five exits connect both cities to Bundesstraße 464 and to some neighbouring cities.
The old cities have only access roads and only residential parking. You should avoid these parts unless you know exactly the spot where you want to go and how to get in and out again. Böblingen and Sindelfingen owe their wealth to the development of the car and the car industries. They are the two cities that treat cars like holy cows, but still do milk them a bit. Never touch a car, it is offensive and keep distance. Those luxury cars have big doors that swing wide open. There are lots of parking spaces in the city. The supermarkets and malls in the center allow one hour parking for free and charge €1 per hour after that. There is a huge underground parking under the marketplace in Sindelfingen that charges a similar rate. Ikea allows free parking for the whole day, but closes the car park overnight. In the northeast of the city in the Hohenzollernstraße near the Badezentrum and Burghaldenfriedhof are two big parking lots that allow parking for free. You also can place a trailer or a camper there for some days. There are two bus stations Altenheim Burghalde and Badezentrum that connect to the city.

By bike[edit]
Signs for bike freeways
Böblingen and Sindelfingen are connected to Stuttgart over the Radschnellweg Böblingen/Sindelfingen – Stuttgart. This is one of the first bike roads of its kind in Germany. The idea of these high speed bicycle roads is to have a direct connection between communities that are at least 5 km long and 3 metres wide. They have a smooth surface, and are separated from other road traffic and have as little crossings with busy roads in order to make it as fast as possible and they are illuminated. These roads are designated with the green bicycle signs and have a green strip at the banquets on both sides. The aim is that the road allows a sustained travel speed of 20 km/h.
