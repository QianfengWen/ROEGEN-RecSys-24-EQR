Ventura, still officially called San Buenaventura, was founded in 1782 by Fray Junipero Serra with the establishment of his mission.
Along Main Street you will find fabulous food, excellent shopping from thrift stores to upscale boutiques, a movie theater, coffee shops, and other attractions. Turn the corner at Main Street and head up Ventura Avenue and you are on the Westside. The Westside is an up-and-coming area of Ventura with a rich cultural history.
Note the iron bells every few miles on the 101 freeway. They are markers of El Camino Real, the route of Father Serra.

Being a beach town, Ventura has developed the downtown beach area into a wonderful promenade that makes its way along the beach, from "Surfer's Point" past the pier all the way down to the southern end of San Buenaventura State Beach.  It makes for a nice jog, bike ride, roller-blading path or just a leisurely stroll to watch the sunset.

Buy[edit]
The Pacific View Mall and surrounding area (located about 3–5 miles (5-8 km) southeast of old town Ventura, toward Oxnard) tends to be the shopping hub for the locals while tourists will appreciate the kitsch and variety of Old Town. Still, serious shopaholics are better off in Camarillo at the Camarillo Premium Outlets or in Thousand Oaks at The Oaks.

Ventura has a hidden gem in the music/alternative mecca known as Salzer's which is on Victoria near Oxnard and Montalvo. The store is split into two factions: Music and Video which oddly enough are located in separate buildings on either side of Victoria.
Thrift Stores! Main street (near California street intersection) has a great selection of thrift and antique stores. Many really great finds can be found if you are willing to look through some junk.
Eat[edit]
 Winchesters Bar and Grill. At the other end of old town. They have a large beer selection, and fabulous food! Quite a pickup joint, second only to Table 13. 
 Busy Bee Cafe. This campy 1950s style diner on Main has become a Ventura landmark. Pop in for a root beer float, raspberry-lime rickey, hot fudge sundae or one of many classic American food favorites. 
 Johnny's. On the Westside, at 176 N. Ventura Ave., just around the corner from Main Street. A Mexican food institution in Ventura. Try their famous shredded beef burritos prepared "three way"—meaning with beans, rice, and cheese! 
 Sharky's Woodfired Mexican Grill, 4960 Telephone Rd, ☏ +1 805-339-9600. Daily 11AM to 9PM. Good quality, fresh Mexican food. 
 The Sushi House, 1127 S Seaward Ave, ☏ +1 805-643-5550. Small restaurant near the beach that serves up very fresh, tasty sushi. 
 Tony's Pizza. This is the best little pizza shack in town. It's perfect after surfing or hanging out at the beach. Also, the guy there will talk to you like he's known you for years. The pizza is thin crust style, and is very good. 
 Toppers Pizza. The best local pizza restaurant in town. Great for the family. Voted the best pizza two years consecutively by Ventura County Readers Poll. Big televisions and great salad bar. 
 Taj Cafe, 574 E Main St, ☏ +1 805-652-1521. One of the best Indian restaurants in Ventura. Dinner will set you back about 20 dollars a person. 
Drink[edit]
Overall, Ventura is a great place for easy-going party people. Many restaurants have terrific happy hour specials daily with both food and drinks at remarkably low prices. This makes it easy to grab an early meal or make plans with friends.
San Souci is the local dive where young and old alike go.
The local gay bar has the unlikely name of Paddy's, so don't be fooled into thinking it's an Irish pub. Friendly atmosphere and reasonable prices.
