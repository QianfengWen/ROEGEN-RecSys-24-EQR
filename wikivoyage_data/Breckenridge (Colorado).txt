Willoughby had it built. His son Ralph Willoughby and his bride Maude spent their first months of marriage in this small frame house. At the time, the honeymoon suite was a remodeled horse stable that occupied a spot on the property owned by the groom’s parents at 322 South Main Street. When the newlyweds moved out in 1903, Ralph’s father put the cottage up for lease. The newspaper ad read, “FOR RENT. CABIN WITH OR WITHOUT BACHING OUTFIT. INQUIRE OF R. W. WILLOUGHBY.” The tiny cottage was moved to the current location in 1990 and restored as a romantic cabin. The Cottage is featured on the Breckenridge historical walking tour. $99 - $329. 
39.48488-106.046363 The Williams House, 303 North Main Street A, ☏ +1 970-889-4066, thaaftink@gmail.com. The Williams House is a Victorian home from the 1880s. The size is 2750 square feet. It sleeps 16 guests in beds, 11 individually. Building a frame house in Breckenridge before the arrival of the railroad was no small task. To erect this c. 1881 house and the one next door (301 N. Main), Breckenridge saloonkeeper Joseph F. Reeder had to chop down trees, drag them to the sawmill, have them milled for different uses — siding, flooring, shingles, etc. — and let them dry. Inflating the cost of construction was the need to pack finished building materials — nails, paint, and doors — over a high mountain pass at a cost of forty cents per pound. In 1888, John Williams, a hardrock miner, and his wife, Minta, purchased the house as their home. After John and Minta’s separation in 1890, Minta and their daughter, Ethel, continued to live here until 1906, renting it out from time to time as they pursued an acting career for Ethel. The Williams House is featured in the Historic Walking Tour. $399 - $1599.
