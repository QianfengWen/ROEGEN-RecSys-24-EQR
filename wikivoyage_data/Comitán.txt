OCC and several private mini-bus operations service surrounding locales, including the Mexican-Guatemalan border and San Cristóbal de las Casas. Their terminals are located on Boulevard Belisario Dominguez Sur. To get to the jungle lake of Laguna Miramar from Comitan it is necessary to take a colectivo to the small town of Las Margaritas from where there is a second colectivo to San Quintin (6 hours). It is a 1-km walk from San Quintin to the village of Emiliano Zapata from where you can hire a guide to take you through the Lacondon jungle to Laguna Miramar.
Tzimol - It is a small municipal only 20 minutes away easily accessible by car or public transport. It is famous for its rolling sugarcane hills and valleys and the beautiful San Vicente river that runs at the edge of town (same river that goes to Chiflón). There are local traditional industries here like artesanal pox factories, palm weaving and a delicious raw cane sugar called "panela" which you can visit through a local tour. The town is also the departure point for a canyoning adventure tour to Las 3 Tzimoleras waterfalls.
Cenote Chucumaltik - A beautiful open cenote about 30 minutes from Comitan. You can see the beautiful geological formations underwater and there is also an underwater altar dedicated to the Virgen de los Dolores. Its clear and crystalline waters maintain a pleasant 24 °C all year round, great for swimming, snorkeling, standup paddleboarding or just relaxing in its blue waters. It’s a popular spot for scuba diving as well. You can combine a visit to the cenote with the Uninajab natural pools and Chiflón waterfalls. The easiest way to get here is by car. The exit is along Highway 226, clearly marked to Uninajab. By public transport, take a colectivo from Comitán or Tzimol and head towards Chiflón. Ask the driver to leave you at the exit to Uninajab. From here, you’ll need to walk 3 km to the entrance of the cenote and another 1 km to the cenote. There are colectivos from Comitán that can bring you directly to the entrance but they only leave 3 times a day (07:00, 12:00 and 16:00 and return to Comitán at 08:00, 13:00 and 17:00. Entrance M$30.
Uninajab and Laguna Koila — The main attraction of this area is its series of natural pools. It’s a perfect place to spend a hot day and it’s a popular swimming spot for many people from Comitán. There are palapas, restaurants, bathrooms and shops. Further ahead you can find Laguna Koila, a nice place to go swimming. See Cenote Chucumaltik for directions. Entrance M$25
Cascada El Chiflón — a series of beautiful, radiant blue waterfalls about 40 minutes away from Comitán. It is possible to hike almost to the very top, and the views are quite spectacular. It will likely be a lot hotter than in Comitán due to the lower elevation. It is also possible to swim in a few of the pool areas in the lower/middle sections, but not under any of the actual waterfalls. Colectivos (M$50 per person, updated April 2023) leave fairly regularly from Transporte La Angostura bus station on the main highway through the city. Entrance to the waterfalls is M$80 (updated April 2023), and food/drinks can be purchased at several locations on the path up the waterfall.
Lagunas de Montebello — lovely blue lakes located inside a national park. Entrance to the park costs M$30. Many people take a tour from San Cristobal de las Casas, but colectivos (M$70-80) depart somewhat regularly from Transporte Montebello in Comitán, a few blocks from Parque Central Bonito Juarez. The colectivos go straight down the highway through the park, so you can get off near any of the lakes. You can swim in the lakes (updated April 2023)
