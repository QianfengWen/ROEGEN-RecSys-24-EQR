Shaki (azr. Şəki, sometimes spelled "Sheki") is Azerbaijan's true travel gem, a small city off on the forested slopes of the Greater Caucasus Mountains. Rich in Islamic architecture, Silk Road history, good food, and friendly people, this is travel and leisure in the Caucasus at its finest.


Understand[edit]
Few foreigners visit Azerbaijan beyond the capital city, Baku. In so doing, they overlook a true gem in the form of Shaki. The small city of Shaki has a whole lot to offer by way of historic attractions; in particular, the Palace of the Shaki Khans (Khansarai) is a magnificent work of Islamic architecture and a world heritage site. Its setting is stunning; it lies in the rolling, thickly forested foothills, which spread out to the south, while to the immediate north are the dramatic, snow-capped peaks of the Greater Caucasus. The possibilities for treks into the unspoilt mountain landscapes are endless, and are alone a great reason to visit the city. But more than anything, the relaxed pace of life evident in Shaki's central market and tea houses makes the city a welcome respite from whatever cares you may have.
A relatively small city, Shaki has a population of about 63,000. It is situated in northern Azerbaijan on the southern part of the Greater Caucasus mountain range, 325 km (201 mi) from Baku and not far from the Georgian border. Shaki is located at an altitude of 500 m (1,640 ft).


History[edit]
Throughout its history, Shaki was swung between independence and foreign domination. In its earlier centuries, Shaki was the seat of an Albanian kingdom, which was invaded repeatedly by the Persian, Roman, Parthian, Arab, Mongolian, and other empires. In the past millennium, Shaki fell under the influence and often the direct rule of Persia or the Shirvanshahs of Baku. Shortly after the 18th century collapse of the Safavid Empire, Shaki became the capital of the independent Shaki Khanate, during which the Khansarai was built. But Shaki's independence did not last long; it was absorbed in the early 19th century by an expansionist Russian Empire. Due to Shaki's rather tumultuous political history (in a tumultuous region), the majority of Shaki's preserved historic and architectural monuments date from only the 16th-19th centuries.

Climate[edit]
Winter — cold, but the snow is only heavy during January and February
Spring — beautiful with the once-brown mountains turning green from the rain
Summer — mild
Fall — quite warm during the day, but at night it gets a bit chilly, so pack a jacket and a thick blanket
Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
The train station has a somewhat inconvenient location about 17 km (11 mi) from the city center. In order to reach the station you will either have to take a taxi for 4-10 manat (depending on your negotiation skills) or hop on a Baku-bound bus or marshrutka and ask the driver to drop you off by the railroad station, and then walk about 200 m to the station. There are night trains that run from Baku-Balakan and make a stop in Shaki. There is also a Balakan-Baku train that passes through Shaki. Passengers must produce their passports in order to buy tickets. It would be wise to purchase a ticket for the luxury carriage in advance. You can contact Mr. Xemlet at ☏ +994 50 672 5538 or Mr. Arxan at ☏ +994 55 672 5758 to make advanced reservations, or buy them online. Tickets bought online must be picket up at least one hour in advance at the train station. The basic carriage (plaskard) costs 6.73 manat for upper bed, and 7.81 manat for lower bed (Oct 2017), the middle class (coupe) costs around 12 manat (Oct 2017), and the luxury carriage (SV/Super Vagon) costs 19 manat (Oct 2017). Make sure that you receive all of your change from the ticket counter, as they often try to shortchange foreigners.

By bus or marshrutka[edit]




Marshrutka and departure times
A marshrutkas is a minibus but originally a converted delivery van. Sometimes they may fill up before departure time, so try to be there a little earlier.


By bus: This is one of the more tedious ways to get to Shaki, taking around 6 hours, because the mountain pass used by cars and marshrutkas would be out of the question for such a large bus. Although slower, buses are more comfortable than marshrutkas, although the ones with air conditioning overdo the cold air in a big way. The bus depart daily from Baku International Bus Terminal at 09:00, 11:00, 12:20 and more bus almost every hour till 17:00. The local people usually buy tickets few hours/mins before the departure time. But you can also purchase tickets in days advance at Baku International Bus Terminal in or their website [dead link]. The fare from Baku is 8.40 manat. The bus stop at Shaki Central Bus Station where you can get a taxi or Shaki marshrutka to your next destination easily.
By marshrutka: Marshrutkas run between many of the major cities to the Shaki bus station (avtovağzal). Use your discretion when riding the marshrutkas as the condition of both vehicles and drivers vary—this matters, given the exceptionally steep road, full of sharp curves, that awaits.
The Shaki bus terminal ticket counter open from 06:30-17:00 and 20:00-midnight (holidays 10:30-23:30). Call the cashier at ☏ +994 177 446 17. The ticket vendors at the terminal speak Russian, Turkish, and Azeri.

By taxi[edit]
Until the airport begins operating again, the fastest form of transport between Baku and Shaki is by taxi — it takes about 6 hr and 60 manat. If you share the ride with other people, it will cost around 10 manat per person.
A taxi is also a fine, if more expensive, way to get to Georgia, and you should have no trouble finding a taxi, bus, or marshrutka onward from the border at Lagodekhi to Tbilisi.

Get around[edit]
A residential street by the Caravansarai
On foot[edit]
Though a large city by the standards of Azerbaijan, it's easy enough to get around the city center and all the main sights on foot. The sloping terrain of the city, however, may tax older visitors, but it's also easy to get around using taxis and, for the adventurous, marshrutkas.

By bus or marshrutka[edit]
Buses and marshrutkas operate from 07:00-20:00, charge 30 qapick (as of 2018), and go to many different locations throughout the city. There are 24 routes throughout the city, and most of these buses either stop in the bus terminal, the city center, or the new bazaar. Pay for the ride when getting off the bus.

By taxi[edit]
Taxis charge 2-6 manat and are quite convenient if you know where you want to go within the city. Addresses are quite useless in Azerbaijan as many roads have been renamed since independence, so it's better to direct the driver to a landmark you know of such as a school, hotel, or historic place. Taxi to the train station costs 10 manat.

Talk[edit]
While Shaki is a natural tourist destination, English is not widely spoken, so it would be wise to either bring an Azeri phrasebook and/or brush up on your Azeri, Russian, or Turkish before arriving.

Azerbaijani phrasebook
Russian phrasebook
Turkish phrasebook
The accent of Shaki is a bit quicker than that of standard Azeri and instead of the k sound it is often replaced with a kh. Also, Shaki-specific vocabulary is often used instead of common Azeri vocabulary words.

See[edit]




The Wolf-Man
There is a man that resides in Shaki who walks around the road by the Khansarai with a stuffed wolf covered in a sheet, hoping to entice foreign visitors into a photo-op. It can be quite interesting just to talk to him (if you know Azeri), but otherwise you can take a picture with him and the wolf for the standard fee of 0.4 manat.


In addition to enjoying the views, and wandering the leafy streets, there are two sights in Shaki that you really cannot miss: the Khansarai and the Caravansarai. They're both on the same road, so they're easy enough to visit in one afternoon. If you want to draw out that afternoon, start with a lunch in the Caravansarai courtyard, then head up the hill to the Khansarai, wander around the palace, then stop in the teahouse next door to relax over a cup or two.

Sights[edit]
41.20111147.1936111 Caravansarai, M.F. Akhundov Ave 185. Daily 09:00-13:00. This building was constructed by the Shaki Khans to house caravans as they passed through on the Silk Road to and from China. This was one of 5 such stops in Azerbaijan during the 18th and 19th centuries, and was the biggest caravansarai on the Silk Road in the entire Transcaucasus region. To this day, it still serves as a place for travelers to stay and eat, and also as a place where one can simply admire its beautiful architecture. In addition to being a main sight, it's also one of the city's best hotel options.   
Summer palace of the Shaki Khans
41.2025247.181182 Juma Mosque (Cümə Məscidi) (Right next to the Chelebi Khan restaurant). Daily 06:00-21:00.

This palace, along with the Caravansarai, is one of Shaki's true must-sees. During the city's period of independence as the Shaki Khanate, Khan Hussein constructed the palace, its gardens, and fortifications to serve as the summer palace of the Shaki Khans. The palace is exquisite, inside and out, and the courtyard boasts panoramic views of the city and the surrounding mountain forests. You could make a good half day of this one site, as there are also various museums, parks, and a nice tea house right on the palace grounds. 80 qapick.   
41.21024447.1784484 Silk Factory (İpək Kombinat). Daily 09:00-17:00. Shaki, in addition to being on the Silk Road, has itself been a major silk producer over the past four centuries, and is famous for its various silk products. Shaki's silk factory is about a 15-minute walk from the center of town. It is quite difficult to gain entrance into the factory. There is a store adjoining the factory where vendors sell some fine silk items at lower prices than what you would find at the bazaar. 
Parks and monuments[edit]
 Cultural and Resting Park of BU M.F. Achundov (one block up the street from the new bazaar on west side of the road). This is a nice park to go to and sit after a hard morning of shopping. If you are hungry, you can have a picnic on the park grounds or stop in the nearby Kerpish Restaurant 
 M. Fuzuli Adina Pk (right in the city center). This central park is quite nice during the summer, and it has a couple tea houses where you can kick back and relax.

Shaki Humor
Shaki humor and anecdotes are famous throughout Azerbaijan. During Soviet times there were Joke Festivals and throughout that time Shaki and Gabrovo in Bulgaria were humor sister cities. It is quite hard to understand the jokes, especially the Haci Dayi stories, as they are often quite confusing.

Hiking[edit]
There is endless spectacular hiking to be done throughout the northern region of Azerbaijan, and Shaki proves no exception.

Hike on nearby mountains — Hiking trails start just behind the Khansarai. There is a whole network of the trails on the mountain. However, most of them are still unmarked and not included in any maps. Hike up on the 2,050 m high peak just NE from the town, with great sights over the plains and higher mountains behind. Trails are wide and well "maintained" by the local people who use them for logging and moving the herds.

Upon reaching Bideiz village, you can return via car to Shaki.
Shaki-Kish-"Gelersen-Gorersen" fortress-Shaki — 22 km (14 mi) (10 km/6 mi by car or bus, 12 km/8.5 mi hiking); 6 hr.

After that, ask a local where Genersen Goresen Fortress is located and continue asking as you walk through the village of Kish. This path takes you from Kish to the "Gelersen-Gorersen fortress" through the Kish river and through pine groves with a plethora of varieties of mushrooms growing in the underbrush. Walking to the fortress takes about two hours. There is a tea house 15 minutes outside of the fortress that can serve as a resting point before going up or once descending from the fortress. Once at the fortress, different views of the Kish River can be seen from the peaks of the mountains. The way back from the mountain is a great time to have a picnic beneath the trees on the hills overlooking the valley.

From this area, Shaki can be reached by car or by walking to the Kish road and boarding the number 15 or 23 bus.

 Chelebi Khan, Town center, ☏ +994 177 429 20, +994 050 322 9534. Daily 10:30-00:00. This is one of the best deals for Azerbaijani food in Shaki. Additionally, the samovar tea service alongside walnut preserves, "goz murebbesi," and Shaki Halva is recommended. 3-5 manat.

Regional specialties[edit]
Shaki Halva
Shaki Halva — a special type of baklava called halva, best eaten at a çay xana (tea house) alongside a piping hot cup of tea. The best halva in Shaki according to all of the locals is Eliehmed Confectioneries (Shirinyyet). It is half way up the hill that goes past the Friday Mosque leading up to the Karavan Palace and the Palace of the Shaki Khans. It is across the bridge on the right hand side in a small white building. There is a sign on the road that says Eliehmed Shirinyyet, so it can not be missed. Daily 10:00-17:00.
Shaki Piti — a stew created with meat and potatoes and prepared in a terra cotta pot—well worth a try. The style de cuisine is as follows: first crumble up pieces of bread, pour the sauce into the bowl from the pot, eat the bread and sauce, and finally pour the rest of the stew into your bowl and eat it.
Drink[edit]
Tea houses (Çay Xanalar)[edit]
There is a nice outdoor tea house (çay xana) by the Khansarai, Daily 11:00-23:00, that serves tea and halva to people in their own individual nooks. There is also a tea house inside the walls of the Palace of the Shaki Khans which offers plates of the Shaki speciality halva alongside a pot of tea for 2 manat.
Most çay xanalar also serve local beer (piva)—draft at 50 qapick/glass or bottles at 70 qapick/bottle—or vodka (araq) at 2 manat/bottle. For anything exotic (e.g. tequila, gin, or rum), you will have to go to the Shaki Saray bar and pay Western prices there.





A Cultural Note
Although the çay xana by the Khansarai allows Western women to enter, it is usually forbidden for females to enter such establishments. Drinking in general is also taboo for women anywhere in the country outside of Baku.


Cafés[edit]
The only good coffee to be found (besides Nescafé or McCafe) is in the lobby of the Shaki Saray Hotel. This is where you can get your favorite espresso concoction made by Western-trained staff. The Café Mocha and Cafe Late here are some of the best hot drinks in the regions of Azerbaijan. They also offer a variety of teas.
There is a good Turkish bakery next to the New Bazaar, where you can eat local pastries. The same items can also be ordered next door at the Istanbul Restaurant, which has a nicer atmosphere. Their tastiest cake is the Snickers Cake, although it is a bit pricey (0.5 manat).

Sleep[edit]
You can sleep for pennies in Shaki if you stay in one of the budget options, but you get what you pay for. The lowest-grade options can have rooms with broken toilets, rude staff, etc., in addition to just being ugly. The most obvious overnight location is the Caravansarai hotel, which is reasonably priced and beautiful. Less obvious, but perhaps even more rewarding (for visitors who speak Russian or Azeri) are the home stays.

Bed & breakfast and home stays[edit]
The Albanian Church
Shaki B&B Association, ☏ +994 050 612 6564. This is the least expensive option for staying in Shaki while it is also a great opportunity for interacting with locals. Farhad Azizov is the head of the association; however, he speaks no English so have your Russian or Azeri ready.
Budget[edit]
41.19947847.1980961 Ilgar's Hostel (Илгар хостел), 20 Muslim Magomayev, ☏ +994 556238295, ilqaragayev77@hotmail.com. The friendly owner, Ilgar, offers up to 4 beds. 45 manat (for 3) including breakfast. (updated Aug 2017)
 Azer Petrol Hotel, Dord yol (Dord Yol, by the train station 5 km S of Shaki), ☏ +994 0177-38-225. This is a stop for truck drivers going and coming from Turkey, Tbilisi, and Baku. A small breakfast is included in the price of the hotel. Travelers should avoid this one, since there is no transportation to the city center. 10 manat for a bed, 20 manat for a room. 
 Shail Pansinot (Beach Side Resort), on the W side of the new bazaar, ☏ +994 55370 8560. This is a hotel of second-to-last resort (after the dismal Shaki Hotel). As you would expect, there is no "beach side" to the city of Shaki, as there is no beach.
