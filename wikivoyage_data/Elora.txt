History[edit]
Roman Catholic missionaries first visited this area in the early to mid-1600s "to Christianize" the indigenous people, particularly the Neutral Nation on the old Attiwandaronk Lands. The first European settlers arrived in 1817.
Elora was founded in 1832 by Captain William Gilkison, from Scotland, who was a British officer recently returned from India. He had also served in the War of 1812. He bought 14,000 acres of land on the Grand River and settled on the east side of the river. The plan for the settlement was laid out by Lewis Burwell, in late 1832, when it was called Irvine Settlement. By 1833, Gilkison had opened a sawmill and a general store. The village was renamed Elora when the post office was established in 1839. Gilkison named the community after his brother's ship, which was inspired by the Ellora Caves near Aurangabad, Maharashtra, India.
In the 1850s and 1860s, Elora was a major agricultural marketplace. The flour mill and sawmill were powered by the Grand River. By 1870, several other mills, two distilleries, a carpet factory, tannery and two furniture factories were operating.
Still standing, the five-storey original Elora grist mill from the 1830s was a sawmill, a distillery and a flour mill over the subsequent years. It is now a luxury hotel and spa.
