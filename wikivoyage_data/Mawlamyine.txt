Mawlamyine (also spelled also spelled Mawlamyaing) or Moulmein (Burmese မော်လမြိုင်မြို့) is the capital of Mon State in Southeastern Myanmar.


Understand[edit]
Old mosque in Mawlamyine
Mawlamyine is the fourth biggest city in Myanmar (population about 326,000) and famous for its nearby sights and attractions, especially the largest reclining Buddha in Myanmar 18 km south and the golden rock 20 km north of the city. The first stop for many coming from Thailand, and it is a good starting point for the rest of Myanmar.

Get in[edit]
Coming in from Yangon, Naypyidaw, Mandalay or Bagan with any of the following transports, don't miss out on Bago and/or the Golden Rock in Kyaiktiyo. An overnight stop resting with thousands of other pilgrims on top of the mountain is a great opportunity, but bring ear plugs and a warm sleeping bag. Alternatively, just stay in a guesthouse in Kinpun, the "base camp".

By bus[edit]
16.4783897.63271 The main bus station is on Maung Rd which bypass the city to the east. Most buses will stop (and start from) here, such as:

Hpa-An – From the clock tower the bus takes 2 hr for 1,000 kyat.
Myawaddy – The bus is about 5,000 kyat and takes 3-5 hr.
Yangon – From Aung Mingular Bus Station northwest of Yangon several buses a day leave between 07:30 and 21:00, taking about 5½-7 hr, for about 6,000-8,000 kyat.
Naypyidaw – A Scania bus leaves from the Bawgathiri Highway Station east of Naypyidaw at 19:00 and arrives at 05:00 for about 11,000 kyat.
Mandalay – A quite luxurious (Swedish) overnight bus (company: Shwe Mandalar) leaves at 18:00 from the Highway Bus Station south of Mandalay. It includes a towel, pillow, blanket toothbrushes and water, and arrives in Mawlamyine at 05:00, with at least two stops on the way. It does most of its way on the new highway between Mandalay and Yangon. Up to 15,000 kyat.
Dawei – The bus leaves Dawei at 10:00 and 17:00, and costs 12,000 kyat.
By pick-up/shared taxi[edit]
Most non-bus transportation into Mawlamyine coming from the northeastern main road will drop off their passengers at 16.45279997.6353952 the main junction from where also most traffic travels further south.
The trip from Myawaddy is about 12,000 kyat (shared taxi) and a very bumpy ride, taking somewhere between 3-5 h. A big part of the distance is gravel road. You can pay in Thai ฿ (but there are plenty of currency exchange people and ATMs close to the border control).

On the train between Mawlamyine and Dawei
Shared taxis will drop you off at your lodging.

By train[edit]
The 16.47145497.6351013 train station has up to three (bumpy) trains a day coming in from Yangon, Bago and Kyaikto, arriving at 04:00, 06:00 and 16:30. and starting in Yangon and Bago about 9 h or 7 h earlier, respectively. The price for upper class is only 4,250 kyat for the full distance of 281 km from Yangon. Tickets go on sale 3 days before departure at the downtown ticket office.

By boat[edit]
There are boats travelling between Hpa-An and Mawlamyine, but they're more expensive than bus or train: 70,000 kyat (private charter) or 10,000 kyat per person (shared, still this price as of Feb 2019). Nevertheless, they provide a scenic trip up/down the river. Elegant Myanmar sell tickets on their 08:30 sailing from their office next to Ykko, south of the night market. Alternatively ask at your own guest house, or at Breeze Inn Guesthouse who may still operate a boat. Journey times are listed as 4 hours. In the dry season it could be as little as 2 hours, or it could take 5 hours including a mandatory stop at a small village to visit a monastery + temple (Feb 2019).


Get around[edit]
16°29′25″N 97°37′13″EMap of Mawlamyine
On foot[edit]
Walking around can be an option in the centre, but Mawlamyine stretches over 5.5 km along the river.

By motobike[edit]
Motorbike-taxis, trishaws, pick-ups are available all over town, especially at the central market. Just "appear" to be lost and someone will offer you a ride, which should cost no more than 350 kyat in town.
Do not pay more than 700 kyat for the transport from the bus station, train station or the main junction to the city centre (motorbike/trishaw). Tuk-tuk drivers might ask up to 3,000 kyat for the two mile ride, which is too much.

By tour[edit]
You can also take a tour with a tuktuk around the area for 25.000 Kyat (3-4 hr)—but half of that is probably more reasonable. You can tell the driver which places you want to visit. 

See[edit]
Many of Mawlamyine's famous sights are outside of the city, but visiting all sights in the city (including the markets and restaurants) can take a day.

Kyaik Tan Lan Pagoda at night
16.48929397.6284411 Kyaik Tan Lan Pagoda. Up on the hill and famous for its nice views and a great sunset point is this pagoda on the hill in the north(east)ern part of the city. 
16.49245997.6277782 Mahamuni Paya (next (north) of Kyaik Tan Lan Pagoda that overlooks Mawlamyine). Pagoda which contains a century-old replica of the Buddha in Mahamuni Paya in Mandalay (famous for the early morning face washing). Here you can get a nicer view of the Buddha, woman are allowed to get closer and there are fewer tourists compared to Mandalay but without the washing ceremony. However, the gold cover of the Buddha is not nearly as thick as in Mandalay. 
16.47273597.6030033 Ogre Island (Bilu Island) (small ferry boats leave every 10 minutes from the Jetty next to Help Grandmother restaurant). An island across the river from Mawlamyine, known for cottage industries such as weaving, chalkboards, pipes, hats and rubber bands. A guide is necessary as the island is spread out over an area the size of Singapore. You can arrange a tour from Breeze Inn Guesthouse (18,000 kyat per person) or simply arrive on shore and ask around for an English speaking moto driver. High tide in the mornings means disembarking into watery mud, so it is best to wear sandals. 600 kyat ferry ride. 
Shampoo Island
16.5073197.6219374 Gaung Say Kyun / Shampoo Island with the Sandawshin Pagoda (at the river, 50 m to the right of the bridge). Small island with its own pagoda and nice river view. 3,000 kyat for the boat, but cheaper if you wait for more people. 
16.511297.61795 Thanlwin Bridge (Mawlamyine). This 2-mile long bridge was built in 2005 and is the second longest in Myanmar. (updated Jul 2020)
Churches: St Patrick's (1829); St Matthew's (1887), abandoned & locked; First Baptist (1827); Holy Family (1954)
North[edit]
16.64199997.5027996 Nwa-La-Boh Pagoda. The main attraction of this pagoda is a golden rock formation, similar to Kyaiktiyo, but on a smaller scale. However, due its shape and balance (3 stones on top of each other) this golden rock is equally impressive. If you go in low season and on a work day, there is a fair chance that you will be the only person there.To go there you can get pick-ups from the roundabout south of the bridge. Locals pay about 500 kyat one-way, but tourist may be charged 1,000 kyat. Taxis offer you the same trip for 8,000 kyat return, but you can get them down to 5,000 kyat.Near Kyaun Ka Village exactly 19.7 km north from the roundabout take the 16.60713597.5111831 concrete track to the right up and by the pagoda, 6.7 km away not accounting for the elevation. You hike up and down, at least 1.5-2.5 hr each way; bring enough water, good shoes and sunblock as the heat and humidity are high. Alternatively or you can try to get a work truck (2,000 kyat per person return) but higher in the low season if they available at all. Going back from the main road is easy, just hail for a pick-up or any car that passes by. 500 kyat camera fee. 
South[edit]
The best way to explore the surrounding and especially southern area and sights is by scooter or motorbike. In the order of distance from Mawlamyine are these destinations:

16.41517597.6557447 Shwe Nat Taung Pagoda (4.8 km from the main junction). On top of a hill offering picturesque views ideal for pictures. 
16.37105497.6737558 Pa-Auk Tawya Monastery (take a local pick-up 10 km south from the main junction). An enormous, tranquil meditation centre with friendly people. Arrive by 10:00 to walk to the eating hall for an 11:00 meal with hundreds of monks and a few foreigners studying meditation. 
16.32156497.7094669 Hindu Temple (the hill east of the main road, before Laung Taw Mu Pha Ya). 
16.31719897.70581810 Kyauk Ta Lone (the hill west of the main road, before Laung Taw Mu Pha Ya). This hill offers a great view of the surrounding area and even a sneak peak of the famous Buddha. It is great for sunsets. There are two tops, only one is allowed for women. There is an old, open shed on top where you can even stay overnight, although a mosquito net, mattress and sleeping bag are recommended. It takes about 20-30 min to climb. 
Face of the reclining Buddha
16.32223597.72328511 The worlds largest reclining Buddha (Win Sein Taw Ya) (7.8 km south of the Pa-Auk Tawya Monastery along the main road). Besides the golden rock in Kyaiktiyo this is probably the most famous sight in the Mon State. Whilst no longer the largest in the world, it is still the largest reclining Buddha in Myanmar. Dozens of monk statues escort the track from the main road towards the reclining Buddha. Arriving at the sight the sheer size of the Buddha (more than 100 m) is quite impressive. Opposite lies another but older one. Due to its size you will have to walk around to find a good spot for taking pictures. 
A one-way pick-up to the Buddha should be around 500 kyat, at least for locals. A taxi is about 4,000 kyat one way or 7,000 kyat return.

16.24668997.73383812 Kan Gyi Lake and Pagoda (26 km south of Mawlamyine and just south of Mudon). Rumour is, nobody knows how deep is this lake. Don't feel tempted to find out. Women are not allowed to swim: otherwise, it is believed, something terrible will happen. The lake can be easily circumnavigated by foot. 
Do[edit]
Rent a scooter or motorbike and explore the surrounding area, especially south.
Take a boat up or down the river.
