Seaside Heights is a borough with almost 3,000 residents (2019) in the New Jersey Shore region. Seaside Heights is a beach town on a barrier island that faces the Atlantic Ocean on the east and Barnegat Bay on the west. It is connected to the mainland community of Toms River via the Thomas A. Mathis Bridge (New Jersey Route 37) over the bay. Seaside Park, directly to the south on the same island, is also covered in this article.


Understand[edit]
Get in[edit]
Seaside Heights
By car[edit]
From New York, Northern and Southern New Jersey, travel along the Garden State Parkway until you reach Exit 82 East for Route 37. Then, take Route 37 East for 9 miles over the bridge into Seaside Heights. The trip from New York City is about 80 miles and will probably take you close to 2 hours. If you are coming from Atlantic City, you would go about 60 miles north and should expect to spend more than 1 hour on the road.
From Philadelphia, take the Benjamin Franklin Bridge and follow signs for New Jersey Route 70 East. Take Route 70 until its junction with Route 37 East in Lakehurst, NJ.  Continue on Route 37 and follow it over the bridge into Seaside Heights. The trip is about 65 miles and takes at least 1½ hours, but allow more time in case of traffic.
During the summer months, traffic from all directions is heavy.  Traffic can vary depending on the time, day and month.  Listen to local radio stations, such as WOBM 1160AM, to find out information about traffic patterns, accidents, and shortcuts.  Tourist traffic usually begins in late May and continues until early September.

Get around[edit]
By foot[edit]
The total area of Seaside Heights is 0.8 square miles. Because of this, many residents and visitors like to get their exercise by walking along the boardwalk or any other destination especially during the months of May until September.

By bike[edit]
It is common to see residents and tourists riding their bikes along the boardwalk during the summer months. Bikes are also ridden within the town to and from various destinations. Because Seaside Heights is less than a mile in total area, it is easy to get exercise and travel at the same time.

By car[edit]
When the weather begins to get a little colder and the summer is coming to an end, more and more people turn to their cars for transportation. Although Seaside Heights is not large, it is quick to reach a destination by car. Traffic can be hectic during the summer months, but it tends to slow down as September begins. Generally, parking costs $1 to $2 per hour at metered parking lots from April to October. Free parking is available year round at Grant Ave, at the town entrance, but be prepared to walk at least 4 blocks to get to the boardwalk.

By taxi[edit]
Taxi services are not really necessary during the daytime, but are usually used at night by those who take advantage of the bar scene. They are sometimes used by those who are in a real rush and do not have a car nearby.

By tramcars[edit]
This type of transportation can only be found on the boardwalk. It is a family friendly way to get around and see the boardwalk at its best.
