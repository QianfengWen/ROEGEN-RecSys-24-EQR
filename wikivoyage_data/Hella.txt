It was blessed with a beautiful setting, like a green oasis in the desert with the calm and beautiful Rangá river passing through and the stunning view to the surrounding highlands all around. Hella's economy relies on tourism, as well as the chicken factory, slaughter house, glass factory and horse breeding. The volcano Hekla is in the vicinity.
