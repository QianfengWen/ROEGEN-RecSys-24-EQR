St. Catharines is a city of 137,000 people (2021) in the Niagara Peninsula of Ontario. It has the Welland Canal, a dry-dock for ships, and automotive plants. A pond near the mouth of the first Welland Canal now hosts regional and national rowing championships every year. Three World Rowing Championships have been held here: in 1970, 1999, and 2010, with another planned in 2024. 


Understand[edit]
Montebello Park
It is a shame that St. Catharines is overlooked by most tourists visiting Niagara Falls and Niagara-on-the-Lake as it has a lot to offer. St. Catharines offers better value and quality for food and accommodation than the nearby tourist destinations which are only 10-20 minutes away.
Manufacturing is the city's dominant industry, as noted by the  motto, "Industry and Liberality". General Motors of Canada, the Canadian subsidiary of General Motors, used to be the city's largest employer, a distinction now held by the District School Board of Niagara. St. Catharines lies on one of the main telecommunications backbones between Canada and the United States, and as a result a number of call centres operate in the city.

History[edit]
The city was settled by United Empire Loyalists fleeing the American Revolution in the 1780s. The Crown granted land in compensation for services and for losses in the United States. Secondary to water routes, Native trails provided transportation networks, resulting in the present-day radial road pattern from the city centre. The surrounding land was surveyed and townships created between 1787 and 1789.
Loyalists troops from New York State and settled the area in 1784, the Crown distributed free Government supplies for 2 years to the resettled Loyalists. Merchant Robert Hamilton of Queenston then took over the distribution, and became wealthy by expropriating lands from subsistence Loyalist settlers who were incapable of settling their debts.
The first Welland Canal was constructed from 1824 to 1833 behind what is now known as St. Paul Street, using Twelve Mile and Dick's Creek. The canal established St. Catharines as the hub of commerce and industry for the Niagara Peninsula.
Incorporated as a village in 1845, St. Catharines had a population of about 3500 in 1846. The primary industry was flour milling. Other industry included ship repairs, four grist mills, a brewery, three distilleries, a tannery, a foundry, a machine and pump factory.

British Methodist Episcopal Church, Salem Chapel
William Hamilton Merritt, a Loyalists from New York State, played a role in making St. Catharines a centre of abolitionist activity. In 1855, the British Methodist Episcopal Church, Salem Chapel was established at the corner of Geneva and North streets, on land granted to the congregation by Merritt in the early 1840s. The area became known to refugee slaves from the United States as a place of "refuge and rest"; it was a destination, one of the final stops in Canada on the Underground Railroad for refugee African-American slaves. During this time, abolitionist Harriet Tubman lived in St. Catharines. By the mid-1850s, the town's population was about 6,000, 800 of whom were of African descent. St. Catharines remains an important place in Black Canadian history.

Climate[edit]
Morningstar Mill and DeCew Falls
St. Catharines' has a unique micro-climate because of the moderating influence of Lake Ontario/Lake Erie and the sheltering effect of the Niagara Escarpment to the south; these allow wineries to flourish. As a result, the city records numerous frost-free days and frequent thaws in the winter, although it sometimes receives heavy lake-effect snow during certain wind conditions, and micro-cooling lakeside on some spring afternoons. The summer season is predominantly warm, and sometimes hot, with an average high temperature of 27 °C (81 °F) in July. Summer thunderstorms are commonplace but generally less prevalent and less severe than further west in southern Ontario due to the diminishing effect of the surrounding lakes.

Drink[edit]
There are two primary bar areas in the city: Port Dalhousie and downtown. Generally, Port Dalhousie is the active bar scene during the warm summer months, and downtown is the prime location for nightlife in the winter. The downtown area also has its fill of bars, likely more than twenty. Everything from small pubs to large dance clubs fill the area, although almost every bar has a laid-back feel (with matching laid-back clothing requirements.) There has been a bit of an upscale trend lately, with the addition of a few martini bars. It's a bigger area to cover than up in Port, but even still it's quite easy to walk from a bar at one end of downtown to another at the opposite end.

43.156816-79.2450251 The Merchant Ale House, 98 St. Paul St, ☏ +1 905-984-4060, info@merchantalehouse.com. Daily 11AM to 2AM (kitchen closes at 11PM). Possibly the best hang out pub in the city.
