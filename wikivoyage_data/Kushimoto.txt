Kushimoto (串本町 Kushimoto-chō) is a small coastal town in Wakayama Prefecture in the Kansai region of Japan. It is a useful base for exploring and enjoying the activities of the prefecture's extreme south. In relation, the town sits on the southernmost point of Japan's main island of Honshu, which serves as tourist attraction itself.

Get in[edit]
By Train[edit]
The town is served by Kushimoto Station (串本駅 Kushimoto Eki).
From Kyoto, Osaka, and Wakayama, the quickest way to reach Kushimoto is via limited express train, either on the Kuroshio (くろしお), Super Kuroshio (スーパーくろしお), or Ocean Arrow (オーシャンアロー) services. Cheaper but slower train service is also available and will require one or more transfers. Both express and local services go via the JR Hanwa Line (阪和線), directly connecting to the JR Kinokuni Line (きのくに線), which is also sometimes labeled as the JR Kisei Line (紀勢線). Total fare from Wakayama City via limited express is ¥4170 (about 2hr 10min) and via local is ¥2520 (about 3 hr 40 min).
Insider's Tip: on Kushimoto bound trains, ask for a seat on the right side (右側 migi-gawa) of the train to ensure unobstructed views of the coast. Moreover, a viewing car open to all passengers is available on all Ocean Arrow trains.
From Nagoya, the best way to reach Kushimoto via train is through the limited express Nanki (南紀) leading to Kii-Katsuura Station (紀伊勝浦駅), then transferring to a local train bound for Kushimoto or Kii-Tanabe Station (紀伊田辺駅).  This costs ¥9470 and takes about 4hr 30min. Local train travel from Nagoya is not recommended.
Train services run roughly once per hour from the big cities. All lines are run by JR, and Japan Rail Pass holders are covered when riding them.

By Car[edit]
Driving is a viable (and highly recommended) option, and it will be very useful to have a car when exploring the area. From Wakayama City onward, take the tolled Hanwa Expressway (阪和自動車道) southbound for Shirahama (白浜). Exit at Nanki-Tanabe Interchange (南紀田辺IC), which is the last exit, and get on Route 42 bound for Shingu (新宮) following it all the way to Kushimoto. Driving time from the exit is about 2½ hours.
From Nagoya, follow the Higashi Meihan (東名阪自動車道) and Ise Expressways (伊勢自動車道) to get to the Kisei Expressway (紀勢自動車道). Exit at Omiya-Odai Interchange (大宮大台IC), which is the last exit, and get on Route 42 bound for Shingu (新宮) following it all the way to Kushimoto. Driving time from the exit is about 6 hours.
Once off the expressway, the route has many winds and turns and follows the coast very closely, and at some points it's quite a steep drop to the ocean, so use extreme caution when driving especially in bad weather. During the summer months, the expressways and Route 42 are heavily traveled by beach-goers coming from the Osaka area, particularly on weekends and holidays. this causes lengthy delays, as the roads are not meant for heavy traffic.

By Air[edit]
The nearest airport is Nanki-Shirahama Airport in the town of Shirahama (白浜) about 2 hours away. There are daily flights to/from Tokyo-Haneda Airport, but international routes are not served. Take a bus to Shirahama Station (白浜駅) take one of the limited express trains mentioned above to get into town.
The nearest international airport is Kansai International Airport. Take a train or limousine bus to Wakayama Station (和歌山駅) and transfer onto one of the limited express trains mentioned above to get into town.

Get around[edit]
Anything in Central Kushimoto is easily accessible by foot, however the more interesting attractions outside town will not.  Taxis are available at Kushimoto Station.

Route 38 - main road for Koza, follows the Koza River. Starts off of Route 42 and eventually connects to Route 371.

Talk[edit]
Though the local Kushimoto dialect (串本弁 Kushimoto-ben) shares many traits with the bigger, regional Kansai dialect (関西弁 Kansai-ben), it naturally has its own unique peculiarities. Locals claim that their dialect remains very close to the language spoken in Nara- and Heian-period Japan. If you have a decent command of Japanese, you might consider using some of the following phrases to score some laughs, brownie points, or maybe even a free beer with the locals:

あがら (標準:わたしたち) we
あたんする (標準:八つ当たりする) get angry suddenly
いくで (標準:いくよ) I'm going... (で can be used with most verbs you would use よ with)
かいだるい (標準:疲れた) tiring, tired
がい (標準:ですよ) You know...!
がいに (標準:強く) strongly
くらんし (標準:ください) Please...
まいせー (標準:やめておけ) Don't do that!
Other standard Kansai phrases should also get some smiles out of people.
