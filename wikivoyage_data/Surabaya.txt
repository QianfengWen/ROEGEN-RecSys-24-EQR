Surabaya (Surabaya Javanese: ꦯꦸꦫꦧꦪ Suroboyo) is a city on the eastern side of Java, the capital of the East Java province of Indonesia. It is the second largest city in the country with over 10 million inhabitants in its metropolitan area. Complementing Jakarta, its larger brother on the western side of the same island, it sits close enough geographically to be exposed by the Javanese culture, while large enough to hold its people of multicultural backgrounds.

Downtown Surabaya

Understand[edit]
According to folklore, Surabaya's name derives from the Javanese words Suro, meaning shark, and Boyo, meaning crocodile. With over 2 million people, Surabaya is the second-largest city in Indonesia. While many people come for business, Surabaya is also a gateway city for Mount Bromo and Bali. The city's tree-lined streets and renovated pavements will impress those newly arrived from other cities in the archipelago, though in general the city's attractions tend to be more apparent to those who make it their home rather than to short-term visitors. Put in the effort here, and you'll have an authentic, fascinating, unique experience of an Asia that once was: get it while it lasts.

Climate[edit]
Very tropical and you need to wear casual, light clothes: T-shirts, shorts, sandals or shoes. Temperatures vary little through the year, with daytime highs around 32-34°C, falling at night to 22-26°C. During the rainy season (November–April) be prepared for occasional flash floods and traffic jams, and sometimes its almost as bad as Jakarta.

Community[edit]

Being simultaneously one of the most ancient and significant trading ports in Indonesia, a post Dutch-colonial city (the Dutch knew it as Soerabaja), and having passed through brief Japanese control during WWII, Surabaya has a complex and patchwork heritage. It's not unusual to meet Surabaya locals with heritage from other parts of Indonesia, all parts of south-eastern China, the Middle East or Europe. Surabaya was also one of the only places in Indonesia with a synagogue; it was demolished in 2013.

Talk[edit]




How to speak prokem like a Java
The everyday speech of Surabayan (Javanese) is liberally laced with slang (prokem) expressions. Like any slang, words come in and out of fashion with bewildering rapidity, but some features can be distinguished:

Nya becomes né
The prefix me- for verbs becomes ng-
The suffixes -i and -kan turn into -in
A short glossary of common Surabayan expressions:

no
tidak → mboten/ora
yes
ya → nggih/iyo/yo
I
saya/aku → kulo/aku
you
kamu/anda → sampéan/kon
sorry
maaf → ngapunten
to come up
menaik → naék/naik
to take
mengambil → ngambil
to look
melihat → ningali/ndelok
to use
memakai/menggunakan → paké/makai/maké
to visit
mengunjungi → nyambangi/mêthuk
what are you doing?
kamu sedang apa? → sampéan lagi ngopo?
to pay
membayar → bayar
how much is it?
berapa harganya?  →  piro rék hargané?

While the Chinese were the first to record the area in the 13th century under the name 重迦廬 (zhonggala; apparently after the then-current local kingdom Jungala), local Chinese now know the city as 泗水 (sishui), while some further afield call it by a transliterated name 苏腊巴亚 (sulabaya).

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
-7.380556112.7666671 Juanda International Airport (SUB  IATA) (about 12 km south-east of the city). There are two terminals: Terminal 1 (north of the runway) is the Domestic Terminal, and Terminal 2 (south of the runway) is the International Terminal (with some exceptions for Garuda Indonesia and Indonesia AirAsia flights). There is a free 15-minutes shuttle that links the two terminals.   
To reach the Purabaya Bus Terminal a few kilometers west, there is a Damri Bus that leaves from both terminals and costs Rp 25,000 per person.

By train[edit]
B1239 steam tram locomotive, a train monument in Pasar Turi station
The national rail operator Kereta Api[dead link] runs multiple daily trains from Jakarta and several other cities in Java, with both daytime and overnight services available.
Surabaya has two main station for long distance trains, -7.24828112.7311222 Surabaya Pasar Turi and -7.265516112.7519983 Surabaya Gubeng, both located at the heart of downtown Surabaya. Pasar Turi serves executive air-conditioned trains from Jakarta, Semarang, and all of Java's northern coast; while Gubeng is the terminus station for mainly economy class trains and trains for southern and eastern Java, including Yogyakarta, Bandung, and Banyuwangi for the ferry to Bali. Slow and packed local economy-class trains from Malang arrive at -7.242993112.7407484 Surabaya Kota station (also known as Semut) and passing through Gubeng station as they come in from the south.
Seats in Eksekutif (first class) and Bisnis (second class) for any intercity journey can be reserved from 90 days in advance up to 24 hours before departure at any major railway station in Java through e-kiosks serve by yourself. It same with online reserved by minimarket attendant of Alfamart and Indomart and the payment in minimarket can be done by cash also without any additional fee. On the last 24 hours before departure, the ticket is only available in the ticket counter at departure station. Senior citizens ages 60 and above are eligible for a 20% discount when the ticket is bought in this time bracket.

By boat[edit]
Gapura Surya Nusantara ferry terminal in Tanjung Perak harbour
The main harbour is -7.19797112.7342765 Tanjung Perak, at the northern end of Jl. Perak Timur road is about 4 km north of downtown.

Angkutan Sungai Danau dan Penyeberangan (ASDP): Daily ferry service from Ujung Kamal and Madura
Pelayaran Nasional Indonesia (PELNI): Runs passenger ships from a large number of port cities throughout Indonesia.
By bus[edit]
Surabaya has frequent bus connections from all parts of East Java and from major cities in other parts of Java and beyond. The main bus terminal is at -7.350831112.7247296 Purabaya Bus Terminal (also known as Bungurasih), about 10 km south of the city.
Note: The names "Purabaya Terminal" and "Bungurasih Terminal" are used interchangeably to refer to Surabaya's main bus terminal. "Purabaya" is the correct name but it is sometimes called "Bungurasih" because it is located in Bungurasih.
There are many people inside the terminal trying to solicit passengers to the bus of the company from which they get a commission, and they are especially bothersome to the foreigners. If you follow them to the bus, you are likely to get offered an inflated (Rp 200,000 or even more to Bali) price, even though there's an official price list (you can see it at the exit to the platform). Ticket offices do not guarantee you to be safe from overcharging - most of them are private, and there's no price posted on the window, so shop around. It may make sense to bargain if the price is certainly too high. Prices may be slightly higher during high-demand periods like weekends and public holidays.
There are frequent buses from Malang (Rp 30,000 for air conditioned, less for "ekonomi") and Probolinggo (for Mount Bromo, Rp 30,000), so just turn up.
To Denpasar in Bali, fair price is Rp 200,000-280,000 by eksekutif night bus, including the ferry trip between Banyuwangi and Gilimanuk, mineral water and a meal. Buses depart from Bungurasih bus terminal in Surabaya, and arrive in Mengwi bus terminal in Denpasar. Duration: 10-12 hr.
A ticket to Jakarta should cost Rp 250,000-350,000 in eksekutif bus. On average, eksekutif bus bound for Jakarta will head to Jakarta via the Trans-Java Toll Road, which allows direct travel from Surabaya to Jakarta via toll roads more quickly. The travel time for eksekutif bus via the Trans-Java Toll Road generally ranges from 10-12 hours with 1 or 2 rest stops on the way (20–30 minutes each), and at least some traffic jams near Jakarta.
Another option is to go by minibus (known in Indonesia as travel). A number of companies run door-to-door minibus services from and to major destinations in Java, including Malang and Yogyakarta. These services are both more convenient and more expensive than public buses. Seats can be booked in advance through company offices, and also through many hotels and travel agents.

-7.27898112.735977 Cititrans bus shop (Cititrans - Surabaya), Jl. R.A Kartini No.58, DR. Soetomo, Kec. Tegalsari. Shop has aircon and toilet. Solo Rp 180,000 (executive minibus 8 seats, large, reclining, AC, usb-a+c power plug, about 4 hours, 20 min break), Yogyakarta Rp 205,000 (about 5 hours), Jakarta Rp 450,000 (about 12 hr 30 min). (updated May 2024)
By car[edit]
Surabaya is well connected from a few of Java island's large cities, thanks to the Trans-Java toll road. Surabaya is reachable in 12 hours from the west end of the island at the Merak ferry crossing to Sumatra, 9 hours from Jakarta, 4 hours from Semarang, 3.5 hours from Solo, 2 hours from Ngawi and less than 1.5 hours from Malang. From the neighboring Madura Island, the Suramadu bridge crosses the Madura strait, for free.

Get around[edit]

By taxi[edit]
Taxis are plentiful on the streets of Surabaya. Some taxis are not renowned for their reliability so stick to the well known firms:

 Blue Bird Group, ☏ +62 31 3721234. 
 Orenz Taxi, ☏ +62 31 8799999. 
 Silver and Express. 
 Zebra Taxi, ☏ +62 31 8416666. 
Always insist on a metered fare. Figure on Rp 20,000 for a cross-town trip and Rp 70,000 to the airport. Drivers will expect a minimum fare of Rp 15,000 for short trips and for longer trips, pay the fare shown on the meter rounded up to the nearest multiple of Rp 1,000. Drivers will appreciate a tip of a few thousand rupiah. Blue Bird has increased its minimum payment to Rp 25,000, but it's still the most reliable taxi company.
A trip from Stasiun Gubeng to Pasar Keputran should cost around Rp 20,000.

By becak[edit]
Becak (cycle rickshaw) are a traditional form of transportation in Surabaya. Surprisingly, they are still visible everywhere in the city outskirts, unlike throughout most of Southeast Asia where they have nearly vanished already. Expect to pay around Rp 5,000 for a short-hop, or Rp 10,000 for a few blocks, Rp 20,000 for a multi-block haul. Drivers may not want to go a long way, and if it's stinking hot have a heart and pay them some more money. Some of them have sun and rain covers, though these can be a bit low at times. Also, they can vary quite a bit in width: if you are 'big boned' you might need one to yourself.
Also available Becak Motor (cycle which powered by motor cycle engine).

By ride-hailing[edit]
Also available : Gocar & Gojek, Grab car & Grab bike.

While they do not accept cash as a form of payment, to help protect the environment passengers may exchange 3 large plastic bottles, 5 small plastic bottles or 10 plastic glasses for a ticket.
This is a large populous city and buses are usually crowded. There are two class of bus: standard buses which are usually very full and patas buses (supposed to be first class, but it is still... a bus.)

By minibus[edit]
Bemos (public minibus) in Surabaya are called bemo or lin. They are plentiful in Surabaya and routes are distinguished by their color.
You need to know the routes to specific destination and beware of pickpockets, as it's not safe.

By car[edit]
There are many car rental companies. To rent a car with a driver for one day might cost Rp 250,000-500,000, depending on the type of car and the length of the trip. For a full day trip, it is customary to buy lunch for the driver, or give some extra money for the driver to buy cigarettes, a snack, or coffee. Don't forget to pay for parking and toll fees and gas (unless you have already negotiated this into your initial price).

Stay safe[edit]
As with any big city, never let your guard down, because big cities such as Surabaya have a reputation among Indonesians for a mid crime rate. That said, Surabaya has few real dangers for visitors apart from the perils of crossing the very busy roads (the secret is to raise an arm while crossing, and to progress with a predictable speed and bearing, allowing the traffic to flow around you). Don't walk on the streets, especially at night other than the CBD area, if you can avoid it since you won't have anything to sightsee. Bring along your face mask if you travel by foot during rush hour since the traffic will be chaos and the air pollution is bad (16:30 to 18:30). Be polite to the people, since Surabayans tend to swear easily which is very common.  Do not easily trust people you have just met, even if they look friendly.

Several hotels also provide free hotspots in their lobby. All major hotels provide internet access in one or more ways; simply ask them about this when you make your booking.
Alternatively, if you have a compatible 4G mobile phone and a laptop, tethering to your PC is the quickest way to gain internet access although speeds might not impress. Note that prepaid SIM cards can be purchased very easily and cheap, and that service activation is completed on the user's phone very quickly. Once activated, recharge with credits as necessary. Internet access is usually available at this stage; refer to your phone's user manual for tethering instructions. Operators will usually offer internet packets that offer cheaper access fees-instructions to access these services are available in the booklet that comes with your SIM card (i.e. XL's services are accessible by dialing *123#). BlackBerry Internet Service is readily available and can be registered similarly on the prepaid SIM.
Internet cafes are available in many parts of the city with a price of Rp 4,000-5,000 per hour. However, most of the internet cafes can be found around universities, and in most shopping malls.
Internet speeds in Surabaya are rarely fast, regardless of your connection. They are usually sufficient to make decent Whatsapp voice calls, although HD video calling may not be possible. Temporarily disabling software updates (Windows Update, security software updates, Adobe Updater, etc.) may help maximise access speeds.

This park runs of the most successful Javan tiger conservation programs in Asia. This park is not like an ordinary zoo. You must drive through the park in your own car or in the sightseeing bus provided within the park, passing an interesting and amusing collection of local and international animals clustered within areas themed according to their original habitat - Americas, Asia, Africa, and Indonesia. There's also a food court, mechanical and animal rides, a petting zoo, and animal shows. The park is usually crowded on weekends and public holidays. However, it is mostly deserted on weekdays.
