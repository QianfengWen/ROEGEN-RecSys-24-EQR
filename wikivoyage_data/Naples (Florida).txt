The best way to get around Naples is to rent a car. Alternatively, you can rent a bike, and there are bike lanes on many of the major roads (though they are seldom used). If you stay in "Old Naples" (the historic district), then it is very easy to get to shopping centers, the pier, and the beach.

26.1316-81.80772 Naples City Pier, 25 12th Ave S. One of the most popular attractions in town, the thousand-foot-long pier was destroyed by Hurricane Ian in 2022.  The pier was originally built in the late 19th century, and has been rebuilt several times, usually taking about three years to complete. No fishing license was required to cast a line from the pier (no fishing on Sundays or overnight). You can still watch the dolphins and take amazing photos of the sunsets over the Gulf of Mexico from the beach. (updated Sep 2022)
