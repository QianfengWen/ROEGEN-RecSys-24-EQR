Dmitrov is a small millennial city in Russia, located some 65 km (40 mi) north of the capital Moscow. It has some 60,000 inhabitants and is renowned for its old and beautiful kremlin.


Understand[edit]
Dmitrov was founded in 1154 by Yury Dolgoruky (Yury Long-hand) at the site where his son Vsevolod the Big Nest was born. Its name is derived from Vsevolod's patron saint St. Demetrius. It was given town rights in 1374. During the early 16th century Dmitrov flourished and the Assumption Cathedral in the kremlin and the monastery cathedral of Sts. Boris and Gleb were constructed. However, in 1569 the city was seized by the secret police "Oprichnina" and went into a decline, which was further accelerated during the "Time of Troubles", when the city was sacked by Polish troops. The city was on the frontier during both the Napoleonic wars and World War II (known as the first and second great patriotic wars in Russia). The renowned Russian anarchist Piotr Kropotkin resided in the city between the Russian revolution in 1917 and his death in 1921. During the 1930s the Moscow channel was constructed, passing through the western part of Dmitrov.
