Troon is a seaside town in Ayrshire in southwest Scotland, with a population of 14,950 in 2020. It's about 50 miles from Glasgow so it's one of the closest beach resorts to the city, and is crowded on fine summer weekends. Another major attraction is golf, best known being the Royal Troon Golf Club which regularly hosts the Open. Troon is also a transport hub and base for exploring the rest of Ayrshire, including the islands of Arran and Great Cumbrae.


Understand[edit]
"Troon" probably derives from a Pictish word meaning "rocky headland", and it developed as a port at a time when Glasgow could not. In the early 19th century the Ayrshire coal mining industry was growing - big profits if you could ship the coal out. Troon was therefore built as a planned town and harbour, connected to Kilmarnock by Scotland's first railway. Ship building and other heavy industries were also established here and at other small ports along the Clyde coast. It was only in the 1880s that a deep-water channel was blasted up the Clyde to enable Glasgow to grow and overshadow these earlier ports. But the bonus was a big city population keen to escape at weekends "doon the watter", so Troon evolved into a seaside resort on the "Costa Clyde", the "Glesca Riviera". It still handles freight but no longer has regular ferries, though it sometimes serves as a diversionary port if rough weather closes some other harbour.

Reaching Troon by public transport usually involves travelling via Glasgow.
By plane: The best local airport is Glasgow (GLA IATA), with flights from UK, Europe, and Canada; places beyond (such as the United States) are better served from Manchester MAN and the London airports. From GLA to Troon, travel via central Glasgow. The other airport, Prestwick (PIK IATA), is much closer but only has budget flights to the Med, so few visitors arrive that way.
By train: Trains run from Glasgow Central every 30 min daily, taking 50 min via Paisley Gilmour Street, Kilwinning and  Irvine, and continuing south to Prestwick Airport and town, and  Ayr. The last train out of Glasgow is at 11:30PM. 
55.5428-4.65531 Troon railway station was destroyed by fire in 2021. All trains are running and calling as normal, but there are only makeshift facilities for tickets, toilets and so on, plus upheaval from demolition and rebuilding. The new station is due to open some time in 2024.
Barassie is a platform halt a mile north of Troon where some trains from Glasgow stop. You might use it for the north beach or golf course.
By bus: direct buses from Glasgow have been axed, so from Buchanan station either take the X77 and change at Prestwick, the X76 and change at Kilmarnock, or the X44 and change at Irvine; any of these routes will take about 90 min. From Belfast, take the direct bus towards Glasgow and change at Ayr.
Stagecoach Bus 10 runs from Kilmarnock hourly via Dundonald and Muirhead to Troon (55 min) and Barassie.
Bus 14 runs every 45 min from Irvine via Muirhead and Barassie to Troon (35 min) and continues to Prestwick and Ayr. Change at Irvine for the 585, which follows the coast to Ardrossan, West Kilbride and Largs.
The main bus stop is at the angle of West Portland St with South Beach. It's a just a bus shelter. 
By car: From Glasgow and east and central Scotland follow M77 / A77 to Hurlford roundabout just outside Kilmarnock, then follow A71 and A759 into Troon. From England head for Carlisle, then A75 to Dumfries, A76 to Hurlford roundabout then as above.
By boat: Troon is no longer a routine ferry port, but is a bad-weather diversion port when the ferry berth at Ardrossan is exposed. 
With your own boat, sail in to Troon Yacht Haven, sheltered and accessible at all tides. Call +44 1292 315553 to book your berth or check in online.

55.5308-4.62511 Crosbie Church on B749 Monktonhill Rd was built around 1681. Now a ruin, it was a "chapel-of-ease" to save parishioners the walk to the parish church at Dundonald.

55.5767-4.59712 Dundonald Castle, Winehouse Yett, Dundonald KA2 9HD (Bus 10), ☏ +44 1563 851489. Daily 10AM-5PM. There’s probably been a fortification here since the Stone Age, but the present structure was built by Robert Stewart around 1371 when he became King Robert II. So it’s over 600 years old and looks every day of it: basically just a masonry shell, and an hour here will be plenty. The castle has the usual hoaky legends of buried gold, secret tunnels and the inevitable ghost: Jules Verne added to these by setting part of his novel “The Underground City” here. Dogs on lead welcome. Adult £7, senior £6, child £5.   (updated Jul 2022)

As a private club, the members have wide discretion over who they do and don’t admit, and until 2016 they didn’t allow women full membership. They risked losing their PGA tour status over this, so they changed the rules and hosted the Open that year.   (updated Jul 2022)
