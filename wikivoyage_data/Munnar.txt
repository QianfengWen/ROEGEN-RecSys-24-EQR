Munnar is a hill station in the Indian state of Kerala. Tourists come here to see the vast tea plantations of the area.

It is also a popular place for Indian honeymooners.


Understand[edit]
Munnar hills
Munnar is a beautiful hill station, and was a summer resort for the British during the British Raj.
The town is divided into two parts: Old Munnar, where the tourist information office is, and Munnar, where the bus station and most guest houses are located.
The region in and around Munnar varies in height from 1,500 m (4,900 ft) to 2,695 m (8,842 ft) above mean sea level. It is pronounced "Moon-aar" short for "moonu aar" meaning 3 rivers. Three rivers - Madupetti, Nallathanni and Periavaru — flow through this town, but join some distance away from Munnar.
Munnar is famous for its tea plantations, many of them started by the British. The "Kannan Devan" brand of tea from the Tata is cultivated and processed here.
The strobilanthus ("neelakurinji" in Malayalam, the local language), a blue flower which blooms only every 12 years, is found in this region. It last bloomed from August to October 2018. The Eravikulam National Park is the main Neelakurinji flowering area and the number of tourists allowed in the park during the blooming period was limited to 2,750 a day. Munnar also has the highest peak in South India, Anamudi, at 2,695 m.
Eravikulam National Park is one of the main tourist attractions, where you can find the endangered species of Nilgiri Tahr (mountain goat called "varayadu" in Malayalam). A trek to Rajamala ("King of hills" in Malayalam), in the morning is sure to spot a few friendly mountain goats. You can also find gaur, langur, lion-tailed macaque, and elephants depending on the season and time of travel. The altitude is 1,600 m- 2,000 m above sea level.

Climate[edit]
The season between October and March (post-monsoon) is considered the best to visit Munnar. Take some warm clothes and rain coats along with you. The temperature ranges from 14 to 25 degrees during summer, and 7 to 17degrees in winter. The atmosphere remains cool and pleasant throughout the year.

Stay safe[edit]
Hill stations tend to get dark rather early, so be sure to carry a torch or flashlight.
Though Munnar is safe compared to other big cities, it doesn’t mean that mishaps and accidents don’t occur. Visitors should look after their personal belongings, as theft may occur sometimes.
If you are participating in some outdoor activities, injuries or accidents may happen. In order to avoid any hospital expenses, make sure to cover yourself with adequate travel insurance.
The roads in Munnar are bit risky and accidents may occur frequently. Sometimes, even experienced drivers struggle to ride on these roads. So, if you are novice driver, don't drive on these roads. Also, if you are descending Munnar, make sure that you start early. Otherwise, the misty fog will blind your drive. It is safe to start back by 4 o'clock from Top Station.
