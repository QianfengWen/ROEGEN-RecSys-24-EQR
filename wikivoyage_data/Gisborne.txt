Gisborne is a small sunny beachside city on the East Coast of the North Island of New Zealand. It's a popular holiday spot, especially in summer, as it has a warm, dry and sunny climate, swimming and surf beaches, wineries, and a more relaxed pace of life than larger cities. Due to its proximity to the international date line, it's the first city in the world to see the sun rise, which makes it a good place to spend New Year's Eve if you're looking for a party.


Get in[edit]
View of Gisborne from Kaiti Hill
By car[edit]
Gisborne is three hours drive from Napier, the nearest city. It is a half day's drive from Rotorua, and a good day's drive from Auckland or Wellington, perhaps longer depending on the route you take.

By plane[edit]
There are frequent flights from Auckland and Wellington (both 1 hour) on Air New Zealand. It can be quite expensive compared to flying between Auckland/Wellington/Christchurch, but you can find good deals on Air New Zealand's Grabaseat site if you're lucky. Sunair has some flights from smaller cities. The airport is right on the western edge of the city.

By bus[edit]
InterCity Coachlines offer low cost bus services between Gisborne and many other North Island towns.
Get around[edit]
38°39′21″S 178°1′3″EMap of Gisborne
GizzyBus is the local bus service and operates M–F 7:10am–5:40pm, not on public holidays or weekends.
There is a taxi service and several rental car firms. A car is handy, especially if going out of town, say to Wainui Beach (7 km north of the central business district), Rere Falls, or the outlying wineries.
The CBD is small enough to be walked easily. It's an easy 10-15 min walk from the CBD to Waikanae Beach.

-38.675561178.0252783 Cook Landing Site Historic Reserve (Puhi Kai Iti). The Cook Monument was unveiled in 1906, and development of the port since means that it is no longer obvious that this marks where Cook landed in 1769 during his first voyage aboard HMS Endeavour. Cook's crew first sighted New Zealand on 7 October 1769, and landed two days later. Nine Maori died in an unfortunate encounter. Cook named the area Poverty Bay and sailed south to get supplies. The memorial was built after fundraising started in 1902 which aimed to get all New Zealand school children to donate one penny. The area was upgraded in 2019 and was renamed Puhi Kai Iti / Cook Landing National Historic Reserve.   (updated Jan 2024)
Do[edit]
Gisborne is a great summertime destination. Waikanae Beach is a nice beach right near the middle of town and continues into Midway Beach. If you have a car, it's worth venturing a little further out to Wainui, Makarori or any of the bays that you find if you drive north up the coast. Surfing, swimming and fishing are all big parts of local culture, so give these a go.
