Courtenay is a city of about 26,000 people (2016) on the east coast of Vancouver Island, in British Columbia.  Together with the Town of Comox and the Village of Cumberland, Courtenay lies in an area known as the Comox Valley between the Beaufort Range and Comox Glacier in the west, and the Strait of Georgia in the east.


Understand[edit]
Courtenay and District Museum
From its inception, Courtenay's economy relied heavily on the extraction of natural resources, like coal, logging, fishing, and agriculture. Over the years as this natural resource extraction decreased, Courtenay has focused its economic growth on supplying services to the large retiree community and the military families at CFB Comox, which is the largest employer in the Valley, supplying approximately 1,400 jobs. Tourism has also been steadily increasing.

History[edit]
For thousands of years before the first contact with European explorers, Courtenay had been the home to the Comox people now the K'ómoks First Nation. The K'ómoks people farmed the rich agricultural land, and proximity to the local waterways allowed for fishing and trade with nearby First Nations people. In the Comox language, K’omoks means "plenty" – resulting in the Valley being known as the "Land of Plenty". In 1792, Captain George Vancouver, anchored HMS Discovery in what soon would be known as the Comox Harbour and made contact with the First Nations people in the area.
The settlement of Courtenay by Europeans began in the spring of 1862. The first settlers were coal miners from Nanaimo who were drawn to the area, because it had been known as one of the best agricultural districts in the colony. The early settlers relied on the knowledge and help of the local First Nations people. They hired them for general labour and farm work, although they were paid low wages as were most non-white people during that time. Many of the settlers ended up marrying or living with First Nations women who provided trading and social connections to surrounding First Nations people.
In 1864, Robert Brown, leading the Vancouver Island Exploring Expedition, discovered coal deposits in the Comox Valley, and by 1888 Robert Dunsmuir purchased mining claims in the area. He eventually established a mine in Union, later renamed Cumberland, which brought an influx of settlers, and Chinese and Japanese immigrants. During the establishment of the mining and farming industry, the downtown of Courtenay developed on both sides of the Courtenay River, initially on the east side then the west. The two sides were eventually connected by a bridge in 1874.

Former Canadian Pacific Railway Station
Courtenay was incorporated as a town in 1915, and designated a city in 1953. The city was named after the Courtenay River, which in turn, was named after George William Courtenay, captain of the British ship HMS Constance, which was stationed in the area between 1846 and 1849. On 12 July 1915, a large fire ripped through 5th Street destroying much of the south side of the downtown. After much of the street was rebuilt, another fire hit the south side of 5th Street, again destroying many of the stores.
On 14 June 1946, a 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck just west of Courtenay, with the epicentre at Forbidden Plateau. The earthquake was felt as far north as Prince Rupert and as far south as Portland, Oregon. Many of the town's chimneys were destroyed, and there was some significant damage to the post office and the Courtenay elementary school. This was the largest earthquake to hit Vancouver Island, and the largest onshore earthquake in Canada on record. There were only two reported deaths.

Climate[edit]
The climate in Courtenay is very similar to that of the rest of Vancouver Island. In the summer months it can sometimes be considered to have a Mediterranean-like climate due to the low levels of precipitation and drying. In the spring and fall seasons, Courtenay tends to be quite cool and wet. It has one of the mildest winters in Canada. The high precipitation levels can be attributed to both the oceanic climate and also its proximity to the Insular Mountain range which results in the rain shadow effect.

Get in[edit]
The Comox Valley stretches from Fanny Bay to Saratoga Beach and includes the communities of Courtenay, Comox and Cumberland, as well as Denman and Hornby Islands. The Comox Valley is accessible by land, sea or air.
