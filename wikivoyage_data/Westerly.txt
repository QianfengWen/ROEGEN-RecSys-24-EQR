Westerly, RI
Westerly is a town on the southwestern shoreline of Washington County, Rhode Island. First settled by Elder John Crandall in 1661 it is believed that John Crandall named the town after his birthplace in Westerleigh, England. Today Westerly has many references to his name. In 2010, this community had a population of 23,000, which covers 30.1 square miles (78 km²) of land and 44.7 square miles (116 km²) of water.
Westerly has a friendly atmosphere. Visitors from all over enjoy the calm beaches and the unique shops that the downtown area has to offer.


Understand[edit]
Dixon House Square in downtown Westerly
The Pawcatuck River surrounds Westerly on the Western border where it serves a dividing mark for Pawcatuck, Connecticut. Westerly's town crest originates from a special species of Salmon that once resided in the Pawcatuck river. Along Atlantic Avenue by the beachfront lays several salt ponds which serves as an outer wall to the distinct beaches that make this community a large tourist attraction during the summer months (May–September). This community doubles in size during the summer months due to the large attraction of families from all over New England.
Westerly is also known for its textiles and unique type of granite that is quarried from Bradford and Potter Hill regions of Westerly. Griswold Textile Print, Inc. has been family operated since 1937. This plant operates on the Pawcatuck River where they make all their prints in house.

Misquamicut Beach[edit]
Misquamicut Beach consists of the 3/4-mile State Beach area, two Westerly Town beaches and a Misquamicut Fire District Beach. Private businesses own their own beaches, and these are generally open to the public. All of the beaches come together to stretch for over 7 mi (11 km) from the Western tip at Watch Hill, and the Eastern tip at Weekapaug Point.  This basin design allows for direct flow of Atlantic waves, and also allows beach-goers to have beautiful sunrises and sunsets. Off to the south from Misquamicut Beach you can see Block Island, Rhode Island some 11 mi (18 km) away and on clear days to the southwest you can see the northern tip of Long Island, New York. Behind the State Beach there is a saltwater pond that stretches for four miles to the breachway near Weekapaug. Atlantic Avenue is the main thoroughfare that runs parallel to the beach. At each end there are two roads that allow visitors to get to the beach, one Weekapaug Road, near the eastern end, and the other is Winnipaug Road, which is near the western end of the State Beach, and right near all sorts of restaurants, hotels, bars and beaches.
The dunes help to control the wind coming off of the water and prevent erosion of the already diminishing shoreline. A state law restricts any person to go onto the dunes at any time for they are fragile and impossible to replace. Many species of fish inhabit the waters, including tuna, bluefish and striper bass. Seals inhabit the waters in early spring, before heading north to Maine. Sunfish, a large 5-6 ft fish, enter the waters in late July early August to eat jellyfish who are also looking for warmer waters. Many whale sightings have occurred, as well as sharks, however none have come close and none are interested in humans. The largest Great White Shark ever caught was caught off of Block Island.

Climate[edit]
Summer temperatures and weather begin in middle May, and the season closes in middle September. Temperatures are usually in the mid to high 70s (°F) until mid-July, when temperatures tend to stay in the 80s. This continues straight through until early September. There is relatively no humidity because of the strong westerly winds that blow from Watch Hill. Water temperatures stay relatively cold until late June, and by August they are very warm yet still refreshing.  Strong thunderstorms tend to form North of the beach and move South, however they move fast and rarely effect the coast for long. Wave heights are normally 2-3 feet, however this all depends on weather patterns and the tide. Misquamicut is no stranger to 10-20 foot waves in times of hurricanes and other storms.
