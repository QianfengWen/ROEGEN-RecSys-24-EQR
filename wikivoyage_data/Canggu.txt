Canggu is a beach area in South Bali, north of Seminyak and south of Tanah Lot. As recently as 2010, Canggu was mostly rice fields, but since tourism development has made its way north, it has become synonymous with digital nomads, upscale restaurants and accommodation, and terrible traffic.


Understand[edit]
Canggu has a very long black sand beach
Canggu proper is a small village on the beach about 20 minutes north of Seminyak, half way to Tanah Lot. Canggu is widely used though to refer to a large coastal stretch of about 8 km, running north from the village of Berawa (just north of Seminyak) to the village of Cemagi (just south of Tanah Lot) taking in Echo Beach, Seseh and Pererenan along the way. It is still a largely rural area away from the beaches, but is being developed fast.
The beaches have dark grey or black sand and are not particularly good for swimming, but do offer some renowned and challenging surfing spots.
Nelayan Beach (Fisherman Beach) is where you can still get fresh fish, lobsters, and prawns every early morning. Five minutes walk between Berawa Beach and Batu Bolong Beach.
The area is popular with many expatriates who choose to live here, and a large number of the villas owned by overseas nationals are located here.  Much of the area features quietly undulating terrain with the rice paddies that typify much of south central Bali.

Get in[edit]

Taxis can be hard to find in this area and most travel tends to be by private car or motorcycle. Consider booking accommodation with a complimentary airport pickup as this is the easiest way to get to Canggu.

Get around[edit]

Canggu is a nice area for biking so you can explore the area and see the rice paddies. Some guesthouses rent bicycles. Just watch out for cars.
