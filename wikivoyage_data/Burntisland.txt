Burntisland is a port on the north coast of the Firth of Forth, in Fife in central Scotland, with a population of 6600 in 2020. Its west side is industrial and formerly had ship-building, but its east (downriver) is a small seaside resort and commuter town for Edinburgh. Its name refers to an island in the harbour that was long ago engulfed by shoreline development. The usual story is that huts there caught fire, but it could derive from "Burnet's land" a bygone landowner. 


Get in[edit]
Burntisland docks
See Fife for inter-city routes. From Edinburgh Airport take Bus 747 (24 hours) across the river and change to train or bus in Inverkeithing. 

By train[edit]
Inter-city trains seldom stop in Burntisland so you need to change at Edinburgh Waverley, Haymarket or Inverkeithing. Stopping trains run from Edinburgh (M-Sa twice an hour, Su hourly) via Haymarket (for airport), Inverkeithing (for Dunfermline), Dalgety Bay and Aberdour, taking 40 min. They continue to Kinghorn, Kirkcaldy, Markinch (for Glenrothes) then either  Perth or Leuchars (for St Andrews) and Dundee. They no longer loop back to Edinburgh via Glenrothes and Dunfermline.
56.0573-3.23351 Burntisland Station  is south side of town near the docks. It has a ticket office staffed M-Sa and ticket machines but no toilets. There is lvel access to Platform 1 (for Kirkcaldy) and a ramp to Platform 2 (for Edinburgh). 
From 1847 to 1890 the world's first ro-ro ferry plied across the Forth between Burntisland and Granton near Edinburgh: railway trucks were shunted on and off the ferry without needing unloading, while passengers walked. It only closed once the railway bridge spanned the Forth. Dr Bell of Edinburgh, one of the main inspirations for Sherlock Holmes, once theatrically deduced that a patient had come by this ferry by the nature of the mud on his boots. Much too simple to notice the patient's home address on the case notes and make an obvious inference.

By bus[edit]
Inter-city buses don't call here. Stagecoach Fife Bus 7 runs along the coast from Dunfermline to  Inverkeithing, Dalgety Bay, Aberdour, Burntisland, Kinghorn, Kirkcaldy and Leven, M-Sa every 30 min and hourly on Sunday. The main bus stop is by the junction of High St and Kirkgate.

By road[edit]
From the south cross the Forth on M90 Queen's Crossing Bridge (no toll) and take exit 1C onto A921 eastbound.

See[edit]
Burntisland Parish Kirk
56.059359-3.2343951 Museum of Communication, 131 High Street KY3 9AA, ☏ +44 1592 874836. Closed ufn. Telegraph, radio, radar, TV, IT, all were found in these parts from their earliest days, with military, industrial and commercial uses. (updated Sep 2021)
Burntisland Heritage Trust put on exhibitions of town history. They're in Burgh Chambers, corner of Kirkgate and High Street, hours vary.
 St Columba's Church (Burntisland Parish Church), East Leven St KY3 9DH (just north of railway station). "What we most need, Your Majesty, is a new Bible." This Church of Scotland (Protestant) church was the first built in Scotland after the 16th-century Reformation. Protestant church architecture was still feeling its way and this is a very set-square building, a church symbolically founded upon a rock. It was completed in 1594, in a bit of a hurry as the new town walls had left its predecessor "without a city wall", prey to all sorts of marauders. The church has an interesting painted interior, and a gallery so that sailors could tiptoe out whenever tides dictated that they didn't stay for the end of the sermon. (A Presbyterian sermon, thank God for tides!) In 1601 St Columba's hosted the C of S General Assembly that proposed a new Bible, which King James VI & I supported to create the "Authorised Version" of the Bible.   (updated Sep 2021)
56.064-3.2372 Old Parish Church is a 12th-century ruin on Church St, north side of town.
Town Walls are fragmentary. A gateway stands astride West Broomhill Rd towards Rossend Castle.
56.0587-3.240193 Rossend Castle, Melville Gardens KY3 0DF. Closed. This is a 16th century fortfied mansion over the site of a 12th century bastion. By the 1970s it had gone to rack and ruin and was likely to be demolished, but the architects Robert Hurd & C bought and converted it into their offices, where they remain. So you can't visit, just admire the exterior, but the elegant timber ceiling is on display in the National Museum, Edinburgh.   (updated Sep 2021)
The Beach: "Award-winning" they say, but the award must be for fuel efficiency because it's spattered with coal. This is natural pollution: there are coal outcrops on the sea bed, so shards continually wash ashore.
56.06-3.2274 The Links is the park above the beach, granted to the town by James V in 1541. His ancestor James II banned the sinful game of golf, but in 1502 James IV rescinded this, bought a set of clubs, and took to coming home very late for Sunday lunch in a foul mood and with his Pringle sweater covered in burrs.
56.064-3.25 Alexander III Monument is the spot where that king (1241-1286) was killed, thrown from his horse down a steep embankment, travelling alone on a wild stormy night. It was during Alexander's reign that Scotland ousted the Vikings from the Highlands and Hebridean islands, though it took another 200 years to gain Orkney and Shetland. The monument was built in 1886 by Hippolyte Blanc, the prolific church architect.
56.07-3.176 Kinghorn and Pettycur is the next village east, 3 miles along the coast. There are small beaches, a golf course, accommodation and a couple of caravan parks. The loop trains also stop here.
56.057-3.2117 Black Rocks are more the colour of a decomposing crab. They're a tidal islet out in the bay, reached at low tide by the spit from Pettycur to the northeast, and even then with a bit of sploshing. At other times they're within easy kayak and SUP distance from shore.
Do[edit]
View of town from The Binn
Burntisland Fairground is on the Links each summer June-Aug.
Golf: Burntisland House GC (aka Dodhead) is on B923 a mile northeast of town. Kinghorn GC is 200 yards west of Kinghorn railway station.
The Binn is the hill rearing up behind Dodhead golf course to 632 ft / 193 m. An east-west footpath loops off the coast roads.
Fife Coastal Path[dead link] extends from Alloa all the way east beneath the Forth bridges to Burntisland and onward to the East Neuk. To go west, simplest from High St is to head up Lothian St and Kirkton Rd to pick up the trail by Haugh Road. This leads through housing estates then along the railway, eventually ducking beneath the track to come onto the shore path to Aberdour. Going east is only worth doing at low tide, when you can walk along the beach to Kinghorn then trend north towards Kirkcaldy. When the tide's in you have to follow the main road A921; there's a sidewalk but it's a busy boring road. You can walk one way and ride back on the bus or train.
