Beautiful Maui.
Lahaina is a town on the western end of the island of Maui, Hawaii that abounds with restaurants, night clubs, and souvenir shops.  Because the western end of Maui is a popular vacation destination, tourism is important to Lahaina.  Most tourists, however, eschew Lahaina during the day, choosing instead the beaches of Kaanapali; but life in Lahaina after sunset is quite active.


Get in[edit]
Most visitors arrive on Maui by plane via Kahului Airport (OGG). The vast majority of visitors rent cars there and drive to various Maui destinations, including Lahaina. The Honoapiilani Highway (route 30) is a very picturesque drive along the shore which gets you directly to Lahaina. The drive from the airport is about 40 minutes, though the road may get congested sometimes.
Some people fly to West Maui Airport, which is closer to Lahaina (about 15-20 minutes drive).

By boat[edit]
Cruise ships sometimes anchor near Lahaina and passengers get tendered to shore.

Get around[edit]
Lahaina is very compact, and easily explored on foot. If driving, it is advisable to park one's car and walk. There are a couple of free parking locations, but most charge a nominal fee. In some places, stores can validate your parking ticket.
Front Street is the main thoroughfare of Lahaina, where most popular places are located.

See[edit]
Lahaina is not known as a sightseeing destination, and instead is focused mainly on food, souvenirs, and night life. In the course of those activities, however, there are a couple of attractions worthy of attention:

 Maui Invitational. Arguably the most prominent early-season men's college basketball tournament, held over the Thanksgiving weekend in late November at the Lahaina Civic Center. The venue survived the 2023 wildfires undamaged, but due to the catastrophic damage in the rest of the community, the 2023 edition was held in Honolulu. The tournament will return to Maui in 2024.  
 PGA Tour's Mercedes-Benz Championship. The Plantation Course at Kapalua hosts the golf tournament every January. 
 Vic-Maui Yacht Race. The longest offshore sailboat race on the West Coast which starts in Victoria, BC, Canada and ends in Lahaina. 
 Banyan Tree (in courthouse square). 24 hr. Considered the center of the city, this huge tree occupies an entire city block. It's one of the largest Banyan trees in the world and was planted in 1873. The tree was seriously damaged in the 2023 wildfires, but is expected to survive, with extensive rehabilitation ongoing. free. (updated Mar 2024)
