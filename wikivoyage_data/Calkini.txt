Calkini is a stop on the Tren Maya intercity railway that loops through the Yucatan Peninsula, connecting major airports, cities, and archaeological sites. Calkini is midway between Merida and Campeche and the trip will take about 45 minutes. Tickets can be purchased at major stations (not Calkini) or on the official Tren Maya web site.

Get around[edit]
Calkini is a small, compact city but there are always taxis (especially moto taxis) around. They have a sitio near the Zocalo. There are also combis with stops along Calle 20 offering frequent service to Hecelchakán.

Beautiful town square with immaculate sidewalks, manicured gardens that include maguey and tropical plants, a large wooden bandstand, and plenty of park benches to relax as the pigeons come over to befriend you. The plaza faces the church of San Luis Obispo and the Palacio Municipal. There are often vendors selling snacks. 
Church of San Luis Obispo

Built of stone, the church has a rather austere facade with a conch shell balcony over the main entrance and a single bell tower. Inside, the church has two side chapels and an elaborately ornate altar. 
Becal[edit]
Fountain of the Three Hats
The small village of Becal is 10 km north of Calkini (about 10-15 minutes by taxi). Becal is, like Calkini, historic and scenic. It's a town of traditional weavers whose claim to fame is that they make the best woven hats in the Yucatan Peninsula. Their hats are light, tight-woven Panama hats that they make from a palm called jipi. 

Museo de Becal, Calle 30 - small regional museum with art exhibits (including a gallery of works by women artists), as well as local history, and an introduction to weaving and caves
Plaza del Progreso, De la 28 203, Centro - the town's main plaza is an enjoyable place to relax, but don't miss the famous fountain honoring hats (Fuente de los Tres Sombreros)

Panama hats are a specialty of local weavers
The nearby village of Becal is known for its fine-woven panama hats, and several Artesania shops in Calkini specialize in them. The hats are woven from a type of palm grown in the area called jipi (pronounced like "hippie", except the palms sometimes get a bath). Several Mayan weavers in Becal have dug underground workshops on their properties where they can keep the humidity high enough to keep the jipi pliable. Many of these weavers welcome visitors to come see how the hats are made (and maybe buy one to take home).
