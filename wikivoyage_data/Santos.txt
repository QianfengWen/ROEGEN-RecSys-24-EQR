Santos was founded in 1546, partially on the island of São Vicente which harbors both the city of Santos and the city of São Vicente, and partially on the mainland. It is the main city in Paulista Coast. As of 2015, its population was estimated at 433,966. Santos has the biggest seaport in Latin America; is a significant tourist center; has large industrial complexes and shipping centers, which handle a large portion of the world's coffee exports; as well as a number of other Brazilian exports including oranges, bananas and cotton. The city also displays the Coffee Museum, where, once, coffee prices were negotiated; and a football memorial, dedicated to the city's greatest players, amongst which is Pelé. Its beach's garden, 5.3 km long, figures in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest beachfront garden.

Get in[edit]
From São Paulo[edit]
By air - Arriving the airports in São Paulo (Congonhas / CGH IATA) or (Guarulhos / GRU IATA), packtours can arrange convenient TAXI service to Santos, it may take slightly more than one hour to go. There are also about 8 bus service a day from Guarulhos.
By bus - Take a taxi or the subway to Jabaquara Bus Station. There you can take a bus directly to Santos. Estimated travel time: 1 hour 20 minutes. Buses leave every 15 minutes 24 hours a day. More information: 011 50113421. The bus stops at the Centro Rodoviário and them some go on to São Vicente (Santos' twin city), some to Gonzaga (beach) and some to Ponta da Praia (on the channel, handy for taking a boat on to Guarujá). You can get off at many other stops on the bus way on, but only if you do not have luggage in the luggage trunk of the bus.
There is also a direct service from terminal 1. The Bus is Cometta and costs around US$12, arriving into Santos in 2 hr 20 min.

By car - From São Paulo, take either rodovia Padre Anchieta ("Anchieta", SP-160) or rodovia dos Imigrantes ("Imigrantes", SP-160). Both roads have a "planalto" (plateau) section and a "serra" (mountain) section that goes down the Serra do Mar to the sea level. Anchieta being older, its mountain section is winding and narrow, while Imigrantes' is wider and mostly straight due to extensive use of tunnels and bridges. Both roads are linked through a high and a low interlink. Trucks and busses are prohibited in the mountain section of Imigrantes, and are forced to take the interlink and use Anchieta. Both roads feature a toll of about R$ 20,00 that you pay only in one direction (when leaving São Paulo). Traffic is frequently deviated from one road to the other for traffic regulation purposes or road works, so you should follow the dynamic signs.
Get around[edit]
Map of Santos
By taxi[edit]
A good way to move around to not-so-close places. Otherwise regular taxis are not very expensive and drivers are mostly friendly, although small cheats are not uncommon. To avoid it, after getting into a taxi, check if the taximeter has been started . If not, ask the taxi driver to do so.
Uber is also available.

By bus[edit]
Buses are a cheap and nice way to get around by day, although by night they become more scarce. The fare is paid either with tickets, which can be bought at most bus stops, or in cash to the driver or conductor, passing through a turnstile. Keep an eye out for pickpockets when the bus is crowded. Many people board the bus while still wet from the sea, so have a good look if your seat is dry before you sit.
The easiest for you is to simply use Moovit, Google Maps and Bus Schedule in this city to find your bus connection. For Moovit you need to select the metro area "Santos e Região".

By bicycle[edit]
Bicycles are by far the best way to move around the town,  there are many places where you can rent one. It's not allowed to ride on most of the beaches during the day. There are some "ciclovias" (bikelanes), specially a well-signed one in front of the beach. Better safe than sorry: buy a padlock as well.

By streetcar (tramway)[edit]
There are a couple of tourist routes with early XX century streetcars.
