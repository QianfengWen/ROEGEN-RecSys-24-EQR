Piatra Neamţ is a city in eastern Romania, located in the mountainous part of Moldavia.


Understand[edit]
With its cozy streets and coffee shops, warm people and antique boutiques Piatra Neamţ will make you feel at home.
Surrounded by wooded mountains and boasting modern comforts, Piatra is one of the most beautiful and vibrant cities in Moldavia (and perhaps all of Romania). It also offers a small town feel that, for those who frequently travel there, gives a warm feeling whenever one passes through the Bine ati venit arch that welcomes people back to the city.

The medieval tower of Piatra Neamt.
Talk[edit]
Romanian (of course), but most young citizens speak English and many speak Italian, French or German.

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
There are two daily direct trains (one InterCity and one Rapid) from Bucharest, and one Accelerat train from Iasi.
By car from Bucharest 4 hours or by bus 4–5 hours. There are three daily buses from Cluj-Napoca. One is a minibus that departs at 09:00. The trip takes 5–6 hours. At 11:00 there is a bus that is slower and arrives in Piatra around 20:00.

Get around[edit]
Exceptionally cheap minibuses (nostalgically referred to as 'Roznov buses' by the locals) run throughout the city, it costs 2.5 lei to use this transport and the price doesn't change, if you're going to the end of the road, or the opposite end of the city!
Taxis are reasonably cheap, be warned though, they will try and con you out of money. A good example of this is that the driver might place his meter in a position where the customer cannot see it. Other times he will 'forget' to turn on the meter and at the destination give you an inflated price. If the driver fails to turn on the meter then it would be wise to ask him to do this, he will oblige. One might even be inclined to negotiate the price with the driver before agreeing to go with him. A 5-minute journey from the outskirts to the centre seems to cost around 7-8 lei.
