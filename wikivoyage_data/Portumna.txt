See[edit]
53.088-8.2221 Portumna Castle, Portumna H53 YK27. Apr-Oct: daily 9:30AM-17:00. This is an early example of a bling castle, built 1610-17 to show off wealth and with little defensive purpose, in an era when others still preferred to huddle behind stern bastions. The owner was Richard Burke, 4th Earl of Clanricade, and it was a family home to 1826. It was abandoned after a fire and became a sorry roofless shell, but in 1968 the Office of Public Works re-roofed it and began other restoration, which continues. You can visit the ground floor and extensive formal gardens. Adult €5, conc €4, child €3. (updated Jul 2020)
Portumna Abbey is a ruin just east of the castle. It was founded in 1254 by the Cistercians but in 1426 passed to the Dominicans. The abbey was dissolved in 1582 but the friars maintained a local presence and the church was in use on and off to 1810. There's a medieval graveyard, and a corner of the cloister has been reconstructed.
53.099-8.2242 The Workhouse, St Brigit's Road, Portumna. M-F 9:30AM-17:00. By 1800, haphazard local poverty relief by church and voluntary effort was swamped by the rise in destitute people. Workhouses for the able-bodied poor were set up across the British Isles, with some 130 in Ireland. Portumna was one of the additional 33 established in 1850 in the aftermath of the Great Famine. It was built for 600 inmates; the workhouse records have been lost but the 1901 Census recorded 118 residents, falling to 68 in 1911. This and other workhouses closed in 1922 when the new Irish government established County Hospitals for the sick and Homes for the aged. Adult €7, conc €5, child €3. (updated Jul 2020)
Portumna Forest Park is accessed from R352 one km west of the village. It's mostly conifer, with easy walking trails. Another couple of km west, "Stoneyisland Man" was found in 1929. Radiocarbon dating puts him to 3320-3220 BC, so he's 5000 years old. Unlike other "bog bodies" this fellow wasn't buried, it looks as if he drowned in a northern reach of Lough Derg which then became infilled as bog.
53.091-8.1943 The swing bridge carries N65 across the Shannon while enabling river traffic to pass. It sets foot on Hayes Island mid-river, which along with the east bank is in County Tipperary. The bridge was completed in 1911 and the opening section was replaced in 2008. Craft of less than 4 foot air draft can slip under it any time, others must await the opening times[dead link], six daily Apr-Oct and three Nov-Mar.
53.091-8.1214 St Ruadhan's, Lorrha. St Ruadan mac Fergusa Birn (died 584) founded a monastery here. A church was built over the site c 1000 AD, and what is now a Church of Ireland was built next to it in modern times. There are two broken 8th-century High Crosses in the graveyard. Adjacent are the scrappy remains of an Augustinian priory, founded in the 12th century, with the ruins dating to 15th century. (updated Jul 2020)
The Dominican Friary at Lorrha is 200 m west of St Ruadhan's within the grounds of a modern RC church. It was founded in the 13th century.
The Lorrha or Stowe Missal was found in Lackeen Castle
53.089-8.0745 Lackeen Castle is a derelict tower house from the 12th century, rebuilt in the 16th. The "Lorrha Missal", an illuminated manuscript of the 8th and 9th century, was found here hidden within a wall in the 18th century. It was taken into a manuscript collection in Stowe, Buckinghamshire, so it's often called the "Stowe Missal," but it's now in the National Museum in Dublin. The castle is on private land next to Lackeen House, built 1730; neither can be visited.
53.147-8.1216 Redwood (or Egan) Castle is a 13th century tower house. It was burned by Cromwell's forces in 1650 and lay in ruins for 300 years, but in 1972 was restored. It's now a private residence but can be visited on selected dates in summer, adult €8.
53.055-8.2037 Terryglass is a picturesque little village near the north end of Lough Derg. There's a tower house built in the 13th century, but the abbey survives only as the wall of a pub. There are two holy wells: St Columba's Headache Well in the village, and St Augh's Eye Well on the lakeside quay.
