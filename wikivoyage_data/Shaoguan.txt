Shaoguan (韶关; Sháoguān) is a small city in Guangdong Province in China. It is famous for its surrounding nature and the hot springs, and for being home to a large number of people from the Yao ethnic minority.


Talk[edit]
The main language in Shaoguan is Hakka, though most people speak Cantonese and Mandarin as well. Some residents also speak a distinct dialect called Shaozhou Tuhua, which does not fall into any Chinese dialect family, and is mutually unintelligible with Mandarin, Cantonese or Hakka. The Yao ethnic minority speak their own language.

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
Trains serve Shaoguan from many other cities in Guangdong (Dongguan, Foshan, Guangzhou, Maoming, Qingyuan, Shenzhen, Zhanjiang, Zhaoqing) and from other cities in China, as far afield as Beijing.
A train ride from Guangzhou on the slow train takes more than two hours and should cost ¥39 on the hard seater.
The bullet train from Guangzhou takes about 50 minutes to an hour and 15 minutes and costs between ¥70-105 depending on speed for a second class seat.
Shaoguan's two main train stations are 24.7535113.5091 Shaoguan Station (韶关站) and 24.793822113.6047222 Shaoguan East Station (韶关东站). High-speed trains serve Shaoguan Station; slow trains serve Shaoguan East Station, which is more centrally located and slightly closer to Danxiashan.
Shaoguan Station is way to the southwest of the city center, not close to much of anything. There is a little village next to it, though, with a handful of hole-in-the-wall restaurants and cheap guesthouses—exit the station and turn right to find them.

By plane[edit]
When you get off from Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, the intercity bus[1] [dead link] is convenient. The price of a ticket is about ¥100. Please note that you check the bus with certificate. When get off the bus, you can travel around by yourself with the map, that is so fun.

Get around[edit]
The main bus terminal is just next to the train station. Buses leave from here to the major sights. Locally operating buses start here, but the town center is within walking distance. Just cross the river opposite the train station and you are almost there.
Tourist guides will occasionally offer their services to newly arrived travellers. Prices are subject to negotiation.

Eat[edit]
Restaurants in Shaoguan are not set as densely as in Guangzhou. A good place to find many restaurants is Heping Road (和平路) at the northern end of the main shopping and pedestrian area. The choices include a McDonalds and various Chinese cuisines.

24.750964113.5076361 Kuàicān Miànshí (快餐面食), 赤水村 (exit Shaoguan Station, turn right, and walk through the parking lot that says "停车场"). Not really a restaurant so much as a couple of tables by the side of the street, but in any case it's the closest place to get a decent bite to eat outside Shaoguan Station, the high-speed rail station. A mom-and-pop noodle shop with a small convenience store next door. It doesn't even seem to have a name—the sign (in Chinese only of course) just says something like "short-order pasta". ¥10 for a bowl of noodle soup. (updated Nov 2019)
