Framlingham is a small town in Suffolk. The medieval Framlingham Castle is a major feature.  It is also home to one of the smallest houses in Britain, known as the "Check House". Converted into a two-storey residence of almost 29 m2 (310 ft²), the former bookmaker's office is in the Mauldens Mill Estate in the town centre. The ground floor measures 20 feet (6.1 m) by 7 feet 3 inches (2.21 m).
