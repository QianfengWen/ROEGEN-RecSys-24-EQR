Pfäffikon SZ is a small city in Central Switzerland in the greater Zürich metropolitan area, between the Lake of Zurich and the Obersee. Pfäffikon is home to about 7,000 people and is the third biggest city in the canton Schwyz. The former farmer village has turned into a mini financial center due to is favourable location on the border between Northeastern and Central Switzerland and its liberal tax regime. International headquarters have been established big industrial and financial companies have moved to the city. During the week, the small city is bustling with business travellers from multinational companies while during the weekend it is very calm. This town in canton Schwyz should not be confused with Pfäffikon ZH which is in the canton of Zurich.


Get in[edit]
Since Pfäffikon is within the Zürich metropolitan area, it is served by its suburban trains (Zürich S-Bahn). The S2, S5 and S8 lines all offer 2 trains per hour to Zürich Hbf, of which the S2 is the fastest (35 min), followed by S8 (42 min) and S5 (45 min). S2 and S8 use the same route to Zürich Hbf; however, S2 makes limited stops along the line and S8 all stops. It is also possible to use the S2 to get to Zürich Airport (50-55 min). All-zone day and monthly cards are fully valid (see [1] for more information). Don't go to Pfäffikon ZH by mistake!
Also, IR-trains and IC-trains to Chur and Basel have hourly stops.
If you prefer the car then the Autobahn A3 to Chur/Zurich brings you to Pfäffikon. Keep in mind the loads of commuters so in the morning and evening rush hour it might take 15-20 minutes more as the main road (Churerstrasse) is utilized beyond its capacity. There is also the entry/exit Schindellegi on the A3 but entry is only in the direction to Chur and exit in direction to Zurich (not both ways!)

Get around[edit]
47°12′6″N 8°46′38″EMap of Pfäffikon

Pfäffikon is a town so the best options are by foot or bicycle. There are bus lines [2][dead link] but it's not really necessary if you don't live here. Pfäffikon is part of the regional public traffic system (ZVV) so a valid ZVV ticket (or SBB ticket in case of intra-Swiss travel) is sufficient. Orientation is easy as Churerstrasse is the main divider of the town. It starts in the industrial area close to the Autobahn and followed by the Seedamm Center next to Autobahn entry/exit of Pfäffikon. The train station is direct in the center and when you follow the lakeshore to west you fast end in the neighbouring town of Freienbach.
