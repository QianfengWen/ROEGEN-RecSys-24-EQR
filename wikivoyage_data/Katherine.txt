Southern Rockhole, Jatbula Trail, Nitmiluk National Park
Katherine is a town of 9,643 (2021) in the Lower Top End of the Northern Territory, most renowned for its eye-catching gorge.


Understand[edit]
Katherine is  the third largest settlement in the Northern Territory around 300 km south from Darwin.  It has a population of around 10,000, and is a significant regional and tourism centre.  The township is on the banks of the Katherine River, which flows down from the world-renowned Katherine Gorge (Nitmiluk National Park).  Katherine Gorge drawn large numbers of visitors in the peak (dry) season.
Despite being number three in the state, the town is small and consists of a single main street.  On weekends expect to find the majority of the stores closed.
It is a relatively remote destination with abundant waterways including gorges, rivers waterfalls and the ocean. It's these characteristics that attract an influx of adventure seekers all year round.
Its most well-known watercourse is the Katherine River, which flows through the famous Katherine Gorge. The gorge, 30 km from the town of Katherine, within the Nitmiluk National Park, is actually 13 separate gorges connected over a stretch of 12 km by rapids and rocky terrain.
This is an adventure playground for visitors who canoe, camp, bushwalk, and helicopter their way around the Park. Further downstream, extended canoe trips with overnight camping in the peaceful bush is the best way to experience the Katherine River - a serene water way that supports a rich eco-system of native animals and birds.
Bushwalkers are well catered for in Katherine with over 100 km of walking trails in the Nitmiluk National Park alone, ranging from half to five-day treks.  One of the most famous is the Jatbula Trail - a challenging four to six-day, 58-km bushwalk from Katherine Gorge to Edith Falls that takes in diverse scenery, plunging waterfalls and Aboriginal rock art.
The region's other big rivers provide opportunities for serious fishing adventure. The Daly, Roper, Victoria and McArthur Rivers are prime barramundi haunts, and anglers can bring their own boat, hire one or join a guided safari to add landing a big barra to their list of conquests.

Get in[edit]
The quickest way to access Katherine is to fly in to Darwin, hire a car and drive south down the Stuart Highway.

By car[edit]
Katherine is around 3 hours' drive and around 300 km south of Darwin.  All cars rented direct from the rental companies in Darwin will have per day kilometre restrictions.  Unlimited kilometres rentals are unheard of in Darwin unless hiring a campervan.
Unlimited kilometre car hire rentals can be obtained by booking through travel wholesalers such as Territory Discoveries and Flight Centre which makes car hire much more affordable.  Be careful though, if you are just booking through a consolidator, rather than a wholesaler, the kilometre restrictions will definitely apply.

The best way to get around Katherine is by car as most of the attractions of Katherine are not within walking distance of the town centre.

Darwin was founded as Australia’s most northerly harbour port in 1869, and its population rapidly expanded after the discovery of gold at nearby Pine Creek in 1871. World War II put Darwin on the map as a major allied military base for troops fighting the Japanese in the Pacific. Described as 'the gateway to the Northern Territory, Darwin makes a great base for exploring the wonders of the 'top-end'.
Alice Springs was established by the early explorers and remains as the centre of activity in this region. Often referred to as the heart of Central Australia is comprised of cavernous gorges, boundless desert landscapes, remote Aboriginal communities and a charming pioneering history.
Uluru- Rising from the broad desert plain in the deep centre of Australia. Uluru Ayers Rock is Australia's most recognisable natural icon.
Nitmiluk National Park Covering more than 292,000 hectares, Nitmiluk National Park is north-east of Katherine. The impressive gorge walls and white sandy beaches can be explored on foot, by canoe or on a cruise and are stunning from the air on a scenic helicopter flight.
Daly River is between Darwin and Katherine and begins where the Katherine and Flora Rivers intersect and flow west to the Timor Sea. It encompasses many unique ecosystems, including hot springs and gorges, making it a fantastic spot to camp and bushwalk.
Victoria River is south-west of Katherine and is most often visited en-route between Katherine and the Western Australia’s Kimberley region. The small township of Timber Creek, 285 km west of Katherine, is the region’s main centre and home to about 70 people. Fishing is Timber Creek's biggest drawcard and the beautiful Victoria River, running through deep valleys and gorges, is one of the Northern Territory’s most scenic places to catch barramundi.
Gulf region Travelling east from Katherine takes you to the Gulf of Carpentaria - the shallow sea between Australia and Papua New Guinea. The area is home to four main indigenous language groups- Yanuwa, Mara, Kurdanj and Karawa. Its early pastoral areas were opened up by the ill-fated German explorer Ludwig Leichhardt in 1845, and today the Gulf region encompasses some of Australia’s largest cattle stations – several the size of small European countries.
Mataranka a small township sits on the upper reaches of the Roper River, an hour’s drive south-east of Katherine. This tropical wayside stop is on the Explorer’s Way tourism drive, the main artery that connects Adelaide and Darwin, and is renowned for its thermal pool – a sandy-bottomed lagoon fringed by palm forest and a rejuvenating swimming spot for weary travellers up and down ‘the track’.
Stay safe[edit]
Salt and freshwater crocodiles are found near Katherine rivers.  Don't swim or camp near the waters edge.  The accessible rivers and billabongs are generally sign-posted if saltwater crocodiles are known to inhabit the area, but if you are not sure, don’t swim.  The Katherine River near the gorge is a crocodile management zone.  Rangers attempt to trap and relocate any salt-water crocodiles that may have moved into the area in the wet out of the river.
Protect yourself from the sun by wearing a wide-brimmed hat, long-sleeved shirt, sunglasses and sunscreen. You should also be sure to drink plenty of water; a minimum of two litres per day is advised.  Use insect repellent, mosquito coils and appropriate clothing  to protect from mosquito bites.  If camping, keep your tent zipped and tap your shoes out before putting them on.
If you are exerting yourself outdoors, but walking for example, you will need one litre of water for every hour in very warm weather and avoid walking in the hottest part of the day.
Snakes inhabit the bush, so be cautious and make noise when walking through long grass, and make sure you have sturdy shoes.
Carry appropriate safety equipment, such as an EPIRB (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon), satellite phone and first aid kit, and don't bushwalk alone.  Let someone you trust know where you are, and arrange to contact them at intervals.
Shake out your shoes in the morning to remove any 'critters' that have settled in during the night
Only build fires in the pits provided and take care to completely extinguish the flame when finished, and limit the use of fire. Be aware of fire bans in certain areas of the Territory.
Katherine also has a high crime rate, and you should do more than you'll usually do to prevent pickpocketing and after dark: it's best to stay inside, with your car well protected.
