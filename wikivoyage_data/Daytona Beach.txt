Understand[edit]
A welcome greeting to visitors as they enter Daytona Beach and drive past Daytona International Speedway.
Daytona Beach, famous as the "World Center of Racing" and home of NASCAR, is part of the East Central Florida greater metropolitan area. Daytona Beach is the best known of the seven area communities. Although the wide 23-mile (37 km) stretch of white sandy beach is still the biggest attraction here, with over 8 million visitors flocking to the area every year, the metro area is rapidly changing from event Mecca to family oriented resort destination. Historical sites like the Main Street Pier, the Oceanfront Boardwalk and the Clocktower in Oceanfront Park add to the appeal of this exciting city.

History[edit]
Daytona was founded in 1870 by Matthias Day, from whom it takes its name. It was incorporated as a city in 1876. The separate towns of Daytona, Daytona Beach and Seabreeze merged to form Daytona Beach in 1926. In the 1920s, the city became known as The World's Most Famous Beach.
Daytona's wide beach of smooth, compacted sand attracted automobile and motorcycle enthusiasts beginning in 1902, when pioneers in the industry tested their inventions.  On 8 March 1936, the first stock car race was held on the Daytona Beach Course. In 1959, William France created Daytona International Speedway to replace the beach course.
Automobiles are still permitted on the beach — at much slower speeds! Daytona is one of the few places in the world where a family car can be driven on an ocean beach.

The city of Daytona Beach sits on the shore of the Atlantic Ocean and is split in two by the Halifax River. It is bordered on the north by Holly Hill and Ormond Beach and on the south by Daytona Beach Shores, South Daytona, and Port Orange.
Daytona Beach has a very humid subtropical climate typical for a city in the southeastern United States. Summers are hot and humid with highs usually in the 90s (32+°C)and a heat index often exceeding 100°F (38°C). Thunderstorms are frequent in summer afternoons and the hot, humid weather can last through the fall months. Winters are dry and mild, marked by a constant series of cold fronts followed by warmer air. In wintertime, temperatures dip into the low 40s and upper 30s (5°C) on occasion, although freezes are rare.  Frost occurs a few times a year mainly in the inland areas. Snowfall is extremely rare: the last time snow flurries fell on Daytona Beach was in January 2003. Temperatures in spring are famously pleasant with warm afternoons, cool evenings, and far less humidity. This beautiful weather usually attracts tourists back to the beaches by early March.

By car[edit]
Getting around by car is very easy and convenient in Daytona Beach.  The major roads are all wide and easy to drive on with all the major areas signposted, but traffic jams around major intersections are common in the afternoons and around the tourist areas on Saturday nights.
The main tourism area is A1A, also known as Atlantic Avenue, a strip of road that runs parallel to the beach for 23 miles (37 km). During major NASCAR races, International Speedway Boulevard gets congested near the racetrack and traffic patterns on other surrounding roads are altered to accommodate the extra traffic. During major motorcycle events, Main Street and Beach Street as well as most of A1A and U.S. Highway 1 experience heavy traffic or are closed. I-95 around exit 273 is also extremely busy during motorcycle rallies.
All major car rental companies are located in or near the Daytona Beach International Airport.

By motorcycle[edit]
If you are coming to Daytona Beach for a motorcycle rally, you will probably want to rent a motorcycle instead of a car. If you don't have one already, you should reserve one well in advance of the major biker rallies.
