Middletown lies south of Portsmouth and north of Newport, Rhode Island. This geographical location is what gave this town its name. Middletown was founded in 1743 when unjust taxation and a growing population caused freeholders in Newport to petition for independence. In 1731, the land that Middletown occupies was set apart and the town began.
Today, Middletown is a small yet bustling community. There are many places to eat and sleep as Middletown provides a port to many tourists to Newport. Middletown has very interesting history including Nicolas Cage's purchase of the "Grey Craig" (a very large home) in August 2007.
