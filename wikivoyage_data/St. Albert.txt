St. Albert, or Saint Albert, is a city of about 66,000 people (2016) in the Edmonton Capital Region. It was settled as a Métis community, and is known for its rich arts scene and Indigenous heritage.


Understand[edit]

St. Albert is Alberta’s oldest non-fortified community with roots going back to 1861. At this time, Father Lacombe convinced Bishop Taché that a mission be established on the Sturgeon River to serve the Aboriginals and the Metis of the district. The first building to be erected was a modest log chapel. Two years later, St. Albert became the site of the settlement’s first school with three Grey Nuns as its teachers.
In 1864, the Youville Asylum was opened and served as convent and a school. The asylum later functioned as an orphanage and as the first hospital in Central Alberta.
By 1870, St. Albert had become the largest settlement west of St. Boniface, Manitoba. It boasted a population of 1,000 including Metis and white settlers. Between 1870 and 1900, the area surrounding St. Albert attracted an increasing number of settlers, primarily French-Canadians. As a result, the community prospered and in 1904 was incorporated as a town.
By mid-century, St. Albert had begun to lose much of its rural appearance. Perron Street was home to a butcher shop, restaurants, hardware and general stores. In 1977, St. Albert became Alberta’s eleventh city.
Today, St. Albert continues to grow and prosper, offering its residents a high quality of life with abundant recreational opportunities and cultural and arts programs.
