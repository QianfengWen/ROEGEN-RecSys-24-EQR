Nombre de Dios is a small town of about 5,000 residents in the southeastern part of Durango, Mexico. Founded in 1562, it is the oldest town in Northern Mexico. It is designated as one of Mexico's Pueblos Mágicos.


Understand[edit]
The town was founded by Franciscan missionaries along the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro. The Franciscans established their mission with the building of a new church dedicated to St. Peter the Apostle in 1556 by Fray Gerónimo de Mendoza. Mendoza conducted the first mass in the name of God, which was adopted as the growing town's name. Four more churches would be built in the town during the viceregal era and today, the five can be visited as part of an interesting walking tour of the town.
The town is known for its waters, even though most of the state is dry and rocky. Several springs around the area feed small streams that are tributaries of the nearby Tunel River (Rio Tunel). Near the town are impressive waterfalls and cypress swamps. The springs also provide mineral waters for nearby spas and feed several public pools.
