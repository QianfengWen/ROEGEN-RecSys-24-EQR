Troy is a city in Michigan and a suburb of Detroit.


Understand[edit]
Troy was first settled in the early 19th century and was named after Troy, New York where the first settlers had resided. The city was incorporated out of Troy Township into the City of Troy in 1955. Much of the development in the city occurred between the 1960s and 1990s. There are several large corporations headquartered in Troy including Delphi, ArvinMeritor, Flagstar Bancorp, Budd Company, and Kelly Services. It was the world headquarters of Kmart before it was purchased by Sears Holdings, and its large headquarters complex still stands at the northwest corner of Big Beaver & Coolidge.
In 2008, Troy was ranked 22nd on a list of "Best Places to Live" in the United States by CNN Money, using criteria including housing, quality of education, economic strength, and recreational opportunities. In 2008, Troy ranked as the fourth most affordable U.S. city with a median household income of US$90,000.

By plane[edit]
Troy is about 30 miles north of Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport which is a major hub for Delta Air Lines and also has international service operated by Lufthansa, KLM, Air France, and Royal Jordanian. Shuttle service to Troy is available but is expensive (roughly $30 per person) and a taxi to Troy could run as much as $60. Therefore, it may be less expensive to arrange someone to meet you at the airport, or rent a car; even if you don't intend on driving much once you are in Troy.
For those who seek a bargain, (or if you live relatively close to the area) try flying into Flint Bishop International Airport. Fares are somewhat lower than what you would expect at Metro Airport, and the drive time into Troy is about the same (about 1 hour).
For those travelling by general aviation, you can fly into the Oakland-Troy Airport[dead link], which is about a 15-minute walk from Troy Transit Center.

Get around[edit]
By bus[edit]
Public bus service is provided by SMART. Bus fares are $2.00 and there are several routes that travel to or through Troy. However, many destinations within the city are a mile or further from the closest bus route.

Drink[edit]
Troy restricts its liquor licenses in a way that prevents much in the way of nightlife common in more urban cities. However, many restaurants have bars inside and there are a number of neighborhood bars.
For the more adventurous beer fan, Dragonmead, one of the nation's most highly acclaimed microbreweries is located in nearby Warren and has a brew-pub.
For those seeking nightlife, it is recommended you find a copy of Real Detroit Weekly and read the ads for the promoted "parties" running that week. Tough economic times in the region have forced many nightclubs to close except for days when a promoter rents the club and promotes a "party", often at his own risk. These parties are often advertised in Real Detroit. Nightclubs that are popular and even open in the Detroit area change rapidly and a recommendation of a particular club may be irrelevant in even a few months later if the club has gone "dead" and closed or changed names.
