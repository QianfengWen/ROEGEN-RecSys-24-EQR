By plane[edit]
The nearest practical airports are Glasgow (GLA IATA) 140 miles away and Edinburgh (EDI IATA) 180 miles away. Inverness (INV IATA) is within 100 miles but has few flights.

By train[edit]
Scotrail trains run from Glasgow Queen Street to Mallaig, taking 5 hr 20 min, with four M-Sa and two on Sunday. They split at Crianlarich, with one portion heading to Oban, so you need to be in the correct section via Fort William, Glenfinnan and Arisaig. Another train starts from Fort William. Trains and ferries are sometimes held for connections... and then again, sometimes not. 
The Caledonian Highland Sleeper from London Euston (Su-F) reaches Fort William at 10AM (M-Sa), with the first onward train to Mallaig at midday. You can also take the Lowland Sleeper towards midnight, reaching Glasgow Central for 7:30AM, then continue on the daytime train. 
The West Highland Line crosses impressive highland scenery, dramatic even in bad weather as the clouds swirl over stern mountains. It passes Loch Lomond, Rannoch Moor, Fort William beneath Ben Nevis, then across the Glenfinnan Viaduct, a hundred-year-old stone arched rail bridge. From up there you don't see much of the viaduct, but there are views down Loch Shiel to the left. You can day-trip here from Fort William for under £20 return in 2023.

 The Jacobite steam train (the "Harry Potter" train). This heritage train runs daily Apr-Oct from Fort William to Mallaig. It's a six-hour excursion (depart 10:15AM, return by 4PM) staying two hours in Mallaig, and in 2023 an adult trip was £57 standard, £89 first class; child £33 / £63. May-Sep there's also an afternoon train (12:50-6:50PM), so you could have 4½ hours in Mallaig, time for a boat trip. Trains also stop at Glenfinnan for the obligatory photo of the viaduct, and by request at Arisaig. The morning excursion connects with the Caledonian Sleeper from London. (updated Apr 2024)
57.006-5.82951 Mallaig railway station is 100 yards from the ferry pier. It has a ticket office (M-Sa), waiting room and toilets. There is step-free access to the platforms.
By bus[edit]
Citylink buses run from Glasgow Buchanan station to Skye; get off at Fort William (3 hours) and change to the Shiel Bus. In summer the Citylink buses run daily every couple of hours, but only half of them have a speedy onward connection to Mallaig. So from Glasgow buy a through-ticket: the connection will usually be held. The first bus north from Glasgow is at 10AM arriving for 3PM, the last bus south from Mallaig is around 3:30PM for 10PM. Citylink and Shiel Buses also run between Inverness and Fort William taking two hours, 4-6 a day in summer.
Between Fort William and Mallaig, Shiel Bus 500 takes 90 min, adult return £8. In summer it runs four times a day M-F, but Sa Su only once. Sit on the right for views of Glenfinnan Viaduct. Bus 501 also runs three times a day between Mallaig and Arisaig.
The bus stop in Mallaig varies. A couple of buses connect with the ferry to Armadale in Skye, and run direct to the ferry terminal. Others stop outside the bank near the railway station before wandering off to the housing estate at Mallaigvaig.

By car[edit]
Mallaig village and port
Reaching Mallaig by road first involves reaching Fort William then following A830 west (past Glenfinnan) for the last 43 miles.
The route from Glasgow is by A82 north past Loch Lomond, Crianlarich and Glencoe. (From Glasgow Airport follow M8 west to cross the Erskine Bridge and join A82.) There's a choice of routes from Edinburgh; it's probably easiest to follow M9 past Stirling, then A84 via Callander and Loch Earn to join A85, which joins A82 at Crianlarich. (From Edinburgh Airport turn west to come onto M9.) From Inverness it's a straight run south on A82 past Loch Ness to Fort William.
Reckon to average at best 50 mph (80 km/h). You'll zip along the motorways but the A-roads are twisty and busy, with few opportunities to overtake safely.

By boat[edit]
CalMac car ferries sail from Mallaig to:

 Armadale on Skye, 45 min. Apr-Oct M-Sa there are nine sailings, Sunday six. Nov-March has 2 or 3 M-Sa and just one on Sunday.
Lochboisdale on South Uist, 3 hr 30 min, once daily in summer. In winter it's usually once on W Sa Su, but no sailings for most of Nov or Feb. When this ferry's not sailing, reach South Uist via Oban.
The Small Isles of Rùm, Eigg, Muck and Canna. Ferries sail daily throughout the year, but visit different islands on different days, so depending on route the crossing takes 2-4 hours. Don't take a car, use the free parking lot next to the ferry terminal.
Inverie on Knoydart is on the Scottish mainland but has no road connection. The ferry (operated by Western Isles Cruises) sails year-round, with four M-F and two Sa Su, taking 30 min. One sailing M-F calls at Tarbet, similarly isolated on the other side of the loch.
