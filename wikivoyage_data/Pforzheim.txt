Pforzheim[dead link] is known as the "Gateway to Black Forest" or "Goldstadt" (Gold town) for its jewellery and watch-making industries. It is one of the main cities in Baden-Württemberg and lies on the north edge of the Black Forest between Karlsruhe and Stuttgart. Pforzheim is a town of 126,000 inhabitants (2021). It is a beautiful city, but it does not have many places to visit. It is a good place to go exploring if you have a sense of adventure. Pforzheim was largely destroyed during World War II, especially by an air strike by the Royal Air Force on 23 February 1945. Therefore, only few historic buildings exist. Besides its functional charm of a quickly rebuilt city, being located at the confluence of three rivers (Nagold, Würm and Enz) provides Pforzheim with green areas breaking the concrete architecture.
