Cumbernauld is a town on Clydeside in central Scotland, 13 miles northeast of Glasgow, with a population of 50,530 in 2020. The town lies close to attractive countryside along the canal and up in the Campsie Fells.


Understand[edit]
The name is Gaelic, comar nan allt meaning the meeting of waters, and it's near the watershed of the Clyde and Forth river catchments.
The town grew up as a weaving centre in the 19th century as the railway arrived, then expanded rapidly from 1955 when it was designated a "New Town". Cumbernauld was the third of five such towns built to alleviate Scotland's housing shortage, preceded by East Kilbride and Glenrothes, and followed by Livingston and Irvine; the intended sixth at Stonehouse was never built. Cumbernauld shares their drab brutalist architecture, and was especially influenced by the 1963 Buchanan Report "Traffic in Towns." In many ways this report was far-sighted, but implementation was shoddy, and 1960s politicians were in thrall to the car. The town's vertical segregation of pedestrians and vehicles meant few pedestrian crossings but many bridges, flyovers and underpasses, which became linear lavatories for the town drunks, and the place was mocked as "Noddytown". It might have overcome this with other attractions, but these are frankly lacking, and most visitors are just stopping over at the M80 hotels. 
Cumbernauld town centre draws those who are curious to see post-war New Town architecture: all drab plazas and shopping centres and brutalist concrete slabs.

The Centre Cumbernauld
55.9468-3.990421 The Centre Cumbernauld. This megastructure was built innthe 1969s to be a town centre consisting of "one huge multi-storey building", housing shops, apartments, a hotel, ice rink, police station and other amenities. It has now fallen into disrepair. It was voted "Britain's most hated building" in 2005, in a poll organised by Channel 4's programme Demolition, and was twice named Scotland's worst town centre by the Carbuncle Awards.   (updated Mar 2024)
55.959-3.9682 Cumbernauld House Park, a mile northeast of town, has open and wooded areas for strolling. It's ranged around 18th-century Cumbernauld House, which is nowadays private apartments, and continues into a bosky glen.
55.935-3.9483 Palacerigg Country Park has a petting farm, wildlife areas, woodland and open heath. It's two miles east of town next to the golf course, and open daily 9AM-5PM, free.
Do[edit]
Football is only played at amateur level, as Clyde FC (based here 1994-2022) have relocated to  Hamilton. Cumbernauld United play soccer at Guy's Meadow, and Cumbernauld RFC play rugby union at Condorrat.
Golf: Palacerigg GC (see park, above) is 5972 yards, par 71 / 72.
Fannyside Loch just east of the golf course has sailing and windsurfing, but the footpaths are in poor condition.

Gregory's Girl
Cumbernauld is the setting for the 1981 Bill Forsyth film Gregory's Girl. The gawky teenage Gregory is as inept in love as he is in football, and the girl he pines for is a better footballer, replacing him on the team as a forward. In the final scenes he and his pals set off to hitchhike to Caracas, which they can't even spell, but believe that women there greatly outnumber the men. It's as far away from Cumbernauld as they can imagine.


The main shopping centre is along the lyrically named "Central Way", with ASDA 200 yards north open daily 6AM-midnight.
Eat[edit]
Town centre eating places include La Bella (daily noon-10PM), Beefeater Dovecote (daily 7AM-11PM) and the usual fast-food chains and takeaways.
There's a Little Asia huddled around the railway station.
The Village, the historic core before the New Town grew up further south, has Coorie In @ The Black Bull (daily 11:30AM-midnight) and Invitation [dead link] Indian & Nepalese (Su Tu-Th 4-10PM, F Sa 4-11PM).

Glasgow and Edinburgh are within an hour and both deserve an extended stay.
Stirling is a miniature Edinburgh, and has routes into the Highlands.
The Roman Antonine Wall runs a few miles to the north through Kilsyth, with the Campsie Fells beyond.
To discover if they made a better job of Scotland's other four New Towns, see East Kilbride, Glenrothes,  Livingston and  Irvine. But to be fair to the planners, also go and see what unplanned expansion looks like, for example in Dumbarton.
