If you are flying into San Francisco, Amtrak is the best way to get to Davis. From SFO airport, take the BART subway to Richmond. Exit BART and then take the stairs or elevator up to the Amtrak platform. The Richmond station is unstaffed, so Amtrak tickets can be purchased on board the train for no additional fee.

By plane[edit]
Although UC Davis has its own (small) airport, it is really only possible to reach Davis by plane through commercial airports. The closest option is Sacramento International Airport (SMF IATA), from which one can then take a shuttle or taxi to Davis. A cheaper alternative is to take Yolobus. For $1.50 the #42 bus will take you to downtown Davis. You can then either utilize Unitrans, the local bus service or take a taxi to your destination. The airport is approximately a 30-minute drive from Davis.
The Oakland (OAK IATA) and San Francisco (SFO IATA) airports are also options for people who wish to visit the Bay Area as well as Davis. If your trip itinerary does not include the Bay Area, however, then SMF is the best option for commercial air travel to Davis. Amtrak trains are available from Oakland and San Francisco.
The Davis Airporter[dead link] is another option for people flying in commercially. While it provides service to your front door and is available at all hours of the day and night, it is considerably more expensive than public transportation.

By bus[edit]
Davis is not served by long-distance buses, but nearby Sacramento is a hub for Greyhound. There are daily buses from Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Reno and even Vancouver, in Canada. If travelling from nearby cities, Yolobus runs hourly buses from Sacramento and also multiple daily buses from Vacaville and Woodland.

Get around[edit]
Bikes on campus. Be careful: they rarely slow down for pedestrians!
Davis has the highest per capita number of bikes of any city in the U.S. It's the preferred method of transportation for most students and locals due to the prevalence of bike paths and the relative flatness of the area. Downtown is also very pedestrian friendly. The UC Davis campus and the heart of the downtown area run alongside one another and it's easy to stroll through both in a couple of hours.
Unitrans, the local municipal bus system, also runs quite frequently. For undergraduate students riding is free, for everybody else (including graduate students) a single journey costs $1. Probably the worst way to experience Davis is by car. The huge numbers of bikers and pedestrians make driving slow and tedious at many times throughout the day.

It is the main source of horticultural information for inland California. The arboretum is a popular place for Davis students for walk, jog, bike, study, or just relax in the sun.   
 Public art. Can be found all over town. It is difficult to go anywhere or do anything without encountering sculptures, mosaics, paintings, or stenciled designs. An art enthusiast could be kept busy for days. 
 Toad Tunnel. A nationally infamous example of civil engineering gone horribly wrong. Located in southeast Davis near the Post Office and the Sudwerk brewery, the Toad Tunnel was designed to assist the local population of toads cross an I-80 overpass. Arguably, it has caused more problems for the toads than it solved. If you have any friends pursuing degrees in town planning, ask them about Davis' Toad Tunnel.

Do[edit]
Become a student. Davis is ranked as the second most educated city in the United States according to CNN Money Magazine and it shows. The downtown area is very youthful and is peppered with bars, coffee shops, and restaurants that are popular among the college crowd. The city of Davis is very conducive to college and graduate school lifestyles.
 Mondavi Center. On campus. A wide variety of performances can be seen year round, ranging from music to theatre to puppetry. 
 Farmers Market. Open twice a week on Saturdays and Wednesdays, the Davis Farmers Market takes place in Central Park and offers fresh, locally grown foods. Much of the produce is grown organically. From March through September, the Wednesday evening Farmers Market becomes the Picnic in the Park, offering several restaurant stands, live music, and various other events geared towards a wide variety of ages. 
 Picnic Day. If you want to experience the single largest student-run event in the United States, visit Davis in late April and revel in Picnic Day. The day consists of over 150 free events, most of which take part on campus, including dog races, food tastings, exotic animal shows, the notorious Battle of the Bands, and an exciting fashion show displaying unique student work. As one might expect, a good amount of drinking takes place throughout the day and by late afternoon there tends to be intoxicated people everywhere, but the mood of the event is very positive, and arrests are very few relative to the meeting than 50,000 attendees. 
 Whole Earth Festival. Whole Earth is an annual celebration of counterculture, art, politics, sustainability, and music, taking place over a three-day period on Mother's Day Weekend. Tens of thousands of hippies, punks, and miscellaneous weirdos descend on Davis for this event, taking place on the UC Davis quad.
