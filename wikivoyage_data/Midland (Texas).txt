Midland is a city in the Permian Basin region of Texas with a population that just passed the 100,000 mark.  Named among the 150 best U.S. cities in which to live for the past twelve years, its warm climate, friendly people, and central location are the primary reasons for the city's popularity.   Twenty minutes to the west is Odessa, with a population of about 100,000. Nearly a quarter of a million people reside in the Midland/Odessa metropolitan area.


Understand[edit]
Midland Skyline
Midland was founded in 1885 as a railroad stop on the barren west Texas plains, and named for its location midway between Fort Worth and El Paso.  Since then, Midland has served as a center for agriculture, ranching, and transportation for the southern plains.
Midland was a relatively small town until the discovery of oil in the 1920s, when it was quickly transformed into the administrative hub of the Permian Basin. One of the world's largest petroleum-producing regions, today the basin supplies nearly 20 percent of the country's oil and gas output, and thousands of people are employed locally to extract it.
Nowhere is the oil influence more visible than downtown, where the streets are lined by high-rise office buildings constructed by oil companies. The Bank of America Building is reputably the tallest building between Fort Worth and Phoenix, and the Wilco Building is only a little shorter.  The Petroleum Building is a beautiful example of architecture from the Roaring Twenties, while Claydesta Center (a business park of several 5- & 6-story buildings) showplaces the splendour of the heyday of Midland's Oil Business.
The oil crash in the late 1980s dealt a firm blow to the area, and Midland fell into a bit of disrepair, but has since bounced back and is chugging along.  Notable former residents are George W Bush and Laura Bush, in their younger years.
