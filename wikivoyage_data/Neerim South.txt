Get in[edit]
The most straightforward way to visit Neerim South is by car, which will also let you visit nearby towns. Using public transport is more difficult, though it can be done. Take a V/Line train to Warragul. Then there's a bus service that goes towards Noojee from Warragul station at 10:20AM on weekdays. It stops at the Neerim South Post Office and takes about a half hour. All of this can be paid for using Melbourne's Myki service, though some trains do require paper tickets.
