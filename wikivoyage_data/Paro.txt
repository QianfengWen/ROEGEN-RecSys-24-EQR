Paro Dzong
Paro (population 11,500 in 2017) is a town in the south west of Bhutan.


Understand[edit]
Paro is a historic town with many sacred sites and historical buildings scattered through the area. In addition, the Paro Valley is wide and verdant and is recognized as one of the most beautiful in all Bhutan. You may prefer to stay in Paro if you are someone who is fond of nature and would like to have a quiet and peaceful time. However, apart from the main street (which is constructed of traditional wooden structures), the bazaar area is a nondescript hodgepodge of concrete buildings that is totally bereft of charm and character.  Along with Jakar and Punakha, Paro forms the 'golden triangle' of popular tourist destinations in Bhutan.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Paro is the site of the nation's sole international airport: 27.40888989.4205561 Paro Airport (PBH  IATA). Located deep inside a narrow valley, Paro is often cited as the airport with the most difficult approach in the world. Although this is unlikely to be true, the descent does entail a flight path very close to mountain peaks, which can be unnerving for those on their maiden flight into the airport. Paro is served by two airlines, Druk Air, and Bhutan Airlines, which ply routes between Bangkok, Delhi, Dhaka, Kathmandu, Kolkata, Siliguri, Singapore, and Gaya (from Nov to March only). 

By taxi[edit]
Taxis from Thimphu are easy to find at the 'bus booking,' and potential customers will be approached by taxi drivers. The journey takes between 45 to 60 mins. Rates - shared: Nu350, reserved: Nu1,400 (as of April 2024).

Get around[edit]
27°26′0″N 89°25′0″EMap of Paro
As the main tourist sites in Paro are spread out throughout the valley, a vehicle is required to get around. Taxis are available for hire inside the main bazaar.

See[edit]
Taktsang Monastery
Drukgyel Dzong
 Chumbu Monastery. Site of the a floating statue. From Kuenga High School in Doteng (8 km north from Paro town), it's a three-hour gentle walk to the monastery, following the river valley, but the final thirty minutes is on a very steep incline. There is a small sacred lake just above the monastery. The monastery is dedicated to the dakini Dorji Phagmo (Vajravarahi). (updated Feb 2019)
 Drakhapo, Above Shaba (keeping Shaba School to the right, follow the dirt road to end; the complex is a five-minute walk from here). A monastic complex perched on a cliff. Guru Rinpoche spent two months here after completing a retreat at nearby Taktsang, and during his stay placed many treasures (terma) into the cliff. The area also has several hand and foot prints embedded in the rock. (updated Dec 2016)
27.50305689.32251 Drukgyel Dzong. This dzong (fortress) was built in the 16th century to commemorate a victory over the invading Tibetan forces. The fortress today lies in ruins, the elements and a fire in the 1950s having taken a toll on the site. Drukyel dzong is about 15 km from Paro.   (updated Dec 2016)
 Jangsarbu Lhakhang. Located behind Paro Dzong. This small and insignificant looking temple is home to a magnificent statue of Sakyamuni Buddha that was carried all the way from Lhasa, and also houses the protector deity of Paro. Legend has it that the statue of Sakyamuni was destined for Paro Dzong and merely placed in the temple for overnight safekeeping. However, when the time came to move the statue, it proved impossible to lift. As a result, it became a permanent feature of the lhakhang. (updated Dec 2016)
 Kichu Lhakang (just off the road running between Paro bazaar and Taktsang Monastery). This is one of the 108 monasteries that are said to have been miraculously constructed by King Songten Gampo in one night. (updated Dec 2016)
27.4287389.425562 National Museum of Bhutan (above the dzong). In a former watch tower, itself a museum piece, the museum displays artifacts from Bhutan's history as well as examples of indigenous flora and fauna.   (updated Dec 2016)
27.42666789.4233033 Rinpung Dzong. Constructed in 1646.   (updated Dec 2016)
27.49191189.3634894 Taktsang Monastery (Tiger's Nest). Closed on Tuesdays. Precariously perched on the edge of a 1,200-m cliff, this monastery creates an impressive sight, and is the unofficial symbol of Bhutan. It is about a 2-to-3-hour, totally uphill hike from the parking lot to the monastery, though there is a cafe on ridge across from the Taktsang (about 90 minutes into the walk) that provides a welcome opportunity to take a rest and purchase refreshments and snacks. Taktsang was established as a sacred place for meditation by Guru Rinpoche, who visited the site on his second visit to Bhutan in 747 CE, though the first monastery was not constructed until 1694. In 1998, a tragic fire destroyed most of the original buildings, but these have since been painstakingly restored to their former glory.  An entry fee of Nu500 is levied on regional tourists (those who do not pay the US$250/day tariff). The ticket office is in the parking lot at the foot of the mountain - entry will be denied if a ticket from this office is not produced at the monastery gate. Entry is free for tourists who pay the daily tariff.   (updated Dec 2016)
Do[edit]
Paro Tshechu - a religious festival normally held around Feb-Mar
Trek to the Taktsang monastery (Tiger's Nest) - A three-hour trek up to the monastery located high on a vertical cliff. The path is quite clear once you reach the starting point, also there are a lot of people going to/coming back from the same. The trek takes you through very lush green forested areas and very scenic points. Do converse with co-trekkers, especially locals and llamas (monks), as this is a very good way of knowing/understanding/absorbing their beautiful culture. There is a cafeteria at about halfway, in case you need some refreshments or want to have some slightly expensive but tasty meal.
27.43056989.4147021 Watch a game of darts. You can watch the locals playing/practicing a different kind of dart game (called kuru) during the evenings at the river bank near the Bhutan Telecom office. (updated Dec 2016)
Buy[edit]
