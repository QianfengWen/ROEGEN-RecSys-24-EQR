Warrnambool is a coastal town in Victoria, Australia, sometimes considered to be at the end of the Great Ocean Road, although some consider the extra journey to Port Fairy.


Understand[edit]
It is 260 km west of Melbourne, and has a population of 35,000 (2018). It is the largest town in southwestern Victoria and makes a good base for travellers to explore the surrounding area.

Origin of the name[edit]
The name "Warrnambool" originated from Mount Warrnambool, a scoria cone volcano 25 km northeast of the town. Warrnambool (or Warrnoobul) was the name of both the volcano and the group of Aboriginal Australian people who lived there. In the local language, the prefix Warnn- designated home or hut, while the meaning of the suffix -ambool is now unknown. William Fowler Pickering, the colonial government surveyor who in 1845 was tasked with the initial planning of the township, chose to name the town Warrnambool. The traditional Indigenous owners of the land today are the Dhauwurd Wurrung people, also known as the Gunditjmara.

By plane[edit]
Warrnambool has an airport approximately 15 km north of the CBD, although there are no scheduled commercial flights. Mount Gambier is 2 hours drive away to the west and has scheduled flights, but the best choice is generally Melbourne that has many more services and facilities and is a 3.5-hour drive to the east. Due to Avalon Airport's location between Melbourne and Geelong, 204 km from Warrnambool, flying to Melbourne, renting a car and driving on to Warrnambool is much easier from Avalon Airport than from Melbourne Tullamarine Airport.

By train[edit]
V/Line operates three daily train services from Melbourne (Southern Cross Station) to Warrnambool. The journey of 3.5 hours operates via Geelong, and trains have a buffet car on board serving snacks. As a long-distance service with reserved seats you should book tickets with V/Line in advance. Go online, call or go to the station. However, you will usually be able to buy a ticket just before travel, and there are conductors on board who sell paper tickets (Myki cards are not used on this route). Tickets are $10.30 each way from Melbourne.

By car[edit]
From Melbourne, Warrnambool can be reached on the inland Princes Highway in approximately 3.5 hours. Another possible route is going along the Hamilton Highway, which takes approximately 3.5 hours as well; however, local traffic on these narrower roads may slow you down. Alternatively, you can take the Great Ocean Road. This takes approximately 5.5 hours (without stopping), but is well worth it for the spectacular views.

By bus[edit]
V/Line runs a coach along the Great Ocean Road to Warrnambool three times a week, and daily bus services to Hamilton and Mount Gambier in South Australia.

Get around[edit]
By car[edit]
Warrnambool is easy to navigate by car. Metered parking in the city costs 70c per hour, but it is easy to find unmetered parking.

Tower Hill (traditional Aboriginal name: Koroitj) is an extinct volcano which erupted at least 34,000 years ago. There is evidence that the Gunditjmara, the traditional owners of the area, were living there at that time. Once European settlers arrived in the 1830s, nature degraded due to clearing of lands for farming and cattle. It was only in 1961, when large efforts were undertaken to restore flora and fauna to their former state. The wetlands in the 3-km-wide crater now offer great hikes. Emus and koalas are among the many wildlife that can be spotted there. Local guides offer tours at 11AM and 1PM from the visitor's center.   (updated Jul 2021)
