Oakville is a town of 190,000 people (2016) on the north shore of Lake Ontario, about 30 km west of Toronto.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Towne Square
In 1805, the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada bought the lands between Etobicoke and Hamilton from the Mississaugas Aboriginal people, except for the land at the mouths of Twelve Mile Creek (Bronte Creek), Sixteen Mile Creek, and along the Credit River. In 1807, British immigrants settled the area surrounding Dundas Street and on the shore of Lake Ontario.
In 1820, the Crown bought the area surrounding the waterways. The area around the creeks, 960 acres (3.9 km²), ceded to the Crown by the Mississaugas, was auctioned off to William Chisholm in 1827. He left the development of the area to his son, Robert Kerr Chisholm, and his brother-in-law, Merrick Thomas. Chisholm also formed shipbuilding business in Oakville Navy Street and Sixteen Mile Creek (Halton Region) and lasted until 1842, but shipbuilding in Oakville lasted into the late 20th century.
The population in 1846 was 1,500. The community shipped large quantities of wheat and lumber via schooners and the railway. There were three churches, a grist mill and saw mill, and various small companies making threshing machines, wagons, watches, saddles, and metal goods. There were also tradesmen of various types.
Oakville's industries included shipbuilding. In the 1850s, there was an economic recession and the foundry, the most important industry in town, was closed. Basket-making became a major industry in the town, and the Grand Trunk Railway was built through it. In 1869, the population was 2,000. The community was served by the Great Western Railway and it was a port on Lake Ontario.
The town eventually became industrialized with the opening of Cities Service Canada (later BP Canada, and now Petro Canada) and Shell Canada oil refineries (both now closed), the Procor factory (no longer manufacturing), and, most importantly, the Ford Motor Company's Canadian headquarters and plant, all close to the Canadian National Railway and the Queen Elizabeth Way highway between Toronto and Fort Erie (Buffalo).
In 1962, the town of Oakville merged with its neighbouring villages (Bronte, Palermo, Sheridan, and the remainder of Trafalgar Township) to become the new Town of Oakville.

By car[edit]
The Queen Elizabeth Way runs around the west end of Lake Ontario from Niagara Falls through Hamilton, Burlington, Oakville, Mississauga and becomes the Gardiner Expressway into downtown Toronto.  Through Oakville it merges with Highway 403.  Exit at Trafalgar Road for a quick route south into the downtown area.  Highways 401 and 407 (an expensive toll route) also pass further north of the town.
Oakville and the surrounding area are home to many daily commuters into Toronto, where most highways during peak hours are stop-and-go. As the main road from Toronto to Hamilton, the Queen Elizabeth Way often slows to a standstill. Exiting at Ford Drive and going south to Lakeshore or Cornwall Drive or north to Upper Middle Road (all major, parallel routes) may be a better idea if traffic is unusually bad.
