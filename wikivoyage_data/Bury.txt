Bury (pronounced "Berry") is a town and borough in Greater Manchester, in the North West of England, ten miles north of central Manchester. Bury is a former mill town known for manufacturing textiles. Now it is known for the open-air Bury Market and black pudding, the traditional local dish. In 2021 its population was 81,000.


Understand[edit]
Bury Town Hall
Bury grew rapidly from the 18th century as a textile town, at first for wool but later chiefly for cotton. Sir Robert Peel (1788-1850) was born here to a wealthy textile family, and founded the modern police force and served as British prime minister. The lot of Bury's mill workers was less fortunate, as the 19th-century town became overcrowded, squalid and rife with disease. Still they made a living, until the mid 20th century when the cotton industry collapsed, and much of the town became derelict. Historically within Lancashire, in 1974 Bury became part of Greater Manchester, and is nowadays primarily a commuter town. The borough also includes the more affluent suburbs of Prestwich and Whitefield (with long-established Jewish populations), Radcliffe, and (the most scenic) Ramsbottom on the edge of the Pennines.
Bury is indelibly linked to the black pudding, produced and consumed here in industrial quantities, and hurled over record-breaking distances at an annual contest in Ramsbottom.

Get in[edit]
See Manchester#Get_in for long-distance travel options. From Manchester Airport (MAN IATA) take the train or bus to Piccadilly then Bus 135 or tram to Bury.

By tram[edit]
Bury no longer has mainline trains, but it's a terminus of the Metrolink trams, green and yellow lines. These run downtown via Whitefield and Prestwich to Manchester Victoria station; the yellow line forks south to Piccadilly station, while the green line crosses city centre westwards and out to Old Trafford, Stretford, Sale and Altrincham. Change in city centre for the other lines to Salford Quays, Media City and Eccles, to Etihad Stadium and Ashton-under-Lyne, to Imperial War Museum and Trafford Centre (this line opened in Match 2020), to Wythenshawe and the airport, and to East Didsbury.
Trams normally run every 10 min or so between 6AM and 11:30PM. See TGM Metrolink website for fare deals, service updates and travel planner; you must buy your ticket before boarding.
53.5914-2.2971 Bury Interchange , off Haymarket Street, is in Fare Zone 4, so a ride to city centre costs £4.60 single. The same ticket would actually take you all the way to the airport, 90 min.

By bus[edit]
Castle Armoury is still used by the Territorial Army
First Manchester Bus 135 runs between Manchester Piccadilly and Bury every 10 min or so, taking 50 min. It also operates as a night bus late on Friday and Saturday. Bus 471 bus runs from Bolton, taking 30 min.

By car[edit]
Bury lies at the junction of the A56 and A58. From the M60, exit J17 to join the A56 (Manchester Road/Bury New Road). From the M66, exit J2 to join the A58 (Bolton Road).
There is plenty of parking available in and around Bury. Prices vary, according to the type of parking offered (e.g. private, council-run, multi-story, on-street) but they are pretty reasonable compared to city prices. Free parking is available for Metrolink users at most stops, so it may be an idea to leave the car and hop-on a tram for the day instead.

See Manchester#Get_around for ticket deals and passes for the bus & tram network.

By foot[edit]
Being a small town, most places in Bury are within walking distance (i.e. it will take you less than 20 min to walk from one side of the town to the other). If you are planning on venturing a little further out of the centre, then a bus may be useful.

By bicycle[edit]
There are many cycle lanes throughout Bury. For cycling enthusiasts, the TFGM website provides information on a few scenic routes around the more 'rural' outskirts.
The National Cycle Route 6 Passes through Bury, continuing along the old railway lines to Greenmount and Ramsbottom

By taxi[edit]
Private-hire taxis and black cabs are available within and around Bury. Private hire taxis cannot be hailed, they must be booked either in person from a taxi rank, or over the phone, or else the car's insurance is void. Prices on private hire taxis are quite reasonable and if there is more than one person travelling short distances, they often end up being cheaper than the equivalent bus fares.

See[edit]
Bury Parish Church
53.594-2.29691 Church of St Mary the Virgin, The Rock, Bury BL9 0AH. Anglican parish church on a high point just north of town centre. The previous 16th-century church was replaced in two stages, so the present spire dates from 1842 and the rest from 1876. Note the hammerbeam and tiebeam roof, mosaics, and stain-glass windows. It's a regimental church of the Lancashire Fusiliers, and in 2013 the military funeral of the murdered Fusilier Lee Rigby was held here.   (updated Aug 2019)
53.591733-2.2988542 Bury Art Museum & Sculpture Centre, Moss St, Bury BL9 0DR. Tu-F 10AM-5PM, Sa 10AM-4:30PM.

53.56-2.3263 Radcliffe is a village two miles south of Bury, on the same tram route. It's post-industrial and run-down, but see the 14th- to 15th-century Church of St Mary (Anglican) and the crumbling remnants of 15th-century Radcliffe Tower.
53.649-2.3184 Ramsbottom is a well-preserved mill village six miles north of Bury, hemmed in by the steep Pennine slopes, where streams surged down to power the mills. Its 19th-century Grant family may have been the model for the Cheeryble brothers in Charles Dickens' Nicholas Nickleby. They practised a rapaciously efficient "Truck System": employees were not paid in cash but in tokens that could only be spent on beer in the company-owned pub.

Watch football but alas not at Bury FC, you'll have to head into Manchester. In 2019 Bury won promotion to League One, the third tier of English soccer, but they collapsed financially and were thrown out of the League before they'd even kicked a ball in the 2019/20 season.
World Black Pudding Hurling Championships are held on the second Sunday of September outside The Oaks pub on Bridge St, Ramsbottom.
