Værøy is a small island in the Lofoten archipelago. The island has a mountainous ridge running through the center and flat farmland below the mountains. It is famous both for its scenery and the abundance of puffins who nest here over the summer.

67°39′59″N 12°38′54″EMap of Værøy

Cities[edit]
There are less than 800 inhabitants on the island, and most of them live in the town Sørland, in the flat farmland between the mountains.

Other destinations[edit]
Understand[edit]
Værøy is known to be the North-most point on Earth without a meteorological winter (i.e., the average temperature does not go below zero during winter). This said, it does freeze occasionally in winter. Most important, the weather can change very fast, and you can experience two seasons a day (fall and winter — do not expect any summer around here).

Talk[edit]
Norwegian of course. Most people speak English, though a little less than in the rest of Norway.

Get in[edit]
By helicopter[edit]
Plane flights are discontinued since a plane accident in 1990.
However, helicopter flights are still possible from Bodø (total flight time: 25 minutes).

Værøy is located around 1h30 by ferry from Moskenes and 5h45 from Bodø (via Røst).
Ferries are operated by Torghatten Nord.
There is no ferry terminal strictly speaking, but a small waiting room, toilets, and a tourist information that is only open during the first 30 minutes following the ferry arrival.
From the ferry, it is a 2km walk to Sørland.

Get around[edit]
By public transportation[edit]
There is no public transportation on Værøy.
Taxi service:

 Værøy Drosjeservice (Taxi), ☏ +47 99 41 4198, knut-hae@online.no. (updated Aug 2015)
By car[edit]
A large part of the island (in the West) is not reachable by car, and can be reached by foot only after a long walk passing by Nordland in the North of Værøy.
As of 2015, the road to the summit Heia is closed for cars.
Hence, a car is quite useless on Værøy.

By foot[edit]
Certainly the best way to explore Værøy.
An alternative is to cycle up to Nordland, and explore the rest of the island on foot. But this rules out the possibility to then climb to Heia and go back to Sørland, which can only be made on foot.

Do[edit]
Beaches[edit]

Hiking[edit]
Many hiking paths on the island, e.g.:

Going to the Nordlanshagen beach following the road (6km from Sørland)
Hiking to the Heia peak (2h one way from Sørland, 2h one way from Nordlanshagen).
Going to the Western (and much less reachable) part of the island (> 2h starting from Nordlanshagen), up to Måstad.
Paths are clearly marked, and generally in good state. This said, some paths are not easy at all, as they can become very steep, especially between Nordlanshagen and Hornet. In any case, expect much wind!
Also note that the maps given by the tourist information (and available at several points in Værøy) are quite erratic.

Buy[edit]
Due to the limited choice and the high prices, better bring your own food from the mainland.

Expensive (70kr for 100g of chocolate) but since you came all the way to here, you will buy something, won't you?. (updated Aug 2015)

No real restaurant, except the Cafè Supern (see below).

Stay safe[edit]
The most likely undesired event is to fall while hiking, or to catch a cold due to the bad weather.
Other than that, the island is perfectly safe.

Connect[edit]
Mobile phone networks do not cover the entire island. Concerning Internet, only edge network is available, and only in parts of the island (as of 2015).
Free Wi-Fi is available at the Cafè Supern.
