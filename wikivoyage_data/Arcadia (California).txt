Get around[edit]

The easiest way to get around Arcadia is via private automobile, as it is a primarily residential suburb in the Los Angeles area. Metro, the transportation agency of Los Angeles County, and Foothill Transit, another public transportation agency, run bus routes on major roads, such as Santa Anita Ave., Duarte Rd., Baldwin Ave., and Huntington Dr., but the buses run infrequently (about an hour's wait between buses for most routes), especially on weekends and holidays. Metro also operates the Gold Line light rail service to west to Pasadena and Downtown L.A. and east to Asuza, which stops in Arcadia at 1st Avenue and Santa Clara Street.

See[edit]
The beautiful historic Queen Anne House is in the Los Angeles County Arboretum.
34.1422-118.05361 Los Angeles County Arboretum, 301 North Baldwin Ave. Daily 9AM-5PM. Occupying the heart of the historic Rancho Santa Anita, The Los Angeles County Arboretum & Botanic Garden is a unique, 127-acre botanical garden and historical site jointly operated by the Los Angeles Arboretum Foundation and the Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation. Home to plant collections from all over the world, including many rare and endangered species, The Arboretum also houses outdoor historical landmarks representative of the major phases of California history. 
34.1406-118.04422 Santa Anita Park (Santa Anita Race Track), 285 W Huntington Dr, ☏ +1 626-574-7223. Santa Anita is the oldest thoroughbred race track in Southern California. The Art Deco-style grandstand dates back to the 1930s. In 2000, Santa Anita Race Track was listed on the National Trust for Historic Preservation's list of "America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places". The track was also home to a Japanese Internment Assembly Center during World War II. Today, the site is remembered with a historical marker near the entrance. 
Do[edit]
 Live Oak Library, 4153-55 E Live Oak Ave (between Foss and 10th on Live Oak Ave), ☏ +1 626-446-8803. Fancy hitting a library and just checking out some books? Rather obscure compared to the city library on the southwest corner of Duarte Rd. and Santa Anita Ave., the county library is very cozy and has a good selection of books. Its front is nearly invisible as it's small - there is a parking lot in the back, however, just turn the corner and slide through the small alley-like road right after (just follow the green signs marking the direction). 
 The Ruth and Charles Gilb Arcadia Historical Museum, 380 West Huntington Dr, ☏ +1 626-574-5440. Tu-Sa 10AM-4PM. Free. 
Buy[edit]
Westfield Shoppingtown (commonly known as Arcadia Mall) is on the northeast corner of Baldwin Avenue and Huntington Drive. It is right beside the famous Santa Anita Park.
American Life Plaza: Also in the same plaza as Joann, next to the Au 79 Tea House. Sells Asian trinkets, CDs, DVDs, and souvenir items.
Eat[edit]
Old storefront of the popular Ding Tai Fung Dumpling House
 May Mei (美味居), 639 W. Duarte Rd (just east of the intersection with Baldwin Ave, in the Arcadia Supermarket plaza), ☏ +1 626-574-1318. Su-Th 11AM - 10PM, F Sa 11AM - 10:30PM. Excellent Chinese restaurant near several others in the same plaza. Some customers' favorite is Beef Cubes French Style. Its clientele is mostly Chinese, but don't be intimidated! They speak English (although Mandarin is probably preferred) and their menus are bilingual. 
 J.J. Bakery, Baldwin Ave (just north of Duarte Rd). Rather popular and serves Taiwanese-style baked goods. 
 Din Tai Fung Dumpling House. While the chain's first North American location in Baldwin Plaza has closed permanently due to the COVID-19 pandemic, its location in the Westfield Santa Anita mall remains open. Popular and its Chinese food is said to be excellent. 
 In-N-Out, 420 N. Santa Anita Ave. More drive-thru than restaurant, although it has outside seating. Very popular, part of a unique southern California burger chain. Simple selection, good prices, excellent hamburgers.

Get there early for lunch unless you want to stand in a pretty long line. American tacos and burritos done well. Great hot sauce. Decent value. Can get crowded at lunchtime. Very little seating area.
