Thanjavur, also known as Thanjai or Tanjore, is a historic Chola-era city in Tamil Nadu, 342 km (213 mi) from Chennai. It is also considered the granary and 'rice bowl' of Tamil Nadu.


Understand[edit]
Brihadisvara temple, Thanjavur
Thanjavur thrived as the ancient capital of the Chola kingdom, later of Marathas and Nayaks. Thanjavur was at the height of its glory during the Chola period between the 10th and 14th centuries and became a great centre of learning and culture. The Chola Empire eventually grew into one of the most powerful empires India had ever seen under the rule of Rajaraja Chola I, also known to many Tamils as Rajaraja the Great, and his son, Rajendra Chola I. Under Rajendra Chola I, the capital was moved from Thanjavur to the nearby Gangaikondacholapuram.
An important landmark in Thanjavur is the great Brihadisvara Temple, also known as the Big Temple, built by Rajaraja Chola I. It is one of the most magnificent pieces of South Indian temple architecture. Established in 1011 CE in celebration of the victory of the Chola kingdom that extended to Ceylon and some parts of the Malaya archipelago. Now it is a world heritage site.
Even today Thanjavur is not only considered the rice bowl of Tamil Nadu but also many linguists consider it the cultural capital and the dialect of Tamil spoken here to be the purest form of the language. Though the Thanjavur district is dominated by agriculture, the town itself is diverse, having a literacy rate of more than 75% and a heterogeneous mix of populations of all religions. The presence of numerous Engineering colleges nearby has increased the student population in Thanjavur.
Thanjavur is very famous for its fine paintings done with studded gems and gold leaf.

Get around[edit]

By auto-rickshaw[edit]
Negotiate a rate with the driver before riding in an auto. Any place within the city costs a minimum of ₹80 to ₹100. The auto drivers will charge extra if you don't speak Tamil or don't negotiate well (if you seem like a pushover). Bargaining for the prices before alighting is a must.

By tourist cab[edit]
Tourist cabs are the best choice in case you want to tour the temples around Thanjavur. Drivers don't follow a fixed method for charging. But it's wise to negotiate at least the rates that are applicable in Chennai.

By cycle rickshaw[edit]
Though not popular among the locals, foreign travellers usually hire cycle rickshaws to go around Thanjavur. One can inquire about the hotel's service desk for help.

By town bus[edit]
Town buses are the cheapest means of transport for moving within the town. The maximum price of a ticket is less than ₹20. However, buses in peak hours are crowded and are filled with office goers and college students. The stopping name is Cholan Silai where you can see the statue of Rajaraja Chola I.
