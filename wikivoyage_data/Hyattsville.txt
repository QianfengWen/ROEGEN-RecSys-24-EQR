Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Before Europeans reached the area, the area was the home of the Nacotchtank people. Because of diseases and violence from Europeans, the Nacotchtank moved away and joined other nearby Native American tribes. Hyattsville was founded by Christopher Clark Hyatt, who purchased the land in 1845. Hyatt named the area after himself. The City of Hyattsville was incorporated on April 7, 1886. Victorian homes were built in the late 1880s. Sears bungalows and arts-and-crafts style homes were from the late 1910s through the early 1940s. Hyattsville has 21 historic sites according to the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission.
