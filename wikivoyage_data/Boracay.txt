White Beach
Boracay[dead link] is a tropical island about an hour's flight from Metro Manila in the Philippines. It has superb long white sand beaches and is one of the country's most developed tourist destinations. White Beach, Boracay placed 2nd in Condé Nast Traveler's 25 Best Island Beaches in the World: Readers' Choice Awards in 2020. 
Facilities are available to suit different levels of activity. Facilities for the usual water sports activities such as sailing, wind surfing, snorkeling, diving and jet skiing are also widely available for those in search of more active pursuits. The fun in Boracay also doesn't end when the sun sets. Boracay nightlife is pulsating with many bars and restaurants serving food, drink and fun until the very late evening.
Boracay is an excellent choice for anyone who wants a full range of facilities in a prime tropical location and can pay for it.  However, it is not a good bet for bargain hunters; prices are relatively high by Philippines standards, though moderate by Japanese or Western standards and lower than many places in the Mediterranean, Caribbean or South Pacific.
Since reopening in October 2018, there are new rules and regulations, and a limit to the number of tourists allowed on the island. You must have a hotel pre-booked before they will let you get on the boat to Boracay. There is no eating or drinking on the beach, no smoking, no fire dancing, and no commercial sandcastles. In addition, no chairs, loungers or umbrellas are allowed on the beach, so think carefully about whether to visit if you are disabled, elderly or just want to avoid direct sunlight and sit on the beach. Be prepared to be offered a massage, boat ride, parasailing, kite surfing, sail boating, hair braiding, island hopping, and henna tattoo every 20 steps on the beach's "sidewalk" path.


Understand[edit]
Orientation[edit]
There are dozens of beaches on the island, and White Beach being the longest and the most popular of them, where all life goes on, it occupies roughly all western part of the island. On the opposite side of the island (eastern) there is a main kitesurfer's beach - Bulabog. Other beaches are much smaller and tranquil. All parts of Boracay are interconnected with the help of the Main Boracay road which runs from South to North through all island.
White Beach is several kilometers long and thus it's divided into three parts (from south to north): Station 1, Station 2, Station 3.

Climate[edit]
During the dry season (November-April; the northeast monsoon or amihan blows from December to March), White Beach is calm and very suitable for swimming, etc. The other side of the island has large winds and waves making it suitable for wind surfing, wave running, etc. During the rainy season (June-October), when the southwest monsoon (habagat) blows, this is reversed, with a risk of typhoons.  White Beach often gets large winds and waves which sometimes makes it unsuitable for swimming. Current weather conditions can be found online.

Get in[edit]
11°57′34″N 121°55′36″EMap of Boracay
Whether you go by plane or by boat, the port of entry for Boracay Island is the small town of Caticlan on the mainland. Outrigger boats (bancaa) leave every few minutes from 11.9277121.94951 Caticlan's jetty port. The short boat trip to 11.9406121.93922 Boracay's jetty port at Cagban costs ₱25. There are two jetty ports in Caticlan (Caticlan and Tabon) and two jetty ports on Boracay (Cagban and Tambisaan). Because of the wind during September (or low season months), the jetty port furthest from the airport (Tabon) will be used to take you to Tambisaan port. Tourists have to pay a terminal fee of ₱100 and an environmental fee of ₱75. Tricycles are available at Cagban to bring passengers to their hotels.  Tricycle fare is from ₱20 per pax up to ₱150 per trip depending where your resort is.

By plane[edit]
There are two airports serving Boracay.
11.9248121.9533 Caticlan or Godofredo P. Ramos Airport (MPH IATA), ☏ +63 36 288 7111. Much smaller and closer airport, only a few kilometers away from Caticlan Jetty Port and Tabon Port. It now handles jet flights to Manila operated by Philippines Airlines and Cebu Pacific, as well as turboprop aircraft from Cebu operated by Cebgo, PAL Express and SkyJet.  The airline will drop you off at the east side of the airport. After exiting the airport on at east side, find the tricycle stand across the street, past the various resort offerings. A tricycle from the airport to the Tabon jetty is ₱50 per person. Ground transportation. From the Caticlan airport, you can either take a tricycle (₱50) or walk (10 minutes) to Caticlan Jetty Port. Besides, Cebu Pacific offers hotel transfer for ₱350 per person. (updated Jul 2016)
11.686942122.37934 Kalibo International Airport (KLO IATA), 2 km away from Kalibo and 70 km away from Caticlan Jetty, ☏ +63 36 262 3264. This airport can handle jet aircraft such as Boeing 737 and Airbus A320, however it is much farther from Boracay than Caticlan airport. Its international destinations include Beijing, Busan, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Taipei, Singapore, Shanghai and Seoul, operated by Cebu Pacific, China Airlines, Philippine Airlines and AirAsia. Domestic flights are from both Cebu and Manila. There is a ₱200 terminal fee for domestic flights and ₱700 for international (2016).Ground transportation. There are vans, minibus shuttles and buses that serve travellers between Kalibo International Airport and Caticlan Jetty Port. A van and ferry ride takes 1½-2 hours and costs ₱250, and ₱300 for an AC bus. Additionally you will be asked to pay environmental taxes and terminal fees of ₱175 on top of the fare. Besides, AirAsia offers hotel transfers for ₱520 per person. (updated Jul 2016)

By boat[edit]
Ferry from Batangas City to Caticlan port. Operated by 2GO travel. Departs Batangas port at 9PM and gets to Caticlan port at 6AM. Departs Caticlan port at 8AM and gets to Batangas port at 6PM. One way fares from ₱995.
Ferry from Batangas City port to Caticlan port. Another option is to start your journey with Philtranco, Alps, Dimple, Ceres or Rodastco coaches which leave at regular intervals throughout the day from Cubao, serving the Manila-Caticlan route for ₱1200. Rodastco also offers a door-to-door service with pick-ups anywhere in Metro Manila.  The contact numbers for trip booking are +63 2-7326891 or +63 917-3820426, or +63 919-3820426.
The more challenging do-it-yourself version goes as follows: The easiest way would be to book a straight trip that allows you to purchase just one ticket from Cubao terminal to Caticlan Port. The cost is ₱1000-1200. But if you really want to save money, you can also commute from Cubao bus terminal station (near Alimall). There is really no difference except for the fact that you need to purchase tickets at every stop. Cubao-Batangas: best leave between 7-8PM so you arrive in Batangas Port before 10PM. Batangas-Calapan: the trip takes 2 hours via cargo ship or an hour to one hour and a half via supercat. Do not purchase tickets for the Calapan to Roxas van as this can either be a scam or you end up squeezed in one van along with several other passengers with tickets. Calapan-Roxas: takes about 4 hours. Make sure you leave early so you arrive before 4AM. In the morning, the ship to Caticlan usually leaves at 2AM and 4AM and the next trip won't be until 10AM. The 10AM trip usually leaves late. This is the best time to leave travel via Cubao to Roxas. You arrive in Caticlan at 8AM and you are left to enjoy the rest of your day in Boracay.
7107 Islands Cruise[dead link] offers a cruises from Boracay to Puerto Galera to Boracay, prices range from ₱2000-10000, children below than 3 years old are free to travel who is accompanied by 2 adults, children from 5 to 12 years old are given a 50% discount, who are accompanied also by 2 adults while senior citizens can avail a 20% discount. The cruise will tour around the Philippines in islands such as Boracay and Coron Island.

By road and ferry (RoRo)[edit]
The "Nautical Highway" is a combination of overland highways and roll-on, roll-off (RoRo) vessels that allow you to bring your vehicle up to Panay Island and visit key cities like Kalibo. Taking your car all the way to Boracay, though, is not possible. Public transport also operates on the same route, and is the most cost-effective way of traveling between Manila and Boracay. Assuming good connections, the total journey time is around 12 hours.
The easiest way of arranging this is to book a van in Manila by contacting private operators such as Angel Star (+63 2 783-0886 c/o Abner) and Gope (+63 2 732-6891 c/o Cesar). This will enable you to book a straight trip from Metro Manila to Caticlan at the cost of ₱1200, more or less. Their group operates several passenger vans which can load 10-14 or 15-18 persons. You book the trip exclusively or share with fellow travellers. The van leaves at 9PM daily from Manila, travelling through Batangas-Calapan-Roxas (arrives Roxas at 5AM or 6AM) to catch the 8AM or 10AM ferry/boat to Caticlan, where you are expected to arrive between noon to 2PM. Before proceeding to Boracay Island though, be sure to get your return ticket (Roxas-Manila) at the Caticlan Ferry Terminal (inquire about the updated schedule from the staff of the van operators). Take an early dinner before boarding the van and bring water and something to eat while in transit. Riding a van gives you a more relaxed pace to Caticlan because you do not have to stop in many sub-destinations which lengthen your trip and therefore can be truly tiresome.

Get around[edit]
Motorised tricycle taxisMost visitors opt for motorized tricycles, which act as the island's taxis and make up most of its traffic.  Rides are inexpensive, usually no more than ₱100 for individual (per tricycle, not shared with other people) ride to any point on the island, and can be found almost anywhere along the main road. As the tricycle seats are right above the vehicle exhausts, there can be a little pollution however - bring a handkerchief if you tend to be easily bothered by this sort of thing.
From Cagban Port to Station 1, the most that you should pay is ₱25 per head. That is, if you don't mind sharing the tricycle with other tourists. If you don't want to rent the tricycle and allow the driver to pick up other passengers along the way, say you just want the "Individual" price and not "Special".
Short rides on busy routes, say from D'Mall to Station 3 or from Station 1 to Station 3, are a standard rate of ₱20 per passenger, but expect the tricycle driver to ask for ₱40 or more if you look like a foreigner. Long rides, like Puka beach to D'Mall, should cost around ₱40. Drivers waiting near beaches, hotels, etc., generally ask higher price like ₱150-200, even if you're alone. It may be worth bargaining if there are a few people with you and you want an individual ride - otherwise, better catch a passing tricycle on the main road.
From Tambisaan jetty port to Station 2 D'Mall, the most that you should pay is ₱20 per head on the solar bus.

Scooters provide the best flexibility at a reasonable price. The downside is having to deal with island traffic which can be unnerving for visitors unused to the aggressive tricycle drivers. Prices are exorbitant, starting at ₱1200 per day rental (2016).
Mountain bikes are also available for rent at several locations along White Beach, which is off limits to motorized vehicles.
To explore around the island, rent a native sailboat (paraw) or motorized outrigger (banca) and visit the many beaches of Boracay.
See[edit]
White Beach
11.9594121.9251 White Beach. This is what most people are here for, but there are environmental rules and the beach is a challenge for people with disabilities. It is a lovely stretch of powdery white sand against azure water, it's also the commercial center of the island. The long beach is divided into three sections, Station 1, Station 2, and Station 3. Station 1 is the northernmost and has the widest beachfront, where prime hotels and resorts are located. Accommodations are pricier, but quality is generally the best as well. Station 2 is the commercial and geographical center of white beach. This is the center of it all for shopping, eating, partying, and etc. That said, the beach here is also the most crowded, and the area the nosiest. Station 3 is the southernmost section; quieter than station 2, it is the least developed, and also the lowest priced. All of White Beach from the northernmost tip of Station 1 to the southernmost of Station 3 (~4 km) is open to the public, so one can relax and/or swim wherever they like, regardless of hotel location.In every station, there are two lifeguards patrolling on foot equipped with whistle, life buoy and hand-held radio. The boat station 2 is the lifeguard and rescue command center. 
Puka Beach
11.9961121.91482 Puka Beach. A quiet stretch of white sand along the northern tip of the island, Puka Beach is an image of what most people expect on a tropical island: white sand, azure water, and relatively empty. This is where locals gather the small puka shells for some of the jewelry that is sold on the island so expect the sand to be more coarse than on White Beach. The water tends to be a little rougher on this side of the island but it is much quieter. Similarly, there are fewer services—there are only a couple of restaurants, but you likely won't have a problem getting a cold drink or an ice cream as there are a few vendors that patrol the beach. The main road in Boracay terminates at Puka Beach therefore you'll be able to hire a tricycle to get there in less than 10–15 minutes from central White Beach. Make sure you arrange a pickup if it is a quiet day and no tricycles are hanging around the beach. Most people experience Puka as one of their sailboat or banca stops during a day trip. This is a good spot for a picnic, but be sure to bring your trash home with you. 
11.9797121.90953 Baling Hai Beach. This is a quiet little cove just north of Diniwid Beach, where you can enjoy swimming, snorkeling and dining in a relaxed, peaceful environment. There are some fantastic views from the clifftop restaurant. Baling Hai is often included as a stop-off on an island boat tour. 
11.9638121.93024 Bulabog Beach. Come there on a windy days to see kiteboarders doing high jumps and crazy tricks. 
 The Bat Cave. You will see in several tour guides and maps of Boracay something called the Bat Cave, which houses many small insectivorous bats (the larger fruit bats roost in the trees on the hillside above Punta Bunga Beach), and locals will be more than happy to accompany you there for a fee, or "tip". The cave is on the western-end of the island and down several dirt roads. The guide will then take you on a short hike through the forest to the mouth of a cave, which drops down at a very steep angle. The mouth of the cave is littered with large boulders, and is extremely difficult to enter and walk down. There is no visible path, no handrail, and the stones are extremely slippery with slime and bat guano, as well as extremely dangerous, since the cave is at such an extreme angle. Also, the air inside the cave is very warm and humid, and in addition to the amount of guano, is very difficult to breathe. Additionally, several snakes live inside the cave. Caution should be taken by those visiting and entering the cave. There are bats in the cave, but down at the bottom of it in the dark, and unless you have a flashlight or are there at dusk, you won't see them. The ceiling of the cave is interesting, however, with multiple, small stalactites. Just nearby, you can find another cave, called "crystal" cave which has a lot of stalactites and a hole on the opposite site of the entrance, from which you can watch out to the sea if you dare to climb up to it. You will have to pay ₱50 entry-fee to visit both caves for the family that owns the land, in addition to paying your guide. Visiting both caves can cost up to ₱2500 for the guide, but this is the "rich tourist price", so try to bargain if you like. 
Do[edit]
Scuba diving[edit]
For those interested in scuba diving, there are dozens of dive centers along White Beach. Cost is typically ₱1600 per dive for certified divers which includes rental of all equipment. The dive centers, under the Boracay Business Administration of Scuba Schools (BBASS), have agreed on standard prices amongst themselves so prices will be the same at all centers. This is to ensure that dive centers could focus on quality and scuba diving safety rather than price wars. There are 25-30 dive sites within 10–20 minutes boat ride from the beach, suitable for beginners up to advanced level. Dives range from 'Angol Point' (10m), through 'Crocodile Island' (22-25m), a straightforward wall dive, up to 'Yapak'- a deep wall dive suitable for only the most experienced divers due to strong currents, although there is the possibility of seeing sharks and stingrays.

Boat tours[edit]
Boat trip on a sunset
The best way to see the beauty of Boracay and its various beaches is by Paraw (native outrigger sailboat). You will be constantly asked if you want to take a boat trip, as there are literally dozens of companies offering this service. It is better to go with a reputable and established group such as Allen Fun Tours (motorized banca boat tours) or Red Pirates (paraw sailing) to ensure your safety and avoid being overcharged.

Kiteboarding[edit]
Kites on Bulabog beach
Boracay's Bulabog beach claims to be the best kitesurfing destination in Asia. The season runs from November through to April with onshore winds varying between 12-30 knots. A small lagoon (2 km wide) is protected from waves by a coral reef. The water becomes almost flat at low tide, making it easy to start learning kitesurfing and continue with freestyle tricks. Because of its nice conditions, the spot becomes overcrowded with riders in high season. A serious disadvantage is sewage pollution of the lagoon, so smell from water and infections from even small injuries are common.

Skimboarding[edit]
Skimboards are available for rent at several places along White Beach. But be sure to hire an expert to teach you the skills; a one-hour lesson from a local rider is usually around ₱300.

Massage and spa[edit]
Budget[edit]
Along White Beach you will be approached frequently by women offering to give you a massage, which they will do on the spot or on a towel laid out on the beach - your choice.
A bit more organized, White Beach also has several "Massage Stations": collections of masseurs that have their mats set up. The stations are typically open as long as there are customers around but in general start to shut down just after sunset.
For Swedish, Accupressure, Shiatsu, etc., visit Abe (pronounced Abby) the blind masseur who operates outside Cocoloco restaurant in Angol (south of boat station 3). Only ₱300 per hour.
There is a great outdoor massage station in the beach area of Nigi Nigi Beach Resort, where they have two tables set up. The booth is draped with curtains which they will close if you wish, or leave open if you want to watch the people on the beach. They offer every massage in the book, and charge ₱500 for one hour.
Mid-range[edit]
 Bella Isa Salon & Spa. A little spot on the beach in Station 3 with upscale decor and professional staff. They provide a full range of services including massage, facials, foot spa, and hair services. 
There are several smaller/mid-range spas in Boracay that offer a menu including massages, scrubs and facials but don't quite have the facilities to be considered a full spa. Most hotels in Boracay offer a limited spa menu that falls into this category.
Splurge[edit]
Caesar's, found along the main road near boat station 3, specializes in Thai massage and uses two masseurs simultaneously to deliver the service. A 90-minute massage is priced at US$50.
 Tirta SPA. — found in Sitio Malabunot, Manoc-Manoc, area. Indian treatments in a stunning environment. Friendly and helpful staff. It is a good idea to compare prices between Tirta Spa, Mandala Spa, and Shangri-La Boracay to find the best deal. (updated Jul 2022)
Other[edit]
 Ariel's Point. Ariel’s Point is an affordable eco-adventure destination for Boracay travellers who want to experience the natural splendor of the Philippines and meet fellow travellers. Located 30 minutes away from Station 1 by outrigger boat, Ariel’s Point allows travelers to enjoy a wide array of adventurous activities such as cliff diving (the destination has five different platforms ranging in height from 3 meters to 15 meters), snorkeling, and paddling in an unspoiled setting with volcanic caves, mangrove forests, turquoise coves, and remote beaches. Visitors can reach Ariel’s Point by purchasing tickets at Ariel's House (along the White Beach in front of the Boracay Beach Club) before 11AM on the day of departure. ₱2000 for round-trip boat transfer, a BBQ buffet, unlimited drinks (bottled water, beer, soda, rum), and access to cliff diving, snorkeling, kayaking. 
 Parasailing. Take a parasailing tour around the island, to explore quiet beaches and snorkel sites. Ask your crew to organize a romantic BBQ on the beach with fresh grilled seafood, if you like. Cruise back at sunset to experience breathtaking views. 
 Motorbiking. It is worth hiring motorbikes or scooters out to explore the island, as there are other beautiful beaches on the other side of the island that are even better for snorkeling that will be completely deserted. Hire them for a couple of days and you should get a discount. The roads are a bit dodgy, and some are still being constructed, but it's a good laugh and better than plunking yourself on a patch of white sand and seeing nothing. 
 Horseriding. Horse riding is a fun activity in Boracay. Get off the beaten path and experience villages and scenery most other visitors don't get to see. All levels of experience are catered to. Ask a tricycle to take you to the Boracay Horse Riding Stables. 
Buy[edit]
Along White Beach, especially around Station 2, there is a wide variety of gift shops and boutiques along the beach path. In addition to the crowded stalls that you expect in Asia, Boracay also has several high-end stores including clothing, art and household items. Some places will permit you to haggle, others have a fixed pricing system with price tags. Shop around as prices vary. Outside of White Beach, the shopping becomes sparse or non-existent. D'Mall at Station 2 and D'Talipapa at Station 3, between the main road and White Beach, have many shops. D'Mall is larger but D'Talipapa features a number of shops, vegetable merchants and a large meat market also selling a large selection of live seafood. Prices at D'Talipapa (including those for basic necessities such as milk, vegetables and meat) are about 25% below those of D'Mall.
While walking or laying on the sand, anywhere on Boracay, you'll be approached to buy a variety of items including jewelry made of shells, fresh fruit, ice cream, sunglasses or a nice massage.

Shell jewelry — similar to what you can find elsewhere in the world, the jewelry made of shells is popular as for the most part it is made locally from shells found on Puka Beach.
 Paulo Collection BodyWear, D'Mall, Bamboo Beach Resort, PC Main, ☏ +63 36 288 3448. Variety of beach wear and other souvenir items. (updated Feb 2023)
Malls and supermarkets[edit]
 CityMall Boracay, Tambisaan Jetty Port Road. 8AM-10PM. A new shopping mall with a big Savemore supermarket and many fast food outlets. (updated Feb 2016)
ATMs[edit]
There are about 10 ATMs of the following banks: PNB, Metrobank, BPI, and RCBC, on the entire island for the 16,000 inhabitants plus tourists, and when they run out of cash, they are not refilled until the next business day. On weekends and holidays ATMs might go several days without being refilled. Almost all of them accept Visa, MasterCard, and UnionPay cards. Maximum one time withdrawal is ₱10000 with compulsory fee for overseas cards of ₱250.
Many establishments, including the tricycles, cannot break a bill over ₱500, so it pays to always have small bills.
Foreign money (U.S. dollars, UK pounds, euros, Korean won, Japanese yen, etc.) can be exchanged at several locations around the island. It's worth checking around for the best exchange rate, as all places don't offer the same rate. You're best off heading away from the beach for better rates.

Eat[edit]
Because of its wide draw of international travelers, Boracay has a wide variety of places to eat, including a surprising number of bakeries. The majority of the restaurants are located on the White beach and a short pedestrian street called 11.9628121.9261 D'Mall, nearly all of these places are quite expensive (average meal costing ₱300-500). Cheaper options can be found near D'Talipapa Market, at the 11.9623121.926362 D'Mall Palenke (street run parallel to D'Mall in 50 m of it), and perhaps about half of the restaurants along the Main road.
As a side note, don't miss the opportunity to enjoy one of the best mangoes in the world. The climate in Philippines is perfect for mangoes, so you always get them mellow and sweet.

Sleep[edit]
Accommodation varies from top-of-the-line hotels and resorts to a simple bed rented from a resident. Whatever your budget, you can easily find a suitable place to stay. During peak periods such as Holy Week, Christmas and New Year, rooms are more difficult to find and more expensive, so book in advance.
Staying along White Beach gets you closer to the bars, lounging and food, while staying closer to Bulabog beach gives you better access to the popular wind and kiteboarding areas.
Boracay is notorious for travel agents (many in Manila) passing themselves off as the resorts, often through websites. When you call them to get a room rate or make a reservation, you will be quoted much more than if you called the resort itself. The travel agents simply take your request, call the hotel and make reservations and charge you extra for the service, up to double the original rate. Meanwhile, the traveler has no idea he wasn't talking to the resort. This can often lead to frustration, as the traveler will show up at his hotel or resort and see he was charged double the rate that the hotel is listing, even though the hotel had nothing to do with it! So the advice is, try your best to ignore the many travel agencies and make your reservation with the resort or hotel directly.
Better yet, don't make advance reservations in the low season. Just go to White Beach or the region you want to stay and negotiate deals with the places you want to stay at. Many street touts will offer to show you the rooms first and then you can negotiate.

White beach on Boracay Island
If you prefer peace and quiet, avoid accommodation at the center of White Beach, as this is the most crowded area. Head further north or south instead.

North of Station 1 you'll find many of the more luxurious (and expensive) establishments. The beach is at its widest here, and the area is usually relatively peaceful.

It is protected from strong seas by a coral reef located 500 m (1,600 ft) offshore, and from late October to April the amihan (northeast monsoon winds) makes this beach very popular with windsurfers and kiteboarders. Bulabog Beach has the "old" Boracay atmosphere, being less developed than the White Beach area, quieter, more laid back, with onshore breezes most of the year, and a number of foreign residents have made it their home. In addition, resorts are starting to appear and the various types of water-sports (parasailing, banana boats, jetskis, waterskiing, etc.) are using this area during the White Beach off-season (May-October, when the habagat or the southwest monsoon wind blows). Access to D'Mall is only a 5 minute walk and a couple of minutes later you are on White Beach with all the crowds, restaurants, bars, discos, etc.
The sea at Bulabog is polluted with raw sewage from the whole island. You can see seawge pipes emptying into sea. Since the lagoon is semi-closed and shallow, and water circulation is limited, this produces a bad smell. The color of it will block all your thoughts about swimming there and lot of kiters will simply not allow you to. As a result, staying on Bulabog beach is not recommended if you want to enjoy the beach.

Stay safe[edit]
Algal bloom caused by raw sewage entering the ocean around Boracay
Sewage water pollution is one of the biggest problems in Boracay: raw sewage is piped directly into the sea. Some areas, like Bulabog beach, have been made completely unswimmable due to this problem. However, it puts the swimming safety of the entire island under serious threat.
Power outages still happen often (2016) and can last from several minutes to several hours. On the bright side however, substantial parts of more expensive resorts have back-up generators which solve the problem almost entirely.

Connect[edit]
Internet connections are pretty slow anywhere on the island. Wi-Fi can be found everywhere from splurge hotels to small guesthouses but again it's pretty crappy. Small Internet cafes exist but not widespread.
3G/4G is provided by mobile operators Smart and Globe.
