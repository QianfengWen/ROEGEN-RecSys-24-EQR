Hammond is a Chicagoland city of some 76,000 people (2019) in Lake County, Indiana—bordering Chicago's Far Southeast Side. Most visitors will find themselves passing through or on business, but Chicagoans would do well to include it in a close-in Lake County day trip, if for no other reason than to get some good food, perhaps stock up on fireworks, and realize that Chicagoland doesn't stop at the state line!


Understand[edit]
Hammond's city center
It may come as a surprise to other Hoosiers that Hammond is the state's sixth largest city. Its history and culture, as with nearly all of Indiana's Lake Michigan coast, is inextricably linked to a big blue-collar industrial workforce. While the industrial economy is not what it once was, Hammond is still in decent shape, with a big new casino drawing in visitors from the Chicagoland area. 

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The big highways cutting east west across the city are I-90 and I-94/I-80, both of which head east towards Gary and I-65 towards Indianapolis, and west towards Chicago and its south suburbs. The biggest north south streets are Calumet Ave (US-41) and Indianapolis Blvd (IN-152). Both lead into the city coming from Chicago in the north, and are a far more interesting drive than the big highways.

By train[edit]
The South Shore Line, which stretches from Chicago's East Loop to Indiana's South Bend, has one stop at 41.630833-87.5158331 Hammond station , located at 4531 Hohman Avenue, and another literally on the East Chicago/south Hammond border. Tickets are $4.75 per way. Amtrak offers a limited service on its Wolverine route between Chicago and Pontiac via Detroit. These trains calls at 41.691111-87.5066672 Hammond-Whiting  station, located in the Robertsdale neighborhood of north Hammond at 1135 North Calumet Ave.

By plane[edit]
The closest airport is certainly Gary/Chicago International Airport GYY IATA, but there are a lot more flights coming into Chicago Midway MDW IATA, which is about a 30 minute drive without heavy traffic.

Do[edit]
41.6996-87.51461 Hammond Lakefront Park and Bird Sanctuary (Overpass from Route 41 towards Horseshoe casino, then double back under the ramp to the guard shack for entry.). Beautiful Lake Michigan beach access and woodland walking trail. Great for observing birds. Plenty of people swim here, and there are lifeguards in the summer. You can gaze out across the lake and see the Chicago skyline. (updated Nov 2020)
41.6725-87.520832 Wolf Lake Boardwalk (accessible from Wolf Lake Memorial Park on east shore.). For an interesting juxtaposition, try this boardwalk weaving through a tapestry of nature and industry as it courses through the Wolf Lake basin and articulates with several other trails. (updated Nov 2021)
41.69411-87.506673 Horseshoe Hammond, 777 Casino Center Dr, ☏ +1 219 473-7000. Gaming entertainment. (updated Nov 2021)

Horseshoe Casino
Buy[edit]
Hammond and the rest of the cities immediately bordering Chicago across the state line are well known among Chicagoans for fireworks and far cheaper cigarettes. Indeed, here you'll find big box stores selling cases of either—the easiest to reach being on Calumet Ave just north of I-94/I-80.

Eat[edit]
41.632261-87.5097271 Cavalier Inn, 735 Gostlin Street, ☏ +1 219-933-9314. 9AM-8PM. Cavalier Inn serves many good Polish dishes, and many good burgers and roasts too. The bar has Polish beers and liquors. The inside is very pretty and there is a lot of parking adjacent. The restaurant is a pleasant, two-block walk from the Hammond South Shore Line train station, for those who want to take a day trip from downtown Chicago. (updated Feb 2019)
 Madvek's Dog House, 6923 Calumet Ave, ☏ +1 219 932-1060. Best known for serving great hot dogs, 50-year-old Madvek's also makes a hard-to-find "loose meat hamburger," where the hamburger meat is sauteed with onions and butter, and served loose in the bun, somewhat like a sloppy joe. It's an unassuming-looking place, but you'll be glad you stepped inside. 
 Schoop's Hamburgers, 7235 Indianapolis Blvd, ☏ +1 219 845-7090. M-Sa 10:30AM-9PM, Su 11AM-9PM. A Northwestern Indiana chainlet, Schoops has pretty great handmade burgers in another rare style you probably haven't seen before. The patty is thin, crisp, crunchy—almost sort of caramelized!. $3-8.   
 Taco Real, 935 E Hoffman St, ☏ +1 219 932-8333. Probably the restaurant to go to for Mexican in the region, this place has great chicken in mole, pork tacos, and queso fundido. It is a little on the pricey side, though—for Mexican in Northwest Indiana! Very surprisingly, they have good micro-brews on tap at the full bar. 
Drink[edit]
 Billy Bear's Bar & Grill, 1225 169th Street, ☏ +1 219 844-1441. Noon-2AM. Billy Bear's is also a good place to drink draft beer. They have Old Style and MGD, and a small pitcher is only about $3.00. There is also a pool table, and dart board, and jukebox that plays mostly Classic Rock. Decor is Harley motorcycles and bikers. Sometimes they close early so be sure to call ahead. 
 Flat Rock Tap, 6732 Calumet Avenue. 11AM-1AM. The Flat Rock Tap has a wider variety of beers on tap, although they charge much more per glass. They have fancy local beers like those from the Three Floyds Brewery, but also have European beers on tap and bottled. There is usually live music on Thursday nights.

Chicago is the obvious nearby destination, but if you are up for staying far off the beaten path, exploring Lake County a bit can be quite rewarding. Check out the historic planned industrial-utopian community of Marktown, Meyer's Castle in Dyer, the confounding ruins of Gary, or even the far-off-the-beaten-path parts of Chicago just west, in the city's Far Southeast Side.
