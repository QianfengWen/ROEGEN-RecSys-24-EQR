Rachel is an unincorporated rural town in Nevada located off of Nevada State Highway 375 (which is also known as the "Extraterrestrial Highway"). The theme around the town is an alien/space theme, because of Rachel's proximity to Nellis Air Force Range and Area 51. There is not much to do around the small town, however, although it enjoys some tourism from people interested in UFOs, aliens, and aviation.

See[edit]





Note: Several signs near the boundary of Area 51 have also become tourist attractions, though they are under surveillance by cameras, armed guards, and aircraft. Guards are posted near these sites to ensure you do not attempt to enter Area 51, though it is unlikely they will stop you from viewing these signs.





There are not many tourist attractions. There was a large logo for Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) on the ground in the northern part of town which claimed to be the first logo to be seen from outer space. There was an Area 51 Research Center operated in the late 1990s by UFO researcher Glenn Campbell, but it is now closed. There is one motel. The area remains popular for geocaching.
