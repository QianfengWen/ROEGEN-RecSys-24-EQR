Ellicottville is a village in the Southern Tier of New York. It is famous for its ski resorts, Holiday Valley and HoliMont, the former has been ranked the number 4 ski resort in the Eastern United States.


Get in[edit]
US 219 runs north from I-86, and south from Buffalo. NY242 runs into the village.
The closest airport is in Buffalo, as is the closest Amtrak station. However, driving to Buffalo is not hard at all: take the 219 north to the end of the road at the New York State Thruway (I-90), then get off at Exit 53 (I-190 north). Downtown Buffalo is five minutes past the exit.
Fullington Trailways, an intercity bus provider, runs once daily through the village, northbound from Pennsylvania during lunch hour, and southbound from Buffalo during early afternoon. The Seneca Allegany Casino also operates a shuttle between Salamanca and Ellicottville on weekends, several times a day.

Get around[edit]
Within the village of Ellicottville (downtown), you do not need a car, as the village is very compact and everybody walks. Everything you want to see or do is on or near Washington Street, the main thoroughfare. However, if you are going from town to the ski resorts, you will need a car. Holiday Valley is about a mile (2 km) from the village on US 219, and HoliMont is on NY 242 before you enter the village.

Because Ellicottville is known as the "Aspen of the East", there are many ski- and snowboard-specific shops. A good tip for those looking to buy new skis or snowboards is to wait till the end of the season. Prices are typically $200-300 lower than what they would be at the beginning and during the ski season. Typically, prices go down in mid-March, which means you can still get a couple of weeks in before the resorts close.
