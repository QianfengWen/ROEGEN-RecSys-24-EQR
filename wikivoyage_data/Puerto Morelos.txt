Puerto Morelos is a town in Quintana Roo on the Yucatán Peninsula, about 20 km south of Cancún. It is a fishing village, and a resort and diving destination. It is roughly halfway between Cancún and Playa del Carmen on the Caribbean coast of the Yucatán Peninsula.  The pier in the center of town hosts snorkel and sport fishing boats while yachts dock in a man-made harbor just south of town.  The village used to be the embarkation point for the car ferry to Cozumel, but that now leaves from Calica, a major port south of Playa del Carmen.


Understand[edit]
The original Lighthouse at Puerto Morelos, Mexico as shown in February 2007. In 1967, the structure was tilted over by the winds of Hurricane Beulah. This leaning lighthouse has since survived Hurricanes Gilbert in 1987 and Wilma in 2005, but has not been knocked down. A new functional light house for the port is visible in the background. The old Leaning Lighthouse (Faro Inclinado) remains as a symbol of the town.
It's the ideal location for those who want a quiet beach vacation away from the glitz, but with ample tourist amenities. The town has just two principal streets and you can walk from one end to the other in about 15 minutes.
You can get by with English, but Spanish is not superfluous. Most places accept US dollars but not credit cards. Almost all prices are quoted in Mexican pesos (M$) and it is generally cheaper to pay in pesos than in US dollars.  There is no bank in town, but several bank cash machines for withdrawals. There are a couple of bank branches at the commercial area by La Colonia where Calle Jose Maria Morelos meets Highway 307.
The reef just off shore is part of the Great Mesoamerican Reef, the second largest reef system in the world and the largest in the Western Hemisphere. In 1998 the reef in front of Puerto Morelos became a protected National Marine Park, preserving its rich biodiversity and making this area one of the best preserved of the Great Mesoamerican Reef. Buildings in Puerto Morelos are limited to three stories by local bylaws, to preserve its village character.
Puerto Morelos' reputation as a laid-back Caribbean destination is supported by its scattering of boutique hotels, condominiums, villas, plus various small restaurants and tourist shops.  Its appeal is especially strong to travelers who eschew all-inclusives and built up "touristy" attractions. For the most part, the town is a residential community with a mix of Mexicans, Canadians, Americans, and Europeans who live there full or part-time.
Just across the Highway 307, the main north-south route on the peninsula, is Colonia Zetina Gazca, commonly known as "La Colonia."   This inland community is mainly single level dwellings for local Mexicans and a few ex-pats, and contains amenities such as small food stores, pharmacies, and several casual restaurants serving simple fare. In general, tourists tend to gravitate to the beaches of Puerto Morelos. The locals tend to live in the less expensive La Colonia.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The nearest major airport is Cancún International Airport (CUN IATA). It is 20km away from Puerto Morelos and is Mexico's second busiest airport.

By car[edit]
Puerto Morelos is situated at the junction of Route 307 and a paved road to the town of Leona Vicario in the interior of the Yucatán Peninsula. This paved road is the eastern terminus of La Ruta de los Cenotes, a network of minor roads that allows access to many cenotes in the interior. At Puerto Morelos, the beginning of this road network is marked by an archway. The waterfront is about  2 km east from Highway 307 on Calle Jose Maria Morelos. Puerto Morelos is about 30 km south of Cancun, 30 km north of Playa del Carmen, and one hour north of Tulum.

By bus[edit]
Buses from Cancun and Playa del Carmen traverse Highway 307, the coastal highway and the main highway into town:

From Cancún International Airport take a private shuttle service to Puerto Morelos. Alternatively, you could take the ADO Aeropuerto bus to the Cancun bus station, and then take a second-class bus toward Playa del Carmen.
From downtown Cancun (el centro) take a second-class bus for Playa del Carmen. Buy your ticket at the station. Tell the ticket agent and driver you want to get off at Puerto Morelos. (First-class buses will generally not stop on demand). (Colectivos are a better travel choice).
From Playa del Carmen, take a second-class bus for Cancun from the Alterna bus station in Playa. Buy your ticket to Puerto Morelos at the station. Be aware that first-class buses will generally not stop to let you off. (Colectivos are a better travel choice).

Cancún and Playa del Carmen buses arrive and depart from the highway, about 2km from town. Each side of the highway has its own small station.
Frequent local buses travel between the highway (la colonia) and the beach (el puerto) for M$4 per person.  Or take a taxi into town M$22 - 25. If you decide to walk instead, ensure adequate insect repellent, as the road leads through a mosquito-infested mangrove swamp - and watch out for inquisitive crocodiles about half way, particularly on the northern side.

By colectivo[edit]
This is the best (most reliable) public transit method to Puerto Morelos. Vans called colectivos (or combis) follow routes between towns on the Riviera Maya. The van labeled "Cancun-Playa" is the one that will stop along the highway in Puerto Morelos (they drop off and pick up on highway 307, other local colectivos or taxis go into the town itself). It is about 2 km from highway 307 to the center of Puerto Morelos. Colectivos from Cancun to Puerto Morelos cost M$30. Southbound, the colectivos stop in front of the Chedrau supermarket. Northbound, they stop near the overpass bridge (ask locals if you can't find the right spot).

By private transfers[edit]
Private transfers by taxi from Cancún International Airport (CUN) to Puerto Morelos are the most comfortable and reliable way to get to town. Transfers start at M$1000 (US$55) each way for 2 people or $90 round trip. There many vendors taxi outside International Terminal 3 but if you can pre-arrange transport through a car service or your local hotel, it may be less expensive.

Get around[edit]

There are many local taxis around, they gather at a taxi stand on the west side of the main square in Puerto Morelos. Bicycling is an excellent way to get around town, and bikes can be rented at a number of places in town. There is also a local car rental agency in  the main town on the highway.  Always make sure you find out the price of a taxi ride before you get in to avoid disagreements.  At the car rental place you can bargain for a cheaper rate.

Do[edit]
Lanchas at Puerto Morelos
Scuba diving. Puerto Morelos offers a large variety of marine life on one of the most beautiful reefs in the world. The dives inside the reef can be from shallow up to dives where you can see large coral formations at greater depths. For more advanced divers there a few wrecks and the cenotes to explore. Also has easy access to various dive sites ranging from very easy to very challenging ones. For those who are looking for some relaxed diving there are some beautiful shallow reef formations in water of 40 feet/12 meters depth where you can dive among turtles, schools of colorful fish, eagle rays, and many species of crabs and lobsters only to name a few. For wreck lovers, there are two accessible wrecks near Puerto Moleros. The nearest is the C-56, a navy boat that has beautiful coral and which is home to very large pelagics at 60-90 feet/18-27 meters). For more experienced divers there's the Tulum which is at a depth of about 120 feet/36 meters. The Mesoamerican Barrier Reef lies about 500 meters offshore. It is closer to the shore near Puerto Morelos than it is at most other points along the coast of Quintana Roo. Several dive shops and nearby resorts offer diving on the reef. See Diving in Mexico.
Swimming. Near the shore, water temperatures average about 27°C (80°F) year round. Freshwater swimming is available inland, at several cenotes. At cenotes that are not exposed to sunlight, temperatures are colder, and a partial wetsuit may be necessary for anything more than a brief dip. For stronger swimmers, take an official park snorkeling tour out to the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef further out from the beach.
Reef diving. The Mesoamerican Barrier Reef lies about 500 meters offshore. It is closer to the shore near Puerto Morelos than at most other points along the coast of Quintana Roo. Several dive shops and nearby resorts offer diving on the reef.
Snorkeling. You can snorkel close to the beach (yellow floaters mark the end of the zone), and there is a small underwater cenote called Ojo de Agua just off the beach that's popular and has some fish. The best snorkeling is at the park reef, which is only accessible using guided trips by boat (about M$600/US$30 per person; many operators). Snorkeling out to the reef from shore on your own is not permitted. If you do swim out alone to the reef from the beach, you risk being picked out of the water by park wardens who may just tell you off and take you back to the shore, but are within their rights to fine you. These rules are not clearly signposted anywhere. Unless you are just snorkeling along the beach or going out to the Ojo de Agua, it is best to take an official park tour. To protect the reef against intentional and unintentional damage, you are only allowed onto the reef in the company of an accredited guide, with a park wristband, and wearing a non-inflatable life jacket (PFD). All snorkeling equipment can be provided by your guide but having your own mask and snorkel is recommended for best fit. A light wetsuit is welcome certain times of year. A snorkeling tour starts from the Puerto Morelos public dock with a short trip out to the reef in a panga motor boat. There are typically two guides on the boat who alternate as boat driver and in-the-water guide. The water guide will indicate points of interest on the reef and have a life buoy to hang onto should anyone get tired while in the water. There are usually two 45-minute snorkeling sessions in different areas of the reef. Typically, you will see grouper, barracuda, dorado, wahoo, rays, sea turtles and all the vegetation of a healthy reef. While there is a breakwater about a mile off the beach that protects the reef, there are currents to navigate. Being a good swimmer will add to the enjoyment of this tour. Most will find this snorkeling tour to be a rewarding experience. After the tour, the guide will take you back to the public dock or drop you off on the Puerto Morelos Public Beach near your lodging.
Cenotes. Cenotes are sinkholes in the native limestone that are filled with crystal-clear groundwater; some are large and deep, while others are small passages through a cave. Inland from Puerto Morelos, many cenotes are accessible along the road from Puerto Morelos to Central Vallarta, some with really good swimming in clear blue water; To take local transport to the cenotes take colectivo bus "Jacinto Kanek" from Puerto Morelos to the other side of the highway, get off at the Pemex station (Colonia Zetina Gasca), once there go to the main zocalo two blocks west of 7-Eleven and take the bus heading to Leona Vicario, they leave Morelos at 07:00, 08:00, 09:00 and return from Leona at 12:00, 13:00, 16:00,and 17:00 you can get off at Boca del Puma, just past Central Vallarta at Km 16, which has nice trails through the forest and a cool snorkel through a cave passage, the owner Jesus will rent you a bicycle if you want to explore the nearby cenotes on your own. Snorkel in a cenote a few meters out in front of the Ojo de Agua hotel or the Puerto Morelos Reef, about 500-1000 meters from shore. You can rent equipment at the dive shops around town and swim there yourself, or book a boat trip outside the Casita del Mar (north end of town, on the beach) for M$440. Downtown operations offer trips for M$500.
Sunbathing on the soft white sandy beaches is a perfect way to spend a relaxing vacation. Vendors will rent you a beach lounge chair with or without a shady umbrella. Palapas along the beach are served by waiters who will serve you cold drinks and snacks.
Birdwatching is popular among naturalists. Walk on the boardwalk through the mangroves behind Desire Riviera Maya Pearl Resort (north end of town), and look at birds and tropical plants. A variety of aquatic shorebirds can be spotted on the beaches and sand dunes. Jungle areas along the Ruta de los Cenotes have a large number of tropical avians.
Visit apiaries - Beekeeping is an ancient tradition in Maya communities, including the village of Leona Victoria (which is part of the greater Puerto Morelos municipality). The Maya kept bees in hollow logs, which are still the preferred hive host, particularly for stingless bees such as the Melipona beecheii. Honey from Mayan bees has a unique citric flavor. It is used in traditional Mayan cooking and is the sugar source for traditional fermented beverages similar to meads made in England. The Mayan honey bees are critically endangered, mostly due to modern insecticides and reduced habitat.
