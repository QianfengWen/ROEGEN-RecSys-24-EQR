Lakewood is a city next to Cleveland, in Cuyahoga County, Ohio.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
One of Cleveland's original "streetcar suburbs," Lakewood was built and settled primarily in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Most of its existing housing stock was built in this timeframe, and is surprisingly well maintained.  Lakewood has managed to retain many of the best features of a city, small town, and suburb, and scenes reminiscent of all three can easily be found within a few blocks of downtown Lakewood (Detroit Ave. between Cook and Bunts) and in the Gold Coast neighborhood.

By car[edit]
From the airport, follow Ohio 237 north; from most parts of Cleveland proper, take I-90 or Ohio 2 west and follow the signs.

By bus[edit]
RTA bus #26 serves both Lakewood and Cleveland along Detroit Avenue, and the Red Line features two stops just inside the Lakewood/Cleveland border, West 117 and Triskett Road, from which you can easily walk to the southeastern neighborhoods of Lakewood.

Get around[edit]
The areas of Lakewood of most interest to a visitor, notably the downtown area, are very walkable and bike-friendly neighborhoods.  If coming from Cleveland, the #26 bus runs relatively frequently down Detroit Avenue and takes about 45 minutes between downtown Lakewood and downtown Cleveland.  Driving in and around Lakewood is fairly easy as well.  The speed limits are 20 mph (32 km/h) in school zones and 25 mph (40 km/h) on most other streets, and are vigorously enforced.  Parking is limited in and near the downtown area, though paid garages and metered parking are available almost everywhere.
