Marble statue of Napoléon Bonaparte in Ajaccio
Ajaccio (Corsican: Aiacciu) is the capital of the French Mediterranean island of Corsica, home to 71,000 people (2019). It is a sun-kissed tourist town with frequent visits by cruise ships. It has a boardwalk along its attractive coastline, with excellent restaurants and lots of Napoleon-related sites.


Understand[edit]
Although the coastline of Ajaccio and its natural harbour was almost certainly visited many times in antiquity, the development of a proper city did not happen until the late 1400s when the Genoese built a citadel that still stands to this day and serves as a military installation for the French army.
After most of Corsica was conquered by the French in the 1700s, Ajaccio remained a Genoese territory until the late 1760s.
Napoleon Bonaparte (Napoleone di Buonaparte) was born in Ajaccio in 1769 just after the city became the capital of Corsica.  Although from mostly Italian-Corsican heritage, Napoleon rose through the ranks of the French military to become the leader of France and then Emperor. For a time he also ruled most of Europe.
Ajaccio was one of the last cities to become French in Europe, but it was the first French city to be liberated in 1943 following the fall of the Third Republic in 1940.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
41.9238898.80251 Ajaccio Napoleon Bonaparte Airport (AJA  IATA). Air Corsica, an Air France subsidiary, is the main airline serving Corsica and AJA. Most of Air Corsica/Air France flights depart from Paris-Orly, Nice and Marseilles airports throughout the year. Many more French cities are served during the summer season (April–October). Flights can be surprisingly expensive, and often, taking the ferry makes more economic sense, especially when you figure in the cost of taking a car on the ferry versus renting a car once in Corsica. EasyJet and Volotea offer direct flights to the city from Paris, other French and European cities. In addition, companies such as Norwegian and Transavia operate flights from French and European cities during the summer season (April-October).   (updated Dec 2023)
