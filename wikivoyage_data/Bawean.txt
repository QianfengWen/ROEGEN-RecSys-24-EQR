Bawean is an island in East Java. Its natural tural attractions include the Lake Kastoba, hot springs Kebundaya and Taubat, waterfalls Lachchar and Patar Selamat, the caves in the central part of the island, sandy beaches and coral reefs on the coast. 


Understand[edit]
Bawean means "sunlight exists" in Sanskrit, which 14th-century shipwrecked sailors are said to have exclaimed upon seeing clear skies here after days of stormy seas.
Bawean lies 150 km (93 miles) north of Surabaya in the Java Sea, off the coast of Java.
Most of the island is hilly, except for the narrow coast and a plain in the southwestern part; it is therefore also called locally as "island of 99 hills". Bawean is dominated by an extinct volcano at its center that rises to 655 meters (2,149 feet) above sea level. 
In 2022, it had a population of 83,000 people in 2022, but a large share of the male population lives off the island temporarily, resulting in a female-dominated resident population, and the nickname, "Island of Women". 
The rainy season lasts from December to March.

Talk[edit]
The most population speaks Baweanese, a creole language of Madurese. Nonetheless, they understand Indonesian.
