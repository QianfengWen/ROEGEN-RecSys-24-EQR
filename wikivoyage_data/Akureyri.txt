Average max. and min. temperatures in °F
Precipitation+Snow totals in inches



The weather in Akureyri (and Northern Iceland in general) is often colder than in the capital, Reykjavík, but precipitation is lower; however, snow begins to fall earlier in Akureyri than in Reykjavík. As in the whole country the weather is unpredictable.
January is the coldest month. Snow is very common in December to February, 80-85% of the days in those months have some snow coverage. Sunshine hours in Akureyri are fewer than in its surroundings due to its location between two mountains to the east and west. These mountains also make winds blow frequently to the north and south.
July is the warmest month and one of the driest ones; actually temperature often remains rather cool even during summer, but one or two relatively hot days (> 24 °C) can occur, while rain is less frequent than in Reykjavik.

Get in[edit]
Akureyri Airport viewed from the Ring road
By car or bus[edit]
The city is linked to the rest of Iceland via the Ring Road, the highway that circles the island along the coastline. The Ring Road just west of Akureyri travels through a scenic valley. This valley can be slow-going in inclement weather and there are limited places to safely stop or pull over, so be sure to check weather reports.

 SBA. Buses between Reykjavík and Akureyri four days a week, leaving at 08:00 and arriving at 18:30. kr 18,000 one-way. (updated Feb 2021)
 Strætó. Buses from Húsavík, Reykjahlíð, Egilsstaðir and other places in the north and east several times a week. Daily buses from Reykjavík, Borgarnes, Blönduós and Sauðárkrókur. (updated Feb 2021)
By plane[edit]
65.659994-18.0727031 Akureyri Airport (AEY  IATA) (about 3.5 km (2.2 mi) from the city centre). Akureyri has an airport with flights from Reykjavík Airport on domestic carrier Icelandair several times a day.  Icelandair also has flights from three smaller villages: Grímsey (a small island to the north of Iceland, on the arctic circle), Þórshöfn (in the northeast on Langanes peninsula) and Vopnafjörður (the northernmost fjord in East Iceland). Seasonally, Akureyri has international flights from London (Gatwick), Zurich, and Amsterdam.   (updated Jul 2023)
Don't let the lack of a sidewalk at the airport's driveway intimidate you, there is a sidewalk next to the public road. Alternatively, take a taxi, and expect to pay about kr 1900 to the city centre. There are no buses serving the airport.

Get around[edit]
Waterfront
65°41′0″N 18°6′0″WMap of Akureyri
Being Iceland's northern capital doesn't mean Akureyri is a huge metropolis.  Although it can get a bit hilly leaving the waterline, walking distances are reasonable for a fit person.
Akureyri has a public bus system, called SVA[dead link], which is free for all. The buses are not very frequent, each line has a bus every hour or so. The buses stop running at 23:00 on weekdays and only run between 12:00 and 18:00 on weekends and holidays, but when they're free, why complain? For easier routing and route-planning consider getting the Strætó bs. app.[dead link]
BSÓ is the only taxi company in town, and they have a taxi rank in the centre.
For those who prefer to cycle, it's possible to rent a bicycle at the souvenir shop The Viking in Hafnarstræti (☏ +354 461 5551). The price is  kr 1000 for 6 hours, or kr 1800 for the day.

The tranquil municipal botanical garden, Lystigarðurinn, is worth visiting, as are the several small museums dotted around town.

Diving[edit]
Northern Iceland offers special diving experience due to submerged geological formations and cold water marine life. The North Atlantic water is chilly all year round, suitable for dry suit diving. The minimum age for scuba diving is 17 years according to Icelandic laws.
Scuba divers can join various guided tours, the most special one to a submerged hydrothermal chimney Strýtan in the middle of Eyjafjörður is reserved for more experienced divers. This geothermal formation (white smoker) was created over 10.000 years ago and it is still active. The tallest of several chimneys rises from the sea bottom at the depth of 65 m to 15 m below sea level, and is continuously spewing hot water. Diving is permitted at this protected site with a guide. The local dive center owner is at the same time a discoverer of Strýtan and has in-depth knowledge of the local marine environment.
Arnarnesstrýtur dive site, a cluster of small hydrothermal chimneys at the sea bottom between 23 m and 15 m, is a wonderful alternative for less experienced divers. This dive location, accessible on a zodiac, is also full of rich marine life, with wolffish, cod, pollock or lumpfish, as well as diverse nudibranchs.

Drink[edit]
A nice bar is across the street from the main movie theatre. It seems that people in the city enjoy an 'early' movie theater around 20:00 or so, and, as customary in Iceland, go clubbing/barhopping after midnight. Keep in mind that the clubs close at 01:00, at least during the weekdays. A strange wheel-of-fortune with shots, beer, and nothing, is there, for kr 1500.

65.680285-18.0939371 Einstök Brewer’s Lounge, Kaupvangsstræti 23 (located in the back room of the Ölstofa Akuryrar bar as well as the back of the burger/grill joint next door). As there is no tasting room at the brewery, this is the second best bet. Flights available for kr 2500.. 
Sleep[edit]
There are many guesthouses more inland immediately away from the city center. They double as residences for college students, but they are the cheapest lodging you'll find, at around kr 8000 double and kr 5000 single.
In addition to hostels and hotels, there are a variety of apartments to rent. These are usually set up like a conventional 1-bedroom apartment (with amenities like a refrigerator, kitchen, and dining area). You might prefer renting an apartment if you're staying in the area for multiple days and want to buy groceries and prepare your own meals.

Pseudocraters in Mývatn with the volcano Vindbelgjarfjall in the background
Akureyri is a good base to explore some of the more remote areas of Iceland, such as Mývatn. Several buses run mostly hourly from the city centre to other important places like the airport and neighboring settlements and bus tours are available which take you to see the enormous crater of Víti, and Goðafoss (waterfall of the gods).
Akureyri is fairly close to Húsavík, which has several whale watching tour operators, and Dalvík, from where you'll be able to catch a ferry to the island of Grímsey, Iceland's northernmost inhabitated island, situated right on the Arctic Circle.

Akureyri to Myvatn (1 hr 30 min) kr 2400 / €16
