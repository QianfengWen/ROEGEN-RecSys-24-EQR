Freshwater East is a village on the coast of Pembrokeshire in South Wales with an attractive sandy bay. It grew up as a beach resort in the 20th century, and later its surroundings became open access land with dunes, woodland and wetlands. The name arose because sailing ships would put in for water supplies, or at least claim they did so – it was good cover for smuggling.
