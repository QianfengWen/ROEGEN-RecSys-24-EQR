Map of Skagen
A very popular way of transport in the area is by bicycle on a distributed net of bicycle paths. Between Easter and wk43, there is also a "sand train" at Grenen, called Sandormen, carrying tourists between the parking lot and the northernmost point of Denmark. It is a sort of a special vehicle driving through the sand, so it can be an experience taking it. You can only pay cash and the first run starts at 10:00. It also makes the hike between Skagen and Grenen shorter, if you decide to do this by foot.
