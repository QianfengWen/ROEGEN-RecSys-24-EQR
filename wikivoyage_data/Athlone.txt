Athlone is a town in County Westmeath, almost dead-centre of Ireland and bisected by the River Shannon. The promenade on the River Shannon is popular among anglers, birdwatchers and swimmers. The lakeshore is accessed from Coosan Point and Hodson Bay. The town is also home to Lough Ree Yacht Club. 
Its location on the River Shannon has made it strategically important for over 1000 years, with the castle its main heritage. It's grown on both river banks into a large industrial town and transport hub, with a population in 2022 of 23,000. 


Understand[edit]
Athlone Castle
Inland travel in ancient Ireland was impeded by bogs, but you could travel north-south along the Shannon, and east-west along the eskers, the line of gravel ridges deposited by glaciers. The main east-west route was some 20 km further south, crossing the Shannon at Clonmacnoise, which grew into a great monastic centre. Probably because that area was flood-prone, the Normans when they arrived in the 12th century preferred to cross the Shannon here at Luan's ford (Baile Átha Luain, hence "Athlone"). They built a bridge, and a fortified town and castle on the west bank. Later rulers continued to see the need for a garrison, as any coup or revolt here would strike at the very heart of Ireland. 
The river formed the boundary between the Gaelic kingdoms of Connacht to the west and of Meath to the east. But half the fun of being Norman was in subduing the Gaels, and carving up their territory into shires or counties which could be re-awarded to loyal henchmen. Meath was subsumed into the kingdom of Leinster and eventually its western part was hived off as County Westmeath. The west bank became County Roscommon, but the boundary was re-drawn so that all of Athlone fell within Westmeath. 
The west bank retains its higgledy-piggledy medieval street pattern but most buildings of that era were smashed in the two sieges of 1690/91, when after the Battle of the Boyne the Jacobites made a stand against the oncoming Williamites. The town was re-built in the 18th and 19th century, the railway arrived, and Athlone's central location made it an attractive base for state agencies, industry (healthcare and IT nowadays being leading employers) and the army. The castle was rebuilt, since you never just knew where Napoleon might attack next, and now contains the TIC[dead link], open Tu-Sa 9AM-5PM.

53.4233-7.942921 Athlone Castle, Castle St N37 A6D7, ☏ +353 90 644 2130, info@athlonecastle.ie. W-Sa (plus Tu Jul-Aug) 10AM-5:30PM, Su 11AM-5:30PM. This was built for England's King John in 1210, replacing a wooden fort, and extended circa 1276. It was probably built with a moat. Its heaviest engagements were the two 17th-century sieges of Athlone. In 1690 Athlone city and castle were held by the Jacobites, who destroyed the Shannon bridge to thwart the advance of the Williamites. Fresh from victory at the Battle of the Boyne, the Williamites bombarded the city for a week but retreated when Jacobite reinforcements approached. They attacked again in 1691, attempting to storm the river crossing, and bombarding the Jacobites on the west bank for ten days. Then, with the river running unusually low, the Williamites found another fording point downstream, got across and captured the castle. Two weeks later, advancing west, they met the main Jacobite army at Aughrim, crushed them, and thereby annihilated Jacobite resistance in Ireland. The smashed-up castle was rebuilt during the Napoleonic wars but never put to the test, so much of what you see now is from the early 19th century. The tourist information centre is also here. Adult €9, conc €6.50, child €4.50. (updated Jun 2021)
53.42378-7.943562 Church of St Peter & Paul, Barrack St. This twin towered Roman Catholic church was built in the 1930s to replace an older, smaller church on the site.

Other churches worth a look are the Methodist church on Northgate, the Church of Ireland Athlone St Mary on Dublin Gate St, St Anthony's in the Franciscan Friary just south, St Mary's further east, and Corpus Christi west side in Connaught Gardens.

John McCormack (1884-1945) of Athlone was a renowned tenor, singing opera, lieder and light pieces - in 1914 he was the first to record It's a Long Way to Tipperary. Among numerous accolades, he was made Count of the Papal Court in 1928 by Pope Pius XI. He's commemorated by a bust outside the Luan Gallery (which Google street view has pixillated to ensure his privacy) and since 2014 by a full-sized statue outside Civic Hall, his feet wound in coils of music that would ensnare a lesser man. He's buried in Deans Grange, Dublin.
Athlone Canal west side of town has been culverted and turned into a park. The shallows and rapids on the Shannon made it possible to ford but were a block to navigation. This short canal was cut in 1757 as a work-around; it served until the 1840s when the main Shannon was made navigable by a weir and locks.
53.466-7.9293 Coosan Point is the headland where Lough Ree narrows into the Shannon flowing down through Athlone. With Killinure Point just north, it encloses three "inner lakes" — these sheltered waters are the main local base for water activities.
