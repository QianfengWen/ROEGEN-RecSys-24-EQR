Caldas Novas is a city in the Brazilian state of Goias. It is popular for its hot springs that attract travellers all year round.


Understand[edit]
The history of settlement in the area dates back to the eighteenth century. Bartolomeu Bueno da Silva Filho, a.k.a. the bandeirante Anhanguera, discovered thermal springs in the region in 1722. Later, Martin Coelho de Siqueira, another bandeirante, created a movement for the creation of a village in the region. In 1777, Coelho Siqueira found new springs by the River Pirapetinga and the Lavras brook,  naming them Caldas de Pirapetinga and Caldas Novas, respectively.
The Fazenda das Caldas, owned by Martin Coelho de Siqueira, where the main house is preserved until today, was passed to his son, Antonio Coelho de Siqueira, after his father's death. In 1818, the farm was visited by French researcher Auguste de Saint-Hillaire.
After the death of Antonio Coelho de Siqueira, the farm was sold to José Domingos Ribeiro. He donated part of the farm for the construction of the Church of Our Lady of Exile. In 1853, the church is elevated to Parish of Caldas Novas, with the vicar Olinta José da Silva. In 1880, Caldas Novas split from Santa Cruz and was annexed to the municipality of Vila Bela de Morrinhos, current Morrinhos. In 1893, it was elevated to a district. On July 5, 1911 the municipality of Caldas Novas was created, and its headquarters was elevated to a village on October 21, 1911, a date that marks the anniversary of the city. On June 21, 1923, Caldas Novas was elevated to the category of City.
New Caldas is the world's largest hydrothermal complex in operation. It receives more tourists than any other city in the Central West, and had the most hotels in the Central West.
