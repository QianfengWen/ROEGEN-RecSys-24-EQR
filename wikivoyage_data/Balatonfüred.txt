Balatonfüred[dead link] is a town and district on the shore of Lake Balaton, Hungary.


Understand[edit]
Balatonfüred is the third largest town on Lake Balaton, after the brash party town of Siófok on the Southern Shore and Keszthely on the Western Shore. Luckily, Balatonfüred's Baroque elegance and traditional old town keep it from becoming too commercialised. There is still plenty to do in one of Hungary's oldest tourist spots.
This area is possibly one of the nicest resorts along the lake shore. Its beautiful promenades, tree-lined avenues and stunning views of the Tihany Peninsula make this town the finest on the Balaton shore. To catch Baltonfüred at its best, visit during the summer months of May - August.

Lake Balaton with Balatonfüred on the North Shore
The town has 5 international partnerships (twin towns): Germering (Germany), Kouvola (Finland) Opatija (Croatia), Kovászna (Romania), and Arpino (Italy).

Talk[edit]
The national language of Hungary is Hungarian. Many of the restaurant menus are also in English and as are many of the signs, yet finding people in the area that can speak English well is a difficulty.
German is the second language to many at the lake. English is simply not on the cards for many, particularly those of the older generation, so learn your one-word phrases well. These will come in handy, particularly at the train station where simple words like "Egy retur" (Return ticket) might save you on your holiday.

Stay safe[edit]
Balatonfüred is a very safe place.
Dogs roam the town at all hours and, as it seems, everyone in Balatonfüred owns a dog which they keep in their gated houses. Indeed, walking past these houses is sure to send you up the wall as the silence is interrupted by the sudden barking! Nonetheless, while the vast majority of these dogs are on leashes and gated up, beware of what you or your children pet.

Go next[edit]
A panorama of the city, the lake, and the hills beyond the far shore
Győr — the Town of Waters
Keszthely — a large town on the west coast of the lake close to the famous Héviz Spa, is well worth a visit. With its Festetics Palace built in 1775, it is a truly amazing town.
Székesfehérvár — former Hungarian Royal City
The party town of Siófok, again only a short ferry away, is also a good way to se the southern shore of Lake Balaton, yet while it has been somewhat spoiled by highrise and tourists, it nonetheless has everything the tourist would need with a great nightlife to boot.
Zirc — Abbey Library, Arboretum
Veszprém - visit the medieval Castle on the Hill and  the nicest Hungarian viaduct.
