Casselberry is a city in Seminole County, Greater Orlando, Florida.


Understand[edit]
Casselberry is one of many suburbs on the northeastern side of Orlando. It is between two important suburbs of the city: Sanford to the north, which is the location of the Sanford/Orlando Airport and a lakefront, and Winter Park to the south, the location of Rollins College.
Lakewood is a suburban community near Casselberry. Like Casselberry, it is primarily residential and those traveling to Longwood will want to stay in one of the larger local suburbs. However Casselberry's few restaurants and parks are within a few miles of Longwood and there is little to separate these two suburbs.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
US-17/92 is the main route through the Longwood/Casselberry area. It connects the towns to the more central parts of the Orlando metro area to the immediate south. I-4 goes just west of the town.
