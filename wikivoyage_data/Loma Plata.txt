Loma Plata is one of the three Mennonite colonies of the Chaco in Western Paraguay. Located 440 km (273 mi) northwest from Asunción it is surrounded by the desert-like environment characteristic to the central Chaco that creates a frontier-like cityscape in the town. Visitors to Loma Plata find a thriving industrial town with a rich historic heritage, some pristine nature reserves within easy reach from town, and good lodging and eating facilities. All this in an affluent Mennonite community just off the desolate Transchaco highway.


Understand[edit]
The Transchaco highway approaching Loma Plata
Founded by German Mennonites in the 1920s, Loma Plata is the second largest of the Mennonite colonies of the Chaco after Filadelfia with a population of about 9,000 inhabitants. Like the rest of the Mennonite colonies the town is greatly influenced by the work of a cooperative, in this case the  Chortitzer Cooperative, one of the largest in the Chaco which is, in turn, responsible for running most of the city services like the hospital, the main supermarket, the savings bank, the school, and many others, which are paid for by the profits from the cooperative.
A large fraction of its population descends from German Mennonites who immigrated from Canada in the 1927.
Most businesses are closed during lunchtime from 12:00 to 14:00, as well as on Saturday afternoons and Sundays.

The other two Mennonite colonies are close and worth visiting:

Filadelfia is 24 km (15 mi) to the east. The largest and most cosmopolitan of the Mennonite colonies is a charming city.
Neuland - 53 km (33 mi) to the south. It's the smallest of the Mennonite colonies and a charming town close to historic sites full of relics of the Chaco War.
Mariscal Estigarribia - 101 km (63 mi) to the northwest. The site of a large military airbase and the last stop before continuing to more remote areas of the central and northern Chaco.
If you want to go to Bolivia you will have to catch the Asunción-Bolivia bus at Mariscal Estigarribia. Take the bus to Filadelfia, and then to Mariscal Estigarribia. Ask the driver to drop you off at the immigration office. You will have to wait there for the bus from Asunción to Bolivia to come. Buses normally depart from Asunción daily at 20:00 and reach Mariscal Estigarribia around 03:00. You will have to pay for the entire journey from Asuncion and the cost is US$65 to Santa Cruz de la Sierra. When the bus arrives the immigration officer will check your passport and issue your exit stamp. Don't board the bus without doing this as there is no Paraguayan immigration at the border. Once you have boarded the bus you will travel for 6-7 hours before you arrive at Bolivian immigration.
