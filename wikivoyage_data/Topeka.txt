Understand[edit]
Kansas State Capitol
Topeka, located in Shawnee County, serves as the capital of Kansas. It lies on rich sandy loam river bottomland where Native Americans lived for many years using the excellent fords on the Kansas (Kaw) River. Among the first permanent settlers were three French-Canadian (Pappan) brothers. They married three Kanza (Kansas) Native American sisters and established a ferry over the river in 1842. A grandson from one of the marriages was Charles Curtis, the only Vice-President of the United States to be of Native American descent. (Charles Curtis served with President Herbert C. Hoover from 1929 to 1933.) In the 1800s, Topeka served as a gateway west for pioneers traveling on the Oregon Trail or by railroad.
Topeka is home to the highly acclaimed Kansas Museum of History where you'll step back in time and learn all about the land that is Kansas. Relive the history of Kansas through exhibits, videos, and programs.

Popular streets running through the city are Wanamaker Rd., Topeka Blvd., Gage Blvd., 6th St., 21st St., and 29th St. Be aware that the grid pattern slants around downtown due to the layout of the original city being different than the rest of the suburbs.

Westboro Baptist Church

Topeka has the unfortunate distinction of being the home of Westboro Baptist Church, headed by the late Fred Phelps and his family. This family is notorious for protests against the LGBTQ community, soldiers, any church or religion besides their own, and the United States as a country. When visiting or living in Topeka, it is a common sight to see a group of Westboro Baptist Churchgoers picketing a local church or community gathering, carrying colorful signs with offensive slogans and sometimes shouting or singing. Know that most local Topekans despise the Phelps and see Westboro Baptist as giving Topeka a bad name as a bigoted, small-minded city. On numerous occasions, committees have been formed attempting, unsuccessfully, to bar the Phelps from the city. The Patriot Guard Riders, a band of motorcyclists, was formed in response to picketing at soldier's funerals. They attempt to shield mourning families from protesters. The church's compound is on the corner of West 12th and South-West Cambridge Avenue (3701 Southwest 12th Street). Right across the street are houses painted in the colors of the Pride and Transgender Flags (known as the Equality Houses) to show solidarity with the LGBTQ community, which have turned into tourist attractions in their own right.

Stay Safe[edit]
As far as crime goes, Topeka is generally a safe city, but some areas around downtown (not including the downtown core) and on the eastern side of the city are best avoided at night. As long as you follow common sense, you will be safe in Topeka. Despite its bad reputation in Kansas, most of the crime in Topeka is gang-related, so a traveler is highly unlikely to come across any sort of serious danger. 
Being in Kansas, it is important to be well aware of the weather in Topeka. During the spring and summer months, tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in general are possible, while the winter can bring blizzard conditions. All weather warnings will be broadcast by local radio stations, and most people will get an emergency alert on their smartphone. Furthermore, during a tornado warning, tornado sirens will be sounded throughout the city, which are easy to hear from basically anywhere. When in doubt, ask the locals, but a good rule of thumb during tornadoes is to get on the lowest floor of the building and as far away from windows as you can.
