The old Huerfano County Courthouse on Main Street in Walsenburg
Walsenburg is the county seat of Huerfano County, Colorado, USA. Once called "La Plaza de los Leones," Walsenburg sits at an altitude of 6,171 feet (1,881 m) above sea level on the geological border between Colorado's  Eastern Plains to the east and the Sangre de Cristo Mountains to the west. A major freight rail line goes right through downtown, with the trains blowing their horns and briefly halting traffic at five at-grade crossings all hours of the day and night.


Understand[edit]
Although it's an incorporated city with just over 3,000 residents (2019), Walsenburg has a rural, small-town atmosphere. It's surrounded by cattle ranches and housing subdivisions with large lots, in homes often occupied by the many retirees that live in the county. Walsenburg is often called a "crossroads town," because anyone traveling from Interstate 25 to the San Luis Valley or beyond turns west here, traveling on U.S. Highway 160 through downtown.
The Spanish Peaks, two adjacent, prominent mountains, lie just southwest of Walsenburg and are an important part of its identity. Huerfano County is home to numerous geological dikes, including one that marks much of Walsenburg's northern border, called "The Hogback."
Once an important coal-mining center, Walsenburg's economy now relies on real estate, retail, restaurants, tourism, government, and health care. Some residents commute to Pueblo for work.

Go next[edit]
16 miles west of Walsenburg is the sleepy hamlet of La Veta. An artsy town, you can visit the galleries along Main Street.
Further up the canyon from La Veta lies Cuchara, an unincorporated town in a forested valley surrounded by the San Isabel National Forest and the Culebra Range, a sub-range of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Huerfano County's first county park, Cuchara Mountain Park, is here. A former ski resort, the alpine park now offers hiking and other activities. Cuchara has a one-block long 'downtown' section with some shops and restaurants. There are several trailheads along Highway 12 in Cuchara as well.
Colorado State Highway 12 connects with U.S. Highway 160 north of La Veta and then goes south and then west to Trinidad. It passes through La Veta and Cuchara and then crosses Cucharas Pass (10,000 feet) before entering Las Animas County, eventually reaching its terminus in Trinidad.
