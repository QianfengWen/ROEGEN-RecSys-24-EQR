History[edit]
Beaumaris and its castle was built by the Norman kings of England. King Edward I began construction on this castle in 1295. French builders called the castle beaux marais meaning "beautiful marshes", since the castle was built on a marsh foundation. This is one of the largest fortresses in Wales and the last created by Edward I. However, construction was never completed and only saw a little combat during the 17th century Civil War. Had it been finished it was fixed to be one of the grandest ever built.
