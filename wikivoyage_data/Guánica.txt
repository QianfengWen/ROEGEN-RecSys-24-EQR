Get around[edit]
You pretty much need your own wheels to explore the area around Guánica.

See[edit]
17.968693-66.914491 Guánica Pueblo (downtown Guánica). See the historic Roman Catholic church, Spanish-style recreational plaza, and the municipal buildings surrounded by streets and shops. You can drive around the pueblo or park your car and walk around the square and into the plaza. The Spanish law, which regulated life in Puerto Rico in the early 19th century, stated the plaza's purpose was for celebrations and festivities.  (updated Apr 2022)
Do[edit]
Manglillo Beach
The main reason to visit Guanica is the beaches.  Take Route 333 south from the town to reach them.  Caña Gorda Beach is the only one with facilities, but it's only open Tuesday-Sunday.
From San Jacinto, just past Copamarina, you can also hop on a ferry excursion to Gilligan's Island (aka Cayo Caña Gorda), an undeveloped piece of paradise with white sandy beaches, snorkeling and mangroves.
