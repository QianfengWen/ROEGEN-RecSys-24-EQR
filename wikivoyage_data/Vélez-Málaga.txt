Vélez-Málaga is a town in the province of Málaga, Spain. It is the capital of the Axarquía comarca and an important market town and supply centre for the region. Perched on a hill 4 km inland from Torre del Mar — a seaside resort on the Costa del Sol — its Moorish old town is a low-profile touristic destination.


Understand[edit]
Locally it is referred to as Vélez. The municipality of Vélez-Málaga includes the proper town of Vélez, the villages of Triana, Trapiche, Almayate Alto, Cajiz, Chilches and the coastal towns of Torre del Mar, Caleta de Vélez, Lagos, Almayate Bajo and Benajarafe.
Unlike other towns in the Costa del Sol, the town's economy is less reliant on tourism and more dependent on agriculture and fishing. Vélez-Málaga is the country's largest grower of avocados and one of the largest producers of mangos, chirimoyas and other tropical fruits. Its proximity to the city of Málaga is slowly transforming Vélez into a dormitory town.

Eat[edit]
Given that Vélez-Málaga is not as touristy as other towns in the Costa del Sol, prices are generally lower and restaurants are not as dedicated to foreign tourists. Nonetheless, communication should not be a problem, as most waiters can understand some English and menus are normally offered in several languages. Spaniards usually have lunch at around 15:00 and dinner at 22:00, so most restaurants will start serving meals no earlier than 13:00 and 20:00 in the evening.

Go next[edit]
Vélez-Málaga can be a hub for day-trips to small villages in the Axarquía region. These journeys can be within the day but in most cases public transport is not reliable, so renting a car or an organized tour is highly advisable. Outside of the coastline, roads are very sinuous and narrow, but are always in good condition and tend not to be dangerous.

Comares is a small village of whitewashed houses with Moorish ruins and a castle. It is located on top of a mountain and has views of the Vélez valley and the Mediterranean Sea.
Frigiliana is a very touristy village 30 km away from Vélez. It has narrow whitewashed streets and has been recognised multiple times as the most beautiful village of Andalusia.
