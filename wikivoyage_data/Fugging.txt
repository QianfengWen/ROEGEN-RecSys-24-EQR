Fugging, until 1 January 2021 Fucking, pronounced roughly "fooking" (rhymes with "booking"), is a village in Austria. It was home to Austria's most stolen sign and was known for its name. This village of only around 100 inhabitants can be visited quite easily from Salzburg. The village was officially renamed on 1 January 2021.

It was perhaps the most stolen sign in Austria, before 2021

Get in[edit]
Fugging is 32 km (20 mi) north of Salzburg and 12 km (7.5 mi) south of the German town of Burghausen. The nearest border crossing to Germany is 8 km west of Fugging at the also delightfully named town of Tittmoning. If using public transport, plan your journey carefully (using online journey planners: for buses and for trains) as connections are infrequent. Buses do not run on weekends. Taxis in Salzburg can make the trip.

By train[edit]

The nearest railway station is at Ostermiething (4 km by road). The nearest German stations are Burghausen (Oberbayern) (15 km by road) and Tittmoning-Wiesmühl (16 km by road). Simbach, in Germany, and nearby Braunau am Inn (notorious as the birthplace of Adolf Hitler), in Austria, (both 33 km by road) may also be useful.
From Vienna, take a train to Salzburg. Normally, there are "EXP" or "Westbahn" trains running this route. It's best to leave as early as possible as going from Vienna to Fugging is a full day of travel; one can take a train from Wien Westbahnhof as reasonably early as 5:40, arriving around 8:10 in Salzburg. However note, from Salzburg train station, you need to walk approximately 5 minutes to "Bahnsteige 11-12"; train platforms 11-12.
From Salzburg, local train S11 heads to Ostermiething. You may need to take local train S1 to Bürmoos and then another train to Ostermiething. Salzburg to Ostermiething takes 45-60 min and costs €6.80. Once in Ostermiething, you can walk along one of two pathways. The more rugged path past fields is more scenic and requires some uphill walking to get to, while the main roadway is busier but primarily flat, which may be better for cyclists.
Alternatively from Salzburg, a taxi company, Taxi Kirchhammer, can be called on +43 664 4219253.
From Munich, head to Tittmoning-Wiesmühl, Burghausen (Oberbayern), or Simbach. The journey to each is around 2 hours and costs around €20. Discounts can be had with the Bayern Ticket. 
From Burghausen (Oberbayern), either take a taxi or walk across the river into the Austrian village of Ach and find the bus station Ach b.Burghausen Ortsmitte (see By bus below).
From Tittmoning-Wiesmühl station, take a bus for 5 km to Tittmoning town. Tittmoning to Fugging is a further 11 km by road. To go from Tittmoning to Fugging may take up to two hours by foot, consider using other ways. A Tittmoning taxi company, Maier Gerlinde, can be called on +49 8683 1248.
Deutsche Bahn, the German train operator, can arrange taxis from its smaller stations[dead link] such as Tittmoning-Wiesmühl.
If going from Germany via Simbach/Braunau am Inn, do not buy a direct ticket to Branau am Inn. The international fare is a lot more expensive than the domestic local fare. From Simbach, either walk or take a taxi for 2 km to the Branau am Inn bus station in Kolpingplatz. Then take bus 885 (see below).

By bus[edit]
On weekdays, buses run to the village of Döstling, which is only 2 km from Fugging. Use an on-line route planner.
The best connections are from outside the railway station in Oberndorf (home of the carol Silent Night and on the same train line as Trimmelkam), bus 885 (30 min, 4 or 5 journeys each way on weekdays).
Possibly also useful are the buses from outside the railway station at Trimmelkam, bus 883 (to Döstling) and 885 (from Döstling) (10 min, 3 each way on weekdays); and from the bus station at Kolpingplatz in Braunau am Inn (1 hr, only one trip on weekdays). The latter's stop in the village of Ach (stop Ach b.Burghausen Ortsmitte) puts it within 2 km of the German railway station of Burghausen (Oberbayern).
