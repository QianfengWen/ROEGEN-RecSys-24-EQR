High St
From the High Street it's a short walk to an ancient mount that was the site of a castle. You would never know that there was a castle there, but it looks rather unnatural.
Although the castle no longer remains, several other historical buildings and structures still exist in the town, such as the parish churches of St. Nicholas and St. John the Baptist, the 15th-century Guildhall (which has been restored), the medieval market cross (much of the decoration of whose shaft has been mutilated but which has three ranges of kneeling places and sculptures representing the Holy Trinity, the crucifixion of Jesus, and, it is believed, St Peter), the 16th-century White Swan, and several half-timbered residences along High Street, the main street of the town.
