Volcan Masaya
Masaya is a small city in Nicaragua, midway between Managua and Granada. The town sits perilously close to the Volcan Masaya, an active volcano with constant plumes of sulfuric smoke. The volcano is the main feature of a national park.


Get in[edit]
From the airport in Managua (MGA IATA) you can take a taxi for US$20-30. Also, many cities in Nicaragua have buses that take you directly to Masaya. There are also public minivans known as microbuses that will take you from Managua (UCA terminal) to Masaya for a bit less than US$1. There are also slower standard (read: old American Bluebird) buses going to and from Masaya at a slightly lower price.
Most buses arrive to the huge and disorderly "bus station" at the edge of Masaya's new market 11.974241-86.0858531 . Google Maps also show the existence of a separate terminal, a few blocks to the west, for buses running between Masaya and UCA (Universidad Centroamericana, in Managua).
