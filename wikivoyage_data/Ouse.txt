Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Ouse is the settlement where convicts James Goodwin and Thomas Connolly broke out of the South West Wilderness four weeks after their escape from Sarah Island. Ouse Post Office opened on 1 October 1835.
The town briefly made national headlines in August 2006 when the Ouse District Hospital, originally established as a Bush Nursing Centre and reconstituted in its present form in 1956, was downgraded to a community health centre.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
From Hobart, take the A10 Lyell Highway. The journey will take about 1 hour and a bit.

Get around[edit]
In the town centre, taking the car is not worth it. Since it's so small, you could go from one side of the town the other in about three minutes. However, if you want to go outside Ouse, bringing your car is highly recommended.
