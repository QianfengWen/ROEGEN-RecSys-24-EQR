By train[edit]
The closest railroad station is in West Palm Beach; this station serves two passenger lines: Amtrak and Tri-Rail. 
There has been much controversy of the Treasure Coast getting passenger train stations; if these plans go through, they will be serving the Florida East Coast Railway on rails that have not been touched by the rumbling wheels of passenger trains since the mid-1900s. The FEC and Amtrak have been negotiating this issue since 2012, and plans include new and improved stations from Stuart to Fort Pierce, Port St. Lucie may get served as well, Vero Beach, Melbourne, Cocoa Beach, and Daytona Beach.

Get around[edit]
On foot[edit]
Central Stuart is very compact and is easy to walk around. The Lyric Theatre and Memorial Park are easily within walking distance. 

By car[edit]
Stuart is easy to navigate, and not very spread out. Streets in the downtown area tend to be compact, so it's best to stay alert while driving. The notorious Confusion Corner in Downtown lives up to its name, a junction of 8 roads, a roundabout and many angular spurs, as well as a railroad track running along side.

By bus[edit]
Martin County, including Jensen and Stuart, has their own public transit system now, and its nickname among the residents is the "Marty". The Marty has one route partially served by the Treasure Coast Connector from the PSL Wal-Mart on US-1 to the Treasure Coast Connector Mall and further down south to local hospital and bank in Stuart. There are three routes:

Route 1 takes you from the PSL Wal-Mart to the local bank in Stuart.
Route 3 takes you through Stuart through a loop from Kiwanis Park to Witham Field, Martin High School and the intersection of US-1 and Kanner Hwy.
