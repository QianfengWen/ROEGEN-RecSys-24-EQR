Nida is a resort town in Lithuania Minor on the Curonian Spit, a remarkable 99 km peninsula of sandhills. Nida and its associated villages comprise Neringa County and in 2020 had a population of 3,530.


Understand[edit]
The present town is 5 km south of the original settlement, engulfed by sand dunes in the 1730s. Replanting of woodland from the 19th century halted the dunes' advance.
This area has traditionally been German-speaking, part of Prussia from 1701. Its fishing village and haunting landscape of sand dunes drew artists in the 19th century, and in the 1930s it was the summer home of novelist Thomas Mann. That population was deported after the Second World War, and the Lithuanian communists turned it into a private holiday resort for party officials, a sort of Sandals Soviet Socialist Republic, so Nida was little developed and its old buildings preserved.

Coming from Klaipėda is the usual route; the city has trains and buses from elsewhere in Lithuania plus Riga.
How to use the ferry to get to Smiltynė on the Curonian Spit side, see Klaipėda.

By bus[edit]
There are regular bus connections between Smiltynė and Nida. In Smiltynė, the bus generally waits for the ferry passengers before it starts southwards. It carries bicycles and takes an hour for the full distance. It stops on request at intermediate villages such as Pervalka and Preila, but otherwise scoots by on the highway.
Costs are: €6 Smiltynė–Nida, €3 Smiltynė–Juodkrantė, €4 Juodkrantė–Nida
Times are (verify):

Smiltynė to Nida: 07:10 (weekdays only), 09:10, 10:10, 11:10, 12:10, 13:10, 14:10, 16:10, 17:10, 18:10, 19:10, 21:10, 22:10

By car[edit]
With your own vehicle, head to Klaipėda New ferry terminal (Naujoji perkėla) for the 10 minute crossing to Smiltynė, then follow Highway 167 down the Curonian Spit via Juodkrantė to Nida. 

From Kaliningrad Oblast (Russia)[edit]
You can drive to Nida with the correct documentation for yourself and vehicle. Drive northeast up the spit from Zelenogradsk via Lesnoy, Rybachii and Morskoe.
The 55.279920.96391 Pogranperekhod Kurshskaya / Neringa border post is open 24 hours. There is no public transport here; bicycles may cross but not pedestrians. See Lithuania#Get in for the entry rules coming northeast: Lithuania is part of the EU Schengen Zone, but in 2023 bars entry to Russian citizens. See Russia#Get in for the rules going southwest: there is a special e-visa for Kaliningrad Oblast, free and quick to obtain, for citizens of 51 countries including most of Europe. Those ineligible for the e-visa, such as US or British passport holders, must go through the usual bureaucracy of obtaining a standard Russian visa. Either way, you must sort out your documentation before reaching the border, there is no "visa on arrival".
And don't lark about on the beach or in the water beyond the border fences, the guards will assume you are making a recce for an illegal crossing or smuggling run, and invite you in for a less-than-friendly chat. Most border transgressions are by small craft gone astray, or by ice-fishermen convinced the catch will be better just a few metres the other side.

See[edit]
55.2936320.9784361 Nida Gliding School (in the area south of Five Hills). Again only a sign commemorates it. After the First World War, Germany was forbidden any powered aviation, so instead developed the design and piloting of gliders. A training area was set up between Rybachii and Morskoe south of the border. Lithuania sent pilots and engineers to train with the Germans and in 1933 opened its own area at Nida. Launching was much the same as with a kite: the glider perched atop a sand dune, and four beefy fellows ran pell-mell down the dune with a cable to drag it aloft. This did not violate the rule against "powered" aviation.  (updated Jul 2023)Glider flights didn't always succeed
