Forks is a city in the Olympic Peninsula of Washington in the Pacific Northwest of the United States of America. Well-known due to the Twilight saga hype, this little charming town of 3,300 people (2020) serves primarily as a transit point for visitors further exploring the beaches and mountains on the Olympic National Park, while the city has a number of attractions related to the movie that are worth seeing.
Due to its distance, attractions in the Quillayute area, including La Push, are included here.

By car[edit]
The local roads are designed more or less around a grid system, where most roads are numbered based on their distance from the city center. Addresses also conform to the numbering of the roads around them. Nearly all streets run with the compass directions. Forks Ave (US-Hwy 101) divides east from west while Division St divides north from south.

By bus[edit]
The town of Forks is compact and can be easily covered on foot. Clallam Transit Route 17[dead link] runs a loop around the town.
