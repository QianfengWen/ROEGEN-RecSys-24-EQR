Calatafimi Segesta is in Sicily. Calatafimi, with the Castle of Eufemio and its churches, is characterised by its lanes and small streets of Arab derivation. At about 10 km from this town there is the archaeological site of Segesta, with the Greek temple and the ancient theatre, where they hold classical performances.


Understand[edit]
The town takes its name from the Arab "Qal’at Fimi" (that is Rock of Eufemio): he was an officer of Byzantium who, according to an old tradition, favoured the conquest of Sicily by the Saracens.  Some scholars link the name Calatafimi with Acesta, a little town contemporary of Segesta, or with Castrum Phimes, from the name of a noble landowner of Segesta, named also by Cicero. The present town originated around the “Castle of Phimes”, and its oldest part stands here.

Get around[edit]
37°54′46″N 12°51′26″EMap of Calatafimi Segesta
Owing to the particular geographical position of Calatafimi,  many streets have a steep  slope. Moreover, Eufemio Castle and the Church of Santissimo Crocifisso are two perfect points of reference as they are visible from different places. After going uphill for Via Segesta (take the ingresso della cittadina if you are coming from the National Road 113), you get to largo Duca degli Abruzzi which is the right starting point for any exploration. On the left there is Via Alcide de Gasperi (an almost new area), while the main road link is corso Garibaldi, on the right.
From via Marconi, an important main road which continues to Corso Vittorio Emanuele, you will arrive at piazza Plebiscito and can start an artistic tour of the town. Here you can admire the Church of Madonna di Giubino, built by Giovan Biagio Amico from Trapani, close to the 16th-century small church of the Benedictine nunnery of Santa Caterina, and, on the other side of the square, the Church of San Michele, with the Civic Library on its right. Further on, along via Marconi, you will meet the Town Hall (Palazzo Comunale), between palazzo Pampalone, where the hero of the Risorgimento (19th-century struggle for Italian unification), Garibaldi rested after the battle of Pianto Romano, and the 16th-century church of San Giuliano.
From via Marconi you will arrive at piazza Nocito and, behind it, piazza Nullo. At the end of the slope, there is the mother Church of San Silvestro Papa, and, if you go on climbing, you get to the hill’s peak (338 m high) where Eufemio Castle rises.  Coming down viale Oberdan you will find the medieval quarter of Borgo (the old village), that keeps integral its environmental features inside the small streets and courtyards.

Taxi service[edit]
As the town centre of Calatafimi is quite small and its streets are narrow, there is no bus service, so you can walk, or for long distances, you can use your car or get a taxi.

See[edit]
 Segesta archaeological site. The site opens at 09:00 every day, and closes at 17:00 Nov-Feb, 17:30 Mar and Oct, and 18:30 Apr-Sep; last admission one hour before closing.. Segesta is the site of an ancient Graeco-Roman city. The site is immediately off the main A29 road, straight after a long tunnel if travelling from Palermo. Onsite there is free parking. Tarantola Bus goes between Palermo and Calatafimi (aka Calatafimi-Segesta) a few times daily, stopping at Segesta en route. You may have a long wait for a return bus. (Perhaps confusingly, Segesta Bus does not go to Segesta.) Coffee and pizza are available at the cafe near the car park. Adults €6, age 18-25 €3, EU citizens under 18 and first Sunday of the month free. (updated Nov 2019)
Tempio di Segesta
There are 3 major sights at this location, and there are other remains from the Roman and medieval periods which are documented by signs in five languages across the site.
37.941512.83261 The Doric temple, Archaelogical area of Segesta (about a 5-minute uphill walk from the ticket office). Built between 430-420 BCE, 61 m (190 feet) long, 26 m wide, built upon a platform of 4 steps, it has 36 Doric columns supporting the stone roof-frame of the structure (14 columns along the lengths of the building, 6 columns across front and back). They are of a "rough" finish as the temple has never been completed. The temple seems also to have lacked a roof over the cella (main chamber) in antiquity, rather uniquely - scholars are in disagreement as to whether the temple was planned this way, or just never completed. (updated Apr 2016)
37.94112.84382 The Greek Amphitheatre. It is on a hilltop and was built by the Greeks at about 400 BC. It was discovered in the 19th century. They play classical comedies and tragedies in July and August. A bus (€1.50) is available every 30 minutes to the site of the Amphitheatre at the top of the hill. It's a brisk, uphill, 20-minute walk otherwise. (updated Apr 2016)
 The Greek sanctuary, contrada Mango (on the Provincial  Road leading to Segesta). In the archaeological area of Segesta there are the remains of an ancient sanctuary,  dating back perhaps to the 6th century BC and built outside the town centre of Segesta. (updated Apr 2016)

37.9134412.8615813 Ex Convento di San Francesco (ex Saint Francis' friary). The former church, dedicated to saint James the apostle, may have dated back to the 13th century.
