Cromer pier at night
Cromer is a town on the North Norfolk coast famous for its crabs, fishermen and lifeboats. The North Norfolk coast is one of the most rapidly eroding coastlines in Europe. A thousand years ago Cromer was inland ('Crow Mere', the lake of crows seen on the town's coat of arms), and the coastal village was called Shipden. This is now several hundred metres out to sea.
Modern Cromer is a mélange of architectural styles. Everything from charming brick-and-flint and stately Georgian, to 1960s carbuncular to modern bungalows and caravan sites. But the heyday was the 19th century, as witnessed by several streets of tall townhouses (now mainly B&B hotels), the growth stimulated by the coming of the railways and when the popularity of the town and environs was raised by the writings of Clement Scott.


Get in[edit]
52°55′48″N 1°18′0″EMap of Cromer
By car[edit]
The drive from Norwich on the A140 takes about 35-40 minutes. This is a much more dangerous road than it appears: at harvest time especially you should watch for farm vehicles emerging from side roads. You can also get to Cromer quite easily by bus from Norwich. The Coast Hopper operates throughout the year runs to Wells next the Sea with connections to Hunstanton. This is a great way to explore the coast. As you go west along the coast, especially after Sheringham, each village is more picturesque than the last. Lots of barn conversions and vernacular brick-and-flint architecture. By air, the nearest airport is at Norwich.

By train[edit]
Trains run hourly from Norwich, taking 45 min via Salhouse, Hoveton & Wroxham (for Bure Valley railway to Aylsham), Worstead, North Walsham and Gunton, and continuing to West Runton and Sheringham. The last train leaves Norwich around 11PM; in 2022 a walk-up single is £8.70.
The 52.93011.29291 railway station is on Holt Rd half a mile west of town centre. It has ticket machines but no office or toilets. There is level access to the sole platform.

By bicycle[edit]
Regional Cycle Route 30 goes through the town. The Norfolk cycling route, The Rebellion Way, passes close to the town through Sheringham.

On foot[edit]
 Norfolk Coast Path. A long distance (63 miles) footpath originally ending at Cromer (running westwards to Hunstanton) but the path now run westwards to Sea Palling. Links to the Peddlars Way long distance footpath near Hunstanton   (updated Jun 2017)
The Weavers' Way (56 miles) ling distance footpath runs to the town from Great Yarmouth.
Get around[edit]
Cromer is 23 miles from the centre of Norwich, and is a good base for exploring the north coast of Norfolk. Cromer is on several main roads: to Norwich, Holt, along the coast to Sheringham to the west and Overstrand to the west, which can get congested in the town centre especially during the summer months. Although Cromer bustles at all times of the year it is much busier in the summer, especially during Carnival Week in mid-August. There are several car parks inside the town, all of which are pay-and-display. Competition for the few free parking bays is fierce. On the 1st and 3rd Friday of each month, Cromer's Market is held inside the Meadow Car Park, reducing the number of available spaces.
In Cromer and in general in East Anglia, bringing or hiring a car is highly recommended as the area has many small villages and towns separated by long country roads. There are quite a few reasonably good local bus companies (Sanders is the main one) and although Cromer is remarkably hilly for Norfolk, cycling is a good way to get around.

The West Beach (west of the pier) is more built up, with toilets, a shop and a funfair. The East Beach (east of the pier) has fewer amenities. Walking east along the shore, you'll soon be out of the main tourist orbit, and even in the summer holidays you can have huge stretches of beautiful beach more or less to yourself. Even in winter it has a rugged grandeur. The most notable beach fauna is the edible crab (Carcinus edulis), served when available in local cafés and restaurants. Crab boats can be seen launching and returning with their catch. (updated Apr 2017)
