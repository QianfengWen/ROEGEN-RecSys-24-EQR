Amealco (also known as Amealco de Bonfil) is a town in the Bajio region of Mexico in Querétaro state. Known for its colonial era charm, its Otomi traditions, and its rustic natural ambience with mountains, rivers, and waterfalls. Amealco is one of Mexico's designated Pueblos Mágicos.


Understand[edit]
Amealco is an historic Otomi indigenous community and the greater municipal area (county) includes 34 villages populated by Otomi, many speaking their traditional language. The Spanish established Amealco as a city in 1538. Logging became an important industry for the town during the 19th century when thousands of hectares of neaarby forest were cut down to supply wood to Mexico City and for export to France and the United States. 
Amealco is best known for the Maria dolls made by local Otomi women. These rag dolls are typically handmade and sold in mercados and artesania shops throughout Mexico, but especially in the state of Querétaro.
