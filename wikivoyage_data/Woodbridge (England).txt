Woodbridge is a town in Suffolk. It is about 8 miles from the coast, on the River Deben and is the location of medieval burial sites and ancient archaeological finds. The town is probably best known for the Sutton Hoo 6th and 7th century burial sites, something many will be visiting the area to see.


Understand[edit]
Sutton Hoo (Replica) Mask

Archaeological finds show habitation back to 2500-1700 BC. Although the area was under Roman occupation for 300 years, there is little in the way of Roman remains.

The Rendlesham Forest Incident[edit]
In Dec 1980, strange lights were reportedly seen over Rendlesham Forest which were linked with claims of UFO landings. Nearby RAF Woodbridge (used by the USAF at the time) deputy base commander and other base personnel also claim to have seen what they described as a UFO landing.
The reports gained traction and the alleged sightings have been rated as of similar importance to the Roswell Incident (the 1980 "sightings" have become known as 'Britain's Roswell'). The sightings have been attributed to a fireball, Orford Ness Lighthouse and bright stars. Visitors have not been warned to take any special precautions with regard to risks of alien abductions.
