See[edit]
Doorway of St Lachtain's Church
52.7327-7.397831 St Lachtain's Church, Church St, Freshford. C of I church built in 1731, incorporating the Romanesque porch and doorway from a church of 1100. That in turn replaced the first church of 622 AD, looted and destroyed by the Vikings.   (updated Mar 2021)
Freshford Cross on the village green was first erected behind Uppercourt Manor in 1622. Only the little ziggurat of its base remains, moved here in 1790 when the mansion was rebuilt. Hence Bohercrussia Street: Bothar na Croise, "Base of the Cross."
Millennium Park is a pleasant green space north end of the village.
 Uppercourt Manor, Freshford R95 AH94. Mansion built in 1790 over the site of a medieval bishop's palace. In the 20th century it was variously a school, an antiques storeroom and an equestrian centre. It was sold in 2015 and the new owners intend to restore it as a hotel, but nothing's happened with that. (updated Mar 2021)
52.722866-7.4276292 Ballylarkin Abbey (1.5 km west via Bohercrussia St). Built in 1350, this is a disused C of I church. It has fine Gothic carvings and architectural features, including a triple sedilia - where the priest and assistants sat.   (updated Mar 2021)
Three castles - medieval turrets - stand in the fields further west along R693. Clomantagh and Tubrid may be available for holiday rental, Balief is derelict. Don't go to the village of Threecastles east towards Kilkenny: it's notable for its lack of castles.
Foulkscourt Castle is another turret northwest of Johnstown. It's tumbledown and inaccessible.
52.783333-7.3333333 Ballyragget is a village 9 km northeast of Freshford, with an attractive central square, 19th century church and the 15th century turret of Ormonde Castle.

There's occasional talk of reviving the Odeon Cinema, but it's hard to see it prospering in such a small place. So all you get to see here is the Art Deco exterior.
