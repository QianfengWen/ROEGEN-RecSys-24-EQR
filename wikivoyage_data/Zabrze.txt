Zabrze is a city in the Silesian Voivodeship of southern Poland, part of a metropolis centred on Katowice. It's industrial, with a population of 168,946 in 2021. Its top sight is the Coal Mining Museum, with two facilities where you explore underground. 


Understand[edit]
Medieval villages in the forests of Silesia mined coal and worked metal, but remained small until the 18th century, when mining and steel-making techniques advanced. In Zabrze the spark for growth came in 1791 with the discovery of coal suitable for coke, which you need for high-temperature steel and glass manufacture. In this era Poland was carved up between other nations and Zabrze was part of Prussia then Germany. When World War I broke out, it was thought politic to rename the town Hindenburg after the leader of the German Imperial Army. After the war Poland was re-established and the cities of Silesia voted on whether to join it; Hindenburg was among those voting to remain in Germany. It joined Poland and reverted to being Zabrze after World War II. Zabrze gained city rights in 1922. It quickly became of the mid-size industrial towns common in the Silesian region.
The post-war communist government promoted traditional smokestack industries, but these and communism collapsed together in the 1980s. This has left a large industrial heritage which today is the most interesting aspect of Zabrze.
Today, it is one of the cities composing the 2.7 million inhabitant conurbation referred to as the Katowice urban area, itself a major centre in the greater Silesian metropolitan area which is populated by just over five million people

By bus[edit]
Long-distance buses don't call here, change in Katowice.
The bus station is 100 m west of the railway station and in 2024 is one big mess, as the old station is being demolished and a new transport centre built.

Trains from Katowice run every 20 min and take 20 min via Chorzów Batory, Ruda Chebzie and Ruda Śląska, continuing to Gliwice.
An occasional long-distance train calls here, for example from Budapest via Bratislava, Breclav and Ostrava. But usually you change at Katowice coming from anywhere east (Kraków, Warsaw or Gdańsk), or at Gliwice from the west (Berlin or Wrocław).

There was lots of coal down here but the strata are riven by faults, so it took three attempts from 1856 to reach a profitable seam at 170 m depth. When that was exhausted they drilled down to 320 m, and the main part of the museum is down here, with demonstrations of machinery and mining daily life - and death. English tours may be available. After the lower seam was finished Guido acted as a sump, draining other nearby mines, and was also a test bed for mining machinery. It became a museum in 2007. Adult 60 zł.   (updated Apr 2024)
