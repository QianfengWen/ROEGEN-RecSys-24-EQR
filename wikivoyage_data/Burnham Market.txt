Burnham Market is one of the Norfolk Burnhams:

Burnham Deepdale
Burnham Market
Burnham Norton
Burnham Overy (Burnham Overy Staithe and Burnham Overy Town)

Burnham Market came about after three of the original "seven Burnhams by the sea" merged: Burnham Sutton and Burnham Ulph to the east, and Burnham Westgate to the west. St Mary's is the former Burnham Westgate church, while All Saints was the church of Burnham Sutton and Burnham Ulph.
The village is sometimes known as "Chelsea on Sea". Essentially England says Burnham Market is "decidedly more fashionable" than some other Norfolk villages and in 2022, Muddy Stilettos[dead link] said its one of the top 250 places to live in the country.
