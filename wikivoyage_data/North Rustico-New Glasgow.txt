North Rustico and New Glasgow are small rural communities on the north side of Prince Edward Island, Canada.


Understand[edit]
0°0′0″N 0°0′0″E
North Rustico, known locally as "The Crick", is located on the northern coast of Prince Edward Island, bordering Prince Edward Island National Park, and offers a variety of restaurants, accommodations, and deep-sea fishing outfitters. New Glasgow is slightly inland along the banks of the Hunter River, and offers some unique shops and golfing. Both communities are known for their lobster suppers. The area provides a number of restaurants, accommodations and services which support visitors to the Prince Edward Island National Park; many of these businesses are seasonal and highly tourist-oriented, closing for the winter when the park closes in late September.

Get in[edit]
North Rustico Harbour is about 30 km (19 mi) from Charlottetown, take Route 7 north to Route 6 at Oyster Bed Bridge and head west. Route 13, which passes through New Glasgow enroute to Cavendish, connects to the Trans-Canada Highway at Crapaund and is the most direct from Borden-Carleton and the Confederation Bridge.

Get around[edit]
The two communities are connected by Route 258, which travels from New Glasgow to Route 6 at Rusticoville, just south of North Rustico.
