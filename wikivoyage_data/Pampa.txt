Battle of the North Fork of the Red River
In September of 1872, in an area a few miles south of Pampa near McClellan Creek, a detachment of the US Army surprised a large village of Kotsoteka Comanches, killing more than 50 and capturing the rest. The battle marked a turning point in the Texas Indian wars, as it was the first time the whites had struck at the heart of Comanche territory. A Texas Historical Marker on Highway 70 marks the approximate site of the battle.
