Appley Tower
Ryde is the largest town on the Isle of Wight.


Understand[edit]
Ryde is in the north-east of the island. With grand Georgian and Victorian houses, it rises up from the 1/2-mile-long pier and into the hills behind. The pier was built in 1814 and now houses the high-speed ferry link operated by Wightlink to and from Portsmouth, and the terminus for the island's electric railway which runs to Shanklin. The pier is one of only a few in the country that you can drive your car along and park it at the end for the ferry.
The long high street houses a wide variety of shops and boutiques and takes you down to the Esplanade with its golden sand beaches and wide choice of activities. The Esplanade consists of a ten-pin bowling alley, indoor ice rink, swimming pool, and a nightclub as well as numerous amusement arcades and children's play areas.
Further from the Esplanade, is the Promenade which stretches from the esplanade to Puckpool Park. Along the Promenade is Appley Tower, a Victorian Folly and nearby is Appley gardens.
