Namyangju(남양주) is a city in the northeast part of Gyeonggi province, South Korea.

Symbol of Namyangju

Jeong Yak-yong's birthplace, interior
The city's flag represents a better Namyangju connecting nature, people, and culture, leading to positive changes. The symbol expresses the values of connection and openness by linking three Korean characters: ㄴ, ㅇ, and ㅈ.
Green and blue symbolize the clean nature and open future of Namyangju, and contain the vision of Namyangju, a state-of-the-art future city where diversity continues and connects nature, technology, present and the future.

History[edit]
The current city of Namyangju was originally separated from Yangju in 1980. However, the current Jinjeop and Jingeon areas were called ‘Goluino (骨衣奴)’ during the Goguryeo period. This place name was changed to Hwangyang (荒壤) during the Unified Silla period, and it was changed again to Pungyang (豊壤) during the Goryeo period. In this way, the current Jinjeop and Jingeon areas of Namyangju City had a separate place name from Yangju.
The name Yangju first appears in 936 (the 19th year of King Taejo's reign) during the Goryeo Dynasty, and the first record in 『Goryeo History』 is that “Yangju was given to King Gyeon Hwon of Later Baekje as a food settlement.” Afterwards, during the Goryeo Dynasty, the name Yangju continued to be used as the name of a local administrative district.
Then, on April 1, 1980, according to Law No. 3169, the history of Namyangju City begins as Namyangju-gun is newly established by dividing administrative district.
Because of its proximity to Seoul, Namyangju was not only a military point in the outskirts of the capital's defense, but also a gateway to the capital Seoul, northwestern Gyeonggi Province, Gangwon Province, and south of Gyeonggi Province, where transportation and commerce developed.
