Eastport a town in the Down East region of Maine on Moose Island at the junction of Cobscook and Passamaquoddy Bays.  A causeway on Route 190 connects the island to the mainland.


Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Take US Route 1 into Perry and turn onto the start of Route 190. Driving speeds along this route are frequently monitored, so it is best to strictly observe the speed limit while passing through Passamaquoddy tribal lands. Along Route 190, you will drive along a causeway to Moose Island and pass through the town of Quoddy before reaching Eastport. Washington street is a common turn-off point which leads to the north end of Water street's commercial section, or follow Route 190 to its end in southern Eastport.

By plane[edit]
Air travel to Eastport is difficult. While there is a municipal airport, major commercial airlines do not fly there and will only go as far as Bangor. Personal aircraft or chartered flights may be able to get closer.

Get around[edit]
The area is walkable and relatively flat. Most shops and restaurants located on a quarter-mile stretch of Water Street providing easy access.
