Boats on the Huon River
Franklin is a small town of 444 (2021) in the Huon and Far South region of Southern Tasmania. The quiet riverside town sits along the western banks of the Huon River about 7 km southwest of Huonville, the regional centre of the Huon.
The Huon River is about 800 metres wide around Franklin, but with the long-but-narrow Egg Islands in the middle. The islands aren't easily visitable, but the isolation from predators has made it a haven for Tasmanian nativehens.
