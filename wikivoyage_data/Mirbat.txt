Once the capital of Dhofar, the town of Mirbat is now known primarily for fishing.


Understand[edit]
In ancient times Mirbat was the capital of Dhofar, with an income derived from the frankincense trade and from breeding Arabian horses. During the Dhofar Rebellion it was the site of the Battle of Mirbat in 1972. Today the town has a population of 15,000.

See[edit]

Baobab tree in Wadi Hinna
16.9926754.696421 Mirbat Castle. This fortress was besieged during the Battle of Mirbat in 1972, and is under restoration. 
16.99189854.6918062 Old houses (near the beach and fort). Mirbat has a number of old merchant houses, built in traditional Yemeni-style mud brick with hand-carved doors and windows. 
17.00231854.6906063 Mausoleum of Bin Ali, Bin Ali Rd. Mohammed Bin Ali was a 14th-century local Islamic scholar, and this structure is actually a mosque built over his tomb. Visitors should remove their shoes and be appropriately dressed, and women should cover their hair. A large cemetery surrounds the mosque and tomb. 
17.0535954.6087984 Baobab grove, Wadi Hinna (15 km west of Mirbat: from Hwy 49 turn north onto the road to Tawi Atayr). This is the only place in Arabia where you can find baobab trees growing in the wild. Their nearest relatives are found in eastern Africa, and it is unclear if there was once a larger forest here, or if a tree was intentionally planted here at some point. There is a well-worn footpath leading from the car park into the grove, which has some truly enormous specimens. Further on there is a picturesque spring with ferns and fig trees. 
17.04320454.6128215 Anti-Gravity Point (Magnetic Point) (on the road to Tawi Atayr, below the baobab trees). This is a well-known gravity hill (magnetic hill), where cars left in neutral will appear to drift uphill in apparent defiance of gravity.
