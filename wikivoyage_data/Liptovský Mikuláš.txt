Understand[edit]
Liptovský Mikuláš (pronunciation (help·info); until 1952 Liptovský Svätý Mikuláš, German: Liptau-Sankt-Nikolaus; Hungarian: Liptószentmiklós) is a town in northern Slovakia, on the Váh River. It lies in the Liptov region, in Liptov Basin near the Low Tatras and Tatra Mountains. Known as Liptovský Svätý Mikuláš (or Liptovský Saint Nicholas) before communist times, the town is also renowned for its guilds and culture.
From the second half of the 10th century until 1918, it was part of the Kingdom of Hungary. The town of Mikuláš (Liptószentmiklós) was first mentioned in the royal deed of King Ladislaus IV in 1286. The first written record mentioning the Church of Saint Nicolaus, which was to become the founding element of a larger settlement, dates back to 1299. The Church of Saint Nicolaus is the oldest building in town.
Mikuláš was one of the most important centres of crafts in the Liptov region. The craftsmen formed guilds. The oldest guild was the shoemaker's guild, first mentioned in 1508. There were also other guilds, of smiths, furriers, tailors, hatters and butchers.
In 1677, Liptovský Mikuláš (Liptószentmiklós) became the seat of the local district, and of Liptó county. The legendary Slovak "Robin Hood" Juraj Jánošík was sentenced and executed here in 1713 by being hanged by the ribcage on a hook. In the 19th century, the town became one of the centres of the Slovak national movement.
In the 20th century, many once independent villages were annexed to Liptovský Mikuláš. Thus, what was once the bucolic farmers' hamlet of Vrbicá is now simply a street in the middle of the town.
Folk architecture can also be seen nearby in Vlkolínec near Ružomberok, or Pribylina, a few kilometres east of the town, and for recreation the lake called Liptovská Mara is available. Aquapark Tatralandia is nearby.
