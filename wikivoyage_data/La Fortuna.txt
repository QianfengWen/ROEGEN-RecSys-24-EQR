La Fortuna de San Carlos is a small town in the north of Costa Rica. It is known mainly for the nearby Arenal Volcano (1,633 m), a destination for scientists and tourists. See volcanoes for general information.


Understand[edit]
Arenal volcano in 2007. As of 2013, the volcano has been inactive for three years and there's no lava flow to see.
La Fortuna was called "El Borio" before an eruption in 1968 that destroyed 3 villages--Tabacón, Pueblo Nuevo and San Luís. El Borio (La Fortuna) is located on the west side of the volcano and was untouched. After the eruption of the volcano, El Borio was renamed "La Fortuna", which means "the fortunate", referring to the town's luck during the eruption.

Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
There are direct buses from San José (5.5hrs) (US$7) or with transfer in Ciudad Quesada (San Carlos) (2hrs). Also, buses from San Ramon (Costa Rica). There is one local bus per day from Tilaran. From Peñas Blancas (Nicaraguan border) take San Carlos bus (US$8) and get off at Tanque, take bus or taxi to La Fortuna (7 km (4.3 mi) away).
When leaving La Fortuna, bus schedules seem to be highly arbitrary and unreliable. The more often you ask, the more departure times they will tell you. Some touts will try to exploit this situation. It is best to approximately have a bus departure time, arrive a little earlier and plan for 1 hr waiting or so.

By shared shuttle[edit]
There are several companies, such as Daytrip, offering direct shared shuttle buses to La Fortuna from San Jose a few times a day. They depart from Selina San Jose, San Jose International Airport, or custom pickup locations either in the morning (7:45AM Selina San Jose, 9:00AM SJO) or afternoon (1:00PM Selina San Jose, 2:15PM SJO). Prices start at $30, and tickets can be booked in advance to guarantee a seat.

By private shuttle[edit]
The cost of a private transportation with a Costa Rican driver is not much if you compare it with the benefit of a direct safe drive to the destination. Available from San Jose to Arenal and other destinations.

By car[edit]
It is a 3½-hr drive from San José, but the junctions are not very well marked, so bring a good map.

By plane[edit]
Domestic flights are available with Aerobell Airlines, Sansa Airlines or Skyway Airlines[dead link]. Costs around US$90 for flights to/from San José (SJO) or Quepos (Manuel Antonio National Park). Airport charges US$7/person departure tax.

Get around[edit]
Map of La Fortuna
By road[edit]
There are one or two buses that go around the volcano. Generally, tourists rely on taxis or their own cars (everywhere you will have to pay for parking). Taxis can be hailed next to Parquella Fortuna, however using ride sharing apps can save you half the taxi rides' price. You can also rent a scooter (US$40/day, down to US$20/day for 5 or more days) or motorcycle ($75/day), however during the rainy season this can be uncomfortable.

By thumb[edit]
Hitch-hiking is actually a reasonable option and quite easy if you are travelling on a tight budget. This way you can reach the park entrance, trails or hot springs time independently and fast.


See[edit]
10.463333-84.7033331 Arenal Volcano. The photos at the right of this article are views from the village of El Castillo, on the southwest side of the Volcano, about 25 km (16 mi) west of La Fortuna and about 4 km (2.5 mi) up the road from the Arenal National Park entrance. There are great views of Lake Arenal and the Monteverde Cloud Forest from road up above El Castillo. In October 2010, the volcano ceased its activity and the famous flowing lava has been gone since. Seeing some smoke during the day is possible, however, do not expect to see lava/eruptions in the night, regardless of clouds. This could change at any time. Tours to the National Park usually start out in the early afternoon and include walking for about an hour through lava rocks before reaching El Mirador, the best place to view the eruption of the volcano. There are also possibilities of skipping the lava rock walking and go straight to El Mirador. Most tours state that they will stay for 1-1½ hr at this place, but if there is nothing to be seen, probably a lot less. It might be chilly, so bring a jacket. The tours come in a variety of options: with buffet dinner and entrance to the Tabacon hot spa $64, with entrance to Baldi hot spa $30, just the tour $25. There is also a possibility of a no-frills tour by mini-bus to El Mirador and back to Fortuna for $10.   (updated Nov 2020)
10.533333-84.9333332 Lake Arenal. Just west of the Arenal Volcano and can be seen as you drive over the dam on the main highway to Tilaran. Much better views of the lake and volcano can be seen from the hills above the village of El Castillo, which is located 9 km (5.6 mi) from the main highway on the Arenal National Park road. Activities on lake include boat tours, fishing, kayaking, and wind surfing.   
10.440911-84.6763863 Fortuna Waterfall (Catarata Río Fortuna), ☏ +506 24799515, info@arenaladifort.com. entrance closes 17:00. Stone steps lead to the bottom. Take a swimsuit for the pool in the lovely stream below. The entrance is accessible by road, so a cab works fine too. Once you pay to go in, you are free to stay as long as you'd like. It's about a 10-min hike down to the waterfall and 20 min back up. Foreigner adults: US$20, Children age 8 and under: Free.   (updated Jan 2024)

The lake has many species of fish but the "Guapote" Bass is most prevalent; this fish is a close relative of the peacock bass and is just as strong.

Hiking[edit]
Arenal volcano
In spite of expectations, all hiking opportunities are just at the foot of the volcano with often not very great views of the volcano. Of course, the journey is the reward, but if you really want to see a volcano, head to Poas. Otherwise, great views (and pictures) of the volcano are from the southwestern side near the lake.

 Arenal Volcano Night Hike. Around a two-hour hike through secondary rainforest which contains lots of habitat of monkeys, spiders, congos, some cariblancos and not leaving behind the tucans, turkeys, and the big quantity of different flora that's in the outskirts of the volcano. There are some emerald green hot springs, colored from copper deposits. (updated Nov 2020)

Stay safe[edit]
As of Feb 2019, those of you who catch the 8AM bus to Tilarán, be aware that every morning at the bus station there is a man talking nicely to the tourists and getting on the same bus. 4 km (2.5 mi) before the National Park's bus stop, this man shouts "Parque Ecológico" and some tourists, who are confused, get off with him. He works for a private park that has nothing to do with the real National Park! This "fake" park also demand US$15—for a walk of just one hour! This is a scam that happens every morning. Do not fall for it, just wait another 4 km (2.5 mi) more, when the bus driver announces "Parque Nacional". Spread the word and if you are on the bus while this happens, don't be afraid to inform the others tourists loudly that Parque Ecológico is not the National Park. Or if you are keen, also inform the authorities/police.
In general, La Fortuna is very touristy, and everyone is trying to make money off it. There are some touts, especially near the bus station. Just be cautious and do not believe everything.

Cope[edit]
All of the so called "tourist informations" or "tourist centers" are actually tour agents. Remind yourself, they will always try to sell you something, even though you could just organise it yourself for way less money. But you can sometimes get information for free from them.
Fortuna is often called the tout capital of Costa Rica. There is not really much to see here except a beautiful lake, volcano and rivers. Still somehow dozens of different tours are on sale, giving the impression this place is more special than the rest of Costa Rice. Most of the tours are rather dull and just include service you can organise by yourself. At the waterfall and river (hot spring) pools tour, where they serve beer and snacks, it is not really worth spending a full day and even less paying US$50 or more. You can organise such trips by yourself, for around $5-10 if you rely on hitch-hiking and buses.
If you are travelling on a shoestring it might not be worth it coming here, just to swim in a river, hike a 3-4 hr trail and do some average white-water rafting. Yes, definitely there are good views of the vulcano, but this town is just making money of nothing—not a very authentic Costa Rica.

Connect[edit]
There are two internet cafes in the main street, by the park. At Destinytours (+506 479-9850) 50 m north of Banco National you can download pictures from your digital camera and burn to CD.

Go next[edit]
Caño Negro Wildlife Refuge near Los Chiles
From Fortuna you can go to Monteverde with a combination of jeep and boat or horse. Or you could take the bus to Tilarán, and from there to Santa Elena, Monteverde, or down to the Interamericana that takes you north to Guanacaste or south in the direction of Puntarenas. You can get to Los Chiles and San Jose via Ciudad Quesada. And of course there's the direct bus back to San José, at an approximate cost of US$6.50.
