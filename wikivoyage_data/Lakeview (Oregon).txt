Downtown Lakeview
Lakeview is a town of 2,400 people (2020) in eastern Oregon. The city bills itself as the "Tallest Town in Oregon" because of its elevation, 4,802 feet (1,464 m) above sea level. It is part of the "Oregon Outback", attracting tourist, sportsmen, and outdoors enthusiasts. Local attractions include fishing, birdwatching, camping, hang gliding, paragliding, hiking, rockhounding, hunting, and nature viewing.


Understand[edit]
Lakeview dots in the Goose Lake Valley at the foot of the Warner Mountains and at the edge of Oregon's high desert country. Its economy is based on agriculture, lumber production, and government activities. Oregon's Outback Scenic Byway passes through Lakeview along Highway 395.
It is 13 miles north of the California state line, in a region known as the Oregon Outback.

U.S. Route 395 from the north and south, and Oregon Route 140 from the east and west. There is no scheduled train or bus service.
By road, the nearest incorporated cities are Klamath Falls, Oregon, 96 miles (154 km) west of Lakeview; Bend, Oregon, 175 miles (282 km) to the northwest; Burns, Oregon, 139 miles (224 km) to the northeast; Winnemucca, Nevada, 211 miles (340 km) to the southeast; and Alturas, California, 54 miles (87 km) south of Lakeview.

The Lake County Airport is 3 miles (5 km) southwest of the Lakeview's downtown area. It is a public airport owned by Lake County residents. 

Get around[edit]
Get acquainted with Lakeview by walking the downtown area. Except for some businesses on the west side of town (mostly along N 4th Street/SR 140) and the south side (along US 395), most retail establishments are within the grid bounded by E, G, N 4th, and S 2nd Streets.
Except for some of the newer areas on the west side of town, most streets are numbered (for streets going east and west) and lettered (north-south). The use of compass directions in addresses can be initially confusing:

There are no east-west designations in address numbers: streets start at the edge of the mountain to the east of town, with addresses increasing to the west.
Center Street runs east and west. Streets parallel to it have North or South as part of the street name. For instance, 700 S 9th St. would be 1 block west of 600 S 9th St., on an east-west street that is 9 blocks south of Center.
On lettered streets, North and South are part of the address number: For instance, 123 S G St. would be in the second block south of Center Street.
