Map of Lezhë
Lezhë is about 8 km from the excellent beach of Shëngjin (St. John), about 30 km south of Shkodra, and 50 km north of Tirana. With the newer construction of the SH1 motorway that goes aside this city, it is nicely connected with major cities.

By bus[edit]
41.7802419.640651 Lezhë bus station (just across the bridge to the centre, on the main north-south road). Most buses and vans (furgons) arrive and depart from this little square. There are signs indicating where to wait for which destination. Furgons to Rrëshen and Laç leave from the center of town. (updated Jul 2021)
From Tirana one can catch a bus from the National Bus Station (Northern and Southern Bus Terminal.) It departs every hour on the hour during the day and costs 250 lek.
From Durrës, there are two direct buses per day to Lezhë from the main bus station.
From Shkodra, it's easiest to take a furgon from Sheshi Demokracia headed for Tirana.
From cities in the south either change in Tirana or catch a bus/furgon to Shkodra and ask the driver if he can stop in Lezhë.
If you are coming from the Northeast, you may have to get off in Milot and transfer to another vehicle.

There is one daily train that runs from Shkodra to Durrës and back that stops here, however the timetable is unknown, and service is intermittent because of the national rail company's continuous financial trouble.

Get around[edit]
The entire city of Lezhë is quite walkable.
To get to villages or to the beach at Shëngin, take a group van from the parking lot just past the bridge in the center of town.
