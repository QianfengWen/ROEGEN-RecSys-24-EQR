Boone can be said as having a diverse climate with a big fluctuation of temperatures throughout the year. Although Boone is located in the American South, its climate can be more comparable to the northeastern United States with long cold winters and warm, but less humid summers. Winters are cold and snow is common with afternoon temperatures rarely getting above 40°F (4°C). Low temperatures during the winter typically drop to as low as 17°F (-8°C). January is the snowiest month when as much as 10 inches (25 cm) can fall, making it the most popular time of the year for skiers and snowboarders. Throughout the year, Boone on average receives about 35 inches (89 cm) of snow. Springs are generally cool with afternoon temperatures around 61°F (16°C). Fall is very popular amongst "leaf lookers,"  long-distance travelers looking at fall foliage across the Appalachian Mountains. Temperatures during fall are generally comparable to spring with afternoon temperatures falling below 70°F (21°C). Summers are much cooler than the rest of the American South and far less humidity. Average summertime high temperatures typically stay under 80°F (27°C) with frequent afternoon showers and thunderstorms when as much as an inch of rain (2.5 cm) can fall at a given time. June is the wettest month when about 5 inches (12.7 cm) of rain falls. Relative humidity in the summer generally stays under 80 percent, unlike most of the southeast.

Get around[edit]
Map of Boone (North Carolina)
Bus[edit]
AppalCART has eight bus routes running in Boone. The buses are free to use within city limits.

Foot[edit]
The downtown area is very compact and easily walkable. The remainder of town is well provided with sidewalks and some bike lanes, making non-automotive transportation a reasonable idea.

Taxi[edit]

See[edit]
36.151471-81.6665911 Blue Ridge Parkway. The parkway crosses Hwy 421 east of Boone and Hwy 321 to the south of Boone. If you head south on 321 toward Blowing Rock you'll soon come upon it. 
36.230803-81.6772512 Howard's Knob, 604 Howard's Knob Rd. This is a short drive up the mountain and a great experience as it affords the most commanding view of all of downtown Boone. As you are riding in on either Hwy 421 or Hwy 321 you will not be able to miss the huge mountain sticking up out of the surrounding landscape. Howard's Knob park is up at the very top and it's easy to get to, you just have to know which road to turn onto off of King St. Heading west on 421, you will turn right onto Cherry St. Keep heading uphill and when you come to an intersection go in the direction that looks like it's leading uphill and before you know it you will come upon the park. 
36.212468-81.6843593 Appalachian State Mountaineers, Kidd Brewer Stadium, 425 Jack Branch Dr., ☏ +1 828 262-2079, toll-free: +1-800-919-2777. Fields teams in 10 men's sports and 10 women's sports, but best known for being one of the winningest programs in college football. They were champions in the NCAA Sun Belt East division in 2018 and 2019. 
36.095978-81.8319194 Grandfather Mountain, 9872 North Carolina 105, Banner Elk, ☏ +1 (828) 963-9522. Expansive park with challenging mountain cliffs, scenic views and camping options. (updated Jun 2017)

The grounds preserve the country estate of Moses Cone, a prosperous textile entrepreneur, conservationist, and philanthropist of the Gilded Age. Its centerpiece is Flat Top Manor, a 20-room, 13,000-sq-foot mansion built in 1901 which is now home to the Parkway Craft Center. 
Do[edit]
Ski[edit]
In skiing season, there are several nearby mountains that offer skiing.

36.194317-81.8781911 Beech Mountain Resort (Ski Beech), 1007 Beech Mtn Pkwy, Beech Mountain, toll-free: +1-800-438-2093. Su-Th 9AM-9PM; F Sa 9AM-10PM; partial days 9AM-1PM, 1PM-5PM, 5PM-close; seasonal. Generally less appealing than nearby Sugar Mountain, Beech Mountain's infrastructure shows its age; for example, lift tickets do not use barcodes and are checked by eye. Lifts are very slow (not helped by needing to leave empty seats for weight balance) and difficult to get on and off of due to their low load height. The trails have a fair assortment of difficulties, although beginners will feel fairly limited. However there are a number of crisscrossing intermediate trails to choose from, as well as multiple terrain parks. You can also buy a ticket for any third or two-thirds of the day (morning, afternoon, or night). Adult lift ticket $25-77. (updated Mar 2015)
36.174019-81.6611222 Appalachian Ski Mountain (Between Boone and Blowing Rock), toll-free: +1-800-322-2373. 
36.130784-81.8575773 Sugar Mountain Resort (Ski Sugar), 1009 Sugar Mtn Dr, Sugar Mountain, toll-free: +1-800-784-2768. 9AM-10PM; half-day 12:30PM-4:30PM, 6PM-10PM; seasonal. Although you can't tell from the map, Sugar Mountain feels like a much larger resort than nearby Beech Mountain. Trails are longer with much higher vertical drop, and an excellent mix of terrain for everyone from beginners to experts. A 6-person express lift (installed in 2015) runs straight up the mountain, so there's plenty of capacity and lines are usually short. The single terrain park has a tow handle lift so you can practice tricks repeatedly. Adult lift tickets $24-70. (updated Jan 2016)
Snowtubing[edit]

Sleep[edit]
Trying to find lodging in Boone or nearby Banner Elk or Blowing Rock is a disaster. There are thousands of cabins around, and no consolidated way to search them. Websites are awful, ranging from out of date and poorly maintained, to unhelpful or even nonfunctional. Several others have no online search capability, expecting you to call, or manually read as many as 100 individual cabin listings each on a separate page. Of sites that do have search capability, it's generally inadequate; searching for "lodging near ski slopes" might show places as far as 30 minutes away, with its location just described as "Boone".
