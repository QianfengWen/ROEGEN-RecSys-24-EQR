Yuryev-Polsky (Russian: Юрьев-Пóльский) is an ancient town in the northern part of Vladimir Oblast. While the town isn't one of the Golden Ring towns, it has likewise sights from the Middle Ages including a unique white-stone monument, the 13th-century Cathedral of St. George.

Geography[edit]
Yuryev-Polsky is in the field region (Vladimirskoe Opolye) on the banks of the tiny river Koloksha, the left tributary of the Klyazma. The land near the town is almost flat. There are no natural fortifications, and the spot is quite unpractical from the medieval point of view. The choice of this location was motivated by the agricultural importance of the region and the huge trading activity during the Middle Ages: the roads from Vladimir, Suzdal, Pereslavl Zalessky, and Rostov Veliky crossed here. The town has lost its hub position. It stands on a minor railway line, far away from any big roads. Yuryev-Polsky is in the geographical center of the Golden Ring, but the lack of transport connections prevents most travellers from visiting the town.

History[edit]
Yuryev-Polsky was founded in 1152 by Prince Yury Dolgoruky. The name of the town is related to the founder (Yuryev) and to the location (Polsky or Polskoy, this means "standing in the field" and has nothing to do with Poland). The town was situated in the agricultural region of Vladimir Fields, at the crossing of several trading roads. This advantageous location led to the rapid development. In 1212, Yuryev-Polsky became the center of the small principality that appeared after the defragmentation of Vladimir-Suzdal state. The importance of the town was emphasized by the construction of the white-stone Cathedral of St. George. However, the decay started already in 1238 when the town was destroyed by Batu Khan. Yuryev-Polsky also suffered from further Mongol invasions in 1382 and 1408. 
The shift of the capital to Moscow changed the trading activity, and the location of Yuryev-Polsky became less advantageous. Since 14th century, Yuryev-Polsky was considered as a minor settlement on the outskirts of Moscow principality. The town was entrusted to foreign rulers subordinated to Moscow princes. Since 17th century, Yuryev-Polsky is a regular provincial town, standing away from any important roads. The only active road passed from Moscow to Suzdal, but it decayed after the construction of railways, and the town turned to its present, sleepy state. Yuryev-Polsky is recorded in the well-known 1968 Russian film The Golden Calf, after the satiric novel by Ilf and Petrov.

Orientation[edit]
Yuryev-Polsky has a pretty simple rectangular layout. The river flows from north to south and slightly disturbs the regular arrangement of streets and houses. The road from Vladimir comes from the east, the road to Alexandrov and Moscow goes to the south-west, and the road to Pereslavl Zalessky leaves the town in the northern direction. The railroad passes along the southern boundary of the town. The historical center is quite compact and is on the left (eastern) bank of the river. The main square is named Советская площадь (Soviet square). The Trading rows and the monastery of Archangel Michael are found right on this square. The cathedral of St. George is hundred meters away, behind the monastery. The monastery and the cathedral lie within the well-preserved, picturesque ancient ramparts.

Get in[edit]
Map of Yuryev-Polsky
Transport connections to Yuryev-Polsky are rather inconvenient. If you do not have a car, the best starting points are Moscow, Vladimir, Alexandrov, and Ivanovo.

By plane[edit]
The nearest international airports are in Moscow.

By train[edit]
56.484539.66881 Yuryev-Polsky railway station (in the southern part of the town, 1.5 km away from the historical center), ☏ +7 49246-22-307. The wooden railway station from the 1890s got an outer shell of bricks in the early 2000s, yet the shape of the building and its roof still is reminiscent of the old design. As there are few train services, the station is in practice closed most of the time even if it's supposed to be open around the clock. 
The only direct train from Moscow is the night train to Kineshma. Yuryev-Polsky is at the middle of the route, and as such the stops will be in the middle of the night making this an inconvenient alternative. There are local trains from Alexandrov (1 daily, 2 hr travel time) and Ivanovo (2 daily, 2½ hr travel time), which much more frequent connections to Moscow, but even by these routes, daytrips by train are far from convenient. The train from Alexandrov arrives in the evening, and the trains from Ivanovo arrive in the morning (but departure from Ivanovo is about half past four in the morning) and even later in the evening.
By bus[edit]
56.489139.66982 Yuryev-Polsky bus station (is near the railway station, south from the historical center), ☏ +7 49246-22-153 (time-table), +7 4924 22-373. The station is open from early morning till 17:00 or 18:00. (updated May 2019)
Bus services are more frequent than train. From Vladimir there are buses every two hours, travel time 2 hr. From Alexandrov there are five daily buses, travel time 2 hr. From Moscow there are four daily buses via Kolchugino and Kirzhach (travel time 3½-4 hr) or almost hourly buses to Kolchugino from where you can take a taxi for the remaining 30 km. However, traffic jams are common along the highway from Moscow so the bus trip can take longer than scheduled. There are no intercity bus services from Yaroslavl and Ivanovo, but you can get in by route taxi (marshrutka) from there.
By car[edit]
Parking next to the church of Saint John the Evangelist
Coming by car, there are picturesque roads through the fields from Vladimir and Kolchugino. 

From Moscow: 160 km along A103 (via Kirzhach and Kol'chugino). Upon entering the town, pass three or four crossings, turn right, and cross the river (there is no road sign). From Moscow, you may want to take the road towards Yaroslavl and via Alexandrov rather than via Scholkovo and Kirzach as the crow flies — it's about 30 km longer but the road is much better.
From Vladimir: 70 km along R74. Upon entering the town, you will pass under a railway bridge. Turn left on the next crossing.
From Alexandrov: 77 km (via Kol'chugino).
From Ivanovo: via Suzdal - Obraschiha or Vladimir only. There is no adequate road from Yuryev-Polsky to Ivanovo Oblast. The road from Gavrilov Posad to Yuryev-Polsky via Osanovec and Skomovo while exists and paved, contains several segments of extremely bad pavement. (Video footage of the road's condition can be seen here, the worst part begins at timestamp 7:10.)
From Pereslavl Zalessky: 70 km along R74. The road from Pereslavl-Zalessky (the north) is of varying quality, the same goes for the road from Gavrilov Posad.
From Suzdal: 65 km via the villages Obraschiha or Staryi Dvor.
In Yuryev-Polsky, there is a lot of space for free parking. In the daytime the central square may be crowded due to the market. Additionally, the street along the monastery of Archangel Michael (towards the cathedral of St. George) is closed for traffic.

Get around[edit]
The historical center of Yuryev-Polsky is very small and can be easily explored by foot. The hotels and places to eat are also nearby, while walking to the train and bus stations should not be difficult as well. Inside the town, there is a regular (every half-hour) minibus service. Additionally, long-distance buses make a stop in the historical center.

Religious buildings[edit]
Cathedral of St. George
56.49646939.6799551 Cathedral of St. George (Георгиевский собор), ул. 1 мая. One of the most impressive buildings of ancient Russian architecture. The cathedral was constructed in 1234 in the general style of that period. The appearance of the building was likely similar to that of St. Demetrius cathedral in Vladimir or the church of the Intercession on the Nerl in Bogolyubovo. All the walls were covered by finest stone carvings that formed huge compositions. In the 15th century, the cathedral collapsed, and craftsmen from Moscow repaired the building. However, they were not aware of the original project. Moreover, some stones were broken or lost, and the craftsmen did their best to collect the remainings. The result is the present unusual shape of the cathedral with the unexpectedly huge dome, sitting on the top of the relatively small, stocky building. The walls are covered by carvings, but the original order of the images is unknown, and their present layout is partly accidental. The carvings of this cathedral remain an even greater puzzle than the decoration of St. Demetrius cathedral in Vladimir. Inside the cathedral, one can see ancient tombs of local princes and parts of original stones that were not used during the reconstruction in the 15th century. Wall paintings are pretty regular and date back to the 17th century.   
56.497839.68222 Monastery of Archangel Michael (Михаило-Архангельский монастырь), ул. 1 мая/Советская пл. The monastery dates back to early 13th century, but its present buildings are much later (16th–18th century). The complex is surrounded by a stone wall with towers. The wall was built in the 16th century, and then rebuilt in 18th century. The towers still look fortress-like and quite impressive, while the wall is rather low and does not have any defensive function. Behind the wall, there are several churches in Russian style: the cathedral of Archangel Michael (late 18th century), the church of Orans (1625), the church of John the Evangelist (over the gate, 17th century), and the wooden church of St. George (17th century, this church was moved from a neighboring village). Additionally, there are a hip-roof bell tower and a refectory building from the 17th century. The cathedral of Archangel Michael belongs to the church, while other buildings are used by the museum.  
56.49685439.6731763 Church of St. Nikita and church of the Intercession (Церкви Никиты Мученика и Покрова Пресвятой Богородицы), Покровская ул (south-west from the historical center, across the river). A complex of two churches from the late 18th century. The church of the Intercession is built in the Russian style, while the church of St. Nikita is a nice example of classicism and has a tall red-brick bell-tower. These two churches are the religious center of the town.  (updated Jun 2018)
56.51155339.6838354 Bell tower of the convent of Peter and Paul (Колокольня бывшего Петропавловского монастыря). Built in the late 19th century, Russian revival. A huge red-brick bell tower, the remain of the former convent. The ravaged refectory building can be found nearby. (updated Jun 2017)

56.50624339.6851336 Church of the Nativity (Церковь Рождества Пресвятой Богородицы). Built in 1700, Russian style, and the remains of the church of St. Boris and St. Gleb (late 18th century).  (updated Jun 2017)
56.50136439.6801237 Monastery of the Presentation (Свято-Введенский Никонов монастырь). This monastery keeps the remains of two churches in Russian style from the late 17th century (church of the Presentation and church of St. Nicholas). Both churches were ravaged and rebuilt during the Soviet time. Now they have been restored by monks. (updated Jun 2017)
Secular buildings[edit]

Secular buildings are rather unremarkable and present the general provincial style of the 19th century.

There used to be only two cafés in the whole city, and visitors had a hard time finding a place to eat as one was often reserved for private events and the other wasn't particularly inviting. The situation is better now with several eateries around, but places are still rather basic.

56.4992639.680761 ArtKofe (АртКофе) (in the front of the market). Kiosk with a coffee machine with a range of hipster coffees from vanilla cappuccino to blueberry frappe. However they're bad at making normal coffee, asking for a double espresso will give you a mediocre americano. (updated Jun 2018)
56.4986639.67762 Kafe Bagration (Кафе «Багратион»), ул. Краснооктябрьская, 30. M-W 10:00-18:00, Th-Sa 10:00-03:00. A standard Russian downtown restaurant serving lunch at mid-day and turning into an a la carte restaurant with entertainment during weekend nights. (updated Jun 2018)

56.5007339.680365 Restoran Tokio (Ресторан «Токио»), Каланчёвский пер. 9. 11:00-24:00.

General remark: there are few local buses in Yuryev-Polsky, and their schedule is somewhat irregular and intricate. If you want to visit the neighboring villages, it is certainly advisable to hire a taxi.

56.76534439.5306752 Luchki (Лучки) (10 km north of Sima, 30 km north of Yuryev, local buses twice a week). In the beginning of the 20th century, the Russian merchant Pervushin built a factory for dextrine production here. The factory building is a nice example of industrial architecture from the early 20th century, while old wooden houses are remarkable for their fine carvings. (updated Jun 2018)
56.363139.99783 Nebyloe (Небылое) (30 km from Yuryev, take a bus to Vladimir).

The monastery was founded in the late 15th century, while the stone buildings were constructed in the 17th century (Russian style). These buildings were partially or fully destroyed during the Soviet period. You can see three renovated churches, although none of them are really impressive. (updated Jun 2018)
56.68307939.5483354 Sima (Сима) (25 km from Yuryev (the road to Pereslavl Zalessky), buses to Pereslavl Zalessky, Luchki, or Spasskoe (normally, 2-3 times a day)).

Trinity church in Podolez
56.6878739.8059136 Trinity church in Podolez (Троицкая церковь в Подольце) (30 km from Yuryev). One of the most beautiful churches in the opole, the boyars of Miloslavskys had it built in 1659 in the newest Moscow style of the day. It's notable for its shape with a two-story porch continuing into the bell tower, and for the many stone carvings, patterns and windows. The church used to be in a shabby state and was restored around 2010, but not quite true to the original design but rather painting it in different colors. Nevertheless this did not do much damage to the church and its still quite pretty. (updated Jun 2018)
56.64223639.5818317 Fyodorov Manor (Усадьба Фёдоровское) (18 km from Yuryev, left side of the road).

There's also a park with smaller buildings part of the same complex.

Further away[edit]
Obvious choices to go next are Vladimir, Suzdal and Pereslavl Zalessky, with a similar heritage, or Alexandrov which was the capital of Ivan the Terrible's private police, the oprichnina. If you've already seen these, the countryside is beautiful and has many things to see from estates to early Soviet architecture, though you would really need a car to get around these places.

Vladimir – the center of the region and the ancient city. Vladimir preserves several fine 12th-century monuments of white-stone architecture and a number of later buildings, along with numerous options for accommodation, eating, and entertainment.
Alexandrov – an old town with a monastery from the 16th century, the country residence of Russian princes during the Middle Ages.
Kirzhach – a small and lovely town notable for its 16th-century monastery and a nice location on the steep bank of the river.
Pereslavl Zalessky – one of the ancient towns of the Golden Ring. Numerous old churches and monasteries and the picturesque location near the lake.
Suzdal – another popular town of the Golden Ring. Suzdal is entirely touristy place, a kind of stark Russian history.
Teykovo – a town in the neighboring Ivanovo Oblast. Teykovo presents a vast choice of secular and industrial architecture from the early 20th century.
