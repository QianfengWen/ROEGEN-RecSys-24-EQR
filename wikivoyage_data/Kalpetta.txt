11.6775.957781 Banasura Sagar Dam (24 km). the largest earthen dam in India 
11.51222276.0894442 Chembra Peak (17 km). Standing tall at 2100 m, the Chembra Peak is the highest peak in Wayanad, and a favorite trekking spot. It is part of the Western Ghats. The trek to the top can take up to 2 hours. The heart-shaped lake on the peak forms one of the attractions for the mountain trek here. To do the trek, you need to pay an entrance fee from the entry guard house near Meppadi. Typically, start the trek in the morning as you are not allowed to start the trek after noon. If you are not game for a hectic 2-hour trek, you can still do a flat trek till a nearby viewpoint and visitors center for a nominal fee. The Chembra Peak area has a variety of orchids and other flowering plants, and plenty of bird species, making the trek an enjoyable experience. Good toilets are available near the guard house. The road leading to the entrance was in bad condition as of October 2017. ₹20 for visiting area entry.   (updated Nov 2017)
11.625876.23563 Edakkal Caves (28 km). 9AM-4PM (last entry). This must-see location of breathtaking beauty in the Ambukuthy Mountain is not a cave in the real sense. As stated in the India Antiquary, it is only "a cleft about 96 ft long and 22 ft wide in the rock". The word edakkal (eda+kal) means middle of the rock. It is a fissure made by a corner of rock splitting off from the main entrance to Edakkal Caves due to some natural causes. The depth of both the cleft and the fissure is 30 ft. What makes it a cave to the ordinary observer is the fact that in the other portion of the large cleft, an enormous rock, weighing several tonnes, has fallen forming a roof over a large part of it. The rock wall contains some interesting carvings, which represent human and animal figures and objects of human use and symbols. These carvings, dating to the Neolithic age (6000 BCE), speak of a highly civilized people of pre-historic age and inspires the archaeologists and historians to rewrite the history of Wayanad and Kerala as a whole. Specifically, look out for the carvings interpreted as the woman with the jug, the sun, the chieftain, the animal, and the peacock. The caves were discovered in 1894 by an English police suprintendent named Fred Fawcett. The story goes that he discovered a hunting axe, which eventually led to the discovery of the caves. However, the caves were taken over by Archeological Survey of India only in 1984, so some vandalism can also be spotted on the walls. A vertical cleft near one of the corners offers a rare view of Wayanad. These caves are said to have been frequented by Jain monks at a later age. The guard at the caves may be ready to help out with information. The caves are accessible now with steep but strong steps. There are excellent views of Wayanad on the way up, and there are a separate set of steps leading down as a faster route. ₹30.00, additional for camera.

Stay safe[edit]
The eastern hills of Kerala are vulnerable to attacks from an Indian communist group called Maoists. They once attacked the ticket counter of Silent Valley National Park, Mukkali.  As the Maoists are armed and dangerous, be careful when you trek in lonely areas.[1]
Leeches are common in the hills. Carry some table salt to dislodge the leeches.
Monkeys can be a nuisance, especially at places like Lakkidi viewpoint. Be careful and keep your car windows closed, and food items hidden.
