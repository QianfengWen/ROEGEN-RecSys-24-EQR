Herne is a city of 156,000 people (2019) in the Ruhr area. Part of the city escaped the extensive bombing that destroyed other Rugr cities in World War II, so there are still many historical buildings, especially in the Herne-Mitte district, many of them from the Wilhelminian era.


Understand[edit]
Europaplatz
Barely an association of hamlets before the mining boom and Industrial Revolution in the Ruhr area of the 19th century, it quickly grew largely due to immigration from other parts of Prussia/Germany before being hit hard by the decline of the Ruhr coal fields after World War II. Today the city is looking for a future beyond coal and steel.
Like the rest of the Ruhr area, Herne rose to prominence through the mining of a high quality coal (known as Steinkohle in German - literally "stone coal") and the metallurgical industries dependent on coal. The last mines in Herne shut down in 1967 and 1978 leaving the town with an unemployment problem only partially mitigated by the presence of various manufacturing industries in the town. The structural problems along with the burden to pay for the maintenance of infrastructure largely built with state and federal funds in "good years" have left Herne financially struggling and in 2012 the municipality was over one billion euros in debt. There has been talks of a federal debt relief program for this and other local governments not only but mostly in NRW, but despite voices of all major parties being in favour of such a move in principle, states like Bavaria whose municipalities are in much better financial shape have thus far (2021) derailed any such attempt coming to fruition.

On foot[edit]
Many destinations in Herne can be reached on foot. In connection with the well-developed local public transport and the possibility of renting bicycles, it is possible to reach the destinations without any problems.

By bike[edit]
Herne is a bicycle-friendly city, even if the cycle path network is not yet satisfactorily developed everywhere, but the city administration is endeavoring to promote bicycle traffic more and to further expand the cycle traffic network. Because of the few inclines, cycling is not strenuous, there are only a few inclines to overcome in the south-eastern part of Herne (Gysenbergpark). Bicycles can be rented from local bike dealers or flexibly at many Metropolradruhr stations. The NRW cycling network offers orientation with its uniform traffic signs.

By public transport[edit]
Local public transport is well developed in Herne and is operated by bus, tram and light rail by the transport companies HCR and BOGESTRA. Buses and trains run through the city almost around the clock. On Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays at night, buses and the U35 run at night.

Herne is connected to the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (VRR). Tickets are therefore valid for all buses and trains. Cross-city journeys are also possible with one ticket.
Tickets can be bought at ticket machines, which can be found in every subway station and at some larger stops. For trips by bus, the ticket can be bought from the bus driver. The customer centre of the HCR (HCR customer centre, Bebelstrasse 8. Open: M-F 09:30-18:00, Sa 09:30-13:30) at the Herne-Mitte stop offers personal advice and the purchase of tickets and timetables.

Herne has two main shopping streets - due to the two formerly independent towns of Herne and Wanne-Eickel.
The main shopping street in Herne is Bahnhofstraße. From Holsterhauser Strasse in the south to Herne Bahnhof, Bahnhofstraße is a pedestrian zone with numerous shops. Side streets such as Behrenstraße are also partly pedestrian zones and offer other, often owner-managed shops and restaurants. In the southern part is the City Centre - one of the first shopping centres close to the city centre, which is now only partially used. In the northern part of the Robert-Brauner-Platz is the listed, former Karstadt department store, which is no longer used today. In addition to everyday goods, you will also find grocery stores, bookshops and other special shops on Bahnhofstraße.
In the Wanne district, the main shopping street is on Hauptstraße. The pedestrian zone in Wanne has been suffering from vacancies and the relocation of shops for years. Attempts are being made to revitalize Wanner city centre by building a large grocery store on Berliner Straße. There is a weekly market on Friedrich-Ebert-Platz every Tuesday and Friday.
