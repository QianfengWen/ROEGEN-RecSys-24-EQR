Rabat (Arabic: الرباط; Berber: ⵕⵕⴱⴰⴹ), literally "Fortified Place", is the capital city of Morocco. The city of Rabat is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.


Understand[edit]
Saint Pierre Cathedral, Rabat Morocco
Rabat is on the Atlantic Ocean at the mouth of the river Bou Regreg. On the facing shore of the river lies Salé, Rabat's bedroom community. Together with Temara the cities account for a combined metropolitan population of 2.6 million. It is an easy-going city by Moroccan standards. 

Rabat visitor information
Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
Rabat is well served by train and you can get frequent connections to most places. Marrakesh is a pleasant 4 hr journey, Fez 2½ hr (if you take one of the new express trains, and 3½ hr on other trains) and Casablanca 1 hr.
There are two stations 34.016-6.83671 Rabat Ville in downtown and 34.0021-6.85562 Rabat Agdal 3 km south of it. There are a tram and a taxi station next to the downtown train station. Some travelers report that trains are frequently delayed by over an hour. Visit OCNF website[dead link] for the timetable.

By bus[edit]
33.9905-6.86753 Gare routière Kamra Rabat (Kamra Rabat Bus Station) (About 5 km southwest of the centre. To get there, take bus #36 from Bab El Had, right at the door of the youth hostel. Or take a grand (shared) taxi from Av. Hassan II, just past the Total petrol station from the corner of the Medina. 5 dirham any option.). The main bus station in Rabat. Poorly maintained. (updated Sep 2019)
33.9869-6.869814 CTM bus station. (updated Feb 2018)
It's possible to get a bus from almost any town in the country to Rabat, but the buses often do not stop at the centre, but instead go through the city. It may be a good idea to use GPS, to ask someone which is the correct stop, or use a decent street map to work out where you are and when to get off. It is easy to miss a central stop and find yourself heading out into the suburbs again, which is not too bad—about a 20-25 dirham ride into downtown.

By plane[edit]
34.051389-6.7513895 Rabat–Salé Airport (RBA  IATA), in the nearby town of Salé. There are flights every day between Rabat and Paris, Brussels and a lot of domestic destinations. However, the most tourist fly into nearby Casablanca and then coming into Rabat by train or coach.   (updated Feb 2018)
Getting there: when exiting the airport, tourists are funnelled towards a group of parked white taxis that quote 100 dirham or more. This is unnecessarily expensive. Instead wait for a petit taxi to arrive (blue for Rabat, cream coloured for neighbouring Salé.) One of these will arrive, dropping someone else off for departure. These run on a meter ("compteur" in French) and will be nearer 30 dirham for the same journey. Stareo buses leave 1 hr after every flight and go to the Rabat Ville train station for 20 dirham.

Get around[edit]

On foot[edit]
If you aren't in a hurry, walking around the area of Centre Ville, Agdal, the University, the Medina, the Ocean/River and the monuments is easy and pleasant. The new Corniche on the river, leading to the Oudaias, has been re-done, and there are expected openings of cafes soon. The route cotiere, or coastal road, past the cemetery and the Oudaias has dramatic ocean-side views, especially charming at sunset.

By tram[edit]
There are two lines between Rabat and Salé. It costs only 6 dirham (Sep 2019) for one use and it works from 06:00-23:00. There is a tram every 10 min during the week and every 20 min during Sunday. One of the stations (Mohammed V - Gare de Rabat) is located exactly just in front of the downtown train station (Gare de Rabat-Ville). It is a good way of getting around. Maps are available in every station.

By taxi[edit]
Petit Taxis, all blue in color, mostly Fiat Uno and Renault Dacia. This inexpensive way to get around town usually won't exceed 25/30 dirham, the minimum fare​ is 5/6 dirham. Be sure to check the meter is running to avoid being over charged at the end of the trip, although this is much less of a problem than in other cities. Don't be surprised if the taxi stops to pick someone else up. Also Uber works in Rabat, but it's 20-30% pricier than regular taxis.
Avoid the Grand Taxis when traveling around Rabat—they are much more expensive and less safe than blue petit taxis.

By bus[edit]
There are now official bus routes listed and bus stops have signs showing at least the bus lines that stop there. Costing 5 dirham (Sep 2019), they are a cheap way to get to know the several layers of Rabat. The buses can be of very variable quality, but it could be worth taking the chance given the cost-saving and experience of what many locals with low income experience. Bus #4 goes from Ocean, to Bab El Had to Avenue Fal Oueld Omair (one of the major streets in the Agdal neighborhood) all the way to its terminus in the upscale and calm new development of Hay Riad. If the bus is crowded watch out for pickpockets.

By car[edit]
Driving around yourself is not recommended. Insurance rates are high and most drivers will avoid hitting you at all costs; however, Morocco does have the second highest rate of car accidents in the world, and most drivers do not abide by the traffic laws. Driving doesn't necessarily mean you are going to have an accident but Moroccans recommend great caution when driving.

See[edit]
Kasbah of the Oudaias
Historic center[edit]
34.0318-6.835821 Kasbah of the Oudaias. The Kasbah is the oldest part of Rabat.

The district is enclosed by old fortifications, including a large and beautiful 12th-century stone gate. Free entrance.   (updated Feb 2018)
Inside the Kasbah
34.02617-6.836252 Old Medina. A UNESCO World Heritage Site filled with atmospheric narrow streets and a sizeable market. It is less crowded and maze-like than the medinas of Fes and Marrakesh, making it easy to explore. (updated Nov 2019)

Both Roman remains and a ruined 14th-century Islamic complex can be visited. You can walk there from the city centre, but it is a long walk. 70 dirham.   (updated Feb 2018)
34.012806-6.83763911 Bab er-Rouah. One of the old city's best medieval gates, located close to downtown and the Royal Palace.

King have performed at Mawazine. There are various scenes around the city.
Football: Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium closed in 2023. A new stadium is under construction and in June/July 2025 will host games in the Africa Cup of Nations.

Buy[edit]
Rue des Consuls an interesting place to wander. This street is so named because foreign diplomats were required to reside here in the seventeenth century until 1912. At that time the main activity of the area was piracy and taking slaves, who were then auctioned. Under a treaty with the Sultan, they were to be redeemed by diplomats from their countries who then had a budget for such purchases. For convenience, these diplomats were thus a few tens of meters from the place of "negotiation". This street was already very active one of the few to be paved. Louis Chenier, the father of the poet Andre Chenier was there representing the King of France from 1768 to 1781. Trading in the redemption of captives was his main activity and he excelled so much that even the Sultan, exhausted, sent him back to France by military force. From the Rue des Consuls, opens a number of alleys housing small shops, enabling craftsmen to maintain their expertise and their art, in often difficult circumstances.
Although the medina here is not as extensive as that of Fez or Marrakesh there are still some bargains to be had. You will find the normal array of babushka shoes, baggy pants, ornate mirrors and plates etc.! Interestingly all the Moroccans can be found in the section of the market that sells imported western style clothing from Asia and all the tourists can be found in the 'traditional' section. The lovely woolen ponchos are well worth a look and the carpet shops near the end of the medina are also very nice.
33.967815-6.8303631 Mega Mall, ☏ +212 5377-57575. 10:00-23:00. A modern mall with many expensive shops, such as Lacoste along with a food court. Also contains amenities such as a bowling alley and an ice-skating rink. (updated Jan 2017)
Eat[edit]
In the centre there are often inexpensive food stalls around the medina, serving delicious fish and salad sandwiches. Especially found right around the perimeter of the Marche Centrale, these places also serve fresh and simple salads, hot bowls of lubia (beans) or lentils, rotisserie chicken, and home-made tagines. There are also lots of stalls selling pancakes and pains au chocolat.

Stay safe[edit]
Rabat is considered a safe city. Just use some common sense: avoid wearing expensive jewellery or looking flashy, do not flash large quantities of cash, and avoid unfamiliar and deserted areas at night. If you walk in the crowded streets of the Medina or use a bus, keep a hand on your pockets. Women should avoid low-cut tops, midriffs, or shorts to avoid harassment (which almost always consists of comments, but nothing physical) although this is less of a problem than in other cities. Don't feel the need to be polite--no Moroccan woman would put up with behaviour like that.

Connect[edit]
Rabat is served by all of the mobile companies that can be found elsewhere in Morocco: Inwi, Orange, and Maroc Telecom. Mobile phones can be bought in any of these store's stands, and most do not run on calling plans. Rather, recharge cards can be bought in corner stores that contain a number to call. When that number is called, the company adds the price of the card to your account's balance. Alternatively, more than one SIM card can be bought and changed in and out of the phone, if users need more than one phone number.

Internet[edit]
Internet access is available in cyber cafes around the city (not in residential neighborhoods though). Service is usually around €0.50 per hr.
You'll find Wi-Fi access in a some places such as Bert's or Megamall food court, usually those labelled a bit "trendy". There is also free WiFi at the Rabat-Ville train station.
Phone companies offer mobile internet services that plug into the USB port of your computer (there are no mac-compatible devices.) These services can be had without signing a contract, and are recharged in the same manner as a telephone.

Tangier lies on the North African coast at the western entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar where the Mediterranean meets the Atlantic Ocean off Cape Spartel. Tangier is a 4-hr journey from Rabat.
Meknes is in the east with a small but navigable medina.
Other places worth visiting on the Northern Atlantic coast are Asilah and Larache.
Salé is on the right bank of the Bou Regreg river, opposite the national capital Rabat. Founded in antiquity as a Phoenician colony, it became a haven for pirates as an independent republic before being incorporated into Morocco. Modern Salé is a more polluted than Rabat, badly planned, and rapidly expanding town because of an important rural exodus. The city is now a large "dormitory town". Most of its influential and wealthy inhabitants moved to Rabat on the other side of the river. There is a bridge, a tram line and a boat (2 dirham) between the two cities.
Skhirat — a small town 28 km away from Rabat, known for its beaches, the area around Skhirat has begun developing and property and land prices have increased greatly.
Casablanca — Morocco's largest and wealthiest city, it hosts headquarters and main industrial facilities for the leading Moroccan and international companies based in Morocco, Casablanca is also the most liberal and progressive of Morocco's cities. However, poverty prevalent in slums on the city's outskirts and an extremely important rural exodus has led to high rates of crime, drug use, prostitution and the rise of Islamism. Casablanca is a mixed bag of Moroccan extremes.
