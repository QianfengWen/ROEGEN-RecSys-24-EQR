Aylesbury is the county town  of Buckinghamshire.


Understand[edit]
Aylesbury Clocktower
The town dates back to the 4th century BC when it was an Iron age hill fort. By Anglo Saxon times it had grown to be a major market town. In 1529 Henry VIII declared the town the town as the county town of Buckinghamshire although, it is thought the decision was more to gain favour with Thomas Boleyn (father of Anne Boleyn) who was owner of Aylesbury Manor. 1603/4 saw the population decimated by plague. The town played a significant role in the Civil War when it was a stronghold for Parliamentarian forces (1642 was the Battle of Aylesbury, won by the Parliamentarians).
Other "claims to fame":

A stronghold for the Parliamentarian forces in the English Civil War (1642 say the Battle of Aylesbury - won by Parliamentarians). Nearby Great Hampden has resulted in John Hampden becoming something of a "local hero"
The Aylesbury duck - breed of domesticated duck bred for meat and appearance although only one breed remains active today.
Great Train Robbery (1963) culprits were tried in Aylesbury Crown Court (1964)
Home to Stoke Mandeville Hospital, which includes one of the world's leading centres for research, treatment, and rehabilitation of spinal injuries. The hospital is even more notable as the birthplace of the Paralympic Games. The UK's National Centre for Disability Sport is located next to the hospital, including an athletics stadium, indoor arenas for court sports and bowls, tennis courts, and a 25-metre swimming pool.
In 2005 the town was selected to be one of 6 "Cycling Demonstration Towns" receiving significant funding to develop cycling and cycle infrastructure in and around the town. As a result of this the town is well served by local cycle routes.
