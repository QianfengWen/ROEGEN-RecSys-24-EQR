Montgomery (Welsh: Trefaldwyn, meaning "Baldwin's town") is a market town in Powys. Montgomery has retained an "unspoilt" feel, with some fine examples of Georgian and early Victorian architecture.


Understand[edit]
As the English name implies, it was historically the county town of Montgomeryshire and as such, was a prosperous community and important political and commercial centre in the 17th-19th centuries. After the mid-19th century it began to be eclipsed as a commercial centre, and subsequently politically, by the nearby Newtown and Welshpool, due to those two towns being located on the River Severn, Montgomery Canal, and Cambrian Railway. 
As of 2011, it was home to 1,300 people.

Get in[edit]
By road[edit]
Montgomery is missed by the major 'A'-road network, lying a few miles to the east of the main A483 Swansea - Chester road, roughly half-way between Welshpool and Newtown.

By rail[edit]
The nearest stations are at Welshpool and Newtown, on the Cambrian line.

By bus[edit]
Local services are provided by Tanat Valley Coaches. Service 71b runs Welshpool-Montgomery-Newtown and service 558 runs from Shrewsbury to Montgomery via Worthen and Chirbury.

Get around[edit]
As a small market town, Montgomery is easy to get around on foot, though the climb up to the castle is quite steep. The best way to explore the surrounding countryside is by bike.

See[edit]
52.560944-3.1466471 St Nicholas Parish Church. The tombs of the Herbert family and stained glass windows are well worth seeing. The church yard offers panoramic views over Shropshire 
52.5625-3.150612 Montgomery Castle. Open Entry. The castle dates back to 1223 and is now an imposing ruin, situated on a hill above the town. Free.   
52.55357-3.1577433 Montgomeryshire War Memorial. Open entry. When it was built in 1923 of white Portland stone, the War Memorial was dedicated to those men of the county of Montgomeryshire who lost their lives in the First World War. It has since been rededicated to those who fell in all past wars. The climb up to the Memorial is well worth the effort as on a clear day it offers a magnificent 360-degree panorama of the surrounding countryside. To the east the Shropshire Hills can be seen very clearly, while to the west, all the major mountain groups of Mid- and North-Wales can be seen, from Pumlumon to the south-west, Cadair Idris to the west, the Arans and Snowdon (over 50 miles away!) to the north-west and the Berwyns in the north. Free. 
52.56067-3.148924 The Old Bell Museum, Arthur Street, SY15 6RA, curator@oldbellmuseum.org.uk. Open W-Su from Easter to the end of September. A 16th-century inn which has been converted into a local history museum by Montgomery Civic Society   
Do[edit]
Cycling is popular in the area. The town lies at the centre of a network of quiet, rolling country lanes. A set of leaflets has been produced showing suggested circular routes from Montgomery. Pick these up from various outlets in the town, or check out the routes on the information board on the side of the Town Hall.
 Offas Dyke Path. This national long-distance footpath runs 177 miles (285 km) from Chepstow in the south to Prestatyn in the north, following the England/Wales border along the course of a mediaeval defensive earthwork. The path passes just to the east of the town. Of course you can just walk a short section of it!
