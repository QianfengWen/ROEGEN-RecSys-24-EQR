Narva is the easternmost city in Estonia, at the Russian border.


Understand[edit]
Hermann Castle
Most of the about 70,000 inhabitants are ethnic Russians. Narva-Jõesuu is a nearby seaside resort at the Gulf of Finland.
The city of Narva was founded by Denmark in the Middle Ages. Narva became part of the Swedish Empire, and during the Great Northern War, Swedish king Charles XII led 10,000 men to victory against more than 30,000 Russian soldiers here.
Due to the heavy damage of the Second World War, Narva had to be almost completely rebuilt. This is why the city is dominated by Soviet architecture today, mostly Krushchevka-type buildings, the quintessential "commie blocks" from the 1960s. Narva's "modern" Town Hall, for example, is a prime example of typical Soviet architecture.
Over 90% of the current population are Russian-speakers, mostly either Soviet-era immigrants from parts of the former Soviet Union and their descendants.
There’s plenty to do in Narva, concerts, annual festivals and open-air shows that take place both in the inner yard of the Narva Castle and elsewhere in the town, such as in the newly-built ice skating stadium.

59.37566528.1959971 Tourist Information Centre, Puškini 13, ☏ +372 3560184, narva@visitestonia.com. M-F 9-18:00, Sa-Su 10-15:00. The staff at the tourist information office on Pushkin street (next to Alexandr Kohvik) can offer plenty of help in fluent English. 
Talk[edit]
Russian is spoken and understood by virtually everyone. If you are able to speak the Russian language, you will be fine. Estonian is spoken as the second language mainly by the younger generation (as learning Estonian at schools became compulsory after Estonia declared independence in 1991). Older people are likely to have zero knowledge of Estonian. English is spoken (or at least understood) by younger people, but the degree of proficiency may vary greatly, so make sure that you can take advantage of locals who understand and speak English as much as possible. Street signs are Estonian-only or in Estonian and English.

Stay safe[edit]
While Estonia is generally very safe, Narva systematically ranks as the country's most dangerous place. Most murders, aggravated assaults, robberies, and car thefts in Estonia occur here.
As in any other Russian majority town, take extreme care if you're dark-skinned. Avoid non-touristic places and stay clear of bars and pubs at all costs, especially at night as skin-heads are known to be active here.
