Ocracoke Island is one of the barrier islands of the Outer Banks of North Carolina. The 16 mi (26 km) of unspoiled beaches and salty ocean breezes offer great opportunities for solitude, serenity, and peace of mind. The expansive vista of ocean and soundfront marsh provides a closeness to nature highlighted with her variety of beach vegetation and bird life. The proximity to the Gulf Stream, and consequent warm southern waters, make for perfect swimming and excellent fishing (gulf stream, surf, and sound). There are also water sports and a colorful history to explore.


Understand[edit]
Rated the #1 beach in America for 2007, the island of Ocracoke abounds in natural pleasures. Ocracoke offers a great medium for quality family time. The slow pace and warm, southern hospitality round out a perfect island vacation; one that insures peace, rest and relaxation.

You can best get around Ocracoke' charming village on foot or by bicycle. There are several places in the village to rent a bike or scooter. Parking spots are rare in town, so it's best not to try to drive around town. Just leave your car in one place and walk the rest of the way. There are sidewalks in the village but they are narrow.

Golf carts are a great way for getting around the village (especially given the narrow streets, 20 mph speed limit, and often scarce parking). They may only be used within the village, i.e. no further than Howard's Pub. Getting to the beach will still likely require a car, or a shuttle, if your lodging provides one. It is possible to take your cart to the end of the village and walk to the nearest pedestrian access point (Ramp 70, next to the airstrip), but those with a lot of beach gear or small children will likely want to make alternate arrangements.
