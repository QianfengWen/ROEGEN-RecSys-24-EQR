Cagayan de Oro, often abbreviated CDO and sometimes just called "Cagayan", is known as the "City of Golden Friendship." It is the capital of the Province of Misamis Oriental and the "Gateway of Northern Mindanao."


Understand[edit]
The city is on the northern coastline of Mindanao in the southern part of the Philippines, with Macajalar Bay to the north, the municipality of Tagoloan to the east, Lanao del Norte to the south, and the municipality of Opol to the west. The Cagayan River splits the city into two, the Poblacion (downtown area) being on the eastern side of the river. CDO serves as the regional center of Northern Mindanao (Region X), and is the region's most populous highly-urbanized city. The 2020 Census showed the city population as 728,400.

Cagayan de Oro has a tropical climate, with the average temperature the whole year round being 28°C (82°F). The highest recorded temperature in the city was 39°C (102°F) in June 1998. Cagayan de Oro receives a relatively even amount of rain throughout the year. The driest month is April, while July is the wettest. The wet season in the city starts in June and ends in November, while the dry season starts in December and ends in May. However, the difference in seasons is not very noticeable in the city; there are sunny and rainy days throughout the year and the rain is usually strong but brief (you will notice the season if hiking or driving on dirt roads in the highlands inland from Cagayan de Oro as it gets muddier). Although the city is also outside the typhoon belt, it has been hit by a few tropical systems, most notably Tropical Storm Sendong (international name Washi) in December 2011.

Religion[edit]
Roman Catholicism is the city's dominant religion, with almost 80% of the population being Roman Catholics. There are also a large number of Seventh Day Adventists, Iglesia ni Cristo, Protestants and Muslims in the city.

Talk[edit]
The main local language is Cebuano (Bisayan); Tagalog and English are also common. Other ethnic dialects in the city include Hiligaynon, Ilonggo, Maranao, and Waray. It is very easy to travel, shop and meet locals using English, especially in shopping malls where there are many other foreigners. English is used for the majority of street and road signs, so you shouldn't have any trouble getting around if you don't understand any Bisaya. However, you might have difficulty conversing with people in the local markets or on public transport in English.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Arrival Area of Laguindingan Airport
8.6125124.4572221 Laguindingan Airport (CGY  IATA) (in Barangay Moog, in the municipality of Laguindingan, 46 km west of Cagayan de Oro and 61 km east of Iligan).   
Laguindingan Airport came into service in 2013, and the old Lumbia Airport in CDO was taken out of service. This new airport serves CDO, Iligan, Northern Mindanao, Lanao del Norte and Bukidnon. Laguindingan sees a mix of Airbus A320 and A321 aircraft, and smaller ATR-72 and Bombardier Dash 8Q-400 turboprops. No flights operated by widebody aircraft take off and land here due to the insufficient runway length at only 2,100m.

Philippine Airlines has daily flights from Manila, Cebu and Davao, and three times weekly flights from Clark.
Cebu Pacific has daily flights from Manila, Cebu, and Davao, as well as weekly flights from Dumaguete, Iloilo, Tagbilaran, and Bacolod.
Philippines AirAsia has daily flights from Manila and Cebu, four times weekly flights from Clark, and three times weekly flights from Iloilo.
When departing, enter the terminal via the entrance located on the ground floor on the right-hand side. There's a ticket inspection with a security guard, baggage scan a metal detector before you even get inside, so be sure to prepare your printed tickets beforehand. Once you're done checking-in, head upstairs either via the escalators or the elevator and head to the second baggage scan and metal detector. After this, you'll find the departures area and a small number of eating places. There are three gates at the airport numbered 1-3 from right to left when you're facing the runway. The airbridge at Gate 1 is not in use, so you'd have to walk on the apron and use the airstairs instead. Fortunately, courtesy umbrellas are handed out.
When arriving and after disembarking the aircraft, either head downstairs or enter the terminal through the double doors found on the right side facing the apron. After entering, you'll see the baggage carousels and eventually the exits leading to the meeters and greeters area.
The airport has an observation deck, but it is closed to the general public.
Although it is sometimes referred to as an "international" airport, as of May 2018 there are no scheduled international flights to Laguindingan. Since its opening, there have been plans for flights to Seoul or Busan in South Korea, but these have not yet come to fruition. There is only one two-story terminal at the airport which easily gets crowded because of its small size.
Magnum Express, LAX Shuttle, Donsal's Express, Odyssey Airport Express, CAGATRANSCO, CDOTRANSCO, and Glorymer Transport operate airport shuttles between Laguindingan Airport to shopping malls (Centrio, Limketkai, Gaisano City, and SM CDO Downtown Premier), Eastbound Bus Terminal, or Divisoria. These usually cost ₱199.
You can catch a bus to CDO instead. Public Utility Vehicles (PUV) operated by CDOTRANSCO go from the airport to the National Highway for ₱20. Afterwards, get a Rural Transit or Super 5 Transport bus traveling along the highway. Rural Transit air-conditioned buses cost ₱85 and ₱65 for non-air conditioned buses. Super 5 Transport can also take you from the airport to the city - first by an airport shuttle to the highway, then on one of their Super 5 buses - for ₱100, including the airport shuttle. Rural Transit and Super 5 buses terminate at the Westbound Bus Terminal.
Take an accredited airport shuttle, with the company's name displayed prominently on their vehicles, and avoid so-called colorum or illegal transport services.
Cagayan de Oro is far from the airport, so allocate more than enough travel time. On an airport shuttle, the journey from the downtown takes between 45 minutes to one hour in good traffic (between the morning and evening rush hours). However if you are traveling during a rush hour or using multiple modes of transportation, be prepared for a longer journey.

The busier and more congested of the two, this is where buses bound for destinations north, south or east of CDO serve. These include buses to Butuan, Surigao, Manila, Bukidnon, Davao, Koronadal, and General Santos. There are also a few (mid/expensive) hotels nearby. You can take jeepneys labelled R2 to Divisoria for ₱8. (updated Aug 2017)
 Westbound Integrated Bus Terminal (Bulua Integrated Bus Terminal), Bulua (near the BIR office and the Bulua Fish Markets). Buses bound for destinations west of CDO, like Iligan, Ozamiz and Zamboanga serve this. (updated Aug 2017)
Common routes:

The distance from Davao to Cagayan de Oro is 277 km, with one bus every 30 min-1 hour. The bus journey takes 7-10 hours depending on the weather and traffic conditions, as well as any road constructions along the way. There are multiple stops including lunch and dinner breaks: ₱432; ₱540 air-con.
A/c bus fare from Butuan is ₱350, and the trip takes 5 hours.
From Iligan, 92 km, ₱120 and 2 hours.
Get around[edit]
8°28′38″N 124°38′38″EMap of Cagayan de Oro
Jeepneys, multicabs, motorelas, taxis, trisikads and sidecars are the main modes of land transportation in Cagayan de Oro. Like other cities in the Philippines, CDO has its own share of traffic problems.  The city experiences significant traffic congestion from 6 am to 8 am in the morning, between 11 am and 2 pm in the noon, and from 5 pm to 8 pm in the evening. These timeframes reflect periods of heightened vehicular activity and commuting, contributing to the traffic issues faced by the city. This is especially evident during Fridays, weekends and holidays, along Claro M. Recto Avenue (where several of the malls are located) and in Divisoria.
To catch public transport in the city, look for a loading/unloading zone indicated by a sign and/or a yellow box on the road. If there are no yellow boxes, avoid waiting close to intersections or No Parking areas.
Public transport during rainy weather can be unreliable. Jeepneys, multicabs, and taxis are few and far between, and those that do turn up are usually either full or can't be bothered to pick up passengers. In these situations you have a few options: wait for an empty jeepney, multicab or taxi with sufficient empty seats available, wait for the rain to stop, or if worst comes to worst, walk to your intended destination. 

By jeepney or multicab[edit]
Jeepneys and multicabs are usually safe during the day and cost only a tenth of a taxi ride. Fares are usually ₱7 for the first 4 km and ₱6 for students and senior citizens, however this does vary depending on the length of the route. It's a common sight to see conductors riding at the rear, not only collecting the fares of the passengers, but also shouting at passersby the destination and/or intermediate stops.
Riding on a jeepney or multicab can be very uncomfortable, especially if you're tall. Not only are the passenger compartments small and claustrophobic, but the drivers would usually want the vehicle to be completely filled with passengers before departing a terminal. To make matters worse, there might even be sacks of rice and farm animals on jeepneys and multicabs that go through the markets.
If they don't take you where you wanted to go, then you can take one to a large hub, where you can continue with another one. Jeepney and multicab routes are displayed at the front, windshield and sides of the vehicles, which makes knowing where to go a lot easier. Try to find a full or nearly-full jeepney, since the driver of an empty one will tend to wait for more passengers. Also, avoid catching one if you're in a rush as it'll take you a long time to reach your intended destination. Catch a taxi - it'll be safer and you'll get to where you want quicker.
At night you may have to be careful with drunks, since robberies do happen. Keep your cellphone and camera in your bag and your bag in your lap. It's best to avoid riding on jeepneys with sound systems; not only might the jeepney driver be playing deafening techno "music," but he might be speeding as well.

By motorela[edit]
Motorelas are essentially motorcycles with a passenger compartment attached at the rear. Like jeepneys, motorelas have a longitudinal seating arrangement, making it more difficult to see where you are going. It was invented in Cagayan de Oro, making them one of the icons of the city. Motorelas are similar to Thailand's tuk-tuks and India's rickshaws, though they can seat seven passengers. They are slow but you don't have to wait long for them to fill with passengers. Motorelas usually travel set routes around Agora, Carmen, and Macasandig, as well as along several streets downtown. The regular fares are usually ₱5 (slightly less for students and senior citizens). However, motorela drivers will give you a custom service for a negotiated price, such as later in the evening when there are very few jeepneys taking commuters home.

By taxi[edit]
Air-conditioned taxis with meters installed can be found all over the city, and many of them can be hailed using either Grab or Hirna. Grab taxis can be easily identified by the green and white Grab stickers on the rear passenger windows. As of June 2018, the taxi flag down rate is ₱40, ₱13.50 per kilometer, and an additional ₱2 every minute. Grab taxis may also include a booking fee on top of the final taxi fare. Taxis have two color codes: white and yellow. White taxis are the most common ones, while yellow taxis, operated by Alphat Airport Taxi, usually transport passengers to and from Laguindingan Airport. However, there are some yellow taxis that aren't airport taxis (Royale Taxi), and some airport taxis pick up passengers in the city. Be careful as these airport taxis charge a flag down rate of ₱70, rather than the regular rate of ₱40.
Do not agree to a flat-rate taxi fare unless you want to pay triple the meter rate: insist on meter only ("meter-plus 50" for an airport or late-night pick up).

By motorcycle[edit]
If you're feeling adventurous, you can use the Angkas motorcycle-hailing service, similar to GrabBike in Indonesia and Vietnam. Motorbike drivers are professionally-trained and passengers are given their own helmet to wear for the journey.
Aside from Angkas, there are also motorcycles for hire that pick up passengers from major intersections in the city late at night and early in the morning, when hardly any other public transport vehicles are going around.

By trisikad or sidecar[edit]
Trisikads, which are pedal-powered tricycles that typically seat between two-four passengers, and sidecars are used in less urban and outlying areas of CDO. Be cautious when travelling on a trisikad or sidecar at night and always ask for the correct change, as the drivers might forget to give you the change (intentionally or unintentionally) upon arrival at your destination.

By bicycle[edit]
Cagayan de Oro is definitely not a bicycle-friendly city. Aside from two short, protected bike lanes along Our Lady of Perpetual Help Avenue in Barangay Patag (outside the Philippine National Police camp) and bike lane signs along the National Highway in Gusa, (although vehicles can regularly be seen parking over it), CDO is pretty much devoid of any real bike lanes. To make matters worse, not many drivers respect cyclists, so you have to constantly watch out for drivers (particularly in SUVs and pick-ups) zigzagging when overtaking slower vehicles, opening their doors to spit or throw garbage, or simply being distracted behind the wheel. And it's not uncommon to see dogs, both strays and with owners, taking over the streets in the evening and early in the morning before sunrise. Some of these dogs have a tendency to bark at or chase cyclists.
The city doesn't have any bike-sharing initiatives, which isn't too surprising seeing how dangerous the roads are. Bicycle racks are very hard to come by, however, you can find two at Centrio Mall - one located next to the Corrales Avenue entrance, with the other one near the LAX Shuttle terminal on Vicente Roa Street.
If you're still keen on cycling, the best time is between sunrise and before the morning rush hour when there aren't many drivers on the road. Try to avoid the main thoroughfares, though secondary roads can also become quite busy. A helmet, lights and reflectors on your bicycle are an absolute must.

By foot[edit]
Like cycling, walking around most parts of the city is not for the faint of heart. Because of the usually hot and humid climate throughout the year, even traveling a short distance by foot is difficult, and is one of the reasons why locals usually prefer to catch public transport instead. Extra precaution should be taken when crossing roads in Cagayan de Oro, as many drivers fail to give way to pedestrians, even if they're crossing at a designated pedestrian crossing.
Exploring the city by foot is also risky due to the lack of decent sidewalks, the presence of vendors occupying them (especially in the markets), not to mention the danger of being sideswiped by reckless drivers. That being said, Don Apolinar Velez St. is one of the walkable roads with adequate sidewalks on both sides, plus it can take you from Vicente de Lara Park to Rodelsa Circle, two popular spots for exercising in the morning. Walking along the city's bridges is also risky because many motorcyclists tend to use the sidewalks as an extra lane during rush hour. This often happens on the four-lane Maharlika Bridge as the footpaths here are lower than on the other bridges. Many streets are poorly-lit, including downtown. Take extra precautions when walking in these areas, especially by yourself.
Navigating one's way through the city can be challenging at times due to the lack of clear and legible street signs. Case in point Barangays Nazareth and Macasandig, where the layout of the streets make the problem even worse.
If you do walk around, having lots of water handy, a good hat and excellent situational awareness are a must. Pedestrian overpasses are very few and far between, although Limketkai Center does have a skywalk which you can use to access almost any point of the complex. Jaywalking is a definite no-no, especially in Divisoria as offenders can be fined ₱1500. However in the rest of CDO, it is very to common to see people crossing anywhere and everywhere, without even checking for any oncoming traffic.

Parks[edit]
Sadly Cagayan de Oro doesn't have any large parks like those found in other countries. However, the parks CDO does have to offer are still worth visiting nonetheless, especially for those wanting to take a break from the noise and chaos of the rest of the city.

Sendong Memorial, Gaston Park
8.47545124.642036 Gaston Park (across from St. Augustine Metropolitan Cathedral and the Archbishop's Palace). A circular park named after Segundo Gaston, a former pre-war Municipal Mayor of Cagayan de Oro, and is a favorite place to unwind for many Kagay-anons, especially during Sundays. This was the site of the first Spanish settlement established in 1622 and was the main plaza during the era, even becoming an execution ground for Spanish criminals. During the Philippine-American War, Gaston Park was a training ground for local soldiers, and on April 7, 1900, became the site of the Battle of Cagayan de Misamis. After World War II, cherry blossoms were planted in the park as a gift from the Japanese Government. In 2000, a National Historial Institute marker, now commonly referred to as the Siete de Abril marker commemorating the battle in 1900, was placed at the park, and this can now be found at its northwest section facing City Hall. There is also another marker donated by the Cagayanons of America, Southern California Chapter, located in front of the Archbishop's Palace. At the southwest corner of Gaston Park across from St. Augustine Metropolitan Cathedral is the Sendong Memorial, dedicated to the victims of Tropical Storm Sendong. The park was renovated in 2015, its worn-out grass being replaced by concrete and pavers. A musical fountain that lights up with different colors was also installed at the park's center. (updated Dec 2018)
8.47598124.640867 Du-aw Kagay-an Park (Duaw Cagayan Park) (underneath the Ysalina Bridge (more commonly known as the Carmen Bridge), on the east bank of the Cagayan River). The park was proposed by Mayor Pablo Magtajas after 120 Kagay-anons returned home from the United States and Canada in August 1987, a year following the end of Martial Law. It is also the place where the Birhen sa Kota sa Cagayan de Oro (Our Blessed Lady of the Holy Rosary) was said to have appeared, saving the early settlement from invaders. Every August during the City Fiesta, the park serves as the endpoint of the fluvial parade, which begins from Macabalan Pier. (updated Jul 2017)
8.47764124.643728 Plaza Divisoria (Golden Frienship Park). It was built in the early 1900s as a town divider (hence the name Divisoria) or fire breaker after a great fire that almost burned down the entire town. The park is dedicated to local and national heroes. (updated Jul 2017)
8.48512124.647919 Vicente de Lara Park (Capitol Park). Situated in front of the Provincial Capitol of Misamis Oriental with age-old mahogany trees that provide a therapeutic canopy for the promenades.

Mapawa Nature Park ideal for horseback riding, biking, zipline and nature trekking.
Cock-Fighting look for the arena along the National Highway in Gusa. The steep-walled concrete arena thunders with hundreds of shouting fans placing bets, as carefully bred and trained roosters in beautiful fighting form do what they're born to do. Warning: seeing these magnificent and spirited creatures transformed into a limp piece of chicken by the flash of a steel blade may make you become a vegetarian. If not, the losing birds are for sale by the kilo and are rumored to have a distinctive flavor.
Videoke coin-operated video karaoke machines found in virtually every roadside bar in and around the city. Don't even come to the Philippines unless you know the words to at least one song you're willing to get up and sing like it's your one big shot at fame. The playlist is extensive (from Beatles to Nirvana with plenty of Bon Jovi and Gloria Gaynor in between) so no excuses.

Shopping malls & supermarkets[edit]
Cagayan de Oro has a plethora of shopping malls and supermarkets catering to all types of shoppers, from cheap and cheerful to upscale. They are a hive of activity during Friday nights, weekends and holidays as family and friends spend quality time together at restaurants or just malling (window shopping and wondering around aimlessly in malls). Most of the malls are  along Claro M. Recto Avenue.

Connect[edit]
Mobile[edit]
Cellular service in urban areas of Cagayan de Oro is generally fine by Philippine standards, as long as you have a 4G LTE smartphone/tablet or pocket WiFi that can take advantage of faster speeds. However the further you are from a cell tower, the weaker the signal will be, especially in mountainous areas. Globe, Smart and TM (Touch Mobile, an MVNO owned by Globe) prepaid LTE SIM cards can be purchased at carrier stores in shopping malls, 7-Eleven outlets, cellphone stores found throughout the city, and even in local neighborhood sari-sari stores. The Globe and Smart prepaid LTE SIMs cost ₱40, while the TM ones are ₱30. More Kagay-anons use either Globe or TM over Smart, and Globe has noticeably faster LTE speeds than Smart. It's another advantage if you have a device compatible with the 700MHz LTE band (which both Globe and Smart support), as it has a longer range and better indoor coverage compared to higher-band frequencies. Phone calls can also get choppy or drop out at times and text messages sometimes take a while to send because of the lack of towers to cope with the large number of subscribers.
Globe and Smart switch off cellular signals - sometimes without prior notice - near areas where events are held for security reasons. These include the Nazareno procession in January and various events as part of the city fiesta in August. However, areas that aren't close to these events regularly don't have cell signals as well. On numerous occasions, the signals only come back hours after the events have ended.

Internet[edit]
Many public places in Cagayan de Oro offer free Wi-Fi connectivity, including shopping malls, cafes, restaurants, as well as parks and government offices. For example, Centrio Mall offers free Wi-Fi access for one hour, while Gaston Park has unlimited Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi speeds are slower during peak times and weekends. There are also some establishments that charge you for using their Wi-Fi, although at a reasonable rate.

Stay safe[edit]
CDO is almost certainly safer than much of Mindanao, but that does not mean it is entirely safe. See the Mindanao article for warnings that apply to the entire region.

Flooding[edit]
Sudden downpours are a regular occurrence; in the wet season, it rains almost every afternoon and evening. Most of CDO is low-lying and flood-prone, even in the uptown areas, and the city lacks an adequate drainage system. Limketkai Center and Claro M. Recto Avenue between the University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines (USTP) and SM CDO Downtown Premier are particularly vulnerable to flooding.
Before going around during the wet season, pay close attention to the weather forecasts on the internet and television, as even a localized thunderstorm can grind the city to a halt.

Pollution[edit]
Air pollution is a worsening problem in Cagayan de Oro. On most days, a thick layer of smog can be seen hanging over the city. Some of the contributing factors include the increasing number of private vehicles on the roads (especially diesel-powered SUVs and pickups), the continuing use of black-belching jeepneys, open burning of garbage such as plastics and tyres, and the use of charcoal or wood for cooking. If you have asthma or other respiratory problems, wearing a good facial mask (preferably an N95 mask) when outdoors is highly recommended.

Power outages[edit]
Blackouts (or brownouts as they're referred to in the Philippines) are an all-too-common occurrence in Cagayan de Oro, especially between March-June. Sometimes these may last just a few minutes; other times for more than half a day. It always pays to have some flashlights and a powerbank handy to charge your devices in case the lights go out. Reliable flashlights can be purchased at hardware stores like ACE Hardware or Handyman, while powerbanks can be found at gadget shops in the malls. Check the website of the Cagayan Electric Power & Light Company (CEPALCO)[dead link] for blackout schedules.

Tap water[edit]
According to the Cagayan de Oro City Water District (COWD), tap water in the city is "safe to drink." Most locals, however, rely on either bottled water or water filtration systems for their drinking needs, as brown sediment can occasionally be seen in the tap water. Many areas in the city experience low water pressure, especially in the mornings, and water supply can be turned off, sometimes without prior notice, due to repairs or other incidents. It's a good idea to check COWD's website regularly for any water interruption announcements, and to stock up on water just in case.

Emergency[edit]
In the event of an emergency, dial 911. 911 calls are not free and are only available to Globe subscribers with at least ₱12 worth of credits.

However, the price of the newspapers can vary from one newspaper seller to another.
