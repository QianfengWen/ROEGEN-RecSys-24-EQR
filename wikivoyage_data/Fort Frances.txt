Understand[edit]
Fort Frances
Fort Frances sits on the international border with the United States where Rainy Lake narrows to become Rainy River. It is connected to International Falls, Minnesota, by the Fort Frances–International Falls International Bridge. The Fort Frances Mill was the main employer in the town until it closed in January 2014.

History[edit]
Fort Frances was the first European settlement west of Lake Superior and was established by French Canadian Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La Vérendrye, first commander of the western district. In 1731 he built Fort Saint Pierre near this spot as support for the fur trade with native peoples. In 1732 his expedition built Fort Saint Charles on Magnuson Island on the west side of Lake of the Woods. After some time, Fort St. Pierre fell out of use.
In 1817, following the War of 1812 and redefinition of borders between Canada and the United States, the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) built a fort here. In 1830 HBC Chief Factor John Dugald Cameron named the fur trading post after Frances Ramsay Simpson, the 18-year-old daughter of a London merchant, who had married earlier that year in London, George Simpson, Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, who would visit the fort many times.
