Both Oakland International Airport (OAK IATA) and San Francisco International Airport (SFO IATA) have Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) stations. Take the Richmond Line to the North Berkeley or El Cerrito Plaza Station. If traveling by car, take the Albany exit (Buchanan Street) from Interstate 80 or Interstate 580.
Because the cities and towns on the eastern shore of the San Francisco Bay all butt up against each other and function as one large metro area, it's likely that you will also visit Albany's neighboring East Bay towns, such as Berkeley, Emeryville, El Cerrito, and Richmond, so much of the information about getting to those places also applies to getting to Albany.
