Torgau is in the north of the German state of Saxony.

Hartenfels Castle

Understand[edit]
Torgau was first mentioned in a document dating from 973. By 1267 it had received the privileges of a town.

Schlosskirche
After the brothers Ernest and Albert had divided the possessions of the House of Wettin in 1485, Prince-Elector Ernest made Torgau his residence. His successor Frederick III (called "Frederick the Wise") was an avid proponent of Protestant Reformation and one of the most important supporters of Martin Luther. The church of Torgau castle was the first newly constructed Lutheran church. Torgau was therefore called the "nurse of Reformation" (while Wittenberg was considered its "mother"). Luther, Melanchthon, Justus Jonas Sr. and Johannes Bugenhagen drafted the Torgau Confession in 1530, some articles of which were later adopted into the Augsburg Confession (the Lutheran Church's primary confession of faith). Luther's wife Katharina von Bora died in Torgau in 1552.
The Kingdom of Saxony lost its northern territories, including Torgau, to Prussia in 1815.

During the last two years of World War II, Torgau was the seat of the Reich's military court where more than 1000 draft dodgers, resistance fighters and prisoners of war (mostly Americans) were executed. In 1944, 45,223 prisoners of war were registered at the Torgau POW camp (Stalag IV D), though most of them did not live at the camp but were detached to various labour battalions in the region. At the end of the war, on 25 April 1945, Torgau received international prominence as the place where Soviet troops from the east and US troops from the west first met (more accurately, the meeting took place in Strehla, 30 km south of Torgau), marking the merger of Western and Eastern front and the imminent collapse of German defense. The anniversary of the historic event is celebrated as Elbe Day.
After the war, Torgau became part of the state of Saxony-Anhalt, but the East German authorities dissolved all states a few years later, assigning Torgau to the Leipzig district. Since German unification, the town of some 20,000 inhabitants again belongs to the state of Saxony.

Get in[edit]
The closest airport is Leipzig/Halle (LEJ IATA), about 60 km west of Torgau. Trains take you to Torgau in one and a half hour (change at Leipzig main station), a taxi costs about €100.
Torgau is reached by half-hourly local trains from Leipzig in 50 minutes and by two-hourly regional trains from Cottbus in 65 minutes. Travellers arriving from further-away places have to transfer either in Leipzig or in Falkenberg (Elster). From Wittenberg you will need a good hour by train, from Dresden or Berlin more than two hours.
Torgau is located on the Elbe Radweg (River Elbe cycle route), so a convenient way to get here is by bike.
