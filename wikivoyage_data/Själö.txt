Seilihospital
Själö (Finnish: Seili), is an island in the Archipelago Sea about 30 km southwest from Turku. It is famous for being a former leprosy colony and a fairly popular day-trip destination during summer season.
The island was part of the Nagu municipality, now part of Pargas. It has long been a popular destination, but opened for more organized tourism in 2017.


Understand[edit]
The name Själö has a grim sound to any locals. The island had probably been inhabited by seal hunters as the Swedish name suggests ("själö" means "seal island"). In 1619 King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden ordered a leper colony to be established on this island. As the island was virtually treeless until the late 1800s, anyone who was sent to Själö had to bring coffin materials with him/her. As the patients had right to make moonshine for medical purposes, they willingly sold it to the sailors of passing ships. This produced still living expression "olla seilissä" or 'to be on seili' for drunkness to the Finnish vocabulary. The last leper patient died in 1787.


The dark history of the island continued as the island became a mental hospital. Authorities had started to send (allegedly) mentally ill people to Själö already in the 1680s. Probably there was some just poor or physically disabled among them. In the 1850s the current mental hospital building was accomplished and replaced old wooden crofts. In 1889 Själö turned into mental hospital for women only but the idea remained the same: it was not to cure the patients but to ensure they  would stay outside the society forever. This was easy as the asylum was virtually self-sufficient. The doctors and other medical staff got households and farmlands from the island for free but were also free to visit outside the island. The mental institution was operational until 1962 when the last patients were finally moved to mainland. The dreadful story came to an end.
Since 1964 the University of Turku has operated the Archipelago Research Institute in the former mental hospital. In addition there are some permanent residents, mostly relatives of former hospital staff, living in their family estates. 
The island was opened for more organised tourism in 2017, with restaurant and lodging. The whole hospital area, surrounding farmland as well as the church and its graveyard are included in the Finnish list of nationally significant built cultural environments. The rest of the island belongs to the Pakinainen-Seili nature conservation area which is on the Natura 2000 list.
Finnish pop singer Jenni Vartiainen named an album after the island.

Get in[edit]
The only option to get to the island (when the sea isn't frozen) is by boat. In summer there are daily connections from Turku, Nagu (Kyrkbacken), and Rymättylä (either Hanka or Röölä, the latter with Föli bus connections from Turku via Naantali also in summer). There is also a harbour for those coming by private vessels. The easiest way to visit from Turku is taking a return cruise with m/s Norrskär. Most of the ferries call in Kyrkbacken, which is reachable by coach from Turku or otherwise along the Archipelago Trail. In winter the ferry on Nagu northern route calls at the island.
Although some of the ferries take cars, you can not land with one. Bikes are OK.
