Venice, also sometimes referred to as Venice Beach, is a district of Los Angeles in Southern California.  Its colorful Boardwalk is a great scene:  free, fun, and funky, making the "short list" of things to do in Los Angeles.


Understand[edit]
Venice Canals
Venice was the creation and dream of one man, Abbot Kinney.  Kinney was an investor who built a sort of recreation of Venice, Italy including a massive system of canals and a huge entertainment complex that opened in 1905 and became very popular.
The overly ambitious canals were mostly filled and made into streets in 1929.  A few of the canals survive and are lined with funky, expensive, and architecturally diverse urban homes.  A stroll along a couple of the remaining streets is a lesson in architectural eclecticism.
Kinney's huge Pacific Ocean Park entertainment complex survived until the mid-1960s, eventually succumbing to competition from Disneyland and others.  The spirit of his seaside entertainment complex however, still pulses in Venice's captivating Boardwalk.
In the 1950s and '60s, Venice became a center for the Beat generation. There was an explosion of poetry and art. Major participants included Stuart Perkoff, John Thomas, Frank T. Rios, Tony Scibella, Lawrence Lipton, John Haag, Saul White, and Philomene Long. Jim Morrison of The Doors also lived in Venice and wrote much of his poetry and song lyrics here.
In the late '60s, Venice became a center for radical activism, including a Black Panther chapter, a Free Venice (from Los Angeles) movement and many other activities opposing various urban renewal plans. Venice, today, is a community in the throes of gentrification but maintains a strong identity and progressive political posture.
More than one hundred years after Kinney's debut, Venice remains unique and well worth the visit.

Get in[edit]
Driving from Los Angeles International Airport, take Lincoln Boulevard (CA-1) north and turn left on Venice Boulevard.
Taking a public bus from LAX to Venice is quite simple; take a free shuttle to the LAX Transit Center then board a #3 Santa Monica Blue Bus, north; ask for an interagency transfer.  Get off at Washington Blvd. and at the NW corner of Lincoln and Washington take the Culver City Bus #1, west.  Get off at Pacific and Windward; you are now in the heart of Venice Beach and Ocean Front Walk.

Get around[edit]
33°59′27″N 118°27′36″WMap of Venice (California)

Venice itself is pretty much small enough to walk in, especially along the beach. You can hit more inland areas of Venice by car, bike, or on Metro bus lines.

See[edit]
33.98426-118.466311 Canals. Venice's canals (complete with ducks) are home to some of LA's most eclectic residential architecture. See tiny bohemian cottages next to million-dollar ultra-modern houses. The canal streets are between Washington Blvd. and Venice Blvd; park on Dell to access.   
33.99116-118.468172 Abbot Kinney. The Abbot Kinney district (the area along Abbot Kinney Boulevard) runs for about 1.5 mi (2.4 km) between Main St. and Washington Blvd. The area is a hotspot for artists and hipsters and includes numerous shops, restaurants and bars including several excellent art galleries, about a half-dozen interesting clothing boutiques and over a dozen cafes and eateries. Named for the developer who originally created the "Venice of America", the area holds an annual festival featuring music and art. 
33.9897-118.476073 Ocean Front Walk (Venice Boardwalk Assc.) (between Washington Bvld. & Navy). Venice's Ocean Front Walk runs between Washington Blvd. to Navy. Along the walk you will find an assortment of retailers, from tourist souvenir shops, bike rental outlets, arts and crafts booths, restaurants and "snack shacks" for dishes from around the world to hot dogs and corn dogs, ice cream, coffees and smoothies. You'll find henna tattoo artists, chair massages practitioners, fortune tellers and more. Of course, sit at one of the ocean-side restaurants to watch the parade of people go by. 
Do[edit]
33.986437-118.4753821 Venice Beach. One of the LA area's more popular beaches, including the infamous Muscle Beach which the city has set up as an outdoor weightlifting gym for the local hulks. People watching along Venice Beach is something to put on your "things to do before you die" list. Think of the scene as a Bohemian-Mardi Gras-Beach Blanket Bingo-Circus. If that doesn't make any sense, well neither does Venice and that's the charm. Every summer day and every weekend, join the parade of humanity strolling amongst amazing and bizarre street performers, obscenely bulging body builders (at Muscle Beach), eclectic shops and street vendors, panhandlers, and beautiful, scantily clad, people desperately seeking attention. Go ahead and stare at it all. That's the point. Walking is fine but if you like to bike there is a great path along the beach. There are many places to rent bikes. However, you cannot ride them on the pedestrian street. During the summer months Muscle Beach hosts various bodybuilding and figure contest, including the Venice Championships (Memorial Day Weekend and early September ) and Mr. & Ms. Muscle Beach (July 4th).   
33.9776-118.469312 Venice Pier (End of Washington). Venice Pier offers parking, fishing and access to the beach below. Just before the Pier on Washington Blvd., there are numerous restaruants for fine dining or a quick bite, and great places for an evening of drinking. Plus, there are numerous shops for all your beach needs -- from swim suits and sunglasses, to sunscreen and sweatshirts.  
Events[edit]
 Venice Canal Holiday Boat Parade. usually the second Sunday of the month of December. Residents of the canals decorate small (and sometimes homemade), non-motorized boats and punt or row down the canals in their finest—and funnest—holiday decor, brilliantly lit and costumed. There is a flair for the dramatic, so expect to see anything from a floating Starship Enterprise to a Viking longboat traversing the narrow waterway. 
 Venice Penguin Swim Club. Annually on January 1. The annual "Chilly" Swim is held at noon off the beach north of Venice Blvd. and south of Windward Ave. 
 Venice Annual Art Walk. mid-May. Held in the Abbot Kinney area, and benefiting a local charity.

Buy[edit]
Abbot Kinney Blvd. reflects the neighborhood's funky feel with eclectic shops, artist galleries, one-of-a-kind clothing and more.  There are also many local artisans and craftsmen at Venice Beach along the Ocean Front Walk.  Items range from tourist items, handmade jewelry, spoon art and bottle art (which is really cool) to bongs made out of beer cans.

33.987902-118.4743451 Small World Books, 1407 Ocean Front Walk. 10AM–8PM daily. Medium-sized bookstore. Lots of interesting books, and the peace and quiet makes a nice break from the high-energy beach scene outside. (updated Jul 2023)
