54.609324.02953 Central Park is wooded and dotted with sculptures.
Druskupis at the east edge of the park (corner of Algirdo and Kęstučio) is a sort-of art installation and naturopathic air-conditioning unit. In summer, mineral water trickles down through the structure and evaporates, creating "sea air" with all sorts of claimed benefits. (After all, no-one in Klaipėda or Palanga ever got sick.) It's best seen at dusk as it's lit in fancy colours.
54.597124.03464 Vytautas Hill is a 40 m hillock south edge of town with views, and a ski slope in winter. It was initially defensive then Vytautus the Great (1350-1430) had a hunting lodge here, but nothing remains of any of this. A sturdy statue of Vytautas on horseback stands at the foot of the hillock.
54.603624.01285 Observation Tower is 55 m tall with a viewing deck at 45 m, and 300 steps to climb. It's accessible free in daylight hours.
Do[edit]
Ascent of Vytautas Hill
Promenade: the riverside path is paved and suitable for walking or cycling.
Boat trips: in summer pleasure boats potter along the river to nowhere in particular. The ferry boat is also available for group hire between shuttles.
You can launch your own boat from the ramp north side of the village.
Birutės Vila by the ferry pier is a free pavilion where you can lounge awhile listening to the fountains and watching the clouds chase over the glass roof. It's open all year daily 10:00-18:00.
Kneipp Garden is at Sruogos 2B in front of St Antony's Church, and here you're supposed to practice "body hardening". Sebastian Kneipp (1821-97) was a Bavarian priest and early exponent of naturopathy, a mixture of commonsense, pagan ritual and hocus-pocus. You're supposed to sit in cold water then parade around the paved area in bare feet; the feeling of wellbeing when you quit is matched only by that from ceasing banging your head against a brick wall. Dogs are allowed in the garden but it's unclear if they're supposed to benefit from padding around barefoot.
Spas and Sanatoria each have their own take on these belief systems. Those active in town nowadays are Eglė at Algirdo g 14, Tulpė at Sruogos g 4A, Versmė at Sruogos g 9, and Vytautas Mineral Spa (aka Ego Spa) at Barbaros 2.
Jazz Festival is held in March / April in even-numbered years.

Drink[edit]
Mineral water can be slurped free at town drinking fountains or bought in commercial bottled drinks. It's high in sodium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, sulphate and bicarbonate, to about 7 grams per litre. That's a fifth of the salt content of sea water so it's drinkable, but will finish off infants, small dogs and anyone with heart failure if consumed regularly. The bottling companies also sell lower-strength and carbonated / still varieties, which are almost as healthy as tap water.
