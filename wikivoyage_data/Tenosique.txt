Tenosique is a small city of about 35,000 inhabitants (2020) in the Mexican state of Tabasco. It is best known as the source of a traditional dance called el Pocho. Tenosique is the home town of Pino Suarez, hero of the Mexican Revolution and a former vice-president of Mexico. It is a riverfront town on the banks of the Usumacinta River.

Understand[edit]
Like many Mexican cities, Tenosique has an overly pompous long name that nobody but government officials actually uses. The long official name is Tenosique de Pino Suárez. 

El Pocho[edit]
El Pocho is a traditional Mexican dance that is iconic of the state of Tabasco. Tenosique is the town that preserves the tradition, which dates back far before the time of the Spanish conquest. El Pocho is performed by a complex cast of costumed characters who play out a timeless story of good vs. evil. By the end of the dance, el Pocho (the evil God) is vanquished. The dance is performed annually from January 20 (Day of St Sebastian) until Shrove Tuesday.

By train[edit]

By car[edit]
Tenosique is 215 km east of Villahermosa, capital of the state of Tabasco.
From Villahermosa, take federal highway MEX-186 (Carr. Villahermosa - Escarcega) until the km 147 marker, where you'll find the junction with federal highway MEX-203 (Carr. Emiliano Zapata - Tenosique). Take MEX-203 for 75 km and you'll reach Tenosique.

Get around[edit]
The town itself is compact and easily explored on foot, but most travelers will likely arrive by train and want to visit the Maya sites so a taxi is the best option. There are also moto-taxis that are an inexpensive (and fun) way to get around. You can flag one down on the streets, or you'll likely find them near the Malecon or the Tren Maya station.

Tenosique is not a touristic city, but it has great potential. Travelers with an interest in archaeology may be interested in two well-explored and documented Mayan sites that are within the municipality of Tenosique. Both are maintained and operated by INAH. (There's a third site called Panhale that is not yet open to the public).

17.487748-91.5697241 Pomona Archaeological Zone (Pakbul) (Carretera federal MEX-203 Emiliano Zapata-Tenosique a la altura del kilómetro 47+920), ☏ +52 993 352 1022. Daily 08:00 - 17:00. Small Maya site with several pyramids and other well-restored structures. Climbing the pyramids is still allowed at this site. It's a beautifully maintained site in a natural setting with colonies of monkeys living in the trees around it. The site museum has a number of artifacts recovered from the site. Bring water, snacks, hat, and mosquito repellant because there's no store nearby.

Do[edit]
There's not much to do in Tenosique other than walk along the Malecon or go fishing on the river. 

17.477486-91.4274081 Malecon, Malecon, Centro. The Malecon is a pleasant downtown area where you can walk along the riverfront, pose for selfies in front of the town's letters, or stop to admire their mural. Boats can be hired for a sightseeing ride on the river. 
Festivals[edit]
Carnaval de Tenosique - January-February: The Tenosique Carnival is a much bigger event than the town's small size would seem to indicate. The reason for its outsize popularity is that it's a historic Carnaval that preserves Prehispanic traditions and Mexicans often travel great distances to see the throwing of flour and the traditional Danza de Pocho, a folkloric dance performed nowhere else with the authority and authenticity of the Tenosique performers. Hotel rooms are typically booked a year or more in advance for the Carnaval season.
