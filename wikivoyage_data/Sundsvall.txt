Sundsvall is the seat of Västernorrland County, and the only city in the Medelpad province of Sweden. The city's population is about 51,000 (2010), but including suburbs, the total is close to 100,000. It is in a hilly area by the coast and its main industries are pulp and paper factories, sawmills, aluminium smelting, and hydroelectric power generation. Sundsvall also houses a campus of the Mittuniversitetet (Mid Sweden University), which gained university status in 2005.


Understand[edit]
The wooden city was repeatedly destroyed by fire, so after the great fire of 1888 it was rebuilt as a Stenstaden - a stone city. Sundsvall was prosperous at the time, so the central area was rebuilt in art nouveau style, with grand city blocks and lavish exteriors. Most sites of interest are in this central area, including the 62.39032517.3065491 Tourist Information Bureau (Sundsvalls turistbyrå), Stora Torget, ☏ +46 60-658 58 00, info@visitsundsvall.se. M–F 11:00–18:00; Sa 11:00–15:00. (updated May 2018)
