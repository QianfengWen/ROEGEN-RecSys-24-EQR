Leek is a town in North Staffordshire in the English Midlands.


Understand[edit]
Known at the Queen of the Moorlands, Leek is the administrative centre of Staffordshire Moorlands District Council. The main industry was silk and textiles, but it has now diversified into tourism and food processing.

Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
Leek's train station closed in the 1960s so the only real public transport option is the bus. 
There are occasional services to Buxton but the most practical option for most visitors is the number 18 bus from Hanley bus station in Stoke-on-Trent (£2 one way, £8.50 for unlimited travel on First Potteries buses all day). This runs once an hour via Stockton Brook, Endon and Longsdon, during the day and runs until just after 6PM. Very limited Sunday service is run by D&G.  
The D&G 16, runs from Stoke (Hanley bus station) via Cheddleton and Werrington, roughly twice an hour M-Sa 7AM-8PM. single fare £2, day ticket £3.50 (Feb 2024).
There is an Aimees 109 service every two hours from Macclesfield. No Sunday service and finishes early on a Saturday.

By train[edit]
Plans are being considered to reintroduce train links into town. Nearest useful stations are at Stoke on Trent & Macclesfield.

Buy[edit]
There is plenty to buy in Leek.  There is a market, indoor and outdoor, on Wednesdays and Saturdays in, as you'd expect, the market place - although the quality of the goods on sale varies wildly.
Leek also considers itself a great place to purchase antiques and as much there are numerous antique shops - many of these are clustered on and around St Edwards street and parts of Cheddleton Road.
For day to day needs, Leek has the usual array of supermarkets - Morrison's is on Newcastle Road.  There is a small Asda near Haregate, as well as an Aldi, which is closest to the town centre on Haywood street; however, there have been issues involving unfair fines being issued in their car park.

Eat[edit]
Leek isn't renowned for its culinary delights but many options do exist.  There are a series of the usual Indian and Chinese restaurants throughout the town, as well as the ubiquitous takeaways you'd find in any English town.  In addition, many pubs now serve food as well.

Drink[edit]
Leek once boasted the most pubs per capita in the whole of England.  Unfortunately economic circumstances have resulted in many of these closing down, the following are all open as of October 2010 (there are more pubs, but these are the highlights).  Most of the pubs are centred around St Edwards street, while the bars are largely around the market place.

Stay safe[edit]
Leek is a relatively safe town with little crime.  On Friday and Saturday nights the usual drunken chaos occurs, which is to be expected in any English town.  There are occasional fights in the Market Place or in the Elmos bar, but these are usually quickly broken up.  In addition most are between people who already know each other.  There are sometimes large groups of young people hanging around in the evening, but 99% of the time if you leave them alone they'll leave you alone.
