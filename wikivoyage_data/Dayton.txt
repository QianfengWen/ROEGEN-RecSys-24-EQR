Flyover is a sculpture that retraces the path of the Wright Brothers' first powered airplane flight--located in downtown Dayton.
Dayton is a city of about 141,000 (2016) in the Miami - Scioto basins in Ohio. It is the center of the Dayton-Springfield-Sidney, Ohio metro area with a population of 1,075,000 (2016).


Understand[edit]
Dayton is known as the Gem City and it's no wonder.  In addition to being the birthplace of aviation (the Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur, lived here and perfected their design for the first practical aircraft), it is also home to one of the few multi-site National Parks in the U.S.- the Dayton Aviation Heritage Park. There are several things to do and see in the city and its suburbs.

Climate[edit]
Dayton has a humid continental climate, which means, like the rest of Ohio, that it sees four very distinct seasons.

Winter
being situated in the Midwest, winters are cold.  Snowfall isn't particularly excessive; but it can at times fall at a rate that will cause havoc with traffic.
Spring
often cool, with cold and mild days sprinkled throughout the period.  Storms during this period may produce tornadoes.
Summer
characteristically hot and humid.  While the thermometer may read one number in the summer, it will often feel hotter due to humidity.
Autumn
Autumn in Dayton and Southwest Ohio is usually cool, but an extension of summer-like days into this season is possible. Storms seem to increase during this season too, which, due to the fluctuation of temperatures can produce extremely dangerous storms with the potential of producing tornadoes late into the year.

39.9025-84.2194441 James M. Cox Dayton International Airport (DAY  IATA), 3600 Terminal Dr (Vandalia), ☏ +1 937-454-8200. James M. Cox Dayton International Airport (DAY, KDAY) is in the northern part of the metropolitan area. Nonstop service is available from Atlanta, Baltimore, Charlotte, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Minneapolis, Newark, New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. (IAD and DCA). Dayton is the nation's number one 90-minute air market, meaning the city can be reached in 90 minutes or less by 55 percent of the population. A surprising and very nice feature is free Wi-Fi, which can be accessed under the name of "public" in the airport. Before August 2013, there was no public bus service going to the airport, which made Dayton International Airport the second-busiest airport in the continental United States without a public transportation option. Today, the local busing authority, the RTA, offers service three times daily on Route 43. Cabs from the downtown area to the airport cost at least $30.   (updated May 2018)
By car[edit]
Interstates 70 and 75, major cross-country routes, meet just north of Dayton near the airport, making Dayton easily accessible by car from almost anywhere in the region.
I-75 runs from north to south through downtown Dayton.  Dayton is less than one hour from Cincinnati and about two and a half hours from Toledo on this road.
I-70 runs east to west across the northern part of the Dayton area.  To the west, Indianapolis is about two hours away; to the east, Columbus is about one hour away.
I-675 is an eastern interstate by-pass for Dayton that connects with I-70 at the north end and I-75 at the south end.
U.S. 35 is another important expressway, providing access primarily from places to the east and southeast.  The road has been improved to a limited-access freeway as far east as Chillicothe, making Charleston, West Virginia 4 hours away to the south and east.
By bus[edit]
Greyhound operates a few long-distance buses to Dayton. The bus station is unfortunately located far out in the suburbs with limited local bus connections.

Get around[edit]
