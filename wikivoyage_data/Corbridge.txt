Corbridge is a village in the Tyne valley of Northumberland, 16 miles west of Newcastle and 4 miles east of Hexham. It's an attractive small place and the main reasons to visit are to see the Roman town of Coria, and to explore Hadrian's Wall further north. In 2021 Corbridge had a population of 2888.

Corbridge is 16 miles west of Newcastle upon Tyne and 4 miles east of Hexham. It lies just off the A69 Newcastle to Carlisle road, a fast dual carriageway. This crosses coast-to-coast at low altitude, so it stays open when other routes such as A66 are blocked. It's not motorway and cyclists may use it, but they will feel safer using loops of the former main road. 
A68 is a scenic and fairly fast route from Darlington to Corbridge, where it joins A69 for a couple of miles before continuing north to Jedburgh and Edinburgh. It follows the straight line of the Roman road Dere Street, with switchback progress up hill down dale, punctuated by blind crests and occasional tight bends.

Get around[edit]
The town is compact and walkable. You need wheels for Aydon Castle and Hadrian's Wall.
Executive Taxis are on +44 1434 605601. There are others based in Hexham.

See[edit]
The Roman town of Coria
54.9745-2.01981 St Andrews Church is central in town. The church was first erected by monks of Hexham Abbey in 676 AD and some Saxon components remain, plus a hotchpotch of later styles. It's Anglican and generally open in daylight hours.
Vicar's Pele in the northeast corner of the churchyard is a three-storey defensive pele tower of 1318 that doubled as the vicarage, and is now a pub and wedding venue.
54.9722-2.01882 The Tyne bridge was built in 1674 to replace that of 1235. It's a graceful seven-arch span, widened in 1881, which carried the A68 until this was re-routed onto A69 Hexham Bypass.
54.9785-2.02863 Corbridge Roman Town, Corchester Lane NE45 5NT, ☏ +44 370 333 1181. Weekends 10AM-4PM. The first Roman fort here was built in 84 AD as they pushed north against the Picts. It burned down in 105 AD so a second was built, guarding the river crossing. In 122 AD Hadrian's Wall was built 3 miles north and Coria for a time was a barracks, then the troops were re-located along this largely peaceful frontier and it transitioned into a civilian town. It may have been occupied for a time by the Saxons after the Romans left, but they eventually settled on the site of the present town. You explore along the High Street, the Roman highway of Stanegate, with granaries, temples, workshops and markets. The museum holds a fascinating collection of artefacts, notably the lion grave-marker and a suit of Roman armour, but the finely-worked silver "Lanx" or tray is now in the British Museum. Adult £10, child £6, concessions £9.   (updated Feb 2024)
54.9817-2.01384 Old Potteries are two large kilns, reached by strolling up Milkwell Lane.
54.992-1.99835 Aydon Castle, off Aydon Road NE45 5PJ, ☏ +44 1434 632450. Apr-Oct: W-Su 10AM-5PM. Substantial 13th-century mansion, retro-fitted as a defensive tower when the threat from Scotland grew. It withstood two assaults but was captured and wrecked in 1315. Later owners could only afford minor repairs and from the 17th century it was a farmhouse, but in the late 20th century it was restored by English Heritage. Adults £8.50, child £4.50, concessions £7.50.   (updated Feb 2023)
