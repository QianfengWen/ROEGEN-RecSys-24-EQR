By plane[edit]
-35.897778150.1444441 Moruya Airport (MYA  IATA). Rex flies between Moruya and Sydney daily. The airport is absolute beachfront, and the approach and descent is very scenic. The airport is one of only two airports on the NSW South Coast that have scheduled services, the other being at Merimbula. This airport is the closest to Batemans Bay.   
A hire car (arrange before you arrive) can be collected at the airport. Hertz have an office, and others make arrangements. Taxis also operate to the airport.
From the airport it's a very short walk to the sand of an unpatrolled beach and the neighbouring campground. Or to walk out along breakwater at Moruya Heads. It's a bit far to walk into town, and there is no real pedestrian amenity to do so. You can walk the full length of the beach to the town of Broulee. The walk will take around 90 minutes, and there is food and accommodation there.
