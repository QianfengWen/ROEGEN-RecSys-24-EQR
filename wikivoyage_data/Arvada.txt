History[edit]
The first documented discovery of gold in the Rocky Mountain region occurred on June 22, 1850, when Lewis Ralston, a Georgia prospector headed for the California gold fields, dipped his sluice pan into a small stream near its mouth at Clear Creek. Ralston found about 1/4 ounce (6 g) of gold, then worth about five dollars. Ralston's companions named the stream Ralston's Creek in his honor, but the party left the next morning, drawn by the lure of California gold.
In 1859, Ralston returned with another group of prospectors to the site of his first discovery. The placer gold in the area soon played out, but hard rock deposits of gold were found in the mountains to the west. Some of the miners abandoned their search for gold and returned to farm the rich bottom land along Ralston Creek and Clear Creek. They found an eager market for their crops among other gold seekers.
In the summer of 1870, the  Colorado Central Railroad laid tracks through the area, and on December 1, 1870, the town of Ralston Point was platted, soon renamed Arvada. Arvada thrived as a farming community, and in the mid-twentieth century, evolved into a residential suburb of the state capital of Denver.
Arvada is a part of the Denver Metropolitan Area (2020 population 3,623,560) and the more extensive Front Range Urban Corridor (2020 population 5,055,344). Residents of Arvada have included Clive Cussler, Roy Halladay, Joe King, Karl Rove, Isaac Slade, and Babe Didrikson Zaharias.
