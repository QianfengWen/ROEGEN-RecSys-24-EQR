Tralee is the county town of County Kerry in southwest Ireland, with a population of 23,691 in 2016. Its Irish name Trá Lí means "strand / beach on the River Lee". 


Understand[edit]
Tralee town centre
Tralee is north of Kerry's tourist circuit so it feels like a real town; it's on the edge of the commuter belt for Limerick. It grew up at the lowest point you could cross the River Lee, and its navigable channel made it an early colony of the Normans. They embellished it in their usual way, with an abbey, a castle, and overmighty barons who fell foul of London authority.  In these parts the barons were Earls of Desmond, and the last of that ilk was seen in Cork in 1583, minus his head which was on a spike on London Bridge.
Tralee in its present form was laid out in the 19th century in Georgian style. The castle had already been demolished, with Denny St built over it and the area converted to Town Park, while elegant civic buildings sprang up such as the courthouse. But it declined as a port, as vessels grew larger and the estuary silted up. The ship canal was built in fits and starts from 1832 to 1846, nicely in time to succumb in turn to silting, so the harbour moved to deeper water at Fenit Island in the 1880s.
This means that Tralee hasn't had much industry or tourist development, and has preserved the feel of a provincial market town. As the county town it has business accommodation and amenities. The Tourist Information Centre is within the Kerry Museum on Town Park, same hours.

Plus temporary exhibitions. Adult €6, child free. (updated Apr 2021)
Town Park by the museum is a pleasant open space, especially when the roses are in bloom.
Churches: St John the Evangelist on Ashe St is Church of Ireland, while St John's RC church is on Castle St. Holy Cross is the Dominican church on Princes' St.
The Courthouse on Ashe St still houses the courts. It was completed in 1834 in neo-classical style, and later embellished by two cannon used in the Crimean War (1854–56) and the Indian Rebellion (1857).
Ratass Church is a medieval ruin on R875 north side of town. Its oldest parts are 10th century, built over the Iron Age Rath Mhaighe Teas, "fort of the southern plain". In the graveyard, a 6th century Ogham stone was found incorporated into a burial vault. It's inscribed for "Sílán son of Fáithloga".
52.256-9.7362 Blennerville was the port until 1846, where many emigrants left for North America; then a canal was cut to Tralee town centre. There's a restored windmill with an exhibition on the emigration years and a model railway. The area is good for birdwatching and breezy walks along the river and canal.
Further out[edit]
52.277-9.8583 Fenit is a picturesque harbour 10 km west of Tralee, which until the 19th century was a major port. In 1588 the Spanish Armada sloop Nuestra Señora del Socorro surrendered here, unable to limp home. The crew were all put to death - a rattled London government had given local sheriffs strict instructions.
Fenit Island is reached by walking or driving across the sand bar north of Fenit village. It's populated, with a ruined castle, and it's claimed that St Brendan the Navigator (484-577) was born here.
Ardfert Cathedral

52.358-9.8375 Banna Strand is a long beach with sandhills 12 km northwest of Tralee. This is where Roger Casement and two others were captured in April 1916, having been put ashore from a U-boat. Germany had sent arms to support a republican uprising, but the arms ship was captured by the Royal Navy, and scuttled off Cobh. Casement had also been involved in recruiting Irishmen within Germany (such as POWs) to fight against Britain, and he was hanged for treason.
Akeragh is another long sandy strip north of Banna.
52.413-9.9446 Kerry Head is the headland south of the Shannon estuary, with Ballyheigue the main settlement.
52.2307-9.46477 Castleisland  has been described as "not so much a town as a street between two fields". The island was created when a moat was built around the castle, of which only a crumbling tower remains. The main attraction is Crag Cave 2 km northeast, almost 4 km long, of which you tour 350 m.
