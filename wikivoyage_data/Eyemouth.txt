Eyemouth is a small town of 3,600 people (2020) in the Scottish Borders.  The Berwickshire coastline consists of high cliffs over deep clear water with sandy coves and picturesque harbours. Many of the features of a traditional fishing village are preserved in the narrow streets and 'vennels'. The coast offers opportunities for birdwatching, walking, fishing and diving.
