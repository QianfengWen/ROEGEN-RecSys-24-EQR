Torcello is an island north of Venice in Italy.


Understand[edit]
The island was settled in 452 CE, and its population grew to about 20,000 in the 10th century. In the 14th century, the swamp area around the lagoon expanded, reducing its effectiveness as a trading port, and increasing the risk of malaria. People began to move to Venice and other islands. The Black Death of 1575-77 and the Italian plague of 1629-31 accelerated the decline of the population.  In 2014, it was home to only ten permanent residents.

The island is small and entirely walkable. The cathedral, museum, and inns are a 10 to 15-minute stroll down Fondamenta Borgognoni, a path along the canal, from the vaporetto stop.  You can also take a gondola down the canal to the cathedral.
