Guarapari is a popular beach resort town in Espirito Santo, counting about 127,000 people in 2020, a figure that quickly multiplies in high season.


Understand[edit]

Guarapari is a very popular holiday escape for people from landlocked Minas Gerais state and for people from Vitória and Vila Velha. The place is fervent between Christmas and Carnaval, with smaller peaks on school holidays throughout the year.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Guarapari has a small domestic airport with no regular passenger traffic.
Vitória Airport (VIX) - also known as Eurico Salles Airport - in the capital city of Vitória, is the closest airport to Guarapari. It receives daily flights from most state capitals in the country. Among the main airlines serving the airport are LATAM and Gol. A number of smaller carriers also serve the airport, including Azul[dead link], TEAM, and TRIP.
A taxi to/from Vitória Airport will set you back about R$ 150.
There are two daily, direct buses between the airport and Guarapari, by Alvorada, R$ 20, 1,5 hours. From the airport at 09:30 and 16:30. From Guarapari at 08:10 and 14:50.
Otherwise, take a bus Alvorada to Vila Velha, get off near Terminal Vila Velha, and to take a local bus to the airport. Total travel time is about 2 hours, and it costs around R$ 10.

By bus[edit]
-20.628343-40.5257991 Guarapari intercity bus station
The new (2015) bus station is possibly the most modern, and definitely the most shopping-mall-like in all of Brazil. Its being situated some 7 km out of town, on the main highway BR-101, makes it somewhat inconvenient. Consider long-distance buses to Vila Velha), as an alternative. Main lines include Vitória (some via Vila Velha), Rio de Janeiro (3 times daily, 8 hours, via Campos and Niteroi, by Kaissara, 100 R$) and Belo Horizonte.
Frequent local buses (R$ 2.50) run straight to downtown, only slightly slower than taxis (Fixed price R$ 35)
The bus company -20.663181-40.4997872 Alvorada still runs hourly buses (more frequent during peak hours) to Vitória via Vila Velha, until 21:00, by the coastal route. I.e. no need to go to the main bus station.

By car[edit]
Guarapari is on the coast 53 kilometers south of Vitória on highway 60, officially nicknamed Rodovia do Sol. There is also easy access from BR-101. You can locate a car at Vitoria Airport (Hertz, Localiza, among other companies), and drive south taking Rodovia do Sol.

Get around[edit]

Many local buses run throughout the night. Taxis are few on Praia do Morro. None have meters, but there should be a table available showing fixed prices between different neighbourhoods.
