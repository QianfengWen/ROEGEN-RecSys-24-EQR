Tranent is the largest of a string of villages in  East Lothian in central Scotland, 9 miles east of Edinburgh city centre. In 2020 it had a population of 11,910. The other villages, also described here, include Prestonpans, Cockenzie, Longniddry and Port Seton. 


Understand[edit]
This area has been industrial since medieval times. Monks from nearby Newbattle Abbey mined coal here from the 13th century, and worked salt pans along the coast (hence "priest-town-pans", Prestonpans). There were also quarries, distilleries, breweries, tanneries, metal-working, potteries and brickworks. These all became uneconomic in the 20th century and the mining industry dwindled; today the area is a commuter belt for Edinburgh.
Around Tranent is lowland and fertile, with good transport links along the coast and inland towards Berwick-upon-Tweed and Newcastle. In 1745 Prestonpans saw the first battle of Bonnie Prince Charlie's Jacobite rebellion.

55.96-2.953 Battle of Prestonpans Monument commemorates the first battle of "The 45". Bonny Prince Charlie landed in the Highlands in July 1745 to reclaim the throne for the Stuarts; he and his Jacobites marched south to Edinburgh armed with little more than a promise of French support. Government forces under Sir John Cope assembled at Dunbar in September and the Jacobites marched out against them. They met at Prestonpans. Cope's men were green and fled from the Highlanders' wild charge, and the Government side were routed within half an hour. It was a huge boost to Jacobite confidence and credibility, and they marched down into England with high hopes. A monument on Prestonpans hill commemorates the event.
The Prestonpans Tapestry, completed in 2010 and loosely modelled on the Bayeux Tapestry, is an embroidery depicting the battle. It's yet to find a permanent home and (as of Jan 2023) is not on display.
