View of Hope from Water Avenue (Trans Canada Hwy)
Hope is a small town at the far east of the Fraser Valley in British Columbia. Hope is well-known as the gateway to British Columbia's interior, and serves as the junction of four major highways. Outside of the Lower Mainland, Vancouver Island, and Whistler areas, going anywhere in British Columbia by road requires travelling through Hope. Locals like to say that the rest of British Columbia is "Beyond Hope".
While it might be easy to dismiss this small town as just a place to gas up and grab a Timmy's coffee, Hope is justifiably popular as a four-season travel destination. Nestled among mighty peaks, at the confluence of three rivers, Hope is an excellent base for exploring some of the best scenery Canada has to offer. The Hope area offers outdoor recreational opportunities from hiking, downhill and cross-country skiing, fishing, and hunting, to all types of sports in and on the water.


Understand[edit]
The Sto:lo First Nations were the early residents of the area. Explorer Simon Fraser arrived in what is now Hope in 1808, with the Hudson's Bay Company creating the Fort Hope trading post in 1848. The Fraser River and Fraser Street is named for the explorer, while Hudson's Bay Street and Fort Street in Hope commemorate the town's origins.
Hope was transformed in 1858 and onward by the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush as thousands of miners flooded into the region. Spurred by the gold rush and the desire of the British to solidify their claim to control in the face of thousands of American prospectors pouring in, the Colony of British Columbia was created on 2 August 1858, and the Colony of British Columbia joined Canada in 1871 after being promised a railway connection to eastern Canada, which came through Hope.
Founded as a trading post because of its strategic location at the confluence of multiple river valleys, built up because it lay at a choke point into the gold fields, and today a major junction of highways, Hope exists because of its strategic location as the only way to get to so many places.
Hope was incorporated as a village (District) on 6 April 1929, became a town on 1 January 1965, and was reincorporated as a district municipality named the District of Hope on 7 December 1992.
Hope has been a popular location to shoot films.  The first Rambo film First Blood (1982), with Sylvester Stallone, was almost entirely shot in and around Hope. Other movies filmed here include Shoot to Kill (1988), with Sidney Poitier, Tom Berenger and Kirstie Alley; K2 (1992) - the area's mountains standing in for the Himalayas - and several others.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Highway 1 - West (Trans-Canada Highway) follows the Fraser Valley to Vancouver as a fully controlled access route. which merges seamlessly with Highway 5.
Highway 1 - North - the Fraser Canyon portion of (Trans-Canada Highway) links to Cache Creek where drivers connect to Highway 97 to access Northern British Columbia/Yukon/Alaska or continue on Highway 1 east to Kamloops and beyond to the rest of Canada. Highway 1 north is accessed by exiting at the Welcome to Hope sign, then driving through the edge of downtown Hope and across the Fraser River. This route is generally called "the canyon" by locals.
Highway 3 (Crowsnest Highway) travels east to Manning Park, and on to Princeton, Osoyoos, and ultimately Alberta via a southern route. It is a 2- to 4-lane road and still contains many narrow sections. This route is known as the "Hope-Princeton" by locals.
Highway 5 (Coquihalla Highway portion of the Yellowhead Highway) is a controlled access freeway that winds high through the mountains northeast to Merritt, then to either Kamloops and beyond to northern BC, or via 97C (the "Okanagan connector") towards the Okanagan Valley. While built as a toll road, and still marked as such on some maps, the tolls have been lifted. The route is called "the Coq" (pronounced "coke") by locals.
Important: Highway 5 (the Coq) between Hope and Kamloops is not part of the Trans-Canada Highway, but the high mountain route built in 1986 saves at least an hour of travel time over the older, often two lane Highway 1 route to Kamloops and is therefore preferred by travellers, except during extreme winter weather, when the lower elevation canyon route may be a better choice.

Highway 7 (the Lougheed Highway) heads west on the north bank of the Fraser River, to Mission, Coquitlam, and eventually Vancouver. This route is a slower route to Vancouver because it is not generally a divided highway and goes through the commercial cores of Mission, Maple Ridge, Pitt Meadows, Coquitlam, and Burnaby before reaching Vancouver. A scenic drive though.

A huge landslide on 9 January 1965 peeled off 47 million cubic metres of rock, the largest in recorded Canadian history at the time. The flow filled a lake in the valley, sloshed 30-60 m up the opposite hillside, and fell back. It buried the highway to a depth of 50 m and it buried some areas of the valley up to 150 m. Several vehicles, stopped below by an earlier slide, were buried, and four were people killed. The scar all the way up Johnson Ridge is still vivid, and it's possible to make out a crease in the trees on the other side of the valley, where the slosh reached. A driveway up from the highway leads to a parking lot with a good view, an explanation, and simple toilets. Free.   (updated Aug 2017)
