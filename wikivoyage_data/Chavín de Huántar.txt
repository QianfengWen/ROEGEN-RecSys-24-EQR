Chavín de Huántar is a town of around 9,000 inhabitants, most of which are bilingual in Spanish and Quechua. It's the capital of a district with the same name and is perched high up in the Andes at an altitude of 3,137 m above sea level. 
Once it was an important center of Chavín ceremonies and a pilgrimage destination, which had a cultural influence on much of Peru from the coast to the highlands from the 15th to the 3rd century BCE. Today the site attracts visitors who want to learn more about this ancient culture from a historical point of view but also visitors interested in the spiritual and mystic site of the place even in the present day, as well as the entheogenic plants of the region (also used in the ancient ceremonies).
Moreover, there's a great deal of beautiful nature in the surroundings. Part of the district is in the Huascarán National Park and there are several day or multi-day treks to see snow-capped mountains, waterfalls and streams.

Climate[edit]
Chavín is in the tropics, but also at a high altitude so temperatures aren't particularly high for this latitude. Daytime highs are generally below +20°C, and at night temperatures are a few degrees below +10°C. As with tropical locations, the temperatures don't change much throughout the year but the amount of rain does. The dry season, also known "Andean summer", ranges from April to November, whereas the rainy season covers December to March - though months just before and after the rainy season aren't entirely dry. During the rainy season it may rain up to 1000 mm.

Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
There are daily buses from Huaraz, Huari, Llamellín and Lima. 
From Huaraz the distance is 104 km (65 mi), and the ride along a paved road takes at least two hours. The trip goes south to Cátac, then eastwards at which point the road starts ascending. It then enters the Huascarán National Park and goes through the Kahuish tunnel to enter the district of Chavín de Huántar. Several bus companies located on Mariscal Caceres avenue offer regular departures throughout the day to Chavin (S/12, May 2014). Buses to destinations further afield also stop at Chavin around midnight, but then you'll need to have accommodation sorted out ahead.

By taxi[edit]
You might also be able to find shared taxis and combis from Huaraz. From San Marcos, a town 14 km (8.7 mi) away, you can get in by taxi colectivo or combi. The former is a private vehicle, commonly a station wagon, and the latter is a small van with seats. Combis are part of a private association operating routes approved by the Peruvian Ministry of Transport.

By foot[edit]
There are hikes of two days and longer from other villages, going through the beautiful Huascarán National Park. Alternatively you can hike along the Inka naani, a well preserved part of the world heritage listed Qhapaq Ñan network of Inca trails. The most famous trail is the Olleros-Chavín trail beginning in the village of Olleros near Huaraz. It has a distance of 38 km, and includes the mountain pass of Yanashallash at 4,700 m (15,400 ft) above sea level. Do hire a guide from one of the many tour agencies.
