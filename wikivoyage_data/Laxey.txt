Laxey is a small and very touristy village on the Isle of Man - its Great Wheel is an icon of the island. Laksaa in Manx means salmon, like the modern Scandinavian and German words, and the river descending steeply from Snaefell has a run of salmon. From the 18th century Laxey was a metal-mining village, as it was possible to drill horizontally into the mountainside - such "adits" are technically easier than vertical "shafts", and much easier to drain. The Great Wheel is the best known of several large waterwheels installed to pump out the mines. 
Laxey is also the start of the mountain railway up Snaefell. In 2021 the village population was 1656.

Get around[edit]
The village is small enough to walk around.

See[edit]
54.2314-4.39641 King Orry's Grave is a chambered burial tomb 4000-5000 years old. It's within the garden of a private cottage on Ballaragh Road, but there's free access. King Orry himself is mythical, but is based on the 11th century Godred Crovan, a Norse-Gaelic warrior. He was on the losing side at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066, fled to Mann, and somehow attained its kingship. At its zenith his rule stretched around the Irish Sea and Hebrides, but he was ousted from Dublin and died on Islay in 1095. He's probably buried on Iona where the many medieval royal burial plots can no longer be identified.
54.2385-4.40742 Laxey Wheel (Queeyl Vooar Laksey), Mines Road IM4 7NL, ☏ +44 1624 648000. Apr-Oct daily 09:30-16:30. Laxey and the surrounding hills have ores of lead, zinc, copper and traces of silver. These were mined in a small way from the 13th century but the process ramped up in the 19th, and deeper mines required incessant pumping to prevent flooding. By then steam power was replacing watermills on mainland Britain, but the Isle of Man lacked coal. This huge waterwheel (also known as "Lady Isabella") was built in 1854: at 72 ft 6 in (22.1 m) diameter it's the world's largest still in use. Water from higher up the hill is siphoned to the top of the tower and falls onto the wheel buckets in a "backshot" design. It rotates 3 times a minute and the motion is conveyed by a 200 m rod to a rocker that drives the pumps. Visitors also explore an old mine adit. Adult £13, child free.   (updated Mar 2023)
Snaefell Wheel or Lady Evelyn Wheel above the railway station is the survivor of a pair of 50 ft (15.24 m) pumping wheels installed in 1865. They fell into disuse in 1910 and this one worked for a time in Cornwall, but was returned and restored in 2006.
 Great Laxey Mine Railway (Raad Yiarn Meain Mooar Laksaa), Douglas Rd IM4 7NH (Above railway station), ☏ +44 1624 862007. Apr-Sept Sa 11:00-16:30. This is a reconstruction of the 19 inch (483 mm) gauge railway that from 1823 brought ore from deep in the mountain. It was initially hand-hauled, then by pit pony, then by steam locomotives from 1877. The mine closed in 1929 and everything above ground was scrapped, but one train was left below and has been restored. Replica locos now shunt visitors up and down the site but don't go into the mine - no point, since the visitors yield more silver than was ever extracted from the depths.  (updated Mar 2023)
54.2633-4.46253 Snaefell is the Isle of Man's highest peak and the only one you'd call a mountain, at 2037 feet / 621 m. As the name indicates, it's the only point where snow is likely to lie in this mild maritime climate. Take a look at the cloud cover before deciding to go up. Most visitors ride the mountain railway to the summit station, where the cafe is open daily. See below for hiking routes.
54.2754-4.36324 Cashtal yn Ard ("Castle of the Heights") is a large chambered burial tomb 4000 years old, on the hill above Glen Mona. It's about 130 ft / 40 m long, oriented east-west, giving its unknown occupants a view of the farmlands below. Its bones of a young man have not been dated, but the pottery shards were typically Neolithic. Some of the stone has been recycled into nearby buildings. The site is free to explore 24 hours.
Do[edit]
Laxey Wheel
Laxey beach is below the river outlet and little harbour. It's sandy.
Snaefell on foot is usually ascended from The Bungalow on A18 - at 1360 ft this is the highest point on the TT race circuit, and the penultimate stop on the mountain railway. Head straight north up the clear grassy trail, and reckon 30 min to the summit. A 7 km trail ascends from Laxey Wheel and there are several others.
Dhoon Glen is accessed by a footpath starting off A2 two miles north of Laxey. It winds down to a sandy beach.
