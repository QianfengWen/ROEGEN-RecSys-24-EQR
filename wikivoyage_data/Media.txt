Media is the county seat of Delaware County, Pennsylvania.


Understand[edit]
Olive Street in Media
Media was a planned city, meaning it had a deliberate layout with streets spread south, west, and east around the courthouse. The lots were sold at public auctions to citizens which attracted businesses. Media, since its in a rural area, was popular for farms and orchards.
Media was not the original location of the county seat for Delaware County.  It was originally placed in Chester as far back as 1789. Many complaints arose over the years, though, because the location of the courthouse was difficult to travel to from the farther parts of the county. Therefore, after years of debate, the county seat was officially moved from Chester to Media in 1850. The courthouse in Media is located at 201 West Front Street.
