Understand[edit]
The village streets of historic Port Gamble haven't changed much since Puget Mill Company founded the town in 1853.  The original New England Victorian-style homes have been lovingly preserved, along with the several other historic buildings in the area. Since 1966 the Port Gamble Historic District is a registered U.S. National Historic Landmark and a popular destination for tourists.
In 1856, the USS Massachusetts was sent from Seattle to Port Gamble, Washington Territory on Puget Sound, where indigenous raiding parties from British and Russian territories had been raiding and enslaving local Native Americans. When the warriors refused to hand over those among them who had attacked the Puget Sound Native American communities, Massachusetts landed a shore party and a battle ensued in which 26 natives and 1 sailor were killed. That sailor was the first US Navy man killed in the Northwest and his grave can still be seen at the hilltop cemetery.
