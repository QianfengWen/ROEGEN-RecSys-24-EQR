Semmering is an alpine pass connecting Lower Austria and Styria. The Semmering railway is an UNESCO world heritage site as it is the first high alpine mountain railway.

Semmering railway in 1900s

Understand[edit]
Semmering is the best known alpine resort in eastern Austria. In 1854 the Semmering railway was built, one of the first railways to pass through high alpine mountains. The spectacular landscape and the monumental buildings were declared UNESCO world heritage. The railway made it easily accessible from Vienna, and at the fin-de-siècle, several monumental hotels were built here. The Semmering railway was considered such an impressive feat of engineering that many other railways through mountainous terrain were nicknamed "Semmering of x", much like the Watergate scandal engendered the "-gate" suffix for scandals. As of 2020, a new base tunnel is being built for faster long distance trains, and to relieve freight trains of the costly and difficult need to have extra locomotives coupled to get across the steep sections. The old line will of course stay open, but international and freight traffic will move to the new line once it opens.
The Semmering region encompasses the municipalities Gloggnitz, Payerbach, Maria Schutz, Semmering in Lower Austria and Spital, Mürzzuschlag, Neuberg, Mürzsteg in Styria.
