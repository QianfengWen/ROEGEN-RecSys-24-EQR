Additionally, many buses run between Bundang to Seoul. You can take express or gwangyeok (광역) buses for Bundang at Seoul Exchange Center, taking Seoul Ring Expressway.

 Seongnam Bus Terminal, 16 Seongnamdae-ro 925 been-gil (directly connected to Yatap Station). In Seoul, you don't need to take intercity buses to get to Bundang. If you are in other cities such as Incheon, you may take intercity buses. (updated Apr 2017)

Taxis can be used, but they are not as ubiquitous as in Seoul. During rush hour it is near impossible to find a free taxi. At night, however, there should be no problem.
