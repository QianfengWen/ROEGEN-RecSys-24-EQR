Allen Street, Tombstone
Tombstone is a former mining town in Southeast Arizona. Along with Deadwood, South Dakota, Tombstone was America's most storied town in the wild frontier days.


Understand[edit]
"The Town Too Tough To Die" was founded in 1877 as a mining camp. There were seven years of gold, silver, and total lawlessness to follow, climaxing in the famous shoot-out between Wyatt Earp and the Clanton gang at The O.K. Corral. Today, Tombstone's main industry is tourism. It has several streets of vintage churches, saloons, and hotels from the 1880s.
