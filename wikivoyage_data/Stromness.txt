Stromness is a port on the Mainland of the Orkney Islands, with a population of roughly 2200. To the Vikings, Straumsnes meant the headland just south, where a fierce tide rips between Scapa Flow and the Atlantic; get past that and you came safely into Hamnavoe or "peaceful harbour" where the town now stands. It's long been a fishing village but it was more important in the 17th and 18th centuries, when Britain was often at war with France, the Channel was unsafe, and shipping had to detour around the north of Scotland. Hudson's Bay explorers and traders, and the expeditions of Captain Cook and of Franklin, all stopped here for rest and re-supply. Today Stromness is the second largest town in the Orkneys but it's a quiet place, with a pleasant narrow flagged main street, and it's escaped the industrial sprawl seen around Kirkwall.
The Travel Information Centre is the Travel Centre by the bus and ferry terminal. 


Get in[edit]
By ferry[edit]
Stromness seen from the ferry
Northlink car ferries sail 2 or 3 times daily between Stromness and Scrabster, taking 90 min. If you book a cabin on the early morning sailing to Scrabster, you can board between 9:30PM and 12:30PM the previous evening. Stromness 58.964-3.2961 ferry terminal is central in town next to the bus terminus.
The other ferry routes from the Scottish mainland to Orkney are Aberdeen-Kirkwall-Shetland, Gills Bay to St Margaret's Hope, and John O'Groats to Burwick: see Orkney Islands#Get in.
Orkney Ferries sail at least twice a day from Stromness to Moaness at the north end of Hoy and to Graemsay. The ferry to Lyness at the south end of Hoy and to Flotta sails from Houton five miles south of Stromness: Bus 5 connects twice a day.

By bus or taxi[edit]
The main bus into town is Stagecoach X1, hourly from Kirkwall via Stenness. It also connects south of Kirkwall, but less frequently, past the Italian Chapel to the ferry terminal at St Margaret's Hope.
A taxi from Kirkwall takes 25 min and costs about £38 as of Sep 2022.

Get around[edit]

Stromness is compact and its flagged main street is a pleasant stroll.
The Stones of Stenness are only four miles away, an hour's hike, but it's a busy main road with only an intermittent sidewalk. Bike is the ideal way to reach these, Skara Brae, Birsay and Kirkwall, and to potter around Hoy, though for sure the stiff breeze will contrive to be in your face in both directions. 
Orkney Cycle Hire is at 54 Dundas St, open daily 8AM-5PM.

See[edit]
Dr John Rae (1813-1893) is commemorated by a statue at the ferry terminal. He was born at Orphir on Orkney, became a surgeon and joined the Hudson's Bay Company. On the Bay he learned how to live off the land and travel light and fast, unlike the typical ponderous Victorian expedition. He made many arduous explorations of Canada's northeast coast, and was asked to help trace Franklin's lost navy expedition. He learned of its fate from the Inuit and brought back a few items - plus the news that the desperate party had resorted to cannibalism, and for this he was detested by the Victorian establishment. He's buried at St Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall.
