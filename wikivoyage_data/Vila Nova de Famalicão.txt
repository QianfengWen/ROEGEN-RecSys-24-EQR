You have a lot of highways going to Famalicão, from Braga, Guimarães, Porto, Felgueiras, Chaves, and others. If you are coming from the south of Portugal there is no difficulty at all. The Portuguese highways are all very well connected, and you only have to go straight to Porto, and then in Porto you catch A3 (Highway 3) which goes to Famalicão. It's quite easy.

Rede Expressos, a network of long-distance bus services, includes a number of direct and indirect lines to Famalicão from practically every city in Portugal. The buses are slightly slower but often not much cheaper than train tickets, especially when bought in advance, and are a much better option only when a direct rail connection is not available.
