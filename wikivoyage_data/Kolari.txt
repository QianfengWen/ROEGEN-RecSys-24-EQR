Kolari municipality on map of Finland.
The railway station.
Kolari is a municipality in Finnish Lapland, best known as the northernmost railhead in Finland, with overnight trains from southern Finland. Most tourists continue from the town itself to Ylläs or other resorts.


Understand[edit]
67.56724.2121 Yllästunturi (Ylläs fell) by Pallas-Yllästunturi National Park, 35 km away from the railway station and the administrative centre, is by far the most important destination in the municipality. During the winter sports season the villages 67.60524.1532 Äkäslompolo and 67.52424.3033 Ylläsjärvi are crowded with skiers. Otherwise the municipality is largely forest and swamps, including an important bird site, with some fells in the west.
The river Muonionjoki is an important salmon river and salmon fishing is the major attraction during the summer months.
Historically Kolari was famous for its mines. There are several closed mines around the municipality and the large iron ore resources are still in interest of many international mining companies. Today tourism is the main source of income, and the question about how well the mining industry would fit with it is a hot topic among the locals.

Map of Kolari
The municipality, at the Swedish border (by Pajala), has one of the northern railheads, with overnight trains from southern Finland.

By train[edit]
Kolari is the northernmost railway station in Finland. During the winter season there is a direct train connection daily from Helsinki via Tampere; at 995 km, this is the longest single train route in Finland. An overnight trip takes 13 hours and is most comfortable in a sleeping cabin. Sometimes the train contains a special club car serving as a nightclub during the trip. The train also carries cars from Helsinki. Off season you might need to use the trains towards Rovaniemi and transfer to bus in Kemi, or unload your car in Oulu or Rovaniemi and drive from there.
See VR for timetables.

By bus[edit]
Daily connection from Oulu, Kemi and Tornio is available. See timetables from Matkahuolto.

By plane[edit]
The nearest airports are in Kittilä to the east and in Pajala across the border to Sweden. Rovaniemi, farther away but with better connections at least off season, is another option.
For small private planes there is the 67.603823.97172 Aavahelukka air field (EFAA), used by the local flying club.

By car[edit]
Kolari is on E8.
From Helsinki, drive by E75 to the north until you reach E8 near Oulu.
If driving from Germany or Central Europe in general, the shortest alternative is to drive through Sweden along road E4 all the way to Luleå and then through Pajala to the Finnish border and on to Kolari.
Unless you like driving long distances or visit destination en route, a good alternative would be to take a ferry from Germany to Helsinki, then to board an overnight train from Helsinki and just unload your car in Kolari. Off season, you might have to take the train to Rovaniemi instead (optionally get off already in Oulu; no unloading of cars in Kemi).
From Sweden there is a bridge at 67.311523.74623 Kolari border crossing about 3 km south from the municipality centre. There are bridges also at Haparanda/Tornio, Övertorneå/Ylitornio (Aavasaksa), Pello and Karesuvanto.
From northern Norway use E8 from Tromsø, road 93 via Kautokeino or E75 via Tana. From E75 you can turn at Sodankylä and continue via Kittilä.

Get around[edit]




Crashing in Kolari
Before tourism, Kolari's main industry was mining and a kolari was a charcoal manufacturer, from the same root as English coal.  However, in modern Finnish kolari means "car crash", so telling somebody olin Kolarissa ("I was in [a] kolari") may sound more shocking than intended!


Matkahuolto Reittiopas includes information about some long distance bus routes which can be used for local travelling.
The town is mostly built along the Muonionjoki river and its Saaripudas fork. The train station is in the north end. The Kolari and Kolarinsaari churches are some 3 km downstream, the latter across the Kolarinsaari bridge. The bridge over Muonionjoki is 3 km further downstream, in the south end of the town, 25 km from Pajala centre.
The island Kolarinsaari is some 7 km long, sparsely settled near the bridge in the south. The settlements in the north are adjacent to Saaripudas on the Finnish side and the Swedish Kolari village (there was no border here before the 19th century).
