Alto Paraíso de Goiás, often shortened to Alto Paraiso (Highland Paradise), is a city in the Brazilian state of Goias. It is the main gateway to the Chapada dos Veadeiros region.


Understand[edit]
Alto Paraíso is home to some 40 mystical/ philosophical/ religious communities (Daimists, Oshoists, Hare Krishna, Kardecists, Protestants, Buddhists and others). It is believed that the huge geological layer of quartz crystal underground makes this a region of the Planet that was chosen to receive enlightened beings, creators of the Age of Aquarius, and emanate positive vibrations. The parallel 14, which crosses Machu Picchu in Peru, also does so on Alto Paraíso, more precisely upon the Zen Garden (there is a small monument, full of stones and flowers, on the highway en route to Cavalcante), a beautiful scenery and stage to fantastic stories involving UFOs and ETs. On the road to São Jorge is the impressive Morro da Baleia (Mount Whale), a close second in mystic beauties and mysteries. Within the municipality are several of the best and most beautiful waterfalls in the country, especially in this sense the rivers Preto, São Miguel and Couros, tributaries of the mighty river Tocantins in Amazon Basin.

Get in[edit]
Map of Alto Paraíso de Goiás



By plane[edit]
Most air travelers arriving at the Brasilia airport. There is a small domestic airport here, for small planes, but there are no regular air services.

By bus[edit]
The buses depart from the Brasilia Interestadual bus station.
Just check the departure times on the apps of Clickbus or Buscaonibus.

By car[edit]
From Brasilia, take the BR-020 toward Salvador (for those arriving by plane: Airport> South Eixão> North Eixão> Bragueto Bridge> Torto Roundabout> Posto Colorado> Sobradinho) and turn left into the BR-010 (GO-118) after Planaltina (the roundabout is well signposted). Total distance from Brasilia is 230 km.
From Goiânia, pass Brasilia and follow the above route.
From São Paulo, take Via Anhanguera (SP-330) until Uberaba. From there, take the BR-050 to Brasilia.
Get around[edit]
The city itself is very small and easy, a Main Avenue (Avenida Ary Valadão Filho) starts on the road and cuts through the whole of it. The Bus Station is two blocks to the right of Main Avenue and all the "buy", "eat", "drink", "stay safe" and half "sleep" options are either at Main Avenue, (at most) two blocks away of it, or close to Bus Station. It´s that simple.
There are a lot of waterfall options around Alto Paraiso (Loquinhas are the closest and coziest, Crystal River is close too, there is a hiking trail to Sertão Zen, a little harder, Couros and Macaco rivers require a 4WD vehicle), but the best ones are around Vila São Jorge (St. George Village) 36 km west, the gateway to the National Park. There are vans and little difficulty to hitchhike. The road is very scenic, half of it is paved already, but the dirt part can get a little annoying during the rainy season (October-April).

See[edit]
City Portal - Stone arches welcome the visitor, at the entrance of APG.
Mirante do Pouso Alto- Monument on Pouso Alto hill, highest point of Goiás state - 1.676 m.
Jardim Zen (Zen Garden) - Monument marking Parallel 14, ahead on the highway
Little Stonehenge - beside the City Portal, parallel to the road, curious arrangement of granite blocks, worth a pic.

Do[edit]
There is a New Age quality about Alto Paraiso, lots of people come there looking for Positive Vibration and alternative stuff. As a rule of thumb, "quiet" people stay here and "party" people stay at São Jorge.
