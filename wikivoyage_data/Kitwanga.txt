Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Kitwanga is located where Highway 16 (Yellowhead Highway) intersects with Highway 37 (Stewart-Cassiar Highway).   
Along Highway 16, Kitwanga is about 1 hour northeast of Terrace and 5½ hours west of Prince George. The area is in the northern mountains so extra precautions should be taken during the winter.  
Highway 37 connects to the Yukon Highway 1 (Alaska Highway); taking the route, as opposed to the entire Alaska Highway which starts in Dawson Creek, can save about 210 km (130 mi) for travellers coming from southern British Columbia and the US Pacific Northwest. 
On the Yellowhead Highway, there is mobile wireless coverage along the corridor west of Kitwanga, but gaps for stretches between Terrace and Kitwanga, and gaps for stretches between Terrace and Prince Rupert.
On Stewart-Cassiar Highway (Highway 37), Kitwanga and near Watson Lake, Yukon, about 720 km km away, there is no mobile wireless service due to few tiny communities along the way.  Near this corridor, there is mobile wireless service in Stewart, but Stewart is a 60 km drive from Highway 37.
