Understand[edit]
Blind River
This used to be Ojibwa land. Explorer Samuel de Champlain arrived in the 1600s, Lake Huron and the North Channel of the Mississaugi River later became part of the Voyageur Route. A fur trading post established by the Northwest Company in 1789 was taken over by the Hudson Bay Company in 1820. A river known to the natives as 'Penewobecong' was not visible to voyageurs as they followed the canoe route, so it was called the "Blind River".
The first sawmill, built at the current site of the Old Mill Motel, provided timber and planks for a copper mine in nearby Bruce Mines. A second sawmill was built in 1906 at the site of the current Blind River Marine Park and Blind River was incorporated as a town. Pronto Mines operated briefly in nearby Algoma Mills after uranium was discovered in the area in 1955. Ore from the Blind River-Elliot Lake Uranium mining camp fed a uranium refinery, built just west of Blind River in 1983 and now owned by Cameco Corporation.
