The Oudegracht. In the centre the Dom Church tower.
Utrecht is a central Dutch city with a long history. With 362,000 inhabitants (2022), it’s the fourth largest city in the Netherlands. Utrecht is known as a student city with a large population of single young people. This results in a booming nightlife with many places to have a quick meal, some drinks or a dance.


Understand[edit]
The history of the city goes back to 47 AD when the Roman emperor Claudius ordered his general Corbulo to build a defensive line along the river Rhine which was the northern most border of the empire. One of the strongholds (or Castella) along the river was built at a crossing in the river and was called Traiectum (which means crossingplace). In the local language this became Trecht, Uut-Trecht (lower-Trecht) and later Utrecht. On the place where once the castellum stood now stands the Domchurch built in the 13th century.

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
52.0893165.1099721 Utrecht Centraal Station. The hub of the Dutch rail network, it is easily accessible directly, or with one change of train, from almost every station in the Netherlands. For instance, there are frequent direct connections from Amsterdam and Schiphol Airport (even at night), each taking just over 30 minutes for €10.20 one-way. The high-speed train ICE to Cologne, Frankfurt and Basel stops in Utrecht every two hours.   (updated Nov 2023)
Coming from Germany with the Deutschland-Ticket, take the RE19 e.g. from Düsseldorf/Duisburg to Arnhem. And then an InterCity (every 15 min) for €7-12 to Utrecht . (updated Feb 2024)
The train station is at the western edge of the old city. A 5-minute walk through the Hoog Catharijne shopping center (follow signs to “Centrum”) will take you from the station to the city or the bus station.

By bus[edit]
The bus station is next to the train station. International buses depart from the western side of the train station ('Jaarbeurszijde'), exit the railway station on the correct side and turn right to find the busstop next to the NH-Hotel. Flixbus has several lines to Utrecht connecting directly with many European Countries. The international buses to Belgium and Germany are often a cost effective alternative to the trains with longer (Germany) or similar (Belgium) travel duration. The regional and city buses depart from separate stations on the east and west side of the train station. The regional buses are much slower than the trains. For information about the city buses, check the U-OV website, this is the company that provides public transport services in and around the city of Utrecht. Buses to the smaller towns around Utrecht are run by BBA[dead link], Arriva and  Connexxion. Time schedules for train and bus can be found  here.

By car[edit]
If you are coming in by car, park your car in one of the many parking garages around the city (follow the signs) and walk from there. Electronic signs display the number of parking spaces available in any given lot as well as directions to the lot, and if the sign says Vol it means the lot is full. Expect to pay[dead link] around €3 to €5 per hour (as of Aug 2019) at any of the garages in the center. Parking on the curb side is also possible, expect to pay[dead link] €3 to €5 an hour in advance at the meter (as of Aug 2019). Parking fines are around €70 and frequently enforced, so make sure to get back to your car before the ticket expires. It’s best to avoid driving into central Utrecht. Instead, leave your car at the city perimeter and take a bus or tram into the center.
There are 4 Park + Ride (P+R) around the city where you can park your car for the day at a flat rate of €5 (as of Aug 2019), including transit to the city center by bus or tram for up to 5 passengers. Both bus and trams offer comparable frequency of service. Two P+R facilities are adjacent to tram lines:

52.0575235.105012 P+R Westraven, Griffioenlaan (close to the A12 highway exit number 17). The Nieuwegein-Utrecht tram lines 20 & 21 have a stop at P+R Westraven, and both tram lines go to the stop CS Centrumzijde at the central railway station.  (updated Dec 2019)
52.0916515.1778853 P+R Utrecht Science Park, Universiteitsweg (adjacent to A28 highway at exit for N412). Tram 22 takes you to city-side of Utrecht Centraal Station.  (updated Dec 2019)
Get around[edit]
Map of Utrecht


Pedestrian street
Walking or using a bike is the easiest way to travel in the city of Utrecht.
To use the public transportation in the Netherlands, it is recommended to buy an OV-chipkaart. You can buy these on the central bus station (lower level of Utrecht Centraal Station), at kiosks inside the central train station or at some book stores and grocery stores. The OV-chipkaart is valid for bus, train and tram and works like a debit card that you must first charge with an amount.  Buses do take cash though.

By bike[edit]
Using a bike is the easiest way to travel in the city centre if the weather is on your side. There are many bicycle shops near the train station where you can rent bikes. Alternatively, if you have a personal OV-chipkaart you can rent an OV-Fiets for €3.85 per 24 hours at one of the rail stations, you have to subscribe to the service for 1 eurocent a year on the NS website first though. Do make sure that you have good locks on your bike, as bike thefts are unfortunately quite common in the city centre. Also it's a good idea to make use of the free bike parking areas provided by the city council. They are usually guarded and are a safe place to park your bike.
Also recommended is to do a bike tour. There are several bike tour companies offering guided city tours. There are also cycle routes starting in the centre of Utrecht, which you can download for free: Utrecht Forts Cycle Route.

By bus[edit]
A good alternative is taking the bus, which goes often and will take you nearly everywhere. Utrecht Centraal Station serves as the main bus hub for Utrecht as well as the main train hub for the Netherlands.  Most buses run from early morning (around 06:00) until just after midnight.  City center rides cost ~€2.50. U-OV operates trams and local buses in and around Utrecht, and has a page in English for visitors.
In addition, there are several so-called nightlines. These cost €5-6 and can’t be paid for using strips or OV-chipkaart.

By public transit[edit]
Utrecht has 3 tram routes all running via the central station (Utrecht Centraal Station a.k.a. Utrecht CS). The station has an underground tram/bus stop named Centrumzijde (meaning downtown side) on the east side of the station. On the station's west side, there is another tram stop named Jaarbeursplein, but visitors are most likely to use Centrumzijde which is nearest to the old city centre. Platforms labelled B at Centrumzijde is for trams. There are 3 tram routes effective July 2, 2022:

Tram  20 : Nieuwegein-Zuid – Utrecht CS – P+R Science Park
Tram  21 : IJsselstein-Zuid – Utrecht CS – P+R Science Park
Tram  22 : Utrecht CS – P+R Science Park
From Utrecht CS, trams run southwest passing P+R Westraven to Nieuwegein Stadscentrum where the tram line splits into two branches to IJsselstein-Zuid and Nieuwegein-Zuid. The southwest section of the line operates every day to a little past midnight. 
Trams operate from Utrecht CS southeast to P+R Science Park Monday to Friday until 21:30. At these times riders can travel from either IJsselstein-Zuid or Nieuwegein-Zuid to P+R Science Park without switching vehicles. However, there is no weekend or late evening service to P+R Science Park, at which times all trams terminate at Utrecht CS. Use bus line 28 when trams to P+R Science Park are not running. P+R Science Park is in the Uithof district southeast of the centre of Utrecht.
U-OV operates trams and local buses, and their network can be travelled as cheap as €6.95 using the U-OV dagkaart. For the rest of the province, a separate €11.05 off-peak ticket exists. Both tickets offer unlimited access to U-OV buses and trams. The tickets can be bought online or at U-OV ticket machines or service desks. To use the tickets, you must be in the possession of an OV-chipkaart.

By car[edit]
Seeing Utrecht by car is not recommended. The city planners have made it as difficult as possible to navigate the city center, to try and discourage cars there. Driving around can be frustrating as the center is fraught with bus-only lanes, one-way streets, traffic lights and terribly expensive parking spaces. If you want to come by car it is recommended to park at one of the P+R (Park and Ride) places, and take a cheap shuttle bus or tram service into town. There are also several parking garages closer to the center, but they are more expensive.

Around the Domplein[edit]
De Dom at Dawn
52.0908335.1216671 Dom van Utrecht (Domkerk), Achter de Dom 1. May-Sep: M-F 10:00-17:00, Sa 10:00-15:30, Su 12:30-16:00; Oct-Apr: M-F 11:00-15:00, Sa 10:00-15:30, Su 12:30-16:00. The Gothic Dom church (built between 1284 and 1520) is the major religious building in the city. It was a part of a larger cathedral which was partially destroyed by a severe storm while under construction. When a hurricane hit the town in 1674, the badly constructed nave collapsed, which is the reason that today the Domtoren (Bell Tower) and the church itself are separated by the Domplein (Dom Square). The interior of the church was stripped down of every sculpture during Reformation, but the exterior remains a lavishly decorated example of Dutch Gothic architecture.   
 DOMunder, Dom Square (Domplein). guided tours Tu-Su 10:30, 11:30, 12:30, 13:30, 14:30, 15:30, 16:30. An interesting museum/guided tour under the Dom Square about the Romans in Utrecht. €11. (updated Sep 2015)

Oudegracht[edit]
It is a major canal going through the heart of the city, with shops and restaurants on both sides. This canal is unique because of its many picturesque cellars on water level. Centuries ago they were used for storage and commerce. Nowadays, many of them host fine restaurants and pubs. In the summer you can find nice terraces at the water here.

52.091395.119725 Stadhuisbrug. Perhaps it's the most famous bridge over the Oudegracht. It was created in 1547 by vaulting a space between the older two bridges: the Huidenbrug and the Broodbrug, thus creating one of the major squares in the old town.  (updated Jul 2016)
52.0908785.1202366 Kalisbrug. It's another bridge over the Oudegracht which make a small square between Steenweg and Vismarkt.

The barrel-vaulted ceiling is made up of glazed yellow-brick ribs alternated with diagonal glass panes that fill the hall with natural light. The black-and-white floor is set off by five carved black statues set in the walls, each representing a continent. America is a stylized American Indian with two buffalo at his feet. Over the main entrance are magnificent stained glass windows. It was renovated in 2019/2020 and opened for public on 13 March 2020. The impressive central hallway is accessible from the Neude square and offers space for the central library, several restaurants, guarded bicycle parking and a supermarket.   (updated Apr 2020)
Minnaert-building on the Uithof university campus

It is a rather strange mix between grey concrete buildings and buildings here that are designed by famous modern architects, like the Educatorium designed by Rem Koolhaas, the University Library and the Minnaert building. There is also a beautiful botanical garden that is 8 acres big, houses 6 thousand different sorts of plants and a Napoleonic fort. Also worth a look: the bicycle track at the Heidelberglaan which is broad enough to function as a two-way car-track. The university campus can be reached from the Central Station by taking tram Line 22.   (updated Jun 2016)
52.0873175.11496710 De Inktpot. A notable building with a flying saucer (UFO) on its roof. The saucer is a remnant of the Utrecht art exhibition Panorama 2000, designed by Marc Ruygrok.  (updated Jun 2016)

Cannabis.  Sarasani, opened in 1968, was the oldest coffee shop in the Netherlands. Located at Oudegracht 327 a/d werf, which means it was on the canal level, and sat under the main street. Sarisani closed down in 2007. On Wednesdays and Saturdays Joepi[dead link] makes a round through the center of Utrecht to deliver food and beverages with a little ‘extra’, mainly psychedelics, cannabis and energetic herbs.
Geek gear[edit]
There are half a dozen stores at the part of the Oudegracht (Old Canal) south of De Dom that sell board games, card games, wargames, roleplaying games, fantasy and science-fiction books and/or comics (e.g. Piet Snot, Elf Fantasy, the Joker and Neverneverland). Keep your eyes peeled; some of these stores are easy to miss.

Blunder has a large collection of “mainstream comics” on street level and an even bigger collection of the newest American comics and Manga/Anime in the basement. The address is Oudegracht 203.
Piet Snot[dead link] is a normal comic shop. They also have a big collection of second hand comics. Vismarkt 3 (It’s a small part of the Oudegracht that for some dark reason has been given a different name...)
Strip & Lectuurshop. Lots of comics at Oudegracht 194
The Joker. Games, games and more games. From your normal family games to the German type games and the American wargames and everything in between. They also have lots of collectible card games and scenario-books for RPGs. In the basement it’s possible to play the games. It is at Oudegracht 230a.
Neverneverland, like The Joker, has a large selection of boardgames and RPGs at Oudegracht 202.
Subcultures is well... about subcultures, next to being a regular game shop. Specialized in miniature wargames, RPGs and designer toys. The address is Oude Gracht 183.
Eat[edit]
Many restaurants can be found in the city center. Especially near the canals there is a huge choice of places to eat, each with their own style of kitchen, like Italian, Thai, and American. Ask the locals for which places are recommended as not every restaurant offers the same quality.

Drink[edit]
As the population of Utrecht contains a lot of students, naturally there are a lot of places where you can spend the day or night having some drinks and a dance. Most are in the city center. Main hubs for drinks are Neude, Janskerkhof, Mariaplaats and Ledig Erf.

Connect[edit]
As of July 2022, Utrecht has 5G from all Dutch carriers. Wifi is widely available in public places.

Stay safe[edit]
Utrecht as a student city is quite safe, although there are some neighbourhoods in the outskirts that you probably don't want to visit. As always, don’t flash your wallet at markets and have a natural caution for pickpockets in the city centre. Unfortunately, bike thefts are a common nuisance, so if you travel by bike, make sure you have good locks and park your bike at a bike parking spots. Parking your bike in the city centre is easy as Utrecht has it own bike parking route. Parking lots for bikes are located under the Vredenburg (entrance between Zara and The Sting), the Neude (Neudeflat), Zadelstraat, under the City Hall, under the stairs at the Stationsplein West or the Jaarbeursplein.
You are unlikely to have any business in the lower-income and immigrant neighbourhoods such as Kanaleneiland and Overvecht south-west and north of the city center. While serious crime rarely takes place, they are best avoided unless you want to tempt fate. If for some reason you do end up in these neighbourhoods it is strongly advised to keep your mobile phone and camera concealed. The youth in this area is known to act aggressively if they suspect they are being filmed or photographed.
