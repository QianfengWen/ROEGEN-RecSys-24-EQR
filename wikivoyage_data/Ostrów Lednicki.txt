Tourist information[edit]
 The Ostrow Lednicki Museum of the First Piasts, Dziekanowice 32, 62-261 Lednogóra, ☏ +48 61 427 50 10, fax: +48 61 427 50 20, sekretariat@lednicamuzeum.pl. 
Get in[edit]
By bus - an independent travel to Ostrow Lednicki seems to be quite challenging - there are just few daily connections to village called Dziekanowice, from where the island is accessible on foot. There are 3 buses to Poznan, 4 to Gniezno and 2 to some other surrounding villages, which have no meaning for tourists. It's much easier to get to the bus stop Dziekanowice-skrzyzowanie (pol.: crossing) which is located at the main road number 5, but from there one must walk more than 2 km to the island.
By train - numerous connections (depending on the day - up to 14 daily) to Lednogora (34 km from Poznan and 17 from Gniezno, 38 and 17 minutes ride respectively), from where one must walk appr. 3,5km. It's essential to know, that accelerated and Inter-Regio trains do not stop at the station (that's why the number of connections to Lednogora is smaller than to Gniezno).
By bike - cyclers can get in to Dziekanowice using a Piast Cycling Trail, starting in Poznan just next to the crossing of Jana Pawla str and Baraniaka str, nearby the shore of Malta Lake. cycling time (depending on speed and e.g. wind) 3-4 hours. An interesting option is to take your bike to train with you one way and come back by bike - all trains stopping at Lednogora are traditional electric trains with a big compartment for bikes.
By car - use the country road number 5 from Gniezno or Poznan, turn northwards at the monument of three ancient knights toward Dziekanowice, in the village - follow signs, soon on the left-hand side you'll see a big parking - 10 zlotys for coaches and 5 for cars.

Get around[edit]
From the parking you have to pass the ticket office, decline a little bit to the lake shore and use a ferry to get to the island. On the island it's allowed only to walk - no motor vehicles are let in.
