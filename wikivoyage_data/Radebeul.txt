Radebeul is a historic wine-growing town and residential suburb between Dresden and Meissen in Saxony, Germany.
It is essentially an affluent garden suburb of Dresden, but not officially within city limits. It is famous for the novelist Karl May, "father" of Winnetou and Old Shatterhand. Popular with Saxony's entrepreneurs and managers, Radebeul has become the richest town in Eastern Germany. It is near the Dresden microchip plants and the Dresden heath, the largest forest within Dresden's city limits. In 2021, it was home to 35,000 people.
