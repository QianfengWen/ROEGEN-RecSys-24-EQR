Eat[edit]
The epicenter of Athens culinary and bar scene is Downtown. This area is roughly defined by Broad Street in the South and Dougherty Street (which becomes Prince Avenue) in the North. The majority of restaurants will be located in this area, just north of UGA's campus.
There is also a small collection of restaurants, bars and stores centered around the area called "Five Points", where Milledge Avenue and Lumpkin Street intersect.
Normaltown is a neighborhood near Athens Regional Medical Center (corner of Oglethorpe and Prince) with a half dozen restaurants and shops. There is a strong Hispanic presence.
The normal American chain restaurants are scattered throughout Athens, with concentrations of them around the Beechwood Shopping Center (at the intersection of Baxter Street and Alps Road), near the Georgia Square Mall (at the intersection of Athen's circumnavigating perimeter highway, Loop 10 and the Atlanta Highway), and finally at the College Station Shopping Center (near the corner of Barnett Shoals Road and College Station Road).

 Five & Ten, 1635 S. Lumpkin Street, ☏ +1 706-546-7300. Dinner: Su-Th 5:30-10PM, F Sa 5:30PM-11PM; brunch: Su 10:30AM-2:30PM. One of the finest southeastern restaurants is in the Five Points neighborhood of Athens. There are not too many places in Georgia that serve sweetbreads in the first place, but Hugh Acheson shows his respect for place by serving them atop a grits custard. From $25. 
The National Started by the acclaimed chef at Five and Ten, the National offers inventive Tapas style dining.  Next door to Cine, sample wine, cheese and meats before catching a movie.
 Mama's Boy, 197 Oak Street, ☏ +1 706-548-6249. Daily 7AM-3:30PM. For a twist on Southern diner food, check out Mama's Boy. The crispy Buttermilk Fried Chicken Breast is served with a creamy bacon gravy. It is so good that you will sop it up with one of their dense, rich biscuits. From $8. 
The Last Resort, 184 W. Clayton (Downtown).  $12+.  A diverse menu of newer takes on traditional southern classics is supplemented by daily soup, quiche, fish and pasta specials.  Though the Last Resort is a great choice for dinner, it is perhaps the best Lunch spot in Athens.  The Fried Green Tomato sandwich topped with Vidalia-bacon salad dressing is a lunchtime favorite, while the praline chicken provides an excellent sweet yet savory dinner.  The wide array of cakes and pies are also of local fame and should certainly be sampled by visitors.
DePalma's  An Athens institution that offers traditional (if unspectacular) Italian fare.  Try the stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer followed by mix and match pasta of your choosing.  The calzones and pizza are also good.  A good choice for a group, the waiters and waitresses will keep the wine flowing.
Weaver D's  1016 E. Broad.  Meat and three vegetables, made famous by REM.
 White Tiger, 217 Hiawassee Ave, ☏ +1 706-363-0713. 
Cali-N-Tito's  A swanky mixture of Cuban and South American food, they have great sandwiches and other options. Their lunch special is a great deal, with a side and a drink. For drinks, they have good sweet tea or Coke. If you want beer or wine, you have to bring your own, this restaurant is BYOB. 1427 Lumpkin Street, this restaurant is located near the area called "Five Points".
Drink[edit]
One of the great drinking cities in the South, there are some truly great bars in Athens. Athens is a great place to waste away in a state of bachanalia. Some of the best bars are:

 The 40 Watt Club, 285 W. Washington Street, ☏ +1 706-369-8399. 
Georgia Theatre
 The Georgia Theatre, 215 N. Lumpkin Street, ☏ +1 706-549-9918. The Georgia Theatre is a premier music venue. The theatre is on the Athens Music History Walking Tour which is sponsored by the Athens Convention and Visitors Bureau. 18+ only/ID required. The theatre burned down in June 2009 and reopened in August 2011 with a rooftop bar. 
 The Manhattan, 337 North Hull Street, ☏ +1 706-369-9767. Athens. This dive is a place for grad students and professors to hang out at. Their drinks are generally fairly cheap and the conversation and decor fairly trendy. The decorations look like they all came from random buys at a thrift store, and several pictures of MLK and JKF hang on the wall as a tribute to the liberal leanings of the proprietors. Try the signature drink which is Maker's Mark and Blenheim's spicy ginger ale. Also, they provide free popcorn in the corner. 
Nowhere Bar is a popular spot for pool players, yet large enough to accommodate their less recreational friends who simply desire a place to drink.  The jukebox tends to alternate between classic rock favorites and Widespread Panic.
The Pub at Gameday Popular with students eager to avoid the Spring Break type atmosphere at "Bourbon Street" and "Generals."  A large and accessible bar, multiple televisions and wood paneling has ensured Gameday's status within the Athens social scene.
Allgood Usually attracts a different crowd than the townies, fratboys, and the freshmen.  The greatest aspect is the outdoor patio bar in back of the second story.  Though the bar is large, it is a tad narrow, so overcrowding can be a problem.
The Globe  A pub offering draft Belgium beers, English Ales and an extensive wine list that tends to attract an older, slightly more sophisticated crowd than nearby establishments.  Tables, couches and rocking chairs makes this a good place for those who seek to rediscover the lost art of conversation or simply enjoy quality beer. Voted one of the best bars in America by Esquire Magazine in 2010.
Normal Bar A local bar in Normaltown (on Prince near Oglethorpe) that attracts a neighborhood crowd. Go out back and sit by the fire pits with your dog.
 Trappeze Pub, 269 Washington St, ☏ +1 706-543-8997. Trappeze has over 30 beers on tap and well over 200 on their bottle menu. Trappeze doesn't sell any low-end domestic beers, such as Budweiser but does maintain an otherwise full bar and an extensive wine list. The food list is no less impressive with an interesting and delicious twist on typical pub-fare.
