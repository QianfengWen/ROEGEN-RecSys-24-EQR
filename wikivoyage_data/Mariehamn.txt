Mariehamn  is the capital, and the only town of the Åland islands. The town's Finnish name, Maarianhamina, is rarely used, as less than 6% of the population of 12,000 (2021) speaks Finnish.

History[edit]
A youthful town, Mariehamn was founded in 1861 while Åland and Finland formed part of the mighty Russian Empire. Maria, consort of Tsar Alexander II of Russia, gave the town her name. The name Mariehamn is Swedish for Maria's harbour.
Mariehamn grew up round the farming village of Övernäs, situated on a peninsula. The harbour's built-in sheltered bays came to be of great importance. The streets of Mariehamn are wide and straight. Housing sites were large from the beginning, but today they have been divided to provide space for several houses. A distinctive feature is the Esplanade, an avenue of lime (linden) trees stretching from west to east, from harbour to harbour.
The Russian heritage is mainly responsible for the layout of the town. It follows the same basic guidelines as can be found in many Russian cities, with large avenues with promenades in the middle of the street. Apart from that, the only Russian signs left from that era is the multitude of tombstones in the graveyards in Åland.
During the Russian times seafaring expanded from shipping local goods to Stockholm to global trade, continuing after the independence. Between the world wars Gustaf Erikson got famous by gradually buying most of the big sailing ships still left in the world, and successfully operating them. One of the former German P-liners acquired by him, Pommern, has become a symbol of Mariehamn. Many of the beautiful wooden houses were built by shipowners. Shipping still contributes considerably to the wealth of the town.

Get in[edit]
Mariehamn lies on a peninsula. The walk across is short, but by yacht the distance is considerable.

Mariehamn is well connected by cruise ferries: from Stockholm, Norrtälje, Turku, Helsinki, Tallinn, and occasionally even Riga. For those cruise ferries that call in Eckerö or Långnäs, there are buses to Mariehamn. Note that while a single bus trip from Långnäs harbour to Mariehamn costs only €2.50 in daytime, the night bus by Viking Line costs €19.
The airport is small, with flights mainly from Stockholm, Turku and Helsinki.
Mariehamn is a common first port for those arriving by yacht from Sweden.
NB! As Åland is outside European Union VAT area the customs regulations are different from normal traffic between EU countries. The amounts of alcohol and tobacco that are allowed in duty free import into EU apply also here, but free import of taxed EU products for personal use may not.

By plane[edit]
60.12194419.8963891 Mariehamn airport (MHQ  IATA) (less than 3 km (1.9 mi) north of Mariehamn, in Jomala). The only airport on the islands with scheduled flights. There are daily flights from Helsinki Airport, Turku and Stockholm Arlanda Airport. The flight from Helsinki is less than an hour and the flight from Turku or Stockholm is only half an hour. The flight from Stockholm crosses the time zone border and the return thus arrives before it departs. There is no airport bus.   
By ferry[edit]

The passenger port is at the western edge of the centre, in 60.092119.92892 Västerhamn, the Western Port. The terminal is open when a boat is due to leave. Facilities are limited. There are several lockers, toilets and a customs office. Just outside, there is a café and a small kebab restaurant. Visiting cruise ships have their own terminal 300 m north from the main terminal, facing the Adlon hotel and pizza restaurant.
There are a few cruise ferry services from Stockholm specifically to Mariehamn. The cruise ferries that travel between Turku and Stockholm in the day call in Mariehamn, while ferries passing in the night mostly call in Långnäs, 25 km away (with bus or taxi connection), as do the ferries between Kapellskär (Norrtälje, Greater Stockholm) and Turku or adjacent Naantali. There are also ferries from Grisslehamn (Norrtälje) to Eckerö, the shortest and cheapest passage, with bus connection to Mariehamn. The cruise ferries have tax-free sales, often slightly cheaper than the equivalent on-shore products.
There are buses between Stockholm, Uppsala and Norrtälje, often specifically connecting to the ferries.
It is possible to come island hopping with smaller ferries from Finland. This is much less straight-forward and not necessarily cheaper, but can be rewarding as an experience in itself. You end up in Långnäs or Vårdö, with bus connection to Mariehamn.
For the specific services, see Åland#Get in.

By yacht[edit]
For those with a yacht, Mariehamn is conveniently between Sweden and the Finnish mainland, with only a short passage over the Sea of Åland. There are two marinas, one in the west harbour (Västerhamn) and one in the east (Österhamn). The distance between them by sea is considerable, so know your plans. Åland has border control service, check procedures if you are arriving from outside Schengen, have a pet or otherwise need customs clearance (Åland is not in the EU VAT zone).

As of summer 2023 there are five local bus lines operated by Ålandstrafiken, and identified by direction: N for northern line, S for southern, Ö for eastern, and V for western. The J line drives south all the way to Järsö. The bus routes are circular, so do not be surprised if the bus does not return the same route as it arrived. The local transport hub is on Nygatan. Single ticket cost €2.5 (€1.25 for children 6-11 years old, children less than 6 yo free). The ticket is valid for 2 hours.

See[edit]
60.0971919.925241 Pommern, Västerhamn. Accessible daily May–September. By far the most popular attraction in the whole Åland! Pommern (earlier name Mneme) is a windjammer turned into a museum ship, kept in original shape, except arrangement for wheelchair access etc. She is a four-masted barque built at J. Reid & Co shipyard in Glasgow in 1903. She soon became one of the Flying P-Liners, the famous sailing ships of the German shipping company F. Laeisz. Later she belonged to Gustaf Erikson of Åland, who used her (and the rest of his windjammers) to carry grain from the Spencer Gulf area in Australia to harbours in England and Ireland until the outbreak of World War II. She was thus one of the last cargo-carrying large sailing ships. In 2018–2019, Pommern was placed into a dock, to lessen stress on her hull. Tickets to go aboard her are sold at the Åland Maritime Museum right next to the ship. Show the QR code you received from ticket office to the customer service on board.   (updated Aug 2020)

She ran aground off the coast of England in 1936 and before she sank her saloon was salvaged and brought to Åland. In the exhibition you will see all sorts of ship paraphernalia from sextants to sails, souvenirs sailors brought home from their travels, and learn about e.g. shipbuilding and the 19th century seaman's hotel in Mariehamn, and try out being a captain in the museum's ship simulator. One of the treasures here is an original 18th-century Jolly Roger! Also English literature for sale.

The islet and the pilot station have become an important symbol and a popular outing destination; they are owned by the city and there is an association caring for them. Museum and summer café.

Drink[edit]
Nightlife in Mariehamn is sparse and revolves around the two restaurants Dino's and Indigo – although heavily frequented by locals they don't compare well to establishments in larger cities. Between midnight and 02:00 those restaurants close, and almost everybody migrates to the nearby nightclub Oliven (formerly known as Arken). Considering Åland's history (a Swedish archipelago until 1809, then Russian and later Finnish since 1918 – Ålanders speak Swedish, they use some Russian expressions and they drink like Finns) the later hours are dominated by the occasional bar-brawl, heavily intoxicated teens and vomiting. The Oliven closes at 04:00, and then it's all over.

Stay safe[edit]
Crime is extremely low in Åland. The only prison (having 3 cells) was closed in 1975 and is nowadays a museum (see Sund). In statistics, the situation seems very different as drunken fights and assaults on cruise ships are recorded as occurring in Mariehamn!

60.115519.9332 Åland Central Hospital, Doktorsvägen 1, ☏ +358 18 5355. Åland Central Hospital offers medical care to both the local population and visitors. This is the only 24/7 general emergency clinic on these islands. Basic procedures are successful on site, but patients in need of more serious care will be sent by helicopter to university hospitals either to Turku in Finland or Uppsala in Sweden.
