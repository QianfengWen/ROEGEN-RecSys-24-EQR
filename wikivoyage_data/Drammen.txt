Bragernes Square.
Drammen is a city in Viken, previously Buskerud, 40 km (25 mi) southwest of Oslo. Drammen is where the Drammen river runs into the Drammensfjord, an arm of the Oslofjord. The part north of the river is called Bragernes, the part south of the river is called Strømsø. Drammen is promoted as "the river city". Drammen earlier had a reputation for being a grim industrial town. The city was also dubbed the biggest road intersection in Norway, due to the heavy traffic. Today the industry is gone or cleaned, and the traffic passes on highways outside the city. So Drammen today is a nice city, and a pleasant side-trip from Oslo. Or a destination of its own. The city has a long history as a centre for timber-trade and paper production. The paper mills however are closed today.
Drammen was created in 1811 when the small towns Bragernes and Strømsø were officially merged into one town.

By bus[edit]
Local buses are operated by Nettbuss.

By foot[edit]
The city centre is compact and easy to get around by foot. The river separates the two halves of the city. There are two main bridges for pedestrians: the old city bridge, which often carries heavy traffic, and the new Ypsilon bridge which is for pedestrians and cyclists only, and therefore makes a pleasant alternative. The city of Drammen has many walking paths along the river on both sides. These are very popular and pleasant. In addition, there are many walking trails in the hills behind the city, including the Zig-Zag path up to Spiralen, which is accessed just behind the main church.

Drammen Theatre.
The central square is Bragernes Torg, one of Europe's biggest town squares. It was laid out very wide after the great fire of 1866 to prevent future fires from spreading from one half of the city to the other. It has a small market on most days, and is the focal point for the city's pubs and clubs, with plenty of outdoor drinking in summer.
