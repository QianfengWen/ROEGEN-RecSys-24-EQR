Faial is an island in the Azores archipelago, an autonomous region of Portugal. Horta, the legislative capital of the Azores, is the sole municipality on the island. Faial is a tourist destination with a rich collection of historical, natural and modern attractions that attract yachts, cruise ships, tourist groups and the naturalists to the hills and streets of the island.
The visitor seeking sun will likely travel to the black sand beaches of Praia de Almoxarife, Conceição, and Porto Pim, as well as the rock pools scattered along the coast. Varadouro is one such place, known for its warmer waters, micro-climate, summer cottages and complicated salt-water pools open to the ocean.

Horta (OHR-tuh, /ˈoɾ.tɐ/), the capital of Faial (figh-AHL), /faj.ˈaɫ/), is the political and economic centre of the island and is famous for its sailing port. It is divided into 13 civil parishes (freguesias).
The island is 172 km2 (66 sq mi). The distance to the neighbouring island of Pico is only around 6 km (3.7 mi). The highest point is the 1,043 m (3,422 ft)-high Cabeço Gordo in the Caldeira.
The port of Horta is an important port of call for Atlantic sailors.
With its nearest neighbours, Pico (east across the channel) and São Jorge (northeast across the channel), it forms an area commonly known as the Triângulo (English: Triangle). The island has also been referred to as the Ilha Azul (English: Blue Island), derived from the writings of Portuguese poet Raul Brandão, due to the large quantity of hydrangeas that bloom during the summer months.

Climate[edit]
It has very mild winters for its latitude, in part due to its location in the mid-Atlantic Ocean and influence from the Gulf Stream, averaging 14 °C (57 °F) in its coldest month, February, and frosts never occur other than at high altitude. Summers are warm and relatively dry. 
Temperatures are moderated year-round, never too hot or too cold, daily temperatures are also moderated, with only 5 °C (41 °F) difference between highs and lows. Average relative humidity remains high at around 80% and insolation is relatively low with around 1,800–1,900 hours of annual sunshine. 
Precipitation is plentiful especially in the winter months, averaging 1,000 mm (39 in) annually. At higher altitudes (e.g. Cabeço Gordo) temperatures are cooler, precipitation and humidity are increasingly higher and fog is very common.

The road from the capital passes through Flamengos, the first village to be founded by European settlers. In its vicinity is the botanical garden. Also interesting is the trip along the "Ribeira dos Flamengos", a stream that crosses a very green valley. The descent into the crater is challenging and generally requires a local guide. You can observe the laurel forests that once covered the whole island. Once you have visited the Caldeira it is possible to descend in the direction of Praia Norte or in the area of ​​Capelo dominated by the lunar landscapes of the coast. The 3-km path, called "covered by Levada", is easily accessible. An extension of it begins near an artificial lake and penetrates through a tunnel inside a basaltic volcano "Cabeço dos Trinta" and then flows directly into the crater. Another excursion is to "Cabeço Gordo", the highest point of the island (1043 m) Which offers a panoramic view of the Caldeira.

While enlarging the land by 2.4 km², it spawned 300 seismic events, hurled ash 1 km, destroyed 300 houses in the parishes of Capelo and Praia do Norte and caused the evacuation of 2,000 people (many of whom emigrated to the US and Canada).

The Caldeira do Cabeco Gordo can be reached through a small pedestrian tunnel. A volcanic eruption in the sea in 1957 created a new small island that grew together with the main island and was called Capelinhos. There is an interesting, futuristic museum underground where you can find out about everything related to the volcanic eruption. In the capital Horta you can find very beautiful restored houses, and many Atlantic sailors have immortalized themselves with pictures on the quay walls.
