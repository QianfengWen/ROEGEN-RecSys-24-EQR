Canterbury is a cathedral and university city in Kent, in the South East of England. Canterbury Cathedral is the seat of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of All England and hence the Primus inter pares of the primates of each national church in the Anglican Communion and spiritual leader and senior clergyman of the Church of England.


Understand[edit]
Canterbury Cathedral


“

And specially, from every shires endeOf Engelond, to Caunterbury they wende,The hooly blisful martir for to seke, That hem hath holpen whan that they were seeke.

”


—Geoffrey Chaucer:  "General Prologue", The Canterbury Tales

Canterbury is a major tourist centre in the county of Kent. Even though it was bombed relentlessly during the Second World War (The Blitz), it still contains many ancient buildings, and modern building development within the medieval town centre is strictly regulated by officials at Canterbury.
As a result of the murder of Thomas Becket in 1170, Canterbury became a major centre of pilgrimage, the backdrop of Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, written in 1387 about pilgrims passing the time by sharing stories. There is a museum in Canterbury about the Tales.
Canterbury was founded as the Romano-Celtic town of Durovernum Cantiacorum. In the early Middle Ages, the city became known by the Anglo-Saxon name of Cantwarebyrig, meaning "fortress of the men of Kent".

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Canterbury is easily accessible from London by following the M2 south and east until it merges with the A2, linking Canterbury with Chatham, Gillingham and Sittingbourne to the north, and the port of Dover to the south. Another regional arterial road, the A28, travels eastwards to Margate, Broadstairs and Ramsgate and westwards to Ashford, the site of the Eurostar station for rail links to France, Belgium and the continent.
Excellent park and ride[dead link] facilities allow you to park inexpensively outside the city and take a bus into town. The parking fee is £3.50 per vehicle per day, or £1 if you arrive after 4PM, and entitles the driver and up to six car passengers to a round trip on the bus to and from the city centre.
There are three park and ride sites: 51.272171.0660551 Wincheap (to the west of the city centre), 51.261821.1017522 New Dover Road (to the south) and 51.2939631.1090513 Sturry Road (to the east). The buses stop at a number of intermediate stops between the park and ride car parks and the city centre. Park and ride buses run into the city centre every eight minutes between 7AM and 7:30PM Monday to Saturday. On Sundays, buses run every 15 minutes from New Dover Road and Sturry Road between 10AM and 6PM, but don't serve Wincheap at all.

By train[edit]
Old-fashioned signal box at Canterbury East.
Canterbury is served by two railway stations. Fare and timetable information are available from Southeastern, +44 8457 484950:

51.2840641.0753811 Canterbury West, Station Rd W, Canterbury CT2 8AN (4-minute walk from the city centre). The journey time to Canterbury West from London St Pancras (the closest Eurostar station to the Channel Tunnel) is just under one hour on the High Speed service. There are also services from Tonbridge, Ashford and Ramsgate.   
51.2742441.0759282 Canterbury East, Station Rd E, CT1 2RB (8-minute walk from the city centre). Alternatively, the service from London Victoria to Canterbury East is between 90 minutes and two hours. The advantage of this is that it's about £5 cheaper than the high-speed line, but the price difference is not great enough to justify the longer journey.  There are also services from Chatham, Faversham and Dover Priory.   
By bus[edit]
National Express operate coaches to Canterbury from London Victoria Coach Station and also from Dover.

By plane[edit]
Canterbury does not have its own airport. The nearest major international airports to Canterbury are London Gatwick (LGW IATA) about 66 mi (106 km) away and London Heathrow (LHR IATA), about 96 mi (154 km) away.

On foot[edit]
It is recommended to walk as the town centre is quite compact; it takes only 10 min to walk down the semi-pedestrianised high street.

By bicycle[edit]
Cyclists are welcome in Canterbury; the first stage of the 2007 Tour de France finished in the city. However, dedicated cycle paths are relatively few. Local bike shop Downland Cycles (www.downlandcycles.co.uk) is located on the London-bound platform of Canterbury West train station. It offers bike rentals and sales. It also gives advice on how best to see the city by bike, having put together several good guides to local rides, including on road, off road, and dedicated path routes.

By bus[edit]
Canterbury is well-served by buses which terminate at the main bus station at the end of the high street. Buses serve most destinations in East Kent. Stagecoach Coaches can be picked up from the bus station to London, Whitstable, Herne Bay, Greenhill, Swalecliffe and Chestfield, Margate and Sturry (these are all small towns close to Canterbury). Buses run regularly during the day however services are less frequent in the evenings.  Bus timetables can be found on the Stagecoach Buses website.

By taxi[edit]
Taxis in Canterbury are regulated by the city council. Charges are imposed uniformly by this regulation. Thus, £2.50 is the minimum charge for all taxis operating under the City Council of Canterbury.
For hiring between midnight and 7AM, an additional 50% is levied.
Taxis can be picked up at the train stations, outside the bus station, at the southern end of the high street and by the Westgate Towers in the evenings.

The Quire in Canterbury Cathedral
Canterbury has an interesting mix of architectural styles, from genuine Tudor buildings to 1960s style office buildings. However there are architectural gems around every corner. There is no coherent style to the buildings as much of the city was demolished during bombing raids in World War II, but much has survived. The Canterbury Cathedral, St Augustine's Abbey, and St Martin's Church are inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
The Dane John Gardens (by the city walls and around the corner from the Whitefriars development) are full of surprises, hosting events almost every weekend during the summer months.  Examples include French and farmers markets with all types of cuisine.
The subways on the east end of the main street have many paintings related to the Canterbury Tales.

Drink[edit]

Due to the layout of the city, it is possible to walk down its numerous small streets and find a great place for a drink.
