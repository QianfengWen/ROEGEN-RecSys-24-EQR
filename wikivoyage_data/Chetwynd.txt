Understand[edit]
Chetwynd chainsaw carvings.
Chetwynd is a district municipality in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in northeastern British Columbia. Situated on an ancient floodplain, it is the first town eastbound travellers encounter after emerging from the Rockies along Highway 97. The town developed during the construction of infrastructure through the Rocky Mountains in the 1950s, and was used as a transshipment point during the construction of hydroelectric dams in the 1960s and 1970s and the new town of Tumbler Ridge in the early 1980s. The town's population has increased little if at all since the 1980s but is significantly younger than the provincial average.
Once known as Little Prairie, the community adopted its current name in honour of provincial politician Ralph L.T. Chetwynd, just prior to its incorporation in 1962. The 64-km² (25 sq mi) municipality consists of the town, a community forest, and four exclave properties.
