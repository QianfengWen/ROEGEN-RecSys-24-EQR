Gullane is 20 miles east of Edinburgh on A198, which hugs the coast of the Firth of Forth north of A1. Exit A1 at Haddington and follow A6137 north to Aberlady then join A198 east into town. Bicycles aren't allowed on the new A1, use the scenic route along A198 winding through the coastal villages.
East Coast Buses X5 and 124 run from Edinburgh Fountainbridge along Princes St (close to but not into the bus station) then via Musselburgh along the coast road to Gullane, continuing to North Berwick. They run daily every 30-60 min, taking around 80 min. Night bus N124 runs the same route shortly after midnight Friday and Saturday then at 3AM. 
The nearest railway station is at North Berwick 3 miles east. This has hourly trains from Edinburgh which also stop at Drem 2 miles south of Gullane.

Get around[edit]
The buses to North Berwick run through Dirleton, which is on an old loop of road 200 yards (190 m) north of the bypass.

56.038-2.8441 Gullane Bents are the sands and dunes of Gullane Beach. By car take Sandy Lane, 2nd left after entering the village from the west, which leads to a large car park. There's a broad curve of golden sands, with rocks at the eastern end and low cliffs to the west. The dunes, which in the 20th century were just blowing sand, are becoming grown over as the council has stabilised them. This may have been overdone, as there's nowadays quite a thicket of blackthorn.
56.0141-2.8442 Luffness Castle was originally built in the 12th century but smashed up on several occasions. The present version is mostly 19th century and is a private family home, no tours.

John Muir Way is a long-distance coastal trail. The route is obvious both ways: eastbound follow the shore by Yellowcraigs into North Berwick, and onward to Tantallon Castle, Dunbar, and the cliffs of Berwickshire. Westbound leads you to Luffness and Aberlady, a bird reserve; you can't short-cut across this bay as it's muddy. The trail continues east via Craigielaw and Seton Sands to Musselburgh.
56.0417-2.8281 Muirfield Golf Course (The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers), Duncur Rd, Muirfield EH31 2EG, ☏ +44 1620 842123. Visitors only Tu and Th. The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers wrote the first recorded rules of the game in 1744 when they were based at Leith Links. They moved to Muirfield in 1891 and the course regularly hosts the Open. Visitor bookings are taken up to a year in advance and fill up quickly. The course is 6728 yards, par 70. 18-hole round Nov-Mar £150, Apr-Oct £340.   (updated May 2024)
56.0291-2.85022 Gullane Golf Club, West Links Rd EH31 2BB, ☏ +44 1620 843767. Three 18-hole links courses, plus a children's course. Courses 1 (laid 1884; 6162 yards par 71) and 2 (laid 1898; 5976 yards par 71) have been used for qualifying for the Open Championship. No 3 (laid 1910, 5259 par 68) is shorter but still challenging. Much easier to get a round here than at Muirfield, but you should still book in advance. The three main courses all start from the clubhouse at the west end of the village. The children's course is accessed from the old village green, just east along Main St. (updated May 2024)
Other courses nearby are Luffness, Craigielaw and Kilspindie towards Aberlady, and Archerfield near Dirleton.
