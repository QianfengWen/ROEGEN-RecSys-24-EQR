Estes Park is a town in the Front Range region of the state of Colorado in America.  It is located 90 miles northwest of Denver, on the eastern slope of the Front Range in north central Colorado. Estes Park sits at the east entrance to Rocky Mountain National Park.


Understand[edit]
"Park" in this case is a term that means a valley or meadow.  Estes Park is named after an early settler, Joel Estes, who attempted to make a living by farming.  Because of the short growing season it never really worked out.  Since the mid-1800s the main business of Estes Park has been tourism.  The clientele ranges from hard-core backcountry types to tour-buses full of drive through sightseers.  The main draw is the scenery, which is awesome.
Year-round population is approximately 6,000 people, adding the surroundings it may be 10,000.  In the peak of tourist season that probably triples.  The best time to visit for outdoor activities is July through September. Everyone else thinks so too, so it can get kind of crowded.  The heaviest traffic is probably in August.  The family/kids crowd thins out after Labor Day.
Winter is a charming time of the year as well, since it is an excellent time to go snow shoeing and cross country skiing.  Winter also provides greater opportunities to enjoy the tranquility of the Rocky Mountains as there are fewer tourists.
Winter weather is warmer than most mountain towns.  But summer is also short.  Summer temps peak in the low 90's(F) in town, much cooler as elevation increases.  If you plan on spending any time out of your car up on Trail Ridge Road take a jacket.  Estes is in a dry zone, getting maybe 13-15 inches of moisture a year.  During the summer the regular weather pattern is clear mornings with a buildup of clouds at midday and sometimes a short rain shower.
Elevation in town is 7,522 feet above sea level.  Some people experience discomforts due to altitude.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
4 main routes:

West from Loveland, CO via US-34, approximately 30 miles
Northwest from Lyons, CO via US-36 approximately 25 miles
North from Golden / Black Hawk / Central City / Boulder through Allenspark, CO via CO-7
East from Grand Lake, CO via US-34 over Trail Ridge Road through Rocky Mountain National Park. This route is seasonal (it usually opens at the end of May and closes sometime in October depending on the snowfall) and you will have to pay an entrance fee to get through the National Park.
By plane[edit]
The closest major airport is DIA in Denver, about 90 miles away.  A shuttle service or limo service to Estes can be obtained.
There are small airports in Boulder, Longmont and Loveland/Fort Collins.

Get around[edit]
The town is small and can be covered reasonably well by walking.  Most tourist visitors have their own car.  You can park in one of the city lots (free) and walk a couple of blocks to get downtown.
Estes Park has a free shuttle bus system that begins at the Visitor Center and has stops in Rocky Mountain National Park and a variety of stops in town.
There is some provision for bicycles.  Paved trails radiate out from Lake Estes toward the south and west.  But the part of the trail that goes downtown is restricted to walking only.  Cycling on the main roads is OK, but shoulders can be sparse.  Be careful of "tourist drivers" who will perform strange unpredictable maneuvers.
Transport within the National Park is mostly by private vehicle or by the shuttle bus service between the Moraine Park/Bear Lake areas.  The shuttle bus service between the Estes Park Visitors Center and Rocky Mountain National Park is free, but you must to purchase a National Parks pass prior to entering Rocky Mountain National Park.  There is an automated machine available at the Visitor's Center from which you can purchase 7-day or annual passes.
Hitchhiking can sometimes be effective particularly if you look like you are making an effort and have good personal hygiene.  Speaking of hygiene, the laundromat in upper Stanley village also sells showers.

Buy[edit]
This place has been a tourist destination since day one and numerous stores exist allowing you to outfit yourself for camping, hiking, fishing, biking or just about any other outdoor activity.  In addition, there are quite a few fine art galleries as well as stuffed-bear stores, Christmas ornament stores, cowboy hat stores, and two Starbucks.  Options also exist for those looking for T-shirts and "rubber tomahawks".
For groceries, it's Country Market or Safeway and prices are comparable to the front range area.  Car/RV service, parts and repair are available but somewhat limited.  Gas prices are usually 10 cents/gallon higher than Loveland or Longmont.  There is no WalMart, so for odd items you may need to go to one of the hardware stores or to the sundries aisle at Safeway.
