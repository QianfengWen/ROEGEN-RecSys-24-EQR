Lion's Head is a small town in Bruce County, Ontario, Canada.


Understand[edit]
Lion's Head is about halfway up the scenic Bruce Peninsula. It is named for a (now partially-collapsed) natural rock formation resembling a lion on the face of the cliffs abutting the town. Though with a winter population of only about 1,000, the town explodes in the summer with seasonal residents and visitors. Hours from the nearest major urban settlement, and abutting the massive Georgian Bay, the area features southern Ontario's darkest night skies.


Lion's Head is a popular but crowded place for stargazing, hiking, and water activities. The number of tourists, at times, overwhelms available parking, tourist facilities, and the beach. Parking between the marina and the beach is often strained. Many visitors make Lion's Head their base to explore the wider region, including nearby Tobermory, which in peak season is often jam-packed or even totally sold out.

Climate[edit]
The area has four somewhat distinct seasons. Cold, snowy, and blustery winters, as well as warm, comfortable summers are the usual pattern. Summer mornings are usually cool but do warm quickly before 9 or 10AM. Rain showers are common, along with thunderstorms, and a few severe thunderstorms per year. Tornadoes are less likely in the region, unlike the far southern part of Ontario.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Lion's Head Lighthouse
Lion's Head is approximately 3½ hr northwest of Toronto. It can be accessed by taking Highway 410/10 through Brampton, Orangeville, and Shelburne, then highway 6 near Owen Sound to the Bruce Peninsula.  The stretch of Highway 6 on the peninsula has seen a big increase in traffic. Speeding is an increasing problem as are accidents.

By bus[edit]
The Parkbus from Toronto to Tobermory, which operates sporadically on weekends in the summer, stops in Lion's Head in both directions. Owen Sound, approximately 1 hr to the south, is regularly served by GOST buses from Guelph. Owen Sound often has car rentals available for further transport, or a taxi to Lion's Head is about $100.
Bruce Peninsula Transit cancelled its scheduled bus service in June 2018.

On foot[edit]
The 885-km Bruce Trail from Niagara Falls to Tobermory along the Niagara Escarpment passes through Lion's Head.

Do[edit]
Climbing[edit]
 Rock Climbing. There is a wide variety of rock climbing and bouldering routes along the Lion's Head section of the Niagara Escarpment. Many have pre-installed metal loops. There's a little bit of a legal grey zone, so most professional guide outfits won't take you to the escarpment. If you're going without a guide, you should be sufficiently trained and experienced. Be sure to consult widely within the rock climbing community and carefully inspect any pre-installed equipment. Never tie your ropes around trees; this is endangering ancient cedars in the escarpment area and risks getting rock climbing strictly banned. (updated Aug 2017)
