Ilorin is the capital city of Kwara state in North Central Nigeria. In 2020, it was home to an estimated 950,000 people.


Understand[edit]
The city is a confluence of cultures, populated by the Fulani, Yoruba, Hausa, Nupe, Bariba and Kanuri tribes from across Nigeria, as well as foreign nationals. The city retains a strong Islamic influence, although Christianity is now widely practised in the cosmopolitan part of the city due to the significant immigration of people from other parts of Kwara State and the rest of Nigeria.
English is commonly spoken and understood among the populace. However, Yoruba is the mother tongue of much of the people, and Hausa speakers may be found in some areas, particularly among roadside sellers of food and vegetables.
Modern Ilorin is specially inhabited with the aid of using Muslim Yoruba people, even though its conventional ruler is a Yoruba-speakme Fulani emir. Surrounding the anciently significant district with its conventional single-tale red-dust homes with thatched straw roofs and several mosques, all blanketed with the aid of using a dust wall, the present day town is a business, commercial, and academic centre. It is a prime marketplace for domestically raised crops (yams, cassava, maize, sorghum, millet, rice, peppers, peanuts, shea nuts, kola nuts, cotton) and for cattle, hides, and poultry. Local handicrafts consist of pottery making, timber carving, leather-based working, fabric weaving, and mat and basket weaving. The developing business quarter now consists of sugar refining, meals processing, soft-drink bottling, in shape and cleaning soap manufacturing, and ironworking. There are numerous banks and coverage agencies that serve the town and state.
The city is home to the University of Ilorin and the Kwara State Institute of Technology. Near the city is the Federal Institute of Agricultural and Rural Business Administration, which operates a research company. Colleges of education and  vocational schools also serve Ilorin. Medical services include many government, private and religious hospitals, as well as nursing homes for the elderly. 
Ilorin operates by rail and highway from Lagos (260 miles south-southwest) via Ibadan, which intersects the city, and  has an international airport.

By train[edit]
Rail services in Nigeria are still very slow and unreliable but several routes have reappeared. Nigerian Railway Corporation have daily services from Ilorin via Ibadan, and an overnight service from Kano via Kaduna a few times per week. A new higher speed railway is under construction and is expected to be completed in the 2020s, resulting in increased speeds and frequency.

By bus[edit]
Several bus companies like Young Legacy, Mufsuf Motors, Kasmag line, Okin Express  offers daily services from almost all major cities (Lagos, Ibadan, Abuja, Kaduna, Kabba, Lokoja, Sokoto, Kano, Makurdi, etc.)  around the country. While buses usually are quite comfortable, journey times are very long.
There are also independent transporters under the aegis of the national union of road transport workers (NURTW)  and road transport employees association of Nigeria (RTEAN) in various parks, such as Post Office, Offa garage, and Maraba who travel to various towns within and outside the state.

Get around[edit]
Map of Ilorin
There are three modes of transiting within the State, which also extends to the region – the most popular being the conventional taxis. There are the commercial motor bicycles commonly called “Express”, and the more recent arrival on Ilorin’s roads, “Keke NAPEP”, imported commercial tricycles.
If travelling around Ilorin, be sure to be accompanied by a tourist guide who is familiar with the routes. For the most part, it's safe to move about during the day. If you are going out at night, be sure to go in groups, and stick to known routes.

By bus[edit]
Ilorin now has decent mass transit buses, courtesy of the Maigida Soludero Mass Transit (MST) schemes. The MST buses have their major terminal at Post Office area of Ilorin, and offer travel services to the University of Ilorin, Offa garage, Kwara State Polytechnic, Tanke, Oyun, and Sango. The tickets for the MST can be purchased at the bus stops before boarding. Tickets range from ₦50-150, as of 2021.

By car[edit]
The road network of Ilorin city for most part is good, but there is sometimes traffic congestion and parking spaces can be scarce, especially during working hours. Be sure to be on the lookout for road signs, in order to avoid entering one-way roads or streets. KWARTMA (Kwara State Road Traffic Management Authority) is the body responsible for managing traffic in most of the traffic congestion areas. Make sure to follow traffic rules. There are car parks around in hotels and shopping malls, most of which provide free and safe parking.

By taxi[edit]
One of the easiest ways to get around Ilorin city is by taxi. Taxis are relatively cheap and cost about ₦50-100 per drop. Ilorin city taxis are painted green and yellow and most of them are Mazda cabs.

By motorbike[edit]
For traveling short distances, you can use motorbike taxis called Okada. These motorbikes are quick, cheap, and save a lot of walking. Okada accidents are common but safety equipment is now provided because the state government and the Federal Road Safety Commission have mandated it. Before you try and negotiate any transportation fare, always confirm the fare from a local. If you have a Nigerian friend, let them negotiate for you as the quoted fare differs greatly for locals and foreigners. 
Safety helmets are a must at all times for both the rider and passenger. Majority of the times these are ill-fitting.

See[edit]
The city also has a range of tourist attractions such as the Sobi Hill which is said to have offered protection to natives during intertribal wars in ancient times. The Okuta Ilorin is located in Asaju's compound, Idi-Ape Quarters. It is the stone on which Ojo Isekuse, one of the founders of the city, used to sharpen his metal tools. It was actually called "Okuta ilo irin" (meaning stone for sharpening metals). It is from this tool, the town Ilorin derived its name. The stone was a deified object of worship, and sacrificial offerings were made to it in the past.
Pottery is a big business in Ilorin. The city has the biggest traditional pottery workshops in Nigeria. They are located in the Dada area of Okelele, Eletu in Oju-Ekun, Okekura, Oloje, Abe Emi and Ita Merin.
The traditional textile industry also thrives in Ilorin. In various parts of the city, aso-oke, textiles hand-woven on simple looms, are made in large quantities. Aso-oke is purchased by traders and fashion designers from Kwara State, other parts of Nigeria and abroad.
The cultural centre houses the Kwara State Council for Arts and Culture, its performing troupe, and a gallery with artworks and antiquities. Souvenirs of cultural and historical values are also available.

Stay safe[edit]
In general, Ilorin has become a much safer place to visit than before, except for occasional clashes and violence, the state of security in the city has relatively improved with the state spending huge budgets on security with police patrol cars, CCTV cameras (though this isn't always the case). But beware of deals or businesses that sound too good to be true (especially e-mails soliciting your help), and do not openly flaunt your possessions, especially in public places.
While it is rare for a tourist to be a victim of a violent crime, it is still wise to stay safe and be alert, especially during late night outings. Stick to crowded streets and make sure to go out in groups as against going out alone.
The people of Ilorin are generally nice and friendly people, most of whom will readily offer directions to you if you are lost.
