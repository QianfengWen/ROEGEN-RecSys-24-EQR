Balancán is a small city of about 14,000 people (2020) in the Mexican state of Tabasco in the Yucatán Peninsula. The town saw upheaval and conflict through the colonial era with the local Maya community resisting Spanish invaders. Outsiders meet a considerably warmer reception today and the town is a good stop for eco-travelers interested in the region's many rainforests as well as travelers exploring Maya civilization who will want to visit the Moral Reforma archaeological zone and the Museo José Gómez Panaco in town.


Understand[edit]
Balancán (officially known as Balancán de Domínguez, though nobody outside the government actually uses the long name) is a colonial era city with Mayan flavor.

History[edit]
The local area was originally settled by the Maya around the 5th century AD, when it was known as Tatahuitalpan. Hernan Cortes visited the town in 1525 but the locals had burned the town to the ground and fled when they got word of the approaching Spanish forces. Another Spanish expedition in 1529 was repulsed by the Maya and any Spaniards who survived fled the area. The Mayas rebuilt the town in 1530 at its current site. Spanish expeditions in the 16th and early 17th century were similarly unsuccessful. It would not be until 1671 that the Spanish would exert control over the area.
The town saw violence again during the Mexican Revolution when federal troops tried to occupy Balancan. The city was defended by rebel troops under the leadership of Colonel Jose Dominguez. The town's official name is a tribute to the good Colonel.

The "Double Pyramid", Building 14 at Moral Reforma

Moral Reforma is one of the many ancient Mayan cities that remain off the radar of most travelers (and even most archaeologists). The ruins are more than 2,000 years old and possibly established around 300-250 BC. It was once under the dominion of Calakmul, but around 600 AD, fell under the domainion of Palenque. The site's architecture has elements of both Puuc and Rio Bec styles.
The site is operated by Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH). In the early 2020s INAH received a large funding increase to upgrade visitor facilities at Mayan sites near the route of the new Tren Maya railway, being built to improve transportation throughout the region. One of INAH's projects was to better explore, restore, and upgrade the Moral-Reforma site. During their work in early 2023, archaeologists discovered a large ceremonial burial site beneath a pyramid known as Structure 18. Human remains of 13 young men were recovered. The bones were determined to be more than 2,000 years old (dated to around 250 BC). Skulls showed signs of ritual decapitation. Anthropologists believe the young men were sacrificed as part of the dedication of the new temple.
About 7 buildings have been explored and restored. Building 14 is the site's most impressive structure. It's known as the "Double Pyramid" because it is two pyramids, built side-by-side, each with its own staircase. The site also has a restored ballcourt and several restored temples and platforms. There are a number of visible mounds that obviously hide other structures so it is likely that the site will grow in significance as it is explored and developed by INAH.

17.769234-91.2982051 Moral Reforma Archaeological Zone, El Juncal, Balancán. Daily 09:00 - 17:00. One of the least visited Mayan sites.

There is no nearby town. A small waterfall, Cascada de la Reforma Moral is about 500 meters from the archaeological site. Free. (updated Dec 2023)
Wanha´ Biosphere Reserve[edit]
In 2023, the Mexican government announced that it was creating a new Biosphere Reserve that would comprise the river systems and wetlands in the state of Tabasco near Balancan and Tenosique. The new biosphere reserve protects an area of 38,255 hectares along the San Pedro River. The reserve protects mangrove, tular, reed, cypress and many bird species such as elegant eagle, mallard and yellow-headed parrot, among others. The reserve includes ecosystems such as high evergreen, high or medium subevergreen forests, and hydrophilic vegetation (the habitat of more than 892 species of flora and fauna, with a high diversity of aquatic birds). The ecosystem is unique in the world because the swamps are in a river system far from the sea, it is the world's furthest inland mangrove swamp (120 kilometers from the coast).
