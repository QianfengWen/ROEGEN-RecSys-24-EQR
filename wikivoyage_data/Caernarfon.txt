Caernarfon castle
Caernarfon is a Royal town in Gwynedd, North-West Wales.
Caernarfon is famous for its breathtaking castle and as a stronghold of the Welsh language. The castle and fortified complex is recognised on the UNESCO World Heritage List as one of the finest examples of late 13th-century and early 14th-century military architecture in Europe. It is one of the best places in the world to hear a living Celtic language, with over 80% of the local population speaking Welsh.
Caernarfon provides a good base for visiting other places of interest in North Wales. A few miles’ drive from Caernarfon is Snowdonia National Park which plays host to the highest mountain in Wales, and Anglesey, home of Beaumaris Castle, the last and largest of the castles to be built by King Edward I in Wales.
Other nearby places worth visiting include: Conwy, Llandudno, the Isle of Anglesey, Bangor, and the castle at Harlech.
Opposite the castle, the  Caernarfon Tourist Information Centre, Oriel Pendeitsh, Castle St, ☏ +44 1286 672232, caernarfon.tic@gwynedd.gov.uk. , makes a great port of call, offering free local advice for getting the most out of a visit to Caernarfon and its surrounding areas.
