Go Ahead Bus 120 runs hourly, daily from Dublin, taking two hours. It starts from Connolly railway station and picks up at other city stops including Heuston station, but not Busáras. Don't take 120B or 120F, these only run to Newbridge.
Bus 120C runs from Tullamore to Edenderry (1 hour) and Enfield, with five or six daily. Buses stop outside Town Hall and elsewhere along the main road.
By road from Dublin follow M4 to junction 9 at Enfield, then R402 into town.
Edenderry is linked by a spur to the Grand Canal, part of the navigable network extending to Dublin, Waterford, Limerick and Enniskillen. Check Waterways Ireland for current status of locks, moorings and so on.

The town is easy to walk round, but you need wheels for outlying sights. A bike would do.

See[edit]
Town hall was built as the market hall, and is now a courthouse. It is a handsome building of 1826 in O'Connell Square.
53.339-7.0521 Blundell Castle is a scrappy ruin, unstable and fenced off. It was wrecked in 1691 by Jacobite forces, defeated at the Battle of the Boyne and retreating towards Limerick, while James II himself scuttled back to France.
The canal is a scenic 1.5-km spur of the Grand Canal, with a footpath along its east bank. The Blundell family sought to keep the canal and those ruffian "navvies" away from town, but their lands passed to the 3rd Marquess of Downshire, who paid £692 for the spur. It boosted trade and growth of the town, as building masonry could be brought in more easily. It remains in use by pleasure craft.
53.361667-6.9688892 Carbury Castle  is the prominent ruin of a Tudor mansion built over a Norman motte-and-bailey. There's an old graveyard and mausoleum adjacent.
53.275-6.9463 Lullymore Heritage Park and the Bog of Allen Nature Centre are across the boundary, see County Kildare.
53.347-7.2784 Croghan Hill rears up to the west: see Tullamore#See.
