Hafnarfjörður (literally, harbour fjord) is a town in Southwest Iceland with a population of 30,000. The town was built atop lava fields that erupted 12,000 years ago. Hafnarfjörður was first settled in the late 14th century, a long history as a town by Icelandic standards, although today it is considered a suburb of Reykjavík. Hafnarfjörður is the westernmost town in the contiguous urban area of the capital.


Understand[edit]
Strandgata, "beach street"
Hafnarfjörður is in many ways dominated by its neighbour Reykjavík. However, it is also a separate town with its own centre and independent town spirit. It forms a sort of second centre of gravity in the greater Reykjavík area (or the greater Hafnarfjörður area as some locals call it), with most of the suburbs having formed between these two towns. The name of the town means harbour-fjord and Hafnarfjörður has a large harbour, used both for imports, exports and fishing. It also has some of the most important industrial areas around the capital.
The old town of Hafnarfjörður is what most people come to see. Despite its growth and becoming part of the much larger capital area, Hafnarfjörður retains a village charm in its heart, with small wooden buildings and narrow winding streets. You get the feeling of a place where everybody knows their neighbours.
One of the things that has helped Hafnarfjörður retain this status is how the town is planned and built around nature. It sits in the middle of a lava field, and in many places the lava formations have remained untouched, giving the town a very organic feel to it. This is what gives Hafnarfjörður the nickname "the town in the lava," and it is also partly because of this that the town has become associated with legends of the Icelandic elves.

Get in[edit]
There are two main ways of reaching Iceland, by plane or by boat. Keflavík international airport is 39 km from Hafnarfjörður.

By boat[edit]
Several cruise liners stop in Hafnarfjörður each summer, arriving close to the city centre.
Hafnarfjörður is not served by any ferries, but if you have an abundance of time it is possible to take the Smyril Line from Hirsthals in Denmark to Seyðisfjörður (a small town on the east of Iceland), via Tórshavn. This service is on the expensive side, and puts you on the other side of the country. From there, follow road 93 to Egilsstaðir and then turn into road 1. You will have a choice of taking an 658 km northern route or an 700-km southern route.

Route 1 operates every 15–20 minutes. The main interchange is called Fjörður. Bus prices are 400 kr within the capital area.

Do[edit]
Hafnarfjörður has marketed itself well as the town of the Icelandic elves. This is understandable, given the local nature and the close proximity between human habitation and lava rocks. Several companies offer tours visiting the homes of the elves and listening to stories about them. The town is also becoming increasingly popular in December for its Christmas Village, open in the centre of town during weekends that month. People frequently come from Reykjavík and other towns in the Southwest to do some of their Christmas shopping.
There are several good options for outdoor activities around the edges of Hafnarfjörður. You can go hiking on the town mountain Helgafell or take a walk around the lake Hvaleyrarvatn. Íshestar offer horse riding tours from their stables on the outskirts of town.

Festivals[edit]
There are two annual festivals in Hafnarfjörður that can make for an interesting visit:

 Bjartir dagar (Bright Days). An arts and culture festival held annually for a weekend around the beginning of June to coincide with the national celebrations of the Seamen's Day (the first Monday in June). 
 Viking festival (Víkingahátíð). Every summer Hafnarfjörður is host to a Viking festival, where people dress up in viking costumes, fight with viking weapons, etc. There is a market with craftsmen selling their viking-like wares. 
 Seaman’s Day Festival (Sjómannadagurinn). ‘Sjómannadagurinn’ means Seaman’s Day. The day is a public holiday in Iceland and a celebration of the fishing industry.

Stay safe[edit]
Safety concerns in Hafnarfjörður are mostly the same as in other towns and cities, but Hells Angels have set up base in Iceland - in Hafnarfjörður to be precise. Their headquarters are in an industrial area in the southwest of town, and although it's unlikely anything will happen to you if you're not involved in criminal activities yourself, it's a good idea to stay away.

Go next[edit]
Apart from getting on the next bus to Reykjavík, there are several options to get out from Hafnarfjörður. You could take the road south towards the lake Kleifarvatn and Krýsuvík, a geothermal area on the south coast of Reykjanes which in fact belongs to the municipality of Hafnarfjörður. You could also drive west on Reykjanesbraut towards Keflavík (about 20 minutes away) and the other towns on the Reykjanes peninsula, or even go on a trip to the Blue Lagoon.
