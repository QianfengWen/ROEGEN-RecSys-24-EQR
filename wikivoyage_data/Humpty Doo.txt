Humpty Doo is a small town in the Top End of the Northern Territory not far from Darwin on the road to Kakadu National Park.


Understand[edit]
You will drive by Humpty Doo on the road to Kakadu, or if taking one of the several jumping crocodile tours on the river.  The town itself is a very short deviation off the main road, and has a general store, pub, cafe.  Reasonable spot to stop for a lunch, supplies or a beer.  Not much in the town itself.  Don't overestimate its size by the font on the map.  It is close to several national attractions.

Get in[edit]
Along the Arnhem Highway, less than a one hour drive from Darwin via the A15 Tiger Brennan Drive, A1 Stuart Highway and the A36 Arnhem Highway. There is a scheduled bus service from Palmerston in Darwin, but it is mainly a school service, and is unlikely to be convenient for a traveller.

Get around[edit]
In practice you will need to have a car, or be on a tour to get around this area.  It is hard to imagine anybody wanting to be in Humpty Doo for long with no transport.

Fogg Dam birdlife
Fogg Dam.  Not far from Humpty Doo, you can drive along a narrow road across the dam, to several bird hides.  The diversity of birdlife is quite amazing, even for those who are not avid birdwatchers.  Make sure you take your best camera for some excellent shots, including a telscopic lens if you have one.  4-wheel drive is not required.  No entry fee, and as long as you miss the occasional coach tour, there are no concerns with crowds.

Drink[edit]
Humpty Doo Pub.  Hasn't quite got the feel of the Adelaide River Hotel, but if you are passing by and fancy a beer it is perfectly good.

There aren't any hotels or motels in Humpty Doo. The nearest good ones are in Darwin.
