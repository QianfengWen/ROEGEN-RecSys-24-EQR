Understand[edit]
The Memorial Church in Grand-Pré
The village was founded in 1682 and quickly became the breadbasket and principal town of Acadia. It was later abandoned by the colonial government because it was too far from Port-Royal. It was ravaged in 1704 and fell to the British in 1713, the village became a victim to the struggle for control of North America. It briefly returned to French control following the 1747 Battle of Grand-Pré with the population deported by the British in the fall of 1755. New England Planters settled in the village from 1760.
Today, Grand-Pré is a small village that has become a national historic site, celebrating its history and heritage, considered by many to be the historical and spiritual heart of Acadia. The site has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 30 June 2012.
