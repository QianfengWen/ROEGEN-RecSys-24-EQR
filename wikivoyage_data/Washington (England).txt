Washington is a town in Tyne and Wear in the northeast of England. It was a small mining village but from 1964 became the core of a planned New Town, with a population of over 67,000 in 2011.  It was part of County Durham until 1974 when the metropolis of Tyne and Wear was created. 
The ancestral home of US President George Washington's family was Washington Old Hall, which you can visit.  


Understand[edit]
Nissan Motor Works, flanked by A19 and A1231
Washington was just one of a series of small mining villages hereabouts: the coal lay deep but had profitable seams and associated industry up to the mid'20th century. Then these declined, but in 1964 Washington was designated as a "New Town". It was laid out in some 15 tracts, some around existing villages and others greenfield, and the grand concept was that each would have its own employment and amenities. The reality is that this created a sprawl of samey burbs with no real centre to the place except Galleries Shopping Centre.
It could have dwindled into a dormitory town for Newcastle, but was boosted with the arrival of Nissan in 1984. British car manufacture suffered from strikes, uncompetitive pricing and unreliability, and the Japanese brand Datsun seized the budget and midprice UK market. It rebranded as Nissan and set up locally, reducing transport times and giving access to the European Economic Area or EU. The plant was built on the former site of RAF Usworth / Sunderland Airport, and management insisted that only a single union would be recognised. The site now employs some 7000. It made the Bluebird, Primera, Ameira and Micra, and now makes the Qashqai, Juke and Leaf (even exporting them to Japan, which drives on the left like Britain) and is beginning to make electric versions of these. Its output is about 500,000 cars per year.

Newcastle International Airport is 14 miles northwest of Washington: take the Metro into Newcastle or Gateshead and change for the bus, see below. A taxi from the airport to Washington might be £22.
Washington was planned as a shiny modern town so the first thing they did was close the railway. Railways were dirty, obsolete, taxpayer-subsidised and (worst of all) heavily unionised. In the future, men would drive to work in British-built cars; the women would take the bus to go shopping, with head scarves drawn over their 1960s beehive hairdos.
Newcastle Central is the most convenient railway station, with frequent trains from London and the Midlands towards Edinburgh. Sunderland station is about the same distance but has fewer trains. 
By bus: Long distance coaches flash past on the motorway and don't stop here, change at Newcastle.  
Local buses are mostly run by Go North East:

X1 runs every 30 min from Newcastle upon Tyne Eldon Square to Gateshead, Washington (35 min) and Houghton-le-Spring, with alternate buses continuing to Peterlee.
Bus 2 runs every 30 min from Silksworth and Sunderland Interchange to High Barnes and Washington.
Bus 8 runs hourly from Sunderland to Washington, Chester-le-Street, Beamish Museum and Stanley.
Bus 50 runs hourly from  South Shields (for Tyne ferry) to Boldon, Nissan factory, Washington, Chester-le-Street and  Durham.
54.899-1.5341 Washington Galleries is the bus station, on Galleries Retail Park.
By road follow A1(M) to Junction 64.

Get around[edit]
It's a sprawling district and you need your own wheels, which fortunately they manufacture at the northeast edge of town.

54.902-1.51461 Washington Old Hall, The Avenue, Washington Village NE38 7LE, ☏ +44 191 416 6879, washingtonoldhall@nationaltrust.org.uk. Apr-Oct: F-Su 10AM-4PM. His teeth were famously rotten, and quinsy eventually did for him, but "heartburn" was the original family name of George Washington (1732–1799), first President of the United States. In the late 12th century William Bayard of Hartburn in County Durham took tenancy of the bishop's lands here, so he ditched his "de Hertburne" moniker for "de Wessyngton" — Hwæsa or Wassa may have been its original Saxon owner. The family held it until 1613 then sold it back to the bishopric and moved to the Midlands. John Washington (1633–1677) of Hertfordshire was a descendant who traded in tobacco: he was setting out on a return voyage from Virginia when his laden ship ran aground in the Potomac. It was repaired and sailed on, but John took the hint and stayed. He married and his first child Lawrence was the paternal grandfather of the future president. The Old Hall remained a residence until the 19th century then fell derelict. It was about to be demolished in 1936 but a campaign saved it, and in 1957 the National Trust took it on. So what you see now is a mostly 17th-century mansion. Adult £6.10, child £2.75, NT free.   (updated Dec 2021)Washington F Pit Museum
54.91146-1.53032 Washington "F" Pit Museum, Albany Way NE37 1BJ, ☏ +44 191 553 2323. Occasional summer: Th F Sa noon-3PM. Early coal mines were simple "bell pits", but they could only work shallow seams. The Durham seams lay deeper and from the 18th-century shafts were sunk to reach them, driving technical innovation to keep them drained and ventilated. William Russell sank a series of shafts A-I: Pit F was sunk in 1777 and productive until 1796, when an explosion caused it to flood. However it reopened in 1820 and was later sunk deeper to reach the Hutton Seam at 660 feet then in 1954 the Busty Seam at 927 feet. The simplex steam winding engine was built in 1888, serving another pit then relocating here in 1903. The pit closed in 1968 and re-opened as a museum in 1976, but its hours have always been erratic.
