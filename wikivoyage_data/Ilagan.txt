Ilagan is the capital city of Isabela. It is one of the largest cities in the Philippines, but it has a small town feel, and has a vibrant tourism scene. It is along the main highway to Tuguegarao.


Understand[edit]
With a land area of about 117 ha (290 acres), Ilagan is the fourth largest city in the Philippines by land area. It is also the most populous city in Isabela, with a population of about 158,000 (2020).
The city basically has two central areas, Baligatan and the old city proper (poblacion). Baligatan is along the highway to Tuguegarao, and has the provincial government center, the main public market, and the park which houses the giant armchair. The old downtown is far northeast, nestled at the convergence of the Cagayan and Ilagan rivers.
