Fort Pierce is a small city on the Treasure Coast of Florida. The city is most commonly referred to as "The Fort" in reference to the old fort on Indian River Drive.


Understand[edit]
Fort Pierce is the oldest incorporated city in St. Lucie County, with a bustling and historic downtown area, close location to beaches on the Indian River Lagoon and the Atlantic Ocean by its extension to Hutchinson Island, and many famous celebrities visiting every summer at the Sunrise Theatre. Fort Pierce has a population of 43,601 by the 2013 US Census Estimate; Fort Pierce is also a part of the Port St. Lucie metropolitan area, or the Treasure Coast, an area populated at almost 600,000.

Fort Pierce is a small railroad city along Florida's east coast, being the location of a mid-sized rail yard with track rights owned by the Florida East Coast Railroad, with track all the way to Miami and Jacksonville, and South Central Florida Express, with track from the downtown yard to Clewiston and Sebring.
FP is becoming more and more modernized, but slowly and steadily. Downtown is considered the hot-spot of the city due to its blossoming commercialism, amazing Spanish-colonial buildings, celebrities performing at the Sunrise Theatre, and an amazing Christmas display yearly at Avenues A and Orange. There's a lot of fun going on with the marina and many interesting shops on the thoroughfares of Orange Avenue and Avenue D. Fort Pierce is also a college town, home to the primary campus of Indian River State College and its public safety training complex.

By car[edit]
Fort Pierce, like many cities has many major highways running through the city. Major highways include I-95, US-1, and Florida's Turnpike.
By Interstate 95, you can access Fort Pierce by:

Exit 126 at Midway Road. Going west will take you to Okeechobee Road, which is what the locals call State Road 70. Going east will take you to the beach.
Exit 129 at Okeechobee Road. There are many hotels and fast food restaurants near by. Going west will take you to Okeechobee and further to Bradenton. Going east will put you closer into the heart of downtown.
Exit 131 at Orange Avenue. Going west will take you out to the "country" area of the city with many ranches. Going east will take you into downtown.
Exit 138 at Indrio Road. Services are east of the exit.
By Florida's Turnpike, you can access Fort Pierce by:

Exit 152 at SR 70, or Okeechobee Road.
One special thing about the Okeechobee Road area between I-95 and the Turnpike is that it is considered to be a crossroads, where two highways are within a driving range of less than a mile. Businesses, from hotels to restaurants, are abundant in this State Road 70 corridor. Businesses along State Road 70 don't just exist at the cross roads, but also run along to US-1.
US-1 and A1A run through the heart of downtown, and A1A almost parallels US-1. A1A runs along the barrier islands of the east coast, from Miami to the Jacksonville area. The local name for A1A on Hutchinson Island South crossing onto US-1 is "Seaway Drive".

By plane[edit]
Fort Pierce is home to the St. Lucie County International, the local airport. Here, you can buy a plane to fly from place to place, due to no commercial flights.

By train[edit]
There has been much talk and controversy about the Florida East Coast Railroad and Amtrak giving the Port St. Lucie area, possibly Fort Pierce, a train station that serves passengers. If these plans go through, they will be serving the Florida East Coast Railway on rails that have not been touched by the rumbling wheels of passenger trains since the mid-1900s. Also, there has been controversy of a high-speed rail project from Miami to Orlando with a station in West Palm Beach; a station may be placed in the PSL area as well to accommodate. The full plan is rebuilding a passenger line to re-connect the Treasure Coast and the Space Coast with the rest of the country, serving from Martin County to northern Brevard County. The closest stations to date are in Okeechobee and West Palm Beach.

Get around[edit]
By car[edit]
In Fort Pierce, the roads are the easiest way to get around. Major roads lead to the highways, and Downtown Fort Pierce can tend to get crowded at any time of day, but you can take in the view of the Spanish-colonial style buildings as you drive through Downtown.

By boat[edit]
Fort Pierce is a city built on the water, and it is no coincidence that using a boat is one of the easiest ways to get around the city.

Downtown is a mostly waterfront area, with many restaurants and businesses on the water.
