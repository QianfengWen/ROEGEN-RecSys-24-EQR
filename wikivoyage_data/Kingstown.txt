Kingstown is the capital of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, located on the island of Saint Vincent.


Get in[edit]

Air Canada, American Airlines, and Caribbean Airlines all fly to Argyle International Airport (SVD IATA), which is a 30-minute taxi ride to Kingstown's city centre. If you're flying from a neighboring Caribbean island, Mustique Airways, One Caribbean, and SVG Air operate a variety of routes throughout the Caribbean.

Get around[edit]
Although not a very large island, St. Vincent has mountainous and rugged terrain, making it difficult to get around. Private vans or taxis are your best options. Car rental is also available.
In terms of public transportation the island is served by a large number of privately owned vans that act as a bus service. These vans have an "H" at the beginning of their license plates, meaning they are "for hire". Cost to ride starts at EC$1. A van trip from Argyle airport to Kingstown is EC$3 (July 2019) as opposed to the EC$70 taxi ride. Walk up 300 m the slip road towards Windward Highway junction and hail a van. They ride fast and recklessly, hence you get a free rollercoaster ride for the fare. Many of the vans have graphics on the front and play loud music.
