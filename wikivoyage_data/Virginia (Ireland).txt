Virginia is a small town in County Cavan in the north of the Republic of Ireland, with a population in 2016 of 2648. Like the US State, it's named for Elizabeth I, and was settled from 1612 as a "plantation" town. This faltered as the site was poor, and the town only got going from the 1750s. It stands astride the highway from Dublin to Cavan and Donegal and has become a commuter town for the city. So travel time is short, but Virginia has not yet been bypassed so traffic thunders through on the N3 at all hours.

See[edit]
Lough Ramor bordered by Deerpark Forest is the main sight in Virginia. It has a few islets but not the drumlins seen further north: it's shallow and surrounded by reeds and wetland. It's drained by the River Blackwater, which courses southeast to join the River Boyne at Navan.

Christ Church, Ballyjamesduff
Virginia has Little Italy, Riverfront (see Drink), and Mason's Apron Bakery. But the standouts are the two hotels, Virginia Park Lodge and St Kyran's, see Sleep.
Ballyjamesduff choices include Town Diner, Mizzoni Pizza and Royal Bar.
Pork or what is it? Liffey Meats is a company in Ballyjamesduff that backed an annual "pork festival" launched in 1994: "Race 'em then eat 'em" was the concept. However in 2008 they were among several companies embroiled when Irish pork was found to contain dioxin, through contaminated feed for the pigs. They've since concentrated on beef, but in 2013 beef products across Europe were found to be adulterated with horse meat and pork; Silvercrest in nearby Monaghan was caught up in this. Even now it's hard to say how much was criminal fraud and how much was carelessness, but a major factor was lack of traceability in the supply chain. So what with all the hoo-hah plus a lack of enthusiasm by the pigs themselves, the festival has lapsed.
Drink[edit]
