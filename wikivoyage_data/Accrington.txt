Accrington is a town in East Lancashire. The town's main visitor attraction is the Tiffany glass collection in its art gallery, and the stark natural beauty of the Pennine moors all around. It's also notorious for its football team Accrington Stanley, which until 2019 was unfairly regarded as a joke and byword for failure. But not any more.  
The small towns of Baxenden, Oswaldtwistle (say ozzle-twizzle) and Clayton-le-Moors are nearby, and Blackburn is five miles west.


Understand[edit]
Town Hall
Its name probably means "acorns" from the oak woods that once carpeted these valleys. It grew during the industrial revolution, when the streams racing down from the Pennines powered its textile mills
It had a population of 35,000 in 2011, with a total of 80,000 in the borough of Hyndburn area. Many of its residents are Bangladeshis who came to work the mills in the 1950s. The town also produced Accrington Brick or NORI ("Iron" backwards), an exceptionally hard and acid-resistant brick, valuable for lining furnaces, chimneys and the like. The brickworks closed in 2008, were re-opened to political fanfare in 2015, and quietly closed again in 2016. The northern suburb of Ewbank gave its name to the carpet-sweeper manufacturer.

Football team[edit]
Lots of towns have had football (soccer) teams that collapsed. But this place is unique, at least in Britain, in the way the collapse of Accrington Stanley hung like a pall over the name of the town for decades, in spite of the team's resurgence. One reason is that they collapsed in the 1960s, in an era when that was difficult to accomplish. England's Football League was a closed shop. Promotion and relegation between fourth division and the minor leagues below was rare.  
From 1960 Accrington Stanley were near bankrupt, and fell like a stone through the League placings. By March 1962 their debts were unsustainable, they couldn't afford to put on games, and they had to resign from the League during the 61/62 season. It was a traumatic disorderly exit, and all their results were expunged. In the following seasons they played in the Lancashire Combination Leagues, and then they dissolved in 1966. 
An entirely separate, new Accrington Stanley was formed in 1968, and for the next 30 years plodded away in the minor leagues. From 1989 to 1995 they were the butt of a TV advert by the Milk Marketing Board. One young football fan has been warned that if he doesn't drink milk, he'll only be good enough to play for Accrington Stanley. His friend asks "Accrington Stanley, who are they?" and the first replies "Exactly." Town and club took a perverse pride in this recognition, but it didn't move the narrative on. 
In 2002 the club came into money from a transfer fee and began a steady rise up the rankings. In 2006 they were promoted back into League Two, equivalent to the old Fourth. In 2018 they were promoted to League One. In Jan 2019 in the FA Cup Third Round they pulled off a shock, beating Ipswich Town from the Championship (the tier above). They progressed to the Fourth Round to lose narrowly to Derby County, another Championship team.

One of the most striking items is a glass mosaic exhibition piece, designed by Briggs himself and entitled "Sulphur Crested Cockatoos". The gallery also tells the story of the Accrington Pals, a locally-recruited band of servicemen - more correctly the 11th East Lancs Regiment, composed of four 250-strong companies from Accrington, Burnley, Blackburn and Chorley. They first saw action on 1 July 1916, at the "Big Push" on the Somme. Half an hour later 235 were dead and 350 were injured. Free.   (updated Jan 2019)
