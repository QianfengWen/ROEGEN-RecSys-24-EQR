Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
Visitors arrive to Szamotuły mostly from Poznań. The quickest way to come here is by train: there are up to 11 (depending on the day, the highest number on Fridays and Sundays) regional trains, 2 Inter-Regio accelerated trains and more than a dozen fast trains. Travel time is between 25 (fast trains) and 35 (regional ones) minutes. Most local trains run on the line: Poznań – Szamotuły – Krzyż, some head as far as to Szczecin  (and during the summer season to the sea resort of Świnoujście (Swinemuende)) or to Kostrzyn where one can change to a connected train to Berlin.
Long-distance trains come from the south from e.g. Katowice, Kraków, Łódź, Warsaw, Wrocław and calling at Poznań and Szamotuły head as well to Szczecin or Świnoujście.

For most tourists buses will be less practical than trains, but some lines can be useful:

to Sierakow (up to 7 daily)
to Miedzychod (up to 6 daily)
to Klempicz i further through Czarnkow to Pila (4 daily)
to Poznań (12 daily) – the travel time is slightly longer than by train (ca. 50 mins) but the bus station is much closer to the touristy area in Szamotuły - at the crossroads of Lipowa and Poznańska.
Check the bus timetable here [1].
There are also buses going to Poznań straight from the market square (stop Szamotuły, Rynek) at a fixed rate of 8 PLN (as of August 2012). In Poznań they call at the Poznań-Ogrody tram loop (not the central station). Check their timetable here [2]
