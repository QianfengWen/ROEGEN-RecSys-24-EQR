Peterhead is a port in Aberdeenshire in northeast Scotland, with a population of 19,060 in 2020. Its fishing industry collapsed in the 20th century and the town is run-down, but is near attractive coastal scenery.


Understand[edit]
South breakwater was built by convict labour
"The people are sober and courteous, and agree well amongst themselves, which has now become a rare character." - church report of 1728
Until 1560 this was a sparsely-populated farmland owned by the Cistercian monks of Deer Abbey, whose talents did not include industrial and property development. It was then handed over to the Earls Marischal, who built a planned settlement. This grew into the largest fishing port in Britain, and remains so; it also pushed the most easterly point on the Scottish mainland another half mile out, as the island of Inch Keith became connected by causeway and infill. In the 18th and 19th centuries the main catch was whaling, and Peterhead was also a port-of-call when wars with France made the Channel dangerous, so shipping went the long way around the north tip of Scotland. In Victorian times the catch was herring. All this created a need for even larger port facilities, and forced labour to build them, so Peterhead became the Botany Bay of Britain, holding hundreds of convicts at a time when Australia had ceased to want them. Its large grim prison is the legacy, now a museum.
The fishing industry collapsed in the 20th century through overfishing, restrictive catch limits, and competition from European trawlers. Like Aberdeen, Peterhead was never itself an oil-handling town but serviced the offshore oil industry, but that too has passed as exploration and production moved into more northerly waters. The town became rough and deprived. However the fine buildings of its Georgian and Victorian heyday are well-preserved, and there are beaches and rugged scenic cliffs to the south.
People from Peterhead are known as Bloo Touners or Bloo Mogganers, from the blue worsted moggans - stockings - worn by fisherfolk.

For long-distance routes, see Aberdeen.

By bus[edit]
Stagecoach runs bus services every half hour (hour on Sundays) from Aberdeen via Ellon P&R or Cruden Bay to Peterhead, taking 75 min, around £10.
Bus 69 runs every hour between Fraserburgh and Peterhead, 30 min, around £10.
57.5074-1.77991 Peterhead Interchange is the main bus station, at the corner of Windmill St and St Peter St.

By car[edit]
Peterhead is easily accessible from Aberdeen and the south via the A90, which continues to Fraserburgh.
The slow, winding A950 provides a connection to the west, and is a useful shortcut if arriving from Inverness.

By train[edit]
Peterhead's train station closed to passengers in the 1960s.  The nearest station as the crow flies is Dyce, some 30 or so miles away, but as there is no direct public transport connection, it is better to arrive at Aberdeen and catch a bus north.

Get around[edit]
The town centre is easily walkable, but transport is required to explore the surrounding area.

By bus[edit]
A handful of bus routes operate within the town, connecting with regional routes at Peterhead Interchange.  Local routes, however, are best boarded at 57.5055-1.77852 Chapel Street, a closer stop to the town centre.
Services are frequent, with local buses running around every 15 mins. Tickets within the town cost £2-3 for a single or £4-5 for unlimited travel for a day, and can be purchased onboard.
Buses are also available to the surrounding villages of Boddam, Cruden Bay, Mintlaw and St. Fergus.

By taxi[edit]
Taxi services are offered by a number of companies.
Firms include Elaine's (+44 1779 591000), Grab a Cab (+44 1779 473030) and Central Taxis (+44 1779 434343).

57.505-1.792 Old St Peter's Church is a ruin by the north end of the beach. The oldest parts may be from 12th century, but the tower which still stands is medieval.
 Peterhead Bay is home to vessels servicing the oil and gas industry.  It's enclosed by two massive breakwaters, the southern of which was built using convict labour from the town's prison.  The town's main beach stretches for a mile along the bay shoreline.  57.49637-1.793983 Lido Beach is the southern portion. It's just a beach, not a lido pool as the name might suggest.  It's suitable for swimming, but distinctly bracing.
 Peterhead Harbour has been a home to the fishing industry for centuries, and a walk around the old stone quays and piers looking at the boats makes for a pleasant afternoon.  Keep your eye out for the numerous grey seals that frequent the harbour.  57.5032-1.77144 Keith Inch is a former island comprising the eastern side of the harbour. Although once housing a whaling community, it is now dominated by industrial buildings, but remains noteworthy for being the easternmost point on the Scottish mainland.
57.49-1.7875 Peterhead Prison Museum, Admiralty Gateway, South Road AB42 2ZX, ☏ +44 1779 482200. Apr-Oct: daily 10AM-6PM; Nov-Mar: daily 10AM-4PM (last admission 1 hr 30 min before closing). Opened in 1888, Peterhead Prison had the reputation as "Scotland's toughest prison". Until the 1950s, inmates were subjected to penal labour, working in a nearby quarry and constructing the town's southern breakwater. The museum offers self-guided tours of the former prison, taking 1 hr 30 min to 2 hr.  Included in the ticket price is admission to the Lifeboat Museum, which details the history of lifeboats in Peterhead, and houses the restored lifeboat Julia Park Barry of Glasgow. Adult £12, Lifeboat Museum only £5.   (updated Sep 2023)

Longhaven Cliffs south of town are a line of pink granite cliffs notched with narrow inlets. Access them via the wildlife reserve car park off the A90, and take very great care along the cliff paths. Puffins can be seen in the spring and summer, and seals all year round.  A curiosity at the south end of this section, six miles south of town, is the 57.433-1.8217 Bullers of Buchan. Here a cave has collapsed leaving a magnificent sea arch.
57.415-1.8328 Slains Castle is a 16th-century ruined castle set atop windswept cliffs around 15 min drive south of Peterhead near the village of Cruden Bay. It replaced Old Slains Castle which is just a masonry shard 5 miles south. The newer castle is not maintained, so great care must be taken when visiting due to loose masonry and proximity to the cliffs.

The town's principal shopping area centres around Marischal Street, though like many high streets its heyday has come and gone. All is not lost, however, with a scattering of independent shops found on adjacent streets. For the traveller, the following stores may prove for an interesting visit:

57.5042-1.77641 Donalds, 7 St Andrews Street, AB42 1DS, ☏ +44 1779 474737. Known by locals as "Dodie's" after its founder George Donald, this Peterhead institution is one of the few independent department stores found in north-east Scotland. Everything from fridges to footwear can be found, although for clothing and sportswear, sister shop Justrite (41 Queen Street, AB42 1TP) offers a better selection. (updated Jul 2023)
Fishmongers: As the UK's principal fishing port, Peterhead boasts some of the freshest and finest deep-sea fish available, with fish frequently being sold the same day it's landed. 57.5069-1.77632 The Old Smoke House (17 Ellis Street, AB42 1JR) is one of the best known fishmongers in Peterhead, with 57.508-1.77713 R & J Seafoods (next to 23 North Street, AB42 1JS) being a little-known store frequented by locals. Peterhead Fishmarket is a wholesale auction house and is not open to individual shoppers. See the Eat section for fish and chip shops.

The town is well provided with supermarkets. 57.5109-1.78835 Morrisons (Queen Street, AB42 1HG) is the most centrally located of the major chains, being a 10 min walk from the town centre. Aldi and Iceland also have central locations with Asda, Lidl and Coop being some distance away in the suburbs.

Eat[edit]
While in Peterhead there are two foods every traveller should try:

Locally caught fish and chips are a must.  It's hard to go wrong ordering fish and chips in Peterhead, as most "chippers" get their catch fresh from the harbour.  Although cod and plaice are generally preferred in other parts of the UK, haddock is the fish of choice for most locals.  For a more refined taste, try lemon sole.  But don't ask for fish and chips — the local term is a fish supper. For those who would rather avoid fish, a white pudding supper is a good option — seasoned oatmeal stuffing, battered and deep-fried.
Cookies, or butteries as they are known elsewhere in the region, are a local delicacy partway between pancake and croissant.  They are best served warm with butter or jam, and can be found in almost any bakery or supermarket.
There are a good number of restaurants, takeaways and bakeries, so travellers should have little trouble finding something to suit them.  Some good options are listed below:

57.5027-1.77421 Dolphin Cafe, West Pier, AB42 1DW (opposite the lifeboat station). Harbour-front fish and chip shop with seating and views of fishing boats. (updated Jul 2023)

Drink[edit]
Bullers of Buchan
The Glenugie Distillery, once Scotland's most easterly, was located at the southern outskirts of Peterhead.  It closed in the 1980s, but bottles of Glenugie single malt whisky can still be purchased from specialist shops elsewhere in Scotland, with prices reaching into the thousands of pounds.
For the traveller on a more modest budget, there are a number of pubs from which to choose, though for trendier venues one has to travel to Aberdeen.

57.5067-1.77681 Harbour Lights, 122-124 Longate, AB42 1JU. Award-winning pub in near the harbour. (updated Jul 2023)

Sleep[edit]
