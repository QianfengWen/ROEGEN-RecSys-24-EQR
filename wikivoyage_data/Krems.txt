Notable places include:

Göttweig and Melk monastery
Dürnstein, a medieval castle/ruins which served as a prison for Richard Lionheart (Richard I of England), city walls, monastery
Wine towns Spitz and Weissenkirchen and the nearby
Ruins of Hinterhaus, a 1000 year old ruins
Aggstein Castle
Most of the Wachau (except Aggstein) can be reached by the local train Krems-Spitz or by bike on the Danube cycle track (Donauradweg). Göttweig is at the train station Krems-St.Pölten line and Melk at the Westbahn.
In summer many tourist boats operate in the Wachau. The biggest and most visible boat companies are DDSG (Donaudampschifffahrtsgesellschaft) and Brandner, but they are not necessarily the cheapest. MS Stadt Wien is a popular alternative among locals (weekends only).
