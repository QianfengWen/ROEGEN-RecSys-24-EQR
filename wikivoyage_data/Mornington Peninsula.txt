This article is about the entire Mornington Peninsula, and not just the area of Mornington
Mornington Peninsula lies south of Melbourne, Australia forming the eastern side of Port Phillip Bay.


Cities[edit]
38°18′47″S 144°57′22″EMap of Mornington Peninsula
Balnarring - A small town towards the western side of the Peninsula, it has a more rural feel to it with many local camping sites and surf beaches nearby
Blairgowrie
Dromana- A small coastal village, sitting in a valley between Arthurs Seat and Mount Martha. With a beautiful beach with brightly painted boat sheds lining the shore, it's a pretty spot to spend a few days.
Mornington - The largest town on the Mornington Peninsula, with one long main street leading down to the beach and pier. Mornington is a beachside town that is rapidly growing in response to the growing population around it and on the Peninsula, but don't shy away from it, it still has a wonderful atmosphere and good transport links (buses) to the rest of the peninsula.
Mount Eliza - Located between Mornington and Frankston to the north, Mount Eliza is home to a select few wineries, but is mostly made up of large upper-class houses and schools.
Mount Martha - Midway between Mornington and Dromana, this little town consists mostly of houses and a small strip of shops opposite the beach. It's not on the main road, only discovered by those taking the scenic ocean route.
Portsea- Glitzy, ritzy Portea at the tip of the Peninsula is resident to some very expensive holiday homes and the Portsea Pub that sits right on the forshore. From watching the sunset over a beer on the pub terrace to catching some waves at Portsea backbeach you won't soon be bored!
Red Hill- With green rolling hills, amazing wineries, fresh produce and a popular community market, this is rural Australia at its best.
Rye - A popular summer tourist area, boasting some of the nicest beaches for swimming and snorkeling. During the summer months Rye holds a carnival, with many rides, sideshows, and attractions. Rye also has some of the nicest beachfront cafes and dining on the peninsula.
Sorrento- Sorrento is lucky to boast two very different yet equally interesting beaches. The Sorrento Ocean Beach is spectacular and dangerous, while the bay beach is calm and relaxing. Take your pick! Sorrento was also the site of Victoria's first official settlement in 1803.

Understand[edit]
The peninsula is at its best and busiest during the summer months, but don't disregard the winter months.
Walking the beaches that line Bass Straight in the cold grey months of winter, and being witness to the drama of the oceans fury is an experience you won't soon forget. Just bring a jacket! Spending a warm summer evening with some fish and chips on the foreshore watching the sun set with some friends is a great way to enjoy life.

Stay safe[edit]
The Mornington Peninsula provides easy access to the calm waters of Port Phillip Bay and the surf beaches of Bass Strait. The bay side is dotted with family-friendly sandy beaches from Frankston in the north down to Sorrento on the southern tip of the peninsula with foreshore camp grounds open in summer at the more popular Sorrento, Blairgowrie, Rosebud and Rye beaches.
The ocean beaches (or "back" beaches) such as Gunnamatta, Portsea Surf Beach, Sorrento Back Beach, and St Andrews Beach provide big waves to attract surfers and the more intrepid. The ocean beaches can be dangerous and only for strong, competent swimmers. All swimmers should swim between the flags at patrolled surf beaches in the summer months. Bridgewater Bay in Blairgowrie features rock pools exposed at low tide which are safe for swimming.
The ocean beaches have single large waves on rare occasions. Standing on the rocks above the shoreline is not safe; people do get swept off on occasion.

Go next[edit]
