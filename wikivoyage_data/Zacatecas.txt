Zacatecas, the capital of the state of the same name, is a city of 138,000 people (2020) in the Bajío region of Mexico. The town offers a rich travel experience with its historical downtown centro full of colonial architecture, 17th century churches, innovative restaurants and lively night clubs. Zacatecas is a  UNESCO World Heritage Site. 


Understand[edit]
Cathedral of Zacatecas
Located in north-central Mexico, Zacatecas had its start as a Spanish mining camp in the mid-16th century, although Native Americans had already known about the area's rich deposits of silver and other minerals the rich deposits of silver and lead were discovered by the Spanish in the 1540s. Due to the wealth that the mines provided, Zacatecas quickly became one of the most important mining cities in New Spain. The area saw battles during the turbulent 19th century, and the city was held by the colonists during the Mexican War of Independence. It was also the site of a major battle known as the Battle of Zacatecas during the Mexican Revolution when Pancho Villa captured the town, an event still celebrated every anniversary. Today, the colonial part of the city is well preserved with a number of historic buildings. It is a World Heritage Site, due to the baroque churches and other structures built during its mining days. Mining remains an important industry. 
The name Zacatecas is derived from the Zacateco people and has its roots in Nahuatl. The name means "people of the grasslands". In the pre-Colombian era, the area was inhabited several groups who were known collectively as the Chichimeca. These groups included Caxcans, Guachichils, Guamares, Huichols, and Zacatecos. 
The climate is semi-arid with desert conditions in the nearby mountainous areas.

Get in[edit]

Once at the airport take a 20-min taxi ride to downtown.

You can check for shared rides on Blablacar, especially when coming from San Luis Potosi, León, Guadalajara or Aguascalientes. As of 2024, due to cartel violence in the region, you should avoid traveling to Zacatecas from Guadalajara/Jalisco and Durango by private vehicle (busses are fine).

By bus[edit]

Get around[edit]

Walking is probably the best way to get around the Centro Historico (Historic Downtown) which is relatively small. It will allow you to see the city at your own pace.  The Centro is about 8000 feet (2400 meters) while surrounding portions of the city are much higher.  Be sure that you are acclimated to the altitude.
If you get tired, take a taxi cab. They are moderately priced and available all over the city. Just make sure you ask in advance to the taxi driver how much he will charge you (Cuanto cuesta ir a 'Insert place'?). As most prices in Mexico, taxi fares are open to negotiation and asking in advance should give you a better negotiating position. The ride-hailing services Uber and Didi are also readily available.
There is also the Maxibus, which will drive you around the city to show you the interesting sites. It costs M$100 (pesos) for adults and M$80 for minors (as of 2023), lasts about 45 minutes and leaves from the Plaza de Armas.

Nearly all of the city center buildings are nineteenth century or older; the topography and irregular street pattern (most streets are too steep and narrow for vehicles; many have steps in them) almost make one think of a medieval city like Toledo, Spain. The city, built on the site where silver was discovered in the 1530s, is crammed into a narrow canyon, with houses and churches perched on its nearly vertical walls.
The whole town is a museum; there are three seventeenth or eighteenth century ex-monasteries near the center, several other churches from the colonial era scattered here and there, and at least half a dozen other museums, nearly all worth visiting. Houses and streets, all of which built in colonial times are worth seeing on their own.

Festivals[edit]

Eat[edit]
Zacatecas is blessed with some outstanding restaurants serving a wide range of traditional Mexican dishes, including regional variations that an epicurious traveler will seek out since they are rarely cooked in other regions, let alone outside Mexico.

The state of Jalisco is most famous for birria, a delicious stew that's typically made with lamb, though in Zacatecas, it's made with goat and is called birria de chivo.

Stay safe[edit]
As of 2024, despite blanket warnings about Zacatecas State from the U.S. and Canadian governments, Zacatecas city is safe for tourists. Some other towns and villages in the state of Zacatecas are not, however. Driving in a private vehicle between Zacatecas city and the states of Jalisco or Durango should generally be avoided – tourists have been murdered on rural Zacatecan highways. This does not apply to busses – traveling by bus in any direction across the state is safe.

Connect[edit]
Telcel provides 4G coverage throughout the city. As of 2024, 5G has not yet reached Zacatecas.
Due to the age and construction of most of the buildings in the city, wifi coverage can be spotty in hotels unless the proprietor has put significant effort into boosting the signal.
