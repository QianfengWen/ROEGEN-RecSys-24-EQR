The Clock Tower in the Citadel of Sighișoara
Sighișoara is a city on the Tarnava River in Mures county, in the historic region of Transylvania. German craftsmen and merchants, the Transylvanian Saxons, were invited here by the King of Hungary during the 12th century to settle and defend the frontier. Central Sighișoara has preserved in an exemplary way the features of a small medieval fortified city, which the Saxons called "Schäßburg", and it has been listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. Each year a Medieval Festival takes place in the old citadel in July. Sighișoara is a popular tourist destination due to its well-preserved walled old town. The landmark of the city is the Clock Tower, a 64-m high tower built in 1556. It is now a museum of history.


Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The nearest airports are Targu Mures (TGM IATA) 48 km (30 mi) away, Sibiu (SBZ IATA) 90 km (56 mi) away, Cluj Napoca (CLJ IATA) 145 km (90 mi) away, and Bucharest Otopeni (OTP IATA) 290 km (180 mi) away - see those pages for flight options. If you fly in and hire a car, none of those transfers are difficult. If you're relying on public transport, you probably need to stay overnight in the city you land in. Romania time is +1 hour on western Europe and +2 hours on UK, Eire and Portugal, so last trains and last buses will leave that much earlier.

By train[edit]
There are 6 direct trains daily from Bucharest, 6 hours; 3 per day from Sibiu usually changing at Medias or Copsa Mica, 3 hours; and 3 from Targu Mures, 5 hours.
From Budapest the best option is the overnight direct train, leaving at 19:00 to arrive 07:00. Destinations further west, e.g. Vienna, Prague and Warsaw, will usually mean a change in Budapest. From Istanbul take the overnight Bosfors Expres and change in Bucharest.
For timetables, the easiest site to navigate is Deutsche Bahn.
The 46.22628324.7958061 Sighișoara Railway Station is 1 km N of the old centre, next to the bus station. As you exit, zag right then left onto Str Garii/Station Rd, walk south with the citadel in plain view ahead, a jog left then right takes you over the little bridge into the centre.

By bus[edit]
Direct buses to Cluj-Napoca (3 hours), Bucuresti (5½ hours), Otopeni OTP airport (6 hours, 250 lei), Sibiu (3½ hours) or Targu Mures (1 hour); but the times may be erratic. The 46.22589124.7976782 Sighișoara Bus Station is near the railway staion. For timetables check www.autogari.ro.

By road[edit]
46°13′1″N 24°47′28″EMap of Sighișoara
Romanian highways are mostly well-signed and in good repair: reckon 8 hours to drive from Budapest. Drive defensively of course, watching especially for horse-drawn carts.

Get around[edit]
It's such a small town that you will have no problem in going around walking. If you need any suggestion there is a tourist information office inside the Café International and Family Center or the tourist information booth, both located in the main square Piata Cetatii; they will help you reach the fortified churches in the area. For more information see the Do section.

Special events:

Sighișoara Medieval Festival: During the annual event, the town receives around ~30,000 tourists, doubling its population. Numerous cultural events take place during the 3 days of the festival - theatre, indoor and outdoor music concerts, handicraft demonstrations and exhibitions, painting, sculpture, seminars, film projections, etc.
 Pro Etnica. Annual interethnic music and art festival, with indoor and outdoor performances (music, dance, film) of representatives of most ethnic groups living in Romania. 
 Sighișoara Blues Festival. 
DAVA Festival: A young electronic music festival, organized in a former glass factory, 5 min away by car from the city centre.
The town is quite small, so one day to visit it is enough. In any case, you can consider staying more to visit the surroundings.

Hike or cycle up to the great Oak forest on the Breite plateau - a wonderful walk in nature.
A great picnic location is the hill to the south of the city directly opposite the clock tower (get your bearings from the lookout at the base before you set off). Grab some goodies from a local shop and walk up any road leading to that hill. Just keep going up and, eventually, the road will die out to grass which you can walk over (it's public land) towards the defunct communications tower on the hill. A seat up here will give you a grand view of Sighișoara and the villages beyond.
A day out on a bike which you can easily rent (€1/hr or €10/day) involves heading south out of town to Soas, then on to Apold where you can see the fortified church. From Apold head left by the church towards Vulcan (signposted). The road becomes a stony track. After a few km, turn left following signs to Vulcan. At Vulcan, bear left over a tiny bridge and then onto a dirt track. Follow this uphill out of Vulcan. At the brow of the hill go straight across and down the valley to Sighișoara. If it has rained in the last couple of days or is raining, the track from Vulcan to a few kilometres south of Sighișoara will be a quagmire. It is a very beautiful descent into Sighișoara though. Be prepared for mud!
 Cross-country farm (Horse riding holidays), Village of Prod (16 km from Sighișoara), ☏ +40 372 772 890.

The prices are higher than normal, but the quality of the food is very good. Very good breakfast sets for up to 15 lei. If you go downstairs you will find an Internet point.

Go next[edit]
Spend at least a day exploring the nearby medieval fortified churches – you’ll need your own transport. The Saxon settlements of Transylvania came under attack in the 15th & 16th centuries, but instead of erecting castles, they fortified the churches with walls and lookout towers. Most examples are clustered around Medias (another well-preserved Saxon medieval center), the best being the UNESCO World Heritage sites of Biertan, Saschiz, Valea Viilor and Viscri. Other fine examples close by include Apold and Malancrav.
Sibiu has a beautiful medieval old town. It can be combined with a day-trip to the fortified churches, but stands as a centre in its own right. Other notable centres include Cluj-Napoca, Targu Mures, and Brasov.
If your itinerary includes Bucharest, try to visit it before Transylvania. It’s interesting but far from pretty, and it’s going to look especially drab after seeing Sighisoara.
