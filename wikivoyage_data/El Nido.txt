El Nido is a coastal town in Palawan. El Nido comprises 45 islands and islets; limestone cliffs are also found here, which form a Karst backdrop similar to those found in Ha Long Bay, Krabi and Guilin. It is a popular destination for locals during the long holidays of the Holy Week, but has been relatively unknown to foreign tourists. El Nido is more than just a stereotypical tropical paradise. Beaches, clear waters, jungle, steep limestone cliffs and stunning inlets make for one of the world's most beautiful seascapes.
Before El Nido became a popular tourist destination, fishing and harvesting swift nests, nidos, were the main source of income. Tourism has become the municipality's main source of revenue; however, the authorities are trying to keep it sustainable and hotel chains are refreshingly absent. Huge tour groups are nowhere to be seen. El Nido is also known for water sports such as diving, snorkeling and kayaking.

Get around[edit]
See[edit]
Long boats await island hopping passengers to explore Bacuit Bay
Snorkeling in the Green Lagoon, Bacuit Bay
Breathtaking views of nature are the main reason to visit El Nido. The pristine waters of El Nido offer beautiful coral reefs, while its beaches are uncrowded unlike the popular Boracay, exploring the lagoons by kayaking is a great way of visiting the islets, coves and caves are also abundant. Inland El Nido, springs and waterfalls are also found. Bacuit Bay composes of limestone islands, where its possible to either dive, snorkel or hike.
The easiest way to see the Bacuit Bay is on an island hopping boat. These boats carry 6-12 people and will visit 4 or 5 destinations in a day. These destinations include: secret beaches, blue or green lagoons, various islands, and amazing natural land-formations. The boats usually take set routes named A to D, but can vary depending on tides and weather. Each boat trip takes you to 4 or 5 different places and favorite tours are A and C, though all of them are fantastic. Boats normally cost around ₱850-1200 per person depending in the route and travel agency. The trip takes one day (cca 9AM-3:30PM), normally includes a good lunch and can be arranged from most guesthouses and travel agencies in El Nido. El Nido municipality also charges ₱200 as an environmental fee which is valid 10 days. It's a good idea to book a boat with only 6 seats and experienced crew (e.g. at Relucio's).
If you have time, go for overnight island hopping (3 days 2 nights is a good option) where you get to camp on deserted island ala Survivor style. (Though most places you can be dropped at are included in the daily island hopping tours.) It gives you the best option to visit lots more islands that are included in those bundle package tours but at your own leisure time.  Find a few more people to get a much better rate.  Recommended place a booth at Aplaya Restaurant, look for Nhel who will give you the best deals and arrangements.
