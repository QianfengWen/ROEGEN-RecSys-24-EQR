History[edit]
Former railway station, now a tourist information office at Barry's Bay
This area of Renfrew County was first settled by non-Indigenous people in the early 20th century along with other communities on the Opeongo Line. The town served as a standby base for the Canadian military during the war years. Local workers and lumbermen were reformed into soldiers to help contribute to the war efforts of Canada in World War II.
It was first named 'Kuaenash Ne-ishing' (Algonquin for 'beautiful bay'), and later named after James Barry, a foreman for McLaughlin's Lumber in Arnprior who constructed a cabin as his headquarters in the area where St. Hedwig's Church stands.
