Logroño is a city in northern Spain. It's the capital of the autonomous community of La Rioja, well known for its wine. The Way of St. James runs through the city, as does the River Ebro.


Understand[edit]
The origin of Logroño is associated to the Roman Vareia, now a neighbourhood of the city, and the Iron Age site on top of Monte Cantabria. Being an important crossroad on the Way of St. James and strategic point between the kingdoms of Aragon, Castile and Navarra helped to develop the city during the Middle Ages.
In 1095, the king Alfonso VI of León and Castile awarded the inhabitants of Logroño with the Code of Laws named Fuero. King John II of Castile granted the status of 'city' in 1431 and the titles of 'very noble' and 'very loyal' in 1444.

Stone bridge
In 1521, the population heroically resisted the siege of 30,000 troops sent by King Francis I of France for 17 days. To remember the victory, Charles I ordered three fleurs-de-lis to be added to the city's emblem. A tribunal of the Spanish Inquisition was set in Logroño in 1570, being of historical importance in 1610 during the Basque witch trials.
The 1833 territorial division of Spain established Logroño as the capital of the new Province of Logroño, renamed in 1980 to Province of La Rioja and constituted as autonomous community since 1982.
Logroño is now a city of 153,066 inhabitants, and is considered to have one of the greatest quality of life in Spain.
The city is twinned with Brescia, Ciudad de La Rioja, Darmstadt, Dax, Dunfermline, Hagunia, Libourne and Rancagua.

You can't leave Logroño without visiting the famous 42.465381-2.4491241 Calle Laurel.  that together with Travesía del Laurel, Calle San Agustin and Calle Albornoz concentrate more than 50 bars serving tapas, known in the north of Spain as pintxos.
Each bar cooks its own speciality, although new openings are specialized in more than one dish, always accompanied by a glass of Rioja wine. You can hop freely from one bar to the next one along the one hundred meters of the street that has an unbeatable atmosphere of good vibes. The circuit is popularly known as Trail of the Elephants, because people would walk on four legs if they visited all the bars.

Budget[edit]
Prices of pintxos are around €2 so it can become expensive if you feel really hungry or can't stop trying all those delicacies. An option to keep the budget low would be ordering bigger portions of them that are called raciones and are usually served in clay pots. Some of these bars serve as well bigger sandwiches known as bocadillos or bocatas.
There is a good amount of doner kebab stands around the city offering beef and chicken served with salad in flatbread for around €4.5.
In autumn and winter you can find churrería stalls selling a fried-dough pastry named churro. During the cold months is common to find as well smaller kiosks selling roasted chestnuts.

Drink[edit]
Beer[edit]
In a wine region like this, drinking beer is not forbidden yet. Ordering beer is easy with the widely known "una cerveza, por favor" that will get you usually a caña which is about 25 cl of draught beer. For a smaller size you should order corto de cerveza and for the half litre, or pint, use pinta.
On Thursdays most of the bars have "pinta a precio de caña" which means pints are discounted, paying for them what you would pay normally for a caña. In some of these bars you can also find local hand-crafted beer: Ceriux[dead link], Mateo & Bernabé and Palax.
42.466817-2.4496331 Plaza del Parlamento.  and 42.466138-2.4486482 Plaza San Agustín.  are two of the favourite spots for beer lovers  with bars and terraces.

Coffee[edit]
Locals like to drink coffee or tea, but it's simply an excuse to get together around a table and chat. The pedestrian street Bretón de los Herreros has some of the nicest cafeterias with outdoor terraces both in winter and summer, which get really crowded after-work.
In summer it's common to ask for café con hielos and you'll be getting a glass with ices where you can pour your coffee. If you want to try something different, ask for té americano which is an infusion of black tea boiled in milk with a slice of orange and cinnamon.

42.465528-2.4496043 Café La Luna, C/Bretón de los Herreros, 56, ☏ +34 941-288-700. For stronger versions of té americano ask for té de la luna (with hazelnut liqueur) or té selenita (with ron miel). 
42.466865-2.4475564 Café Moderno, Plaza Martínez Zaporta, 7, ☏ +34 941-220-042, info@cafemoderno.com. W–M 08:30–close. Founded in 1916, it's not only a bar but a restaurant. Go there on Friday or Saturday at midnight to have fun singing together the anthem "Fibra de Pájaro". 
Wine[edit]
While ordering wine you have to consider that is classified into four categories. Joven, cosechero or vino del año is the youngest wine and has undergone very little, if any, wood ageing. Crianza is aged for two years, being at least one in an oak barrel. Reserva is aged for at least three years, of which at least one year is in oak. Gran Reserva has been aged at least two years in oak and three years in bottle.
You can distinguish as well four types of wine because of the colour: red tinto, white blanco and two kinds of rosé clarete and rosado with different processes of elaboration.

42.4659-2.449635 La Gota de Vino, C/San Agustín, 14, ☏ +34 941-204-200. Daily 11:00–00:00. Be advised by Antonio, the nice manager and waiter of the place, and you'll be tasting some of the trending wines in the region.
