Coburg is a city in Upper Franconia. Coburg has been a household name since the 19th century as the local, relatively minor noble family "Saxe-Coburg-Gotha" managed to marry into plenty of European royal families, leading to "European family reunions" at their place during the Belle Epoque. So naturally you will find lots of castles, palaces and other historical buildings in Coburg.

Eat[edit]
Coburger Bratwurst. On the Marktplatz (market square) you will find one or two stalls, who serve them to you. In the traditional way the Bratwurst has to be roasted over pine cones, which gives them part of their unique taste. The size of the Bratwurst is determined by a figure on the town hall (Rathaus, also on the Marktplatz) called Bratwurstmännle, which is said to keep the measure in one hand.
A second thing to try are the Coburger Klöße (Coburg dumplings), made from potatoes. They are served (mostly Sundays) with a variety of meats and roasts (pork, deer, beef) in nearly every German type Gasthaus or restaurant.
