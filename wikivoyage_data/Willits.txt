Willits is a city in Mendocino County on the North Coast of California. It is best known as the Heart of Mendocino County. It offers an amazing array of shopping and amusements for a city with a population of 5,000 in 2020.


Understand[edit]
The City of Willits began as a town of loggers and ranchers. In the wake of San Francisco's Summer of Love, an influx of hippies changed the character of the populace to today's mix: first, second, and third generation hippies coexisting with third, fourth, and fifth generation settlers. Add a sizable cohort of the artistically and liberally inclined with a certain tinge of New Age beliefs, and you definitely have a town with people watching possibilities while shopping the local galleries and craft shops.
Many of these boutiques are not easily seen by the passing traveler. One has to stop and look about to wring the greatest satisfaction from the Willits experience.

Get in[edit]

The City of Willits is 135 miles north of San Francisco on Highway 101. The highway passes south to north, bisecting Willits as Main Street; highway addresses change to city addresses at the city line. In the center of town, just after passing under the Heart of the Redwoods arch over 101, Highway 20 runs its winding way westward to Fort Bragg.
Coming from the Sacramento Valley, take Williams exit 578 from I-5 westward onto California Highway 20. When it merges with Highway 101, turn north. Again, you are entering Willits from the south.
