Apizaco is a bustling commercial town of 82,000 people (2016) in Tlaxcala state. Apizaco's not scenic or tourist-oriented, and its main interest for travellers is likely to be as a jumping-off place for climbing the volcano La Malinche. 


Understand[edit]
Monument to Jesus Garcia Corona
Climate[edit]
The city's climate is temperate and arid. Temperature in the winter can fall below 0°C, and in the summer, it can reach in excess of 30°C.

Get in[edit]
It is approximately 25 minutes by car from the city of Tlaxcala.

By bus[edit]
There is frequent bus service (about every 20 minutes, from early in the morning to late at night) to and from Puebla on ATAH, which has a station on Ave Zaragoza, south of Madero.
ATAH runs buses from Puebla to Apizaco from the main bus station CAPU. The first bus leaves 06:00 and you have to be on that in order to get to the collectivo to la Malinche in time from Apizaco (M$60-64 (pesos)). Frequent buses back to Puebla all evening. (Oct 2016)
Collectivo from Apizaco to la Malinche leaves in front of Comex-store very near Elektra-store  from the main collectivo launching area. Bus reads Malinz, which is the cabin resort on la Malinche. Collectivo leaves at 08:30 (be early) and leaves at 17:00 to return. (M$20)

Get around[edit]
The town is small enough to be easily walkable, but taxis are easy to catch near the ATAH station and along Blvrd. 16 Sept.

See[edit]

Mostly a museum with railway exhibits but also some displays on history and sports pertaining to the city. Sits adjacent to the railway that extends from Veracruz to Mexico City. Given that a lot of it consists of photographs, it is probably not the most exciting museum you have been to. (updated Nov 2020)
Basílica de Nuestra Señora de las Misericordias
19.41597-98.140943 Basílica de Nuestra Señora de la Misericordia (Basilica of Our Lady of Mercy), Av Cuauhtémoc, ☏ +52 241 417 0001. Ahh, Apizaco's own basilica, sitting opposite the Parque Cuauhtemoc like a tall sentinel, very gothic, yes, looks like it could be in a Van Helsing movie. (updated Nov 2020)
Do[edit]
Mount La Malinche
The main attraction is the nearby volcano La Malinche, which can be climbed as a day hike. To get to the mountain, either hire a taxi for about M$200 one way, or take the colectivo (with the sign saying C.V. Malinche) for M$25. The colectivo picks up across the street from Elektra on Serdan, three blocks south of 16 Sept. and two blocks east of the cathedral. The first colectivo leaves Apizaco at about 08:20 every morning; show up 10-15 minutes early. The last one down the mountain is at 17:00 every afternoon, and there is also a 15:00 bus F, Sa and Su. The best time to climb the volcano is in the dry season, which is winter. There may be some snow at the higher altitudes, but the hike is usually doable in tennis shoes. The altitude of the summit, 4,462 m (14,640 ft), is about the same as Mount Whitney, the highest peak in California's Sierra Nevada. Some acclimatization for the altitude can be accomplished simply by staying in Apizaco, which is at 2,400 m (7900 ft). Climbers in good physical condition should take about 3 to 6 hours to the summit, plus about 2 to 3 hours to descend. Further information about climbing the mountain is available on summitpost or in R. J. Secor's book: Mexico's Volcanoes: A Climbing Guide.

Sleep[edit]
Camping[edit]
Backcountry camping, with no amenities, is possible on the mountain, the most likely areas being in the forest outside the resort or at the tree line, where there are flatter spots in the terrain. Keep in mind that the high altitude makes the nights cold. There usually is no water on the mountain except at the resort.
