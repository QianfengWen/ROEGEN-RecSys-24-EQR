Hook of Holland (Dutch: Hoek van Holland or De Hoek, literally  "The Corner") is a small town on the Nieuwe Waterweg ship canal near the North Sea coast in Rijnmond. It is well connected to the nearby regional hub, Rotterdam. Most notable for travellers is Hook's ferry port, which has had services to the East of England since 1893.


Understand[edit]
Hook of Holland is a part of the municipality of Rotterdam, and it has an advisory council for local affairs. The settlement came into existence when the Nieuwe Waterweg was dug to create a better waterway from the harbor of Rotterdam to the sea.

Get in[edit]
By boat[edit]
The "Stena Hollandica" ferry at Hook of Holland
Ferries from England (UK)[edit]
Stena Lines runs both daily and daily overnight between Hook of Holland and Harwich in Essex (England). (8 hr; €48 one-way foot passenger not including bunk or cabin.)
P&O Ferries runs daily overnight from Hull (England) to the Maasvlakte part of the Port of Rotterdam. (10 hr; €88+ one-way foot passenger not including bunk or cabin.) Then, a local ferry operated by RET links Hook of Holland with Maasvlakte, where the ferry from Hull arrives.
By public transport[edit]
The municipality can be reached by Rotterdam Metro line  B  operated by RET or by bus 31 from Den Haag Leyenburg operated by EBS.
The bus terminates at 51.97574.12821 Hoek van Holland Haven  B , next to Stena Lines and the Rotterdam Metro station. Since April 2023, Line B of the Rotterdam Metro now terminates at 51.986744.106212 Hoek van Holland Strand  B .
You can use an OV-chipkaart to use public transport in the Netherlands, or directly check in and out with a debit or credit card (this is called OVPay) or buy a special travel product from the operator.
For RET, check in and out with a debit or credit card, or buy a ticket at the machine on the Rotterdam Metro. They offer English-language menus and accept debit and credit cards. Cash is being phased out and many ticket machines do not accept cash. Alternatively, use the RET Barcode app to purchase tickets.

By foot[edit]
The Hook of Holland is a hub in the network of European long distance footpaths. It is served by E2 (GR 5), E8 and E9.

By bicycle[edit]
It can be reached by bicycle in about 1 hour from The Hague or Delft, and 1½ hours from Rotterdam. The route is flat, but strong wind near the coast can make the ride more difficult. You might pass some of the largest greenhouses in the world; the greenhouses in this area of the Netherlands produce enormous amounts of fruit, vegetables and flowers for domestic use and export.
There are different networks especially for touristic/recreational cyclists, see for more information the page of the whole region.

Get around[edit]
51°59′15″N 4°7′27″EMap of Hook of Holland

The town is small and easily walkable. However most of the draws for visitors are 2–4 km (30–50 min walking) from town—not all in the same direction—so a bike or car is helpful if you're hoping to fit a lot into your day.

See[edit]
The enormous arms of the Maeslant Barrier can close off the mouth of the waterway to protect against storm surges

Several times per day, guided tours are provided for €4 per person (most are in Dutch, some in English); check the website for time and reservations. It's also possible to get a good, free view of the barrier from the top of the dune next to the visitors center. Once a year (usually in September), the barrier is closed and re-opened for testing. On that day, the place will be relatively crowded.   (updated May 2016)
