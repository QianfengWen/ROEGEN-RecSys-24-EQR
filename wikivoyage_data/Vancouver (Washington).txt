Vancouver is a city in the Southwest Washington region of Washington State, immediately north of the border with Oregon.  Two bridges across the Columbia River connect Vancouver to the rest of the Portland metropolitan area.  Vancouver is the fourth largest city in Washington (and is more populous than all cities in Oregon with the exception of Portland), but is obscured by its close proximity to and economic reliance on Portland, OR.  It should not be confused with the larger city of the same name, Vancouver, BC (Canada) which is just under 300 miles (450 km) to the north.

Downtown Vancouver

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Vancouver is closer to the Portland International Airport PDX IATA than most of Portland, about a 20-minute drive away.  From Portland Airport, take I-205 north across the Columbia River to reach Vancouver, then follow SR 14 west to downtown.
By local bus, from Fisher's Landing in the east part of town, the #65 bus goes down to the Parkrose/Sumner Transit where passengers transfer to the MAX Red Line train to the airport. However, in the afternoon and at night on weekdays, the #65 bus is superseded by the #67 bus, connecting to the airport instead of Parkrose/Sumner Transit Center.

By car[edit]
  Interstates 5 and 205 pass north-south through the city. I-205 serves as an auxiliary highway around the east side of Vancouver through Camas, East Portland, Gladstone, Oregon City and back into I-5 south of Portland at Exit 282.
 SR 14 (in Washington) provide access through the Columbia River Gorge along the Washington side of the Columbia River. SR 14 begins/ends in downtown Vancouver.

Portland Take I-5 or I-205 south (which are the only two crossings) and enjoy.
Olympia, Tacoma, and Seattle are two to three hours north on I-5.
Beacon Rock State Park, about 35 miles East of Vancouver, is one of the Northwest's more enjoyable day trips.  After driving for less than an hour through the scenic Columbia Gorge, you arrive at the base, where it is advisable to use restroom facilities and prepare for a relatively short, but moderately vertical hike up the 1-mile trail to the top of this old volcanic core, the second-largest free-standing monolith in the world (after the Rock of Gibraltar). Spectacular views of the Gorge, the river, and various wildlife will be your reward.  The park also offers camping and more hiking trails, if you feel so inclined or you wish to avoid other hikers.
Mount St. Helens and the Ape Caves are less than an hour north of Vancouver. Get great views of the mountain or drive up closer to the observatory. The Ape Caves are lava tunnels that can be explored, though be sure to bring a very good flash light and warm clothing, because even on the hottest and brightest days, the Ape Caves are cool, dark, and damp. While up there, be sure to stop at one of the many reservoirs for a picnic or a swim.
