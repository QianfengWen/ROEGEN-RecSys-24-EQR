San Gimignano is a pretty medieval walled city in Tuscany, Italy, famous for its historic centre with beautiful towers (inscribed on UNESCO World Heritage List) and great art. It is small enough to be effectively visited as a day trip from nearby cities like Siena and Florence, but it has a different, more peaceful atmosphere at night that many travelers find it worthwhile to experience.


Understand[edit]
The view from Torre Grossa
San Gimignano is a very small city, more like a town in the countryside, but it punches way above its weight in beauty and draw for visitors. Known as the "Town of Fine Towers", San Gimignano is famous for its medieval architecture, unique in the preservation of 14 of its tower houses, which, with its hilltop setting and encircling walls, form an unforgettable skyline. Within the walls, the well-preserved buildings include notable examples of Romanesque and Gothic architecture. Just visiting to walk through, experience the intact centro storico and admire the view of the lovely Tuscan countryside from its high perch is worthwhile, but what makes this place special is the very high quality of its attractions. In a town too small to have a duomo, its Collegiata and the Church of Sant'Agostino both have great frescoes, and the small museum in its little Palazzo Pubblico also contains great art. 

Piazza del Duomo
For these reasons, San Gimignano attracts many tourists every day. At night, when the day trippers have gone back to Siena and Florence, some of the few visitors who decided to stay hang out on the steps of the Collegiata and relax, appreciating the quiet and the clear air.
It was used as a filming location by Franco Zeffirelli as a stand-in for the town of Assisi in his 1972 film Brother Sun, Sister Moon, and for Tea with Mussolini, a 1999 drama. San Gimignano is also featured in the video game Assassin's Creed II.

Get in[edit]
The towers of San Gimignano
By bus[edit]
Buses leave from Florence's bus station (next to the train station) hourly, and take 1.25 - 2 hr including a change in Poggibonsi, costing €6. From Siena take bus #130, which takes 1 hr and costs €5.20, operated by Tiemme SpA. Volterra has 4 buses to San Gimignano every day, that take 2 hours and change in Colle di Val d'Elsa. Sunday buses are fewer and more crowded.
Buses leaving San Gimignano depart from Porta San Giovanni, with tickets sold at the bar just inside the gate or at the Tourist Info.

By car[edit]
You may also arrive by car. You can't drive inside the town walls, but there are several pay parking lots just outside the town walls, with free places further away. The handiest lot, Parcheggio Montemaggio, outside Porta San Giovanni, fills quickly, but they let 1 car in for every one that leaves, so you can wait (€2/hour). There is free parking on the side of the road going down from the turnabout.

By train[edit]
The historical town of San Gimignano on the hill has no train station, but you can easily reach San Gimignano by taking a train to Poggibonsi (labelled "Poggibonsi-S.G.") and then a bus from the Poggibonsi train station to San Gimignano. These buses cost €3.60 (2007) each way, leave every 30-40 minutes, and you can inquire for information, schedules, and tickets at the tourist information office which is located ahead toward the right as you walk out of the train station.  As of November 2018, there is construction: buses leave from the main road and do not stop at the station. 
If you are going from Florence (Firenze) to Poggibonsi, direct trains are not so frequent but you will find many connections to Poggibonsi via Empoli.

On foot[edit]
San Gimignano is very small (you can walk from the gate to the other side of town in 20 minutes), and you must disembark from your car or bus outside the city walls, in any case.

By shuttle bus[edit]
An electric shuttle bus goes all day from Porta San Giovanni to Piazza della Cisterna to Porta San Matteo. The fare is €1, 2 per hour, and you can buy a ticket at Tourist Info or the Tabacchi shop.

See[edit]
Piazza della Cisterna, showing the well (now disused) it is named for
The Piazza del Duomo, the town church's square, is surrounded by thousand-year-old towers. The town's 14 towers are all that remain of the original 72, which were owned by the rich to stay safe when the town was sacked. After Florence took control of San Gimignano, most of them were torn down. The Piazza della Cisterna is a beautiful piazza with an old stone well (no longer used) in the middle. This is where a Thursday market gathers.
