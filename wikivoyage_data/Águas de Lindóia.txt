Águas de Lindóia
Águas de Lindóia is a city in the state of São Paulo. Its mineral water springs remain the primary touristic appeal of the city, although the surrounding area has a growing selection of eco-tourism activities on offer as well.


Understand[edit]
Águas de Lindóia is best known for its mineral water springs, discovered by a pair of Italian immigrants, brothers Henrique and Francisco Tozzi, in the 1900s. Accounts of apparently miraculous cures grew, attracting much attention; rumor has it that Madame Curie visited the springs to investigate. A town coalesced around the springs, becoming an official city in 1938. 

Get in[edit]
From São Paulo by car, take the Bandeirantes Highway to Jundiaí and then pass through Itatiba, Morumgaba, Amparo, Serra Negra, and Lindóia, to finally arrive at Águas de Lindóia.
