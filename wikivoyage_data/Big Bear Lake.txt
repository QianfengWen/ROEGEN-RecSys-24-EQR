Understand[edit]

History[edit]
Big Bear Lake, previously known as Yuhaviat, was discovered by people of European origin back in 1845.  Benjamin Davis Wilson and a crew of twenty men rode into Yuhaviat Valley chasing Native Americans who had been raiding their ranches in Riverside, CA. While in the valley, the men discovered that it was teeming with grizzly bear. Thus, Wilson came up with the name, Big Bear Lake, for the valley.
Before Big Bear Lake became a popular vacation spot, it was known as a gold mining mecca.  In 1860, a bear tracker named William Holcomb discovered a creek filled with flakes of gold while tracking a bear's blood trail.  Word soon got around that there was gold in the valley.  From 1860 to 1875, Big Bear Lake was swarming with prospectors in search of gold.
