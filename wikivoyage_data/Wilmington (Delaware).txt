Wilmington is the largest city in Delaware, though still small by U.S. standards with a population of only 70,000. Due to the state's business-friendly laws, Wilmington is something of a center for businesses, with an incredible number of American corporations incorporated in the city.

Stay safe[edit]
Wilmington is said to be one of the most dangerous small cities in the United States. The violent crime rate is very high, and in the 2010s the city has repeatedly broken its record for homicides in a single year. Most of the violence, however, is related to poverty and drugs (Wilmington's location in between Philadelphia and Baltimore makes it a natural way station for drug traffickers), so it is less likely to affect visitors who stick to the popular business and tourist neighborhoods.
