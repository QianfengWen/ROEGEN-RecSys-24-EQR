Igreja Matriz
 Church of São Sebastião do Porto de Cima (Igreja de São Sebastião do Porto de Cima). Completed in 1850. 
 Matron Church of Nossa Senhora do Porto (Igreja Matriz de Nossa Senhora do Porto), Largo da Matriz. This church was built in the first half of the 19th century to accompany a chapel built in 1769. The clock in the tower has functioned continuously since the church's construction. 
 Nhundiaquara River (Rio Nhundiaquara). Its name a Tupi-Guarani word meaning "fishing hole", this river cuts through the heart of the village, with picturesque trees and colonial buildings on its banks and an antique bridge restored in 1975. The river was once a prime spot to pan for gold and was thus an early source of wealth for the town. 
 São Benedito Church (Igreja de São Benedito), at the corner of Rua Conselheiro Sinimbu and Rua Fernando Amaro. The history of this colonial-style church is unclear, with theories that it was completed anywhere between 1765 and 1884.
