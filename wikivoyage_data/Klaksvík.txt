Klaksvík (Danish: Klaksvig) is the main industrial centre of the Faroe Islands, and the hub of the Northern Islands. It's the second largest city in the Faroes, with a population of 5,015 (as of March 2022).


Understand[edit]
Klaksvík is the second most populated city in the Faroe Islands and the main fishing port. The town is located on the island of Borðoy and serves as a transport hub for the Northern Islands (also called the Norðoyar region), made up of the six northernmost islands of the archipelago. Borðoy is connected to the main islands by a tolled undersea road tunnel, and by dams/causeways to the islands Viðoy and Kunoy. From Klaksvik leaves the ferry to the island Kalsoy and a regular helicopter service to the two most remote islands Svínoy and Fugloy (they can also be reached by ferry from Hvannasund). In Klaksvík, you will find all services: supermarkets and other shops, petrol station, bus station, restaurants, a (rather large) hotel, banks, guesthouses, B&Bs, AirBNBs, a hospital, pharmacy, and even a public swimming pool. It is not clear whether there is a functioning campsite, though. 

History[edit]
The first settlements in the area date back to the Viking era, when there were four farms around the area where the centre of Klaksvík stands today. Of one of these farms, located on the east side of Borðoyarvík, there are the ruins, which were buried by two avalanches within twenty years: the first on 12 March 1745, the other on the same date twenty years later. Not far from these ruins there is also the so-called Íslendingatoftir, a site dating back to the Viking era.
The history of Klaksvík dates back to the Viking Age, around the 9th century, when Norse settlers first arrived on the Faroe Islands. The town's name derives from the Old Norse word "Klakkr," which refers to a mountain, and "vík," meaning bay or inlet. The town is located on a natural harbour, providing a sheltered area for fishing and trade throughout its history.
Fishing has been the mainstay of Klaksvík's economy for centuries, with the town growing around the industry. In the early 20th century, the development of the fishing industry, including modern fishing vessels, processing facilities, and increased trade, led to the rapid growth of Klaksvík. The town became an important hub for the Faroese fishing fleet and played a vital role in the overall economy of the Faroe Islands.
During World War II, Klaksvík served as an important base for British forces, as the Faroe Islands were occupied by the United Kingdom to prevent a potential German invasion. The British presence in Klaksvík helped bolster the local economy during the war years.
In the post-war era, Klaksvík continued to grow and develop, with improvements in infrastructure, education, and healthcare. The town has also diversified its economy, with the emergence of industries such as tourism, renewable energy, and aquaculture.

Geography[edit]
The city is located on the island of Borðoy, on an isthmus between two fjords. It is surrounded by high mountains that rise steep from the shoreline. 

Climate[edit]
The climate is pretty much the same as in the rest of the Faroe Islands; rain is common, and generally the weather is unpredictable.

Get in[edit]
By helicopter[edit]
There are helicopter flights from Tórshavn (the capital). The distance by foot to the town centre from 62.217647-6.5764491 Heliport Klaksvik (EKKVICAO) is 2 km.

By car[edit]
There is a tolled tunnel (Norðoyatunnilin, Road 70) from Leirvik in Eysturoy, which in turn is easily accessible from Tórshavn and the airport in Vágar. Tolls are only collected when you return back to Eysturoy.
All other settlements in the island of Borðoy are connected to Klaksvík by road, and the island's road network also connects to the islands of Kunoy and Viðoy.

By ship[edit]
Ferries to the island of Kalsoy (to Syðradalur) follow a fairly complex schedule, but on average several times a day. The journey takes 20 minutes.

By bus[edit]
There is a bus station 62.226721-6.5844822 Bygdaleiðir, operated by Strandfaraskip Landsins.

Get around[edit]
62°13′43″N 6°35′22″WMap of Klaksvík
You have two options in getting around – walking or driving.
The town is small enough to comfortably walk around; the maximum distance you'll likely need to walk to get from one place to another is 3 km (1.9 mi), and that's if you go from the north end from one side of the harbour to the other. Otherwise, most points of interests are within 0.5–2 km from one another.
Getting around by car is like getting around many other European cities – narrow roads, limited parking and lots of bends and roundabouts.

See[edit]
Churches and memorials[edit]
A view of Christianskirkjan
62.2254-6.586481 Christianskirkjan (Christian's Church). This church was built according to the design of the Danish architect Peter Koch and consecrated in 1963. The name derives from the Danish king Christian X, when the church was consecrated to the dead. This is one of the earliest examples of modern Faroese architecture, which combines national traditions and trends of the modern world. The traditional Faroese wooden church was taken as a model, but the building was not constructed of wood, but of basalt, is much larger than traditional churches, and doesn't have a bell tower.   (updated May 2022)
62.227191-6.5929792 Kvinna við róðrið (Woman by the rudder) (cnr Bumshamarsvegur and Hvitubrekka). A memorial statue of Fridtjof Joensen erected on the 100th birthday of Fridtjof Joensen, a local Faroese artist. (updated May 2022)
Parks and gardens[edit]
62.225198-6.5835923 Vágstún, Vágstún. A small square garden with a memorial in its centre. It's right in front of the InterSport shop, and access to the garden is only from the front of InterSport. (updated May 2022)
62.22481-6.5620484 Viðarlundin Úti Í Grøv (Park of Klaksvik), Oyrarvegur (1.4 km east of visitor centre along Oyrarvegur). A small park that very much resembles a typical Scandinavian rural setting (something that is unusual in the Faroes), alongside the bay with some excellent views of the town and the harbour. The small bridge is also a nice spot for photography. Free. (updated May 2022)
Do[edit]
Climbing Mount Klakkur[edit]
A simple walk to 62.236695-6.6167145 Mount Klakkur takes around three hours round trip from Klaksvik city centre and gives you the opportunity to see the city from above and see the neighbouring islands of Kunoy, Kalsoy and Eysturoy. 
The elevation of the mountain is 413 m (1,355 ft), but the walk starts well above sea level, so, especially at the end, minimal physical preparation is required. No special shoes are needed. However, there are strong winds at the top, and it may suddenly rain, so dress accordingly. 
To get to Klakkur, you must first go from the centre to the heliport, and immediately first turn right (upwards) along the paved road. The road climbs 10 metres and turns right, slowly climbing the mountainside. Along its entire length, you will enjoy beautiful views of Klaksvík and the fjord. It ends with a carpark, from where you'll see a small path leading towards the summit. If you don't have the right shoes, or if you're not in the best of physical shape, you can walk a couple of metres to a small reservoir and look out over the islands of Kalsoy and Eysturoy to the west. Hopefully, go up the path to the top, where there are some weather instruments. It makes sense to walk 30 metres to the precipice, from where there is a good view of Kunoy. 
The way down is the same way you went up, but in reverse.

Go south[edit]
An approximately-5-km-long path starts at the south of the town, going via the peaks 62.199385-6.5775996 Miðfjall to 62.209249-6.5848877 Háfjall (648m high). The path is rocky and steep at some places, but not particularly technical.
