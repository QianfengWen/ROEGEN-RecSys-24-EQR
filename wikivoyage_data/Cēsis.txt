Cēsis (Livonian: Venden, German: Wenden) is a town in Gauja National Park, in the Vidzeme region of Latvia, on the Gauja river, roughly 100 km to the east of the capital Riga..


Understand[edit]
Cēsis Castle
Having only around 18,000 inhabitants, it is a fairly quiet historic town, containing two beautiful castles and parks, houses built in various different time periods and small cobbled streets in the Old Town.
The name Venden or Wenden, respectively, is derived from the Venden, an ethnicity who lived in this place in the 12th century. It is not entirely certain, but they probably spoke a Finnish-Oegonian language.
At the beginning of the 13th century the area was conquered by the Order of the Sword Brothers. Under their regime, in 1206, Cēsis received city rights. Among the Sword brothers and their successors, Cēsis became a prosperous city. In the 14th century the city became Hanseatic.
In 1578, Stefanus Báthory, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, defeated in Russian Tsar Ivan IV, who had invaded Livonia. Livonia was already paying taxes to the Polish king, but in 1598 the city became fully Polish and the capital of the Voivodeship Wenden.
In 1621, the city became Swedish and Russian in 1703. That remained the situation until the Latvian independence in 1918. However, the Polish, Swedish and Russian rule did not reduce the dominant position of the German-speaking elite in Livonia, which had settled here in the Middle Ages as landowners and merchants. Most local executives, as well as notaries, judges and lawyers, were Baltic Germans. But after Latvia became independent their influence changed.
Although the street patterns of the city date back to the Middle Ages, no medieval buildings have been preserved. In the course of history, Cēsis was rebuilt almost the same three times – the last time in 1703. Thus, the oldest buildings date back to the 18th century.

By bus[edit]
Many bus routes exist in the region. Direct connections between Cēsis and other nearby large cities such as Riga and Valmiera exist and departures are fairly frequent - usually once an hour. Connections with smaller towns exist, but may be less frequent, depending on the time of day.
Many buses in the region provide free WiFi access, especially on longer distance routes.

By train[edit]
57.31292925.2815751 Cēsis railway station, Stacijas laukums 1.  (updated Jun 2020)
There are some train routes going through Cēsis, connecting major cities such as Riga (€3.50), Sigulda (€2), Valmiera (€1.55) and Valga, Estonia (€2.90).

By car[edit]
Getting into Cēsis by car is fairly simple. The A2/E77 heads out of Riga in a north-eastern direction and can be followed until the P20 which can then be followed north until turning off west into the town. If following the A2/E77 from a town further east, the P30 (turn-off from A2/E77) can take you straight into Cēsis. From northern towns such as Valmiera, simply following the P20 south until turning off to Cēsis in a similar fashion as when driving from Riga. Following the P14 south-east will also take you straight into Cēsis.
Various turnoffs can be taken from the P20 depending on what the end destination in Cēsis is exactly and should probably be evaluated beforehand.

Get around[edit]

By foot[edit]
The town center is fairly small and can be traversed by foot. Practically all sidewalks are asphalted or have flat brick tiling.

By taxi[edit]
Local taxi companies exist and are reasonably priced making them a viable method of getting around. Regardless, you should always keep an eye out for possible scams related with overpricing such as bumping the meter price up with a touch of a button on the meter.

By bus[edit]
Local public transport exists, but the count of bus departures throughout the day is fairly low making walking to the destination often a much more viable opinion.

 Old Town (Vecpilsēta). 24/7. Various wooden buildings from the 18th and 19th centuries still standing.

Complex with the Medieval Castle, the New Castle and the Cēsis History and Art Museum. The most famous building of Cēsis is the castle, for which construction began in 1209. Before, there was a wooden castle of the Venden people here. The castle became the residence of the Order of the Sword Brothers. It was destroyed in 1577, rebuilt, and destroyed again in 1703. At the end of the 18th century, part of the ruins where used as country house of Count Sievers, the then owner of the castle site. One of the towers was included in his country house. Nowadays, the included city museum is located in that building. The rest of the castle is still mostly in ruins. €10.
