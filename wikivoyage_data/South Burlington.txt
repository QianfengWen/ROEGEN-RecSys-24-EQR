South Burlington is a city in Northwest Vermont.  It is a suburb of Burlington and is the second largest city in the state.  Unlike most sizable Vermont communities, it doesn't have a downtown of any sort since most of the city's development has occurred in the last few decades.  The city has intelligently reserved a large tract of land near the busiest intersection in town to construct a downtown, however they haven't yet decided how they want this done.  Unfortunately, there's nothing there but a dirt road (possibly the only one in the city) and some trees.


Understand[edit]
The main point of South Burlington for the average traveler is that it hosts various relatively inexpensive hotels but is still close enough to neighboring Burlington to be quite convenient for drivers who want to visit the attractions of that city.

Get in[edit]
Map of South Burlington
By car[edit]
South Burlington is accessible via I-89 exit 14, US 2, and US 7.

By plane[edit]
44.471944-73.1533331 Burlington International Airport (BTV  IATA), Airport Drive, ☏ +1 802 863-1889. Flights arrive daily via several carriers from as far away as Chicago O'Hare and Orlando. Travelers from farther afield will have to make a connection in a larger city. There are non-stop flights to Burlington Airport from the following cities (some cities may be seasonal or only offer service certain days of the week): Baltimore, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, Toronto and Washington-National.   
Get around[edit]
On foot[edit]
South Burlington is not a very walkable city.  Although there are sidewalks, heavy traffic and long distances can make walking unpleasant or dangerous.

By bike[edit]
Some roads have bike lanes which makes cycling a viable option in some cases.  However, be aware that not all of the busier roads have bike lanes, and they are often narrower than in other parts of the United States.  Much of Williston Road should be avoided by cyclists.

By public transportation[edit]
South Burlington is served by several CCTA bus routes.  The routes serve Shelburne Road, Williston Road, the University Mall, and Burlington International Airport.

By car[edit]
A car is the easiest way to get around the city, although traffic can be frustrating at times.  Williston and Shelburne Roads should be avoided at rush hour.

See[edit]
South Burlington's suburban nature means there isn't a whole lot to see here aside from the standard views of the lake and mountains.

Drink[edit]
South Burlington doesn't have much in the way of nightlife aside from restaurant bars and the previously mentioned Higher Ground.  The Upper Deck Pub located at The Windjammer has a decent bar and serves a lot of the same food as the restaurant downstairs, often at lower prices. Guild & Company is also well known for the quality of their cocktails.  If coffee is what you're after, skip Starbuck's and try the coffee shop inside Healthy Living.  If you really want nightlife in the area, head to Burlington or Winooski.

Sleep[edit]
Shelburne Road (Route 7) is generally where you will find the least expensive hotels, while the more upscale ones (though check current prices) are on Williston Rd. Both locations are quite convenient to Downtown Burlington, if you drive.

 Comfort Inn & Suites, 5 Dorset St, ☏ +1 802 863-5541. 
44.47009-73.178871 Best Western Windjammer Inn & Conference Center, 1076 Williston Rd, ☏ +1 802 863-1125. 
 Comfort Inn & Suites, 5 Dorset St, ☏ +1 802-863-5541. Check-in: 3PM, check-out: 11AM. 
 Comfort Suites, 1712 Shelburne Rd, ☏ +1 802-860-1112. Check-in: 3PM, check-out: 11AM. 
44.4722-73.18642 Doubletree Hotel, 1117 Williston Rd, ☏ +1 802 658-0250. 
 G.G.T. Tibet Inn, 1860 Shelburne Road, ☏ +1 802-863-7110, info@ggttibetinn.com. Check-in: 3:30PM, check-out: 11AM. This hotel is owned and operated by a Tibetan follower of the Dalai Lama who is friendly and helpful. The front desk is accordingly adorned with pictures of him and is redolent of sweet, mild incense. The rooms are spacious and have furniture that is not in perfect condition but has a slightly faded charm; the couch may be slightly sunken in, but the beds are very comfortable and everything works (or if it really doesn't, the owner, who also works as a housekeeper and electrician, will fix it) — with one exception: You may find the air doesn't circulate so well with the air conditioner, and when you open the windows, the air circulation still may not be perfect, but you will hear the noise from busy Shelburne Road (Route 7). If you believe that noise would prevent you from falling asleep, pay more and go to a different hotel. But otherwise, consider the value you're getting for this price. $79 plus tax per night for any room. (updated Aug 2016)
