The centre of Pucon
Pucón is a small touristy town in the middle of the southern lake district in Chile. Pucón is extremely popular with Chileans and foreigners for the beautiful views of Volcano Villarrica and for mountain-climbing. The night-life is quite active. 


Understand[edit]
The city center is a backpacker's Disneyland, filled with travel agencies offering a wide range of day trips. If you don't like it crowded, you'll be better off in the nearby town of Villarrica. January and February are the busiest months.
The climbing of Volcano Villarrica, which is the highest and most-active climbable volcano in South America, is highly commercialised. You must take a guided tour unless you are a professional climber with a certification. Tour prices sky-rocketed in the mid-2010s. The trail is easy, though.  Local tour guides will admit that the only reason for these rules are to force tourists into expensive guided tours.

-39.276315-71.977661 CONAF (Administration Parque National Villarica), 336 Lincoyán. M-F 08:30-18:30. Reliable information, maps and registration for all the national parks in the region. Non-committal and non-binding. (updated Mar 2018)
Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
Buses travel between Santiago and Pucón daily, many overnight. Tickets are scarce in summer, buy yours sufficiently ahead of your intended departure time.

 Turbus. From Santiago 5 times a day, 11 hr 30 min. 11,500-21,700 pesos. (updated Dec 2017)
 Jac. From Santiago twice daily, 9 hr 23 min. (updated Dec 2017)
You can also take the bus from Valdivia, it takes 3 hr.

By plane[edit]
Pucón's airport operates only during summer (for regular flights); the flights from Santiago are expensive. The closest airport for the remainder of the year is Temuco, to which airlines do the flight in about one hour from Santiago or Puerto Montt. Temuco is about 1½ hours away by road.

By train[edit]
Trains run to Temuco in summer (Dec-Feb), and only to Chillan at the rest of the year. Buses are better value.

By car[edit]
Driving from Santiago takes approximately 8 hours and involves the passing of seven road tolls on the ruta 5, 1,600 pesos each. The road from the turnoff to Pucón is paved and in good shape.
Mainly taxis to places out of town; the town is small enough to walk. Cycling is easy as they have put in cycle lanes along the main road. There are plenty of collectivo buses too and small public buses.

See[edit]
From Pucon's center there are stunning views of Volcan Villarrica, one of the most active volcanoes in Chile.

-39.421025-71.9395631 Climbing Volcano Villarrica. Snowcapped Villarrica (2861 m) looms majestically over Pucón at 2,840 meters (9,318 feet) above sea level. Climbing to the top is non-technical and, on clear days, easy. Thousands of people make the climb each year, most of them in January and February, taking in the spectacular views of Volcans Llaima, Choshuenco, Quetrupillán, Lanin, and Lonquimay in the horizon. Crampons, ice axe and/or trekking poles and warm windproof clothing are essential equipment year round. To be allowed to climb without a guide you must register with Conaf (in town), have your equipment checked and show proof of membership in a mountaineering organization in your home country. Most people start from the skiing area, where you can take the ski lift for the first 300 m. You can also start from near the refugio, at the Mirador Los Craters. From there the climb is longer, but for those carrying skis or snowboards, that means more riding when descending. Getting to the ski area or Mirador Los Craters is easy hitchhiking. Taxis in Pucón will gladly take you there as well. Most of guided excursions begin at around 07:00 but some agencies offer an earlier 05:00 start and you will get to reach the volcano alone with your team, avoiding the big crowds that arrive later. Agencies will provide equipment and transportation and cost around. Most guides won't go further up after 14:00 so get up early and don't waste too much time on your way up. Be sure to check how much money you'll get back if the climb is canceled due to bad weather. Tour prices (as of 2018) see at the end of this chapter. 
-39.5038-71.7092 Climbing Volcano Quetrupillan. Alternatively to the over-commercialised Volcano Villarrica, you can also visit Quetrupillan (2,009 m) right behind it and shoot some great pictures of Villarrica and Lanin, which is even higher, at the border. This trek only requires registration with CONAF and a fee of CLP$5,000. The -39.444-71.79171 trails starts from S-939, which is a side road of 199-CH between Pucón and Curarrehue. The latter is served by a bus. The trails here can be 2-5 days in length, depending on your route. From Quetrupillan it is possible to go back on the southern side of Volcano Villarrica or heading further southeast, which however can be quite muddy. Likewise you can start north at the foot of Volcano Villarrica and circle it west, south and east to head further to Quetrupillan. To find the trails, consult OpenStreetMap, which many mobile Apps like OsmAnd or Mapy.cz use. However, the trail circling Volcano Villarrica is not visible there. So, either way it is a good idea to obtain some non-committal information beforehand from the CONAF office in Pucón. (updated Mar 2018)

-39.1394-71.66553 Huerquehue National Park (buses go from Pucón). 09:00-15:00. A very beautiful and worth a visit national park in close reach of Pucón. Unfortunately, it seems you need to be in and out again between 09:00 and 15:00, which is quite a shame for the price you are supposed to pay and the beauty of the park. They have a camp ground at the -39.1685-71.72582 entrance of the national park though. Nevertheless, it seems that the -39.114-71.7513 eastern entrance and -39.10806-71.614394 western entrance do not have any restrictions enforced, and an official camp ground is available in the centre of the trail. To find all the trails and potential camp grounds, consult OpenStreetMap, which many mobile Apps like OsmAnd or Mapy.cz use. 7,000 pesos. (updated Mar 2018)


 Huerquehue North Trail (green) (Caburgua–Termas). Distance: 19.8 km, hilly to mountainous. Duration: 2-3 days. Grade: Easy to medium (climb to the mountain top viewpoint at 1,750 m can be difficult). Recommended: comfortable clothes and shoes for walking.In case you are looking for an inexpensive, more exciting and more challenging alternative to the overrun and over-commercialised Huerquehue National Park, check out this trail in the northern part of the national park. Great mountain slopes, wide grasslands, impressive forests with immense trees, and picturesque views of the mountains itself and surrounding ones and volcanoes.1) You start in Caburgua from where you take the road along the eastern side of the lake until you reach the beginning of the trail. -39.12504-71.756245 Camp the first night here or continue into the park where you can find further camping opportunities. 2) The next central spot of the trail is the -39.11652-71.679976 Renahue Camping area, from here you hike up to -39.12135-71.685927 Mirador Renahue (Pass of decision). And you either continue further south into the rest of the Huerquehue National Park (and back later) or straight up the mountain to about 1,750 m for picturesque views of the three closeby volcanoes of the region (Villarrica, LLaima, and Lanín). 3) Back at Renahue Camping area, the trail continues towards the termas at its eastern end—take the northern part of this trail, details for the termas see below. Take a dip into their refreshing and heating waters, and put up your tent or continue a little further for a free camp site.There are many camp sites along the trail, as you can see on OpenStreetMap. There are regular buses from Pucon to Caburgua for 800 pesos. Leaving again from the end of the trail (at the termas) is more complicated—in case you intend to hitch-hike, get out of the trail on a Saturday or Sunday when you will also get some weekenders traffic. Otherwise, there is not much local traffic towards Temuco from the termas and waiting/walking for 6 hr is not uncommon. The other road east back to Pucon, however, seems to be more frequented by cars. Or you decide to hike back, taking the southern loop of this trail and then head south via Mirador Renahue through the main touristy part of the national park. Or you come in from the north east, i.e. termas, (with bus or hitch) to begin with. There are sometimes stray dogs along the trail, especially near houses—read Chile#Stay safe for behaviour advice.Download coordinates: GPX, KML.

Skiing and snowboarding. The skiing area on Villarrica[dead link] is open May until the beginning of October. Rent equipment in Pucón, or on the drive up to the ski slope. The highlight of the resort is its amazing views over the lake. It has 4 chairs and 3 T-bar lifts. The resort area goes from 4,527 ft to 5,314 ft, making a total drop of approximately 800 feet. The backcountry possibilities of the resort are great: with the help of a local guide you can ski to the Villarrica Volcano's summit, 9200 feet above sea level. The volcano often has good snow conditions up until November and the duration of the climb and descent is approximately 9 hours, for advance skiers in good shape, but it's really worth the effort.
Golf. In "Peninsula", a residencial area downtown, there is a well maintained golf course with views of the Villarrica volcano and the lake surrounding the course. The course is officially for members only.
Horse back riding. This is a popular way to see the Mapuche settlements like Quelhue in the area. Tour agencies selling these tours are located all over the town. Check the conditions of the horses, as not all of them in good shape. Rides to "Salto el Claro" are in parts beside paved roads. Trustfull agencies are at Ecole and Politur.
Hike past the waterfalls and gurgling brooks in the Huerquehue National Park. Doing this will enable you to get to know the strange Araucaria (monkey puzzle) tree, and other native vegetation such as Coigües and Lingues. The trails pass view points where you can while away the time namedropping volcanoes and Andean peaks. Bring food and water because you might want to stay the whole day.
White water rafting and kayaking is a possibility in the glacier-fed Trancura River. Trancura Bajo offers third-degree rapids, good for beginners. Trancura Alto offers fourth-degree rapids and might require a little more courage. Tour agencies in the town will take you there.

Visit the volcanic caves at Villarrica Volcan.

Go next[edit]
Should Pucon start to feel a bit too touristy, hop on a mini bus and make the 20 minute trip to the little city of Villarrica. It has a population of about 46,000 and escapes the tourist trappings of Pucon.
However, most people will probably decide to head further to either Concepción or Valdivia.
