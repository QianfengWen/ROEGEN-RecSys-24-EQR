Slavonice is a historic town of roughly 2300 inhabitants in 2022 in South Bohemia, near the border with Austria. Because of its well-preserved renaissance centre, it is called "smaller Telč". Slavonice is a charming town and definitely an off-the-beaten-path destination.

Understand[edit]
48°59′51″N 15°21′4″EMap of Slavonice
Slavonice used to be on main trading route from Bohemia to Austria. Most of the buildings in the historic centre are from this era. Then, merchants started to use different routes and Slavonice "fell by the wayside". Thanks in part to that, the historic centre is well-preserved. Before the Second World War the majority of the inhabitants of the town was ethnically German and mostly Lutheran.
