Bajra Sandhi monument in Puputan Park, Denpasar
Denpasar[dead link] is the largest city and capital of Bali, with more than 725,000 residents in 2020. Denpasar is a bustling, multi-cultural city and although it can seem a little intimidating the first time you visit, just do not believe those travel guides which say it has nothing to offer.
Denpasar is bristling with temples, palaces and museums and its occupants are outstandingly friendly. You will be off the beaten tourist track here, so bring lots of time for a chat with the locals and a decent map of town. You can see many of the main sights comfortably on foot.
This is also a notable shopping city with options to please even the most jaded of world shoppers.


Understand[edit]




Where's the airport?
Bali's airport may be coded (DPS IATA) for Denpasar, but it's actually 13 km away near Kuta and covered in Bali § By plane.


Denpasar is the seat of government in Bali and is, therefore, home to the provincial governor's office as well as the administration of the Regency of Badung.

 Tourist Information Office, Jalan Surapati 6, ☏ +62 361 234569. Daily 08:00-16:00. A source of information for current events in the city and for picking up a free map. 
Get in[edit]
8°40′17″S 115°13′29″EMap of Denpasar


By road[edit]
Denpasar is easily reached by car or taxi from the main tourist regions of south Bali. A trip from Kuta, Legian and Seminyak will take 20 to 30 minutes depending on traffic. Sanur is 15 minutes to the east and Ubud about 30 minutes to the north. Tabanan is about 40 minutes to the northwest.
A non-metered taxi from the airport will cost Rp 180,000.

By bus[edit]
The main bus terminal of Denpasar is -8.5594115.16821 Mengwi.  The former bus terminal at Ubung is now only a bemo terminal.
Most buses from Java arrive at Mengwi. You should only turn up without a ticket in the morning, as early as possible, when departures are frequent. At other times, check schedules and reserve online. 

From Surabaya, Java: expect to pay Rp175,000 - 200,000 by eksekutif night bus depend on the bus operator (famous: restu, wisata Komodo), including the ferry trip between Banyuwangi and Gilimanuk, mineral water and a meal. Buses leaves from the Bungurasih bus terminal in Surabaya. Duration 10 hr.
Other services operate from most big cities in Java, including Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Bandung and Semarang.
For high season Eid Fitri and new year allowing extra Rp50,000 - 100,000 per ride per person.
Local minibuses depart regularly in the direction of Gilimanuk, the ferry terminal to Java, from opposite the bus terminal entrance.

By bemo[edit]
The bemo centre of Bali is -8.6351115.20592 Ubung.  Inconveniently, bemo terminals are scattered all around town, and transfers between them can be time and money consuming. The major ones are:

-8.6315115.26063 Batubulan, 6 km northeast, for points central and east: (Besakih, Candidasa, Kintamani, Klungkung, Padangbai, Ubud).
-8.6622115.20864 Tegal, to the west, for southern Bali: (Kuta, Legian,Jimbaran, Nusa Dua, Sanur, Uluwatu).
Ubung, to the north, for points north and west: (Gilimanuk, Negara, Singaraja, Tabanan). From Bedugul, about Rp 40,000 for 1h15 (likely foreigner price; May 2024).
Always ask a local for the normal price before getting in or expect to be charged a price up to ten times what it should be.
Don't forget that a bemo departs when it wants (usually when it is "full enough"), which can sometimes require a lengthy wait, except in the early morning, where they are rather frequent. In any case, you won't find any bemo after 16:00.

By train[edit]
There is no train station in Denpasar because there are  no trains in Bali.
At Mengwi bus terminal you can buy so-called "train tickets" to Surabaya, including a bus (air-conditioned) to Banyuwangi, and the ferry between Gilimanuk and Ketapang, and then a train from Banyuwangi to Surabaya.
Price (including a commission to the travel agency):

Low season: Business Rp190,000 - 235,000, Executive: Rp240,000 - 290,000

14:45 from Denpasar, train departing 22:00 from Banyuwangi, arrival 04:17 in Surabaya.
Get around[edit]
Denpasar can be a bit steamy and the traffic pollution a worry, but the centre of this city does lend itself to getting around on foot and walking is recommended.

By bus[edit]
Buses connect various places around the city and surrounding called Trans Metro Dewata or Teman bus. An electronic money card is required to take this public transport such as Brizzi, E-money, Flazz, and TapCash or pay with qris (gopay, ovo...). The routes and bus stops can be looked at from Moovit app and Google Maps. Near real-time gps position with mobile app Mitra Darat (Indonesian only but usable).

By taxi[edit]
Taxis are widely available for hailing. If you have a group of people, you may want to negotiate a bemo (small van) for a set rate to your destination. Remember that pricing is negotiable. Indonesians are great people, however, they won't think twice about overcharging you if they can.

By bemo[edit]
Bemo routes in Denpasar are extremely complicated. In addition to the three terminals described in the section above which operate longer distance bemos, there are three more which handle the local routes (as do the long distance terminals!) - Gunung Agung, Sanglah and Kereneng. Unless you are very patient and somewhat adventurous, bemo transport within Denpasar is best left to the locals to figure out. As a rule of thumb though most routes in the city seem to come through Kereneng Terminal on Jalan Kamboja at some stage.
To go from one bemo terminal to another within the city, the fixed price is Rp7,000 although non-Indonesians may be asked to pay much more. A taxi can work out cheaper, is certainly faster and is indescribably more comfortable.

By motorbike[edit]
As elsewhere in Bali, motorbikes can be rented, although it is more normal for a visitor to arrive with a bike rather than rent one here.

See[edit]
When visiting any of the temples in Denpasar, remember to bring a sarong and sash with you. These temples receive relatively few foreign visitors and are unlikely to have temple dress available for hire or loan.

-8.657139115.217671 Alun-Alun Puputan (Puputan Square, Alun Alun Kota Denpasar, Lapangan Puputan Badung I Gusti Ngurah Made Agung), Dauh Puri Kangin, Denpasar Barat, Denpasar City, Bali 80232. The huge four-faced, eight-armed Catur Mukha statue is situated here at the centre point of the city (Jl Gajah Mada/Jl Suprati). Representing the Lord Brahma and it serves as a guardian of each cardinal point. The square is a key point of orientation for the whole city.

-8.6575115.2185282 Bali Museum (Museum Negeri Propinsi Bali), Jl Mayor Wisnu (eastern side of the Alun-Alun Puputan), ☏ +62 361 222680. Sat-Thu 08:00-16:30, Fri 08:00-14:30. A much under-patronised place by visitors which offers an informative introduction to all things Balinese, both historical and modern-day. It was opened in 1910, but the building was brought down in the 1917 earthquake and languished until 1932 when resident German artist Walter Spies sparked a major revival. The grounds and architecture are quite charming, and the museum is housed in four separate pavilions. The main pavilion has a great collection including ancient stone, bronze and wooden artifact. The southern pavilion houses many textiles, the northern pavilion concentrates on the history of Balinese performance art, and the central pavilion is devoted to Balinese Hinduism and ritual. If this place was in Kuta or Nusa Dua it would be swamped with tourists. Foreigners adult/children Rp 100,000/50,000, domestic Rp 30,000/20,000, students domestic or Bali Rp 5,000-20,000, customary or pre-wedding photo Rp 1,000,000-2,000,000.   (updated May 2024)
Pura Maospahit

This rather grandiose park is home to the huge Bajra Sandhi monument (literally Balinese People's Struggle). The design of the grey stone monument symbolises the date of Indonesian independence, August 17th 1945. There are eight entrances, 17 corners and the height is 45 m. The monument is most significant though for its commemoration of the various puputans (suicidal fight to the death) of the Balinese in the struggle against the Dutch in the early 20th century. At the northern edge of the park you will find the governor's office and other government buildings. (updated May 2024)

Taman Budaya Cultural Centre
-8.653794115.2100895 Pura Maospahit (Maospahit Temple), Jl Sutomo. TBD 09:00-18:00?. An ancient temple with a long and glorious history thought to originate in the 14th century. This is a temple typical of the peak of the Majapahit period being constructed largely from red brick. Sadly, much of it was destroyed in the early 20th century earthquake but there are some original remnants including the guardian statues in the inner courtyard. This is a charming temple and one which is seldom visited by tourists, and so there's every chance you will have it to yourself.   (updated May 2024)
-8.6633115.24046 Sidik Jari Museum (Finger Painting Museum), Jl Hayam Wuruk 175, ☏ +62 361 23511. 09:00-17:00 daily.

Do[edit]
It is very much worth finding information from the official tourism office about scheduled cultural events in Denpasar. These are many and varied and include, dance, puppet theatre and art exhibitions.
Otherwise, apart from the numerous sights and excellent shopping, there are not really any specific activities to recommend in Denpasar.

Buy[edit]
Contrary to what you might read in many guide books, the best shopping in Bali is in Denpasar.

Jalan Gajah Mada, Denpasar
Badung Central Market, Jl Gajah Mada is best visited in the early morning. The ground level is devoted to fresh foodstuffs, dried food and spices are on the second level and handicrafts can be found on the top level.
Duta Silk, fabulous silk emporium located at Block 1, Komplex Duta Permai (next to Matahari Department store) on Jalan Dewi Sartika.
Gold, competitive jewellery prices abound in Jl Hasanuddin and Jl Sulawesi.
The myriad of small stores selling fabrics and local works in Jl Gajah Mada and Jl Thamrin will keep happy even the most jaded of world shoppers.
There are several shopping malls in Denpasar, the most notable being Ramayana on Jl Diponegoro, Matahari Duta Plaza on Jl Dewi Sartika, and Level 21 Mall on Jl Teuku Umar. These malls have a huge range of stores selling everything from clothing to arts and crafts as well as more everyday shops such as pharmacies.
Eat[edit]
Denpasar is a melting pot of different cultures from all over Indonesia. There are few places where the results of the government trans-migration policy are more evident than here. For that reason it is a wonderful place to eat with restaurants specialising in different regional and ethnic Indonesian cuisines. Sometimes this can all seem a bit inaccessible and hard to find for visitors, so do not be shy to ask your driver or at your hotel.
