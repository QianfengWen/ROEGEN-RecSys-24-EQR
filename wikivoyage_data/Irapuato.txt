Understand[edit]
Irapuato's historic center
It lies between the Silao River and the Guanajuato River, a tributary of the Lerma River.
Although it is now an important center for regional trade and transportation center as well the site of several automotive and chemical manufacturing plants, the city's main industry has historically been agriculture and it has long been known for its strawberries and the raising of pigs and cattle. The fruits and flowers of Irapuato's luxurious gardens are well-known throughout Mexico.
Among its historical-artistic and architectural heritage are the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Clean Conception of María, the Municipal Palace, the Temple of Hospitalito, the City Museum and the emblematic Mural of Identity in the central square of Vasco de Quiroga, in commemoration of whom local tradition mentions as the founder of the town.

You'll want to use a secure taxi (such as those called by your hotel front desk staff), or a ride-hailing app. Uber service is widely available in Irapuato and is one of the safest ways to get around. The city of Irapuato has an extensive municipal bus system that operates roughly from 06:00 to 22:00, though routes vary. Local bus timetables are here.
