Kampala[dead link], the City of Seven Hills, is the capital city of Uganda and is, by a very large margin, the largest city in the country.  Secondary to it is Jinja to the east and Entebbe to the south.  Kampala is in the south central part of Uganda, near the northern shores of Lake Victoria.


Understand[edit]
The people of Kampala, and Ugandans in general, are very kind, friendly and approachable.
Kampala, with a population of approximately 1.7 million, and 6.7 million in the metro area (2019), is by far the largest city in Uganda.  Although a smaller city with less suburban sprawl than Nairobi or Lagos, the traffic jams and pollution can be every bit as bad.  If you are travelling around the city, plan your days carefully to avoid spending many hours in the city traffic.
Uganda, as the recipient of massive amounts of Western aid money, hosts many non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Most of these are based in Kampala, so there is an established expat scene in the city.

A facet of Kampala's weather is that it features two annual wetter seasons. While the city does not have a true dry season month, it experiences heavier precipitation from August to December and from February to June. However, it is between February and June that Kampala sees substantially heavier rainfall per month, with April typically seeing the heaviest amount of precipitation at an average of around 169 millimetres (6.7 in) of rain.

Heritage[edit]
The Kasubi Tombs, the site of the burial grounds for four kabakas (kings of Buganda), is a UNESCO World Heritage Site partially damaged by fire in 2010.

Get in[edit]
Entebbe Airport
By plane[edit]
When coming to Kampala by air, you will actually arrive in the city of Entebbe, 35 km (22 mi) southwest of Kampala.
You can get from Entebbe airport to Kampala:

By Private Hire taxi (approx USh 75,000 one way)
By the Pineapple Express - Via Kampala and Jinja - (US$10-22) - http://www.entebbejinjashuttle.com/
By the Airport express bus. http://entebbeairportexpress.com [formerly dead link]  USh 30,000 has ten trips per day both ways.
By Boda-Boda/shared taxi (matuta) (approx USh 7000 one way), this requires you to get the short distance (4 km) from the airport to Entebbe city on a Boda-Boda =USh 3500. you will need to walk from the airport to the airport gate to get a Boda-Boda. then Matuta from Entebbe to Kampala =USh 3500.
By hotel shuttle (e.g. if you have a reservation with Sheraton ask for their shuttle - USh 39,000 added to your hotel bill, for one-way trip if shared -chances are very high there are other hotel guests arriving on your flight).
By rail[edit]
Discussions on improving the railway service within Uganda has dragged on for years, with the the massive project to build a new semi-high speed railway from neighboring Kenya stalled. However as of 2024 some progress on renovating the 100 year old metre-gauge network has been made. Passenger services are still limited to commuter trains from Namanve, in the eastern suburbs of Kampala, and from Port Bell. The national operator Uganda Railways Corporation has promised to launch intercity trains, but nothing has materialized so far.

0.31251532.5884391 Kampala railway station. (updated Dec 2019)
Get around[edit]
There are three methods of public transport: boda-bodas, matatu and special hires.

By boda-boda[edit]
The fastest and most dangerous method is the boda-boda: motorcycles that you see all over the city. You won't be in Kampala long before being propositioned by a boda driver.  If you're not interested, a simple 'no' will get them to leave you alone.  You can get most anywhere on the back of one for USh 2000-5000, but make sure to agree on the fare before the ride begins. 
Boda-bodas are extremely dangerous as their riders will do whatever it takes to get you to your destination quickly.  Expect to dart in front of and against traffic and even though crowds of pedestrians when necessary.  Boda-boda accidents account for most of the hospital visits and traffic fatalities in Kampala; you have been warned!

Boda Bodas
Boda-bodas got their name from the bicycle taxis that operated at some of the busy border crossing points.  Buses had to discharge their passengers at the exit border control, who then had to walk to the entry border control.  The distance across no man's land at some borders can be considerable. Hence the bicycle taxis would cry "boda-boda" (a corruption of the English "border to border") to the weary travellers.  These bicycle taxis can still be found in most smaller Ugandan towns, however, in Kampala they have been replaced by motorcycles. Boda-bodas charge USh 3000-5000 for trips within Kampala (foreigner price; correct at July 2011). It is almost impossible to get anywhere for under USh 2000, and longer trips may run you up to USh 7000.
In-app Boda-Boda rides around Kampala are focusing more on passenger safety with the introduction of the mobile App-Based motorcycle transport service providers who are trained, more professional and have helmets for passengers. The rides are ordered in the app and fares are shown before confirming the request. Most service providers allow payments via the app or cash payments. These app-based boda-boda service providers in and around Kampala include SafeBoda, Uber, Bolt,

By matatu[edit]
Matatus are a series of minibuses that follow relatively pre-set routes all over the city and many other parts of the country.  Confusingly, they are known as taxis in Uganda.  It might be a bit confusing in the beginning how to use the matatus to efficiently get where you want to go, but it's not so difficult.
Their routes usually go between the city centre and some suburb. The majority of matatus to/from the suburbs leave/finish inside or around the
0.3120132.576981 old taxi park. 
Some, e.g. those going along Ggaba road to Kabalagala, Kansanga, Bbunga, Ggaba and Munyonyo, leave inside the
0.3105732.576212 Cooper Complex. 
This can be hard to find since that's basically inside a shopping mall. Other matatus leave directly from the streets around the old taxi park or farther away up to Kampala road, and some leave from the
0.31390732.5732853 new taxi park. 
Although that park is mainly reserved for matatus and larger buses going further out to all corners of Uganda and neighbouring countries.

A matatu and boda bodas in Kampala
Matatus will stand in the park until they are full, something that normally takes less than 15 minutes, but can take over half an hour (or even over one hour late at night or on Sundays).  Matatus that leave the area around the park are hence full, which makes it difficult to hop on a matatu at other places in the city centre.  Unless you're very lucky, you'll have to go to where the matatus start in order to leave the city centre.
Each matatu has a driver and a conductor. Don't be frightened if you can't understand what they're saying. Ask one of them for your destination and you'll be told yes or no. When you get in, expect to be squeezed. Each vehicle is licensed to carry 14 people, but they will pack in as many will fit (and their belongings). If you don't like this it's a good idea to sit in the back of the vehicle, since usually the squeezing is limited to the first 2 rows. Once the matatu starts moving people can get off at any time. When you reach your destination, tell your conductor "Stage" and they will stop the van.
Whenever a matatu has empty space the driver will go slowly and honk repeatedly. If you want to get on, just make some gesture and it will slow further down and shout out the destination, just shout your destination as response and they will pick you up if it's along the way. There are often also a number of further staging points along the way where the driver will again stop and wait until they can fill the vehicle. This can take a few seconds or several minutes; just be patient. In some cases drivers won't take you if you only go relatively short distances, since that will mean they'll risk losing money if they can't fill your place quickly once you're dropped. You pay the conductor when you exit, although some people give the conductor money while the vehicle is moving so that he can make change ahead of time. The normal fare is USh 500-1,500 per person when driving into the city (November 2015).
Going with a matatu is generally cheap, safe, slow and nice. Ugandans are often happy to start up a conversation or help you out, and if the conductor tries to overcharge you or make you take an inefficient route, passengers are likely to point that out to you and scold him. People also complain if a driver takes too long to wait for passengers or drives recklessly and will even collectively quit the van in protest if a driver drives too badly.

By special hire[edit]
If you aren't up for the thrill of the bodas and don't have time for a matatu, taxis, also called special hires, are readily available at most central locations.  A few taxis have meters, but most have not.  Be sure to agree on the fare before you get in the car or you may be in for a nasty shock.  Don't be afraid to haggle either; most destinations can be reached for USh 15,000 or 20,000.
Yellow taxi company is reliable, offering 24-hour service, phone +256 713 133 331, with fixed prices: USh 10,000 for trips within Kampala; USh 60,000 for trips to/from the airport. Prices as of December 2010. They also have an allocated single taxi rank space outside Nakumat.
Ride hailing apps like Bolt and Uber work in Kampala.

Car rental[edit]
Several agencies offer car rental, with or without driver. While self-driving in Kampala may not seem tempting, car rental is a great option to explore the rest of the country. Upon request, most businesses can get you safely out of Kampala before handing over the keys.

By city bus[edit]
Large city buses that run on fix routes.  This mode of transport is still limited but some buses run along Jinja Road, which has some designated bus stops.  All the city buses start at Constitutional square on Kampala road.  The fare is USh 1000.
One city bus goes to and from Constitutional Square past Acacia mall, and one bus goes to and from Constitutional Square past Lugogo Mall.

Buy[edit]
Large parts of Uganda are well suited for agriculture and as a result Kampala has some very large and diverse food and agriculture markets. Traditional handmade tools, arts and crafts are also big. However there are also several large western style malls and supermarkets (e.g. Shoprite from South Africa, Carrefour from France. If you're in the market for souvenirs, check out the Exposure Africa Crafts Village on Buganda Road or the slightly larger Uganda Arts & Crafts Village behind the National Theatre, near the Garden City complex. Also on Buganda Road across the street from the craft market you find a number of tailors if you are looking to have clothes sewn. And if you're tired from shopping the (upscale) cafe 1000 Cups of Coffee is a relaxing Mzungu hangout.

Eat[edit]
There are a number of dining options in Kampala ranging from the cheap and local to the very fancy (and very expensive).

Budget[edit]
Everywhere you go you'll see signs for little hole-in-the-wall restaurants (including some called "pork joints"). Most of these places don't have menus, so you'll have to ask what's available. Common options include meat (usually beef), rice, beans, Matoke (steamed green bananas, served mashed).  Common dishes that can be found in most of the city restaurants and in the country side are fish and chips, and chicken and chips.  These meals vary in servings and will cost between USh 4500-9000.  Be sure to ask the price ahead of time so that you don't get surprised later on.  Prices are typically USh 500 per item, but can vary.  Sodas and bottled water will cost more too.  Matoke with groundnut sauce can be delicious!
For a street snack, the famous "Rolex" is very enjoyable. It is made out of a chapati (kind of a pancake) wrapped around an omelette, with cabbage and tomatoes.  Expect to pay USh 700-1000.  Other street food includes roast chicken, goat and beef.  This is usually served with chips or a salad or both.  Pricing is per piece USh 2000-4500.  If you are looking for something healthier but still want to enjoy the experience of roadside eating, the best bargain is with roasted corn or maize.

Mid-range[edit]
Jinja Road is a good place for a variety of meals.

Garden City. The food court at this shopping center offers a wide variety of options including Lebanese, Italian, Indian, and more. There are particularly good masala dosas served in the food court. Unlike a traditional food court, you order from a menu and a waiter brings food to your table. There is a good Indian restaurant named Nawab on the roof of Garden City, and a steak restaurant that's quite good.

Kayali Restaurant & Lounge, 7a Yusuf Lule Rd. Some little victuals. +256 787 205949
Fang Fang Chinese Restaurant: one of the best Chinese places. There are two in Kampala: one with an attached hotel (nearer to the Sheraton) and open to outdoors (so don't forget to wear insect spray).

 The Bistro. 
Drink[edit]
Drink only bottled water - spring water brands like Rwenzori and Blue Wave can be trusted - or tap water that has been boiled/treated appropriately.

Alcohol[edit]
If you feel like going out, go out, you should be safe, just exercise common sense. Ugandans are very sociable. Kampala's nightlife centers around the neighborhoods Bukoto and Kabalagala.  Several clubs are also in the Industrial area (e.g. along 1st/6th Street) and along Kampala Road plus Acacia Avenue. Popular clubs are Club Silk, Venom Club, Club Amnesia, Casablanca, Cayenne Restaurant and Lounge, the Mask Lounge Club and Ange Noir.  Going out clubbing in Kampala can be very expensive.

0.2979432.601741 Evening out in Kabalagala (3 km south-west from city center along Ggaba road, many matatus go there). Kabalagala is an area with many bars and restaurants that is very lively at night and popular both amongst locals and expats. Go there, have fun and get to know some locals, but keep in mind that some girls (not the majority) are actually there to work. Kabalagala has everything from shabby waragi shacks to fancy establishments like Club Venom at the top of Tirupati Mazima Mall. 
0.3481732.597682 Evening out in Bukoto (around Bukoto-Kira Road, north of Kololo hill). Bukoto began as a purely residential suburb, but is now spawning many popular nightlife spots. Good alternative to Kabalagala and less mzungus than further down along Acacia Avenue. 
0.332932.586843 Expat night at Bubbles O’Leary’s (across the golf course away from city center, left on Acacia Avenue), ☏ +256 31 2263815. Bubbles is an Irish pub in Kampala that serves as the main expat hangout (along with several other places along Acacia Avenue). Go there to get some (shocking) insights into the giant industry that is NGOs, aid and volunteering in Uganda. 
0.3210732.601244 Clubbing in the Industrial Area. Some very fancy clubs with steep prices, others more normal, lots of showing off, students enjoying themselves, dance floors fill easily, good dancing, some old mzungu men, hookers, ... partly bizarre but in the end the same as everywhere else around the world. The popular Club Silk, Ange Noir and T1 are on First Street. Several other clubs are on 6th Street. 
0.3275232.598615 The Lawns Restaurant & Lounge Bar, Impala Avenue, Kololo (on south-eastern slope of Kololo hill, close to where airstrip ends). Good if you want a quite and tranquil environment. The Lawns offers beautiful garden lounge bar. Try their wide range of cocktails or wine with amazing starters. 
Uganda does, however, have a serious drink problem with the UN saying it has the highest alcohol consumption rate in the world, much of this is sold on backstreets, hence official figures don't rate it so highly.  Don't let this put you off, the city is still safe even with this undesired tag.

Coffee and juice[edit]
 Cafe Javas. Good chain that is at several locations around the city. Has working Wi-Fi. Midrange pricing. 
0.3173432.576366 1000 Cups Coffee House, Buganda Road (across the road from the craft market), ☏ +256 772 505 619, +256 782 544 313. Upscale coffee shop popular amongst mzungus. Serving several regional varieties of coffee, American style.

Gym, spa, and choice of restaurants with lake views. Free cable internet to rooms, but Wi-Fi only in the foyer and restaurant areas.   
Stay safe[edit]
Kampala is a relatively safe city. It is fairly safe to walk or take matatus around some areas at night, but don't take unnecessary chances. Kampala is not safe to walk around in after dark, especially if you are a white. It is assumed that all whites have money. It is also not safe to drive around, day or night, with your windows down or unlocked. Someone could reach in through the window and take your cell phone right out of your hand or open the door and take your laptop right off your lap.
Air pollution is among the worst in the world, so again, keep your windows up, doors locked and set your car button to circulate the air and not take in external air, especially if you are following a diesel powered MV.
Boda-boda motorcycle taxis are notoriously dangerous, but are sometimes so convenient it's difficult not to use them. If you do decide to use them regularly consider buying a helmet (they are not provided by the driver).  Although it defies logic at first glance, you might want to consider taking a boda-boda in which the driver does not have a helmet.  Drivers without helmets tend to drive slower, and as they never have helmets for the passengers, this means that you are a bit safer. With the introduction of the in-app Boda-boda riders, you can ride safer on a motorcycle in Kampala.
Don't plan on using your credit card.  If it is accepted, there is a good chance of fraud. Safer is withdrawing money from ATMs using your Mastercard or Visa-card.  Many ATMs take Mastercard or Visa card. Ecobank, Equity bank, Stanbic are the banks that takes MasterCard branded cards. Barclays Bank Uganda has a fee at all its ATMs for all overseas banks cards.
To stay safe, also be aware of the many prostitutes in Rock Garden at Speke Hotel. There are several stories about guys being duped, drinking beers laced with rohypnol, ending up short on cash, cell phones, credit cards and bank cheques.

Connect[edit]
Internet[edit]
In May 2013, the Sheraton Hotel had unsecured Wi-Fi. Although the connection is not particularly fast or the signal strong on the ground floor or first floor buffet breakfast restaurant, "executive floor" 4 has a strong and fast connection and comfortable sofas to the left of the lift. There's a good 360-degree view of the city from the rooftop at stop 11 of the elevator.

Go next[edit]
Any place in Uganda can be easily reached from Kampala in less than one day. Most popular destinations can be reached in less than half a days driving time, however if you use public buses, allow for some hours waiting time before the bus leaves, and sometimes the bus will get stuck in traffic when trying to leave Kampala.

Jinja, one source of the Nile and amazing whitewater rafting can be reached in around one hour.
Fort Portal, in the vicinity of the popular Queen Elizabeth National Park, the Kibale Forest National Park and the Rwenzori National Park, can be reached in around 4 hours.
Kabale, Lake Bunyonyi and the gorillas in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park can be reached in around 5-6 hours.
Driving to Gulu takes 4-5 hours by bus.
Murchison Falls National Park also takes about that time to reach.
Tororo, Mbale and Mount Elgon National Park can be reached in a couple of hours to less than half a day.
Furthermore, it used to be possible to reach Ssese Islands from Port Bell in Kampala with the MV Amani, but that service seems suspended and the main ferry from Entebbe, MV Kalangala, is in prolonged repairs.
Equator line: just go to the New taxi park and get on Kampala-Equator mini buses (USh 7000) or the Kampala-Masaka Mini buses (USh 12000). The final stop of Kampala-Equator mini buses are few meters away from the Equator line. They make u turn and head back to Kampala. It is 1.5-hour drive from Kampala. The equator line is just before the town of Kayabwe. There is water flow demonstration (a hoax) for (USh 10,000). All the mini bus drivers know when and where you should get off.
Many safari tour companies operate out of Kampala and drive their customers to the national parks, but it is also possible to arrange trips in Fort Portal for example (or go with your own car of course).
Matatus and larger buses out of Kampala leave mainly from the new taxi park. A few may still also leave from the old taxi park. There are many companies (almost 100) that run larger tour buses that leave from numerous bus terminals/stations surrounding the new taxi park, or for buses going east into Kenya at De Winton Road. You can take buses of differing sizes and quality going to all major cities in Uganda and to Juba (South Sudan, min. 12 hr), to Malaba, Eldoret, Nakuru, Nairobi and Mombasa in Kenya, and to Kigali (Rwanda); amongst others. Sometimes there are more or less direct buses to Tanzania (like Dar es Salaam, Arusha, Moshi and Bukoba), but those lines do not seem very profitable since companies pop up and disappear quickly (TZ is not so nice with border fees/customs/trade/immigration/etc. so there is less demand for travel there combined with higher costs).
In general bus operators, schedules, prices and routes change constantly, so information found on the internet will often be out of date. If you want to go somewhere it is best to try to find a phone number where you can confirm departures or just ask around where buses going there and there leave, and go there early in the morning. Keep in mind that some companies will consistently employ bad drivers, and accidents do happen, so it is worth using a company that has a good reputation (some of which should be listed below). Also, while the minibuses (matatus) are relatively safe when traveling in Kampala's crowded and slow moving traffic, they are generally considered relatively unsafe on the fast roads in the countryside populated by heavy trucks and buses. Bigger buses are safer, especially since at least some of them are run by larger companies that care about their reputation and are better regulated/monitored by the government. An up to date list of bus routes going east is this[dead link]. An older but more comprehensive list of bus routes out of Kampala is here.
