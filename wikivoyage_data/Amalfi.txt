By bus[edit]
 SITA Coach, ☏ +39 89 405 145. Buses along the coast from Sorrento to Amalfi 2-3 times per hour. Buses travel from Salerno via Minori, Cetara and Vietri. Local buses link Amalfi to Ravello and the upper reaches of Furore, Pogerola, Agerola and Napoli. Choose the region "Campania" from the website to find the timetables. Tickets cannot be purchased on board but are very easy to find in bars, newsagents, etc. The Sita buses are the least expensive option, but can be slow, and are often very crowded. (updated Oct 2019)
 City Sightseeing. Apr-Oct only. Hourly buses from Sorrento to Amalfi (1 hr 30 min up to 2 hr); €10 one stop, €6 for the return ticket. From Ravello every half-hour, €5. (updated Oct 2019)
July and August are prime months for people-moving so the buses can become very crowded so make sure you are at the front of the pushy crowd when the bus pulls up otherwise it is a long wait for the next one.
It is a comfortable way to travel along the Amalfi Coast and Sorrentine Peninsula on the bus, however if you are prone to motion sickness the hairpins on these roads will certainly induce symptoms very quickly!   SITA offers a very efficient public transportation service in the area, with expert drivers who breeze along the winding roads like they were driving on a highway (you will be happy to know that they are experienced).  Here is something that you might need to know to know before you board your bus.

You have to buy your tickets in advance, before you get on the bus.  Tickets can be bought at caffe bars, some have a black and white sign 'Tabacchi' hanging out the front while some stores selling lotto tickets also sell bus tickets so look out for these too. Shops also which display the SITA logo as well as at the SITA ticket office at the Salerno train stations. If a bar does not sell SITA tickets, you can always ask where you can find them as they are generally helpful.
As you get on the bus you have to clip your ticket in the yellow/orange machine that you will see in front of you as you climb the steps.  If you are not able to get the machine to clip your ticket, ask the driver to do it for you.  Do not forget to clip the ticket: during your trip an agent will board the bus and ask to check the ticket.  If the ticket is not clipped you will have to pay a fine

By train[edit]
The two main train stations serving the Amalfi Coast are Salerno which has direct Frecciarossa high-speed and inter-regional train connections to Naples and Rome and the local Circumvesuviana over in Sorrento which is the main train line which connects Sorrento to Naples and importantly, Sorrento to Pompeii ruins. Conveniently, both stations are also hubs for cheap, efficient bus and ferry services radiating toward the major tourist destinations along the Amalfi Coast and inland.

By car[edit]
It is simple to hire a car for your stay - but driving in southern Italy is not for the faint-hearted! The Amalfi Coast roads are very narrow and cliff-hanging, and will either provide a challenging drive.  But there are many spots to stop along the coastal roads and small towns that are only easily accessible if you have your own car.
For those who are truly adventurous, scooters can be a practical form of transport, however precision driving is key.
The ferry and bus services on the Amalfi Coast offer excellent connections between towns and the price of parking could also put you off hiring a car.
Amalfi is 270 km from Rome, 70 km from Naples, 60 km from Avellino and 85 km from Caserta.

Understand[edit]
Amalfi is one of the bigger towns on the Amalfi coast. It has squares connected by pedestrian streets full of restaurants, souvenir shops and tourists.

Nearby is Bar Savoia for very good cakes to take away.

Grand Caffe overlooking the main beach is also nice for a drink (their light lunches are very hit and miss however) with lovely relaxing views up the coast while the Marina Grande restaurant operate a bar on the beach with funky decor and candle-light, which is a very good choice on a hot summer night.
Bar Flavio Gioia opposite the main ferry pier and parking bay has the best gelato in town and offers a good pit stop before taking a bus from the nearby terminal or catching a ferry.
For dancing, you will have to take yourselves to Praiano to the famous Africana nightclub or onto Positano to an equally popular disco hub, Music on the Rocks or up to Positano's chic Next2 bar.
