The church seats 1200 people, the gallery another 124 and the small chapel 50 people. Everything, even in the interior, was designed by Alvar Aalto.

Tangomarkkinat[edit]
 Seinäjoki Tango Festival (Tangomarkkinat): July annually, ☏ +358 06 420-1111, info@tangomarkkinat.fi.  Forty-year anniversary 11–14 July 2024. A "dance camp" with dance courses (all levels, taking individual lessons possible) starts already on Tuesday.  
The Tango Festival gathers a huge crowd of over 100,000 people every year. There are several tango dance floors around the festival area – either in front of the stages or in some karaoke bars – as well as several events to please different kinds of tastes. There is even a “Tango-free Zone”, with rock and jazz concerts. People can enjoy the daily Tango parade, the Tango Street, and tango shows in the theatre and in the Seinäjoki Arena. It pays to schedule what you want to experience.
The event takes place every year since 1985, during the month of July, usually from Wednesday to Sunday. This is the Tango event with the most tickets sold worldwide. It is incredible to see thousands of people dancing in the streets, especially at the Tango Street (Tangokatu). Most of them start dancing at around 17:00 until 03:00.
The coronation of the Tango King and Queen is one of the most important and emotional parts of the event. These figures receive much domestic media attention and often recording contracts as well and they also perform their own shows at the tango Festival the following years. They will be fully booked to dance pavilions and other stages through the rest of the summer, and for some time onwards.
Besides the opportunity for dancing and the Tango Royalty contest, another purpose of this festival is to show new ways to do tango and to erase the idea that Tango has to be in the traditional style. There are many innovations, such us combining Finnish folk and tango, or jazz and tango, electronic tango and so on.
Many artists from around the world come to perform in this festival, including Argentinean tango artists.
It is a great experience to be in the Tango Street and feel the excitement of people. They are dancing from 17:00 until 03:00. Couples have the chance to be reunited, beginners to learn and practice the basic steps and friends to have a lot of fun. It is even hard to get tired because even the sun goes down after 23:00, the day light stay all night long, so before you know it is 02:00 or 03:00 in the morning. There are rock and jazz shows in bars and nightclubs, especially popular with the youth.
You have the choice of staying at one of the hotels or, as the majority does, bring a camper and park at the camping sites near the centre and just enjoy the spectacle from morning to late night.
