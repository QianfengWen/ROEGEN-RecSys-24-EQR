Akron is a city of almost 200,000 people (2019) in the Northeast Ohio region in Summit County. Akron is proud of its heritage as a center of industry, and now offers visitors a wide range of recreational and cultural attractions, food experiences, and shopping. 


Understand[edit]
Akron's downtown skyline
Akron is called the City of Invention but used to be known as the Rubber Capital of the World, and before that, as the original home of Quaker Oats, and before that, as a pottery works. It was built right on the southern edge of the Connecticut Western Reserve. It is on the shortest possible line drawn between the Cuyahoga River (connecting to the Great Lakes - Lake Erie), and the Tuscarawas River (connecting to the Ohio River and ultimately to the Gulf of Mexico.) The Portage Path, the shortest path for carrying a canoe from one water shed to the next, has connected the two since time immemorial, and is the primary reason Akron grew just where it did.

By train[edit]
Akron lost its Amtrak station in the last round of cuts, so you'll have to go into Cleveland or Alliance.

By car[edit]
Akron has wonderful interstate highway support. I-76 is an excellent way in from the East or West, and I-77 is an easy route to take between Cleveland and Akron. Further south on I-77 is Canton, home of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Once in the city, there are two other freeways Route 8 and Route 59 (Innerbelt), both of which serve the center of the city. There is very little in the city that is more than 10 minutes from an expressway. One nice by-product of this system is that rush hour is less than an hour.

Stay safe[edit]
Given the size of the city, and diversity and activity there, it's really pretty safe. There's almost nowhere in Akron anyone shouldn't go in the daytime, and very few places at night.
Generally, the west side of the city near Copley road is regarded as the worst section of town. With a higher rate of violent crimes and theft, it is best avoided by outsiders. Some housing projects - most notably Joy Park project in the vicinity of the Zoo and Elizabeth Park under the All-American Bridge - are also somewhat unsafe and should be bypassed altogether by foot and car.
If visiting the University of Akron, it's best to stay west of the Market / Buchtel intersection. The near-East neighborhood of which this is the "border" (Middlebury) is not necessarily unsafe, but does have a lot of medium-scale drug activity and the occasional assault and non-violent robbery.
