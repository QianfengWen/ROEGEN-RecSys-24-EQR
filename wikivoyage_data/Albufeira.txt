Albufeira is a city (cidade) and municipality (concelho) in the district of Faro (Algarve). Albufeira is one of the most popular and internationally famous holiday destinations in the Algarve, the most southern and sunniest region of continental Portugal. The resorts and hotels extend from Olhos d'Agua to Galé along the beautiful rocky coastline of the area.  Many holiday makers return year after year because of the lovely beaches, very good climate, proximity of many restaurants, bars and pubs.


Understand[edit]

Once a small fishing village, Albufeira (ahl-boo-FAY-ruh, /aɫ.bu.ˈfɐj.ɾɐ/) has developed to be a very touristy area. It's not a place to experience any level of authentic Portugal, as any local culture is overwhelmed by foreign-themed businesses.
The origins of Albufeira date back to the prehistoric period. Later it was settled by the Romans, who called it "Baltum". The name of Albufeira goes back to the time of the Moors "Al-Buhera", as the town in the 8th century was an important trading centre. There are hardly any remains from this period, only a plaque to commemorate the former Moorish castle on the upper town. Mid-13th century, Albufeira was recaptured by the Order of Knights of Santiago under Afonso III of the Moors.  After that, it was for many centuries an insignificant fishing village. The huge Lisbon earthquake in 1755, devastated large parts of the country, and Albufeira was particularly affected. The subsequent tsunami flooded the lower part of the village. This destroyed any significant monuments.
In the last quarter of the 20th century, Albufeira's fortunes were revived. Its discovery as the main tourist destination of the Algarve marked a huge expansion from fishing village, to town, to city. Today, the hotels and resorts extend almost seamlessly along the beautiful Albufeira coastline. In the summer months up to 300,000 holidaymakers join the usual 22,000 residents.

Parque da Alfarrobeira
37.128608-8.2330561 Albufeira-Ferreiras railway station (Estação Ferroviária de Albufeira-Ferreiras). The train station is 6 km from the centre. There is a city bus that can take to the bus terminal and from there another bus to the centre or any nearby beach—same ticket from the train station to the centre including interchanging.Although no wifi is offered at the station, a small cafe nearby offers free wifi for its customers (and surprisingly delicious pastels de nata!)   (updated May 2020)
Trains from Lagos and Faro take about 1 hr each (for €2-3). The train from Lisbon takes 3–4 hr. There is now a rapid train that takes 2½ hr, but with more limited runs.

By bus[edit]
37.099-8.245052 Terminal Rodoviário de Albufeira. Stop for local, regional and national buses.

Get around[edit]

There are local buses that run throughout town—ask your ho(s)tel for a timetable.
Taxis are available and can usually be found in the city centre.

By car[edit]
Car rental facilities are found in the city centre and include major international chains (Hertz, Europcar) and local ones. Even for the expert driver, getting around can be quite challenging in Albufeira as there are no street signs to navigate you through the maze-like structure of the endless roundabouts, making maps similarly difficult to interpret. Coupled with the high cost of car rentals, taxis or buses may be simpler modes of transportation.

Eat[edit]
There are many restaurants to choose from, with many of them offering traditional Portuguese fare as well as a wide variety of fresh seafood. Dishes involving different preparations of codfish are plentiful, and the Cataplana styled dishes are well known in this region. Shellfish such as prawns, lobster, and crab tend to be very expensive, while fish is much more affordable. For a break from seafood, try the chicken piri-piri (roasted chicken with a sort of spicey sauce).

Sleep[edit]
Holidaymakers have the choice of more than 500 different accommodations in Albufeira and the surrounding area.
