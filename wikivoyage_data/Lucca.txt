The Duomo (San Martino)
Panorama of Lucca from the Torre Guinigi
Lucca is a city of some 90,000 people (2017) in Tuscany. Its long history goes back to Etruscan and Ancient Roman times, and the city retains pieces of ancient architecture. Lucca's heyday was in the Gothic era just before the Renaissance, and the city contains much marvellous architecture from that era. Lucca remained an independent city state until the end of the 18th century. Giacomo Puccini, one of the best-known opera composers, was born in Lucca, and his house is visited by many opera-lovers every year.


Understand[edit]
The area of most interest to visitors is still enclosed within the old city's defensive walls. The top of these broad walls is a ring park, a pleasant place for walking.

Get in[edit]
Rail and road links provide easy access from nearby Pisa and Florence.

By plane[edit]
Pisa Galileo Galilei International Airport[dead link] (PSA IATA) is 2 km south of Pisa. Flights from most large cities are available daily, and from major airports several per day. Car hire is available from all the major providers.
There's a direct "Viabus" from the airport to Lucca, one hour; buy your tickets (€4) beforehand at the kiosk within the arrivals hall. Otherwise take the "Pisamover" light railway to Pisa Centrale, and change there for trains to Lucca. 
Viabus 11 calls at Florence Airport on its way to Florence Santa Maria Novella. 

By train[edit]
The 43.837410.50621 railway station is just south of the old town walls. Deposit luggage at the Tourist Center just outside.  
Trains from Pisa Centrale run every 30 minutes.  Lucca is also on the main line from Viareggio to Florence Santa Maria Novella, so there is a direct train at least hourly from both cities.

By bus[edit]
The main local operator is Viabus, with regular runs to Pisa, Florence and Barga. The 43.84210.4972 bus station is at Piazzale Verdi, just inside the walls west side of the old town.

By car[edit]
Driving inside the walls is mostly reserved to residents, so park your car (there are car parks outside the walls and a couple inside, accessible by non-residents) and rent a bike. Several bicycle rental locations can be found near the north entrance to the city, Porta Santa Maria, near Porta San Pietro and walking from Porta Elisa towards the center.  It is not a large city within the walls, so you may find it more enjoyable to simply walk around.
The city has many car parks outside the wall; the largest two are on the North and South side. The A11 (E76) Runs from the coastal A12(E80) Autostrada across towards Firenze.

Puccini opera & recitals: The composer Puccini (1858-1924) was born and grew up in Lucca. His works are regularly performed here throughout the year. From 1891 he lived at Torre del Lago on the coast 20 km west, and built a villa there; the annual Puccini festival is held nearby. In 1921 a peat works polluted the neighbourhood so he moved to neighbouring Viareggio. 43.83231910.30672314 Puccini villa at Torre del Lago is nowadays a museum and he's buried in the chapel there.

(updated May 2019)
Festivals[edit]

 Lucca summer festival. A series of concerts by major international rock stars, held annually end of June into July.

Learn[edit]
 LIS Lucca Italian School. If you want to learn and have fun at the same time, this school is a good choice. It provides courses and private lessons for students of any age and level in Italian language and culture. 
Buy[edit]
The main shopping street is Via Fillungo which runs roughly north/south through the centre of the city. It has a mix of high to mid-range shops selling a range of Italian designer labels such as Missoni, Armani, Max Mara, etc.

 Enoteca Vanni, Piazza del Salvatore 7, ☏ +39 0583 491902, info@enotecacavanni.com. closed Sundays?. A decent wine and liquor store. One could spend some time poking around the four cellar rooms. 
Eat[edit]
Only in Lucca you can find a special sweet-bread in shape of a small baguette or a bun. It's called Buccellato and it has raisins inside and has a unique taste of anise. You can find it in a small shop called Taddeucci, behind Saint Michael's church in the main square.

Budget[edit]
 Trattoria da Leo, Via Tegrimi 1, ☏ +39 0583 492236. Fairly typical Tuscan cuisine with some Luccan touches (e.g. pine nuts). The menu is only in Italian. Vegetarian friendly. Reservations are a good idea or arrive around 19:00. 
 Pizzeria La Bersagliera, Via Pisana 2136, ☏ +39 0583510758. If you happen to have a car, do check out this pizzeria, just ten minutes drive outside of town, it's worth. The owners come from Calabria, so you are likely to find all kinds of spicy salami, olives, mushrooms on top of your pizza. A different meal, served by distracted waitresses. Beware: You can't have your espresso coffee there. Being asked for coffees, the old owner used to reply: "Yeah, go get that at La Cubana", which is a bar downtown. Oh, and you can't make reservations: Be there by 19:00. 
 Forno a vapore Amedeo Giusti, Via Santa Lucia 18/20, ☏ +39 0583 496285. Strolling along the Torre Guinigi (the one with trees on top), you'll probably sniff some irresistible oily and flory smell. It's called focaccia, the Lucchese idea of a snack. 
Mid-range[edit]
 Vecchia Trattoria Buralli. It is practically hidden on via San Giorgio and one of the best restaurants. With a constantly changing menu and an extensive wine list. 
Splurge[edit]
 Buca di San Antonio (just off the Piazza San Michele). Enjoys a high reputation for local dishes prepared in the traditional Lucchesi style. 
 Ristorante Giglio (in the Piazza Giglio). Offering wonderful Lucchesi cuisine, attentive staff and a delightful terrace overlooking the square. 
Drink[edit]
It is safe to drink the water that comes out of the public fountains.  Many locals fill gallon jugs and it is their primary source of drinking water.
It is delicious and quite refreshing.  In fact, it tastes better than most bottled water.
The digestive tonic China Massagli[dead link] is produced at the Farmacia Massagli in Lucca.  This is an eminent example of the "china" style of amaro (Italian potable bitters). If you ask for an "amaro locale" at a restaurant, this is likely what you will receive.
Biadina is another local style of bitters, bottled by Massagli and other producers; this drink is often sold with a small pack of pine nuts.
Compared to Florence or Siena, there is relatively little late night activity on the streets of old Lucca. The San Colombano, on top of the walls, overlooking the train station, the Betty Blue (near piazza Santa Maria), the Rewine near San Michele and the Cupido and McCulloughs, outside the walls near the station are some of the bars open late, especially in the summer.
Most locals tend to make the short trip to Viareggio on the coast, which offers a far better selection of clubs, such as 7 Apples and La Canniccia.

Sleep[edit]
