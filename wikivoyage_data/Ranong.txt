Ranong (ระนอง) is both a town and a province on the Northern Andaman Coast in the south Thailand.


Understand[edit]
View From Market Street, Ranong
A small border town with limited tourist magnetism and hence still quaintly Thai. Border access via boat to Kawthoung in Myanmar allows visas to be renewed.
Ranong is the northernmost province on Thailand's west coast, 568 km from Bangkok. It is also known for its long rainy season, which lasts for 8 months each year. Ranong occupies an area of 3,298 square kilometres, with the Kra Isthmus which is the narrowest part of the Malay Peninsula, and is bordered by Myanmar and the Indian Ocean to the west. Within its compact area, Ranong contains various natural attractions and is blessed with hot springs and relatively unspoiled mangrove forests.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
9.77389898.5849371 Ranong Airport (UNN  IATA), ท่าอากาศยาน ระนอง 91 ม .3 ต ราช กรูด อ เมือง, Ranong 85000, Thailand, ☏ +6677862253. Thai AirAsia and Nok Air, both from Bangkok Don Mueang (DMK IATA).   (updated Feb 2022)
Train[edit]
The nearest train station is in Chumphon.

Minibus[edit]
Minibuses to Chumphon leave from the bus station, cost 180 baht, and take around 3 hours. They drop off in most parts of Chumphon. You can minibus it all the way to Bangkok from Ranong.

By bus[edit]
The bus from Chumphon's central bus terminal stops some 6 km out of town at the booking agency for this particular bus company (Rangsit Tours). There is little in the vicinity, and you will be approached by drivers who will take you wherever for a price.
The city centre (Ruangrat Rd) can be reached by songthaews 2 or 6 (15 baht). Be prepared to walk if you arrive later than 21:30 as there are no songthaews anymore at the bus station (low-season, April 2015). You can also travel directly to the pier for boats to Ko Chang or Ko Phayam by songthaew (15 baht).
Hotels are nearby or 10 min by motorcycle taxi to the main street.
Numerous and relatively frequent full-sized buses of various classes connect with Chumphon and Bangkok and all major points in between; with Phuket and Krabi via Takua Pa and Khao Lak and other key points in Phang Nga Province (most direct route to Trang and Satun is via Krabi); and with Surat Thani which acts as the gateway to just about everywhere else.

By boat[edit]
Hundreds of longtail boats connect Ranong with Kawthoung in Myanmar, and take about 20 minutes to cross. They can be chartered individually or shared with other travellers and/or locals. Prices are negotiable, so bargain hard or you might get ripped off. Some operators might try to hustle you onto the boats before you find the immigration office, but do not let them, or you would be departing the country illegally. Make sure you find the immigration office and get stamped out before getting on the boat.
Hourly boats (a little larger, also 20 min) ferry gamblers to and from Thahtay Kyun, a small island adjacent to Kawthoung where the Andaman Club casino and golf resort has its own immigration facilities. Kawthoung is also the point of access to the islands of the Mergui Archipelago which offer excellent diving.
The islands Ko Chang and Ko Phayam can be reached by longtail boat or ferry several times per day (high season) from the ferry terminal 4 km west of the town center. Take the red number 3 songthaew which leaves the market on Ruangrat St and travels west along the main road.

Get around[edit]
Several songthaew lines offer transport in the city. They have numbers and are easy to recognize. Services stop at about 21:00, so you might have to walk later in the evening, e.g. when visiting the hot springs until late.

9.95858998.6478391 Hot Springs and Raksawarin Public Park (บ่อน้ำร้อนและสวนสาธารณะรักษะวาริน), 78 ต.บางนอน Amphoe Mueang Ranong, Chang Wat Ranong 85000, Thailand (The springs are quite close to the city and can be reached via songthaew 2 from the market.), ☏ +66 7750 1831. 08:30 - 16:30. The hot springs have been a popular tourist spot ever since King Rama V visited Ranong in 1890. There are three natural spring pools. The temperature of the water in the pools remains constant at about 65 C. There are several pools with very hot, sulphurous water, believed by many locals (and visitors) to have healing properties. The water is hot enough to boil eggs, which are sold by a vendor near the pools. There are also some pools with cooler water for bathing. These are managed by a local hotel and there is a small entrance fee (around 40 baht). The hot springs are by the river, which offers cool, shady spots under the trees to spend a few hours. Stalls and simple restaurants at river bank sell food and drinks. Nothing spectacular, but a pleasant enough way to spend some time if you are waiting for a night bus. There is also a paved area to rest on, heated by the water. Locals "chill" out here, nap or chat. Generally a lovely relaxed atmosphere. (updated Feb 2022)
 Visa run. A visa run is the likely reason to come to Ranong. You can catch a songthaew number 3 from the market on the main road, or 6 from the bus station, for 15 baht, to Saphan Pla, the fishing port providing the link to Kawthoung (aka Victoria Point) in Myanmar. Most songthaews end up here eventually, though some follow a longer route than others. The pier is behind the petrol station. Enter the port building and go to the immigration office, at the end on the right, where you must formally exit Thailand. Get your passport stamped and then head for the pier. It is likely you will be offered a boat by touts. A longtail boat should cost around 300 baht (return), whether you're on your own or in a group. The price you pay for a boat should be negotiated before you get in. There have been stories of tourists being charged up to 1,000 baht. Sólo travelers will be asked 100 baht. Locals will pay less, on the pretext that they already have a border pass. There is also a big boat which is used by more organised visa runs, and a small-scale trip via longtail usually coordinated by a white haired chap in a gold coloured pickup who hangs around the bus station. Longtails are faster and fewer people mean less waiting time at the various immigration points. The big boat is slower and takes longer because of the number of passports to be checked, but can work out cheaper. You will need USD10 (in the form of US dollar banknotes) or 500 baht to enter Myanmar. The US dollar note will be rejected unless it is in pristine condition. Local touts sell US dollar notes, but at very noncompetitive rates. On weekends the Myanmar authorities also require photocopies of your passport made in a small shop at the immigration office for 10 baht. The boat will first go to a Thai Immigration checkpoint, and the driver will take your passport or its photocopy to be inspected, then next to a Myanmar Immigration checkpoint. For some reason they don't need to see your passport there. When you arrive in Kawthoung there will be plenty of touts offering cheap whiskey/cigarettes/guided tours. You must first enter the country by going the immigration office at the short pier, on the left after entering from the road. It is here you hand over your $10 and tell them (they have English) that you're a day-tripper. In fact they'll sell you a visa which entitles you to stay for up to 2 weeks. This should be given serious consideration, Kawthoung would be well worth a few days. If you're just staying the day, Myanmar immigration will stamp you in and out in one go so you won't have to go back there again on your way out. You'll probably be offered Valium and Viagra by touts, and helped towards shops selling cheap alcohol and cigarettes. There is a limit on what can be brought back legally, and the boat may be checked on the return journey. You'll also be offered a one-hour sight-seeing trip on a moped from the touts. At the end of the trip you may be told that the price you agreed was for the moped only and that you need to pay further for the guide himself. It's well worth spending some time in the village even if you're just doing the day trip (have a Myanmar beer!). For the boat trip back, be at the pier by 16:00 absolute latest since you will need to return to the Thai immigration office to formally re-enter the country. (updated Dec 2019)
 Diving the Similan and Surin Islands. Another activity that starts from Ranong. Although most companies that offer dive tours to the Surin Islands and Similan Islands are further south on the west coast of Thailand in Khao Lak and Phuket, you can also go diving at these areas from Ranong. Also famous dive sites like Richelieu Rock, Ko Tachai and Ko Bon are included in the liveaboard tours. In Ranong are a few liveaboard dive companies, of which The Smiling Seahorse and Aladdin Dive Safari are best known for their consistent tour schedule and various dive tours.
