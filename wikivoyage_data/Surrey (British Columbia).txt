Surrey is a suburb of Vancouver. It is the largest city in land area in the Lower Mainland region and the second largest city in population (518,000 in 2016) after Vancouver. Surrey is very culturally diverse. Surrey is mostly a working-class suburb, but it also has a sizeable industrial area -- mostly factories and warehouses.


Understand[edit]
Central City Building in Surrey.
Surrey is Vancouver's largest suburb in both population and area, and is one of the fastest growing cities in British Columbia.  It is expected to be the most populated city in British Columbia by around 2030.  The city contains a sizable immigrant population from South Asia (30.9%), primarily from India's Punjab province, as well as a sizeable population from other parts of Asia (16.9%). 
The city is divided by North and South, mostly by demographics and economics.  North Surrey is for the most part middle class, while South Surrey is much more affluent.  South Surrey borders with the United States and the Pacific Ocean.  
Surrey has a number of neighbourhoods, officially known as "town centres". They include:

Surrey City Centre - A gleaming new high-rise neighborhood around the Surrey Central SkyTrain station, which is effectively Surrey's downtown area.  An area in transition, where the city has spent years gentrifying.  This area is within Whalley.
Whalley - North-west part of the city. A combination of residential, commercial, and some industrial.
Guildford - North-east part of the city.  Home to Guildford Town Shopping Centre.
Newton - Central-west part of the city.  An old village, absorbed by Surrey, and now home to corporate office parks and areas of industrial use. It's roughly in the middle of Surrey (by land area).  Most South Asian shopping complexes in Surrey are located here.
Fleetwood - Central-east part of the city, to the north of Cloverdale.  Mostly a residential area with some shopping.
Cloverdale - Central-east part of the city, to the south of Fleetwood.  Divided into areas that have residential with some shopping, and areas with farms. It includes a historic village known for its small town charm. If you love antiques, then you have come to the right place. The traditional Cloverdale Town Centre is well known for being the “Antique Capital of BC”, famous for its antiques and collectibles. It was the setting of "Smallville", a fictional location used during the filming of the popular American television series Smallville.
South Surrey - South part of Surrey extending from the western to eastern city limits. The portion west of Highway 99 is often incorrectly referred to as part of White Rock (a small city that South Surrey surrounds), this community is more affluent than most other areas of Surrey, and the only portion of the city that borders the Pacific Ocean. East of Highway 99, except for near the highway, the area is mostly rural.
Crescent Beach - An area of South Surrey adjacent to a beach with the same name.  Popular activities at Crescent Beach include swimming, kayaking, crabbing, fishing,  boating, and bird watching (e.g. bald eagles). There are shops nearby and restaurants with ocean views.  While the  beach is fairly lengthy heading north-south, only northern areas of the beach are sandy.
Get in[edit]
King George Hub DistrictSee Vancouver for options to get in the Vancouver area by plane, by bus, and by train, and by boat.
By plane[edit]
The nearest airport to Surrey is Vancouver International Airport (YVR IATA) in nearby Richmond. Surrey is a 30-minute drive from the airport via Highway 91 or Highway 99.  Taxis and airport limousines available at the airport will also take you to Surrey.  Rail rapid transit from the airport is also an option, using the Canada Line and the Expo Line, transferring between those lines at Waterfront station. 
Abbotsford International Airport (YXX IATA) is a smaller, easier to navigate option to the east of Surrey easily accessed via 16th Ave. Bellingham International Airport (BLI IATA)  is immediately south of Surrey, about 25 minutes from the US border. It offers a limited range of direct destinations but with connections can be a good way to get cheaper fares than YVR offers.
Boundary Bay Airport in Delta accepts private aviation traffic.

Drink[edit]
Surrey has neighbourhood pubs where food can be found reasonably cheap - usually $5-8 for a burger and fries and around $10 for an entree. BC has very high taxes on liquor, so although the food is reasonably priced at pubs, alcoholic beverages can be quite expensive with a jug of beer costing between $12 and $18 and highballs upwards of $5 each.
Those looking for a vibrant nightlife are advised to look to Vancouver, which has a number of popular bars and night clubs on its Granville strip.

Stay safe[edit]
Parts of Surrey suffer from an image problem with a perceived crime and drug problem. However, Surrey's crime rate is often lower than many other cities in British Columbia.  Crime within a couple of blocks of King George Boulevard in Whalley and Newton is higher than other areas of the city.  Surrey is attempting to gentrify the Surrey City Centre area of Whalley, including by focusing development of new residential and business buildings there.  The city also has been funding infrastructure in Surrey City Centre, such as relocating city hall to there and building a new main library.  In this regard, the Surrey City Centre area is in a stage of transition, as although new million-dollar developments are sprouting up, homelessness and drug dealing can be found within the same city blocks in some cases.  Compared to tougher parts of similarly sized US cities, no area in Surrey is very bad though.
