Get in[edit]
61°7′51″N 146°20′54″WMap of Valdez
To reach Valdez from Anchorage, there are some options. Quickest is to fly to 61.133889-146.2483331 Valdez Airport . Flights are offered by Ravn Alaska (formerly Era Aviation) from Anchorage. If the weather is clear on your 45-min flight, you'll get great views of the Chugach mountains. Or in a full day you could drive the Richardson Highway. Or, you could drive or go by rail to Whittier and try and get a boat across Prince William Sound. The boat trip would take at least four hours. However, most boats from Whittier only offer day trips - glacier sight seeing and fishing - there isn't a scheduled ferry between Whittier and Valdez.

Get around[edit]
No public transport. Car and bike rental are available. The new airport is a couple of miles out of town, so if arriving by air, you'll need to get a taxi into town to avoid a tedious trudge. Once in town, walking is a good way to get around, as the town itself is small.
