Muizenberg is a suburb in the southern part of Cape Town, South Africa.


Understand[edit]
It is located on the southern coast of Cape Town, which makes it perfect for a stay in Cape Town that includes trips round the Cape Peninsula and the Cape Winelands.

0°0′0″N 0°0′0″EMap of Muizenberg
By car[edit]
From Cape Town go south towards Simon's Town and the Cape of Good Hope on any of De Waal Drive/Blue Route freeway (the M3), Main Road (the M4) or the M5 freeway. The town is north of Simon's Town, at the point where the Cape Peninsula starts.
From Strand, Somerset West, Stellenbosch and the Cape Winelands drive west on Baden Powell Drive (the R310) next to the False Bay coastline. Muizenberg begins at the traffic circle where the R310 meets the M5.

By train[edit]
MetroRail[dead link] operates frequent commuter trains from Cape Town to Muizenberg. During peak hours (early morning and late afternoon, Monday to Friday) there are trains every few minutes. At other times during the week there are 3 or 4 trains per hour ; they are less frequent on Saturdays and Sundays. The journey takes about 45 minutes. There are also MetroRail trains to Muizenberg from the other direction (Simon's Town, Fish Hoek and Kalk Bay), usually 2 or 3 per hour. This journey takes about 20 minutes.
If heading to northern parts of the town, it might be better to alight at the anterior False Bay railway station.
