Old khachkars in Vanadzor
Vanadzor[dead link] (Armenian: Վանաձոր) is the capital of Lori Marz, in the North Central part of Armenia.


Understand[edit]
Vanadzor is Armenia's third largest city, with a population of about 105,000 people. There are a few old churches, however big part of the city has been built during the time of the Soviet Union with a grand central square, a humongous old Soviet chemical factory which has been idle for decades, and a river running through the somewhat narrow valley, surrounded by hills.
Most of the attractions in Lori are along the Debed River canyon to the north, or around Stepanavan, and although Vanadzor can be used as a base to explore these due to its perfect transport connection, finding a place closer to them might be preferable.

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
The city lies on the railway connecting Tbilisi and Yerevan.

On foot[edit]
The center of the city where lies almost all main attractions is quite miniature and walkable. You'll need to get a transportation if heading to some outer monasteries or perhaps to Botanical Garden (which is about 1.5 km from the center).

By marshrutka[edit]
Always available.

By taxi[edit]
Available and practical for visiting sites in the nearby area. Majority of the taxis are equipped with meter, but you might want to agree on the price beforehand to avoid being scammed, but it's close to impossible here.

Laundry[edit]
There is only one laundry in Vanadzor.

In around 8-10 minutes of walking on the right side of the road, you will see a sign with painted Dolphins. That's the entrance to Bakmar Laundry. Or just simply ask locals, everybody in town know where Bakmar Laundry is located). 09:00-18:00. 600 dram/kg.
