Marsciano is a city of  in Umbria between Perugia and
Todi. As a brickmaking town it has an interesting little museum on the topic. The area covered by the municipality (north of the town) is a very hilly and green area, with many medieval borghi and at least a couple of notable winemakers. Marsciano is a good starting point also for exploring the Monte Peglia, a massif in the adjacent Provincia di Terni, with plenty of holiday houses and B&Bs.

Understand[edit]
Marsciano is mainly an industrial town of 18,000 people (2018) with not too much to detain visitors.

Get in[edit]
The local railway is suspended (as of May 2020). Local replacement buses operated by Busitalia from Perugia Ponte San Giovanni station (not Perugia's main station but on its same line) take about 35 minutes. Buses are not especially frequent so check the timetables. The tickets can be bought on board or from the newsagent in front of the bus stop and cost from €2.50.
The same line runs to Terni, which is connected to major train lines. You can get buses from Terni to Marsciano from €4.60. At Terni station, buy the ticket to Marsciano from the shop in the bar rather than at the ticket window. The buses that run on the Terni-Perugia PSG line are not listed on the main timetables displayed in Terni station. However, there is a separate timetable showing these buses and they appear on the departures board.

Get around[edit]
It is easy to walk around Marsciano. The railway station is on the edge of town, about 15 minutes' walk from the centre or few minutes by bus, which stops in front of the station. The railway service has been suspended for maintenance and replaced by coaches.  Less easy is to get around the hilly, the most scenic part of the commune. The coaches are mainly focused on the school terms, however all the public transport services can be found on Busitalia web site. Now it is also possible to buy an all-inclusive ticket [formerly dead link]  for all or most of the public transport in Umbria. Another option is to buy the Umbria Green Card and rent a car, particularly an electric vehicle. The card gives access also to a range of offers and discounts.
