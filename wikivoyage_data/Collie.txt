Get around[edit]
See[edit]
 Black Diamond Pool, Ferguson Rd (6km west of Collie on Coalfields Rd). An abandoned coal mine has formed into a deep lake that takes on a vivid blue or green hue depending on the weather. The clear water and sandy bottom surrounded by cliffs make it a good place to swim. 
 Harris Dam, Harris River Rd. A large dam that supplies Collie and surrounding towns with drinking water. A nice grassed area at the bottom of the dam wall has tables and gas barbeques. A walk trail leading to top of the dam gives a good view, but look is all you can do as any kind of activity in the water is prohibited. 
 Glen Mervyn Dam, Collie-Preston Rd (17km south of Collie on Collie-Preston Rd). A large crescent shaped dam that is a popular spot for water skiing, boating and camping. The dam wall is a good spot to observe. A walk in the surrounding bushland offers some respite from the constant sound of revving speed boat engines. 
 Miners Institute, Cnr Throssell and Patterson St. This striking piece of architecture was built in 1953 in the Art Deco style with a distinctly soviet influence. 
 Minninup Pool, Mungalup Rd (3km south of Collie). A wide section of the Collie river that is popular spot for swimming and canoeing. 
 Stockton Lake, Crossman Rd. A large lake formed in an old coal mine excavation. White chalky cliffs on the north side and reedy shore line on the south. Many water birds wade in the shallows. A popular place to swim, water ski and camp. The mine opened in 1926 and closed in 1960. An arched entrance to the mine can be found hidden in the bush on the east side of the lake. The easiest way to find it is to follow the gravel road around to the T junction where it joins a paved road, turn right and you will see it in a clearing about 50m from the junction. 
 Swinging Bridge, River Ave. A suspension bridge over the Collie River swings and sways a bit when you walk over it. A treat for the kids if they have never been on one before.
