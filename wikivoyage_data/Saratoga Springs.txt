Saratoga Springs is located just south of the Adirondacks in upstate New York. Long a vacation destination for New Yorkers, Saratoga Springs is a pleasant town filled with swanky shops, spas and horse racing. A key battle in the Revolutionary War happened nearby. The city is home to Skidmore College and Empire State College (SUNY).


Understand[edit]
Saratoga is most known for its great horse racing track (oldest in the country) and harness racing track.  Victorian visitors came to take the waters at springs. The spring waters are located at different pavilions around the city and surrounds. They vary tremendously in flavor from a light mineral water to frosty and hard. This city of 28,000 people (2020) is a major tourist destination during its summer horse racing season. Yaddo, the famous writers retreat is located near the "flat track" on Union avenue. If you call ahead, you may be able to tour.

While the mineral baths are their signature service, they also offer the standard menu of modern spa services: massages, facials, etc. The decor, with its aged porcelain fixtures and linoleum floors, may look a little institutional, but keep in mind any oxidation you see is natural, a result of iron in the spring water.
