Ruins of the Minoan settlement

Not to be confused with the Akrotiri region of Cyprus.

Akrotiri (Greek: Ακρωτήρι) is a town on Thira, the largest island of the Santorini archipelago. It is on the southwestern side of Santorini and though it offers great view of the caldera and volcano, it is not as overrun by tourists like Fira and Oia. It has become famous by the discovery of an ancient Minoan settlement just outside the modern town.


Understand[edit]
Akrotiri is about 15 km south of Fira, on the south-western tip of Thira, the largest island of the Santorini archipelago. Built on the slopes of a hill, it is a popular travel destination because it offers spectacular views of the caldera. The top of the hill also features ruins of a 13th century Venetian castle, constructed as a defensive fortification to protect Thira from raiders. Most of the modern town is built around the castle ruins.
What Akrotiri is perhaps the most famous for is the Minoan Bronze Age settlement that was discovered 2 km to the south-east of the current town. When the Santorini volcano obliterated the former island and created the present day archipelago in ca. 1600 BCE, the Minoan settlement was buried in volcanic pumice and ashes. As a result, it was exceptionally well preserved, unlike other Minoan settlements in the Cyclades, and the Akrotiri archaeological site is considered the most valuable Minoan era scientific evidence because it was covered at the height of the Minoan civilisation. The comparison with Pompeii is often made, and rightfully so. Many artefacts were unearthed in the ruins of the Minoan town but no bodies were discovered, which suggests the Minoans had evacuated prior to the eruption.

Excavations at Akrotiri
36.3513625.403561 Ancient Akrotiri (Ακρωτήρι), ☏ +302286081939, efakyk@culture.gr. daily 08:30-15:30; closed on Tuesdays. It was back in the end 19th century, that the volcanic Theran earth was excavated to provide first material for the construction of the Suez Canal. There have been traces of a prehistoric settlement, but it wasn’t until 1967 when the excavations at the so-called ancient Akrotiri started. The most important excavations, which brought to light multi-level buildings and masterpiece-wall paintings, were conducted by the archaeologist Spryridon Marinatos, a professor at the University of Athens. This is one of the best preserved sites all over Greece, and we owe that to the same factor that caused its destruction. After the eruption of the volcano in the 17 century BC, the whole island, and Akrotiri as well, has been covered with volcanic material. This material has, however, played a major role in the protection of the ancient settlement and especially its wall paintings. The Bronze Age remains are the most popular archaeological site on the Santorini archipelago. The entire site is covered with a giant canopy, which collapsed in 2005 and killed a tourist. The damage has since been repaired, and the site is open to visitors again since 2012. €12 regular, €6 reduced price.   (updated Apr 2022)

Do[edit]
From Akrotiri, you can walk to the Red Beach or get a boat to it, which also makes stops at the White Beach and the Black Beach. It is €5 return but you don't receive any ticket or receipt (nor do they have the means to give you one). However, there is only one boat so they trust if you come back by it, you must have come so you aren't asked to pay again, only when you leave Akrotiri. The only stop with a pier is Akrotiri so if you intend to get off, tell them explicitly or they won't know to stop (though they often ask) and be prepared to get off directly into the sea and walk through the water to get to the beach. They always stop in waters shallow enough to walk in for adults (highest it comes to is the waist) so it is possible to bring bags, but make sure you can lift them above your head.
