Thousands of Flying Fox Bats emerge from Kalong Island at dusk
Once a small fishing village, Labuan Bajo (also spelled Labuhanbajo and Labuanbajo) in Flores is now bustling with tourists.


Understand[edit]
Labuan Bajo is the launching point for trips to Komodo Island and Rinca Island, home to the famous Komodo dragons. While Labuan Bajo draws plenty of tourists, it is nevertheless quite a small town that runs along one main road, making it easy to navigate.
During 2020 and 2021, the Indonesian government put a lot of resources into Labuan Bajo to make the city attractive to tourists. New pathways were built for walking and bicycle lanes. Soon the Komodo airport will also receive international flights.
Nearby Seraya Island provides a great opportunity to do some diving and snorkeling, and every evening at Kalong Island thousands of flying fox bats put on an amazing display.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
-8.486667119.8891671 Komodo Airport (LBJ  IATA) (2 km out of town). Labuan Bajo Airport was substantially upgraded in 2015 and is a small but modern airport   (updated Nov 2022)
Labuan Bajo is linked by air with Denpasar (Bali), Jakarta, Kupang, Surabaya, Bajawa, Ende, Makassar, Mataram and Maumere.
The upturn in tourism has meant that ojeks can only be taken if you walk outside the airport and taxi drivers charge set rates of Rp60,000 and up one way for this short journey. If all else fails, it's a 25-minute downhill walk into town.

By boat[edit]
-8.493783119.8756432 Labuan Bajo Port (Pelabuhan Labuan Bajo). The port in Labuan Bajo is in the town, and everywhere is reached within a 5-10 minutes walk. (updated Nov 2018)

The port building and main jettyThe ferry from Sape (Rp91,000 as of July 2023) runs daily, and usually arrives around 17:00. You will need ADSP card (around 30 000, multiuse) to be able to pay or just borrow it from locals for some amount of money
A number of companies organise 4 days/3 nights boat trips from Lombok or Bali to Flores for around Rp1,550,000. You sleep on the deck on thin mattresses (less than 1 inch thick, but you get used to it). No matter where you book the trip from, you will be shuttled to the eastern coast of Lombok with bus/ferry transfers before getting on the boat.
The Perama tour is a well advertised trip running 4 days/3 nights from Lombok to Labuan Bajo, and 3 days/2 nights the other way. This sets itself apart from the others by having private (2 person) cabins. Prices are cabin/deck Rp2,600,000/2,000,000 Lombok-Labuanbajo and Rp1,800,000/1,300,000 the other way. Be aware of the safety records of these boats.
Pelni ships arrive from Makassar or Lombok. Pelni has two ships calling at Labuanbajo every 2 weeks. Tilongkbila departs for Bima, Lembar (Lombok, 24 hr) and Benoa (Bali) every other Thursday and returns the following Sunday  to go to Makassar and other destinations in Sulawesi. Willis departs for Bima - Benoa - Surabaya every other Saturday and returns Saturday one week later to go east to Marapokot and Maumere.
All the tour boats have the same program of snorkelling, trekking and komodo dragon watching, stopping at the same stunning reefs, beaches and waterfalls along the way. For years there have been rumors of safety issues on these boats. However, so far all these rumors have been just that. There are, however, many who remark on the noise (on all boats), so bring earplugs and don't expect any deep, meaningful conversations while the engine is running.

By bus[edit]
Buses from Ruteng and Bajawa stop and depart in the centre of town near the school.
Buses from Lombok; see Flores (Indonesia)#Get in.

Get around[edit]
8°29′49″S 119°52′48″EMap of Labuan Bajo
The town is quite small and can easily be traversed on foot (in 10-15 minutes). Ojeks (Rp3,000-5,000) and bemos pass every 5 minutes if you get tired of walking. You will find at least to local rental business on the main street where you can rent a scooter for Rp65,000 - 75,000/per day (as of December 2016), you can also ask your hotel as some of them also rent scooters.

See[edit]
Caves, such as Batu Cermin Cave and Rangko Cave
Surrounding beaches
Komodo Dragons
Kanawa Island, small island 10 km away from Labuan Bajo (about 1hr with a local boat or 10 min with speed boat) and located just at the borders of Komodo National Park. You will find a resort there.
Do[edit]
Komodo National Park encompasses a lot of water and islands west of Labuanbajo. If you want to go to Rinca or Komodo islands, or dive in the park you will have to buy a 1-day park pass for US$15 during the weekdays or $18 at weekends. Money from such user fees is collected by the local government and is supposed to go into conservation efforts.
Rinca Island  (Indonesian: Rinca Kecil or Pulau Rinca) is a more convenient place to see Komodo Dragons than Komodo island. Some dive operators might be convinced to combine a stop at the island with a days diving - otherwise charters can be arranged, or walk along the main street of Labuan Bajo and some tour agencies may be advertising places on an existing charter. There are big dragons that are often right in front of the pier when people arrive. On arrival a guide will escort you to the park office where you will be relieved of a range of fees, then you can choose a 1- or 2-hour hike. Presumably if you had a pass from Komodo, you would be exempt from at least some of those fees.
Tours:
A one-day tour covering Padar island viewpoint, Pink beach, Komodo island, and Manta point on a shared boat costs around Rp375,000 with an additional Rp350,000 in entrance fees. The 2-day/1-night option in addition to the above includes Rinca island and Kanawa island and on a shared boat costs around Rp700,000 with an additional approximately Rp500,000 in entrance fees (Nov 2019).
The tour boats will collect the entrance fee money upfront to supposedly save you the hassle, but end up pocketing most of the money without it going to the parks as intended. Either insist that that give you the tickets, or just pay the entrance fees at each stop yourself.

Diving[edit]
A manta ray in the Komodo National Park
The Komodo National Park offer dozens of pristine dive sites, with many migratory pelagics, vibrant reefs- making it one of the world's richest marine habitats. The Park is just offshore and easily reached by liveaboard operators, although daytrips may take two hours or more in each direction. Check that your dive operator is reputable, has safety equipment onboard and if possible is a member of the local dive association who have strict minimum safety requirements for their members.
There are many dive operators that offer dive courses, fun dives and 3-to-7 day live aboards. They have fixed pricing for fun dives at Rp1,200,000 per day including 2 dives, full equipment and lunch (Rp1,500,000 for three dives). Choose one of the Dive Association dive centers for the newest equipment, experienced guides and safety equipment on board. It is true the currents around Komodo can be quite strong and some sites are unsuitable for beginners, however if you dive with a reputable company, in a small group, with an experienced guide there is no reason even Open Water divers shouldn't be able to enjoy the diving!
Beware; dive operators now (July 2022) charge a very steep Rp2,500,000 for 3 dives. A small discount is possible, but still very overpriced. All dive centers have the same price list of the Labuan Bajo diving cartel. Think twice before coming here for your diving, as some argue that there is little unique about this area. However this region is exceptionally rich in marine life due to the strong currents formed by water moving between the islands. In addition, there is a great diversity of dive sites within a small area.

Snorkelling[edit]
Labuan Bajo is the most convenient point from which to go snorkelling in the Komodo National Park. The snorkeling within the park offers many opportunities to see pristine reefs with some of the greatest fish and coral diversity in the world. Any dive shop can organise a snorkelling-only trip, or a snorkeller can accompany a diving tour at a reduced rate. Just ask!

Other[edit]
Seraya Island  (Indonesian: Pulau Seraya) is little more than a small, arid island outside of the Komodo National Park with a few bamboo huts for tourist lodging, a restaurant, and some villagers who let their goats graze on vegetation. The island's cove is protected from the sea, providing calm and clear water for snorkelling. At low tide the coral is exposed and local fishermen walk on the reef in search of prey. Rowboats can be rented and taken to nearby islands for snorkelling and diving. Make sure to run up to the top of the hill behind the resorts and check out the sunset. The lodges on the island do have showers, but running water is only available a few hours a day.
One of the more spectacular displays of nature in the area is at Kalong Island (Indonesian: Pulau Kalong; also spelt Kalung), which literally means "Flying Fox Island." The name is quite appropriate as the island is home to thousands of Kalong, or giant flying fox bats. Boats to Kalong can be chartered from Labuanbajo for around Rp300,000 for a return ride, including a snorkelling stop at a nearby island before you reach Pulau Kalong. Your boat will be moored next to the mangrove island and at dusk literally tens of thousands of flying foxes emerge from the mangrove island and move over your boat towards Rinca Island. For the entire colony to emerge will take roughly 20 min of continuous waves of bats passing over your boat. The boat ride to/from Labuanbajo will take roughly one hour. This trip can also be packaged into a one-day tour together with (for example) a visit of Rinca Island and some snorkelling in the area.

Buy[edit]
Harbour views from one of the many top-floor restaurants along Jl Soekarno Hatta
There are three ATMs in town which belong to the BNI bank and can deliver up to Rp2,500,000 per transaction in Rp100,000 or Rp50,000 notes, but also a few other banks and one money changer. There is a bad rate, so better change enough money before coming here.
Shops selling tourist trinkets, local fabric, and Komodo Dragon carvings are located in the center of town. Western products of varying quality are available in the toko or kiosk alongside the roads.
Consider taking a trip to the market early in the morning to purchase local coffee, spices, or just to look over a wealth of local produce and goods.

Eat[edit]
Choose from a variety of Indonesian, Chinese, and Western restaurants on the main road. As a tourist place some cheating takes place: some restaurants add 10% "service tax" to the bill. Other restaurants refuse to give change less of than 1000 rupiah. Insist on exact change.

Drink[edit]
Beer (Rp30,000 as of Nov 2018) and Arak is available from the supermarkets and some of the shops around town. You can get the local moonshine (Arak), however, it resembles paint thinner, and it's not unlikely that you will go blind if it is contaminated with methyl alcohol.

 Paradise Bar (10 min walk north from the centre of town). The only bar that is open until late and has a fantastic view of the sunset. Every Saturday (at least) there is live music till late night, though don't get high expectations about their taste in cover songs. Paradise also serves pretty decent food. 
 The Lounge. The default place for a sundowner. Anker beer is the best-seller, (Rp27,000-25,000 + tax). They also serve cocktails and food until 23:00. Shisha is available, try the apple/mint flavor for that freshmaker feeling. 
 Mediterraneo. Good sunset view, also for the food. 
Cafe In Hit. Nice cafe with excellent reading selections.
Sleep[edit]
There is plenty of accommodation to choose from in Labuanbajo. And with tourism growing exponentially, new places are springing up constantly.
The cheapest places are the local homestays (Penginapan) near the ferry port. However, practice your Indonesian first.
As of December 2016 there are 17 hotels, just one 4-star and 6 3-star hotels. The infrastructure of the town is growing rapidly. Listed from north to south, here are some of the hotels. All places include breakfast, but to some breakfast merely translates into a cup of coffee. Ask first to avoid disappointment.
The main issue in Labuan Bajo is the lack of fresh water. Some hotels tap spring water at the hill through a very long pipeline. Other hotels collect fresh water from this source using a mobile tank. It seems like the hotels in the central town take advantage of this setup.

Budget[edit]
 Bajo Beach Hotel. The beach part, is purely marketing. However, it's clean and well-run, with the rooms of similar size and price to Gardena, it is worth checking out before putting down your bags at either. They are among the few that have (broken) western toilets. For an extra Rp100,000 you can get a room with A/C. Rp120,000. 
 Bajo View. This place up on the hill from the main road is unique in that it has tents set up permanently in a courtyard. The tents have a built-in fan to keep the heat down. Nice bar overlooking Labuan Bajo. Rp170,000 for a tent that fits two people. Shared toilets. (updated Jun 2015)
 Cool Corner Backpacker Hostel (on the main road just past MadeInItaly restaurant). The only dorm-style hostel in town. Two rooms with 8 or so beds each. Cramped and very basic; no common room or any other typical hostel facilities, though it does offer AC, custom built bunkbeds and clean bedding. The toilet/shower is its main weakness (as there is only one for the entire hostel). Rp70,000. (updated Jun 2018)
 Gardena Hotel. Once the default budget place, the hotel now offers new bungalows on the top of the hill with great view. The old rooms, while falling apart are big with old beds, mosquito nets and private bathrooms in a shared wooden bungalow setting. Rp180,000-350,000. (updated Nov 2018)
 Hotel Matahari. The restaurant has great views of the bay, and the rooms are located below it in two floors. The upper rooms still views and some sunshine, but the downstairs do not. Mosquito nets are provided and needed. Fairly dingy and dirty in parts but good airflow and nice lower deck for sunset watching. Rp100,000-150,000 with own toilet and shower, including breakfast). 
 Komodo Indah (5-10 minutes south of main harbor, left side of the road.). Tired, somewhat musty rooms with big bathrooms (Rp150,000) or similar rooms with shared bathroom (Rp125,000). The sole shared bathroom is shared by many, though, has no shower, and occasionally doesn't even have water. The beds are comfortable. There are no mosquito nets but there are not too many mosquitoes. Add Rp100,000/night for A/C. Decent Wifi. Rp100,000-150,000. 
 Manta-Manta Homestay (Path up the hill from the main road; near Bajo View). A handful of rooms on the hill. Pleasant and some distance away from the traffic on the main road. Can be a bit difficult to find - look for the sign advertising nearby Bajo View. Clean and bright rooms. Rp200,000. (updated Jun 2015)
 Surya Hotel. Excellent good value choice. Spotlessly clean tiled rooms, brand new with bathrooms and fan or A/C set around a charming flowered little courtyard with ever present helpful staff. 10 min walk out of town, which is why it is such good value. Rp150,000-250,000. 
Seraya Island Sunset Beach. Seraya Kecil Island (Rp250,000); a stay on the island can be booked at the front desk of Gardena Hotel (same owner).
-8.59028119.946911 Sten Lodge eco Homestay, Pesari valley, Melo, Liang Ndara (T), ☏ +6282340045561, info@stenlodge.com. Check-in: 14:00, check-out: 11:00. Eco-friendly accommodation in traditional bamboo huts with balcony. All huts are equipped with mosquito nets and a solar panel charging a portable solar lamp. Mobile phones can be charged in your room from the solar lamp. Fresh filtered water from Mount Mebelling is available for free during your stay. Rp250,000/person including breakfast and dinner. (updated Feb 2021)
Mid-range[edit]
 Chez Felix (Down the main road, turn left at the Warnet and up the hill). The Felix Hotel (Rp250,000) is new and hits a sweet spot between quality and price. Mainly because it's new and clean. 
-8.482705119.8801892 Golo Hilltop Hotel. To get away from the noise the Golo Hill Top Hotel is excellent with great views and a delightful new pool. Standard rooms are fan-only, and the wall fan is in an odd position which limits its effectiveness. Food comparable to the Gardena but great service. It is a 5-10 min walk to town down the hill - the road is terrible but the walk is not too bad, even on the way back up (best to carry a torch at night). Rp250-450,000.  
 Green Hill Hotel. Boutique hotel (whatever that means) with A/C and big bathrooms. Rp450,000. (updated Feb 2017)
 Sylvia Resort Komodo, Waecicu Beach (5 km north of Labuan Bajo). 50 rooms, lobby lounge, pool tables, Wi-Fi access, restaurant. Two swimming pools, one for the kiddies and another for adults. The rooms all have A/C and solar hot water, King size beds, and TV. Rp550,000/night. (updated Jul 2015)

Check for the rooms and facilities in their website. Breakfast is awesome. They provide a professional diving club, Orca Dive. It's worth to try! US$60-200.  (updated Dec 2018)
Connect[edit]
Internet cafes along the main road are plentiful, and their connections are all generally the same at 1 Mbit/s which is fine for Skype and YouTube. The Warnet in the south has the newest hardware, and most places have headsets for Skype.
All restaurants mentioned above have free WiFi. Most accommodations have WiFi.

Stay safe[edit]
If you decide to go hiking, beware of venomous snakes.

Go next[edit]
"Travel" (shared car) or bus (e.g. Gunung Mas, Gemini) to Ruteng, Bajawa, Ende, Moni, Maumere, etc.) can be arranged through many of the tour offices on the main street - the price usually includes pick-up from your hotel.

Komodo National Park encompasses a lot of water and islands west of Labuanbajo. If you want to go to Rinca or Komodo islands, or dive in the park you must buy a 3-day park pass for US$15. Money from such user fees is collected by the local government and is supposed to go into conservation efforts. Rinca Island  (Indonesian: Rinca Kecil or Pulau Rinca) is a more convenient place to see Komodo Dragons than Komodo island.  Some dive operators might be convinced to combine a stop at the island with a days diving.  There are big dragons that are often right in front of the pier when people arrive.
Kanawa Island (Pulau Kanawa) is surrounded by spectacular reefs with thousands of fish species, turtles, corals and reef sharks. Sometimes it is possible to see some stingrays and small sharks just around the arrival jetty. You can dive from the island with companies such as Wunderpus Diving (www.wunderpusliveaboard.com) who will collect you each morning and drop you off in the afternoon after diving, they will also offer course based from the island at times. Kanawa island is 10 km away from Labuan Bajo (about 1hr with a local boat or 10 min with speed boat) and located just at the borders of Komodo National Park. on Kanawa there is a small bungalow resort, designed for travelers, with a restaurant. It is possible to visit the national park directly from there with wooden boats. Reef around Kanawa is protected, so fishing is not allowed, but the restaurant provides fabulous fresh seafood coming form the nearby fisherman island. Turtles love to hatch on the beach just next to the restaurant.
Ruteng, the main area for Manggarai culture, the next big city by the main Flores road, 110 km away - approximately 3-4 hours by motorbike or car.
