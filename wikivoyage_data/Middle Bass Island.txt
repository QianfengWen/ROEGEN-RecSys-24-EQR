By boat[edit]
Ferries from the mainland originate from Catawba Island and arrive at -82.80952541.670971 Middle Bass Dock. During the summer, ferries operate several times per day. There are also some scheduled trips during the spring and fall, as weather allows. 
Middle Bass may be reached by pleasure boats, but it lacks the fine natural harbor found at South Bass.  A new marina with more than 300 slips is planned to open soon, and 50 slips are available at the State Park.
A small ferry, the  Sonny-S, takes passengers to/from nearby Put-in-Bay, a town on a nearby island with a grocery store and a few other services.
