Understand[edit]
Engelberg (mountain of angel) is an exclave of the canton of Obwalden and is surrounded by the cantons of Bern, Nidwalden and Uri. It was home to about 4,200 people in 2018
The official language of Engelberg is the Swiss variant of standard German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect.

History[edit]
Engelberg is first mentioned as Engilperc in 1122, when the Abbey was founded there. From 1850, Engelberg became an international vacation resort (mineral water, milk serum and fresh air cures). Many hotels were built,and roads were improved. The Stansstad-Engelberg electric railway was opened in 1898.
Hiking and other mountain sports developed at the end of the 19th century and Engelberg first held a winter season in 1903–1904. A funicular railway (opened in 1913) connects Engelberg to Gerschni and, from there, the second cable car in Switzerland (opened in 1927) runs onwards to Ober Trüebsee. 
The decade preceding the First World War was a period of boom conditions. The widening of the road and the extension of the railway to Lucerne (in 1964) considerably opened up the tourism catchment area of the station and, in 1967, the higher section of the Titlis cable car was opened. Conferences in Engelberg niw supplement winter tourism.
