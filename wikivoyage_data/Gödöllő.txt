Gödöllő [dead link] is a city of 32,000 people (2017) in Pest County, about 30 km east of Budapest.

By rail[edit]
Budapest has two suburban rail systems: the HÉV operated by BKV (the transport company in Budapest), and regular személy trains operated by MÁV (the national rail operator). Both serve Gödöllő, but not the same parts. However, if coming from central Budapest MÁV is almost always the better option, although HÉV is more practical if you are arriving directly from the Franz Liszt Airport (first take #200E from the airport to Kőbánya-Kispest, and from there on take #85 to Örs vezér tere, its final stop; both of these are bus lines with quite frequent departures, even on Sundays).

HÉV[edit]
The Gödöllő HÉV originates at Örs Vezér tere in Budapest, the eastern terminus of the metro line 2. Be sure to take a train towards Gödöllő and not Csömör or Cinkota. Gödöllő has four HÉV stops. Service pattern is 4 trains/hour during peak hours and 2 trains/hour at other times, and the trip from Örs Vezér tere takes 51 min.
Tickets can be bought at Örs Vezér tere or from the inspector on board, and the fare is Ft720, consisting of two tickets: a regular one for Ft350 that you should stamp inside the train, and an extension ticket for Ft370 that an inspector will come over to check (though if you have a Budapest period travelcard, this is reduced to Ft365).
