The free trolley on King St, Old Town
Alexandria is a city in Virginia, just outside of Washington, D.C., in the United States of America.


Understand[edit]
First surveyed in 1749, Alexandria claims some of the richest history in the D.C. metropolitan area. At various points in her past, Alexandria has been part of the District of Columbia, a regional slave trading market, an occupied city, a washed-up post-industrial hamlet, and a hometown to famous American heroes and rebels. Today, the town serves as an interesting day-trip alternative for weary tourists looking to escape the capital, a treasure trove of early American architecture, a romantic getaway for metro-area residents, and a bedroom community for the white-collar workers that fuel the Federal labor mills to the north. Old Town's cobblestone streets have nearly 4,000 buildings dating as far back as the 1600s, and is filled with shops and good restaurants.
Neighborhoods of interest include:

Old Town was laid out in 1749, making it the oldest section of the city, and is a historic district. Old Town is chiefly known for its historic town houses, art galleries, antique shops, restaurants, and its unique cobblestone streets and red brick sidewalks.
Del Ray is to the northwest of Old Town, much of which was once in the separate town of Potomac. It has a vibrant commercial corridor.
Get in[edit]

For more information on riding the metro, see Washington DC#Get_around.

By car[edit]
Major roads of note:

Interstate 95/Interstate 495 (the "Capital Beltway"), a major freeway that serves the southern part of Alexandria and circles the Greater Washington D.C. area. The Capital Beltway section just east of Alexandria, known as the Woodrow Wilson Bridge, is the last major crossing point of the Potomac River in the southern part of the metro area. For those traveling from the Virginia side to Old Town Alexandria, failure to make the last exit before entering the bridge will result in a long, difficult journey across the bridge and appropriate turn-abouts are spread thin on the Maryland side. If traffic is backed up at the Wilson Bridge or the Beltway/Hwy 1 interchange and you still want to get to Old Town, simply exit north at Telegraph Road and proceed up to the Duke Street exit going east. Take Duke Street a mile or so until you get to around Patrick/Henry and then meander your way north a couple of blocks to King Street. No reasonable alternatives exist for those traveling west out of Maryland.
Interstate 395 runs north-south along the western section of Alexandria.
U.S. Highway 1: depending on where you are, this is either the Richmond Highway or Patrick/Henry - a major north-south artery into Washington D.C.
George Washington Memorial Parkway, known as Washington Street in Alexandria, it runs north-south along the Virginia side of the Potomac River and is an easy and pleasant drive to Mount Vernon.
King Street (State Route 7) - runs east-west from Old Town Alexandria out towards Falls Church, Virginia.
Duke Street (State Route 236) - runs east-west into Old Town Alexandria.
Get around[edit]
Map of Old Town, Alexandria
The historic center of Alexandria is known as "Old Town", which is where the most notable restaurant, shopping, architectural, and tourist destinations are located.

By foot[edit]
Stroll down King Street and visit the side streets of Old Town. The main Old Town section begins about a half-mile east of the King Street-Old Towne Metrorail Station[dead link] and provides a combination of restaurants, art and antique shops, souvenir traps, and public buildings. With its French-style open-air cafes, gas lamp-styled lights, red brick sidewalks, and historical, old-style architecture, King Street provides one of the most romantic settings in the DC metro area. More than just a tourist destination or open-air museum, Old Town is a vibrant community of residents who take great pride in their city. The streets north and south of King Street near the river boast nearly 4000 18th- and 19th-century buildings still used as private residences. Unlike many of the planned communities promoted by new urbanism, the streets of Old Town simply ooze a sense of character and authenticity that is not normally seen outside the best cities in Europe.

By trolley[edit]
King Street Trolley[dead link] operates a free transportation service from the King Street metro station to the waterfront. These black and red rubber tire trolleys are free and will stop at any one of the signs for the trolley stops along King street.

By bus[edit]
DASH also operates many buses that will take you from the King Street Metro station to the historic center.

By car[edit]
Getting around Alexandria beyond Old Town and the Duke Street business district is a little more difficult, and will require bus transit or a car.
Two-hour parking is often available a few blocks away from King Street (though it can be harder to find on weekend evenings), but read the parking signs carefully. Some parking is free, some is metered, and some is for locals only. Tires are frequently marked (chalked) by parking enforcement staff; if you exceed 2 hours you will get a ticket. If you plan on leaving your car for more than a couple hours it would be wise to pay to park in one of the many parking garages in the city.

By water taxi[edit]
A water taxi runs from the waterfront at the end of King Street to both Georgetown in Washington D.C. and to National Harbor in Maryland.

By bicycle[edit]
For information on bike-sharing programs in the Washington DC area, see Washington DC#Get_around.
Big Wheel Bikes, located near the waterfront just south of King Street, offers bike rental services.

Bicycle trails[edit]
The Mount Vernon Trail runs through Alexandria (although the Old Town section is streets), goes all of the way to Mount Vernon, and connects with the greater D.C. area.

Historic Buildings Survey
 Many of the houses throughout Old Town display oval shaped plaques granted by the Historic Alexandria Foundation. Starting in 1977, the determining basis became a street by street listing in Historic Alexandria written by Ethelyn Cox. The plaques indicate that the building is at least one hundred years old, as documented by a combination of records (title search, tax records, wills, etc.), and the principal facades of the building visible from the street or any public right of way maintain integrity of form, materials, and architectural features consistent with the dominant period of the building.

It was built in an alley to prevent people using the alley without permission. Because of its diminutive size, this house has been featured on HGTV, and other similar shows and publications.

Standard recommendations are "Kal bi" - thick slices of meat in a tangy-sweet sauce (not like American BBQ, but a similar idea), or "Bul go ki" - thinner slices almost like the way a Philly cheese steak is prepared - but with a sweeter seasoning. Their salmon is excellent and the "Bim bim bop" or Korean fried rice is delicious. (For a treat ask for "Dol Sot bim bim bop" - which is the same dish in a hot stone pot but unmixed, you get to mix it together with as much (or as little) spicy seasoning paste as you want and it's much fun. 
 House of Dynasty, 7550 Telegraph Rd, ☏ +1 703 922-5210. Try their sesame eggplant. They have a ginger soy sauce for their steamed meat dumplings which you'll want to drink straight. Their house mustard and duck sauce are worth the trip. Their chicken and corn soup is unique and amazing.

After appetizers they bring out a small serving of lemon sorbet "to cleanse the palate" and let you come fresh to the main courses. After dinner they bring out steamed wash cloths to clean up with. The place serves large generous servings at very reasonable prices. You can get out for surprisingly cheap, especially during lunch hours. 
 Paradiso, 6124 Franconia Rd (On the edge of Alexandria towards Springfield), ☏ +1 703 922-6222. Italian. They have a very respectable atmosphere of a high class establishment - but they accept casual dress and are completely welcoming of all - in fact they have a children's play room with Disney videos and toys for families, Sunday mornings they have a brunch with some delicious selections (try their bruschetta) and Karaoke Wednesday, Thursday, and Sunday nights on the bar/patio side.

Murphy's boasts an impressively tasty menu, including gourmet lunch and dinner specials. Enjoy their Champagne Brunch from 10AM-3PM every Sunday. 
 Union Street Public House, 121 S Union Dr, ☏ +1 703 548-1785. M-Th 11:30AM-10:30PM, F Sa 11:30AM-11:30PM, Su 11AM-10:30PM. The Union St Pub is an Old Town institution, in no small part due to its location and for the roomy (several rooms), comfy interior where you'll be able to sit even on a crowded Old Town weekend night, and where you'll find a good selection of local Virginia craft beers. The building itself is historic, dating back to when George Washington used it as a warehouse. Seafood fans should head to the left and the back towards the oyster bar. 
Coffeehouses[edit]
 Buzz Bakery & Coffee, 901 Slaters Ln, ☏ +1 703 600-2899. 6AM-midnight daily. The best reason to come may be the long hours when you can sip and surf the free WiFi. The close second runner up, though, are the treats—the brioche breakfast sandwich (think an omelet between rich brioche bread) is the local favorite, but the panini and desserts are also worth ordering. Tired travelers who need to spend some good time online updating Wikivoyage should brave the long walk and just check in here for the full day. 
 Misha's Coffeehouse and Coffee Roaster, 917 King Street, ☏ +1 703 548-4089. 
 Old Town Coffee Tea and Spice, 215 South Union Street, ☏ +1 703 683-0856. 
Outside Old Town[edit]
 Birchmere, 3701 Mt. Vernon Ave, ☏ +1 703 549-7500. A locally famous musical hall which has had a spectrum of artists from country acts such as Charles Daniels to classic rockers like George Thorogood. 
 Rustico, 827 Slaters Ln, ☏ +1 703 224-5051. M 4PM-10PM, Tu-Th Su 11:30AM-10PM, F Sa 11:30AM-11PM. Despite billing itself as a restaurant, this is a much better place for drinks (the food is overpriced). For drinks however, you'll find an enormous list of craft beers, and a very beer-knowledgeable staff. 
 Shooter McGee's, 5239 Duke St, ☏ +1 703 751-9266. Shooter McGee's has been a neighborhood restaurant and tavern for almost 30 years. 
Sleep[edit]
 Crowne Plaza, 901 North Fairfax, toll-free: +1-888-444-0401. In Old Town Alexandria. 
 Hilton Alexandria, 1767 King St, ☏ +1 703 837-0440. Hiltons are always nice, if big and impersonal, and this one has a fine location just west of Old Town, and next to the Metro stop for a very easy commute into the city. $170-420. 
38.804463-77.0439541 The Alexandrian, 480 King St. (updated Aug 2017)
 Lorien Hotel & Spa, 1600 King Street, ☏ +1 703 894-3434. Hotel and spa in Old Town Alexandria. Has pet-friendly options. 
 Morrison House, 116 S Alfred St, ☏ +1 703 838-8000. It's hard to compete with this B&B. Staying right off King St in the heart of Old Town, in a beautiful, stately, chandelier filled mansion in the colonial style. Has tuxedo-clad butlers, a classy piano bar, and a restaurant competitive with the best in the area. $150-420. 
 Sheraton Suites Old Town Alexandria, 801 North Saint Asaph Street, ☏ +1 703 836-4700. A hotel within walking distance of the Braddock street Metro station. While it's not in Old Town, the hotel is a short walk from historic sights and several high-quality restaurants. The entire property is non-smoking. The hotel has an on-site restaurant and an on-site fitness center with a lap pool. The hotel sometimes offers discounted rates for suites. 
In addition to the above, there is a large cluster of reasonably priced motels/hotels on Hwy 1 just outside city limits in the South Alexandria section of Fairfax County, within walking distance of the Huntington Metro. Prices in the area will likely run about half what more posh accommodations on King Street in Old Town would.

Stay safe[edit]
Alexandria, particularly Old Town, is a safe city with considerably less crime than its neighbor, Washington, DC. While you are unlikely to be the victim of a crime here, you should take normal precautions that you would in any urban area, such as keeping your car and hotel room locked at all times and not walking alone at night.
