Ithaca is a city in Central Michigan. It has a historic downtown district, some beautiful  historic buildings, parks and annual events.


Understand[edit]
Ithaca is the third largest population center of Gratiot County, with 3,098 residents.  Nestled in the center of Michigan’s Lower Peninsula, Ithaca greets visitors from all corners of the state. Ithaca serves as the county seat of Gratiot County, and is mid-point of the US-127 university corridor of Central Michigan University, Alma College, and Michigan State University.
The Ithaca Downtown Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is on Business US-127 along the former "Old 27" route.  Ithaca's best known landmark is the masterfully preserved Gratiot County Courthouse, which has in its front lawn the Gratiot All Wars Memorial Monument.  Just down the street you will find another beautiful landmark, the Ithaca Fire Hall, which once served as the original Village Hall.
In the summer months, visitors to Ithaca are greeted by beautiful flowers planted by area youth and community members, stretching along both sides of Business US-127 from the City Limits to downtown.  Woodland Park is filled with rolling hills, mature trees, and a volunteer-built playscape, as well as a large sledding hill for winter use.
Ithaca hosts several annual events, including the Ithaca Hometown Funfest (August), Dust Off Car Show (May), Gratiot Ag Society Fair (June), Old US 27 Motor Tour (August), as well as many other seasonal events.
