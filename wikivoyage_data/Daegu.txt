Daegu is in the middle of a wide, flat valley, rectangular in shape, and hosts one of the country's largest US military bases. It was promoted to a federal territory city (a city under the direct control of the central government) in 1981. In addition, in 1995, it was promoted from a federal territory city to a metropolitan city and maintains the current name of Daegu Metropolitan City. The obligatory South Korean slogan for the city is 'Colorful Daegu'. The Chinese character "大", which means there are many large hills, was used.
Daegu administers itself, although it is mostly surrounded by North Gyeongsang province and therefore is placed there in our hierarchy. Daegu and surrounding North Gyeongsang Province are often referred to as Daegu-Gyeongbuk, with a total population of over 5 million. During the Joseon Dynasty period, the city was the capital of Gyeongsang-do, which was one of the traditional eight provinces of the country.

Climate[edit]
Daegu has a cool version of a humid subtropical climate. The mountains that comprise the basin trap hot and humid air. Similarly, in winter, cold air lies in the basin. The area receives little precipitation except during the rainy season of summer, and is sunny throughout much of the year. The average temperature for January, the coldest month in Daegu, is -4 °C (25 °F) and for August, the warmest month, is 31 °C (88 °F).  Daegu's nickname is "Daefrica" (대프리카) because it is deemed as hot as Africa. In summer they install sculptures on the streets to make fun of this nickname.

Eat[edit]
Daegu Jjimgalbi. The local specialty consists of beef ribs cooked in a worn out aluminum pot seasoned with spicy red pepper powder and chopped garlic. This is completely different from the steamed short ribs cooked in soy sauce served in other areas of Korea. Its unique feature is the tongue-tingling, burning sensation it creates when enjoyed with soju (hard Korean alcohol) or rice mixed with leftover spices. Unlike the steamed ribs from the Seoul and Gyeonggi Province areas, the way its sweet and spicy taste sets your tongue ablaze is unparalleled. It first appeared in the early 1970s on a residential street in Dongin-dong, Jung-gu, which has since blossomed into a small "village" of local food establishments.
Daegu Ttarogukbap. For over fifty years, Daegu has been the only place in Korea where rice and soup are usually eaten separately, whereas other regions customarily mix their rice and soup together. In Korean, "ttaro" means "separate" and "gukbap" means "soup and rice". Putting them together to form the Korean compound word "ttarogukbap," the meaning becomes "rice and soup served separately". This dish, uniquely found in Daegu, is made with beef shank, leek, and radish cooked in a broth with plenty of red pepper powder and chopped garlic. It has an unrivaled aftertaste that is both spicy and refreshing. Its flavor is the epitome of Daegu's unique "spicy and burning" taste.Mungtigi (sliced raw bottom round steak)

There is a snow room, which is far more impressive than most jjimjilbang ice rooms, with falling snow from above. Unfortunately, this room can look a little ransacked if it has hosted families or drunks in the evening. There are small male and female sleeping rooms, but the open sleeping areas are fairly quiet too. The provision of sleeping mats is much worse than in most jjimjilbangs. The baths and saunas are large and impressive.

Stay safe[edit]
Like the rest of Korea, all of Daegu is safe at any time of the day. However, westerners, especially minorities or men with Korean women, may encounter hostility from drunken men, but this is increasingly rare. The water is safe, but newcomers with sensitive stomachs should be prudent with street food or with the spice levels. Be aware that some ATM machines close before midnight if you need late-night drinking money.
Korean taxi drivers may drive somewhat erratically. Drivers are usually honest and being cheated on fares is not common.
