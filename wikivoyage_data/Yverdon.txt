Yverdon-les-Bains with its 24,000 inhabitants, is the second largest town in the Canton de Vaud. Situated at the southern shore of the Lac de Neuchâtel, it is the southern gate to the Pays des Trois-Lacs (Three Lakes Region) [1], host of the 2002 National Exhibition (Expo.02) in Switzerland.


Understand[edit]
Mainly known for its thermal baths, this town has also a rich history and art life. It offers a prehistoric site of standing stones (dolmen) that is more than 6'000 years old, ruins of the Roman town, a castle of the 13th century, as well as a church and a city hall of the 18th century. The arts are well represented with the theatre Benno Besson, the Museum of Yverdon, the Swiss fashion museum, and the science fiction museum La Maison d'Ailleurs.

 Centre Pestalozzi. Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi (1746-1827) has lived during 20 years in the Castle, where he managed his educational institution from 1805 until 1825.

46.77866.6421 Maison d'Ailleurs. The Maison d'Ailleurs is devoted to science fiction and to superhero comics – and as such is the only of its kind in Europe. Its collection of more than 60'000 items is opened to scholars and researchers. Each year, 2-3 special exhibitions are organized on a great variety of topics related to science fiction, utopia and extraordinary journeys, such as flying cars, James Gurney’s Dinotopia, xenobiology, science fiction as a source of inspiration for ESA’s engineers, etc. 
The area around the beaches is somewhat industrial, but there are a few cool spots along the shore of the lake. Walk along the canals, watch the birds, and see the (partially rebuilt) menhirs of Clendy. These are situated in the forest, close to the roundabout at the exit of Yverdon towards Estavayer. The most convenient parking lot is the one at the main beach.
There is a nature reserve at Champ-Pittet with a forest path and a footbridge through the swamps which leads to a watchtower. The fauna and flora here is typical of the southern shore of Lake Neuchatel. There's even a train station of the Yverdon-Fribourg line near the entrance: get off at Yverdon-Champ-Pittet.
Do[edit]
Football: Yverdon-Sport FC play soccer in Swiss Super League, the top tier. Their home ground Stade Municipal (capacity 6600) is on the waterfront near the railway station.
