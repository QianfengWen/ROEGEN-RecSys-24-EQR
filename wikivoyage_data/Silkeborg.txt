Silkeborg is a town in Jutland founded in 1844 around a paper mill (Silkeborg Paprfabrik) at the Gudenå River. The history of the place goes back to the 15th century, when a castle was located at an islet in the lake of Silkeborg. This castle gave Silkeborg its name, meaning ‘silk castle’.
The city has been proclaimed as the "Outdoor capital" of Denmark, due to its many outdoor possibilities, and events.
Being surrounded by forests and lakes, nowhere in Silkeborg is far from nature. The city is on the banks on the longest river in Denmark,  (The Gudenå river), which makes water sports and activities very popular.
