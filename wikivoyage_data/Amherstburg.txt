History[edit]
Across the Detroit River from what developed as the state of Michigan in the United States, the town was permanently established in 1796 as a British military fort overlooking the river's mouth at Lake Erie. Fort Malden was occupied as a garrison. The town was developed by Loyalists who were granted land by the Crown in Upper Canada in compensation for losses in the Thirteen Colonies, or as payment for service in the military, after the British lost the American Revolutionary War. This enabled the Crown to increase population in Upper Canada and develop it. The new settlers built many of their houses in the French style of a century before, giving the new town a historic character. French-speaking colonists also settled here, some who were descendants of the Petite Côte settlement along the river to the north. St. Jean was their Catholic church.
During the days of the Underground Railroad before the American Civil War, fugitive African-American slaves often crossed the river to escape to freedom in Canada, after the Crown abolished slavery. Detroit abolitionists William Lambert and especially George DeBaptiste were key to helping the slaves escape. DeBaptiste owned a lake steamboat which was used to offload fugitives in town while docked ostensibly to load lumber. They used Fort Malden as an entry point to Canada.
When the fort was no longer needed for military purposes, the government adapted it for use as a "lunatic asylum". Its main building was later used as a Port of Entry Money Order office and Post Office savings bank. The town is named after Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst, commander of the British forces and first British Governor General of the Province of Quebec (1760).
