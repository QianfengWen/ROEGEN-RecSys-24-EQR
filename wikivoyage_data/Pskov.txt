Pskov is the largest city and administrative capital of Pskov Oblast. One of the oldest cities in the country, it has preserved many unique architectural monuments of the 12th-16th centuries. 
A unique ancient Russian city, it is striking in the number of old churches, walls, towers and other defensive fortifications, but the inimitable Pskov architecture is even more memorable: light and concise in its temple version, impressive in the fortification, and every time bizarrely asymmetrical. In Pskov there are some of the oldest monuments of fresco painting in Russia, ancient stone chambers and, of course, churches, most of which are at least 500 years old. It is part of the Silver Ring of cultural and historical centers of Northwestern Russia.
