Get around[edit]

Depending on the time of year you find yourself in town, and your intended goals, your visit may necessitate different modes of transportation.  With many of the nearly 3 million annual visitors arriving in the summer months, getting around town by motor vehicle is a bad idea. Bar Harbor is much, much quieter between October and April.
Use the Island Explorer buses to get around the island. They are sponsored by L.L. Bean and you don't have to worry about parking. 
Driving a large truck or SUV is ill-advised, as parking in Bar Harbor is not suited to such vehicles. On the bright side, bringing less stuff requires befriending of locals, improvisation, and overall a more fun Maine experience.
The central area of Bar Harbor is quite small and easily explored by foot.  This includes the shopping and eating establishments on Main St. and Cottage St., and the activities at the town pier.
Bicycles can be rented in town and may be put on the front of the buses.

Hiking[edit]
There are numerous trails around Bar Harbor, and even more in the surrounding areas of Mount Desert Island. When planning a hike, avoid driving and use the free Island Explorer buses. These stop at most trail heads, and afford an ideal means of taking hikes from one point to another without spotting cars. Bring and drink at least one liter of water per person and use sun protection. The nearby mountains and shoreline afford little protection from the sun. Dress in layers. Even on the hottest summer days, the mountains and shoreline can be windy and cool. Stay on the 160 km/100 miles of trails and 80km/50 miles of carriage roads.

Stay safe[edit]
While Maine has relatively low crime rates compared to the rest of the United States, Bar Harbor is rather different during tourist season. Locking of one's car is advised, although car theft is almost unheard of.
It is unsafe to venture out onto Maine's coastal waters without having the necessary equipment and experience.  This is true of kayaking, canoeing, sailing or any other kind of boating.  The water is cold and hypothermia can set in in a short amount of time.  Dense fog often rolls in very quickly as well as the occasional storm.  If you are determined to go out on your own, to do so without every single passenger wearing a PFD, or without having a compass and knowing how to use it, or without understanding how to navigate safely around other boats and water hazards is not only foolish but could result in serious fines from the Coast Guard or a Marine Patrol officer.  There are numerous companies on Mount Desert Island and else where that offer guided sea kayak, sailing, and power boat tours.
