Zakopane is a large, year-round mountain resort in Małopolskie Province in southern Poland. It's set in the Tatra mountains which form the natural frontier between Poland and Slovakia. It's been a spa and fashionable society spot, and is characterised by wooden chalets in a distinctive local style.

Hike[edit]
It's worth buying a map of the area if you're going hiking. Most likely you will be hiking in Tatra National Park. Be aware that as it is a National Park special rules apply—don't be loud, leave any garbage or disturb animals. Maps are sold by the tourist office (17 Kosciuszki St., telephone: 01820 12211), down the hill, on your left, just before getting to the bus stop and cross roads (Krupowki St. and Kosciuszki St.) in the centre of town. They'll also give suggested routes, based on the latest weather forecasts and your fitness and equipment. Entrance fee of 4 zł (2 zł for students and school kids).
The maps are very tourist-friendly, with the "difficulty levels" for different paths marked: possibly slightly patronising for seasoned hikers. The pram symbol for the 'easy' paths is taken too literally - people have been seen trying to get prams up steep paths from Zakopane into the mountains. All the paths marked on the map are well maintained by the government.
Whichever route you plan to take, it is advised you dress warmly and bring spare waterproof clothes and water. Put the clothes in a plastic bag in your backpack to keep them dry in case of rain. Even midsummer it can hail for a whole day in the mountains! Remember you are already at 1000m, although it doesn't feel like it.

Many shops at Krupówki promenade.
Eat[edit]
A local speciality is Oscypek, smoked sheep's milk cheese.
There are many good eateries within Zakopane. Look for authentic-looking wood huts. Avoid ones with colourful lights and multi-coloured lamps. Good "Bacowkas" include "Bąkowo Zohylina Wyźnio and Nizino" right off of Krupowki. Chata Zbójnicka on Jagiellońska is also good for authentic food (and experience). You can also try the fried fish eateries anywhere in town for a quick, cheap meal. Trout is the speciality in this town.
There is a cheese market every day. It's probably best to come early in the morning while the produce is still fresh, but it's fine to eat whenever it's purchased.
