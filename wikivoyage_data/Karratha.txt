Karratha is a city in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, with a population of 17,013 in 2021. It's entirely modern, built from 1968 to house mining and port workers - Dampier is the port. The main reason for other visitors to linger, apart from urgent car repairs on the hot dusty road to Broome, is to view the petroglyphs in Murujuga National Park. 


Understand[edit]
This area was traditionally the home of the Yapurarra. The coast was explored by Europeans from the 17th century, one of them being William Dampier (1651-1715) who gives his name to an island and small port. Settlement for livestock farming got underway in the 19th century and led to conflict with the Aboriginals. When two police officers and a pearling worker were murdered in 1868, reprisals led to the Flying Foam Massacre - casualties are debated but it effectively wiped out the Yapurarra.
Livestock was exported via Dampier and other small ports, and not much else happened until the 1960s, when vast reserves of iron ore and other minerals were discovered inland across Pilbara. A series of mining towns sprang up, railways were built to the coast, and the ports grew into modern industrial zones. Karratha was built as a new town from 1968, and rail and road causeways linked it to Dampier, no longer on an island but on what's now called the Burrup Peninsula. Iron ore is still big business and then in the 1980s the North West Shelf oil and gas field was discovered. 
This has sucked in a huge workforce who are mostly FIFO, "Fly in, fly out." They work a "swing" of say two weeks solid then are flown home for a week off. Their families don't relocate here, no company could pay them enough, so they stay in camp - trailer parks or simple motel-type accommodation. They're decent hard-working folk but have no long term commitment to the town.

See[edit]
-20.6641116.71761 Red Dog is the fellow that greets you at the entrance to Dampier. He was a cattle dog (1971-79) that ranged independently across Pilbara, loping along or hitching rides, with several owners but adopted by the community at large as a true Australian free spirit. Then someone poisoned him, and his status as a "sight" says it all about Dampier's other attractions. The residential area is nondescript, while north is the ugly dusty port. Turn back 1.5 km for the start of Burrup Rd, the route north up the peninsula.
-20.6359116.7882 Ngajarli or Deep Gorge has a remarkable collection of Ngarda-Ngarli Aboriginal rock engravings and other artefacts - some over 47,000 years old. You explore it along a 700-metre boardwalk, accessible free 24 hours but with the best viewing in afternoon light. The gorge is within the detached southern part of Murujuga National Park.
Hearson's Cove is a scenic beach 1 km east of the Ngajarli turn-off, suitable for swimming at high tide. It has public toilets, which Ngajarli doesn't. It's not within the Park: barbecues are permitted but not camping.
Staircase to the moon is a natural effect seen on the Pilbara coast March-Oct on the full moon spring tides. Water caught between the ripples on the mudflats exposed at low tide creates the image of a golden staircase towards the rising moon. You need a southeast-facing view, and Hearson's Cove is about the best spot. Viewing times are published locally, eg by the Visitor Centre.
-20.6004116.77633 North West Shelf Visitor Centre explains the huge natural gas facility west side of the peninsula. Hours vary, but usually Wednesdays 9AM to noon.
Roebourne Gaol is now a visitor centre
Mount Wongama is a lookout reached by a turnoff from Burrup Rd. Look north, you don't want to look at the industry west. This turn-off is far as you should venture with 2WD. The road continues by Withnell Bay and becomes rough: you need high-clearance 4WD to reach Conzinc Bay, and Aremvee Beach where camping is permitted. North coast of the peninsula, a narrow channel separates Dolphin Island.
-20.583333116.8333334 Murujuga National Park northern section occupies the north of the peninsula.
-20.617116.65535 Dampier Archipelago is a group of 42 islets west and north of Dampier. They have many fine beaches and boat trips visit for marine life, diving, snorkelling and fishing. Camping is permitted.
-20.767117.156 Roebourne east on the main highway was a gold-rush town in the 1880s then lapsed into slumber. It has several historic buildings of that era, including the old gaol which now houses the Visitor Centre.
-20.673117.1917 Cossack is a small village north of Roebourne with basic accommodation. This is another beach for seeing the "staircase to the moon" as it has a view southeast, while northeast is the disused lighthouse on Jarman Island. Cossack has a museum, and near the turn-off is a memorial to Red Dog, buried in the boonies hereabouts.
-20.633117.28 Point Samson is the resort village at the end of the sideroad.
-20.46115.549 Montebello Islands are a group of 174 islets some 200 km west of Dampier, so they're beyond a day trip. Boat tours sometimes visit. They're a wildlife reserve from which cats and rats have been removed, and indigenous species re-introduced. Vodka Beach on Trimouille Island is the preferred camping spot, but don't dig too deep to build your sandcastle. In the 1950s Britain tested atomic bombs here, and there is residual contamination. For Barrow Island to the southwest see Onslow.
