Chemainus is a town of over 4,000 people (2021) in central Vancouver Island.  It's notable for the dozens of murals that transform the compact city centre into an open-air art gallery.  It also has a thriving theatre festival, and various other creative arts. It's a pleasant place to visit and stroll through.


Understand[edit]
Chemainus
The name Chemainus comes from the native shaman and prophet "Tsa-meeun-is" meaning broken chest. Legend says that the man survived a massive wound in his chest to become a powerful chief. His people took his name to identify their community, the Stz'uminus First Nation, formerly the Chemainus Indian Band.
The railway arrived in the 1880s and by the early 1920s the town's population had ballooned to 600 people. Chemainus was eventually designated a census populated area by Statistics Canada comprising the more built-up residential and commercial neighbourhoods. Its population had further grown to 3,035 residents by 2011.

Outdoor murals at Chemainus
Chemainus is most commonly known for its murals (gargantuan paintings on the sides of the buildings). Times for the horse-drawn-buggy-tours or walking tours can be found either on Willow Street from the guides or within the Information Office in Water Wheel Park. Though the town is small enough to explore by foot in a single day and visit the murals by yourself, you won't get the history behind them without a tour guide.

Where you can enjoy many famous and original plays performed by experienced and up-coming actors alike. The shows can be hit or miss depending on the current talent and script selection though, so always ask the locals if the current viewings are worth it. Most tour guides and information clerks feel more or less obligated to give a positive review however, so check in with the younger service workers for an honest opinion. Regardless of the performances, the show-and-dine combination is always an interesting experience.  (updated Mar 2023)
