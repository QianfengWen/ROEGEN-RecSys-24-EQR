Kawarage Jigoku

Not to be confused with Yuzawa Town, Niigata (Echigo-Yuzawa), a famous ski resort.

Yuzawa (湯沢市; yuzawa-shi) is a city at the southeastern corner of Akita Prefecture, along the border with Yamagata and Miyagi.  It is southeast of Yurihonjo and south of Yokote.


Understand[edit]
Tourist information site[edit]
The local tourist association has a Japanese-only guide site.

Get in[edit]
Yuzawa is accessible by train.  The main station is Yuzawa Station (湯沢駅).  By car, Yuzawa is located on Highway 13, which goes to Yokote and Daisen in the north, and Yamagata in the south.  The expressway is free between Yuzawa and Yamagata — however, Yokote is not free.

Get around[edit]
Most of the city's attractions are located far away from any stations, so walking is not recommended. There is a bus that runs to Oyasu Gorge from Yuzawa Station, passing Inaniwa Castle. 
In order to help tourists who come by train to visit the city's sites, the Komachi Shuttle is a sightseeing taxi service that offers a variety of different travel packages to sights around the city. They have 4 hour and 8 hour taxi tours. Reservations are required. You can reserve one of the shuttle taxi tours on their website.

38.992406140.6002681 Kawarage Jigoku (川原毛地獄). Closed in winter (Nov to early May). Named as one of Japan's "hells" (jigoku) for its stark-white volcanic rocks and sulfide gases seeping from vents in the rocks, it was a place of ascetic worship long ago. Sanzensoji Temple was built here to worship, and like many places of ancient mountain worship, women were forbidden. Later it became a sulfur mine. Today there are walkways that allow visitors to explore the hell safely. The main walkway leads to the Jizo statue and Oyutaki Waterfall. (updated Feb 2024)

Sleep[edit]
Some travelers sleep in their cars, which is typically not a problem. However, if you drink in the evening and sleep in your car, it is a good to use a personal breathalyzer before driving the next morning — even a small amount of alcohol in your system makes driving illegal, and the police are known to watch for this.
