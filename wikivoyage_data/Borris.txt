See[edit]
Village centre is a line of late Georgian cottages, mostly single-storey and white or grey-harled. The houses are east side of the street, while west is the wall of the Borris House estate, with an imposing gatehouse.
Borris House is a mansion of 1731, re-vamped in mock-Tudor in 1820. It's now a wedding and events venue, no tours, but you might manage to peek at the exterior.
Borris Viaduct at the south end of the village, with 16 arches, was built in the 1850s to carry the railway between Bagenalstown and Wexford. The track was abandoned in the 1960s, and the viaduct now has a firm footpath, handrails and ramp access.
52.58-6.9331 Ullard Church: see Graignamanagh for this 12th century ruin. As the crow flies it's closer to Borris, but by road you have to backtrack on R705 to cross the river.
52.583-6.7672 Mount Leinster  is the peak of 793 m / 2605 ft rising to the east, the highest of the Blackstairs Mountains along the boundary with County Wexford. It's easily ascended by the track from Nine Stones car park to its north.

South Leinster Way is a 104 km hiking trail from Kildavin, County Carlow to Carrick-on-Suir in County Tipperary. From the northeast it comes into Borris along the lane, turns northwest to join R705, then from the bridge heads south along the east bank of the river to Graignamanagh.
Boating: the river is navigable throughout, with short sections of canal and locks to get past the weirs and shallows, but there are no mooring facilities around Borris.
The Festival of Writing and Ideas is held at Borris House in August. The next is probably 19-21 Aug 2022, tbc.
