Climate[edit]
The climate in Half Moon Bay is more "foggy San Francisco" than "sunny California" in style. It's easy to spot the tourists on the beach: they're the ones shivering in bikinis. The locals are more likely to be found in wetsuits or strolling along the beach in shirts and rolled-up pants. Although there are cold snaps that drop below freezing every few years or so, and a few days here or there that are warm enough to be uncomfortable every year, on typical days, it's cool and somewhat windy, but not downright cold. Even in the summer, you'll want to pack a jacket or an extra shirt to put on when the ocean breeze kicks up in the early evening. Plan for rain from mid-October through April.

Be careful to check for ticks after hiking in fields in the Bay Area, as this region has a high rate of Lyme disease transmission. If a rash with the appearance of a bull's eye develops at the tick bite site, immediately seek medical help and treatment with antibiotics.
For those visiting the beaches, never go swimming alone, and beware of rising tides.
