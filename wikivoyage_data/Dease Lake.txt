Dease Lake is a small community in the North Coast-Nechako region of British Columbia. Located on Highway 97 (Stewart-Cassiar Highway), Dease Lake in is a popular place for travellers to stop and stock up on basic supplies travelling to and from the Alaska Highway.


Understand[edit]
Dease Lake (pop. 300) is a government service and supply centre for the region. It lies a few hours south of the Yukon border on Stewart–Cassiar Highway (Highway 37) at the south end of the lake of the same name. Dease Lake is the last major centre before the Alaska Highway while driving north. It is the junction of Telegraph Creek Road (also referred to as unsigned Highway 51) that leads to Telegraph Creek and the Grand Canyon of the Stikine.
The town sits astride a pass separating the basins of the Dease River (N) from that of the Tanzilla (S), a tributary of the Stikine. The pass is part of Continental Divide and is a division point between drainage to the Pacific Ocean, via the Stikine, and the Arctic Ocean, via the Liard and Mackenzie Rivers.
Dease Lake is midway between either Smithers or Terrace and Whitehorse.

History[edit]
In 1837 a Hudson's Bay Company post, known as Lake House, was created by Robert Campbell on the shore of Dease Lake about 50 km (31 mi) north of the Stikine River and 150 km (93 mi) south of where the present day Alaska Highway passes. The Lake had been named in 1834 for Chief Factor Peter Warren Dease, and would become a major junction for miners travelling to the gold rush in Cassiar (later an asbestos mine). Although the fort was abandoned soon after, the town based around the fort lived on, and was renamed Dease Lake in 1934 by then-Chief Trader John McLeod.
During the 1960s and 1970s, BC Rail started to build an extension of their line towards Dease Lake, but construction was halted. Grading was completed all the way, and can still be seen from the air.

Grand Canyon of the Stikine River near Telegraph Creek
58.082222-130.7351 Grand Canyon of the Stikine (take the gravel Telegraph Creek Road from Dease Lake — it is very narrow and very steep in places). The Grand Canyon of the Stikine is a 72 km (45 mi) stretch of the Stikine River that has been compared to the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River. The canyon begins in the vicinity of the 130° W, south of Tsenaglode Lake near the Hwy 37 road bridge, and eases off at the community of Telegraph Creek. The canyon is described as being unnavigable by any watercraft, however there have been numerous successful descents made by expert whitewater paddlers. The canyon is home to a large population of mountain goats and other wildlife.   (updated Jul 2020)
