Dumbarton is a town in Clydeside in the Central Belt of Scotland, with a population of 20,480 in 2020. It stands on the north shore of the Clyde at the outflow of the River Leven, which drains Loch Lomond. Most visitors are simply making a stopover, as this is the first town and cluster of accommodation you encounter heading north from Glasgow towards the Highlands. The main reasons to visit are the castle and the model ship tank. 


Understand[edit]
Dùn Breatann is Gaelic for "hill of the Britons" referring to Dumbarton Rock, the crag standing over the Clyde and fortified since ancient times. The Britons spoke a P-Celtic language akin to Welsh; in 840 AD they were driven out by the Vikings and supplanted by the people of Strathclyde, who spoke the Q-Celtic forerunner to modern Gaelic. 
Shipbuilding and whisky-distilling were the town's traditional trades, and it was the historic county town of Dunbartonshire (note the spelling). It nowadays hosts West Dunbartonshire Council, and is a commuter town for Glasgow and for Faslane navy base ("HMNB Clyde") on Gareloch. It's frankly ugly, a sprawling mess of ill-planned post-war concrete. Anyone who detests Scotland's five planned "New Towns" such as Cumbernauld had better come here and take a look at the alternative.

By plane: Glasgow Airport (GLA IATA) is nearby, and easily reached with a car via A898 Erskine Bridge, but there's no public transport that way except twice a day when the Citylink buses to the Highlands call at the airport. So you usually have to travel via central Glasgow; else consider taking a taxi. 
Trains run every 15 min from Glasgow Queen Street (low level) to Dumbarton East (for castle), Dumbarton Central (for town) and Dalreoch (for Levengrove Park). They either originate in Edinburgh and continue to Helensburgh Central, or in Springburn or  Airdrie and continue to Alexandria and Balloch on Loch Lomond. The trains towards Helensburgh also stops at Cardross (for Geilston Garden).
Every couple of hours, trains along the West Highland Line from Glasgow Queen Street stop at Dumbarton Central, but not the other stations, on their way north via Helensburgh Upper and Arrochar & Tarbet to Crianlarich, where they divide for Oban or Fort William. 
The Caledonian Highland Sleeper leaves London Euston Su-F after 9PM, reaching Dumbarton around 6AM on its way to Fort William; the return train picks up around 11:30PM to reach Euston by 8AM. You might prefer to take the Lowland Sleeper towards midnight then a daytime train from Glasgow. 
55.9465-4.56731 Dumbarton Central has a staffed ticket office and machines, a cafe, waiting room and toilets. There are steep ramps to both platforms.  
55.9426-4.55422 Dumbarton East has a ticket machine and waiting area but no other facilities. Access is by steps to the island platform. 
First Glasgow Bus 1 / 1A / 1B runs every 30 min from Glasgow Osborne St via Scotstoun and Clydebank railway station to Dumbarton, taking just over an hour, and continuing either north to Alexandria and Balloch, or west to Helensburgh. This and other local buses ply along Glasgow St and High St; there isn't a bus station.
First Bus 206 runs from Balloch and Alexandria, taking 50 min. It's every 30 min M-Sa and hourly on Sunday. 
Scottish Citylink buses from Glasgow to Oban, Campbeltown, Fort William and Skye pick up and drop off at Barloan Toll roundabout on A82 at the north edge of town; they don't come into town centre.

Get around[edit]
The buses for Balloch run up the Vale of Leven, while those for Helensburgh follow the coast via Cardross.
Taxi: Wright Taxis serve Dumbarton and Alexandria, tel +44 1389 721010.

Dumbarton Rock
55.93613-4.562891 Dumbarton Castle, Castle Rd G82 1JJ, ☏ +44 1389 732167. Apr-Sep: daily 9:30AM-5:30PM, Oct-Mar: Sa-W 10AM-4PM. This 240-ft (73-m) basalt crag, the old plug of a volcano, has been a redoubt at least since the Iron Age, and the castle remained garrisoned until after World War II. Nothing of the ancient Alt-Clut and little of the medieval fortress survive, it's mostly 18th century, including the fine Governor's residence. You need to clamber up 557 steps to reach the White Tower Crag. Dorothy and William Wordsworth visited here in 1803 with Coleridge: the soldiers were particularly keen for them to see the trout in the well by the guardroom, where they said it had dwelt for over 30 years, a sad metaphor of garrison life. Adult £6.   (updated Nov 2019)
55.94338-4.563282 Denny Ship Model Experiment Tank, Castle Street G82 1QS, ☏ +44 1389 763444. M-Sa 10AM-4PM. Come you back to Mandalay, wrote Rudyard Kipling, Where the old Flotilla lay; Can't you 'ear their paddles chunkin' from Rangoon to Mandalay? Those were the Irrawaddy Flotilla paddle steamers, built in Dumbarton by Denny shipbuilders, then sent out in portions to be reassembled in Burma. Dennys were in business from 1840 to 1963 and were great innovators, experimenting with hovercraft and helicopters, and one of their most enduring innovations was this 100-m ship model testing tank, built 1882. Propulsion, steerage, hull designs and so on could all be tested on models before committing to a prototype build. After Denny closed it was taken over by Vickers to test submarine designs, then became part of Scottish Maritime Museum in 1982. The towing gear is still run for demonstrations, but the instrumentation is gone so it can't be used for real tests. Adults £4.50.   (updated Nov 2019)
55.9414-4.57333 Levengrove Park, Clydeshore Rd G82 4AE. Daylight hours. Large park on the headland where the River Leven flows into the Clyde, donated to the town by the Denny shipbuilding family. It has many play areas for children, mature trees and flower beds. There are remains of an old parish church, a cafe, and grand views of the castle from the tip of the park. (updated Nov 2019)
Old Dumbarton Bridge, built in 1765, crosses the Leven just north of Levengrove Park. It still carries traffic but is now bypassed by the bridge on Glasgow Road 100 yards north.
55.9689-4.66384 Geilston Garden, Main Road, Cardross G82 5HD (5 miles west of Dumbarton). Apr-Oct: daily 9:30AM-5PM. A National Trust for Scotland Garden, which dates from 1797, but the current layout is Edwardian. Geilston House is not open, but there's a fine walled garden, a riverside area along Geilston Burn and a fruit and vegetable garden. Seasonal fruit & veg are for sale. Dogs are allowed in part of the garden, except on Tuesdays. Adult £8, NT / NTS free.   (updated Oct 2022)
Denny Ship Tank
55.9703-4.64065 St Peter's Seminary above Cardross is a bizarre ruin. It was built in the 1860s as a baronial mansion, and became a Roman Catholic seminary in the 1960s. This was then engulfed in a brutalist concrete carapace that won lots of awards but was a shambles to maintain, occupy or cultivate a pious priestly vocation within. The seminary decamped to Glasgow in 1980 and for a time the building was a drug rehab project, then a vandalised mess. The mansion was demolished in 1995 after a fire rendered it unsafe. The concrete structure has defeated a string of projects to rescue it and you may find the area fenced off.
Kilmahew Castle 200 yards north of the seminary was built at the end of the 13th century, and inhabited to mid-19th century, then fell into ruin.
55.952-4.5256 Overtoun House and Gardens, Dumbarton G82 2SH (2 miles east of town). The house, a 19th-century baronial mansion, is run as a religious centre and can't be toured. You come for the woodland walks in the extensive grounds - the Forestry Commission suggest a couple of trails. The fine bridge spanning the glen to the house has since 2005 been the subject of an internet meme, whereby passing dogs are supposedly lured to their death over the parapet by irresistible animal scents, canine suicide-wish or paranormal influences, not necessarily in that order. That meme is recycled here to keep the tradition going: your dog's not at risk unless it believes all the trash it reads on the internet. Free.   (updated Nov 2019)
55.978-4.52557 Auchenreoch Moor towards Alexandria has a walking trail with here and there the remnants of a "Starfish" air raid decoy. In the Second World War Britain had decoy defences for airfields and other military installations, and extended these to the cities after the 1940 bombing of Coventry. At the onset of an air raid, a control bunker set off pyrotechnics to resemble the incendiaries dropped by the pathfinder aircraft, thus drawing the bomber fleet away from town and the shipyards.

Helensburgh's main attraction is Hill House designed by Charles Rennie Macintosh.
 Loch Lomond stretches north of Balloch. The west shore carries the busy A82; the east shore is more peaceful around Balmaha, except at weekends when the city hordes arrive.
Don't regard Glasgow as just a transport hub, it's a great destination in its own right.
