Get in[edit]
By boat[edit]
At least one boat per day all year round (by the Penn ar Bed company), leaving from Brest and Le Conquet. In summer, there are more boats.
Duration:

2h from Brest
30 minutes from Le Conquet.
For schedule and fares, see the Penn ar Bed Web site.
From the jetty (located in the north-east of Molène), Molène harbor (and center) is hardly 10 minutes by foot. Otherwise, there is a shuttle, that costs 2€50 per passenger.

By helicopter[edit]
A heliport allows to reach the mainland if you are in a hurry (and wealthy).

Get around[edit]
The island is almost entirely car free.
Considering its size, it is very easy to go by foot.
Most of the "streets" are in fact car-free, and cannot even be cycled.
