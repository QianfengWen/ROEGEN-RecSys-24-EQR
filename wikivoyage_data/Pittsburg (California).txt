Pittsburg is in the east part of Contra Costa County in the San Francisco Bay Area on the west edge of the San Francisco Bay Delta. The city was first called New York Landing as the city founders envisioned that this city would become the "New York" of the west. Its neighboring community, Bay Point, used to be known as "West Pittsburgh".
