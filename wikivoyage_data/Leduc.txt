Leduc is a city in Edmonton Capital Region.  It has a population of 34,000 people (2021).  It is known for its industry and the Edmonton International Airport.  Leduc County is also home to the Leduc Number 1 Oilwell, which started Alberta's oil boom in 1947.


Understand[edit]
Leduc was established in 1891, when Robert Telford, a settler, established a home stead in 1889, near a lake which would later bear his name. It was on that piece of land where the new settlement would take root. Telford had served as an officer for the North-West Mounted Police, and later became Leduc's first postmaster, first general merchantman, and first justice of the peace.
The establishment of the Calgary and Edmonton Railway, later acquired by the Canadian Pacific Railway, opened the region to settlement. The first train stopped at Leduc in July 1891.
Leduc got its name when a settler (McKinlay) setting up a telegraph office 1886 and needed a name for the new office and decided that it would be named after the first person who came through the door of the telegraph office. That person was Father Hippolyte Leduc, a priest who had served the area since 1867, he wanted to inform his bishop he was on his way to Ottawa. Five years later the Minister of the Interior , who had been Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories, Edgar Dewdney (1835–1916), decided in 1891 the new railroad terminal  should be named Leduc, since the telegraph office was already carried his nam. At the time the railway had provided the Minister a list the railroad had acquired from Father Lacombe which included Leduc's name.
The town continued to grow quietly over the decades and Alberta's historical oil strike on February 13, 1947, occurred near the town at the Leduc No. 1 oil well.
