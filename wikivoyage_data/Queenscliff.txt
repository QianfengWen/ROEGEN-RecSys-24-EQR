Queenscliff (also known as Queenscliffe) is an historic maritime community perched on a small spit of land in the south-eastern most corner of the Bellarine Peninsula. Located in the Greater Geelong region of Victoria, the town was settled only a few years after Melbourne, and is characterised by its strong European heritage, maritime and seafaring character and its lasting connection to the sea. The town is dotted with museums, grand hotels and also a fine variety of restaurants and eateries. It is most known as the port of call of the Searoad Ferry, which connects the region to Sorrento on the Mornington Peninsula.
This guide also covers the adjacent tourist resort of Point Lonsdale, a popular destination for family getaways with its splendid beach.
As of 2022, the Borough of Queenscliff is the last remaining borough in Australia. Most of the area surrounding Queenscliff has been engulfed into the larger city of Geelong.
