Lincoln is the capital and second largest city of Nebraska, U.S. As the state capital, it offers several historical sites, as well as museums, art galleries, and other cultural venues.


Understand[edit]
State Capitol
Lincoln is the seat (1869) of Lancaster County, in the southeastern part of the state, about 60 miles (95 km) southwest of Omaha.
Lincoln was founded in 1859 as the village of Lancaster.  Renamed and made Nebraska's state capital in 1867, it's the second-largest city in the state. It's the state's center of government and higher education and is a regional transportation center.  Even with a population of 290,000 (2019), it retains a friendly, "small town" feel.
There are several threads running through Lincoln's cultural composition.  The university and state government have attracted many rural Nebraskans to the city over the years, reinforcing its small town feel.  Its position as a college town also helps shape the city's political culture, which is somewhat more liberal than most of the rest of the state.  Once a very ethnically homogeneous city, it has become more diverse since the 1980s, welcoming immigrants and refugees from various parts of the globe.
There is a long-standing friendly rivalry with Omaha, 57 mi (92 km) to the northeast.
