Toodyay (pronounced "two-jay") is a farming town 85 km east of Perth in the Wheatbelt Region of Western Australia, with a population of 1362 in 2021. It's an easy day trip from the city and the main attraction is its well-preserved Victorian buildings. 


Understand[edit]
Freemasons Hotel in Toodyay
19th century Perth expanded north and south, but the Darling Scarp to the east was a barrier in horse-drawn days. In 1830 Europeans found their way up the Avon valley into the area known by the Noongar Aboriginal people as "Duidgee", which perhaps means a fertile place. It was certainly good enough for farming, with a Mediterranean climate as the scarp draws rainfall, so a settlement grew up called "Newcastle." Many of its labour force were convicts, with a depot where they were housed and allocated to farms. The first settlement was floodprone so in the 1860s it relocated to its present site. The town lock-up in 1861 became one of many escape scenes by the bushranger Moondyne Joe (1826-1900), who got away on the horse he'd been locked up for stealing, along with the magistrate's brand new saddle. The railway arrived in 1887, a spur of the narrow-gauge line to Northam. This carried passengers, freight such as timber, and misdirected mail intended for Newcastle, New South Wales (a valuable ormolu clock being the prize example). In 1910 the town was persuaded to change its name to Toodyay, and its original site became known as Old or West Toodyay. 
Better roads snaked out from Perth in the 20th century, and in 1966 a standard gauge railway reached Toodyay along a new route up the Avon valley, so the narrow-gauge line closed. These put the town within commuting distance of Perth, and within a day-trip for city dwellers. Toodyay is now a mixed commuter, and agricultural community, its 19th century elements are well-preserved, sitting next to newer developments.
The Visitor Centre is on Piesse St opposite the supermarket,  open daily 9AM-4PM.

By road follow Highway 50 Toodyay Road northeast from Perth and reckon an hour. Only fit hardy cyclists should attempt it, as the hills are long and steep, and the cars and trucks don't expect to see bicycles on their narrow race track. The main highway then turns south to Northam, where it joins Hwy 94 away east to Kalgoorlie and Norseman. Eastlink WA is expected to run through Toodyay when it's constructed, but the freeway construction will only commence in 2024 with no completion date as of 2023.
Buses don't run through Toodyay.
