Swan Hill is a city in the Murray region of Victoria. It lies on the south bank of the Murray River. With a population of around 11,000 in 2018, the town is full of country charm and interesting cultural and historic attractions, without the crowds of a large regional centre.


Understand[edit]
In the Aboriginal Dreamtime, the hunter Totyerguil ran out of spears while chasing Otchout, the cod, near Swan Hill. The cod squirmed and thrashed around so much, a large channel opened up, which became the Murray River. Aboriginal people have lived in the area for at least the last 9,000 years. The Swan Hill area is the traditional lands of the Wemba-Wemba and Wati-Wati people. The Wemba-Wemba people call the town "Matakupaat" (place of the Platypus).
The area was given its current name by explorer Thomas Mitchell, while camping beside a hill on 21 June 1836.

Get in[edit]
Swan Hill's location at the northern extreme of Victoria means that Melbourne is a major gateway for (and source of) travellers. Road access is very good and connections to surrounding towns are reliable.

By train[edit]
Swan Hill is the northern terminus of the Swan Hill railway line, served twice daily by V/Line trains from Melbourne. The train journey takes 4.5 hours and departs from Southern Cross Station in Melbourne, the terminus for all country services. Unlike other routes, this line requires reservations and paper tickets (Myki cards are not valid for travel past Eaglehawk) which can be purchased from Southern Cross (or other V/Line stations), on the V/Line website or by calling 1800 800 007.

By car[edit]
The Murray Valley Highway connects Swan Hill to Mildura, Kerang, Echuca and Albury-Wodonga. Melbourne can be reached in about 3.5 hours via Bendigo (Calder Freeway) and Kerang (Loddon Valley Highway).

By bus[edit]
The V/Line coach network operates several routes that pass through Swan Hill. The daily Mildura–Albury-Wodonga service passes through around lunchtime and reaches either end from 6-8pm. The Mildura–Ballarat–Mildura loop service also passes Swan Hill. There is also a connection to Melbourne with a train connection in Bendigo. Reservations are required for V/Line coach services in this area.

By plane[edit]
The gateway to Victoria is Melbourne Airport (MEL IATA), which serves many domestic and international destinations.
The regional airport at Mildura (MQL IATA) is connected to Melbourne, Sydney, Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast, but flights can be expensive. Access to Swan Hill is by bus.
