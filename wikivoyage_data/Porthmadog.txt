Porthmadog, formerly Portmadoc, is a small coastal town in Gwynedd with a population of 4,000. It has a picturesque harbour.


Understand[edit]
William Madocks built a sea wall in the early 1800s that reclaimed the region for agricultural land. The town grew during the 19th century and by 1861 had a population of 3,000. The town became significant as a port, but that part of the local economy declined with World War I. 19th-century wharves still survive, but the harbour is used by leisure yachts.
