Abeokuta as the name implies is coined from Yoruba phrase "Abé òkúta"￼ which means under the rock solely because of the presence of Giant rocks, the most notable been Olumo rock which is one of the major tourists attraction in the city.


Understand[edit]
Abeokuta is one of the most progressive areas of present-day Nigeria, although it has had its fair share of trials. After having been settled by members of the Egba nation who had emigrated out of the restive Oyo Empire, then inhabited by Chief Sodeke and his people trying to flee Dahomey and Ibadan slavehunters, it saw a period of prominence as a center for palm oil cultivation. King Gezo and the Dahomey, being not just a little pinched with jealousy by this, invaded to start the Battle of Abeokuta in 1851 which the local inhabitants won.
The British also began infiltrating at this time, first missionaries, and then colonial interests. To gain protection during the Yoruba Civil Wars, the king or alake of the Egba signed an alliance with the British which consummated in British imperialism. There were a couple of uprisings over this new period, namely the Adubi War and Abeokuta Woman's Revolt, but Abeokuta rolled with the punches until Nigerian independence, then became home to a number of reputable universities and considerable industry.
