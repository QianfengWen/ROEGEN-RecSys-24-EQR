Sherwood Park is the immediate eastern neighbour of the city of Edmonton.  This large suburb has no legal status as such, and is instead part of Strathcona County, which it dominates in terms of population.  Sherwood Park is not a major tourism destination but does have hotels, shops, and restaurants, and is a convenient gateway to either Edmonton or the nearby Beaver Hills.


Get in[edit]
Sherwood Park
Highway 16 (Yellowhead Highway) travels in the area.  Travelers can take the highway to Sherwood Park heading east from Edmonton and heading west from Saskatoon.
Sherwood Park has Wye Road, Cloverbar Road, Baseline and Sherwood Drive as main roads. Apart from driving one's own car there is also the possibility to use the transit system (bus) which will go right into central Edmonton, the University of Alberta or West Edmonton Mall.

The park is in the North Saskatchewan River valley, on both banks of the river, at an elevation of 625 m (2,051 ft) and has a surface of 2.9 km² (1.1 sq mi). For thousands of years this was the site of an annual Aboriginal camp, as it was close enough to the river for transportation and trade and the bluffs of the river valley provided excellent bison-hunting opportunities. The park was established to preserve the site from encroaching industrial development. It was the site of archeological excavations in 1978 to 1980.   (updated Mar 2019)
