Llangollen  (meaning "church of St Collen") is a small town in Denbighshire, Wales, ten miles southwest of Wrexham. It's on A5, the historic stagecoach route, and close to the English border, so it's been a tourist destination for 200 years. It's notable for its abbey, the spectacular leaping aqueduct that carries the canal, and the fine half-timbered abode of the "Ladies of Llangollen".


Get in[edit]
The best way to arrive in Llangollen is by car or bus.  The A5 (from London to Holyhead) runs through the town.  On busy weekends the car parks within the town centre quickly fill (both short- and long-term), and the narrow streets slow to a crawl.
Arriva Bus 5 runs every 30 min from Wrexham, taking 45 min via Rhosllanerchrugog. 
By train you can reach either Chirk or Ruabon, from there check for local buses to complete the journey into Llangollen.

Get around[edit]
Llangollen is a small town and all the tourist attractions can be reached on foot.  The town centre consists of one main street running between the A5 and A539, most of the other roads lead off this.  There is cheap car-parking in the town centre, just off the main street, but on busy weekends and holidays, it fills quickly.

This was once the home of the 'Ladies of Llangollen' from 1780 to 1831 and their tomb can be found in the grounds of St Collen's Church in Llangollen (which you will see on your right as you enter via the A5). The inside has many intricate carvings many brought by visitors (including the Duke of Wellington) to the ladies - Miss Sarah Ponsonby and Lady Eleanor Butler. The two women are amongst the most celebrated of the town's former residents. They arrived after eloping from their families in Ireland. The exact nature of their relationship is ambiguous, however they formed a lifelong partnership until they died within two years of each other in 1829 and 1831.

As you approach the town by either road from the east you will see the Pontcysyllte aqueduct carrying the Llangollen Canal over the River Dee, it is 126 feet high and a 1007 feet long. The aqueduct is an impressive sight, with 19 arches each of 45 feet and holds 1.5 millions litres of water. Construction was started in 1795 by Thomas Telford and it was completed in 1805. Built from local stone the aqueduct is the largest anywhere in Britain. The name Pontcysyllte is Welsh for 'bridge that connects', and is pronounced "pont-cuh-SUTH-(l)tee". You can take a walk across the aqueduct or traverse it on a boat.   
52.9792-3.15953 Castell Dinas Brân. A ruined castle, overlooking the town from a nearby mountain top. It is an open site (i.e. no admission charge), and the view is worth the long walk and climb.

You will find this directly over the canal bridge and the initial part of the footpath runs alongside the school of the same name. Dinas Bran was constructed in or around 1260 AD and is on a site that is believed to have held a wooden hillfort. The site was barely occupied for 20 years before falling into disuse.   
52.9694-3.167764 St Collen's Church. This church was founded by St Collen in the 6th century and the name 'Llangollen' (meaning 'church of Collen') was derived from this early inhabitant. The site has been developed since then from what had been a simple stone cell. Amongst the main features of the church are its stained glass windows and its 15th-century carved roof. It is claimed by some that the timbers for this roof came from nearby Valle Crucis Abbey.   (updated Apr 2015)
