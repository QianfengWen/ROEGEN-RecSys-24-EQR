Castillo de Monteagudo
Murcia is a sizable city (according to Spanish average) with 450,000 inhabitants in 2018, ranking seventh in Spain. It's in southeastern Spain, inland but not far from the coast.
It’s mainly a services city and an important university town. Murcia is known for its huerta (agricultural zone) and its famous products (fruits and vegetables) exported all over Spain and Europe, its folklore (mainly based around its huerta), its festivals and its several baroque churches. 
It's the capital of the Murcia Region, one of the seventeen autonomous communities in which Spain is divided into.


Understand[edit]
The city of Murcia was founded in 831 by Abd-Al-Rahman II in the center of the Segura River valley. The remnants of this Moorish rule can be seen in the still-visible city wall, which contrasts strongly with the city's numerous churches, mainly of baroque style, on which cause is known for being "the baroque city in Levante (southeastern Spain)".
Murcia city is typically Spanish but a little cosmopolitan, it is more of a peaceful place to live: lots of safe, pedestrian streets, large green areas, very kind people, and neither too quiet nor too busy. Since it's placed inland, Murcia tends to be calm during the holiday season when people move to the coast, and lively during the school year, especially since it is a university town. 
The most famous thing about Murcia used to be its vegetables; neighbours from Cartagena call residents of Murcia "green stomach" (but Murcianos do not like this nickname).

The Palacio del Almudi
The Iglesia de San Esteban
For a good view of Murcia and the surrounding valley, the best place to go is El Valle or the La Fuensanta Sanctuary, both of them in the mountains behind the city. Directions: Go toward Cartagena, and before the mountains (5 or 10 km away from Murcia), head towards La Alberca and pass straight by. You will see signs for Santuario de la Fuensanta. Try going there for sunset; the view is incredible.
Another place that shouldn't be missed is the Moorish castle on top of the Monteagudo mountain that can be seen from almost anywhere in Murcia. It was converted to Christianity by placing an "open arms" image of Christ on the top. Directions: leave Murcia by the old Alicante road and it will take you 5 minutes to reach. The motorway to Alicante will also take you there. Park the car down the mountain and walk to the top. You can touch Jesus's feet and toes (bigger than footballs!) while having a look at Murcia and his huerta.
