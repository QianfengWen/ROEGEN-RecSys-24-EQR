Kibuye is one of the districts with the least population density of 334 inhabitants per square kilometre (870/sq mi) as of 2012 census. 
Tourism is one of the main economic sectors of Kibuye. Kibuye's location near Lake Kivu, the beautiful scenery and its many islands are the main draws. There are many resort and hotels which have been built recently outside the town of Kibuye, most on the shores of Lake Kivu. 

Get in[edit]
When coming from Kigali, the section of the direct NR15 road from Muhanga is undergoing the much needed extensive reconstruction (as of 2023).
The NR11 from Cyangugu to the south is in good condition (as of 2021).

By bus from Kigali[edit]
Capital bus line runs from Kigali to Kibuye and back every hour on the hour.  The trip will take you about 2 hours and 45 minutes.
A second option is to take a local bus (matatu) which costs the same amount as the more legitimate bus line Capital.
By bus from Gisenyi[edit]
1. Onatracom runs a bus from Gisenyi to Kibuye most everyday.  The bus is extremely crowded and you often won't get a seat.  However, with a price of only 2000 RWF it is great deal.  The ride takes around 5 hours.  From Gisenyi, the bus leaves at around 07:30.  Get there well ahead of time if you want to have a seat.
2. A second bus line, Zam Zamu, runs a camper-bus looking bus service between Gisenyi and Kibuye.  This bus leaves at around 11:00 or 12:00 and costs 3000 RWF.  It is smaller and more comfortable than the Onatracom.  The trip takes roughly the same amount of time though.

By bus from Cyangugu[edit]
By boat[edit]
It is supposedly possible to catch a ride from Gisenyi to Kibuye on the boat (Primus boat).  This fleet of boats will run whenever there is a need to transport beverages from the Bralirwa bottling facility in La Brasserie (Gisenyi) to either Kibuye or Cyangugu.

There is a ferry from Kibuye going to Gisenyi. The ferry departs every Tuesday and Friday at 12:00. The cost of a ticket from Kibuye to Gisenyi is 2,500 RWF.
There is also a ferry from Kibuye going to Cyangugu . Te ferry departs every Wednesday and Sunday at 10:00. The cost of the ticket from Kibuye to Cyangugu is 3,500 RWF.

Lake Kivu
One of the most popular islands to visit in Karongi is Napoleon Island; a large island which is popular for hiking and for viewing one of Africa's largest colonies of straw-colored fruit bats which resides on the Island. Other islands in Karongi are Monkey Island which has a small population of vervet monkeys, and Amahoro or Peace Island which used to have a camping site.

Night fishing is another popular pastime in Karongi. At night, fishermen sail on three wooden boats bound together by smaller poles and use gas lanterns to lure small Isambaza or Tanganyika sardines into their nets. Some fishermen allow tourists and other visitors to join them on their boats.
