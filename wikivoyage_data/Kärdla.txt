Understand[edit]
Kärdla Fire Station
Kärdla is the biggest and only town on Hiiumaa. It is located at the edge of the Baltic Sea on the east coast of the island. It allows for a convenient base to explore the rest of the island by car or bicycle.
Hiiumaa capital Kärdla probably existed as a small Swedish settlement already in the 14th century, however, the oldest written record of Kärdla dates from the year 1564. The Swedish word Kärrdal denotes a wet and boggy valley. A more dynamic period followed, after the barons Ungern-Sternberg founded a textile factory in 1829 to produce a heavily milled woolen cloth - broadcloth. The directors' house (the Long house) has survived until the present day.
