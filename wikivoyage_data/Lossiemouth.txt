Lossiemouth is a village on the coast of Moray in North East Scotland, with a population in 2016 of 7870. It developed as a fishing port in the 18th and 19th centuries, but the harbour is small and that industry has gone. Its main business now is as a service town for RAF Lossiemouth, the base for Britain's Quick Reaction Alert Interceptors.
So this unassuming little place now stands on the frontline of NATO's air defences. Russian bomber planes, some of them supersonic, regularly hurtle across the Norwegian and North Seas towards the UK. They are intercepted while still in international air space by Typhoon FGR4 fighters from RAF Lossiemouth. Everyone shows off their prowess and alertness, exchanges pleasantries and goes home safe. And yet another gambit has been played out across the great chessboard that stretches over quiet fields and icy seas and forests and onion domes.

James Ramsay Macdonald (1866-1937) was Britain's first Labour Prime Minister, in office in 1924 then 1929-1934. He was born at Gregory Place: look for the little row of cottages at the foot of Macduff St, facing the park, and there's an indistinct plaque by the door. He was illegitimate, Macdonald was his father and Ramsay his mother. He moved away to Bristol then London, and along with Keir Hardie and Arthur Henderson founded the Labour Party in 1900. He was first elected MP for Leicester in 1906, and now comfortably off, he had a house built in Lossiemouth for his mother. His second spell of government was blighted by the Depression. From 1931 he was figurehead leader of the National Government, a coalition dominated by the Conservatives. Reviled as a traitor to Labour, his health failed and he left politics, embarked on an ocean cruise but died on the trip. His body was returned for funeral at Westminster Abbey.
57.7141-3.28842 Hillocks is the house that Ramsay Macdonald had built in 1908 for his mother. She died shortly after moving in but he kept the house as a base for himself and family in Scotland. It's at 17 Moray St, a couple of short blocks inland from his birthplace. Both buildings are private residences, no tours.
57.688-3.3613 Duffus Castle is a ruin off B9017 to the southwest. A wooden motte-and-bailey was built in 1140, wrecked around 1300, then replaced by a stone castle in the 14th century. That in turn was abandoned in 1705. It's free to access anytime.
57.7-3.3864 St Peter's Kirk near Duffus is the ruin of a 12th-century church, with its original mercat cross. It's free to explore daily Apr-Oct 9:30AM-5:30PM, Nov-Mar 10AM-4PM. You may need to collect the gate key from the Old Manse.
57.703-3.375 Gordonstoun is the famous Public School secluded in woodland near Duffus, so you can only see it on special occasions like an Open Day, with a prospective entrant in tow. The school nowadays has some 500 boarders and 100 day-pupils; those who've sent their sprogs here include Sean Connery, David Bowie, and the Duke of Edinburgh. Charles III (then Prince of Wales) detested it as "Colditz with kilts" and his escape attempt in Stornoway ended badly; naturally Ofsted rated it "outstanding".
57.707-3.4346 Hopeman is a small port laid out in the 19th century to export stone from the local quarries. It has sandy beaches.
57.7-3.4857 Burghead is a small coastal town built on a grid pattern 1805-09, sweeping away the remains of its Pictish fort. However an ancient well discovered during that work was preserved: steps lead down into a chamber fed by underground springs. The visitor centre displays Pictish artefacts and may allow access to the well.
