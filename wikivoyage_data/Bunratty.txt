Bunratty (Irish Bun na Raite, "end of the Raite river") is a village in County Clare, in the Shannon Region of west Ireland. It's best known for Bunratty Castle, which has a folk museum and medieval-themed banquets. Its resident population (as of 2016) is only about 350, but there are many brief visitors: the village is very touristy but has good accommodation and food. Shannon Airport is only 5 km west and Bunratty offers a more enjoyable stopover than the airport area.

In Bunratty the bus stop is by The Creamery Bar. The nearest railway station is Limerick Colbert, with hourly trains from Dublin Heuston and connections from Cork.
By road take M7 west from Dublin, which bypasses Limerick to become N18 / M18, with sliproads at Bunratty and Shannon before it turns north towards Galway. You'll know you're in the right place when you see all the tour buses parked next to the castle.
And see Limerick for other connections, including the direct bus from Dublin Airport.

Get around[edit]
52°42′0″N 8°49′12″WMap of Bunratty
Bunratty is a small village, with the castle, hotel and restaurant strip all a short walk along the main street, now bypassed to the south by N18. B&Bs are strung along L3040 the lane north, called "Lower Road" or "The Low Road". There's no bus along there so you'll want wheels to stay, and to explore the countryside.

See[edit]
Bunratty Castle
Bunratty Castle is three attractions: the castle itself, the Folk Park outdoor museum (visited on the same ticket), and the medieval banquets which are separately ticketed and described below under "Do" as they're more like cabaret performances than dining. The castle and park are often used as event spaces.
52.69958-8.8119251 Bunratty Castle and Folk Park, Bunratty West, ☏ +353 61 711 222, reservations@shannonheritage.com. Daily 9AM-5PM. The castle, built 1425, is the most complete medieval fortress in Ireland. It became derelict in the 19th century but was restored in 1954. There's an extensive collection of 15th and 16th-century furnishings, tapestries and artwork. The Folk Park is an outdoor museum or skansen, with over 30 buildings collected from around the country - even the church was hauled here from Ardcroney in County Tipperary. Costumed docents illustrate various crafts and daily activities of the 19th century. There's also a walled garden recreated to the same period. Adult €15, child €9.   (updated Apr 2020)
Do[edit]
Reservations are essential, via castle website or +353 61 360788.
Medieval Banquets are a sort of O'Cabaret. They're held year-round twice a night within the castle at 5:30PM and 8:45PM, a four-course meal with drinks and themed entertainment, with the "Earl's Butler" acting as MC. The guests don't themselves put on medieval drag, though on corporate nights who knows. Demand priced, say €60 a head.
Irish Nights are held in the Corn Barn of the Folk Park, Apr-Oct nightly at 7PM. Three-course meal (simpler fare than the Banquet) with traditional music and song, approx €50 a head. The shows suit those for whom real Irish pub entertainment, which only gets buzzing from 9PM, would be way past their bedtime.
Buy[edit]
For touristy stuff, Blarney Woollen Mills and Meadows & Byrne are just opposite the castle.
Fuel and top-up shopping for the road are at Spar Express (M-Sa 6AM-11PM, Su 7AM-11PM).

Go next[edit]
Bunratty is at the east edge of County Clare, so head west for its main sights along the coast from Mizzen Head, Cliffs of Moher and the Burren.
Just east is Limerick, an interesting Georgian city like a miniature Dublin, and many sights in County Limerick to its south.
New York or Boston: say you need to drop the rental car back at Shannon and be on the midday homeward flight to the US, you want to check in not much after 9AM, so you need a nearby stopover the night before. Bunratty might be a more agreeable spot than an anonymous chain airport hotel.
