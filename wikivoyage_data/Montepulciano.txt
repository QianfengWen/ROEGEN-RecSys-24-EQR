Montepulciano is a city in Tuscany famous for its wines, especially the classic red wine Vino Nobile di Montepulciano. The town has gained notability from being used as a location for the Twilight films.


Understand[edit]
Palazzo comunale
Montepulciano is one of many Medieval towns dotting the Tuscan countryside in the southeast of the Italian province of Siena. It sits on a limestone ridge surrounded by the rolling hills of the Val D'Orcia and of the Val Chiana regions characteristic of towns in the area. 
Montepulciano is known especially for its red wine made from Sangiovese grapes, Vino Nobile di Montepulciano. Its local wine is traditionally considered one of Italy's best red wines and was lauded by the poet Francesco Redi as "the king of all wines!" (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, on the other hand, is a varietal wine that is not made here, but in Abruzzo.) 
Montepulciano is also known for food such as pici pasta and pecorino cheese.
It is said to have been settled first by the Etruscans. The town was fought over by the Sienese and Florentines during the Medieval and Renaissance periods. Finally, in the 1500s, it came firmly under Florentine rule. Today, the town of 14,000 people (2017) is known as an epicurean destination and many visit to sample the local wine and cuisine.

By road[edit]
Montepulciano is a few kilometres from the A1 Autostrada and from the more scenic SS2 from Rome to Florence. Cars are not allowed inside the old town as it is a ZTL-controlled area (except with a permit, available from hotels) so park in one of the numerous lots at the edge of the town. The lots fill up quickly in late summer, the height of the tourist season.

By bus[edit]
Buses, departing from Piazza Pietro Nenni, connect Montepulciano with many other Tuscan cities: Siena (75 minutes, 4/day none on Sunday), Pienza (30 minutes, 8/day), Montalcino (1 hour, 10/day, change in Torrenien) and Chiusi (hourly). Route #146 into Montepulciano is quite scenic. See Tuscany#Get_around for tips.
If you are walking into town from the bus station (autostazione in Italian), there is a pedestrian short-cut with an elevator and stairs to the top of the cliff. The entrance is through a portal on Via delle Lettere at the corner of Piazzale dello Sterro, about 50 m from the bus station.

By rail[edit]
The nearest railhead is a half-hour drive away at Chiusi from where there are frequent trains to Florence and Rome.

Get around[edit]
The only way to get around within the historic centre is to walk along the steep pathways. Driving within the historical old town is not permitted without fines unless you are a local with a permit. Outside the historic old town, a car is recommended to drive around the countryside and outer town. Road biking is also possible, although be wary of cars on the narrow, curving, and rolling roads.

Drink[edit]
Montepulciano is the centre of an ancient wine-growing region, so go ahead and sample some. Three varieties of wine are available (all are mostly from the sangiovese grape): Rosso di Montepulciano, Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, and Vino Nobile di Montepulciano Reserva, in increasing order of subtlety and price. The wines tend to be full-bodied, the kind that goes well with a picture of generations of Tuscan peasants, sitting in the fields, eating cinghiale (boar) while swigging the good stuff!
