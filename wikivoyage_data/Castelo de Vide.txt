Castelo de Vide  is a mountain village in Alentejo. In 2011, it had about 3,400 residents. The romantic character of the village of Castelo de Vide, associated with its gardens, abundance of vegetation, mild climate and proximity to the Serra de São Mamede, made it known as "Sintra do Alentejo" (this designation is attributed to King Pedro V).


Understand[edit]

Houses seen from the town

It is unclear when humans settled Castelo de Vide (kush-TEH-loo d(ih) VEE-d(ih), /kɐʃ.ˈtɛ.ɫu dɨ ˈvi.dɨ/), although  establishment of a fortification helped fix a new population to the territory and, at the same, functioned as a strategic border fortress.  In the 14th century, Afonso Sanches, son of king Afonso III, rebuilt the fortification walls, and his brother King Denis continued the task, with work completed during the reign of King Afonso IV. 
Throughout the 14th century the settlement slowly expanded outside the castle walls. The southern flanks, with good southerly exposure and a gentle slope, allowed easy settlement, while the northern and western exposures expanded later due to wind and steep cliff faces. The growth of the settlement occurred along the main road leading to the castle, and followed the expansion of religious buildings outside the walls. This road bisected two sides of the hill and one side was occupied by a Jewish quarter inhabited by Jews expelled from Castile and Aragon.
In the 16th century, the settlement was dedicated to the cultivation of wine grapes, cotton, olives, fruits, and cereals, and raising cattle, while watermills were constructed along the ravines in Vide and Nisa. At the beginning of the 16th century, toward the end of King John III's reign, the wool industry became important in the region.
