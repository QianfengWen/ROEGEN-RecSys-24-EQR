Understand[edit]
Port-Cartier is one of the two largest municipalities in the region along with Sept-Îles. In addition to its main village, the city of Port-Cartier also includes the villages of Pointe-aux-Anglais (Cannon township) and Rivière-Pentecôte (Fitzpatrick township). Pointe-aux-Anglais owes its name to the sinking of 11 ships of the British fleet in the St. Lawrence River off Île aux Œufs in 1711, forcing Admiral Walker to abandon his mission to take Quebec City. The coastline of the village of Pointe-aux-Anglais includes a fine sandy beach of 11 km (6.8 mi).
