Newton Stewart is a town in Dumfries and Galloway in southwest Scotland, along the main road between Carlisle, Dumfries and Stranraer. It's named for William Stewart who built several houses and obtained a burgh charter in 1677 from King Charles II. In 2020 the population was 4030.
This page also describes The Machars, the peninsula south dotted with prehistoric and medieval remains, and Glen Trool in the hills north.

Newton Stewart is on A75. From England leave M6 at the border to follow A75 west past Gretna, Dumfries and Castle Douglas. From Glasgow follow A77 to Girvan then A714 through Glen Trool.
National Express buses from London via Newton Stewart to Stranraer remain suspended in 2023. Their suggested workaround is to travel via Glasgow, but via Carlisle might be quicker. 
Stranraer is the nearest railway station (26 miles), with trains from Glasgow Central and Ayr, and ferries from Northern Ireland. Stagecoach West Scotland Bus 500 runs from Stranraer via Glenluce to Newton Stewart (75 min), Castle Douglas and Dumfries, M-Sa every couple of hours and Sunday every four hours.
Bus 359 runs from Girvan every two hours M-Sa, taking 70 min via Glen Trool.

Get around[edit]
Newton Stewart is small enough to see on foot, but to explore The Machars or Glen Trool you need a car.

Bus 420 potters around town M-Sa hourly. Dashwood Square is the town's main bus stop.

See[edit]
54.9594-4.48621 The Museum, York Rd DG8 6HN, ☏ +44 1671 402677. Apr-Sep: M-Sa 2-4PM. It is in an old church, with displays of local history. (updated Feb 2023)
55.09216-4.48382 Bruce's Stone is in Glen Trool overlooking the loch. It commemorates an early victory by King Robert the Bruce over the English, in 1307 when he ambushed them in the narrow glen. The car park is a starting point for several hikes, including the ascent of Merrick, at 843 m the highest peak in this area.
54.868-4.4443 Wigtown is a village with well-preserved early 19th-century streets. The County Buildings west end of the main square recall its brief importance as administrative centre of the former Wigtownshire. The village declined in the 20th century, losing its industry and railway, so the Book Festival from 1999 was an attempt at revival.
54.8775-4.52264 Torhouse is a ring of 19 granite boulders, and 3 centre stones aligned with outliers, probably late Neolithic to early Bronze Age. It's along B733 three miles west of Wigtown.
54.7939-4.41145 Sorbie Tower is the ruin of a 16th century fortified tower house. It was the bastion of Clan Hannay, who had supported Balliol against Robert the Bruce. Another political wrong call in the 17th century got them outlawed and they fled to Ulster, where Hannay became a common surname.
54.7783-4.37016 Galloway House Gardens is a colourful arboretum, free but you pay for parking. The walled garden is closed. Galloway House is from the 18th century, a private residence so you can't visit.
Bruce's Stone
54.7575-4.35627 Cruggleton Castle represents the culmination of 2000 years of falling to bits. Its earliest known inhabitants were Iron Age, but probably even they were shaking their heads at the downfall of its stone age pomp. In 1684 it was described as "wholly demolished and ruinous" so no change there. There's just a few shards of the tower, and you come for the coastal walk. Cruggleton church half a mile west is Romanesque: it too fell into ruin but was restored from 1890. Cruggleton village is lost but probably huddled around the church.
54.7-4.368 Isle of Whithorn was tidal into the 19th century then became connected by road. The castle is a 16th-century tower house guarding the landward end of the causeway to the island and harbour. St Ninian's Chapel, ruined, is from the 13th century: it was part of Whithorn Priory, a ruin on Bruce Street in the village. The square white tower on the headland is a navigational daymark.
54.6937-4.4499 St Ninian's Cave is a sea cave with early Christian carvings and crosses. It was probably a hermitage attached to the priory.
54.7387-4.568710 Barsalloch Fort is the earthwork of an Iron Age dwelling on the cliff edge.
54.7669-4.543811 Drumtroddan Standing Stones are Neolithic or Bronze Age, a small group along B7021. The farmer has closed access but you see enough from the road. Half a mile north (as the road becomes B7085) are more stones with cup-and-ring inscriptions.
54.8056-4.680312 Chapel Finian is the foundations of a 10th- to 11th-century church. St Finnian (495–589) was from Ulster, stayed awhile at Whithorn Priory, and went on to study in Rome. He returned to Ulster and founded Movilla Abbey near Newtownards.
54.8964-4.325513 Glenquicken Stone Circle is an oval group of 29 stones with a central pillar, two miles east of Creetown.
54.8592-4.309614 Cairnholy is a pair of Neolithic chambered cairn tombs. They're 3 miles east of Carsluith village, where the castle is a ruined 16th-century towerhouse.
