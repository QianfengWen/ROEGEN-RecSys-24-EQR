See[edit]
40.6192-8.7371 Gafanhas, Bairro de Pescadores (at the seaside). The Gafanhas are on the way from Aveiro city to the beaches of Barra and Costa Nova. Instead of taking the freeway, it is possible to travel on the side road through the Gafanhas along side the ria shoreline. By doing so near the cod and fishing warehouses that line the front of the Gafanha fishing harbour, occasionally, it's possible to spot the four-masted schooner Maria Manuela,a typical Grand Banks Portuguese cod fishing sailship of a bygone era, preserved and functioning as a sailing training school ship, when at harbour after a sailing cadet training voyage. 
40.642821-8.7499882 Farol da Barra (Barra Lighthouse). Some 62 meters high, it was built near the end of the 19th century, replacing the older and smaller Aveiro lighthouse near the fort, when the Aveiro harbour underwent major redevelopment and expansion works. The lighthouse authorities allow visitors every Wednesday. Arrangements to go inside are done under the lighthouse keeper supervision, due to only small groups being allowed at any one time, for safety reasons. The panoramic sights however, are worth the climb to the top. (updated Mar 2018)
