The Custom House in the harbor of Alexandroupoli
Alexandroupolis (Greek: Αλεξανδρούπολη, Alexandroúpoli) is a city in Western Thrace, northeast of Greece.


Understand[edit]
Alexandroupolis is a small town with a harbour and an airport. Though some guides describe it as "dusty", it has a rocky beach and a typical Greek nightlife. It is the last major Greek town before the Turkish border on the highway to Istanbul.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
40.856625.9451 Alexandroupolis International Airport "Dimokritos" (AXD  IATA). There are four flight every day linking the city to Athens by Olympic Airlines, and Aegean Air. There are three flights every week from Alexandroupolis to Heraklion or Sitia (Crete) by Sky Express.   (updated Jun 2020)
By train[edit]
There are several trains from Thessaloniki. Slow trains take 6h (€9), fast ICs take only 4 1/2h (€16).
Train connections are relatively frequent to the rest of the country, though the rail link to Bulgaria via Dikea has been canceled until further notice. Trains are running only to Dikea, 15km short of the Bulgarian border. There are no buses from Dikea to the border city of Svilengrad, with taxi and hitchhiking being the only options to access Svilengrad and the extensive Bulgarian rail network for the time being.

By bus[edit]
National Network of Buses or KTEL operates a frequent schedule of buses to all the major cities of the country. Shuttle buses depart twice daily to Athens (approximately 8–9 hours) and there are hourly connections to Thessaloniki.
OSE, the national train operator, has set a daily bus shuttle to Istanbul that departs the main station early (around 7AM) every morning. Tickets are usually easy to find and can be booked in the ticket office.

By boat[edit]
The most important connection is the ferry to Samothrace. For sailboats the harbor is also well suited. The number of berths is very limited.

Since the city and especially the center is small and flat, you can easily walk to explore the city: for the sights outside the city, a vehicle is essential.

40.906225.9013 Castle of Avanta (Potamos) (Boz-Tepe) (outside the village of Avanta, 10 km from Alexandroupolis). The castle is on the provincial road that connects Alexandroupolis with Avanta. From far you can see the three impressive medieval towers of the Potos River. They are square and surrounded by a double wall. It is thought to have been built in the 13th century by the Gatelouzos, the Genoese conquerors of the area, on a site occupied on prehistoric, Ancient Greek and Byzantine periods. The climb to Avanta (or Potamos) Castle, from the west side of the hill, takes about 20 minutes. A grandiose gate is preserved, with two tall towers on both sides and the ramparts of the castle, with the stairs leading up there. The view of the whole plain from the warriors fully justified the construction of the Avanta Castle at this point. The ruins that the visitor sees today date back to the 13th century, although there are findings from the Mycenaean period. The whole area has scattered castles on hillsides and rocks that allow the field and the passage to be monitored by Rodopi and Komotin. (updated Oct 2018)

40.865226.03396 Traianoupolis (Λουτρά Τραϊανουπόλεως). The city was founded by the Roman Emperor Trajan (reigned 98-117) and was famous in Roman times for its baths. In the 4th century, it became the capital and metropolis of the Thracian Roman province of Rhodope. Despite a chequered history, the city remained the metropolis of the ecclesiastical province of Rhodope until its decline in the 14th century. The area was destroyed in 1322 by Bulgarian raids and 1329/30 by Turkish troops. On display are ruins of former bathing facilities and parts of the city wall. You should definitely combine a visit with a visit to the modern bathroom, because even today, the place is a health resort.   (updated Dec 2018)
40.86325.63827 Mesimvria. Mesimvria was a colony of the inhabitants of the island of Samothrace, built at the end of the 7th century BC. The city flourished in the 5th and 4th century BC. However, during the period of the Macedonian and later Roman rule, it began to lose importance, as the construction of roads in the hinterland lowered the importance of the coastal city. On the excavation site, the remains of the fortress wall with towers, private houses, a road network, public buildings, a sanctuary of Demeter and an Apollo temple were found. The most important monuments of the excavation site are: The Shrine of Demeter. Inside the building, silver, gold, silver and gilded relief panels were found, all connected to the Demeter cult. Dated to the 4th century BC. The archaic temple of Apollo. It was part of a larger building complex (35 x 45 m) with a central paved courtyard, surrounded by a stoa. Many ceramic fragments with engraved inscriptions were inside the temple from the 6th and 5th centuries BC. Found.  (updated Dec 2018)

40.826.019 Evros Delta is a wetland nature reserve at the outflow of the River Evros (Έβρος) or Maritsa. The main river channel is the border with Turkey: there's no legal crossing point, but smugglers and migrants often try to cross. You may therefore find access restricted.
