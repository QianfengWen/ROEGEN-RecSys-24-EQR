Baotou[dead link] (Chinese: 包头 Bāotóu, Mongolian: ᠪᠤᠭᠤᠲᠤᠬᠣᠲᠠ Buɣutu qota) is a city on the Yellow River (Huáng Hé) in Inner Mongolia. The metropolitan area has a population of over two million.


Understand[edit]
The largest city in Inner Mongolia, Baotou used to be an arid region inhabited by Mongolian herders and their sheep.  The town that has since grown up has four main parts

Donghe — the old part of town and lies to the east
Qingshan — part of the new city
Jiuyuan
Kunqu (Kandulun) — major part of the new city and is the main shopping and entertainment area with all the western restaurants near Baobaidalou (a large walking street and shopping area)
The new city is bisected by Gangtie St, a large road that goes from the east in Qingshan to the west in Kunqu.
