Bucerias is a city in Nayarit, on the Pacific Coast of Mexico. Bucerias is a popular beach town on the coast of Bahia de Banderas, about 11 miles (18 km) northwest of the Puerto Vallarta airport. It has a permanent population of 13,000 people (2010), which doubles during the high season.


Understand[edit]
The tourism and expat district is the two-block by twelve-block area between the beach and National Highway 200 (MEX-200). The highway is also shown on maps and in street addresses as Blvd. Rivera Nayarit and as Av. Heroes de Nacozari.

A meandering city street in an arroyo that acts as a drain for rainwater bisects the town into the eastern “Zona Dorada” with the beach lined mostly with hotels and condos and the western “El Centro” with mostly restaurants lining the beach. The two zones are joined across the arroyo by the “Puente del Beso” foot bridge. A central park, a statue of an oyster diver and an extensive artisan market are near the footbridge in El Centro.
The real estate company Elements Realty Group publishes a tourism and business map that is available at its office  (Av. Mexico two blocks west of the park) and Jody Tours across the street.

You can get to Bucerias from the airport by purchasing a taxi voucher near each exit.
Surrounding areas such as Puerto Vallarta, Nuevo Vallarta and Sayulita will also offer taxi service to Bucerias.  Make sure you negotiate a price before you leave.

When you pass the Mega department store in Bucerias (on the right-hand side), you will soon need to start watching for your stop, and move toward the bus exit.
There are also direct buses to Bucerias from Las Glorias in Vallarta. These go non-stop to Walmart and from there continue to stop regularly. It's for the same fare.
