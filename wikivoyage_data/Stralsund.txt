Stralsund[dead link] is a city in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. The Gothic historic centre of Stralsund is (along with Wismar's) a UNESCO World Heritage Site.


Understand[edit]
Stralsund was founded in 1234, and was a member of the Hanseatic League and thankfully retains a lot of the architecture of its glory days. Stralsund was part of the Swedish Empire from 1648 to 1814, and was involved in the Great Northern War. Swedish king Charles XII had to escape from exile in the Ottoman Empire, and rode from Pitești to Stralsund on fourteen days. The city lies in the federal electoral district of the 2005-2021 German Chancellor, Angela Merkel.
