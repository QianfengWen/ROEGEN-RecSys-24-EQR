Sleep[edit]
Jackson is nice enough, but it offers not one place for sleeping, unless you enjoy the great outdoors. The nearest towns aren't great. Unless you have friends to stay with, your best bet would be a brand name hotel in Point Pleasant, Freehold, or Toms River. If money is no object then either check into the Molly Pitcher Inn in Red Bank, take a room in Princeton, Summit, or New York City, or rent a house in Spring Lake or Bay Head.
