Zittau is in Upper Lusatia, close to the Czech and Polish borders.


Understand[edit]
In the Middle Ages Zittau was a flourishing trading town thanks to its location on the crossroads of several long-distance trading routes.
A new chapter in its history opened on May 1, 2004, when the accession of Poland and the Czech Republic into the EU meant that Zittau went from being a remote backwater in Germany to a strategically located crossroads at the heart of Europe.
