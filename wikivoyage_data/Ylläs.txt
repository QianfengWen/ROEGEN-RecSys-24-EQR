Ylläs is a popular ski resort in the municipality of Kolari in Finnish Lapland.


Understand[edit]
Ylläs fell (Yllästunturi) in summer
Ylläs is a fell (Finnish: tunturi), a gently rounded mountain whose top is above the treeline — the English word "tundra" comes from the native Kildin Sami word tūndâr. This characteristically Lappish landscape was created during the Ice Age, when kilometre-thick ice scraped away at what were once mountains, wearing them down.    
The village of  Ylläsjärvi ("Lake Ylläs") lies to the south of the fell and the village of Äkäslompolo ("Lake Äkäs") to the north, about 10 km apart as the bird flies.

Climate[edit]
Located north of the Arctic Circle, Ylläs experiences over a month of Polar Night in December and January. This is also the coldest time of year, with an average high of −9 °C (16 °F) and average lows of −17 °C (1 °F), not factoring in the considerable wind chill atop the treeless fell if you're skiing. Among the Finns, the most popular time of the year to visit is the Easter holidays in March or April, when average temperatures are closer to zero and on a good day you can ski in a T-shirt. (Just watch out for sunburn!)
The season for Northern Lights (Aurora borealis) runs from late August to early April. On average, they can be spotted 150 nights per year, although this depends on cloud conditions and just plain luck. Check the space weather forecast before heading out into the Arctic night.
See Lapland for the other seasons.

Get in[edit]

By plane[edit]
Kittilä airport, about 50 km east from Ylläs, has regular flights from Helsinki and occasional charters elsewhere in high season. Rundgren buses meet most incoming flights; the trip to Ylläs takes about 40 minutes with a flat fare of €13.80. Metered taxis are also available, that ride costs around €100.
Another possibility is to fly in Sweden from Stockholm to Luleå and from there to Pajala airport. There you may take an airport taxi for the 30-km trip to Finland.
The nearest larger airport/town is Rovaniemi some 170 km away, but the journey requires either an expensive taxi ride or at least three separate buses.

By train[edit]
Kolari is the northernmost train station in Finland. During the winter season there is a direct train connection daily from Helsinki via Tampere, Oulu and Tornio; at 995 km, this is the longest single train route in Finland. An overnight trip takes 13 hours and is most comfortable in a sleeping cabin. From Turku, you usually change trains in Tampere. Sometimes the train contains a special club car serving as a nightclub during the trip. A sleeper cabin for 3 passengers (in the old one-storey cars) costs around €200. You can also drive your car on board (fee from €39), which can be handy if you'd like to spare yourself a 1000-km drive in winter conditions.
From Kolari there is a Rundgren bus for the remaining 35 km. Tickets cost €13.80, the ride takes about an hour and stops at most major hotels.

By car[edit]
From Helsinki, drive by E75 to the north. Switch to E8 after Kemi. Drive to Kolari and follow signs to Ylläsjärvi (road 939). Alternatively you can come via Kittilä.
From Sweden there are bridges, e.g. at Haparanda/Tornio, Övertorneå/Ylitornio (Aavasaksa), Pello and Pajala/Kolari.

Get around[edit]
Ylläs is divided into four areas. There are two ski resort areas at the base of the lifts: the larger of the two, 67.550624.25671 Ski Resort Ylläsjärvi, is on the south-east side of the fell, while 67.580724.20342 Ski Resort Äkäslompolo is on the north-west side. The town of 67.6050224.1458483 Äkäslompolo ("Lake Äkäs", covered in its own article) is about 4 km north of the ski resort of the same name, while the smaller village of 67.5245924.301934 Ylläsjärvi ("Lake Ylläs") lies about 5 km south of its resort.
If you don't have your own wheels, the only practical way to get around is the Ski Bus, which loops between the four roughly hourly during the ski season. Single tickets are a steep €6, but if you buy a ski pass, you can top it up with an area ticket that gives unlimited rides for just €2/day.
Downhill skiers can use the Kuru lift to connect across the top of the fell between the Ylläs and Äkäslompolo resorts.  There's also an extensive network of cross-country trails, but while you can easily ski down from the resorts to the villages, it's a long uphill slog to get back.

See and Do[edit]
Winter sports[edit]
Gondolas at Ylläs
With 463 m of elevation difference and runs up to 3 km long, Ylläs Ski Resort is not exactly the Swiss Alps, but there are still 63 slopes and 28 lifts to explore. Thanks to the rounded shape of the mountain, most runs are quite easy and the resort is known for being family friendly. The network of ski tracks around the fells there is the largest in Finland (330 km).  While there is one gondola (on the Ylläs side) and one chairlift (on the Äkäslompolo side), all other lifts are slow T-bars.  All higher lifts are subject to closure in windy weather.  Day pass rates including use of all lifts start from €48.
Both resorts maintain snow parks for freestyle snowboarding. These parks contain various sizes of jumps (kickers) for beginners and pros. There are also a good selection of jibbing rails (especially on the south side, i.e. Ylläsjärvi). However, half-pipes are usually absent. There's also excellent cross-country skiing, with 330 km of maintained trails connecting to the tracks of Pallas-Yllästunturi National Park.
The slopes are usually opened sometimes in November and the season runs until May. In summer, Ylläs turns into a mountain biking park, with gondolas ferrying bikers up, and trails up to 4 km long.

Buy[edit]
The only grocery in the ski resorts is Antin Mini-Market in the Hotel Saaga building, which is also the only place that sells takeaway alcohol (beer and other drinks under 5.5% ABV only), but has a very limited selection of food.  For larger shopping sprees, use your own wheels or the Ski Bus to go shop in the villages, or order online from 67.605224.15471 Jounin kauppa  in Äkäslompolo.

 Gifts. For instance trinkets of the local Wood Jewel brand, you can buy them in any souvenir shop in Kolari, Ylläs or Levi. 
Lakkalikööri, a signature Lappish cloudberry liqueur, from Äkäslompolo Alko store.
Cloudberry jam or sauce, from any retail store.
Eat[edit]
Breakfast is usually included for visitors staying in the hotels.  In the resort area, the only budget options are self-catering (see #Buy) or ubiquitous Finnish fast food outlet Hesburger.

Drink[edit]
Ylläs markets itself as a family-friendly resort and the après-ski scene here is much quieter than at party town Levi.

 Taiga Pub & Kitchen. This cavernous pub next to the gondola station wins no awards for ambience, but serves up decent reindeer kebabs and burgers, and plenty of Lapin Kulta (Lapland's Gold) beer to wash it down with. (updated May 2022)
Sleep[edit]
The Ylläs area is one of the largest winter sport resorts in Finland and it has a great variety of accommodation opportunities.  Äkäslompolo, covered separately, has the largest range on offer ranging from hostel dorms to luxury lodges.
