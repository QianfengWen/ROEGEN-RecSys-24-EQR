Kuldiga[dead link] (Kuldīga) is a picturesque town on the Venta River in the Kurzeme region (formerly Courland) of western Latvia. Its old town was listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2023.


Understand[edit]
Ventspils Street on a foggy morning
With the smaller Alekšupīte River running through its old town centre, it is known as "The Latvian Venice". Indeed the river flows alongside the walls of many of the town’s houses. Like Ventspils, Kuldīga's streets are all made of various kinds of cobblestone.
Local authorities aim to make the old town of Kuldiga an important international tourism destination, to attract domestic and foreign tourists and contribute to the sustainable development of the town. The tourism resources of the town are based on its historical and cultural heritage and the Venta River which is one of the largest and most picturesque rivers of Latvia. 
The historic and architectural heritage of Kuldiga is well preserved. In the park near the Kuldiga district museum fragments of the stone wall and the cellar of the first Kuldiga castle, built in 1242 by German knights, have been preserved. Later Duke Jacob’s castle (ruined in 1701) was situated there as well. Today it is a sculpture park. The old brick bridge across the Venta, built in 1874, is one of the longest of its type in Europe.
The Old Town Hall was built in the 17th century. The cellar of the building was the first prison in Kuldiga. The oldest wooden building in Courland was built in 1670 near the Town square on the banks of the River Alekšupīte.
The town square was an old assembly place for people. Traditional cultural heritage is part of everyday life in Kuldiga with textile workshops and celebrations of national festivals. There are also more contemporary events such as the annual running competition on the Alekšupīte (River of Aleksis) and the ‘naked people run’ over the historical bridge on the Venta River at Midsummer night.

Get in[edit]
There are several daily buses, taking 2-3 hours from capital Riga and frequent bus connections from nearby Ventspils and Talsi. Check 1188.lv for details.

Get around[edit]
Most of Kuldīga's attractions are within walking distance.
Only the sand caves are 4-5 km north of the Ventas River bridge. You might want to try hitch-hiking there, but people can be hesitant to take you along the way, because it is mostly families and couple going there. Alternatively, take a local taxi, which usually are available near bus station ("Maxima" or "Rimi" supermarkets)

It was built in 1874 according to 19th century standards – 500 feet long and 26 feet wide, allowing two carriages to pass each other. It consisted of seven spans of brick vaults. Two of the spans were blown up during World War I, and rebuilt in concrete, rather than brick, in 1926.  
56.9682321.979174 Venta Rapid (Ventas rumba), ☏ +371 63322259, tourinfo@kuldiga.lv. This 240-m-wide waterfall is the widest in Europe. It is easily viewed from the brick bridge, 200 m downstream. Its 2 m height is not impressive when viewed from the bridge – you need to get down on the river bank to appreciate its height. The naturally formed waterfall is an obstacle for spawning fish in the spring and is associated with a number of legends and historic events. In medieval times, due to Duke Jacob’s invented devices for catching jumping fish in the air (on the waterfall) Kuldiga was considered the place "where salmon were caught in the air". Flying fish shows (salmon jumping up over the waterfall) attract visitors to the town in spring time. If you visit Kuldiga in summer, take a swim in waterfall and get a "free massage" under the waterfall as many locals do!   
56.9688421.972055 Alekšupīte River. This small tributary of the Venta runs through the old town, right alongside the walls of many buildings, which is why Kuldīga has been called the Venice of Latvia. The buildings of the town centre were constructed as a suburb to Kuldīga Castle. In 1701, during the Great Northern War, the Swedish army invaded Kuldīga Castle and in 1709 it became uninhabitable, but in the 19th-century the castle ruins were relocated.

The longest underground cave labyrinth in the Baltics (about 2 km – 460 m can be toured). In the beginning, the sand was sold as washing sand and for cemetery purposes. During Duke Jacob’s reign the white quartz sand from the caves was taken by ships to Riga and abroad for glass production. The quartz sand is very clean and pure. The caves are protected by a clay layer above from rain water and such. Also, the cave structure is stable due to the dolmen layers atop. The site is in good order, there is a parking and some attractions for kids. Tourists walk with guides (the older lady is spiritual and entertaining). A tour into the 16 m underground lying caves, takes about 15-30 min, depending on the number of people, through the narrow cave passages, sometimes in cowering position. Unfortunately, the funny lady the cave is advertised with does not work anymore. €6 per person.  (updated Mar 2019)
