Whangaroa is in the Far Far North of Northland in New Zealand.


Understand[edit]
Waitapu Bay and the outskirts of Whangaroa from St Paul's Rock
Whangaroa's history goes back to Maori settlement, a mission station, kauri gum digging, and a prodigious boom time when kauri logs were brought from the surrounding hills in enormous quantities, settlements and mills flourished, and busy shipbuilding yards operated around the harbour. Between 1850 and 1909 these shipyards produced over 100 ships – schooners, brigantines and ketches – which sailed the high seas and ended up in all corners of the globe.
Those days are past, but unspoilt beauty remains to delight the traveller. The harbour itself is the jewel in a crown of beautiful bays that encircle Whangaroa's coastline. There are still substantial areas of native bush within the district. The small townships and settlements keep their sense of history, and some of their original buildings remain to carry whispers of the past into the 21st century. Whangaroa remains a magnet for the game fisherman. Pristine white sand beaches and clear water create an ideal getaway in summer time for holiday makers. Whangaroa community website[dead link]
