Pichilemu[dead link] is a holiday town with beaches in Central Chile, south of Valparaíso. Pichilemu is a crossbreed of a sleepy fishing village and an international surf destination. Pichilemu is not quite on the Gringo Trail, but visitors from Chile and abroad quickly take to this rapidly growing town. 


Understand[edit]
Agustin Ross Balcony
Getting around is really easy, the people are friendly, the prices are reasonable, the beaches are big and easily accessible, and every year there are more interesting restaurants with varied cuisine. Due to it being the #1 surfing destination in Chile there is a delightful mix of international visitors and Chilean tourists. There is not much by way of luxury accommodation, a few high-end places, several mid-range and lots of not-so-nice but cheap places (especially outside of Jan and Feb).

Get in[edit]
Pichilemu is 3½ hours by bus from the Terminal Alameda in Santiago, or 2 hours by bus from San Fernando.
Make sure to take the bus via Melipilla from Santiago, it's much shorter than the San Fernando/Santa Cruz Route.
Getting to Pichilemu by car is fairly easy and faster than the bus.
