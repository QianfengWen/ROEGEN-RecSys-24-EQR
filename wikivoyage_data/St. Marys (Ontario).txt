St. Marys is a town of 7,300 people in Southwestern Ontario,  between Stratford and London.  It is known as the "stone town" for its large number of limestone buildings. 


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
The first settlers arrived at the junction of the Thames River and Trout Creek, southwest of Stratford in the early 1840s, attracted by the area's natural resources. At the new town site, the Thames River cascaded over a series of limestone ledges, providing the power to run the first pioneer mills and giving the community an early nickname: Little Falls.
The arrival of the Grand Trunk Railway in the late 1850s increased the growth; the community became a centre for milling, grain-trading and the manufacture of agriculture-related products. 
In the riverbed and along the banks, limestone was close to the surface and could be quarried for building materials. Many 19th-century limestone structures survive: churches, commercial blocks, and private homes. They have given St. Marys its nickname: Stonetown.
