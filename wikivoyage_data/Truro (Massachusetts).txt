Truro is a town in Massachusetts on Cape Cod and includes the village of North Truro. Truro has great unspoiled natural beauty and beaches with high sandy cliffs on the ocean side. Cape Cod Light (sometimes called Highland Light) is the oldest lighthouse on Cape Cod. One of the joys in Truro is exploring all the back roads, discovering small beaches and quaint properties.
