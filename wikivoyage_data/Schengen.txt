Schengen is a village of 4,800 people (2018) in far south-eastern Luxembourg near the tripoint where the borders of Germany, France, and Luxembourg meet.  Schengen is known because the Schengen Agreement, which abolished passport controls between most EU members, was signed here in 1985.


Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Schengen is located along highway A13, which connects to the Land of the Red Rocks and Mondorf-les-Bains. After the border crossing into Germany, it becomes Autobahn 8, connecting to Saarbrücken and Saarlouis. When travelling from Luxembourg City, use the E29 heading for Remich. Just before the bridge over the Moselle into Germany, a sign will direct you to take a right turn onto the Route National 10. Schengen will be on the signs from this point on, though reaching it is as simple as following the road.

By public transit[edit]
From City of Luxembourg, it's possible to reach Schengen by public transport in just under an hour. Catch Bus 175 towards Remich and disembark at "Mondorf - Christophorus". From that stop, it is possible to catch the connecting Bus 185 towards Remich which stops in Schengen. The buses are timed to connect, with a transfer time of 5 minutes, although the latter bus will wait if the former is running late. Bus 185 runs hourly throughout the week.
The train station of Perl, which is the German town on the other end of the river Moselle, connects to Koblenz, Trier and Wittlich, as well as Nennig (for Remich), Wellen (for Grevenmacher) and Oberbillig, from which you can walk a few minutes, take a ferry, take the train one stop south and end up in Mertert.

By boat[edit]
Schengen shares a harbour with Remich, 49.51026.36391 Port de Schwebsange, which is in between the towns, near Schwebsange. Prices per day are €10 for boats up to 6 m in length, €12.50 for 6-8 m, €14.50 for 8-10 m, €16 for 10-12 m, after which every additional meter is €2 more expensive. Electricity costs €2.50 per day. Check-in is possible after 14:00, check-out must be before 11:00.

By plane[edit]
The nearest airport is the Luxembourg airport (LUX IATA), 31 km by road. Other possible airport to use include Hahn airport (120 km) and Frankfurt airport (220 km).
