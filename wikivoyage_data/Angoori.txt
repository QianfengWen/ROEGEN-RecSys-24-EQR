Angoori
Angoori is a beautiful isolated village in the foothills of Himalayas, about 18 miles north-east of Islamabad.


Get in[edit]

You have to park your car at the entrance of the village because only a small cemented road goes into Angoori, but the village is small enough to cover on foot.

Get around[edit]
Easily covered by foot. You can hike on the beautiful mountains. Forests are pretty safe.
