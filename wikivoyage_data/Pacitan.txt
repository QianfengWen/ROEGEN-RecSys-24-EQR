Understand[edit]
History[edit]
The name Pacitan comes from the word "Pace" or noni fruit in Javanese which can give health and strength as written in the book Babad Tanah Pacitan. Based on the legend of the Mangkubumen war or the Palihan Nagari War (1746–1755), when Prince Mangkubumi (son of Amangkurat IV, king of Kasunanan Kartasura) fought against the VOC and fled to the Pacitan area. During his escape into the forest, Prince Mangkubumi's body was very weak, and thanks to the help of his servant named Setraketipa who gave him ripe noni fruit, Mangkubumi's strength was able to recover. So that after being healthy Mangkubumi succeeded in seizing and gaining power in the western part of Kartasura and later became the first king in the Yogyakarta Sultanate with the title Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwana I in 1755 (based on the Giyanti agreement). Because of his services, Setraketipa was later appointed Tumenggung or regent in Pacitan in 1757 with the title Raden Tumenggung Setrowidjojo I.
