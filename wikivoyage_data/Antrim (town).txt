Antrim (Irish: Aontroim, "lone ridge") is the historic county town of County Antrim in Northern Ireland; these counties have been abolished so since 2015 it's been within the Borough of Antrim and Newtownabbey. It's 22 miles northwest of Belfast and is a commuter town for the city, with a population in 2011 of 23,375. For many visitors it's the place they arrive but don't stop to explore, as the International Airport is here. But it has several historic sites, a pleasant setting on Lough Neagh, and is a good base for visiting around the lough and further north. There's tourist information at the airport but the town TIC is in the Old Courthouse, open M-F 8:30AM-5PM.

See[edit]
54.722-6.2311 Antrim Castle Gardens, off High St. F-M W 9:30AM-5PM, Tu Th 9:30AM-9:30PM. The castle was built in the 17th century, rebuilt in 1813, burnt down in 1922, and the ruins were cleared away in the 1970s. The buildings that remain illustrate its late Georgian concept of Tudor-Gothic: there's an Italianate stair tower, a Barbican gatehouse and a stable block - this has been renamed Clotworthy House and now hosts weddings, conferences and the like. The chief attraction is the 17th century Anglo-Dutch water gardens, restored 2011-15. The main entrance is from Randalstown Rd to the north, but from town centre it's easier to enter through the Barbican from High St. Limited parking here, use one of the other town car parks. Free.   (updated Jan 2021)
The Courthouse or Market House, built in 1726, is at the head of High St by the Barbican. It now houses the TIC and theatre.
54.724-6.2092 The Round Tower or "Steeple" is to the north on Steeple Rd. It's a well-preserved example from the 10th century, 92 ft / 28 m tall with a conical cap; such towers were church belfries but nothing remains of the church / monastery. A Celtic cross is carved over the tower doorway (no entry, it's 2.5 m above ground level and barred by a metal grille). Nearby is the "Witches Stone" and two bullauns - stones with hollows that collected rainwater, of supposed healing properties.
54.729-6.2173 Springfarm Rath was a fortified farmstead circa 1000 AD, with earthworks and palisades. You'll have to use your imagination with this one, just a grassy platform with trees hemmed in by The Meadows housing estate. From Stiles Way B518, turn onto Fort Green (perhaps a clue?) then follow The Meadow: look for the layby and little footbridge to your left.
54.732-6.274 Shane's Castle, Castle Rd BT41 4ND (3 miles west of town), ☏ +44 28 9442 8216. The first castle of 1345 was called Eden-duff-carrick; it was replaced in the 17th-century Plantation era. This second castle grew and grew, and was still incomplete when it burnt down in 1816. That's the shell that you see today. The grounds are a working farm plus event space - society wedding or steam traction rally, take your pick - and not otherwise open. But it was a location for Game of Thrones so it's on the circuit for GoT tours.   (updated Jan 2021)
World of Owls is in Randalstown Forest two miles west of Shane's Castle. There are also public bird hides on the lough shore.
54.586-6.3035 Ram's Island is the largest island on Lough Neagh, about a mile long by a quarter mile wide, and a mile out from the eastern lake shore. There's the ruins of a monastery with a Round Tower, and of a 19th-century summer house. Boat trips from Antrim may visit, and in summer there's a ferry from Sandy Bay Marina.
54.706-6.0956 Templetown Mausoleum was built in 1789 in neo-classical style by Robert Adam. It's within the grounds of Castle Upton, which isn't open to the public.
54.701-6.0437 Patterson's Spade Mill off A6 Antrim Road is a water-powered mill for making spades and shovels, still in working order and maintained by the National Trust.
