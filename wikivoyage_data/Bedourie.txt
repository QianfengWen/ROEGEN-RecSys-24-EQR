 Bedourie Camp Oven. If you've heard of a Bedourie oven, which is an Aussie adaptation of the camp oven, the history of it is that drovers working on Bedourie Station, in western Queensland, found that the heavy cast iron camp ovens they used for cooking would often break as a result of falling from their pack horses and the Bedourie oven was developed in response to this problem.
