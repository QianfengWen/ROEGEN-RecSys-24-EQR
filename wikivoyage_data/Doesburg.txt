The Waag in Doesburg
Doesburg is one of the seven Hanseatic cities along the river IJssel. It is located in the Dutch province of Gelderland.


Understand[edit]
Doesburg town hall
Doesburg received its city rights in 1237, one year after the nearby city of Doetinchem received its city rights. Its location by the merging point of the Oude IJssel and IJssel rivers made it a strategical city. Doesburg used to be the economic capital of the Doesburg Quarter, a sub-region of the Zutphen Quarter. The Martinichurch is one of the remains of the former wealth. The silting of the Oude IJssel in the fifteenth century, which blocked the access to the cities along the Oude IJssel, limited Doesburg its wealth due to a lack of trade.
Nowadays the city still has many old buildings. The banks of the city are being modernised, but the city centre is still mostly intact.
