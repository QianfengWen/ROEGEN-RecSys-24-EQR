Maydena is perhaps the Derwent Valley's most forgotten town. Granted, on the outside, it may seem nothing more than a stopover town in decline, but the little-known Tasmanian town of 198 (2021) is home to Australia's first pedal railway.


Understand[edit]
Get in[edit]
Maydena is only accessible by car. It, like many other destinations in the Derwent Valley, are only accessible via the Gordon River Road (B61) from New Norfolk. From Hobart, it's a 75–90-minute drive, while it's a 45-minute drive from New Norfolk. From Mount Field National Park (including the nearby settlement of National Park), it's a 12-minute drive west.
In the rare case you're visiting Maydena from the east, the town is a 60-minute drive from Strathgordon (≈72 km), and a 70-minute drive from Scotts Peak Dam (≈66 km).
