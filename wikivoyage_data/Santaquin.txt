See[edit]
Santaquin Chieftain Museum housed in the old Central School
 Santaquin Chieftain Museum, 95 W 100 S St, ☏ +1 801 754-3910. By appointment only. Probably the most outstanding local museum you've ever seen: It's filled to the brim with pioneer relics and other more recent memorabilia and daily items chronicling the history of Santaquin. Well-crafted exhibits and displays, including a replica of a mine. The museum is housed in the old elementary school next to the DUP pioneer cabins. Unfortunately, the museum is open only by appointment (don't believe the website) due to poor visitorship, but it's definitely worth calling to see this hidden gem! Free.
