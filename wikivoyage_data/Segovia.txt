View of Segovia from the Alcázar.
Segovia is a town of 52,000 people (2018) in Castile and Leon. The city is famous for its historic buildings including three main landmarks: its midtown Roman aqueduct, its cathedral (one of the last ones to be built in Europe following a Gothic style), and the castle, which served as one of the templates for Walt Disney's Cinderella Castle. The city centre of Segovia was declared a  UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985.


Understand[edit]
The economy of Segovia revolves around metallurgy, agriculture, furniture, construction and, particularly, tourism. The town plays host to thousands of day-visitors from Madrid each year due to its popular attractions.

Get around[edit]
Map of Segovia
The walled Old Town is easily accessible on foot. Most of it is pedestrianised, and no traffic passes beneath the Aqueduct, which thus divides the city. At the foot of the Aqueduct east side in Plaza Artilleria is an underground parking lot (€2/hr). Bus 9 starts from here to make a circuit of Old Town, daily every 30 min from 11:00 to 19:30, fare €1. West side in Plaza del Azoguejo is a Tourist Information Centre, with another in Plaza Mayor.

See[edit]
Segovia Aqueduct, looking into Plaza del Azoguejo
40.948-4.11771 Aqueduct. It was built to supply water to the Roman fort and settlement here, probably around 100 AD. It used to gather water from Rio Frio, in the mountains 17 km south, flowing to the south edge of town to be stored and filtered. From there it turns and makes its spectacular leap across the valley, 28.5 m above Plazas Artilleria & del Azoguejo, to enter the Old Town. You can't walk on the structure, the best vantage point is at the head of the stairway into Old Town at Postigo del Consuelo. It's often floodlit at night.   
The easiest way into the walled Old Town from Plaza del Azoguejo is to walk up Calle Cervantes. Halfway up, note Casa de los Picos ("The House of the Points"), a 15th-century mansion with a facade studded with granite pyramids.
