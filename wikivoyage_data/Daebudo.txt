Daebudo (대부도) is an island that is part of Ansan city in the province of Gyeonggi, South Korea.


Understand[edit]
Daebudo is known as 'the Hawaii of Ansan'. The northern tip of the island is connected to the Ansan mainland by the Sihwa seawall, which has a road running along it. However, Daebudo still has the romance and lyricism of an island in various places.
Built for the Sihwa Lake reclamation project, the Sihwa Seawall (north), ballistic Seawall (south), and two seawalls are connected to the land, so the entry itself is convenient. Even if you don't have a car, you can go to Ansan Station and Oido Station by train and transfer to the bus bound for Daebudo Island, and the integrated fare in the Seoul metropolitan area is applied, so you can get there cheaply. The largest of the two seawalls, the Northern Embankment, was a one-lane round-trip road in the late 1990s, and the speed limit was low, making it very inconvenient compared to now. It was formal, but until the 90s, there were military checkpoints, so every time they passed, they had to be checked by soldiers. In 2002, the expansion work was carried out, and now the road has been greatly expanded, and the speed limit has been considerably eased, but the traffic of the southern seawall is still inconvenient. You can go to Seonjae-do and Yeongheung-do under the jurisdiction of Ongjin-gun through Seonjae Bridge. The Bangamori Dockyard, which is located as soon as it enters Daebudo Island by taking the Sihwa Seawall Road, also operates passenger ships to the island area under Ongjin-gun, which in fact serves as an assistant to the coastal pier.
In the 2010s, a rest area, a park, and an observatory were built in the middle of the Northern Embankment road, and it became a tourist attraction.
