History[edit]
Hankensbüttel historically belongs to the group of Büttel towns. The first mention comes from a document by Emperor Heinrich III from the year 1051, in which the place is mentioned as "Honengesbuthele". At that time, the Billunger family, followers of the emperors of the Holy Roman Empire, ruled the region. Located on important army and trade routes, there was a rapid development. As early as the 11th century, Hankensbüttel was the centre of an extensive parish and the seat of the episcopal court of the Diocese of Hildesheim.
During the Thirty Years' War, Hankensbüttel was in the marching area of ​​the fighting troops, at times the church was misused as an army camp and stable. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the place lived through the eventful history of the Hanoverian manor house. During the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), Hankensbüttel was under French rule, then part of the Kingdom of Westphalia (1807–1813), and from 1866 it belonged to Prussia.
