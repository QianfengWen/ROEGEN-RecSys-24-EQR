View of Guanajuato
Guanajuato is a city in the Bajio region of central Mexico and is the capital city of the state bearing the same name.  It is 390 km (about 250 miles) northwest of Mexico City. The name of the city means "Place of Frogs" in the local indigenous language and therefore the frog is the city's official pet.
Guanajuato is a beautiful mountain colonial town. Many tourists and locals consider this city to be the most beautiful in Mexico. It used to be a major silver mining town, and many of the mines are still active. The city is built on very hilly ground, so virtually every point in the city is on a slant. The city has a network of underground tunnels that serve as roads making this place unique in the world. In 2020, it was home to 195,000 people. 


Understand[edit]
Unlike other Mexican cities that have an exact date of foundation, Guanajuato was the result of miner camping sites after silver veins were discovered between 1540 and 1558 and that eventually lead to a larger settlement. In 1558 a big silver vein was discovered in Guanajuato and produced nearly a third of all silver in the world by the next 250 years. The city was granted its city status in 1741 by Spanish King Philip V. Mining brought wealth to this town that spread towards its architecture and lifestyle.

The major airport for Guanajuato state serving Guanajuato, Irapuato, Leon, San Miguel de Allende and Silao. If booking a ticket or researching the fare on an airline or an aggregate site be sure to look for "Leon" or "Leon/Bajio" instead of "Guanajuato" as you will not find it under "Guanajuato".   
Most flights offered are domestic, with limited international services to and from the U.S. Scheduled flights are available with:

Aeromexico & Aeromexico Connect Mexico City, Atlanta
American Airlines Dallas Ft Worth.
Mexicana Mexico City–AIFA
United/United Express Houston

Alternatively if you're flying from Europe, Canada, Caribbean or South America you can fly through Mexico City located 319 km to the southeast and take a bus or a flight from there. Primera Plus operates direct buses from Mexico City's airport to Queretaro where passengers transfer to another bus to continue to Guanajuato City or to San Miguel de Allende.
Public transport to downtown Guanajuato from the Airport
As of January 2024, there are no buses from the airport itself to Guanajuato city, only to Leon. You can take a bus into Leon, then catch another one to Guanajuato, but this is rather indirect. There's a ticket window and waiting room in a small building just outside of the airport terminal, which you'll see to your right when you exit into the parking lot.
Alternatively you can take other buses passing by the highway which may be cheaper but are slower:
Step 1: exit the airport, cross the large parking lot and exit through the front gate, here you will see a huge highway about 200 meters ahead and several ramps. Just keep to the right and walk to the large highway running parallel to the airport. Once there turn right and start walking along the highway for about 200 meters more, until you reach a green colored pedestrian overpass. Cross the overpass and about 50 meters in front of the stairs as you go down, there is a purple-colored little unmarked bus stop. Wait here for the bus going to "Silao".
Step 2: catch the local bus to Silao (M$8-10). It will take you to Silao bus station in about 10 minutes.
Step 3: At the Silao bus station buy a ticket to Guanajuato on Primera Plus (M$29 (pesos). That bus will take you to Guanajuato bus station in about 20-30 minutes.
Step 4: The bus station is 7 km from downtown. Exit the terminal and catch the local bus to Guanajuato Center for M$7 (Dec 2021). This bus will go through many tunnels and you will have no idea where to get off unless you ask someone. They will drop you off in a tunnel near an exit and you will need to walk a bit to downtown from there. This trip could take anywhere from 15-30 minutes depending on traffic. Enjoy the trip!
Taking a taxi or rideshare to Guanajuato from the Airport
As of January 2024, Uber and Didi drivers are not allowed to pick up from the airport, and this is enforced by the police - you may find that some will risk it, but don't be surprised if they soon get pulled over and ordered to take you back. Regular taxis are booked at a window inside the arrivals area of the airport terminal - expect to pay M$500-600 for a ride into the historic center of Guanajuato.

By bus[edit]

Tunnels[edit]
Entrance to the street tunnel near Hidalgo Market
Tunnel
One of the unique features of the city is its extensive tunnel network. The first tunnels were constructed during the Spanish colonial period to for flood control, with additional tunnels built in the late 1800s. After dam construction was completed in the 1960s, many tunnels were converted to roadways to speed up car traffic. The last tunnel to be built was around 1990. The tunnels are an integral part of Guanajuato's transportation infrastructure, increasing the carrying capacity of the city's street network while reducing traffic on city streets. Using the tunnels is unavoidable if you spend any time at all exploring the city. 
City buses run along the tunnels and is safe to take them, embarking and disembarking at designated underground stops. Taxis and ubers will also stop to let you off in the tunnels, expecting that you will use the designated walkways and stairways to pop up on the surface at your destination. 
Walking in the tunnels near Centro (downtown) is safe, though it can be a bit unnerving for visitors unused to such a system. Most locals use the tunnels as shortcuts when convenient, but generally prefer walking on surface streets. Guanajuato has a large number of pedestrian-only surface streets, made possible by shifting vehicular traffic below the surface. 
If you're driving, take into account that the tunnels are one way only, so taking the wrong tunnel may result in making a big tour around all the city. Occasionally, a tunnel will be closed for an underground street festival (such as during the Cervantino festival).
Tunnels include:

El Barretero - Runs west-east, southeast of the city and connecting the neighborhood near Presa de la Olla.
La Galereña - Runs north-south, south of the city and is an exit of the city.
El Minero - Runs east-west, in Centro.
Tunel Noroeste Ponciano Aguilar - Runs east to west, northeast of the city.
Tunel de los Angeles - Runs west to east, south of the city and is an exit of the city.
Santa Fe - Runs east to west, northwest of the city.
Miguel Hidalgo - The longest of all tunnels. Runs west to east, across the city.
Tamazuca - The only two-way tunnel and the shortest also. Runs north to south and vice versa, west of the city.
By foot[edit]
Guanajuato is not very big and you can walk to most places, so a car is really not necessary.

By bus[edit]
Public bus (urbano)
Buses, called urbanos, are operated by the Sistema Coordinado de Transporte de Guanajuato, and run from 07:00-22:00 daily for a flat rate of M$7 (Dec 2021) for a single ride without transfer. You pay to the driver when entering the bus and you get change. There is no public transport card.
You can join the local buses only at bus stops. In this article in the 'Get In' section on the map you see the bus stops. In OsmAnd or Mapy.cz you see the bus stops and the direction of the one way street. Google maps and many similar apps show tunnels as city streets. If you can't find a street that your app says is there, look for a nearby stairway heading into the tunnels.
There is no schedule or route map; destinations are marked or painted on the windshield. In general buses heading from east to west travel above ground along Avenida Benito Juarez, while buses heading in the opposite direction travel underground in Túnel Miguel Hidalgo. The stairways descending from the street lead to underground bus stops and are safe to use.

By e-hailing[edit]
Didi and Cabify are not available and Uber covers the city with a few cars (Dec 2021).

By taxi[edit]
A taxi to any destination within central Guanajuato should cost about M$50 (Dec 2021). Taxis do not use meters and the price should be confirmed first.

By tourist trolley[edit]
A trolley-like bus makes sightseeing tours of the city departing from Plaza de la Paz in the Centro, next to the Basilica of our Lady of Guanajuato. The rides lasts 1½ hours. There is a tour guide in Spanish only. It's a great way to get to know the city. . Expect to pay 100-150 Pesos. 

By car[edit]
Driving a car is not the best way to get to know Guanajuato; however, if you plan to get in and out of the city then you will need to use the underground roads or tunnels. Make sure to park your car in your hotel, as most offer free shuttles to the city; otherwise, park your car in a lot (estacionamiento).

Procession during Semana Santa
Festival Medieval de Guanajuato
 Semana Santa (Holy Week). The week preceding Easter, usually March or April. Easter is considered to be the most important religious holiday here, and commences with celebrations honoring Viernes de Dolores (Our Lady of Sorrows) on the final Friday of Lent. During the following week special altars are built and displayed in churches, public plazas, and in shops and homes.

Drink[edit]
Bar Fly
Craft beer with a view at The Beer Company
The nightlife is very active in Guanajuato, especially on weekends. Look for people passing out flyers during the day for drink specials and sometimes free drink coupons. If you walk around the city center, you'll find plenty to do – music spills out of the bars and clubs into the streets and many establishments have outdoor areas.
To start the night off, stop by one of the little cafes in the Jardín, for dinner and drinks and mariachi band ambiance. It is a great place to people watch. And definitely try Sol – a popular Mexican beer similar to Corona.

There is reggae music as well as lamp shades made out of solo cups. A definite must-see. If you are young and female, the staff will flirt unabashedly, but they're harmless and worth getting to know. If they know you are in Mexico to learn Spanish (whether you tell them or your teacher does) they won't speak English to you at all. (updated Feb 2023)
21.01601-101.253213 Cantina La Botellita, Jardín de la Unión 2, ☏ +52 473 732 2566. Known for having giant, delicious margaritas and good food. They also do 2 for 1 drinks on Tuesdays, but if you're a girl, or at least with a girl, you pretty much get 2 for 1 drinks all the time.

21.01788-101.250658 La Casa Azul, Callejón de Carcamanes 57 (150-m / 5-min walk from city center), ☏ +52 473 731 2288. Beautiful hotel with charming rooms at much lower prices than the tourist traps in the city center. Wonderful views and fantastic gardens, a really romantic place to stay but also family-friendly. Comfortable beds, plenty of hot water, and nice furnishings. Friendly staff who are happy to chat and give suggestions in Spanish, but they speak only very limited English. Fine with very late check-ins, but if you go earlier, they'll let you pick your room. Pool and TVs in rooms, but no food. It is, in fact, a blue house, and locals will be able to give you directions. They're fine with (or perhaps oblivious to?) gay/lesbian couples and unmarried hetero couples staying together.

Stay safe[edit]
Guanajuato is a really safe city – police are always around, and people are very friendly to tourists. Most of the city is safe during daylight hours, and as long as you stay in the downtown area, walking around alone or in small groups at night is safe as well. (Anyplace you'd want to go out at night is downtown.) The rougher neighborhoods are on the slopes of the eastern side of the city, as well as in the vicinity of the Pípila monument. Generally the city is far safer than the average American college campus and doesn't have much crime directed at tourists.
There is however one caveat: do not ever go running or walking around the Panorámica (the beautiful road around the edge of the city in the mountains) in the evening or early mornings. Many rapes, assaults, and muggings of foreigners have occurred in this area and some of the victims were out running with friends. Groups of men may be OK, but even several women together will not be safe. It is, however, safe to run in the city in the early mornings and there are a number of gyms where you can pay by the class. (Several of the foreign exchange programs have apartments on or near the Panorámica and those houses often have large parties. In the populated areas it's fine at all hours, but since it's a loop with a nice view of the city, many foreigners decide to run around it at dawn and parts of it are much more isolated.)
