Raseborg was created in 2009 by consolidating the municipalities of Ekenäs, Karis and Pohja, reaching from the archipelago west of the Hanko peninsula (Hangö udd, Hankoniemi) to that east of it, into a single one. The majority (66%) of the population speaks Swedish. A medieval castle of Raseborg located in the former municipality Snappertuna gives name to the new municipality.

It has a pretty old town consisting of narrow streets of wooden houses. Ekenäs guest marina is large for the size of the town and known for its beauty and good location adjacent to city centre.

Fiskars Corporation, the oldest functioning Finnish company, was founded around the Fiskars ironworks in the 17th century. It has places to stay and dine around the year if you can afford to splurge. There are things to see – and to buy. 
59.82666723.5683338 Jussarö (Jussaari). The only Finnish ghost town, 18 km south of Ekenäs, off the coast. Guest marina by the Hanko–Helsinki leg. A water bus service to Jussarö is available from Baggö Marina, Baggövägen 1275 (12.5 km south of Ekenäs by road, using the Skåldö road ferry). 
Get in[edit]
The municipality is at the base of the Hanko Peninsula, south of Salo, which is on the Helsinki–Turku highway (Highway 1, E18), south-west of Lohja, likewise on that highway, and north of Hanko. The municipality includes most of the archipelago east of the peninsula, bordering that of Ingå, and some to the west, bordering that of Kimitoön and Salo. The towns are on the mainland; even Bromarv and Padva are nowadays connected to it.
The historic King's Road between Turku and Vyborg via Helsinki) does pass through Raseborg. 

By car[edit]
Karis, about 80 km west from Helsinki, can be reached by road 51 from the capital via Ingå. After another 20 km along road 25 from Lohja towards Hanko you will arrive in Ekenäs.
From Turku you can come via E18: turn to road 52 towards Ekenäs in Salo. For Karis, turn from road 52 to road 111 near Tenala and drive via Pojo. For Bromarv, drive south-west from Tenala. The distance from Turku to Ekenäs is about 115 km.

By train[edit]
Karis is a railway junction, on the Kustbanan railway between Helsinki and Turku and on the railways from Hanko and Hyvinkää (no passenger trains from Hyvinkää, though). See VR
From time to time some of Helsinki's commuter trains have extended to Karis. There has been a political pressure to restart those services and a regional service via Karis to Hanko is planned, but as of March 2024 you mostly need to take the bus if coming from Kirkkonummi or Siuntio (or backtrack to Leppävaara in Espoo, where all long-distance trains stop).

By bus[edit]
There are some coaches from Helsinki, Lohja and Hanko, some going all the way to Bromarv. See Matkahuolto.

By boat[edit]
The fairways between Helsinki and the Archipelago Sea pass through the archipelago of Ekenäs. Pojo is in the narrow bay stretching inland from Ekenäs. Tenala and Bromarv are archipelago municipalities north of the Hanko peninsula. Karis is inland. The guest harbour of Ekenäs is popular.

Get around[edit]
0°0′0″N 0°0′0″EMap of Raseborg

Karis and Ekenäs are connected by rail and bus. Some of the coach services from the east continue from Karis to Bromarv. From Karis you can also take the regular 20 minute bus service to Fiskars around the year. Each place is small enough to be explored on foot comfortably.
The centre of Karis is opposite (north of) the train station. A tunnel leads to platforms 3–6, with one end at the railway station (with the station building nowadays a pub), the other at the "travel centre" consisting of a few bus platforms (and a taxi stand?). Behind the travel centre is the town centre; Köpmansgatan, which is the shopping street, starts slightly to the left, the supermarkets are to the right, where also the bridge over the railways lead.
For a walk in a residential area of Karis, with villas and gardens, the Svartån river and Pumpviken park, walk half a kilometre east (to the right) from the centre, e.g. along Centralgatan or Högbergsgatan. The ridge behind the station is Lojoåsen (Lohjanharju), part of the Salpausselkä terminal moraine left by the Ice Age, separating the Finnish Lakeland from the Gulf of Finland and continuing as the Hanko peninsula to the south-west.

By bus[edit]
Bosse is the name of Raseborg's local transport. The Bosse route planner can be used for bus trips.

By bike[edit]
There is a cycleway between Karis and Ekenäs.
Raseborg has Donkey Republic bike sharing bikes at six stations: in Ekenäs at the railway station, the marina and either Novia (during school terms) or restaurant Knipan (in summer); in Karis at the travel centre (the bus platforms opposite the railway station); and in Billnäs and Fiskars. Using the bike requires an app, which allows using such bikes also in several other towns in Finland and abroad (the company is Danish).
