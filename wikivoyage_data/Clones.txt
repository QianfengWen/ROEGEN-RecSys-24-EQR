Clones (say "KLOH-niss") is a town in County Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland, with a population of 1680 in 2016. It's in the north of the country, very close to the border with Northern Ireland which here twists and turns in unusual ways. Cluain Eois means "Eos' meadow" and "cluain" or clon- particularly indicates a dry place, a precious commodity hereabouts. It was virtually an island in the bog until the area was drained in the 19th century.

Get around[edit]
54°10′48″N 7°13′48″WMap of Clones
The town is small and easy to walk around. But frankly it won't occupy you for long, and you need wheels to explore the wider county.
Check your documents! Even a short excursion may carry you across the border into the United Kingdom. Then back to the Republic then back to the UK and so on - Drummully on N54 is the best example of the higgledy-piggledy border but other lanes north also criss-cross. The border (as of 2021) is unpatrolled but it's your responsibility to check that your personal and car documents are valid for both sides.

See[edit]
54.179-7.2321 The Diamond is the town's main square, over the site of the abbey. What remains of the abbey are a richly-carved 10th century High Cross, a 9th century Round Tower (originally over 30 m tall but truncated to 22 m), and a sturdy carved sarcophagus supposedly holding St Tiernach himself.
Clones Arts Centre at The Diamond is closed in early 2021.
Sacred Heart Church (RC) north side of town was completed in 1895.
Ulster Canal south side of town closed in 1931 and is just an overgrown gully. Work is under way to re-open it, perhaps by 2024: County Monaghan#See tells the story.
54.148-7.3152 Drummully "Polyp" is a pene-exclave, a tract of the Republic that can only be reached by crossing Northern Ireland or by wading across the river. County Monaghan#Understand gives the background.

Gaelic games: Monaghan GAA play Gaelic football and hurling at St Tiernach's Park, on Roslea Terrace 500 m north of town centre. With a capacity of 32,000 this is Ulster's principal GAA stadium (Casement Park in Belfast is derelict) so inter-province fixtures are played here.

Cassandra Hand Centre[dead link] on Abbey Lane puts on community events and may be able to help with local ancestry research.

Fast food: there are pizza, Chinese and kebab places along the main strip.
Eat other people: Alexander Pearce (1790-1824) the cannibal was born around Clones. In 1819 he was convicted of petty theft, transported to Tasmania (as it became), escaped, was re-captured and sent to Macquarie Harbour penal settlement on  Sarah Island off Tasmania's west coast. While working on the harbour, Pearce and seven others escaped by stealing a yacht. But they had no food, and 15 days into the escape they began killing and eating each other. Pearce alone survived to reach farmland and joined a gang of sheep thieves, who were caught and Pearce was sent back to Macquarie Harbour. Within a year he escaped again, with another convict who he soon gobbled up, and he was still carrying some flesh when re-captured. "Man’s flesh is delicious. It tastes far better than fish or pork" were his last words before being hanged.
