The compact Front Beach in the city centre, with Mount Tương Kỳ (colloquially "Big Mountain") in the backdrop
Vung Tau (Vũng Tàu) is a city in Southern Vietnam, about 125 km from Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon). Its nearness to Saigon and its beauty and fresh air makes it a very popular destination for weekends.


Understand[edit]
Vung Tau is the economic centre of Bà Rịa - Vũng Tàu, a province in southeastern Vietnam. The city centre, located on the southern tip of the peninsula, has been long known as a tourist haven for businesspeople from Ho Chi Minh City.

Geography and climate[edit]
Vung Tau sits on a peninsula separated from the mainland by a river. Much of the city is flat and easy to commute by bicycles/motorcycles or on foot.
The city features long coastlines and a savanna climate pattern with two seasons:

Dry season (Nov-Apr): consistently hot and dry, though cooler during the year-end months and the Tết Holiday (Jan-Mar). Ideal for hiking
Rainy season (May-Oct): lots of rain, usually in the afternoon. Gets very hot and humid during daytime. Ideal for seaside frolics.
Vung Tau has two main beaches for tourists. The first, Front Beach, is a compact beach with calm waters located in a small bay in the southern tip of the peninsula. The second, Back Beach, has long stretches of sand and relatively violent – but safe for swimming – waters, located on the city's eastern side. The city is scattered with several smaller beaches, though they are dangerous for swimming and drowning is frequent.
Vung Tau features two mountains in the backdrop: Mount Tương Kỳ and Mount Tao Phùng, both popular for hiking. The two mountains are colloquially known as núi Lớn ("Big Mountain") and núi Nhỏ ("Small Mountain"), because of their visible sizes. On the hiking trail to the top of the Big Mountain are numerous Buddhist pagodas and a Vietnamese Zen (thiền) Monastery. On top of the Small Mountain is a 32-metre (105 ft) statue of Christ the King, built from 1974 to 1994.

History[edit]
During the 14th and 15th centuries, European trading ships regularly visited the waters of this area for shelter because of its calm waters, which inspired the name "Vũng Tàu" (literally "anchorage"). During the Nguyễn Dynasty, Vũng Tàu was officially Tam Thắng (literally "Three Boats"). The Portuguese named the then-small fishing town after the Catholic Saint Jacques.

Bạch Dinh ("White Palace", 1898–1902), weekend getaway for political elites during French rule and the American War
With the onset of French colonisation, Vung Tau was a battleground where the Nguyễn Dynasty fired at French battleships with cannons from mountaintop fortresses; the cannons still exist on the hiking trails today. After the French invaded Vietnam in the 19th century, Vung Tau was known as Cape Saint-Jacques, shortened to Cape. The Vietnamese then colloquially called the city "Ô Cấp", based on the French pronunciation of "au Cape" (literally "to the Cape", used by French people in Saigon referring to their weekend getaways in Vung Tau).
Under French rule, Vung Tau became a popular seaside getaway for officials and the elites. The last Emperor of the Nguyễn Dynasty, Bảo Đại, often retreated to the hillside French colonial mansion Bạch Dinh (Villa Blanche, literally "White Palace", now a popular tourist destination) while on holiday. The French built many public buildings, a Catholic church, and tree-lined avenues; all are well preserved and still intact to this day.
During the American War (called the Vietnam War outside the country), Vung Tau was home to the Australian Army and American support units. Its popularity as a seaside resort continued. After the war, Vung Tau was a common launching place for boat people fleeing the communists. In the 1980s, the joint Vietnamese-Soviet enterprise for oil and gas exploration Vietsovpetro established, leading to an influx of Soviet (mainly Russian) migrants. In 1991, Vung Tau officially became a city.
Waves of immigration have turned the northern part into an industrial zone with many ports and oil industry services, and the southern tip remains an attractive weekend getaway. Because of Russian immigration, an ethnic Russian cluster was established, with Soviet-era architecture apartments and many Russian shops and eateries.

Economy and society[edit]
Thích Ca Phật Đài, a Buddhist pagoda
Historically a port city, Vung Tau is a major centre of Vietnam's modern offshore oil industry. State-controlled oil and gas enterprises attract many high-skilled engineers and technicians. After privatisation in 1986, Vung Tau has welcomed many private corporations in ship building, oil services, and logistics. As a result, Vung Tau's middle-class population is generally well-educated and well-mannered, though the lower-class population consisting of immigrants from rural areas does exist. Contrary to North American cities, the suburban area is home to the lower-middle class immigrants and working population. The middle- and upper-middle class population mostly settle in the city centre located at the southern edge of the peninsula, close to the beaches and tourist spots.
As of 2021, Vung Tau is home to 420,000 people. As a result of Russian immigration, there is a sizeable Russian minority living in a designated area colloquially called Khu Năm Tầng ("Five-Storied Area"), because of the area's array of five-storied apartment buildings in Soviet architecture. There is also a significant Australian community, mainly elderly, drawn to the area after serving in the Battle of Long Tan 35 km to the north of Vung Tau. In vibrant downtown, foreign cultural influences are visible through Japanese, Korean, and Russian shops and eateries. An expat community has contributed to the city's hippie-ish neighbourhoods with Italian, Mexican, American, and Indian influences.
Although the population is generally irreligious, Vung Tau is religiously tolerant and there are many religious buildings catering mostly to Buddhist and Catholics along with other religious minorities such as Protestants and Cao Đài. Two of the city's iconic spots are the Statue of Christ the King and Thích Ca Phật Đài, highlighting the religious diversity of the population.

Get in[edit]
By road[edit]
Vũng Tàu is connected to the mainland by Hwy 51 (Quốc lộ 51), which runs from Biên Hòa City. The shortest route from Ho Chi Minh city is through HCMC–Long Thành–Dầu Giây Highway, exit at Long Thành and join Highway 51.

By bus[edit]
Vung Tau–HCMC connections (Dec 2023)
10.35065107.086711 Vũng Tàu Bus Station. Bus times HCMC see picture. (updated Dec 2023)
At least hourly buses run between Vung Tau and HCMC throughout the day 04:00–19:30; 110–200,000 dong, ca. 2 hr.
Otherwise, Vung Tau is well connected to Southern Vietnam and the Mekong Delta by bus, with 60-80 bus connections daily in addition to HCMC. There exist 4 daily connection with Phan Thiet (for Mui Ne) in each direction.
The full list of bus schedules and prices can be found next to the bus station administration desk.

By car[edit]
From HCMC, the best route is similar to coach/bus mentioned above. Use HCMC–Long Thành–Dầu Giây Highway, turn right at Long Thành exit and go straight on Highway 51 to reach Vũng Tàu. It takes roughly 2 hours from District 1, HCMC, to Vũng Tàu, depends on drivers and/or traffic. On public holidays or weekends, the roads usually become busier.
Drivers need to remember to follow speed limit as traffic police may present anytime, check speed and give fine. 120 km/h is limit on HCMC–Long Thành–Dầu Giây Highway. On Highway 51, drivers can reach 90 km/h on most of the way outside crowded area. In some crowded towns, it is limited to 60 km/h and prompted by big blue information signs on roadside. There are several other certain limits described by other signs infrequently.
There are 3 toll booths on the way from HCMC to Vũng Tàu. One is on HCMC–Long Thành–Dầu Giây Highway and another two are on Highway 51. At the first booth, fare for up-to-9-seat car is 40,000 dong. At the second and third booths, you pay 20,000 dong for the one you reach first and give receipt to the rest, no more charge.

By motorbike or bicycle[edit]
As motorbikes and bicycles are forbidden from HCMC–Long Thành–Dầu Giây Highway, the best way for drivers/riders is using Cát Lái ferry.
After crossing the river, follow the main road to get through Nhơn Trạch district, then join Highway 51, turn right and go straight.
The road quality is acceptable for driving/riding. Just make sure you are on proper lane and watch out for pedestrians especially at busy intersections, where people cross the road irregularly at times. Except HCMC–Long Thành–Dầu Giây Highway, there are many coffee shops, restaurants, gas stations for drivers/riders to take a break. Make sure you know the price before settle down.

By plane[edit]
10.370278107.0933332 Vung Tau Airport (VTG  IATA). It used to serve Con Dao twice weekly. Otherwise, there are no national or international flights, but helicopter flights.   (updated Dec 2023)
By boat[edit]
"Tàu cánh ngầm" aka "Hydrofoil fast ferry" in Vietnam is a quick way to get to and from Vũng Tàu. Taking the hydrofoil is a good way to see the commercial maritime areas as the boat runs through the Saigon River to the sea. After 1¼ hr Vũng Tàu peninsula appears with its two mountains (conveniently called "Big Mountain" and "Little Mountain") at the waterfront. This is a little more comfortable way to get to Vung Tau rather than taking the bus. Booking at least one day in advance in recommended, especially at the weekend.
The ferry departs at Bach Dang Pier in Saigon, District 1. Not far from the Majestic Hotel (100 m). Lands in Cầu Đá Port, Ben Cau Da, Ha Long St, Vung Tau.
At least the following company serves Vung Tau (but verify!):

 Greenlines, Hàm Nghi Road, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City. 2 hr 620,000 dong return. (updated Dec 2023)
Get around[edit]

Bãi Sau (Back Beach)
By taxi[edit]
As an ordinary Vietnam urban area, Vũng Tàu has plenty of taxis and xe ôm (taxi motorbike) drivers who are professional. The taxis fare is similar to Hồ Chí Minh city. Remember to always agree on a price before setting off. Also your accommodation can help you organise a ride.
But for foreigners, the best option is to use Grab due to the language barrier and to avoid "misunderstandings" about price, etc.

By motorbike[edit]
Motorbike rental service can be found in most of hotels or hostels, especially at back beach. Expect arund 120,000 dong for manual and 200,000 dong for automatic. Make sure you have valid driving license and helmets.

By bicycle[edit]
Vũng Tàu should be one of the best places in Việt Nam where you can enjoy riding a bike, thanks to low traffic density and picturesque coastal roads. Bicycle rental service is not too abundant but can be found in some hostel at Back Beach. 
The best cycling route is along the coast, through Thùy Vân st, Hạ Long st, Quang Trung st and Trần Phú st. With this way, slow pace to breath sea breeze or speedy race are up to you, as road quality is quite nice. If you prefer off-road, some paths up to Small/Big Mountains are good way of practising.
Wearing helmet is not mandatory yet recommended. And do not forget to watch out at any intersection as other drivers tend to not give way to biker.

On foot[edit]
Vũng Tàu is rather small, so you can walk most places. Recommended ways are: Ba Cu street (the city's centre), Đồ Chiểu street (food centre), Trưng Trắc and Trưng Nhị Square, Công viên Bãi trước (Front Beach park) and pavements along the coastline. Pedestrians should watch out before crossing roads as drivers usually do not give way, like in most of Vietnamese cities.

Built by the French (1898-1916) as a summer holiday house for French Governor-General Paul Doumer. Also formerly known as Dinh Toàn Quyền (Villa du Gouverneur). Under French rule, the mansion was a holiday getaway for French governors and Bảo Đại, the last Emperor of Vietnam. During the American War, the mansion was used for R&R.

10.32639107.084444 Statue of Christ the King (Tượng chúa Ki-tô Vua) (summit of Small Mountain). A must-do with panoramic view! The enormous 28-m figure of Jesus gazing to sea with outstretched arms is at the south end of Small Mountain. Built in 1971, this giant Jesus rests on a 10-m-high platform. The interior of the statue is hollow and contains a spiral staircase of 129 steps, ascending from the foot of the statue to its neck. The two shoulders of the figure are balconies, each able to accommodate up to 4 people, which offer a splendid view of the surrounding landscape. This is the largest sculpture in southern Vietnam. A pathway makes the 30-min hike up the mountain pleasant, and the panoramic view from various vista points along the way is magnificent.   (updated Dec 2023)
 Pagodas (Small Mount summit). Niết Bàn Tịnh Xá and Thích Ca Phật Đài are most popular among the pagodas and temples in Vũng Tàu.

The Vũng Tàu Lighthouse projects light as far as 65 km (35 mi) and is equipped with telescopes to follow and direct ships at sea. Next to the platform, 4 old French cannons (weighing several tons) were once used to defend the area from naval attacks. The lighthouse affords a panoramic view of the whole of Vung Tau. 4,000 dong.

The emphasis is in British and Australian regimental uniforms but there are also Samurai, Mongols, Saracens, Turks and Bulgarians as well as most European and North American armies. There is a wide range of guns, swords and other weapons of war. Quite why Bob Taylor chose to open his museum in the relative obscurity of Vung Tau is not clear from the collection but if you have even a passing interest in military history it is well worth a couple of hours of your time if you find yourself in the city. 100,000 dong for foreigners.

Beaches[edit]
The seaside makes Vung Tau a nearby paradise for Saigon visitors. Well-travelled foreigners may be underwhelmed.

There are four beaches near the city center:

10.36874107.06163 Bãi Dâu (Mulberry Beach). Small beach on the west side of Big Mount.

Eat[edit]
Banh Khot
What[edit]
Bánh Khọt – Vung Tau's signature meal. It is a breakfast meal with rice cakes filled with seafood (squid, shrimp) or egg and lots of greens into which you roll the rice cakes and then dip them into a sweet and salty sauce. Bánh Khọt starts at 45,000 dong, but often goes for 60,000 dong — a little steep when you compare it to the 5 pieces of Bánh Căn for 25–40,000 in Nha Trang, which is pretty much the same.
Hủ Tiếu Mực – Squid noodles, around 50,000 dong.
Bánh Cánh Ghe – Grab noodles, around 50,000 dong.
Lẩu – Meaning hot pot, is very popular in Vung Tau, but often only makes sense in a larger group due to the price and amount. Hot pot is a must at every Vietnamese party.
You will also be able to find Bò Kho, Bánh Xèo, or just Phở.
Meals in Vung Tau are generally more expensive than in the rest of the country — you won't find many meals below 40,000 dong (as of 2023). This is also due to the city being a petroleum center and due to focus on seafood dishes.

Stay healthy[edit]
Sand flies on beach can be a problem and cause allergic reaction on your legs. If you experience this, just use anti-mosquito spray all over your legs before you enter the beach, it will minimise amount of bites you will have. Note that you might not immediately notice the sand flies at the beach, but you will definitely wonder where you got all those "mosquito" bites from the next day — so be prepared.
