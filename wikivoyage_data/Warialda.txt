Warialda Visitors Information Centre (and coach stop)
The name of the village comes from the Weraerai Aboriginal word for 'Place of the Wild Honey'. The European explorer Allan Cunningham passed through the district in 1827. Settlement of the site began in 1837, with a Border Police outpost established in 1840. Warialda was the main centre of the old Yallaroi Shire from 1906 until its merger with the Bingara Shire in 2004. Mixed farming is the main industry of the district. Warialda is in the Gwydir Shire Local Government Area.
