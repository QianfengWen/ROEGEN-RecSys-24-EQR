Eindhoven is a major city in the province of North Brabant in the Netherlands. With a population of over 230,000 people (2019), it's the fifth-largest city of the Netherlands. It is by no means a main tourist destination in the country and most travel guides will devote no more than a page or two to it. Nevertheless, this bustling and modern city has a lot more to offer. 
Eindhoven's history is dominated by industrial development and is inextricably linked to electronics giant Philips and, to a lesser degree, DAF Trucks. Although those industries have mostly disappeared, Eindhoven remains a European technology hub, hosting a technical university and many technology companies and cooperation initiatives. In addition, over the past decade the city has become the capital of Dutch design.


Understand[edit]
Eindhoven City Centre, with the Light Tower and Witte Dame on the right, the Blob on the left and the Admirant tower in the back.
Until the beginning of the 20th century, Eindhoven was no more than a village. Less than a century later its number of inhabitants had boomed to over 200,000. The main reason for this tremendous increase in size was the establishment of electronics multinational Philips, which was founded as a light bulb manufacturing company in 1891 and was headquartered in Eindhoven until 1997. As Philips grew, the city of Eindhoven grew with it to feed the company's constantly growing need for workers. Philips' strong presence in the city gained it the title of "Lichtstad" (City of Light) and is still prominent today, as many of its former buildings are considered valuable industrial heritage and have been renovated. Frits Philips (1905–2005), who led the company for decades, was the city's main benefactor and was extremely popular among the people of Eindhoven. When walking the streets of Eindhoven today, you'll find his and other names associated with Philips everywhere. Parks, theatres, sports facilities and many streets are named in their honor.
Although Eindhoven is an old city, with town and market rights already awarded in 1232, little of this long history is visible when exploring its centre today. Large parts of the city were destroyed during air raids in World War II and post-war reconstruction was focused on ambitious, modernist plans with little respect for the historic heritage that was left. Nevertheless, there are 140 national heritage sites (Rijksmonumenten) in and directly around the city, including many 19th- and early 20th-century buildings and a handful of older ones.

History[edit]
Looks can be deceiving, when it comes to Eindhoven's history. Modern as the city is today, it is in fact one of the oldest towns in the Netherlands. Henry I, Duke of Brabant, already chartered the then little village of "Endehoven" in 1232, as part of his extensive town planning process. Eventually the town established itself as a trading stop between Holland and Liège. Its early industrial activities centred on tobacco and textiles.
The city was destroyed and rebuilt several times in its written history. Despite late 14th-century improvements to its fortifications and the establishment of a castle within the city walls in the 15th century, Eindhoven was plundered and burned by the Guelders in 1486. No more than 6 houses remained. Rebuilding took almost 20 years and left the town in poverty, with the fortifications being neglected. This resulted in another plundering in 1543. That same year, a fire ruined most of the city. During the Dutch Revolt, control of Eindhoven repeatedly alternated between the Dutch and Spanish, the city was burned down again, besieged for 3 months, and finally captured by Spanish troops in 1583. When the French armies took over the already weakened city some years later, large parts of it were destroyed yet again. In 1629, Eindhoven became part of the Netherlands for good, but its tumultuous history left it a damaged and minor city.
This would change with the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Due to the presence of Philips, DAF trucks and some other major industry, Eindhoven developed as a major player in the global technology and industrial design scene. It is considered to be the epicentre of Dutch design with such institutions as the Design Academy and the Dutch Design Week that takes place every October.

Eindhoven Airport is geared towards low-fare carriers
By plane[edit]
Eindhoven Airport[edit]
51.450565.374171 Eindhoven Airport (EIN  IATA), Luchthavenweg 25 (5 km (3.1 mi) outside the city), info@eindhovenairport.nl. Daily 04:30–00:00. It is the Netherland's second busiest airport by number of flights, behind only Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. Its terminal was greatly expanded in 2013 and has most of the facilities expected from a modern airport, including an on-site Tulip Inn hotel. Eindhoven Airport is mostly served by low-fare carriers Ryanair, Transavia and Wizzair, and by holiday charter specialists. The most flights are from destinations around the Mediterranean or Central and Eastern Europe.   (updated Aug 2019)
Eindhoven Airport is connected to the city and its main train station by means of two bus lines: 400 and 401, which alternate throughout the day and provide a 20-min ride between the airport and the train station approximately every 10 minutes at daytime. There is no bus service between midnight and 06:00. There are different prices depending on how you buy it. The ticket costs as of January 2024:

€2.74 for bus 401 or €3.12 for bus 400 if you check in and out inside the bus with your credit/debit card or with an NFC smartphone.

€5.35 if you buy a ticket from the ticket machine in the airport or at the airport bus station.
Regarding e-hailing, Uber and Bolt cover the airport. If you packed light, there are e-mopeds and e-bikes in front of the terminal provided by Go Sharing that you can take to the city.

Amsterdam Airport Schiphol[edit]
Schiphol Airport is the largest airport in the Netherlands and a major global hub with a vast array of short-haul and intercontinental connections.

NS runs every 15 minutes a Intercity train from the airport to Eindhoven train station for €23.30 and takes around 1½ hours. Twice per hour the train connection is direct to Eindhoven, twice per hour you need to change trains at Utrecht Centraal. This change in Utrecht is almost always cross platform. The cost of a train with a connection in Utrecht is the same, and the travel time is only around a few minutes longer. During disruptions or track maintenance it might be an option to change trains at Rotterdam Centraal. For the train between Schiphol and Rotterdam a surtax of €2.90 needs to be bought on top of the regular ticket Schiphol - Eindhoven, These trains connecting in Rotterdam do not have a cross platform interchange, take longer to Eindhoven, are less reliable and usually busier.
FlixBus runs a few times per day a long-distance bus between Schiphol and Eindhoven for €6-30 one way and takes around 3 hours.
KLM runs twice a day a KLM Bus service from Schiphol to Eindhoven Airport that can be booked together with the plane ticket. Eindhoven is selectable as origin and destination when booking a KLM flight under its airport code (EIN  IATA), with "flights" that KL316-319 are actually bus rides. There bus ride takes 1 hr 45 min. You cannot book the KLM bus by itself: you must take a flight with KLM to or from Schiphol to book a connecting bus ride to or from Eindhoven.
Other airports[edit]
Düsseldorf International, Düsseldorf Weeze, Maastricht Aachen Airport, Rotterdam The Hague Airport, Brussels Airport are all within 1½ hours by car from Eindhoven. Public transport from Eindhoven to those airports will take way more time and require multiple changes.  If you see this facade and Mr. Philips in front of it, and look for a bus to the airport, you are on the wrong side of the station.

Do[edit]
Eindhoven is perhaps the liveliest city in the South of the Netherlands. If you're willing to get informed, you'll find events are taking place at almost any given time. If you're flexible in planning, try to visit during one of the main events like GLOW or the Dutch Design Week. When you've had enough of the urban vibe, just head for one of the many natural areas around and see a whole different side of the Eindhoven region.

Dive into Eindhoven's industrial history. Walk by former industrial complexes in the centre, such as the Lichttoren (one of the cities main landmarks), the Admirant and the Witte Dame. Visit Philips' first Incandescent Lamp Factory of 1891, now a small museum. Just outside the centre you'll find Strijp-S, with the famous Klokgebouw (Clock building). The robust former factory buildings of this Philips area are now being transformed into the bustling creative heart of the city. An English bike route along the main Philips-sights is for available at the tourist information office for €2. To get an idea of that other major industry that has shaped the city, visit the DAF-truck museum.
Explore Eindhoven's historic heritage. Rent a bike at the train station and visit a selection of the 140 Rijksmonumenten (National Heritage Sites), also outside of the direct city centre. Or go back in time at the Historic OpenAir Museum, where you can experience life in Eindhoven during the Middle Ages and before.
If you're into design, try to visit the city during the Dutch Design Week. Check the website of the Design Academy for any upcoming events or their graduates exhibition around October. On Strijp-S you can visit the large shop, workshop and restaurant of world famous designer Piet Hein Eek.
The Genneper Parks recreation area provides ample opportunities to relax and enjoy nature, but also allow for an active day trip. The Milieu Education Center provides walking routes, including a GPS track through the park. There's a biological farm and shop, a cartoon museum, a restaurant with mini-golf options and several sports facilities. For example, take a dive in Zwemcentrum de Tongelreep, one of Europe's largest swimming centres.

Parks and gardens[edit]
Despite its industrial character, Eindhoven is the "greenest" of the five largest cities in the country. Even within the province of North-Brabant, it is the greenest of the top five cities there. The park and grass fields around Lake Karpendonck make a great place for a summer picnic. If you're up for a stroll, try the City Walking Park (Stadswandelpark), at walking distance from the centre and decorated with some 30 sculptures. Just south of the Stadswandelpark lie the larger Genneper Parks where nature and recreational activities come together (see above under "Do"). Within the Genneper Parks you'll find the Heempark Frater Simon Deltour, with example gardens showing original regional landscape types and natural habitat. The Philips van Lenneppark in the north of the city was named after Frits Philips' wife, whose maiden name was van Lennep. The family donated the park to the city for the 75 year anniversary of the Philips company. It houses a playground, skate park and petting zoo. Older is the Philips de Jonghpark just 1 km to the north between the Oirschotsedijk and the railway. This park was donated in 1920 by Anton Philips (the father of Frits) and his wife, whose maiden name was De Jongh. In the middle of the park is a pavilion for drinks and snacks.

Buy[edit]
Eindhoven is the regional centre for shopping, and offers a wide range of large and small stores, including all the large chains in the Netherlands and a good number of small speciality shops. As it is hardly a touristic city, traditional souvenirs are relatively hard to come by. The VVV tourist information office in the train station has some Dutch and Eindhoven oriented gadgets. Light bulb cartoons and similar images are a typical reference to Eindhoven's history in lightning. Also, museum shops will have some gift items relevant for their exhibitions.

Opening hours[edit]
With some exceptions, shops close at 18:00 on weekdays and 17:00 on Saturdays, like in the rest of the country. Friday is "buying-evening" in the city centre, with shops open until 21:00. Shops are now allowed to be open on Sunday and most of the shops in the city centre indeed open every Sunday from 12:00 to 17:00. Most places in shopping centre Woensel XL open only the first and last day Sunday of the month, and keep similar hours. You'll find that businesses in the other districts typically remain closed on Sundays, with the exception of bars and restaurants.

The Heuvel Galerie occupies a big portion of the city's centre
City centre[edit]

The street has a mix of large chains like Selexyz, Dept, Douw Egberts, but also smaller design stores like Janissima temporary concept store, Onigiri Art on T-shirts and Van Bommel Shoes.

Hotel rooms are abundantly available in the city, mainly serving an international business crowd visiting the many technology initiatives. With the exception of major soccer matches in the PSV stadium, Eindhoven rarely runs out of places to stay. Most accommodation is offered by large chains in the city centre and doesn't come cheap. Listed minimum prices can be significantly higher when the cheaper rooms are all taken, so check actual prices on the hotel or booking websites. Prices are often lower in the weekends. In many cases, €3.50 tourist tax and breakfast are not yet included.
If you're on a budget, check out the bed & breakfasts. These are smaller places which are often cheaper than the hotels (some starting around €30) but many of them don't have a website. Alternatively, consider the villages surrounding the city where you will find some smaller hotels and campsites. The best place to start is at the VVV[dead link] (tourist info) office just outside Eindhoven Central Station or on their website.

Stay safe[edit]
Eindhoven, as with much of the Netherlands, is safe for the most part. However, up until the late 2000s, the city had the unfortunate reputation of being the country's "murder capital". Though an exaggerated moniker, it did highlight crime rates that were quite high by western European standards. Nowadays you should not have any problems if you know how to be street-smart. The Woensel section, in the north-northwest of the city, has been described as sketchy and seedy by locals and the media, but it has no touristic appeal.

Connect[edit]
Eindhoven has good 4G/5G coverage from all Dutch carriers. Wifi is widely available in public places.

Go next[edit]

In the South East Brabant region, to which Eindhoven belongs, there are a number of natural areas and parks with marked bicycle and hiking routes. Even to Belgium, which is only a stone's throw away.
