Get in[edit]
Tahoe Vista is located in North Lake Tahoe, CA. Just a few minutes to Northstar-at-Tahoe Ski Resort and the beach shores of all North Lake Tahoe. It's just a 15-to-20 minute drive to Squaw Valley, Alpine Meadows, Mount Rose, Paige Meadows and more. Endless acres of forested back-country for hiking, mountain biking, and snowmobiling. The North Shore's finest and most popular restaurants, shops and outdoor destinations are all right here. Reno is about a 30-minute drive over Mt.Rose on a nice day. There are many short term rental homes in the area that make it a wonderful place for year around fun.

Get around[edit]
Most people either drive to Lake Tahoe from the San Francisco Bay Area or fly into the Reno airport and rent a car.
