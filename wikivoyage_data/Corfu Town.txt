Understand[edit]
Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
39.60194519.9122221 Corfu International Airport (CFU  IATA) (2 km south of the town). The Corfu International Airport serves the whole island.   
This airport has countless flights from the rest of Europe, especially April–September. These include cheap carriers like Ryanair and Wizzair. If you know a budget airline airport, chances are high there are flights from there to Corfu.
If no flight is suitable, you may want to consider flying to nearby Preveza or Tirana. From Preveza you can check if there is a bus to Igoumenitsa, where a frequent ferry goes to Corfu Town. From Tirana buses depart to Sarandë, from where a ferry goes to Corfu Town. Conversely, Corfu is the gateway into Albania for many tourists, especially the Albanian Riviera. 
Getting there and away:

By bus – The town bus number 15 (Airport–Green Bus Station–Corfu Town–Port) does the trip regularly in season, but only until 21:00 October–March.
By taxi – From the airport you can take a taxi. Be aware that it is common practice that taxi drivers may merge two groups for a shared trip without confirmation. Taxis are equiped with taximeter but they may give you a fixed price way above normal prices when they identify you as a tourist. It is best to ask for the price or for the taxi meter before starting the drive.
By bus[edit]
Corfu Town is served at least by three KTEL Intercity Buses lines which connect daily the city with Athens, Thessaloniki, Larisa. The 39.6214819.91842 bus station is in Saroko (San Roko) Square.
