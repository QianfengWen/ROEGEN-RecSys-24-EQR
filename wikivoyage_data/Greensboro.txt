Greensboro is a city of almost 300,000 people (2020) in North Carolina. It is named after Nathanael Greene, a Patriot general who fought a battle here during the Revolutionary War. It's nicknamed the "Gate City" for its historical role as a transportation hub for the Piedmont. The famous author William Sydney Porter, better known as O. Henry, was born here.

Stay safe[edit]
Greensboro is a charming southern city but has its share of crime just like any other large area in the state. Common sense is your best friend; don't ever leave your car unlocked or with valuables visible. Walk in well-lit places at night, especially downtown. The South and East sides of the city are a bit rougher than the rest. Best to drive through if you don't have specific business there. When going to places late night on Gate City Blvd. , be aware of your surroundings--this is one of the areas that has seen the most increase in late-night crime.  Cops are everywhere and generally helpful but remember they are very serious about what they do.

Connect[edit]
The Greensboro Public Library has free Wi-Fi, and the 36.074861-79.786921 Central Library branch is conveniently located downtown. Computers with internet access are available too, but you need a library card or a guest pass (available if you show an out-of-state ID) to log on.
