Town letters for Melchor Múzquiz in the Plaza Principal
Melchor Múzquiz (usually known as Múzquiz) is a town in the Northern Mexico state of Coahuila. It is an interesting town with an indigenous population of Kickapoo and Seminole Indians who fled the United States in the mid 19th century. The area has also been the site of paleontological digs that discovered that the first residents of Múzquiz looked an awful lot like cast members from a Jurassic Park movie. The town is one of Mexico's designated Pueblos Mágicos.


Understand[edit]
By the early 18th century, Northern Mexico was a tough place for a Spanish settler to put down roots. The hot, arid climate was bad enough, but the westward expansion of the United States to the north was putting constant pressure on the indigenous Americans, many of whom fled further west and south into Mexican territory where they would often attack Spanish settlers trying to establish farms or mines in the region. 
In 1737 the Spanish established Santa Rosa María del Sacramento as a fort to protect the state of Coahuila y Tejas against indian incursions. The fort also served as a military prison. A town began to grow around the fort. The town was named Melchor Muzquiz in 1850.

Kickapoo building a traditional home in Melchor Muzquiz
In the 1830s, Texas revolted against the Mexican government and became a state of the U.S., though native indian incursions continued in Texas and across the states of northern Mexico. Also in the 1830s, the U.S. government instituted programs of genocide and forced removal of indigenous peoples from the eastern United States. A group of Seminole people who had interbred with African slaves feared slavery if they remained in the U.S. and so migrated to Melchor Muzquiz in Coahuila, where they established a new homeland. These people are known as the "Black Seminole" in the U.S. (where a population also has a reservation in Oklahoma) and in Melchor Muzquiz are called the Mascogos. In Melchor Muzquiz, the Seminole have an ejido adjacent to the Kickapoo lands.
In the early 19th century, the Kickapoo tribe occupied a wide swath of territory stretching across the midwest into Texas and Mexico. In 1850, the Mexican government granted an ejido (communal lands) to the Kickapoo. The Mexican Kickapoo tribe is closely associated with 3 Kickapoo tribes recognized by the U.S. government in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. The Kickapoo ejido is 17,000 acres on the former lands of the Hacienda de Nacimiento.
Today, the town of Melchor Muzquiz embraces its Kickapoo and Seminole communities and takes pride in local indigenous festivals and traditions.

Julio Galán was a famous modern/contemporary artist in Mexico who was particularly prolific from the 1980s until his sudden death in 2006 in a traffic accident while en route to Monterrey. Like many artists of recent decades, his work was often transitional and while some works felt surreal, others were described as neo-contemporary.
