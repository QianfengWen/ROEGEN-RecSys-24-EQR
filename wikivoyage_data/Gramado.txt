Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Gramado during the Christmas seasonGramado is served by two airports: Hugo Cantergiani Airport (CXJ IATA) in Caxias do Sul and Salgado Filho International Airport (POA IATA) in Porto Alegre. Since 2021, Azul Conecta has been operating daily flights between Porto Alegre to the small Canela Airport (CEL  IATA), in the neighbor city of Canela, which is also mainly used by private planes and air taxi operators.
Hugo Cantergiani Airport is a small airport serving Caxias do Sul and, it's some 60 km (37 mi) away from Gramado. CXJ has flights connecting only two destinations: Viracopos Airport (VCP IATA), in Campinas, operated by Azul, and São Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport (GRU IATA), in Guarulhos, operated by Gol. Because of that, CXJ tends to be more relaxed on baggage overweight. In general, flights to CXJ are cheaper than those flying to POA. Infrastructure for visitors is minimal.
Salgado Filho International Airport is the busiest airport in Rio Grande do Sul and southern Brazil. It's located 95.6 km (59.4 mi) southwest of Gramado. POA has a modern infrastructure, with a food court, stores, banks, etc. POA is connected to several Brazilian and South American cities. As POA has more commercial flights than CXJ and it is well served by bus to Gramado (some services also calling Porto Alegre International Airport), many Brazilian travelers simply fly to Porto Alegre and take a comfortable executive bus to Gramado.

By bus[edit]
Gramado is served by Citral, which has the franchise to explore intercity bus services in Gramado and Canela area. Most Citral buses on the route Gramado-Porto Alegre also call at POA airport (buy your ticket at arrival floor, on the bus ticket booth to the right of the Citral travel agency).
Gramado Bus Station is located on Avenida Borges de Medeiros and is close to many of the city's attractions. Taxis wait for passengers on the bus platform side, whereas Uber-like services wait near the pedestrian access.

By car[edit]
The main access route between Porto Alegre and Gramado is via the BR-116 and RS-373 highways. An alternative route that also connects Porto Alegre and Gramado are the RS-020 and RS-115 highways. This route has tolls on some stretches.
Carpooling offers on the Porto Alegre-Gramado route are frequent, and the most popular carpooling platform in the region is BlaBlaCar.

Get around[edit]
Map of Gramado
By car[edit]
Driving your own vehicle is the most effective way to visit attractions outside the city center, or going to the Parque do Caracol or the neighboring city of Canela. There are several car rental agencies around the city.

By bus[edit]
Public buses are operated by Gramado Turismo (Portuguese only). They are cheap , but meant for locals, not for visitors, and are hardly useful to visit tourist attractions. Information about public bus routes online is almost non-existent, although you may try to seek local for help if you are on a tight budget and has thus to seriously consider taking a public bus.
An alternative is to use the hop-on hop-off tourist bus service, provided by BusTour, which runs circular routes between Gramado and Canela, passes through several tourist spots, including the Parque do Caracol. As of Sep 2016, a day ticket costs R$ 49, and it can be conveniently purchased at your hotel, at the bus stop, or directly from the bus driver. The disadvantages of the hop-on hop-off bus are that it is rather unfrequent (30 to 55 minutes intervals) and it only runs during daytime.

On foot[edit]
The city center of Gramado, which contains many of the city's attractions, shopping and gastronomy, can be easily and it's better explored on foot. It's recommended to stay in a hotel in this area if you don't have your own vehicle.

Stay safe[edit]
As a relatively developed tourist city, Gramado is a safer city by the standards of most Brazilian cities. There are no cases of violent crimes against tourists and it is not dangerous to walk the streets alone at night. However, be careful anyway, use common sense and don't carry around with valuables or jewelry exposed in public, as this can attract the attention of pickpockets.

Go next[edit]
Canela - Go to great waterfall in Parque do Caracol (Snail Ecological Park) and the Parque da Ferradura (Horseshoe Ecological Park). The tourist-oriented city center is also quite enjoyable.
Nova Petrópolis - Small city populated by German descendants. Not as picturesque as Gramado, but more authentic
