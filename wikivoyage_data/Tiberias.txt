Tiberias (Hebrew Teveriyah טבריה) is a large resort town on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee in northern Israel.


Understand[edit]
Tiberias was founded as a Roman city sometime between 20 CE and 44 CE, and named for the emperor Tiberius. It became an important regional center, so much so that the Sea of Galilee was sometimes called the "Sea of Tiberias". During the 3rd century it became the center of Jewish scholarship in Israel, and the "Jerusalem Talmud" was in fact composed in Tiberias. From the 8th to 10th century, Tiberias was home to the Jewish Masoretes who recorded the definitive text, vowels, and pronunciation of the Bible which are used to this day. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Tiberias became an important center for Torah study again, and was regarded as one of the Jewish Four Holy Cities, along with Jerusalem, Hebron, and Safed.
Tiberias is now a small city focused on tourism. What most characterizes Tiberias is the lake, which presents its blue expanse from great viewpoints in the hills.

Afterwards a taxi to Afula is ₪40-50. Alternatively, you can take bus 52 from the roundabout after the border into Afula (₪7.40). And from Afula take another regular bus (30, 442, 541, 840) to Tiberias (≈₪10).

See[edit]
Tombs[edit]
Tomb of Rabbi Moshe Ben Maimon (Rambam)
32.7886335.5287491 Tomb of Rabbi Akiva. In the hilly upper neighborhood of Tiberias. It's about a 2-km uphill walk from the city center, so you may prefer to take local bus 6 instead, which runs every 20 minutes. 
32.78047835.5419192 Tomb of Rachel (close to the old cemetery). Not the Biblical Rachel. This Rachel is the wife of Rabbi Akiva, who is buried in a different part of town.  
32.7935.53723 Tomb of the Rambam (Maimonides). This revered rabbi, who died in 1204, was one of 12th-century Egypt's most highly regarded sages, while working as a doctor in the court of the Muslim ruler Saladin. Legend has it that before his death in Cairo, he instructed followers to load his remains onto a camel and bury him wherever the camel expired. The camel was apparently drawn to Tiberias. Next to the grave is the Maimonides Heritage Center museum. Also buried here is Rabban Yohanan Ben Zakkai, the leading rabbi at the time of the Roman destruction of Jerusalem. Ben Zakkai is said to have faked his own death, escaping the city hidden in a coffin, and then prophesizing that the Roman general Vespasian would become the new Caesar. When the prophecy came true, Ben Zakkai was granted one wish by the new leader; a Jewish learning centre for him and students.   
32.76621135.5498194 Tomb of Meir Ba'al Hanes. This 2nd-century rabbi, who helped to compile the Mishnah, is buried here. The tomb is marked by two synagogues: Sephardic (on the left with the white dome) and Ashkenazic (with the blue dome). In the courtyard of the Sephardic synagogue is a pillar topped by a large bowl, and four days before the Lag B'Omer holiday a bonfire is lit here on the Pesah Sheni (second Passover) holiday. Crowds of religious Jews visit throughout the year to pray, and it is a belief that God will answer the prayers of pilgrims with personal problems.  
Museums[edit]
 The Antiquities Museum. Housed in the Fishermen's Mosque, now under renovation. 
32.78668235.5383475 Dona Gracia Museum, HaPrachim 3, ☏ +972 4 672 8900. Dona Gracia Nasi was a wealthy 16th-century Jewish woman. In 1558, the Ottoman Empire granted her control of the Tiberias region in exchange for an increase in tax revenue. She began to rebuild the abandoned villages in the area, hoping that Jewish refugees would be able to settle there. However, she died not too long afterwards in 1569. She is seen as an early predecessor of the Zionist movement, and all the more notable because female leaders were rare at the time. This museum is dedicated to her story. There is also a hotel located next to the museum, if you need a place to stay. (updated Mar 2017)
Others[edit]
32.78770535.5408526 The Khan. This used to be Tiberias' central square, with a mosque at its centre. 
32.79017235.5407187 Tiberias Castle/Fortress (The Citadel). The Turkish citadel was the highest point in the old town. It now houses an art gallery.  
32.78822635.542538 St Peter's Church. Hidden along the northern promenade, it is worth looking out for the lovely Franciscan church built by 12th-century Crusaders. The Muslims converted it into a mosque, and you can make out an area of uneven stone on the southern wall filling in the hole where a mihrab (prayer niche indicating the direction of Mecca) was carved. Later, the Turks used the building as a caravanserai before it was rebuilt as a church in 1870.   
32.78898835.5415019 The Scottish Compound. This was a small Scottish colony during the 19th century. It now houses a boutique hotel and a church.   
32.78784535.54115910 Al-Amari Mosque. As out of place as a pin-stripe suited gent at a teenage rave, the dignified little mosque looks threatened and lost squeezed between some gaudy shops and a brusque concrete supermarket. Built by Daher al-Omar in the mid-18th century, the mosque is one of the very few buildings in Tiberias that predates 1948. It is generally held that its construction was partly paid for by the town's Jewish community, presumably grateful to the sheikh for being permitted to return.  
32.78096135.54311 Old Cemetery. With Jewish and Muslim sections.  
32.77361135.54416712 Roman theater (Khirbet Qasra Atabraa) (far south of the city). Contains ruins from the Roman (1st century) and Arab (11th century) periods, as well as a playground for kids.  
32.77282635.54621513 Berko Archaeological Park (far south of the city). Contains ruins from the Roman (1st century) and Arab (11th century) periods, as well as a playground for kids. 
Tiberias hot springs
32.76573335.55166514 Hamath Tiberias National Park. 8:00-16:00 (closes earlier in holidays). Israel's spa craze actually has a 2000-year-old history which started at the hot springs of Hammat Tiberias when, during Roman times, they were the focus, if not raison d'être, of a community of 40,000 fervent bathers. Check out the history of the site at the Hammat Tiberias National Park, which features a small museum in what was part of a Turkish bathhouse. The main highlight is a synagogue dating from the 3rd to 5th centuries AD, which has a beautiful zodiac mosaic floor. Much has been made of the mosaic's curious mix of Jewish and pagan symbols, but somehow this seems quite apt in Tiberias, a town that, historically, seems to have been able to reconcile the spiritual with the more earthly. The fame of Hammat Tiberias was such that in AD 110 the Emperor Trajan had a coin struck dedicated to the springs - with the image of Hygeia, the goddess of health, shown sitting on a rock, enjoying the water. The springs were also mentioned by Al-Idris, an Arab writer who lived during the Crusades, and were recommended by the Jewish sage Rambam to his patients. ₪14/12/7 Adult/Student/Child.  
32.7856435.5441715 Sea of Galilee fountain-statue. Showing water level and shape of the Sea of Galilee.
