Barraba (population 1,410 in 2016) is a village in the New England region in New South Wales, Australia.


Understand[edit]
Queen Street, Barraba's main street
Barraba is a historical village in the Nandewar Ranges. The district was explored in 1827 by Allan Cunningham, and the first farm in the district was established by 1838. The discovery of gold helped the village to grow from the 1850s. A railway ran to Barraba from 1908 to 1987. Barraba was a sheep and wheat district, but now beef cattle predominates. Copper and asbestos were mined in the district, and gemstones and fossils can be found. Barraba is in the Bundarra-Barraba Important Bird Area, which protects the habitat of the endangered regent honeyeater.
