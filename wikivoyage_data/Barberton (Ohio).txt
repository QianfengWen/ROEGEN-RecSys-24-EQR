Barberton is a city in Summit County.
In 1890, Akron industrialist Ohio C. Barber had an option on 550 acres of land in Norton on which he hoped to mine soda ash. When the soda ash venture fell through Mr. Barber, not wanting to give up his option on the land, saw the viability of developing his own planned community. Barberton was laid out around Ways Lake, which O. C. Barber renamed Lake Anna, after his only daughter, Anna Laura Barber.  By 1910 the population of Barberton was 9,400 and this again doubled by 1920 to 18,811 and by 1960 to 33,805. In 1990, the population was 27,623.
