Stortorget Ystad centre
Ystad is a small but charming city in Scania, or Skåne, part of southern Sweden. It is on the south coast of Scania and has good beaches west and east of the town. Its harbour is a meeting place of ship, train and bus connections.  It has a new marina and makes a great base for exploring the area, as well as Skåne.


Understand[edit]
The area was first settled in the 12th century, and the town has an attractive medieval centre, and its coastal position, facing Germany across the Baltic, means that it was closely associated with the Hanseatic League, which it joined in the 14th century. Until the 19th century, Ystad was one of Sweden's most important ports, but when the railway Södra Stambana was hauled to Malmö instead of Ystad, Ystad quickly lost its significance. On the other hand, this development meant that during a period when often old buildings from city centers were destroyed in the way of new ones, Ystad did not grow and this development did not gain momentum in the city. Therefore, there is still a large number of very old building stock in the center of Ystad, dating back to the Middle Ages. Ystad's cityscape with half-timbered houses and pleasant pedestrian streets is valued so that, for example, in 2017 the city was among the 20 candidates in the public vote for the most beautiful city in Sweden on the Arkitekturupproret blog.
Ystad hosts a number of festivals and has a decent art museum, plus a number of other museums and attractions. It is known internationally as the setting for many of the novels of Henning Mankell, featuring fictional Ystad police inspector Kurt Wallander (see Nordic Noir). There are regular Wallander tours in several languages, and even free showings of films in the main square (Stortorget).
The area around Ystad has a lot of farms, and many of them grow rapeseed. These flower around early May and last for a couple of weeks. Passers by will see a sea of bright yellow. There have been so many instances of tourists wandering into fields to take selfies with the magnificent  vistas that farmers have put up signs and fences to discourage this practice. But you can still get grand views as you drive or bike by. There is a coastal biking trail along the south coast of Sweden ("Sydkustleden" - translation "the south coast trail") that passes through Ystad and you can see these fields from it. If you are biking east from Ystad, a better option would be to first hit the beach. There, a small  unpaved gravel trail, runs along the top line of the beach and then later into woods. This continues for a few miles before it then swerves north a bit and merges into the Sydkustleden.
As in most small towns, as an English speaking traveler, you may encounter some friction when you find restaurant menus or other signs that are available only in Swedish. Google Lens can help to some degree. Obviously, an ever-helpful Swede who can translate would be best, but sometimes, even their knowledge can be stretched. Having them read out aloud into Google Translate ("Translate by Speech"), can sometimes get you past this.

Do[edit]
Walk through the old part of the city and enjoy the old half-timbered houses. In the evening eat and drink on the main square or shopping streets, and enjoy the comings and goings of the volunteer fire brigade in their antique vehicles.
Follow the Wallander trails - if you are a fan of the books or films there are many, many references as Mankell based his material on actual places and situations. If this is to be believed there seems to have been a murder or gruesome incident on almost every corner of the town. In reality the police are hardly ever seen, except when parking up to collect a burger order from the stall on St Knuts Torg, near to the excellent Tourist Information office within the Art Museum.
During summer, enjoy a walk by the beach (east of the town). Stop by and grab a beer or ice cream at "Fritidsbaren" and get a good view of the ocean.
North of the town is a beautiful lake and forest area. Several national parks are found within a short drive.
Every other year, Ystad hosts a tattoo, a must-see if you are interested in music. See the website for more information.
Ystad is the perfect base for exploring south Scania; there's a wealth of places to visit, something for everyone, and the Tourist Information in town is very helpful.
Bike along the Sydkustleden which runs along the south coast of Sweden, through many small towns and through the Swedish countryside. This trail runs pretty close to the coast in most places. Its not uncommon for Swedish bikers to not wear helmets, as they have a lot of (perhaps justified) faith in Swedish drivers. So you may have to explicitly ask for helmets if you are renting.
