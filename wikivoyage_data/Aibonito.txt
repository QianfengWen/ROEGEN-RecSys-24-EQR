Aibonito is a small mountain town and municipality of Puerto Rico located in the Cordillera Central, the central mountain range of the island. Aibonito is most famous for its relatively cold temperatures, its flower industry and yearly festival, its food and its beautiful nature.


Understand[edit]
Aibonito is located in the Sierra de Cayey, a subrange of the Cordillera Central. At 2,400 feet (731 m) in elevation, Aibonito's main town square is the highest in Puerto Rico. The San Cristobal Canyon, one of the largest and deepest canyons in the Caribbean, separates Aibonito from Barranquitas in the north. The area was originally settled by the Taino people, and  the town's name comes from the Taino word "Jatibon" (from Jatibonicu, the name of the local tribe), meaning "black river" or "high river" (similar to Haiti's name origin). A local legend says the name comes from a Spanish settler who exclaimed "ay que bonito!" ("oh, how pretty!") at the natural scenery in the area.

By car[edit]
Aibonito is connected to Cayey in the east through road PR-14, to Coamo in the west also through PR-14, and to Cidra in the east through PR-173. The Carretera Central and PR-1 also connect the municipality to Cayey in the east and Salinas in the south, although the road itself does not lead to the Pueblo (downtown).

Get around[edit]
Map of Aibonito
As with most towns in Puerto Rico, Aibonito is very car-centric and driving is the easiest way to get around.
A word of caution: if driving you are sharing the road with trucks, and locals. The mountain roads have steep descents and ascents, hairpin turns, and steep cliff drops are not always protected by railing. The roads may look like one-lane highways but are made to handle two-lane traffic.
