Cianjur is a city in the Bogor Raya region of Western Java, Indonesia.


Understand[edit]
Cianjur is a city with a population of about 170,000 (2020). The city is located in the valley, about halfway between the Puncak mountain pass and the provincial capital city Bandung. Cianjur is the capital of the regency of Cianjur, which stretches from the border of the Greater Jakarta metropolitan area in the north to the Indian Ocean coast in the south.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Cianjur railway station, served by only three trains per day.
Cianjur is along Indonesia's National Road 3, also known as the Southern Java route. The city is about 30 km northeast of Sukabumi, and 45 km west of the Cipularang toll road with quick connections to Bandung and Cikampek. Traditionally, Cianjur was on the main road from Jakarta to Bandung (the Great Post Road via the Puncak pass). However, since toll roads have been built most people don't drive via Cianjur anymore. In good traffic conditions, to go from Jakarta to Cianjur is still the quickest via the Puncak pass. However, especially on weekends when traffic is seriously congested it may be quicker to take the detour via the toll road (via Cikampek).

By bus[edit]
Cianjur's main intercity bus terminal is -6.80311107.17461 Rawabango bus terminal on the eastern side of the city. However, many of the buses do not call at the terminal, but simply drop and pick up passengers in front of the terminal, along the main road (the road from Cianjur in the direction of Bandung).
During daytime, there are regular buses to Cianjur from Jakarta's Kampung Rambutan bus terminal (East Jakarta). The price of a one-way ticket is Rp25,000 (with airconditioning) and the journey takes about 3 hours if traffic conditions are good. Cianjur is also served frequently by economy class buses on the route from the port of Merak to Bandung, and there are very frequent (during daytime at least 6 per hour) buses of various classes from Bandung via Cianjur to Sukabumi.
The small shuttle buses of Siliwangi Trans also cover the route Bandung-Cianjur-Sukabumi, leaving Bandung every 2 hours from 05:00 to 19:00, with an additional bus at 21:00 on Fridays and Saturdays. In Bandung, shuttle buses depart from the Balubur Town Square shopping centre in North Bandung (☏ +62 22 844 68 648).

By train[edit]
-6.82458107.1427282 Cianjur railway station is in the city centre, but is served by a very limited number of trains. The only train service is three daily trains to and from Sukabumi (about 1hr 30min, economy class only). In Sukabumi you can transfer to trains to Bogor, but except if you want to take the train ride for the experience, it is better to take a bus instead.

Gunung Padang megalithic site.
-6.95107.0166671 Gunung Padang Megalithic Site (Situs Gunung Padang), Karyamukti village, Campaka district (about 25 km south of Cianjur, 7 km from Cireungas railway station). With 29 hectares, the biggest megalithic site in Southeast Asia. It is thought that the site was completed by 5000 BC, and possibly even much earlier. This means that, according to the surveys, the site is older than the Egyptian pyramids, and larger than the Borobudur temple. Gunung Padang ('Mount Padang') encompasses andesite rocks, which have only partly been excavated by archeologists. This means that there are still large structures to up to 15 metres below the surface, including large chambers. There are two stairways to access the site. The old one is very steep, and there is a newer one that is easier and longer. It must be noted that a group of leading Indonesian scientists has questioned the methods of the archeologists on the site, and some presume the site consists of the remainders of an ancient volcano, and that it is not man-made. Rp 2,000 for Indonesians, Rp 5,000 for foreigners.   (updated Oct 2016)
-6.770556107.1380562 Mount Mananggel (Gunung Mananggel), Jln. Cibeureum Desa. Mekar Jaya Kec. Mande Cianjur (Hiking), ☏ +6281287318744, bulehomestaycianjur@gmail.com. Mount Manangel is the mountain that is closest to the town of Cianjur - about 7 km from the town. It is 1200 m above sea level. Starting at the edges of the town, you can walk across the flowing paddy fields, through villages to the foot of the mountain until you reach a waterfall that will get you refreshed if you fancy taking a swim at Cibodas’ waterfalls. Hike for 2½ hours then you’ll see a lake of Jangari and town of Cianjur with very green expanse of paddy fields, offering some stunning views. If you are lucky, you may even see wild monkeys, but they are still intimidated by our arrival, and will run away fast when people try and get too close! On the top of mountain there is a stone with a footprint which was left there in ancient times. At the end of hiking, the track will be going down and much easier.  (updated Apr 2017)
Mount Manangel and Geulis are adjacent to each other, a row of the foothills of Mount Gede and Pangrango.
