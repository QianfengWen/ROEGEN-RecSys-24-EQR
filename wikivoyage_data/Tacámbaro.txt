Town Plaza in Tacambaro
Tacámbaro, officially known as Tacámbaro de Codallos, is a small city in the Mexican state of Michoacan. It is a place where history comes alive, but is also known for outdoor activities including a volcanic crater lake, hiking areas to waterfalls, and aquatic parks. It has been designated as one of Mexico's Pueblos Mágicos.


Understand[edit]
Tacámbaro's known story begins in the early 14th century when it was taken over by the purépechas. During the Colonial Mexico era, it was claimed by Cristóbal de Oñate as an encomienda with the town formally established in 1535. The chapel and convent were built in the early 16th century. Disease swept through the indigenous population in 1575, killing more than half the town's population. After the Mexican War of Independence, the haciendas were burned. The town was briefly the state capital of Michoacan.
