Understand[edit]
Get in[edit]
Main Street in Kanab.
There is not a bus route or trail route going through Kanab, but there is a small airport. You can fly into Las Vegas (4- to 5-hour drive) or Salt Lake City (an over 5-hour drive) on the major airlines.  Some commuter airlines serve St. George, Utah (an over 2-hour drive).

37.00987-112.53021 Kanab Airport. 2378 S. Hwy 89 A. 
Get around[edit]
Walking to the shops and movie theatre on Main Street is a popular pastime for tourists.  The "Gazebo" on the church lawn, directly across the road from the theatre, hosts live entertainment most summer nights.  Walking down the road past most of the hotels is the Kane County Office of Tourism and next door is the Crescent Moon Theatre.  The Adobe Fitness Center is across the highway from the theatre.  Most things tourists want are right on the main road within walking distance.

36.8064-111.7411 Vermilion Cliffs National Monument. The famous "wave" is here. Only twenty people per day are permitted to visit: ten by online application months in advance, and ten by lottery at the Grand Staircase-Escalante Visitor Center here in Kanab. If you can't get the permit, don't worry, the national monument includes other beautiful scenery too. White Pocket is less popular than the wave because it's more difficult to get to (four-wheel drive is needed), but it doesn't require a permit, and some say it's even more spectacular than the wave.
