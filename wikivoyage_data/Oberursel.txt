Passage from the Marktplatz to St. Ursula Church
Oberursel, or Oberursel (Taunus), is a small city in Hesse. The city is in the area of the Taunus mountain range in Hesse, north of Frankfurt.


Understand[edit]
The highlight of Oberursel is its Altstadt (old town area), a residential area with many half-timbered houses. On its east side is the historic Marktplatz (market place). The streets Strackgasse and Vorstadt connect Marktplatz to the more modern shopping district along a pedestrian mall. As you walk Strackgasse and Vorstadt towards the Marktplatz, you will notice that the buildings become older as they transition from modern to medieval.

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
U-Bahn: Take line U3, direction Oberursel (Taunus)-Hohemark, getting off at Oberursel (Taunus) Altstadt. The train leaves Frankfurt Willi-Brandt-Platz every 15 minutes; the trip duration is 33 minutes. From the U-Bahn station, walk along Hohemarkstraße to Eppsteinerstraße to Marktplatz (distance about 450 metres).
S-Bahn: Take line S-5, direction Friedrichsdorf Bahnhof, getting off at Oberursel (Taunus) Bahnhof. The train leaves Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof every 15 minutes; the trip duration is 17 minutes.
