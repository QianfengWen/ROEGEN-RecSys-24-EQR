Delgadillo's Historic Route 66 Visitor Center
Seligman is a town in the state of Arizona.  The city is located on the old Route 66 and is home to the greatest concentration of Route 66 kitsch in Arizona if not the country, which makes it a frequent pit stop for travelers passing through on their way to more exotic destinations.


Get in[edit]
Seligman is located off of I-40.  It is east of Kingman and west of Ash Fork.

Get around[edit]
Seligman's a one-street town if there ever was one.  The names Chino Street, Main Street, and Historic Route 66 are used interchangeably.
