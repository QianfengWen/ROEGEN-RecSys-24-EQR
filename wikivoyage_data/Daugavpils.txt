Daugavpils is the second largest city in Latvia, after Riga. It is a delightfully charming, spacious and green city. Despite its quaint atmosphere and low prices, the city offers modern conveniences and services. An ice-hall, bowling centre and modern hotels have been built and diverse entertainment options have appeared throughout the city.


Understand[edit]
The city was first mentioned in 1275, when the Order of Life built a castle, the Dünaburg, on the Daugava River. The present location of the city originated in the 16th century 20 km away from the original settlement, which was destroyed. In 1582, Dünaburg received the city rights. Latgale belonged to the Polish-Lithuanian empire back then.
During the Polish-Russian War (1654-1667), the city fell under Russian rule, and was renamed Borisoglebsk (Борисоглебск) (1656-1667). After the end of Russian rule, it came under Polish rule again. In 1772, Latgale joined the tsarist Russia in the aftermaths of the Polish divisions. In 1811, Dünaburg was strengthened with a fortress. Together with the rest of Latgale, the city was under the Polotsk Government, which was reassigned in 1802 to the Vitebsk Government. In 1893, Dünaburg was renamed Dvinsk.
The city was at the front in both world wars, and suffered serious damage then. In December 1919, Polish and Latvian troops defeated the Red Army, which made an important step towards the Latvian independence, which came in 1920. The city was called Daugavpils and belonged to Latvia since then.
With the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1939 between Germany and the Soviet Union, the independent Latvia fell under the influence of the Soviet Union. In June 1940, the Red Army entered Latvia, and in August 1940 it became part of the Soviet Union. In 1941, the city was re-taken by German troops. Since 1945, when the town belonged to the Latvian Socialist Soviet republic, Daugavpils underwent a large-scale industrialization and became a garrison city.

Landmarks[edit]
With good reason the fortress, which was built as a fortification for the western border of the Russian Empire, can be considered the symbol of Daugavpils. The Classicism-style fortress was consecrated by Russia’s tsar in 1833. In later years the tsarist, Latvian and Soviet Armies were stationed there. The fortress is now under the supervision of the local municipality and Real Estates Agency as a cultural and historical monument.
The Daugava protecting dam, which stretches 6 km along the river and at its highest points reaches 9 m, is another singular landmark. It was built in 1841, and is still protecting the city from flood waters. On accordance with the town-building plan, confirmed by the tsar in 1826.

Fountain in Dubrovin Park
Daugavpils center and its street network took shape in the early 19th century. The features of the styles peculiar to this historical period have been preserved in Riga street, the main street of the city center. A characteristic feature of buildings is Classicism-style red brick houses with ornamentation of various styles. The house at 8 Riga street, which now houses the Daugavpils Local Arts and History Museum, has preserved its original architecture almost unaltered. The house was built in the second half of the 19th century. Its decoration of colorful glazed files is completely original. All entrances to the house have small glass-covered open-work metal roofs. More than a hundred years ago a 3-ha park was laid out in the center of the city. The park is now called Dubrovin’s Park as it was created with great assistance and support of Pavel Dubrovin, the first head of the city. It has been a rest place popular with the townspeople for years. Between Riga and Saules streets there is Vienības nams (Unity House), designed in plain architectonic forms: prisms and cubes. The many halls and rooms of this building house a theater, the city central library, several shops and cafes. All the principal cultural activities of the city take place here. In the early 1980s Riga street, in which several buildings of historical and architectural value are situated, was one of the first cities in Latvia which was made pedestrians-only.

Monuments and memorial places[edit]
The most significant events in Daugavpils history are immortalized in various monuments and memorial places. The soldiers killed in World War I are buried in Old Believers, Orthodox and Lutheran cemeteries. The Latvian army soldiers, killed in fights for freedom, are buried in the Lutheran cemetery. Their graves there as well as the Polish army soldier’ graves in Satiksmes iela testify to the events relating to history of the independent Latvian state. A 13-m-tall reinforced concrete cross has been erected in Satiksmes iela to commemorate the events. A memorial stone to the citizens of Daugavpils, deported to Siberia in 1941 and 1945, is erected in Pumpura Park.
