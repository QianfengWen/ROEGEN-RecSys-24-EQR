Not to be confused with Cowan in Victoria, in which is covered in the Phillip Island article
Cowan is a very small town in Tennessee.  It has roughly 1,700 residents, and is located at the foot of the Cumberland Plateau between Chattanooga and Nashville. Cowan is oriented around the junction of Tennessee Highway 41 and the CSX railroad heading toward Decherd.


Get in[edit]
The only way into Cowan is to drive Tennessee Highway 41, which is named Cumberland St. in town.

Get around[edit]
Cowan is a small town, and it can easily be covered by foot or bike. However, a car is essential for entering or leaving town.

See[edit]
Downtown Cowan is largely unchanged from its condition 100 years ago, which gives it a quaint and quiet atmosphere. This lack of big-city bustle is the town's main attraction, but there are a handful of local attractions to interest visitors.

 Railroad Museum, 108 Front St S, ☏ +1 931-967-3078. Located in the former depot near the railroad tracks in the town center. Staffed by volunteers, so calling ahead is very strongly advised. Contains all manner of railroad memorabilia and resources; a must for railroad buffs. 
Do[edit]
Mountain Goat Trail.  Avid mountain-bikers and off-roaders should ask about the Mountain Goat Trail, which runs up the Plateau toward St. Andrew's and Sewanee. The trail follows the route of the legendary "Mountain Goat", the steam locomotive that allowed for the development of towns on top of the steep-sided mountains. The trail narrows after crossing Highway 56, making it too narrow for automobiles, but four-wheelers can navigate it as well as many side roads.  Locals can point you to its precise location outside Cowan.
Otherwise, Cowan is not the kind of town you visit to "do" anything. Enjoy the quiet, lazy atmosphere of a traditional small Southern town.

There are a handful of shops near the center of town, most of which sell antiques and other miscellaneous items.  You can easily park your car and reach most of them on foot.
