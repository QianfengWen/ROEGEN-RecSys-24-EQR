Nivala is a town in the Southern Oulu region of Northern Finland.


Understand[edit]
One of the towns in the Kalajoki river basin, Nivala is best known as the home of Kyösti Kallio — the 4th president of Finland.
The first church in Nivala was built in the 1620s, and the town became an independent parish in the 1650s. During the 18th century, Nivala developed as a regional trade center for commerce between the north and south of the country. The town's location at the crossroads of several important trade routes played a significant role in its development.
In the late 19th century, the construction of the Jyväskylä–Oulu railway line brought new opportunities for growth and development to Nivala. The railway connection allowed for increased trade and commerce, as well as improved transportation and communication between Nivala and other parts of the country.
During the 20th century, Nivala continued to grow and modernize. In the 1960s, the town's industrial sector began to expand, with the establishment of several new factories and businesses. Today, Nivala has a diverse range of industries, including agriculture, forestry, manufacturing, and services.
