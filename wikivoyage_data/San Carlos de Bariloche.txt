Bariloche is in the Río Negro Province, near the Nahuel Huapi National Park in Argentina. One of the most visited cities in Argentinian Patagonia, it is famous for skiing and is great for sightseeing, water sports, trekking and climbing. Despite being an undeniable tourist magnet, Bariloche is set amidst incredible landscapes which should not be missed by nature-loving travelers. Another claim to fame is its Swiss-like atmosphere and its chocolate boutiques and breweries, and look for the St Bernard dogs on display for tourists.

San Carlos de Bariloche weather is transitional between the wet climate of the Andes to the west and the dry climate of Patagonia to the east. Areas to the west such as the city centre receive more precipitation than areas to the east such as the airport. Summers are characterized by long stretches sunny, dry, and windy weather with pleasant afternoons and cold nights, occasionally dropping below freezing. The strong winds make the temperatures feel colder than it should be. Spring and fall are variable with some days being pleasant while other days being cold. Snowfall is common in these seasons. Winters are cool to cold with frequent precipitation, bringing stormy weather with mixed precipitation (snow, rain, sleet), occasional snowstorms. Temperatures during the day are usually above freezing and nights are cold. The city receives abundant snowfall during this season, averaging 23-42 cm (9.0-16.4 in), making it an excellent destination for skiing.

By car[edit]
To go by car to Bariloche from Buenos Aires takes about 22 hours. One of the best alternatives is to go to Neuquen on the first day (a distance of about 1200 km) and then to continue the second day driving about 450 km.
There is more than one route to get to Bariloche by car from Buenos Aires:

Short route: Take “Ruta Nacional Nº 5”, then take “Ruta Provincial Nº 1” nearby Lonquimay. Then, take “Ruta Provincial Nº 18” nearby “Macachin”. Take “Ruta Nacional Nº 35” south for 22 km, and then turn right and follow “Ruta Nacional Nº 152” through General Acha and until the “Casa de Piedra” where the route name changes to “ruta provincial Nº 6”.  You must follow this until the intersection with “Ruta Nacional Nº 22”, where you must turn right again through Cipolletti – Neuquen. These big cities are connected by a bridge with a toll. Follow through the "million" traffic lights until you exit the city. Approximately 32 km later, stop in Arroyito and sleep deeply. Continue driving south using “Ruta Nacional Nº 237”, which will lead you to Bariloche.
Long route:  take “Ruta Nacional Nº 3” south. Rest in Azul for 15 minutes, follow south until Bahia Blanca, rest for some time.

Approximately 32 km later, stop in Arroyito and sleep deeply. Continue driving South using “Ruta Nacional Nº 237”, which will lead you to Bariloche.
By bus[edit]
If you decide to travel by bus you can choose between different companies, such as "Via Bariloche", "El Crucero del Norte", "Andesmar", etc. The first 2 companies offer different services, where the main variable is comfort and price. You can take "supercama", which has wide and large seats. "Cama" has wide seats. "Semi-cama" has the normal distribution of 4 seats per row. From Buenos Aires, "supercama" and "cama" take as long as 19 hours (summer); "semi-cama" makes several stops and takes as long as 22 hours. There are also direct buses to and from Chile (6 to 8 hours ride), going to Osorno or Puerto Montt.
Different routes to get to Bariloche by bus from Buenos Aires are:

Non-stop: “Ruta Nacional Nº 5” – “Ruta Provincial Nº 1” (la Pampa) – “Ruta Provincial Nº 18” (la Pampa) – “Ruta Nacional Nº 35” – “Ruta Nacional Nº 152” – “Ruta Provincial Nº 6” (Río Negro) - “Ruta Nacional Nº 22” – Neuquen – “Ruta Nacional Nº 22” - “Ruta Nacional Nº 237”
Stopping: “Ruta Nacional Nº 3” - “Ruta Nacional Nº 22” – Neuquen - “Ruta Nacional Nº 22” - “Ruta Nacional Nº 237”
By boat[edit]
You can arrive or depart Bariloche by taking a series of ferries that wind through several lakes and connect by short bus rides from the Pacific at Puerto Montt, Chile. It's a one day trip unless you opt to stay overnight at Hotel Peulla near the pass.

On foot[edit]
It is actually possible to hike from Cochamó, Chile, which is close to Puerto Montt and Puerto Varas, to Bariloche, passing by the famous and picturesque -41.4123-72.1281 La Junta. There is a small police checkpoint at -41.505-71.85731 Paso El León where you will receive a small note with which you have to head to the police station once you arrive in the next big city to complete your registration and entrance into the country.

Get around[edit]
Excellent public bus service, served by just one company (since 2017): My Bus. The only exception is if you want to visit Dinahuapi, then you should catch a bus of "Las grutas". If you are planning on using the buses more than a few times, buy a magnetic card—otherwise tickets will suffice. The magnetic card is the same "Sube" system used in Buenos Aires so your can reuse the card if you already have one. As in Buenos Aires, the same card can be shared by more than one person. Alternatively, you can buy the one for the My Bus company on arrival in the bus terminal for AR$11 plus a minimum first credit of AR$29 (subsequent top-ups have a minimum of AR$10) to get into town (AR$35). If you don't have the card, you can ask a passenger to exchange a trip in return for money. Further top-ups are possible in kiosks; the tourism office in the Centro Cívico has a full list, and complete information on bus lines. The trip from downtown Bariloche to Llao Llao is AR$35 (Nov 2019).
Confusingly, there is also another IC card in use in Bariloche, e.g. to go by bus to Dina Huapi northeast of Bariloche. This one is called Solución. However, you might find someone helpful on these buses to share his card with you if you give the related money in exchange.

In the early 1950s, an Austrian scientist named Ronald Richter attempted to build the world's first fusion power plant on an island in a lake in the Andes, the undertaking being known as the Huemul Project. A couple of years and an equivalent of several hundred million US dollars later it came into light that Richter never had got any proof of his design actually functioning in the first place. As the patron of the project, President Juan Perón, was ousted in 1955, Richter was arrested for fraud. Today the ruins of the project can be visited on the island, and the city itself remains a center of Argentinian nuclear research.   (updated Aug 2015)

Eat[edit]
Bariloche offers an excellent array of restaurants, with cuisines from all around the world, serving quality food.

 El Boliche de Alberto. Has, according to some, the best meat in Argentina. There are two restaurants in town, and one located about 8 km out of town. Ask a taxi driver to take you there. Be aware that if you arrive after 20:00, you may have to wait in line for 30 min or more, especially if you are a party of 6 or more. El boliche de Alberto has a meat version of the restaurant which specialises in meats such as beef, chicken or pork etc. and there is a pasta version which serves a variety of different pastas. 
 Parrilla El Refugio del montañes...de Julian (La Parrilla de Julian), San Martín 590. Also called "El Refugio Del Montañes", this family-owned restaurant has a homey atmosphere (especially compared to the tourist-trap feel of El Boliche de Alberto) that adds to the experience. The meat is very good, you don't have to wait 2 hr to enjoy it, and the location is conveniently on one of the main avenues in Bariloche. However serving sizes are quite small and pricey (AR$200 for a modest 2-person dinner with desert and no wine) 
 Taberna Breogan Celta (also on San Martín, one of the main avenues). This local restaurant features the local smoked wild game. Especially recommended is the meat-n-cheese plate featuring venison, wild boar, salmon, and two kinds of cheese. 
 Casita Suiza. One of the best regional restaurants in Bariloche. You also can ask Swiss specialties like fondues, raclettes and pierrades. 
 Cassis Restaurant (Peñón de Arelauquen, Ruta 82, Lago Gutiérrez), ☏ +54 2944-476167.

 Wilkenny, San Martín 435. Irish-themed bar popular with tourists. There are better choices. 
 South Bar, Juramento. Popular local bar. 
 Asia Bar, Mitre 774. Salsa evening every Friday, 01:00-05:00. (updated Jun 2018)
Dance clubs[edit]
Teens from all over Argentina arrive on a school trip to Bariloche to celebrate their last year of high school with their classmates. That is why Bariloche features a lot of sophisticated dance clubs.

 Bypass. Offers a very elegant environment with lots of laser effects and nice music. 
 Cerebro. One of the oldest dance clubs in Bariloche. It is quite nice and it offers laser effects but not as colorful as other dance clubs. 
 Grisu. This is a must-visit place. It has wood-like walls and it is designed in such a way that it is easy to get lost if you don't know your way around. It has a very quite place with a huge window showing the Nahuel Huapi lake. There are no laser effects but the bartenders are experts and it is worth watching them doing all sorts of tricks. 
 Rocket. Four floors dance club full of light, colors and sounds. Good laser show and nice atmosphere. 
 Genux. Futurist-looking disco. Open since 1993.

 Design Suites Hotel, Av. Exequiel Bustillo 2500 Km2.5, ☏ +54 29444 57000, reservas.brc@gruposolanas.com. Check-in: 15:00, check-out: 11:00. Modern hotel (not all suites as the name might imply), with all the benefits (spacious rooms, free Wi-Fi, stunning panorama views, clever design touches) and drawbacks you expect from a boutique hotel. The suites themselves are not traditional suites, rather larger rooms with a couch and a balcony. 3 km from the city center. From US$180. (updated Sep 2017)
Stay safe[edit]
Because of the high tourist presence, petty crime is a reality but there tend to be a large number of police in force and the smaller and relatively affluent nature of the city makes crime less likely than in Buenos Aires.  Still, exercise caution and keep valuables within sight. Never hike alone on the trails which touch the city, particularly up to Piedras Blancas. There have been many reported robberies of tourists on these paths.
If you decide to change money with the street changers, be very careful of fake notes, check every bill and count them properly.

Go next[edit]
El Bolsón – A small hippie town (founded in the 1970s) in a mountainous valley about 120 km (75 mi) south of Bariloche. There's a twice weekly outdoor flea market (get there in the morning, it closes down around 15:00). Transportation on the El Valle bus line is AR$24 one way from Bariloche and is worth it for the scenery alone.
Villa la Angostura – A small town about an hours drive from Bariloche, very picturesque, you can also hike a 12-km trail to the famous Bosque Arrayanes. Buses regularly go there from the bus terminal (1½ hrs, AR$52), and the journey along the lake is fantastic.
Chile – It is actually possible to hike to Chile, namely Cochamó, which is close to Puerto Montt and Puerto Varas, passing by the famous and picturesque La Junta. There is a small police checkpoint at Paso El León where you will receive a small note with which you have to head to the police station once you arrive in the next big city to complete your registration and entrance into the country.
