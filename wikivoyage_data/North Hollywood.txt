North Hollywood is served by the county-wide Metro public transit system. The intersection of Chandler Blvd and Lankershim Blvd is the terminus for both the Metro Rail Red Line (which heads south via Universal City to Hollywood and Downtown L.A.) and the Metro Orange Line busway (which heads west to other Valley neighborhoods.
