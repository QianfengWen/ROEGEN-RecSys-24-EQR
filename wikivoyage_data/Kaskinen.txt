Kaskinen (Kaskö in Swedish) is an idyllic harbour town on the shores of the Gulf of Bothnia in Ostrobothnia, Finland.


Understand[edit]
The town hall of Kaskinen
The town was founded in 1785.
In the early 20th century, Kaskinen grew and modernized, with new infrastructure and transportation links being established in the area. The construction of a new harbor and railway station in the town helped to boost its economy, while the establishment of new businesses and industries created jobs and opportunities for local residents.
Pulp industry played an important role in the history of Kaskinen, and the town was home to a major pulp factory for many years. The factory was established in the 1930s and became one of the largest employers in the region, providing jobs for hundreds of local residents. The pulp factory produced a range of products, including paper, cardboard, and other materials, and helped to fuel the growth and development of the local economy. In 2009, the decision was made to close the pulp factory, which was a major blow to the local economy and led to the loss of many jobs in the town.
Kaskinen covers an area of ​​30 km², of which the water area is 18.5 km². The town has about 1,300 inhabitants, of whom about 70% are Finnish-speaking and about 30% Swedish-speaking. The town is an enclave of Närpes and the smallest town of Finland.

Get in[edit]
The main routes to Kaskinen are Highway 67 (from Kauhajoki via Teuva, both in Southern Ostrobothnia in the east) and Regional road 676 (from Närpes centre in the north). From farther away E8 is the main road. The railway does not carry passenger traffic.

By bus[edit]
Direct bus routes are available from Vaasa and Närpes. Timetables are available from Matkahuolto.

By ferry[edit]
There is also a ferry connection to the island Eskilsö (Eskö), Närpes, immediately to the west of the town centre.

62.38307121.2196481 Eskilsö Ferry. 
By boat[edit]
There is a guest harbour in the centre, just north of the Eskö ferry, at a 3.4-m boating route. The route connects to the fairways to the freight port (usable also if coming from Kristinestad), to boating routes to Närpes countryside and to fairways northward.

Get around[edit]
62°21′49″N 21°12′0″EMap of Kaskinen

The town centre is two kilometres long and less than a kilometre across. Even the farthest points of the main island (the one reachable by bridge) are just a few kilometres away. If you like walking or stay in the centre, you don't need but your feet. A bike is convenient if you want to get around more.
While Kaskö has a large sea area, Sälgrund is across a 300 m sound from the centre and other islands you might want to visit are equally easy to reach with a rowing boat. The archipelago continues though in the neighbouring municipalities.
