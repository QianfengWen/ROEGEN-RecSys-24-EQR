Agost (Valencian pronunciation: [aˈɣost]) is a town of 4,700 people (2018) in the province of Alicante, about 18 km from the provincial capital Alicante. For centuries the town has been known for its ceramics.


Understand[edit]
Agost was first settled by the Iberians, and later inhabited by the Moors, who built a now-ruined castle on the hilltop in the centre of town. After the Reconquista, the town belonged to the crown of Castile for a few years, before being incorporated into the Kingdom of Valencia in the late 13th century. Agost gained municipal autonomy at the end of the 17th century.
Due to the rich clay deposits located just outside the city, the town developed into a centre of pottery. Although many of the old workshops have now closed, eleven potteries still remain in town, six of them still producing traditional wares.
Because of its distance from the coast, the town has not been inundated by mass tourism and has retained its local identity. Today its primary economic activity is ceramics production and agriculture.
