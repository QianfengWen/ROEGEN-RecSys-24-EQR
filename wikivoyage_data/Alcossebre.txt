Alcossebre
Alcossebre (Spanish: Alcocébre or Alcocéber) is a seaside village on the Costa del Azahar of Castellón province, south of Peñiscola. For visitors it is best known for its excellent beaches.  It is surrounded by natural parks: Sierra de Irta on the north, Islas Columbretes on the east and Prat de Cabanes on the south. In Serra de Irta there are many small beaches.


Understand[edit]
The village of Alcossebre is administratively part of the municipality of the neighbouring inland town of Alcalà de Xivert. Traditionally sons would inherit fertile lands around Alcala, while daughters inherited less valuable property on the seafront. Today however the daughters are the winners of this arrangement, as beginning in the 1980s the tranquil fishing village began to develop into a seaside resort.
The village has largely kept its Spanish identity, however, by maintaining its charming historic centre with narrow alleys and romantic shops and cafés, and by avoiding the worst of the over-development and mass tourism common in other areas of the Spanish coastline. In the summer, its winter population of 5,000 doubles, with mostly Spanish and French visitors as well as a few Germans and Dutch.
