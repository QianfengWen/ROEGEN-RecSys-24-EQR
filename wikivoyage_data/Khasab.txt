Khasab (Arabic: خصب‎) is a city in the northwest Omani exclave of Musandam and home to about 18,000 inhabitants. It is the state capital of the Musandam peninsula on the coast of the Hormuz Strait between Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Oman.


Understand[edit]
Khasab was isolated from the rest of the region for a long time. In the 16th century Portuguese troops conquered the peninsula and established colonial structures. After Oman regained control, Khasab was controlled tightly due to its strategic position. The construction of the new road from the United Arab Emirates was started by the city to develop its infrastructure and encourage more tourism and investment. It is most popular to spend a weekend off from Dubai or to visit on your way to Muscat, taking the twice a day ferry-boat along the deserted and arid rocky coast of Musandam.
The city is the starting point to explore the little-known Musandam Peninsula and its special and unique traditions and culture. Travellers can enjoy great sights in and around the city that can be seen in two or three days cruising the region.

Climate[edit]
Khasab has a hot desert climate with very hot and humid summers and mild winters. Precipitation is low, and mostly falls from December to March.
Khasab is best visited in the winter, as it is one of the hottest places in Oman, with summer temperatures regularly climbing over 45°C.
The world's highest minimum temperature (41.2°C, since broken) was recorded on the airport in 2011, and in 2017 the highest nighttime low temperature recorded (44.2 °C) was recorded.

Khasab is not easy to access, although you have a few transportation options, including daily morning flights from Muscat, a weekly ferry from Muscat or semi-weekly ferry from Dibba, or driving from the UAE through the Al Darah border post.

By cruise ship[edit]
Passengers disembarking at the 26.2066956.244913 Khasab cruise ship terminal will find free shuttle buses to take them to the city centre, as well as tour operators who charge considerably less than the cruise line for organised excursions.

By road[edit]
View along the Khasab Coastal Road
You can easily drive from Dubai or any of the other emirates by heading north on the E11 motorway towards Ras al Khaimah, and then on to the 26.0506456.087781 Al Darah border post, after which the road becomes the very scenic 02, or the 'Khasab Coastal Road'. The road is in very good condition on the Omani side and the UAE RAK part is being upgraded.
If driving a hired car, be sure to inquire whether the company permits their cars to be driven into Oman, and if so which specific border crossings may be used, as not all crossings may be permitted. You should let the rental agency know at least a day beforehand, so that they can prepare the necessary documentation for the border officials. If you are driving your own car and do not have coverage for Oman, you can usually purchase third-party liability insurance on the Omani side of the border. This situation may change with little notice.
For the very adventurous, it is possible to take a taxi from Ras al Khaimah to the Al Darah border, but there are no taxis on the Omani side. Many trucks pass through this border daily, however, so you can ask an Omani police officer to get you a ride in one of these trucks and then hitchhike all the way to Khasab.

Get around[edit]
Central Khasab
There are no taxis in Khasab; however most hotels offer free minivan transportation within the city. To go further afield, you'll have to have your own car, or hire one. Additionally a number of travel agencies in Khasab offer organized minivan city tours, for half- or full-day visits.
During the cooler months, it's possible to explore the city by foot, and to hike around nearby villages and the mountains. If by chance you live in the UAE and are visiting Khasab with your own car, you can bring along your bicycle. Dress conservatively if entering Bedouin or remote fishing villages.

See[edit]
Central courtyard of Khasab Castle with traditional fishing boats on display
Khasab Center Mosque by night
26.208656.244351 Khasab Dhow Port (facing the ferry terminal). The traditional port for dhow boats is a place where you can appreciate and enjoy typical photogenic boats from this region – nowadays most of them are motorised. You can easily find boats here to take you on a sea cruise. 
26.2051756.246572 Iranian smugglers (right by the cruise ship dock). Khasab is known for its Iranian smugglers. Daily hundreds of small jet boats cross the Strait of Hormuz from the southern Iranian cities of Bandar Abbas and Qeshm Island, bringing over goats and sheep destined for the UAE, and porting back such diverse items as televisions, cigarettes, and other goods in an effort to avoid Iranian import duties. The smugglers' fortunes fluctuate with the value of the Iranian currency and with the effects of international sanctions. It's a dangerous business, as they must avoid not only very heavy shipping traffic but also the Iranian Coast Guard, which has no qualms of shooting them on sight – spotters on the Iranian side help by tracking the coast guard's movements. Because Khasab is a free trade port the Omani authorities tolerate this practice, provided the activities only take place during daylight hours. Toward sunset the activity gets especially frenetic as they pack up their wares to leave again. 
26.1982156.249163 Khasab Castle (S side of the harbour, facing the ferry terminal). The Portuguese constructed this fortress in the beginning of the 17th century and occupied it until their withdrawal from the region. This castle, which housed the Wali and his family in recent centuries and once held prisoners, has been restored and transformed into a regional museum. In the courtyard of the castle are boats and houses representative of the unique heritage of Musandam. RO 0.5. 
26.1941456.25244 Al Khmazera Castle (Alkmazrh Fort / Khmazera Castle). Sa-W 8AM-2PM. This fort is inside the city and it seems to belong to a specific tribe among the local people. The fort is taken care by the tribe's youngsters, who are proud of their ancestral possession. (updated Mar 2018)
26.1987356.244935 Khasab palm groves (old city). Hidden inside Khasab's old city, you can visit and explore the beautiful palm groves, which supply local people with some dates. 
26.1832556.247316 Khasab Central Mosque (Sultan Qaboos Mosque) (New Souq area). The central mosque in the south of the city was completed in 2009, and is an important landmark. It has a capacity of 1900 worshippers and, just like many other large mosques in Oman, is named after the current sultan. (updated Mar 2018)
Do[edit]
Dhow cruise in Khor Ash Sham
Telegraph Island
Al Hajar al Gharbi Mountains
 Dhow cruises. Twice daily. A great way to appreciate the dramatic coastline is to take a cruise in a dhow. Cruises depart from the main Khasab port and travel through Khor Ash Sham, the largest and one of the more scenic fjords. Highlights include dolphin-watching, visits to 26.195556.342887 Telegraph Island (Jazirat al Maqlab) with its abandoned 19th-century British telegraph station, and snorkeling in the surrounding waters. Full-day cruises continue on to 26.220756.39078 Seebi Island (Jazirat Sibi), with possible detours to one or more traditional fishing villages, and more snorkelling.The dhow operator will provide all snorkelling equipment, along with drinks and a snack for the half-day excursion, or lunch for the full-day outing. Any of the agencies in town can arrange this but possibly the easiest way to book a trip is through the front desk of your hotel. Half-day: RO 15 if going with other people, RO 30 if going alone; full-day: RO 20. 
 Diving. The diving season runs from April through January, and the best time to see whale sharks is between May and October. Most dive spots are also suitable for snorkeling. In addition to the dive centres listed below, the Atana Khasab (listed under 'sleep') has its own dive centre. (updated Sep 2018)

 Al Hajar al Gharbi Mountains (Ru'us al-Jabal Mountains). Khasab is a good base to stage a mountain safari and explore the rugged northernmost extremity of the Western Hajar Mountains. If you don't have your own 4WD vehicle, you can rent one or arrange a guided tour through one of the travel agencies in town. Highlights include the prehistoric petroglyphs of 26.177556.217859 Tawi Village and the Musandam Peninsula's highest point, 25.976356.23223 Jebel Harim (2087 m). At the mountain top is a military radar station, so going to the top requires permission and most tours therefore stop at 1600 m above sea level near the military barracks. 
26.2118856.23854 Bassa Beach (Bossa Beach). A pleasant beach popular with locals, with picnic and toilet facilities. Free. 
 City walk by night. As the temperature is far more pleasant during the evening, you can stroll around the city center along the avenue and center mosque. Also, there are a couple of gardens that are open by night, where you can see families playing with their children. 
Tour agencies[edit]
For exploring the coastline, or for those without a vehicle, there are a half-dozen agencies in town which offer tours with English-speaking guides. Excursions include dhow cruises, kayak tours, mountain safaris, and camping trips. The most established are listed below.
Several tour operators offer day-long or overnight dhow trips to the very isolated village of 26.33666756.40972210 Kumzar, where inhabitants speak Kumzari, the only Persian language native to the Arabian peninsula.

 Dates. At the tiny Sikkit market in centre town you can buy fresh dates. 
Eat[edit]
Date plantation
Most supermarkets have freezers with several types of ice cream, which is very welcome in the extreme heat.
Unsurprisingly the local cuisine is based primarily on grilled meats and seafood, with some Persian influences. Although most hotels have their own onsite restaurants, it is worth seeking out the handful of local establishments listed below.

Drink[edit]
As elsewhere in the Gulf region, fruit juices and smoothies are a popular drink served in some restaurants. They are generally made with real fruit and often mixed with ice cream.
Black tea is the traditional tea from the region, served in all local restaurants; however nowadays it is usually Lipton Black Tea.
Alcohol is served only in a couple of licensed restaurants and bars attached to the Atana Khasab and the Atana Musandam Resort, and as it is imported, rather expensive (e.g. beer RO 3-4).

Sleep[edit]
Bossa beach
Khasab has six hotels and limited capacities for travellers, and during the weekend hotels are usually sold out.
Bassa Beach (Bossa Beach), which is very popular with families, is an option for a single night of camping. The beach has only a toilet and no other facilities. It's directly on the road between Atana Khasab Hotel and Khasab and is very lively during the weekend. Non-Emirati/Omani travellers should expect to be seen as a tourist attraction with unwanted attention from kids or youths from the area.

Respect[edit]
When visiting nearby villages, it is especially important to dress appropriately and behave respectfully (i.e. do not photograph villagers without their permission). This is not Dubai! For most of the 2010s all visits to Kumzar were suspended following villagers' complaints about outsiders' behaviour; the village been reopened to visitors, but a special permit required (see details above under 'Tour agencies').
