Get around[edit]
Rantepao is small enough to be walkable. Otherwise, riding an ojek or becak or bemo is easy.
Scooters are easily arranged for in homestays. There are also several rental places but they will usually require the motorbike be returned by 17:00 if you rent per day. Price is around Rp 100,000 per day (Sep 2018).
Do not expect to relax in the middle of nature. Rantepao is a bustling small town. The main road (crossing the city from south to north) is packed with vehicles. Some locals wear masks or scarfs to protect from the dust and pollution.

Rantepao is not particularly pleasant in itself, but most touristic facilities (hotels, restaurants, transportation) are located there.
