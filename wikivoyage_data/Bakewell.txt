Bakewell is a picturesque historical market town in the heart of the Peak District National Park, Derbyshire famed for its Bakewell Puddings and Bakewell Tarts. There are several shops claiming to hold the 'original recipe'.  So be sure to try at least one Bakewell pudding whilst you're here.
It is an immensely popular destination for weekend visits because of its beautiful Peak District location, and its "typical country town" feel.

See[edit]
A typical Peak District stone town, with the usual Church, Museum, Shops, River, Old Bridge.

53.1939-1.64981 Haddon Hall (on the way, to Matlock, barely 5 minutes from Bakewell by car, well under an hour by (mostly) riverside path). A lovely medieval hall, expanded piecemeal over the centuries to give very organic and lived-in feel.   
53.227778-1.612 Chatsworth House (a few miles from the town). The massive and spectacular late-17th-century stately home of the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire (the inspiration for Pemberley from Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, apparently), open to public, pay for parking but with free access to the surrounding area (flat riverside ambles, wooded hillside trails, famous fountain. Restaurants, at old stables, a cafe at the car park in the grounds.   
Near Chatsworth in Pilsley is Chatsworth Farm Shop: plays heavily on noble connection: "Duke's cure bacon", "Duchy of Cornwall Biscuits", etc. (Mrs Bucket would shop here) but also popular because of huge range of good fresh fruit, veg and meat, and some exotic stuff not so easy to obtain elsewhere (venison, boar, etc.). Includes a tea shop.
Monsal Dale. A deep picturesque dale complete with the Monsal trail, a disused railway line providing easy walking, cycling and horse riding. Enjoy going through the old tunnel and exiting on the 70-ft-high viaduct over the River Wye.
Do[edit]
Museum, riverside walks, a weekly market on Monday and the agricultural market on various other days. Bakewell is a great base for a Peak District walking weekend, with lovely walks all round (easy riverside, meandering field paths, gentle hill walking, or strenuous crag hopping). Bus to Rowsley for trip on "Peak Rail" steam train to Matlock

Buy[edit]
Usual "country" things: good outdoor shops, discount books, fresh food.  Excellent shop specialising in Scotch Whisky.  Take home an original "Bakewell pudding" or "Derbyshire oatcakes".

Go next[edit]
Bakewell is the local centre, so has very good connections with local towns and villages (lots of small buses). It is situated in superbly beautiful limestone ("White Peak") scenery: green fields, stone walls, sheep, rounded hills topped by horizontal lines of limestone crags. Some of the best walking country in England, makes local places easily accessible on an afternoon stroll.

Many, many nearby villages nearly all worth a trip by bus or car or on foot, and most have a pub or tea shop. Examples include Over Haddon, Monyash, Ashford in the Water and Youlgr(e)ave with two names.
Matlock is 15 minutes by car, and there are also buses, and a steam train from Rowsley. Another Peak District town, a little less cute than Bakewell (preferred by some because of that), with usual shops and pubs and a pleasant riverside town park with a little lake (try lawn bowls – "Crown Green Bowling").
Matlock Bath is just beyond Matlock.  Strange "seaside" feel, almost as far inland as you can get in England, cable cars to hilltop caves and popular meeting place for motorcyclists at the weekend, worth visiting to see hundreds of bikes lined up along the main street.
Cromford is a mile beyond Matlock Bath.  A tiny town in a green setting, yet its main draw is "Arkwright's Mill" from the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, the first large factory (water-powered cotton spinning mill) in the modern world. Also the Cromford Canal is a lovely waterway in a very rural setting – but not yet reconnected to the English canal network, so few boats.
