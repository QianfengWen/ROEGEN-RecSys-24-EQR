Lahti (Swedish: Lahtis) is a city in southern Finland, on the shore of Vesijärvi and by the esker Salpausselkä.
The city is known for sports, especially ski jumping and skiing. It has hosted many world championship and hosts the yearly international Lahti Ski Games (Finnish: Salpausselän kisat).
Lahti is also a traditional industrial city. However, the city suffered heavily during the economic downturns, especially in the early 1990s, earning a somewhat gritty reputation. Unemployment and alienation are still commonplace in suburbs of Lahti. Things are however now looking brighter again with a new direct railway to Helsinki and the city centre being revamped.


Understand[edit]
Lahti City Theater
Lahti was just a village until it got the railway in 1870. It then grew quickly and got its city status in 1905. In 2021 Lahti had a population of 120,000 making it the 8th largest city in Finland by population. It is near the country's gravity centre by population.
The area was inhabited already 9,000 years ago, with one of the oldest settlements found in Finland.

Coming via Turku harbour, there may be a direct service from the ferry terminal to Lahti. See here for schedules.
