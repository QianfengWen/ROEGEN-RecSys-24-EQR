Kent, a city of 30,071 (2016) people on the Cuyahoga River in Northeastern Ohio, is part of the greater Akron area.
Established in 1805 as Franklin Mills, a settlement that exploited the river to operate water-powered mills. 1830s and 1840s development was based around the Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal. Franklin Mills was a waypoint on the Underground Railroad before the American Civil War; abolitionist John Brown operated a tannery here from 1836-1837 (the site is now John Brown Tannery Park, a nature park on the Cuyahoga River) and Woodard’s Tavern was a station on the Underground Railroad (the tavern building is gone, although a private home once occupied by Joshua Woodard and his wife Rebecca Wordon still stands).
In 1864, the settlement was renamed for Marvin Kent, who brought the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad maintenance shops to town. Kent has been a college town since Kent State University was established in 1910 alongside its sister school in Bowling Green.
Kent is infamous as the site of the Kent State massacre, in which unarmed college students at Kent State University were shot by members of the Ohio National Guard (killing four and wounding nine others) on 4 May 1970 during a protest against the US military bombing of Cambodia. This created a counter cultural legacy that continues to this day.
The aftermath of the shootings inspired protest music, notably from Bruce Springsteen and Crosby Stills and Nash. The event also inspired locals who would later become founding members of DEVO and The Pretenders to change the style of their music.
Kent offers public bus service and hike-and-bike trails, Kent is "The Tree City". The town has nearly 20 parks and preserves with a number of annual festivals related to Earth Day, folk music and the U.S. Independence Day.

May 4th[edit]


“

Like the Boston Massacre almost exactly two hundred years before (March 5, 1770), which it resembled, it was called a massacre not for the number of its victims but for the wanton manner in which they were shot down.

”


—Philip Caputo

On May 4, 1970, the Ohio National Guard killed 4 students and shot 9 others. Although there was an ongoing anti-war protest, not all the victims were protesters, and some were just walking to class. One of the victims was even enrolled in the Army Reserve Officer Training Corps. The site of the May 4th Shootings is a solemn location. Please respect the location and victims of the shootings.
