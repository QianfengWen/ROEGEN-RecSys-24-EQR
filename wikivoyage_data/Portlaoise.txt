Portlaoise or Port Laoise (pronounced "leesh") is the county town of County Laois, in the south midlands of Ireland. It's a large town that acts as a transport hub for the region and is within an hour's travel of Dublin.  There's plenty of accommodation and similar amenities aimed at business and commercial travel rather than tourism. The town has few attractions but it is close to sights such as Rock of Dunamase and the Slieve Bloom mountains.


Understand[edit]
Rock of Dunamase
The town grew up from the 16th century as Maryborough, named for Queen Mary, when the Tudors established a fort, ousted the Irish rulers the O'Mores, and colonised the area with "Plantations" of loyal English settlers. Growth was slow because of Irish counter-attacks, but the town developed industry and was a stop along the Dublin—Limerick highway. The railway arrived in the 19th century to put it within an hour or so of Dublin. During independence it was renamed Portlaoise and became a hub for several state agencies, eg the Post, and there's a large maximum security prison. In the 21st century Portlaoise grew rapidly as a commuter town for Dublin, and in 2016 the population was 22,050, making it the most populous town in the Midlands.

Tourist information[edit]
Portlaoise Tourism website
The Tourist Office is at Lyster Square, just a short walk from Main Street, facing James Fintin Lalor Avenue, close to the eastbound bus stop.
Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
Trains from Dublin Heuston run hourly from 6:30AM to 10PM. Commuter trains take 70 min, with stops at Dublin Park West & Cherry Orchard, Clondalkin, Adamstown, Hazelhatch & Celbridge, Sallins (for Naas), Newbridge, Kildare, Monasterevin and Portarlington to terminate at Portlaoise. Inter-city trains take 45 min, stopping only at Portarlington; they continue south to Ballybrophy (for the branch line to Roscrea and Nenagh), Thurles, Limerick or Cork, or west to Tullamore, Clara and Athlone, where they branch either for Galway or for Roscommon and County Mayo. A walk-up single from Dublin was €16 in 2021: see Irish Rail for timetables, fares and online tickets.  
53.037-7.3021 Portlaoise station is north side of town centre.

By bus[edit]
Dublin Coach 726 (aka N7 or "The Green Bus") runs hourly round the clock from Dublin Airport via Red Cow LUAS stop, Naas, Newbridge, Kildare and Monasterevin, taking two hours to Portlaoise. On race days it also stops at Curragh racecourse near Kildare. A single from the airport is €10. 
From Dublin city centre take a tram or local bus to Red Cow, or Dublin Coach M7 or M9, and change.

See[edit]
53.035-7.2971 Maryborough Fort survives only as a corner tower on Fitzmaurice Place and a couple of sections of wall. It's been adjoined to modern buildings and you can't go inside.
Captain James Fitzmaurice (1898-1965), who gives his name to the square, was co-pilot on the first east-to-west transatlantic flight, in Bremen a Junkers W 33. On 12-13 April 1928 they flew overnight from Baldonnel near Dublin to Greenly Island off Quebec. Gloop! — so they'd flown all that way from Ireland just to find themselves in a bog, which wrecked the aircraft. The Fitzmaurice memorial is shaped like an aircraft wing, though Bremen didn't flop at quite such an angle.
53.036-7.2952 Ridge of Maryborough Graveyard is perched atop an esker, a small but steep hillock. The church has gone but the graveyard contains various 18th-to 19th-century headstones and tombs.
53.0365-7.2963 4th Leinster Regiment Great War Memorial commemorates the 17 officers and 160 men of the regiment who died in the First World War. It's in Memorial Park, a narrow green strip at the junction of Church St and Ridge Rd.
53.035-7.2994 Old St Peter's Church is a fenced-off ruin on Railway St. It was built around 1556 as an RC church, but when Catholic Queen Mary was succeeded by Protestant Queen Elizabeth, it smartly changed denomination. John Wesley, founder of Methodism, is said to have preached here on three occasions and to have declared it an elegant church, but it fell into ruin from 1804 when the new St Peter's was built on Market Square. Those within its graveyard include Bartholomew Mosse, founder of Dublin’s Rotunda Hospital, and the highwayman Jeremiah Grant (see Drink). You'll have to make do with squinting through the wrought iron gate on the street.
53.0322-7.30135 James Fintan Lalor is the statue outside County Hall, the boxy modern building at the junction of Abbeyleix Rd and the boulevard now named for him. Lalor (1809-1849) was primarily a writer advocating for land reform; his poor health gave him little scope for public speaking or physical revolutionary activities. "We hold the present existing government of this island and all existing rights of property in our soil, to be mere usurpation and tyranny . . . " and after his early death (probably from TB) the Great Famine reinforced his point. The next generation of republicans (such as Michael Davitt, James Connolly, Pádraig Pearse and Arthur Griffith) took his argument to its logical conclusion: that cruel and unjust land tenure was the inevitable result of imperial rule over Ireland.
Farther out[edit]
Emo Court
53.03105-7.208186 Rock of Dunamase, Aughnahilla (6 km east of town on N80). 24 hr. A limestop outcrop rearing up 45 m from the plain, with the ruins of Dunamase Castle. Ptolemy's map of 140 AD marks Dunum hereabouts, which may or may not indicate Dunamase, but it's an obvious spot for a stronghold. The first known settlement is the 9th century monastery, but it wasn't fortified nearly enough, as the Vikings made two murderous raids upon it. It may then have lain unoccupied for some decades before becoming a bastion of Diarmait Mac Murchada or MacMurrough, king of Leinster. He was deposed in 1167, supposedly for abducting the wife of the king of Breifne (which was 15 years earlier, while they'd already deposed him once 35 years ago). MacMurrough had obviously failed to read the stirring words of James Fintan Lalor, because his next bright idea was to bring over a large Anglo-Norman army to reclaim his throne. Norman eyes lit up at what they found, and centuries of occupation followed; amongst their many fortifications they built up Dunamase into the stone castle you see today. But the Irish successfully counter-attacked, and by 1350 the castle was derelict, though Cromwell smashed it some more in 1650. Free.   (updated Jun 2021)
53.015-7.1487 Stradbally straggles along N80 towards Carlow. 53.01061-7.15548 Stradbally Hall  is an Italianate pile built by Lanyon in 1860. It's a private residence with no tours, but often hosts horse riding and other events - see below for the Woodland Railway, Steam Rally and Electric Picnic.
52.988-7.3159 Colt 1916 Memorial is on N77 towards Abbeyleix, 6 km south of town. Colt refers to the nearby village not the revolver, but the plaque commemorates the first shots of the Easter Rising. An order calling off the rising failed to reach many, so on the evening of Easter Sunday 23 April 1916, the Laois Volunteers acted on their orders from Patrick Pearse to sabotage the railway, to prevent British reinforcements being sent towards Dublin. They included a railwayman, so they succeeded while similar attempts that night failed; later a train derailed at the spot. Another railwayman had challenged them but was chased away by three gun shots, confirmed as the rising's first, as the Good Friday capture of Casement and the German arms shipment were effected without gunfire.
52.961-7.20210 Timahoe has the remains of St Mochua's monastery. These are scrappy except for the splendid Round Tower, built in the 12th century and 30 m tall.
53.05616-7.2222511 Great Heath Barrow is 6 km NE of town by Exit 16 of M7. Barrows are common prehistoric burial structures and probably had other ritual purposes. This one is a ring barrow, a low mound surrounded by a concentric ditch with an external bank. It's the most visible of several nearby burial structures; what it most looks like is a golf hazard.
53.077-7.19412 Morett Castle is the forlorn stump seen from M7 as you approach town. It was built for the Fitzgeralds circa 1580 and abandoned in the 18th century. It's on private land and hardly worth seeking out in the back lanes.
53.097-7.20813 Emo Court: see Portarlington for this grand mansion, which is closed for restoration until 2022.
