Understand[edit]
White Butte is pronounced so that it rhymes with “cute”. The name of the region comes from combining the names of its two largest towns, White City and Pilot Butte.
White Butte is not one city. Rather, it consists of three towns:

50.435278-104.3572221 White City  – with about 5,000 people, home to most of the services and places of accommodation in the region
50.4894-104.26722 Balgonie  – with about 1,500 people, home to the high school in the region
50.476944-104.4172223 Pilot Butte  – with about 2,000 people
In between and surrounding each of these towns consists of farmland and acerages.

History[edit]
Indigenous peoples inhabited the area for many years before any European settlement. European settlement in the area can be traced back to the 1840s. The Canadian Pacific Rilway was constructed through the region in 1882, and in that same year the towns of Pilot Butte and Balgonie were founded along the railway (which is still in operation).
World War II had a harmful effect on the towns, as residents moved to the nearby city Regina. After World War II, people became more reliant on cars, so living in Pilot Butte and Balgonie began to become a popular option for those who wanted to commute to work in the city. In the late 1950s, the Trans-Canada Highway was completed around the two towns. At this time, White City was formed along this new highway.
All three towns in White Butte have experienced substantial growth since 2011. White City is now the largest town in White Butte.
