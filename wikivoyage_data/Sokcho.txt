Sokcho [dead link] (속초) is a city in Gangwon, South Korea.  It's quite a sleepy city and is known as a gateway to Seoraksan National Park, which is a 30-minute bus ride from the central hub.  Also, the DMZ is an hour north by bus, from the central hub.  The city has many beaches and areas to view the East Sea, or Sea of Japan.


Understand[edit]
The population is about 83,000 (2022), the fifth largest in Gangwon-do after Wonju, Chuncheon, Gangneung, and Donghae, and also ranks as the city with the highest population density in the province. In particular, it is the largest city north of the 38th parallel and the northernmost city in South Korea, being even higher in latitude than North Korea's Kaesong city. The two cities in South Korea farthest away from each other are Sokcho and Mokpo, separated by a distance of 530 km. Along with Jumunjin in Gangneung-si, it is one of the major fishing ports on the east coast, and Seoraksan National Park occupies about half of the city's area.Sokcho fish market at night
Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
Buses leave the Seoul Express Bus Terminal approximately every 30 minutes. It takes around 2:30 - 3:00 hours and buses arrive at the Sokcho Express Bus Terminal. Tickets are approximately ₩15,000 per person. There is rarely need to get tickets in advance.
Buses leave from Dong Seoul Bus Terminal (Gangbyeon Station Line 2) to Sokcho every 30 minutes.
From Chuncheon, they are 17 buses per day leaving from 06:15 until 20:00. The ride takes 2 hours and costs ₩13,400.
Buses from Gangneung costs ₩6,300.
The bus terminals in the jurisdiction include 'Sokcho Express Bus Terminal' and 'Sokcho Intercity Bus Terminal'. The two terminals are in the southern and northern parts of Sokcho, respectively, and are about 3 km away, so be careful.
The city buses in the jurisdiction are Donghae Commercial Express and Gangwon Passenger, and T-money and Cashbee are used for transportation cards. Some postpaid transportation cards are not available, so be careful.
New BS has a high proportion, and there are diesel and electric buses. Donghae-si is the only city bus in the Yeongdong area where gas cars roll.

By train[edit]
As of 2023, no trains serve Sokcho. Hence, if you want to travel from Seoul to Sokcho by train, you have to take a KTX from Cheongnyangni Station to Gangneung, then transfer by bus from Gangneung Intercity Bus Terminal to Sokcho Intercity Bus Terminal. If plans for a railway to be completed and opened by 2027 materialize, travel from Seoul is expected to take an hour and 39 minutes without a transfer.

By ferry[edit]
Sokcho also serves as the terminal for ferries from Zarubino near Vladivostok on the Russian east coast.

By car[edit]
National Road No. 7 is the only national road, and it crosses from Yangyang-gun, passes through Sokcho-si from north to south, and then passes to Goseong-gun. Along with National Route 7, the main interstate road in Sokcho City is Local Road 56, which connects downtown Sokcho, Sokcho IC, and Misiryeong Tunnel.
With the opening of the Donghongcheon IC-Yangyang IC section of the Seoul Yangyang Expressway, it has become easier to move to Gangneung and Samcheok. As a result of driving on the highway from Jamsil to Sokcho, Seoul, on weekdays in June 2020, it was able to run in 2 hours and 5 minutes despite traffic congestion in the existing Gyeongchun Expressway section.

Sokcho is a sprawling city but transport by bus is easy. Bus routes are available through the Naver map app but timetables are not given.
The two bus terminals (intercity and express) are at some distance from one another.  City buses leave regularly for Seoraksan National Park.  The bus leaves irregularly for Osaek (south Seoraksan) from the intercity bus terminal.

By car[edit]
Sokcho is a great place to travel by car. Because the area is not large, it is good to go from place to place. Sokcho is also close to Gangneung, so it is very convenient to move by car.

By bicycle[edit]
There is a place where bicycles are rented. You can rent a bicycle there and enjoy the riding course in Sokcho.
Yeongnangho Lake is a great place for a bicycle course.

Located just off the main street, a hand drawn (called Gaetbae and only ₩200) ferry will take you across the river to this charming village. You can even pull the boat across as a kind of "exercise." There isn't much to see in the village itself, but it served as scenery for the TV drama "Autumn in My Heart" and serves excellent Abai Sundae, a local speciality and probably the best sundae (not the eponymous dessert) in Korea. Instead of pork casings and blood, this variety uses squid for both the casing and filing. Rice, squid, seasonings and vegetables are cooked and then stuffed inside the cavity of the squid, which is then cooked whole. Then the squid 'sausage' is sliced. It's different in size and has a unique flavor from other sundae in Korea. (updated Nov 2022)

A cheaper way of trying crab is at the Sokcho Fish market where takeaway steamed crab is available for ₩15,000.

Cold noodles with pollack
A spicy and savory dish, it came about due to the fact that noodles made from sweet potato starch, potato starch, or buckwheat starch were not traditionally eaten with side dishes. At some point, people started to pair these noodles with pollack or flounder.

It runs about ₩10,000 per dish.

Salted fish
Sokcho is also known for raw, salted fish, especially flounder and pollack. It can be quite expensive in restaurants (₩70,000 for two).
