Mitla is one of the most important Zapotec archaeological sites in Oaxaca, second only to Monte Alban. The site is strange in that the modern town of San Pablo Villa de Mitla has grown in and around the ancient ruins, so that there are different archaelogical zones with ruins, sometimes blocks away from each other, all of which comprise the official Zona Arquelogica. The town is a designated Pueblo Mágico.


Mitla Archaeological Site[edit]
Palace of Columns at Mitla
Human history in the Oaxaca Valley dates to around 8000 BC with the oldest archaeological sites probably being the Caves of Yagul and Mitla (not the ruins in town that we're talking about here). 
Mitla as a settlement dates from sometime in the Preclassic era (roughly 1800-1200 BC). Mitla experienced growth as a spiritual center in the 6th century BC. The town reached its apogee around 1000-1250 AD, which is when most of the structures in the Columns Group were built. 

The Arroyo Group
The Church Group lies next to (and under) St Paul's Church
The site is organized into five groups of structures:

Adobe Group - some of the oldest Zapotec structures, ca. 1000 BC or older, due to similarity in style to Monte Alban
Arroyo Group - an older section of the site, likely Zapotec from the period 200 BC - 200 AD
Church Group - largely unexcavated because St. Paul's Church is built on top of it, some Zapotec continue to perform ancient rituals in these structures
Columns Group - the Palace of Columns is the largest, best preserved, and most impressive structure at Mitla, dates from 1000 AD and later
Southern Group - ruins on the south side of the river, also some of the oldest Zapotec style structures
Mitla is often described interchangeably as Zapotec or as Mixtec or as both. The older settlements and constructions were Zapotec and the town was originally a Zapotec religious stronghold, but when the city of Monte Alban declined, many Mixtec moved to Mitla, and the rise of Mitla between 1250-1470 AD is largely on the strength of Mixtec migration. The Mextec would later migrate further south to get away from the Aztecs, leaving Mitla again, a mostly Zapotec city at the time of the Spanish conquest.

Intricate fretwork (greca) at Mitla
Architecturally, Mitla is in a class by itself due to its unique style marked by elaborate stone fretwork along building edges, above doorways, and running along edges. Intricate patterns are created from carved stones positioned precisely to form geometric shapes. Buildings show a clear differentiation between the substructures and the superstructures.

Mitla Fortress[edit]
Outside the town of San Pablo Villa de Mitla is a hilltop that was fortified with stone walls enclosing structures that were once residences. The fortress area is estimated to be about 1,000 years old and almost certainly was built during a period of war and social unrest.

Gates of Hell[edit]
Mitla was known as a spiritual center for the Zapotec and Mixtec, and the reputation has a lot to do with it being a place for the dead. Legends were told of the city being a burial ground for high priests and kings, buried in underground vaults with mounds of treasure in labyrinthine chambers below ground. When Aztecs subjugated the town in 1470, they called it "Mictlan", a name for the netherworld in the Nahutl tongue. (The word Mitla is simply a Spanish simplification of the Aztec name.) 
During the 17th century, Spanish missionaries were shown an entryway called "Lyobaa", which led to the underworld of the dead. Francisco de Burgoa wrote that he was shown a vast underground temple with four large chambers and the gate leading to the underworld. Unnerved, the padres blocked up the entrance and built the church of San Pablo on top of it. This is identified as "the Church Group" in the modern-day archaeological site map. 
An archaeological team from INAH and UNAM are investigating the site in 2022 and 2023 using various non-destructive scientific tools such as ground-penetrating radar and seismic reflection to "see" below ground around the church. Early results indicate that the underground chambers are real, not just the stuff of legend.

Prehistoric Caves of Mitla and Yagul[edit]
Caves in the Oaxaca Valley are among the oldest archaeological sites in Mexico. The caves here and in the nearby town and archaeological site of Yagul are among sites where humans lived 10,000 years ago. The caves here are a  UNESCO World Heritage Site. UNESCO cited the caves as being the place where agriculture was developed, based on evidence of corn, squash, and beans (the three sisters) having been grown here on a large scale. There are also etchings and cave paintings. M$50 fee to enter, plus M$200 for a guided tour. Mototaxis from the zocalo will bring you to the caves for M$30.

San Pablo Villa de Mitla[edit]
The town of San Pablo Villa de Mitla completely embraces the archaeological site, but is distinct in that it is a lively small town dating from the 17th century. The town has a delightful colonial era centro with 200-year old buildings, cobblestone streets, two large historic churches, and Zapotec traditions that date back over 3,000 years. Almost half the town's population speak an indigenous language (usually Nahuatl) in addition to Spanish. 

Get in[edit]

Mitla is only about 30 miles from the city of Oaxaca via a good road. Combis, buses, and taxis are all good ways to get to Mitla. 

By bus[edit]
Second-class buses run about every 15 minutes throughout the day, departing from the Central de Abastos in Oaxaca. Fares start at about M$20. You can also wave down second-class buses that say "Mitla" on front as they pass along Hwy 190 (be sure you're on the side of the road heading towards Mitla).

By combi[edit]
Combis (colectivos) drive down Blvd. Jose Vasconcelos (MEX 190) in the city of Oaxaca with signs that say "Mitla" on the windshield. These run frequently all day and will also cost about M$20.

By taxi[edit]
A taxi is the most flexible and convenient way to travel and will cost about M$400. You can negotiate with drivers for a full day, which may give you time to explore other nearby towns such as Yagul (more Zapotec archaeological ruins) and Matatlán (lots of mescal distillers in the area).

Get around[edit]
Mototaxi in Mitla
Mitla is easy to get around by foot or bicycle. Most of the sites are in town and fairly close to each other, but a taxi is useful for visiting nearby villages or outlying sites. A taxi sitio is on Cempoaltepetl at Independencia, near the bus station. There are also mototaxis in Mitla. These three-wheel conveyances are a fun, economical way buzz around the town, assuming your life insurance is paid up.
Buses/combis to Hierve el Agua depart from Independencia at Aquiles Serdán. Get there early to get a good seat, or just show up when you're ready knowing that the bus doesn't leave until it's full (not a fixed schedule).

Drink[edit]
Mezcaleria in Mitla
Local restaurants often serve interesting regional beverages made with corn or chocolate. Tepache is popular in this area: it's a drink made with parts of the pineapple, sweetened with piloncillo, and usually fermented (though non-alcoholic versions are available).
The drink of choice in Mitla, as in most of Oaxaca is mezcal. Mezcal is elevated to an artform in Oaxaca and many towns have palenques, which are small scale distilleries where they roast the agave pinas, crush them with a huge stone wheel, ferment, distill, age, bottle, and sell all in one place. These are family run businesses that have made mezcal their own way for generations. You will find them in San Pablo Villa de Mitla, as well as shops selling local mezcals, bars serving only mezcal, and even a fewer larger-than-a-garage producers calling themselves "fabricas" (factories). Mezcal in Oaxaca can be the epicurious adventure of a lifetime, or you can just start by trying a glass while you're passing through town. If you want to delve a bit deeper, the small town of Matatlán is just five miles away and has a bumper crop of palenques and mezcalerias.
