Mining began here in the late 1800s, first with gold and later copper. It remains an important industry and the main employer. In 2005-06, Copper Mines of Tasmania produced 2.6 million tonnes of copper concentrate. Tourism is a growing industry, 
Queenstown is the base of the West Coast Wilderness Railway (an Abt - rack railway), which runs to Strahan and draws large numbers of tourists. The original railway, used to transport ore from the mines to the port at Regatta Point/Strahan, closed and was removed in the 1960s. It was restored and reopened in the early '90s.  Services were suspended in winter 2013 for repairs, but they recommenced after completion. 
Queenstown is an interesting town, nestled in the Queen River valley. Summers can be hot and can reach 30+ degrees, although it is not uncommon to have snow on Mt Owen in December. Winters are cool and wet, with snow falling regularly on the peaks on the West Coast Range that can be seen from the town. It is not uncommon for the roads into Queenstown to be blocked, and  for the town cut off for short periods during the middle of winter. The best time to visit is between December and April.
Many of the early buildings remain and a stroll around town is a must if you want a sense of what the town was like during the height of the copper mining operations.
The drive in to Queenstown over Gormanston Hill is a startling introduction to the town. The barren landscape was brought about by the combination of tree removal for the smelters, and the subsequent years of pollution. Trees were logged to fuel the furnaces of the smelters in the early years. Then large amounts of sulphur from the smelting process polluted the soils, killing much of the ground vegetation. Heavy rainfall of the area washed away most of the topsoil. The combination of the effects of tree removal, heavy rains, smelter fumes and uncontrolled bushfires, are evident in the bare ground areas that are spread across the foothills of Mount Lyell and Mount Owen to this day.
Queenstown is a great stopover when visiting the West Coast, with many West Coast attractions only a short drive away. Queenstown has a good range of places to stay, as well as very picturesque drives to the nearby attractions.
Strahan is  just over 40km, Zeehan about 30 km, Cradle Mountain and Lake St Clair just under 100 km. The Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park is also nearby. The trout fishing at man-made Lake Burbury is world class.

Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
Buses from Hobart run twice weekly, on Tuesdays and Fridays. Buses from Burnie run to Queenstown daily. Check timetables for the latest information.

By car[edit]
From the east
The drive from Hobart takes 3.5 to 4 hours (depending upon conditions), taking you through towns such as New Norfolk, Hamilton, Ouse and Derwent Bridge before winding its way through the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park, part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. 
Leaving the park, and driving around the eastern foot of Mount Owen, and up Linda valley with Mount Lyell to the north and Mount Owen to the south, you come to the ghost towns of Linda and Gormanston, both of which were large communities during the early mining booms. Of particular interest are the ruins of the Royal Hotel at Linda.
Once past Gormanston the road becomes a narrow and winding affair, where all caution should be taken, but this is also where the spectacular views of the surrounding barren hills of Queenstown begin.
Once over Gormanston hill there is a lookout on your left which takes in views of Queenstown and the Queen River Valley. It is well worth a stop for photos, be careful of the wind.  In wet and rainy weather look behind you to see the Horsetail Falls that come down the north western slopes of Mount Owen.
Once out of the Linda Valley, and past the lookout you drive down the winding road with on the right hand side, the tree stumps in the clay from one hundred years ago, and down past the black slag heap and into Queenstown.

From the north
From Burnie it is a 2.5hr drive along the A10, which takes you through the village of Tullah, where you first get to see Mt Murchison as it looms up ahead of you. Past Tullah you have a choice of routes. The A10 takes you on to Rosebery and over Mt Black or you can take the B28 around Lake Plimsoll, where there are spectacular views of Cradle Mountain National Park and the Franklin River World Heritage area. Both drives are on excellent road surfaces, although a little windy in places. The Lake Plimsoll road is about 15km shorter than the A10 into Queenstown.
The two routes above are only a guide (as well as the time it might take) and that a number of others can be taken from Launceston.

Hazards
Regardless of which route you take, and depending on what time of year that you travel, weather and road conditions should be taken into account. 
Also if you are driving the roads for the first time, it is well worth avoiding night driving in winter. Also first time drivers must be aware of the narrowness of the road, and sections of very sharp and sudden bends where speed can be a serious problem.
Consider that around the next corner rock fall or black ice hazards that suddenly confront the unexpecting driver.
The roads around Queenstown can be covered in ice and snow during winter and right up to early December.
Wildlife also frequent all roads into and out of Queenstown. 
Please drive carefully and obey speed limits and caution signs.

By bicycle[edit]
The more adventurous do travel by bike, and the previous car information is valuable to take note of. The hills are steep in places, whether coming from the east coast or the north coast.  There is very little room to negotiate with vehicles in parts, and caution is advised the same as for cars above.
If you are fit, and adequately equipped, bicycle trips through the mountains before and after Queenstown are exhilarating and well worth the effort in good weather.

By train[edit]
The West Coast Wilderness Railway operates as a tourist attraction between Queenstown and Strahan, a distance of 34 km.  There are a range of journey options - from Strahan and Queenstown.
The original ordinary railway connection between Queenstown and the rest of Tasmania closed in 1960.
Most journeys on the railway utilise Queenstown as the base to travel from. There is also a service from Strahan as the base.

By plane[edit]
Strahan Airport - Although helicopter and fixed-wing flights operate from here for charter flights into the south-west wilderness area, or over locations in western Tasmania, there are no scheduled passenger services to Strahan from other airports in Tasmania.  Queenstown also has an airstrip, which was used in the past as a regular stopping place, but now is only used sometimes in emergencies.
