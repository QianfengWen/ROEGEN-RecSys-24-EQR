Welcome to Sutherland!
Sutherland is a small town in Lincoln County, Nebraska.  The 2005 population was 1,223, and Sutherland has been named the fastest growing community in Nebraska outside of the Omaha/Lincoln metro area.


Understand[edit]
As is true for most small towns in the Platte River valley of Nebraska, the earliest history of Sutherland can be traced to the westward migration.  The Oregon-California trail generally ran south of the South Platte river, while the Mormon trail ran north of the North Platte river.  In 1843, the Oregon-California trail began to see heavy traffic, and in 1847, the first contingent of Mormons traversed the trail.
O’Fallon’s Bluff, just southeast of Sutherland, was a famous landmark referred to by many travelers in their journals.  In the days of the trails, the river ran along the base of the bluff.  Wagons would converge in this bottle-neck from along a fairly wide path and move single-file between the bluff and the river.
During the years 1858 to 1860, there was a trading post, stage station and Post Office near O’Fallon’s Bluff.  By 1866, troops sent to protect the wagon trains from ambush near O’Fallon’s Bluff had established Fort Heath.  In 1867, the O’Fallon’s railroad siding, depot and Post Office were built north of the river opposite the bluff.  It included a trading post and saloon.  In 1869, after the completion of the overland railroad, “Cody Siding” was established along the Union Pacific near the site of present-day Sutherland.
Though the settlement was quite well established, it was not until 1891 that the railroad platted an official “town”.  A post office was established in 1892, and the village of Sutherland, named for railroad official George Sutherland, was incorporated in 1905.
Though it was once a thriving community that boasted an opera house, several hotels, a movie theater, a bowling alley and numerous stores, Sutherland has developed into a bedroom community for the larger town of North Platte 25 miles east.
The primary occupation in the area is farming and ranching, although a large number of people are employed at Nebraska Public Power District’s Gerald Gentleman generation station five miles south of Sutherland, and at Union Pacific’s Bailey Railroad Yard, located in North Platte.
The ethanol industry is very important to Sutherland, with an existing plant producing nearly 25 million gallons of ethanol annually, and an expansion underway to produce 120 million gallons from corn grown locally.

See[edit]
41.1364-101.0951 O'Fallon's Bluff. A section of hills along the South Platte River near Sutherland. Because the bluffs come very close to the river, early travelers were forced to traverse the bluffs above the bottom land. Some of the most clearly defined and well preserved remnants of the Oregon-California Trail remain here as evidence of the great westward migration of the mid-nineteenth century. Ruts can clearly be seen at the eastbound Interstate 80 rest area one mile east of the Sutherland interchange. On the National Register of Historic Sites.   
 Sutherland State Aid Bridge, 30 onto East County Rd. The significance of this bridge to the history of Nebraska bridge building can hardly be overstated. This remarkable structure is significant as perhaps the best remaining example of the state aid bridges. Although some 77 structures were built throughout the state under this program between 1912 and 1936, only 17 remain in use. The Sutherland Bridge is also technologically significant as the best example in the state of concrete arch construction. Moreover, of the 17 multiple-span concrete arch bridges built under the state aid program in the 1910s and 1920s, all but the Sutherland Bridge have been destroyed or substantially altered, leaving this structure as the sole intact example of this important construction trend. Located five miles north of Sutherland on Prairie Trace Road. At the far east edge of Sutherland, just east of Ozzie's General Store, turn north off of Highway This road becomes Prairie Trace, and is paved all the way to the Sutherland State Aid Bridge, which is still the only crossing of the North Platte River. Local school kids frequently "decorate" this bridge with graffiti. 
 Mormon Trail Ruts. Just a quarter of a mile north of the Sutherland State Aid Bridge on Prairie Trace Road. These are some of the best preserved ruts on the Mormon Trail. There is an informational panel marking the spot. While the ruts are on private land, if you do no damage, you can cross the fence and walk in the ruts. Be careful there can be rattle snakes in this area, and even though the Sand Hills ground looks tough, it is very delicate and easily damaged.
