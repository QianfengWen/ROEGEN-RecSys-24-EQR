Monchique is a spa town in the Algarve. Monchique is the main town of the Serra de Monchique, the mountain range that separates the Algarve from Alentejo and the rest of Portugal to the north.  Unspoiled by mass tourism, the area still has the yesteryear charm. It is a magnet however on weekends for the many Portuguese that live on the coast, they visit to eat traditional food in first class restaurants, fill bottles with water from the many roadside springs and take in the air and views.


Understand[edit]


Monchique (mohn-SHEE-k(ih), /mõ.ˈʃi.kɨ/) is a region with its own micro climate and produces cherries, chestnuts, oranges, lemons, peaches and olives. Rugs, pottery, chestnut scissor chairs, honey, cork, timber, bottled mineral water, Sienito granite, black pork and smoked sausages are some of the crafts and industries in Monchique.
Many Northern Europeans including the British have settled in reasonable numbers here, giving the town a distinct cosmopolitan feel. Often referred to as the "Garden of the Algarve" or the "Algarves best kept secret", it is a nature lovers' paradise and heaven for cyclists and hikers.

Get in[edit]
From the southern Algarve coastal strip, Monchique is a 20- to 30-minute drive from Portimao, following the EN266 road which winds its way up into the hills. This road is served by a regular bus service.
There is also a 37.32012-8.552271 helipad to the north-west of the town centre on Estrada de Saboia.
