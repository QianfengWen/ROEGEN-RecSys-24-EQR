Neumünster is the fourth largest city in Schleswig-Holstein with a population of approx. 77.000. It is located in the center of Schleswig-Holstein, 40 km south of Kiel and 60 km north of Hamburg.


Understand[edit]
The name Neumünster is derived from the latin "novam monasterium" (new monastery). Founded in 1127 as a monastery the city grew rapidly in the second half of the 19th century as a centre of industry (iron works, leather and textile industry, rail service workshops). Today the city's economy is based on a modern mix of industries. Approximately 40 percent of the city were destroyed by allied bombings in World War II so there is no historic district today.
Since the 19th century Neumünster is an important hub for street and rail traffic in Schleswig-Holstein.
