St Winefride's Well. Bathing pool and changing tents.
Holywell (Welsh: Treffynnon) is a market town and pilgrimage destination in Flintshire. Its name refers to St. Winefride' Well, which is said to have healing powers and has gained to town the title "Lourdes of Wales". The 16th century shrine that was built around the spring is just one of many historic monuments around, making this a charming and interesting village. Its beautiful surroundings also make it an excellent base for hikers and bikers looking to explore the Wales countryside.
