Harrison Hot Springs is a village and vacation resort area in the Fraser Valley at the south end of Harrison Lake. Visitors and locals alike are drawn by the picturesque lake, the beach, recreation opportunities, camping, and, of course, the hot springs.


Understand[edit]
The area and hot springs were first known to and used by the Chehalis First Nations people. Low-key resort development began after the Canadian Pacific Railway was built through Agassiz, making the area more accessible. Development has increased, but the village is still small (fewer than 2,000 people). It remains a popular spot to get away to and can be very busy on summer weekends.

Get in[edit]
49°18′11″N 121°47′10″WMap of Harrison Hot Springs
From Highway 1, exit at Hwy 9 (exit 135) and follow it north to Agassiz.  From there, follow Hot Springs Road north to the lake.  If you're on Hwy 7, turn onto Hot Springs Road in Agassiz.  The drive from Vancouver will take about 1½-2 hours, depending on traffic.

Get around[edit]
The village is compact so walking is the easiest way to get around. Hot Springs Road is the main street out of town and Esplanade Ave, along the beach, has many of the motels and restaurants. The public hot springs pool is at the intersection of these two roads.

Do[edit]
Harrison Public Hot Pool
Not surprisingly, many of the activities in Harrison Hot Springs revolve around water -- relaxing in the hot springs, swimming, kayaking, cruising the lake, to name a few. But there's plenty more you can do if you want to stay dry.
