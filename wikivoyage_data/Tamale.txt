Tamale is Ghana's third city (and second largest in area) and the capital of Northern Ghana. Tamale has been voted three consecutive times by the Ghana Tourist Board as the cleanest city in Ghana and is proud of its well organized road networking in comparison to other cities and regions through Ghana. There are many things to do inside the city. Many visitors also use Tamale as a launching point for visits to Mole National Park, Tongo Hills, and the Paga Crocodile Pond.
The city has grown a conglomeration of villages with architectural blend of traditional mud houses to one with modern buildings, international airport, and several offices of multinational organizations and companies.

Get in[edit]
Bolga Road in downtown Tamale
Public bus from Accra or Kumasi is cheap and safer than the many private bus drivers. It takes 11 hours from Accra, leaving around 8AM so make sure you make a bathroom stop on the lunch stop as you might not be able to otherwise.
You can also take a direct flight to Tamale from Accra using Fly540Africa.
Private car from any medium sized town with driver is only about GH₵30 a day.

Yellow-yellows (motorised cycle rickshaws) are ubiquitous, and for a shared ride you can get from "town" (the centre) to anywhere in Tamale for GH₵6 or less. If you're new to the system, confirm the price before getting in.  Make sure you tell the driver that you want a shared ride, otherwise prices will skyrocket.  You can also take the red-and-yellow branded taxis.

Buy[edit]
Market on Main Street: The best of products can be found on the main streets of Tamale especially during weekends. However it takes a lot of energy to walk around for specific items and also having to negotiate. Make it a point to ask the locals the price range of products before entering the market since prices could be high at times for perceived strangers. If you ever have to bargain, don't be desperate because there is another seller somewhere who can give you a better option but be sure not to get a reduction in price after wandering and returning to the earlier seller you bargained with. Sometimes you have to behave like someone who is walking away to get a better price. You can find Cobblers, textiles and lots of food joints dotted around. Worth going into for the look of it alone and you may be hassled to 'buy Yam!' especially if you are a woman.
Wander around a bit and you will find music shops selling tapes of the current Ghanaian charts, worth bringing a few home to remind yourself of the sunny, almost Jamaican style music being played everywhere.
