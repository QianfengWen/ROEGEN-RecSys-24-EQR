Davis Av in downtown Elkins
Elkins is a city of 7,000 people (as of 2020) in Randolph County, West Virginia. It is home to Davis & Elkins College, a small private college. Because of its size and convenient location, you'll likely want to use Elkins as a base to get to a variety of nearby sights and attractions.
Elkins is convenient to the Monongahela National Forest.  It is less than an hour from the tiny high elevation twin towns of Thomas and Davis, noted for Blackwater Falls State Park, the Canaan Valley, Timberline Ski Resort and the region's caverns.  One hour South will bring you to Snowshoe Mountain.


Understand[edit]
It was incorporated in 1890, and named for Stephen Benton Elkins, a US senator from 1891 to 1893 who came from West Virginia. Elkins is the county seat of Randolph County, and as the largest city for a significant distance in any direction; nearby Buckhannon is slightly smaller and the nearest city larger than Elkins is Clarksburg.
