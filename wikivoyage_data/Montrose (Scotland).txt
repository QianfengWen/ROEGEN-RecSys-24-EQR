Montrose is a small port in Angus, Northeast Scotland, midway between Dundee and Aberdeen. It was an important harbour in medieval and Hanseatic times and contributed to Britain's sea and air defence in 20th-century wartime. It's industrial, with the pharmaceutical firm GSK being a major employer, and in 2020 had a population of almost 12,000.


Get in[edit]
The Basin seen from the train
Aberdeen (ABZ IATA) has a good choice of UK and European flights. Edinburgh (EDI IATA) is further but has more choice, and with a rental car you exit straight onto the road north and can reach Montrose in little over two hours. Dundee (DND IATA) is the closest airport but has few flights.  
Trains run from Edinburgh and Glasgow Queen Street via Dundee and Arbroath every 30 min to Montrose, and continue north to Stonehaven and Aberdeen. The Caledonian Sleeper from London Euston also sets down here around 7AM, with the southbound train picking up towards 10:30PM. 
This railway line was closed for 12 weeks following a landslide and serious rail accident near Stonehaven in 2020.
The 56.713-2.4721 railway station is east side of town centre, with a nice view of the Basin as the train pulls in.
Stagecoach Bus X7 runs along the coast from Perth via Dundee and Arbroath to Montrose, continuing to Stonehaven and Aberdeen. It runs hourly, daily. There isn't a bus station, just stops on High St and elsewhere. Buses from Edinburgh, Glasgow and England fly past on A90 and don't serve Montrose, you need to change at Dundee. 
Montrose is 30 miles northeast of Dundee on A92. The Dundee-Aberdeen road A90 sweeps several miles inland past Brechin.

See[edit]
Edzell Castle
 Montrose Museum, Panmure Place DD10 8HF, ☏ +44 1674 907447. Local history museum and art gallery in a neo-classical 1842 building. Free. (updated Nov 2020)
Old and St Andrews Church on High St is Church of Scotland. It opened in 1793, and the steeple was added in 1834.
Bamse stands guard at the bridge entering town. Why was a movie never made about this dog, whose wartime exploits with the Free Norwegian Forces far surpass the deeds of Black Bob, Greyfriars Bobby and Rin-Tin-Tin combined? A huge St Bernard, Bamse (which means "teddy-bear") was an official crew member of Thorodd, a whaler drafted into wartime use which escaped to Britain in 1940 when Norway surrendered to Germany. The ship then served as a minesweeper working out of Montrose and Dundee, with Bamse its most diligent Shore Patrol, breaking up fights, travelling unescorted on the buses to round up crew members from outlying pubs, rescuing people from the water, and repelling a knife-wielding assailant. He became the symbol of Norwegian resistance and it's probably only because of military secrecy that we've yet to hear of his role in defusing UXBs, unmasking spies, cracking ciphers and piddling on quislings. Bamse died aged 7 in 1944 and was buried with full military honours and crowds of well-wishers lining the cortege route.
William Lamb Studio is on Market St. Lamb (1893-1951) was a sculptor, briefly famous (he sculpted the young Princess Elizabeth), but he was scarred by World War I and became a recluse in Montrose. The studio is open by appointment or for special events (Nov 2023).
56.726-2.4621 Air Station Heritage Centre, Waldron Rd DD10 9BD, ☏ +44 1674 678222. W Sa 10AM-4PM. This was a military airbase from 1914, among the first in Britain. It was set up in 1913 in Dysart a few miles south, but that site was foggy and boggy so it was re-located here. In World War II it was a training base for overseas pilots, and RAF sorties to Norway flew from Montrose. But there was little new building or war damage in those years, so it's a rare survival of a pre-World War I airbase. The Spitfire is just a replica, it was string-and-paper SE5A/B biplanes in that era. Adult £6. (updated Nov 2020)
56.708-2.5032 Montrose Basin is the tidal lagoon formed by the estuary of the South Esk, west side of town. It's almost 3 miles in diameter, ringed by salt marshes, and an important habitat for resident and migratory birds.

56.73-2.6556 Brechin. It has a cathedral with an 11th-century Round Tower — they're common in Ireland but only two survive in Scotland. There's also a small town museum. Brechin Castle and its gardens can be visited in late May and early June. (updated Mar 2023)
56.7091-2.73937 Davidson Legacy: Harley-Davidson motorcycles were founded in Milwaukee in 1903 by William S Harley and Arthur Davidson. Arthur was the son of William C Davidson (1846–1923), who grew up in this small cottage before emigrating to Wisconsin. It's been converted into a museum depicting that period, and you can stay over.
Aberlemno Sculptured Stones: see Forfar for these richly carved medieval Pictish stones southwest of Brechin.
Montrose Beach is long and sandy, but beach, sandhills and golf course are succumbing to erosion by the sea.
56.654-2.5028 Lunan Bay is a little settlement two miles south of Montrose, with a much better beach. By the outflow of Lunan Water stands Red Castle, a medieval hunting lodge — it's utterly tumbledown, don't get close.
56.811828-2.6800199 Edzell Castle, Edzell DD9 7UE (5 miles north of Brechin). Apr-Sep: daily 9:30AM-5:30PM. Charming ruin of a 16th-century tower house in rose sandstone.

Connect[edit]
Mobile coverage has developed along A90 inland, so Brechin has 4G from all UK carriers. Montrose and the coast are less well served: as of Aug 2021, you'll get 4G with EE or O2 and manage a call with Vodafone, but Three has no signal. 5G has not reached this area.
