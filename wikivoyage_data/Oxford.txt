Oxford is the oldest university city in the United Kingdom, some 50 miles (80 km) to the west of the capital London in its own county of Oxfordshire, on the rivers Thames and Cherwell. Together with Cambridge (the second oldest university city and Oxford's great rival), Oxford has long represented the English academic establishment and elite ("Oxbridge"), a haven of tradition and endeavour. Oxford's famous "Dreaming Spires" refer to the medieval churches and colleges that dominate the bustling modern town in all their Gothic splendour. Picturesque architecture and a vibrant modern life, driven by students, light industry and technology, all set in the rolling countryside of Oxfordshire, make this a great destination.

The Radcliffe Camera, Oxford
History[edit]
Oxford was first occupied in Saxon times, and was known as "Oxanforda". The settlement began with the foundations of St Frideswide's nunnery in the 8th century, and was first mentioned in written records in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for the year 912. By the 10th century Oxford had become an important military frontier town between the kingdoms of Mercia and Wessex and was on several occasions raided by the Danes.
The University of Oxford was founded in the 12th century and therefore constitutes the oldest English-speaking university. Oxford, like Cambridge, differs from many other universities in that there is no 'campus' as such, and no central university building. Instead, the university consists of approximately 40 colleges and associated buildings, such as the Exam Schools (on the High Street: closed to the public), the world-famous Bodleian Library (main buildings in Radcliffe Square, off the High Street: limited access to the public), and several world-class museums. Each college has its own individual character, some date from the 13th century, others are merely a few decades old.  Many of the colleges are closed to the public, particularly during term times, but some are open at different times. For example: Christ Church (the college of "Brideshead" fame) is mostly open, and has the added bonus of having a (small) cathedral attached, where excellent music is performed at Evensong everyday; it also has an excellent art gallery. Some of Christ Church's buildings are used in films such as Harry Potter. Other colleges of note are Magdalen (pronounced 'maudlin'), which has a deer park, and those along the High Street, all of which have an impressive list of alumni. Shelley fans should visit University College. Former women-only colleges such as the pretty Somerville (Woodstock Rd) further to the north of the centre are interesting to get a feel for the range of colleges in Oxford.
During World War II, Oxford was spared from the German carpet bombing that levelled many other British cities, making it one of the best-preserved medieval cities in the United Kingdom. The city has a population of 150,000, and the metro area 244,000.

Orientation[edit]
One of the best online resources for planning a visit to Oxford is the Virtual Tour of Oxford, hosted by the university's chemistry department.

Central Oxford[edit]
Central Oxford is bound to the west and south by the River Thames, which in Oxford is known as the Isis, and to the east by the Cherwell, which confluents into the Isis at Boathouse Island, a centre for university rowing. The city centre is built around two intersecting thoroughfares which cross at Carfax:

the High Street — running east–west, this is the main road coming in from Headington and Cowley.
George Street — runs west from the centre and is known for the New Theatre and its restaurants
Running north–south is another road, essentially continuous, but with separate ancient names for its various stretches — St Aldates and St Giles, separated by Cornmarket (now a pedestrianised shopping boulevard).
Surrounding districts[edit]
Jericho is an affluent area just north of city centre. Jericho is home of the Oxford University Press and its museum. It also has plenty of nightlife, including pubs and cocktail bars.
Summertown is an affluent area north of central Oxford. Most of Summertown is directly on the Banbury Road, however there are shops and restaurants on the side roads such as the South Parade.
Kidlington is north of Summertown. It is apparently Britain's largest village. It has a small high street with a Tesco's and Co-operative supermarket, several pubs, resaurants and a large Sainsbury's supermarket.
Wolvercote is an affluent village to the north-west of Oxford. It has a church, three pubs (The Plough, The White Hart and Jacobs' Inn), a village store and a common for walking on.
Headington is to the east, perhaps most notable for one of Oxford Brookes University's main campuses. It has a small high street and Thornhill Park & Ride nearby. There is also a house with a large shark sculpture in the roof, located just off the high street, which may be of interest.
Botley and Osney are west of the train station. Much of the area is industrialised and therefore uninteresting to tourists. However the area has the city's Waitrose store and several retail parks such as Botley Retail Park and Seacourt Tower Park, along with Seacourt Park & Ride nearby.
Cowley, to the south east of the city, has a plethora of restaurants, pubs and shops, many of which are independent. Confusingly the term Cowley can refer to two distinct areas: the area along the Cowley Road to the east of Magdalen Bridge tends to be more commercial and student focussed (and is the part which appeals more to tourists), while the suburbs to the south east of this are more residential and working class. In this more outlying area is Plant Oxford where cars have been made for over 100 years, the Templars Square Shopping Centre (and nearby Templars Retail Park), and the Oxford Retail Park with a large 24-hour (on weekdays) Tesco supermarket.
Blackbird Leys is south of Cowley. It is a social housing (housing projects) area and is generally not recommended to tourists. However the Kassam Stadium, home to Oxford United F.C., and the Ozone Leisure Park nightlife complex opposite may justify a trip.
Get in[edit]
All Souls College
By road[edit]
Oxford is linked to London by the 50-mile (80-km) south-eastern stretch of the M40 motorway. The journey takes 50–90 min, depending on traffic, which can be heavy. The north-western continuation of the M40 conveniently links Oxford with England's second largest city, Birmingham, and the West Midlands.
Parking and access restrictions are very stringent on the narrow streets of central Oxford, policed by both wardens and cameras, with heavy fines applicable. The one-way traffic systems are circuitous and confusing, making it difficult to get around by car. An alternative is to use one of the five municipal park and ride sites which are located on the outskirts of all sides of Oxford, and are well signposted. Park and ride sites are open 24/7, and you can park there for a maximum of 72 hours. Forget about using the Thornhill Park and Ride on weekdays; it is invariably full. The first hour's parking is free, after which you pay £2 for up to 12 hours, £4 for up to 24 hours, and so on. In addition, the return bus trip to the city centre costs £2.80. (May 2022).
Since February 2022, a zero-emission zone (ZEZ) closed to non-electric cars has been under trial in the city centre, albeit on streets which are essentially pedestrianised, making it easy to avoid for the time being. However, the council has plans to expand this zone to enclose much of the centre of Oxford.

By train[edit]
Wikivoyage has a guide to Rail travel in Great Britain
51.7534-1.27031 Oxford railway station. A large station that is located immediately west of the city centre and south of Jericho. Fast First Great Western trains run to and from London Paddington every half an hour, the trip takes about an hour. Commonly, these trains call at Reading, Slough (for Windsor Castle), and Didcot Parkway, though not all trains call at each of these stations. Without a railcard, tickets to London cost £20 off peak and £40 at peak times, although you can buy tickets for about £4 if you book in advance online. There are also stopping services to London calling at a large number of stations, which run every hour and take about 90 min. First Great Western also runs approximately hourly trains on the Cotswold line to Worcester.   (updated Mar 2022)
51.8042-1.27452 Oxford Parkway railway station. A service from Oxford to London Marylebone by Chiltern Railways calls at & Bicester Village. Journey time is just over 1 hour.   (updated Mar 2022)
Cross Country Trains run through Oxford, mostly running to/from Manchester and Southampton. These trains run approximately half-hourly in both directions until about 9PM. All of these trains stop at Reading going south, and Leamington Spa for Warwick and Warwick Castle, and Birmingham going north.

By bus[edit]
51.7541-1.26223 Gloucester Green. This bus station offers buses to locations all over England making it very convenient to get out of Oxford. Buses leave from here to London, Heathrow, Gatwick, Luton, Stansted and other national destinations. Most long-distance buses do not take credit cards, so make sure you have enough cash, but most services to London, Heathrow, and Cambridge also accept contactless cards.   

Oxford Tube[edit]
The Oxford Tube is an excellent way of travelling between London and Oxford. The service runs almost 24 hours a day, though be mindful of rush hour.
The express coach service between London and Oxford is called the Oxford Tube, and is run by Stagecoach. The "Tube" runs very frequently and the journey time is usually 100 min (longer during rush hours).
There are frequent and comfortable coach services that run from several convenient bus stops to Gloucester Green coach station in Oxford. They normally start at the London Victoria station, running westward and parallel to the London Underground Central line via Marble Arch, Notting Hill, Shepherd's Bush and then Hillingdon. Before arriving in Oxford, there is one last stop at Lewkner. Stops in Oxford include Thornhill Park & Ride, Headington, Oxford Brookes University, St. Clements, High Street (Queens Lane) (which is best for daily visitors, as it is right in the middle of the majority of University Colleges) and finally the Gloucester Green bus station, which is also well situated. 
As of Feb 2023, prices for the Oxford Tube are £12/£11/£4 for an adult/concession/under-16 one-way and £18/£16/£7 for an adult/concession/under-16 period return ticket. Some peak-time journeys take slightly different routes in London, so the place that you want to go to/from may influence when you board the coach. If you wish to travel late at night, the Oxford Tube runs 24 hours a day. You can also book London to Oxford coach travel through Megabus.com, but you'll be travelling on an Oxford Tube coach.

The Airline[edit]
There are regular bus services between Oxford and London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports with The Airline, run by Oxford Bus Company.

Stagecoach X5[edit]
There is also an X5[dead link] bus between Oxford and Bedford (via Milton Keynes), taking approximately two hours, along with the S6 service to Swindon. Several coaches in other parts of the country are run by National Express.

Stagecoach S2[edit]
Another useful (but infrequent) service is the S2, which travels using the A40 from Cheltenham to Oxford via Charlton Kings, Andoversford, Northleach, Burford, Witney and Eynsham, which runs from the bus station about every two hours and takes approximately an hour and three quarters.
This is operated by Stagecoach and it is possible to buy a day ticket for it which allows you unlimited travel on it and allows you to make connecting journeys anywhere on Stagecoach's buses in Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, or Wiltshire.

Local Stagecoach buses[edit]
Local buses to Bicester, Blenheim Palace, and Banbury are run by Stagecoach, and depart from Magdalen Street, near Cornmarket. There are also bus services to Reading, Abingdon, and Didcot run by the Oxford Bus Company from St Aldate's, also in the city centre.

By plane[edit]
51.837298-1.3192984 Oxford Airport (OXF  IATA) at Kidlington is used mainly for private and charter aircraft and has only intermittently had scheduled airline flights; it is useful only if you fly your own plane, or are able to charter a small aircraft.
The nearest commercial airports are those around London, to the south-east, or Birmingham, to the north, with most foreign travellers preferring London.
Heathrow (LHR IATA) is the closest major airport, followed by Gatwick (LGW IATA) in terms of size and popularity. Road access from both Heathrow and Gatwick (fastest) is by M25 (heading north and west respectively) and then the M40 to Oxford's outskirts (follow the signs).
Oxford Bus Company runs several airport bus services called The Airline to Oxford Gloucester Green bus station (running in from Thornhill Park & Ride, then Headington and up the High St with several convenient stops: check web pages below). The Oxford Bus Company recommend allocating a minimum of an hour for between when the coach arrives and flight check-in:

 between London Heathrow and Oxford. generally every 30 minutes. Travels to Heathrow Terminal 5 and then Heathrow Central bus station. The route takes an average of 1 hour 20 minutes, but this can be increased due to traffic congestion. The Oxford Bus Company recommend stopping at the Heathrow Central bus station for Terminals 2&3. For Terminal 4, there's a free shuttle bus from Terminal 5 that leaves from bus stand 7. £23 single, £30 return. (updated Nov 2018)
 between London Gatwick and Oxford. hourly 7AM-11PM, less frequently thereafter. Travels to Gatwick South Terminal and then Gatwick North Terminal. The route takes an average of 2 hours and 30 minutes, but this can be increased due to traffic congestion. £28 single, £37 return. (updated Nov 2018)
National Express bus company runs airport bus services to Luton Airport (LTN IATA) and to Stansted Airport (STN IATA).
Birmingham Airport (BHX IATA) has fewer destinations compared to the London airports (it still has quite a lot), but it is the closest to Oxford in terms of public transport travel time. Birmingham Airport has its own railway station called Birmingham International, which is connected to the airport terminal building via the free AirRail Link cable car shuttle, taking 1–2 min. From the railway station, trains depart to Oxford every hour between 6:14AM and 10:14PM and take about an hour. A non-advance, non-rail card single costs £25.50, a return £28.80 off-peak or £51 any time. You could do a lot cheaper by booking an advance ticket though (but be careful as tickets are valid only on the booked train, so if your flight is late and you miss the train, you will have to buy another ticket).

Get around[edit]

Oriel College
On foot[edit]
Oxford city centre is very compact and easily walkable. Many areas of the city centre are pedestrianised, and all major tourist sights are well signposted.
That the narrow streets of the city centre are pedestrian-friendly, difficult for cars and full of beautiful buildings that will draw your attention upwards (rather than onto a more horizontal plane) does not mean that the roads of the city are overspill pavements. You will find most cyclists quite forgiving on this point as they are used to it and are often themselves pedestrians tempted to do the same as long as you suppress the urge to pass comment on any near-misses actually arising from your standing in the middle of the road.

By bicycle[edit]
The preferred mode of transport for the university student is the bicycle and, like Amsterdam or Copenhagen, there are hundreds of them. Most trains into Oxford allow bicycles to be carried for free. There are cycle lanes on most streets near the centre, however you will sometimes be sharing the road with other motorists. Though the bus traffic can be daunting, the familiarity of cyclists to local drivers makes cycling safer than it seems at first. The best option is to follow the locals as they know what they are doing. It is illegal for cyclists to run red lights (although many do) and you must use lights at night; local police frequently set up checkpoints and impose fines. Bike parking is available everywhere, but make sure you get a strong lock as bike theft is common. Avoid cable locks as they are cut through frequently, and try to avoid leaving your bike locked in the same place in public for an extended period of time (especially overnight), since unlocked wheels or even the saddle may be stolen.
If you expect your time in Oxford to be spent largely in the city centre, getting around on foot is often just as convenient as by bike due to the high density of pedestrians in the centre. Only if you plan to frequently venture to the outskirts of the city, for example to Summertown, Cowley, or Iffley, does a bike really become worth your while.

By scooter[edit]
Since at least 2022, a trial of electric scooters for hire has been running in central Oxford. These can be found at designated points across the city and unlocked using a smartphone app, and provide an inexpensive means of travel if you want to venture a little further out of the city centre. However, they must be used on the roads, which, coupled with the volume of road traffic, can make travelling this way fairly daunting.

By car[edit]
Avoid driving in central Oxford. Traffic is heavy, the one-way system is very confusing, the streets are often very narrow with restrictions, and parking is very expensive. Use the park and ride system, or forget the car and come in by public transport. If you have a motorcycle or a scooter, things are a little easier.

By bus[edit]
Buses leaving an Oxford park-and-ride
Local urban buses are mostly operated by the Oxford Bus Company (largely in the south and east of the city) and by Stagecoach (largely in the north and west). Fares are expensive and are charged by distance (starting at £1.10 single, £2 return (Oct 2018), pay the driver when boarding: cash or contactless; change is available), but if you plan on making more than two trips in one day, buy an all-day pass (£4.20, Oct 2018) to save money. The main hubs for local buses are the rail station and St Aldates.

Oxford Key[edit]
If you are in town a while, there is also a rechargeable smart-card known as the Oxford Key that gives discounted bus fares for a week, month, 13 weeks, or a year. It can take several hours for the Key to be ready once recharged.

CityZone[dead link] is the standard Key which allows travel only on Oxford Bus Company and Thames Travel buses, the radius covers as far north as most of Kidlington to as far south as Cowley, Kennington, and Blackbird Leys.
SmartZone allows the same travel as CityZone including Stagecoach buses (which is very convenient, particularly in rush hour).
CityZone Extra extends the CityZone radius to include as far north as Woodstock to as far south as Abingdon.
The Oxford Bus Company have two travel shops where you can top-up or ask questions in-person:

51.7539-1.26221 Gloucester Green Travel Shop, 89 Gloucester Green, OX1 2BU. M–F 8AM-6PM, Sa 9AM-5PM, Su 9AM-4PM. You can sign up for an Oxford Key, top it up in-store and purchase tickets for the Airline bus. (updated Jul 2020)
51.7541-1.25732 High Street Travel Shop, 44 - 45 High Street, OX1 4AP. 9:30AM-5:30PM. Only provides sightseeing information. (updated Jul 2020)
Park and ride[edit]
0°0′0″N 0°0′0″EMap of park and ride sites in Oxford
Oxford Bus Company operates several park and ride services for people visiting the city by car, because parking is difficult to find and expensive in the centre. 
The purple buses operate from 6AM to 11:30PM on weekdays and Saturdays. Return fares start at £2.80 per adult, and children travel free when accompanied. Parking charges apply at Pear Tree, Redbridge, and Seacourt.
Oxford has 5 park & ride bus stations:

By taxi[edit]
Oxford has Black Cabs (Hackney Carriage) which can be flagged down from the street or taken from taxi stands located around the city, and 'minicabs' which must be ordered by phone or app, 001 & Royal Cars are the most popular services. Black Cabs are quite pricey but are convenient for short hops if travelling in a big group. Minicabs are much cheaper for long-distance journeys; the fare should be agreed over the phone when booking or should be bargained with the driver for long distance, however within city the fare is set by meter within every taxi–never get in a minicab without agreeing the price.
Uber is not yet available in Oxford.

See[edit]
Visitors to Oxford should definitely visit at least one museum, visit at least one college and – if possible – hear one of the world-class college chapel choirs. A walking tour (see 'Do' below) is a good way of achieving this.

Landmarks[edit]
Hertford Bridge (aka the Bridge of Sighs)
51.754703-1.2573311 Bodleian Library. The main research library of the University of Oxford, the Bodleian is one of the oldest libraries in Europe (opened in 1602, based on the collection of Thomas Bodley), and in the UK is second in size only to London's British Library. The Bodleian now possesses numerous branches throughout the university; visiting bibliophiles will be most keen to peruse the central site, which includes Duke Humfrey's Library above the Divinity School, the Old Schools Quadrangle with its Great Gate and Tower, the Radcliffe Camera, Britain’s first circular library, and the Clarendon Building.   (updated May 2023)
51.75343-1.254012 Radcliffe Camera, Radcliffe Square. Built 1737–49, this is a library and reading room for Oxford students and so is not generally accessible. The grand exterior, however, is well worth viewing.   
51.75449-1.2537373 Hertford Bridge (Bridge of Sighs) (Hertford College). A quaint pedestrian bridge for the students of Hertford College which has popularly become known as the "Bridge of Sighs" of Oxford.   
51.754266-1.2549414 Sheldonian Theatre, Broad St. This unusual building was Sir Christopher Wren's first major architectural commission. At the time he was a professor of Astronomy at the university. There is a series of busts outside the theatre facing Broad St with strange expressions and facial hair.   (updated Jun 2023)
51.75764-1.2605425 Taylorian Institute (also known as the Taylor Institution), St Giles', OX1 3NA (corner of St Giles' and Beaumont St, opposite the Randolph Hotel). The university's centre for the study of modern European languages and literature, established in 1845. Its library contains the largest specialist collection in its field in Britain. It is in a neo-classical building designed by Charles R. Cockerell and erected between 1841 and 1844 by the university to house the institution and the Randolph Galleries (now the Ashmolean Museum).   
51.771061-1.2601676 Tolkien's House, 20 Northmoor Rd, OX2 6UR. Appointments only. Fantasy author J. R. R. Tolkien lived in this mansion from 1930 to 1947, and wrote The Hobbit here. For the uninitiated little more than an average house in a residential street, but a must see for Lord of the Rings fans. Free.   (updated Mar 2019)
51.752775-1.2559497 University Church of St Mary the Virgin, High St (entrances from the High and from Radcliffe Square), ☏ +44 1865 279112. Some of the best views of Oxford are afforded from the tower of the church, dating to 1280. The church, rebuilt in the 14th and 15th centuries (with various additions after this time), is full of architectural and historical interest. The church has a coffee shop, the Vaults and Garden, now re-opened under the management of Will Pouget (already known for his 'Alpha Bar' in the Covered Market) and specialising in organic food and fair trade tea and coffee.   
51.758889-1.2133338 The Shark House, 2 New High Street, OX3 7AQ (In Headington, 2 mi (3.2 km) E of city centre). 24 hours daily, but exercise common sense and respect for the neighbours. An ordinary terraced house in suburban Oxford, with a 25-foot shark buried face-first in the roof. Supposedly erected as an anti-war statement, this one-time controversial sculpture has become a much-loved public artwork and photo spot. Free.   (updated Aug 2022)
51.7785-1.29969 Godstow Abbey (Godstow Nunnery) (Walk north along the western bank of Port Meadow for roughly an hour, when starting from near the train station.). A nunnery dissolved during the Dissolution of the Monasteries and eventually abandoned during the English Civil War. A beautiful place to explore, as it is completely open and able to be wandered through. It was the final resting place of a mistress of Henry II.  (updated Jan 2024)
Colleges[edit]
Exeter College Chapel
Many Oxford colleges allow tourists to visit their grounds during certain hours and certain seasons, although some are closed to tourists at all times. During certain times of the year, those that do open their doors generally offer reduced public opening hours or are closed completely to tourists, especially during University terms (approximately October/November, January/February and May/June). This is particularly true in May/June, which is when examinations are taken. It is advisable to visit the college's website before visiting, or to enquire at Oxford's local tourist information office to be certain you are not disappointed.
Each college has a unique history and something interesting to offer in terms of striking architecture or historical notoriety.
Balliol, University, and Merton Colleges each claim to be the 'oldest' in the university, with founding dates in the 13th century, although the exact year may be unclear or contested. They are fine examples of the collegiate Gothic architecture for which Oxford is renowned.
Exeter College on Turl Street is an example of one of Oxford's smaller colleges. Built in 1314, it is also one of the oldest and in its front quad exemplifies collegiate architecture in Oxford. The Victorian neo-Gothic chapel is modelled on the Sainte Chapelle in Paris, and houses 'The Adoration of the Magi', the famous pre-Raphaelite tapestry by William Morris. The Fellows' Garden neighbours the Divinity School and the Bodleian Library and offers one of the best views in Oxford, over Radcliffe Square.
New College on Holywell Street is interesting for being the only college to be built straddling the ancient city wall, which cuts through the center of the grounds.
The Queen's College along High Street, founded in 1341, is renowned for its grand 18th-century Classical style architecture for which is unique among the ancient (medieval) colleges, which have otherwise each been rebuilt or expanded over the years in a largely Gothic or neo-Gothic style. Tourists are not admitted to this college.
All Souls, also along High Street, is famous not only for its striking towers, but also in that it does not accept undergraduate members, but rather elects only two graduate fellows each year based upon their performance in what has been described as the 'hardest exam in the world'.
Finally, two colleges (some of the largest and most famous in Oxford) that have somewhat established themselves as tourist destinations are Magdalen and Christ Church. You're as likely to see a tourist inside as a student, but they do offer regular visiting hours, tourist facilities, meticulously manicured and beautiful grounds, and ticket booths for charging admission fees.

51.750182-1.25666110 Christ Church, OX1 1DP. The college of Brideshead Revisited fame, Christ Church is an Early Modern period college founded in 1525 by Cardinal Wolsey as "Cardinal College". Noted for associations with Lewis Carroll (Alice in Wonderland) and was a location for the filming of the first Harry Potter film. Although not used for the actual filming, its Great Hall served as the inspiration for the design of the Great Hall of Hogwarts set in the Harry Potter film series. The Christ Church Meadows south of the college is a beautiful green space offering nice views of the spires and quiet corners to relax. Adults £16-19; seniors, children and students £15-18.   
51.752055-1.24750211 Magdalen College, eastern end of High St, ☏ +44 1865 276000. 1 October–21 June 1–6PM or dusk (whichever is earlier), 25 Jun–30 Sep noon–6PM, closed 22–24 June. Founded in 1458 by William of Waynflete, Bishop of Winchester, Magdalen (pronounced Mawdlin) is frequently the first college seen by many visitors if coming into Oxford on the London Road, its high tower serving as a much-loved landmark. A must-see is the glorious deer park and the gothic chapel. Significant Magdalen alumni include C.S. Lewis, Oscar Wilde, Seamus Heaney and Edward Gibbon. Visitor gift shop and afternoon café. Maximum 20 people in a group. Adults £5; seniors, children, students £4.

Do[edit]
Walking tours, starting from St Aldates in the city centre, are an excellent way of visiting some of the more famous colleges, such as Christ Church and Merton.  Independent general and ghost tours also start nearby in Broad Street. In general, a walking tour lasts about two hours and can cost around £20 plus college admission fees.

The Oxford Tourist Information Centre on Broad Street offers a Pottering in Harry's Footsteps tour.
The only Oxford-based Harry Potter walking tour is offered by the Oxford Tourist Information Centre. Like all the non-Oxford-based Potter tours, Duke Humfrey’s Library is not included (only Bodleian Library staff can lead visitors into this hallowed space). Harry Potter Places Book Two—OWLs: Oxford Wizarding Locations guides Potterites through the decision-making process required to enjoy all Oxford Harry Potter sites, including Duke Humfrey’s Library.

The Oxford Dodo — not as lively as the swifts
University Boat Races (usually W-Sa of Week 7 of Hilary Term and W-Sa of Week 5 of Trinity term - check www.ox.ac.uk for term dates) Twice a year, the river is taken over by the inter-college boat races. The races are a great way to experience the Oxford obsession with rowing first-hand. The river is full of people and there is a great atmosphere of college spirit. Races take place south of the city centre on the Isis, between Donnington Bridge and Christ Church Meadows. The best places to watch are either the towpath along the side of the river, or at the bottom of the meadows - both accessible by foot from the centre (about 10-15 minutes). Word of warning however for those watching along the towpath, the towpath is likely to be swarming with marshals and bike riders while the crews are racing. The towpath does however offer the best vantage points, particularly for the bumps races where crews will often 'bump out' halfway along the course. Most college boathouses will also be serving food and drink throughout the week of racing. Races take place 11AM-6PM, with the better boats racing later in the day.
Punting. In the summer, punting is an ever-popular activity, involving propelling a wooden boat along the river with a pole. You can also hire someone to do the punting for you, although it is easy and fun to do it yourself. Bring a bottle of wine and good balance along for a more interesting trip (although it helps to have a sober crew member along!) Punt rental is available from several locations in Oxford.
51.751414-1.2463422 Oxford Punting, Magdalen Bridge Boathouse, High St, OX1 4AU, ☏ +44 1865 202643, info@oxfordpunting.co.uk.

In the summer, check out the nesting swifts (birds) at the Oxford Museum of Natural History[dead link]. These elegant little birds have been nesting in ventilation flues in the tower of the University Museum for many years, providing a wonderful opportunity for scientists. Visitors to the museum between May and August can watch live pictures from three of the nests in the tower on a television monitor.

Pubs and bars[edit]
Oxford has many old pubs, as well as newer nightclubs.

Traditional pubs & inns[edit]
The Eagle and Child
The King's Arms
Oxford has a lot of traditional pubs and inns. While some are modern, many are hundreds of years old and are notable enough to have their own Wikipedia page.

51.750279-1.2425967 Angel and Greyhound, 30 St Clement's St, OX4 1AB. Popular with Friday evening after-work crowd, letting their hair down. In quieter moments good for board games. Food is average.

Popularly known as "the bird and baby", this pub was the frequent haunt of the Inklings, a group of Oxford literary dons that included C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien, authors of The Chronicles of Narnia and The Lord of the Rings respectively. Very atmospheric, with a great range of ales and the best pork scratchings you've ever tasted! As of January the 1st, 2024, the pub is indefinitely closed and has been for three years, though its ownership has indicated plans to reopen.   (updated Jan 2024)

Quite reasonably priced for its location, and often less busy than its literary fame would lead one to expect. Its kitchen was renovated in 2022.   (updated Jan 2024)

Quaint little pub used formerly as a coaching inn from the 17th century, still offers lodgings to those who need them to this day.

Nice beer garden with coal fires where you can roast marshmallows on chilly evenings in spring and autumn. This ancient pub (a favourite with Inspector Morse) is an unmissable Oxford institution that many consider to be the best pub in the city — in the summer watch out for drenched students enjoying the end of their exams. Pint >£5. Famously the location where U.S. president Bill Clinton "Did not inhale" marijuana during his time at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar.

Sleep[edit]
Oxford has a large number of B&Bs and guesthouses, located both centrally and in the suburbs. Check the website of the Oxford Association of Hotels and Guesthouses[dead link] to get some ideas of available options.
Most hotels in the city centre are pretty expensive, and you pay almost London prices. Book in advance if you are travelling in summer: accommodation can be scarce during high season. The tourist information office in the city centre can help find available accommodation for a small fee.

Budget[edit]

Stay safe[edit]
Although Oxford is an affluent university city and is generally very safe, as with any city care should be taken with personal belongings and surroundings.
Street crime in the centre of the city, with the exception of bicycle theft, is low, though proper precautions as would be followed in any other city should be taken. Avoid getting caught up in drunken revelry or street fights, and, remember, traffic is on the left (so look both ways). Oxford has a lot of student cyclists, especially during term time (January, February, April, May, October, and November), making hearing alone insufficient for checking whether a road is clear.
Though having seen improvement following local government investment, the suburb of Blackbird Leys on the southern outskirts of the city ranks amongst the 10% most deprived areas in the country, and has a higher rate of crime than one might expect in Oxford. Visitors are, however, unlikely to visit this area of the city other than on football matchdays.
Oxford has a relatively high rate of not only street performers but also beggars (though still a low number of the latter by international standards). Police advise not handing over money to those who expressly ask for it unless threatened.

Police stations[edit]
For emergencies, dial 999 or 112. For non-emergency situations use 101. 101 is a charged call.

51.748166-1.2562853 Police Station (St Aldates), St Aldates, Oxford, OX1 1SZ, ☏ +44 1865 841148. 8AM-10PM. Parking is for disabled badge holders only and fines are hefty. 
51.734451-1.2137644 Police Station (Cowley), Oxford Rd, OX4 2LE. 
51.813245-1.2785985 Police Station (Kidlington), Oxford Rd, Kidlington, OX5 2NX. M-F 8AM-5PM. Free parking available, closed on bank holidays. 
LGBT scene[edit]
Oxford has a small gay scene and a gay area, which is accepting and friendly. The city's LGBT population is not as high as in places like Manchester, Brighton, London, Blackpool; but it is a safe and comfortable feeling for gay visitors. The Plush Lounge, Frewin Court, is the most popular gay nightclub in the city, busy on Friday & Saturday nights, though visitors should be aware that it is largely the haunt of undergrads during the Autumn months.

Stay healthy[edit]
In a life-threatening medical emergency, dial 999 or 112. For urgent, but not life-threatening emergency issues it is recommended to call 111 and ask for assistance.

Hospitals and clinics[edit]
Although there are many hospitals in clinics in Oxford, the following are most likely to be of use to the sickly traveller.

51.764268-1.2194346 John Radcliffe Hospital (JR Hospital), Headley Way, Headington, Oxford, OX3 9DU, ☏ +44 300 3047777. The largest hospital in Oxford, used for most illnesses. Has an Accident & Emergency department for severe injuries. 
51.750135-1.2138617 Churchill Hospital, Old Road, Headington, Oxford, OX3 7LE, ☏ +44 300 3047777. 
Connect[edit]
