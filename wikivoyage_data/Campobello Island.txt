Campobello Island is an island in New Brunswick, Canada.
The island has no road connection to the rest of Canada except to deer island with a ferry; though there is a bridge connecting it to nearby Lubec, Maine in the United States.


Understand[edit]
East Quoddy Lighthouse
Measuring 14 km (8.7 mi) long and about 5 km (3.1 mi) wide, it has an area of 39.6 km² (15.3 sq mi). The island's permanent population in 2011 was 925.
The majority of residents are employed in the fishing/aquaculture or tourism industries.
A luxurious resort hotel was built in the late 19th century, and the island became a popular summer colony for wealthy Canadians and Americans, many of whom built grand estates there. Franklin D. Roosevelt spent his summers at a family estate on Campobello from the age of one until, as an adult, he acquired a larger property — a 34-room "cottage" — which he used as a summer retreat until 1939.

Stay safe[edit]
There have been problems with the US Government tampering with postal mail in-transit to Campobello from elsewhere in Canada, or even elsewhere in New Brunswick. These problems have only worsened since Canada made it lawful to purchase cannabis from licenced vendors, such as provincial liquor boards. Do not mail anything (from prescription drugs to privileged legal or medical information) that you do not wish to see opened, read or tampered with by a foreign power.
