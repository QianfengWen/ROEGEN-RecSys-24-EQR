Map of Hämeenlinna


By car[edit]
Exactly 100 km north from Helsinki along the road 3 (E12), which is a motorway on this leg (with the parallel older road designated 130). The nearest major city (and airport) is Tampere, about 75 km to the north by the same roads. Road number 10 between Turku and Lahti, adjacent to it the historical Hämeen Härkätie, also passes by the centre.

By train[edit]
As Hämeenlinna is on the most important railway line of Western Finland, the city is well connected with Helsinki and Tampere as well as cities further north, like Vaasa, Oulu and Rovaniemi.

61.00222224.4783331 Hämeenlinna railway station (Hämeenlinnan rautatieasema).   (updated Dec 2022)
By bus[edit]
Buses from Helsinki to Tampere and from Turku to Lahti stop in Hämeenlinna.
The local public transport system extends to Lahti (line 802).
Coming via Tallinn or Stockholm, there may be coach connections from the ports of Helsinki with arranged transfer, mostly via Kamppi. Coming via Turku harbour, there may be a direct service from the ferry terminal to Hämeenlinna.

By boat[edit]
Yes, there is a waterway between Tampere and Hämeenlinna. In summer it can be the most enjoyable way to travel, while the views on the lake Vanajavesi are at their best. The trip can be quite long though. Hopealinjat offers cruises, which take 8 hours one way (see Do below). Guest harbours: Vaakunanranta in the centre (+358 20-123-4636) and Virvelinranta a kilometre to the south (+358 400-484-172).

Get around[edit]
You can get around by car, by bus or by foot. For driving around, the city center is quite an irritating experience, with its tight intersections and numerous one-way streets. The services in the city centre are within a few minutes walk, so a car is hardly necessary there.

By bus[edit]
Hämeenlinna has a good system of public transport, information online in English. 
Tickets in 2020 for the city itself (zone A, including to Aulanko) €3.40/1.70, valid for 80 minutes, children 7–16. For a longer stay the smartphone app Waltti is useful, giving reduced adult fares. You can also use NFC payment with Visa, Mastercard or Eurocard (Diners Club and American Express do not work) or a mobile device with Apple Pay, Pivo or Google Pay: the payment card or mobile device is displayed to the reader device, which then says "Lähimaksu hyväksytty" ("Proximity payment accepted").
Many bus lines go in both directions from the centre. You can use an interactive route planner[dead link] to find bus routes. 
Matkahuolto Routes and Tickets app is able to first plan the route and after it sell the right ticket for it.
The bus station is the centre of Hämeenlinna's public transport system. Many bus lines go in both directions from bus station.

By scooter[edit]
