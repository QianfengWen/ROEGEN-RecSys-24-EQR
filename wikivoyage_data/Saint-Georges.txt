Saint-Georges is a town in Chaudière-Appalaches, Quebec. Saint-Georges is often considered the metropolis of Beauce Region because it's the largest city in the region.


Understand[edit]

Comprising around 31,000 people (2011), this is a pleasant town with a friendly population and fine services. Here, perhaps more than other places closer to Quebec city, you can witness the American influence on this area of southern Quebec; Walmart and McDonald's are commonplace, whether or not this is a good thing. 
Saint-Georges is an important manufacturing centre, including textiles, steel forgings, garage doors, bicycles and truck trailers. The town is home to the headquarters of the Canam Group, a construction solutions company, and Manac (trailers), the biggest semi-trailer manufacturer in Canada.

History[edit]
In the late 17th century, at which point the region was inhabited principally by Algonquin First Nations (aboriginal) people. The first European presence recorded is that of a Jesuit missionary, Father Gabriel Druillettes, who made three visits in 1646, 1650 and, finally, in 1651, but there was no colonial settlement established at this time. By the middle of the next century, however, two colonial "seigneuries" had been established on the present site of Saint-Georges: these were Aubin-de-l'Isle and Aubert-Gallion.
