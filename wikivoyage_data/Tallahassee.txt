Leon County Courthouse in Tallahasee
Tallahassee is the capital city of Florida, in the Florida Panhandle region of the state. In addition to housing the state government, it is a university town home to Florida State University, Florida A&M University, and Tallahassee Community College. Tallahassee has a good selection of restaurants for a city of its size. The universities' theater, art, and music programs, in addition to an active Council of Culture and Arts, also make for an unusually vibrant arts scene.
