By car[edit]
The main east-west route is the Bluegrass Parkway, bringing in traffic from Elizabethtown and I-65 South, 20 miles west. It also brings in Lexington traffic from the east. The two Bardstown exits are Exit 21 (US 31E) and Exit 25 (US 150). Nelson County also has exits off the parkway at Exit 10 (KY 52) to Boston and western Nelson County and Exit 34 (KY 55) to Bloomfield and eastern Nelson County.
Two roads arrive from Louisville. KY 245 (New Shepherdsville Road until it enters the city and becomes John Rowan Boulevard) funnels traffic from Exit 112 off of I-65 in Bullitt County. Although Route 245 goes through a fairly hilly area, the road is well-engineered with modest grades and no sharp curves. The other route is US 31E-150 which comes directly from Louisville. Before several miles were rerouted in the current century, the road was narrow and winding at spots. While it remains two lanes from Mount Washington until a couple of miles north of 245, it's now a noticeably less stressful drive that still offers nice views of the Nelson and Spencer County countryside.
