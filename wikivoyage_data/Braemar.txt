Lochnagar is usually climbed from Glen Muick above Ballater. There’s a longer route starting just south of Braemar. Park at Crathie church and follow the track up Glen Gelder. From there ascend to the corrie, then join the standard route at Meikle Pap to the summit at 1155 m. There’s an even longer trail further south following Feindallacher Burn and over Carn an t-Sagairt Mor (1047 m), Carn an t-Sagairt Beag (1044 m) and Carn A' Choire Bhaidheach (1110 m) and so to Lochnagar.
Lairig Ghru is a tough 20 mile hike through the mountain pass between Coylumbridge near Aviemore and the Linn of Dee above Braemar. It’s usually done in that direction, going east to have the wind and sun behind you, and you need to have transport set up at each end. The trail is obvious but it’s rugged terrain, the weather can be harsh any time of year, and it’s a bleak place with no shelter, amenities or bail-out options.
