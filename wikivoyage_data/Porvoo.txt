Porvoo (Swedish: Borgå) is a scenic small town 50 km east of Helsinki, Finland.  One of the most popular day trips from Helsinki, its picturesque city centre of wooden houses is a proposed UNESCO World Heritage Site.


Understand[edit]
Kayaking past Old Porvoo
Porvoo is one of the six medieval towns in Finland (with Naantali, Rauma, Turku, Ulvila and Vyborg). As Finland's second oldest city after Turku, Porvoo has been around since the 13th century, although most of the present buildings date to the 19th century. In 1809, the Finnish members of the Swedish parliament assembled at the Diet of Porvoo to affirm the country's conquest by Russia.
Today, tourists flock to pad about the cobbled narrow lanes of Old Porvoo (Vanha Porvoo), which has survived the sprawl of the modern city around it remarkably intact. The place is particularly popular in summer.

Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
There are buses from Helsinki's Central Bus Station to Porvoo every 15–30 minutes. Standard/express services between 55 and 70 minutes – the expresses just stop in Porvoo on their way to points further east. Tickets can be bought on Matkahuolto from €9, however the price for a ticket bought on the bus can go up to €18.
Services from Saint Petersburg are operated by Lux Express and Transgold.  Minibuses from Vyborg run by Skandynaviia TK will drop you at the 60.3900225.64561 McDonald's around 1 km west of the town centre.
60.3931925.664112 Porvoo bus station (Porvoon linja-autoasema). Ticket office has moved from the building in the middle of the square to across the road on Rauhankatu. An electronic board with upcoming departures is also located there. (updated Jan 2020)

By train[edit]
Porvoo Railway Station
There is no regular passenger train service to Porvoo, but the Porvoo Museum Railways run a vintage 1955 Lättähattu ("Flat Hat") Dm7 from Helsinki via Kerava to Porvoo and back occasionally. The trip takes 1½ hours and costs €40/80 one-way/return for adults, half price for children, no reservations, cash only. As of 2021, the train leaves Helsinki at 09:50 and sets off back from Porvoo at 14:10. 

By boat[edit]
M/S J.L. Runeberg cruises from Helsinki to Porvoo between May and September 3–5 times a week, departing at 10:00 and returning from Porvoo at 16:00. The trip takes 3½ hours one way and costs €25/36 one-way/return, half price for children. On Saturdays in the summer, you can also opt to take the boat one way and the train back (check hours). The boat leaves from Linnalaituri on Helsinki's Market Square, in front of the President's palace.

By car[edit]
Porvoo is easily accessed via the E18 motorway east from Helsinki towards Kotka and the Russian border. The other option is the old Porvoo road, Highway 170, but it's considerably slower and not particularly scenic.

By bicycle[edit]
Bike fans may want to consider pedalling the 78 km along the scenic King's Road from Helsinki to Porvoo, or 50 km along the more direct Highway 170 (part of EuroVelo route 10).

Get around[edit]
Buggy parking in front of the Cathedral
Porvoo is best explored on foot: the pedestrianized Old Town is compact and all main attractions can be easily reached from the bus, ferry or train stations. Parents will, however, probably want to leave the baby carriage at their lodging: the Old Town's streets are cobblestone and often hilly.

The former town hall, now museum
A pedestrian street with a focus on wooden houses and boutiques
The town is famed for its many wooden buildings, picturesquely perched by the Porvoo River (Finnish Porvoonjoki, Swedish Borgå å). These are concentrated in the old city (Finnish: Vanha Porvoo, Swedish Gamla Borgå), a few hundred metres north-west of the modern city centre, and on a fine summer day a stroll around them is very delightful indeed. For the best view of the iconic red warehouses, cross the river and walk along the park on the other side. Perhaps surprisingly (for buildings decorating almost all tourist brochures of a city), you can only view them from the riverside; they are private property, in use as homes or otherwise.
Overall, just walking the streets of the old city with its wooden houses and popping into the shops and cafés is really Porvoo's top attraction.

60.397225.6581 Porvoo Cathedral (Borgå domkyrka). A heavy, squat, white stone building, this church wins no awards for architectural innovation, but it's among the oldest and largest in Finland, with parts dating back to the 11th century. Predating the Reformation, it was built as a Catholic church, but was somewhat crudely converted into a Protestant one later on by removing icons and painting over murals. The building burned four times between 1300 and 1700, and took a direct hit from a bomb in 1914 – miraculously, the bomb fell through the roof, but did not explode. The roof was burned by an arsonist in 2006, but the damage was repaired and it's now open again, with some of the Catholic-era murals restored in the process. The diocese of Porvoo comprises the Swedish-speaking parishes of Finland.

The measure of Porvoo
According to legend, the bailiff of Porvoo used  a standard-sized measure to collect taxes of wheat or vodka from its citizens, but a specially altered box with a false bottom for passing them on to the Crown.
