Aylsham is a market town in the heart of Norfolk. The central layout of the town has changed little from medieval times and radiates out from the central market place.  From the market place there are some wonderful narrow streets and lanes to explore where may of the properties are older than they look, updated facades hide old timber framed construction and today's tiled roofs used to be thatch. It has gained Cittaslow status. 


Understand[edit]
Aylsham Town Sign
River Bure at Aylsham
With a population of around 5,000, the town is centred around the market place. The town sign shows John Gaunt, Lord of the manor from 1372 in the days when the town was known for its fine linen.  Manufacture of linen was the main industry until the 15th century after which it declined and wool became more important. After the Industrial Revolution, grain and timber became the main trade of the town. As a market town, the weekly markets (dating back to the 13th century) played an important part in maintaining the prosperity of the town. And today the market stall holders' rights date back to medieval times.
Lying on the River Bure, the town is too far upstream to get Broads boating traffic.
