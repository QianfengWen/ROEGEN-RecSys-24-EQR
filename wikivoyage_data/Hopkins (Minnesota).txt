Hopkins is a city in the Twin Cities.


Understand[edit]
Hopkins was founded in 1893, when residents of Hopkins sent the Hennepin County Board of Commissioners a petition signed by 41 residents, asking that a separate village be formed from unincorporated parts of Minnetonka and Richfield townships. Following an election, the community was then incorporated as the village of West Minneapolis. In 1928 the village name was changed to Hopkins, and in 1948 Hopkins officially became a city.
Hopkins is a dynamic community of over 17,000 residents located just 13 minutes west of Minneapolis. Founded rich in tradition and growth, Hopkins offers the advantages and conveniences of a large city but yet the security of a small town.
