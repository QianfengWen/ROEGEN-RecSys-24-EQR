 New Chums Beach. A beautiful and secluded beach with native forest down to the sand. Accessible only by boat or by foot. Cross the stream at the northern end of Whangapoua Beach (22 minute drive from Kuaotunu) and follow the rough track for 30 minutes. At high tide you might get a bit wet crossing the stream. (updated Dec 2016)
 Otama Beach, Black Jack Rd (3.5 km from Kuaotunu). A 2-km white-sand beach that has only a few houses at the eastern end, and at times you may be the only people on the beach, which is astonishing given how beautiful it is. The beach is very good and safe for swimming and the sand may squeak when you walk on it. Sections of the road to the beach are sealed. From Otama you can continue on the unsealed road to Opito Bay, the next beach. (updated Dec 2016)
