Salou is a municipality on the Costa Daurada of Tarragona in Catalonia. It is a popular beach and vacation spot with a string of beaches and the nearby PortAventura World theme park.


Understand[edit]
Used as a port by Greeks and Romans, Salou was the site of an important historic event in 1229 when the fleet of James I of Aragon departed from its port to conquer the Balearic islands, creating the Kingdom of Majorca. In 1286, Alfons III of Aragon also departed from this port to conquer Minorca, the last Muslim territory of the Balearic Islands.
Today, the city of 27,000 people (2018) is considered the capital and most popular destination of the Costa Daurada. Salou was famous for its permanent fairground at the end of the promenade and is used as the base for the Catalunyan round of the World Rally Championship.
