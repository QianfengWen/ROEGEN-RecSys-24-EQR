Port Hope Simpson, population 529, is a tiny, isolated hamlet in southeastern Labrador.


Understand[edit]
Port Hope Simpson
Port Hope Simpson was established in the 1930s as a company town, exporting timber to paper mills in Corner Brook until 1948. Exploitation of forestry and timber resumed briefly from 1962 to 1968, with seasonal cod and salmon fishing becoming an economic mainstay in 1970. The Newfoundland cod fishery was closed in 1992 but crab, shrimp and scallop fishing continue.
The Alexis River is popular for recreational salmon fishing.

Get in[edit]
Port Hope Simpson, a deep-water port, is accessible by Trans-Labrador Highway, by air and by sea.

By car[edit]
Access is taking Highway 510 (Trans-Labrador Highway).  The highway opened as gravel in 2009 and was paved by 2022.
From the north, take Route 510 from Cartwright (187 km). There are limited services in Cartwright village and nothing at all at Cartwright Junction. Between Goose Bay and Port Hope Simpson, a 410-km stretch of road through Cartwright Junction has no population centres, no fuel and no services.  Highway 510 ends 13 km west of Goose Bay, where it intersects with Highway 500.  Highway 500 travels between Goose Bay and the Quebec-Labrador border (also part of the Trans-Labrador Highway) near Labrador City
From the south (and the ferries at Blanc-Sablon) take Route 510 from Forteau through Red Bay and Lodge Bay. A few services (fuel, food, lodging, banking, souvenirs, airstrip) are available en route at Mary's Harbour. An additional 62 km of road (so 222 km in total) continues to Port Hope Simpson.

By plane[edit]
52.528056-56.2852781 Port Hope Simpson Airport (YHA  IATA) (about 2 km south of town). is an airstrip with a 106 metre runway.   
 Air Labrador, ☏ +1 709 931-2196. Regular, daily scheduled passenger and freight flights, Monday-Friday. 
 Provincial Airlines Ltd., toll-free: +1-877-576-3140. Charter service. 
By snowmobile[edit]
Extensive snowmobile trails connect Port Hope Simpson to Cartwright, Black Tickle, Charlottetown, Mary's Harbour, Battle Harbour, Lodge Bay and Red Bay.
By boat[edit]
As Port Hope Simpson is now accessible by road, its reliance on outport ferries has been greatly curtailed. Traffic arriving from beyond the end of the road network arrives by sea at Goose Bay, Cartwright or Blanc Sablon, then travels on Trans-Labrador Highway.

M/V Marine Eagle provides daily service northbound from Charlottetown and Port Hope Simpson to a few small in-region outports with no highway access.
M/V Northern Ranger, based in Lewisporte, no longer calls at Port Hope Simpson; service south of Cartwright/Black Tickle has been curtailed and the traffic carried by road. It continues to carry traffic from Goose Bay/Cartwright to points further north, where there is no road.
At Blanc-Sablon, there is a ferry to Newfoundland's Great Northern Peninsula and a coastal ferry which stops at multiple inaccessible outports going westward toward Sept-Îles.

Nearby[edit]
Charlottetown[edit]
Tiny outport 50 km (30 miles) north of Port Hope Simpson, small airstrip, few or no services. Ferry connections to otherwise-isolated communities Snug Harbour and Fishing Ships Harbour.

Mary's Harbour[edit]
Small crab-fishing village on Trans-Labrador 510, 50 km (30 miles) southeast of Port Hope Simpson, population 475. Mary's Harbour has a small airstrip with Air Labrador service and a ferry crossing to Cape Charles.

Battle Harbour National Historic District, a restored fisheries ghost town (established 1750s, abandoned 1960s) is on an island reachable by a one-hour sea crossing from Mary's Harbour. The boat to Battle Harbour makes one run daily, leaving Battle Harbour at 9AM and Mary's Harbour at 11AM, which is awkward as accommodation in the historic buildings on the island is expensive ($225/person for admission, return ferry trip and one bunk overnight in a shared-accommodation bunkhouse is the least expensive, short of paying $2/foot for dockage to bring your own boat plus the $15/person admission. Most of the other overnight options are $500 and up, and the Battle Harbour boat is scheduled to preclude a same-day trip).
 Riverlodge Hotel, 6163 Main St, Mary's Harbour, ☏ +1 709 921-6948, fax: +1 709 921-6409. Wi-fi, 15 rooms (smoking/non-smoking), dining room with local cuisine and fresh sea food in season. 
Go next[edit]
If continuing north, set your watch back a half-hour between Port Hope Simpson and Cartwright as most of Labrador (north of the tiny, dying fishing outport "Black Tickle") uses Atlantic time (AST/ADT). All points between Port Hope Simpson and Forteau (inclusive) use Newfoundland time.

Cartwright (Labrador) is 90 km off what passes as the "beaten path" on the Trans-Labrador Highway. There are no services or fuel at Cartwright Junction; Cartwright itself has food and fuel but no hotel, bank or repair garage.
The Trans-Labrador Highway onward to Happy Valley-Goose Bay is 410 km of wilderness with no fuel or services. Don't attempt this without a full tank of fuel.
