Do[edit]
Trek[edit]
 Laguna de Cocon. Heading east from Palcamayo there is a trail leading past the ruins of Llaumanpata and onto Laguna de Cocon, about 10 km each way. 
Go for a walk on the Camino del Inca. You can reach it directly from Tarma or Huasqui, until Tarmatambo. From there, cross the valley and go up to the crest to come back to Tarma, passing the cemetery. If you don't have time, reach the road and come back by collectivo.
Go to Palcamayo (S/3.5, 45 min). Then to Gruta de Huagapo (cave, S/1 until the entrance and more to enter) by foot (45 min) or by car. 500m after the cave, a path on the right canon de Ushpo or valley of mystery and esoterism... A very nice walk through the rocks (30 min). You can come back the same way (easier), or turn right at the end, on a little path going up. You'll go very high and have nice views. It's not easy to find a path, try to stay high and you'll see it leading to the village (2-3 hr). Be careful, the last cars leave at 18:00 or 18:30.
