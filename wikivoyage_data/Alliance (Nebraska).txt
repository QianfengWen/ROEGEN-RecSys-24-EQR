Alliance is a city in the Nebraska Panhandle with a population of 8,100 in 2019. 


Understand[edit]
In 1888, the settlement that would become Alliance was established. Settlers from further east took advantage of the Homestead Act of 1862 to acquire large amounts of land for use. Originally called Grand Lake, the settlement quickly grew as land lots around the railroad were sold off to locals. By 1891, the town was renamed Alliance and had a population of 840, which would double by 1895. 
The town is located in the high plains region of Nebraska. Vast, treeless prairie results in the area being windswept and experiencing severe weather frequently. Alliance is also within the Mountain Time Zone (UTC-7), so if arriving from the east, be sure to set your clock accordingly.
