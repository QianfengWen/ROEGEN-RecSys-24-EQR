Holyhead (Welsh: Caergybi) is a small port town on Holy Island, which is narrowly separated from the larger island of Anglesey, in north-west Wales. The town includes a small medieval church on the site of a Roman fortress, and there is some seaside scenery nearby, but otherwise it has few sites of interest; it's mainly a transfer point for high-speed ferries that cross the Irish Sea to the Dublin area.
