Stuttgart is the capital of the Bundesland of Baden-Württemberg in Germany. With a population of approximately 632,000 in the immediate city (2017) and more than 5.2 million people in the metropolitan area (2013), Stuttgart is the 6th largest city in Germany.
Stuttgart is known as a centre of mechanical and automobile engineering with the headquarters of the world-famous Bosch, Mercedes and Porsche within its metropolitan area. It does not, however, resemble most other industry hubs, as it is a rather sparse city spread over many hills and valleys, with forests, parks, mineral springs and even vineyards within the city. Stuttgart forms the centre of Region Stuttgart, a densely populated and idustrialised area that is closely interwoven and shares the same public transport system consisting of 179 cities and municipalities with a rich history to discover.


Understand[edit]
The subdivisions of Stuttgart
Stuttgart consists of 23 districts (Stadtbezirke), which are further divided into 152 localities (Stadtteile). The five inner districts are named Mitte, Nord, Ost, Süd and West ("centre", "North", "East", "South" and "West", respectively). The outer districts are mostly former towns with their own names - of note are Zuffenhausen (Porsche headquarters and museum), Untertürkheim (headquarters of Daimler-Benz and Mercedes-Welt, as well as sports arenas sponsored by Porsche and Mercedes), and Bad Cannstatt (nice old centre, mineral water and lots of vineyards).
Despite being smaller and most densely populated among major German cities (when looking at the statistics), Stuttgart appears anything but that. This is because the population is not concentrated in the relatively small and hardly "metropolitan" centre, but is evenly spread over the hills contained within the city area, with multiple population centres stemming from the small towns that were incorporated into the present-day Stuttgart. Therefore, you will find many points of interest quite far away from each other, and the use of Stuttgart's very convenient public transport system quite necessary. Stuttgart is a big city with a small-town atmosphere.

Talk[edit]
If you do speak German well: beware that some people still speak the local Schwäbisch dialect natively, which may somewhat affect their standard German. They love to practise other languages (especially English) and will try to help you.

By plane[edit]
Plan of Stuttgart Airport and adjacent fairgrounds (Messe Stuttgart)
48.69059.19261 Stuttgart Airport (STR  IATA), ☏ +49 711 948-0. The 6th busiest airport in Germany, reflecting the city's size and importance. It is on the southern outskirts of the city and connected via local rail (S-Bahn) and will eventually be connected to mainline high-speed railway.   

Airlines and destinations[edit]
The airport is a base for Lufthansa's low-fare subsidiary Eurowings. Moreover, most major European carriers have connections to Stuttgart from their main hubs, so there is a wide choice of direct flights to other German and European cities, and even if there is no direct flight from your origin, you will easily find a connection through any of the hubs. Stuttgart has a direct connection to Atlanta.
Moreover, Stuttgart's main railway station (Hauptbahnhof) is just an hour away by high-speed train (ICE) from Frankfurt Airport, which is one of Europe's major aviation hubs. Many airlines offer flights to Frankfurt with a connecting train to Stuttgart instead of direct flights to Stuttgart, and as this is very quick and convenient (landing you in the very city centre), you should consider this option as well.
There is a significant charter/holiday traffic between Stuttgart and the popular holiday destinations in southern Europe and North Africa, mostly served by dedicated carriers such as TUIfly. There is growing low-fare traffic to Stuttgart as well, with easyJet and Vueling all serving the airport from their bases across Europe.

Ground transportation[edit]
The best way to get from Stuttgart airport to the city centre is by using public transport which is clean, cheap and safe.

The S-Bahn line S2 or S3 will bring you in its red or gray vehicles to Stuttgart's centre (€3.70) within 27 minutes (see Timetable[dead link] from station 'Flughafen' to station 'Hauptbahnhof'). Tickets can be purchased at vending machines at the level below the airport and above the platform (follow the symbol with a white S on a green background). Tickets should be validated at orange boxes on the platform before boarding the train. Alternatively, the VVS app can be used. The airport is not in Stuttgart, but in zone 2. You can use all public transport within the zones with this ticket.
The Stadtbahn line U6 will bring you to the airport from Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof in 32 min. Its yellow and black vehicles are especially designed to climb up and down the steep hills of Stuttgart. All axles of the vehicles are driven. It manages a steep slope of up to 8.5% which is the steepest regular-lane friction track in Europe that is used in local public transport. The airport U-Bahn stop is located outside of the airport building right next to the Mövenpick hotel (follow the symbol with a white U on a blue background).
Several bus lines head for other destinations (e.g. Tübingen (828) and Reutlingen (X3)). For early flights during the week, the night bus N8 will bring you from Schlossplatz to the airport. The scheduled arrival at the airport is at 04:24. All buses will stop at the Stuttgart bus terminal (SAB) outside of the airport building just across the street.
Taxis will be waiting at the airport. The airport's taxi service number is 0711/948 4409; Stuttgart's Taxi-Auto-Zentrale is 0711/55 10 000. Expect to pay around €30 to get to the city centre.
In the basement there are several car rental companies and outside at car park P4 there are parking lots reserved and used by ShareNow (Car2Go). If you only want to visit the city centre it is probably not the best option to rent a car.
The concourse of Terminal 1
Terminals and orientation[edit]
Stuttgart Airport has four terminals (numbered 1 to 4), but Terminals 1 to 3 share a common airside — the number of the terminal indicates in which concourse the check-in and luggage drop-off is in the main hall (1 is the westernmost concourse area, the 3 is the eastern one and the 2 is between the main concourse). Terminal 4 is separate, although connected by a walkway on the landside (not on the airside, so you have to make sure you go through security there if you are flying from Terminal 4).

Terminal 1 serves mainly Lufthansa and most other Star Alliance carriers (Austrian, SAS, Swiss, Turkish)
Terminal 2 serves Eurowings
Terminal 3 serves intercontinental flights (Delta, United), Aegean Airlines and other non Star-Alliance airlines, including Condor and Tuifly
Terminal 4 is used mainly for charter and holiday flights
Departures are one level above arrivals and two levels above the S-Bahn station. See the airport's terminal guide[dead link] for detailed floor plans.

Hotels[edit]
There is a Moevenpick and a Wyndham Hotel at the airport. For nearby hotels, some with shuttle service (for a fee) see Leinfelden-Echterdingen and Filderstadt, Böblingen and Sindelfingen.

Stuttgart 21
In the late 20th century, transportation experts at (then) Deutsche Bundesbahn had an idea: the historic terminus stations, that is, stations which can only be entered from one side, were to be replaced with through stations, stations which a train can pass through en route from one stop to another. Besides the immediately obvious benefits of through running and getting rid of sometimes lengthy detours into and out of cities, it was hoped that extensive inner city real estate could be converted from tracks into housing or retail. The heads of DB shopped this idea, named (city)21 due to the 21st century for which it was deemed the transportation solution, to various cities, including Frankfurt, Munich and Stuttgart. However, various reasons made the project fall through in most places (Neu Ulm 21 has been built already and Lindau 21 has been finished in modified form) except Stuttgart. The original plan called for a total redesign of rail infrastructure in and around Stuttgart, a new high speed link to Ulm (for faster connections to Munich) and new tunnels for access to the airport and trade fair area. It was hoped that the project would "pay for itself" through extensive redevelopment of former railway real estate and the city of Stuttgart was promised a new station, a new neighbourhood and huge federal investment all on the federal and state dime. However initial cost estimates proved to be - as they often are - far too low, there were doubts that the new station could achieve the capacity of the old station and locals felt ignored and badly informed by politicians and Deutsche Bahn. The protests against Stuttgart 21 grew and the erstwhile local issue began making national headlines. One particularly memorable moment was when heavy handed policing during a demonstration resulted in the blinding of an elderly protester who was hit by a water cannon. The 2011 state elections had been declared a "referendum" on Stuttgart 21 and the "natural governing" Christian Democratic Union was defeated in part due to the controversy. The Greens, second biggest party ahead of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) formed a coalition with the SPD and passed a law to hold a referendum on Stuttgart 21. The referendum however resulted in a 58.9% majority against canceling the project so construction continued. Since then there have been many cost overruns and calls to end the project but construction is ongoing. It will be finished not earlier than 2025.


48.7838899.1816672 Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof (city centre). Timetables for trains and booking are available on the webpages of Deutsche Bahn AG. Stuttgart main station is being redesigned (while still running) for the somewhat controversial "Stuttgart 21" project (see infobox). Once the project is completed Stuttgart main station will have transformed from a terminus to a through station with faster connections in most directions. Meanwhile, plan more time to reach the platform. For getting on from Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof and around in the city of Stuttgart, see Public Transportation below. Stuttgart is also served by  Flixtrain. They run one train each way daily on their Stuttgart-Berlin route. Trains have a lower top speed than the ICE and are thus a bit slower, but tickets are significantly cheaper. When booking via Flixbus, make sure to book a departure labeled "train" as you'll otherwise be sitting on a bus.   (updated Apr 2023)

By bus[edit]
The long-distance bus market has been exploding in Germany since 2013. There are dozens of daily services from most major cities, which are often significantly cheaper than trains. Most buses offer amenities like Wi-Fi and power outlets and some can even transport bicycles. The best resource for checking connections is this German website. As of 2018 there is no public central bus station and all of those listed below are well outside the city centre. While they are all connected to public transit, plan some extra time getting to/from your station and remember to figure in the price of the S-Bahn when comparing bus and train tickets. For intercity bus stops in Germany, the Stuttgart area is actually better than the often quite disappointing average in terms of facilities and modernity.

By car[edit]
Stuttgart is among Germany's cities with most traffic jams, so try to avoid the rush-hour as car traffic can easily break down. Also parking is definitely a problem in most inner city areas. Expect a lack of parking facilities and high parking fees. Stuttgart is connected by the two major autobahns, the west/east-highway A8 to the south and the north/south-highway A81 to the west as well as smaller autobahn-like highways B10, B14, B27. However, Stuttgart has no motorway connection in the north east forcing commuters in this area to pass the city centre. Generally, follow the sign "Stuttgart Zentrum" to get to the centre of Stuttgart. Use park and ride facilities if possible. The most accessible are the park and ride facilities in Degerloch Albstraße and Österfeld. Stuttgart is low emission zone. Be sure that your car has the green sticker, but you are allowed to access those park and ride facilities with cars that do not meet the standards.

Get around[edit]
48°46′33″N 9°10′37″EMap of Stuttgart



Stuttgart has a very compact city centre with most destinations within walking distance. Nearly all visitors arrive at the main train station (Hauptbahnhof). From there the remarkable 1.2-km-long pedestrian shopping street called “Königstraße” leads through the heart of the city, passing the Schlossplatz with the amazing New Palace, to the Rotebühlplatz (Stadtmitte). Other main sights (e.g. museums, opera) are just around the corner.

A map of the S-Bahn and U-Bahn networks in Stuttgart
By public transport[edit]
Stuttgart's public transportation system comprises two light rail system - the Stadtbahn (or U-Bahn) and Schnellbahn (S-Bahn), as well as a city bus system. It is managed by VVS and is fully integrated in that there is one fare and ticketing system for all forms of transit, so that a single ticket can be used on any mixture of buses and trains that may be required to complete the journey. The VVS's network called is divided in zones. The city of Stuttgart is only Zone 1. Most lines will lead via Hauptbahnhof, ending in a layout that is pretty centralised: If you want to go somewhere, chances are, you have to ride via Hauptbahnhof. The following Stadtbahn or S-Bahn stations are in the heart of the city: Hauptbahnhof, Schlossplatz, Charlottenplatz, Stadtmitte (Rotebühlplatz), Feuersee, Rathaus, Staatsgalerie and Berliner Platz (Liederhalle). For a complete description see the official map of VVS-network.
From Sunday to Wednesday public transportation stops around 01:00. On the weekend the S-Bahn is running hourly the whole night on all lines. So the inner city route from Hauptbahnhof to Schwabstraße is connected frequently. Additionally there are several night buses running, all starting from the Schlossplatz. On Thursdays there are night buses at 01:20, 02:30, 03:40. Be careful if you have a very early airplane since there are no S-Bahn connections weekdays to the airport in the early morning between 01:00 and 05:00. The only option is a night bus from Schlossplatz. 

A Stadtbahn train on a tram-like section of line U4
U-Bahn (Stadtbahn)[edit]
Stuttgart's Stadtbahn is a combination of suburban light rail, tramway/streetcar system and underground metro (subway). In the very centre of the city, the tracks run underground, and the overground sections run along city streets, partially grade-separated and partially integrated into city streets like tramways. That way, the yellow carriages of the Stadtbahn can travel all the way from the suburban hillsides to the central hub by the Hauptbahnhof, allowing convenient commuting with minimal changeovers.
To distinguish the Stadtbahn from the suburban trains of the Schnellbahn, it is referred to as  U-Bahn, and its lines numbered from U1 to U16. U-Bahn stands for underground/metro/subway in most other cities in German-speaking countries, even though in Stuttgart it runs underground over only a small portion of the network.
Most of the U-Bahn lines go through the underground section in the city centre, stopping at either the Hauptbahnhof, Charlottenplatz or both - with the exception of line U3, U 8 and U13 which go to their destinations without crossing the city centre. See map for details. The numbers U11 and U19 are reserved for special lines only operating during major events in the Neckarpark. The U10 moniker is reserved for the Zahnradbahn (see below)., Since rebuilding the station Staatsgallerie is under way there are some temporary lines in effect. Check the map at your station for information about these temporary lines.

The red S-Bahn train in Plochingen
S-Bahn (Schnellbahn)[edit]
The Schnellbahn (or  S-Bahn), literally meaning "fast railway", is a system of regional trains operated by the Deutsche Bahn for VVS. They run over mainline and railway track sections separate from the Stadtbahn, with fewer stops/stations and reaching farther beyond the city that the Stadtbahn. As the S-Bahn is separate from the U-Bahn, not all stations are integrated - there are S-Bahn stations with no connections to the U-Bahn system. That said, they are covered by the same ticket/fare system and compliment itself well.
You will most probably find the S-Bahn most convenient to use when covering larger distances or getting to locations not served by the U-Bahn, like the airport or Porsche Museum in Zuffenhausen. The S-Bahn lines are numbered from S1 to S6, plus the extra line S60.
All of the lines travel through the so-called Stammstrecke (common track) in the city centre, between the Schwabstraße station and the Hauptbahnhof. From there, the lines extend in all directions towards the extremities of Stuttgart. Of particular interest are the S2 and S3, which extend to the Airport. Both go through the city centre to Bad Cannstatt and split in Waiblingen towards their separate termini. While the airport station (Flughafen) is the terminus for S3, the S2 continues to Filderstadt beyond the airport.

Zahnradbahn and Seilbahn[edit]
The Zahnradbahn arriving at its terminus in Marienplatz
There are two fascinating transportations in Stuttgart, which are worth riding just because of the vehicle. The rack-railway (Zahnradbahn, commonly called Die Zacke) is the only urban rack-railway in Germany and comes with an amazing view over Stuttgart. It has 8 stations and runs between its termini:

48.764429.16851 Stuttgart-Marienplatz. There is an underground stop of U1 and U9 at the Marienplatz next to the Zahnradbahn's overground terminus. 
48.748939.169082 Stuttgart-Degerloch. An U-Bahn stop is parallel to the Degerloch Zahnradbahn terminus, served by U5, U6, U8 and U12 
The historic cable-car (Standseilbahn) line connects Stuttgart-Heslach with the Waldfriedhof cemetery on the hill. It only has two stations - one downhill and one uphill:

48.755969.142153 Standseilbahn Talstation (Lower station) (Heslach). (updated Aug 2021)
48.751659.145474 Standseilbahn Bergstation (Upper station). 
Both rack-railway and cable-car do not require a special ticket, instead all normal tickets valid in Zone 10 (including day tickets) are valid.

Tickets and fares[edit]
Several ticket option are available (as of Dec 2018):

3-Day-Ticket - if you are staying for more than a day, for added mobility buy a special "3-Tage-Ticket" for unlimited rides throughout Stuttgart. These are available in hotels, at the airport and the tourist information at the end of Königstraße near Hauptbahnhof - but make sure you take proof that you're a tourist (e.g. hotel booking confirmation). There are two types of 3-day tickets available. One covers the main Stuttgart city including Fellbach and Korntal (tarif zones 1 and 2, €14), and the other is valid for the entire VVS network, including Ludwigsburg (€19.50).
Single Day Ticket - called EinzelTagesTicket, are also good value for visitors (1–2 zones: €5.20, 3–4 zones: €8.60, entire network: €13.20) They allow as many journeys until the end of day.
Group Day Tickets - GruppenTagesTickets for up to 5 persons (1–2 zones: €12.30, 3–4 zones: €17.10. entire network: €19.90).
Single Ticket - A Single Ride Ticket entitles the rider to one ride in the same direction, but changing lines as well as ride interruptions are permitted. The tickets remain in effect for two hours from purchase (1 zone: €2.50, 2 zones: €2.90, 3 zones: 4.20....)
StuttCard - provides free access to museums and a number discounts on purchase, can be combined with a 1-, 2- or 3-day travel pass.
In the Stadtbahn and the buses stamping machines are available inside the cars, while on the S-Bahn they are at the entrances of the stations and there is no possibility to stamp once you are in the train. (If you do forget to stamp your ticket in the S-Bahn, either get out at the next station, stamp and wait for the following train, or write the current time and location on the stamping field with a non-erasable pencil – this will also be accepted by the inspectors most of the time.)
Fare-dodging is severely frowned upon and plain-clothes inspectors are on constant patrol. Fines are steep, starting at €60 per person for the first offense.

By car[edit]
Pedestrian zone in Stuttgart
If you intend to drive by car inside Stuttgart, the only possibility to park are parking blocks at about €1.50 per hour. Some parking blocks are closed during late night, providing no way of getting your car out. The street layout and numerous tunnels in Stuttgart can be confusing for tourists. Driving by car is not recommended.

By e-hailing[edit]
Uber and Free Now cover the city.

By taxi[edit]
Taxis are expensive. For €10 you will get about 4 minutes of a taxi drive. With two or more people, getting a taxi together at night (when public transportation has stopped) can make sense. Call a taxi in Stuttgart: Phone Nr. 0711/55 10 000 - Taxi-Auto-Zentrale Stuttgart. There is a special offer for women travelling at night for more safety. If you are a woman or a group of only women travelling after 20:00, you can request a Frauen-Nacht-Taxi, which will have a female driver and the costs are reduced by €5. The Uber app can also be used in Stuttgart.

See[edit]
Stuttgart, which once had a reputation as the conservative capital of the south-west, has turned into a bustling metropolis with world-class culture, great shopping and night-life. The capital’s architecture is an appealing mixture of historical and modern buildings with green parks and even vineyards throughout the city. The unique cauldron-shaped landscape offers plenty of scenic lookouts and formed a dense city centre where nowadays fortunately most of Stuttgart's main attractions are. In the heart of the city centre the Palace Square is a must for visitors and an ideal starting point for a tour.

City Centre[edit]
Neues Schloss seen from across the Schlossplatz
48.77859.179911 Schlossplatz (Palace Square). The Schlossplatz is the largest square in Stuttgart, right in the middle of the Mitte in front of the Neues Schloss. It was created as parade grounds for the palace, and is now a public green area with lawns, flowerbeds, twin fountains and a decorative bandstand. It immediately adjoins the Koenigstraße, and a number of key buildings can be accessed immediately from it. In warmer months, the Schlossplatz is always full of locals, students and tourists enjoying its relaxing atmosphere. It is also an event location.   (updated Aug 2021)
48.77819.181942 Neues Schloss (New Palace). The arguably most recognizable symbol of Stuttgart was constructed between 1746 and 1807 when the Duke of Württemberg, Carl Eugen, found the Altes Schloss and the erstwhile ducal residence in Ludwigsburg to be insufficiently stately. The new palace was a grandiose undertaking that took many decades, architects and four successive Dukes of Württemberg to complete, given the ever-changing tastes and plans, as well as constant scandalization within the Duchy regarding the costs of the lavish residence.The result is a palace inspired partially by Versailles and other grand royal residences, which gave the centre of Stuttgart an airy, garden park feel. The palace became a state museum in 1918 when the last King of Württemberg abdicated, and was almost completely destroyed in World War II. It was rebuilt in 1958-1964 to serve as a seat for the local government of Baden-Württemberg. It now houses the Ministry of Finance and Economy for the Land, and can be visited during guided tours. Tour dates are announced in advance on the palace's website, and visitors are invited to sign up. Several rooms and halls in the palace can also be rented for special events. Tours cost €8 per adult.   
Panorama of the courtyard of Altes Schloss
48.77729.179173 Altes Schloss (Old Castle). Built as a fully-functional fortified castle at the turn of the 10th century, it grew together with Stuttgart as it rose from a small settlement to the capital of County, and later Duchy of Württemberg. It was in the 16th century that the castle got its current form of a renaissance palace with a cloistered courtyard. The moat around the Altes Schloss was filled in in the 18th century, and became today's Schillerplatz. Today the Altes Schloss houses the Landemuseum Württemberg.   
48.777479.178634 Alte Kanzlei (Old Chancellery). The construction of the mighty monument on the northeast side of the Schiller Square lasted three years from 1542 to 1544. Only 22 years later, in 1566, the construction of the building has been extended. Nowadays the Old Chancellery would be comparable to the function of a town hall. Today the building is used as a restaurant and a bar.   
48.779099.178415 Königsbau. The Königsbau was erected 1856-1860 directly in front of the Neues Schloss as a multi-functional building to host commerce and special events, at the order of King Wilhem I (hence the name, which means "king's building"). Its Schlossplatz facade, with 34 columns over 135 metres, serves as a balance to the equally imposing palace opposite. In the latter half of the 20th century, the rebuilt Königsbau became shortly the seat of Stuttgart's stock exchange, and a part of a large shopping centre called Königsbau Passagen, which extends behind the main building.   
Panorama of the Schillerplatz
48.77729.178476 Schillerplatz (Schiller square). Named after the great poet Friedrich Schiller, whose statue stands in the middle of the square.   
48.77679.178067 Stiftskirche (Collegiate Church). Built in 1175.   
48.7773759.1780458 Prinzenbau. Built 1750.   
48.78039.1859 Opernhaus (Opera House). Pass the New Palace to the left and you find yourself in the beautiful Schlossgarten with the Opernhaus in front of an artificial lake, as part of the Staatstheater Stuttgart. Also the parliament of the state of Baden-Würrtemberg is there.   
48.7838899.18166710 Hauptbahnhof (Main Railway Station). The Railway Station was built in 1920 as a terminus station. The 56-meter-high tower with its rotating and illuminated Mercedes-Benz is one of the most famous city landmarks. On top of the tower there is an exhibition of the most controversial infrastructure project in Germany called S21. The plan is to convert the main line terminus station into an underground through station by turning the tracks with a 90-degree angle to the present station. It's free to climb up and grants awesome views of Königstraße and the city.   
48.776019.1789911 Markthalle (Market Hall). A beautiful Jugendstil market hall built in 1910.   
48.77619.1841712 Wilhelmspalais (King William's Palace). (1834-1840)   
48.7752499.17261813 Calwer passage (S-Bahn to Stadtmitte). Small gallery with little stores (somewhat similar to Milan's famous gallery but a lot smaller). Right next to it is a building whose exterior is covered with plants. (updated Sep 2021)
Close to centre[edit]
Johanneskirche at Feuersee
48.77929.1694914 Liederhalle (Culture and Congress Centre). (1956)   
48.773299.1645915 Johanneskirche (St. John's Church). Although there is no Cologne Cathedral in Stuttgart, there are a few churches worth visiting. Most beautiful is the Johanneskirche, which is surrounded by the lake Feuersee and lighted at night. Other interesting churches are: Mätthauskirche (St. Matthew's Church), Domkirche St. Eberhard (St. Eberhard's Cathedral Church), Hospitalkirche (Hospital Church), Leonhardskirche (St. Leonard's Church), Veitskapelle (St. Vitus Chapel), St. Catherine's Church (English-speaking Anglican Church), St. Maria Kirche (St. Mary's Church).  
48.774739.1839916 Bohnenviertel. The Bohnenviertel is the only preserved part of Stuttgart's old town, having miraculously survived to the present day largely intact. Built mainly in the 14th century, it used to house the poorer part of the population, who fed mainly on beans which were grown all around the quarter in gardens and even hanging from the houses' walls, hence the name meaning "bean quarter". Today, the Bohnenviertel is thriving on artisanry and small, old-style retail, as well as gastronomy and red light district. (updated Aug 2021)
Neue Bibliothek at night
48.790219.1828117 Stadtbibliothek am Mailänder Platz (Neue Bibliothek, Bibliothek 21). M-Sa 09:00-21:00. Stuttgart's city library moved into this spectacular new building in 2011. It took 13 years of planning, an international architectural competition (which was won by Eun Young Yi from South Korea) and €80 million to complete it. On the outside, it is a sombre, nine-storey cube with a glass-brick facade. Inside, the whitewashed surfaces and bright lighting provide an almost unreal ambiance. There is quite a lot of innovative features and facilities inside, not only related to the rather simple layout and fit-outs, but rather to the way the library itself works - for example, you can borrow not only books, but also works of art, or work with music and sound clips in the sound lab. There is also a cafe on the top floor (open 10:00-18:00), and you can get a free map and audioguide from the reception on the ground floor. Most facilities are free of charge, but to borrow books or media you will need to purchase at least a monthly pass for €4.   
48.787119.1759318 Qingyin garden (Garten der schönen Melodie) (Bus 44 - stop Im Kaisemer). 09:00 till dusk or 20:00, whichever comes sooner. A small Chinese garden, with a pond, ornamental walls and a mini-pagoda included, hidden on one of the hills close to the Hauptbahnhof.   
48.7963429.18668619 Pragfriedhof-Krematorium (U-Bahn to Pragfriedhof). A beautiful Jugendstil crematorium with occasional exhibitions about transience. (updated Sep 2021)
Farther out[edit]
One of Le Corbusier's buildings at Weissenhof
Schloss Solitude
48.80069.177520 Weissenhof Estate (Weißenhofsiedlung), Rathenaustraße 1- 3. Tu-F 11:00-18:00; Sa Su 10:00-18:00. A world heritage listed housing estate built for exhibition in 1927, features residential buildings by such famous architects like Le Corbusier, Peter Behrens, Walter Gropius and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. In two semi-detached houses designed by Le Corbusier, there is a museum dedicated to the area. The historical building is not suitable for people using wheelchairs. normal ticket €5, reduced €2.   
48.7869449.08416721 Schloss Solitude (Solitude Palace). The Solitude palace was built as a hunting lodge and summer residence in in 1769 and looks from the outside like a classical rococo palace.

48.804899.2146922 Old Town and Market in Bad Cannstatt (U1/U2/U13/U16 to Bad Cannstatt-Wilhelmsplatz or S1/S2/S3 to Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt, then walk to the northwest). Bad Cannstatt is older than Stuttgart, and has been a thriving town when today's centre of Stuttgart was still a horse pasture. Moreover, unlike the centre of Stuttgart, the old town of Bad Cannstatt survived the Second World War relatively unscathed. Therefore, you can still get an authenthic, medieval feel wandering around its winding narrow streets, which all lead to a peculiarly-shaped market square.On the market square, you will find the town church of Cannstatt (Stadtskirche) and the old town hall, still in use as the district's government seat (Bezirksrathaus), both from the late 15th century. It also owns the oldest dwelling in Stuttgart ("Klösterle" / 15th century) that is now used as a wine tavern. 
The Kursaal in Bad Canstatt's Kurpark
48.808659.223523 Kurpark in Bad Cannstatt (U2 station Kursaal or alt. U1/U13 and U16 to Uff-Kirchhoff). Cannstatt owes the Bad (German for bath) in its name to numerous mineral water springs. To enable locals and visitors to enjoy them, a small but very peaceful Kurpark was arranged for in the 19th century, along with a large Kursaal (spa hall) building, which today is a restaurant and special event venue. Right next to it is the MineralBad-Cannstatt (Solebad Bad Cannstatt) spa-wellness-fitness complex with a large pool covered by an impressive glass dome. The Kurpark is divided into two parts Unterer (lower) Kurpark and Oberer (upper) Kurpark separated by Kursaal. The upper Kurpark provides a nice view of Bad Cannstatt.Close to Kurpark, around Uff-Kirchhoff, is the home of around 50 parrots (yellow headed amazons) that can be spotted throughout the year. They barely leave their trees (mainly platanus trees) but their distinctive cry can be heard from distance. It is the only population outside the Americas. (updated Sep 2021)

Stuttgart in general claims to be the birthplace of the automobile, but if you want to see the actual place where it was born, head to the Kurpark in Bad Cannstatt, where the garden house that Gottlieb Daimler converted into his workshop still stands. There he and Wilhelm Maybach worked in the latter half of the 19th century on combustion engines and motorised vehicles they have eventually so successfully developed. Today, it houses an exhibition maintained by Mercedes-Benz Classic that tells the story of the early days of the Daimler motor car company. Admission free.

Towers and scenic outlooks[edit]
The Fernsehturm in full moon
Stuttgart is inside a valley picturesquely surrounded by green hills, which the locals call Kessel, or a cauldron. Therefore, one of the main attractions are the views from the hillsides and hilltops around the city. There are several options to enjoy an extraordinary view over the Swabian capital:

48.755769.1901741 Fernsehturm Stuttgart. The world's first TV tower constructed from reinforced concrete was built from 1954-1956. It is the prototype for all modern TV towers, and affords visitors a beautiful view over Stuttgart. The Stadtbahn U15 to Ruhbank (Fernsehturm) gives you a wonderful view of the city. Entrance is €7 per person and is worth it for the near-fairground quality of the ride in the lift to the top. There's a nice cafe at the top which serves fresh food and drinks.

"Das Grüne U": Most of Stuttgart's many parks and gardens are usually referred to by locals as "das Grüne U" (the green "U") because of the U-shaped form in which they are located around the city centre. They form a long and beautiful path around the city, starting at the Schlossgarten at the northern façade of the new palace (Neues Schloss), continuing through 48.8035759.19660658 Rosensteinpark.

Stuttgart publishes a book annually entitled Stuttgart geht aus (Stuttgart goes out). This is available at most book stores on Königstraße (e.g. Wittwer). This book, published in German, is a great guide to restaurants in the city.

Breakfast[edit]
In the morning, locals definitely want to get some fresh bread (and brezels and broetchen [bread rolls/buns]) from the baker's shop and serve them with butter, cheese, ham, honey, jam and eggs from the fridge. Many locals and visitors will enjoy breakfast at the bakery itself, in the "Stehcafe" - literally, "standing cafe". These are usually a corner of the shop with tall tables which you stand at rather than sit at. Orange juice together with coffee or tea or hot chocolate will fit nicely. The breakfast in hotels will also look more or less that way.
You can also order this breakfast setup in some or the other cafe or pub, but you'd have to know the good places at first, if you don't want to end up with a poor dish. There are 3 Starbucks coffee shops along Königstraße (a 4th in the high-end district on Calwer Straße). But don't look for low-fat muffin or cream cheese options.

Drink[edit]
Stuttgart has developed a vibrant nightlife with many clubs and pubs in the heart of the city. The most popular street for clubbing is the Theodor-Heuss-Straße ("Theo"). Several bars, clubs and lounges have opened here. During the summer, there are also many opportunities to have a drink outside. In the "Theo" you can listen to good house, drum'n'bass, hip-hop and other kinds of electronic music. However it is not always easy to get into most clubs because of the restrictive door policy!
For a more laid-back atmosphere try the area surrounding the "Hans-im-Glück" ("Lucky Hans") fountain just a stone's throw from Königsstraße. In this charming quarter in Stuttgart's old town centre, many pubs and bars are crammed next to each other. Especially in the summer months a unique southern flair mixed with a great party scene with open-minded people make this area special.
Concerts, nightclubs and events are covered by local magazines (generally not in English). Try Lift and Prinz[dead link].
Because street drinking is still legal in Germany budget-travellers can save some money if they buy their drinks at a supermarket. A beer is there, e.g. only €0.50 compared to €3 and more in pubs. There are two of the REWE supermarkets at the beginning and the end of the Königstraße. There you can buy cheap snacks, softdrinks and alcoholic drinks from Monday to Saturday up till 22:00. Lots of young people do so and hang around the beautiful Schlossplatz.

Bars and pubs[edit]
48.780489.177281 Palast der Republik, Friedrichstraße 27. In a former public toilet house, the "palace" is the place to hang out in hot summer nights. Get your beer at the fastest barkeeper you've ever seen and find your place outside (maybe on the ground). 
48.773699.177752 Mata Hari (Hans-im-Glück-Brunnen). At the Mata Hari you can get exotic beer in an old-fashioned tea-house style. At long tables and benches young folks sit together and drink their beer. Contact to others comes therefore almost automatically. 
48.773029.172333 Biddy Earlys. A good place to go where everyone speaks English is Biddy Earlys, an Irish pub just west of the city centre/Königstraße, a 5-minute walk from the major public transport station "Stadtmitte" (S-Bahn, Stadtbahn). Keep a sharp eye because the entry is a mere doorway wide which leads down the stairs to the basement. Good bands on the weekends. €2-3 cover, €4 on weekends (plus a bag charge if you have a backpack). Everybody always welcome and you don't have to apologise for your poor German here!

48.774269.176446 Kap Tormentoso, Hirschstr. 27. Noble café atmosphere in the first floor. In the basement mostly alternatives and hipsters sit on benches and drinks itself straight through the great drinking menu. Gets very crowded on weekends with a laid back outside area.

The "Kiste" (means "box": indeed a tiny club) charges €5 (added to the drink) for a concert, daily starting at 21:00 or 22:00. The "Bix" named after Bix Beiderbecke offers local to top-class-acts, entry from about €7-30, depending on the artist. 
48.776719.173949 Suite 212, Theodor-Heuss-Straße. to 05:00 on weekends. A posh bar/lounge with minimalist, urbane and undercool interior. People in the smart casual look sip their cocktails or wines around the large dance floor. On weekends the bar changes into a big party club exemplary for the night-life on the "Theo" party street. 
48.771689.1793510 Fou Fou. A stylish champagner bar in a conglomerate of brothels and hotels letting rooms by the hour called the "Bohnenviertel" (Bean Quarter) between Hauptstätter Str. and Olgastr.

48.772579.1742617 Boa Disco, Tübinger Straße 12. Established in 1977 and still famous for the after-work-party that starts at 18:00 with a free buffet. Especially on Thursdays it gets very crowded so try to get on the guest list a few days before.

48.820239.1744519 [dead link] Penthouse, Heilbronner Str. If you're looking for a posh club, you can try the Penthouse. In such places, it's hard to be overdressed. But even if you "dress to impress", there's no guarantee that the doormen will let you in. 
48.805179.1745120 Perkins Park, Stresemannstr. 39. Also a posh club outside the city centre.

Old Town Hall in Stuttgart-Plieningen
To stay in the city centre (Mitte) around the Königstraße is probably the nicest, but also most expensive option. Still in walking distance are the beautiful districts of West and Süd. Other accommodations further out in the districts Nord, Cannstatt, Feuerbach or Vaihingen are perfectly reachable by public transport. If you intend to arrive by car check at the hotel for parking possibilities. If you have an early morning flight, it is possible to spend the night in the airport, as check-in areas stay open at night.

48.785499.1747612 Kronen Hotel, Kronenstraße 48 (Mitte).

Connect[edit]
The main telecommunications provider in Germany is Deutsche Telekom which trades under the names of T-Home (for landline phones), T-Online (for Internet connections) and T-Mobile for mobile communications. Anything relating to these companies are easily identified by the bright pink "T" logo. There are often shops in German towns called "T-Punkt" (Literally T-Point) where you can buy cell phones and get other information.

Net[edit]
Commercial WLAN-Hotspots are available at the airport and few other places.

Stay safe[edit]
Stuttgart is quite safe. Even at night one may walk alone through the city without fear. One rare exception is the central city park, which should be avoided during late night hours. The biggest danger for a pedestrian in Stuttgart is probably the cars (or the bicycles in the parks). As the city centre is at the bottom of a relatively deep valley and the traffic situation is far from satisfactory, Stuttgart has an endemic smog problem that gets worse when the weather "traps" the air in the valley. While there are attempts to combat the air pollution, for example by issuing discounted or free public transit tickets on smog days, the problem is likely to persist for some time.
Pretty much the whole state of Baden-Württemberg is a risk zone for ticks. Some of them spread encephalitis or borreliosis. So keep your feet covered or use repellant in forest areas.
