Oran (Arabic: وَهران, Wahran) is the second largest city in Algeria and the capital of Oran province, with more than 1,500,000 people. 


Understand[edit]
Oran's beautiful sea shore, constructed under French rule, was inspired by Nice's seafront. It consists of a long boulevard lined with cafés, restaurants, and ice cream shops. The boulevard also offers a splendid view of the sea, the harbour, Santa Cruz and the cliffs ("les Falaises"). It was renamed "Boulevard de l'ALN" by the government after the independence but it is still called Front de Mer by the locals.

History[edit]
Santa Cruz Fort, the largest of the three historic forts overlooking Oran. Built between 1577 and 1604 by the Spaniards.
Present-day Oran was founded in 903 by the Azdaja and Ajissa Berbers who lived in the area. It was captured by the Castilians under Cardinal Cisneros in 1509, and Spanish sovereignty lasted until 170 when the city was conquered by the Algerians during the Siege of Oran (1707–1708). Spain recaptured the city in 1732. However, its value as a trading post had decreased greatly, so during the reign of King Charles IV the city was recaptured in 1790-1792 by a coalition of Algerian troops against Spain which resulted in victory for the bey of Oran despite the many attempts in 1563. The beylik lasted until 183, when the city fell to the French.
Under French rule during the 19th and 20th centuries, Oran was the capital of a département of the same name. In July 1940, the British navy shelled French warships in the port after they refused a British request to surrender; this action was taken to ensure the fleet would not fall into German hands, as the Nazis had defeated France and occupied Paris. The Vichy government held Oran during World War II until its capture by the Allies in late 1942, during Operation Torch.
Before the Algerian War, 1954–1962, Oran had one of the highest proportions of Europeans of any city in North Africa. In July 1962, after a ceasefire and accords with France, a mob attacked European neighbourhoods and massacred hundreds of Europeans in Oran, This triggered a larger exodus of Europeans to France, which was already underway. Shortly after the end of the war, most of the Europeans and Algerian Jews living in Oran fled to France. In less than three months, Oran lost about half its population.

Connect[edit]
Stay safe[edit]
Oran is considered a safe city. Just use some common sense: avoid wearing expensive jewellery or looking flashy, do not flash large quantities of cash, and avoid unfamiliar and deserted areas at night. If you walk in crowded streets or use a bus, keep a hand in your pockets. Women should avoid low-cut tops, midriffs, or shorts to avoid harassment (which almost always consists of comments, but nothing physical) although this is less of a problem than in other cities. Don't feel the need to be polite.
