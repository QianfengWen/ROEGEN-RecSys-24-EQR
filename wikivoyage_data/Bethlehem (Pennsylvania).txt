Downtown Bethlehem, January 2007
Bethlehem is one of three cities, along with Allentown and Easton, that are the urban population centers of the Lehigh Valley in eastern Pennsylvania.
In the Lehigh Valley, Bethlehem borders Nazareth to its northwest, Allentown to its east, Hellertown to its southeast, and Easton to its east. The city is about 70 miles (110 km) north of Philadelphia, the sixth-largest city in the United States, and about 80 miles (130 km) west of New York City, the nation's largest city. 


Understand[edit]
Bethlehem Steel was one of the world's leading steel manufacturers for most of the 20th century. In 1982, it discontinued most of its operations, declared bankruptcy in 2001, and was dissolved in 2003. Many of its now dormant steel stacks and buildings are still standing in honor of the influential role the company played in America's Industrial Revolution.
In 1741, the town was settled by a small group of Moravians (a persecuted Protestant religious group from modern-day Germany and Czech Republic) led by Count Nicolaus von Zinzendorf.  Bethlehem was founded on Christmas Eve and named for Jesus' birthplace, Bethlehem, Israel – presumably because it was mentioned in the Christmas carols that were sung by the Moravians.
During the Industrial Revolution, Bethlehem Steel became one of the largest steel companies in the world; its principal rival at the time was Andrew Carnegie's U.S. Steel in Pittsburgh. San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge was built from Bethlehem Steel, as were many of New York City's largest skyscrapers. Through two world wars, Bethlehem's Steel was strategically vital for shipbuilding. By the early 1980s, local coal and steel makers were struggling as prices were undercut by imports; in 1982, Billy Joel sang "Out in Bethlehem they're killing time, Filling out forms, Standing in line" in a popular tune named for nearby Allentown. In a pattern typical of the US rust belt, huge factories built for economies of scale when times were good were being out-manoeuvred by smaller, more modern competitors with lower costs and more advanced technology.  By 2001, the factories had closed; the bankrupt company was disbanded in 2003.
In 2019, the city had a population of about 76,000, and is a thriving with a beautiful historic district, many cultural events, two colleges, an industrial museum and a large casino/entertainment complex.

By car[edit]
Driving is relatively easy in the Allentown/Bethlehem area, when compared to Philadelphia or New York City roads.  The highways and expressways can be very congested at rush hour, and local drivers on US 22, I-78, PA 33, PA 309 and PA 378 can be reckless and exceed the speed limit at times.  Local streets can be clogged at rush hour, mostly on the South Side.  Some roads are not for an inexperienced driver.  Rental car companies can be found at the Lehigh Valley International Airport.

Parking[edit]
Bethlehem has many lots and a few public garages to park in.  The North Street and Walnut Street garages are located in Center City, and the Riverport garage is on the South Side. The rate is $1 per hour, or $6 maximum rate (all day). For details, including directions and a complete list of parking lots and garages, the Bethlehem Parking Authority's website is listed here.  In addition to garages and lots, metered parking is available throughout the city. The rate is $0.50 per hour from 8AM-9PM.

By bus[edit]
Lehigh and Northampton County Transportation Authority (LANTA) provides affordable bus transportation in and around Bethlehem and the surrounding cities of Allentown and Easton. LANTA provides a Metro Plus service for those who are unable to ride the regular Metro due to disability or requirement of special attention. Schedules are available online.  The majority of LANTA buses serve mainly to link the three downtown areas of Allentown, Bethlehem, and Easton, and if you're not staying/going in these areas, the bus service can be impractical.  Service centers around the main depot at Broad & Guetter Streets, and fans out in every direction.  The cost is $2 a ride, $3 for a day pass, with discounts if you buy in bulk.
By taxi[edit]
Several taxicab companies are in the Lehigh Valley.  Taxis do not often drive around the streets, like in New York City.  In the Lehigh Valley, you will often need to call ahead and arrange for the taxicab to pick you up.

Quick Service Taxi Co. provides service throughout Allentown and Bethlehem.  They can be called at ☏ +1 610-434-8132.
Lehigh Valley Taxicab Co. operates out of Bethlehem and serves the Lehigh Valley.  They can be contacted at ☏ +1 610-867-5855.
On foot[edit]
The best way to see Bethlehem's Historic District is on foot.  Just about all its notable landmarks are on Main St., or close to it.  When referring to places along Main, "the top" of Main is at the intersection of Main and Broad, which is on top of a hill; "the bottom" is at the Brethren's House, and all points past there.  If you want to walk to the South Side (not recommended; save your feet by forking over the two bucks for the bus), go over the bridge at the bottom of Main next to the Hotel Bethlehem.  Make a left when you reach another bridge, the Hill-to-Hill Bridge.  When you get to the end of the bridge, turn left on 3rd or 4th St. to reach the South Side.  There are also several pathways which lead to the Monocacy Creek from Main St.

Do[edit]
Wind Creek Bethlehem is a large casino with table and sports gaming, restaurants, and shopping, located at 77 Wind Creek Blvd.
If you were to give a typical building in each of Bethlehem's two main destinations, the Historic district would be "18th-century industrial museum" and the South Side would be "college bar" (or as of late, "casino"). If you don't fit either of those (and especially if you have kids) you'll still find stuff to do; you'll just need a car and maybe a GPS to get there. Most of the city's parks, recreational facilities, sports teams, etc. are on the outskirts of the city, and the bus system leaves a lot to be desired here.

In 2008, Liberty High School won Pennsylvania's Division AAAA state championship in football. Although Liberty won in 2008, Freedom Football and Freedom Family have raised some of the biggest football stars, including Joe Young and Dwyane Johnson, and have beat Liberty for many years in a row. In addition to football, Bethlehem's girls and boys basketball and wrestling events are also very highly attended.

Eat[edit]
Main Street in Bethlehem, January 2007
Downtown is where most of Bethlehem's most popular restaurants are located, but for the best bargains, you'll have to venture into the residential neighborhoods of the town.

Broad St., known as "Restaurant Row."

Drink[edit]
If you're new to Pennsylvania, you will learn that there is always a place to drink, no matter where you are. There are many more bars than those listed here. With thousands of college students attending Lehigh University, Moravian College, and Northampton Community College, Bethlehem has its fair share of bars. Most are located on the South Side (close to the school) on 3rd and 4th Sts. You can find places to have a drink downtown too, but these cater more towards a more touristy, older crowd. The Historic District, particularly Main St., is well-preserved and clean, and the city government prefers to keep it that way; head to the South Side for a more uptempo scene, and stick to downtown for a more relaxed atmosphere.

A number of hotels are located on Airport Road near LVIA and the immediate areas surrounding it. Most hotels are located on the outskirts of town along Route 22.  If you're going downtown figure about a 10-15 minute drive, cab, or bus ride.  For those who would prefer to stay downtown, the Comfort Suites on the SouthSide of downtown Bethlehem and the Hotel Bethlehem on the North side are your two options; the locations are great and are some of the best places to stay in the entire city.

Stay safe[edit]
Bethlehem by most accounts is relatively safe for a city of its size.  Most visitors to the downtown areas or the Sands Casino won't encounter any sort of crime or danger.  Some areas of the Southside off of 3rd St. can be sketchy at night, and Lehigh students have a notorious reputation for drinking, so be wary of visiting at night if you'd rather not deal with inebriated college kids.  The same type of drunken misconduct can also break out late at night during Musikfest as patrons make more trips to the beer tent, and it occasionally results in scuffles on and around Main St. (which gets extremely crowded around at closing).  If you use common sense and don't stray from the main attractions you should have no problems, and Bethlehem is far safer than neighboring Allentown or Easton.

Connect[edit]
Seasonal greeting cards[edit]
Seasonal greeting cards may be sent with a "Bethlehem" postmark, one of about a hundred U.S. towns with Christmas or holiday-themed names (others include places like "Antler", "St. Mary" and "North Pole"). Holiday wellwishers outside the Bethlehem community can get the postmark by affixing postage to individual cards and then placing them all in a larger stamped envelope addressed to “Christmas Re-Mailing, Bethlehem, PA 18016". The cards must arrive in Bethlehem by December 15 to be postmarked and get to their destinations before Christmas.
Phones[edit]
In Bethlehem, like all Lehigh Valley locations, you must dial an area code when you place a call. Area codes in the Lehigh Valley are 610 and 484.
