Plant City is in Hillsborough County in the Tampa Bay Area. Incorporated in 1885, it is known as the "Winter Strawberry Capital of the World" because over three-quarters of the nation's midwinter strawberries come from Plant City.


Understand[edit]
City hall
The city is known for its strawberries, particularly during the winter season, but this is not the origin of the city's name. It was named after railroad developer Henry Plant. The town's first name was "Ichepuckesassa," a Native American name, but pronunciation challenges caused it to be renamed, first to "Cork" after the city in Ireland, until Henry Plant's railroad brought economic success to the town.

Climate[edit]
Plant City is known for having higher quality soil than the surrounding area. As is found across much of Florida, the wet season lasts during summer, with the "dry" season occurring across the other months. Rainfall is fairly high throughout the year, with a total of 56 in (1,400 mm) in an average year, enabling strawberries to grow.

As a part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad — or the "A Line" — and the Seaboard Air Line Railroad — or the "S Line" — it connected Plant City to major Florida cities including Tampa, Sarasota, and Miami. At its peak it was Florida's second busiest hub after Jacksonville and was used by farmers to ship millions of quarts of strawberries per year. It closed in 1971 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places four years later. It was redesignated as a railroad museum in the 2010s after years of restoration.   (updated Jun 2021)
