Lopburi (ลพบุรี), also Lop Buri or Lob Buri is a historic city 3 hours north of Bangkok in the Chao Phraya Basin region of Thailand. Lopburi has a mountain called Khao Chan Daeng.


Understand[edit]
Lopburi is very laid back, and its convenient location less than 3 hours (~180 km) from Bangkok makes it a good place to escape the stress and pollution of the capital.

History[edit]
Lopburi, formerly known as Lavapuri or Lavo is one of the oldest cities in Thailand. Thus the remains of almost all periods of Thai history can be found. According to the "Chronicle of the North", it was founded in 468 AD by colonists from India, who named the place after Lava, a son of Rama and Sita in the Indian Ramayana epic. Around the 7th and 8th centuries, it was one of the main centres of the Buddhist Dvaravati network. After the 10th century, the city belonged to the sphere of influence of Angkor. There is some debate whether it was a mere province of the Khmer Empire, or a semi-autonomous polity ruled by a Viceroy.
In the 13th century, it came under Thai influence. Lopburi was one of the roots from which Ayutthaya emerged in 1350. Lopburi remained the second capital of the Siamese kingdom. Typically, a younger brother or the eldest son of the king resided in Lopburi, ruling as a "second king" and heir presumptive. The city's importance waned when Phitsanulok became the "second capital" in the 15th century.
In the 17th century, however, King Narai moved his favourite residence from Ayutthaya to Lopburi, spending eight months a year here. A French traveller of that time wrote that Lopburi was "for the kingdom of Siam what Versailles is for France". Narai was open to Western influences, inviting French missionaries and making the Greek adventurer Constantine Phaulkon one of his leading ministers. Lopburi was abandoned after the overthrow of King Narai by anti-Western forces in 1688. Parts of the ancient city were restored in 1856 by King Mongkut (Rama IV) who made Lopburi his summer residence in 1864.

Orientation[edit]
There are two central areas in Lopburi: New Town and Old Town. Most of the important sites, plus the train station, are in the Old Town; buses arrive and depart from the New Town.

Monkeys[edit]
Lopburi is famous for the hundreds of crab-eating macaques that overrun the Old Town, especially in the area around Phra Prang Sam Yot and Phra Kaan Shrine, and there's even a monkey temple/amusement park where you can buy snacks to feed to them.
Keep an eye out for monkeys hanging from trees and wires and sitting on roofs and ledges, and be aware that they have some unpleasant bad habits including defecating on unsuspecting pedestrians from their overhead perches, jumping on people to snatch food and stealing bags that they suspect may contain something edible.

Dogs[edit]
At night nothing much is going on in the Old Town, thus the street dogs consider everybody running around after midnight very suspicious. While most of them will just look at you, some might bark, run behind you and jump at you. While common at night, it is very rare during the day.

Buy[edit]
If you are going to be in Lopburi long-term, you will need the services of the two department stores. There is a Big C mall in town, with a KFC, along with a Tesco Lotus in the Monkey Mall further down. The latter has a very large outdoor market in the evenings.

Eat[edit]
The street vendors in the Old Town are very nice and have all kinds of tasty things. In the evenings, a lot of street food stalls are set up on a road in front of railway station.

14.78788100.606171 Bualuang, 46/1 Moo 3, Tasala (In the New Town, about 6 km from old city), ☏ +66 36 614227. Cash only. 
14.78843100.676552 Louis Steakhouse (On Phahon Yothin east of the large roundabout around 1/2 km from Big C under the pedestrian overpass). A great restaurant owned by a Belgian. A great change if you are looking for something a little different from Thai food. 
 New World Steak House (Just west of Sakal, the large town centre with the fountains, just to your left before you cross a bridge, at the lights (look for a rather large hotel next to it)). Good English cuisine. Run by Barry and Noi, an Englishman and his Thai wife. The prices are higher than typical Thai food, but the steaks are huge, the Shepherd's pie is excellent, and sometimes has tacos. 
14.800625100.613733 White House (Just behind (north of) the Tourism office (TAT)). Romantic Western architecture with a beautiful yard and second floor, offers good food. Crab meat fried rice and red curry is very good. The owner, Mr Piak, speaks English and will tell you everything you need to know, even if you don't dine there. 
Drink[edit]
You might find the nightlife in Lopburi fairly quiet for a town of its size but there are a selection of places to catch a drink in the evening. Old Town has a few curbside bars, which are excellent for those who are still new to Thailand, as there are usually some foreigners about. There is also a small club (look for the large "Ben More" sign) next to a local park near the train station in the Old Town, but it is a little pricier than average.
The centre of town has a variety of places, from hole in the wall local dives, to "The Bank", a disco that is frequented by Lopburi's young crowd, but is not recommended for foreigners unless you know your way around well. Uptown has few drinking establishments on the main road, but there are a variety of karaoke bars and such down the back roads. Some of these out-of-the-way places are OK for a drink and some offer short-term female company but this not recommended for the newcomers.

 Butterfly Bar, Phayakamjad Rd (Across street from Narai Palace). 12:00-. Nice little street side bar with beer, whisky and food. Gung and Steve are great hosts and the bar stays open until there is no one remaining. There are usually a few Westerners hanging around. 50 baht. 
Sleep[edit]
Old Town[edit]
Hotels in the Old Town offer generally similar medium scale standards for 140-500 baht. The monkeys run around freely, but usually stay in just one small area. Depending on your preference you can choose a place with lots of monkeys running (and hanging) around, or opt for somewhere with low or no monkey presence.

Places with lots of monkeys[edit]
 Lopburi City Hotel. Probably the best of the hotels within the monkey area, and enclosed in a big "cage" that keeps the monkeys out, so you can open the windows. All rooms are air-con. 300+ baht. 
 Muang Tong Hotel. The least likable hotel in the monkey area. It's not enclosed in a "cage", so opening the windows isn't a good idea. However, it does have the best view of the monkey area and the Phra Prang Sam Yot temple. Rooms have Thai-style bathrooms with squat toilets. 
14.80181100.614391 Sri Indra Hotel. Enclosed in a big "cage" that keeps the monkeys out, so you can open the windows. The rooms are neat and clean, but don't expect more. 200+ baht.
