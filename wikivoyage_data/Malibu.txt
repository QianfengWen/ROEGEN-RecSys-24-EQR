Malibu is a beach city hugs the Pacific Ocean, north of Santa Monica in the northwest corner of Los Angeles County. Because of the town's location on the ocean and the proximity to downtown L.A.'s studios, Malibu has become a fixture in American culture, and has been featured on popular TV shows such as Two and a Half Men and Hannah Montana.


Understand[edit]
Malibu and its beaches are frequently listed as one of the must-see spots of the West Coast and the United States in general. However, the popularity of this city of 11,000 people (2020) is at odds with its residents. Local politics in Malibu are dominated by measures to keep outsiders out and to slow the growth of the city to keep it from turning into other beach side towns like Santa Monica or Newport Beach. Politicians and citizens alike often vote in favor of measures that make it more difficult for tourists to visit Malibu. These range from regulations on services like AirBnb to refusing to stripe additional parking spots at popular beaches. Malibu is a beautiful location worth visiting, but be aware of parking restrictions and other difficulties when attempting to see its beautiful beaches.

Get in[edit]
34°1′30″N 118°45′18″WMap of Malibu

Take Pacific Coast Highway (California State Route 1) north from Santa Monica. From Los Angeles International Airport, take San Diego Freeway (Interstate 405) north to Santa Monica Freeway (Interstate 10) west. The Santa Monica Freeway intersects the Pacific Coast Highway in Santa Monica. If driving on a weekend, expect traffic on PCH and very limited parking at the beaches.
LA Metro bus 134 provides service to Malibu from Santa Monica and Washington/Fairfax transit center.

Get around[edit]
The main (and pretty much only) route through Malibu is along the Pacific Coast Highway. It's the "main street" of Malibu. PCH runs the length of the town and is really the only way to get from one side of the Malibu to the other.
