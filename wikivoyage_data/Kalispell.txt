Kalispell is a town in Montana, near Glacier National Park. The name of the town means "flat land above the lake" in Salish, a Native American language. The population is about 23,000 (2016).


Understand[edit]
Kalispell is the largest city in the Flathead Valley.  The Flathead Valley is a unique area of Montana created by the forces of glacier processes. The valley is a testament to the wonders nature can create.
Today, the Flathead Valley offers a variety of recreational activities including skiing (considering world class Whitefish Mountain Resort is nearby), fishing, camping, water sports, climbing and old fashioned exploring. The city of Kalispell is full of shopping and restaurants and is also just north of Flathead Lake, which is the USA's largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi.
A number of smaller towns surround Kalispell giving visitors a chance to explore. Find additional restaurants and picturesque views in Evergreen, Lakeside, and Somers.
