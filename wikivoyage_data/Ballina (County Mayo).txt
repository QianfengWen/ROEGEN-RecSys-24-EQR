Ballina is a town in County Mayo in the west of Ireland, on the banks of the River Moy near its estuary. Known in Irish as Béal an Átha, "mouth of the ford", it's a small market town, with a population in 2016 of 10,171. There's not much to see here but it has a good range of accommodation and other amenities. So Ballina is the main base for sights in the north end of Mayo, around the villages of Killala, Ballycastle, Foxford and Crossmolina. 
The TIC is within the Chamber of Commerce on Pearse St, open M-Sa 10:00-17:00. 


Understand[edit]
Salmon Weir Bridge
In 1798 the United Irishmen sought to reform and free Ireland along the lines of revolutionary America and France. Rebellion broke out in May, with the promise of French military backing, but promptly flopped. It only took hold in County Wexford, but the rebels could never break out of this enclave, and after six weeks they were crushed. So it was already too little, too late when a French expeditionary force landed at Killala in August - but they took the British completely off guard, captured Ballina and Castlebar, and marched on across Mayo for eleven days before being encircled. The French surrendered while the Irish were hacked down where they stood. So although this was just a brief coda to the main rebellion, 1798 has passed into legend as "The Year of the French". 
There was a final landing attempt in Donegal in November, but the Royal Navy captured them, including the rebel leader Wolfe Tone. A rattled London government sought a tighter grip and in 1801 created the United Kingdom, henceforth ruling Ireland and Scotland as simply a collection of counties with no pretensions to be nations. So this unlikely corner of Ireland was the starting place of the UK.
Many thousands of Irish emigrated in the aftermath, even before the famine. Among them were the Blewitt family, ancestors of US President Joe Biden, who visited Ballina in 2023.

Get in[edit]

See[edit]
In town[edit]
Town centre has many Georgian and Victorian buildings. The monument along Circular Road is to General Humbert, who led the French invasion of 1798. The two river bridges were built 1835-36; traffic flows clockwise round town and over them, and is often backed up. A little way upstream, Salmon Weir footbridge resembles a fishing rod bent by a catch; Ridge Pool behind the weir is a famous fishing spot.
The Jackie Clarke Collection is a small museum and gallery open T-Sa 10:00-17:00, enter from Walsh St.
St Muredach's Cathedral (RC) on the east river bank was built from 1827.
Dolmen of the Four Maols is on the lane up Primrose Hill, just west of the railway tracks into Ballina station. It's a burial cist from 2000 BC but in legend the four maols (meaning "tonsured ones", ie monks) slew the rightful king of Connacht; they were chopped into quarters and buried here, all 16 bits.
Further north[edit]
54.171-9.1431 Rosserk Friary is the substantial ruin of a Franciscan Friary established in the 1440s. It's open 24 hours, the access lane is paved but narrow.
54.202-9.1772 Moyne Abbey is an even more substantial ruin. It too was Franciscan, completed in 1462 in Irish Gothic style. Open 24 hours.
54.212-9.2213 Killala is a fishing village north along the coast. It was an ecclesiastic centre, as shown by its nearby monasteries, and has a Round Tower. St Patrick's Cathedral (C of I) is from the 1670s and in its graveyard is a 9th century souterrain. But Killala is best known for the French invasion of 1798 - they landed at Kilcummin a few km north then swiftly captured Killala and Ballina. They came too late to support the rebellion of United Irishmen, already crushed in its stronghold of County Wexford; nevertheless they caught the British off-guard, brushed aside opposition at Castlebar, and marched on for 11 days before being encircled. The French surrendered, while their Irish supporters were hacked down where they stood
54.238-9.2444 Rathfran Friary or "Priory of the Holy Cross" was Dominican, founded 1274. It's open 24 hours.
Rathfranpark Wedge Tomb is on the lane west of the Friary, just south of the turn-off. Built circa 2500-2000 BC, it's a 3 m grave passage oriented to the rising sun. Until the 1950s there was a stone circle nearby, but it was uprooted and the stones dumped onto the tomb.
Breastagh Ogham Stone is just north of that turn-off. It's probably of similar age to the tomb, with the inscription added much later, say 550-900 AD. This is very faint but reads: : ᚛ᚂᚓᚌᚌ[--]ᚄᚇ[--]ᚂᚓᚌᚓᚄᚉᚐᚇ᚜ / ᚛ᚋᚐᚊ ᚉᚑᚏᚏᚁᚏᚔ ᚋᚐᚊ ᚐᚋᚋᚂᚂᚑᚌᚔᚈᚈ᚜ which (to save searching for an online Ogham translator) means "Legescad, son of Corrbrias, son of Ammllogitt" - he was probably the grandson of a king of Connacht.
Kilcummin north of the Friary was where the French came ashore: there's a sculpture but that's all. Sheltered in the bay round the headland, Carrowmore Beach and Lacken Strand have fine beaches. On a hilltop west of the bay, Lacken Gazebo is probably a late 18th century folly.
54.323-9.3455 Downpatrick Head is the rugged headland further north, with Dun Briste the chunky offshore sea-stack. There's also a church founded by St Patrick, and Pul Na Sean Tinne a collapsed sea cavern which in rough weather becomes a large blowhole. To aircrew the headland is better known as "Eire 64" for the aviation marker - one of 83 etched around the Republic's coast, this one has been preserved.
54.28-9.3726 Ballycastle is a small village which has been described as "on the periphery of the periphery". There's an arts centre but the castle is gone. It lacks accommodation, but see Sleep for Stella Maris on the coast nearby. The main thing to do here is avoid confusing this village with Ballycastle in County Antrim.
54.307-9.4587 Céide Fields, Glenurla, Ballycastle F26 PF66 (8 km west of Ballycastle on R314), ☏ +353 96 43325. Daily mid-March-May, Oct 10:00-17:00, June-Sept 10:00-18:00. Field system dating to 3500 BC, when the area was warmer and forested. Stones were cleared from the fields into walls, and the land was tilled with ox-drawn wooden ploughs with stone culters. There wasn't a village centre, but a scattering of round-house dwellings with herb and vegetable gardens and their own fields. At some point the climate became colder and wetter (which forest clearance may have exacerbated), the area became boggy and the fields were abandoned. They became engulfed by bog until the 1970s discovery of the extensive walls. The site is on the coast above 100 m cliffs. The visitor centre is a pyramid, presumably to indicate that it was built much later than the field walls. Adult €5, conc €4, child €3.   (updated Feb 2021)
A wild coast stretches west: follow R314 then the winding lane through Geeveraune, eventually to Benwee Head and the Stags of Broadhaven.
Further south[edit]
54.07055-9.3112158 North Mayo Heritage Centre, Enniscoe House (see Sleep), ☏ +353 96 31809, nmhreception2018@gmail.com. M-F 09:30-16:00. Small museum and heritage centre. (updated Feb 2021)
54.108-9.2549 Deel Castle is the ruin of two buildings. The original tower house is 16th century; in the 18th century a new wing was added and a country house "Castle Gore" built alongside. This was burned down by the IRA in 1922 while the old castle subsided into natural ruin. It's fenced off, but you see enough from the farm lane.
Céide Fields above the cliffs
54.053-9.26310 Errew Abbey was Augustinian, founded in the 6th century but rebuilt in 1413. It was probably a priory outpost of Crossmolina not an independent abbey. The ruin is on a peninsula in Lough Conn, and just north is Templenagalliaghdoois, a medieval oratory or nunnery.
54.031-9.32311 Addergoole on R315 has a memorial to the 14 villagers who emigrated aboard  Titanic: eleven were lost in the sinking. See also the commemorative stained glass window in the village church just south.
53.98-9.11512 Foxford is best-known for its woollen mills, and for salmon-fishing on the River Moy. The Foxford Way is an 86 km hiking circuit.
54.012-9.36813 Nephin is the isolated peak rising west of Lough Conn. See Castlebar for walking trails.
See Newport for points further west, including Ballycroy National Park and Belmullet Peninsula. They're easily reached by car from Ballina.
