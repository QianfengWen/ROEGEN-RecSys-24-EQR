Trashigang Dzong.
Trashigang is an administrative town of 4,500 people in Eastern Bhutan. The traditional architecture and narrow streets give the town a quaint and snug feel, not unlike an Italian or Cornish fishing village.  


Understand[edit]
Trashigang serves as the largest town in the eastern region, and a base for tourists venturing into the surrounding villages and mountains. It was once the centre of an important trade route with Tibet.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Yongphulla Airport was officially opened to domestic flights in December 2011. Flights are operated by Drukair and Tashi Air to Paro, although due to regulatory requirements of the runway and poor financial results, most flights have been suspended. Check the individual airlines for current information.

By road transportation[edit]
From Thimphu there are two routes, both requiring two days:

On the northern route, there are direct buses that make a night stop at Jakar and pass through Mongar.
The southern route passes through Phuentsholing, where you'll need to arrange private transportation to Samdrup Jongkhar, as there are no buses on this route. This leg of the journey passes through the Indian states of West Bengal and Assam. From Samdrup Jongkhar, there are direct buses to Trashigang.
Get around[edit]
As the town is nothing more than a few streets, everything can be visited on foot.
