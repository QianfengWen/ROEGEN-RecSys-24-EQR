Understand[edit]
Lying by the border of Belize, Chetumal is much more than a mere travel hub between Belize and Mexico. It offers many tourist attractions.  English is fairly generalized, whereas Spanish happily coexists with Maya, Criole, Lebanese Arabic and an impressive set of the growing multinational population of the city. There is a bit more than 260,000 Chetumaleños.  The City of Chetumal is the capital of the Free and Sovereign State of Quintana Roo, and the capital of the Municipio (County) of Othón P. Blanco.  Othón P. Blanco is the only municipio of Mexico, that has land borders with two nations (Belize and Guatemala), thus sharing this characteristic with the state of Quintana Roo.

History[edit]
The city was founded by the military, in 1898, who had the mission of protecting the borders (after more than 50 years of disagreements) accorded by the governments of Mexico and Great Britain. A lot earlier, it had been a Mayan realm governed by Nachan Ka án. He was given two Spanish slaves, one of whom was Gonzalo Guerrero. Guerrero assimilated to his new society, learned the language and taught new war tactics to Nachan Ka án's warriors. With this knowledge, the warriors defeated incoming Spanish conquistadors and Nachan Ka án became a great leader. He made Guerrero a captain and gave him one of his daughters, Zazil Há. Guerrero and Zazil Há had many children who are known to be the first mestizos in America by matrimony. For this reason Chetumal is called Cuna del Mestizaje (cradle of the Mestizo).

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Chetumal offers a limited selection of flights to cities in Mexico and the US. It is also possible to fly to Belize City (BZE IATA) or Corozal (CZH  IATA) across the border in Belize, and cross by land into Chetumal. Another option is to fly into Cancún or Merida. From the city of Merida go first and second class buses to Chetumal. From the Cancún International Airport take an ADO bus to Playa del Carmen. And from there a first or second class bus to Chetumal.

18.504667-88.3268471 Chetumal International Airport (3.5 km west of city center). Inside the building is only a Multiva ATM with a withdrawal fee of M$67 ((pesos, Nov 2021). From the airport go shared taxis to Bacalar. A taxi to the center is about M$70 (April 2022). Locals usually walk 7 min out of the airport area on a shaded sidewalk. At the intersection of the street Antonio Pl. you can catch a local taxi for M$30 (April 2022) to the city center. Agree on the price before. The driver may offer you the ride for M$70, but you can haggle it down easily. When the driver asks you, if you have a reservation of an accommodation for the upcoming night, just answer "yes".

By car[edit]
Mexico's Federal Route 186 traverses the sparsely populated southern half of the Yucatán between Escárcega and Chetumal. After Ucum, the only municipality with services such as gas and lodging between Escárcega and Chetumal is Xpujil. Federal Route 307 branches off Route 186 to the north towards Cancun, from a point about 30 km west of Chetumal.

By bus[edit]
Several bus companies offer routes across the Peninsula from Escárcega, or north from Cancún and other cities on the Mayan Riviera.
There are two ADO terminals:

18.51875-88.3135672 ADO Terminal Chetumal. This terminal is where all ADO first and second class buses arrive and depart from. Inside the building is a Santander ATM. The terminal is located about 4 km northwest of the center. A taxi to the city center is M$25-30 (April 2022). There are also colectivos to the city center (near the Mercado viejo) for M$8 (April 2022), they just don't go to the south of the center and don't operate on Sundays. (updated Apr 2022)
18.504662-88.2964433 ADO Chetumal Centro. It's in the city center and served by all ADO second class buses, which are operated by Mayab. (updated Apr 2022)

Taxi from there is easy and around M$30-50. It can take a long time to get everyone through the border, so bus may arrive very late. You can message them on WhatsApp to find out the estimated time of arrival. Passengers are almost all backpackers.
When leaving Mexico at the Belize border, you will be charged a tourist tax fee of M$594 (Oct 2021).

To get a bus to Belize, you go to old ADO terminal. Buses from old Ado terminal to Belize City run fairly often via Orange Walk where a break of 15 minutes is usually scheduled. These buses are older and have no A/C, and they stop often. Once you arrive at the old ADO terminal, someone will approach you and tell about the schedules. These guys are working for the bus company and not just there to rip you off.
The new ADO terminal also has a service to Belize but it's less frequent and more expensive.

By boat[edit]
You can also get a boat from Chetumal to San Pedro on the island Ambergris Caye, from where you can continue to the island of Caye Caulker or to Belize City. A one-way trip from Chetumal to San Pedro is US$71, to Caye Caulker US$77 on Belize Express Water Taxi. You need to book the tickets in advance.
The office from San Pedro Water Taxi seems to be closed and there are no boats from them at the docks - but you can purchase tickets online - it's unclear if they're still operating. (Aug 2023)
