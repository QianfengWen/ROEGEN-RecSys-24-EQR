Bygd in Nuuk Fjord
Nuuk (Greenlandic meaning "The Headland"), also known by its Danish name of Godthåb (Good Hope), is the capital and administrative centre of Greenland, with a population of around 15,000 (about a quarter of the entire population of the country). The city is sometimes accused of being rather soulless, with many high-rise blocks.


Understand[edit]
Climate[edit]
Nuuk, along with most of the population centres of Greenland, has a tundra climate. Being on the coast helps moderate temperatures somewhat, and winter temperatures are not unlike those of northern Europe or central Canada. However, unlike in those regions, summers remain quite cool. For example, in July, the warmest month of the year on average, the daily mean temperature is only 7 °C (45 °F), with highs rarely above 15 °C (59 °F).
Autumn has the highest rainfall and snowfall, although it is fairly steady all year round.

Get in[edit]
There are no roads or railways connecting cities within Greenland. The only practical means to travel is by boat or air. On foot is less practical and far more strenuous.

By plane[edit]
The capital's airport, because of length constraints of its runway, only accommodates small aircraft and domestic flights. Flying to Nuuk from abroad requires changing from a large airliner to a smaller aircraft at a neighbouring airport like Kangerlussuaq. The airport's runway and terminal facilities are being expanded so that they can service large aircraft, slated for completion in late 2024.

64.191733-51.67781 Nuuk Airport (GOH  IATA) (about 4 km northeast of town).   
Air Greenland offers connections to various destinations in Greenland, including Kangerlussuaq which has flights to Copenhagen, a major airport. During the summer months they fly to Keflavík Airport, Iceland.
Icelandair flies year-round to Reykjavík (domestic airport), three times a week during the summer and twice a week during the winter months.
