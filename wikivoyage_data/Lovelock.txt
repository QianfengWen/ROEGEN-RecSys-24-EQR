A more or less ghost town (though it has a few inhabitants) where Mark Twain spent some time. The historic encampment is comprised of cabins and shanties (including supposedly Twain's) that line the road for a ways, just below the lofty heights of Star Peak. Road beyond I-80 is improved dirt/gravel at times and remote so prepare adequately.  (updated Oct 2021)

Gambling[edit]




If you win...
Chances are that, if you win it big in Lovelock and you are not a U.S. citizen your winnings will be subject to a 30% withholding tax from the Internal Revenue Service. That $10,000 slot winning can dwindle quite quickly if that is taken off the top. Not to worry though you can reclaim your gambling winnings tax through a 1042-S form. You should get this from the casino so don't lose it: it is your starting ticket to getting your gambling winnings back.
