Boppard is in the Middle Rhine Valley in the Rhineland-Palatinate of Germany. It's on the west bank of the Rhine, at a point where the deep river gorge slaloms sharply (the Bopparder Hamm) before continuing north towards Koblenz. It's been a settlement from Celtic times, and its geography made it a strategic site for the Romans. It has many interesting old buildings and is a regular calling point for Rhine river cruises, while the hills above are used for wine-growing.
