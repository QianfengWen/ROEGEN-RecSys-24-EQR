 Bass Hole Boardwalk at Gray's Beach (end of Homer's Dock Road, off Route 6a). Most people can't say the name with a straight face! Nevertheless it is one of the best places in Yarmouth to see a great sunset in the summer. The boardwalk stretches 868 feet into a salt marsh over the Bass River, so bring lots of bug spray.
