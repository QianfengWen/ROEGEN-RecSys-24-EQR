Go next[edit]
No visit to Brazil would be complete without a visit to the Pantanal, 150,000 km² of wetlands in the heart of South America. It is the largest wetland area in the world, known for its rich variety of unspoiled plant and wildlife. Visitors to the Pantanal will be struck by a vast number of species difficult to find anywhere else in the world. And because the landscape of the Pantanal is open - and not dense like the rainforest - wildlife is particularly easy to spot.
Others options:

Campo Grande
Bonito
Dourados
