Ukiah is a city in the North Coast of California. It is the Mendocino County seat, and is the working center of the county.

Just as picturesque as its coastal brethren, Ukiah is in a valley surrounded by beautiful rolling hills or small mountains.  It's a good base for exploring Mendocino County. The Ukiah area is historically a source of lumber and wine grapes, and hosts a variety of small unusual shops and restaurants.
