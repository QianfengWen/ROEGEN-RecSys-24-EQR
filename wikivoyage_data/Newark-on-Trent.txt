Newark-on-Trent is a market town in Nottinghamshire, on the edge of Sherwood Forest, with a population in 2011 of 27,700. It’s best known as the place where King Charles I surrendered during the English Civil War.


Understand[edit]
Newark Castle
Newark has been a transport hub at least since Roman times. "Fosse Way" swings inland to avoid the Humber but here reaches the River Trent, which is navigable. The town prospered through wool and cloth, and in the early 11th century it was owned by Lady Godiva, she of the legendary naked ride. King John died here in 1216, a year after signing Magna Carta. When the English Civil War broke out in 1642 over the powers of the monarch versus parliament, Newark supported the Royalists. But by 1646 Charles I was defeated across England and surrendered at nearby Southwell village; in 1649 he was beheaded. His son Charles II continued the war until 1651 but then fled into exile, and Britain became a republic. Castles that had resisted parliament were demolished, so Newark Castle became a ruin.

Get in[edit]
By air[edit]
The nearest airport is East Midlands Airport (EMA IATA) (30 miles, 50 km). This has good connections across West Europe, including Edinburgh, Glasgow and Belfast. For anything further afield, use the London airports.
A shuttle bus connects EMA with East Midlands Parkway railway station, with direct trains to Newark Castle. EMA airport buses also run from Nottingham, Derby, Leicester and Loughborough.

Newark stands on the A1 some 120 miles (192 km) north of London, at the junction with the A46 and A17. You’ll know you’re close when you see the steaming chimneys and silos of the British Sugar plant at Kelham just west of town. The junction is messy, especially when there’s a big event at the Showground, watch out for standing traffic queueing back onto the A1.

53.0776-0.81261 Newark Castle is effectively just a municipal garden with a tall old wall along one side, so it's more use for wedding photos than for withstanding a siege. But that's intentional: Newark and many other English castles were partly demolished after 1648, not in the heat of battle, but to prevent them from ever being used again by rebels. (This policy was commemorated by Gracie Fields in her song “I’m one of the old ruins that Cromwell knocked about a bit”.) The castle was partly restored in the 19th century and what's left is the west curtain wall, with a watergate onto the River Trent, and a gatehouse. It's free to access in daylight hours, and occasional tours of the towers, undercroft and dungeons are run.
The Governor's House is a fine timber-framed house of 1474 on Stodman Street, but it's nowadays empty, having most recently housed a Greggs which has moved next door.
St Mary Magdalene north on Church Walk is Anglican and the largest parish church in the country. It was begun in 1160, mostly built in the 14th / 15th century, and restored in 1855. Local legend has it that a cannonball shot during the Civil War hit the spire and caused the small hole that is visible from just outside the church gardens on Mount Lane. Entry is free.
53.0765-0.80652 National Civil War Centre, 14 Appletongate NG24 1JY, ☏ +44 1636 655765, civilwarinfo@nsdc.info. W-Sa 10AM-5PM. In the 1640s, England was convulsed by the bloodiest war ever fought on its soil, which escalated into the "War of Three Kingdoms", and replaced an absolute monarchy with a parliamentary republic. This museum looks at the national context and local impact. Long-standing exhibitions display The World Turned Upside Down and Fake News, a theme even then. They also hold the Newark Torc, a fabulous Iron Age gold alloy bracelet found locally in 2005. Adult £8, conc £7, child £4.  (updated May 2022)
53.096-0.75743 Newark Air Museum, Drove Lane, Coddington NG24 2NY (by showground), ☏ +44 1635 707170. Daily 10AM-5PM. The flat terrain of Lincolnshire is well-suited to airfields, which during the Second World War were bases for RAF Bomber Command. The museum has a large collection of mid-20th-century military aircraft. See also Newark Cemetery: many members of the Polish Air Force served in this region and are buried there. So too was General Sikorski, their wartime Prime Minister and military commander, but his remains were repatriated to Krakow in 1993. Adult £10, conc £9, child £5.   (updated May 2022)

The Queen's Sconce is the last remaining sconce in Newark. Sconces were large earthworks designed as forts during the civil war. the Sconce is preserved in Sconce Hills park, a large open area with several football pitches that see frequent use by Newark Town Football Club, a small orchard, a park and a café. Newark did have two sconces, the other being called the King's Sconce and was where Northgate retail park is now.

53.081-0.93925 The Workhouse, Upton Rd, Southwell NG25 0PT (Bus 28), ☏ +44 1636 817260. Feb-Oct: W-Su 10:30AM-4PM (daily in Aug). Early poverty relief was organised by parish churches, but this was overwhelmed by the 1820s economic slump. Relief was then industrialised by the creation of workhouses - you could serve gruel into 160 small bowls more efficiently than a score of parishes each supplying a handful. But you must ensure that the place is as miserable as possible, to deter all but the most desperate. Southwell's gaunt Workhouse was built in 1824 and was a prototype for those that sprang up all over Britain and Ireland, and is the best preserved. The infirmary was added in the 1870s. The complex later became an asylum and refuge for victims of domestic abuse. It's now run by the National Trust. Adult £13.20, child £6.60, NT free. (updated May 2022)
53.078-0.9556 Southwell five miles southwest of town has a splendid Norman minster, Gothic east and Romanesque west as they built in stages while dismantling the Saxon predecessor. The Bishop's Palace was wrecked in the Civil War but the Great Hall has been restored. The minster is open M-Sa 8:30AM-6:30PM, Su 8AM-4:30PM. Southwell village is charming redbrick Georgian, pity about the traffic. Here, rather than at Newark, is where King Charles I surrendered; he was then taken to nearby Kelham Hall.

Su-F 10AM-4:30PM, booking recommended.

 Sherwood Forest 11 miles northwest was home to the legendary and entirely fictional Robin Hood. What’s factual is that this is the last stand of primeval forest in England. Everything else is a later planting, so the eco-system is unique, with the gaunt ancient oaks.
Lincoln is a must-see, with its cathedral and castle enclosing a picturesque historic city centre.
Major cities within an hour or so by train include Nottingham, Sheffield, Leeds and York.
