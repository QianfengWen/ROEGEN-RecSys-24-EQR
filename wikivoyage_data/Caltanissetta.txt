Overview of the city of Caltanissetta
Caltanissetta is a medium-sized city in central Sicily, Italy.
It features a rich and long history, the first settlement dating to the 19th century BC.
The city still has traces of the different cultures which followed one another in Sicily: its current structure dates to the 10th century AD and is due to the Arabs, while many additions were made during Norman times and under the Aragonese rule of the Moncada family.
During the 19th century, the city grew in wealth thanks to the extraction of vast nearby sulphur deposits. With 88 mines in its territory, Caltanissetta was nicknamed the world's sulphur capital.
During the third decade of the 20th century, there was a period of intense cultural activity — so much that famed writer Leonardo Sciascia called it a "little Athens".
After the Second World War the city started a slow decline and is now one of the provincial capitals with the highest unemployment rates in the country.
It is particularly famous for its Easter rituals, which take place from Palm Sunday to Easter Monday. Because of the similarity in their Easter traditions, Caltanissetta is twinned with the Spanish city of Seville.


Get in[edit]
Caltanissetta Central Station.
By bus[edit]
The bus station is in front of the train station and a ten-minute walk from the city centre.
Many companies operate routes to Caltanissetta, linking it with other cities in Sicily and the rest of Italy. The main Sicilian destinations served with the highest frequency are:

Palermo circa 10 times per day, with a stop at Palermo's central railway station, in turn connected by train with the airport.
Catania circa 15 times per day, including an intermediate stop at Catania's airport and a final stop at the central railway station.
Agrigento circa 15 times per day. Due to the fact that the Catania-Caltanissetta line continues on to Agrigento, this route benefits from the same high frequency.
Enna circa 6 times per day to "Enna bassa" (the modern part of the city) and circa 8 times per day to "Enna alta" (the ancient part).
Gela circa 7 times per day.
The companies operating services to and from Caltanissetta include SAIS Autolinee, Interbus, SAIS Trasporti, and Astra.

By train[edit]
The city is served by two train stations: the central station and the Xirbi station, which lies outside the city.
The central station is a stop in the Caltanissetta-Gela-Syracuse, Caltanissetta-Agrigento, Catania-Agrigento, and Caltanissetta-Palermo lines.
Xirbi station is also important, as it lies on the most trafficked Sicilan line: the Catania-Palermo line.
Trains from Catania to Palermo stop at Xirbi and passengers directed to Caltanissetta can then transfer to a shuttle train, whose departure times are synchronised with the Catania-Palermo timetable.
All train passenger traffic is handled by Trenitalia.

Industrial archaeology and visits to inactive sulphur mines[edit]
Central Sicily and the Province of Caltanissetta in particular are scattered with many former sulphur mines (Zolfare). Some of these have been turned into industrial archaeological sites and are open to visits. In the following, we list the closest to the city proper. The Mines Touristic District website [formerly dead link]  contains extensive information on most of the mines in the provinces of Caltanissetta, Agrigento and Enna.

37.5121314.0927628 [formerly dead link] Gessolungo Mine (Solfara Gessolungo).   One of the oldest, deepest, and most profitable mines. Mining activity in the area was recorded already at the beginning of the 18th century. It was the theatre of many accidents in which hundreds of miners lost their lives. The most notable is probably the 1881 accident in which 65 miners died, including 19 children. Because of their agility and small size, children (known in Sicilian as Carusi) were used extensively in the mines. Those who died at work were buried in a nearby cemetery, the Cimitero dei Carusi, which is nowadays open for visits.
37.50878714.1275649 [formerly dead link] Trabonella Mine (Solfara Trabonella).   It is one of the earliest mines to open and, again, one of the deadliest ones.
