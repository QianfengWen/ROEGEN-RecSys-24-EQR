Idaho Falls is a city in Eastern Idaho. Idaho Falls serves as the commercial, cultural, and healthcare hub for Eastern Idaho. The city attracts many tourists visiting nearby Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, Jackson Hole, and fishing on the Snake River. Due to its proximity to high-profile outdoor destinations, in 2009, Idaho Falls was named to National Geographic's list of the "100 Best Adventure Towns".


Understand[edit]
It is the county seat of Bonneville County and the largest city in Eastern Idaho.  It has a population of about 63,000 (2019) and the metro area has about 145,000 people.

Neighborhoods[edit]
Downtown - Historic downtown Idaho Falls sits on several blocks of the original townsite along the east side of the river. It features restaurants, plazas, shops, and cultural amenities including the Museum of Idaho, Colonial Theatre, Art Museum of Eastern Idaho, Idaho Falls Public Library, and Japanese Friendship Garden. It is home to the Idaho Falls Farmers' Market and many other community events.
The Numbered Streets - The numbered streets area was the first planned neighborhood in Idaho Falls. The streets run west and east between South Boulevard and Holmes Avenue. Traffic on the odd-numbered streets travels east, and west on the even-numbered streets. Kate Curley Park is located in the neighborhood, as is the Wesley W. Deist Aquatic Center and the Eleventh Street Historic District.
West Side - The West Side houses Idaho Falls Regional Airport and I-15. It has retained more of a small-town feel than the east side, which has grown and developed much more rapidly since the 1980s.
Snake River Landing - SRL is a large, mixed-use development on the west side of the river near I-15, which includes residential, restaurant, park, and community event space, including a planned mid-sized indoor arena. It now hosts the Melaleuca Freedom Celebration, a large Independence Day event.

By plane[edit]
43.5136-112.0711 Idaho Falls Regional Airport (IDA  IATA) (in the northwestern part of town, 3 mi (4.8 km) northwest of downtown Idaho Falls. It can be accessed from via Grandview Dr/US Hwy 20 from I-15 (Exit #119)). It has services from Salt Lake City on Delta Connection; Denver on United Express; Seattle on Alaska Airlines; and Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Oakland, Orange County, Portland (Oregon) and  Phoenix/Mesa with Allegiant Air.

Often the cost of flying in/out of Idaho Falls is not economical. For this reason, many residents of Idaho Falls drive to Salt Lake City International Airport SLC IATA. Salt Lake City is 213 mi (343 km) to the south. Typically, this drive takes about 3 hours, but due to weather and Salt Lake City traffic it can easily take an additional hour. During the winter months the drive time can significantly lengthen due to poor visibility and road conditions.

By car[edit]
Idaho Falls can be easily reached by I-15 (North / South) or by Highway 20 (East / West). The Utah border is about 120 miles south, the Montana border is about 75 miles north, the Wyoming border is about 72 miles to the east, and the Oregon border is about 334 miles to the west. Another way is to come in through US-20 from Yellowstone and Rexburg.

Get around[edit]
Map of Idaho Falls
There are several rental car companies, and most have representatives at Idaho Falls Airport.
Idaho Falls is small and the majority of the hotels are located centrally enough that a small walk will get you to most destinations. The distance to some locations would warrant a taxi service.  There is fair competition in the taxi business and service is very good for a town this size. You can generally get a ride anywhere in town and even Ammon, which borders Idaho Falls, for under $15 (Idaho Falls city limits, $10). It is more economical to rent a car if you have several destinations over the duration of a day. If you have fewer than five or six stops, taxis are excellent. SafeRide and Easy Way Taxi offer 24/7 service.
