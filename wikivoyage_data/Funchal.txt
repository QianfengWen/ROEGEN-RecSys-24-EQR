Funchal is the capital and main city of the autonomous region of Madeira, on the island of Madeira, in its south between Santa Cruz and Câmara de Lobos. In 2021, it was home 106,000 people.


Understand[edit]

But when you look closer you see all the tropical plants that build the basis, completed by hundreds of plants from all over the world, so all year round there are plants blooming. The main part of the park is formed by several gardens: a French Garden, a Sunken Garden, the Ladies Garden, a Rose Garden and some more. Opposite the main gate is a Tea House, which is connected to the golf course. They serve some good tea, cakes, pastries, snacks and small lunches. The way back to the main gate is formed by the Camellia Avenue, a flourish firework between end October and March.The park is at 500 m altitude. 09:00-11:30 the park is often crowded by bus tourists, so choose the afternoon for a more laid-back visit.
