Deer Lodge is a town in western Montana. About 3,000 people live there. 
The Montana men's state prison has been here for a long time. The old prison complex, in the heart of town, is now the Old Prison Museum. A complex of other museums is scattered through the town center.


Understand[edit]
Before Europeans and settlers arrived, this area was unclaimed by first nations. People from the west, such as the Pend d'Oreilles, passed through here on the way to buffalo hunting, and horse races were held here. A small hill with salt licks and shelter against winter winds attracted deer to gather here, leading to the name "Deer Lodge". Lewis and Clark's expedition passed near here in 1805-6, the first recorded visit by settlers. More visitors passed through during the early 19th century. In 1860, European-American settlers established permanent residence here, notably Johnny Grant. His ranch site is preserved. The Oregon Treaty between the US and Britain made this area official part of the USA.  
In 1869, the Montana Territorial Prison was built here, and the town of Deer Lodge was laid out. Nine years later, the first university in Montana was established. It closed in 1914.  The town, the prison, and its modern successor, remain here to this day.

Get in[edit]
Interstate 90 runs nearby, giving access by automobile from the northwest (Missoula) and the southeast (Bozeman). U.S. Highway 12 passes about 12 miles to the north in Garrison, connecting to Helena. 

Get around[edit]
This is the West, distances are large and transit is scarce. You will need an auto to get in and to many parts of town. The heart of town is small and flat, so it's possible — albeit hot in the summer — to walk between the sights.
