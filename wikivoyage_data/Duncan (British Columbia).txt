Understand[edit]
Duncan City Hall
Although the City of Duncan has a population of just under 5,000 (2016), it serves the Cowichan Valley which has a population of approximately 84,000, many of whom live in North Cowichan and Cowichan First Nations (Indigenous) reserves. People in areas of North Cowichan and bordering on Duncan usually use "Duncan" as their mailing address.
The name Cowichan is an anglicization of Halkomelem Quw̓utsun̓, which means "the warm land".
Duncan has a large Indigenous community and is the traditional home of the Cowichan Tribes, who are the largest band among the Coast Salish people. The Coast Salish men and women of the Cowichan Tribes are makers of the world-famous Cowichan Sweaters.
