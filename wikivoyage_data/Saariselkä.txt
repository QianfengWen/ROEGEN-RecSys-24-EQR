Saariselkä (Sámi: Suoločielgi) is a largish winter sports centre in the municipality of Inari high up in Finnish Lapland, some 250 km north of the Arctic Circle and nearly 1000 km away from the southern capital Helsinki.

The Saariselkä village.
Nestled in a valley, Saariselkä is a compact strip of a village with one gas station, one main supermarket, one liquor store and a slew of hotels, shops and restaurants, but it's quite manageable on foot and located only 30 km away from the town of Ivalo and its airport.  The neighbouring fells of Kaunispää and Iisakkipää, both equipped with ski lifts, are the primary slopes for winter sports. The hiking trails, skiing tracks, biking routes and snowmobile tracks of Saariselkä also cover the villages of Laanila and Kakslauttanen (3 km and 10 km southward) and Kiilopää (6 km east from Kakslauttanen), which may be regarded as part of the same tourist resort.
Saariselkä is also used as a base for hikers and cross-country skiers going to the Urho Kekkonen National Park or Hammastunturi Wilderness Area.


Understand[edit]
A succession of ice ages and their glaciers scraping back and forth has reduced what were once mountains into gentle rounded fells (Finnish tunturi), barely reaching 500 m. The valleys between them are sparsely forested, but the exposed summits are treeless.
Aside from the occasional Sámi reindeer herder, there wasn't much human activity in these parts until Konrad Planting struck gold at the nearby Lutto River in 1865. The Finnish gold rush started soon thereafter and the first claim in Saariselkä was staked in 1871. Enough gold was found that by 1902 the mining company Prospektor set up its headquarters here and hacked a cart trail down to Sodankylä, some 100 km away.
The gold rush slowly faded away, but in the 1960s the area started to gradually develop into a tourist attraction. Hotels and restaurants were built, skiing lifts were put up, and in 1983 the region stretching from Saariselkä to the Russian border – favourite hunting grounds of former president Urho Kaleva Kekkonen – were turned into the Urho Kekkonen (UKK) National Park. Ten years later Hammastunturi Wilderness Area was established between Saariselkä and the older Lemmenjoki National Park to the west.
Saariselkä is part of the municipality of Inari, which has some 7,700 inhabitants (including some 2,200 Sámi) on 17,321 square kilometres of land, while Kakslauttanen and part of Kiilopää are in Sodankylä.

Get in[edit]
Map of Saariselkä
Saariselkä is at national road 4 (E75) from Helsinki to Nuorgam, with several buses daily from Rovaniemi. You could come by plane to Ivalo, Kittilä or Rovaniemi or by train to Rovaniemi, and continue by coach.

By plane[edit]
The easiest method to get here is to take a Finnair flight from Helsinki to Ivalo airport (1 hr 40 min, price €100–250 depending on the season), and then a connecting 20-minute bus ride to Saariselkä. UK tourists may arrive at the airport of Kittilä, and take a three-hour road trip, via Sodankylä. The airport at Rovaniemi is likewise three hours away by coach.

By bus[edit]
Direct coaches from the south are cheaper than aeroplane, but involve a laborious 15 hr journey.
There are several connections daily between Rovaniemi and Inari, with stops in Saariselkä.
Saariselkä is quite well connected with northern Norway, with buses from towns including Honningsvåg (by Nordkapp), Karasjok, Vadsø and Tana bru, via Inari, Ivalo and Saariselkä to Rovaniemi. Some of these may drive only in summer.
From Sweden, you will probably come via Haparanda and have a transfer in Rovaniemi.
From Russia, you could take the weekly Murmansk service, with a transfer in Ivalo.

By train[edit]
An overnight train to Rovaniemi and a coach for the last three hours is a less painful but not particularly cheap alternative; the train is a viable option also if you want to bring your own car.

Get around[edit]
Once in Saariselkä, you can pretty much walk anywhere you want to, but if you have gear in tow just hop aboard the Ski Bus, which shuttles between the village and the slopes approximately once an hour (all day ticket €4).
The coaches to and from Ivalo pass Saariselkä, Laanila and Kakslauttanen several times a day, a few coaches go via Kiilopää as well.

The landscape is scenic and many tourists come to Saariselkä to gawk at the aurora borealis.  While they occur with a probability as high as 75% every night in season (November to March or so), they are all too often obscured behind a bank of clouds so don't count on it.

68.475327.4322 Magneettimäki. Memorial stones at the Magnetic Hill, 6 km north of Saariselkä. The national road 4 originally lead to Petsamo (Pechenga), with a winter harbour at the Barents Sea, especially important in 1940–1941. The steep gravel road used to be 5 m wide, and was so hard for lorries, the drivers thought there must be some magnetics involved. (updated Aug 2019)
Do[edit]

Saariselkä is more of a Do than a See destination.

Winter tours[edit]
In addition to the Northern Lights, there's plenty of standard Lappish tourist fare to keep you occupied during the day as well, ranging from husky safaris and reindeer-pulled sleighs to snowmobile and snowshoe treks through the countryside. There are quite a few operators to talk to. You could also go ice-fishing in one of the local lakes with a private guide, with a snack reindeer lunch cooked in a hunter/fisherman's cabin or spend the night on the treeless fells.

 Top Safaris, Revontulentie 1, ☏ +358 16 667-033. A safari company that offers a wide variety of safaris and is owned by the same people that run the Hotel Laanihovi. 
Winter sports[edit]
The fells nearby are excellent terrain for cross-country skiing, sledding and hiking, but somewhat puny for downhill since the maximum differential is on the order of 300 meters.  Alas, this is about as good as it gets in flat Finland... The ski lifts are one kilometre to north-east from the Saariselkä village, between the fells.
For extreme sledding, the legendary 1.5-km track down from Kaunispää can't be beat. Hold on tight and steer well!

Hiking and cross-country skiing[edit]
Duckboards across a swamp.
For hiking, there are 200 km of marked paths, 250 km of skiing tracks and vast areas for backcountry hiking in and by the Urho Kekkonen National Park. Most marked routes are near Saariselkä. For serious backcountry hikers, Tulppio near the south-east end of it is a hundred kilometres away, and to the north-west you can wander through Hammastunturi Wilderness Area, Lemmenjoki National Park and Pöyrisjärvi Wilderness Area to Øvre Anárjohka National Park of the Norwegian Finnmarksvidda, likewise a hundred kilometres away, with only two road crossings on all the journey.

68.381327.4941 Rumakuru. About 6 km from Saariselkä and from Laanila, by marked hiking routes or maintained skiing tracks. The steep and rocky Rumakuru is a product of the Ice Age.

Buy[edit]
The Kuukkeli shopping mall with the village's only grocery store, Alko, postal service and some other shops and services including winter sports equipment rental and cottage area front desk burned down in February 2022.

68.420927.40941 Partioaitta, Honkapolku, ☏ +358 10-549-4800. Outdoor equipment. 
Eat[edit]
The restaurant at the top of Kaunispää in winter.
Food in Lapland is expensive and fairly unimaginative, although if you haven't tried reindeer meat yet, then this is your chance. For a more memorable experience, try a set dinner in a Lappish kota tent, offered by a number of hotels and tour operators.

Drink[edit]
There are quite a few possibilities for after-ski; all the
hotels have restaurants and discos, and there is even a local microbrewery with a side line in distilled spirits.  However, Saariselkä has a deserved reputation for catering to the middle-aged market, standard musical fare is melodramatic Finnish tango and even the food is all reindeer and snow grouse. Hip snowboarding youngsters tend to head for Levi or Ruka instead.

68.419527.41771 [dead link] Saariselän Panimo, Saariseläntie 10. The local microbrewery, which does more than just beer: try Jellona Terwasnapsi, the home-brewed tar-flavored schnapps! A very authentically Finnish place in character.
