Huntington Beach is in Orange County in Southern California. Once known as Pacific City, it started as the southern terminus of the Golden West railroad line.


Understand[edit]
Huntington Beach is world-famous as "Surf City", from the 1960s Jan and Dean surf rock song of the same name, and much of surfing culture started and continues to evolve there, from surfing styles to surfing apparel companies that started there. Huntington Beach is also mentioned by name in the Beach Boys song "Surfin' Safari", where "at Huntington and Malibu they're shooting the pier".
The year-round temperature averages 67 °F (19 °C), and good weather can be had every month, though the months of January to March can be rainy.

By air[edit]
As with most of Orange County, Huntington Beach is served by John Wayne Airport (SNA IATA) in Santa Ana, which is 11 mi/17.5km to the northeast. SNA is served by many major carriers for flights from all regions of the U.S. and from the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento in northern California.
Long Beach Airport (LGB IATA) is also within close distance (17mi/27km to the west) but is dominated by JetBlue Airways, which serves 14 destinations from Long Beach: Oakland, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Chicago (O'Hare), Boston, New York (JFK), Washington (Dulles), Fort Lauderdale, Austin, Portland, San Francisco, San Jose and Seattle. American (Phoenix), Delta (Salt Lake City) and Southwest(Denver & Oakland) also serve Long Beach too.
Los Angeles International Airport (LAX IATA) is the largest airport in the area with connections from more destinations in the U.S. and internationally. It is 37 mi (60 km) away.

By car[edit]
Huntington Beach is located at the intersection of Beach Boulevard and the Pacific Coast Highway, just under 14 miles directly south of Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park. Interstate 405, which links John Wayne, Long Beach, and Los Angeles International Airports, intersects Beach Boulevard about 6 miles north of Huntington Beach.
Parking: The best place to park is the city parking located right at the beach. The entrance is just north of Highway 1 (the PCH) and the main street. You will conveniently be able to unload watercoolers, surf boards and the kids all safely without having to cross streets. It saves on lifting and lugging as well. You can wash off and change clothes right next to the parking at the water showers and washrooms. Washrooms are adequate but small. They also get wet and sandy during the day.
If you're on a budget, you can usually find some parking in nearby neighborhoods. But watch for street signs that may indicate parking is only allowed at certain times or days. This may require a little more walking if you're headed to the beach, but it's not too much.

By train[edit]
Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner and Metrolink's Orange County Line serve Santa Ana, Tustin, Buena Park, and Irvine.

See[edit]
33.711221-118.0612161 Bolsa Chica Wetlands. Huntington Beach boasts the largest unspoiled coastal wetlands in California where many migratory birds stop and nest. 
33.655977-118.0033092 Huntington Beach Pier. The second most popular sight here, after the beach itself.   
 Main Street. A shopping and gathering place for residents and tourists alike, with sidewalk cafes, surf shops and live music all vying for attention. 
Do[edit]
 Huntington Beach. It has some of the largest stretches of open-sand beaches in all of California, as well the Huntington Beach Pier (one of the longest concrete piers in the world), site of world-class surfing and volleyball events yearly. 
 Running/Walking/biking/rollerblading. There is a wide boardwalk right by the pier. It is part of the Huntington Beach Bike Path.  The Bike Path runs for about 8 miles along the beach.  Heading south along the boardwalk is likely your best scenic scenario.  Walking, riding a bike, running are all very safe. Many very good runners first thing in the morning - often as soon as the sun comes up. 
 Surfing. You can try your hand at surfing. There is a surf rental shop right at the boardwalk. Start with a boogie board for the day circa $15. There are many good surfers so they may get annoyed if you stand in the waves too long. Keep moving; this is your best bet. If you get tired get out (of their way) by heading to the hot sandy beach to rest up for more. 
 Relaxing. Take a walk up the main street. There are a number of restaurants and a Starbucks. 
 Partying. There are so many bars on Main St. that you can meet with friends at any of them and have a great time drinking, dining, or dancing. During the winter, you can organize a "pub crawl" and have your group stop for a drink at every bar. 
Peak season is from late May to early September.  The beaches on any given summer day may have as many as 500,000 visitors when it is particularly hot inland.

Stay safe[edit]
Crime is very low for such a large city, and violent crime is very rare.  However, the city has long had a reputation for skinheads and white supremacist activities.  Like some other parts of Orange County, Huntington Beach sometimes sees confrontations between reactionaries and people of color. If you are drinking, you should be far more concerned with local police than civilians. If you are drinking, call a cab because DUIs are illegal.

Go next[edit]
Travel north on Beach Boulevard and you will reach Buena Park, the home of Knott's Berry Farm.
North on Beach Boulevard and then east on Katella Avenue or Ball Road will take you to Disneyland.
Take the Pacific Coast Highway to San Juan Capistrano, Long Beach, Santa Monica, and numerous other seaside communities.
