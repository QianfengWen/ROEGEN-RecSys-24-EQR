Not to be confused with Blair Athol, a suburb of Sydney which is covered in Sydney/Macarthur
Blair Atholl is a village in Perth and Kinross in the Scottish Highlands, notable for its castle, and with a population of about 500. Ringed by the Cairngorm mountains and within Cairngorms National Park, it's on the main route from Perth to Inverness. The village is at the confluence of the rivers Tilt and Garry, amidst the last large patch of farmland in the valley (Gaelic: blàr, a field or plain). Further north, the route rises through Calvine and over bleak Drumochter Pass, before descending into the Spey Valley. So if you led an invading army of Jacobites, or a vengeful loyalist army in pursuit, you'd have to march this way.
Atholl Glens is the Visitor Centre, just west of the Tilt river bridge and open daily 9AM-4:45PM.

56.7787-3.93273 Falls of Bruar are at Pitagowan behind House of Bruar shopping centre. It's a spectacular series of pools, waterfalls and natural arch, as the Bruar Water cuts a gorge through the rugged landscape. Best viewed in full spate after heavy rain, and in autumn with the colours of the leaves. In the 18th century the poet Robert Burns was one of many visitors who found the setting barren, so he wrote a poem to the Duke of Atholl, as if from the river, begging for some trees to adorn it. The Duke set about planting the area and laid out the present path; William Wordsworth complained it was too neat.

Blair Atholl is too small for a stand-alone pub, try the Atholl Arms Hotel or The Loft restaurant.
Sorry, but Blair Athol (one "L") whisky distillery isn't here, it's in Pitlochry; it's still worth sampling. There's another in Dalwhinnie, then more than you can imagine on Speyside.

Connect[edit]
Blair Atholl and the A9 have 4G from all UK carriers. As of March 2024, 5G has not reached this area.

Go next[edit]
The valley of Strath Tummel leads west up to lonely Rannoch Moor, where the road dead-ends.
North you climb over Drumochter Pass to Dalwhinnie: either stay on A9 to descend into Spey Valley and Aviemore, or go west on A86 across the hills to Fort William, Ben Nevis, and routes to Skye.
It's a twisty slow road to go east across the hills, but you can go via Pitlochry and A924 to Kirkmichael and Glenshee; thence over the pass to Braemar and the Dee valley.
Or head south on A9 to return to the lowlands and  Perth.
