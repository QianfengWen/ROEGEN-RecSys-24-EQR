Erding is a city of 36,000 people (2018) in Upper Bavaria, Germany. Although the city is home to the world's biggest brewery for wheat beers, Europe's biggest spa, and Munich Airport is only 10 min away, the city has kept most of its small town charm and historical center.


Understand[edit]
The official history of Erding starts in 742, although hints of first settlements go back as far as 2500 BC. The settlement was appointed a city in 1228 by Duke Louis I of Bavaria. During the Thirty Years' War Erding was burned to the ground by the Swedes thrice. The citizens were able to rebuild the city, though, with the help of the newly implemented tax on beer. During the last days of World War II, Erding was bombarded before surrendering to American troops without fighting back. After World War II, the city grew continuously, and with the opening of Munich Airport, which is just north of the city, went into a boom, that continues.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Erding is well connected by plane through Munich Airport, which is 10 km (6 mi) north of the city. The airport is the second busiest in Germany and 7th in Europe, and offers a lot of flights to national, European, and intercontinental destinations. Bus 512 leaves the airport every 40 min and takes about 20 min to get to the center of Erding. The car drive to the airport takes about 10 min.

By train[edit]
The city has two stations: Erding, close to the city centre, and Altenerding in the south of the city, not far from the spa. Both stations are part of Munich's public transport system MVV and Erding station is the northern terminus of the suburban train (S-Bahn) line S2. The S2 serves the stations every 20 min and takes about 50 min to Munich Central Station.


By bus[edit]
Erding can be reached by bus from most surrounding cities and towns, like Freising, Moosburg, and Markt Schwaben, and Munich Airport (Bus 512) within Munich's public transport system.

By car[edit]
Erding is very well connected to the rest of Germany by the autobahn network.
