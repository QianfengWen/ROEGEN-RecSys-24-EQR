Puhoi[dead link] is a village in the Auckland Region, half an hour's drive north of Albany in metropolitan Auckland, in the North Island of New Zealand.


Understand[edit]
Puhoi is a historic village with a population of about 500. It was first settled in the 1860s by immigrants from Bohemia in the Czech Republic. At that time it was very isolated, with access being up the Puhoi River by boat. The term "up the Boohai", referring to the Puhoi River by a corruption of its name, became New Zealand slang for any remote rural location. The village has been used as a location for several films.
