Guérande (Breton: Gwenrann, literally "white land") is a town in the Pays de la Loire (Loire-Atlantique department) in western France.
"Ville et pays d'art et d'histoire"[1][dead link] since 2004, Guerande is famous for its medieval town. It is one of the rare cities to have to preserve his ramparts in its entirety. Guerande, it is also its Salt Marshes and her famous salt, "la fleur de sel".


Understand[edit]
Guerande is a medieval fortified town. During the Middle Ages, Guerande was the principal town in the estate owned by dukes of Brittany which covered the entire peninsula, the "Presqu'île Guérandaise". Its strategic position at the top of a hill gave it an overview of the ocean and a role as protector of the Salt Marshes.
The town entered a golden age with the last dukes of Brittany, who built its formidable ramparts. The period gave it charm, a picturesque flavour and an exceptional heritage which led the celebrated writer Balzac to describe it thus "Guérande is one of those rare towns to have retained the true physiognomy of the feudal centuries".

THE MEDIEVAL TOWN OF GUERANDE

The ramparts (XV-XVI)
In 1343, following the destruction inflicted on Guérande by troops commanded by Charles de Blois, Jean de Montfort demanded that the town be properly protected by improving its fortifications. Work started soon after and continued for more than a century, with the town's architecture adapted to reflect the latest artillery developments. It was not until 1488, or 145 years later, that these ramparts, by then complete, were inaugurated during the reign of Duke François II (father of Anne of Brittany), a few months before his death.
1434 m long, the ramparts are pierced by four gateways: St Michel to the east, Vannetaise to the north, Bizienne to the west and Saillé to the south).
