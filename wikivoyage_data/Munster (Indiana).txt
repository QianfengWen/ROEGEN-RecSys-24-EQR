Munster is in Lake County, Indiana. Today Munster is a quiet town that is in the midst of continual growth. The town is excellent at planning and has developed an award winning school system. Despite growing larger and larger everyday, Munster has a small-town friendly demeanor and one is always welcomed with a genuine interest.


Understand[edit]
Munster was designated as a town in 1907. Settled and established in 1845 by the Brass family when they built a two-story inn and tavern, Munster became very popular soon after in 1853 as a place for truck farms because of the growing market in the near-by Chicago. Munster began to grow as a community and grew in skilled worker men such as oil men, steel workers, and businessmen from the city.
