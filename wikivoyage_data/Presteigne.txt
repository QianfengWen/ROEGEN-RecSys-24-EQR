Presteigne (Welsh: Llanandras) is an ancient market town in the county of Powys in North Wales. Presteigne is considered by Country Life magazine editor Clive Aslet to be one of Britain's top 10 small towns. The town probably began as a small settlement around a Minister Church dedicated to St Andrew and at the time of the Domesday Book and formed part of the manor of Humet.


Get in[edit]
Despite lying on a minor B road the town has, in common with several other towns close to the Wales-England border, assumed the motto, "Gateway to Wales".
The town sits on the River Lugg, having nearby towns such as Kington and Knighton as neighbours, as well as surrounding villages like Norton and Stapleton.

By bus[edit]
Veolia Transport Cymru provide a service (Monday to Saturday) to Kington, Herefordshire with connections from there to Hereford on services operated by Sargeants, and buses in the opposite direction to Knighton, Powys. A once daily service from Ludlow to Builth Wells is also operated via Presteigne. Lugg Valley Travel provide bus links to Leominster.
