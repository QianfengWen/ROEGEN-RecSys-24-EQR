Not to be confused with Ekerö, the archipelago in Swedish lake Mälaren.

Eckerö
Eckerö is a scattered village and an island, regarded as part of mainland Åland. It is the port for the Eckerö Line, the shortest crossing from Sweden.


Understand[edit]
The medieval Eckerö church was built between 1380 and 1420, and it was mentioned for the first time as a chapel under Hammarland parish in a manuscript from 1427. The area has been permanently inhabited at least since the iron age but there are some stone age grave sites as well. Eckerö is located on its own island, which is separated from the Åland main island by the narrow Marsund strait. There is a bridge over the strait, making Eckerö officially part of "mainland Åland".
When the Kingdom of Sweden established its postal service in 1630, Eckerö became an important hub, as the dangerous sea voyage across the Baltic sea was shortest between the villages Grisslehamn and Eckerö – a route that is still in everyday use. Carrying mail across the sea soon became the main business for the locals. When Finland was annexed into the Russian Empire, a mail and customs office was built. The building was designed by the famous architects Carl Ludvig Engel and Charles Bassi. Compared to the surrounding village the building is hilariously oversize, as one of its most important functions was to show the power and wealth of the Russian Empire to the west.
Eckerö has 950 residents out of which about 400 live in the biggest village, called Storby. Most services and sights are in Storby, but the administrative centre is the tiny village Österby. The population trend in the municipality is slightly positive. The municipality has its own kindergarten and lower elementary school (grades 1–6).
Being actually the fourth busiest international passenger harbour in Finland, tourism is a major source of income here. Eckerö is also one of the sunniest places in the whole Nordic making the municipality a very popular destination – especially for the Ålanders themselves. Having several restaurants, hotels, camping areas, beaches etc. Eckerö is one of those few places outside Mariehamn having well developed resources for tourism.
