Yaotsu (八百津町) is a town in south-central Gifu. Most of Yaotsu's attractions are related to Chiune Sugihara, a Japanese diplomat who saved thousands of Jews from the Holocaust by letting them flee to Japan. Despite this, Sugihara's birthplace was in nearby Mino although he claimed Yaotsu was his birthplace during his lifetime.


Understand[edit]
Traditionally a part of Mino province, Yaotsu once flourished as a port town on the Kiso river under the Tokugawa Shogunate. Although off most tourist's radar, Yaotsu has been in the spotlight since the opening of the Chiune Sugihara Memorial Hall in 2000. It is a museum that tells the story of how Chiune Sugihara, as Japan's ambassador to Lithuania, saved thousands of Jews during World War II. Many of Yaotsu's tourists come from Israel, and most signs around the memorial hall are trilingual in Japanese, Hebrew and English.

Tourist information sites[edit]
The town government's Japanese website has a modest section on sightseeing which contains an English pamphlet in PDF.
Yaotsu Town Tourist Association has a more extensive Japanese website.
