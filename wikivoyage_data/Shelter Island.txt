Get in[edit]
In order to get onto this island, you must take either:

North Ferry, +1 631-749-0139. Take the Long Island Expressway (I-495) east to the last exit, exit 73. The off-ramp will lead you directly to Suffolk County Route 58 east. After about three and one half miles, County Road 58 will merge into Route 25 east. Continue on Route 25 east for about 20 miles to Greenport. Watch for signs marked "To Route 114 South." These signs will direct you to turn right onto Sixth Street. Drive one block and make your next left on Wiggins Street ("To 114 South"). At the end of Wiggins Street, ferry traffic makes a hard right turn and continues turning right to enter the final staging area. The ferry line takes you away from the ferry, around a loop, and back in line facing the ferry dock and passenger terminal.
