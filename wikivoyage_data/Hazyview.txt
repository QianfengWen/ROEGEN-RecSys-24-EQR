Hazyview is a town of 4,000 people (2011) in Mpumalanga province, a few kilometres outside the Kruger National Park. It is renowned for its large banana and macadamia nut industries. Most of the province of Mpumalanga's private game reserves are found just east of Hazyview. Hazyview is also a stop on the Panorama Route, a scenic road.
