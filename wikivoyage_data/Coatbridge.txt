Coatbridge is the main town of Monklands, a district on Clydeside in the Central Belt of Scotland, and historically part of Lanarkshire. Other towns here, which have merged, include Airdrie and Whifflet. The area is commuterland for Glasgow; The main reason to visit is the Summerlee Museum depicting its industrial era.


Understand[edit]
The Monklands were farmed by Cistercian monks from Newbattle Abbey near Edinburgh; the monks also mined coal. The 1799 Statistical Account described the area in lyrical terms: an immense garden with extensive orchards, luxurious crops, and where rivers abounded with salmon. Then the Industrial Revolution arrived. Airdrie became a weaving and textile town, while Coatbridge grew on pig iron from locally mined ironstone. The population burgeoned as a workforce was drawn in, principally from Donegal, but living conditions were squalid and Coatbridge was a hell-hole of blast furnaces. The iron industry withered in the 20th century (relocating to Corby) as local ores were exhausted and Clydeside shipbuilding declined. In 2016 the population was just under 44,000.
