Murten (German: Murten, French: Morat) is a predominately German speaking town located on the German/French language border in the Three Lakes area of Switzerland. 


Understand[edit]
It is a small town with approximately 8,000 inhabitants. Murten is noted as being one of the most attractive Swiss towns, especially for the extensive intact defensive walls that surround the old town. The Battle of Morat which put an end to Burgundian against the Swiss took place here in 1476, and cannonballs can still be seen in the town walls.

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
Murten is a minor station and thus is only served by regional trains. There are hourly direct connections from Neuchatel (25 min), Fribourg (30 min) and Berne (35 min).

By boat[edit]
