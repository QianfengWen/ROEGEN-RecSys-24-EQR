Kruševo (Macedonian: Крушево, Aromanian: Crushuva) is a town in western North Macedonia. Its location at an elevation of 1,350 m (4,430 ft), among the highest in the Balkans, gives it a degree of isolation. Historic Kruševo was in 1903 the centre of the Ilinden Uprising against the Ottoman Empire that led to the formation of a republic that lasted only 10 days but is seen as the prelude to the modern Macedonian republic. Today, the main celebrations of the national holiday Ilinden, on the 2nd of August, are held in Kruševo to commemorate that struggle for independence.

Kruševo is also known as the centre of the Vlach (Aromanian) minority in North Macedonia, though they form only about 20% of the town's 5,330 residents as of the last census. Vlachs and the Mijak group of Macedonians that inhabit the town are historically known for their building skills, giving Kruševo a unique collection of architecture. Hidden up in the mountains between the woods, Kruševo has managed to preserve this genuine appeal. The town has the same layout as a century ago and a great deal of traditional houses and buildings are preserved, so it is a good place to admire and learn about traditional architecture. The town is also a winter skiing destination, with a ski lift running right above the town.

Kruševo is known for, more or less, four things. One is being situated at a high elevation. This usually makes it a colder place to be than elsewhere in North Macedonia and also makes it a great place for winter sports like skiing. It is also known for being the site of one of the first republics in the Balkans following the Ilinden Uprising. Multiple museums in the town are devoted to this history. Kruševo is also known for its architecture, the result of the building skills of Vlachs and Mijaks. Kruševo is also known for being the hometown of legendary musician Toše Proeski, who died in 2007 at the age of 26.

History[edit]
The town of Kruševo was first mentioned in 1467 in Ottoman tax registers when it was a small Slavic settlement. It did not become a city and trading centre until the late 18th century. This was catalysed by large settlement by Vlachs (Aromanians), as well as some Christian Albanians and Mijaks (a group of Macedonians from western Macedonia). The Vlachs helped transform Kruševo into an organised city and, along with the Mijaks, they built quality buildings with fascinating architecture that is still visible in Kruševo today. The growing town had Bulgarian, Greek, and Romanian schools operating. Kruševo's population at the turn of the 20th century was 9,350. Over half were Slavs, while most of the rest were Vlachs.
The events for which Kruševo is best known occurred in August of 1903. The Ilinden Uprising was carried out by the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization against the ruling Ottoman Empire. On August 2 (the feast day of St Elijah, Ilinden), the Kruševo Republic was proclaimed and local school teacher Nikola Karev was named its president. Karev had written the Kruševo Manifesto which called upon all inhabitants of Macedonia, regardless of ethnicity or religion, to fight for independence from the Ottoman Empire. The Republic managed to last just 10 days before being squashed by the Turks. Despite this, it is considered a prelude to the independence of modern Macedonian republic and noted for being the first ever republic in the Balkans.
Along with the rest of Vardar Macedonia, Kruševo became a part of Yugoslavia following the World Wars and, later, part of the Republic of Macedonia.

People[edit]
Kruševo has 5,330 residents as of the last census, virtually all of whom are Orthodox Christians. Ethnically, Macedonians form 80% of the population while Vlachs form 20%. Kruševo is the centre of Kruševo Municipality with a total population of 9,684, which consists of 18 villages in addition to the town. In addition to Macedonians and Vlachs, there are significant populations of Albanians and Turks in these villages, who are primarily Muslims.

By car[edit]
As the highest town in North Macedonia, Kruševo isn't the easiest place to get to. Regardless of which road you take, it will involve much uphill driving along steep hills and cliffs, making it a tad scary for those with fears of heights. Potholes are also very common. Kruševo can be reached from three directions.

From the northwest, via P517
From Prilep and the east, via R1306
From Bitola and the south, via R1305
Get around[edit]
The town is small and pleasant for walking around and a walk through the woods to reach the monuments is recommendable. However, bring comfortable shoes as you will be walking uphill or downhill most of the time, regardless of where in town you are going.
The main road of Kruševo is called Toše Proeski Street (formerly Maršal Tito Street). It runs from road R1306 in the south and becomes road 517 as it passes through the city in the north.

A traditional home in Kruševo
Kruševo architecture – As the city was started from scratch, the Vlachs were willing to invest and the Mijaks were excellent builders, in Kruševo a very interesting architecture has developed. The houses are freestanding, mostly symmetrical, without open spaces typical for other towns in North Macedonia. The back of the houses are built of stone, while the front of so called “bondruk” construction of wooden columns and beams covered with white plaster. There is almost always a well in the ground floor. On the main facade usually there are painted decorations in blue colour. Blue is also usually used for the window frames and other details of the facades. On the upper floor there usually is a small balcony with a triangular pediment above it to put accent on the symmetry of the house.
