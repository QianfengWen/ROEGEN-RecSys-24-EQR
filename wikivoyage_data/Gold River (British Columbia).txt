Gold River is in Central Vancouver Island, close to its geographic centre. The village has a picturesque setting, and has developed tourism and sport fishing as its main economic supports, as a base for such activities as the Nootka Island trek, hiking the Elk Lake trail, climbing Golden Hinde mountain (Vancouver Island's highest peak), Crest Creek climbing crags, and the Great Walk.

Gold River developed in 1967 as a prototypical logging and pulp and paper industry community, and quickly sprang into prosperity and established excellent community facilities. Shifting world markets brought the mill closure in 1998, forcing many of Gold River's inhabitants to relocate. 
Gold River also serves as a historic point, being the closest village to the famous Friendly Cove, where British explorer Captain James Cook first set ashore.
In 2001, a two-year-old male orca, later named Luna, was seen in Nootka Sound alone as far inland as the marina at Gold River. Presumed to be an orphan separated from his pod, Luna became a local and international celebrity by his playful and curious behavior with lumber tugboats and recreational watercraft on Nootka Sound, and with people, including young children, on the Gold River dock. The popularity of Luna made Gold River an international attraction from early 2002 through March 2006, when Luna was killed in an accidental collision with a tugboat propeller.

49.6628-125.7471 Golden Hinde (The Rooster's Comb), 30 km southeast. At 2,195 m (7,201 ft), it is the highest peak on Vancouver Island. The mountain took its name from Sir Francis Drake's ship, the Golden Hinde, by an early fur-trading captain, who was reminded of Drake's ship as sunset hit the mountain (which is visible from the west coast of the Island) and in honour of Drake's reputed presence off the coast of the future British Columbia during the explorer's circumnavigation of the globe from 1577–80. The present name was not officially conferred until 1938, but this was done after a reference to the peak in a fur-trader's log. The alternative name "The Rooster's Comb" was used by early alpinists because of the mountain's appearance.   (updated May 2020)
