It borders on the Chinese province of Xinjiang and Ladakh. The tourist season is from April to October. The maximum temperature is 27 C and minimum (October) 8 C. Apart from its incomparable cluster of mountain peaks and glaciers Baltistan's five valleys, - Shigar, Skardu, Khaplu, Rondu and Kharmang are noted for their luscious peaches, apricots, apples and pears.


Get in[edit]
Awesome Shangrila
By plane[edit]
35.33555675.5361111 Skardu Airport (KDU  IATA). Pakistan International Airlines flies daily from Islamabad. However, since the pilots fly by sight with no computer navigation the flight only goes on clear days. During the flight it's possible to catch a glimpse of Nanga Parbat (the 9th highest mountain in the world) and K2 (the 2nd highest mountain in the world. The air journey is full of thrills and could itself be regarded as the highlight of the visit. After following the same air route, which connects Gilgit to Islamabad/Rawalpindi, the plane turns right and flies over the gorge of the Indus River.   
By car[edit]
Skardu can be reached by bus from Islamabad. The drive takes you all the way over the KKH (Karakoram Highway).
KKH is a newly built fully carpeted road. However, some areas alongside it are prone to landsliding, due to which it can get blocked and some patches might not have fully carpeted road. The road can take 16 to 20 hours by public transport (cost approx. 1500 Rupees).
It's also possible to get to Skardu from Gilgit. Though it's less than 200 km the journey takes close to 8 hours by public transport.
