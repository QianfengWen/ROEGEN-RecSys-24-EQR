Understand[edit]
The Pangaion Hills or Pangeo, Pangeon (Greek, Παγγαίο) is a mountain range in Norther-Greece, approximately 40 km from Kavala. The highest elevation is Mount Koutra (1,956 m). The Pangaio is located in the second row behind the Symbolo chain of hills by the Aegean Sea to the south sea surrounded by fertile plains of Philippi-Kavala-Serres in front of the Rhodope Mountains range to the north.

40.914924.2561 Elefteropolis. Elefteropolis is the largest town in the municipality of Pangeo with its approx. 5000 inhabitants and is the seat of the municipal administration. Here you will find the best shops including specialty shops and large supermarkets.   
The Pangaio is with almost 2000 m the highest mountain in the Kavala area, with picturesque mountain villages, a multitude of monasteries and impressive vegetation. At the foot of the mountains the vegetation begins with the typical Mediterranean maquis (low, crippled sclerophyllous plants) and then changes slowly, with increasing altitude, in a dense deciduous forest and further above finally in coniferous forest and then reaches the tree line. From there on only grasses and herbaceous plants (including the Greek mountain tea) grow.

Get in[edit]
The Pangaio area is easily accessible via the motorway, with departures at Orfani, Mousteni and Exochi / Elefteropolis. By bus you can reach the city of Elefteropolis from the bus station Thessaloniki or Kavala. The nearest airport is in Kavala. By train go from Thessaloniki to Drama and from there by bus to Elefteropolis.

Get around[edit]
You can reach almost all villages by bus from the bus station of Elefteropolis. You only need a lot of time. By far the best way to explore the area is by car. Rental cars are available in Kavala. Because of the often winding road, the area also has very nice motorcycle routes.

See[edit]
Coming from Kavala, the road at Eleferopolis divides into a northern and a southern bypass of Pangeon. Following the northern road, after 10 km you come to a crossroads to the mountain village

On the north side[edit]
40.942924.17831 Paleohori. Above the village starts the nice  'trail to the castle ruins'  (about 2km) with wonderful views over the massif and the plain of Drama. A number of good restaurants with stunning views are well worth a visit in the village. The village is centrally located and well suited to take up quarters here. You can reach both Elefteropolis as a larger town quite quickly, as well as Kavala, if you want to escape the quiet of the villages. Also the way to the beach is not far and the village center is nicely designed, so that one can stroll in the evening and then eat well in one of the restaurants. (updated May 2018)
After another 8km you come to the most famous mountain village of Pangeon
40.952224.14562 Nikisiani. Above the village there is the restaurant Kastanies" which is definitivly worth a visit due to the impressive views over the plain of Philippi and on the Pangaio mountain. Because of the altitude, it is refreshingly cool even in midsummer. From the end of the street at the restaurant , a very nice  'trail'  leads to a small waterfall (800m) and an old bridge (1600m). (updated May 2018)
The best-known attraction on the north side of the Pangeon is the
40.965824.10553 Ikosifinissa Monastery. (Μόνη Εικοσιφοινίσσης) It is located about 15 km from Nikissiani direction Thessaloniki. It is well signposted high on the mountain with superb paintings and impressive architecture in a fantastic location. A cafeteria in front of the monastery offers refreshments and a cool place to stay. Ikosifinissa Monastery is one of the oldest monasteries and centers of Orthodoxy in the Balkans. (updated May 2018)
Above the monastery, a high-altitude road leads 6 km back to  Nikissiani , past other, also worth seeing, monasteries.
40.967124.13174 Axion Esti Monastery. (Μόνη Άξιον Εστί) (updated May 2018)
40.954924.12755 Agios Dimitrios Monastery. (Μόνη Αγίου Δημητρίου) (updated May 2018)
40.959524.1376 John the Baptist Monastery. (Μόνη Αγίου Ιωάννου Προδρόμου) (updated May 2018)
Another attraction in this area is the little-known
41.024924.01957 Aggitis Canyon. near the village  Nea Mpafra . Approximately 800 m after the village direction Drama there are grain silos left hand. After the silos turn left and after about 3 km you reach a large parking lot on the edge of the canyon. The turnoff is not signposted. It is a good idea to preview the route in OpenStreetMap. From the car park, footpaths lead along the canyon and on the opposite side to the  Stalactite cave of Alistrati  '. There is also the only cafeteria in the vicinity of the pretty hot canyon. (updated May 2018)
If you follow the road in a south-westerly direction to the village of Proti after about 14 km you will reach the junction towards the
40.93524.05648 [dead link] Analipsis Monastery. (Ιερά Μονή Αναλύψεως του Κυρίου). One of the most beautiful monasteries in the area and definitely worth a visit, also or just because of the magnificent mountain scenery. In the village of Proti, which is located below the monastery, a restaurant and a cafe in the central square invite with untourist village charm. (updated May 2018)
40.945123.93579 Agia Paraskevi Monastery. Well worth seeing monastery with a small zoo and shopping for monastery products. (updated Mar 2021)
41.012823.940910 Old five-arched stone bridge of Aggista Station. Old stone bridge over the Aggitis river. Next door is a very nicely situated cafe under plane trees. (updated Mar 2021)
40.97923.962211 Angista Roman mansion. The ruins of the villa, which occupies an area of 1,100 square meters, consists of the official rooms (triclinium), the atrium, a complex of small rooms and an octagonal tower in the southwest corner. Only the foundation walls are preserved. (updated Mar 2021)
40.923140.923112 Railway bridge at Myrkinos. There are almost no traces left of the Perivolaki – Nea Zichni railway line, that was built under British supervision during World War I and revived by the Wehrmacht in World War II. After the end of the Second World War, the line was abandoned in 1947. The relatively well-preserved bridge in a beautiful location over the Aggitis river and the ruined 40.905723.831413 old station building are the only contemporary witnesses. Today they are "lost places". A little below the bridge you can swim in the river in summer.   (updated Mar 2021)
On the south side[edit]
If you want to reach the summit, follow the  southern road  around the Pangeon from Elefteropolis. From Elefteropolis towards Thessaloniki turn right in front of the petrol station in the next village (Akrovouni / Panagia) and follow the road that leads to the top of Pangeon.

40.911424.105714 Summit of Pangeon. (updated May 2018)
After about 20 minutes on curvy, narrow road you can visit the worthwhile
40.914224.221715 Monastery Ypapanti. (Ιερά Μονή Υπαπαντής) (updated May 2018)
Directly behind the monastery is a dilapidated spirit village (Akrovouni), which has a strange charm with its dilapidated houses. Because of the altitude, it is already much cooler here and you should also take a light jacket in the summer. 3 km after the monastery is the
40.918524.221616 Dasiko Horio. a log cabin restaurant with great views. In the hot summer months you can escape here, because of the altitude, the heat. In winter, it is a cozy place to drink a wine by the large open fireplace. (updated May 2018)
The drive from here to the summit of Pangeon takes about 1 hour, on a heavily damaged asphalt road. It leads through dense deciduous and coniferous forests until you finally reach the ski center above the tree line. In summer it is not managed. The view is breathtaking and well worth the strenuous trip if you've chosen a clear day. The way up to the mountain top with its antenna systems is closed for cars, with a motorcycle but on a dirt road reachable.

Also worth seeing is on the way from Eleftheropolis towards Thessaloniki is the monastery Agiou Panteleimonos and the traditional mountain villages Mousteni and Mesoropi with their stone houses and narrow streets located in a particularly beautiful landscape. There are several good restaurants in the villages as it is popular as a tourist destination in Kavala.

40.891524.189917 Agiou Panteleimonos Monastery. (Μόνη Αγίου Παντελεήμονος) Located above the village of Chrisokastro with wonderful views of the valley and beautiful gardens. (updated May 2018)

Archaeological sites[edit]
At the western end of the Pangeon, visit the archaeological site of Amphipolis and the statue of the Lion of Amphipolis

40.824123.847120 Amphipolis. The city was founded as Athenian colony 438/437 BC. because of its strategic location, near the fertile Strymon valley and the gold mines of Pangeo. The numerous findings from the excavations can be found in the Archaeological Museum of Amphipolis and in the Archaeological Museum of Kavala. As in most of the archaeological sites, former temples were overbuilt with churches, so you can see the foundations of five basilica in the small excavation area. The signs to the archaeological site are placed a bit confusing. In case of doubt ask in the museum. In the immediate vicinity are several ruins of towers from the Byzantine period. (updated May 2018)
40.824123.847121 Lion of Amphipolis. Tomb monument from the 4th century BC in honor of Admiral Laomedon, who came from the island of Lesbos, near the ancient city of Amphipolis. The body of the lion is about four meters high, together with the pedestal he measures over eight meters. (updated May 2018)
40.781323.877622 Chrysopolis. was a Byzantine port city that developed after the 10th century on the delta of the Strymonas River and became an important port. As a true Byzantine city, Chrysopolis was protected by a fortress, of which some remains are preserved. Around 1380 Chrysoupolis is taken over by the Ottoman Empire, without losing its importance as a trading centre on the way from Thessaloniki to Constantinople. In the 16th century the settlement was abandoned. (updated Nov 2018)
40.772523.95123 Castle ruin Orfani. Turkish fortress from the 18th century. to control the protection of the delta (updated Nov 2018)
40.760923.976324 Castle ruin Karyani. Some scattered remains of a Byzantine fortress (11th century) on a low hill amidst vineyards. It seems that the place has never been a settlement. It was probably just a haven for the population. (updated Nov 2018)

Do[edit]
 Hiking. There are some beautiful hiking trails, both for walks and demanding hikes. Some of the highest and most important peaks are Eye (1956 m), Dikorfo or Trikorfo (1940 m), Shepherd (1858 m) and Egg (1835 m). Of these, the Mati peak, though the highest, is of no interest to mountaineers, as the road leads to its highest point, where television and telecommunications facilities are located. The Greek Mountaineering Federation of Kavala (EOS Kavalas) organizes hikes every two weeks. The very good website of the association is unfortunately only in Greek, so that you can read them only with the help of a translation program. Inquiries via email can also be made in English. In this page you will find good descriptions of the best trails. Although the routes are described as accurately as possible, it is a good idea for those who want to climb for the first time to contact the Mountaineering Associations of Kavala for further information and advice on accommodation. (updated May 2018)
 Ski. In winter, the Pangeo often has enough snow for skiing. Unfortunately, the relative proximity to the Bulgarian ski center Bansko and the somewhat difficult road up to the top, the number of visitors to the ski lodge on the summit in winter has fallen so much that it is usually closed. (updated May 2018)
 Enduro Touring. (updated May 2018)
 Beaches. Very popular are the beaches of 40.832124.30541 Nea Peramos The village has a rather narrow, long sandy beach right on the promenade. On the peninsula, where the castle of Peramos stands, there are some smaller bays. Vrasidas  is the most famous bay with a beach bar. Especially younger people prefer the beaches of  Amolofos , 4km west of Peramos. Parking, sunbeds, umbrellas, loungers, beach showers and loud music are available free of charge if you order a drink at the bar. The crystal-clear shallow waters and fine sand provide a relaxed holiday atmosphere for those who love more action than peace. Pretty crowded in the season. Driving from Nea Peramos along the highway in the direction of Thessaloniki you will come to other very popular beaches in a particularly beautiful environment, with crystal clear water and beach bars. On Sundays in high season these beaches are very crowded. If you prefer quieter, should there during the week. The best known are: 40.802324.26942 Oasis Beach Bar, 40.797124.25563 Cuba Beach Bar, 40.793824.24714 Almyra Beach Bar, 40.75624.1685 Sarakina. Continue west, about 2 km after the entrance to 40.7363724.09141 Loutra Eleftheron (hot sources), the only 40.721424.07856 nudist beach. Even further west then extends the many miles long, well-developed tourist beach of  'Orfriniou' . (updated Oct 2019)

Drink[edit]
You should not expect a lot of nightlife in the villages, except restaurants and kafeneios. Elefteropolis offers some nightlife, but better you go to Kavala or in the high season to the beach of Orfrinio.

Sleep[edit]
Most visitors prefer accommodation by the sea in Nea Peramos, Nea Irakliza, Palio or Kavala. Something special, however, are the mountain huts:

40.924424.219871 Pangeo Forest Village. Log cabins high on Pangeon with fantastic views. (updated May 2018)
40.863624.1162 Dionisos Village Resort. stylish mountain huts above Mesoropi (updated May 2018)
Stay safe[edit]
Crime is virtually non-existent. It is possible to move without fear during the day or at night in the villages. Only wild dogs can sometimes become uncomfortable or shepherd dogs guarding their herds. When encountering herds of sheep / goats, always be careful, especially if the shepherd is not present.
When hiking in the mostly lonely mountain landscape, you should bring normal hiking equipment to clothing, footwear, etc., because it can be quite cool in the mountains, even if you sweat at the same time on the beach.
Snakes: there is a poisonous snake (horned viper) that lives mainly in the mountains, often on stony terrain or in holes in walls, between rocks and similar habitates. It is very poisonous! Therefore, one should pay attention to good footwear and clothing, if you want to go off the roads into the grounds and generally be careful with walls in abandoned houses and land.
