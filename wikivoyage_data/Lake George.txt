For other places with the same name, see Lake George (disambiguation).

Nestled in the pristine Adirondacks, Lake George is a year-round tourist destination. It is 45 minutes (36 miles) outside of Saratoga Springs and 1 hour (60 miles) north of Albany, and is worth the effort it takes to get there.  The area is pleasant for families, with many activities for all ages. 
Note that some restaurants and activities are only open during certain times of the year.


Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Downtown Lake George
The best way to enter into Lake George is by car.

From Interstate 90 in Albany, take Exit 24 to get onto I-87 North. Lake George is 50 miles (80 km) north; I-87 exit 21 or 22 take you directly to the village.
From Montréal, Autoroute 15 southbound becomes I-87, the Adirondack Northway.
Many people live in Saratoga Springs but work in Albany, creating a lot of traffic during peak hours.

By train[edit]
43.269475-73.5807461 Fort Edward Amtrak Station, 70 East St, Fort Edward, ☏ +1 800 872 7245. has scheduled passenger service between New York City and Montréal, as well as to Burlington, Vermont, with hourly bus service provided by Greater Glens Falls]Transit. It is about 18 miles (29 km) from Lake George.   (updated Dec 2022) There is also an Amtrak train station in Saratoga Springs.
Albany-Rensselaer has more extensive Amtrak service, but is 50 miles (80 km) distant.
By plane[edit]
42.749167-73.8019442 Albany International Airport.  has the closest scheduled passenger flights.
Floyd Bennett Memorial Airport in nearby Queensbury has general aviation.
By bus[edit]
43.424885-73.7138943 Lake George Greyhound Station, 35 Montcalm St, ☏ +1 800 858 8555.  has scheduled passenger bus service between Albany and Montréal.
Get around[edit]
By trolley[edit]
Greater Glens Falls Transit operates public transport between Lake George and Glens Falls. For most of the year, that consists of a single bus route heading north from Glens Falls and stopping in the middle of Lake George. But during tourist season—late June through Labor Day—GGFT operates a set of trolley routes in and around Lake George.
In season, the trolleys run daily from 7AM to 10:30PM. Separate routes go north and south from Beach Road in Lake George (near the steamboat docks); the direction for each trolley is clearly marked with a sign in the front and back windows.  The base fare for all routes is $1 with children under 5 free and half price for those above the age of 60 and those with disabilities.  There is a zone change fee, but that only applies when traveling from a southbound trolley to a northbound trolley or vice versa.  All trolleys are easily spotted due to their bright red color, but if you are unable to find one the docks are a good place to go because all routes begin there.  The run times for trolleys vary throughout the day, but generally you shouldn't have to wait more than half an hour. The schedule is on the GGFT web site.
The North route serve Hearthstone Campground, Diamond Point, and Bolton Landing. The South route serves various RV parks and motels between Glens Falls and Lake George, along with Six Flags, the outlet mall, and Glens Falls itself.

By car[edit]
All of the main attractions of Lake George are contained on Route 9. However, parking and traffic can be a nightmare, especially during the tourist season.  All parking in the village is paid parking ($1-2/hr prepaid metered) though you may be able to find some free parking on the back roads.  There is a great deal of traffic during the daytime so be prepared to stop.  Driving is probably the worst way to get around the village and you’ll burn more gas waiting in traffic than while driving.

By foot[edit]
Many of the motels in Lake George are within walking distance of the village so if you are tight on cash, walking is a viable option.

By boat[edit]
Some places have docks for visiting by boat. An incomplete list is:

Lake George Village ($2/hr prepaid meter)
Bolton Landing (free but limited space)
The Algonquin restaurant (docking assistance provided)
The Hacker-Craft showroom (very limited space)

43.421-73.7095 Lake George Steamboat Company, 57 Beach Rd (Steel Pier), ☏ +1 518 668-5777, info@lakegeorgesteamboat.com. Considered by some locals to be Lake George’s “claim to fame” is the authentic Steamboat Company, always a tourist attraction (so be ready for a crowd). Founded in 1817 as a commercial shipper, the company now has three passenger vessels for cruises up and down the lake. Each of the three boats is different, though all have some sort of food, drink, shop, and restrooms. Mohican is the oldest of the fleet (indeed, the oldest operating passenger vessel in the country), having plied Lake George's waters for over 110 years. She started life as a propeller-driven steamboat, but was later converted to diesel. Minne-Ha-Ha is one of the last steam paddlewheelers in the country, boasting a classic sternwheel; she hosts the very popular one-hour lake cruises that form the backbone of the schedule. Lac du Saint Sacrement is the newest and largest of the boats, a diesel-powered four-decker that hosts full brunch, lunch, and dinner buffets every day. Adults $17-57; ages 65+ $16-53 ; ages 4-11 $8-21; under 4 free.   
Boat owners:There are a few docks and ramps, but be sure to plan ahead for this. Not all ramps have free access and there is not always space for docking. There are beautiful islands out on the lake to visit, Diamond Island being the most popular. Many people enjoy snorkeling and searching for quartz crystals in the water surrounding the island.
Boat rentals:There are a few places to rent motor boats from down on the boardwalk. Rent a boat for a few hours, or take an all-day journey up the lake. Boat rental prices on the lake tend to be quite high.
