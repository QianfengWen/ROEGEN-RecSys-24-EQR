Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Most travellers get to Baker by car, from I-15 between Barstow and Las Vegas.  From Baker, State Route 127 heads north to Death Valley.

By plane[edit]
35.2864-116.0821 Baker Airport (FAA LID: 0O2). Small general aviation airport.   
By bus[edit]
Baker, Mojave National Preserve's only Amtrak stop, was served by Amtrak's bus service until the stop was discontinued in November 2010 due to low ridership. The bus can still be seen driving by on the freeway from the former bus stop, even though it no longer stops.

Baker Boulevard serves as the main road through town, connecting to I-15 at both ends.

See[edit]
35.26605-116.073131 The World's Tallest Thermometer. Relax, it's not a giant tube filled with mercury, but a tower displaying a digital readout. The thermometer is 134 feet (40 m) tall, one foot for each degree of the North American record temperature of 134°F (57C). Easily viewed from the highway, a stop into town is not necessary.   (updated Jun 2015)
Do[edit]
Buy[edit]
As Baker is somewhat isolated in the middle of the Mojave Desert with little else for quite a distance in any direction, this tiny town is overrun with no less than seven gas stations. Fuel up here if you think there is the least chance you might run out of gas within the next 50 miles.

35.26529-116.074441 Country Store, 72129 Baker Blvd, ☏ +1 760 733-4252. Many winning lottery tickets have been purchased at the convenience store; the town is the last major stop before the state line of Nevada on the way to Las Vegas (although there is a California Lottery Store on the California side near Primm, Nevada). They are also known for selling over 400 kinds of soda pop, many in glass bottles, as well as "retro" candy. 
35.2686-116.070612 Alien Fresh Jerky, Baker Blvd., toll-free: +1 877-254-3635, contactus@alienfreshjerky.com. M-Th - 8AM-8PM, F-Su - 8AM-9PM. The heavy advertising along the interstate makes this roadside shop hard to miss. Prices are high, but those looking for a quick beef jerky fix before heading off into the desert will find what they want. 
Eat[edit]
35.26586-116.074741 The Mad Greek Café, 72112 Baker Blvd, ☏ +1 760 733-4354. 24 hours a day. Dozens of billboards along the highway make this restaurant impossible to ignore.  Billing itself as "America's best gyros" the Mad Greek offers good (although probably not the best) gyros for about $8.  The dozens of classic statues, tacky music, and over-decorated interior create an atmosphere that is worth checking out. (updated Jun 2015)
35.26897-116.068352 Denny's, 72415 Baker Blvd, ☏ +1 760 733-4316. Just like any other Denny's restaurant, but when you've got limited options and barren desert extending to the horizon in every direction, Moons Over My Hammy suddenly seems a bit more appealing. (updated Jun 2015)
35.26554-116.075233 Los Dos Toritos, 72074 Baker Blvd., ☏ +1 760 733-4772. A nondescript Mexican restaurant that is good for those seeking cheap tacos. (updated Jun 2015)
Drink[edit]
Sleep[edit]
Based on many on-line guest reviews of all of the motels listed here, Baker should not be your first choice when picking a place to sleep.
