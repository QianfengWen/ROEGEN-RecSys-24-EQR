Dennis is in Massachusetts on Cape Cod. It includes the villages of Dennis Port, East Dennis, South Dennis, and West Dennis. Dennis bills itself as the "Cultural Center of Cape Cod", and perhaps rightly so. It boasts the Cape Cod Museum of Art, the Cape Playhouse, and some really excellent art and craft galleries.

Go next[edit]
Nearby Hyannis, one of the villages of Barnstable, boasts the largest downtown area in the mid-Cape, as well as the Cape Cod Mall, the largest mall on the Cape.  Main Street is lined with ice cream parlors, restaurants, salt water taffy shops, bars, art galleries, and lots of souvenir shops.  Although some say it has become tacky, it is still worth a visit.
A bit farther out from Dennis is Provincetown, at the tip of the Cape. Provincetown is home to a vibrant LGBT community as well as a wide array of shops, art galleries, bars, bed & breakfasts, and particularly good restaurants.  While the cobblestone streets can get a bit raucous at night, it is far and away the most vibrant town in the area and still retains the antique charm of Cape Cod.  Definitely worth a visit.
