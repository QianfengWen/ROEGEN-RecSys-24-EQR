Tenterfield is a town (population 4,066 in 2016) in the New England region of New South Wales in Australia.


Understand[edit]
Rouse Street (New England Highway), the main street of Tenterfield
The indigenous Jukembal people were the first inhabitants of the Tenterfield district. The name Tenterfield is from Tenterfield Station, a farm established in the 1840s by Sir Stuart Donaldson, who became the first Premier of New South Wales. He named his property after Tenterfield House, his family home in Scotland. Gold was discovered in the district in the 1850s. The district was planned to be a battlefield in case of a Japanese invasion during World War II, and tank traps and gun emplacements can still be seen. The New England Highway was the only all-weather road between Sydney and Brisbane until the 1950s. Tenterfield is best known for The Tenterfield Saddler, who was the grandfather of the internationally renowned entertainer Peter Allen, who was born and raised in the town.
Tenterfield is the main centre of the Tenterfield Shire Local Government Area.
