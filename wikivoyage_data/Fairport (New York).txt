Right on New York's historic Erie Canal, Fairport today is what every old canalside village aspires to be, with its historic character, modern amenities, and friendly atmosphere.
A suburb of Rochester, the village of Fairport is the business and recreational center for an area including the village, the surrounding town of Perinton and the hamlet of Egypt. 
The area has been inhabited by native Americans of the Seneca Nation since at least the 12th century. Europeans began settling as farmers here during the 18th century. The construction of the Erie Canal added modern forms of commerce in the 19th century. 
Today, this village of 5,500 people (2020) is an "outer ring" suburb of Rochester. A wide range of commercial activity is present, including farms and wineries, education, restaurants and retail shops, entertainment and recreation, small to mid-sized factories, and office facilities for traditional and high-tech products and services.


Get in[edit]
The village is about 10 miles (16 km) from downtown Rochester, at the intersection of New York State Routes 250 (Main Street) and 31F (Church Street). Even so, the true center of the village—conceptually and practically—is at the canal where Main Street crosses on an historic lift bridge.
Boaters can reach the village via the Erie Canal and moor between the Main Street and Parker Street bridges.  Find the latest information on docking procedures (especially overnight docking) at the village's website.  Boaters can check availability of docking space here on the live webcam.
The nearest major airport is the Greater Rochester International Airport (ROC IATA), about 15 miles (25 km) away.

Over the last decade or two, the summer festival scene around Rochester has grown to the point where there are multiple festivals practically every weekend from May to October, featuring arts and crafts, food, music, and anything else that can be celebrated with a festival. Fairport Canal Days usually takes place during the first weekend in June, and the Fairport Music and Food Festival takes place in late August.
The Casa Larga winery is just south of the village and is a well known player in the Finger Lakes wine industry.

Buy[edit]
There are retail centers north and south of the village, with an upscale shopping mall to the south, near Victor. The city of Rochester is the cultural and economic center of the region.

Eat[edit]
Fairport is a haven for independent restaurants. Chain restaurants can be found south of the village at Perinton Square, or you can venture farther afield, north to Penfield or south to Victor. But don't lightly bypass the many tasty options available in the village; while there's nothing really 'exotic' available, there's still a good variety.

43.1041-77.44151 Compané, 80 N Main St, ☏ +1 585 678-4013. M-Sa 5-10PM. Decidedly mixed reviews for this restaurant, but if you want Italian food in the village, it's pretty much your only choice. Some have found the service friendly and welcoming, others cold and lethargic. The food is generally good; few describe it as truly bad, and some find it outstanding. If you're in the mood for Italian and willing to take a chance, you could certainly do worse. $11-30. 
43.1048-77.44222 Fairport Village Inn, 103 N Main St, ☏ +1 585 388-0112. Tu-Sa 11:30AM-10PM (dinner menu after 5PM), Su M noon-10PM (lunch menu only). Basic, tavern-style comfort food, with a heavy emphasis on meat and potatoes. Some complain that the atmosphere is a bit provincial, but the food is solid and it's a popular gathering place for locals to watch the game. Despite the TVs, it's not really a sports bar, just a nice local hangout. The Buffalo wings are surprisingly good. $11-30. 
43.1016-77.4433 Moonlight Creamery, 36 West Ave, ☏ +1 585 223-0880. 
43.1019-77.44174 [dead link] Towpath Café, 6 N Main St (in the Box Factory). Su 8AM-5PM, M-W 8AM-10PM, Th-Sa 8AM-11PM. By turns a popular coffeeshop and a charming modern bistro, the Towpath Café is another hit-or-miss affair. Some patrons have had bad experiences with the food and the service, but that's by no means universal. And the outdoor patio sits right on the canal, so it's hard to beat the location. Open Mic every Thursday, with live music Fridays and Saturdays. Free Wi-Fi, and lots of books and games you can borrow while you're there. $11-30.
