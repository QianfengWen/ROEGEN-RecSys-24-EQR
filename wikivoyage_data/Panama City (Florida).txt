Panama City is on the Emerald Coast of Florida.


Understand[edit]
Panama City is located adjacent to Panama City Beach, which tourists often confuse with Panama City.  Panama City Beach is home to the beaches of the area and is a hugely popular destination for spring breakers and families alike.  Panama City is much different, being the more established city in Bay County, and is therefore seen as the governmental, cultural, business, and educational capital of the county.
Panama City and the western portions of the Florida Panhandle are in the Central Time Zone, one hour behind the rest of the state.
Panama City and Mexico Beach sustained severe damage due to Oct 2018's Hurricane Michael. The city and areas surrounding it were decimated, and everything was shut down for the better half of two months. Travel is not advisable until the community has had a chance to rebuild. As of November 22nd, 2019 many recreational parks/activities, restaurants, and businesses are up and operational, and the cities have started a "Re-beautification" Process. Completion of the project is expected for late 2023; however, the city is being hit by Hurricane Sally as of September 16, 2020.
