The best way to get to the Jersey Shore is to take Route 80 or Route 206 to Route 287, and then keep going south to either the New Jersey Turnpike or the Garden State Parkway.
Philadelphia can be reached that way, but some people prefer to go out to the Lehigh Valley on Route 78, or Route 22, and then to the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, (S/I 476 South). Definitely consult a good map, though.
