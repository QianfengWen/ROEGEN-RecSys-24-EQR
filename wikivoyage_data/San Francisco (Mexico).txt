San Francisco (also called San Pancho) is a seaside village in Nayarit, on the Pacific Coast of Mexico. It is a very tranquil place with no big businesses. Referred to as a "surfer beach", San Pancho is very welcoming to anyone looking for a quiet beach well away from the crowds of mega-resort areas just a short distance south.

Map of San Francisco (Mexico)
Everything in town is within easy walking distance. Walking is better than using a bike because the streets are cobblestone. Nothing is more than about a kilometer or two away.
The main street (Av. Tercer Mundo) goes from the highway to the beach. Mini-buses (colectivos) pass by on the highway and can be used to visit neighboring beach towns or to go to Puerto Vallarta.
