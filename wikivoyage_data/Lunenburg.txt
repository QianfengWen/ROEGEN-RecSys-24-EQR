Lunenburg is a small fishing town in Nova Scotia that was established in 1753. Its Old Town is on the UNESCO World Heritage List. UNESCO considers the site the best example of planned British colonial settlement in North America, as it retains its original layout and appearance of the 1800s, including local wooden vernacular architecture.


Understand[edit]
Lunenburg, a pretty village and UNESCO World Heritage Site
The Mi'kmaq lived in a territory from the present site of Lunenburg to Mahone Bay. As many as 300 inhabited the site in the warm summer months. French colonists, who became known as Acadians, settled in the area around the 1620s. 
The town was founded in 1753 as one of the first British attempts to settle Protestants in Nova Scotia. Its economy has been based on the offshore fishery, and today Lunenburg is the site of Canada's largest secondary fish-processing plant. The town flourished in the late 1800s, and much of the historic architecture dates from that period.

 Sophie McLachlan's grave, Kaulbach Street. In 1879, 14-year-old Sophie McLachlan was accused of stealing $10 from her employer, a significant amount of money at the time. Everyone, including Sophie's own mother believed her accuser. Sophie suffered from increasingly debilitating bouts of anxiety. She always maintained her innocence, and at the end managed to write a letter citing Biblical passages relating to unjust persecution and forgiveness, and stating that she did forgive her accusers. Officially, she died of "a paralyzed heart brought on by extreme agitation and peculiar circumstances" A few months later, due to public interest and the high profile nature of her death, the son of her accusing employer confessed to the theft. Her grave now lies in a pleasant cemetery next to the Lunenburg Academy. There is a marker telling her story along with a wrought iron heart being pulled in two by the chains attaching it to the short fence surrounding her plot.
