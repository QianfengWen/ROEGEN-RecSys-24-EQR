Knysna lagoon
Knysna[dead link], pearl of the scenic Garden Route, sits between George and Plettenberg Bay. Perennially green thanks to a Mediterranean Maritime climate with rain falling throughout the year, Knysna is mantled by indigenous forests extending into the Tsitsikamma National Park area. Nestled between the impressive Outeniqua Mountains and the Indian ocean, the culinary capital of oysters and other delectable seafood is a compulsory stopover on every traveller's itinerary. At the heart of Knysna is a lagoon protected from the sea by the monolithic sandstone "Heads" Webcam– best explored on board a catamaran or from along hiking paths in the Featherbed Nature Reserve. A hotspot for art and craft, as well as adventure activities such as tree canopy gliding, kloofing and abseiling, Knysna offers something to everybody.
The peculiarity of the origin of the place-name Knysna is commonly explained with a light-hearted joke of two German tourists travelling to Knysna, and upon reaching the lookout point on the eastern Knysna Head, the one says to the other: 'Nice, na?'. On a more serious note, Knysna is believed to be derived from a Khoi word for place of wood, or fern leaves, but most probable straight down or hard to reach - referring to the steep Knysna Heads.

The lagoon: about 18 km² and home to at least 200 species of fish is connected with the Indian Ocean through a turbulent channel between "The Heads", two sandstone cliffs. Tour around on one of several boats or just take a coffee at "the Heads".
Take a boat across to the  Featherbed Nature Reserve (on the Heads), ☏ +27 443 821 693. This is a 4-hour organised tour because it's a private reserve, but it's a good way to spend some time on the lagoon then take a walk in the reserve. The eco-experience tour includes the boat trip across the lagoon, a bus up to the top  of the hill for a beautiful view, with a guide's commentary, a 2.2-km easy walk through the reserve, and a very good buffet lunch before returning to the harbour. You can also choose to ride the bus back to the restaurant. With lunch: R1100 adult, R450 child (4-12); without lunch: R865 adult, R350 child (4-12). (updated Apr 2023)
The Knysna Forest: about 80,000 ha are now under conservation. The 'King Edward VII' tree (at Diepwalle forest station) is an estimated 600 years old, 39 m at height, and has a circumference of 6 m. The most famous animals are the Knysna elephants. Research involving DNA testing of dung is being done to see how many of them may still rumble in the jungle, please report any "dung" sightings! Remember to always take care. There are several hiking trails but you need a car to access the forest. Don't forget the conservation motto "Take only photographs, leave only footprints!".
Pledge Nature Reserve: offers 3½ km of pathways through scrub forest and hillside fynbos with fine views over the lagoon and is 500 m from the town centre. A nice place for a walk in the afternoon.
