Adare is a small town in County Limerick in the Shannon Region of western Ireland. It's one of the prettiest towns in the country, with a castle and a plush golf resort. Adare grew up at a point where the River Maigue can be forded, hence its name Áth Dara, "ford of the oak". In 2022 the population was 1224. 


Get in[edit]
52°33′54″N 8°47′28″WMap of Adare
Adare is 15 km southwest of Limerick city. M20 / N21 leads to Adare but there's no bypass, so the town is always congested with traffic passing through to Kerry on top of tourist traffic for the town itself. A bypass is scheduled to open in June 2027, a few weeks ahead of the Ryder Cup being staged here; the congestion will be shambolic if it doesn't open on time.
By bus: Bus Éireann 13 and 14 run from Limerick hourly, daily, taking 20 min. They continue via Rathkeale to Newcastle West, whence the 13 runs every two hours via Listowel to Tralee, while the 14 runs every two hours via Abbeyfeale and Kerry airport to Killarney.
The bus stop eastbound towards Limerick is outside the Heritage Centre, while the westbound buses to Tralee or Killarney stop outside the Post Office.

Get around[edit]
Access to the castle is by shuttle bus, everything else is best visited on foot. There's a free public car park (monitored by CCTV) behind the Heritage Centre, with an e-car charging point. Street parking is difficult and just adds to the congestion.
Taxi firms are Adare Cab (+353 86 810 0077) and Adare Taxi (+353 87 991 1675).
