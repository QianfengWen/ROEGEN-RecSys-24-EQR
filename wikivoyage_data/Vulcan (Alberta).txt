Vulcan is a town in Southern Alberta. It draws on its fictional namesake for its fame, billing itself as the "Official Star Trek Capital of Canada."


Understand[edit]
Vulcan Visitor Centre
Incorporated in December 1912, Vulcan was named after the classical god, and its major roads were named after other classical gods and goddesses. It became a major grain shipment point, but changing economics sent that business elsewhere in Alberta, until the town was little more than a service hub for the surrounding farms.
Then somebody noticed the Star Trek connection. Nowadays, Vulcan is the largest Star Trek fan tourist draw in Canada.

Get in[edit]
Vulcan is on Alberta Highway 23, approximately 120 km southeast of Calgary and 95 km northwest of Lethbridge, near that highway's junction with Highway 534.

50.331944-113.3577781 Vulcan/Kirkcaldy Aerodrome. Located at the old RCAF Station Vulcan (and has a historical marker about the old airbase). General aviation only, no commercial service.   
Get around[edit]
You probably drove into town, so getting around shouldn't be an issue.
