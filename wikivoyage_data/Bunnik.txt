"Oude Raadhuis". Former Town Hall.
Bunnik is a town of 15,000 people (2019) in the southeast of Utrecht, the Netherlands. Chief interests of Bunnik are its surrounding nature, consisting mainly of forests, farmlands and the Kromme Rijn; and the fortresses of the Hollandic Water Line: Fort bij Vechten and Fort bij Rhijnauwen.


Understand[edit]
The recorded history of the town dates back nearly 2,000 years, when the Romans constructed a fort at Fectio (now Vechten) with a harbour facing the river Rhine, which marked the border of the Roman Empire. The fort developed into a thriving trading centre, which continued to exist after the Romans abandoned the fort in the fourth century. Subsequently, the area was occupied by the Frisians and the Franks. In the 8th century the village of Bunninchem (Bunnik) was developed.
