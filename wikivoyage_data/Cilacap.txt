Every Satu Suro (the first day of the Javanese calendar) the local residents perform a ritual known as Sedekah Laut (Alms to the Sea) in order to thank God for protecting them while fishing. During this ritual, a procession leaves the office of the regent of Cilacap, heading to Teluk Penyu. At sea, water buffalo heads and other offerings are thrown into the sea by fishermen; according to local tradition, this must be completed by noon. Afterwards, cultural activities such as wayang (shadow puppet) shows, kuda lumping dances, and musical performances are held.   (updated May 2022)

From there, visitors can take a 1-kilometre (0.62 mi) trek along a dirt path through the forest; a transport is also available. Near the Karang Bolong fortress, the path splits in two. A left turn, to the north, leads to the western edge of the beach, a small stretch of land on the north of the island. Continuing straight, through the Fortress, leads to the larger stretch, on the eastern edge of the island.). A white sand beach located on Nusa Kambangan Island. The island of Nusa Kambangan was first used as a prison during the Dutch colonial period. In 1905 it was declared a restricted area and closed to the public. The island remained restricted, under the Dutch colonial and, later, the independent Indonesian government, until 1996, when the governor of Central Java and the Minister of Law signed a memorandum which opened the eastern end of the island to the public. This included many beaches, such as Karang Bolong. Its lack of visitors due to proximity with the prison makes Karang Bolong Beach to be relatively unspoiled.   (updated May 2022)
