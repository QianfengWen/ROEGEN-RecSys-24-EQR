Cobar is a town of 4,000 people (2016) in the Northwestern New South Wales whose economy is based mainly upon base metals and gold mining. The town retains much of its colonial 19th-century architecture.  The Towsers Huts, 3 km south of town but not accessible to the public, are ruins of very simple colonial dwellings from around 1870. The ancient Aboriginal rock paintings at Mount Grenfell are some of the largest and most important in Australia.  


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
The name Cobar is derived from the Aboriginal Ngiyampaa word for copper, Kuparr, Gubarr or Cuburra, meaning 'red earth' or 'burnt earth', the ochre used in making body paint for Corroborees. The name also represents an Aboriginal attempt to pronounce the word 'copper'. Some of the most significant Aboriginal rock art in NSW is found within the Cobar Shire. The indigenous Ngiyampaa/Wangaapuwan traditions of this diverse bio-region are best represented in the rock art of Mount Grenfell, 40 km west of Cobar. Over 1,300 depictions of humans and animals, as well as hand stencils are found at this site.
Pastoralist settlers began to farm the area in the mid-1850s. One of these pastoralists, rescued a party of Aboriginal trackers from near-certain death in the early 1870s; in gratitude, they guided him to Australia's largest copper deposit. This led to settlements being founded with Australia's European and Asian gold rush immigrant arrivals. The Great Cobar Copper Mining Company Limited was established in 1878. 
At its peak, Cobar had a population of 10,000. However, copper mining operations slowed in 1920, and by the 1930s the town's population had dropped to little over 1,000. In the 1980s, gold, silver, lead and zinc were discovered in the area, which led to a population increase.
