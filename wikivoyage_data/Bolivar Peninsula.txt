Port Bolivar lighthouse
Bolivar Peninsula is a narrow strip of sand, 28 mi (45 km) long, separating Galveston Bay from the Gulf of Mexico just east of Galveston, Texas. In places, the peninsula is as little as 1,000 meters in width. The peninsula is sparsely populated with three very small but not insignificant towns, Port Bolivar, Crystal Beach, and High Island. About 2,800 people (2020) live on the Bolivar Peninsula.


Understand[edit]
The Bolivar Peninsula is a fragile coastal landscape on which wise people do not settle. The point was hammered home to long-term Bolivar residents in 2008 when Hurricane Ike wiped most of the local communities off the map. Miles of flattened beach homes and RV communities were left as little more than rubble strewn across the sand. A few hardy souls have since re-built, while most migrated to safer, drier inland locations. Newcomers have snapped up empty beach properties, often building million-dollar "castles in the sand", proving that just because you're rich doesn't mean you're smart. Lightning may not strike the same place twice, but hurricanes often do. 

Get in[edit]
Bolivar Ferry
By boat[edit]
The Texas Department of Transportation operates a free ferry service between Galveston and the Bolivar Peninsula. Most people cross with their cars, though walk-on passengers are allowed. The Ferry Terminal in Galveston is at 1000 Ferry Road. Bolivar Ferry schedule The Bolivar ferry landing is the terminus of State Highway 87, which takes you from Port Bolivar across the peninsula to High Island. During winter months, you may wait up to a half hour for a ferry because only a couple ferries will be operating. During the summer vacation season, lines may be longer, but more ferries will be in service with departures as quick as cars can get unloaded and reloaded.

29.327372-94.7721271 Bolivar Ferry, 1000 Ferry Rd. 24 hours, 365 days/year except in cases of public emergency. Docks where ferry between Galveston and Port Bolivar loads and unloads. (updated Aug 2023)
By car[edit]
From Houston, head east on Interstate 10 to Winnie, take exit 828 (Texas state highway 73), then turn right on Texas state highway 124 towards High Island / Bolivar Peninsula. High Island is the easternmost point on the Bolivar Peninsula and is about 10 miles south of I-10.

Get around[edit]
Map of Bolivar Peninsula
You'll want your own car to get around the Bolivar Peninsula, either that or you're going to be stuck within a few blocks of the Port Bolivar ferry landing. Bikes could be a good way to get around, and Fort Travis is close enough to the ferry landing to make for a nice seaside ride.

See[edit]
29.36537-94.7581461 Fort Travis Park, 900 TX SH 87. Seaside park with a long history as a military post to protect the channel into Galveston Bay. First built by the Mexican Army in 1816 as earthen ramparts, the modern Fort Travis was built in 1898-1899 with concrete bunkers and two batteries (Davis and Ernst) with disappearing gun emplacements. Battery Kimble was built following World War I and had 12-inch guns with a 17-mile range. During World War II 2500 troops were stationed at the fort and another shore battery (Battery 236) was built with 6-inch guns. The troops kept watch for the constant threat of German U-boats to American oil supplies shipping out of the ports of Galveston and Houston. Today, tourists can walk around the concrete bunkers and enjoy the grassy fields overlooking the Gulf shores.

Fishing - you can do surf fishing along 28 miles of shoreline up and down the peninsula, marinas and fishing guide services are available in Port Bolivar and Crystal Beach if you'd like to charter a boat for some deep-sea offshore fishing. Consult the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department for information about licenses and regulations.
Birdwatching - The Bolivar Peninsula lies directly on the path where two of North America's major flyways converge, making it an important conservation zone and an excellent place to observe migrating bird species. Major wildlife reserves adjacent to Bolivar Peninsula are the 29.57198-94.439281  Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge immediately to the north, and the 29.57944-94.360312  McFaddin National Wildlife Refuge immediately to the east. Additionally, the Audubon Society maintains several bird sanctuaries on 29.5717-94.38943  High Island, which are popular during the spring migration season because you can see a "fall out" as the birds arrive from crossing the open Gulf and because a number of marine birds nest on High Island (including the magnificent roseate spoonbill).
Beaches - The entire peninsula is a beach and you are allowed to drive your car onto the beach (after purchasing a beach permit, available at several local convenience stores or bait shops). Popular beach access points include: - Bolivar Flats, - Bolivar Beach, - Port Bolivar, - Crystal Beach, - Ramada Beach, - Gilchrist, - Beach Coast, - High Island Beach
