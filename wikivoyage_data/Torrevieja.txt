Torre del Moro
Torrevieja (Valencian: Torrevella) is a coastal town and center of tourism in the south of Alicante province in Costa Blanca, Spain. It is situated within the district of Vega Baja and has a population of 90,000 inhabitants. Torrevieja is 41 km away from Alicante to the north, 23 km from Elche to the northwest, and 53 km from Murcia in the southeast.


Understand[edit]
The name Torrevieja literally means 'old tower'. Torrevieja as a town dates from the early 18th century when it was a fishing village built around one of the watchtowers that flanks the Costa Blanca coastline. Today it's one of the fastest growing cities in Spain due to tourism. Many Spanish and other European citizens have a holiday home in the city.

Stay safe[edit]
The Friday Market (like most crowded places) abounds with very clever pickpockets. Make sure that any valuables you have with you are absolutely unreachable by anyone but yourself. If you are unlucky, you will need to report it to the Guardia Civil and not the Policia Local. Keep a copy of the report (la denunciación), as you will need the incident number for any insurance claim or for a replacement driving licence (if that was stolen too).
The thieves often work in pairs. One will shield the other from view while the other is dipping into your bag or pocket.

Cope[edit]
There are many English-language newspapers including The Leader, RTN[dead link] (formerly Round Town News), Euro Weekly News [dead link] and the regional Costa Blanca News[dead link], all with online editions. There are also numerous magazines, several radio stations and even a TV station.

Murcia is a nice city half hours drive away.
