Canso is a community of 800 people (2011) on the Eastern Shore of Nova Scotia, on the southern shore of Chedabucto Bay. It is known for its annual festival celebrating folk musician Stan Rogers.

The southern limit of the bay is at Cape Canso, a headland approximately 3 km (1.9 mi) southeast of the community.
As the community is on the end of a peninsula jutting into the Atlantic Ocean, Canso frequently experiences fog, particularly during the warmer summer months when continental air temperatures collide with cooler ocean temperatures offshore.

History[edit]
The area was established in 1604, along with Port Royal, Nova Scotia. The British construction of a fort in the village (1720), was instrumental in contributing to Dummer's War (1722–1725). The town is of national historic importance because it was one of only two British settlements in Nova Scotia prior to the establishment of Halifax (1749). Canso played a key role in the defeat of Louisbourg. Today, the town attracts people internationally for the annual Stan Rogers Folk Festival.
Canso Harbour is protected by the Canso Islands, a small archipelago lying immediately north and east of the mainland, with Durells Island, Piscataqui Island, George Island, and Grassy Island being the largest.

Get in[edit]
Canso is the southeastern terminus of Trunk 16, an important secondary highway in Antigonish and Guysborough counties.

"Grassy Island Fort", the remains of early 18th-century British fortifications (a 1720 redoubt, 1723–24 fort, and a 1745 blockhouse) on Grassy Island, was also individually designated as a National Historic Site in 1962.
