Clinton is a city in Central Missouri.


Understand[edit]
The city is in east-central Missouri and is near the far north-eastern end of Truman Lake. It is near the mountainous Ozarks region of the United States, but still in the Plains, so the countryside around Clinton can vary from farming land to marshy areas to hilly, forested regions.

Get in[edit]
Missouri Routes 7 and 52 lead through the city. Route 7 enters the city from the east and west, and Route 52 enters it from the north and south.

Get around[edit]
Much of the city's roads are on a grid layout, so getting around the city by car should be fairly easy.
