Grants Pass is a city in Southern Oregon.
The slogan for the city is “It’s the Climate,” and nothing could fit the town better. Grants Pass has been known in the winter to receive sun, rain, and snow all on the same day! Its climate is very similar to that of nearby Medford in Jackson County.
One of Grants Pass’ greatest achievements is being one of the most caffeinated cities in Southern Oregon. It is home to the originators of Dutch Bros. and stickers adorn almost every car’s bumper or window.
