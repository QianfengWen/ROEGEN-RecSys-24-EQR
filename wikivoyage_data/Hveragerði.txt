Hveragerði is a town of 3,000 people (2020) in South Iceland. Hveragerði is uniquely located in a geothermally active area. Its name is derived from an Icelandic word for hot spring - hver. The hot springs in the middle of town are the main tourist attraction and they also provide heat for local famous greenhouses which are used mainly for flower production. If you look towards the hills bordering the northern part of the town, you will also see steam plumes drifting from various active areas.
