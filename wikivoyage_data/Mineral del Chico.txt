Get in[edit]
0°0′0″N 0°0′0″EMap of Mineral del Chico
Mineral del Chico is a small town that is off the beaten path. First-class buses will get you to Pachuca, and from there you can take a taxi. Mineral del Chico is about 25 km from Pachuca and the 20-minute taxi ride will cost about M$150.

By car[edit]
The road to Mineral del Chico is twisty, mountainous and scenic. From Pachuca, take the Carratera a la Estanzuela. You need to make a sharp left after about 10 km (there's a sign there, and a restaurant called Libo's). You'll pass a large reservoir (Presa la Estanzuela) and go through the town of Estanzuela. Watch for the signs to El Chico, that's the road you want. Mineral del Chico is on the north side of the national park, so enjoy the mountain scenery for the rest of the ride into town.

Get around[edit]
The town itself is small and compact so you can easily get around on foot. Taxis are available near the town square and are useful for getting out to some of the mines or into the El Chico National Park.
