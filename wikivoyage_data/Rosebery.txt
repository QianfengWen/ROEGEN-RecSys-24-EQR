Rosebery is a mining town in West Coast Tasmania.


Understand[edit]
Rosebery is the survivor community of the West Coast council communities, it has been an always at work mining town, where Zeehan and Queenstown have had closed down and silent times.

Get in[edit]
From the north - Burnie - the trip in until the 1960s was on the back of a train - there was no highway beneath Mount Black - the notorious road that seems to grow black ice at times least expected...  After the Pieman power scheme changed the nearby landscape, the roads and bridges were rebuilt for the new dams and lakes that resulted from the scheme - even a Lake Rosebery being the name of one of the lakes.

From the south - Zeehan and Renison - the road can be as dangerous as the road from the north in bad weather.
