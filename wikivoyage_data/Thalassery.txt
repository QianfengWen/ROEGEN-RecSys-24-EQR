Understand[edit]
Thalassery is at times referred to as the city of cricket (where Indians first played cricket), cakes and circuses.
Thalassery is considered to be the birth place of the Indian circus. Keeleri Kunhikannan, born in the city, is known as "the father of Kerala Circus". Circus artists and coaches from Thalassery are very much in demand. India's premier Circus Academy was inaugurated in Thalassery.
Older houses in Thalassery have traditional Kerala architecture, usually large houses with wide verandas and solid wooden doors. Each house invariably has coconut trees, jackfruit, and perhaps papaya, or mango trees. The many idyllic suburbs are well defined by the rivers and canals that flow past.
Since long ago Thalassery residents, like other Keralites, have gone abroad, or all over India, in search of work, and to seek their fortunes. It is quite common to find one or more persons from each household living overseas or in other states. This has led to a somewhat dependent money-order economy. It is a matter of concern for the residents on how to diversify and have a self-sustainable and independent local economy. Thalassery is also famous for its cuisine, the Thalassery biryani is famous for its distinguishing taste. The influence of Arabian culture is evident in Thalassery dishes.
