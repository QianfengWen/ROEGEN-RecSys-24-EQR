Thane (ठाणे Ṭhāṇe), formerly known as Thana, is a city in North Konkan, Maharashtra. Its biggest claim to fame is that the first railway line laid in India was from Bori Bunder to Thane station.


Understand[edit]
Thane (tthah-nneh) is known as the Elder Sister of Mumbai, as Thane district was divided and part of Thane district that is from Mulund to Sion was given to Mumbai for its future development. Also, Mumbai depends heavily on Thane for water supply from lakes. Thane for all practical purposes is a suburb of Mumbai. Today Thane city area is 147 km2 (57 sq mi) with more than 1.2 million population.
Thane was inhabited by people of the Agri and Koli communities, and their villages still exist today as "Chendani Koliwada", "Kopari Goan", and "Uthalsar". It also includes Majiwade, Balkum, Dhokali, Kolshet, Wadavli, and others. In 1825, when the British explored their newly annexed territories in Bassein, they discovered that Thane was inhabited primarily by Roman Catholics, who are both native and Portuguese, and that the latter was virtually indistinguishable from the former in skin colour and custom. The local villagers, like Kolis (fishermen), are converted into indigenous Catholics mostly from the villages of Chendani, Koliwada, and Majiwada. The Agri and Koli community people had their own cultures. Some of the upper-class East Indian families in the Khatri ward of Thane still speak Portuguese.
There are 30 lakes within and around the city, earning it the sobriquet of Lake City. Apart from being a source of water for Thane and its larger neighbour, Mumbai, the lakes are also tourist attractions. The areas surrounding the city are beautiful. The scenic locales, old forts, boat rides and resorts make Thane a great getaway from Mumbai.
This article also covers Kalwa, an important industrial hub in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. The massive industrialisation around the Belapur Road, passing through Kalwa has supposedly turned it into one of the biggest industrial and manufacturing hubs in India. Now, its parks are also on the way to development in Navi Mumbai. The important old Mumbai-Pune highway passes through Kalwa. The leading industrial product exported from this suburb is fuel filters for Ford Motor Corporation.

Climate[edit]
Thane's climate is almost the same as Mumbai's climate but slightly cooler.

History[edit]
The earliest evidence of Thane appears in the works of the Greek geographer, Ptolemy, who, in his writings (135 - 150 AD) refers to a place called Chersonesus, which, according to researches, is the area around Thane creek. The city crops up again in the Middle Ages and slabs and copper plates dating back to the period have been discovered in Thane. One of them, dug up from the foundations of Thane Fort in 1787, dated 1078 AD, is apparently a land grant from Arikesara Devaraja, sovereign of the city of Tagara, wherein he address the inhabitants of a city called Sri Sthanaka. Friar Jordanus, a great traveler, who visited the city between AD 1321 and 1324, describes it as being under a Muslim governor. He leaves a detailed sketch of early Christians in Thane and refers to the martyrdom of four Christian priests in the region, more than 200 years before the Portuguese ever set foot in India. The celebrated Ibn Batuta and Abul Feda, contemporaries of Friar Jordanus, also came here. They refer to Thane as Kukin Tana and speak of its fame as a port from which ships sailed to the gulf carrying a kind of cloth called 'Tanasi' which was produced in Thane. Duarte Barbosa, a noted traveler, described Thane by the name Tana Mayambu 25 years before the Portuguese conquest. He paints a vivid picture of the town as one of Moorish mosques and temples, with many pleasant gardens. The Portuguese came to Thane about 1530 and ruled for over 200 years till 1739. Thane was then known as Cacabe de Tana. Work on the Thane Fort began in 1730. The Marathas, who conquered Bassein and Thane in 1737 and 1739, held sway over the region till 1784, when the British captured the Fort and ruled Thane, then also called Tana. They made it the headquarters of the district administration with a district collector stationed in Thane.
The Thane Municipal Council was formed in 1863 when the city had a population of 9,000 people.

Economy[edit]
Thane is witnessing a gradual transition from being a manufacturing hub to an economy driven by services sector. The state government in general and MIDC in particular are also acting as a catalyst to boost this transition. The Wagle Estate MIDC is gradually becoming a major IT & ITES, services industry hub. The Ashar IT Park marks a key milestone towards achieving it.
Most of the global IT & ITES companies have started shifting focus and relocating to Thane on account of its cost efficiencies and highly skilled low attrition manpower. The IT parks are built using state-of-the-art technology, packed with all the ingredients comparable to any international IT park.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The nearest airport is the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (BOM IATA), Mumbai. Once you get off, you will need to take a taxi or hire a car. The distance to Thane is about 36 km (22 mi), the drive can take between 45 and 75 minutes depending on the traffic.

By taxi[edit]
Mumbai's taxis are allowed into Thane. The prepaid taxi service available at the airport is the recommended hassle-free way of getting to Thane. The fare you pay at the counter includes the toll you need to pay when you leave Mumbai.

By train[edit]
The best way to get to Thane from Mumbai using public transport is to take the local train service.
Although Andheri is the nearest railway station from the airport a better option would be to take an auto-rickshaw to Kurla or Ghatkopar station(both these stations fall on the central suburban line) and then board any suburban Northbound Local Suburban train (all local suburban trains halt at Thane) to Thane. You have the option to board a fast or a slow train. But the better option is to board Thane Local Train which ends at Thane station. Trains can be located by abbreviations for example T - Thane so any train with the T abbreviation on the Digital Train time display will end at Thane.
The auto-rikshaw ride to Kurla or Ghatkopar stations would cost a little more, about ₹60 to ₹70, compared with Andheri which will be about ₹40 to ₹50 but you would end up saving 1-1½ hour. An added benefit is that you get to board a direct train to Thane thus avoiding the change over at Dadar.
Another option if you are coming from the airport is, to take an auto-rickshaw to Andheri station which is served by the Western Railway and buy a ticket to Thane. You need to take a southbound train towards Churchgate and get off at Dadar (which is the interchange point) if possible avoid peak hour journey if you are new in Mumbai especially between 8 and 11AM or between 6 and 8PM, get on the Central Railway Line and then take a northbound train to Thane. This method is recommended only if you are adventurous at heart and are not carrying any luggage.
Thane is also well served by long-distance trains, many of which stop at Thane station en route Mumbai.

By car[edit]
Toll gate while entering Thane  via Eastern express highway.
Two main roads enter the city from Mumbai. The older one is the Lal Bahadur Shastri Marg (commonly abbreviated as LBS Marg) and  Eastern Express highway. Both of them are toll roads - the toll gate (called naaka) for the former is called Teen Hath Naka while that for the latter is called Check Naka.  The toll at both the naakas is ₹30 one way which is somewhat unfair because there is a huge difference in the condition of the two roads.
LBS marg is invariably congested, encroached upon and potholed. It goes through the heart of Mumbai's Mumbai/Central Suburbs.  The Eastern Express highway is wide, well-maintained and smooth.  It goes through an uninhabited area where development is prohibited.  Use this road to get in, even though the distance will be slightly more. The roads intersect at Marathon chowk ("Marathon square", because that's where the Thane Mayor's Marathon starts.). LBS Marg then goes right through the city, while the Eastern Express highway skirts it and turns into NH - 3 highway to Nashik and Agra.

By bus[edit]
There are very few BEST buses that go right up to Marathon Chowk (It is known as "Teen Haath naka")- 399 and 496 Ltd.  Once you get off, catch a TMT bus or auto-rickshaw. From this spot Thane railway station is hardly 10-12 min walk if you go by following Gokhale Road, & auto should not cost more than ₹10-15.
BEST bus kinglong number 700 for Borivali, from Thane railway station east, frequency every 15 minutes. early bus 6AM last bus 11:30PM
Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) also called ST bus service from Thane railway station West frequency every 15 minutes.
BRTS Buses originate from Cadbury Junction for Backbay and Nehru Planetarium
Most private buses from various parts of the country will stop in Thane. Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) buses will ply from various parts of Maharashtra to Thane.
Thane Municipal Transport (TMT) commuters helpline number 1800-22-9901 to get information about TMT buses

By auto-rickshaw[edit]
Note that auto-rickshaws from Mumbai cannot enter Thane city limits. You will have to change over to another one at the toll-gate.

Get around[edit]
Map of Thane


By car[edit]
Ram Maruti Road, Gokhale Road and LBS Marg are the important roads to criss-cross this area. The other important road is Ghodbunder Road which connects the eastern and western halves of the city and joins the Eastern Express Highway.

By bus[edit]
Thane Municipal Transport (TMT) runs a bus service through the city.
Even Brihanmumbai (BMC) has started bus service in selected parts of the city

By auto-rickshaw[edit]
The most common way to get around in Thane is to hire an auto rickshaw. Payment is by meter. The amount to pay, however, is not the amount shown by the meter, but scaled up by a factor which changes whenever there is a rate adjustment. Check the tariff card for the right fare. Ensure Tariff card is stamped & signed by RTO. It is better still to know the approximate distance to destination and negotiate the charge lumpsum beforehand since the meters are invariably tampered with, e.g. Thane to Sion is 15-18 km and fair charge would be ₹130-140 (latest rate) but the meter will show ₹180-190. Thus fixing ₹140-150 before sitting saves you a lot of headache.

By taxi[edit]
If you are on a day trip from Mumbai, one of the options is to catch a taxi in Mumbai and use it to go around Thane city. You cannot flag down taxis in the city as you won't find any, but you can certainly hire one.
