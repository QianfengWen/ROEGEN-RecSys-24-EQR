Understand[edit]
History[edit]
The city is named for Henry A. DeLand. It was founded in 1876, and incorporated in 1882. In 1883, Henry A. DeLand established DeLand Academy. Later, DeLand entrusted the academy to his friend John B. Stetson, a wealthy hat manufacturer from Philadelphia and a founding trustee. In 1889, it was renamed John B. Stetson University after its new patron. The name was later shortened to Stetson University, and in 1900 it became the first law school in Florida. The university's sports teams are called the Hatters.
DeLand grew during the 1920s Florida Land Boom.

Climate[edit]








Check the weather forecast for DeLand at NOAA.



DeLand has a warm and humid subtropical climate, and there are two major seasons each year. One of those seasons is hot and rainy, lasting from May until October (roughly coinciding with the Atlantic hurricane season). The other is a cooler season (November through March) that brings more moderate temperatures and less frequent rainfall. The area's warm and humid climate is caused primarily by its low elevation and its position relatively close to the Tropic of Cancer, and much of its weather is affected by the movement of the Gulf Stream.

The DeLand AMTRAK train station
DeLand has an Amtrak station that provides service to other destinations such as Miami, but also connects to other points as far north as New York City via the Silver Star and Silver Meteor lines. Journey times are about 23 hours from New York and five hours from Miami. Trains are comfortable and include seating and sleeper options, but delays are common.
Also, nearby Sanford is the southern terminus of the Auto Train which carries passengers and automobiles between Sanford and Lorton, Virginia, effectively serving as a car-rail link from Orlando to the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The train runs daily with no intermediate stops and takes 17½ hours one way.
Finally, while SunRail is mainly a commuter rail system in the greater Orlando area, it can be used to travel from Kissimmee to DeBary/Deltona through Orlando.

By car[edit]
Highway travel is the most common method of arriving in DeLand.  Interstate 4 (I-4) begins about 20 miles away in nearby Daytona Beach, and passes near DeLand.  U.S. Highway 92 also begins near Daytona Beach and is known in both places as "International Speedway Boulevard" because it passes in front of that raceway.  U.S. 92 meets U.S. 17 coming in from Jacksonville 90 miles to the north, and the two highways become one, and is known as "17/92" as it travels through Orlando 40 miles south, to Haines City, where they again split into two highways.  Florida Highway 44 crosses I-4 five miles east of DeLand, and crosses 17/92 in the center of historic downtown DeLand.  To further confuse travelers, 17/92 is known as Woodland Boulevard (or simply "The Boulevard," being the only boulevard in DeLand), and Florida Highway 44 is known as "New York Avenue," as the streets were known well before the advent of the U.S. and Florida Highway systems.
