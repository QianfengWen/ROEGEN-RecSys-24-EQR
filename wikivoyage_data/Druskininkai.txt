Druskininkai is a town in Dzūkija, the southern region of Lithuania, with a population of 13,170 in 2023. It's a spa town with very salty spring waters. 


Understand[edit]
Druskininkai probably takes its name from druska, meaning salt - an essential commodity for food preparation and preservation in bygone ages. The town is far from the sea, but very salty water bubbled up from a dozen natural springs. From the 18th century it was believed that mineral waters could cure all sorts of conditions, the nastier the taste the better, so the town evolved into a spa. City dwellers came from as far away as Saint Petersburg, from 1862 sped by the railway to Warsaw, and genteel accommodation and entertainments encouraged them to linger. This continued when the town passed from Russian to Polish control, with the mighty General Piłsudski spending his summers here and pushing development. Demand for mineral water outstripped the natural springs but boreholes reached down towards the salt beds. The Soviets built great clunky spa hotels to rest their weary Stakhanovites, and a modern generation of "wellness resorts" follows in their footsteps.
