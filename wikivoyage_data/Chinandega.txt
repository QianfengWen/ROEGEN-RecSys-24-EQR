The chief crops in the region are sugar cane, cotton and bananas. It is considered to be the hottest city in Nicaragua. 

History[edit]
Areal view of Chinandega.
Chinandega was one of several towns that existed in Nicaragua before the arrival of the Spaniard. The Spanish priest Francisco de Bobadilla visited Chinandega in 1528. In 1548, at the time of the first census in Nicaragua, Chinandega had 660 inhabitants. When Antonio Vázquez de Espinosa visited Chinandega in 1613, he described it as a Native American town that was a little piece of paradise, with an abundance of maiz and many different fruits.
In 1835, Chinandega was elevated from a pueblo to a villa, and in 1839, it became a city (ciudad). In 1885, Chinandega suffered a devastating earthquake that destroyed the churches and many buildings. Rebuilt, many of them were destroyed again during the civil war in 1927, when the city was set on fire after being bombed by the United States marines. 
In November 1998, the city was severely hit by hurricane Mitch. Around 50 people died, and thousands of people lost their homes. The hurricane also damaged a lot of the city infrastructure.
