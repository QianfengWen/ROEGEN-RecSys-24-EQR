Little Valley is the county seat of Cattaraugus County, New York.


Understand[edit]
Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Coming from Jamestown, Erie, and points west, get off at Exit 16 of the Southern Tier Expressway (I-86) in Randolph, then follow Route 394 eastbound for 3 miles (5 km) until its junction with Route 242 just outside of East Randolph. Turn left and follow Route 242 for another 9½ miles (15½ km) and you'll be in downtown Little Valley.
Coming from Olean, Corning/Elmira, and points east, get off at Exit 20 of the Southern Tier Expressway (I-86) in Salamanca, then follow Broad Street for half a mile (1 km) until its intersection with Center Street (Route 353). Turn left on 353 and continue northward for a little over 6 miles (about 10 km), bearing left at the merge with Route 242. Just over a mile (about 2 km) ahead is downtown Little Valley.
Coming from Buffalo and points north, take US 219 south into Ellicottville. At the corner of Washington and Jefferson Streets, continue straight on Washington via Route 242 westbound. Downtown Little Valley is a bit more than eight miles (13 km) down the road.

By plane[edit]
The nearest airport with scheduled flights is Bradford Regional Airport (BFD IATA) in Bradford, Pennsylvania, which is served with daily commuter flights from Pittsburgh via Southern Airways Express: four on weekdays, two on Saturdays, and three on Sundays. In practice, however, arriving in Little Valley by plane usually means flying into Buffalo Niagara International Airport.

Eat[edit]
42.2498-78.7976391 Hughes Hotel, 129 Main St., ☏ +1 716 938-6308. Daily 11AM-2AM. A menu of homestyle stick-to-your-ribs American pub grub — burgers, hot and cold sandwiches, a wide variety of deep-fried finger foods on the appetizer menu, specialty pizzas (these especially are what customers rave about), platters of Buffalo-style chicken wings, a few salads, and hearty country-style mains such as meatloaf and oven-roasted smoked chicken dinners — served up in the country roadhouse ambience of one of the oldest buildings in town (erected 1834). The bar has quite the range of beers on tap (mostly big-name domestics, but with a few imports and craft brews for good measure), and live music happens frequently. $10-25. (updated Jan 2018)
Groceries[edit]
42.250173-78.7964812 Cornerstone Market, 213 Main St., ☏ +1 716 938-6011. Daily 8AM-10PM. Small-town supermarket with an adequate if limited selection of groceries and a menu of hot prepared foods.

A friendly, well-kept neighborhood tavern smack-dab in the middle of the village center, The Bear Brick is the place to go if you're looking for a more easygoing, low-key experience than you'll find at some of the rowdier watering holes around these parts. At the bar you'll find decent beers and mixed drinks but slow service, and there's also a somewhat limited menu of pub grub (fish fry packs the normally empty house on Friday nights).

A picture-perfect 19th-century farmhouse brimming with charm and offering a relaxing getaway for all four seasons of the year, Bush Bed & Breakfast comprises your choice of four comfy guest rooms, each with their own decorative schemes, unique antique furnishings (many of which are for sale — ask the owners), and individual amenities: "Katherine's Simplicity" and "Sophie's Rose" each feature a queen bed and a small sitting area and share a bathroom between them, while "Stanley's Den" boasts an ensuite bath and "masculine" decor in navy blue, and top-of-the-line "Molly's Blush" upgrades to a canopy bed and also features a pullout sofa and larger sitting area. ("Thomas Station" — a fifth room, smaller and with a double bed — is only available in conjunction with one of the four other rooms.)

Check-in: between 3PM and 7PM, check-out: 11AM. This 1850s-era horse farm turned charming bed & breakfast markets itself to wintertime visitors who come to hit the slopes in nearby Ellicottville, but it's a perfect country getaway for other times of the year too (and with cheaper rates offseason to boot!) Situated on 130 acres (52.5ha) of property, you'll find the Manor House tucked away in a grove of pines and surrounded by verdant frog ponds, manicured gardens, and a network of onsite hiking and horse-riding trails. Two guest rooms each contain a king bed, sitting area, a large closet with extra pillows and blankets for those nippy winter nights, a TV with in-room DVD player, and a private bathroom with glass-doored shower stall. Additionally, the somewhat more luxuriously appointed second-floor room boasts a futon, an antique pedestal sink in the bathroom, and access to the back porch, where cool mountain breezes caress you on a summer's day and the stars come out brilliantly at night. Breakfast is a hearty country-style affair that takes place between 8AM and 9:30AM according to your preference, the sunken Japanese-style hot tub just off the dining room strikes a romantic note, and you can enjoy your own private après-ski in the first-floor common room, playing checkers or curling up with a book in front of a roaring fireplace. $105-$120/nt during ski season (Dec 21-Mar 14); $100/nt offseason; 2-night minimum.
