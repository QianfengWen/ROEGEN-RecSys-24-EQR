Sayulita's beach
Sayulita is a beach town in Nayarit, on the Pacific Coast of Mexico. Once an "off the beaten path" beach populated by surfers and backpackers, word about the town's mellow vibe, great food, and warm hospitality has gotten out and today so many visitors come to town that it's hard to imagine anyone saying it is "off the beaten path". Despite its popularity, the town is still a friendly, beautiful beach with wide sandy beaches and amazing sunsets.


Get in[edit]
Sayulita is located 23 mi (37 km) north of Puerto Vallarta on a two-lane highway (Fed Hwy 200).  You can take a bus or a taxi from the Puerto Vallarta airport.
From the Puerto Vallarta airport, use the pedestrian overpass to cross the highway and flag a green and white "Compostela" bus that says Sayulita on the front. The fare is MXN55 as of 2023. The buses run every 10 minutes from 5:15 am until 10:30 pm.

20.868503-105.4360771 Terminal de Autobuses (Bus Station), Revolucion 3B, ☏ +52 329 688 2347. Newer second-class bus terminal with frequent buses to Puerto Vallarta (every 10-15 minutes), San Pancho (every 30 minutes), Tepic, Compostela and other nearby coastal towns.

If you are staying in the main part of town, nearly everything is walkable.  You may want a rental car if you are staying more than a mile or two from the center of town.

See[edit]
Sayulita is a natural beauty. It still has plenty of virgin jungle for hiking. You will also find several different hidden beaches as you travel the dirt roads deeper into the jungle. You can rent ATVs and/or horses for jungle tours and the jungle roads are great for mountain biking.
Rent kayaks to explore the ocean or hire a panga boat to take you whale watching (November through January).
Experience the economic diversity of the Bahia de Banderas while giving back to its Mexican communities. A local nonprofit called Investours offers socially responsible microfinance tours in Sayulita and its surrounding communities.

Playa los Muertos often looks dead
20.871619-105.4464211 Cementerio de Sayulita (Sayulita Cemetery (and Beach of the Dead)). Tourists might sometimes wonder why one of the town's beaches is called Playa los Muertos. If you ask a local, they might share with you the local legend that at night the dead rise up from their graves in the Sayulita Cemetery and stroll over to the adjacent beach to enjoy the warm waters and gentle waves. Tourists can enjoy a day on Playa del Muertos, but access is via the dirt road through the cemetery. Walk it if you dare, but don't stay out on the beach past sunset, because at night the beach belongs to the dead. 
Do[edit]
Surfing: Sayulita is an excellent, tranquil place for new surfers to learn the sport. The beach is shallow and you can reach the bottom even fifty meters away from the shore. The bottom of the beginner section is sandy and mostly safe. This makes it easy to get back to the place the waves break and allows more efficient learning. The beach also has a more demanding, rockier section, but it is quite hard to get there by accident.  The waves are rather small and easy for beginners (at least in January through March).
Plenty of small sport fishing trips available if you look around.  If you can find Nacho's boat trips, he will give you a fun trip and can take you whale watching if you don't want to fish (be forewarned he'll stop to fish anyhow if he sees something interesting).
There are a couple of other beaches that are more 'local', if you're up for minor adventure scout out the other beaches around town.
You can go hiking to the north-east, west and south. OsmAnd or Mapy.cz covers the walking paths.
There are several options for yoga locally, including The Rose Room and Oka Hey Sayulita, both of which offer yoga classes twice daily (as of February 2024).
