Davidson is a small college town in North Carolina. It is known primarily for its association with Davidson College, and is a suburb of Charlotte. It has 15,106 residents (2020), of whom some 1,800 are students at the college.
Though Davidson has been swallowed by the suburban growth of Charlotte, it has made an intentional effort to retain its small-town identity.  As a result, the downtown and campus area do not have the characteristic sprawl of most American suburbs.

If you are in Charlotte and want to visit the town for a day trip, consider using the CATS Express buses that run from Uptown Charlotte to Davidson (take the 77X line). Check the bus schedule ahead of time, as Express buses do not run ordinary schedules.
