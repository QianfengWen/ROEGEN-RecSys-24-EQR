Cala Galdana (Galdana cove) is a beach resort village on the south coast of Menorca, 9 km south of Ferreries.


Understand[edit]

The Torrent d'Algendar flows into the sea immediately to the west of the bay. There is a small boat harboir in the mouth. The townscape is characterized by several high-rise hotels, villas and apartment houses that line the rocky slopes around the bay and the river mouth.

The beach, 300 m long and 40 m wide, is characterized by its fine white sand, typical of the south of the island, and its abundant vegetation. In addition, it is a very safe beach for swimming thanks to its shell shape. It has several services such as lifeguards, Red Cross and public showers, sunbeds and umbrellas rental offers, and water sports such as boats, kayaks and pedal boats. It is one of the most frequented beaches in Menorca during the summer months, both by tourists and by the island's own people.
In the vicinity of the place there are other, undeveloped bays that can be reached via hiking trails and are popular excursion destinations: in the west, Cala Macarella with Cala Macarelleta and Cala en Turqueta, in the east, Cala Mitjana and Cala Trebalúger.

39.9384353.93711 Cala Macarella & Cala Macarelleta, parking available on Camí de Macarella (can be reached from Cala Galdana or Ciutadella, but parking is a few hundred metres from the beach so prepare to walk!). Macarella is relatively easily accessible and is undoubtedly one of the best beaches on Menorca, with crystal clear blue waters, a brilliant natural cove and a small cafe/bar to keep you topped up. Macarelleta involves a small walk over the clifftop but is even better than Macarella, being quieter, smaller and less noisy. Both are worth a visit. Arrive early to get a spot - these beaches fill up fast, especially Macarella! (updated Jun 2018)
39.9324613.9150482 Cala en Turqueta (Cala Turqueta), Marjal Vella (a car park is available on Marjal Vella when approaching from Ciutadella, but is a few minutes walk to the beach). A brilliant beach with great soft sand and the same turquoise water (where it gets its name from) as Macarella and Macarelleta. Split in two by some rocks, there are often sailing boats floating in the shore. Spaces fill up fast, so arrive early. There is a small snack bar and toilets. Free. (updated Jun 2018)
