For other places with the same name, see Memphis (disambiguation).

Memphis is the second largest city in the state of Tennessee, after Nashville. The state rests in the southeastern portion of the United States.  Memphis, with a population of more than 651,000 (2019), is also the county seat for Shelby County.  The city's claims to fame include Graceland, the mansion Elvis Presley lived in during his later years.  Perhaps more importantly, Memphis is considered by many to be the home of blues music.


Understand[edit]
Although downtown Memphis has experienced quite a rebirth and renewal in the last few years, the center of the city is older; it is full of new development, teeming with change and coming into its own.  In the past few years, the city has emerged to boast one of the largest downtown populations among US cities. Citizens again have a vested interest in making downtown a safe, exciting place to visit and relax in after decades of abandonment.
Memphis is extremely hot in the summertime, and the humidity can make you feel even hotter!  Those who have trouble tolerating high heat and humidity may wish to avoid visiting in July and August.

Get in[edit]
Memphis is on the southwestern corner of Tennessee, with the Mississippi River and the state of Arkansas bordering it to the west and the state of Mississippi to the south.

Get around[edit]

Driving: Travel by car is really the only way to get around Memphis if you want to do anything other than see Downtown.
Public Transit:
The Main Street Trolley operates along Main Street within the Downtown area.
Bus service provided by the Memphis Area Transit Authority (MATA) is available across the city. Some routes are very poorly served in the evenings. At nights and weekends some buses take a different route than during the day which can be a trap for visitors.
Memphis is laid out in a more or less east/west fashion. Roads primarily go east/west and north/south. The expressway cuts directly through the city.
Downtown is on the west; it sits atop the bluffs, overlooking the mighty Mississippi River. (It is referred to as Downtown, not as West Memphis, which is a town just across the river in Arkansas.) Moving east you'll come to Midtown, a charming part of the city thought by some as the best part of Memphis.  Beyond that, you will find East Memphis, and then the suburbs of Germantown, Collierville, Cordova, and Bartlett. The area between downtown and Midtown, referred to by locals as "Crosstown," is coming to life slowly but surely. There is a movement to turn it into an artist community. Members of this movement call the area "the Edge". However, most of the "art district" is on South Main.

Elvis Week ("Death Week" to the locals) in early August, culminating in the candlelight vigil on the anniversary of Elvis' death, is a big deal, which can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your perspective. Check out the bizarre felt-pen scribblings on the fence, some hip-ironic, some of the psycho-lunatic-fan sort. If you happen to be in Memphis during Birth or Death Week – January and August, respectively – sit downtown for a few hours just to watch the Elvis fans. Not just on Halloween, but at any time of year, dress up like the King (or like Priscilla if you're a girl) and you'll instantly be a star in your own right!   (updated Jun 2020)

Graceland[edit]
Of all the places in the world one can buy Elvis souvenirs, none is better than Graceland.

Eat[edit]
Memphis is one of the cheapest places in the USA to live, and that includes going out to eat. Memphis is famous for two things: music and food. The local BBQ is well-known, and you can sample it "wet" (with spicy, tangy sauce) or "dry" (rubbed with spices before cooking), with rib tips being a well-known local specialty. Other options abound across the city, from Southern home cooking to international fare. You won't go wrong with famous names, but the adventurous will find real treasures in modest hole-in-the-wall joints that make up for their shabby appearance with fabulous flavor.

Stay safe[edit]
Violent crime has been a growing problem in Memphis. In 2021, the city had the highest homicide rate in the entire US. It is wise to stay away from areas in North and South Memphis, as these areas have very high rates of crime. Neighborhoods like Riverside, Orange Mound or Binghampton struggle with poverty, urban decay and crime. Even completely suburban areas like Frayser and Raleigh have crime-related problems. Nonetheless, safety in downtown Memphis has greatly improved in the last few years. Throughout the day, especially at night, there is usually a large police presence downtown, especially in the area around Beale Street. Use common sense when traveling in Memphis, just as you would anywhere else. Leave no valuables in plain sight in your car, and be mindful of where you are, especially at night. 

Stay healthy[edit]
Memphis has some of the best hospitals in the region.  Methodist, Baptist, and Saint Francis are the main hospitals in the city.  The Regional Medical Center at Memphis (The Med), a city owned hospital, has one of the best trauma and burn centers in the Mid-South.  There are many clinics in the area as well, many of which are operated by the hospital systems.  Some of the hospitals in the city, though, can have long lines in emergency rooms.  If you are not seriously injured, it would be best to go to one of the minor medical clinics or to drive to one of the hospitals in the suburbs of Memphis such as Methodist Germantown, Baptist East, or Saint Francis Bartlett. The Saint Jude Children's Research Hospital is world-renowned for its treatment of children's cancers.
