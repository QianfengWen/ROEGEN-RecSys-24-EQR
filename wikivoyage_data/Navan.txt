Navan is the county town of County Meath, 56 km northwest of Dublin. It's now a modern place, part of the Dublin commuter belt, with limited sights or amusements. But as the county town, it's the seat of local government and the area transport hub, so you might find yourself here on business or changing buses.


Understand[edit]
Navan in Irish is An Uaimh, "the cave". This isn't cave country so it probably refers to a prehistoric souterrain — no-one knows where, but the area has many ancient remains. In 1848 there were reports of a souterrain found during construction of the railway viaduct, but it hasn't been re-discovered and was probably obliterated by the construction.
The town retained its medieval street pattern until the shopping centre was plonked in the middle. In 2022 Navan had a population of 34,000, so it's among the dozen largest towns in Ireland. Famous people from Navan include Sir Francis Beaufort (1774-1857) who devised the Beaufort wind scale, the actor Pierce Brosnan (b 1953), and the comedian Dylan Moran (b 1971).

Get in[edit]
Market Square in Navan
Bus Éireann runs frequently from Dublin:

- 109 from Dublin Busáras via Drumshaughlin to Navan (one hour) and Kells, hourly daily 7AM-11:30PM. At night use the 109A.
- 109A from Dublin Airport via  Ashbourne, Ratoath and Dunshaughlin to Navan and Kells. It runs hourly 24 hours, and 12:30AM-5:30AM it starts from city centre.
- 109X from Dublin Busáras via Glasnevin to Navan, continuing to Kells, Carnaross,  Virginia and Cavan Town. It runs hourly, daily.
- NX from Dublin Beresford Place and other city stops to Blanchardstown and Navan, every 20-30 min daily from 5AM to 11:30PM.
Bus 107 runs four times a day from Kingscourt, taking 45 min. 
Bus 190 runs hourly, daily from Drogheda (for trains from Dublin and Belfast), Slane, Navan and Trim.
There isn't a town bus station, but the buses from Dublin stop at Market Square.
By road from Dublin follow M3 and reckon an hour. 
Navan lost its railway service in 1963 but the line remained in use for freight and the track is still there. There's clamour to re-instate trains to this large commuter town, and in 2010 the line from Dublin reopened as far as M3 Parkway near Dunboyne, 30 km south. But there's no onward public transport from there, and progress has stalled on extension to Navan.

Get around[edit]

The sights around town are within hiking distance, but you need wheels to reach Hill of Tara or Brú na Bóinne.
Three buses orbit town starting from the shopping centre: 110A to Blackcastle Estate and Clonmagadden Fort and back, 110B to the hospital and Commons Road and back, and 110C to Johnstown Wood and Bailis Downs and back. They're normally every hour or two but are all suspended in early 2021.

See[edit]
Navan town centre is modern. St Mary's Roman Catholic Church south on Fair Green is an Italianate building opened in 1839.
53.65-6.6751 Athlumney Castle is the ramshackle ruin of a 15th-century tower house, with a Tudor fortified house tacked on circa 1600.
53.67-6.6622 Donaghmore along the road to Slane has a 26.6-m Round Tower in the church graveyard.
53.674-6.6373 Dunmoe Castle on the north riverbank is a 15th-century keep, wrecked during the 1798 rebellion. There's an old chapel and graveyard nearby. Don't waste any time searching for C.J.'s Castles just north — they supply bouncy castles — but just think how different Irish history might have been.
53.674-6.6274 Ardmulchan faces Dunmoe across the river. The church is a teetering ruined tower but there are nice views from the old graveyard. Ardmulchan House is a Scottish Baronial pile, a private residence, no tours. Downstream near Broadboyne Bridge is a passage tomb from circa 3000 BC.
53.669-6.7295 Liscartan Castle along R147 the old road to Kells is another tower house, or perhaps a conjoined pair.
53.5775-6.6119446 Hill of Tara : see Trim for this prehistoric and early medieval site.
Navan Fort: sorry no, that's near Armagh. It's a prehistoric religious structure rather than a fort.

Brú Na Bóinne Archaeological Park and the site of the Battle of the Boyne lie east between Slane and Drogheda.
Drogheda is an interesting historic city in its own right.
Trim has the best medieval castle in Ireland.
Kells has remains of the abbey that for 800 years housed the Book of Kells.
Glenelg if you're collecting palindromic destinations, though of course you'd have to return to Navan for the itinerary to qualify. Maybe that's what Roger Casement was trying to achieve when he set out on the bus, and returned to Ireland by sub.
