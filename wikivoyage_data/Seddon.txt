Seddon is a town in Marlborough (New Zealand) near the mouth of the Awatere River.  Until the grape boom, Seddon's farmers struggled farming sheep on dry hills.  Now you will struggle to find a sheep in amongst the vineyards.  It is named after Richard John Seddon, who was Premier of New Zealand 1893-1906.

Take a drive out to the coast - there is vast swathes of grape vines as well as access to the wild shore with sweeping views up and down the coast.
One of the few double decker bridges in the world, the top deck with rail and the bottom with road traffic has just been taken out of commission.  Just north of Seddon on SH1. It was opened to traffic in 1902; the rail portion remains now that the new road bridge is completed.  The old roadway has been removed.

For those sick of travelling on SH1, the Acheron Road through the Molesworth Station is as remote as you can get in a two-wheel drive car. The station is the largest farm in New Zealand - a vast tract of inland farming country and a back-country link between Seddon and Hanmer Springs. The road is generally open to the public from 07:00 on the Saturday before the Labour Day holiday (the fourth Monday of October) until 7PM on Easter Monday, 7AM-7PM (but may be closed at any time due to weather, fire risk or road conditions). The turnoff is on the straight north of Seddon and is well sign-posted. No fuel or shop until Hanmer Springs in 197 km. Unlike the 4WD track that runs to the west from Rainbow, no toll is payable.
