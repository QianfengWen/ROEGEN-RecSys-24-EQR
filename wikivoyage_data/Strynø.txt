Strynø is an island in the South Funen Archipelago in southern Denmark .


Understand[edit]
Strynø  covers 5 km2, and is home to around 200 people. It is one of the most successful island societies in the country, and one of few who have managed to stale the endemic depopulation - in no small part thanks to an open and inventive but closely knit community, including many artists and craftsmen, which might be worth visiting.

Like most of the islands in the archipelago, Strynø is a picturesque combination of farms and wetlands with many birds during the summer months. But to many the real attraction is the pretty village, which is usually densely build up for a Danish island - and in fact before depopulation took hold, it used to be the 2nd most densely populated island in the whole country. The nice red brick buildings are mostly from the 18th and 19th century, and some of them feature some quite spectacular ornamentation, are built up around several village ponds and small alleys and twisting roads- it makes for a very pleasant exploration. Remember to look out for the many inventive Weather vanes on top of the buildings, it makes for good photos and a reminder of the islands maritime history.
