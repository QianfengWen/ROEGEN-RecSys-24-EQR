Lockerbie is a town in Dumfries and Galloway in southwest Scotland, with a population of 4190 in 2020. It's on the road and railway between Carlisle and Glasgow, and grew up as a "planned town" from the 18th century. But its name is forever linked to the terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 above the town on 21 December 1988. 


Understand[edit]

Pan Am Flight 103 was a regular service from Frankfurt via London Heathrow and New York JFK to Detroit. It involved a change of plane at Heathrow for the transatlantic sector, and on 21 Dec 1988 this aircraft was Clipper Maid of the Seas, a "Jumbo" Boeing 747-121. The winter night had fallen when it left on time, taking off at 6:25PM. At 7:02PM over Lockerbie it was decapitated by an explosion: the nose with the flight crew fell into a field east of town at Tundergarth, where it became the defining image of the tragedy. The rest plunged into the houses both sides of the railway track in the south part of town, and the fuel caused a huge explosion. All 243 passengers and 16 crew were killed, and 11 residents of Lockerbie.
An immense forensic investigation combed the area for evidence. This pointed to a bomb placed in an unaccompanied suitcase flown to Frankfurt from Luqa airport Malta, wrapped up in clothing purchased in Sliema. The shopkeeper identified Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, a Libyan. This man had entered Malta on a false passport and left Luqa for Tripoli at the same time as the departure to Frankfurt, so he had an opportunity to switch tags on the fatal bag. In 1991 he was indicted for 270 murders, along with Lamin Khalifah Fhimah the Libyan airlines manager at Luqa. 
There was then a great game of diplomatic and legal chess, with UN sanctions against Libya, a pariah state under its leader Muammar Gaddafi. In 1999 Gaddafi handed over the two men at a neutral venue, Camp Zeist near Utrecht in the Netherlands. Scotland claimed jurisdiction under its separate legal system, and a panel of three Scots judges convened at Camp Zeist in their Calvinist robes and cravats. Both the accused declined to testify. In 2001 al-Mehgrahi was found guilty but Fhimah was acquitted.
Appeals came and went and al-Mehgrabi spent 10 years in Scottish jails protesting his innocence. He was released in 2009 terminally ill with prostate cancer, but the Libyan climate revived him, and he survived until 2012. There have been plenty of alternative theories but it's difficult to avoid the conclusion that he did what the judges decided he did, but was acting on behalf of others who were never brought to justice.

Get in[edit]
By road[edit]
Lockerbie is along the main Carlisle - Glasgow road A74(M). Bikes and non-motorway traffic should take B7076 the old road parallel. 
North, the motorway and old road run level to Beattock village (turnoff for Moffat) then climb over Beattock summit at 1033 ft (315 m) before descending the Clyde valley to Abington (turn-off for Edinburgh), Hamilton and Glasgow. The summit can be wintry but it's very rare for the motorway to close. It's sometimes Scotland's lifeline when all other roads are blocked. 
The town is on the main London - Glasgow railway line, but most trains thunder through non-stop. From London or the Midlands change onto the hourly Transpennine trains, which run from Liverpool or from Manchester Airport and Piccadilly via Preston,  Lancaster, Oxenholme (for Lake District), Penrith and Carlisle. They continue from Lockerbie either to Motherwell and Glasgow Central, or to Edinburgh. 

By train[edit]
Change at Carlisle for the train from Newcastle via Hexham, and the slow train from Glasgow Central via Kilmarnock, Sanquhar, Dumfries, Annan and Gretna Green. 
55.1231-3.35411 Lockerbie railway station is in town centre. There's a staffed ticket office but no machines. There are toilets and a waiting room, and step-free access to both platforms.

By bus[edit]
Stagecoach West Scotland Bus 81 runs from Dumfries M-Sa every 30 min, every two hours on Sunday, taking 20 min via Torthorwald to Lockerbie High St and continuing to Broomhouses industrial estate.
Houston's Bus 382 trundles 3 or 4 times a day from Carlisle, taking 80 min via Gretna, Kirtlebridge and Ecclefechan; the train takes less than 20 min. 
Houston's Bus 380 runs every couple of hours from Moffat, taking 35 min via Beattock and Newton Wamphray. 
Inter-city buses for Glasgow and Edinburgh rush past on the motorway and don't stop here. Change at Moffat for the Glasgow - Dumfries service.

55.0996-3.36713 Hallmuir POW Chapel. Hallmuir in the Second World War housed Italian POWs, who used this hut as a chapel. From 1947 it housed Ukrainian POWs who'd fought for Germany in the Waffen SS - these were the lucky ones who missed the general deportation agreed at Yalta, to be put to death or sent to gulags in Stalin's USSR. Some 465 of them were held at Hallmuir and they embellished the hut as an Orthodox chapel, and it continued in use after they left. Most avoided returning to the USSR and became part of the Ukrainian diaspora. In 2022 the chapel is being used as a collection point for aid to Ukraine. (updated May 2022)

55.2023-3.51877 Wallace's House is a natural redoubt on the edge of Ae Forest, a promontory surrounded by deep gullies and reinforced by an earthwork rampart and dyke. It's believed William Wallace and his men were based here in 1297 as they planned to capture Lochmaben Castle (predecessor to the present ruin). But this redoubt is probably centuries older.
