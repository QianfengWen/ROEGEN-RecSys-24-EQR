Purwokerto is a sleepy town in the Central Java province of Indonesia. It is a major transport hub, connecting major cities such as Jakarta, Bandung, Semarang, Yogyakarta, Surabaya, and Cirebon.


Understand[edit]
Aerial view of Purwokerto
Purwokerto is a town of around 230,000 inhabitants (2020 census) and the capital of Banyumas Regency. It lies between Jakarta and Yogyakarta, making it a famous and bustling transit town in southwestern Central Java.
Some famous Indonesians originated from Purwokerto, such as Jenderal Gatot Subroto. These people are honoured in street names all over Indonesia.
The town is at the base of the Mount Slamet, the second highest volcano in Central Java. Purwokerto is a popular gateway to climb it, since the summit crater is about 18 km (11 mi) from the town centre. The rivers that flow down its slopes into the town provides some welcome greenery in the industrial drabness and hectic bustle.

Get around[edit]

Purwokerto is a relatively small town, so travelling around town should not be too expensive. You can jog around town in approximately 40 minutes.

By angkot[edit]
Although Purwokerto is a small town, instead of walking in the heat and high humidity, travelling around town can be faster and easier by angkot (battered minibuses - derived from the words angkutan kota, or city transport). These have fixed routes but pick up and drop off anywhere along that route; sometimes they can be very crowded, but it's a great way to meet the locals. There is a certain etiquette to be observed, though. Costs Rp2,500 per passenger, paid when you alight.

By online taxi / mototaxi[edit]
Gojek and Grab online taxis are ubiquitous in this town and highly recommended if you are in a rush to other places.

By public bus[edit]
There are 2 public bus services in operation.

TransJateng is a BRT service operated by provincial government that serves mainly Purwokerto-Purbalingga (eastbound route). Operational hour starts from 05:15 to 18:00. The bus stops at the designated, high-level platform bus shelter. Rp4,000 per person, flat rate.
Trans Banyumas[dead link] is a bus service under the supervision of Ministry of Transportation. There are three operational routes: Pasar Pon-Ajibarang (westbound route. Operational hour starts from 05:15 with last departure from terminal at 19:45), Baturraden-Notog (north-south route. Operational hour starts from 04:45 with last departure from terminal at 18:00), and Bulupitu-Kebondalem (loop route. Operational hour starts from 05:00 with last departure from terminal at 19:20). The bus stops at the bus stop sign, some of them are integrated to TransJateng bus stops. Rp3,900 per person, flat rate.
Unlike Transjakarta in Jakarta (and just like the majority of BRT creepers in many Indonesian cities), they don't have a designated lane that separates their lane from regular traffic and has very low timetable. You may want to use these bus service if you're not in a hurry and really want to enjoy this town with its AC-equipped buses. Both BRT providers have their own app with bus tracker.

By trishaw[edit]
Traditional three-wheeled pedal-powered rickshaws known as becak can be found in most parts of Purwokerto. Haggle furiously.

Drink[edit]
Like in any other Javanese highland interior towns (even though Purwokerto is relatively lower in altitude than Baturaden region), wedang is quite popular due to its warming effects and rich flavours.

Wedang Ronde is a hot ginger drink with gluten rice balls, peanuts, jelly.
Wedang Uwuh in English literally means "junk drink", due to its messy herbs appearance left unfiltered in the drink. Despite of its unfortunate name, this hot, ginger-based drink added with sappan wood, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemongrass, cardamom, and sugar/honey is very healthy and gives you warming effects. You may find this drink everywhere (especially in Baturaden region).
