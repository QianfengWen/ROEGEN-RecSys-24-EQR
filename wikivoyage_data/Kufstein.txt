The Kufstein Fortress above the river Inn
Kufstein is a city in the Austrian state of Tyrol with a population of about 20,000 inhabitants, making it the second largest city in Tyrol after its capital Innsbruck. It is flanked by the Brandenberg Alps in the northwest and the Kaiser Mountains (Kaisergebirge) in the southeast. Kufstein is located along the river Inn in the Lower Inn Valley (Inntal). Most travellers visiting the Austrian Alps pass through Kufstein either by train, bus or car as it is the first city south of the Bavarian border. Kufstein is known for its fortress, and is also associated with one of the best known German language folk songs - the Kufstein Song (das Kufsteinlied) - which rose to popularity in the 1960s.


Understand[edit]
Archaeological findings in the Tischofer Cave in Kaisertal near Kufstein denote a settlement of the area more than 30,000 years ago, the oldest traces of human habitation in Tyrol. Incorporated into the Roman Empire in 15 BC, the Inn river formed the border between the Roman provinces of Raetia and Noricum. 
The remote Kaisertal in Kufstein until recently was the last settled valley in Austria without transport connections, prior to the completion of a tunnel road in 2008. North of the town, the Inn river leaves the Northern Limestone Alps and enters the Bavarian Alpine Foreland. 
The town area comprises several small lakes, such as Pfrillsee, Längsee, and Hechtsee; Egelsee and Maistaller Lacke are protected nature reserves.
The municipal arrangement comprises the cadastral communities of Kufstein, Morsbach and Thierberg; the town itself is divided into five quarters (Zentrum, Sparchen, Weissach, Endach, and Zell).

47.5812.1691 Kufstein Fortress (Festing Kufstein), Festung 2 (Festungsbahn, funicular railway), ☏ +43 5372 66525. 9:00-17:00 daily. The main landmark of Kufstein, its 13th century fortress sits on a hill overlooking the city 507 m above sea level. In its early history it was controlled by the Bavarians, first under Bavarian Duke Ludwig and the bishop of Regensburg, from 1415 onward by Duke of Bavaria Louis VII. The strategic importance of the fortress made it a frequent battleground throughout history between Bavarian and Tyrolean armies. Ironically, Kufstein transitioned peacefully from Bavaria to Tyrol when the son of Bavarian emperor Ludwig gifted the city to his newly wedded wife Margarete, Duchess of Tyrol, in 1342. The peace didn't last long however, and in 1363 the Bavarians attacked the city and took control of the fortress from the Tyroleans. Control switched back to Tyrol after emperor Maximilian I besieged the city in 1504, and expanded the fortress with the addition of the massive round tower constructed between 1518 and 1522. The increased defensive capabilities of the fortress successfully held back the Bavarians until 1703, an occupation that lasted little over a century until the Austro-Hungarian Empire finally regained control in 1814. It then served as prison for Hungarian political prisoners. Since modern times the fortress houses the City Museum of Kufstein, and is frequently used for concerts and other cultural events.
