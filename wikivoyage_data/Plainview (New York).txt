Plainview is a hamlet in South Oyster Bay in New York.


Understand[edit]
Plainview is a small hamlet in located on Long Island in the Town of Oyster Bay, Nassau County, New York. Plainview and its neighboring town, Old Bethpage, share their school system, library, fire department, and water district.
Plainview's history dates back to 1648, when land was purchased because it was considered desirable farming land. The remaining land was purchased in 1695 in a deal called the Bethpage Purchase. When the Long Island Railroad was built, Plainview had an increase in the farming market.
After World War II, many people were trying to leave New York for a more rural area. People moving out of the city resulted in many of the farmers in Plainview to sell their land. Massive development in the area began to take place and turned Plainview into the suburban town that it is now. The population jumped in size, making Plainview change from farmland to a functioning town.
