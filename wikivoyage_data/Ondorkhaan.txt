Ondorkhaan (also spelled Öndörkhaan and Undur Khan, Mongolian: Өндөрхаан) is a city in Eastern Mongolia. It was renamed Chinggis City (Чингис) in 2013 to honor the great conqueror born in the north of the province. Government sources (including maps and buses) will generally use the new name, however Mongolians are more likely to know it by the old one, and using the old name for internet searches helps avoid the many other conflicting uses of the name "Chinggis".


Understand[edit]
Ondorkhaan is home to about 15,000 people and is the capital city of Hentii province. The area around the city has been occupied by permanent settlement since at least 1660 when a monastery was constructed where the center of the city now sits, which at one point had over 1,000 monks. However, all the monks were driven out in the 1930s and the buildings destroyed in the 1950s. Today, one of the most noticeable features of the place is the unusually large number of statues of Genghis Khan (even by Mongolian standards)
