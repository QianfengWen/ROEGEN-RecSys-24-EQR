Cavalcante is a city in Goiás. It includes part of the Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park. It is an area with some tremendous hiking trails and waterfalls. Cavalcante also surrounds the Kalunga Historical Site, where descendents of African slaves, called Kalunga, live with little contact with the modern world.


Understand[edit]
With around 10,000 inhabitants (2007), Cavalcante lies 320 km north of Brasilia, on the north side of the national park Chapada dos Veadeiros.
Cavalcante has a much more "typical rural Goiás" climate than Alto Paraíso or São Jorge , but it does have a basic tourism structure. Its economy is diversifying; tourism, mining and power generation are prominent activities, but livestock has been supporting its residents for years. In culture, the main activities are pilgrimages and revelry, the queen's hunt, dances such as lundu and sussa, in August the Festival of Instrumental Music and in December the Ethnographic Film Festival.

History[edit]
Founded in 1737 by Diogo Teles Cavalcante, it is the oldest municipality in Chapada dos Veadeiros. Its altitude ranges from 360 m to more than 1,600 m, and it is surrounded by waterfalls, canyons, mountains and paths. It includes more than 60% of the Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park area. In the middle of the last century, it was the largest wheat exporter in the country.
The gold miner Julião Cavalcante and his companions in 1736 passed through the town in search of new gold mines. The news of the discovery of an immense gold mine of great depth, on the banks of the Lava Pés stream in the Serra da Cavalhada, attracted many adventurers from the most distant corners, starting the town. Cavalcante is honored as the founder and colonizer of the town.

The Rock Bridge
A guide is highly recommended to visit the attractions listed here because most of them are in remote locations and without mobile phone network coverage. Use your discretion! Guides are available at the Tourist Information Center. ☏ +55 62 3494-1507. The guides are also available to provide camping support like helping with tents and cooking.

Santa Bárbara Waterfall
-13.539536-47.4929691 Santa Bárbara Waterfall, Engenho II settlement. One of the most beautiful waterfalls in the area. It's reached by going into the Kalunga settlement Engenho II, 25 km from the city center. From there, it's an easy 5 km trail through flat dirt terrain, hills and flower fields. You can hire guides directly at the settlement. For the best swimming and photographing experience, you should go early in the morning and stay until 15:00. 
-13.385312-47.6275772 Cachoeiras do Prata (Waterfalls of the Prata river), Estrada Cavalcante-Minaçu, km 60 (take the road to Minaçu and follow the signs. Watch out for the dirt road and the heavy trucks.). The entrance to these waterfalls is 63 km from the town center. It's actually a place where you can see 9 waterfalls. The biggest (and furthest) ones are the Rei do Prata (King of Prata) and the Urubu Rei (King Vulture), right after the former. The King is about 7 km away from the property entrance and it can be reached through a fairly easy trail. You just need time and patience to get there. If you have a 4WD car, you can drive to a bit more than 1/3 of the distance to the waterfall. You can also camp nearby the waterfalls and at the entrance. For the best experience, you should spend 2 days there: 1 day for the King and the second one to get back and enjoy the other waterfalls. R$ 5. 
Do[edit]
Most of the waterfalls will provide you a hiking experience with easy, moderate or difficult trails. Some of them can also be visited by mountain bike.

Visit the Kalunga communities - The Kalunga People are the descendents of escaped slaves from Africa who took refuge among the mountains during and after the colonial era in Brazil. They lived in isolated communities without contact with the outside world until the 1960s. They have interesting traditions that they have carried on for centuries. They are noted for their festivals and their hospitality.
