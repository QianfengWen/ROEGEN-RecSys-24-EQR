Cache Creek is a very small town of less than 1,000 people (2016) in the Thompson-Nicola region of British Columbia. It is little more than a few gas stations and restaurants at the junction of Highway 1 (east and west) and Highway 97 north to Prince George. The closest city is Kamloops, about 45 minutes east. Though not part of the region, Cache Creek is the starting point for exploring the Cariboo region of British Columbia.


Understand[edit]
Near Cache Creek.
The name is derived, apparently, from a cache or buried and hidden supply and trade goods depot used by the fur traders of either the Hudson's Bay Company or its rival the North West Company.  The first Cache Creek post office was established here in 1868.
Although still very active with traffic, Cache Creek was extremely busy for a few decades before the Trans-Canada Highway was superseded by the newer and shorter Coquihalla Highway, which bypasses the Fraser and Thompson Canyons between Hope and Kamloops via Merritt, about 97 km (60 mi) southeast.
The nearby fossil locality, the McAbee fossil beds, is noted for the wide diversity of Eocene plants and animals preserved in the shale, including the extinct plants Dillhoffia and Trochodendron drachukii.
