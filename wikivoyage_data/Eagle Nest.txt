Eagle Nest is a small town in North Central New Mexico. Sitting in the Moreno Valley on the east side of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, the town is situated on the edge of Eagle Nest Lake, on the Enchanted Circle scenic drive east of Taos.


Get in[edit]
Eagle Nest sits at the intersection of US 64 and NM 38, about an hour's drive east of Taos along a winding mountain road past the ski resort of Angel Fire. US 64 continues east through another set of mountains to the towns of Cimarron and Raton in Northeast New Mexico, while NM 38 continues northwest to the ski town of Red River, about half an hour's drive from Eagle Nest.

Eagle Nest is located between and within short driving distance of two prominent ski resort towns: Angel Fire to the south off US 64, and Red River to the northwest on NM 38. Both communities are surrounded by portions of the Carson National Forest, which offers plenty of opportunities for hiking, backpacking, mountain biking, snowmobiling, and cross-country skiing.
Taos is further west on US 64 and is the most prominent community in the region, home to a noted art colony, several museums, a lovely old town district, the iconic Taos Pueblo, more mountain scenery, and the spectacular Rio Grande Gorge.
