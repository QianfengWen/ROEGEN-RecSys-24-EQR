"At Nairn we may fix the verge of the Highlands; for here I first saw peat fires, and first heard the Erse language."
— Samuel Johnson, A Journey to the Western Isles of Scotland (1775)
James VI had earlier remarked on a visit of 1589 that Nairn High street was "sae lang that the inhabitants of the one end did not understand the language spoken at the other" - though that would simply reflect property prices. The town is in a fertile region on the road from Inverness towards Aberdeen, and grew from 1820 when a fishing harbour was constructed. By 1861 Nairn was also connected to the railway network, and became a seaside resort, and still is. It was the county town of Nairnshire, if anyone could say where that was - until 1889 there were many exclaves elsewhere, until local government boundaries were reformed. The county was in turn subsumed into Highland Region in 1975. 
Charlie Chaplin often took his summer holidays in Nairn. Willie Whitelaw, UK deputy Prime Minister 1979-88, was born in Nairn, and the actress Tilda Swinton came to live here.

Large star-pattern fortress built in the aftermath of the 1745 rebellion, to ensure no repetition (which its predecessor in Inverness had lamentably failed to achieve). It's been in continuous use since as an army base, and is therefore in good condition, but as the MoD don't expect further Jacobite attack it's expected to close in 2032. The ramparts are almost a mile long and there's a regimental museum, an arsenal of old weapons, chapel and military dog cemetery. Adult £9.50, conc £7.50, child £5.50.  (updated Aug 2022)
