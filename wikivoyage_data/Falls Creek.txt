Falls Creek is 388 km from Melbourne, approximately a 4.5 hour drive. It is reached via the Hume Freeway, Great Alpine Road and Kiewa Valley Highway to Mount Beauty, followed by a 30km drive up the Bogong High Plains Road.
Bogong High Plains Road is a hazardous road, subject to rockfall and landslides. Carrying snow chains is compulsory at all times during the nominated ski season (June-October). 2WD vehicles will be instructed to fit chains after fresh snow, 4WD vehicles far more rarely but they must still carry chains. Chains can be hired in Mount Beauty.
There is no fuel available at Falls Creek, or anywhere between Mount Beauty and Omeo, a 115km distance, so cars should leave Mount Beauty with a full tank. Diesel vehicles will require alpine diesel in winter.
Vehicles must pay to park at Falls Creek. Parking passes regularly sell out on weekends or after heavy snowfall and should be purchased at least a day in advance. If not sold out, they can also be purchased on the approach to the resort. If purchased online, they should be printed and placed on the car's dashboard.

Do[edit]
Snowsports are the main attractions, but in winter and summer there are a range of activities. Snow biking, snow tubing and tobogganing are popular, as well as snow bocce, a kid's show, a night show, and bungy trampolining.

Skiing[edit]
Falls Creek has the largest amount of skiable terrain in Victoria, at 450 ha, as well as 200 ha of advanced and expert terrain accessed by a snowcat. 
17% of resort terrain is beginner, 60% is intermediate, and 23% is rated as advanced. The resort is divided into 2 sides, the Sun Valley side and the Village Side. The Sunvalley side is colder, as it faces south, and needs less snow to open, and thus is normally the first part of the mountain to open at the beginning of the season, due to the extensive snowmaking coverage. Half of the village side consists of gentle runs, including gently sloping roads which serve as 'home trails'. The other half is covered by three lifts, and contains the resorts black terrain, including the 'Summit', 'The Maze', and the 'International' run. 
The resort rises from a base of 1500 m below the village to 1780 metres above it, with all the runs on the back side being above 1600 m, meaning that can be raining down below but nice snow on over the back. The ski school is located at Cloud Nine, at the top of a quad detachable chairlift. It has a fenced off beginners area, and is near to Australia's first covered lift, Mousetrap, a moving carpet.
There is extensive XC ski terrain and groomed trails leading away from the resort and at Windy Corner at the end of the road in a shelter, small cafe, ski hire and ski school.
