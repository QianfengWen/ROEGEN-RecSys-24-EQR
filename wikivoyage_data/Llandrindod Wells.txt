Drink[edit]
 Jules Wine Bar. Opposite the Automobile Museum you'll find this cosmopolitan watering hole. Tends to cater to middle-aged professionals though it's a safe, decent place so anyone should feel welcome. Also serves food. 
 Metropole. The town's premier hotel's bar is the most interesting of all the hotel's public bars. Offering views of the town garden and cars and people making their way around town, the bar has very posh staff, and although expensive, opportunities to meet a diverse range of tourists or people visiting a conference make this the most refreshing place to drink in Llandrindod. 
 The Log Cabin. Fairly reasonable prices at this pub. It's the most popular pub in town but can be rough and ready at peak times. 
 Llanerch Inn. A quaint old world pub behind the police station. The interior is full of character and oozes traditional charm but expect expensive prices. 
 V Club. The town's only nightclub is adjacent to the Log Cabin pub down an alley. It looks like a rickety shack from the outside but is astonishingly modern, clean and funky internally. Friday nights are lively throughout the year but only venture there on Saturday nights in the summer or expect a boring evening. Rejoice at the cheap drink prices - the cheapest in town and much more affordable than the pubs and hotel bars.
