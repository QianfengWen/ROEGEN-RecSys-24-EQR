History[edit]
Middleburg Heights is part of the historic Connecticut Western Reserve, which the State of Connecticut "reserved" for its own purposes when in 1786 Connecticut relinquished claim to some of its western lands and ceded them to the new Federal Government. The first European settlers to the area that became Middleburg Township were Jared Hickcox and his family. They came from Waterbury, Connecticut.
The Village of Middleburg Heights was established in 1928.
