Understand[edit]
Though archaeological finds show that the area was settled since the Bronze Age, there is no evidence that there was continuous settlement until the 8th century, when Saint Corbinian settled at a shrine on Weihenstephan hill in 724. Corbinian was a forerunner during the christianization of Southern Germany and first bishop of Freising. Freising quickly became an important town and religious center in Bavaria, and therefore emperor Otto III granted the settlement city rights in 996. The town's significance declined sharply, though, after Duke Henry the Lion destroyed Freisings Isar bridges and salt works in 1158 to boost his own Isar crossing in Munich, which by the time was a mere toll station. However, the prince-bishopric of Freising kept its independence and stayed the religious center of Bavaria until the beginning of the 19th century, when it was politically merged with Bavaria.
During World War II Freising was only of minor importance and as it housed a military hospital for foreign officers was therefore considered safe from attacks. The only major air raid was conducted shortly before the end of the war on 18 April 1945 targeting the cities station and a vehicle factory. On 29.04.1945 Freising surrendered to the approaching American troops (after a brief artillery bombardment), though the retreating SS managed to blow up the cities main bridge in an attempt to delay the American advance.
Freisings economical resurgence and major growth began with the planning and construction of Munich Airport, which was opened in 1992 bordering the city. Today Freising is economically healthy, with one of the highest residency growth rates and lowest unemployment rates in Germany. The cities university, which is part of the Technical University Munich, is renowned in the field of life science, agriculture, and brewing technology. The cities most well known institution is the Weihenstephan brewery, founded in 1040 and therefore is considered the worlds oldest continuously operating brewery.
