Chippenham is a market town in Wiltshire that has become a commuter town, with residents travelling to workplaces in Bath, Bristol, Swindon and even London (almost 100 miles to the east).


Understand[edit]
Chippenham is a market town in the south west of England, midway between the cities of Bath and Swindon. Its population has grown rapidly in the 21st century, and become Wiltshire's third largest town with 40,000 inhabitants.
The rapid expansion can be attributed to the development of the South West regional economy, and to the new housing estates developed in Chippenham such as the Cepen Park North and South areas to the west of the town and the earlier Pewsham estate to the east.
The town lies in the Avon Vale, the broad valley of the River Avon in the low lying claylands of north west Wiltshire. Chippenham is located at  a convenient crossing point of the River Avon, within close proximity of the nearby towns of Corsham, Calne, Melksham and Malmesbury. Higher ground lies to the east of the town at the Marlborough Downs, to the north at the Cotswolds and to the south at Salisbury Plain.

History[edit]
The origins of Chippenham are believed to be from before Roman times, with remains of settlements from this time claimed to be in the wall behind the former magistrates court in the town today.
During Saxon times it emerged as an early settlement around 600 AD. There may also have been a royal forest and hunting lodge here that was used by Alfred the Great.
The name Chippenham may have been originated from Cyppa's Hamme, perhaps a Saxon chief called Cyppa, or from the word ce-ap meaning market, and Hamme meaning enclosed by the river or an enclosed water meadow. In its early years this was an area of small family farms, perhaps concentrating on dairy farming and cheese making.
The name is also claimed to be recorded as Cippanhamm, Cepen, Cheppeham, Shippenham and Chippyngham.  The Domesday Book listed Chippenham as Cepen, with a population of 600-700 people in 1086.  The town received a charter of incorporation in May 1554 by Queen Mary.
