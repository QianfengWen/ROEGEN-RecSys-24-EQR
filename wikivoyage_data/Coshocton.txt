Coshocton is a city in Ohio. It is the county seat of Coshocton County.


Understand[edit]
Coshocton is the county seat of Coshocton County and is located approximately 124 kilometers northeast of the state capital, Columbus. It is part of the Coshocton Micropolitan Statistical Area and is situated at the confluence of the Tuscarawas River and Walhonding River, forming the Muskingum River. U.S. Route 36 and state routes 16, 83, and 621 pass through the area.
In the 1820s, the Ohio-Erie Canal was opened, and in the 1860s, railroads were connected, which contributed to its development as a transportation hub. The region is known for grape cultivation and wine production, and tourism has also thrived.
Notable attractions in the area include Historic Roscoe Village, a restored canal-era village from the 1830s, and the Coshocton County Courthouse.
