Rock carvings[edit]
The petroglyphs are located where at that time was the seashore. Nowadays, due to post-glacial rebound, the sea level is several meters lower in many parts of Scandinavia. Depicted are mainly ships, people (men are characteristic by erect penises, women by long hair), animals (oxen, horses, deer, birds, dogs, geese, snakes, and even a whale), footprints, weapons and cup marks. Some carvings can be interpreted as scenes, such as hunts, weddings, fights, dances, mournings, celebrations or ceremonials.
Many of the ancient carvings are painted red to highlight the motifs. However, it is not known exactly, whether or not the carvings were highlighted in a similar way at the time of their creation. Experimental archeologists showed, that the fresh rock carvings are lighter than the background rock and contrast sufficiently to be easily spotted and admired. This is not the case for the aged carvings. Those not highlighted by the paint or chalk can be best seen in the morning and evening sun, on a rainy day or at night with artificial illumination from the side. It is damaging for the petroglyphs to touch them or walk on them.

Examples of petroglyphs from Tanum (from left to right and top to bottom, not to scale): "Spear God" from Litsleby, "Bridal Couple" from Vitlycke, a ploughman from Aspeberget and "Sun Horse" from Fossum (not painted).
58.701511.33631 Rock carvings at Vitlycke, only 200 m from the Vitlycke museum. The largest panel contains the "Bridal Couple", one of Bohuslän’s most famous carvings.
58.6890711.324852 Rock carvings at Litsleby: the most prominent carving is a 2.3-m tall warrior known as the "Spear God".
58.6952911.338853 Rock carving area of Aspeberget: a hill virtually covered with carvings. The main pannel with beautiful and numerous carvings of bulls, warriors and ships, as well as a ploughman, is badly damaged by weathering, and therefore covered in winter. Many other carvings are not highlighted by paint, and therefore more difficult to find.
58.7240211.383894 Rock carvings at Fossum: images of people, ships, footprints and animals, as well as cupmarks. Further along the path, at Balken, there are unpainted carvings, including the "Sun Horse".
