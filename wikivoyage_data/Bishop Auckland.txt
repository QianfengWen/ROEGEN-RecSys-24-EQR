Bishop Auckland is a town in County Durham in northeast England, with a population of 23,000 in 2021. The main reason to visit is the fine castle, for eight centuries a bishop's residence.  


Understand[edit]
The medieval bishops of Durham held the status of princes so they needed palatial lodgings. They found the hunting lodge at Auckland more to their liking than their city residence, so they spent 800 years building up the castle here and knocking down whatever the previous fellow had done. They decamped back to Durham in 2012 and the castle was bought by Jonathan Ruffer (b 1951), a banker, lawyer and art collector.
What had been a small market, agricultural and weaving town burgeoned in the late 19th century with the development of the Durham coalfields, with 60 collieries active in the area. There was also quarrying, railways to transport the coal and stone, and foundries for railway engineering. These all collapsed in the late 20th century and the town is trying to relaunch itself as a tourist destination. The castle is centrepiece of that effort and the other big draw is the historical pageant "Kynren".

Vinovia stood astride Dere Street, the Roman road into Scotland, at the point it crossed the River Wear. It was probably built around 79 AD and continuously garrisoned until the Romans abandoned Britain in 410. A civilian settlement grew up around the fort and remained inhabited into early medieval times. The site is more plundered than excavated - masonry and ornaments were purloined by Binchester Hall the nearby farm manor, or used as pit props. What remains includes two bathhouses, the commander's quarters, defensive structures and a section of road. Adult £5, conc £4, child £3.   (updated Feb 2024)

Roman inscriptions and workmanship indicate masonry recycled from Vinovia. It's tall and narrow, with room to seat 65, and fell derelict after 1863 when a new parish church was completed. Ironically it was saved by falling church attendance: in 1963 the newer church was in need of major repair and had a dwindling congregation, so that was demolished and the refurbishment was of the Saxon church, which remains active Anglican.
