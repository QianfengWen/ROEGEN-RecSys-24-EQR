By plane[edit]
38.15121.4131 Patras Araxos Airport (GPA  IATA) (on the military base of Araxos, 40 km to the south). Receives only seasonal charter flights from various locations in Europe.   
For regular flights, Patras is served by Athens International Airport (ATH IATA), 250 km to the east.

By boat[edit]
Patras is linked by ferry to the Italian ports of (south to north) Brindisi, Bari, Ancona and Venice, with numerous sailings daily year-round. Service to Trieste has been discontinued.
For the ferry frοm Ancona to Patras you will, e.g., pay for a single person about €40 winter/€100 summer. Local ferry services offer daily sailings from Patras to the Ionian Islands. Corfu is served by the international ferries on their way to and from Italy.

By car[edit]
Patras, located in the northeastern corner of the Peloponnese is connected to Athens by road via Corinth on the 8a National Road (corresponding to the E65 and E94 European Routes. To the south, Patras is connected by road to Amalias, Pyrgos and Olympia and further to Kalamata. The construction of a new bridge linking Rion (on the Peloponnese) to Antirrion (on the Central Greek mainland) has been in operation since 2004 and carries the E55 European route, linking Patras with points in Central Greece and Epirus (and onward to Albania) including the port of Igoumenitsa.

By train[edit]
A new railway Athens Airport - Patras line is under construction and operational until Aigio. From Athens you can take the suburban railway to Kiato and change there for the rail replacement bus to Patras. The trip is comfortable and fast, with the advantage that you don't need to go to the Intercity Bus Station in Athens which is located far from the city center and is not connected with the metro network.

By bus[edit]
Near to the port and main train station at the corner of Zaimi Str. and Othonos Amalias Str. lies the 38.251121.73672 intercity bus station known as KTEL. KTEL buses connect Athens and other towns in Achaea with Patras.

Get around[edit]
The moovit app has accurate information and itineraries regarding urban (and some suburban) transport in Patras.

By bus[edit]
There is a city bus service in Patras consisting of 10 different lines connecting most of the city and also offering connections to places outside of Patras such as the Rio Hospital, the University of Patras, the Rio Docks (useful as many intercity buses from Athens stop there) and several villages. Tickets are available at many shops and kiosks throughout the city. There are also ticket offices of the bus company in the city center and at various other points such as the hospital and the university. Tickets for trips inside the city (Zone A) cost 1.20€, with trips outside the city costing 1.60€. Tickets purchased inside the bus cost 2.00€ and payment can be made by both cash and card. Most lines offer good service and you will most times find a seat. Lines 2 and 6 serving the two universities can get very crowded at times where classes are taking place. Generally prefer the Ktel or train wherever services are available and not the city bus because they are slow and expensive.

Line map of the suburban railway
By rail[edit]
There is a suburban railway service connecting various places in the wider Patras region, with the 32.9km long line stretching from Agios Vasileios to Kato Achaia. It operates on the metric-gauge tracks of the now closed (since 2011) Peloponnese Railway which had been operating since the late 1800s. There is a train every one hour, with timetables available on the Hellenic Train website. The Agios Vasileios and Aktaion stations are served by bus, changing at Kastellokampos and the route Kaminia-Kato Achaia is served by bus, changing at Kaminia. There is also a bus shuttle that connects the railway to the University of Patras and the Rio Hospital at Kastellokampos station. There is almost no wait for these shuttle buses as itineraries are made so that the arrival of the train and bus coincide. Trains have air conditioning and offer a much more comfortable and faster trip than buses. Ticket prices range from 1.40-3.00€ depending on the number of zones you cross. Tickets can be purchased at the Kato Achaia, Agios Andreas, Patra and Rio stations as well as some other shops near the train stops.

By taxi[edit]

It crosses the Gulf of Corinth near Patras, linking the town of Rion on the Peloponnese to Antirion on mainland Greece. You can walk across it for free. On the Patras side, there are the most popular strip of clubs and cafes along the water to visit. On the Antirio side, right next to the bridge are historical ruins that you can tour.

38.26336421.7523532 Archaeological Museum, National Road Patras Athens & America, ☏ +30 2610 220 829. The museum, which opened in 2009, has startling architecture, including an entrance made of silver-hued titanium that is shaped like a flying saucer on steroids (or an enormous antacid tablet). In yet another attempt to lure the unwilling into museums, this one has what is described as an "aerial corridor," which will whisk visitors above the exhibits, as they give passing glances at whatever catches their fancy. If you go through the museum room by room, you'll see themed exhibits on private and public life from antiquity through the Byzantine epoch. Entire period houses have been reconstructed and a necropolis is on view. (updated Mar 2016)
38.24333821.7381443 Roman Odeon. The Roman Odeon is on the west side of Patras. It was built before the Odeon of Athens and there was a statue of Apollo inside it. The Odeon of Patras was severely destroyed by successive invasions, wars and earthquakes. It was almost buried under the remains of other buildings and ground. It was in 1889, when the Odeon was found by accident while some workers were digging up the ground for the construction of the port. The restoration of the Odeon continued until 1956, when it regained its original shape. Along with the restoration process of the Odeon, the nearby areas were declared as archaeological sites. The Roman Odeon today functions as the chief venue for the Patras International Festival, held every summer. The Odeon has a capacity to hold 2,300 people, with all basic facilities of a theatre such as hollow, orchestra, proscenium, scene and wings. (updated Mar 2016)
38.196721.7724 Achaia Clauss wine factory, Petrotou, ☏ +30 261 052 7089. On a green-clad hill, eight km southeast of Patras' centre, are located the facilities of Achaia Clauss winery, distinguished as one of the topmost tourist sites of the region. Its founder, Bavarian Gustav Clauss, arrived in Patras in 1854 to work in a German company dealing with exportation of raisin. During an excursion, he visited this region that charmed him with its natural beauty. He bought a small vineyard just to produce some wine for self-consumption and he ended up to the establishment of this Castle-Winery that survives intact till now. In 1861 he founded Achaia Clauss Co and the excellent quality wines, including Mavrodaphne of Patras, conquered both Greek and international market. The stone-made buildings, the large oak carved barrels with one century-old Mavrodaphne, the traditional cellar where visitors are welcomed as well as the unique landscape with the breathtaking view attract approximately 200,000 visitors per year.

38.24238721.72785 St. Andrew's Church. Inside this church, which was built in the 20th century, are preserved the remains of St. Andrew the Apostle. They are in a small chapel to the back right of the church as you face the front. The remains of his X-shaped cross are kept behind it. Although the present (substantial, but undistinguished) church was built after World War II, the mosaics give a vivid picture of old Patras. It's important to dress appropriately to visit the cathedral, a major pilgrimage shrine thanks to the presence of St. Andrew's skull in an ornate gold reliquary to the right of the altar. Visitors will find several pleasant cafes in the shaded park across from the cathedral. (updated Mar 2016)
38.24527721.7430146 Patras Castle (Greek: Kastro). which offers a good view of the city. The castle of Patras was built in the second half of the 6th century AD on the ruins of the ancient Acropolis. In AD 805 the inhabitants of the city were besieged in the castle by the Slavs and Saracens and their victory, considered a miracle of the city's patron Saint Andrew, was important for repelling the barbarian invasions in Peloponnese. In the following centuries the castle, which remained continuously in use until the Second World War for the defense of the city, as well as an administrative and military centre, was captured by the Franks, Venetians, Palaiologoi and Turks. The castle consists of a triangular outer enclosure reinforced with towers and bastions, which was originally protected by a deep moat and an inner enclosure rising on the NE angle and protected by a moat as well. The building phases distinguishable today on the castle provide evidence for the works carried out by each of its conquerors as repairs and provisions according to the development of military science. The original construction is visible today mainly along the north wall, but remains of it exist on all three sides of the curtain indicating that the original medieval fortification had more or less the same perimeter. To reach the castle one can either travel up the vast staircase or take the short drive to the top. Once reaching the historic site, visitors have the ability to sit and enjoy the view over refreshments.   (updated Mar 2016)

Do[edit]
The wide array of special events, exhibits, festivals, and various ongoing presentations, continue to delight large numbers of travelers annually, all of which have been designed to show the city of Patras at its best. For those who have never experienced the city, it is one of the best examples of a true Greek city. In addition to its tourist industry, Patras relies heavily on agriculture, its prolific wine country, and its busy shipping industry. However, it is also renowned for its colorful Carnival Season and how it has preserved the performances of ancient Greek theatre, held every year in February–March.  Being the city's flagship during the last 170 years, it is without any doubt the greatest local celebration and has long been widely acknowledged in Greece and abroad.
Rooting in ancient Greece, Patras' carnival (as every other Greek carnival) is connected to the worship of Dionysus, god of wine and celebration.  The carnival events, starting on 17 January every year and lasting until Ash Monday, are either programmed by the Municipal Committee of Carnival Events, or planned by the citizens and supported by the spontaneity, the inspiration and the creative ability of the inhabitants of Patras themselves.  Patras' carnival draws its invigorating energy from the great numbers of participants (more than 30,000), which makes it the most famous in Greece.
Additionally, Patras hosts the Panachaiki soccer team which hosts games at the Pampeloponnisiako Stadium, so natives as well as visitors can stop by and catch a game. If you're interested in going for a stroll along the water, one can venture over to the Molos port walk where there are benches to sit and enjoy the scenery and a cafe at the end of the port where you can sit and wait for your boat enjoying the water.

Buy[edit]
The city of Patras has a lot of vintage shops, most in the town hall. They are a litle bit more on the "expensive but good quality" side. You can find all the brands; Patras' biggest mall is Notos Galleries.

Eat[edit]
 Tula Pot (Κατσαρόλα της Τούλας), Riga Fereou 49, ☏ +30 26 1027 1555. A good place to fill up on local homemade cuisine, with big portions. (updated Aug 2021)
Drink[edit]
Patras is well known for the wines produced by the Achaia Clauss wine factory and especially for a variety called Mavrodafni. Visitors should also taste the local liqueur called Tentoura which is usually served as a digestive.
Some of the best places to get a drink, especially in the warm summer months is on the beach road in Rio.  This strip of land is lined with bars and cafeterias catering to mostly Greeks.  The clubs can get pretty packed, and usually European style music is played rather than Greek.  Enjoy the views of the ocean and the Rio-Antirrio Bridge which is magnificently lit up on the weekends.
The city can provide a big variety of coffee shops, especially in Agiou Nikolaou Str. (Saint Nikolaos Str.), Radinou Str., Marine (area called "Pelekaneika" in Iroon Politechniou Str.), Plateia Vasileiou Georgiou (King Georgios Square), Gerokostopoulou Str., Ipsila Alonia Square (Plateia Ypsilon Alonion), "Veso Mare" in Akti Dimeon Blvd, Koukouli area near Technological Institute of Patras etc.
