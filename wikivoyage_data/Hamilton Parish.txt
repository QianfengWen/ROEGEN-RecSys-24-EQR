Hamilton Parish is on the island of Bermuda.


Understand[edit]

At the middle northeastern section of the island chain, the parish is split in two by the large Harrington Sound, occupying all but the south and northeastern ends of its coast.

Baileys Bay is a district known for its caves.
Flatts Village is a small area with an aquarium, restaurants and a few shops, built around Harrington Sound's connective inlet to the Atlantic Ocean.  The narrow inlet forces the tidal waters to flow at a surprisingly quick rate.  It's not a place to spend all day, but worth a visit if you're touring Bermuda for a few days.
Get in[edit]
By taxi[edit]
Bailey's Bay is less than five minutes taxi ride from Bermuda's airport ($10), or about twenty minutes ($20-$25) from downtown Hamilton. 

By car[edit]
From Hamilton, take Middle Road or North Shore Road east for about 15 minutes.

By bus[edit]
Busses #1, #3, #10 and #11 pass through Flatts Village on their way between Hamilton and St. George's. If coming from the airport, take direction "Hamilton".  If coming from Hamilton, take direction "St. George's".

Get around[edit]
Map of Hamilton Parish
The district of Baileys Bay is less than a mile long.  If you are fit enough to walk five city blocks, then you can walk.  There are usually taxis going back and forth from the airport that can take you a short distance if you need it.
Flatts Village is small enough to walk around on foot.  Public parking is available across the street from the aquarium.  Roads are very narrow and not all have sidewalks -- keep close to the curb and walk single file.

32.349836-64.7139541 Crystal and Fantasy Caves, Wilkinson Avenue, Bailey's Bay, ☏ +1 441 293-0640. Daily 9:30AM-4:30PM (last admission 4:00). Two caves, almost adjacent but different from each other. Crystal cave has cool water formations and a floating bridge. It shows a good bit of human damage and decent amount of sunglasses and cellphones that have made their way to the bottom. Fantasy has more impressive rock formations, a larger area to explore, is a newer business so it doesn't show as many signs of abuse as Crystal, and its walls have a little more color and variations.
