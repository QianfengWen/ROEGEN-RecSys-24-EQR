Springhill is a town of 2,700 people (2016) in Nova Scotia. It had a large coal mining operation and is the birthplace of Canadian singer and songwriter, Anne Murray.


Understand[edit]
Main Street, Springhill
The community was founded as "Springhill Mines." Coal mining lead to economic growth, with its incorporation as a town in 1889. The mines in the Springhill coalfield were established in the 1870s. All coal mining had ceased in the area by the early 1970s. The community is famous for the Springhill Mining Disaster and being the childhood home of international recording star Anne Murray, who is honoured by the Anne Murray Centre, a popular tourist attraction.
There were three mining disasters in 1891, 1956, and 1958 in different mines within the Springhill coalfield. The third and final disaster in 1958 accelerated the closure of the largest mines when what was known as a "bump" occurred. The underground upheaval can be described as a bump due to a seismic jolt stemming from the collapse of one or more support pillars within a mine.
In 2015 the mine properties, among the deepest in the world were filled with water and provide Springhill's industrial park with geothermal heating. Geothermal energy from the waters of the abandoned mines are capable of providing heating and cooling for large buildings through the use of heat pumps. Because the water in a mine circulates by convection, shallow wells produce water of a temperature significantly higher than groundwater of the same depth.
