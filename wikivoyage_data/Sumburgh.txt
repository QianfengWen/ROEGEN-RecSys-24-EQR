59.86-1.314 Ness of Burgi is the peninsula west of Sumburgh, with a stout fort from 100 BC. This was not designed for defence and may have been built to impress, an early "bling-castle". It's free to enter, follow the grassy path from Scatness. The peninsula ends in rocks ("Hog of Ness") with Horse Island half a mile further south.
Lady's Holm and Little Holm are the islets west of the Ness, with a teensy-weensy Holm closer inshore.

The Lost Town of Broo obviously can't be shown on the map, but it's somewhere around Quendale, buried by sand in the 1700s. Work continues to map its extent, and to understand why it was so rapidly engulfed, so you may see archaeologists busily burrowing.
Fitful Head is the line of cliffs reached by the track west of Quendale.

59.972-1.3488 St Ninian's is a "tied island", uninhabited since 1796. In summer a 500-m sand tombolo connects it to Mainland, in winter storms wash this away so (depending on their ferocity) it becomes a true or at least a tidal island. There's the ruins of a 12th-century chapel; in 1958 a hoard of 8th-century silverware was discovered within. These are now in the National Museum in Edinburgh, with replicas in the Shetland Museum in Lerwick.
60-1.1759 Mousa is an uninhabited island on the east coast ten miles north of Sumburgh, with a broch — an Iron Age tower, the best preserved in Britain. You clamber in along a passage through the thick stone wall. In summer a boat runs to Mousa from Leebitton, near Sandwick off the main road to Lerwick.
