Waterloo, Ontario, is one of three neighbouring cities, together with Kitchener, and Cambridge, forming a tightly-integrated metro area within the larger Region of Waterloo in Southwestern Ontario. Waterloo (population 121,000 in 2022) is known internationally for its two universities: Wilfrid Laurier University and the University of Waterloo.

Many companies such as PTC, Sandvine Inc, BlackBerry (formerly Research In Motion (RIM)), Maplesoft, Open Text, Google and Sybase are either based or have branch offices in Waterloo.  Technology companies thrive due to the convenience of the University of Waterloo, which boasts the largest math and computer science undergraduate program in the world. The university is also very famous for its psychology program. Waterloo pioneered the concept of university co-op where students alternate terms of study with terms of paid work experience. Today it boasts the largest co-op undergraduate enrolment in the world.
Waterloo was once known as the "Hartford of Canada" due to the large number of insurance companies that once had their headquarters here.  Insurance is still a major industry in Waterloo due to the presence of Manulife Financial and Sun Life Financial.

Uptown Waterloo
Farmland is quite close outside the city limits, and many Mennonites live close by. St. Jacobs is a small  village immediately to the north of the city, with markets and stores that have come to be very popular.
The city of Kitchener is immediately to the south of Waterloo.  These two cities, often referred together as "Kitchener-Waterloo" (abbreviated to "K-W"), are separate municipalities, but share a long, seamless border.  If visiting Waterloo, take Kitchener's attractions into consideration as well.  Waterloo's central business district is referred to as "Uptown", in contrast to Kitchener's, which is referred to as "Downtown".  Note, however, that Uptown Waterloo is not particularly large compared to neighbouring cities' downtowns; Waterloo is essentially a suburban city.  The distributed nature of the city does mean that Uptown Waterloo has maintained a small-town atmosphere (for now; plans to intensify the Uptown are afoot).

History[edit]
Waterloo began on land that was part of a parcel of 675,000 acres (2,730 km²) assigned in 1784 to the Iroquois alliance that made up the League of Six Nations. The rare gift of land from Britain to indigenous people took place to compensate for wartime alliance during the American Revolution. Almost immediately—and with much controversy—the First Nations groups began to sell some of the land. Between 1796 and 1798, 93,000 acres (380 km²) were sold to Richard Beasley, with the Six Nations Indians continuing to hold the mortgage on the lands.
The first wave of immigrants to the area comprised Mennonites from Pennsylvania. They bought the land from Beasley and began moving into the area in 1804.  Abraham Erb, often called the founder of Waterloo, had come to the area in 1806 from Franklin County, Pennsylvania. He bought 900 acres of bush land in 1806 from the German Company and founded a sawmill (1808) and grist mill (1816); these the focal point of the area. The grist mill operated continuously for 111 years.
In 1816 the new township was named after Waterloo, Belgium, the site of the Battle of Waterloo (1815), which had ended the Napoleonic Wars in Europe. After that war, the new township became a popular destination for German immigrants. By the 1840s, German settlers had overtaken the Mennonites as the dominant segment of the population. Many Germans settled in the small hamlet to the southeast of Waterloo. In their honour, the village was named Berlin in 1833 (renamed Kitchener in 1916).

Get around[edit]
Map of Waterloo (Ontario)


Street layout[edit]
Unlike a metropolis such as Toronto, it is relatively quick and easy to get from one point to another by car because the distances aren't far, and the traffic isn't too busy.  Looking at a map of Kitchener-Waterloo, one of the first things visitors from other parts of Ontario will notice is that, far from forming a grid pattern, the streets are not straight, curving and wiggling in surprising patterns.  For example, there are two streets, King and Weber, which are parallel for most of their length, but cross each other 3 times in K-W.  The irregular road pattern dates to the earliest settlement in K-W; unlike most Ontario townships, whose roads were laid out in a grid pattern, Waterloo Township was laid out without road allowances, allowing settlers to build roads where they were needed.
King Street is the main street that travels roughly North-South through the downtown of Kitchener and Waterloo.  In Waterloo, it is labelled King St. North and South, with the transition at Erb Street (in Kitchener, it is labelled King St. East and West).
