São José dos Campos.
São José dos Campos is a city and a municipality in the Brazilian state of São Paulo. The city is the birthplace of Brazilian aerospace industry, and until nowadays the most important center of aerospace manufacturing and research in the country.


Districts[edit]
The main district is the actual city of São José dos Campos. It contains most of the population and economy of the municipality, as well as almost all non-natural attractions;
Eugênio de Melo is an industrial/suburban district that is home to the city's technological park. It has no significant touristic attractions, but it is a very important business destination;
São Francisco Xavier is an environmental protection area, an area covered by Atlantic rainforest. It is a popular ecotourism destination due to its waterfalls and mountain ranges.
Understand[edit]
São José dos Campos, often abbreviated simply as "São José", is the largest and most important city of the industrial region known as Vale do Paraíba. The city is the home of Embraer, the third largest aircraft manufacturer of the world, and of important aerospace research centers including the Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica (ITA) and the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE).
As of the latest (2021) the Brazilian census estimates the São José population at 737,310 people, the 7th largest city in the state. 
For obvious reasons, most visitors to the city come for business rather than for tourism. Yet, São José dos Campos is a lively city, with many options of culture, nightlife and gastronomy, plus exuberant nature in the district of São Francisco Xavier. Its convenient location also provides easy access to São Paulo and the wonderful beaches of the North Coast of the state.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
São José dos Campos is attended by the International Airport Professor Urbano Ernesto Stumpf [formerly dead link] . Despite being an international airport, it operates only domestic commercial flights, connecting the city to Campinas, Belo Horizonte, Curitiba and Rio de Janeiro. The airport is very close to the main aerospace and research centers (Embraer, CTA, Mectron, INPE) which may be convenient for business visitors.
For other destinations (including international destinations), the closest airport is the Guarulhos airport in São Paulo, about 1 hour by car from São José dos Campos, although Congonhas (São Paulo) and Viracopos (Campinas) are alternatives.

By bus[edit]
By car[edit]
BR-116 (Via Dutra) - The highway which links São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro cuts through the center of town.
SP-050 (Monteiro Lobato) comes in from the area of Campos do Jordão and Santo Antônio do Pinhal
SP-65 (Dom Pedro I) from the Campinas region intersects both BR-116 and SP-70 in neighboring Jacareí
SP-66 (Geraldo Scavone) is yet another connection from Jacareí
SP-70 (Carvalho Pinto) - An alternate route from neighboring Taubaté or Jacareí
SP-99 (Tamoios) - Connects the city to Caraguatatuba on the coast
Get around[edit]
On foot[edit]
The best areas to explore on foot are the Centro (Downtown) and Vila Adyana neighborhoods, southeast of the Banhado. There you can find most of the city's historical buildings, street commerce, and pleasant green areas like the Vicentina Aranha and Santos Dumont parks, plus of course the Banhado itself.

By bus[edit]
Buses linking downtown to the suburbs are relatively frequent, although quite crowded during peak hours. Suburb-to-suburb transport, on the other hand, is extremely limited. Many companies and research institutes are located in areas with limited or almost non-existent bus coverage, making public buses an impractical means of transport for many business tourists. Large companies, however, will typically operate private buses to and from various points in the city.

By taxi[edit]
Taking a cab is a practical way for visitors to move around the main district. Taxi costs R$ 4,50 + R$ 2,25/km (flag 1) or + R$2,90/km (flag 2). A tariff calculator is available online[dead link]. During the month of December, flag 2 applies all day long.

By car[edit]
Renting a car may be more cost-effective than a taxi for long-distance travel, including going to São Francisco Xavier or exploring the areas beyond the municipality. The city grew has grown faster than its road network and public transport capacity, and as a result, São José dos Campos suffers from severe traffic during the peak hours.
Navigating the main district isn't too complicated. It is crossed by two freeways that form an "X" shape: the Anel Viário (southwest to northeast) and the Av. Jorge Zarur/Rod. Nova Tamoios (northwest to southeast), and most of the time you will be not too far from one of them. São José is also crossed by the Rod. Presidente Dutra (BR-116)  (northwest to southeast) that inappropriately functions as one of the main avenues of the city, as it is necessary for people commuting to and from remote suburbs and various factories.
To get around the districts:

Main district => Eugênio de Melo: Take Rod. Presidente Dutra (BR-116) towards Rio de Janeiro
Main district => São Francisco Xavier: From either Rod. Presidente Dutra or the Anel Viário, take Av. Dr. Nélson D'avila/Rod. Monteiro Lobato (SP-050) and get to Monteiro Lobato. Afterwards take the municipal road Monteiro Lobato-São Francisco Xavier

Stay safe[edit]
São José dos Campos is statistically better, in terms of crime, than São Paulo or Campinas, but still considerably less safe than an average countryside town in the state. While not obvious to the average visitor, poverty and drug violence exist in the outskirts of the city. In more affluent areas like Vila Adyana, Jardim Aquarius and Jardim Satélite, robbers sometimes attempt to target wealthy citizens coming to and from restaurants, bars and shopping malls. Therefore, stay alert during the night, avoid displaying signs of wealth and possessions, and take a cab if you need to walk more than a few blocks.
The Downtown area should be avoided during the night, due to the presence of crack addicts. Brazilian funk music parties, common in São José dos Campos and in the Vale do Paraíba region, are often frequented by drug dealers and/or end up in violence. They are best avoided by all but the most adventurous visitors.
