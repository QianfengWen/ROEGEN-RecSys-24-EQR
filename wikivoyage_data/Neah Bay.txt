Cape Flattery
Neah Bay is a small town on the northwest side of Washington state's Olympic Peninsula. It's the northwestern most town of the contiguous United States, with its coast facing north towards Canada's Vancouver Island. The whole town and its surrounding areas are part of the Makah Indian Reservation.


Understand[edit]
Neah Bay is on Admiralty Inlet, north of Olympic National Park and close to Cape Flattery, which is the northwestern most point of the contiguous United States.
The Makah (pron.: /məˈkɑː/, from the Klallam name for the tribe, màq̓áʔa) are a Native American tribe that lives in and around Neah Bay. Their reservation on the northwest tip of the Olympic Peninsula includes Tatoosh Island. The Makah people refer to themselves as "Kwih-dich-chuh-ahtx" (Qʷidiččaʔa·tx̌) which translates as "the people who live by the rocks and seagulls".
The cities of Clallam Bay and Sekiu are within half an hour away along Highway 112; altogether they have a combined population of only about 800 people. Due to the minimum population & attractions for each cities, this travel guide covers all three areas.
A Makah Reservation Recreational Permit is required for every vehicle visiting Neah Bay. It can be purchased for $20 at the marina, the museum & cultural center, Makah Mini Mart, Visitors Center, and the Hobuck Beach Resort, and is valid for one calendar year.

Stay safe[edit]
Alcohol and marijuana are prohibited in the Makah Indian Reservation area, although it is in Washington state where both are legal for ages 21 and above. Please do not attempt to or inadvertently bring them into the area to avoid any further hassle.
Certain species of dogs are also prohibited from roaming the reservation area and all canines are not allowed on Shi-Shi Beach as it's part of the Olympic National Park.
If you are traveling in the wintertime, you are advised to check the weather forecast as it is frequently rainy and sometimes stormy. High winds can cause power outages and rain can cause mudslides. Check with your resort regarding travel advisories before you get there.

Connect[edit]
Mobile connection can be spotty and so far, only Verizon phones can receive signal well in this "remote" part of the USA. When you use your phone along the highway, it can sometimes switch to a Canadian cellular network without you knowing it. Turn off the international roaming to avoid paying a high roaming fare.
It is advisable to bring a physical map in addition to the map on your smartphone, especially if you are venturing out further into the Indian Reservation where you may have little luck in finding a signal.
Wireless Internet is usually available at hotels and selected restaurants.

Go next[edit]
