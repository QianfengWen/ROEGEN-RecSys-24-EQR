Ripon is a cathedral city in North Yorkshire, England, with a population in 2011 of 16,702. Its main attraction is the cathedral, and the nearby UNESCO World Heritage Site of Fountains Abbey and Studley Royal Water Garden. It’s also a good base for exploring the Yorkshire Dales.


Understand[edit]
Newby Hall
Ripon has long been a religious centre. In 1132 thirteen monks were expelled from the Benedictine house in York (rioting, rowdiness, just the usual monastic peccadilloes). They found a new base in the valley of the little River Skell and affiliated to the Cistercians. Their abbey grew wealthy through wool, and they farmed far and wide, even as far away as Preston ("priest town") across the Pennines. The great stone buildings of Fountains Abbey grew up in the 12th and 13th centuries. It then struggled, through instability in the wool trade, attack by the Scots, plague, and the Papal schism. It revived in the 14th century but like other monasteries was dissolved by Henry VIII in 1539.
The abbey lands passed through several owners until in 1693 they were inherited by John Aislabie, who from 1718 was Chancellor of the Exchequer. In that role he almost bankrupted the entire country single-handed, by touting the South Sea Company, set up to operate the slave trade. Remarkably this made a loss, and its bubble share price collapsed in 1720. Aislabie was thrown out of Parliament, imprisoned in the Tower of London and barred from public office. With time on his hands upon his release, he set about prettifying his estate. His son William added the abbey ruins to the estate, and created the water garden. In 1983 it passed to the National Trust. 
Ripon meanwhile grew as a provincial market town; it was connected for a while by canal and railway but never became industrial, so its old centre has been preserved. Its church connection continued into modern times, with a women's Anglican teacher training college based here from 1862. In 1974 this merged with a similar men's college to form the College of Ripon and York St John. It later affiliated to the University of Leeds, then to York and relocated there in 2001. It's now the independent York St John University.

The Watchman blows his horn on Market Square at 9 pm, as he has every night since 886 AD, to warn everyone to get indoors, safe from marauding Vikings. The horn was originally presented by King Alfred the Great, to symbolise Ripon’s charter as a city, and to remind folk to stay vigilant against the foes he’d defeated.

Chapel of St Mary Magdalen on Magdalen's Road half a mile north of the cathedral was founded in the 12th century as part of a leper hospital. It was re-modelled in the 15th century, fell into disuse in the 19th but has been restored. None of the medieval skeletons found about it showed signs of leprosy (Hansen's Disease), but any disfiguring chronic skin disease could get you so labelled and shunned.
Ripon Canal starts from town centre and courses south for two miles to join the River Ure. It was completed in 1773, bringing in coal and taking out agricultural goods, but in the 1840s a railway company got their hands on it and deliberately let it fall derelict. It was abandoned in the 1950s but a campaign group had it restored. It's navigable throughout, as is the Ure beyond which connects to the Ouse-Aire-Calder canal network. There's a footpath but no cycleway.

Daily Apr-Oct 10AM-6PM, Nov-Mar 10AM-5PM. The abbey was founded in 1132 by a group of monks expelled from the Benedictines. They affiliated with the Cistercians, and Fountains grew up in Norman style. It went through a bad patch in the 12th and 13th centuries, but revived in the 14th and 15th, then Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries in 1539. The land came into the hands of the Mallory and Aislabie families, who beautified the river valley with a landscaped water garden. Most visitors start from the south entrance and visitor centre. Look into the stables (which exhibits medieval textiles) and Fountains Hall (a beautiful Jacobean mansion with a display of the 1930s, when a model farm was established for the unemployed.) You then descend into the valley for the old water mill, then the abbey ruins, with a cloister, church and living quarters. The Huby Tower on the north transept looks much newer: it was added just before the Dissolution. Continue downstream through the water park, dotted with cod-classical follies and a few modern art installations. This leads to the north gate, where you can exit to see Studley Park then show your ticket for re-entry. You can also start from this end. Adult £18.70, child £9.40, NT members free.

Fountains Abbey
Studley Park is outside the north gate of the abbey and water park, so you could visit separately, but most visitors see the abbey first, then exit into Studley Park. There's an ornamental lake, and the 19th-century St Mary’s Church, paid for with the unspent ransom for Frederick Grantham Vyner, murdered in 1870 by Greek bandits before they could collect. The Choristers House is a charming Victorian Gothic creation adjacent. Formerly a music school, nowadays it’s let by the National Trust as a holiday cottage (five bedrooms, sleeps ten). Beyond stretches a deer park. Studley Royal House in the park was a medieval manor which burnt down and was replaced by a Palladian mansion. This too burnt down in 1946, but the stable block survived and was converted into a private residence, which you can't visit.
