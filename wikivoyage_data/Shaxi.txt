Shaxi (沙溪; Shā​xī​) is in Yunnan Province.


Get in[edit]
From Dali and Lijiang
In the past, there were no direct buses to Shaxi from either Lijiang or Dali and travellers were forced to change buses in the county seat of Jianchuan County. Nowadays, however, both cities actually do have direct bus services to Shaxi. In Dali, buses to Shaxi depart from both the Dali Bus Terminal (大理汽车客运站) and the Dali Old Town Bus Terminal (大理古城客运站). In Lijiang, buses depart from the Lijiang Bus Terminal (丽江客运站). The trip to Shaxi from both Dali and Lijiang takes approximately 2 hours.
In addition to the above bus services, there is also a shuttle bus organized by the Landscape Hotel which takes people between their Shaxi and Dali hotels. The buses run at 09:00 and 15:00 from both locations and can be booked by visiting the hotel or asking your accommodation to ring them. Price is ¥80 each way. It's only small minivans, so it is advisable to buy the ticket a day in advance.
From Shangri-la
If coming from Shangri-La, you will need to change buses in Lijiang.

Get around[edit]
The main village of Shaxi (Sideng) can be easily toured by walking. It's also possible to visit the many other villages in Shaxi on foot, however, renting a bicycle would be a quicker and better option. Several shops near the main square offer bicycle rental (¥20 for full day hire) and also some of the guesthouses such as the Dragonfly and 58 Yard. Hiking and horseback riding are the main options for a visit into the mountains around Shaxi.

See[edit]
 Baoxiang Temple (宝相寺) (See Shibao Shan). 
 Shizhong Temple (石钟寺) (See Shibao Shan). If you buy the ticket at Shizhong Temple, it is ¥10. 
 Shibao Shan (石宝山; Stone Treasure Mountain) (12 km north of Shaxi on the road from Jianchuan and 11 km south of the Dali-Jianchuan road). A fantastic nature reserve and religious site that was one of the first to be officially protected by China in 1982. There are numerous temples and grottoes as well as some fantastic views and walks amongst the old forests. Shibaoshan covers a big mountain area with its main points of interest some times distant kilometers away. Arriving there by taxi it is advisable to ask the driver to take you to some of the further temples (he will not need to pay entrance ticket), as Baoxiang Temple. Going up to the temple there are some families of monkeys that some times turn very aggressive to the visitors. Minor injuries have been reported. Shizhong Temple (Stone Bell Temple) has the highest concentration of stone carvings. If you want to walk from Sideng town: get out of town through the main road going North, pass a gas station on your left, and on kilometer mark 113 turn left (West) into a dirt road; walk about 20 minutes and reach the southern edge of the Shibaoshan area (it's another 1-2 hours walk uphill to Shizhong Temple). The entrance fee is ¥50 (students free?). 
 Friday Market (On the main road in Sideng. Just follow all the crowds.). As the last remaining market town on the ancient Tea & Horse Caravan trail, Shaxi still hosts the local market every Friday. The Bai people from all the villages in Shaxi Valley and the Yi people from the surrounding mountains all come together to trade everything from fresh produces to supplies and horses. Minority women will be dressed in their colorful traditional costumes, and men will often lead pack mules to carry supplies back to their mountain villages, much like in the days of the Tea & Horse Caravan Trail hundreds of years ago.

Three squares and one screen wall and four-in-five patios can be seen everywhere. Ouyang’s three-square-one-zhaobi Damadian and Zhao’s four-in-five patios still seem to show off to people today. The splendor of wealthy families in a prosperous place of economic and trade. Wandering in the lanes of the ancient market and stepping lightly on the stone pavement on Sifang Street, which is polished by horse hooves, will make you feel like you are stepping into history step by step. The smoke from the all-green tiled houses is floating, and the only remaining ancient Dongzhai Gate The appearance remains the same, and the ancient stage with cornices and corners still vaguely interprets the facial makeup of history, telling you the vicissitudes of history.

They are very precious. Among them, "Prince's Garden" and other paintings vividly depict the ancient Nanzhao and Dali palaces. Life has made up for the lack of historical records about the palace life of the ancient Nanzhao and Dali Kingdoms that were very popular in southwest China, and has become one of the important historical evidences for the study of Nanzhao and Dali Kingdoms; Xingjiao Temple preserves Buddhist murals from the Ming Dynasty, with a wide range of themes, numerous characters, vivid shapes, lifelike images, smooth lines, and gorgeous colors. They integrate Buddhist stories and secular life, are full of mythical atmosphere, and have quite a national style. Inheriting the legacy of famous paintings such as "Nanzhao Zhongxing Painting Scroll" and "Zhang Shengwen Painting Scroll", it is a rare imitation of ancient Bai painting art treasures and a valuable material for studying ancient Bai religion and art. The painter once copied it and sent it to Beijing for exhibition, which caused a sensation in the cultural circles of Beijing and attracted attention from all walks of life. ticket sales stop at 17:00; tickets are ¥220.

Do[edit]
 Hiking. There are a lot of hiking trails in the mountains both to the east and to the west of Shaxi Valley. The trails are what the local villagers use to go between villages, or to collect firewood, wild herbs, and mushrooms. There are no markers, the trails are easy to follow, but a good sense of direction is needed to not get lost.The 46 Horse Pen Hostel hosts weekly guided hikes around the mountains every Saturday. If you're lucky, they'll bring along their two giant dogs to make the hike more fun. 
 Cycling. The Shaxi Valley and its numerous villages is a great place to explore on a bicycle. A day spent riding on the small single-track trail between green farm fields can yield many surprises and hidden gems. 
 Kayaking. 2 hr. It's possible to kayak down the shallow and slow moving water of the Heihui River to see Shaxi Valley from a different angle. Starting from the northern edge of Shaxi Valley and Shibaoshan and ends in Sideng village, the water is mostly flatwater, with a couple small dams that can be navigated.Professional guiding is required.

Holidays and festivals[edit]

 Taizihui Holiday (太子会). The biggest religious holiday in Shaxi, it is held every year on the 8th day of the second month on the lunar calendar. 
Buy[edit]
 Wood carving.  It is possible to buy wood carvings in Shaxi, but a better place to buy wood carvings is Jianchuan, not the most glamorous destination but a place that is famous in China for its high quality wood carvings (the carvings on sale in Shaxi all come from Jianchuan, so you pay a markup owing to this). If you hire a driver outside the bus station at Jianchuan for a modest fee, he will take you to some of the dozen or so shops located along one road just outside the city, where you can buy some outstanding pieces. Take a sedative beforehand to avoid sticker shock, most of these carvings are very expensive.
 Wild mushrooms.

Connect[edit]
Go next[edit]
Catch the mini-bus (45 min, ¥10) to Jianchuan from outside the Shaxi bus station. There are daily buses to many other cities in Yunnan from the Jianchuan bus station. Price and schedule subject to change so better confirm with the Jianchuan bus station when you first arrive in Jianchuan.
Jianchuan and the roads that lead to Lijiang and Dali are quite congested due to large scale road construction of the new Kunming Shangri-La Highway.  On the road to Dali, be prepared for long traffic jams and white knuckle encounters with heavy lorries. To go straight to Old Town Dali without getting stuck at the bus station, ask the driver to drop you off at the East Gate, as the bus will pass right near it. Ask your hostel to write this down in Chinese for you. You will save both time and money.
If heading to Dali an interesting alternative with much better scenery is the X804 road down through Qiao Hou, Lian Tie and into Yangbi.  Mini Buses leave Jianchuan at 07:30 and 13:20 everyday, arriving to pick up outside the stationary store in Shaxi Village about one hour later.  The fare down to Yangbi is ¥25 and the trip takes about four hours.  From Yangbi Station, there are regular buses to Xiaguan (Dali New Town), Xiaohuayuan Qiqezhan every few minutes.  The journey takes the old road and is about 40 minutes costing ¥10.
