Winter Park is a city of 31,000 people (2019) in Florida near Orlando. Winter Park is often seen as a popular tourist destination for those visiting Orlando that want an escape from the typical tourist scene of the Orlando theme parks. There is a quaint, local feel to the suburb even though there are a lot of tourists, especially during the winter months and holidays.

Rollins College Russell Theatre
Founded as a resort community by northern business magnates in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, fueled by the South Florida Railroad connecting Orlando with northern Florida and beyond. Today Winter Park is home to about 30,000 inhabitants and a popular tourist destination with many festivals. The city is also home to the private liberal arts college, Rollins College.
Its main street, called Park Avenue, is in the middle of town. It includes civic buildings, retail, art galleries, a private liberal arts college (Rollins College), museums, a park, a train station, a golf course country club, a historic cemetery, and a beach and boat launch. Park Ave is prosperous and is the focal point for Winter Park's upscale, "gentrified" downtown, the culmination of which is in Rollins College at the south end. The street's surroundings, including the depot, are immaculate.

Climate[edit]
As is the case across Orlando, Winter Park's climate is hot and humid during the summer, and variable but on average much cooler during the winter. The Park Ave (outdoor) walk, which isn't too protected from the heat, can be unbearably hot during the peak of summer and it's a relief to go indoors. Added to the fact that parking is difficult in downtown, the best time to visit is during the cooler months outside June-September.

By car[edit]
 The main interstate route in the area is I-4 (northeast to southwest), from which there is an exit to Winter Park. Orlando Avenue (north to south) goes through the city itself.
