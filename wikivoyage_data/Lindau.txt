Lindau is a city in southern Bavaria on the shore of Lake Constance or the Bodensee. It lies on the border of the Austrian federal-state of Vorarlberg with its capital city Bregenz which is about 10 km along the lake. The historic town is on an island and full of medieval and half-timbered buildings. One can also take boat tours leaving the small harbor and just sit and enjoy a Weißbier admiring the view of Austria and Switzerland and the Alps across the lake.

Understand[edit]
On a sunny day in summer Lindau is a great place to be. The town is old and very beautiful and has a good market.

Lindau 21
Much like Stuttgart, the railway station situation in Lindau has been subject to ongoing controversy for decades. In the 1990s Deutsche Bahn launched their "Bahnhof 21" ("station 21") program with the 21 standing for the 21st century. The general gist of the idea was always to replace a dead-end station with a through station, which would speed up trains not ending or beginning in the city in question and use the space that would no longer be needed for railway infrastructure for urban development. According to the original plans, said urban development would more than cover the costs of the train station redesign. The plans for such large-scale reorganization of the railway infrastructure of cities like Munich, Frankfurt or Stuttgart quickly ran into opposition and most projects had to be given up as too costly. However, the Neu-Ulm 21 project went ahead and is now largely deemed a success. In Lindau the original plans called for shutting down the dead-end station on the island and re-routing all trains through a new station in Reutin which would make use of cargo infrastructure that was deemed oversized for 21st century needs. However, the citizens did not want to give up the station on the island entirely and three different referenda were held to decide on various aspects of the project. The ultimate end result is that long distance trains are to move to a new station in Reutin, to open with the December 2020 schedule change, the line from Munich through Lindau to Switzerland is to be electrified (significantly speeding up trains) and the island is to retain a slightly downsized train station for local trains.


By train[edit]
47.5522229.7051 Bahnhof Lindau-Reutin (on the mainland in Reutin). The new main station which opened in December 2020 and served by long distance trains including the "Euro City Express" from Munich and Zurich   
47.544189.680782 Lindau Inselbahnhof (Formerly Hauptbahnhof), Am Bahnhof (on the island, directly next to the harbour). With the December 2020 schedule change the erstwhile main station has been demoted to a regional station that is not served by long distance trains. The new station in the borough of Reutin (formerly a cargo station) is closer to where most Lindauers live these days albeit not necessarily to sights of tourist interest.   
Lindau has direct rail EuroCity connections from Munich and Zurich, as well as regional rail services from Austria, other parts of Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg.
Frequent trains run from Bregenz to Lindau and back during the day, single journey €2.40 adult on the ÖBB machine (if you book via the DB machines its more expensive: €4.80 one-way).
Euregio train tickets are available for unlimited travel in the region (including discounts on certain ferries).
The Baden-Württemberg-Ticket is valid on regional trains between Lindau - Kressbronn, and Lindau - Wangen im Allgäu even though parts of the journey are within Bavaria.

By plane[edit]
Bodensee-Airport Friedrichshafen (FDH IATA) is the closest airport and easily accessible by rail.
The next major airports with transcontinental flights are Munich airport (MUC IATA) as well as the airport of Stuttgart (STR IATA).

Lots of tourists come to Lindau from neighbouring harbour towns of Austria and Switzerland in the summer months for a short trip. BSB runs seasonal ferries between April and October.
There the main lines are:

Konstanz / (Mainau) / Meersburg / Friedrichshafen / Lindau / Bregenz (with many stops along the German shore between Meersburg and Lindau) — the trip between Lindau and Bregenz is direct and has no other stops, takes 22 min and costs €5.70 (adults)
Rorschach (Switzerland) / (Bad Schachen) / (Wasserburg) / Lindau — complete journey costs €12.70, 17 CHF (it's a good idea to have your passport with you); three times a day in each direction; complete journey takes about 1 hour
Get around[edit]
By foot[edit]
Lindau is a very small town and exploring it on foot is the best idea. Many parts of the island are for pedestrians only so it is enjoyable to walk around.

By bus[edit]

There is one central bus stop (Anheggerstraße) where all four lines intersect.
