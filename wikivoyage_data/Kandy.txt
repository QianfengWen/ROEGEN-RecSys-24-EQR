Kandy is in the centre of Sri Lanka 125 km away from Colombo and is generally recognised as the island nation's cultural capital. It is on the UNESCO World Heritage List.


Understand[edit]
This is the last kingdom of the country. Since it was conquered by the British around 1815 you can still see the living traditions. Kandyans are usually proud of their heritage. Since the western elements has played a comparatively little role in the city most Kandyans uphold Buddhist values. Since it is in the cultural triangle the authorities try to retain this values as much as possible. However, don't expect to find the honest Kandyans they describe in the colonial literature now. Be careful with your belongings and the people whom you associate with. But this is a peaceful city compared to most other parts of the country with a lower crime rate.

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
The train ride from Colombo to Kandy
From Colombo - Intercity express trains are hassle-free and scenic, 2½ hours. Reservation are needed for these trains, it can be done just before the departure depending on the period but is best done in advance especially if you are travelling on a weekend or holiday. There is a great observation saloon (first class) in this particular train, but this often books out. Other trains are overly crowded and late. Tickets from Colombo are Rs 1,250 first class, Rs 230 in second class, Rs 125 in third class. 
The train line goes further to Badulla, passing on its way Nuwara Eliya (Nanu Oya station from where one needs to take a short bus or tuk-tuk ride to Nuwara Eliya proper), Haputale and Ella.
If you are in Negombo you will have to take some bus, taxi or tuk-tuk to some of the cities where the Main Line train goes to Kandy Ragama, Gampaha or Veyangoda, on the trip you will see the Bible Rock, which resembles the more famous Sigiriya citadel to the north of it.
From Ella, it is a spectacular train ride through hills and tea plantations, 6½ - 8½ hours, Rs 270 / 150 for 2nd / 3rd class.
When you arrive, watch out for the tuk-tuk mafia at the railway station – better catch a tuk-tuk some distance from the station, or even better use Uber, PickMe or the like (again, some distance from the railway station tuk-tuk stand, as otherwise the tuk-tuk mafia there will threaten and chase your driver away). Train schedule can be found at Sri Lankan Railways website[dead link].

By bus[edit]
Goods Shed bus station
From Colombo take bus #1[dead link], more than 70 per day, 3¼ hours. Alternatively get on Intercity air-conditioned bus from Colombo, which is the next best option to the train. If you are female and travelling alone it is best to either sit next to another female or try to sit as close to the conductor as possible (i.e. up front) to avoid any unnecessary surprises.
From the Colombo airport. Walk or take a tuktuk to the bus terminal, where the friendly locals will direct you to the bus to Kandy, 3½ hr, Rs 150 (as of Jan 2013).
From Dambulla bus station there are direct bused to Kandy. No train run on this route. A non-air-con bus will cost Rs 100 and take about 3 hours. Air-conditioned buses are also available on this route but they stop only briefly in Dambulla and they usually stop somewhere outside the bus station.
7.289580.62952 Long-distance bus station (near Goods Shed station). Large bus stop from where depart long-distance buses, including the ones bound to Dambulla. (updated Nov 2016)

By taxi[edit]
If you're just arriving in Sri Lanka, heading for Kandy, you can hire a taxi from one of the stalls in the arrivals hall at Colombo airport for about Rs 6,000. The journey takes about 3 hours. This saves the hassle of going into Colombo, and is a lot quicker and easier.

By hired mini-vans[edit]
Hired mini-vans with a driver are available from Colombo through travel agencies and hotel concierges. The road to Kandy is astonishingly chaotic and frightening even for seasoned travellers. Be prepared for a long slow slog in traffic, or, if your driver decides to make the journey at a more practical speed, a hair-raising adventure replete with passing around blind corners and games of chicken with the ubiquitous intercity buses. A day trip from Mt. Lavinia to Kandy, including seeing the sights in Kandy, costs around Rs 10,000 (May 2011).

By air[edit]
Air Taxi[dead link] (from Colombo) is the latest option to travel to Kandy. The De Havilland Twin Otter float planes operated by Sri Lankan Airlines leave Colombo at 9AM (from Kelani River) and touch down at Mahaweli River in Polgolla, Kandy at 9:30AM The travel time between Colombo and Kandy is 30 minutes. It costs Rs 25,000 (2016).
Cinnamon Air operates daily scheduled flights that depart from Colombo (Bandaranaike International Airport) which reaches Polgolla Reservoir, Kandy in an hour and from Colombo City (Waters Edge) which reaches the destination in 30 minutes. One-way fare per person is listed as US$153 (without tax).

Get around[edit]

The local "Three-Wheelers" ('Tuk-Tuk) are an amazingly cheap (if you know how to haggle! If you can get them for Rs 60-70 per Km you are doing well) and exciting way of seeing the city, and they run virtually all night long.  However, beware of the Tuk-Tuk mafia at the Kandy railway station – they are likely to rip you off (and they threaten Uber or PickMe drivers when they collect passengers near their stand).
Walking is also recommended - the centre is not that large - as a way of seeing temples, shops, shopping area and other sights around the lake. You can visit the Temple of the Tooth by on foot as well but you'll have to ask for directions.
There are plenty of suburban buses that pass through the city center.
