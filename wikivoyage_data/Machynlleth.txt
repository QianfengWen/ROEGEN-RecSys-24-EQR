Understand[edit]
Machynlleth Town Clock
This market town 9f 2,200 people (2011) was the seat of Owain Glyndŵr's Welsh Parliament in 1404, and was the "ancient capital of Wales"; there is an exhibition on Owain where the parliament building once stood.
Since the founding of the Centre for Alternative Technology (CAT) in 1973, the town has acted as a magnet for people interested in an alternative lifestyle. It has developed a thriving Bohemian community and is at the centre of a network of organic farming settlements.

Cliff Railway at the Centre for Alternative Technology
52.622461-3.8415421 The Centre for Alternative Technology, Pantperthog, Machynlleth (frequent bus service from the clock tower (in Machynlleth) to the centre), ☏ +44 1654 705950. This internationally known centre for the development of alternative technology was founded in 1973 as a testbed for sustainable living. In 1975, it opened as a visitor centre, so that the practises developed here could be showcased to the public. The centre is a very interesting place to spend the day, especially for families. The centre shows its sustainable credentials right from the word go, as the car park and bus drop off are located at the bottom of a steep hill below the centre. Visitors use the gravity-powered cliff railway to reach the centre from here. The carriages are fitted with water tanks, which are filled at the top and emptied at the bottom, so that the heavier top car slides down the hill, pulling the other car up as it goes (via a cable and pully system). From the top station it's level walking all around the centre, taking in displays on sustainable homes, transport, water, power generation, agriculture and more. The restaurant serves good, tasty food, but don't expect burgers and hot dogs here. Adult £9.50; child (4-16 years) £4.50; students, people over 60 years and unemployed people £8.50, child (under 4) free. Reduced prices Nov-Mar. 50% reduction on production of a train ticket to Machynlleth, £1 reduction for anyone arriving by bike, foot or bus.   (updated May 2023)
52.5909-3.849392 Royal House and Parliament buildings, Maengwyn Street. Located in the centre of town, these historic buildings are believed to be built on the site of the first Welsh parliament and related buildings of that period.   
 Y Tabernacl (Art Gallery and concert venue), Heol Penrallt, ☏ +44 1654 703335. M-Sa 10AM-4PM. A small museum of modern art - worth having a quick peak if you're in town. Admission free. 
52.5382-3.940383 Dyfi Furnace, Furnace, Eglwysfach (next to the main A487 Aberystwyth road, about 6 miles out of Machynlleth). Open access - generally open at least 10AM to 4PM. Travellers passing by on the main road understandably tend to assume that this mid-18th-century stone building with its large wooden water wheel must have been a mill. In fact, the water wheel powered the bellows of a blast furnace which was used to smelt iron, and Dyfi Furnace is the best-preserved example of an 18th century charcoal-burning blast furnace in the UK. The iron ore was shipped in from Cumbria, while the charcoal to fire the furnace came from the ample local forestry. The building is well-preserved and there's plenty of interpretive displays to help you imagine what it must have looked like when it was fully functioning. Free entry.
