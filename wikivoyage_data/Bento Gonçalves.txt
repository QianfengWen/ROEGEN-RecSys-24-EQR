Understand[edit]
Bento Gonçalves is the wine capital of Brazil. The majority of domestic wine is produced here and most of the country's grape juice also comes from Bento Gonçalves. The city has many vineyards outside of the central business district. It was colonized by Italian immigrants near the end of the 19th century. Its rolling hills, vineyards, historic buildings and Italian heritage have made this city one of the great tourist cities in the Serra Gaúcha.
