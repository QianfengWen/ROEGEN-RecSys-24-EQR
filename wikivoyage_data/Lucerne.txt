Lucerne (Luzern in German, Lozärn in Swiss-German) is a beautiful small city which sits on the shores of Lake Lucerne in the heartland of Switzerland. Lucerne is a popular destination for the city itself and the accessible outings around the lake and local Alps that it offers.

Understand[edit]
The first city to join the Swiss Confederation, today Lucerne is a lovely city of 82,000 people (2018) with a thriving tourism industry, owing mainly to its status as a gateway to Central Switzerland. The city is a centre of Swiss history and legend.
Tourism in Lucerne has a distinguished history dating from the mid-19th century, with Mark Twain among them. In A Tramp Abroad he recalls the nascent souvenir business, and other budding examples of the tourism trade.

"The commerce of Lucerne consists mainly in gimcrackery of the souvenir sort; the shops are packed with Alpine crystals, photographs of scenery, and wooden and ivory carvings. I will not conceal the fact that miniature figures of the Lion of Lucerne are to be had in them. Millions of them." — Mark Twain
Climate[edit]
Lucerne has cold, dry winters and warm/hot summers.

There are hourly trains from Olten and Zürich Airport and half-hourly trains from Zürich, and a direct train every hour from Berne.

There are no intercity buses in Switzerland as the train system provides ample connections to many destinations in Switzerland. To make trips to the countryside in the mountains where there are no trains, refer to postauto.ch buses are available from some nearby places, such as Rotkreuz.

By boat[edit]
Lucerne sits at the northwest end of Lake Lucerne (Vierwaldstättersee), one of the most beautiful waterways in Switzerland.  Schifffahrtsgesellschaft Vierwaldstättersee operates roughly hourly scheduled ferries to Schwyz, Flüelen, Weggis (for Rigi), and runs various themed dinner cruises etc all year around.

Get around[edit]
47°3′6″N 8°18′26″EMap of Lucerne

Able-bodied travellers will find Lucerne a complete joy to get around in on foot. The Old-Town is rather small, and most other interesting sites are within 20 minutes or so walk, there is also a city bus system, as well as assistance for disabled visitors on request from Mobility International Switzerland. The Lido beach and the Swiss Transport Museum are a bit further out but can be reached with a lakeside walk in 30-40 minutes, otherwise they can be reached by bus or by one of several boats per hour from just in front of the central railway station.
Visitors staying overnight in Lucerne get a Visitor Card which gives free bus and train travel in Zone 10 for the duration of their stay. All of the points of interest in Lucerne including the Transport Museum and lower cable-car station for Pilatus are within this zone.
Lucerne also makes a very good base for discovering the rest of Central Switzerland, using the Swiss Federal Railway, the Schifffahrtsgesellschaft Vierwaldstättersee, or any one of several private rail or boat companies. Visitors using Lucerne as a base to explore the region might consider the Tell Pass which covers a large number of trains, buses, boats, and cable-cars in the region around Lucerne.
Bicycles are available for rent at the central railway station, at ticket window 21 on the lower level. For Fr. 31 per day, you can rent a 24-speed, sturdily-built bike with a baggage clamp. Electric bikes are also available. Bike pick-up and drop-off are around the left side of the train station, at a kiosk across the street from the Swiss Post building. Bike lanes are present on most secondary streets, and Lucerne drivers are generally aware of and polite towards bicyclists.

By bus[edit]
Lucerne has an efficient bus network: Verkehrsbetriebe Luzern (VBL) (German only). It covers the city and its suburbs.

See[edit]
The Lion Monument of Lucerne is always busy with tourists - no matter the weather or time of year.
47.051978.307871 The Chapel Bridge (Kapellbrücke). The Chapel Bridge was built in the 14th century to aid in the protection of the city. It is a landmark of Lucerne and is said to be the oldest wooden bridge in all of Europe. A point of interest as you walk over it are the paintings in the rafters depicting 12th-century city life and Swiss history. The bridge was badly damaged by a fire on 18 August 1993; it was rebuilt within a year, but the damage is still visible in places and many of the original paintings were lost. The tower which has had multiple uses over the years (including as a dungeon) is still in the original condition, but not open for visitors. Free.   (updated Dec 2019)
47.0519728.3018062 The Spreuer Bridge (Spreuerbrucke). The Spreuer Bridge, or Chaff Bridge, is the other surviving wooden footbridge in central Lucerne, a short walk from the more famous Chapel Bridge.

47.0583338.3111113 The Lion Monument (Löwendenkmal), Denkmalstrasse 4. Also known as the Lion of Lucerne, it is a sculpture designed by Bertel Thorvaldsen. It commemorates the Swiss Guards who were massacred in 1792 during the French Revolution, when revolutionaries stormed the Tuileries Palace in Paris, France. The American writer Mark Twain (1835–1910) praised the sculpture of a mortally-wounded lion as "the most mournful and moving piece of stone in the world.".

47.0502788.31194410 Lucerne Art Museum (Kunstmuseum Luzern).   
47.0495618.30740311 The Rosengart Collection (Sammlung Rosengart), Pilatusstrasse 10, ☏ +41 41 220 16 60, info@rosengart.ch. Apr–Oct: daily 10:00–18:00; Nov–Mar: daily 11:00–17:00.

The collection also houses 200 photographs, previously housed in the Am-Rhyn-Haus, by David Duncan Douglas, Life Magazine’s World War II photo correspondent who arrived with his camera uninvited at Picasso’s villa “California”, was welcomed by Picasso and his family, and over the years produced an intimate portrait of the artist’s day-to-day life. Picasso's living room was his studio, and domestic scenes — a ballet lesson, Picasso drawing with his children, or wrapping himself in the cape and hat of his native Spain —play out within the backdrop of some of his most famous works. Allow at least 2 1/2-3 hours to see all the artworks. There are three floors, and you should allow plenty of time for each one. The ground floor houses many very interesting works by Picasso, but there are lots of others on the first floor, along with outstanding works by Raoul Dufy, Fernand Léger, Vassily Kandinsky, Georges Rouault, et al. The Klees are all in the basement. The titles in Klee's handwriting are often very small and hard to read, and he did not put titles in every work, so ask for a printed list of composition titles for them. Admission Fr. 20 (Fr. 18 for senior citizens over 65 and registered disabled people, 10 for students up to 30 years old, children 7-16 years).   (updated May 2024)

Do[edit]
Lucerne Carnival - a marching band parading to exactly where they feel like parading
A café in one of the many small old town squares in Lucerne
47.05268.307381 Explore the Old Town. One of the main reasons that Lucerne attracts so many travelers is its small but remarkably preserved old town. You can get lost (for a few minutes anyhow) in its maze of streets, passages, and squares, admiring the many and varied murals painted on what seems like every other building. A nice short walk on the Museggmauer starts at the Schirmer-Turm, walk up the road near Jazzkantine, open only at daytime. 
47.051358.310122 Take a boat tour. Take a boat tour on the lake Lucerne with the traditional steamboats. A ride along the full length of the lake (Lucerne – Flüelen) takes approximately 3 hours. The lake has several tight bends and the landscape changes dramatically during the ride from the high mountains around Flüelen to the gentler hills around Lucerne. The villages and towns along the lake are generally very nice places to take a relaxed day with a walk/swim and food at the lakefront - Weggis and Brunnen for example. Flüelen and Brunnen at the far end of the lake can also be reached by direct train from Lucerne. 
 Take a guided tour. (updated Jan 2017)
47.050258.310013 Rent a bicycle. Lucerne has an excellent bicycle Network. Rent a bicycle at the train station in lucerne and explore the city and the suburbs or make a day trip on the national bicycle network (http://www.veloland.ch/en/veloland.html). 
Watch football ie soccer at FC Luzen, who play in the Super League, the top tier of Swiss football. Their home ground is Swissporarena, capacity 17,000, at 91 Horwerstrasse, 1 km south of city centre next to the Trade Centre.
Mountains[edit]
A number of villages and mountains in the Alps can easily be reached from Lucerne by boat or train as day trips. 

46.979468.255864 Mount Pilatus. A famous mountain overlooking the city of Lucerne. Pilatus is definitely a must and gives you a good impression of a wild and rocky peak with a marvelous view to the "real" Alps. Its peak can be reached by the world's steepest cogwheel railway from Alpnachstad (not operating in wintertime) and all-year-round by cable-car in three sections from Kriens (10 minutes by trolley bus no. 1 from Lucerne as far as 'Linde'). Going up from Alpanachstad and down to Kriens, combined with a boat ride from Lucerne, is called the Golden Round Trip and is over €100. A pleasant, and cheaper, option is to take the train from Lucerne to Alpnachstad (roughly €8), then take the cogwheel railway to Pilatus's peak and then the first cable-car down towards Kriens (roughly €52, or €26 with a rail card), and then hike the rest of the way down to Kriens (free, approximately 2 hours). Of course you can walk the entire way to the top on foot, which takes at least 4 hours from Kriens. In addition to hiking, there are several other activities, including a suspension rope park and a 1,350 m long toboggan (both at the second stop of the cable-car from Kriens). Even if you don't plan to hike, allow for at least three hours to spend on Pilatus. (updated Jul 2022)
47.056698.485415 Mount Rigi. A famous mountain overlooking the city of Lucerne. Its peak at Rigi Kulm can be reached by a cogwheel railway from Vitznau and Arth-Goldau, a cable-car from Weggis takes you to Rigi Kaltbad where you can join the cogwheel railway or walk the rest of the way. Vitznau and Weggis can easily be reached by boat. The boat ride and cogwheel trains are covered by the GA/Swiss Travel Pass. The peak can be reached by foot in around 4-5 hours from the base of the mountain on either side. 
46.771148.434076 Mount Titlis. The mountain Mount Titlis has a glacier on the top and a splendid view. 
 Other mountains. In addition to the popular Pilatus, Rigi, and Titlis there are a number of other mountains in the region which are easy to reach by public transport and are serviced by cable-cars. Stoos and Stanserhorn are included in the Swiss Travel Pass for 2022. The cable car to the Brienzer Rothorn at Sörenberg can be reached in an hour by car or public transport. 
46.81988.410037 Go Trekking or Mountain Biking around Engelberg. (updated Jan 2017)

Go there by boat (Lucerne-Kehrsiten) and funiculaire or by train and bus (Lucerne-Stansstad-Bürgenstock). There are some luxury resorts at Buergerstock. It's also possible to go by mountain bike to the top. 
 Paraglide from Pilatus and Rigi. Paragliding down from the majestic mountains surrounding Lake Lucerne is a unique experience. Tandem paragliding is possible all year round with pilots certified by the Federal Office of Civil Aviation (FOCA) of Switzerland. 
Events[edit]
 Fasnacht. Some cities of Switzerland including Lucerne and Basel celebrate a rousing carnival just before Lent each year. The version celebrated here is famous for its chaotic "march any direction you like" street parades of the so-called Guugemusig (band of wind instruments and drummer, typical to the carnival of Central Switzerland) and elaborate masks. The carnival week of Lucerne starts at the end of February on Fat Tuesday and ends at Ash Wednesday. The programme in short: Fat Tuesday, Urknall (big bang) at 05:00 is the official beginning, music on the streets all the day in the city, mask parade from 14:00 along the lake, music on the streets in the evening; Friday to Sunday music and mask parades in all the towns and villages of the region; Güdis Monday, second Urknall at 06:00, rest ditto Fat Tuesday; Thursday, big street concert in the whole old town and surroundings, end of the official carnival at midnight, but it continues in the bars until the morning of Ash Wednesday. As with carnival elsewhere, the exact date on the calendar is variable according to the phase of the moon. You find the date of the next Fat Tuesday (SchuDo, Schmutziger Donnerstag) here. If you don't want to be recognised as a tourist, put on some colorful clothes. Most of the locals dress in colors or in masks. The cities of Zürich and Berne have started to copy Central Switzerland's carnival.

Stay safe[edit]
Lucerne is a heavily touristed destination, and where there are tourists there are pickpockets, con artists, and other sorts of folks up to no good.  As with everyplace else keep your passport and other valuables where people can't get to them. However, Lucerne is a friendly and safe city. Women can move safely almost anywhere, day or night. There are few areas that should be avoided; the area around Basel Street, where you will find a colourful and exciting cultural mix, is relatively harmless. According to the police it can be dangerous at night in "Tribschen" (Inseli-Ufschötti-Weinbergli-Tribschenstrasse). Most violent crimes and robberies happen in this neighborhood. But compared with other cities in Europe it's a safe area.
