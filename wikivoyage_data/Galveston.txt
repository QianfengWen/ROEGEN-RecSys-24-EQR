Galveston is a city on Galveston Island, off the Texas Gulf Coast, approximately 45 minutes southeast of Houston. Galveston is a port of entry and a destination for almost all the cruise ships with ports of call in Texas.  Many Houstonians have beach houses in Galveston or elsewhere in Galveston County where they sometimes relocate during the summer, or simply drive to Galveston to enjoy the local beach. This article also covers Port Bolivar, which is just to the northeast, an 18-minute ferry ride away.


Understand[edit]
Galveston is a beach resort town in the Houston area. Every summer and spring break, Houstonians crowd the beaches of Galveston as well as tourists from all over the United States (notably the South). Other than beaches, Galveston also has many attractions such as a pleasure pier, the Schlitterbahn water park, and Moody Gardens (a resort complex). Galveston is home to East Beach which is known for being a "party beach". Many famous artists perform occasionally and special events take place. People looking for a good time crowd East Beach. Galveston also has many nightclubs. For people looking for family fun in the sun, Stewart Beach is the premier family beach in the Houston area. Volleyball tournaments and sandcastle competitions take place on Stewart Beach. Apart from sunbathing and clubbing, Galveston is also home to a wide range of shopping. Seawall Boulevard has many shops for beachgoers such as surf shops, sunglasses, sim wear, sunscreen, and souvenir shops as well as boutiques, clothing stores, and so on. Dining is also a big deal on the island, as Galveston is known for having some of the freshest seafood. There are also many burger shops and restaurants of all kind. Many restaurants are located on the beach.
Named after Bernardo de Gálvez y Madrid, Count of Gálvez and taken over by privateer Jean Lafitte for a while as his personal-like fiefdom around 1820, Galveston was controlled by the Confederacy but then in a twist of fate became a sort of freedman's refuge after the Civil War, as it prospered in becoming Texas' great cotton port. Then the great hurricane of 1900 hit, obliterating the barrier island and taking much of the city and some 6000 lives with it. A seawall was built along the extent of the city and the city became a mecca for hedonistic activities like gambling, but it never regained its premier port status, in part because of the development of the Houston Ship Channel further inland. However it holds its place among Gulf tourist destinations today and is a major cruise embarkation point.

Climate - Semi-tropical; averaging 57 °F (14 °C) in the winter months and 81 °F (27 °C) in the summer months.

29.265278-94.8605561 Scholes International Airport (GLS  IATA). This is the only airport in Galveston, but only serves private and chartered flights.   
29.65491-95.27582 William P. Hobby Airport (HOU IATA). One of two airports in Houston providing scheduled commercial flights into the metro area, and the closest commercial airport to Galveston. It is directly connected to Galveston by Interstate 45; the drive takes about 45 minutes. Hobby Airport is dominated by Southwest Airlines.   (updated Mar 2024)
George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH IATA) Also in Houston, and dominated by United Airlines. Take US Route 59 south into downtown Houston and exit into Interstate 45 south; you will pass by Hobby Airport en route. Allow at least 90 minutes to drive from IAH to Galveston, probably more during rush hour. IAH asks returning passengers to arrive 2 hours before check-in.
By car[edit]
I-45 South is the easiest route from Houston to Galveston Island.  The freeway becomes Broadway St. on the island.
The San Luis Pass-Vacek Toll Bridge offers access to Galveston Island from Surfside Beach along State Highway 87. State Highway 288 connects the Greater Houston area to this route.
By boat[edit]
The Bolivar Peninsula - Galveston Island Ferry is a free vehicle ferry that regularly runs between Port Bolivar - located on mainland east of Galveston - and the island. For travel between New Orleans and Galveston, the ferry can save 30-40 minutes by avoiding Houston. The ferry is run on a first-come first-served basis, and there are often moderate waits during rush hour, and very long waits (on the order of 2-3 hours) on major holidays.  Weekend evening waits also tend to be long. The trip is normally 18 minutes long, plus 9 minutes for loading. The addresses for the ferry are 123 State Highway 87 in Port Bolivar and 1000 North Ferry Road in Galveston.
By train[edit]
The national railroad operator Amtrak provides a Thruway bus service from Longview, connecting with its Texas Eagle. This train runs daily between Chicago and San Antonio, with through cars to and from Los Angeles three times per week. Additionally, the Sunset Limited, running three times per week between New Orleans and Los Angeles calls in nearby Houston. The bus stop is at 123 Rosenberg Street, next to the city's transit center.
Amtrak operates a daily shuttle between the Transit Station at 902 Washington Ave, but it only allows passengers who have arrived by their trains.

By shuttle[edit]
Several connections from IAH and HOU airports, through Galveston Express, Galveston Shuttle and Galveston Limousine.

The island is small enough that walking can take you most places, although it is not recommended in all neighborhoods, particularly outside the historic district, the Strand, and the Harborside district.
Seawall Blvd. is one of the busiest parts of Galveston, especially during the summer.  Since Galveston streets are in a grid it is easy to find a less-busy parallel street to travel on, but watch out for unexpected one-way streets.
Metered street parking is available throughout the city, so bring change. The city operates a replica streetcar service, which operates in the historic district and parts of Seawall Blvd.  Pedal cars are also available to rent from various vendors for use along the Seawall and the Strand. Island Transit offers limited bus service for the city.

 Bolivar Ferry. Free ferry for automobiles and pedestrians between Galveston Island and Bolivar Peninsula. The ferry ride is about 25 minutes, but waiting times for the ferry can be considerably longer, especially on busy weekends. If the vehicle line is long, a good option is to stay in the right lane on Ferry Road, park your car, and walk on the ferry to ride it across and back. Good views of the bay, ship traffic, and sometimes wildlife. Children will have much fun feeding anything edible to sea gulls at the stern of the ferry.

Stay safe[edit]
Like any other tourist city, it is safe, but petty crime does happen. Use common sense, locking your car is a must. Bums will often hang out in the middle of the intersections.
Water currents can be a danger along any part of the island. Swimming near lifeguard stations and obeying safety signs may offer some assurance.
Straits have treacherous waters, largely due to murky water and fast moving currents: many drownings occur in the vicinity of the San Luis Pass compared to other areas off of nearby beaches.
Water current dangers are more prominent up to about one mile away from island straits not protected by a jetty. Entering the water is not allowed in many of these areas.
