By car[edit]
The best way to drive to Amarante is using the A4 motorway if you are coming from Porto or the IP4 Expressway if you are coming from the north or Spain. Just take any exit towards Amarante and you will be 5 min from the city centre. The city is about 1 hour from Porto and 5 hours from Lisbon.

Get around[edit]
On foot[edit]
Amarante is a small town and you can easily see all its monuments on foot - in addition, cars cannot enter most streets in the historic centre, and you can see the city much better on foot.

By car[edit]
Driving is a bad idea in Amarante. At some times of the year, Amarante is invaded by visitors, who fill the streets, creating an impossible traffic, and occupy the car parks, of which there are only a few. Nor is it necessary to take the car, as the city is so small that it can be covered entirely on foot.

See[edit]
The monastery and bridges attributed and dedicated to Gonçalo de Amarante
41.269722-8.0786111 Mosteiro de São Gonçalo, Praça da República. Before the monastery existed, here was a chapel, erected by São Gonçalo de Amarante. In 1540, it was transformed into a large monastery with the construction of a Dominican convent in honor of São Gonçalo, with authorization and help from D. João III and his wife, Rainha Dª Catarina. The construction of the Church and the Convent ended in the time of Philip I, before 1600. The construction of the portico and the Balcony of the Kings began on October 12, 1683. In the church, the tomb of São Gonçalo stands out, a magnet for several pilgrims.   
41.268889-8.0780562 Ponte de São Gonçalo, Praça da República. True symbol of the city, it connects two Largo de Amarante, including Praça da República, where you can find the monastery, another symbol. Before this bridge, a national monument, there was another one, dating from the 13th century and which was destroyed by a flood of the Tâmega River. In the middle of the bridge there was a cruise, taken an hour before the tragic event, which can still be seen in one of the windows of the Monastery of São Gonçalo. The current one was built in the 17th century. In 1809 it was the stage for the heroic Defense of the Amarante Bridge, an episode resulting from the French Invasions. In memory of this event, there is a commemorative plaque on the north side of the bridge.  
41.2696-8.07953 Casa da Cerca (Biblioteca Municipal Albano Sardoeira, Albano Sardoeira Municipal Library), Alameda Teixeira de Pascoaes, ☏ +351 255 420 236. The Municipal Library is the result of the former Santa Clara Convent, perhaps built in the 13th century. The most likely date, however, will be 1383, when D. João I granted the letter of protection for religious women. It was set on fire in April 1809 during the French Invasions. It was later transformed into the building that today is seen by an emigrant from Brazil - not without prolonged archaeological research, which exposed many artefacts. Nowadays it is the Municipal Archive and Library of Amarante.  
41.2696-8.07864 Museu Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso, Alameda Teixeira de Pascoaes (in the cloister of the Monastery of São Gonçalo), ☏ +351 255 420 233. Closed Mondays and holidays; open from Tuesday to Sunday, from 10:00 to 12:30 and from 14:00 to 17:30. It was founded in 1947 by Albano Sardoeira to gather materials from the history of Amarante. Over the years, he specialized in contemporary art, bringing together one of the most important collections in the country, which includes works by Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso, António Carneiro, Jaime Isidoro, Nadir Afonso, Rui Pimental and Cargaleiro. €2.50 for an adult ticket. 
41.269005-8.0791755 Igreja de São Domingos, Rua Frei José Marante (go up the stairs from Praça da República; if you prefer to take a less inclined and less crooked path, you can do it despite being longer: go up Rua 5 de Outubro, continue through Teixeira de Vasconcelos and go up Rua Frei José Marante, passing through Largo de Santa Clara and going down the street to the church).). Next to the monastery, at the top of a gigantic staircase, you can find a small church dedicated to the Lord of the Afflicted. It is better known as Igreja de São Domingos, because it was built at the behest of the Order of São Domingos at the beginning of the 18th century. Baroque style, in the 17th-century style, it has a beautiful chancel covered with gilded woodcarving.  
41.269661-8.0815456 Igreja de São Pedro, Teixeira de Vasconcelos Street/Largo de São Pedro. Once the site of a small chapel dedicated to São Martinho, the Church of São Pedro belonged to the Brotherhood of Clérigos de São Pedro. It has a beautiful chancel from the 18th century, by António Gomes. The altar has a very rich gilt carving, with columns that frame the images of São Pedro and São Paulo. At the top of the tower are the papal cross and tiara.  
41.271667-8.08257 Solar dos Magalhães, Largo de Santa Luzia. These are some ruins of the 18th century, set on fire in 1809 by Napoleon's armies, during the French Invasions, as a reprisal for the prolonged resistance of the Amarantines. Once a majestic manor house, it sits on a row of arches, topped by a colonnade.

From here you have a great view of the bridge, the monastery and the houses that are on the river bank. If you prefer a more "aerial" view, go up the stairs to the Church of São Domingos, from where you enjoy a beautiful view of the monastery, the river and the opposite bank, and go along Rua Frei José Amarante until the Santa Clara square, from where he enjoys the best view of Amarante, seeing the south bank of the river, a good part of the north bank, and the entire monastery, including the cloisters, where the Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso Museum is installed.
Pedal boats: On the river bank (go down Alameda Teixeira de Pascoaes until you reach some pedestrian walks; go down until you reach a strange looking building, the market; go to the back of the market and go to the river bank) you can see a series of pedal boats that you can rent, and that offer a great view of the river and the bridge. It doesn't have a good view of the city, but you can still see some of its buildings, like the monastery. A good way to pass the time.

Eat[edit]
The geographical location of the city, between the Minho/Douro Litoral and the Trás-os-Montes (although officially belonging to the Douro Litoral) directly influenced the Amarantine gastronomy, which contains characteristics of all these provinces. Nowadays, the Amarantine cuisine is based on hypercaloric dishes (bad destination if you are making a fortune or if you are vegetarian) such as the mountain goat, the arouquesa and maronesa veal, the feijoada, the tripe, the Portuguese stew, the cod, etc.
Particularly famous is the codfish from Zé da Calçada and Custódia, which were once the two most important restaurants in the city, vying for customers and trying to present the best cod. (Custody cod is no longer known by that name). Also common is chicken rice, whose main ingredients are chicken, rice and chicken blood. Amarantine sweets are also famous, namely egg sweets, which combine very well with Douro wine, produced not far from the city. Throughout the city, you can see pastries filled with delicious sweets, such as the papos-de-Anjo, the rockets, the lilies and the breezes of Tâmega. Also on the edge of the monastery, on small stands you can find typical sweets from the region, including phallic sweets, which (supposedly) serve to encourage young people to seek love,
