Understand[edit]
The village of Hythe lies in a pivotal position on the western shore of Southampton Water abutting the New Forest. In the area now known as the Waterside, Hythe is the central village of numerous small communities vastly expanded by dormitory housing serving the petrochemical industries in the Waterside and the City of Southampton. 
Calshot Spit comprises a flint pebble structure around one mile long. Between it and the main shore is a salt marshy area with a wealth of wildlife and birds. The nearby Fawley Power Station discharged cooling water into the shallow waters around Calshot beach, and this has led to some reports of warm water species being attracted into the Solent. The Habitats Directive Review of Consents for the Solent Maritime Special Area of Conservation (SAC) did indeed identify thermal pollution on the intertidal zone on the west shore of Southampton Water, but this is likely to be from more than this one source. Excavation for the nearby power station discovered buried land surfaces from the Neolithic period.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
50.9503-1.35671 Southampton Airport (SOU IATA) is a relatively small airport and serves destinations in the UK and Europe. It is about 15 miles from Hythe via the M27.

By ferry[edit]
The Hythe ferry is a practical and charming way to travel between Hythe and the Town Quay in central Southampton. An adult return costs £7 (return leg valid for a month), and cycles are charged £1 (as of 2020). The ferry departs every half hour, 7 days a week and the journey takes about 15 minutes. If you like quirky transport and spectacular sea views then the journey is worth making just for fun. A shuttle bus operates at the Southampton end between the Town Quay, the West Quay shopping centre and Southampton Central station. 

By train[edit]
Hythe no longer has its own main line rail service – the last train ran in 1966 and the station is now the village museum. However, you can reach Hythe easily from the stations at Lymington and Southampton (via bus or ferry).

By taxi[edit]
There are a couple of local taxi companies providing local and long distance travel services from major airports, towns, bus and rail stations to Hythe. New Forest Taxi and Soton Taxi provide instant cab/taxi booking facility.  

Taxi fare is approximately £80 from Heathrow, £90 from Gatwick, 130 from Luton and £20 from Southampton, £30 from Bournemouth airport.
By bus[edit]
Bluestar Buses travel from Southampton, £8, between 1 hour 20 and 1 hour 30.
