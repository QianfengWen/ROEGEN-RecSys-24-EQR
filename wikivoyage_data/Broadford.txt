Broadford (Gaelic: An t-Àth Leathann) is a village straggling along the main road across Skye in the Scottish Inner Hebrides. All island routes converge here so you're bound to pass through it. Its name refers to the "broad fjord" of the bay, not the river crossing, but historically it meant only the western settlement around that crossing: Harrapool, Sculamus and Breakish are the eastern extension of Broadford. The population in 2020 was 1170. 


Get in[edit]

By road the usual route is to follow A87 across the toll-free bridge from Kyle of Lochalsh. Or you can take A830 "The Road to the Isles" to Mallaig, car ferry to  Armadale, then A851 north to Broadford. Going back, an indicator board at the start of A851 shows the status of the ferry. In summer you must book your ferry space, as you face a long wait if you turn up at Armadale or Mallaig without a booking. 
See Glenelg for the strange little ferry that plies across the eastern narrows in summer only, and it only fits six cars. (Historically it was for cattle-drovers, with their herds swimming alongside.) This lands you at Kylerhea, not really a village, just a hillside covered with stones and bracken. The lane from the pier crosses lonely moors to reach A87 east of Broadford by the airstrip.
By bus: Citylink Bus 915 runs twice daily from Glasgow Buchanan Station via Glasgow Airport, Dumbarton, Loch Lomond west bank, Crianlarich, Glencoe, Fort William and Invergarry, crossing the Skye Bridge to Kyleakin then onward to Broadford; about 6 hrs 30 min. It continues via Sligachan and Portree to Uig, for ferries to Tarbert on Harris and Lochmaddy on North Uist.
Citylink Bus 917 runs twice daily from Inverness via Loch Ness, taking 2 hr 30 min to Broadford then on to Sligachan and Portree.
Stagecoach Bus 52 runs 3 or 4 times daily from Armadale pier (connecting with the ferries) to Broadford, Sligachan and Portree.
Bus 55 runs three times M-F from Kyle of Lochalsh to Kyleakin and Broadford, with two continuing to Torrin and Elgol.
By train the nearest station is Kyle of Lochalsh, where trains from Inverness connect with the buses across Skye.

Get around[edit]
The village straggles, but you can walk around it, and to the start of the Beinn na Caillich ascent.

See[edit]
Kayaks in Broadford Bay
Wildlife: along the shore, always be on the look-out for otters, seals and birds of prey.
Pabay is the island a couple of miles out in the bay. Seeing it from shore is all you can do, as it's a private estate with no ferry, and the same for Scalpay a few miles northwest and linked to Skye by a causeway, not to be confused with Scalpay on Harris.
Raasay is the island you can visit; the ferry sails from Sconser near Sligachan.
See Elgol for Kilchrist ruined church and other sights along B8083 leading southwest.
Do[edit]
57.2378-5.976111 Beinn na Caillich : There are two mountains of this name on Skye, this one is the 732 m / 2402 ft summit behind Broadford, the first big peak you see on the road across Skye. The path ascends from Coirechatachan on A87 (Grid ref NG619227). It's a steep slog, with the path often lost under boulders. (Dr Johnson and Boswell thought about climbing it, but wimped out.) The slope is convex so you don't see the summit until the top. There's a very large summit cairn, said to be the burial place of a Norse princess. From here you can retrace your steps, or continue to the lower summits of Beinn Dearg Mhor and Beinn Dearg Beag then down to the road.
Skye Guides lead rock-climbing and scrambling expeditions over the Cuillin, tailored to your ability.
Kayaking is pleasant around this coast but bring your own, there's no local hire facility.
