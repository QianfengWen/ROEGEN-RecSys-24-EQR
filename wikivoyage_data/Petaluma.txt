Petaluma is a charming historic town of 60,000 people (2020) amid the hills and pastures of Sonoma County in the Bay Area of California. Petaluma is known for its well-preserved historic center and as a local hub for the Petaluma Valley region of Sonoma County.


Understand[edit]
Petaluma was founded in 1848, as a crossroads and marketplace for southern Sonoma and northern Marin counties. Agriculture is and always was central to the town's identity.
In the early part of the 1900s, Petaluma was known as the "Egg Basket of the World" due to the large number of chicken farms nearby.  Although electronic industries, especially telecom, have started displacing Petaluma's numerous cattle, chicken, and sheep ranches, much of Petaluma still maintains the feel of the old cow-town.

There are a few ways to enter the city. However, the two most common ways are from the freeway or the backroads.
HWY 101: The main way to arrive Petaluma is via Highway 101 North or South. HWY 116 W merges with HWY 101 N at the second exit in town. There are four main exits off the freeway: Petaluma Blvd So., Lakeville/116, Washington St. and Petaluma Blvd. No. HWY 1: Offers another way in to Petaluma. From the coastal Highway take the Point Reyes-Petaluma Road which eventually turns into D Street and leads you directly into downtown Petaluma. Old Redwood Highway & Stoney Point Road: Alternative backroads between Santa Rosa and Petaluma. All are popular cycling routes for athletes and commuters, so share the road!
While a car is the fastest and easiest way to travel in and out of the city, there is also a bus service. Golden Gate Transit provides intercounty bus service (Sonoma, Marin, & San Francisco counties). Sonoma County Transit provides service within Sonoma County only.  Amtrak also provides connecting bus service.
One of the more enjoyable ways to enter and exit the city is by bicycle. For cycle enthusiasts there are numerous backroads and alternative routes to enjoy.

By train[edit]
Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit, or SMART, connects Petaluma with Sonoma County Airport, Santa Rosa, Rohnert Park, Novato, San Rafael, and Larkspur, with connections to the ferry to San Francisco. The segment from Novato to Petaluma is quite scenic, with marshes and hills rolling by. However, the train is primarily for commuters, so the mid-day and weekend schedules are very limited.
38.23739-122.6351161 Petaluma Downtown SMART station  is a short walk from downtown.

Get around[edit]
It's easiest to get around by car if traveling from one end of the city to another. Downtown parking can sometimes be unavailable on the street, and the downtown area is often impassable on weekends due to events.  Should you happen to find parking, strictly adhere to the time limits posted. Tickets are given. There are parking garages downtown and ample parking in them. Many places are accessible by foot downtown, but unless you are adventurous, plan to drive from downtown to the outlet shopping area. For those averse to walking or driving, Petaluma Transit provides intercity transport during limited hours. Cycling is another very pleasant option around town.
