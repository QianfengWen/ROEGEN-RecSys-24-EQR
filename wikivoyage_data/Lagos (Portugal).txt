Not to be confused with Lagos of Nigeria.
Lagos is a city of 31,000 people (2011) in the Algarve, in the south of Portugal. It is dominated by up to 50 metre high limestone and sandstone cliffs. The city is located at the mouth of the Bensafrim river, and has a beautiful old town with narrow streets and many pubs and restaurants.


Understand[edit]
The historic centre of Lagos

The settlement history of the region around Lagos (LAH-goosh, /ˈɫa.guʃ/) goes back to the Neolithic Age. Evidence for this can be found in the numerous menhirs, such as the Menir da Cabeça do Rochedo.
In the 15th and 16th centuries, the port of Lagos was the starting point for numerous expeditions. A slave market developed in the city. The slaves were transported to Portugal from the Nigerian city of Lagos.
During an earthquake in 1755, the city was devastated by a huge tidal wave.
Today the small town of Lagos is a district town, the district of Lagos also includes the smaller towns of Bensafrim, Luz and Odiaxere. Typical for this "rocky Algarve" are strong waves and strong winds coming from the Atlantic from the west.

Get in[edit]

By plane[edit]
The nearest airport is Faro (FAO IATA), about 75 km from Lagos. Or you fly to Lisbon.

By bus[edit]
37.10718-8.676351 Bus station
Both intercity buses and regional buses go to the bus station.
From several cities like Lisbon, Faro and Porto intercity buses operate to the town.

By train[edit]
37.1082-8.67142 Train station
To get to Lagos by train from Lisboa, take the train to Faro and get off in Tunes, a few stops before Faro. Then take the train to Lagos. The schedules are timed so that you only have to wait a few minutes.

By car[edit]
To get to Lagos from Faro – to where many fly in from all over Europe -  you take the A22 and it's about a 1-hour drive (rather fast). You also can take the 125 west, the older road, that takes you through about half of the western Algarve. The 125 brings you closer to some of the interesting towns and villages of the Western Algarve. These include Albufeira, Carvoeiro, Ferragudo, Porches — with the famous Porches Pottery — Alvor, Praia da Rocha, and then Lagos.
From Sagres (pronounced Sagresh) almost the most Western point in the Algarve you take the 125 east and drive through Salema, Burgau and Luz (pronounced Loosh). These small towns are beach communities that are undergoing massive construction to house retirees from the UK and Germany and to a lesser extent from the rest of Europe. English is very common although the number of Americans is small. The drive takes about 30 minutes at reasonable speed.

Get around[edit]

Lagos is a small city; you can pretty much walk everywhere. Walk to the beautiful sandy golden beaches.
The schedules and prices of city buses are included in Google Maps. Tickets can be bought inside the bus. E-hailing is available by Bolt and Uber; other taxis are abundant.
A reasonable way to move along the main attractions is using the tourist hop-on/hop-off train, which completes round-trip around the city in about an hour. One ride is €4 and a day ticket €5 (Jan 2024).


See[edit]
There is a great variety of things to see; The city centre is sculpted with traditional architecture and colours from the region. Beaches vary in shape and style from long sandy beaches to almost private ones hidden by cliffs. Ponta da Piedade is a beautiful spot with a nice lighthouse from where you can make boat tours to the natural caves. The harbour in the morning is full of activity, if you like to wake up early don't miss it. Also the fish market is an interesting spot.
The old town and the small beaches around Lagos are worth seeing. You should also see the cliffs, either on foot from the cliff path or from the boat. The old fortress at the port entrance is also worth seeing. An exhibition is housed inside.

37.099017-8.66831 Forte da Ponta da Bandeira. Coastal fortification to control the entrance to the port.   
37.099607-8.6713852 Igreja de Santo António.

There is a small bone chapel on the side of this church, and one of several in the Algarve region (others at Faro and Alcantarilha).

Do[edit]
Lagos Beach
Lagos has things to do for just about anyone, from the relaxing beaches to the exciting dolphin tours.

 The Mountain Bike Adventure, Rua Porta Da Vila. The Mountain Bike Adventure provides all types of guided mountain bike rides in the Algarve. All the guides are qualified mountain bike instructors and they have rides to suit every level and fitness. One of the most popular being a ride starting at the highest point of the Algarve (902 m) and descending nearly to sea level. They also provide a shuttle service on the mountain for the brave. From €30. 
37.145172-8.7663481 Zoo de Lagos. A smaller zoo around 10km off the city.  
Beaches[edit]
There is the 37.09769-8.667972 Praia da Batata in Lagos (right across the main road) which is an absolutely beautiful location. Walking along Estr. da Ponta da Piedade a few hundred metres before the lighthouse (after passing a café and Camila beach on your left), find a concrete fencepost on your right decorated with a spray-painted eye, mouth, and two teeth. Enter the path it marks, which will take you to the edge of the cliff. A bit north (to your right) there is a cove accessible only by boat or by a rather narrow hidden mud slope with a rope pegged to the top. There are a number of beautiful, although perhaps dangerous, walks along the top of the cliffs.
Another fantastic beach is 37.1094-8.66193 Meia Praia, just the other side of the Marina. It is a huge beach with a variety of beach bars to cool off in, and widely renowned as one of the best beaches in the Algarve.

Water activities[edit]
One of the more popular events in Lagos are the Dolphin Tours, with 3 companies offering tours to see dolphins. Whilst you might be unlucky and not see a dolphin, it's still worth it if you've ever wanted a ride on a high powered boat. All 3 of the companies are based in the Lagos Marina.

Sea kayaks can be rented during the summer from quite a few different locations.
Boat tours of the grottos leave from the harbour, and cost €10 per person. The grotto tours offered at the port are overpriced. If you go to the Farol da Ponta da Piedade lighthouse west of the city and then go down about 200 steps on the cliffs, so you come to a small pier where fishermen wait for passengers. For €20 per person you can take a 30-minute cave tour to Ponta da Piedade.
Vehicles[edit]
There are companies within Lagos that offer rentals of buggies and bikes, for a more exciting drive around town and a breathtaking way to take in the wonderful scenery of South West Portugal.
See Portimão for the Formula One racetrack to the north.

Buy[edit]
Southern Portugal is famous for its ceramics, and Lagos won't let you down. Ceramic dishes and tiles of all price ranges, styles, and colors are available. Some stores don't provide boxes for your goods, only newspaper wrapping, so ask before you buy, if it matters to you.
Portugal is also famous for its cork, in fact it's one of the largest cork producing countries on Earth. A short walk through almost any section of the town will reveal shops selling all kinds of cork products, from the usual coasters and placemats, right up to shoes, hats and handbags. Just as a note though, cork can be very expensive.
There is sometimes a small fair in front of the church near the harbor where unique clothing can be bought.

37.104208-8.6730871 Mercado Municipal, Avenida dos Descobrimentos. M-Sa, closed Sa afternoon and Su. The beautiful market hall from 1924, which has been modernized, offers fresh fish and seafood, among other things. (updated Feb 2021)
Eat[edit]
There are some wonderful family run operations in Lagos. Many of the restaurants are starving for business in the off peak time and will go way out of their way to make your visit to their restaurant a pleasurable experience. A regional speciality is chicken piri piri, barbecued chicken with the now famous piri piri sauce, truly delicious! Another local dish is the salted cod, which allegedly had 365 ways of being served, one for each day of the year. The sardines in the Algarve are of the best in the world and local people cook them on small barbecues on their doorsteps, creating a delicious smell which wafts through the streets!
Some restaurants get really busy that reservations are required several days in advance to get in when you want to. However, this generally applies to the best restaurants in Lagos and is a good sign of the restaurant's popularity, plus it ensures that you avoid disappointment.

Splurge[edit]

For a drink what packs a punch, try the traditional Algarve drink, Medronho, better known as fire water, another Algarve drink is the almond liqueur, delicious after a big meal!

Sleep[edit]
There is a large youth hostel in the centre of the city. However, if you arrive in Lagos by bus there will usually be people there asking if you need accommodation. These are generally cheap and small, and a great option. There is a campsite near where the N125 crosses Estr. da Ponta da Piedade

Beaches are clothing optional, but most people are clothed.

Beaches of Salema and Luz, both outside the city.
Monchique town/spa(mountain).
City of Silves (moorish castle).
Portimão
