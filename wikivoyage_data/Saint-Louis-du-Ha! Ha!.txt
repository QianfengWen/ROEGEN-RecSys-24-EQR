Understand!![edit]
Winter view of Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha!
Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha! is an agricultural village of 1300 people (2011), rivals Wawa (a former mining town in northwestern Ontario named with an Indigenous word for "goose") as an example of a tiny place with a ridiculous-sounding name. It is the only town in the world with two exclamation marks in its name.
"Ha! Ha!" refers to nearby Lake Témiscouata, haha here being an archaic French word for an unexpected obstacle or abruptly ending path.
Most traffic from the Maritimes and Atlantic Canada must pass through the narrow Edmundston-Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha!-Rivière-du-Loup highway to reach the other regions of Canada. There is one alternate route, an equally-narrow road from New Brunswick through Amqui to Rimouski, but the Trans-Canada mainline is the more direct route.

Get in!![edit]
By car!! [edit]
Autoroute 85 is part of the Trans-Canada Highway. It connects from Rivière-du-Loup in the north, and the New Brunswick provincial border in the south.  In New Brunswick, the highway is named Route 2, and continues to Edmundston.
