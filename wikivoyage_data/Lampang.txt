Lampang (ลำปาง), also known as Nakhon Lampang (นครลำปาง), is a city in the river valleys of Northern Thailand.


Understand[edit]
Lampang, in the Wang River basin, has been occupied by various civilisations, including Hariphunchai, Lanna, and Burmese, for more than 1,000 years and has a rich archaeological record. It is also known for its nostalgic local transport: horse-drawn carriages, rather than tuk-tuks.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Lampang Airport (LPT) is served by three daily turboprop (ATR72) flights by Bangkok Airways from Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK) taking 1½ hours (2000 baht and up, departures 08:20, 12:40, 16:25 daily), as well as by one flight by Nok Air on newer and larger Bombardier Q400 turboprops from Don Mueang International Airport at 17:20 daily (fares from 1750 baht, October 2022).
Another option is to take a low-cost flight (Air Asia, Nok Air, Thai Lion Air) to Chiang Mai, then connect to Lampang by bus or train. But it is at least two hours by road from Chiang Mai to Lampang, plus you'll need to connect from the airport to the bus or train station across the city.

Lampang Airport
By train[edit]
The Northern railway line from Bangkok to Chiang Mai passes through Lampang. As such, there are several trains in either direction every day. The journey from Bangkok takes 10-12 hours; 2nd class air-con sleeper ticket costs 734-804 baht, air-con seat car is 574 baht. 2nd class fan sleeper is 150-200 baht cheaper than air-con.
From Chiang Mai, the trip takes around 2 hours. Express fan car tickets are 23 baht. Air-con car tickets are just over 100 baht.

By bus[edit]
Many buses run from Bangkok's Mo Chit terminal, most of which continue on to Chiang Mai. First-class air-con bus ticket costs around 400-450 baht, the trip takes 8-9 hours (as such, overnight buses are recommended).
From Chiang Mai (Arcade bus station), buses are very frequent, and it takes 1-1½ hours to get to Lampang. The price is 40-90 baht, depending on the class (first class air-con bus costs 90 baht)
Finally, many buses going from Chiang Mai to various other destinations in central and northeast Thailand stop in Lampang, so it is pretty well connected.

By car[edit]
From Bangkok take Highway 32 to Nakhon Sawan. then Highway 1 via Kamphaeng Phet and Tak to Lampang. Distance from Bangkok is 600 km.

Get around[edit]
There are no tuk-tuks, so either use the horse-drawn carriages or the songthaews, which can be hired like a tuk-tuk. If it is not on a fixed route, ask the driver for a price but ensure that you both understand whether the price is for the trip or per person. Renting a scooter on the road of the bus terminal is quite expensive (400 baht, Jan 2020).
