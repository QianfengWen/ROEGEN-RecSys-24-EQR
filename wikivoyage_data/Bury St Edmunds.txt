Bury St Edmunds, or simply Bury, is a historic market town of 40,000 people (2011) in the county of Suffolk, in England. The town's medieval heritage is still visible in much of the street plan of the town centre which has not changed in 1000 years. Bury is also famous for its floral displays, and  has won many awards for these, including the prestigious 'Nations in Bloom' title, contested by towns and cities worldwide.


Understand[edit]
The Corn Exchange in Bury St Edmunds
Because of its position at the "crossroads of East Anglia" (as the town is known), Bury is a popular base for exploring the whole of this region of England. It is not a large town, so it is easy to explore on a day trip or a relaxing weekend or short break; however it is within easy range of many interesting locations such as Newmarket, Cambridge, Lavenham, Long Melford, Norwich and the Suffolk and Norfolk coastlines, so it is frequently used as a base for a longer holiday.

History[edit]
At the very centre of East Anglia, the town was established by the Saxons in the 10th century, and its growth was focused around the Abbey of St Edmund. The Abbey grew to become the fourth-largest monastery in Europe and an important site of pilgrimage prior to its dissolution in 1539, since when it became a source of quarry stone for local builders, such that only remnants remain. Today the ruins of the Abbey form part of the Abbey Gardens, a pleasant public park.
The town developed significantly after the dissolution of the Abbey through wealth from agriculture which has always been abundant in West Suffolk. Most of the buildings in the "historic core" of the town are timber-framed Medieval buildings hidden behind brick Georgian fronts, added as symbols of status by wealthy merchants at that time. Some of the grander public buildings — for example the Robert Adam art gallery, which was built as the Corn Exchange, and its Victorian counterpart — reflect directly the agricultural heritage of the area. This heritage continues with the presence of the Greene King brewery in the centre of the town and a large British Sugar factory on the outskirts. The town has always been famous for its markets: it used to host a twice-weekly provisions market and a weekly cattle market, but now has just the provisions market.

Drink[edit]
There are lots of bars, clubs and pubs in Bury; it certainly punches above its weight given its size. Many premises have late licences with some bars, clubs and pubs serving until 1AM on weekdays and until 3AM on Fridays and Saturdays. Bar 3, Benson Blakes, Hide Bar, Karooze, Bar Ambition and So Bar provide a fairly relaxed night out and are a welcome alternative to the two main nightclubs (Brazilias and Deja Vu) which are over-priced and tacky by comparison. Ruin is a night club and cocktail bar. The cheapest pub in and around the town centre is certainly The Grapes, which is open until 2AM on Fridays and Saturdays.
