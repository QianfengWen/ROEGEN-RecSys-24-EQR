Plaza in Tlaxco
Tlaxco is a town in the northern part of Tlaxcala, Mexico. The town was selected as one of Mexico's Pueblos Magicos for its scenic setting, lying between mountains, forests, and plains covered with maguey. It is noted for its churches and haciendas.


Understand[edit]
Small groups of Haustec and Otomi settled in the local area from 900 AD onwards, but didn't establish a permanent city at Tlaxco. Early Spanish settlers ignored Tlaxco and it wasn't until 1614 that Franciscan monks established a permanent presence. The town grew slowly but steadily to the status of municipality by 1866, and eventually to a population of 14,806 people (2010 census).
The town prides itself for its pulque and bulls.
