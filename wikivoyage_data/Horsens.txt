Horsens is a city in eastern Jutland with a population of around 61,000 (2021). Horsens is a port town at the end of a beautiful long shallow-water inlet. Such inlets are known as fjords in Denmark and there are several of them on the East Jutland coast. Horsens fjord is typical, with rolling hills and forests stretching all the way down to the water and making the city feel less like a coastal town. The larger city of Vejle south of Horsens also sits at the bottom of a Danish fjord.
Horsens has a pedestrianised centre with historic buildings, cafés, restaurants and opportunities for specialty shopping, and the inner city is dotted with art installations. The local tourist office is at Søndergade 28.
Horsens is an old town. Already during the Viking age it was a settlement called Horsens. The name probably referred to the breeding of a large numbers of horses in the area.

Go next[edit]
View across Horsens Fjord and Alrø
Endelave. Take the bus to the small town of Snaptun and then the 1-hour ferry to the island of Endelave. A beautiful and varied nature experience with plenty of opportunity for leisurely beach activities. Bring a bike or rent one on the island and you can see Endelave in a day or two. Do this as a day trip or stay overnight for a mini-vacation. Bird tours and nature walks are regularly arranged. Several options for sleeping and dining.
Hjarnø[dead link]. Another small and very flat island nearby, situated at Horsens fjord. Take the short seven-minute ferry trip there from Snaptun. Hjarnø has around 100 habitants and has a history of long-distance seafaring. Nowadays most people there either work regular jobs on the mainland or are active as farmers on the island. A small group of them are experimenting with wineproduction, a rare sight in Denmark. A haven for seabirds and with opportunities for a small nature hike experience, just follow the marked routes, and some leisurely beach activities as well. Several stone settings from The Viking Age. Do Hjarnø in a day or stay overnight at the camping grounds. You can eat at a café in the old smithy or bring your own food.
Alrø. Small flat island just north of Hjarnø, also in Horsens fjord. Twice as large and a bit higher than Hjarnø, Alrø rises a mere 15 metres above sea level on its highest spot. In the summer months there is a ferry connection from Snaptun, but Alrø can also be accessed from an artificial landbridge on the northern side. The landbridge can be reached in about a 30-minute drive from Horsens or Skanderborg; c. 40 minutes from Aarhus. This drive can be combined with a good nature experience in and around Sondrup Bakker, a beautiful area on the northern shores of Horsens fjord. Alrø is a bit similar to Hjarnø; it has a rich bird life and nearly all of it is cultivated land. Bird tours are regularly arranged, as are small canoe trips. Several options for dining and staying overnight.
The city of Aarhus can be reached by intercity trains within 30 mins while the town of Vejle is about 15 minutes away by train in the opposite direction, towards Copenhagen.
