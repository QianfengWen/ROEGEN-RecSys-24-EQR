Cardiff (Welsh: Caerdydd) is the capital and largest city of Wales. It used to be an industrial city, but is now a lively and modern capital city and a tourism hot spot. The city is friendly to pedestrians, and summer is by far the best time to visit, with large festivals, and outdoor dining and drinking.
The city centre has been intensely developed in the 21st century, and is now considered to be one of the top ten shopping destinations in the United Kingdom. Cardiff is a green city, and this is complemented by Bute Park which sits in the heart of the city. It has a reputation as a city of castles, having 5 of them within its surroundings. As of 2023, the city's population stands at roughly 360,000, with 1.1 million living in the metropolitan area. 


Understand[edit]
Cardiff is on the south coast of the South Wales plain, with a shoreline on the Bristol Channel. It lies at the mouth of three rivers: the Taff, the Ely and the Rhymney, with the Taff flowing through the city centre and all three reaching the sea at Cardiff Bay.  Cardiff is quite a flat city, a characteristic that helped it become one of the world's leading ports for the transport of coal from the rugged south Wales Valleys.
Around 12% of the residents of Cardiff speak some Welsh, and all public signs in the city are in both Welsh and English.  However, as elsewhere in Wales, English is universally understood.

 Visit Cardiff, Cardiff Castle, Castle St. Mar-Oct: M-F 10AM-5PM, Sa Su 9AM-5PM; Nov-Feb: M-F 10AM-4PM, Sa Su 9AM-4PM. The Visitor Information Point hosts a variety of literature including brochures, flyers and maps. (updated Jan 2024)
City[edit]
Cardiff's city centre is in the southern portion of the city just north of Cardiff Bay. It is traditionally centred at the castle, bounded to the north by the historic civic centre, large Bute park arboretum and university buildings, by the River Taff to the west, and by the Valleys and National rail lines to the east and south respectively. Growth is pushing the city centre beyond these boundaries, especially in regard to commercial office and residential provision. In particular, the area south of the original city centre towards and including Cardiff Bay has been almost completely redeveloped.
A unique feature of the city is its friendly local population; you can strike up a conversation with almost anyone you meet and speak as if old friends, whether on the bus or in the queue to buy something in a shop. These brief friendly interactions throughout the day make Cardiff an ideal city for lone travellers. The city has a long history of inter-racial marriages and a thriving gay scene making it one of the most welcoming and tolerant cities in the UK.
Cardiff is popular for location filming; Doctor Who has been made here since 2005, and Casualty since 2011. It also has a rich musical history, being the site of many escapades by the famous bands of the Welsh indie music movement such as Catatonia, Super Furry Animals and the Stereophonics. The stunning St. John the Baptist church, gracing the centre of the city, is food for the soul and nearby the Rummer Tavern pub one of the oldest surviving in the city is food for the spirit. Cardiff is the venue of many football and rugby games due to the state-of-the-art stadiums, and Cardiff International Arena's many events such as Comic Con Wales. The Bay area is rich with bars and restaurants and is home to the famous Wales Millennium Centre where one can see anything from comedy to ballet and opera. 
Cardiff is a city of life and learning having a huge student population during term time. Many graduates choose to remain due to the friendly and inclusive nature of the city. 
It is possible to walk, bike or ride across Cardiff almost entirely via the parks: the Earl of Bute’s lasting legacy to the people of Cardiff. Summer days see the city parks fill with sun-worshippers and snow days see them fill with people playing and snowball fighting with each other!

History[edit]
Cardiff's history follows its castle, which has been occupied since the Romans created a fort on the river Taff over 2,000 years ago. The name 'Cardiff' may have come from 'Caer' = fort, on the 'Taff'.) The fort's original walls can still be seen highlighted around the base of Cardiff Castle's walls. In Medieval times the castle grew, and a small town spread from its south gate; the Medieval street pattern can still be seen around High Street. In the 15th century, the town was destroyed by the last great Welsh prince, Owain Glyndwr. Successive owners fortified the castle and the town timidly grew until the Industrial Revolution, when the 2nd Marquess of Bute built the Glamorganshire Canal to transport coal from the Welsh valleys through Cardiff's docks.
Combined with the later arrival of the railways, Cardiff's population exploded and the docks grew to become the largest coal-exporting port in the world. At its peak, the price of the world's coal was determined at Cardiff's Coal Exchange and the first ever £1,000,000 cheque was written here in 1901 (equivalent to £124,000,000 in 2020). Cardiff was the third largest port of the British Empire, resulting in Edward VII granting Cardiff city status in 1905. With the rise of the city's fortunes, the Marquis of Bute transformed Cardiff castle into a fairytale gothic palace. He also donated land to build the civic centre which contains the City Hall, National Museum, university and government buildings, all built in elaborate neo-classical Baroque styles out of white Portland stone.
The Marquis also commissioned the architect William Burges to design many public and residential buildings in a distinctive Gothic style - many are still visible in the city centre and the inner suburbs. Wales did not have a de jure capital until 1955, when Cardiff was chosen as the largest city. However, with the post-War decline of coal, the city's docks became increasingly abandoned, and in the 1990s the city's transformation began with the building of a barrage to stop the world's second-largest tidal range from revealing dirty mud flats, and creating what is today Europe's largest waterfront regeneration project.
The Bay today is a mixture of apartments, sport, leisure and culture and its success has also seen a rejuvenation of the city centre, where large-scale pedestrianisation and the massive St David's redevelopment in 2009 have created a vibrant city, combining the best of the old, sitting close to modern architecture and amenities. As for the Castle, it was handed over to the people of Cardiff and is now a major tourist, corporate and cultural attraction, an indication of where the city's future lies.

Profile[edit]
Cardiff has a strong sporting and cultural presence given that it is the capital city, and therefore plays host to most Welsh sporting events, especially since the opening of the Millennium Stadium in the city centre. One of the city's charms is when it plays host to matches, the city centre atmosphere can be extraordinary, being swelled by 75,000 attendees and thousands of revellers.
Cardiff used to be quite a gritty city with the port and industry playing a huge role — Cardiff's ports were once among the most important in the world. Notable milestones were when Cardiff Bay (sometimes called Tiger Bay) was the first area of modern Britain to be thought of as a multicultural area given the huge part immigrants played in the city's ports.  The area is still home to one of the oldest and largest expatriate Somali communities in the world.  The world's first 'million-pound' deal was also signed at the Bay's own Coal Exchange building.
The city has moved away from its industrial past, however, and has been transformed by developments such as Cardiff Bay, which now hosts famous and striking landmarks such as the National Assembly for Wales and the spectacular Wales Millennium Centre. Massive investments have also been made throughout other parts of the city, such as the opening of the Millennium Stadium and the massive Saint David's shopping centre.

When to go[edit]
Cardiff is best to visit during late spring to early autumn as the warm weather adds to the city's pleasures and allows maximum experience of all the sites and areas of the city. Although the city usually benefits from mild weather all year round, like much of Wales it also receives substantial rainfall, especially in winter.
Being close to the sea and having a comparatively mild climate compared to other parts of England and Wales it also avoids much of the snowfall seen in other parts of the country in winter.

In the 19th century, it was the one of the homes of the Marquis of Bute. The Norman fort in the centre, the Welsh regimental museum and excavated Roman ruins are open, and tours of the Bute household are available. The Bute part of the castle is quite amazing. The interior was all done in the early 1900s in a very idiosyncratic and interesting style. There is barely an inch that is not adorned with some sort of artistic work. Yet, it is not overwhelming. The craftsmanship is well worth a look. Adult £14.50, child (age 5–16, with an adult) £10.00, senior/student/disabled (single carer free with each disabled ticket) £12.00, family ticket (2 adults and 2 children) £39.00, under 5s ree.

The cathedral school was where the famed children's author Roald Dahl was educated in the early part of his primary school life. The surrounding village is an interesting place to explore with a local coal magnate's house (Insole Court) donated to the people of Cardiff and open for visitors.

Do[edit]
Mermaid Quay in Cardiff Bay
Relax in Bute Park or in the grounds of the castle, for a break from the hustle of the city centre.
Visit Cardiff Bay a truly cosmopolitan experience full of restaurants, bars and cafes. A good place for a 'passeggiata' on a Sunday afternoon. Boat rides in the Bay (permanently water-filled since the barrage was built), a few shops, and a children's playground at the far end (near the historic Norwegian church) along with beautiful views across to Penarth.
Take a speed boat ride as it makes 360-degree turns in the water at 70 mph.
Walk along the bay from Mermaid quay to the barrage (near Penarth) to see for yourself how the water comes into the harbour from the sea. It is a 2 km walk with the harbour on one side of the path and the sea on the other. If you don't feel like walking you can hire a bicycle (you will come across the rental company on the way) or take a ride on the road train.
Penarth pier, Flat Holm and Steep Holm islands
At near-by Penarth, cruise the Bristol channel during summer months to the likes of North Devon, Gower Peninsula and even occasionally Pembrokeshire on the paddle steamers Balmoral and Waverly. Penarth to Ilfracombe is particularly spectacular, taking in the massive cliffs of North Devon.
Next to Cardiff Airport, Barry is a port-town, which has a theme park, casino and heritage railway. With the closure of the docks, it has attracted more attention thanks to a beautiful beach and a popular BBC series, called Gavin & Stacey. The amusement park on Barry Island contains several funrides.
Go on the Taff Trail, some of the sights close to the city centre are breathtaking and the tranquility offers a great contrast to the busy city centre.
Go to the Brecon Beacons. 40 minutes drive from Cardiff, this Welsh National Park is a scenic retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city, offering activities such as climbing, paragliding, sailing and many more.

Buy[edit]
Royal Arcade, one of 8 unique Victorian arcades in the centre, popular for independent shops, cafes and souvenirs
Nicknamed the City of Arcades, Cardiff is great place for shopping in style and the Victorian arcades are worth a visit in themselves. They have lots of little shops, food markets, etc. Up-market home stores include Banana Custard (for kids).
Queen St, St Mary's Street and The Hayes are the major pedestrianised shopping streets which all branch off the castle, so it is easy to walk from shop to shop without fear of traffic. Queen Street has most of the usual lineup of Marks and Spencer, Topshop and River Island. The Hayes has been refurbished along with the massive St David's Shopping Centre that has drawn in a few big names such as Hugo Boss and the biggest John Lewis outside of London. St Marys street, the original shopping street of Cardiff has gradually declined, firstly after Queen Street was pedestrianised when the street saw a shift towards restaurants, bars and clubs, and then during the councils year long trial of closing the street to traffic. St Mary's Street is now pedestrianised for most of its length, with work still ongoing but it's worth a look as most of the city's grandest buildings are along its length with the large and oldest department store in Wales (Howells by House of Frasier), imposing entrance to the Central Market and elaborate entrances to the arcades being particular high points.

51.479-3.1751 The Hayes. This area in the southern city centre underwent a massive transformation in the 2010s, which included the construction of the £675-million St Davids shopping centre extension, and the largest John Lewis department store outside of London. A new public library was built at the opposite end of the street to the original library, which is now a museum about Cardiff known as the 'Old Library'. Here modern architecture contrasts beautifully with the historic shops and arcades on the opposite side of the street, which has quickly become the cities higher end of the market shopping street.   (updated Apr 2020)
51.4801-3.17872 Central Market, St Mary Street. Established in 1891, the market has an eclectic collection of stalls: arts, crafts, food, souvenirs, and even pets. A highlight is the small bakery with various flavours of fresh, inexpensive Welsh cakes (including vegan options).   (updated Mar 2022)
Queen Street, St. Mary's Street and  The Hayes are the main shopping streets in Cardiff city centre. Queen Street houses the likes of Marks and Spencer, Boots and many other stores with entrances to the modern St Davids and Queens Arcade shopping centres, which also have entrances on the Hayes. Combine the old St Davids shopping centre, larger modern extension, John Lewis and Queens arcade and they make up one of the largest indoor shopping centres in the UK. St. Marys Street is home to a large 'Howells' or House of Fraser store, numerous arcades that house one-off shops with many of the arcades having entrances on the Hayes.
There are many tourist-oriented shops in front of the Castle and inside the Arcades so have a look around where you can find many Welsh souvenirs and gifts there.
Fish from Ashton's stall in the atmospheric indoor market, off the Hayes, Church Street or St Mary St.
Cheese from Madame Fromage in the Castle Arcade.
Music from Spillers Records, the oldest record shop in the world, is in the Morgan Arcade. In addition to selling music, it is the city's main location for buying tickets for alternative music concerts. Spillers was founded in 1894 by Henry Spiller at its original location in Queen’s Arcade.
Eat[edit]
It can be very difficult to book a table in the better restaurants on a Friday or Saturday evening. As a rule of thumb Mermaid Quay and the city centre are jam packed full with a varied contrast of eateries allowing you to experience many different tastes within a small area.
Vegetarian options are easy to find, and vegan options reasonably so.
In the centre see Cafe Minuet (Marcello's) in Castle Arcade, The Potted Pig [dead link] on High Street. In Riverside try Madhav's for unusual vegetarian Indian food. In the Bay avoid all the chains at Mermaid Quay and look at Mr G's Soul Kitchen for Caribbean. In Canton try La Cuina (Catalan food) on Kings Road. Head to City Road for a massive variety of world cuisines.

Stay safe[edit]
Cardiff is quite a safe city, and certainly safer than most other major cities in the UK, with the centre having less overall crime than much smaller cities like Gloucester, Northampton and Derby, and far less than in the centre of London, Birmingham, Liverpool or Leeds. However, Cardiff has a relatively high rate of car theft crime rates. Make sure you remove all valuables from your vehicle, especially from show; and don't park at night in badly-lit streets in inner-city neighbourhoods such as Adamsdown, Splott, Riverside or Butetown. If you do need to leave a car overnight, several of the city-centre car parks offer cheap rates for all-night parking and are completely safe.  Cardiff seems not to be plagued with a prominent red light district akin to many of the similarly-sized cities in England. However, areas such as Ocean Way in Adamsdown may be wise to avoid in the nights and early evenings in winter, as the area is known for prostitution. Anyone caught curb crawling is likely to be stopped and questioned by police, although more often than not, you will just be told to move on.
Alcohol-related violence is common in parts of Cardiff, especially on the weekends in the clubs and bars concentrated around St Mary Street and Greyfriars Road, so take extra caution to avoid offending anyone. (Cardiff Bay is usually less raucous at these times and attracts much less trouble.) In addition, as in any city, there are areas to avoid after dark: again, these include Adamsdown, Splott, Butetown, and the southern half of Riverside.  Bute Park is largely unlit at night so also best avoided.

The Vale of Glamorgan, to the southwest of Cardiff contains the Victorian seaside towns of Penarth and Barry. Cowbridge is a picturesque town to the west. St Donat's Castle is one such attraction, a well-preserved 15th C. fortified house, with additions over the centuries. Fonmon Castle is also impressive, while ruined Ogmore has a lovely setting. Comeston Lakes is another beautiful place, with a well maintained country park.
The superb Glamorgan Heritage Coast, around 10 mi west of Cardiff, stretching from Llantwit Major to Ogmore-by-Sea, the majestic liassic/carboniferous cliffs provide sparkling views across the Bristol channel, and the small little back roads (particularly the road to ogmore-by-sea) provide some of the most spectacular driving routes in Wales.
Penarth - A Victorian seaside resort, now a suburb south of Cardiff. Known as "the Garden by the Sea”, it has a beautiful, historic pier. And Cosmeston Medieval Village, a "living history" medieval village in nearby Lavernock.
The Brecon Beacons and the town of Brecon are to the north.
Try taking the train to Newport, and then a bus to Caerleon and visiting the Roman amphitheatre there. It is quite well preserved and gives a real feel for how the Romans would have used the space.
It is possible to visit Hereford as a day trip, using either train or car.
Chepstow and Tintern, attractive ancient towns with staggering stone ruins on the border with England
