“

Ludlow....is probably the loveliest town in England with its hill of Georgian houses ascending from the river Teme to the great tower of the cross-shaped church, rising behind a classic market building.

”


—Sir John Betjeman, 1943

Ludlow is a town of 10,000 people (2011) in Shropshire. It is a typical English market town with a castle. The historic centre of Ludlow has largely escaped development that would otherwise alter its medieval, Tudor and Georgian character.  Ludlow has nearly 500 listed buildings, including examples of medieval and Tudor-style half-timbered buildings.


Understand[edit]
Ludlow Castle
The oldest part of Ludlow is the medieval walled town, founded in the late 11th century after the Norman conquest of England. It is centred on a small hill which lies on the eastern bank of a bend of the River Teme. Situated on this hill are Ludlow Castle and the parish church, St Laurence's, the largest in the county. From there the streets slope downward to the rivers Corve and Teme, to the north and south respectively. The town is in a sheltered spot beneath Mortimer Forest and the Clee Hills, which are clearly visible from the town.

Ludlow is quite small, and its centre consists of medieval streets, so getting around by foot is suggested, although to visit many of the surrounding areas of beauty and villages, a car will be necessary, as public transport in rural England is generally sporadic.
The town centre is situated on a small hill, but once you're there it's largely flat ground. Parking fees apply every day at these car parks and also on-street in the centre. Parking is free between 6PM and 8AM, and on bank/public holidays.
