History[edit]
In Indigenous prehistory, as well as in the history of New France and the English regime, Grande-Île was recognized as strategically well positioned on the St. Lawrence River. In 1795, the Great Island became the property of Alexander Ellice, a merchant in Great Britain. Located near Pointe-du-Lac, one of the old names of Valleyfield given by French explorers, the site of Grande Île became strategically important in 1812 during the war between England and the United States.
During this period of military activities, the British government had the site of Grande-Île fortified. Thus, in 1813, the construction of a redoubt was carried out under the colonel of the militia and lord of Vaudreuil, Michel Eustache Gaspard Alain Chartier de Lotbinière, at Pointe-aux-Anglais. The infrastructure built in the form of a landing stage consisted of a chain passing from edge to edge of the bay in order to close the entrance. In fact, the most notable contribution of Colonel de Lotbinière, was to build a road across the width of the island so as to quickly reach Coteau-du-Lac on the north shore of the river. This road became Boulevard Grande-Île.
Salaberry was named after Colonel Charles de Salaberry who served with the British Army during the War of 1812. "Valleyfield" came from the Valleyfield Mills, a paper mill south of Edinburgh in Scotland.
