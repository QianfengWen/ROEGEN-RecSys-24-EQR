175 km from Tirana and approximately 40 km from Pogradec, Korça is the eighth most populated city in Albania. It is located in the south-eastern Albania and it stands 850 m above the sea level. It is full of life during the summer when you can find couples and families strolling through the city's main park, Parku Rinia. Besides strolling around the great city full of history and cultural sites, you can also hike to the top of the beautiful mountain Morava and view the city and its surrounding landscape.

40.61864920.7774541 Visit Korça Region Info Center, Shën Gjergji Boulevard, ☏ +355 8225 7803, +355 6720 34403, fax: +355 82 25 7803, info@visit-korca.com. Info center offers walking tours of the city, and skiing, hiking, and biking tours. 
Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
An interesting, though slow, way to get to Korça from Tirana is to take the train. The train leaves at 06:00 from Tiranë. Because the train makes a big detour via Durrës, it arrives no less than four hours later at Elbasan, about 35 km from Tiranë, so it should be possible to make a shortcut. The price is very favourable (295 lek). The second-hand German carriages are OK, though for some unclear reason all windows are damaged, apparently by bullets. The scenery is beautiful, and until October it is possible to have the window wide open.

By bus[edit]
Vans (furgons) to Tiranë depart every 20-30 min from the fork of the main road on the north.
Furgons to Voskopojë depart at 07:30, 10:00, 13:00, 15:00 from the fire station.
Buses going to Sarandë depart early in the morning from the 40.6185920.775521 central bus depot, across from bazaar.
From Korçë to Pogradec, it is a short trip by furgon. There is also a bus connection with Berat.

By car[edit]
The easiest way to arrive to Korça is by car. If you depart from Tirana, you can choose between 2 different ways, the old road and the new one, from the Elbasan Highway.
