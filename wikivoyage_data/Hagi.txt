Hagi (萩市 Hagi-shi)  is one of Japan's most beautiful castle towns, with many old streets and residences that have survived untouched in this town of 50,000 people (2016).


Understand[edit]
Hagi Castle Ruins under Mount Shizuki
The first castle in Hagi was built by the Yoshimi clan. But it was not until 1608 when the Mori clan, exiled here after a humiliating defeat by the Tokugawa shogunate, built their massive, imposing castle at the foot of Mt. Shizuki. The Mori clan transferred the capital of the Choshu Domain (Choshu-han) from Hiroshima to Hagi at the same time, where it remained the political center of the region for over 250 years.
In the middle of the 19th century, the Choshu allied with the Satsuma Domain to deliver some long-awaited payback, toppling the Tokugawa shogunate and thereby spurring the Meiji Restoration — and, with it, the modernizing of feudal Japan. Many Meiji statesmen were born and raised in Hagi, such as Hirobumi Ito, the first Japanese prime minister. In 2015, 5 sites in Hagi were registered as World Heritage Sites as part of the Sites of Japan's Meiji Industrial Revolution; Hagi Castle Town (the castle ruins and historic districts), Shokasonjuku Academy, Ohitayama-tatara Iron-Smelting Works, Ebisugahana Shipyard, and Hagi Reverberatory Furnace.

33.932951131.2750012 Yamaguchi Ube Airport (UBJ IATA) (from Ube, take a bus to Shin-Yamaguchi Station in Yamaguchi and connect via bus from there). The prefecture's largest airport, with regular flights to Haneda Airport in Tokyo on JAL and ANA (about 90 minutes). (updated Feb 2018)
By train[edit]
Map of Hagi
The closest Shinkansen station is Shin-Yamaguchi. Many Hikari and a few Nozomi trains stop there. The train link to Hagi from here is about 3 hours by limited express, but you can cut that in half by taking "Hagi-go" (はぎ号) bus to Hagi. It's run by Chugoku JR Bus.
If you want to take the train the full distance to Hagi, you'll want to take the Shinkansen to Asa station. Asa is only serviced by Kodama trains, and it is two stops from Shin-Yamaguchi and also two stops from Kokura, which is much more well serviced. From Asa take the Mine line to Nagatoshi (1 hour). Then take the San'in Line to Higashi-Hagi Station (half hour). You need to be careful to plan the connections well (both trains average about once every two hours), but if you do, this is about the same time as the bus from Shin-Yamaguchi.
If you like coastal scenery, you could also take the San'in line all the way from Shimonoseki, but this adds another hour.
The San'in Main Line runs around Hagi's main island. There are three stops in town: JR Higashi-Hagi Station (東萩駅), across the Matsumoto River to the east of the city center; JR Hagi Station (萩駅), a long walk to the south of the city center; and JR Tamae Station (玉江駅), a short walk south of the castle ruins and Mt. Shizuki.
Local rural trains are not particularly comfortable nor do they have air conditioning. On the other hand, people that have trouble with motion sickness will have problems with the winding mountain highways, especially the way they are driven by these buses.

By bus[edit]
34.410575131.4026163 Hagi Bus Center (萩バスセンター), 11-2 Karahimachi (in the city center), ☏ +81 838-22-3811. The city's main bus station. Buses run from Hiroshima (four hours), Umeda and Abeno-bashi in Osaka by Kintetsu (10 hours), and Shinagawa in Tokyo by Keikyu (14 hours). There are also direct buses from Kyoto and Kobe. Within the prefecture, there are buses to the bus center and Higashi-Hagi Station from Shin-Yamaguchi Station in Yamaguchi. (updated Feb 2018)
Get around[edit]
34°25′52″N 131°23′47″EMap of Hagi
The city center is on a delta between the Hashimoto River and the Matsumoto River. If you decide to walk, you're joining a long tradition — Hagi-Ōkan (萩往還), which connects Hagi and Yamaguchi City, was an important route during the Edo period, traveled frequently by merchants and samurai. It's now a popular trail for history-minded tourists.

By bus[edit]
The Hagi Junkan Maaru Bus (萩循環まぁーるバス) runs 07:00-19:00 to almost all of the tourist sights. There are stops throughout town, but the two routes — blue and red — cross paths at a few points, including the Hagi Bus Center in the center of town. There are departures every half-hour or so. Rides of any length cost only ¥100, or ¥500/700 for one/two day pass.
The blue buses cover the north, west, and northwest parts of the city, including JR Tamae Station, the castle ruins, and the Horiuchi, Jokamachi, and Teramachi areas. The red buses cover the south and northeast, including JR Higashi-Hagi Station, Daisho-in, and sites further out such as Kasayama and the Reverberating Furnace.

By bicycle[edit]
Most of the major sights can be easily reached by bicycle. You can rent one at several places around town, such as JR Higashi-Hagi Station and Hagi Castle.

Choshu Five
The Chōshū Five (長州五傑 Chōshū Goketsu) were members of the ruling class of the Chōshū-han. In 1863, they disguised themselves as English sailors and went to study in England at University College London, despite the policy of sakoku, which made leaving Japan illegal under penalty of death. Each went on to play a major role in the modernizing of Japan, and they remain heroes in Hagi today.

He and his army won a civil war in the Choshu Domain to oust supporters of the Tokugawa and fended off direct attempts by the Tokugawa to regain control with weapons he'd imported from abroad.
