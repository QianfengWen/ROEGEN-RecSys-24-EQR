Blountstown is the county seat of Calhoun County, West Florida.


Understand[edit]
Apalachicola River in Torreya State Park
John Blount, a chief of the Creek tribe, helped General Andrew Jackson (who would later become president) invade the Spanish Florida colony in 1818; Florida became part of the U.S. three years later. The city was seriously damaged by Hurricane Michael, which struck in fall 2018. At the time the hurricane was thought to be a Category 4, but it was later adjusted to Category 5 after a review. Blountstown had a population of 2,500 in 2010. The Calhoun Correctional Institution, southwest of the town, can hold over a thousand prisoners and maintains multiple security levels.
Bristol, a small town across the river, is included within this article of Blountstown, though the two towns are in different time zones. Blountstown is on the Central Time Zone while Bristol is on the Eastern Time Zone.

Climate[edit]
As is the case across northern Florida and the Panhandle, Blountstown and the surrounding rural areas have a humid "subtropical" climate, with cool winters and hot, humid summers. Rainfall is highest during the summer but can occur year-round.
