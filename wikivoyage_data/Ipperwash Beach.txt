History[edit]
The Ipperwash Crisis was an Indigenous land dispute that took place in what was then Ipperwash Provincial Park in 1995. Several members of the Stoney Point Chippewas (Anishnaabeg) band occupied the park in order to assert their claim to nearby land which had been expropriated from them during World War II. During a violent confrontation, the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) killed unarmed protester Dudley George. In 2009, ownership of the land in the park was transferred to the Chippewas of Kettle and Stony Point First Nation.
