Imperial Hotel Motel
The European explorer Allan Cunningham crossed the Gwydir River near Bingara in 1827. The first farms were established in the 1830s, and the discovery of gold in 1852 brought prospectors to the area. In the 1880s copper and diamonds were discovered. Bingara is the main centre of the Gwydir Shire Local Government Area.
