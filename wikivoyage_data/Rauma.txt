Rauma (Finnish) or Raumo (Swedish) is a town in Satakunta. The wooden houses in the center of the old town are a UNESCO World Heritage site, as is the Bronze Age burial site Sammallahdenmäki about 20 km east of downtown. Rauma is the third oldest town in Finland, and has almost 40,000 inhabitants (2023). It is a historic seafaring town but in the 20th century paper milling became its main industry. The Olkiluoto nuclear power plant in nearby Eurajoki municipality is a major regional employer.


Understand[edit]
Wooden houses along Kauppakatu in old Rauma
Rauma is one of the six medieval towns in Finland (with Naantali, Porvoo, Turku, Ulvila and Vyborg). It has a lot of seafaring history. It also developed a reputation for high quality lace. These traditions are actively being marketed by the tourism industry, though in day-to-day life they are no longer mainstream (except for the port operations, as Rauma is still a major port in Finland). Folk culture, tourism and older people try to preserve much of Rauma tradition, but as everywhere, Finland is gradually becoming homogenized due to the influence of mass media. Younger generations in Rauma these days hardly differ from those in most other Finnish cities.
The post-World War II years were mainly driven by pulp and paper milling, which cast its ugly (and sometimes smelly) shadow on the town. However, the wood industry also brought prosperity and compared to many other similarly sized towns, Rauma has done pretty well. Environmental impact (including the abovementioned smell) is now rather small due to modern technology. Most of the 'smoke' you see coming from the factory area (tucked into the outskirts of the town) is actually water vapour.
In its heyday, Rauma had two competing shipyards, which have been consolidated into one and are owned by STX (from S-Korea). Combined with the wood industry and other metal industry companies, Rauma really has a blue-collar history.
Because of the construction of the new nuclear power plant by a Franco-German company, there has been an influx of engineers and their families from Central Europe. This has contributed positively not only to the economy but also to the offerings of restaurants and cafés.
The neighbouring municipality of Lappi was merged into Rauma in 2009.

Tourist information[edit]
Visit Rauma
Talk[edit]
The locals are mainly Finnish speaking. Rauma has a peculiar dialect of its own. Rauma giäl ("Rauman kieli", or the language of Rauma) is characterized by a slightly more guttural intonation than standard Finnish. Its most extreme form is, however, mostly reserved for traditional folk events or touristic marketing. The day to day language is mostly standard Finnish mixed with some Rauma idioms, words and pronunciation. If you know Finnish, you'll understand practically everything. However, you may have to ask your interlocutor to speak slower, because the way of speech is also quicker and more verbose than in many other Finnish dialects.
As in most of Finland, anybody born since 1965 knows at least some English.

Get in[edit]
61°6′43″N 21°37′12″EMap of Rauma
By plane[edit]
The nearest airport, Pori airport POR IATA is located in the neighboring city of Pori. Another option is Turku airport (TKU IATA), which may have slightly better connections abroad. If you fly in from abroad, it may be quicker to fly to Helsinki (HEL IATA) and continue by bus or train than to wait for a connecting flight to Turku. Turku also has some international flights, most of them operated by Wizz Air.

By bus[edit]
Rauma is well connected to other cities by coach and most tourists arrive this way. The bus station (Linja-autoasema) is in the city centre. Coaches arrive every 1–3 hours except during the night, from e.g. Helsinki (3½ hr), Turku (1½ hr), Tampere (2½ hr), Vaasa and Oulu.
Coming via Tallinn or Stockholm, there may be coach connections from the ports of Helsinki with arranged transfer, mostly via Kamppi. Coming via Turku harbour, there may be a direct service from the ferry terminal to Rauma.
Timetables can be found on the website of Matkahuolto.

By train[edit]
There is no passenger rail traffic directly to Rauma. There are train stations in Harjavalta (48 km (30 mi)) Pori 50 km (31 mi)), Kokemäki 58 km (36 mi)), Turku 90 km (56 mi)) and Tampere 140 km (87 mi)), which, except perhaps Kokemäki and Harjavalta, have good coach connections to Rauma. Using the train may be faster than a direct coach service, depending on time of day and other factors.

By car[edit]
There are easy road connections to Helsinki (south via Huittinen, 242 km (150 mi)), Tampere (east via Huittinen, 145 km), Turku (south, 94 km) and Pori (north, 49 km). There are no roads going west since that way lies the sea. If you drive from Helsinki, you can also use the old route, via roads 1, 110, 280, 52, 10, 213, 204 and 12 (247 km (153 mi)).

By boat[edit]
There is no commercial passenger traffic by sea but many tourists, especially Finns, arrive in Rauma with their private yachts. There are a few guest harbours around Rauma.

Get around[edit]
Since Rauma is a small town, walking around the city, and especially the old town, is easy. Bringing your own bicycle would be convenient.
The local buses are by Koiviston Auto (timetables and route planner).
The bus system is extremely limited and services only the handful of most important routes. You'll find the main bus stop near the old town, at Savila. This is not the same as the intercity bus terminal which services the buses that go in and out of Rauma; there are a couple of blocks between the two bus stations.

By bike[edit]
Easybike[dead link] offers city bikes for rent.

Most of Rauma's sights are conveniently located within a walking distance of the centre.

Old Rauma[edit]
The old city hall
61.1289821.508221 Old Rauma (Vanha Rauma) is the largest uniform wooden town in the Nordic countries, and it was included on the  UNESCO World Heritage Site on the eve of the 550th anniversary of the city. The oldest inhabited buildings date back even to the 17th century. Some of the architecture may make you think you're in southern Sweden or Denmark (e.g. the city hall with its straight yellow walls and brick roof), or the Baltics (the wooden houses with their decorated details). Compared to the wooden old town of Porvoo, the streets are wider and the houses tidier but because of that it also seems less livelier/busier.

Archipelago of Rauma[edit]
The archipelago is not very extensive, still hundreds of islands and islets, several of which have some service for visitors. The Bothnian Sea National Park stretches along the coast, mostly in the sea off the archipelago, but including some of the islands. Many islands are protected as nature reserves or otherwise. In summer, when the weather is fine, the islands offer nice day trips.

61.1436921.302362 Kylmäpihlaja. An island with a lighthouse that operates as a hotel. 
61.137121.364893 Kuuskajaskari. A former military area that still has old 152-millimetre coastal artillery cannons. 
61.2041521.431244 Reksaari. Island groves can be seen here. 
In peak tourist season, there are regular boat connections to each of these islands. In most winters, it is also possible to walk, ski or skate over the frozen sea. Be sure to ask locals if the ice is thick enough, never embark alone, and avoid shipping routes with potentially thinner ice. There are few or no tourist services available on the islands during winter.

Churches[edit]

While a  UNESCO World Heritage Site of great archaeological significance ("The largest, most varied and complete burial site from the Scandinavian Bronze Age, 1500–500 B.C."), it's not all that much to look at, being composed of just 36 burial cairns – piles of stone of varying shapes and sizes. Six of the cairns are highlighted in the official tourist flyer and on the map at the entrance, and the most famous of them is probably Huilu ("flute"), a cairn over 20 m long and perhaps 2-3 m wide. Guided tours starting from the parking lot are available M–F in the summer peak season (June–August). Free, guiding €2/person.

You should check the dates from City of Rauma website. One of the nights is themed the Night of Black Lace (mustan pitsin yö), which starts as a cultural happening and usually degrades very quickly into a massive (on local scale) bar-crawling exercise.

Buy[edit]
In Old Rauma you can still find plenty of traditional lace on sale and at the main square you will find the seafarers' museum containing some impressive stuff. The old town also has shops selling for example second-hand goods and art. The newer parts of the city have more "everyday" shops and in the north of the city there are two hypermarkets next to each other (Prisma and Citymarket).

Eat[edit]
There are a couple of local foods which are borne of the seafaring past: lapskoussi (mashed potatoes and salted meat) and topseilvellinki (raisin soup, usually served with pancakes).

Budget[edit]
Budget choices are largely limited to fast food. In addition to McDonald's and its Finnish imitator Hesburger, Rauma has a bunch of pizza and kebab places, where a meal typically costs around €4.5-8.

Splurge[edit]
Drink[edit]
Rauma has its own drink, Puksprööt, made of juniper-rowan liqueur and white wine, served with a tar-infused rope. Some bars do not use juniper liqueur, in which case you might want to add some gin.
A common perception among young Raumans is that there is absolutely nothing to do in Rauma. This perception is shared to such a degree that if a Rauman teenager asks another if there's anything happening in Rauma, the other one starts outright laughing. As usual, teenagers have somewhat of an extremist view and also are not fully aware of all their options – still, there is some truth to their opinions. Rauma is not a happening party town. There are a couple of night club options and a number of seedy bars, and each usually has their own clientèle where everybody knows each other. It might be difficult to find a place that fits you in Rauma, and if you do, it might be difficult to get to know the people who already know each other.
Bars and clubs are concentrated in Old Rauma and west of Old Rauma. Main party days are Friday and Saturday, Wednesday coming as third.

Cafés[edit]
There are a number of nice cafés (kahvila) in the Old Rauma, some in the inner yards of the old wooden houses, sometimes with live music or art galleries - obviously patios are usually only open in summertime. The best option is to walk around and pick the one you like.
Cafés are typically Finnish-style. American style tall lattes are hard to come by, and surprisingly many offer light-roasted drip coffee only (no espresso). This is, however, slowly changing.
Some established cafés include

61.128821.519891 Café Sali, Kuninkaankatu 22, ☏ +358 10-4233161. Old Rauma. Sleek interior. Probably your best bet if you want a decent espresso based drink.

Clubs[edit]
