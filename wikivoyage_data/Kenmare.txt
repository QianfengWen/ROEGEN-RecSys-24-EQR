Kenmare is a village in County Kerry in southwest Ireland. It's at the head of Kenmare Bay: north of the bay is Iveragh Peninsula, and its coast road is the popular Ring of Kerry tourist route. South is Beara Peninsula, marking the boundary with County Cork. Kenmare's resident population (as of 2016) is 2376, but it has lots of tourist accommodation and other facilities and gets busy in summer.
Kenmare's Irish name is An Neidín, "the little nest". It was laid out as a planned town in 1670 by Sir William Petty, who'd been awarded the land by Cromwell for mapping Ireland. Subsequent landowners promoted tourism, which boomed once the railway reached Killarney in the 1850s. Kenmare also became famous for the lace sewn at its convent. 
The Tourist Information Centre is north side of the main square.

The closest airport is Kerry (KIR IATA), midway between Killarney and Tralee. It has limited flights and you might do better to fly into Dublin, Shannon or Cork.
Bus Éireann 270 runs from Killarney (the nearest railway station) via Glenfesk and Kilgarvan, taking 40 min to Kenmare. There are 3 M-F, 2 Sa Su; one bus M-Sa continues along the coast to Sneem.  
In July and Aug, Bus 282 runs a triangle across the hills to Beara Peninsula in County Cork. It runs in the morning from Kenmare to Glengarriff (45 min, for buses to Bantry) and Castletownbere, returning via Ardgroom, Laragh and Dawros back to Kenmare; then the reverse in the afternoon. Sept-June this bus only runs between Kenmare and Ardgroom once a week with no onward connections. 
By car from Dublin follow M8 to Fermoy then N72 west through Mallow to Killarney then N71 south through the National Park.

51.88-9.5831 The Square is the colourful centre of Kenmare, lined by pubs and shops along Henry St, Main St and Shelbourne St. Yes, it's a triangle. The TIC is at the north end. There isn't a civic art gallery in the village but lots of little private galleries and art shops.
Holy Cross Church (RC) just north on Railway Rd was completed in 1864 along with the Poor Clare's Convent adjacent. Here the nuns developed the techniques of needlework that made Kenmare lace famous. You can visit the church but the convent closed and became a school. The Poor Clares continue elsewhere, and you can see the legacy of their craft in the Lace and Design Centre, described below.

51.838-9.93 Sneem is a village west on N70 with a scenic inlet of the sea. Its name An tSnaidhm means "the knot", the explanation of which  depends entirely on which garrulous codger has bent your ear with the tale. Charles de Gaulle holidayed here, and it's the burial place of the fifth Irish President Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh (Carroll O'Daly, 1911 – 1978). There's accommodation and a golf course.
51.805-10.0164 Staigue Stone Fort is an Iron Age ringfort of circa 300-400 AD. It has sturdy drystone walls and an encircling ditch.

Ring of Kerry is the 214 km circuit of the Iveragh Peninsula, a comfortable day-trip by car or tour bus. Buses tour anti-clockwise so Kenmare comes near the end of their circuit, then they climb N71 over Moll's Gap to return to Killarney. Independent travellers starting from Kenmare are probably better going clockwise, though you'll have to dodge all the oncoming buses somewhere on the road beyond Waterville.
