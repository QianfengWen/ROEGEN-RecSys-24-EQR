Jekyll Islandis a large barrier island, which is part of the Golden Isles, in Coastal Georgia. With over 5 miles (8 km) of beaches and an unlimited number of outdoor activities, one of Georgia's most popular vacation destinations.


Understand[edit]

Jekyll Island's reputation as a vacation destination was prefaced by a time of status and prestige. For over four decades in the late 1800s, the island belonged exclusively to the renowned Jekyll Island Club – the winter retreat for some of the most elite families in America. The Morgans, Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, Pulitzers and several other families, reputed to hold over one-sixth of the world's wealth, established the Jekyll Island Club and built a group of large cottages along Jekyll Creek. Jekyll Island was sold to the state in 1947, five years after the club was closed.
It is now one of the largest ongoing restoration projects in the southeastern United States.

Stay safe[edit]
As it is a small town, Jekyll Island has quite a low crime rate. As always, use common sense and don't leave your valuables alone while enjoying the beach. At night, be careful of cars when traversing the roads due to the lighting regulations, and have reflectors of some kind if you are riding your bike at night. Also, like with many other beaches along the Atlantic Coast, there is the possibility of rip currents, so always check weather advisories and be sure to not walk too far into the water.  

Stay healthy[edit]
Make sure to bring water if you plan to be outside during the day, as the relative humidity ranges from an average of 60% in February to a muggy 80% in August. Sand flies are active on parts of the beach in the early morning, so cover skin and wear bug spray to avoid the painful bites they can cause.
