City Hall and Cenotaph, Barkers Pool
The original Steel City, Sheffield is one place most have heard of, but isn't usually on many travellers' bucket lists. If this is you, you're missing out. It's true, Yorkshire's second city has a bit of an image problem. Its cutlery may be in kitchen drawers the world over, but Sheffield hasn't necessarily reinvented itself in the way that other northern English cities have managed to do.
First-time visitors are more often than not surprised by what they find, however. Many remark on how they wish they'd discovered the place sooner, and wonder why nobody told them it was here.
Why? Sheffielders are too modest; they know their city is wonderful, but they won't tell you so, even though that means getting overlooked more often than not. When pushed, they might mumble something about metal and hills, but they won't tell you about their creative talents, or their museums and art galleries. If the locals mention the city's two universities, they won't brag about their size (30,000 students apiece) or successes (world leaders in industry, engineering and the sciences).
They certainly won't talk about the fact that Sheffield is England's National City of Sport, nor that it has a credible claim to being the real ale capital of the world, nor even that it is home to Britain's biggest and best theatre scene outside London. As for telling you how many trees Sheffield has (three times the number of people), or just how close it is to the Peak District (one third of the city lies within this national park, the UK's oldest), you can forget it. But now you're in the know, there can be no more excuses - you'll find there's plenty to discover in "England's largest village".

Orientation[edit]
Sheffield is one of the United Kingdom's biggest cities, with a population of 575,000, and around 1.6 million in the wider metropolitan area. The city lies in the most southerly part of Yorkshire, with Derbyshire to the west and south-west, Nottinghamshire to the south-east, and Lincolnshire not far to the east. The M1 motorway runs along the city's eastern boundary and separates Sheffield from neighbouring Rotherham. The beautiful Peak District National Park extends to within the western city boundary, and the South Pennines area ("Last of the Summer Wine country") lies just to the north. The cities of Leeds, Manchester and Nottingham are all roughly 30 miles (48 km) from Sheffield, in different directions.
Local folklore states that Sheffield, just like Rome, is built on seven hills; there are in fact considerably more than seven, and pretty much every neighbourhood is on the top or side of one hill or another. As well as the hills, the city is the meeting point of five rivers; the Don, the Loxley, the Porter Brook, the Rivelin, and the Sheaf, from which Sheffield gets its name. The city owes its existence to this rich landscape. Even before the Industrial Revolution, the villages around Sheffield were established as centres of industry and commerce thanks to fast flowing rivers and streams that brought water down from the Pennines. The valleys through which these flowed were ideally suited for man-made dams that could be used to power water mills. A walk along the Rivelin Valley from Malin Bridge tram stop or along the Porter Valley out from Endcliffe Park towards the Peak District will reveal some of these old dams.
The increasingly high-rise and densely-populated City Centre lies where these rivers and valleys meet. The city has expanded out along the valleys and over the hills between, creating leafy neighbourhoods and suburbs within easy reach of the centre. Each valley has its own character, from the densely industrial Don Valley in the north-east, to the green and cosmopolitan residential streets of the Porter Valley in the south-west. Sheffield's difficult geography mean it sometimes feels more like a succession of self-contained villages, than a metropolitan city.
Socioeconomically, and speaking very generally, Sheffield is split into two, almost down the middle: the western half, closer to the Peak District, is on the whole very affluent, indeed it contains some of the wealthiest postcodes in England. Then there's the working-class eastern half, where most of the heavy industry is concentrated, which unfortunately has some of the country's most deprived neighbourhoods. When moving from west to east, the division is stark and sudden, and the jump has been compared by academics and journalists to literary works by Dickens and Miéville, and even to Cold War-era Berlin.

Industrial Revolution and aftermath[edit]
Poet industrialist Ebenezer Elliott was a tireless champion of the working class in Sheffield and nationally. Here's his statue in Weston Park


“

Sheffield, I suppose, could justly claim to be called the ugliest town in the Old World

”


—George Orwell's ringing endorsement in The Road to Wigan Pier

Industry in the city really took off when the railways arrived, allowing for the mass import of raw materials and export of finished products. The crucible technique of making exceptionally high quality steel was invented here by Benjamin Huntsman in 1852, and for decades it was to give Sheffield the economic advantage over other steel-producing cities. The Sheffield metallurgist Harry Brearley is the most commonly-credited inventor of stainless steel, in 1912. Sheffield is still home to several steel works and a number of cutlery and blade manufacturers (including Swann Morton), and Sheffield steel can be found in surgical equipment and kitchen drawers the world over.
However, the economic recession of the 1980s hit Sheffield hard, and large numbers of workers were left unemployed by the changing shape of heavy industry in Britain. Increased mechanisation has meant that while the steel industry remains the cornerstone of the city's export economy, it employs a fraction of its former workforce. Like Liverpool and Glasgow, Sheffield gained a reputation for a socialist political scene in reaction to the Conservative government of the day and the not entirely tongue-in-cheek nickname of The People's Republic of South Yorkshire. The resilient spirit of Sheffielders in these bleak times made the city famous in the black comedy film The Full Monty (1997), and people even today retain a remarkable optimism against hardship. This is seen most acutely in a local saying, "Smile, tha's not dead yet!"

View of Sheffield City Centre
Sheffield today[edit]
It has become something of a local joke that post-war town planners did more damage to the face of Sheffield than even the Luftwaffe managed during the blitz. Bold housing projects such as the widely-known Park Hill, and the pedestrianised shopping street The Moor are relics of the 1960s vision of a "city on the move". In reality, this left much of Sheffield with a poorly maintained legacy of failed utopian concrete fantasies, but this braveness and edginess is cited by many as being a fundamental part of Sheffield's character.
Even if the built environment of Sheffield occasionally leaves something to be desired, large parts of the City Centre have been spruced up by investment, while in other areas this is still a work in progress. However, the large amount of pedestrianised space and the presence of street-running trams gives the centre something of a continental feel. Furthermore, the kind of mid-century brutalist and functionalist architecture that Sheffield has in spades has had an upsurge in popularity, and both Park Hill and the Moor have been sympathetically reinvented for the 21st century, while maintaining their essential character.

People[edit]
Sheffielders - people from Sheffield - speak with a distinctive, melodious accent, that has spurred people from other parts of Yorkshire to give them the nickname dee-dars. This is a play on the local pronunciation of "thee" and "thou" - and yes those pronouns are current in these parts! If you know of the actor Sean Bean, you will have possibly already heard his natural Sheffield accent, which he has used in many roles, including in Sharpe and Game of Thrones. There are also some dialect words in common use; see the main Yorkshire article for details.
While the whole of the north of England claims to have friendly natives, Sheffielders pride themselves on an egalitarian warmth and hospitality that goes above and beyond the call of duty. This is a city of over half a million people, where folk still greet friends and neighbours in the street to pass the time of day. Visitors may find this familial atmosphere, which has earned Sheffield the nickname of England's largest village, most noticeable in the affectionate terms that slip into everyday conversation. Even when making a simple purchase in a shop or market, you can expect to be called 'love' or 'pal' at least once. If a stranger strikes up a conversation with you on the tram, don't be alarmed, that just how Sheffielders are!
But as well as ticking a lot of Yorkshire stereotypes, Sheffield is also a vibrant multicultural city, and is home to significant Chinese, Somali, Ethiopian, Turkish, Kurdish, East European and Romany immigrant communities, while tens of thousands of people born in the city claim historic Pakistani, Irish, Caribbean, Polish and Spanish ancestry. The two universities and one huge further education college have 84,000 students between them, many of whom are from overseas. The University of Sheffield and Sheffield Hallam University have excellent ratings in teaching and research, and are important drivers to the regional economy. Sheffield is increasingly prosperous and economically active, with a youthful population, due to the high number of graduates who choose to stay in the city.
Culturally, Sheffield is no slouch, offering everything from fine art, opera, and ballet, to dynamic theatre, film, comedy and street art. The edgy environment has nurtured a reyt good reputation for popular music, and the city is home to Jarvis Cocker, Pulp, the Human League, Def Leppard, the Arctic Monkeys and others. The large student population means that nightlife is always lively, and suitably different to that of other major cities.

Sheffield sits beside the M1 motorway, one of the UK's primary north–south routes linking the city with London, Leicester, Nottingham and Leeds. The M18 links Hull and Doncaster to the M1 next to Sheffield. The M1's interchange with the M62, the main route from Manchester, Liverpool and Bradford, is 25 mi (40 km) north of Sheffield. The City Centre is most easily reached from junction 33 of the M1, via the Sheffield Parkway dual-carriageway.
Two scenic routes from Manchester, the Snake Pass (A57) and the Woodhead Pass (A628) make for breathtaking trips through the Peak District National Park. In the event of heavy snowfall in winter, the police close both routes to all traffic. Should this be the case, you might try the M62 to Leeds, and then down the M1 to Sheffield.
It is also possible to use the Peak District as the scenic route from Birmingham (via Lichfield, Ashbourne and Bakewell) or Stoke-on-Trent (via Leek and Longnor). Beware that the route becomes very busy over holiday periods, and can be treacherous during cold or snowy weather.

On foot[edit]
Sheffield City Centre is compact and within it, few attractions are much further apart than 1 mi (1.6 km). There has been significant work done to prioritise walking access, including extensive pedestrianisation, excellent links from the railway station, and a comprehensive signage system with area maps on metal pillars at strategic points, including by transport connections.
Even outside the central area, Sheffield is pleasantly walkable, with the Don Valley attractions and the Peak District being linked by walking routes from the City Centre, although of course the distances are further.
For information on walking as an activity, please see the section below.

Accessibility[edit]
It's no secret that Sheffield is hilly, so walking around it can be demanding if your fitness isn't great or you have mobility issues. Some streets, even in the City Centre, are very steep, so comparatively short distances are more tiring than on the flat. If this sounds problematic to you, it may be as well to rely on other means of transport. Still, if you are going to be walking around Sheffield, a sturdy pair of shoes with decent grip and heel support is essential.

Using postcodes[edit]
The red number 1 indicates that Esperanto Place is in S1.
Like the rest of the UK, Sheffield has an extensive system of five and six-digit postcodes, which each refer to only a small number of addresses on the same street. A typical Sheffield postcode follows the pattern of S10 2TN. Each postcode area, which is the first half of the postcode (S10 in the given example) corresponds to a geographical area in the city, all of which are S followed by a one or two digit number. For instance, most of the City Centre forms the S1 postcode area, though parts are also in the S2, S3, S4 and S10 areas. Every street name sign in Sheffield includes the postcode area, minus the preceding S, so you can tell at a glance roughly where you are if you're a bit lost. The latter half of the postcode is what helps you find a specific address.

By bicycle[edit]
Cycling in Sheffield can be an interesting experience. The city poses many challenges to safe and easy cycling: busy roads, an unfortunate dearth of dedicated cycle lanes and a hilly terrain are chief amongst these. The Supertram tracks, often embedded in the road surface, are also known to cause cycling accidents, so pay attention around these, especially in wet weather. Despite these setbacks, pedal power is a popular way of getting around. Sheffield is compact and densely-populated, meaning most parts of the city are within close distance. For those not bothered by steep climbs and swift descents, cycling Sheffield can be an exhilarating experience, and the constantly undulating terrain provides an ever-changing sequence of views and aspects. It's not for nowt that stage two of the 2014 Tour de France ended in a gruelling series of climbs and descents through the streets of the Steel City!
Sheffield City Council provide handy maps and useful information for cycling in the city, while Cyclestreets allows you to plan your cycling journey.

 Sheffield ByCycle, ☏ +44 114 437 2167, sheffield@hourbike.com. 24 hours. The city's 'hilariously' punny brand new bike hire scheme, perfect for short journeys, and the local equivalent of London's famous "Boris Bikes". Users can rent a bike from and return it to any of the network's automated docking stations, at any time. Because the scheme is in the early stages of development, docking stations are for now only found in the city centre and around the University of Sheffield. In the centre, find stations at 53.3782-1.46451 Sheaf Street (over the road from the railway station), 53.3803-1.47282 Barkers Pool and 53.3813-1.48293 Leavygreave Road. The bikes are sturdy but have limited gears, and overall are great for short distances and casual use. Annual membership is available for £10, though if you're only visiting, the best would be to rent as a casual user. Each bike costs £1 per hour, with a maximum daily cap of £7, though you can store more credit for a later date. (updated Nov 2017)
Mountain biking in Wharncliffe Woods.
Alternatively, private cycle hire is available:

53.37759-1.463044 Russell's Bicycle Shed, Sheaf Street, S1 2BP (Within the railway station; next to the taxi ranks), ☏ +44 114 273 0539. M–F: 7AM–7PM, Sa: 10AM–4PM. This service is more geared-up for longer hiring periods, from a day up to three months. The bikes are somewhat better equipped for the local terrain than Sheffield ByCycle's, so are the natural choice for anyone wishing to take their bike into the countryside. Folding bikes are also available. £6 for a day (return by 7PM), £12 overnight, £50 for 1 month, £100 for 3 months. (updated Nov 2017)
If the challenges of city cycling are not for you, that's still no reason to leave your bike at home. In Sheffield, the cyclist's paradise of the Peak District is on your doorstep. Whether you're up for mountain biking or just a leisurely glide along flat, well-marked trails, there is something for every level of cycling ability in the Peak.

Public transport[edit]
Public transport - buses, trams and trains - is an excellent way to get around Sheffield. All services are deregulated and operated by private enterprises. However, all of these companies are under licence to Travel South Yorkshire, who are the main source of unbiased travel information, updates, timetables and transport maps for the city. TSY also have a decent journey planner, accessible through their main page.
Although most fares are set by the service operators (see below), here are listed some combined tickets that offer the best value for money on multiple journeys across different operators:

CityWide Day: £4.60 for one calendar day's unlimited travel on all buses and trams in Sheffield.
CityWide 7 Day: £16 for one week's unlimited travel on all buses and trams in Sheffield.
Citywide 28 Day: £60 for four weeks' unlimited travel on all buses and trams in Sheffield.
SYConnect+: £7.90 for one calendar day's unlimited travel on all buses, trams and trains in South Yorkshire.
By tram[edit]
The Stagecoach Supertram, normally known just as the Supertram, is a modern tram network with four colour-coded lines (Blue, Yellow, Purple and the Black tram-train service) which serve the city centre and many of Sheffield's suburbs, including Rotherham. Tram services run from just before 6AM (Monday-Saturday) or 7:30AM (Sunday) until around midnight. The tram train runs 5:30AM-10:30PM (M-Sa) and 8:30AM-6:30PM (Su).

Is it a bus, is it a train? No, it's Supertram!
 B  Malin Bridge to Halfway, serving Hillsborough, Kelham Island, the University of Sheffield, the city centre, the railway station, Hallam University and Crystal Peaks. Every 10 min during the day.
 Y  Meadowhall to Middlewood, serving Valley Centertainment, the Arena, Nunnery Square, the city centre, the University of Sheffield, Kelham Island and Hillsborough. Every 10 min during the day.
 P  Herdings Park to Cathedral, via the railway station and Hallam University. At peak times, the service is extended to Meadowhall. Every 30 min during the day.
 TT  Cathedral to Rotherham Parkgate (tram train), serving Nunnery Square, the Arena, Valley Centertainment, Meadowhall South, and Rotherham town centre. Every 20 min during the day.
Using the tram[edit]
Full timetables can be downloaded from Travel South Yorkshire: Blue, Yellow, Purple, Black tram train.
Notices at your tram stop will indicate the route and fare needed for your destination. Most stations are now fitted with LED signs displaying the time and destination of the next four trams to arrive, however they don't always work particularly well. There are no ticket machines at stations. Don't panic! You can purchase your ticket on board the tram from the conductor, who walks up and down the length of the vehicle calling "fares please!" Payment is by cash or by any major credit or debit card. Supertram conductors seem to have very good facial recognition, and can keep track of who has and hasn't bought a ticket even when there are a hundred people on board. There are also sporadic on-the-spot checks from ticket inspectors, so it is important to hold onto your ticket until you have reached your destination.
All stations are request stops, meaning the tram will only stop if a passenger presses the 'stop' button or if people are waiting at the station. In practice, it is rare that a tram will pass a station without stopping, but this is worth bearing in mind if you're travelling at a quiet time.
The Supertram network is fully accessible to wheelchair users and parents with prams. Station platforms are raised up to be at the same level as the tram floor, and there is ample space on board for storage of luggage, pushchairs and wheelchairs. Passengers with no mobility constraints often sit on chairs reserved for those with such constraints, as these are closest to the doors, but nearly always move without being asked when they see someone in need getting on the tram.
Bicycles and dogs (with the exception of assistance dogs) are not allowed on the tram.

Fares and concessions[edit]
A single ticket within the city centre boundary (stations between Granville Road, The University of Sheffield, and Hyde Park) costs £2.00 for a single and £3 for a return. Longer journeys beyond these points cost £2.50 (single only), although the £2.00–£3.50 fares are still available for short journeys outside the central area. Various Dayrider and Megarider passes are available as well, but unless you are absolutely sure you're only going to use the tram and Stagecoach buses to get around, these are to be avoided.
Children under 5 travel free. Senior and disabled persons' reductions are only available to residents of England in possession of a valid concessionary pass. Other concessions are available only to applicable residents of South Yorkshire.

By bus[edit]
Sheffield has a very large bus network, which serves practically every neighbourhood and point of interest. Most buses are operated by two multinational private companies, First and Stagecoach, though there are some smaller local operators running certain routes, such as Hulleys and TM Travel. Buses generally run every 10–30 minutes during the day (M–Sa), and every 20–60 minutes in the evening and on Sundays. Some routes offer a higher frequency of service: every 4–10 minutes throughout the day and evening. Every stop has a paper timetable of all the buses that serve that stop, plus there is a bus-tracking service called YourNextBus. Text the stop's unique code (written on the flag) to 64422, and you will receive a text telling you how many minutes away the bus is; this costs 12p on top of your network rate. If using mobile internet, you can simply search for the stop or bus route number on the Travel South Yorkshire website.
A single bus fare costs £2. For all other journeys, get a CityBus (bus only) or CityWide (bus and tram) ticket, as return tickets and other fares like the Megarider and FirstDay are only valid on one company's services, whereas City tickets can be used on all operators. Roads with a high frequency of service are served by routes from different companies, and some very busy routes with the same number are operated by more than one company, so you don't want to be caught short by having the wrong company's ticket!
Bus maps of North and South Sheffield are available to download; you can also obtain paper copies at bus interchanges. Both maps show the city centre in detail. Transport map geeks should head to Sheffield Interchange (as if you weren't planning to already!), to see the cool wall maps showing the whole city's bus, tram and rail services on one large sheet. These are 'rare' in the sense that they're not available to purchase or download, and aren't displayed anywhere else in the city.
All service stop running before midnight.

By train[edit]
Midland Station
Although there aren't many rail services within Sheffield itself, there is a decent network of suburban rail services serving the city region, all of which depart from Sheffield's pretty Midland station. Tickets can be bought from any National Rail station in the UK, or online. The following services are operated by Northern Rail:

Barnsley via Meadowhall, Chapeltown, Elsecar, Wombwell (this service continues either to Huddersfield or to Wakefield and Leeds);
Chesterfield via Dronfield;
Doncaster via Meadowhall, Rotherham, Swinton, Mexborough, Conisbrough;
The Peak District / Hope Valley line: serving Dore, Grindleford, Hathersage, Bamford, Hope, Edale, Chinley, New Mills Central (this service continues to Manchester);
Worksop via Darnall, Woodhouse, Kiveton Bridge, Kiveton Park, Shireoaks (this service continues to Lincoln)
By taxi and black cab[edit]
There are no regular night bus routes in the city, and all tram services terminate around midnight. Sheffield's two main taxi companies operate 24 hours a day. Travellers from the south of England, and particularly London, will find the local taxis to be very good value; the base fare is £2.60 in the daytime (7AM–8PM) and £3.10 at night (8PM–7AM), with 20p added for every 200 m travelled. As with elsewhere, extra charges apply over Christmas and New Year.
When taking a taxi outside of Sheffield city limits (this includes most of the Peak District), always agree a fare with the driver before departure. The driver must by law let the meter run as normal, and if by the end of the journey the amount on the meter is cheaper than the agreed fare, you pay what it says on the meter. Likewise, if the fare you agreed is cheaper than the meter, then you pay the agreed rate. The taxi driver or firm is legally obliged to accept the cheaper of the two fares.
Black cabs can be easily hailed in the street in the city centre (especially around the railway station, High Street, Barker's Pool and West Street) and West End (especially around the University and Broomhill), as well as on some of the main routes into the city, but elsewhere it is usually necessary to phone for a taxi:

 City Taxis, ☏ +44 144 239-3939. Pre-booked taxis and black cabs. 
Alternatively, Uber is gaining in popularity and prominence.

By car[edit]
Why drive when you can go by tram?
The use of a private vehicle is generally discouraged for able-bodied travellers, as Sheffield's roads are congested and not always easy to navigate, and parking is not particularly easy. One of the options already mentioned should be suitable for most visitors, however if you still intend to bring your car, you might as well know a few basics.
The major roads in Sheffield are:

The Inner Ring Road (A61) forms a complete circle of dual-carriageway around the city centre.
The Outer Ring Road (A6102) forms a semicircle of single and dual-carriageways around the city through the eastern suburbs. Confusingly both the inner and the outer rings are referred to just as "Ring Road" on signs.
The Sheffield Parkway (A57 / A630) is a grade-separated dual-carriageway linking the inner and outer ring roads with junction 33 of the M1 and Rotherham
The A57 comes from the Peak District in the west, through Broomhill and the city centre, then east along part of Sheffield Parkway, before deviating south-east through Handsworth, Beighton, the M1 junction 31 and on towards Worksop.
The A61 goes straight north and south from its Ring Road portions, linking to Hillsborough, Chapeltown, the M1 junction 36 and ultimately Barnsley to the north, and Heeley, Woodseats and on towards Chesterfield to the south.
As mentioned already once or twice, Sheffield is hilly! This means that many roads have steep gradients, which will be a good test for your brakes, especially during winter when snow and ice are common. Be prepared for hill starts when moving off from on-street parking and when stuck in heavy traffic. The hills, winter conditions and extreme local government budget cuts also mean that the road surface quality is generally poor; watch out for potholes.
Most car parks in the city are owned by either Sheffield City Council, or the private companies NCP and Q-Park. The inner ring road and its approach roads all have brown signs indicating which additional signs you should follow for particular attractions and neighbourhoods, for example: "Follow Cathedral Quarter for City Hall & Cathedral." Follow the appropriate signs, even if they seem to take you half-way around the city, and you will eventually be directed to off-street paid parking close to the desired attraction. Alternatively, there are some cheaper car parks on what would otherwise be wasteland at the fringes of the city centre; these are easy enough to spot from the inner ring road.

Topped out in 1965, the University of Sheffield Arts Tower is a superb example of mid-century architecture. The main interest inside is a rare surviving paternoster lift; claimed to be the largest in the world, this is a continuously moving elevator which you can ride up 19 floors. You're not supposed to go over the top, or below ground level into the basement, but you do so 'by accident', there's no safety issue. The tower is grade-II* listed along with the adjacent Western Bank Library, which you can access across the mezzanine bridge, and which you may be able to visit with permission from the front desk. Please remember that these are busy university buildings; respect the students and staff. Free.   (updated Feb 2019)

On public land, so always accessible. On 15 April 1989, at the FA Cup semi-final, 96 Liverpool FC fans lost their lives in a terrible crush in this Sheffield stadium. The memorial at Hillsborough is understandably more low-key than the one at Anfield, but if you want to pay your respects, you can follow the example of others by leaving flowers, messages of condolence, or the shirt or scarf of the team you support. Free.  (updated Nov 2017)
53.38-1.4588 Park Hill, S2 5QX (National Rail / Supertram: Sheffield Station. 500 yards (460 m) walk steep uphill). Grade-II* listed brutalist blocks of flats.

53.3803-1.4694311 Sheffield Town Hall, Pinstone Street, S1 2HH (Supertram: Cathedral). The hub of Sheffield's local government - you can't go inside, but it's worth walking all the way around to admire the Victorian municipal architecture. Of note is the magnificent clock tower upon which the Roman god of metalworking Vulcan poses, and the many stone friezes depicting the city's industries. As you walk, don't miss the Sheffield Legends walk of fame - with plaques for actors Sean Bean and Michael Palin, Olympic athletes Jessica Ennis-Hill and Seb Coe, astronaut Helen Sharman and musicians Def Leppard and Joe Cocker, among others.

The largest urban glasshouse in Europe, built spectacularly in glass and timber, and home to exotic ferns, trees, cacti and other plants from around the world. Temperatures are kept relatively cool in summer and warm in winter. Lots of benches and a coffee bar inside makes it a pleasant place to sit and read or watch the world go by, particularly if the weather outside is not so nice. In fact, there are few more satisfying experiences to be had anywhere than listening to rain or hail lash the glass while you're warm and dry! There is a visitor information stall in the gardens, space for a pop-up shop and a tourist information centre on nearby Norfolk Row. Free.   (updated Nov 2017)

An historically important Victorian cemetery, which is the final "home" for 87,000 people, including influential Sheffielders such as steel manufacturer Mark Firth and Chartist Samuel Holberry. The 19th century class system is evident in the range of memorials, with great mausoleums, modest stones and unmarked paupers' graves (some with 40 or more burials in one plot) jostling for space. When you pass through the imposing arched gateway from Cemetery Avenue, you very much know you're entering a necropolis.

While you're there, you might as well look at some of the university buildings around it, most notably the grade-II listed 53.38193-1.479335 Sir Frederick Mappin Building is an imposing example of Edwardian architecture, while the striking metallic 53.38164-1.4817336 Diamond is either a modern masterpiece or a hideous carbuncle, depending on whom you ask.

Street art and graffiti[edit]
One of Kid Acne's previous works, since removed. Prints can still be purchased.
Like many industrial cities, Sheffield has its fair share of graffiti. However, unlike many other cities, there is much less of the "mindless vandalism" type and much more of the "probably counts as art" type. In fact, there are a lot of quality pieces of street art, murals and poetry by both established and unknown artists. The most prolific and well-known of these are Kid Acne, whose signature style is large and colourful written messages, using local slang and Yorkshire dialect, Mila K, who creates black and white psychedelic images often featuring the same cyborg woman in places that are hard to find or access, and Phlegm, whose trippy showpiece murals blend horror, cyberpunk and fantasy themes. All three have gone on to exhibit in galleries, and have worked around the UK and abroad. A piece by Banksy is yet to make an appearance.
By its very nature, a lot of street art is transitory, as weathering, building works, vandalism and deliberate removals all put paid to individual works. However, the scene in Sheffield is established enough that there are always new pieces to replace the old, in new and previously-unloved corners. And there are literally hundreds of works to discover across the city, if you have a decent pair of shoes or boots, and the patience and willing to tramp off the beaten path. Good areas to explore are the 53.37933-1.4776740 Devonshire Quarter (around Division Street and Devonshire Green), the 53.3778-1.4668941 Cultural Industries Quarter (south-west of the railway station, among Hallam University buildings) and the area between 53.389-1.472542 Kelham Island and 53.3856-1.476543 Saint Vincent's.
Listed below are a selection of notable works and murals that are likely to be around for the foreseeable future, due to the fame of the artist or the fact that they were commissioned by the property owners. You can purchase paper prints of some of these in local shops, notably the Millennium Gallery gift shop, and the pop-up store in the Winter Garden.

Second only to London's West End as the UK's greatest concentration of theatres and cinemas, Sheffield's Theatreland is based on and around the pedestrianised Tudor Square, in the east of the City Centre. The theatre scene is vibrant and extremely varied, with a number of production companies based in the city, including the acclaimed Sheffield Theatres. Plays and musicals destined for London often make their provincial debut in Sheffield, in 'try outs' designed to gauge audience response and iron out any production kinks.

It costs £3 for one year, and gives a £3 discount on regular prices every time you use it at one of seven sports venues, so offers brilliant savings even if you only use it a few times. There are also special offers and discounts on cultural events taking place in the city. You don't have to be a resident of Sheffield or even a citizen of the UK, but you do have to provide your name and address when you make the purchase, either online or at one of the venues.

Climbing[edit]
Climber at Stanage Edge
There are many good sites close by, especially where the Hallam Moors end in a gritstone scarp that forms the city's western boundary.
53.3815-1.58336 Rivelin Rocks (Rivelin Edge) (access by muddy footpath from A57 Manchester Road opposite the dam on Rivelin reservoir.53.37568-1.5861313 Parking is at the far end of the dam from the road; you can drive across. Bus: 273, 274, 275 to 53.38026-1.5936314 Onksley Lane stop, 500 yards (460 m).). A gritstone edge favoured for the Needle, a 20-metre (66 ft) free-standing pinnacle that stands in front of the main edge. The best time to visit is on fine autumn and winter days, when the rocks get plenty of sunshine.   (updated Nov 2017)
53.4746-1.55537 Wharncliffe Crags (Access is by foot from a 53.47858-1.5610715 car park just off Station Road in Deepcar, 7 mi (11 km) north-west of Sheffield. Bus: 57 from the city centre (less regular), or SL1 / SL1a (more regular) from Middlewood Supertram station, at the northern end of the Yellow line. All routes take you into 53.47769-1.5675816 Deepcar village, roughly ½ mile's (800 m) walk along roads.). In the early days of British climbing, this was one of the most popular spots. Nowadays, it is overshadowed by the more famous sites in the Peak District, and is therefore often quiet. Climbs are tough and steep. (updated Nov 2017)
See Hathersage for Stanage Edge, Burbage Edge and Millstone Edge, on the scarp of the Hallam Moors. These are accessible by foot and public transport directly from Sheffield, but if you're climbing with gear you'll be parking on the Hathersage side.
There are also several indoor climbing centres for training or bad weather days. All offer memberships and one time 'turn up and go' sessions, as long as you can demonstrate that you are a competent and safe climber. Some also offer lessons and courses.
53.399639-1.44592138 Awesome Walls, Garter Street, S4 7QX (Bus: 36 to Petre Street / Garter Street. Parking on-site.), ☏ +44 114 244 6622. M–F 10AM–10PM, Sa–Su 10AM–8PM.

Walks[edit]
Sturdy shoes are recommended on all walks, especially the more rural routes. Since Sheffield is extremely hilly, most walks have lots of ups and downs to them. Hiking boots would be ideal. Sheffield City Council has a portal for the complete list of the many interesting walks throughout the city's urban, suburban, industrial and rural landscapes, but here are six of the best:

Mainly urban[edit]
The Lady's Bridge, which you'll visit on both the Five Weirs and Sheffield Town walks.
53.3858-1.464145 Five Weirs Walk (start at the Lady's Bridge, which is directly downhill from the Castlegate bus stops and Castle Square tram station). 5 miles (8 km), can be extended or shortened. A walk between the city centre and Meadowhall along the River Don through many interesting neighbourhoods, including industrial wasteland, the still-living steelworks, Sheffield's Sikh temple, and the unexpected treats of nature reserves and ancient cemeteries. Kingfishers and otters can be seen, even in the heart of the city. Although you can catch the tram or train back into town from Meadowhall, more active travellers may wish to continue along the river into Tinsley and Rotherham, or else complete the "Blue Loop" by making the return journey on foot along the Sheffield and Tinsley Canal.   (updated Jan 2016)
53.37363-1.4358646 Norfolk Heritage Trail (Starts at Manor Lodge and ends in front of the Anglican Cathedral). 3 mi (4.8 km). A signed route linking a range of historical buildings and open spaces with connections to the Dukes of Norfolk. You will walk through City Road Cemetery, enjoy the expanses of Norfolk Park, see brilliant views of the city from the Cholera Monument and descend past Park Hill over the three-way tram junction and railway tracks, following the Supertram to the cathedral. (updated Jan 2016)
53.38269-1.4687547 Sheffield Town Walk (starts and ends at the Anglican Cathedral). 2 mi (3.2 km). Very easy circular walk around the historic city centre, taking in well-known landmarks and lesser-travelled spots. From the cathedral, make for the Old Town Hall and grim dereliction of the Castlegate Quarter. Console yourself with the pretty barges and former grain stores of the canal basin. You'll then pass the modern law courts, offices and apartments lining the river Don until you reach Kelham Island, a trendy postindustrial residential neighbourhood with many great pubs. The route finishes with a tour of the Cathedral Quarter, through Paradise Square, via barrister firms and an old synagogue as you return to the cathedral. (updated Jan 2016)
Mainly rural[edit]
The Rivelin Valley in May; yes this is still Sheffield!
Use OS Landranger Map 110 for this area. The Peak District further west is covered by OL1 at finer scale, but it cuts off the moors on the city's west boundary. Weather conditions can differ substantially from town; a light rain on Weston Park could be freezing sleet or snow on Stanage Edge, low cloud over The Moor means fog on the moors, etc, etc. Pack for where you're going, not for where you are.

53.44391-1.5036548 Grenoside to Whitley walk, Main Street, Grenoside, S35 8NY (off the A61, park near the Old Red Lion pub. Buses 35, 85 and M92 stop on Main Street, 200 yards (180 m) from the pub). Native woodland, dells and pretty villages make this an easy 4 mi (6.4 km) circular walk around the countryside north of Sheffield. Even better, it starts and finishes at a pub. Reyt good! (updated Apr 2020)
53.3995-1.512749 Rivelin Valley Nature Trail (starts a short distance from Malin Bridge tram station). 4 mi (6.4 km), shorter circular walks at either end possible. Where the city meets the Peak District. Walk alongside the rushing waters of the river Rivelin, passing numerous old water mills, mill ponds and other scenic spots. This popular conservation area is home to a great deal of wildlife. Several well-maintained footpaths and bridleways make this an excellent choice for families, with very easy walking routes. The energetic may muster themselves to climb the very steep path all the way to 53.3719-1.572717 Lodge Moor bus terminus on Redmires Road - the regular number 51 will take you back into town. (updated Apr 2020)
53.3694-1.595950 Wyming Brook Nature Reserve and Stanage Edge, Redmires Road, S10 4QX (car park on site, Bus: 51 to Lodge Moor, 1 mi (1.6 km)). This gorge is now a protected nature reserve. A rocky footpath leads you from the car park down along the bottom of the gorge, crossing the stream several times, to a reservoir. There are many possible walks of varying lengths you could try, but one suggestion is to walk the 2½ miles (4 km) to Stanage Edge. From Wyming Brook car park, head west along Redmires Road, around the reservoirs and up the medium incline until the Peak District opens up in all its majesty in front of you. The edge is flat and easy to walk, with superb panoramic views all around. Many will turn back at this point, but you could equally walk along Stanage as far as you want, or descend the steep 2½ miles (4 km) down to the handsome Derbyshire village of Hathersage. Cream teas or a pint in the pub await you there, and you can return to Sheffield by train. The entire spectacular Lodge Moor to Hathersage station route is 6⅓ miles (10 km) over varied and undulating terrain.   (updated Apr 2020)
Learn[edit]
There are two major universities in Sheffield, both of which attract large numbers of international students from all over the world:

53.381389-1.4882721 University of Sheffield ("Uni of"), Western Bank, S10 2TN (Supertram: University), ☏ +44 114 222 2000. An older "red brick" university founded in 1828, which became a university in 1905. It belongs to the prestigious Russell Group of top British universities, and is one of the top 100 universities in the world. With around 28,000 students, it has strengths in the sciences, engineering, medicine, information management, architecture, business and languages. It spans the western part of the city centre and most of the neighbourhood of Broomhill. Its student's union has been named as the best in the country for ten consecutive years since 2009, and the University's student experience, which focuses on atmosphere, community and social life has been consistently voted into the top three every year since 2013 (Times Higher Education).   (updated Sep 2018)
53.379105-1.4647062 Sheffield Hallam University ("Hallam"), Howard Street, S1 1WB (National Rail and Supertram: Sheffield Station), ☏ +44 114 225 5555. An ex-polytechnic founded in 1843 and made a university in 1992, which focuses on engineering, nursing, midwifery, art, management and computing courses. It has two large campuses, one in the Cultural Industries Quarter of the city centre, and the other near Ecclesall Road.

Sheffield has two main shopping destinations. The city centre is varied and walkable. It has a good range of high street and independent stores. The out-of-town Meadowhall shopping centre is Yorkshire's largest and has a huge range of shops. Beyond these two destinations, Sheffield's other shopping experiences range from suburban high streets to local shopping centres and themed quarters.

City centre[edit]
The central area packs in a lot of national chains and independent shops. Visitors will however find there are fewer big name brands than might be expected, due to Meadowhall's proximity and size. Much of the city centre is pedestrianised, and this makes an easy and pleasant environment to walk around. The main axis of central shopping destinations runs in a gently curving line from the Moor in the south-west, via Fargate and surrounds to Castlegate in the north-east. In the west of the city centre, the Devonshire Quarter is a hub of independent boutiques.

The Moor[edit]
The Moor is a broad pedestrianised street dating from the 1950s, that is undergoing regeneration in the mid-2010s, and will become part of a larger central retail quarter in the early 2020s. It is now a cool mix of mid-century functionalism and modernity, and is the home of several landmark stores, a cinema, chain restaurants and cafés, and the city's central market. While much of the street is now finished and looking great, building work is ongoing in the immediate surroundings.
Although it is a bit of a distance from the nearest tram stops, most city bus routes serve the area on Charter Row, Cumberland Street, Eyre Street and Furnival Gate. Alternatively, there is a large multistorey car park [dead link] on Eyre Street.

53.37587-1.474241 Atkinson's, 78-82 The Moor, S1 3LT, ☏ +44 114 276 8811, enquiries@atkinsonsofsheffield.co.uk. M–F 9AM–5:30PM, Sa 9AM–6PM, Su 10:30AM–4:30PM. Sheffield's very own independent and idiosyncratic family department store has been on the Moor since 1872, although the original building was destroyed in the Blitz of 1940. It sells home items including furniture and kitchen gear, as well as fashion, cosmetics and fragrances. Atkinson's is also home to its own restaurant, an Italian coffee shop and a tea room.   (updated Nov 2017)
53.37656-1.473472 Fashion Brand, 64 The Moor, S1 4PA, ☏ +44 114 275 0399. Independent women's fashion and clothing store. (updated Nov 2017)
53.37594-1.472753 Record Junkee, 7 Earl Street, S1 3FP, ☏ +44 114 275 9035, recordjunkee42@yahoo.co.uk. M–Sa 9AM–5:30PM, Su 11AM–5PM. Large and varied selection of new and second-hand vinyl records. At the same address, Music Junkee sells a vast array of new and second-hand musical instruments, and audio, lighting, mixing and software equipment for DJs. The stock is faultless, but be prepared for dodgy customer service. (updated Nov 2017)
53.37544-1.473034 The Moor Market, 77 The Moor, S1 4PF, ☏ +44 114 273 5281, marketsinfo@sheffield.gov.uk. M–Sa 8AM–5:30PM. Sheffield's snazzy indoor market hall opened in 2013, moving from its historic location in Castlegate. The market has more than 90 stalls, and has become a foodie mecca, mixing traditional local food and drink producers with specialist artisans, delis and other stalls selling international items. Alongside this, there are haberdashery, clothing, furnishing and jewellery sellers.  (updated Nov 2017)
Other significant shops include three national department stores (Debenhams, Primark and TJ Hughes), plus an Ann Summers sex shop, Blacks outdoor gear, Burton / Dorothy Perkins clothing, Deichmann footwear, Forbidden Planet comic book store (just off the Moor on Matilda Street), and a Sainsbury's supermarket.

Pinstone Street, Furnival Gate, Barkers Pool[edit]
Pinstone Street
Directly north of The Moor is a rather hideous collection of bus-choked streets with semi-abandoned shops and offices that for now appear to have been left behind by all the regeneration. Of the shops that remain, there is little to write home about. Boring but useful services such as building societies and opticians rub shoulders with charity shops. The only thing which really should tempt you here is the trio of great takeaways: Béres pork sandwich shop, Fanoush falafel and salads, and Street Food Chef burrito bar, each of which have become Sheffield institutions. See individual listings in the Eat section of this page.

53.37862-1.471355 Naked Ape, 96 Pinstone Street, S1 2HQ, ☏ +44 114 273 9777, waynebiney@nakedape.uk.com. M Tu F Sa 10AM–5PM. Outdoor equipment store. Good for Vibram Fivefingers shoes, outdoor clothing and backpacks. (updated Nov 2017)
As you approach the Town Hall, the buildings get older and smarter, and the shops get better. There are three jewellers, plus a JD Sports, Toni&Guy salon and a Budgens supermarket.

53.3755-1.470446 La Biblioteka, 61 Eyre Lane, S1 3GF, ☏ +44 7522 01 08 03, shop@labiblioteka.co. Tu–Sa 10AM–5PM. Independent shop that stocks books and periodicals relating to travel, architecture, fashion, food, art and literature. Also hosts literary events. (updated Nov 2017)
If you do a sort of left U-turn just before the Town Hall, you'll find Barkers Pool. Dominated by its war memorial, this square has the City Hall theatre on one side and a large John Lewis department store on the other, as well as smaller shops, including a Google Digital Garage, Patisserie Valerie and unique home furnishings store Stone the Crows! Barkers Pool connects to the Devonshire Quarter to the west.

Surrey Street[edit]
Corner of Norfolk Street and Surrey Street
This pleasant cobbled street of quirky independent shops runs along the north side of the Town Hall towards Tudor Square. Here, you can see chic brown stone buildings, the Sheffield "TARDIS" and Montgomery Theatre. Surrey Street also has the city's tourist information centre and an entrance to the Winter Garden / Millennium Gallery. The nearest Supertram station is Cathedral.

Fargate[edit]
Flower market on Fargate
Fargate is Sheffield's pedestrianised main shopping street, which runs from the Town Hall at the top to the Anglican cathedral and High Street at the bottom, where trams and buses stop. There are several buildings of architectural note here, including the Grade-II listed Carmel House. There are often specialist markets on Fargate, with past themes as diverse as arts and craft, gardening, continental, and middle eastern bazaar. This street is also the hub of Sheffield Food Festival (in May) and the popular Christmas Market (mid-November to December), when log cabins run its length and lights glitter between the buildings.
Many chain retailers can be found on Fargate, including fashion stores Foot Locker, H&M, New Look, Next and Topshop / Topman, jewellers H. Samuel and Pandora, cosmeticians KIKO and Lush, chocolatiers Hotel Chocolat and Thorntons, department store Marks & Spencer, and newsagent and bookseller WHSmith.
Just off Fargate, Chapel Walk is a narrow pedestrian alley leading to Norfolk Street, that has a number of specialist stores and cosy cafés. Scaffolding is (March 2018) making the street look unsightly and out of use, but Chapel Walk is still very much open for business. Of note are Claire's accessories, a Dr. Martens shop, and a couple of gift shops.

Orchard Square[edit]
Orchard Square is a precinct between Fargate and Church Street. It is home to a number of fashion outlets on the main square and specialist shops in the Craft Workshop upstairs. Among Sheffielders, especially those who grew up in the city, it is best known for its mechanical clock, which chimes at every quarter of an hour and opens to reveal the moving figures of cutlers from the olden days. To adult visitors, this will seem a bit naff, but little (and big!) kids love it.
Orchard Square is very easily accessible from City Hall Supertram station, and lots of bus routes stop on Leopold Street just outside.

Castlegate Quarter[edit]
The river Don from Blonk Bridge in Castlegate
The High Street is the broad avenue where buses and trams run downhill from the cathedral towards Ponds Forge and Park Hill. Despite a fabulous mix of architectural styles and three Supertram stations (Cathedral, Castle Square and Fitzalan Square), it is mainly a mix of fast food restaurants and inexpensive retail giants such as Bonmarché, Boots, HMV, Poundland and Sports Direct. There are also some independent shops, but little to recommend among them. Beyond Castle Square, the retail more or less dries up, even while the architecture remains impressive.
In the rest of the Castlegate Quarter, north of the High Street up to the river Don, the situation looks grimmer. From the middle ages until 2013, this was the location of Sheffield's central market hall; this has now moved to the flourishing Moor as part of a general westward shift of activity in the city centre. This means that what was the Castle Market building has been demolished, leaving a whacking great hole surrounded by 'temporary' hoarding. The surrounding streets seem to be on a similar downward spiral, with most of the buildings looking sad and neglected.
However, to pass by Castlegate based on how it looks would be to miss out on a wide selection of bargain stores and an extremely diverse cheap restaurant scene all within spitting distance of lots of hotels. Castlegate is actually perfect for travellers on a budget. Besides, redevelopment plans to create a new landscaped riverside park, and the district's exceedingly long history as Sheffield's commercial centre may well combine to force a change in fortunes in the near future. Useful shops include Argos, B&M Bargains, Wilko, another Poundland less than 400 metres from the one mentioned above, the weirdly-named cheap toiletries store Savers, and a Co-op food supermarket.

Devonshire Quarter[edit]
Devonshire Street shops
Based around Devonshire Green is one of Sheffield's indie areas. Its strategic location between the two universities means that a huge number of students and graduates live in the neighbourhood. Devonshire Street runs along Dev Green and has a mix of restaurants and gift boutiques, while Division Street has trendy stores and relaxed watering holes. Parallel to these are the frantic bars and clubs of Glossop Road and West Street. Devonshire is a good place to come for a pamper, as there are a number of hairdressers, salons, Turkish barbers and even a Victorian hamam. There are also a growing number of Chinese businesses, reflecting that community's increasing importance to Sheffield's population and economy. The area is served by the Supertram at West Street.

53.37963-1.47918 Balance, 156 Devonshire Street, S3 7SG, ☏ +44 114 249 1220, info@lifeisbalance.co.uk. M–Th 11AM–6PM; F 11AM–6PM, 8PM–10PM; Sa noon–6PM, 8PM–10PM; Su noon–5PM. A disconcerting mix of clothes, posters and bongs, which sums up Devonshire surprisingly well. (updated Nov 2017)

Aside from a few fast food and coffee outlets, there are almost no chain stores in Devonshire, other than a largish Tesco Metro supermarket on West Street, and a small Sainsbury's Local on Division Street.

Shopping centres[edit]
Palm trees and natural light keep the "hell" to a minimum in Meadowhall
53.41443-1.41094933 Meadowhall, S9 1EP (By road: M1 junction 34. National Rail, bus and Supertram: Meadowhall Interchange. Alternative Supertram: Tinsley / Meadowhall South. The rail service from Sheffield Midland is quicker and more frequent than the tram or bus routes, but isn't cheaper if you have the CityBus or CityWide passes.), ☏ +44 333 313 2000. Shops: M–F 9AM–10PM, Sa 9AM–8PM, Su 11AM–5PM, food court: M–Sa 9AM–11PM, Su 10AM–9PM. Opening hours vary around Christmas. One of the largest indoor shopping centres in the country, with 280 high-end and chain stores receiving over 30 million visitors every year. Given its size and pre-eminent status in the region, the centre is always busy and often crowded, and it gets positively manic before Christmas. Indeed, many Sheffielders refer to it as "Meadowhell". It is certainly a less pleasant environment than the city centre, but has a more complete retail experience.  Anchor stores are Debenhams, House of Fraser, Marks & Spencer, Primark and USC. Meadowhall has the only Sheffield presence of several brands including Apple, Disney Store, French Connection, Hollister, Lacoste, Superdry and Victoria's Secret. A zone called The Lanes is dedicated to independent and unique shops. The Oasis Dining Quarter is a very large food court offering a range of cuisines with mainly chain restaurants and fast food outlets. Also inside is a ten-screen cinema (see above) plus indoor and outdoor play areas for young children.   
53.3419-1.3512634 Crystal Peaks, S20 7PJ (In the south eastern suburb of Beighton. Bus and Supertram: Crystal Peaks.), ☏ +44 114 251 0457, customerservices@crystalpeaks.uk.com. M–W 9AM–5:30PM; Th F 9AM–8PM; Sa 9AM–5:30PM; Su 10AM–4PM. A smaller shopping centre than Meadowhall with around 100 shops, and more of a locals' place. Despite the cool name, there is not really anything here that you couldn't find elsewhere in Sheffield, and if you aren't in the area, it's probably not worth the surprisingly long ride on the tram or bus. That said, visitors to the south-east of the city will certainly find it useful.   
Antiques Quarter[edit]
With well over 60 participating businesses, 53.35993-1.479535 Dronfield Antiques Of Sheffield is the place for antiques, salvage, arts and crafts, rare books and records, specialist services, and retro and vintage clothing. The quarter covers the neighbourhoods of Heeley, Nether Edge and Sharrow, and access is easiest by bus routes 20, 25, 53, 74, 76, 87, 97 and 98, which all stop on Abbeydale Road. It would be impossible to list even a selection of the businesses of the quarter here, and would be unnecessarily duplicative since the official website does a brilliant job of listing each business already, splitting them by useful categories.
There is a programme of regular events throughout the year, including the Pedlar's Corner car boot sale and flea market, which takes place at Abbeydale Picture House every first Sunday of the month between 10AM and 3PM. If you're feeling peckish or thirsty, there are a great many quality cafés and bars which all follow the retro theme in one way or another. As you explore the area, look out for a number of street art pieces.

53.35703-1.47836 Sheffield Auction Gallery, Windsor Road, S8 8UB, ☏ +44 114 281 6161, enquire@sheffieldauctiongallery.com. View upcoming auction dates here. Established in 1840, this is the oldest auctioneer in the region. Antiques and collectable auctions are every fortnight, while general auctions take place once a month, and there are other specialist auctions every week. (updated Dec 2017)
London Road[edit]
Although London Road overlaps to some extent with the Antiques Quarter, in many ways it should be considered as its own distinct shopping area. It runs south from St Mary's Gate on the Inner Ring Road for almost a mile, and is served by bus routes 10, 20, 25, 33, 43, 53, 294 and X17. There was an aborted attempt by the council to turn the road into a Chinatown, but this was poorly received by residents as it does not properly reflect the area's demographics. This is easily the most multicultural part of Sheffield, where British Turks, Iranians, Italians, Portuguese, Kurds, Poles, Somalis, Chinese, Pakistanis, Arabs and Kosovars all rub shoulders. It is above all known for its restaurants, some of which are listed under the Eat section of this article, but this is also a great place to buy foods and products from all over the world. In the area is Sheffield's Central Mosque which welcomes visitors by appointment, but has a rather long waiting list.

53.3727-1.476937 Chinese Fireworks Company Limited, 2 London Road, S2 4LN, ☏ +44 114 276 2626 (in season), +44 7973 129 529 (out of season), shay@chinesefireworks.co.uk.

53.368554-1.47649142 Sheffield Transport Models, 206 London Road, S2 4LW, ☏ +44 114 255 3010. Tu W F 10AM–5PM; Sa 10AM–2PM; Su 11AM–1PM. Specialists in diecast, airfix and other modelling products. (updated Dec 2017)
The local 53.3717-1.476843 Sainsbury's also merits a look, if only for its really unusual orientalist architecture. Called "the pagoda" locally, it was a cinema in the 1920s, later became a ballroom, and is now perhaps the coolest supermarket building in England. Disappointingly, the inside is just an ordinary Sainsbury's with boring old aisles and checkouts.

Broomhill[edit]
Once described by Poet Laureate John Betjeman as "the prettiest suburb in England", Broomhill is a fairly self-contained area: a pleasant mix of student stomping ground and well-heeled residential neighbourhood. Only a mile from the city centre, it has an interesting range of shops from inexpensive to trendy along a high street which mixes both charming and humdrum buildings together. Music lovers should make time for the impressive second-hand vinyl and CD collection at Record Collector on Fulwood Road. Sci-Fi enthusiasts should head to Galaxy 4 on Glossop Road, which has a particularly fine selection of Doctor Who merchandise. Served by bus routes 51, 52 and 120.

Other neighbourhoods[edit]
Ecclesall Road's independent fashion shops, bars, cafés and restaurants run from the inner ring road for over a mile out to the bohemian Hunters Bar. Served by bus routes 65, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 88, 215 and 272.
Hillsborough has a large shopping area comparable in size and scope to that of many town centres around England. The high street has all the old-fashioned essentials including a butcher, a baker and a, erm, hardware store. The Hillsborough Barracks outdoor shopping centre contains a variety of local and chain stores and a Morrisons hypermarket. Supertram: Hillsborough Interchange.
Although international food shops can be found all over Sheffield, areas of particular note include Attercliffe and Darnall for South Asian, Burngreave for African and West Indian and Sharrow for Arabic, Chinese, Eastern European and Turkish.
Eat[edit]
A bottle of Hendo's. See! It's nothing like Lea and Perrins...
Would you care for a jelly baby?
Local specialities[edit]
This is a working class industrial city, so its native foodstuffs reflect this in their simplicity and, often, their factory origin.
The unquestioned star of the culinary show in Sheffield is Henderson's Relish, produced in the Steel City since 1885. Known variously as Hendo's, the black stuff, relly or just Yorkshire sauce, this is a very dark brown spicy liquid condiment which can be added to any number of dishes as a flavour enhancer: fish and chips, casserole, anything with melted cheese, and even cocktails. Despite being practically unknown elsewhere, in South Yorkshire you will see Hendo's in all good chippies, in most of the city's gift shops, and in supermarkets. The relish is a beloved icon of Sheffield, and features on postcards, artwork and T-shirts alongside the city's physical landmarks. A word of warning: under no circumstances should you compare Henderson's relish to the more famous Worcestershire sauce; a London MP was foolish enough to state the former was an imitator of the latter, and the backlash was so severe that he was forced to visit the Henderson's factory and offer a grovelling apology to incensed Sheffielders, who will defend their sauce to the death, if necessary.
You'll also want to put Hendo's on Sheffield fishcakes, which are different to the "mashed-up fish baked in breadcrumbs" that the rest of the country knows as fishcakes. Local fishcakes are whole fillets of cod or haddock, wrapped in potatoes (tatters) and deep fried in batter. Look for them in chippies (sometimes called frieries in Sheffield) and fishmongers.
Another local favourite is the pork sandwich: hot roast pork, stuffing, crackling and apple sauce crammed into a thickly buttered breadcake, i.e. a bread roll. While not native to Sheffield, this snack has been so heartily adopted by Sheffielders that there is a citywide chain of shops where all you can buy is pork sandwiches!
You're in God's own county, so expect to see Yorkshire puddings and plenty of savoury pies on the menu. For the latter, any pub which serves food or one of two local bakery chains - Cooplands and Staniforths, which seem to have shops everywhere - are the places to be.
Finally, Sheffield has a great tradition of producing snacks and confectionery. Internationally-known brands Bassetts and Thorntons originate here, and the former still make their liquorice allsorts and jelly babies in their original factory in Hillsborough. Less well-known are Yorkshire Crisps, made in several varieties including Henderson's Relish flavour - more conventional flavours are available. Another imaginative brand name is the Sheffield Honey Company, which really does produce excellent artisan honey, both natural and paired with locally-available natural flavourings such as heather and blossom. Each jar tells you the exact location of the hives your honey was made - there are colonies throughout the city - so you can feasibly go and thank the bees if so inclined. No list of sweet treats would be complete without ice cream, and the award-winning Our Cow Molly stands apart from the herd of ice cream makers as something rather special. The creamery, which you can visit, is next door to the fields in which their cows roam, and the resulting ice cream is intensely flavoursome and fresh. Sheffield's proximity to the Peak District means that almond-and-jam-based Bakewell tarts and puddings are readily available, although you are still encouraged to visit the multitude of competing shops all claiming to be the original in Bakewell.

Eating out[edit]
There are many good, cheap places to eat in and around the city. If you would rather stay in and still want to have a taste of what Sheffield has to offer, you can always opt for food from one of the takeaways in Sheffield . Usually prices range from £7 to £20 for a meal for two.

The city's very own chain of "pork sandwich shops" was founded by Sandor Béres from Budapest and his local wife Eileen in 1956.

Drink[edit]
The city is known for its wide variety of traditional pubs, most of which serve local ales. The nightlife is lively: there are almost 30 nightclubs, numerous bars and restaurants to suit all budgets, six theatres and three city-centre cinemas.

Pubs[edit]
Sheffield is well known for its large number of pubs. From dark and Victorian to sleek and modern; and from traditional real-ale haven to noisy standing-room-only bar, you can easily find a pub in Sheffield to suit your taste in beer, music and company. However, most city-centre pubs are more oriented towards fast drinking students and clubbers; on West Street in particular (linking the university with the city centre) you will find many pubs and bars which during the week become busy with students and younger customers. Finding quieter pubs in which to sample something other than the usual chain-pub lager requires delving a little deeper beneath the surface.
For the unimaginative, you'll find the usual Wetherspoons and All Bar One chain pubs, throughout the city centre serving cheap lager, hand-pulled ales and reasonably priced food in a smoke (and atmosphere) free environment.
Hybrid bar-pubs manage to maintain something of a pub atmosphere, and sell real ale at reasonable prices, while still pulling in the crowds. They are used as much by people who want a good range of beer at good prices, as by "yoofs" after a good night out. They are probably doing a good job of persuading at least some lager drinkers to switch to traditional ales.

53.37782-1.478111 The Washington, Fitzwilliam St (near Devonshire Green). Great music pub, used to be owned by Nick Banks from the band "Pulp". Relaxed atmosphere, varied DJ nights. Open till 1AM every night except Sunday till midnight. Large beer garden and smoking area at the back of the pub. (updated Jan 2024)
53.37969-1.476332 The Frog & Parrot, Division Street. A popular pub with a long history, in days gone by offering what it claimed as the strongest ale legally served in a British pub. These days it offers food and locally-brewed real ales and often features live music. (updated Jan 2024)
53.38125-1.4713 The Bessemer (previously The Fountain), Leopold Street. A modern, quite upmarket pub with a strong focus on its traditional English menu. (updated Jan 2024)
53.37881-1.462724 Sheffield Tap (Occupies the refurbished Edwardian dining rooms at Sheffield Railway station). Offers a vast selection of beers from cask, tap and bottle that could rival any other Sheffield venue. Surroundings are thankfully lacking in the usually ubiquitous flat screen television. The only background music are the trains arriving and departing the station. The entrance is equally unpretentious so may be hard to find - it's at the north end of the station near the pedestrian crossing to the bus station, with another entrance straight onto platform 1. (updated Jan 2024)
53.36769-1.497455 Porter Cottage, Sharrow Vale Road. Indie jukebox, normal ales but amazing atmosphere. Landlady Mandy will know your life history by the time you leave. Get in early to get a decent table. (updated Jan 2024)
Sheffield's real gems are the handful of surviving traditional pubs and free houses, which generally have more room to sit down, quieter (or no) music, and real hand pumped ales.

53.38061-1.468096 The Brown Bear, Norfolk Street (close to the Sheffield Theatres and Winter Garden). Offers what must be the cheapest beer in the city and an incredible mix of both theatre goers and local people. (updated Jan 2024)

53.38178-1.4749910 The Grapes (Flynns), Trippet Lane. May offer impromptu Irish or Folk music in the back room. (updated Jan 2024)
53.37918-1.4822111 The Bath Hotel, Victoria Street (just off West Street). Is tiny, free of piped music and friendly. (updated Jan 2024)
There are more warm and welcoming traditional pubs in Sheffield's suburbs. North-west of the city centre, in Crookes and Walkley (popular with students as places to live) are:

53.38612-1.4972212 The Hallamshire House, Commonside. Is reputedly the only pub in Sheffield still housing a full-sized snooker table. (updated Jan 2024)
53.39415-1.5055413 The Walkley Cottage, Bole Hill Road. Is friendly with good range of beer and good food. (updated Jan 2024)

53.37861-1.4987815 The Nottingham House ("The Notty"). As it is better known has been extensively refurbished. Catering for locals, visitors and students, it really is a pub worth a visit. Home-made pies are a speciality and real ales are aplenty. Occasional live music on Thursday nights with acts from near and far. Pool table is very good value at 50p. (updated Jan 2024)
53.38446-1.5028916 The Cobden View, Cobden View Rd (near Crookes). This small and charming independent pub serves great local ales until approx. 1AM most nights, and is always bursting with atmosphere and friendly locals. (updated Jan 2024)
Real ale fans from great distances come to "do" the real ale trail of Sheffield's Upper Don Valley (known locally as "the Valley of Beer"), a route stretching from near the city centre out to Hillsborough. The trail calls at:

53.38676-1.4715617 Shakespeares, 146-148 Gibraltar Street. (updated Jan 2024)
53.38813-1.4722218 The Kelham Island Tavern. Has won best Pub in Britain from Camra twice. (updated Jan 2024)

53.3885-1.4662922 The Harlequin. The latest addition to The Ale Trail, more open plan and possibly less off putting to people who aren't used to real ale pubs than the others might seem. (updated Jan 2024)
The trail roughly parallels the tram route from the city centre to Hillsborough, so getting there and back is easy. All these pubs have a huge range of British draught real ales (some brewed by the pub) and most have a selection of bottle-conditioned beers from continental Europe (especially Belgium).

53.35818-1.4826223 The Broadfield, Abbeydale Road (in Nether Edge). A total refurb in December 2011 has finally seen this pub reach its full potential. The pub is now a decent size and serves a huge range of local (and further afield) cask ales, home-made pies and sausages, and stocks a whisky from every distillery in Scotland. Forget the City centre and head out to the suburbs! (updated Jan 2024)
53.36209-1.470924 The Sheaf View, Gleadless Road. Is a real ale hotspot. Famous for serving the south side of Sheffield with the local breweries and other guest ales with knowledgeable bar staff. Has a reputation for friendly Sheffield folk to relax there after hiking and climbing in The Peak. So called because of possible view of the Sheaf River although now obstructed by newer buildings. (updated Jan 2024)
Bars[edit]
Visiting Sheffield, you might be led to believe that students go out every day of the week. With some 55,000 university students this is hardly surprising. These are some of the more popular pubs.

53.37752-1.4660836 The Hubs (Inside Sheffield Hallam Union (the former National Centre for Popular Music) so easy to find). It looks like a big, silver, flying spaceship, close to the train station. Not as big or impressive on the inside as it is on the outside, a relatively small union bar. (updated Jan 2024)
53.38024-1.4796937 Cavendish (locally referred to as 'The Chavendish'), West Street. A scream/yellowcard bar (you get discounted drinks if you buy or have a friend with a yellowcard, which costs £1 to NUS card holders). Serves decent food; a cheap student pub/bar with pool tables.

53.38032-1.4848840 The Harley, Glossop Road (by the University tram stop). Open Late til 4AM on event nights. Plays host to cutting edge live music and varied club nights. (updated Jan 2024)
53.38098-1.4745441 Walkabout, Carver Street (near City Hall tram stop). Australia themed bar. Very popular, fairly cheap, but can get a bit claustrophobic. Better as calling point on a pub crawl than a place for staying in. (updated Jan 2024)
Gay bars There are a small number of gay bars, clubs and gay-nights, whose locations and names change on a regular basis.
Clubs & live venues[edit]
Unlike Sheffield's dense strip of student bars along West Street, the city's night clubs are more spread out around the city centre, especially in the former industrial buildings. The most well known are:

(updated Jan 2024)

53.38655-1.4747349 The Night Kitchen, 7 Smithfield. Somewhat more difficult of a find for the visitor due to its location outside of the city centre, this trendy club occupying an old cutlery factory was named as one of the ten best in the country by The Guardian in 2015. (updated Jan 2024)

Stay safe[edit]
As with the rest of the UK, in any emergency call 999 or 112 and ask for Ambulance, Fire or Police when connected.
All central areas or main shopping suburbs are perfectly safe during the day. After hours, some peripheral parts of the city centre may seem a little quiet and lonely, but any well-lit street with plenty of people about will is as safe as any city centre in the UK if the usual precautions are taken. Some outer neighbourhoods are best avoided, but as a traveller, you will almost certainly never visit them anyway.

Stay healthy[edit]
In a medical emergency, dial 999 or 112.

Hospitals and clinics[edit]

Cope[edit]
There are no public toilets in Sheffield city centre. Instead, the city council have erected signs pointing to businesses which allow you to use their facilities without spending any money; these include the three large Debenhams, John Lewis and Marks & Spencer department stores, The Graduate and Banker's Draft pubs, the Moor Market, and every branch of Subway. Free loos can also be found in the Central Library, Millennium Gallery and Weston Park Museum.

Go next[edit]
The Peak District is close to Sheffield, indeed parts of it are within the city boundary. For a day trip by public transport, the most accessible is along the Hope Valley railway line through Grindleford, Hathersage, Hope and Edale. Lots of hikes start from these stations, eg to Castleton with Mam Tor and Winnats Pass, along Stanage Edge, or up Kinder Scout. You need a car to reach the rest of the area, such as Chatsworth or Dovedale.
Leeds is a lively city with many visitor attractions.
Manchester, dare it be said here, has even more attractions and amenities than Sheffield.
York by contrast has kept its medieval walls and winding cobbled streets, and the old castle still teeters on a hillock.
In the West Yorkshire hills are Holmfirth, setting for the TV series Last of the Summer Wine, attractive Hebden Bridge, and Haworth home of the Brontë sisters.
In Nottinghamshire, the ancient oaks of Sherwood Forest surround the village of Edwinstowe, while the Dukeries are an area of country parks and stately homes.
