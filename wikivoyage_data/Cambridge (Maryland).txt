Cambridge is a small town of 10,000 on the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland's Eastern Shore.


Understand[edit]
Cambridge's Main Street
The harbor town of Cambridge was founded in 1684, making it one of the oldest cities in the state. It's seen ups and downs throughout its long history, at times a residence of choice for wealthy colonials, and not long ago a site of conflict and heavy job losses in the 60s during desegregation, racial violence, and the closing of the local cannery. It also has had several very famous residents: Harriet Tubman, Annie Oakley, and even a president of Liberia have all known the town as home. Today's Cambridge has seen rising fortunes from tourism (especially following the construction of the huge Hyatt resort) and professionals moving in who like the laid back, charming, maritime atmosphere.

 Visitor Center, 2 Rose Hill Pl, ☏ +1 410 228-1000, info@tourdorchester.org. If you enter Cambridge from the north you will cross the Choptank River on Route 50. Your first stop is the Visitor's Center at Sailwinds Park. The staff here are available to give information about the area's history, and advice on what to see when. They also offer a self-guided walking tour of the town's historic center, or a self-guided 105-mile driving tour of Underground Railroad sites. The Center is on the grounds of Sailwinds park, which has a children's playground, picnic tables a path along the river and spectacular views of the bridge.

By car[edit]
Cambridge is about halfway between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Ocean City on US-50, the Ocean Gateway. Maryland Ave leads right from the highway to the historic town center.

By boat[edit]
The town harbor is just up the Choptank River from the bay. The most busy marina belongs to the Hyatt; the city's marina is just north of the historic center:

By plane[edit]
Cambridge-Dorchester Airport (FAA:KCGE) is a small, regional airport with no scheduled commercial flights. Private planes park within walking distance of Kay's restaurant.  Courtesy transportation to town may be available.
Get around[edit]
The town center is small and easily walked, while getting around surrounding areas will require a car or a bike (the Eastern Shore is good bike riding territory—not a hill in sight).
