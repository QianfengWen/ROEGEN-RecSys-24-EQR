Map of Strait Shores
Port Elgin was founded by Acadians in 1690, but abandoned after the Expulsion of the Acadians in 1755. Following the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War, British Loyalists resettled in the area which was named Gaspareaux Town. Gaspareaux Town was renamed Port Elgin in 1847 in honour of Lord Elgin. The community was incorporated as a village in 1922, the first community in the province to do so.

Get in[edit]
Port Elgin sits near the intersection of Routes 15 and 16, about 45 minutes east of Moncton. Route 15 connects directly to Moncton and is a slightly shorter than taking the Trans-Canada Highways.  Route 16 is part of a branch of the Trans-Canada Highway, midway between Route 2 (Trans-Canada Highway main route) at Aulac and the Confederation Bridge.  Route 16 in New Brunswick turns into Highway 1 in Prince Edward Island.
