Old Hunstanton cliffs
Old Hunstanton and Hunstanton are an adjoining town and village on the Norfolk coast. Known for being one of the few (or only) places on the east coast in England where the sun can be seen to set over the sea, the two places combine ancient heritage with traditional English seaside resort thrills.


Get in[edit]
By road[edit]
The A149 is an 85-mile-long coastal road that stretches from King's Lynn to Great Yarmouth. The road runs directly around the border of the town, with the B1161 (or "Oasis Way") leading off into the centre. A scenic and enjoyable route, though difficult for HGVs at places.
It is also possible to reach Hunstanton by North Beach Rd from the neighbouring village of Heacham. However, be aware that this is a narrow gravel road with no markings and is prone to flooding in poor weather conditions.

By train[edit]
Although without a station of its own since 1969, Hunstanton is connected directly to King's Lynn railway station by numerous bus services, including the Norfolk Green 10/11 and Coasthopper.

By bicycle[edit]
Two long distance cycle paths both passing 2 miles S of town:

 National Cycle Route 1. (section called the Norfolk Coast Cycleway)   (updated Jun 2017)
52.71980.67861 Peddars Way Cycle Route.   (updated Jun 2017)
On foot[edit]
 Norfolk Coast Path. A long distance footpath running from the town to Sea Palling but also linking to the Peddlars Way long distance footpath   (updated Jun 2017)
Get around[edit]
52°56′21″N 0°29′39″EMap of Hunstanton
The Hunstanton area is relatively small and therefore there is only really the need to walk. To get to other villages, the Coasthopper bus is recommended.

See[edit]
52.94980.4931 The Red & White cliffs. This famous, unique geological phenomenon that stretches from the new town into the old village beaches is a true 'postcard picture' place. Good for fossil hunters. Watch out for fulmars that nest in the cliffs.
