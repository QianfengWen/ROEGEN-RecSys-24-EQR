Yogyakarta — despite the official spelling, the name is usually pronounced and not uncommonly written Jogjakarta or just Jogja (JOG-jah) — is a major tourist destination in Java, Indonesia. It is the capital of Yogyakarta Special Region, to the south of Central Java province.


Understand[edit]
Jogja is a great base for visiting Borobudur, the world's largest Buddhist structure
Prambanan, the masterpiece of Javanese Hinduism
Bank Indonesia Building
Yogyakarta is a bustling town of some 375,000 people (2020) and the most popular tourist destination on Java, largely thanks to its proximity to the temples of Borobudur and Prambanan. The city is a centre of art and education, offers some good shopping and has a wide range of tourist facilities. It is named after the city of Ayodhya in India, where Rama, an avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu is said to have had his capital, and whose rule is considered by Hindus to be the epitome of good governance and a moral society.

The city (kota) of Yogyakarta is one of five districts in the semi-autonomous province of Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta (DIY), the "Yogyakarta Special Region". The other districts are the regencies of:

Sleman on the slopes of fiery Mount Merapi to the north
Bantul all the way to the sea to the south
The hills of Gunung Kidul to the east
The lowlands of Kulon Progo to the West
This special status is thanks to the Sultanate of Hamengkubuwono, which has ruled the area since 1749 and steered the state through difficult times of occupation and revolution. During the Indonesian war of independence, Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX offered the fledgeling Indonesian government his enclave as a capital city. Yogyakarta became the revolutionary capital of the republic from 1946 to 1949 when Jakarta was still occupied by the Dutch. As a result, the newly-independent Indonesia appointed the Sultan as the governor of the province of DIY — the only one in Indonesia that is not elected directly by the people. The Indonesian central government has tried to weaken the sultan's power by calling for direct elections for the governor. The present sultan, Hamengkubuwono X, was chosen by an overwhelming majority.
Yogyakarta lies in one of the most seismically active parts of Java and has been repeatedly struck by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The worst in recent times was the earthquake of 27 May 2006, which killed over 6,000 people and flattened over 300,000 houses. The epicentre was 25 km (16 mi) south of the city, which avoided the worst of the quake. A very effective disaster recovery effort repaired most of the physical damage quickly.
Yogyakarta is full of domestic tourists during school holidays, with tourist buses on the visitor hotspots of shopping street Jl Malioboro and the northern palace square, or alun-alun, trapped in heavy traffic. Vehicles, parking and vendors contribute to the traffic jams.

Tourist information[edit]
There are three information offices, one at the airport, one at the main railway station, and this main one:

A small but busy, mostly domestic hub; it only serves domestic propeller planes to Bandung, Denpasar, and Surabaya. There is a tourist information desk and ATMs in the arrival hall.   (updated Mar 2020)
Getting into the city[edit]
Since Adisucipto International Airport is closer to the city centre, there are numerous possibilities to get into the city:

By bus[edit]
TransJogja bus 1A goes to the main Tugu train station and Jl Malioboro for Rp3,500. Buy the ticket at the bus stop.
By taxi[edit]
Airport taxis cost around Rp50,000 depending on destination. Pay at the desk in the arrival terminal and head for the rank. Give the receipt to your driver, there is no need for any additional payment. It is about half the price to use a taxi dropping passengers off at the departure terminal — insist on using the meter. Expect to pay the Rp2,000 airport entrance fee, even though this has already been paid by the previous passenger on the way in.

By rail[edit]
Take the KRL commuter train[dead link] that runs between Surakarta and Jogja, from Maguwo station, a few minutes' walk from airport arrivals. In Yogyakarta, the train calls at the main Tugu station, just off Jl Malioboro, and Lempuyangan station. In Solo, it calls at Balapan and Purwosari stations.

Ride-hailing services[edit]
You can use ride-hailing apps to get picked up but you will be picked up outside the airport in front of the Class I Immigration Office on Jl Solo, an eight-minute walk from the terminal.

By train[edit]

Get around[edit]
7°48′21″S 110°21′51″EMap of Yogyakarta

Yogyakarta is a relatively small city, so travelling around town should not be too expensive. If you are travelling on foot, a street sign facing you at a corner indicates the name of the street you are entering, not the cross street.

By bus[edit]
TransJogja Bus Stop
Medium and small buses are the main public transport in Yogyakarta.
The TransJogja rapid transit system operates from 05:30 to 21:30 and stops only at designated shelters. They are air-conditioned and generally safe. Tickets can be bought at the kiosks, and the cost for a single trip is Rp3,600. You can buy regular trip cards which cut the per trip cost to Rp3,000, and allow transit to other shelters. Get a free route map for the TransJogja buses at the Tourist Information Centre on Jl Malioboro.
Buses other than TransJogja normally operate 06:00 to 17:00, or 21:00 for some long routes. The cost for a single trip is Rp3,000 regardless of distance (within the city). Usually on a bus there will be a driver and a helper who will hang from the side of the bus and handle money and try to attract passengers. The helper will usually tap you on the shoulder to indicate you should pay him. If there is no helper you can pay the driver directly.  When you are ready to get off a bus, tell the driver or helper "kiri" (KIH-ree) which means left.

By car or motorbike[edit]
There are several car and motorbike rental agencies just outside Tugu Station, on the street that runs east-west just south of the station. A car or motorbike delivery and pick-up at the airport remain the best way to rent them.
Driving a car in Indonesia is never a rewarding experience. But for those that would like to, a Toyota Avanza or Daihatsu Xenia (6 passengers) can be rented for around Rp250,000-300,000 for 24 hours, or Rp175,000-225,000 for 12 hours. A new green car, Toyota Agya or Daihatsu Ayla, can be rented for Rp150,000 for 24 hours. Most of the companies will ask you for the driving licence and ID cards for security reasons.
Renting a car with a driver is a more relaxing proposition. A driver will cost an additional Rp50,000-200,000 a day. The cost of a car with a driver may vary depending on whether fuel is included for a set distance or for the whole itinerary. Prices are always subject to negotiation and may increase or decrease due to local demand, type and age of vehicle and your individual requirements at the time. The normal rates (not the high season/peak season) will be around Rp450,000-500,000 per 12 hours' service.
A near new semi-automatic (clutchless) motorbike can be rented for Rp60,000 per 24 hours; older bikes may come for less, and fully automatic bikes such as a Honda Vario or Yamaha Mio may sometimes cost Rp5,000-10,000 more. Many roads outside Yogyakarta are unpaved, especially around the Mount Merapi area, so many motorcycle rentals offer a semi-offroad automatic bike with a daily fee around Rp75,000.

By taxi[edit]
Yogyakarta's taxis are metered and most drivers are trustworthy. All taxis have a flagfall of Rp7,000 for the first kilometre and then Rp4,250 for every subsequent kilometre. Most trips around the centre should not cost more than Rp20,000. If you find a driver you feel comfortable with, ask for their mobile number so next time you need to travel you can call him directly. Most drivers are more than happy to do this.

By ojek[edit]
Motorcycle taxis are widespread. They usually gather at designated spots (pangkalan), where you will haggle your way to a ride. Not comfortable or convenient for carrying luggage, but quicker if the traffic is heavy.
Nowadays, organized ojek are strong competitors to taxis and ojek pangkalan. Pickup is free and you pay according to the printout from the meter. No haggling. Try:

 O'jack motorbike taxi, Jl Dr Sardjito 11, Jogja; Rumah Makan Ny Suharti, Jl Solo 208 (Janti flyover), ☏ +62 811 307-0707, +62 852 1007-0707, +62 274 700-0707, +62 274 970-7707. Rp2,000 per kilometer. (updated Nov 2022)
Disability ojeks are also available in Yogyakarta. The system is run by disabled persons, including the drivers. Using motorcycles with sidecars, the can carry a person with a wheelchair. Spacious enough, so two slim non-disabled people can also use it. Try:

 Difa City Tour and Transport, ☏ +62 823 2801-6326. Rp20,000 for the first 5 km and Rp2,500 for each subsequent kilometer. (updated Nov 2017)
By ride-hailing[edit]
You can request car or motorbike rides with ride-hailing apps such as Gojek, Grab and Maxim. They are typically cheaper than taxis, have short waiting times in the central area, and are mostly straightforward to use; however, expect very little English from most drivers. When you request a car or motorbike using one of these apps, it's handy to have an Indonesian speaker to help you communicate with the driver, or learn some of the keywords and phrases used in this situation. See the Indonesian phrasebook.

By becak[edit]
Muscle-powered transport: becak
Three-wheeled pedal-powered trishaws or pedicabs, known as becak (BAY-cha'), can be found in most parts of Yogyakarta, for shortish journeys (remember there is some poor guy pedalling away behind you). Haggle furiously before getting in. Be sure to determine whether the price is for a one-way or return (pulang) trip and if you want the driver to wait while you conduct your shopping or business. The journey from within the city to the Malioboro shopping precinct should not cost more than Rp10,000.

By andong[edit]
The two-wheeled horse-drawn carriage is still found in Jogja. While happy to do a tourist jaunt, they are mostly used by the Jogjanese for shortish trips around their neighbourhoods, to and from the market, for example. There is also a "Grab Andong" service which you can order via the app and can be ordered along the Malioboro area.

On foot[edit]
As in the rest of Indonesia, walking in Jogja is probably one of the least convenient and least popular ways of transport, with two remarkable exceptions:

Jalan Malioboro, with its vibrant street life, colourful shop facades, large walkways and street artists;
The charming Kampung Taman Sari neighborhood containing the remains of the Taman Sari Water Castle.
See[edit]
The bird market
Being one of the oldest cities in Indonesia, Yogyakarta has many heritage buildings and monuments and the centre was listed as a  UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2023.
The number one must-see attraction is Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono's palace, better known as Kraton Ngayogyakarta. Near the palace are a number of other heritage buildings : the BNI '46 building, the Central Post Office and Bank Indonesia.
Other notable landmarks and attractions are:

-7.8003110.36651 Benteng Vredeburg (Vredeburg Fort), Jl Jenderal Ahmad Yani No.6, ☏ +62 274 586934, +62 274 510996. A Dutch fort in front of Gedung Agung (the President's Palace). A great example of Dutch colonial architecture. A few military items are presented, including a twin cannon. Closed for renovation until May 2024 by Indonesian Heritage Agency.   (updated Apr 2024)
-7.78694110.3752 Kotabaru. The Dutch officials' residential area has some heritage homes, a colonial style church, monastery (Gereja Kotabaru), and a stadium (Stadion Kridosono).  (updated Nov 2017)
-7.8283110.39983 Kotagede. The capital of the ancient Islamic Mataram kingdom. The tomb of its first king, Panembahan Senopati, is here in the royal graveyard. Before independence, Kotagede was Jogja's economic centre, as it had the largest market and was home to many wealthy batik merchants. Some of the older buildings have been modernised or replaced with newer buildings, but Kotagede remains a prime example of Javanese architecture and city structure. Check out the local silver handicrafts. 
-7.782903110.3669684 Tugu Monument. A downtown landmark. Built by Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono VI, the spire was originally a sphere representing the universe. During the colonial era, the spire was replaced with a golden cylinder. 
The Kraton[edit]
The Sultan's palace or Kraton encompasses the main palace, the sultan's residential buildings, two alun-alun (palace squares), and a large residential area where the sultan's servants used to live.

At night, the 'alun-alun' is ablaze with the lights of decorated chariots
-7.804153110.3643665 Northern alun-alun (Alun-alun utara). Built for training the Sultan's army, it was opened to the public during the reign of Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX. Now used for the quarterly Garebeg parade held in the months of Maulud, Besar and Sawal, according to the Javanese calendar. In the parade, the Sultan's servants carry huge cone-shaped offerings to the alun-alun. After the parade, attendees scramble to get a scrap of the offering as it is believed to bring good luck. Prior to the month of Maulud, a popular public fair is held here for 30 days, offers many kinds of goods from traditional handicrafts to Chinese ceramics. A snack associated with the fair is the doughnut-like galundeng. On weekend or holiday nights, pedal cars decorated with lights (gowes) can be hired to make a circuit of the square. 
-7.80577110.3641126 Kraton Yogyakarta. Sa-Th 08:00–13:00, F 08:00–11:00. A calm and elegant example of Javanese heritage with two separate entrances; the Main Court (Pagilaran and Siti Hinggil) and the Residence. The Main Court showcases the grandeur of the Sultan's monarchy, while the Residence is more homely, showcasing the royal family's luxurious lifestyle. There are regular free performances of music and dance. Check out the times when you arrive in Yogajakarta. (Every Sunday at 11:00 as of Oct 2015). There are three gamelans in the palace, and the pavilion nearest the entrance houses one of them. If it is being played, feel free to take a seat and enjoy it for a while. Residence museum has both Indonesian and English texts, and AC. Temporary exhibition Mar-Aug 2024 on Abhimantra or life rites of passage (part where no photo allowed). Small exhibition on the history of tea in Indonesia too (Indonesian text only). Without guide, no map or sign to help explore the larger grounds. The Residence: Rp25,000 (non-Indonesian resident) or Rp10,000 (Indonesian resident), Rp1,000 extra for a photo. You might be offered a trip to the 'sultan's servants' batik workshop'. This is a scam that will only bring you to a regular batik shop with inflated prices. (updated Apr 2024)
-7.805478110.3626797 Carriage Museum (Museum Kereta). Houses the Sultan's horse-drawn carriages, including two beautiful carriages imported from the Netherlands and known as Golden Carriages (kereta kencana). Foreigners: adult Rp30,000, child Rp25,000; domestic: adult Rp20,000, children Rp15,000. (updated Apr 2024)
-7.810033110.3590728 Water Castle (Taman Sari), Jl Taman, Kraton. daily 09:00–15:00. This is a partly-ruined complex built as a pleasure garden by the first Sultan in 1765. One of the bathing pools was dedicated to the sultan's harem, and he had a tower overlooking the area so he could take his pick. Towards the back is the original entrance to the pools, a small dock connected to a long-since-vanished river; a bit of snooping beyond this entrance will get you to a back street, where one can visit a fascinating network of tunnels and rooms, including an Escher-like series of interlacing staircases over what looks like a disused well. Foreigners adult Rp25,000, child 20,000, domestic adult 15,000, children 10,000. Photo session like prewedding Rp150,000-500,000. Entrance fee does not cover the guide, who will expect tips.   (updated Apr 2024)
Wayang kulit (shadow puppet show)
Siti Hinggil Selatan. This somehow-muted palace is rarely used for forml occasions. You can catch a shadow puppet performance during weekend mornings and nights. There is no admission charge for the show and you can come and go as you please, which you may well want to do as the show is long and somewhat difficult to follow if you do not speak Indonesian.
Also worth seeing is the prince's palace to the SE of the main palace.

-7.8039110.36259 Masjid Gede Kauman. One of the oldest and largest mosques in Yogyakarta. Located on the west of Alun-alun Utara, this mosque was where the Sultan performs his religious rites and ceremonies. (updated Nov 2017)
Yogyakarta was designed so that the main elements of the city form an imaginary line. This straight line starts from Parangtritis on the coast, through the Kraton and Tugu Monument, and finally to Mount Merapi. This represents the Sultan's strong relationship with the guardian spirits of Mount Merapi and the ocean at Parangtritis.

Museums[edit]
-7.8023110.3639410 Sonobudoyo Museum (Museum Sonobudoyo), Jl Trikora No.6 (by the northern alun-alun), ☏ +62 274 76775, +62 274 373617, fax: +62 274 385664.

Museum has both Indonesian and English texts. Museum: foreigners Rp20,000, adult Rp10,000, children Rp5,000; performances: foreigners Rp50,000, domestic Rp20,000.   (updated Apr 2024)

Do[edit]
Horse-drawn carriage rides — traditional horse-drawn carriages, the four-wheeled andhong and the two-wheeled horsecart call dokar, wait for tourists outside hotspots like the train station, the Kraton and Mal Malioboro. Haggle furiously. The traditional route is from Jl Malioboro to the Kraton. Andhong often want to take you to shop for fake Dagadu t-shirts at hefty prices in Ngasem. The cost for a round trip is about Rp20,000. They usually ask for Rp30,000 but may settle for less. While andhong primarily serve the tourist market, dokar are used more generally by the Jogjanese but are still happy to give you a tourist jaunt. Andhong can hold up to five adults, while a dokar will take about two only.
Masangin (masuk antara dua beringin, passing between the two banyan trees) — you can play this simple, fun game on the southern alun-alun. Participants are blindfolded and must walk straight between the two ancient banyan trees. It sounds easy but most participants usually fail.
Reflexology — achieve soothing experience by having a short reflexology massage. One of the hippest among Jogjanese.
Street chess— when it's quiet, particularly around the end of Jalan Malioboro near the Kraton, the becak drivers will play chess on the street with large wooden sets. You are welcome to challenge them and it's fun. This is how they pass the time between fares, so some play for several hours each day - you'll be up against some stiff competition. Don't offer or accept any bets on the outcome - it takes the fun out of a good way to interact with the locals and pass the time.
Sunday morning on the university boulevard — every Sunday, the main boulevard in the Gadjah Mada university campus is thronged with students, joggers and martial arts enthusiasts. Get there between 07:00-09:00 for a bit of exercise. After that, replace the calories you lost by sampling the foods from the many stalls. The choice includes opor ayam' (chicken curry with rice cake), bubur ayam (rice porridge with chicken), 'siomay (fish dumplings) and sate ambal (chicken satay with tempeh sauce). Don't forget to check the flea market nearby.
Yoga & meditation — widely available including:
 Balance Mind-Body-Soul, Jalan Cendrawasih 36, Demangan Baru, ☏ +62 274 742 7925, +62 274 566717. daily classes

To get the best price, visit a gallery where they grade the quality of the pieces, usually using a scale from A-Z. Prices range from Rp50,000 for A (small student paintings), to Rp1,000,000 for Z paintings (usually large pieces done by master artists). You may be able to haggle an extra 25% off the marked price. Beware shops which buy and resell the paintings, marking up the prices for Z-level artwork to Rp8,000,000 — this is massively overpriced.

Eat[edit]




Sweet & chilli cuisine
It's not a big secret to Indonesian people that Yogyakarta people adore sweet foods. The local dish known as gudeg, for example, is distinctively sweet in flavor. Local snacks, such as bakpia and yangko, are extremely sweet. However, not every local dish is sweet. Krecek—the orange-ish fried beef often served with gudeg—is challengingly hot for the untrained tongue. Lodeh made by the locals, though often considered 'too sweet' by other Indonesians, also has a hint of a fiery chili taste. It's a good idea to ask the food vendor whether the dish is hot or not. For those who are just curious, simply ask them to omit the chilli from the dish and serve it separately. This way you can still taste the original flavor of the dish, but add the chili only if you want it.


Yogyakarta food used to be known for its sweetness. However, as more and more people move to Jogja, the city starts seeing more diversity in flavor. Now you can find many kinds of interesting dishes, from sweet, spicy, to fiery. Sometimes a fusion from other cuisines such as Chinese or Western can be found. Since the influx of people from around the country, you can find some restaurants and cafes that open until 23:00 in the centre.
If you want to eat the traditional way, head to Malioboro for a lesehan dinner in front of the closed shophouses, similar to the Japanese eating style on a tatami, but you sit on a mat and eat with your hands (you can ask for cutlery though). The food is ready to serve, — vegetables, fried and grilled meat (satay, seafood) are the most common, served with white rice. You can also order traditional gudeg. While this is a favorite among locals for the mingle for hours, do not expect very cheap prices.

Local delicacies[edit]
The following dishes are recommended:

Gudeg, a sweet and dry curry of jackfruit, chicken and egg served with rice, and the most famous local dish. Goopy slop in various shades of brown, the stuff does not look particularly appetizing, but it can be tasty if done right. There are many gudeg restaurants, but the most popular are: Gudeg Wijilan, Gudeg Juminten, Gudeg Bu Tjitro, Gudeg Tugu, Gudeg Bu Ahmad. If you can wake up early in the morning, you may find small stalls serving Gudeg just at the corner of the street, or close to traditional markets. If you can't sleep at night, you can go to Jalan Janturan and enjoy the Gudeg Pawon (enjoying gudeg inside the old style kitchen) that open in late night. Due to the heavy fiber content of young jackfruit and the thick coconut milk, those who have a weak stomach may have trouble with gudeg.
Ayam geprek, the original can be found just outside the city limit at Ayam Geprek Bu Rum, deep-fried chicken with crispy batter which is then crushed under pestle along with chili peppers, salt, and garlic and served with rice. Various side dish can be added to the chicken such as grated cheddar, fried eggplant, tempeh, or tofu.
Oseng mercon, spicy stir fried beef and offal.
Brongkos, sweet beef and bean in a keluak nut soup.
Enthok slenget, spicy muscovy duck soup.
Nasi langgi, locally known as sego langgi (langgi rice). Warm rice served with various side dishes. Can be found in small stall in Gandekan St.
Kipo, bite-size snacks made of green tapioca dough filled with sweetened grated coconut. Can be found in Kotagede.
Bakpia, another bite-size snack made from sweetened green bean paste wrapped with thin dough pastry. The most popular bakpia is known as Bakpia Patuk, which not surprisingly, are sold in Pathuk street, also known as Jl. Aip K.S. Tubun.
Jadah tempe, sandwich of rice cake and sweet beancake. Can be found in Kaliurang.
Es rujak or rujak es krim, a fruit salad made from mangos, papayas, apples, pineapples, cucumbers etc., mixed with palm sugar, lime juice, salt, chillies and (of course) ice cream (es krim). All flavours (sweet, sour, bitter, spicy, salty) in one plate. In case you are at UGM campus, have a look along Jalan Kaliurang. Small foodstalls sell es rujak there (only very late morning to early afternoon). If you are not close to UGM, keep your eyes open.
Budget[edit]




Pasar Tiban Kauman
During the Ramadan fasting season, the local residents at Kauman area open a temporary market selling many kinds of appetizing snacks and dishes. This market is not only great for sampling local foods, but also great for experiencing old architecture as it is set on a long pathway of a classic Javanese neighborhood. It opens at around 15:00 and closes at 18:00, as the foods are meant to be eaten for breaking the fasting at dusk. Consuming the food in the area before dusk, even if you are not fasting, is considered inappropriate. Kauman means the place for preachers since it is in the same block of the Masjid Agung (the sultan's royal mosque). It was home to many Islamic leaders such as Ahmad Dahlan, the founder of the mainstream Muhammadiyah movement.

Stay safe[edit]
Jogja has its share of petty crime like pickpocketing, especially in city buses and along Jalan Malioboro when crowded.
Watch out for gallery scams and street sellers trying to get a commission for batik. These tend to occur around the Kraton and Malioboro areas. Scammers will approach tourists and tell them about a government art centre and will hire cheap transport to the 'genuine' gallery. If you're interested in buying batik, this isn't necessarily bad, but you are, in essence, being manipulated. These scams mainly occur on Jalan Malioboro. They have people waiting on the streets approaching foreigners, even if you're with a local companion. General rule of thumb is if they're approaching you in English, they're trying to get something out of you.
Be cautious when walking in the city. Traffic is brutal! You might have difficulty crossing roads and streets, especially in crowded places. Pavements, even where they exist, are in poor condition, and signs over the pavement hang lower than head height for many foreigners, so watch your feet and your head. At night, street lighting will usually be poor, making it even harder.
Mount Merapi volcano looms over the city. The last eruption was in May 2018, spewing ashes about 6km high. Although it wasn't as big and destructive as in 2010.
Try to travel in groups if going to or from Parangtritis beach. The long stretch between Jogja and the beach can be dangerous at night. You may get stopped by someone riding a motorcycle trying to rob you. There are few police stations along the road, and often unoccupied.
Never swim at Parangtritis beach due to strong rip currents.

North[edit]
The massive Buddhist temple of Borobudur, the largest Buddhist monument in the world, is 40 minutes away by car and one of the main drawcards for visitors to Yogyakarta. Many tour buses (minivans) leave Yogyakarta at 05:00 for an early visit to Borobudur. This is a convenient way to skip the crowds which arrive mid morning, although a little more expensive: Rp45,000-50,000 (including a simple breakfast). However, the extra cost could save you money if tour participants chip in for a tour guide.
Gereja Ayam (Chicken Church). Near Magelang. In response to what he claimed was a divine vision in 1988, Daniel Alamsjah, a devout Christian, spent every weekend over nearly a decade overseeing the construction of this multi-dominical bird-shaped prayer house. Alamsjah’s vision had been of a dove, but the its resemblance to a giant chicken has earned it its better-known moniker, Gereja Ayam – Chicken Church. Alamsjah ran out of funds in 2000 to complete it and left it to fall into decay. However over the next 15 years, curious visitors to nearby Borobudur began seeking it out. Increasing visitor numbers encouraged Alamsjah to return and begin work on completing the structure. The interior has been decorated in a style that may not be to everyone’s taste. From the parking lot it is 15 minute walk up a steep hill to the building (for which it is advisable to bring closed footwear). Shuttle rides are offered up the hill but these can be expensive. It is often included  in tours to Borobodur. Open daily 05:00 to 16:30. The entrance fee is Rp30,000 (+ Rp10,000 parking fees for a car).
Kaliurang in Sleman Regency is the closest settlement on the southern slope of Mount Merapi. One reason to visit this town is the Ullen Sentalu Museum, an exotic museum dedicated to the culture and life of Javanese royalty. The museum is built into the surrounding landscape, with gardens, sculptures and an overall tranquil and natural environment. There is also a colonial-themed restaurant in the grounds called Beukenhof.
Ketep Pass, a pass located in the slope between Mount Merapi and Mount Merbabu offers a great vantage point for a spectacular view of both mountains. This site has a small cinema that regularly shows an interesting documentary of Mount Merapi. East of Borobudur, 40 minutes from Yogyakarta by car.
Salatiga, about 2½ hours from Yogyakarta, is closer to Semarang (1 hour) than Yogyakarta. Salatiga is a mountain resort town with several good resort-style spa hotels mainly aimed at people looking for a tranquil and relaxing escape from the city life. Activities in Salatiga include trying the famous "ronde" drink and Havana horses.
East[edit]
The Hindu temples of Prambanan, 20 minutes away, are a close second to Borobudur.  The smaller temples of Kalasan and others are on the way to Prambanan. The entrance to Borobundur or Prambanan Temple costs Rp362,500 each.
The city of Surakarta aka Solo, a 45-min drive (also accessible with the Prambanan Ekspres train or the Joglosemar bus — see #Get in) to the east is Yogya's royal twin and home to two royal kingdoms that are ancestrally related to Yogyakarta's Kingdom. The city's royal past is indicated through the two major keraton or palaces that are able to visited: the sprawling Keraton Kasunanan Surakarta, where the Pakubuwono kings live and the smaller but equally grand Pura Mangkunegaran palace, seat of Prince Mangkunegara. It is also a thriving arts and cultural center, home to the biggest batik manufacturers in Indonesia, and the Danar Hadi Batik Museum, which has the most diverse batik collection in Indonesia. Last but not least Solo offers a wealth of culinary experiences such as timlo (meat soup), its own soto or the fabled serabi (Javanese pancakes).
Ratu Boko palace, 2 km south of Prambanan. An ancient royal palace complex, similar in architectural layout with other Kratons or palaces in Java. Magnificently located on top of a hill, Ratu Boko has been restored.
South[edit]
Parangtritis, on the south coast, is one of the better known black sand beaches. Local folklore suggests that this beach is the palace of the legendary Nyai Loro Kidul or 'Queen of the South'. It is common knowledge among locals not to wear anything green in color, or the Queen will entice the wearer into the ocean to drown. Warning: Never swim at Parangtritis beach. Its wild waves are known to be deadly (rip currents): many people have died who ignored these precautions. There are also other beaches with white sands, but you have to arrange with a travel agent to rent a car with the driver as their locations are quite remote (2 hours from the city centre) in the hilly Gunung Kidul region. These beaches are pristine and sometimes off-the-beaten-path, such as Kukup beach, Krakal beach, Drini, Sundak beach and Baron, but the swimming warning still applies.
Ngobaran Beach at Gunung Kidul region, 50 km from Yogyakarta. This is a pure beach with a number of marine attractions to explore. When the tide is low in the morning, the visitors can join the local fishermen to collect seaweed or go fishing for stranded fish between the reefs at the beach. Some believe that somewhere in the beach lie the remains of King Brawijaya's fort and his men “Sabdo Palon Ngoyogenggong”. This beach includes a cave, which leads its explorers to a striking underground stream. If you go to Ngrenehan Beach for the grilled fish just drop by Ngobaran Beach, it has a high cliff and is around 2 km from Ngrenehan Beach. Many sea animal species are present in the coral reef and inter-tidal zones, ranging from sea urchin, starfish, to various types of cockleshells.
Ngrenehan Beach at Kanigoro Village, Saptosari. (about 30 km south of Wonosari). A small bay surrounded by rocky hills that has fascinating panorama and swirling waves hitting the white sandy beach and rocky edge of the hills. The local fishermen can prepare fresh or grilled fish for visitors.
West[edit]
Jakarta — The Argo Lawu train makes the 7-hr train ride.
