Go north to Santa Maria, the largest city in Santa Barbara County.
Guadalupe - This small town is located 30 miles north of Lompoc and is primarily focused on agriculture and oil production.  Travelers will enjoy visiting the neighboring Guadaulpe-Nipomo Dunes, an 18-mile stretch of beach that is one of the largest remaining natural dune areas in California.  The Ten Commandments was filmed in the dunes and the sets were buried after production, but today blowing winds repeatedly reveal and then re-cover these reproductions of ancient Egypt.
Buellton - Located 18 miles to the east, Buellton is home to several Santa Ynez Valley wineries.  Visitors will also find the ostrich & emu farm interesting, with the opportunity to get up close and personal with the giant birds.
