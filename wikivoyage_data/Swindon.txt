Swindon is a large town in Wiltshire, south west England, that is known for its railway-town heritage and links with the British railway system in which it played a central part during the 19th and 20th centuries. Swindon hosts a railway museum in a restored railway works building, and a volunteer-run heritage railway


Understand[edit]
Swindon has a fast-growing population of around 220,000 in its urban area in 2021, making it one of the largest towns in the UK to be without city status. Swindon is known for being a regional centre for business, and is home to many technological and pharmaceutical companies, as well as having national headquarters for international companies Nationwide, Intel, and Zurich. The town is also a regional retail and leisure hub of which it boasts several facilities. 
Swindon continues to be an economically attractive town, with an ever-growing private, knowledge-intensive sector. This is aided by the town’s central location, in close proximity to other regional powerhouses such as Reading, Bristol, and Oxford.
The town has always suffered with a poorer reputation and outlook from those living outside Swindon, particularly regarding the town centre, of which has suffered due to several decades of under-investment and a failing to compete against neighbouring towns and cities, of which have benefited from inward investment. However, as of 2021, several regeneration projects are underway in the town centre, including a £30m upgrade to the town’s major bus station and central business district. A further £80m is being invested in creating a new cultural quarter on a large brownfield site adjacent to the existing central bus station, known as Kimmerfields.  
As mentioned, Swindon also has a strong railway heritage and was home to the extensive Great Western Railway works in the 19th century, the site of which is still standing today as a designer outlet shopping centre. This introduction of industry led to a boom in the town’s population and ultimately led Swindon to become the larger town it is these days.

History[edit]
The town began its existence as a Saxon village, and it is likely that its name is derived from the Saxon words swine dun or swines down, possibly meaning "pig hill".  The small hilltop village subsequently expanded around the site of a quarry, with a 19th-century canal facilitating trade.
During the mid-19th century, the introduction of the Great Western Railway and the associated railway works fully transformed Swindon from a village into a thriving industrial town, which drew workers from across the United Kingdom. The older settlement on top of the hill remained independent until 1900, when it was annexed by the newer industrial town. Today it is known as Old Town and still retains a somewhat separate feel.
Swindon experienced a population boom after World War II.  New housing areas were built due to a shortage of housing in London following the mass destruction caused by the war.  This population growth has continued and the town remains one of the fastest growing urban areas in the United Kingdom and Europe.

Get around[edit]

By foot[edit]
The town centre is small enough to walk through on foot, as are the shopping areas of Old Town, the Great Western Designer Outlet Village, the Orbital Retail Park and the Shaw Ridge Leisure Park & West Swindon Shopping Centre.  Although it is a great way of seeing Swindon, it is not recommended as most attractions are more than 45 minutes walk from the centre of the town - it is advisable to travel by bus.  The attractions within 15 minutes walk of the town centre include the Steam Museum, the Railway Village, the Wyvern Theatre, the civic council offices and central Public Library, the Swindon Hydro Centre, the main bus station, the railway station, and some hotels.

By bus[edit]
Swindon has an extensive local bus network, with the vast majority of routes radiating outward from the town centre (either from the bus station or the Fleming Way bus stands).
The two main bus operators in the town are Swindon's Bus Company and Stagecoach West.
A full list of routes can be found at the Swindon Borough Council bus information website[dead link]

By bicycle[edit]
Swindon has extensive support for bikes, with paths following major roads split between pedestrians and cycles.
For more detailed information about cycle routes to and from Swindon, see the  Swindon Travel Choices website].

By car[edit]
The road network in Swindon is comprehensively signposted.  To get from one side of Swindon to the other, locals have the option of driving through town, or jumping on the motorway from junction 15 to 16.  This method of getting across Swindon has been somewhat superseded by the almost unused link between Drove Road/Wroughton and the Rushy Platt junction.

The Magic Roundabout
One of the major attractions when driving around Swindon is the Magic Roundabout, named after the 1960s television show. This sprawling junction contains five mini-roundabouts, each situated around a bigger, but less obvious, central counter-clockwise roundabout (which houses a very bright street light for night driving).  Each mini-roundabout has three junctions, two leading on to the next and previous mini-roundabout, and one acting as an entry/exit junction.  Many visitors are immediately intimidated by local drivers who use it proficiently, but the local secret is to treat each mini-roundabout as normal, rather than looking at the daunting mass of concrete and cars.
