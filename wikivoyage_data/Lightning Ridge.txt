Lightning Ridge is an opal-mining town in Northwestern New South Wales. The town still has an outback feel.  Tourism is just as big an industry for the Ridge now as mining and artists and designers now call the town home, with galleries and jewellery shops along the main street.  After a day of fossicking, mine tours, and soaking in a hot artesian bath, you can get a decent coffee, a nice dinner, good wine, and a cold beer.


Understand[edit]
Long-time residents will tell you of a time when the town was rough and lawless, populated by those in search of a fortune, or on the run.  It was home to 2,300 people in 2016.
The Lightning Ridge region provides many visual experiences that can't be had elsewhere in Australia.

Get in[edit]
0°0′0″N 0°0′0″EMap of Lightning Ridge
Lightning Ridge is easily accessible on a paved road about four kilometres east of the Castlereagh Highway, approximately 75 km north of Walgett.
There is a connecting bus service to the Dubbo XPT, that leaves the Ridge just before 6am, and arrives back in the Ridge before 7PM.  It's the best part of a day's trip into Sydney.
There is a airport around 3 km from town, with a walking and cycling path into town. Or most motels offer some kind of pick-up.  There is no scheduled passenger service, but the runway is long and sealed, and it is simple to get a charter flight if you wish.

Get around[edit]
The town has no public transport and no taxi service.  However, the Bowling Club operates a transfer service for patrons, and many of the hotels will also assist with pickups from the airport and other locations for their patrons.
You can think of the town as being the town centre, and the mining areas surrounding it.  The town centre is easily walkable, and you can stroll between the club, the art galleries, cafes, pool and artesian baths.
The mining areas start further out, and it can be hard to get to sightseeing locations outside of the town centre without a car or a tour.  There are some half-day and full-day tours available in town.
A vehicle is required to visit the many interesting out of town sightseeing locations such as Grawin with 'The Glengarry Hilton' and 'Sheepyard Inn'.

Stay safe[edit]
Be careful around mining areas as there are many deep and dangerous shafts. Take care of your children, too.
Exposure - it can be very hot there in summertime.
Avoid driving at night or dusk due to the risk of collisions with animals.  You'll see numerous kangaroos even on the roads close to town.
Cope[edit]
The artesian bore water that comes from many of the taps is safe but tastes awful.  Drink rainwater if you can find it, or bottled water if you can't.
