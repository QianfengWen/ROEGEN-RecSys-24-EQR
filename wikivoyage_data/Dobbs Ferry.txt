Get around[edit]
Map of Dobbs Ferry

Best to park or take the train here and walk around the waterfront and historic downtown on foot. You can also travel very quickly to or through town on Broadway, the same Broadway that goes all the way to the southern tip of Manhattan.

See[edit]
The village offers gorgeous views of the Hudson River from various viewpoints downtown and up in the hills, including the edge of the New Jersey Palisades. The waterfront is a wide expanse of grass, barbecue pits and a playground for relaxing and enjoying the sun. You can see the tall skyscrapers of Manhattan from the water's edge. There are lots of cute shops downtown for window shopping or actual purchasing. Walk the Croton Aqueduct trail for spying on gorgeous homes and estates of all times and architecture.

Do[edit]
Old Croton Aqueduct, typical section of trail
 Old Croton Aqueduct. Go hiking or biking on the aqueduct's trailway. The original water supply to New York City is now a walking trail that runs from Croton-on-Hudson in the north to Yonkers in the south. Over the 180 years since it was built, portions have disappeared from the downtown areas of other river towns, but remains mostly intact in Dobbs Ferry. Cary's Pharmacy at 105 Main St., ☏ +1 914 693-0008, sells maps of the trail. When the aqueduct was in service, it was monitored by a series of overseers. The last of the overseer's houses, dubbed the Keeper's House, still stands beside the trail in Dobbs Ferry.
