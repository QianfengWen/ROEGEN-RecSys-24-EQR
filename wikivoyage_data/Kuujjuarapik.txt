Kuujjuarapik (Inuktitut: ᑰᔾᔪᐊᕌᐱᒃ) and neighbouring Whapmagoostui are twin villages with a total of about 1800 people (2021) in Nunavik in the far north of Quebec. Kuujjuarapik sits at the mouth of the Grande-Baleine River on the coast of Hudson Bay.


Understand[edit]
Kuujjuarapik is the southernmost Inuit village in Nunavik. The neighbouring Whapmagoostui is predominantly Cree.
Kuujjuarapik means "Little great river" in Inuktitut. It refers to the community at the mouth of the Great Whale River. The Cree community name Whapmagoostui means "where there are whales". Previously, these two villages were collectively referred to as "Great Whale River" in English and "Poste-de-la-Baleine" in French.
