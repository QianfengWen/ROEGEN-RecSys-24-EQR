Pembroke's main street from the castle.
Pembroke (Welsh: Penfro) is the traditional county town of Pembrokeshire in south-west Wales. However, the administrative centre and de facto county town is Haverfordwest.  The town and the county derive their name from that of the cantref, or medieval land division, of Penfro: in Welsh, Pen = "head" or "end", and bro = "region", "country", "land", and so the town's name means essentially "Land's End". Interestingly, the name for Land's End in the Cornish language (which is related to Welsh) is Penn an Wlas or Pedn an Wlas.

As part of the walk, you will see a terrace of 3 Georgian townhouses on Main Street: 

51.67442-4.9112341 Penfro (No. 111). Penfro was built as the townhouse for a rich local landowner, John Campbell. This is the man who created the wonderful Bosherston Lily Lakes on the Stackpole Estate. This house is one of the most beautiful and authentic houses in Wales, even most of the front windows are original. In the cornerstone at the front is one of the first stamp machines, which was discovered when refurbishment took place about 20 years ago. (updated Dec 2023)
