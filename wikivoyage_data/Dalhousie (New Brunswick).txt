Dalhousie[dead link] is a town of 3,500 people (2011) on the Acadian Coast of New Brunswick. The town is at the mouth of the Restigouche River on the Bay of Chaleur, known for its snowfall in the winters and as a secret summer paradise. Tourists are surprised at the long stretches of natural beaches and scenic vistas.


Understand[edit]

Until 2008, the economy was dominated by the forestry industry, namely a large pulp and paper mill spanning the waterfront along the Restigouche River. When the mill closed, the economy of the town faced uncertainty during the post-industrial adjustment. Hundreds of people were left without work in the local economy and some were forced to move. This was followed by the closure of a  chemical processing plant on the western edge of the town, the railway spur into the town, and a generating station. While there are several smaller employers, the largest employer in the town is a nursing home.
It was named after the 9th Earl of Dalhousie, who was then the governor of Upper Canada and Lower Canada.
Dalhousie is the most northern point in New Brunswick, and thus is in the Maritime provinces. It is in the Restigouche River valley at the tongue of the river where it discharges into Chaleur Bay. The valley lies in a hilly region, part of the Appalachian mountain range, although the Dalhousie town site is on a hill side several decameters above sea level with some development to its south on a low ridge of approximately 260 metres elevation. The town is surrounded by salt and fresh water bodies, which are home to many species of wildlife, unique birds, and fish. The area is rich in natural resources.

History[edit]
The Eel River Bar First Nation, adjacent to Dalhousie, is home to many Micmac natives, who were the original residents of the region. Dalhousie was settled by Europeans beginning in 1800. Some Acadians displaced in the Great Upheaval also settled in Dalhousie, and there is still a very close balance between anglophones and francophones.
In 1825 the Great Miramichi Fire raged through central New Brunswick and into Maine, destroying the forests that were the mainstay of the province's economy. Lumbermen looked north to the great pine stands of the Nipisiguit and the Restigouche.
Dalhousie, at the mouth of the Restigouche, began to grow. Soon it was a booming town. Lumber and fishing were the main interests, although agriculture was more important in the early days than it is today.
Dalhousie was the leading town of the area until the arrival of the railway following confederation. With steep hills at its back, the Intercolonial Railway (ICR) bypassed the town while its nearby rival, Campbellton, surged ahead. That would be the situation until the late 1920s, when Dalhousie was picked as the site of a giant paper mill. The International Paper Company built what was then one of the largest newsprint mills in the world. From 1929 on, the mill dominated life in Dalhousie.
