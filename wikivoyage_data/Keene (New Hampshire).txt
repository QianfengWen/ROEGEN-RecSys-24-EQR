It has several TVs, and an outdoor seating section during the summer. 
Main Street area[edit]
The Main Street (Downtown) area of Keene hosts several bars and nightclubs.

 Kilkenny's (near the Railroad). Primarily a beer bar, Kilkenny's has several pool tables. Although it is one of the smaller bars, its drinks are fairly inexpensive, making it a common starting point for people making the rounds of the Keene bar scene or doing a crawl. However, Kilkenny's does tend to draw more locals, and has a more conservative feel. 
 Margarita's, Main Street (next to the Colonial Theater). A large Mexican restaurant. While it does serve a full range of drinks, it is mainly known for its creative, though expensive, margaritas. It has an extensive Mexican-themed menu, and outdoor seating. In addition to a restaurant section, it has a lounge area that also features a pool table. 
 Lab and Lager, Main Street. One of the newer bars in Keene. The Lap has a small outdoor seating section, and some pool tables indoors. It draws a college-aged crowd, though it is generally considered a cheap knock-off of the Railroad. Generally hosts an older, more mature crowd (30-40). 
 21 Roxbury, Roxbury St (just off Main Street). It is a martini bar with up-scale martinis and other cocktails. Its small, intimate location draws a more up-scale crowd, and is a good place for a date or a more quiet conversation.

Go next[edit]
Mount Monadnock is 12 miles to the east on NH-124 in Jaffrey.  There is a small parking lot where NH-124 crests over the mountain.  Just before Jaffrey Center, there is a sign pointing to the entrance to Monadnock State Park.  The trails from both locations lead to the summit.  Mount Monadnock is the highest mountain in southern NH and perhaps the most accessible for novice hikers, as well as being the most climbed mountain in the entire world.  No special equipment is needed to climb the mountain and it can usually be done in about four hours round trip for a healthy person.
Brattleboro, Vermont is about a 40-minute drive to via the Franklin Pierce Highway (State Route 9 West) and US Route 5 South and has even more beautiful buildings for you to look at.
