North Algona Wilberforce is a township in Renfrew County. It has about 3,000 residents (2021). In the wintertime, North Algona Wilberforce attracts many snowmobilers, cross county skiers and ice fishers. In the summer time it turns into cottage country with many lakes for canoeing, kayaking and fishing. It is a great point to launch out and take day trips out to white water rafting, explore the Bonnechere caves or visit Algonquin Park. Some of the main communities are Deacon, Golden Lake and Rankin.
