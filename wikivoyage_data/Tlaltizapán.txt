San Miguel Arcangel
Tlaltizapán is a small town in the Central Mexico state of Morelos. Historical travelers will appreciate its storied past with a 16th century monastery, a number of other historic churches, and the site of a notorious Mexican Revolution battle in which Carrancista troops committed atrocities on locals. The charming historic centro is quiet and peaceful today and is popular as a weekend getaway. It is one of Mexico's designated Pueblos Magicos. 


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Tlaltizapán is a very old town, having been originally settled long before the Aztecs built their empire in Central Mexico. The town was inhabited by a mixed race indigenous group that was related to those who originally settled Xochimilco around 900 AD. In the 14th century, Tlaltizapan was dominated by the Aztecs and paid tribute to them until the time of the Spanish conquest.
By 1535, conquistadors had arrived in Tlaltizapán, establishing several haciendas under the colonial rule with the Dominicans building churches and evangelizing the indigenous populations. One of the earliest haciendas as San Jose de Acamilpa, founded in 1604 to grow sugarcane for the production of schnapps. One of the most powerful haciendas in the area was San Miguel Treinta, built in 1732. Other colonial haciendas included Ticuman, San Francisco, and Xochimancas.
During the Mexican Revolution, Tlaltizapan was a stronghold of the Zapatista army of the south. The town suffered immensely during the Revolution when thousands of locals were killed by the Carranzista faction and thousands more fled the fighting, leading to a 60% population loss largely in 1916 when Carrancistas killed 200 locals on June 2 and another 250 on August 13 of that year along with more massacres in September.

Get in[edit]

By bus[edit]
From Cuernavaca, Pullman de Morelos operates hourly buses to the nearby town of Zacatepec. The 40-minute bus ride costs M$60 (May 2024) and takes 40 minutes. In Zacatepec, you can take a taxi the last 10 km to Tlatizapan.

Get around[edit]
The town is quite small, compact, and easy to walk around. You'll probably want a taxi to get to Las Estaces or other places that are further from the historic centro. Hotel desk staff can call a taxi for you or you can usually find them at a sitio near the Parque Central on Av. Mártires 13 de Agosto. As in most small Mexican towns, rideshare apps are rarely useful.

You might think that's a joke, or a trick question, but it's neither. The answer is that many people are buried here, though not Emiliano Zapata. The famous hero of the Mexican Revolution, specified in his will that he wanted to be buried in Tlaltizapan where many of his comrades had fallen in battle. Unfortunately, Zapata was assasinated and then buried Cuautla. Visitors can visit the mausoleum that was intended as Zapata's final resting place, though the tomb is empty. Turns out the Rolling Stones were right, you can't always get what you want. Zapata's fallen comrades who are buried here include at least 5 of his generals and Zapata's brother. Locals profess to want Zapata's remains moved to Tlaltizapan, where they belong. (updated May 2024)
