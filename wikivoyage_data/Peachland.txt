Peachland is in the Okanagan region of British Columbia. It is a small town of 5,400 permanent residents
(2016) which was incorporated in 1909.


Understand[edit]
Climate[edit]
Okanagan Lake
As most of the city is built into a mountainside, it is typically shielded from cold northerly winds and also has an overall southern exposure. This helps warm the area slightly during spring, summer and fall, but particularly in winter. Proximity to the lake results in more moderation relative to Okanagan cities which are farther away from it. Average January high temperatures in Peachland are nearly 1.5 degrees warmer than in Kelowna, while the reverse is true in July.
The city's southern orientation provides protection from winds coming from the north, while encouraging those from the south which blow across the lake directly toward the city and can cause mild lake-effect snow. The steep mountainside on which Peachland is built can enhance this effect somewhat via the action of orographic lift.
