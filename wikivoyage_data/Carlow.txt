Carlow (Ceatharlach) is the county town of County Carlow, some 85 km south of Dublin. It's become a commuter town for the city and in 2022 had a population of about 27,000; it's fairly compact and has preserved its old centre. 


Understand[edit]
Carlow Castle west wall: the east, south and north walls succumbed to an experiment in psychiatry
This lowland, fertile area has been inhabited for thousands of years, with Brownshill Dolmen the chunkiest relic of prehistory. Carlow's main feature is the River Barrow flowing south towards Waterford. In Irish the town is Ceatharlach, "four-legged", referring to livestock that were brought to market here, and swum across the river until the bridge was built in the 16th century. (Another version has it as Ceatharloch, "four lakes", but there's no trace of any such thing.) The Normans fortified the crossing, and from 1361 to 1374 made Carlow their seat of government in Ireland. The town was damaged but not wrecked in the many upheavals of the following centuries, and was able to grow up as a quiet provincial place. It prospered from 1800 when the entire river was made navigable up to Athy, whence a canal connected to the Dublin-Shannon Grand Canal. The railway arrived in 1846, industries were established, and from 1891 Carlow was powered by hydro-electricity generated above Leighlinbridge. The river formed the county boundary, with the west bank community of Graiguecullen standing in County Laois, until the boundary was adjusted in 1898.
The town languished in the 20th century, so its old centre was never re-developed. Its population boomed when the M9 put it within an hour's commuting distance of Dublin, and city centre prices drove individuals and businesses to settle further out. Perhaps as a sign of healthier times, Carlow's sugar beet industry closed but was replaced by the manufacture of electric toothbrushes. That too has closed but the pharmaceutical company MSD have opened a large vaccine production facility here, not a moment too soon.

Get around[edit]

Walk, town centre is compact. The historic main streets are Dublin St north, Castle St and Bridge St west, and Tullow St east.
Bike will easily get you to the outlying sights, which lack public transport. There are half-a-dozen shops for bicycle sales, spares and repairs, but no bike hire.
By car is pointless for town centre but the quickest way to reach outlying sights. Lower Tullow Street in the central one-way system is closed to traffic M-Sa 08:00-18:00.
Carlow has over 3000 car parking spaces, so there's never a shortage. There are two multi-storey car parks, with the largest in Carlow Shopping Centre, and another on Dublin Street. You collect a ticket on entry, which needs to be validated by a local shop.
Taxi fares are nationally regulated and taxis must use the meter. As of March 2021, fares M-Sa 8AM to 8PM are €3.80 flagfall then €1.14-1.50 per km, 20:00 to 08:00 and Sunday €4.20 flagfall then €1.45-1.80 per km. In slow traffic or if asked to wait they charge by the minute, 40-50 cents. There's a taxi rank on Potato Market, and they meet the trains and buses from Dublin. Operators include Bridge Cabs +353 59 917 0777 and Carlow Cab Service +353 59 914 0000.

See[edit]
Carlow Cathedral
52.837-6.92771 Carlow Cathedral (Cathedral of the Assumption), College Street. Daily 11AM-6PM. Built 1828-1833 in neo-Gothic, and embellished by its 46-m spire. The interior has been renovated several times, and in 1997 a parishioner went to the Supreme Court to try to block changes recommended by the Second Vatican Council, but these went ahead.   (updated Jul 2021)
St Patrick's College or Carlow College is east side of the cathedral; indeed the college is older, founded in 1782, and owns the land where the cathedral now stands. There's no public right-of-way but you can stroll the grounds of the elegant buildings. Until 1989 it was a seminary for the priesthood then became an independent arts college, with some 700 students.
52.836238-6.9281742 Carlow County Museum, College St, ☏ +353 59 913 1554, museum@carlowcoco.ie. M-Sa 10AM-5PM.

The museum is bigger than it first looks as it's over four floors (full wheelchair access) covering the area from prehistory to modern times. Free.   (updated Jul 2021)
52.83525-6.9294893 The Liberty Tree is a fountain at the centre of Potato Market, commemorating the 640 United Irishmen slain on or around 25 May 1798. The 1798 uprising sought to unite all Irishmen of every creed; it flopped in Dublin but had stronger support in the south. Some 1200 rebels, called "Croppy Boys" for their short hair, converged on Potato Market unopposed. But their plans were known and they had walked into a trap: a deadly fusillade tore into them. Over 400 were killed in the next few minutes, and another 150 were executed in the aftermath. The loyalist forces suffered no casualties, but some 200 civilians died as their houses were torched or fired upon and they attempted to flee. The rebellion held out in Enniscorthy, County Wexford for another month until they were encircled and slain. The fountain was commissioned for the 200th anniversary.
52.8391-6.93014 Carlow Courthouse , at the junction of Dublin St and Athy Rd, looks like it wants to be on a banknote. It's a neo-classical design, modeled on an Athenian temple, and completed in 1834. The Russian cannon in front was a trophy of the Crimean war. Refurbished in 2002, it's always been a courthouse; in the early 20th century the County Council shared the premises before moving to their own offices.
52.84345-6.928655 County Carlow Military Museum, St Dympna's Hospital, Athy Rd R93 PK46, admin@countycarlowmilitarymuseum.com. Apr-Nov: Su 2-5PM. Small volunteer-run museum within the former church of St Dympna's Hospital. Various military memorabilia and a reconstructed World War I trench.   (updated Jul 2021)
52.838-6.9336 Town Hall is the charming late 19th-century building on Centaur St. It's still used as local government offices and was refurbished in 2006 but Carlow no longer has a "town council": it's a municipal district and electoral area within Carlow County Council. Their main building is modern, on Athy Rd.
The Liberty Tree
52.836301-6.9359427 Carlow Castle  remains only as its western wall and adjoining towers. It was built on the river bank circa 1210, the reign of King John. Anglo-Norman castle architecture was still evolving so it doesn't have features that would later be typical, such as a gatehouse and great hall. It went through ownership changes and spells of being empty, and was damaged (of course) by Cromwell, but what did for it were the humane new approaches to mental health flourishing in the 19th century. Dr Philip Parry Prince Midleton leased the building and spent a fortune trying to turn it into a lunatic asylum, the Charenton of the west. In 1814 he had a brainwave: by packing the lower level with explosives, he could open up the interior and a passageway entrance. What followed was not really a blast, more like a protracted crump as three of the four walls subsided, and locals regretted that the castle was no longer suitable for confining Dr Midleton himself.
52.836739-6.9378058 Graiguecullen Bridge is a five-arched stone structure of 1569, though re-built and widened in 1815. The west bank neighbourhood of Graiguecullen was in County Laois until the boundary was adjusted in 1898.
Town Park is the pleasant green space west bank of the river, reached by a footbridge from town centre. It's open daylight hours.
52.838954-6.9391619 Croppies Grave just west of Town Park on Ninety-eight Street is the mass grave of the United Irishmen, the "Croppy Boys", killed in the 1798 uprising.

52.8375-6.88111111 Brownshill Dolmen  or Kernanstown Cromlech is a portal tomb dating from 3000 BC. It hasn't been excavated but its occupant must have been one helluva swell, as it has a humonguous granite capstone of some 150 metric tons, probably the largest in Europe. This is supported by upright stones, with a portal stone closing the burial chamber, and the whole structure used to be covered in earth. Free access, reach it on R726 Hacketstown Road, 3 km east of town.
52.8575-6.812812 Duckett's Grove, Kneestown. Daily 9AM-dusk. Gardens centred on the substantial shell of an 1830 neo-Gothic mansion, which was unoccupied from 1912 and burnt out in 1933. In 2005 the County Council acquired the estate, stabilised the ruin and re-established the gardens as a public park. The Upper Walled Garden was planted with roses and other flowering shrubs, the Lower Walled Garden was restored as an orchard. Free.   (updated Jul 2021)
52.847-7.00213 Killeshin Church is the ruin of a 12th-century Romanesque church. It's 5 km northwest of town on R430, just across the boundary into County Laois.
