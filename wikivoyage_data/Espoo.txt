Espoo (Swedish: Esbo) with a population of a quarter of a million is the second largest city in Finland. It's part of the Helsinki Metropolitan Area along with the cities of Helsinki, Vantaa, and the small city of Kauniainen (Swedish: Grankulla) which is completely encircled by Espoo.
The national park of Nuuksio is situated in northwestern Espoo.


Understand[edit]
Shopping at Iso Omena
Espoo has several local regional centres, thus divided into seven major areas: Vanha-Espoo, Espoonlahti, Espoo, Kauklahti, Leppävaara, Matinkylä and Tapiola. The Espoo center (Espoon keskus) is the administrative centre, but doesn't rise above its peers with respect to population. The population is concentrated in an inverted F-shaped area defined by the railway to Espoo centre (north) and the highway Länsiväylä (south) up to Espoonlahti. The rest is sparsely populated, and north of Espoo centre, the area is mostly forested. While Kauniainen is an independent municipality, in practice it is contiguous with Espoo and has no notable sights or services to travellers besides a small shopping center.
The science and technology-related campuses of the Aalto University are based in Otaniemi, Espoo, along with a thriving science community that includes numerous startups and organizations such as VTT – the Technical Research Centre of Finland. Nokia is headquartered in Karakallio, Espoo. Other high-tech companies such as KONE, Tekla and Fortum have their headquarters in Keilaniemi, Espoo, along with Microsoft's Finnish headquarters.

Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
With respect to transit, the south of Espoo is served by the local highway, Länsiväylä. Buses via Länsiväylä to destinations in Espoo leave from the Kamppi bus station (Kamppi shopping centre, ground floor). The orbital line 550 connects the train stations of Oulunkylä and Huopalahti with the south-eastern part of Espoo (Leppävaara, Laajalahti, Otaniemi, Tapiola and Westend).

By train[edit]
Northern Espoo and Espoo centre (Espoon keskus) are served by Helsinki commuter trains Y, U, L and E (25 min from Helsinki) to Middle- and West-Espoo. In addition, A train (every 10-20 minutes, 17 minutes from Helsinki) serves the east part of Espoo. See local train map[dead link].

Matinkylä metro station
Southeastern Espoo is accessible from central Helsinki by metro, with trains every 3-10 minutes.  Locations along the metro route include the Keilaniemi business district, Aalto University, Tapiola, Matinkylä and Kivenlahti, which serve as bus stations for feeder lines to destinations further afield. One in two trains terminates at Tapioca, while the rest continue all the way to Matinkylä.
The "Jokeri" orbital light rail (line 15), officially tram line 15, curves across eastern Espoo, connecting Keilaniemi, Aalto University, Leppävaara and then looping across northern Helsinki to terminate in Itäkeskus.

Stay safe[edit]
Although a part of the Helsinki metropolitan area, Espoo has few or no problem spots and is exceptionally safe. There are various reasons. The population of Espoo is affluent, with few low-income neighborhoods. Population is simply less concentrated, with few high-rise districts, traffic junctions or concentrations of nightlife. Thus, partygoers are more likely to head to Helsinki to cause trouble.
Caution is warranted in urban districts (along the railway) with nightlife during Friday or Saturday nights, for instance in Leppävaara and Espoon keskus. Suvela and Kirstinmäki, next to Espoon keskus, is often mentioned as the only "ghetto" in Espoo, although this is more reputation than fact if compared to districts in Central or Eastern Helsinki.
