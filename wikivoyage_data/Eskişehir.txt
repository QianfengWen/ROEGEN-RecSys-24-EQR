Eskişehir (pronounced Ess-KEE-shay-hear) is a city in Western Anatolia, 228 km west of Ankara. In 2021 it had a population of 898,369, with almost as many again in the wider metropolis. Its name means "old town" but the old quarter is compact; most of it is a new town with a buzzing student population, astride transport routes between Istanbul, Ankara and the Mediterranean coast. 


Understand[edit]
Odunpazarı is the old town
Somewhere beneath these streets is Doryleaum, the city founded by the Phrygians when they abandoned Karachisar their stronghold further south. They emerged as a civilisation around 1200 BC and disappeared in the 7th century AD, assimilated into the Byzantines. Their heartland was the region to the south called the Phrygian Valley and the museums hold many of their artefacts, but little of their buildings or monuments survive. Conquering armies, earthquakes and plundering of masonry have taken their toll but ultimately a more destructive force here and elsewhere in Turkey has been Devrim, now in turn a museum piece. That was the name of Turkey's first home-produced car, hand-crafted in Eskişehir: it flopped as a model, as did the project to make the country self-sufficient in vehicles, but mass automobile ownership and manufacture certainly took off from 1960. Devrim also aptly means the future, one in which boulevards were carved through ramshackle Ottoman town centres, and modern industry supplanted traditional trades. 
In Eskişehir development spared much of Odunpazarı, the compact old town surrounding Kurşunlu Mosque. New town is focused 2 km north on Köprübaşı, the main bridge crossing the Porsuk River via a small island. Boulevards of honking traffic radiate north from the bridge to the railway station (on the Istanbul-Ankara high speed line), business districts and airport. The lively riverside strip is called Adalar, "islands" though there's only one. Southeast from Adalar is Hamamyolu, a pedestrianised street with a broad leafy strip in the middle. Many buildings in these central areas are retro-Ottoman rather than the original. 
For Eskişehir the future now means a knowledge economy not metal-bashing, and there are three large universities: Anadolu, ETI and Osmangazi. These total some 90,000 students, 10% of the city population. It was already a progressive-minded place through 19th century arrivals from Crimea and the Balkans, fleeing the last throes of the decrepit Ottomans and supporting Atatürk's secular republican reforms. Add all those students and their lecturers and it becomes a haven of liberalism in a largely conservative region. It also means that amongst the young, you will find more fluency in English and other major European languages than elsewhere in Turkey.
Climate is semi-arid and continental; summers are hot and dry, winters are cold and snowy, autumn and spring are mostly mild albeit with a short storm season in spring.

By plane[edit]
Best fly to one of the Istanbul airports or Ankara. Istanbul Sabiha Gökçen (SAW IATA) is the most convenient as you can take a taxi or bus 10 km to Pendik station, then train to Eskişehir. 
39.8130.51941 Hasan Polatkan Airport (AOE  IATA; formerly Anadolu Airport), Eskişehir Teknik Üniversitesi, Gazipaşa (6 km north of town), ☏ +90 222 321 3550. This weird little place is part of the Faculty of Aeronautics and Astronautics of the Technical University. So they probably know a lot about aviation dynamics, but diddly-squat about how to run an airport (a missed teaching opportunity). It only has seasonal flights to Brussels (various carriers) and occasionally elsewhere such as Saudi Arabia; nothing domestic. They don't even let you into the terminal until just before boarding, too late to sort out any glitches or use the toilets, so you huddle outside. There's car rental but no public transport.

By train[edit]
Eskişehir is near the fork in Turkey’s YHT high speed railway network, with frequent fast trains from Istanbul, Ankara, Konya and Karaman. 
From Istanbul, 11 trains take 3 hours via Pendik, Gebze, Izmit and Arifiye (for Adapazarı), and mostly continue to Ankara. Change in Ankara for cities in the east.

You could also leave O-7 at Gebze for O-5 south to Bursa, then O-22 onto D200 east through İnegöl. 
From Ankara follow D200 / 90 southwest via Polatlı. Don't follow signs for Istanbul, as the direct highway sweeps well north via Bolu.

Get around[edit]
Simit are bread rings
Walk: old town sights are in a compact area around Kurșunlu Mosque. 
Trams: Line 1 starts from the bus station (Otogar) and loops through old town / Odunpazarı (Atatürk Lisesi), the modern centre / Köprübaşı (Çarşı), Doktorlar Cd (İsmet İnönü), the railway station (Espark), and the Yunus Emre campus (Anadolu Üniversitesi) to SSK interchange. There it connects with suburban Line 8 to Batikent and Line 9 to Çamlıca.
Line 4 also runs from the bus station through old town, then heads west to Osmangazi University. Line 3 makes the third side of the triangle, from Osmangazi University to Çarşı then with Line 1 north to the railway station, Yunus Emre campus and SSK interchange. 
Line 7 from Osmangazi University runs through the south suburbs to Çankaya. 
From the southeast, Line 10 runs from Sehir Hospital and Line 12 from Yil to old town. Line 12 there joins Lines 3 and 4 to Osmangazi University, Line 10 goes north to the Opera and Kimlubel.  
Dolmuşes and public buses cover the rest of the city. The city also has a small fleet of 19th century-looking fayton horse-drawn carriages.
Taxis: On the main streets, you’ll see buttons looking like electric switches on walls, trees, etc. Push the switch and the taxi at the nearest rank will come and pick you up.

This mosque and religious complex (külliyesi) was completed in 1525, probably by Acem Ali, who set the style for classical Ottoman architecture followed by Mimar Sinan.

This is mined as a soft white clay that can easily be shaped, then it sets hard when warmed. Tobacco pipes were a traditional use, as the material is robust and insulating yet light - even light enough to float, hence the resemblance to sea foam. The world's main deposits of meerschaum are in Eskişehir Province.   (updated Feb 2024)

39.732830.447412 Karacahisar  10 km southwest of town is the scrappy ruins of a Byzantine hilltop fortress, open 24 hours. It was built (or re-built) around 1175 but soon after fell to the Seljuks or their allies the Germiyanids. In 1288 it was captured by the Ottomans, in those days a small semi-nomadic tribe based in nearby Söğüt. Ottoman mythology dates the capture earlier, to portray it as a first victory for Islam against the Byzantine Christians, but it was their fellow Muslims that the Ottomans hacked to bits here.
39.44194430.69416713 Seyyid Battal Gazi Tomb  is on a hillside at the south edge of Seyitgazi town, 40 km south of Eskişehir. It's a Seljuk-built külliyesi or religious complex dedicated to the folk hero Battal Gazi (605-740 AD). He's probably fictional, but his deeds became intertwined with those of a real 8th century Islamic warrior, and have been embellished in films. The complex was extended by the Ottomans, and consists of a mosque, a madrasa, a dervish lodge, and a caravanserai serving traders and pilgrims.
39.204130.715114 Yazılı is a village 27 km south of Seyitgazi and 70 km south of Eskişehir, with rock-cut reliefs in its valley walls. Best of these, just south, is "Midas Throne" built 7th century BC, but probably after that king's death. It was also a shrine to the Phrygian mother goddess Cybele, whose cult long preceded and outlasted Midas, as it was exported by the Romans across their far-flung empire.
Phrygian Valley is an unofficial name for the rocky countryside starting at Yazılı and extending over a wide area, with numerous Phrygian rock-cut tombs and other ancient sites.

Çi börek (or çiğ börek) is a Crimean Tatar delicacy, a deep fried pastry of thin, half moon-shaped dough filled with minced meat and onion lightly sprinkled with black pepper. True Tatars eat it by hand, perhaps with a napkin, so they don't provide forks in their eateries. Examples are at Şeh Şemşettin Sk 11 just north of Kurşunlu Mosque, at Atatürk Blv 97 west near ETI Museum, Papağan Çiğbörek (below), and Porsuk Çibörek nearby.
Pizza and other western fast food outlets are near the roundabout just east of the Ibis Hotel and down the strip southeast to the Porsuk bridge.
