Eat[edit]
If you're spending the night in Motul, be sure to order the Huevos Motuleños for breakfast...it's the town's most famous dish and a cornerstone of regional cuisine throughout the Yucatán peninsula. It starts with a fresh corn tortilla, hot off the comal. Spread mashed black beans (or use refried beans if you're a gringo) on the tortillas and then a freshly fried egg. Top with chiltomate salsa (a red salsa flavored with habañero). Sprinkle with queso fresco and chopped ham. Local often sprinkle some sweet peas on top. It's the Yucatan, so of course it's usually served with fried plantains. Buen provecho!
