The Lutherhaus, home of Martin Luther
Wittenberg is a town in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. The official name is Lutherstadt Wittenberg for its close connection of the town with Martin Luther's Protestant Reformation. It was here that in 1517, according to the legend, Martin Luther posted his famous 95 Theses on the portal of the Schlosskirche. While historians doubt this particular part of the tale, it is certain that Luther disseminated his Theses from Wittenberg. In 2017 the town celebrated the 500th anniversary of the event. Luther Memorials in Wittenberg are part of a UNESCO World Heritage site. Other historical people with a close connection to Wittenberg are Luther's fellow reformer, Philipp Melanchthon, and the painter Lucas Cranach der Ältere.
Wittenberg should not be confused with the much smaller town of Wittenberge in northwestern Brandenburg.
