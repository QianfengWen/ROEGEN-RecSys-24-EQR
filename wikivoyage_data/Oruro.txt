Oruro is a city in the Oruro Department of Bolivia.


Understand[edit]
Oruro is famous for its carnival. It's been a major mining centre and railway hub, but with the closing of the mine and with more and more rail connections ceasing the town is about to lose its importance. But only 3 hr and Bs. 15 by bus from La Paz, this is a nice getaway from the prices and stress of the capital.

The streets are well planned and orientation is simple. The easily recognized Av. 6 de Agosto, featuring a railway track in the middle runs from north to south with the bus terminal in the north and the town center in the south. The center is small enough to get around by foot and micros heading to the main bus terminal cruise Av. 6 de Agosto, otherwise it's a ten minute walk.
The main square garden (Plaza 10 de Febrero) is the reference for all the locals and visitors. 
The Virgen del Socavon temple, is where the carnival ends. It's situated in the west part of the city, and there you can also visit a little mining museum. 
In the south part of the city, you can find the zoo, where you can see some of the very exotic Andean wildlife.
