Sigatoka (pronounced Singatoka) is a town on the southwestern coast of Viti Levu, Fiji.


Understand[edit]
Ride a jet boat up the mighty Sigatoka River.
Sigatoka is the western gateway to the Coral Coast, which continues all the way to Suva. The town overlooks the mouth of the Sigatoka River. Many of the good restaurants, views and resorts are located slightly southeast of town on a narrow, picturesque piece of land called the Sunset Strip.
Sigatoka was founded in the colonial sugarcane period of Fiji's history. Between 1912 and 1932, banana crops in the area were ravaged by a fungal disease which came to be known worldwide as Yellow Sigatoka. However, Black Sigatoka was named so due to its similarities with the Yellow Sigatoka fungus, not because the disease first occurred in the town.
Today, the town and the surrounding region is nicknamed the Salad Bowl of Fiji because of its valley shape and fertile land suitable for growing fruit and vegetables.

Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
The two bus services that go to Sigatoka from Nadi and Suva are Sunbeam and Pacific Transport. Buses are by far the cheapest mode of transport but take a slightly longer time (even the expresses) than car or taxi. They stop at the -18.13989177.507361 Sigatoka bus station.

By car[edit]
It takes slightly over an hour to drive from Nadi to Sigatoka via Queens Road.

By taxi[edit]
From Nadi International  Airport, a taxi ride to Sigatoka will cost about $80.

The main town and markets are small enough to make moving around by foot the best option. However, you will need a car or taxi to get to the points of interest in the surrounding regions.
