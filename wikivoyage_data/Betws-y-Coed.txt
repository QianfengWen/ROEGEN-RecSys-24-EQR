Betws-y-Coed (meaning Chapel in the Woods) is a village of 564 people (2011) in Conwy county borough, and one of the primary tourist resorts in the Snowdonia National Park.


Understand[edit]
Pont-y-pair Bridge and Afon Llugwy
The village claims to be Wales' most popular inland tourist resort, and it's certainly on the coach holiday circuit. The name is often abbreviated to "Betws" or "BYC".

By car[edit]
Betws-y-Coed is on the historic A5 London to Holyhead trunk road, but is also accessible via the A470 from Llandudno.

By train[edit]
Betws-y-Coed station is on the Conwy Valley branch line from Llandudno Junction to Blaenau Ffestiniog. Trains run approximately every three hours during the day Monday to Saturday and three times a day on Summer Sundays.

By bus[edit]
Betws y Coed is served by Bws Gwynedd services:

S2 (Llanrwst–Capel Curig–Betws-y-Coed) (every 1–2 hours on workdays)
S97 (Porthmadog–Penryndeudraeth/Beddgelert–Betws-y-Coed) (less frequent)
X1/84 follows the same line from Llandudno Junction to Blaenau Ffestiniog as the train but is more frequent (every 1–2 hours on workdays)
Local buses to Llanrwst
In effect bus travel to/from Betws-y-Coed is not easily manageable; many buses run only on certain days, dates or periods, especially in summer. And times are not evenly distributed—at some times there may be 3 buses to Llanrwst in one hour and then 2 hours before the next one goes. On Sundays there are almost no buses except the S2.
The bus station is 100 m north of the entrance to the railway station, at the entrance to the large car park, and is referred to as "Platform 2" although it is nothing like a platform and not even part of the station complex.

Get around[edit]
As the village is quite small, it is easiest to get around on foot. The S2 bus can be used to get to the westernmost part of town as well as to the Swallow Falls Hotel complex, the Ty y Hyll trailhead and Capel Curig. Many places, however, cannot be reached by public transport at all, so a car is very handy. A bike is also useful but it must be suitable for hilly terrain.

Do[edit]
Betws-y-Coed's location in the heart of Snowdonia's mountains means that many visitors are here for hillwalking, mountain biking and climbing.

 Mountain Biking. Check out the Marin and Penmachno Trails. 
 Gwydyr Forest, Betws-y-Coed, cs-p@hushmail.com. The Gwydyr Forest is one of the first Forests of Wales to be planted by the Forestry Commission and covers approximately 72 square miles. Much of it was planted in the early 1920s. There was a certain amount of natural regeneration of wild species growing up to the 1,000-foot tree level many hundreds of years ago. As time has advanced much of the traditional forestry work has declined and more emphasis is being put into recreation, cycle routes, bridleways and picnic spots. Timber production is being harvested each day, and as more areas get clear felled they are planted up again with more native species of oak, beech and rowan. The forest surrounding Betws-y-Coed is rich in both marked and unmarked trails. The marked trails range from one-mile walks on level roads to 10-mile walks in strenuous terrain. The lower parts of the Llugwy Valley offer forests reminiscent of temperate rainforests with a thick cover of moss and lichens on the trees and on ground. Another speciality is the exploring of old mines and quarries, many of which are partly (and safely) accessible. (updated Apr 2016)
 Narrow-gauge railways. Betws-y-Coed is a great base for exploring the Great Little Trains, narrow-gauge heritage railways found all over North Wales. Apart from the railway museum, the Conwy valley line is quite interesting, and provides access to Blaenau Ffestiniog with the Ffestiniog Railway and the mine tramways of the Llechwedd Slate Caverns as well as to the Chester to Holyhead mainline via Llandudno Junction. Sherpa bus S2 provides easy access to Llanberis with the Snowdon Mountain Railway and the Llanberis Lake Railway (1 proper railway, 3 narrow-gauge heritage railways and 4 smaller mine or model tramways).

The 'Zip Safari' is a treetop journey along 23 zip lines and other rope courses, and the Junior Tree Trail is its kid-friendly cousin. 'Plummet Tower' is a 31 m climbing pole and parachute simulator (basically you climb to the top then jump off - great fun!). Other attractions include a giant swing and the 1-km Fforest Coaster. Prices vary by attraction, though Zip Safari is £40 p.p.,£140 group of four. Junior Tree Trail is £12.50 per child. (updated Feb 2017)
Buy[edit]
There are outdoor clothing and equipment shops and also some shops selling local crafts. There are a lot of outdoor clothing and equipment shops (5–6) for a village this size, but otherwise there is nothing special to get which can't be purchased in similar shops otherwise. A few shops sell slate specialty products and souvenirs, but in general Llanberis (Welsh Slate Museum) and Blaenau Ffestiniog (Llechwed Slate Caverns) are better choices for slate.

Eat[edit]
There are relatively few restaurants—most of them part of a hotel, and most of them serve only classic Welsh food or have a bar menu. There is one Chinese restaurant and one Indian.

53.093103-3.8050853 The Royal Oak Hotel. Large hotel, central and well equipped. A bit pricey. Has 3 restaurants of fair quality; all have standard Welsh cuisine:
