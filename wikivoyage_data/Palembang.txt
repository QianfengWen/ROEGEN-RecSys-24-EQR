Palembang (IPA: [paˈlemˌbaŋ]), also called Pelembang (IPA: [pəˈlemˌbaŋ] or [ˈplemˌbaŋ]) by the locals, is Indonesia's provincial capital of South Sumatra with 1.7 million people (2020).


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Kampung Kapitan, one of the oldest Chinatowns in the city.
Palembang is one of the oldest continuously inhabitied cities in Indonesia and even Southeast Asia (perhaps second only to Hanoi). The foundation of Palembang can be dated as late as the 7th century when it emerged as the imperial thalassocratic city-state of Srivijaya, one of the largest and most important Buddhist polities in ancient Indonesia. The city played a vital role in the regional cultural and economic landscape. Srivijaya controlled important chokepoints such as the straits of Malacca and Sunda, with Palembang acting as an entrepôt for commodities from all over the Archipelago and beyond. At the same time, it was also a thriving centre of religious education, with pilgrims from as far as China stopping there along the way to India to study Buddhist scriptures with local monks and scholars.

The original 18th-century minaret of Palembang's Great Mosque.
Following the sack of Palembang by Chola in the early 11th century, the city's importance began to wane. Palembang underwent a series of transformations, primarily under the influence of various Java-based polities, starting from Majapahit in the 14th century. In the early 15th century, the city had briefly fallen into the hands of Chinese pirates, but they were swiftly crushed by the fleet of Admiral Zheng He, who installed a Chinese administrator to govern the city. The 16th century saw the influx of Javanese royals establishing a new Palembang dynasty after a succession war, though nominally still under the suzerainty of Java-based kings and sultans. By the middle of the 17th-century, however, the rulers of Palembang had started using the title "Sultan" for themselves, proclaiming their independence from Java.
The Sultanate of Palembang controlled trade along the Musi River and nearby islands such as Bangka and Belitung, making wealth out of pepper and tin exports. This wealth are then used to build lavish buildings, such as palace compounds (keraton) and a grand mosque. The city itself begun to expand along the riverbanks, with older inhabitans mainly remaining on the northern side (Seberang Ilir), while newcomers, including Chinese and Arab migrants, were given permission to settle on the southern side (Seberang Ulu). The Sultanate continued to thrive up until the early 19th century, when a multilateral conflict involving internal factions as well as the British and Dutch colonial forces brought it to an end.
Following the Sultanate's abolition in 1825, the city became the capital of the Residency of Palembang, which had roughly the same boundaries as today's South Sumatra province. Palembang witnessed economic rejuvenation in the late 19th century with the rapid development of the petroleum and rubber industries, leading to unprecedented economic growth, increased urbanization, and the influx of migrants. It was formally incorporated as a municipality (gementee) in 1906, and by the 1930s, it had became the most populous urban centre in Dutch East Indies outside Java, with Medan and Makassar trailing behind. The pressure from the rapid urbanization led the city to to expand its infrastructure, from building a new potable water distribution system to reclaiming waterways for road transport. However, global economic downturn in the 1930s led to stagnation, with many projects having to be shelved.
Palembang was part of the Pacific Theatre during World War II. The Japanese occupation forces swiftly took the city for its oil refineries, and the Allies conducted multiple bombing raids against them. During the Indonesian National Revolution, the city also became the site of a major battle between the republicans and the returning Dutch force. In the aftermath of the Indonesian independence, the city continued to evolve into the modern city as we know it today. The construction of the iconic Ampera Bridge crossing the Musi in the 1960s marked a significant milestone in Palembang's development, facilitating urban development further away from the Musi River along a north-south axis. More recently, Palembang has gained recognition for its holding of international events, including the Southeast Asian Games in 2011 and the 18th Asian Games in 2018, both jointly hosted with Jakarta.

Orientation and navigation[edit]
The LRT Palembang crossing the famous Ampera Bridge
Originally, the development of Palembang spreads along the Musi riverbank, which splits the city into two sides, namely Seberang Ilir ("Upper Side") to the north and Seberang Ulu ("Lower Side") to the south. The Ampera Bridge is positioned very prominently in the heart of the city, and is almost always visible from anywhere along the Musi banks (within the city limits).
Unlike many Indonesian cities of its size, Palembang does have a fair share of large roads and streets, sometimes as wide as 4 lanes on each side. However, most of the older neighbourhoods in Palembang were built along hundreds of former small waterways which have long been reclaimed. This leads to very chaotic, unorganized grids of small alleys and lanes criss-crossed by large roads and streets. For this reason, addresses are often given with double road/street/alley names, with the larger one coming first, followed by the smaller one to clarify where the actual location is, then unit number, administrative divisions, and postal code.

Talk[edit]
See also: Palembang phrasebook
The main spoken language variety in the city is Palembang or Palembang Malay, known locally as baso Pelembang. It is related to, but still quite distinct from, various Malayic varieties spoken throughout Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei, including Standard Malay and Standard Indonesian, Betawi, Musi, and Minangkabau, among others. The Palembang dialect differ from the standards mostly in terms of vocabulary, with it having heavy Javanese influence, but also slightly in terms of phonology and grammar.
As with many other places in Indonesia, this vernacular Palembang variety is often used together with Indonesian in a spectrum of diglossia, where the more formal the situation, the closer to the Standard (or to Jakartan Indonesian) the language will be. In the most informal situations, Standard forms may not be used at all, and the language will be harder to comprehend. Still, regardless of its limited usage in speech, Indonesian is practically understood by almost everyone, and is almost the sole language used in writing.
On the other hand, English is not widely spoken, especially considering that Palembang is not a major tourist destination for people from outside Indonesia. Some younger people may understand English better than most, though they may not as comfortable speaking in it. In addition, people working in hospitality and tourism-related businesses have higher chances to speak decent English.

It is quite easy to get around in Palembang since there are a lot of public buses, modified vans (Angkots or Angkutan Kota) and for short distances there is always becak.
