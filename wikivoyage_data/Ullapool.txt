Ullapool is a village on the shores of Loch Broom in Ross and Cromarty in the Scottish Highlands. With a population of 1500 in 2020, it's a ferry port and most visitors are just passing through on the way to and from Stornoway on Lewis. Reasons to stay are for hill-walking and exploration of the wild mainland scenery.


Get in[edit]
Ullapool and Loch Broom
Ullapool is 60 miles (100 km) northwest of Inverness, which has the nearest airport and railway station. Follow A835 and allow 75 min.
By bus: Scottish Citylink Bus 961 takes 80 min from Inverness. It's timed to meet the ferries, running twice M-Sa and once on Sunday. An adult single in 2022 is £16 and in summer you'd best book ahead. There are no through-buses from Edinburgh or Glasgow, but with connections to join the 961 it might take six hours and cost £35. 
Stagecoach Bus 61 also runs twice M-F from Inverness via Dingwall, Strathpeffer, Contin and Braemore. This is mostly a school bus, so its times vary between term and holidays. 
On schooldays only, Bus 890 runs to Ullapool from Kinlochbervie in the morning, taking 2 hours via Laxford Bridge, Kylesku and Elphin, and returning north in the afternoon. An earlier Bus 891 continues from Ullapool to Dingwall, starting back around 2:45PM.
By boat: Calmac ferries sail from Stornoway on Lewis, taking 2 hr 30 min. They sail year-round, with two sailings M-Sa, one on Sunday Nov-Mar and two Apr-Oct - see Stornoway#Get in for fares. These ferries often sell out in summer, so even foot passengers should book in advance. Be at the pier at least 45 min before sailing.
57.8951-5.15871 Ullapool ferry pier on Loch Broom is the bus and ferry terminus.

See[edit]
Town centre is attractive early Victorian low-rise. Any walk that gains height is quickly rewarded by great views over Loch Broom.
57.896-5.1621 Ullapool Museum, 7 West Argyle Street IV26 2TY, ☏ +44 1854 612987. Apr-Sep: Th-Tu 11AM-4PM. Museum in a Thomas Telford church built in 1829. Adult £5, child free. (updated Aug 2022)
57.7556-5.02142 Corrieshalloch Gorge is a deep ravine, where the Abhainn Droma thunders over the 150 ft Falls of Measach. There a viewing bridge below the waterfall, accessible free 24 hours, and the area is a nature reserve maintained by the National Trust for Scotland. The gorge demonstrates how our idea of "beauty" was transformed in the 19th century: Coire Shalach is Gaelic for "unattractive gorge" and to anyone herdng cattle it was a confounded nuisance. It's 12 miles south of Ullapool on A835, by the junction with A832 to Gairloch.
57.9258-5.22313 Rhue Lighthouse is more correctly a beacon, marking the entrance to Loch Broom towards Ullapool. It's a short walk from the lane off A835 north of town.
57.945-5.2254 Isle Martin is a nature reserve administered as part of the Summer Isles, but so far from the main group that it makes for a separate boat trip. A flour mill here worked until 1948, but from the 1960s the island was depopulated and turned into a reserve.
57.9564-5.19325 Dùn Canna is the rubble of an Iron Age fort, maybe from 500 BC. You just come for the coast hike and views.
Clear night skies: you need to go a mile or so out of town to get clear of skyglow, then the Milky Way and other celestial objects swim into view. It's a lost cause May-July when the nights never get truly dark, just a brief "simmer dim".
