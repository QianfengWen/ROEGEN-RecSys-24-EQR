The Battles of Adobe Walls
Adobe Walls was originally a tiny buffalo hunting outpost established in 1843 on the north bank of the Canadian River in Hutchison county.  The locale was the site of two of the largest battles of the Indian Wars. At the First Battle of Adobe Walls, in November 1864, a US cavalry force of 410 men attacked what they thought was a  small Kiowa village, only to find that the area was teeming with other Comanche villages, engaging as many as 4,000 Indians in the battle. Though greatly outnumbered, superior firepower allowed the US force to retreat. In the Second Battle of Adobe Walls however, it was the Comanches who were forced to retreat after around 700 Comanches, led by Quanah Parker, attacked the rebuilt hunting post in the early morning of June 27, 1874. Though there were only 28 settlers to defend it, long range buffalo guns allowed them to hold the Comanches at bay for four days. After Billie Dixon fired the most famous shot of the Indian Wars, killing a warrior on a hill one mile away, the Comanches gave up the fight. This battle provided the spark which started the Red River War of 1874-75.
These days, little remains at the site, though some Texas Historical Marker mark the spot, and excavations have produced a number of artifacts. The museum in Borger has from time to time produced re-enactments of these two great battles-- inquire for details. To visit the site, take SH 207 north about 11 miles past Stinnett, turn east onto County Road F and continue for 17 miles as the road makes several turns, becoming first CR 23 and then CR 22.
