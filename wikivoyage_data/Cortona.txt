Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Cortona can be reached by flying to Italian major international airports in Rome and Milan, or to the two airports in Tuscany:

Pisa International Airport Galileo Galilei[dead link] (PSA IATA), 1.5 km (1 mi) south of Pisa city centre, served by many budget airlines. From there you can take a train (40 metres from airport).
Florence Airport Amerigo Vespucci [formerly dead link]  (FLR IATA),  four kilometres from the centre of Florence. From there you can use the Sita/Ataf service "Fly by Bus" (Vola in bus) between the airport and Florence's Santa Maria Novella railway station (20 min).
By train[edit]
The closest train station is "Camucia-Cortona", with direct trains from Florence and Rome or "Terontola-Cortona" with direct trains from Florence and Venice. You can also take a train to Arezzo and then another train to "Camucia-Cortona".
Buses leave every 30 min from the Camucia station bound for Piazza Garibaldi in Cortona. You may have to buy your bus ticket direct from the driver, in which case you should be prepared to pay the exact cash fare of €2. The driver is not obliged to provide change. Before your trip back to the station, buy a ticket from a tobacco shop (tabbachi) for €1.10. Not all buses from Cortona to Camucia stop at the railway station but there is another stop in town (at Viale Regina Elena & Strada Regionale 71) very close to the station.
Taxis are available in front of the Camucia station and Terontola train station; however, apparently there are only few taxis serving this "route". If you want to be sure that there is a taxi for you, ask your hotel to book one for you. The other option could be rent a car and you can do it right outside of Terontola-Cortona train station and use your car to reach your destinations.
There is no staffed ticket office (biglietteria) at the Camucia station. However, there are 2 ticket vending machines at the station that are designed to accept credit cards such as Visa.
