The site is free to access 24 hours.
50.459319.55273 Suchy Połeć is a rocky outcrop, where the first thing you need to see is the gaping hole in the path, to avoid tumbling into a World War II bunker. The outcrop has views of the castle, sanctuary and Birów mountain. The short path starts from Partyzantów lane towards Mount Birów.
