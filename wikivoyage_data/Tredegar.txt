Bedwellty House
Tredegar[dead link] is a small industrial town in Monmouthshire, South Wales. It is by no means a major tourist destination, but it does have a certain off-the-beaten-path charm and is located right on the edge of Brecon Beacons National Park, making it a fine base for hiking.


Get in[edit]
From the M4 (south) take A467 at junction 28 and then follow signs for Tredegar to A4048, from which the town centre is well signed. From the north, take the A40 to A465 towards Merthyr Tydfil. Turn left onto A4048 from the roundabout signed for Tredegar and then look for signs for the town centre.

A manor and public Victorian park built in 1818 for the then ironmaster of the Tredegar Iron Company. Well worth strolling around to admire, among other things, its arboretum and the world's largest lump of coal. The bandstand in the park stages various performances during the summer. Rooms in the manor may be rented out for meetings/events.   
 Town Clock, Morgan Street. A landmark hard to overlook, as it looms large over the town centre, the Tredegar Town Clock is 72 feet tall, wholly made cast-iron from the Tredegar iron works, and was erected in 1958. In fact, it is the tallest tower made solely of cast-iron in the world.
