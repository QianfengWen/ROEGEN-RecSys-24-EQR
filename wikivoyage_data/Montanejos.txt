Do[edit]
Fuente de los Baños
40.07417-0.533891 Fuente de Los Baños. The hot spring is located in a region known for its mountains, deep gorges and scenic nature. The crystalline waters of the lagoon bubble up from the earth at a temperature of 25°C all year round. This place well known by the locals is still undiscovered by most travellers. The story goes that the hot spring was the preferred bathing and relaxation site for a Moorish king's harem. The water was said to keep his women young and beautiful. Dip into the water for a swim and explore the lagoon snorkeling, see the fish around you and discover the hidden caves. For the brave there´s the option to jump off cliffs right into the deepest part of the lagoon. Access by public transportation is difficult.   (updated Jan 2016)
