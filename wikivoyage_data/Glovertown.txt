History[edit]
Glovertown was founded as "Bloody Bay". That name dated back to the 18th century and supposedly it referred to a massacre of a family of 11 by Beothuk Aboriginals that were living in the area at the time. The town was renamed Alexander Bay in 1894. During 1894, a section of railway was being built in the area. A few years later the town was renamed "Glovertown", after Sir John Hawley Glover who served as the Governor of Newfoundland from 1876 to 1881 and from 1883 to 1885.
The first settlers of Glovertown appeared in the early 19th century. In 1845, 12 people lived there. By 1857 there were only 10 and by 1862 there Glovertown became a thriving center for the fishery, boat building and lumbering industries. 
In 1913, one of the sawmills at Rosedale exploded and six people were killed. In 1946 there was a fire that was started by sparks coming from a passing train. The fire destroyed 46 homes. Two schools, several businesses and 390 km² of timber were also destroyed during the fire. The lumber industry has never recovered from this loss.
Eventually people from Greenspond, Flat Island, Bragg's Island, and Gooseberry Island began to resettle to Glovertown and the influx of new people brought new industries to the town, including dairy and construction.

Get in[edit]
Glovertown can be accessed on Highway 1 (Trans-Canada Highway) east of Gander and Gambo and west of Terra Nova National Park. There are two exits: one that leads directly onto Station Road in Glovertown and another that leads to Eastport and Traytown.
