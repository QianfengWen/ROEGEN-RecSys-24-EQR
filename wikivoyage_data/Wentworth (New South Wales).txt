Map of Wentworth (New South Wales)
By plane[edit]
Wentworth Airport does not have any scheduled passenger flights from anywhere and is only used for other purposes. The closest airport with scheduled flights is Mildura Airport (MQL IATA).

By bus[edit]
The only major public transport that connects Wentworth is the 950 bus line from Mildura, passing Buronga and Curlwaa.

By car[edit]
From Mildura CBD, it's about a half an hour drive north via the A79 Calder Highway and then the B79 Silver City Highway which is on the route to Broken Hill. It's usually an easy drive, except when crossing the Murray River where only one vehicle can cross at a time.
