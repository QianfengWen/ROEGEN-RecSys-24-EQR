Busselton is a city of 28,000 people (2018) on Geographe Bay in the South West region of Western Australia. It is famous for its 2-km-long heritage jetty, which has been restored for tourism. Busselton was voted Western Australia's top tourist town in 1995, 1996, and 2005.


Understand[edit]

Busselton was a very early settled farming and timber port in a sheltered Geographe Bay, just south of the larger Bunbury.
It was connected by railway to Perth until 1957.  It is now served by wider, faster highways, and is predominantly a car-oriented location.  Although public and private transport is available to the intrepid traveller, car-based travel in the area is the dominant mode.
The regions roads are so much faster and by connecting to Margaret River to the south, the by-pass road lies just to the south, and you can travel to Margaret River without 'going into' Busselton, as you had to do in the past.
The town was on a beachside, and it spread, and spread, and now with the named location Dunsborough to the west, and wetlands to the east, it is a long spread out homage to the beachside environment. Because the town and its spread around the bay is all flat, it is an excellent bicycling area.
The original town next to the jetty remains busy and central for services.
In the 1970s an enterprising Perth based artist designed a t-shirt satirising the Western Australian tourist promotion of the time Relax in a State of Excitement with a reply, by putting on the rear of the t-shirt - A Billion flies cannot be wrong.
Busselton and the surrounds have in the past been captive to the swarm of bush flies that gather on the back, and around the eyes of the unwary.  Hats with corks and nets hanging from them are good antidotes if you are otherwise unprepared for them.

-33.637433115.3407851 Busselton Jetty. The most famous feature of Busselton is the jetty. It long - very long; nearly 2 km in length. It was required by the shallowness of the bay, but fell into disrepair following the cessation of commercial shipping. The jetty has been restored for heritage and tourism purposes. Its railway used to be part of Western Australia's rail network, connecting to the main line to Perth. These days, a small tourist train will take you to the end of the pier. There is an underwater observatory at the end of the pier. Silt in the bay can be whipped up by winds, and on windy days the observatory can close for poor visibility.   (updated Sep 2020)

Busselton has an amazing amount of large licenced cafes, serving modern Australian style cuisine.  You have plenty of choice if you take a walk down the main street.

 El Gringo Mexican. The Chimichanga is a specialty, and worth trying if you are into fried Mexican.  The con queso isn't, and just tastes like melted cheese. 
 The Equinox Cafe. On the Busselton foreshore. You have the option of a cheap and easy take-away counter or dine in. Great place to pick up some fish and chips to eat on the beach.
