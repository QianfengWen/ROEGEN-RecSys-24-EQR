(Information last updated 10 Nov 2022)


Davao[dead link] is the largest city on the Philippines' second-largest island, Mindanao. It has a huge land area, and the inhabitants like to think of it as one of the most crime-free large cities in the Philippines.


Understand[edit]
As in most of Mindanao, Cebuano (known locally as Davao Bisaya) is the main local language. English and Tagalog are also widely used and understood.
The elected officials have been accused of encouraging vigilantism and death squads. Whatever the truth of these accusations, it's certainly true that, as a visitor, you're certainly less likely to be the victim of robbery or petty larceny than most similar size cities in the Americas with the exception of Canada. Martial law was lifted across Mindanao on 1 January 2020.

History[edit]
Davao's first inhabitants were the Bagobo tribe, one of the Lumad ethnic groups, and the Muslim Moros. The surrounding area was explored by the Spaniards from the coast, but only in the late 19th century were they able to penetrate the area.
Modern Davao started as a Spanish colonial outpost, as the town of Nueva Vergara (named after a town in the Spanish Basque Country). The Basque businessman José Cruz de Oyanguren led an expedition in an attempt to colonize the Davao area. A battle soon erupted between the Spaniards and the combined Bagobo and Mandaya tribes led by the local chieftain Datu Bago; the Spaniards won and Bago surrendered. The town of Nueva Vergara was founded in 1848, and served as the capital of the province of Nueva Guipúzcoa, which would become Davao province and the present region. Nueva Vergara was eventually renamed to its present name, Davao, to reflect its Bagobo roots. During that time, Davao had a population of both Christians and Muslims, which was a challenge to the colonial administrators, and was less developed 
Since the Americans arrived in 1900, Davao became prosperous, starting with opening of huge swaths of land to agriculture which also invited foreign investment. Homesteading programs also brought in settlers from Luzon and Visayas, and Davao had a large Japanese minority. The opening of the Port of Davao in 1900 further facilitated the town's growth.
Davao was made a part of the Moro Province from 1903 to 1914, when it was made the capital of a recreated Davao province. Present-day Davao City comes from a merger of the town with the nearby district of Guianga.
During World War II, Davao was the first part of Mindanao to be occupied by the Japanese. It was heavily bombed by the Americans during the end of the war, and almost all of Davao is heavily destroyed. At the end of the war, its Japanese minority has mostly assimilated into the Filipino population, and others fled.
In 1967, Davao Province was split into three new provinces, and Davao became part of Davao del Sur. During that time, it no longer serves as a provincial capital, but is a major commercial center.
During the late 1960s till the mid-1980s, Davao's history is marked by social and political unrest, and had a bad reputation for violence. Davao was a hotbed for communist and secessionist sentiments, and many Davaoeños led groups opposing the abuses of the Marcos administration until its ouster. Davao was also known as a hotbed of violent crime, but things began to change with the election of Rodrigo Duterte as mayor starting in 1988. Duterte severely cracked down on the criminal elements of the city, which succeeded in greatly reducing the crime rate, but also garnered sharp criticism for the use of vigilantism and death squads. Despite the controversy, Duterte remains popular among the locals due to his success in fighting crime, and this popularity would eventually propel him to the presidency of the Philippines in 2016.

Davao has a rainforest climate, with plenty of rainfall throughout the year and no dry season. Being just 7 degrees north of the equator, daily average temperatures are near constant, with daytime highs between 31–33 °C (88–91 °F) and the nighttime low between 23–25 °C (73–77 °F). Like the rest of Davao Region, Davao is hit by a few typhoons, usually during the last quarter of the year. Main tourist season is during the drier months.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Davao is the third most important Philippines city after Manila and Cebu. Three domestic airlines fly several times a day between Davao and Manila: AirAsia, Cebu Pacific, and Philippines Airlines. There are also direct flights from other Philippine cities: Cebu, Cagayan de Oro, Iloilo City, Zamboanga City, Bacolod, Angeles, Puerto Princesa, Boracay, Dumaguete, Tacloban, Tagbilaran.
If you have Davao as your main destination in the Philippines, you might want to consider coming in through Singapore as it has direct flights to Davao.

Scoot/Singapore Airlines  flies daily from Singapore.
Garuda Indonesia flies from Manado.
Qatar has flights from Doha
7.126211125.64361 Davao International Airport (Francisco Bangoy International Airport, DVO  IATA). The airport has a tourist information counter (but not always staffed) where you can buy prepaid SIM cards. (updated Sep 2016)
Ground transportation: A (metered) taxi from the Davao Airport to downtown Davao costs about ₱200-300, as of 2023. Using Grab app is neither necessary nor cheaper - you'll just pay ₱25 on top of the meter. After walking out from the terminal, you may be greeted by a few people offering you a ride to the city for a substantially higher (₱500) price. They're not annoying though, and even may show you the way where to go (less than 1 minute to the right) if you tell them you want a metered taxi.
It's also possible to catch a jeepney ₱20 to town center by walking to the highway (5-10 min walk).

By ferry[edit]
The Davao River
There are passenger ferries coming to/from Samal Island and Talikud Island. Another good way to get from Davao city to Samal Island is by the Island City Express buses that use the 24/7 car ferry from Sasa over to Babak on Samal island. The ticket price for the bus and ferry combined is ₱30. If you just use the Car Ferry the ticket costs ₱10 per person. Island city Express buses go all the way to Kaputian on Samal island. From (Santa Ana wharf) near Magsaysay park boats also leave for Samal island for ₱40.
The nearest port with long-distance passenger ferries to Manila, Cebu, Iloilo, Bacolod and Bohol Island are now at Cagayan de Oro port or Nasipit port 27 km from Butuan city.

By bus[edit]
Most buses depart and arrival at the Davao City Overland Transport Terminal (DCOTT) at Maya, Ecoland.
Getting there: It costs ₱70 by taxi or ₱12 by jeepney to go the 2 km from the bus terminal to downtown Davao.

Bachelor Express has buses from Surigao, Butuan, Bislig, Mati, Tandag, Ormoc, Tacloban and Tagbilaran.
Davao Metro Shuttle has buses from Tagum, Digos, Butuan, Kidapawan, Manila, Bansalan, Malita, Laak, Padada, Veruela and Ormoc.

Get around[edit]

By taxi[edit]
The simplest way to get around is by hopping into a taxi. A typical trip can cost about ₱100 or approximately US$2. Drivers in Davao do not normally bargain if they notice that you are a tourist, hence the cost of the trip is the same in price as a regular. Davao taxi drivers are regarded as the most honest taxi drivers in the Philippines. Taxi drivers in Davao City do not charge tourists extra fare unlike their counterparts in Cebu and Manila. You can also call or send an SMS to the cab company directly to have a cab driver pick you up.
Taxis start their fare at ₱40 and will add ₱3.50 per few hundred meters. Please do say "thank you" or "salamat" once you have arrived at your destination. Davao Taxis issue fare receipts that list the name of the taxi company, the plate number, and the taxi number which could come in handy if one leaves valuable items or documents inside a cab. Just tell your taxi driver if you want to get a receipt.

By jeepney[edit]
If you are up for more adventure, then do as the locals and catch a colorful jeepney. Ask around for which route to take to avoid getting lost. They are usually available 24 hours and cover most of the nooks and crannies of the city. This is the cheapest option for getting around. As of Sep 2022, the usual cost for a jeepney ride is ₱12 for every 4 km ride, and about a ₱1.80 increase per km when going beyond the 4 km (for regular passengers). A jeepney from downtown Davao to the Davao airport cost ₱21 and takes 45 min.
To pay, pass your fare to the person next to you, all the way to the driver or the conductor, by saying "bayad po". Paying the exact amount is highly recommended. To stop at a certain destination, say "lugar lang", "para", or knock your coins hard on the steel handle.

By car[edit]
Another alternative is to rent a car. There are many cars for rent. If you don't know the routes you can hire drivers by asking the attendant of the rental company. Local companies tend to be cheaper than the national ones.

Avis Car Rental. Airport view hotel. J Camus street. ☏ +63-82-2216430.
By bus[edit]
Buses are also available, but these tend to ply exclusively along the north–south route and going out and in the city area. Air conditioned buses to Calinan go from Bankeroham Public Market. Island City Buses go to Kaputian Samal Island via the car ferry at Sasa; these buses go past Magsaysay park ₱30.

By water taxi[edit]
Another mode of transportation around Davao Gulf is through a water taxi. Water taxis serve the daily commuters and visitors of Davao City, Samal Island, and neighbouring coastal municipalities around Davao Gulf. It will get you to the island, waterfront restaurant, or beach resort you wanted with comfort and ease. The pioneer water taxi service in the Philippines is found in Davao City and has the swift, safe and secure water transport, the best and most professional skippers and has a customer friendly and positive attitude, all incorporated to make your transfer easy and pleasurable.

Stay safe[edit]
Visiting Mindanao has its risks. Foreigners have been kidnapped, murdered and held for ransom. For this reason, many governments advise against all but necessary travel to Mindanao, Davao included. In most cases this means your travel insurance will not pay out if you make a claim. Contact your embassy and insurer before travelling to Davao.
Because of the work of the local government on strengthening security during the past decade Davao is generally a safe city even for travellers and violent crime is rare except few parts of downtown Davao are unsafe at night. Armed guards and security forces can be seen everywhere, guarding malls, hotels and public events. Your biggest concern should be pickpockets, who are active in downtown Davao and on jeepneys. If you leave Davao city, do your research as to the safety of the area, as the chances of something happening to you, e.g. being kidnapped, rapidly increases if you are a foreigner.

Respect[edit]
Negative criticism of Rodrigo Duterte's policies as mayor of the city or the city itself is not tolerated by many locals. Tread carefully when bringing anything about Rodrigo Duterte, especially if negative, such as his involvement in the Davao Death Squad. Davaoeños generally take pride of their former mayor and his family, and will take offense on any undue remarks. There are chances some famous people being declared persona non grata by the city for criticizing Duterte and his local policies.
