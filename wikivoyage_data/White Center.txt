The Rozella building in White Center

Understand[edit]
Just south of West Seattle with its business district centered along Delridge Way, White Center melds in with the rest of the area.  Nicknamed 'Rat City' the area has embraced the nic-name and made it a part of its punk rock mixed ethnicity identity.  A common bumper sticker in the area simply states 'White Center, not really white, not really centered'.
