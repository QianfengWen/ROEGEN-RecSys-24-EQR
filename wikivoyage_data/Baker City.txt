Do[edit]
 The Hells Canyon Scenic Highway. This is the southern end of the Hells Canyon Scenic Highway which follows Rte 86 east of town to the Snake River on the Oregon-Idaho border. The Scenic drive can be followed as a big loop around to Joseph and La Grande further to the north. Be aware that driving the entire loop may not be possible during winter as some roads are not maintained and can be blocked by snow. This situation may exist well into spring (ie: late April). Some of the roads traverse high terrain where winter snows may linger longer than you might expect.
