Church where J. S. Bach was baptised
Eisenach is a city in Thuringia, Germany. It is famous both as the birthplace of the Baroque composer Johann Sebastian Bach, as well as the city where Martin Luther lived as a child. It was while he was staying at Wartburg Castle that he translated the New Testament into German.
