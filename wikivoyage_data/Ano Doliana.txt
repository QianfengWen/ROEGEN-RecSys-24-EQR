Partial view of the village
Ano Doliana is a mountainous village built out of stone in the municipality of North Kynouria, eastern Arcadia, Greece. It extends at an altitude of 950 to 1,050 m, built amphitheatrically on the northern slopes of Mount Parnon. It is a protected traditional settlement.
It used to be the main residence of the inhabitants, but nowadays only a handful of them stay throughout the year, as most use it as their summer residence and instead overwinter in Kato Doliana because of the milder climate. In the 2010s, it has emerged as a relatively popular tourist destination, with a significant number of visitors, especially during the winter season weekends.
Τhe European long distance path E4 passes right through Ano Doliana, making it a hiking destination.
