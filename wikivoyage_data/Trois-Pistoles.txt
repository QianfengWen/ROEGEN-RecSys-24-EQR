Trois-Pistoles is a city of 3500 people (2011) in Bas St. Laurent in Quebec.  It is mainly known to English-speaking Canadians for its homestay language immersion program, which nearly doubles the population of the town each summer.


Understand[edit]

If you are in Trois-Pistoles, and you're not a language student, you are likely here because you are going to take a ferry to Les-Escoumins, or because you have just arrived by ferry. Nevertheless, the town is worth a short stopover and a cup of coffee  across from the church.
The town is said to have been named for a silver goblet worth three pistoles, an old French coin, that was lost in the river in the 17th century.
