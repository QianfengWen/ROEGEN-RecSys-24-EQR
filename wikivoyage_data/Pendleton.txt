Pendleton is a city of 17,000 people (2019) in Eastern Oregon.  The city is set in a pleasant valley set among hilly cropland on the I-84 several hours east of Portland.  It is the location of one of the manufacturing plants of Pendleton Woolen Mills.


Understand[edit]
The town is the cultural center of Eastern Oregon. Pendleton's "Old town" is listed as a Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places.
The Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation have their property nearby. They have established the Wildhorse Resort & Casino and golf course on the reservation to generate revenue for development and welfare. They have also built the Tamástslikt Cultural Institute, for education and interpretation of their cultures.

History[edit]
A European-American commercial center began to develop here in 1851, when Dr. William C. McKay established a trading post at the mouth of McKay Creek. The city was named Pendleton, after politician and diplomat George H. Pendleton (1825–1889), who served as a U.S. representative and senator from Ohio. 
By 1900, Pendleton had a population of 4,400 and was the fourth-largest city in Oregon. The Pendleton Woolen Mills and Pendleton Round Up became features of the city captured in early paintings by Walter S. Bowman. Like many cities in Eastern Oregon, where thousands of Chinese immigrant workers built the transcontinental railroad, it had a flourishing Chinatown that developed as the workers settled here. The sector is supposed to have been underlain by a network of tunnels, which are now a tourist attraction. The authenticity as a Chinese tunnel system has been questioned.

Climate[edit]
Pendleton has a semi-arid climate with short, cool winters and hot summers.
