historic downtown Red Lodge
Red Lodge is a town in south central Montana. About 2,200 people live there. It is located in the shadow of no less than 28 different 12,000-foot peaks. This charming town is nestled in the foothills of the Beartooth Mountains and is surrounded by Custer National Forest. The 69-mile Beartooth Scenic Drive has dramatic switchbacks overlooking snow-capped peaks, glaciers, alpine lakes and plateaus and is considered by many to be one of the most scenic roads in the country.
It is conveniently located between the major airport in Billings and the northeast entrance to Yellowstone National Park at Cooke City.


Understand[edit]
Historic Red Lodge is a resort and ranching community with a colorful coal mining past and surrounded by natural beauty.
The tourist town is busiest during the summer, with a small resurgence in winter for snow sports.
If you decide to go up the Beartooth, which you definitely should, be aware it is a slow drive along steep switchbacks. There is a great lookout area partway up which is the normal turnaround point. Get out and enjoy the trail and the view from up high.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Highway 212 leads from Cooke City and Yellowstone National Park and connects to I-90 and Billings Montana via 310 at Laurel (Montana).
Portions of Highway 212 only have one lane in each direction, and farmers living in the area may drive on the roadway with their heavy machinery. When that happens, cars will often proceed at a slow speed, resulting in congestion.

By plane[edit]
Billings Logan International Airport (BIL IATA), is the closest airport located 1901 Terminal Cir, +1 406 247-8609, e-mail: airport@ci.billings.mt.us, [1]. Billings Logan International is the major airport for Eastern Montana, and the busiest airport in the state.  Silver Airways uses it as their hub for service within the state, and it is additionally served by Allegiant, Alaska/Horizon, Delta, Frontier, Skywest and United. Denver, Salt Lake City, and Minneapolis are the biggest hubs serving Billings.
Get around[edit]

Stay safe[edit]
Bear country. Be bear aware before you start exploring the wilderness. Plenty of other wildlife may come close. Remember they are wild and can react badly to people. Keep your distance and enjoy watching.
Dehydration can be an issue even if you don't notice you are thirsty. Be sure you pack water on a hike and stop to drink along the way. Even though the streams look crystal clear, giardia parasites can be present. Do not drink from the stream (unless you boil the water) or you could be very sick.
