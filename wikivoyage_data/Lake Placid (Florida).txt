Lake Placid is a city in the Florida Heartland.


Get in[edit]
The center of town is between a few lakes, primarily Lake June-in-Winter and the larger Lake Istokpoga. The one that shares the name of the town, Lake Placid, is to the south. US-27 is the main road through the town and it follows a north-south path between these lakes. Interlake Blvd goes west-east between the lakes, as its name implies, intersecting US-27 and connecting it to a railroad crossing and the roundabout. FL-70 passes east-west to the south of Lake Placid, connecting with US-27 and Bradenton to the northwest. It leads to the Fort Pierce area to the northeast.

27.301-81.35732 Lake Placid Tower (Tower of Peace). The height of the building is a debated, with sources varying between 235 ft (72 m) and 270 ft (82 m). Formerly an observation tower, it was built in 1960 and opened for tourism on New Year's Day in 1961. When it opened it was the world's tallest concrete structure, and it may have as many as 90,000 concrete blocks. It closed in 1982 due to financial difficulties and re-opened in 1986, only to close again in the early 2000s. A restaurant at the bottom of the tower remained open until 2015. The building was used as a cell phone tower during the 2000s and 2010s, but its use ceased in 2020 and today the structure is abandoned.   (updated Aug 2021)
