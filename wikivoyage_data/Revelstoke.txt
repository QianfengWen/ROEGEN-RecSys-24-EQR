Revelstoke is a city of 6,700 people (2016) in the Columbia-Rockies section of the Kootenays in British Columbia. Tourism is an important feature of the local economy, with skiing having emerged as the most prominent attraction. Revelstoke is in prime black bear and grizzly bear habitat.


Understand[edit]
Illecillewaet River Bridge
The city is on the banks of the Columbia River just south of the Revelstoke Dam and near its confluence with the Illecillewaet River. East of Revelstoke are the Selkirk Mountains and Glacier National Park, penetrated by Rogers Pass used by the Trans-Canada Highway and the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). South of the community down the Columbia River are the Arrow Lakes and the Kootenays. West of the city is Eagle Pass through the Monashee Mountains and the route to Shuswap Lake.
Revelstoke's economy has traditionally been tied to the CPR, and it maintains a strong connection to that industry. However forestry, construction, tourism and retail have increased over the past decades. Today, telecommuters, freelancers, tech workers and entrepreneurs play an increasingly important role in Revelstoke's success.

History[edit]
Revelstoke was founded in the 1880s when the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) was built through the area; mining was an important early industry. It was named Farwell, after a local land owner and surveyor. Until then, the spot was called the Second Crossing, to differentiate it from the first crossing of the Columbia River by the CPR at Donald. The city was named by the CPR in appreciation of Lord Revelstoke, head of the UK investment bank that saved the railway from bankruptcy in the summer of 1885 by buying the company's unsold bonds, enabling the railway to reach completion.
The construction of the Trans-Canada Highway in 1962 further eased access to the region. 
Revelstoke holds the Canadian record for snowiest single winter. 2447 cm (80 feet) of snow fell on Mt. Copeland outside town during the winter of 1971-72. The townsite received 779 cm and snow levels were higher than many roofs around town by more than a few metres.
