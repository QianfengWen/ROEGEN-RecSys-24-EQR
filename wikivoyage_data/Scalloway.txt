Scalloway (Old Norse Skálavágr, "bay with the large house") is a fishing village in the Shetland Islands. It was the capital of these islands until 1708 when Lerwick supplanted it. The population in 2011 was 900.


Get in[edit]
Scalloway Castle
Scalloway is six miles from Lerwick by a good road, so 10 min by car or 30 min by bike should do it.
Andrews Bus 4 runs from Lerwick to Scalloway hourly M-Sa, taking 25 min and continuing along the shore to Port Arthur. This connects four times a day with Bus 5 from Scalloway to Trondra, Hamnavoe and Papil on West Burra, and Houss on East Burra.

Get around[edit]

60.1356-1.2741 Scalloway Castle, Castle St ZE1 0TQ, ☏ +44 1856 841815. Daylight hours. The former living quarters of Earl Patrick Stewart, built in 1600 by slave labour but ruined after his downfall. The key is available from the Scalloway Museum (opposite) during normal opening hours, but closed for restoration as of Sep 2022. The place occasionally gets mobbed by cruise ship tourists, but is otherwise quiet, so you have the agreeable experience of holding the key to a castle and letting yourself in. It's impressive but just a roofless shell. Free.   (updated Sep 2022)
 Scalloway Museum, Castle Street (opposite castle), ☏ +44 1595 880734. May-Sep: M-F 11AM-4PM, Su 2-4PM, closed Sa.

60.1637-1.25423 Tingwall Loch, 2 km north on B9074, is a freshwater loch with bird life, including mute swans. The little promontory at its north end, "Law Ting Holm", was an islet and the site of Shetland's parliament (Thing) until the 16th century, but there's little to see there now. The Murder Stone is a 2-m granite slab by the roadside at the south end of the loch. There's various legends about the murder, but in the parliament of those days it might not even have got you rebuked.
60.129-1.2754 Scalloway Islands are a chain of little islands linked to the mainland by road. Follow B9074 south, crossing first onto Trondra which is just farmland, then to West Burra which has the village of Hamnavoe (a common place name meaning "sheltered harbour"). There's a B&B here and a couple of self-catering cottages. The lane continues south for a mile then one fork crosses to East Burra to end at Houss, where The Outpost cafe is well-named. The other fork stays on West Burra to end at Papil. Both forks end in spits, with paths but no road to extensions of the peninsula: Houss Ness on East Burra beyond Houss, and Kettla Ness on West Burra beyond Papil.
Yet(i) more islands: the Scalloway archipelago includes a scattering of others, nowadays uninhabited. South Havra and Little Havra are the pair south of the Burras. Oxna, Papa, Hildasay, Langa and Linga are the group seen west of Trondra and Ness of Westshore. They've been likened to a yeti's footprint.
