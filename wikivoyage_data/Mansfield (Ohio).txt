Closed but can be seen from the street. Peter Bissman built the Bissman Building in 1886 for his expanded wholesale grocery store. In the early 1930s, residents of Downtown Mansfield would wake up to the rich aromas of the store’s personal coffee blends and return home to the smell of roasting peanuts. The building possesses an early Romantic Gothic style that closely resembles the Ohio State Reformatory. Both were designed by same architect, built the same year and both are believed to be haunted. In Shawshank Redemption the exterior served as the Brewer Hotel halfway house where Brooks and Red went to after their release from prison. The room where Brooks & Red stayed in was filmed at the Ohio State Reformatory while the Food Way where they worked as a grocery bagger was filmed at the KV Market which is listed among local grocery stores under "Eat" in the below. The front room of the Bissman Building served as the offices of the Portland Daily Bugle in the film where the editor received the warden's accounting ledgers accompanied by a letter explaining the warden's illegal activities. The Bissman Building is now vacant and is believed to be haunted. (updated Oct 2019)

The Ohio State Reformatory (OSR), also known as the Mansfield Reformatory, is a historic prison located in Mansfield, Ohio in the United States. It was built between 1886 and 1910 and remained in operation until 1990, when a United States Federal Court ruling (the 'Boyd Consent Decree') ordered the facility to be closed. While this facility was seen in a number of films (including several while the facility was still in operation), TV shows and music videos, it was made famous by the film The Shawshank Redemption (1994) when it was used for most scenes of the movie. In addition to Shawshank Redemption, other filming productions produced there are Air Force One (1997); Tango & Cash (1989); Escape Plan 3: The Extractors (2019), among other movies, television programs and music videos, other activities and tours take place throughout the year.

40.7624-82.50637 Old Westinghouse Warehouse Factory (a big open lot south of E 5th & Wayne St, in the old industrial part of town.). The factory was built in 1918 by Westinghouse, one of 39 factories in the U.S. with 5 stories on 4 acres along E 5th St. The Mansfield location was where they manufactured household appliances. By 1955 operations peaked with a workforce of 8,177 people working in 16 buildings on 42 acres. Westinghouse was the largest employer in Mansfield employing 1/3 of the city's populace of that time. By 1990 Westinghouse closed its Mansfield operations and the buildings stood empty till 2011 when the main buildings were demolished while others still stand. Scenes from the inside of the cell blocks of the fictional Shawshank Prison were filmed in a purpose built set built within the main Westinghouse Warehouse building that once stood along E 5th and Wayne St (demolished in 2011) while some scenes of Escape Plan 3: The Extractors were filmed in the nearby building on E 5th and Newman St by the railroad tracks (still standing on 200 E 5th St). The majority of the scenes of both films were filmed at the Mansfield Reformatory (see above).   (updated Apr 2020)

Bromfield also hosted Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall's wedding and honeymoon at Malabar Farm in 1945.

40.65024-82.3950410 Ceely Rose House. The Miller's house, mentioned in the Pleasant Valley collection of ghost stories, was the 19th-century home of a young, mentally challenged girl named Ceely Rose. In 1896, Ceely Rose murdered her three-person family by poisoning their food with arsenic. Annually in October, the Ceely Rose Play is performed in the park's timber frame barn, as part of a ghost story trilogy. The other two plays are Phoebe Wise and Louie. In 2014, an episode of Ghost Hunters was filmed at the Ceely Rose House (updated Oct 2019)

40.6535-82.392814 "Shawshank Tree" The white oak tree became a major tourist attraction following the filming of Shawshank Redemption. In the film the tree is in a hayfield near Buxton where Red (Morgan Freeman) went to find the box containing a letter and some money Andy had left for him after Red's release. A lightning strike cut the tree in half in 2011, and it toppled over in 2016 in a windstorm. The tree stood on private land across the road from Malabar Farm State Park so whatever is left of it can only be seen from the main public road. It's located across the street from the main entrance into the park along Pleasant Hill Rd.
The following are a couple of sites in the rural areas south of Malabar Farm State Park, near the town of Butler, and one location in town where scenes from Shawshank Redemption were filmed which may be of an interest to movie buffs.
