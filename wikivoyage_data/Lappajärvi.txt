This is definitely the main attraction of the area and has a very particular reason of existence. It was created by a meteorite impact 77 million years ago. This asteroid of 1.6 km left a crater with a 23-km diameter – nowadays the largest lake of the region. Its deepest point is 38 m. It is possible to feel the space atmosphere once in the area, because many places are decorated with meteorite rocks and space images, especially the Kivitippu Hotel. People can learn about meteorites, and space. It is possible to find pieces of Kärnäiitti, a unique type of rock formed in the impact from the meteorite. Lappajärvi is the only place in the world where this rock can be found. There is a captivating view from all the different points around the lake. You can drive around it by car or bike, a 80-km drive. Many water sports tournaments take place here every year. The Lappajärven Lohisoutu trolling competition captivates about 150 boats every summer.   (updated Feb 2017)
