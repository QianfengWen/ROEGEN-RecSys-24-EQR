Fredericksburg is a city of 10,500 people (2010) in Texas, west of Austin and north of San Antonio.


Understand[edit]
Fredericksburg was settled by immigrant families from Germany in 1846, led by John O. Meusebach. Although settlement was on Comanche frontier, the Meusebach-Comanche Treaty of following year established lasting peace. Many older buildings retain traditional German styles; several units comprise the National Historic District. German is still spoken occasionally, and old customs are regularly observed: Schuetzenfests (marksmanship tournaments), Oktoberfest, Weihnachten, and Kinderfest. Visitors are attracted by the scenic beauty, European atmosphere, historic landmarks, excellent fall and winter hunting, and famous bread and pastries. It is the birthplace of Fleet Adm. Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet during World War II.

 Fredericksburg Visitors Bureau, 302 East Austin, toll-free: +1-888-997-3600, chamberasst@fbgtx.org. Offers specific help and assistance, restrooms, internet access, maps, and local information.

Primary access to Fredericksburg is by private car.  It's about 40 miles north of IH-10 on US-87, north west of San Antonio (71 mi total drive), or about 80 miles west of Austin on US-290.
The closest commercial airport is San Antonio International (SAT IATA).  Fly in there and rent a car.

You can stay a week and probably not have time to see all the local restaurants. German cuisine with a hill country flair is what you'll most often see.  Most local places close at 9PM unless otherwise noted. A surprising number of places do not take credit cards, so check for a logo or a sign, or carry some cash.
