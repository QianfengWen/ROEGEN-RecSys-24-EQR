Stirling is a city in the central lowlands of Scotland, and historically the county town of  Stirlingshire. For centuries this was the main route between the Highlands and the Lowlands, guarded by the castle on its battleship of a crag, and with the River Forth sweeping round as a moat. The Scots won two famous victories against the English on the nearby fields, at Stirling Bridge and at Bannockburn. Medieval Scottish rulers made it their residence and capital.
Stirling had a population of 37,730 in 2024. The city limits include Bridge of Allan, the village north of the river which is now the campus for Stirling University, and Dunblane further north; these are described on their own pages.


Understand[edit]
Stirling Castle
The River Forth meanders east out of the Trossachs across a broad plain, and swells when it's joined by the River Teith - this made Stirling the lowest point that early architects could span with a bridge. A few miles downstream the river becomes tidal, and you had to cross by ferry until modern times. So if you controlled the bridge at Stirling, you controlled the all-weather route between Edinburgh and the Highlands. Better still, you got to levy tolls and taxes on everyone who needed to pass. 
The city was inevitably bashed about in several conflicts, the last at the hands of the Jacobites, who in 1746 failed to capture the castle and blew up their own ammo depot in pique. Stirling has since then been a quiet market town, making its living from agriculture. Before the railways, huge cattle drives would plod over the bridge and through town towards southern markets, even as far as London Smithfield. When 19th and 20th century heavy industry developed, this was to the south around Falkirk and downstream in Grangemouth, Fife and the Lothians; Stirling was relatively untouched and preserved its old centre. There's nowadays a ring of light industry and suburbs, but the big boost was the 1967 establishment of the University of Stirling. This has some 8500 undergraduates and 4000 postgraduates.
