An Ann Arbor street in winter
Ann Arbor—often abbreviated as AA or A2—is a picturesque city surrounding the University of Michigan. It has a strong bent toward the arts, and an attractive and pedestrian-friendly downtown. Visitors enjoy the city's wonderful sidewalk cafe dining, unique shops, lots of bookstores, and abundant cultural opportunities.
Ann Arbor is in Michigan 35 miles (56 km) north of the Ohio border and 45 miles (72 km) west of Detroit, near where the furthest exurban fringes give way to country and small towns. In 2019, the city had a population of about 120,000 people, and thousands of visitors come to town for football games and various festivals.

Looking across S. University Street at the outside of the Law Quadrangle
Ann Arbor is centered on the University of Michigan. The U of M campus intermingles with downtown, and the whole area is walkable, though day buses run between the campuses and the central business district. Toyota, General Motors, Ford, Thomson, Google, and Domino's have a major presence in the area. The university is well known for its medical school complex.
Farther out, the city fades into urban sprawl (a mall and business parks in the south), then countryside dotted with towns, and to the east, Detroit suburbs. Bus routes beyond the city limits, except in the direction of Ypsilanti, are lacking; you'll want a car or bike unless you have several hours to spare. On some autumn Saturdays, transport is difficult as 100,000-odd people pour in for university football games.
Ann Arbor, or Tree town, is, as one might expect, full of trees; they line the streets, and in summer from the air, or year-round in Google Earth, all that can be seen is a green swath with a few buildings sticking out. (In the early 20th century, after having leveled the forest that once occupied the area, the city instituted an aggressive tree-planting program that's since borne fruit.)
The city was founded in 1824 as "Annarbour", named after the two founders' wives (Ann Allen and Mary Ann Rumsey) and an arbor of burr oak trees on the village site (although some have theorized that the name arose from an arbor of roses or grapes).
Like most of Michigan, summers can be hot and humid, with temperatures occasionally hitting 90 °F (32 °C), but averaging in the mid 80s. Winters are fairly normal for the lower Great Lakes region, which enjoys 4 seasons. It starts to be chilly in late October and it begins to warm up again in mid-March (but the occasional early April snowfall is not unheard of!) Average winter temperatures are generally in the range of 30 °F (−1 °C) and in January temps can dip below 20 °F (−7 °C), or even lower if it's windy.  Summers can get quite hot; in July and early-August it can hit high into the 90s with high humidity.
Downtown is a solid block of restaurants and art galleries. The university hosts cultural events, and venues such as the Michigan Theater host first-run independent films and high-profile music groups. Several good independent bookshops are located here, and the Ann Arbor Art Fair draws over half a million visitors each summer.

Map of Ann Arbor


By car[edit]
Ann Arbor is bounded by I-94 (between Detroit and Jackson) on the south and west, US-23 (between Flint and Toledo, Ohio) on the east, and M-14 (which leads to Detroit's western suburbs and I-96) on the north. From Toledo and other points south of Ann Arbor, take US-23 north; from Detroit, the airport, and points east, take I-94 west (or I-96 west to M-14 west); from Chicago and points west, take I-94 east; from the north, take US-23 south. There is ample paid parking downtown, but very little is on the curb (most is in parking garages). An option is to use the Ann Arbor Transportation Authority (AATA) park and ride lots, which lie on the outskirts of Ann Arbor. There are five such lots with free parking around the city, and bus service to each.

Get around[edit]
Downtown Ann Arbor is not large, so it's easy to get around just by walking. In fact, free parking is almost nonexistent, especially when the town is full of students, so you'll probably prefer to walk anyway. Occasionally you'll find an unused parking meter; you'll have to feed it money between 8AM-6PM on weekdays and Saturdays, otherwise they're free. There are parking lots and buildings scattered around downtown; they're free on Sundays, otherwise you can generally expect to pay around 80 cents to $1 per hour.

The main auditorium also hosts other events throughout the year, particular musical groups and comedy shows, many fairly well-known.   
42.2795-83.74053 State Theater, 233 S State St, ☏ +1 734 761-8667. An art-deco cinema from 1942, the State Theater works in conjunction with the Michigan Theater, and often plays films that have stopped showing at the Michigan.

42.27434-83.73946 The University of Michigan Law School Quadrangle (on South University Street between State Street and Tappan Street). The Law School's "Quad", nationally renowned for its serene environment and beautiful gothic-style architecture, is just south of the center of campus. Built in the early 20th century, the Quad consists of Hutchins Hall — the main law school building — the reading room and the U-shaped Lawyer's Club. The reading room (open to visitors) is an enormous cathedral-like building with stained glass windows featuring the colors of major universities in the US and around the world. The underground law library is naturally lit by enormous windowed shafts just beyond the Quad. The Quad is a grassy open space ringed by trees and seasonal flower beds. During the warmer seasons, students relax and toss the ball around, or sit and study in the Quad, making it an integral part of the Law School. Many locals consider the Law Quad to be the most beautiful part of Ann Arbor. 
42.2767-83.73877 University of Michigan Diag (between N University Street and S University Street). The heart of the University of Michigan's Central Campus, the Diag is the main quadrangle around which most of the key buildings on campus are arranged. Its name comes from the primary walkway that runs from the northwest to southeast corners of the Diag. In the middle of the Diag, just in front of the graduate library, is a brick courtyard with a brass M in the center; according to student legend, if you step on the M during your first semester at the university, you are doomed to fail your first exam. The Diag is often used for demonstrations, booths or student fairs, and is a popular hangout in warm weather.

The current operational hours are posted at the base of the tower.   
42.2813-83.72339 Nichols Arboretum. It's in a secluded plot just east of the University of Michigan Hospital. "The Arb" is a favorite place to enjoy peace and quiet in a setting removed from the bustle and traffic of everyday Ann Arbor. The Arb has no signage, no parking lot of its own, nor any restroom facilities. What it has is an impressive peony garden, many different species of native trees, shrubs, and grasses, and the Huron River runs through it. A gem that's worth seeking out.   
 Domino's Farms, US-23 and Plymouth Rd, ☏ +1 734 930-4425. A large office park in a pastoral location, home to the world headquarters of Domino's Pizza. Visitors will go mostly for one of two attractions:

There are trails to stroll, a greenhouse to visit, and plantings to enjoy. Every spring, Matthei hosts a plant sale that is very popular with gardeners. Free.   
Public art[edit]
The Cube, taking a breather between spins
Ann Arbor has a number of public sculptures and murals that can be viewed both on campus and downtown. Of these, several are particularly well-known:

42.275942-83.74187613 The Cube, Maynard Street and E Jefferson Street (Regents Plaza north of the Michigan Union). A 15-foot-tall, 2400-lb glossy black cube created by Tony Rosenthal; there's a similar one in the East Village of New York City. The Cube spins on its axis when pushed. Although Tony Rosenthal cubes often appear identical, the late artist always varied design elements on each of his cubes. Alamo has a distinctive curve element whereas Ann Arbor is more geometric.   
42.2932-83.711714 The Wave Field, Hayward Avenue (in the courtyard outside the Francois-Xavier Bagnoud building). Created by Maya Lin, the Wave Field is an earth sculpture, 90 feet by 90 feet square, consisting of a series of fifty grass waves in eight rows. 
42.2795-83.742415 Alley mural, E Liberty Street, by the Liberty Square parking structure. The alley mural began as a one-man project in the 1980s and became a popular spot for graffiti artists. The city took the spot over in 1999 by hiring artist Katherine Tombeau Cost to paint over the original mural and graffiti with a new 5,000-square-foot mural. The graffiti artists haven't entirely relinquished their claim to it, meaning that Cost's mural has been partially defaced with large bubble lettering, but it's still an interesting (and out-of-the-way) sight. Be sure to seek out the "trippers'" bubble gum wall toward the back. During warmer weather, you'll often find musicians or dancers putting on solo performances in the alley entrance, hoping to glean donations. 
42.2793-83.74116 Bookstore mural (corner of E Liberty Street and S State Street). Painted in 1984, when the corner location was still occupied by David's Books, this mural depicts the five authorial visages of Woody Allen, Edgar Allan Poe, Herman Hesse, Franz Kafka, and Anaïs Nin. 
 Painted fixtures, throughout downtown. Fire hydrants and transformers, painted in bright colors by local artists and schoolchildren. 
 Fairy Doors, throughout downtown. Keep your eyes near the ground for fairy doors-- miniature colorful doors through which fairies can enter local businesses. According to Jonathan B. Wright of urban-fairies.com, the doors began appearing around town in the early 1990s. 
Parks and gardens[edit]

Events[edit]
The Tempest at Shakespeare in the Arb
Part of the South University Art Fair
42.283-83.75118 Ann Arbor Film Festival, 203 E Ann St, ☏ +1 734 995-5356. Held during six days in late March at the Michigan Theater (603 E Liberty Street). The oldest festival of its kind in North America, showcasing over 100 independent and experimental films and videos annually, since 1963. Over 20 prizes are awarded to the best films. Passes are available for single screenings, single days, weekends or the entire week.   
 University Musical Society, ☏ +1 734 764-2538. The University Musical Society annually presents a series of concerts by world-renowned artists at Hill Auditorium, the Power Center, the Michigan Theater, or Rackham Auditorium. Price varies according to performance. 
 Hash Bash, University of Michigan Diag near State St and N University St. Held the first Saturday in April. The Hash Bash began when poet John Sinclair was jailed for marijuana possession, leading John Lennon and Yoko Ono to headline a protest rally in Ann Arbor in 1971. Beginning in 1972, it became an annual event to commemorate the occasion and support the reform of marijuana laws. The Hash Bash is a gathering point for thousands of cannabis aficionados from all around, with guest speakers in the Diag attracting large crowds. Given the nature of the event, you probably will see people smoking marijuana; those who do light up tend to take advantage of the difference in fines between the town ($25) and the university ($100 and possible jail time), which basically means that your punishment depends on which side of State Street you stand on. Vendors sell everything from hemp bracelets to "glass art" (actually pipes and bongs, but who's quibbling?), bongo drums are played, and people-watching can be an event in itself.   
 Naked Mile, University of Michigan campus. Once held in mid-April at midnight on the last day of classes. A tradition at the University of Michigan which began in 1986, in which hundreds of students — traditionally graduating seniors, although in practice there's a broader spread — ran across campus naked, while spectators cheered them on, to celebrate the end of the school year. Although it is illegal, it was tolerated by local police until 1998, when they began attempting to strongly discourage continuation of the Naked Mile, fueled in part by concerns over outsiders videotaping the event and selling the recordings online. To avoid being arrested, students often run the Mile in body paint, underwear, or a day earlier than usual. 
 Ann Arbor Book Festival, 311-315 S State St, ☏ +1 734 369-3366. Held in mid-May. First organized in 2004 to promote reading, heighten awareness of literacy challenges, and showcase the rich culture of the written word in Michigan and beyond.

 Shakespeare in the Arb, 1610 Washington Heights, ☏ +1 734 647-7600. Shows begin at 6:30PM. Annual outdoor Shakespearean production since 2001, held on weekends in June. Roving performance requires the actors and audience to shift locations throughout the Arb from scene to scene.

 Ann Arbor Summer Festival, 522 S Fourth Ave, Ste B, ☏ +1 734 994-5999. Held from mid-June to mid-July. An annual event since 1983 with different nightly indoor cultural performances: singers, musical bands, dancers, comedians, plays, and other acts including acrobats and animal handlers. 
 TEDxUofM. Held annually since 2008, the student run satellite TED conference is an awesome showcase of what people associated with the University of Michigan have accomplished. Ticket prices vary and location changes every year. At TEDxUofM you'll be inspired, meet interesting people, and have great discussions. The event is generally held sometime in Spring. Free. 
 Top of the Park, Ingalls Mall. Held from mid-June to early July. Nightly local and regional live bands, outdoor film screenings at 10PM, and concession booths from eight local eateries. Traditionally this event was held on the upper level of the Fletcher parking structure, next to the Power Center — hence the name — but it has been temporarily moved outside the Rackham School of Graduate Studies. In inclement weather, performances and films may be cancelled. Free. 
 Ann Arbor Art Fairs, ☏ +1 734 994-5260, toll-free: +1-800-888-9487. One week in late July. W-F 10AM-9PM, Sa 10AM-6PM. Held throughout downtown, four juried art fairs that display and sell art: the original Ann Arbor Street Art Fair along N University; the Ann Arbor Summer Art Fair along Main, Liberty, William and State; the State Street Area Art Fair; and the South University Art Fair. In practical terms, it's all one great big fair that takes about a full day to explore if you move quickly and don't look at every booth. Prices are generally rather high, as befitting an art show of this calibre, but there are definitely bargains to be found, as well as some less expensive non-juried booths that tag along for the ride. Loads of concessions, live entertainment, and booths with great sales from local businesses are scattered throughout. During the Art Fair, hotels are generally booked up and parking can be difficult to find, so book a room early (by February or March) and find a spot at one of the park-and-ride stops to catch a bus into downtown.

Eat[edit]
Outdoor dining on Main Street
For a relatively small Great Lakes town, Ann Arbor has a large variety of cheap (and sometimes quirky) eateries (thanks in part to the large student population) such as pizza restaurants, quick Chinese food and lots of sandwich and wrap shops downtown. You'll also notice hot dog and tamale carts on many street corners, particularly in the summer, selling basic fare starting at $1 with complimentary toppings. As alternative to restaurants the regional supermarket Busch's have good salads and sushi.
One thing you won't see much of, however, at least on campus and in the downtown area, are popular nationwide fast-food chains. The impression is that Ann Arbor is proud enough of its small independent restaurants that it has no need for mass-produced french fries (although with rental costs rising in the downtown area, many local restaurants — and shops — are being ousted in favor of wealthier small chains, like Bruegger's and Great Wraps).
For the more refined palate, there's no shortage of fine dining. Between Ann Arbor's vibrant cultural life and its sizeable international population, there seems to be considerable demand for the fancy and the exotic. There are certainly a few restaurants in town that can empty your wallet singlehandedly, but don't let their reputations scare you away: at even the priciest restaurants, there are dishes that you can order for a more modest fee, if you just want to sample the atmosphere. During warmer weather, be sure to check out the eateries on Main Street that offer outdoor sidewalk dining. It's a popular alternative, especially for the locals who have just suffered through six months of winter, and even though you're sitting right by the street, it's more relaxing than you might expect.
If you're looking for an Ann Arbor specialty, the fragel — a raisin bagel that has been deep-fried and rolled in cinnamon sugar — seems to have originated here. Once available all over town, now you can only find them at the Bagel Fragel on Plymouth Rd or certain Paneras.

Sleep[edit]
Map showing the hotel districts in Ann Arbor
There are four main hotel districts in Ann Arbor: near campus; in the southern part of town, where State Street meets I-94 (including Boardwalk St, Briarwood Cir and Victors Way); in the southeastern part of town, near the intersection of Washtenaw Rd and US-23 (including Carpenter Rd); and in the northeastern part of town, by the intersection of Plymouth Rd and US-23 (including Green Rd). There are also a few in the northwestern part of town, near the intersection of Jackson Ave and I-94. Accommodations tend to be the most expensive in the campus area, so unless you're here for a conference or business trip that's being paid for, you'll probably want to look further out.
Hotels in the campus area are within easy walking distance of downtown Ann Arbor and most of the attractions. The southeastern area is served by two AATA bus lines, route 4 (along Washtenaw) and route 22 (along Carpenter), and the northwestern area is along route 9. The other two areas aren't quite as well linked, although route 2 does go along part of Plymouth Rd, and the commuter 36 stops at Wolverine Tower, which is a short walk from the hotels along State and Boardwalk. However, you'll most likely want to use your car to get around if you're staying outside of downtown.

Stay safe[edit]
Ann Arbor is generally a very safe town, though the usual rules about common sense (being aware of your surroundings after dark and knowing where you are going) apply here as they would anywhere. The only really common crimes in town are those that you find in any other university town. Theft is the biggie, as many university students who leave their bags unattended in the library or those who fail to lock their bikes can tell you. There's also the occasional mugging or sexual assault, but these tend to occur after dark, so if you're not wandering the streets at 2AM, you probably don't have anything to worry about. Having said that, wandering the streets at 2AM in downtown Ann Arbor is generally quite safe and not at all frightening; there are usually enough students out partying or hanging out with friends until the wee hours that you won't feel like a lone target, or like you're in a dangerous crowd.  U of M Police, Ann Arbor Police, and the Washtenaw County Sheriff patrol regularly and are not difficult to find — indeed, alcohol violations such as drinking on the street from an open container are vigorously policed.  There are emergency phones located all over campus.

Connect[edit]
Internet[edit]
Free wi-fi access is plentiful at local cafes.

42.2307-83.72592 Digital Ops, 3990 Varsity Dr, ☏ +1 734 994-1595. Internet access and multiplayer gaming facility with mostly PC video games. The atmosphere is very friendly and social. 
42.2782-83.745713 Ann Arbor District Library, 343 S Fifth Ave (Main Branch), ☏ +1 734 327-4200 (all branches). The main branch of the public library, located downtown a couple of blocks from Main Street, offers wifi and a couple dozen desktop computers for visitor use. Check in at the desk on the second floor.   
Cope[edit]
Radio stations[edit]
Four good public radio stations are within listening distance.

WCBN-FM Ann Arbor, 88.3 FM.  Located in the basement of the Student Activities building at the University of Michigan you will find the studios of WCBN.  The format is total freeform -- DJs have complete control over their shows -- which makes the broadcasts a mixed bag.  The variety is stunning, though, from Sounds of the Subcontinent to emo to classic jazz to Noise Till Noon.  They also broadcast a list of upcoming concerts around town at regular intervals.
WEMU, 89.1 FM.  News, jazz and blues, with a tilt toward little-known fusion and crossover, from the campus of Eastern Michigan University.  Consistent quality -- you'll either like almost all of it, or very little.  News updates on the hour, and in the early morning and midafternoon.
WUOM, 91.7 FM.  Talk radio from NPR and PRI.
WDET, 101.9 FM.  News and music during the day; electronica-tinged underground music at night.  Broadcast from Wayne State University in Detroit.
Newspapers[edit]
 Michigan Daily, ☏ +1 734 763-2459. The student newspaper.   
Go next[edit]
The rest of Washtenaw County has quite a few charming little towns and villages that you might enjoy visiting.

Ypsilanti is about 15 minutes east on I-94, but practically contiguous with Ann Arbor if you're driving down Washtenaw Avenue; four AATA bus routes travel from downtown Ann Arbor to downtown Ypsilanti.
Dexter is about 15 minutes west on I-94.
Saline is about 15 minutes south on US-23.
Chelsea is about 20 minutes west on I-94.
Manchester is about 30 minutes southwest on I-94 and MI-52.
Milan is about 30 minutes south on US-23.
If you'd rather get out of the county, there are some larger cities and towns a short drive away.

Dundee is about 30 minutes south on I-23. Most people go for the nearest branch of Cabela's, an enormous outdoor outfitter and hunting/fishing/camping store, but it also has a nice little downtown. A 20-minute drive from Dundee along MI-50 will bring you to Tecumseh, a charming village with a great downtown and some very nice restaurants, including a British imports shop with a quaint tea café.
Detroit is about 45 minutes east on either I-94 or I-96. If you're not visiting downtown Detroit, you might want to stop in some of the suburbs. There's a nice movie theatre and good restaurants (as well as the only IKEA in Michigan) in nearby Canton; Novi and Troy (home of the impressive Somerset Collection mall) are good for shopping; Hamtramck has a sizeable Polish population, and Dearborn is home to the largest Middle Eastern community in the United States, as well as the fantastic Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village.
Lansing is about 1 hour west on I-96. It's the state capital, and home to rival college Michigan State University.
Frankenmuth, which bills itself as "Michigan's #1 tourist attraction", is about 1 hour north on US-23. It's a great little tourist town with a Bavarian-style downtown, delicious all-you-can-eat fried chicken dinners, and a year-round Christmas store.
Toledo, Ohio is about 1 hour south on US-23. You'll pass several nice little villages on the way. In town, there's a great art museum, the world-class Toledo Zoo, and a neighborhood of old Victorian homes.
