Village of Rivière-Beaudette
Rivière-Beaudette is a recreational tourism municipality that is the gateway to southwestern Quebec, offering two stops for travellers on Autoroute 20. It is in Vaudreuil-Soulanges, in the administrative region of Montérégie, in Quebec.


Understand[edit]
Wedged between the border of Ontario, Saint-Télesphore, Saint-Polycarpe, Saint-Zotique, on the north of the St. Lawrence River, the riverside and rural landscapes of Rivière-Beaudette attract many visitors. The main attractions include:

nautical activities on the St. Lawrence River and on the Beaudette River; as well as the variety of services for boaters, via marinas and pleasure craft maintenance shops; its shores feature numerous removable private docks as they are brought ashore for the winter;
the 670-m canal, in the shape of a hook, located near Pointe-Lalonde, where a dozen house-chalets have been set up;
the waterfront resort on the Beaudette River and Lake Saint-François;
a golf course;
municipal parks, its sports and leisure facilities, and its program of activities;
a pedestrian path whose entrance is at 600, rue Léger; this trail is also accessible in winter;
Houses are concentrated mainly on the shore of Lake Saint-François and along the Beaudette River. This municipality has three villages:

that of the bay (to the west of the territory, overlooking Lake Saint-François) facing the Ontario border;
that of Pointe Lalonde overlooking Lake Saint-François between Pointe Beaudette and the limit of Saint-Zotique, as well as extending upstream on the Beaudette River to Route 328;
as well as the main village of Rivière-Beaudette, extending north of Route 328, straddling the Beaudette River.
The local economy is based on the recreational tourism industry (especially pleasure boating and resorts), on services to travellers on Autoroute 20 (highway rest area and area of access ramps to Highway 325), as well as agriculture.
