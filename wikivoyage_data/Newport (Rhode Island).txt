Newport is a beautiful seaside city in Rhode Island that is famous for its genteel mansions and a rich history of yachting, golf, and tennis. With a population of only 25,000 (2020), this scenic resort town punches well above its weight and was known as the "Summer White House" throughout the 1950s and 60s.


Understand[edit]
The Breakers
One of the largest cities in the future United States during colonial times, Newport's decline in the early 19th century is good news for today's visitors, who can experience one of the nation's largest collections of intact colonial architecture; had Newport followed the same path as its former peer cities, its historic buildings might have been razed decades or even centuries ago. But Newport is even more well known for another historical period: the Gilded Age of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when some of America's most prominent families built eye-popping summer homes, which they called "cottages," along the waterfront. Many of the mansions are now open for tours.
Newport is also known for hosting many popular festivals, including the Newport Folk Festival and the Newport Jazz Festival. Cobblestone streets and brick sidewalks accent an upscale touristy downtown area with many shops, galleries and great restaurants, all located near the water. Newport sits on the southern end of Aquidneck Island and features several fine beaches, rocky cliffs and much history including an old fort.

Get around[edit]

Newport is a great town to walk or ride a bike in. Visitors will quickly notice others using bikes, scooters, and mopeds to circumvent city traffic. Many restaurants and shops are packed into the harbor area, which is perfect for walking, especially on a cool summer night. 

By car[edit]
Parking your car can get pretty difficult at certain times of the year, which is another benefit of walking. If you decide to take your car downtown, there are various locations that have parking meters. The meters take only quarters (15 minutes) and dimes (5 minutes), and allow you to park for 3 hours. In addition to meters, there are many parking lots that charge around 15-30 dollars for parking.

Be sure to look out for the Forty Steps; an amazing staircase leading into the ocean below. During Newport's Golden Age, the steps were a gathering place for servants and workers from the nearby mansions. Here they would hold weekend dances and play the Irish songs and music that reminded them of home. The bottom of the steps are also safe for swimmers, runners and walkers alike. To walk the trail, start at Newport's First Beach and follow the coast to Ocean Drive. While walking, watch out for poison ivy. Additionally, some portions of the walk drop off steeply into the water, rocks can be slippery, and the path is not fully paved; so proceed with caution. Most people complete the Cliff Walk in about 2-4 hours. While bikes are not permitted, dogs are as long as they are kept on a leash. There are no refreshments or picnic areas, so plan ahead. The north end is handicapped accessible and baby carriage accessible. There are multiple ways to exit the Cliff Walk, all of which lead back to Bellevue Avenue and the front side of the mansions. Walking back to your car can take a while, so consider the free RIPTA trolley as a viable return option. Free.   (updated Dec 2022)

Stay safe[edit]
Visitors awed by Newport's numerous mansions, immaculate public gathering places and well-preserved historic sites might be surprised to hear that the city has a higher-than-average crime rate. While it is generally very safe, visitors should take common sense precautions. Stay alert and aware of your surroundings in the same way you would in any densely populated area where criminals may seek to target the easily distracted.
One area where visitors should be particularly cautious is the Cliff Walk. Though crime is virtually unheard of here, more than a few people have been injured―some of them seriously so―while wandering off the path. Dramatic views come with the risk of dramatic falls. No matter how tempting a closer look may be, stay on the path and you'll have nothing to worry about.
