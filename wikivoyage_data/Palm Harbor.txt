Palm Harbor is a city in Pinellas County.


Understand[edit]
The town was developed as "Sutherland," which was intended to reference to the "Southern Land and Development Company." It was renamed Palm Harbor in the 1920s but is unincorporated. Palm Harbor was a headquarters for the KKK during the latter half of the 20th century, but locals and the city government condemned the organization's behavior after a violent dispute between an organizer and the local government and activity has waned.
The town's population was above 60,000 in 2016.
