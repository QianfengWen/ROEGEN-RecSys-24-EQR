You need wheels, a bike would do but it's very hilly
N51 passes close to Brú na Bóinne and the Boyne battlefield, but there's no public access from the north side. You need to be south of the river on the lane towards Donore. If there's a lumbering tour coach blocking the lane, you're on the right track.
