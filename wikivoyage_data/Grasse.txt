Grasse
Grasse is a commune in Provence, France. It is known worldwide for its traditional perfume industry.


Understand[edit]
Grasse sits on a hill, halfway from the coast of the French Riviera (Cannes and Antibes) and the Alps.  The surrounding villages are generally charming and not as crowded as their more famous neighbours on the coast.

Get in[edit]
The 4 lane N2285 'penetrante' from the A8 exit 42 (Grasse/Cannes) is the recommended access route. It terminates rather abruptly just before the steep ascent into Grasse on the old N85 (route Napoleon). Fortunately you do not need to go much further to get to the couple of perfumeries which is probably the main reason to visit.
It is also quite possible to take the meandering inland roads from Vence via the Loup Valley and/or Fayence.
You can also get by train from Nice or Cannes to 43.6536116.9261111 Gare de Grasse (Gasse train station).
From Nice there are frequent buses run every 30 to 40 minutes to Grasse. The journey takes approximately 1.5 hour and costs €1.50. Tickets are for sale on the bus.
From Cannes there are buses to Grasse as well, but less frequent.

The Grasse area is good for outdoor activities, as well as hiking in the hills it is possible to ride horses, go mountain biking and play golf and tennis.
There are golf courses such as the Golf Country Club de Saint Donat (270 rte Cannes Grasse ☏ +33 4 93 09 76 60), or the Golf du Grande Bastide (761 chem Picholines Châteauneuf ☏ +33 4 93 77 70 08, fax: +33 4 93 77 72 36).
Although most towns have a municipal tennis club these tend to be rather cliquey and not very welcoming to foreigners.
