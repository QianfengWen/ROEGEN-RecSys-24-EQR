Port Douglas is a coastal resort town north of Cairns, near the Daintree Rainforest in the Far North of Queensland.


Understand[edit]
Port Douglas is a small town (year-round population around 3500 people in 2016). It is a very popular tourist, beach and reef destination, with the peak season being during dry season from May through September. It largely, although not exclusively, caters for family holidaymakers and offers higher-end resort stays to couples and families. There are some backpacker hostels but far fewer than in Cairns. Port Douglas maintains a village feel: the palm trees are taller than the buildings and you can meander through the town to do some shopping, or enjoy a wide variety of cafes, pubs, restaurants and bars, ranging from those offering excellent value to world-class cuisine.
Port Douglas is an ideal base for visits to the Great Barrier Reef or to the Daintree Rainforest, with Cape Tribulation a 90-minute drive on well-maintained, sealed roads.

Get in[edit]
Port Douglas's nearest airport is in Cairns, which is served by both domestic and international flights. Port Douglas is a one hour drive north of Cairns on the Captain Cook Highway, a well-maintained sealed road, albeit windy. Bus transfers are available: Sun Palm run a shuttle from Cairns airport and downtown ($35/$15) a good option is Exemplar Coaches and Limousines
Rental cars are also easily available at Cairns.

Get around[edit]
There are 2 bus systems that will take you into town for $5 round trip. The return ticket is only good with the bus company you went in to town with. On Sundays there is a small sightseeing train that runs into and out of town. Tours to the reef or rain forest pick you up at your hotel.
Buses go past 4 times per hour from 7AM til around midnight.
The main downtown area (along Macrossan St) is easily walkable if you choose a hotel or hostel in that area.

See[edit]
It is the place where the reef meets the rainforest, a tropical wonderland of diversity.
Port Douglas provides access to the Great Barrier Reef and also the Daintree Rainforest.
Another great day trip is also the nearby Atherton Tablelands.

 The Rainforest Habitat Wildlife Sanctuary, Port  Douglas Rd, ☏ +617 4099 3235. Provides visitors with a chance to observe a huge range of flora and fauna, up close and personal. Visitors wander through three unique environments: The Rainforest, where boardwalks meander along the forest floor to the canopy allowing views of native species such as the Cassowary; The Wetlands, where wading birds can be seen foraging for fish in waterways, and The Grasslands, an open-air exhibit where you can hand-feed kangaroos and observe emus and crocodiles. Informative, free guided tours and presentations take place throughout the day. Famous for its Breakfast with the Birds and Lunch with the Lorikeets.

Stay safe[edit]
The Port Douglas area is home to salt water crocodiles, which are sometimes capable of killing adult humans. Four Mile Beach has warning signs advising people to not walk in or near the water's edge, especially at dusk, or allow children or dogs to do so. The risk is lower than it is in rivers however, and the beach will usually be closed outright if a crocodile has been recently sighted.
Stinger season is from November to May inclusive. There is a netted area at the north end of Four Mile Beach that offers some protection from stings: this area is also patrolled by lifeguards. Signs will display the day's stinger risk, or chat to the lifeguards.
