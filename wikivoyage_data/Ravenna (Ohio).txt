Portage County Courthouse
41.15756-81.243371 Portage County Courthouse. The flagple in front is an iconic 150 foot tall structure built in 1893. The steel criss-cross design looks more like a radio tower or oil derrick than a modern flagpole. It is seen as a symbol of the city of Ravenna, and efforts in the early 2010s to have the Flagpole torn down and replaced were met with huge opposition by residents. (updated Aug 2019)

In late afternoon the official part of the festival packs up and moves east of town to Sunbeau Farm. The downtown part of the festival is free, but the Sunbeau part of the festival requires a $5 admission fee. At Sunbeau, you can watch hot air balloons take off and a fireworks display at dusk. At night, generally, Sunbeau is the 'family friendly' part of the festival, with many people instead staying downtown after a day of filling up on greasy fair food to have drinks at the downtown bars, which are always packed on this day.
