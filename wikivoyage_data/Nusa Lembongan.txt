Nusa Lembongan is a small island off the southeast coast of the main island of Bali. Fast becoming one of Bali's most popular attractions, this island is a world away from the hassle and hectic pace of South Bali. Neither hawkers nor traffic mar the magnificent scenery; this is a fine place to just put your feet up and relax. Main activities include surfing, diving and snorkeling. The water is some of the clearest you will find anywhere, and a vivid aqua blue in colour.


Understand[edit]
Touches of Robinson Crusoe at Dream Beach
Nusa Lembongan is approximately 8 km² in size, and is one of three neighbouring islands, the others being much larger Nusa Penida and tiny Nusa Ceningan (also covered by this article). The three islands are separated from Bali by the Badung Strait. Some visitors may find Nusa Lembongan a little slow after the pace of South Bali.
Many areas around the island are good for diving and snorkeling, with abundant marine life and healthy coral. Surfing can get a bit crowded, but the waves are good. There are several white sand beaches away from the main centres which are virtually never crowded.  There is a flourishing and well established seaweed farming industry here, and many visitors find it interesting to learn about this.

Orientation[edit]
Two main beach areas have traditionally attracted visitors.
Jungut Batu in the northwest is the bigger of the two, and has myriad hotels and cheap eateries. This is the area which traditionally attracted backpackers and surfers to the island. The white sand beach here is pleasant enough but nothing to get too excited about, and it is a little narrow in places. The hillside to the south of Jungut Batu known as the Bukit (the hill) has been developed and has attracted some higher level hotels and private villas. The views from the Bukit are perhaps second to none on Nusa Lembongan. Sunsets are best viewed along the main Jungut Batu beachfront.
Mushroom Bay to the southwest of Jungut Batu is a quaint, attractive and sheltered bay. It is an especially nice spot after 15:00 when the day trippers have returned to Bali, and it has a great white sandy beach, along with some cozy little water-side restaurants.
Further south, the lesser known beaches either side of the Devil's Tear outcrop, known as Dream Beach and Sunset Beach (or Sandy Bay), are increasingly drawing more visitors. The coastal landscape in this part of the island is mostly low-lying limestone cliffs, and there are some dramatic cave formations.
The north end of the island is fringed by an important mangrove forest, and the eastern side of the island is separated from neighbouring Nusa Ceningan by a shallow estuarine channel.
The main population centre of the island is Lembongan Village in the southern interior, and it is here that you will find the homes of many traditional island families.

Climate[edit]
The climate of Nusa Lembongan is similar to neighbouring 'mainland' Bali, but it is noticeably drier  here, particularly in the period of May to September. If there is a time to avoid, it would be the height of the rainy season in January and February.

Culture[edit]
The local Lembonganese are Hindu and visitors will notice little or no difference from the prevailing culture on the Bali mainland.

Talk[edit]
Balinese is the most common language of communication between local residents, with Bahasa Indonesia a distant second. The Balinese spoken here is a distinct dialect, and sharp-eared linguists would certainly notice this. English is widely understood and spoken, often with an Australian accent!

Get in[edit]
The only realistic way (although you can charter a helicopter) to reach Nusa Lembongan from Bali is by boat. There are several options according to budget and speed. Most of the scheduled fast boat services leave from Sanur. Other services run from Serangan and Benoa Harboursin south Bali, and there are a couple of services to and from Padang Bai in East Bali. 
As of 2021, there are over 20 different fast boat operators going to Lembongan, making it hard to chose one that is reliable, safe and value for money. Standards vary widely, so some caution is advised. If you want to compare services ahead of time, a simple online search for "Bali to Lembongan" should get you pointed in the right direction.
If leaving from Bali, you can simply go directly to a fast boat office of your choice (usually near the departure point) to book. The best places to check live seat availability and get immediate confirmed e-tickets online are 12go.asia (which seems to have the cheapest prices at May 2024, even better than walk-in), Gilibookings.com or the cheaper Gilitickets.com. Sanur port websites direct to 12go to buy tickets. Otherwise you can go direct to one of the fast boat company websites to make reservation inquiries which in some cases takes 24 hr to get confirmation. There are also plenty of local agents selling tickets that you can purchase when there, or you may be able to book with staff from your hotel. If you are coming from Lombok or the Gili islands it may be easier to pre-book online as options are more limited and local fast boat offices less prevalent (excepting perhaps Gili Trawangan).
The majority of fast boat services to Lembongan do involve getting your feet wet at boarding and disembarkation, usually up to knees or a bit higher. Also, nearly all offer complementary pick up and drop off services to/from the most popular areas of Bali.

Arrival[edit]
There are three main arrival locations on Nusa Lembongan: 

Jungut Batu beach in the north of the island
Mushroom Bay to the west
The base of the Yellow footbridge between Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Ceningan, in the south of the island.
The latter 2 options are mainly used by larger fast boat and fast ferry (charter) services that dock at dedicated floating pontoons near to the coast, using smaller craft to transfer people ashore.

From South Bali[edit]
By far the most fast boat services to Lembongan depart from the newly constructed (2023) Sanur Port on Jalan Matahari Terbit, while some may still depart from nearby Sanur beach, which can be found at the end of Jalan Hangtuah. The exact departure and arrival point on this beach depends on the tide, however some operators have a waiting area on the boulevard or beach for checked-in passengers. Nearly all the Sanur services sail to Jungut Batu on Lembongan. Sanur - Lembongan ranges Rp 115,000-300,000 online, walk-in Rp 150,000-300,000 one-way, Rp 400,000-600,000 with return. About 30min boat ride.
Serangan Harbour hosts some of the best established fast boat companies in the region, some of which service Lembongan from time to time. The advantage of Serangan is that boarding takes place from dedicated jetties, rather than the beach. There is also a larger fast boat that sails from Serangan to the floating pontoon at the back of Lembongan island, avoiding wet feet on both ends of the journey.
Benoa Harbour has a couple of very large fast ferry operations to Nusa Lembongan, but cater mostly to mass group bookings from Asian tour operators and are thus often chartered out and not always available for individual ticket sales.
Crossings from south Bali to Lembongan generally take between 35 and 45 min, depending on the sea conditions and arrival point.

From East Bali[edit]
Padang Bai has a fast boat jetty most often used for services to Lombok and the Gili islands, however as of 2019 there was also a daily trip to and from Nusa Lembongan, taking about 45-min. 

From Nusa Penida[edit]
Neighbouring Nusa Penida is much less visited, but slowly growing in popularity. It's relatively straightforward to get between the islands with local speedboat charters. It's just a short hop over, typically taking only 10 min.

From the Gili Islands and Lombok[edit]
Several fast boat services offer connections between Lombok, the Gilis and Lembongan. These are usually en-route to or from Bali so make for an excellent island hopping route. Many travellers chose to spend a few days on Nusa Lembongan before or after their time on the Gili islands and/or Lombok. Travel time varies per route, as some boats sail via Padang Bai Bali or Sengiggi, Lombok. On average, the journey time is between 2 and 3 hr.

Get around[edit]
8°40′44″S 115°27′7″EMap of Nusa Lembongan
The cliffs of southwest Nusa Lembongan make for excellent walking
By foot[edit]
Nusa Lembongan is a nice place to walk, with coastal paths linking nearly all the guest houses, hotels and restaurants. Most walks will take less than two hours. The less developed southwestern area of the island has some spectacular coast paths which provide easy walking, great views back to Bali, and spectacular sunsets. You can cross by foot to the small neighbouring island of Nusa Ceningan via a scenic suspension bridge.
From the end of the beach at Jungut Batu it is a 35-min walk along the coast to Mushroom Bay.

By bicycle[edit]
Bicycles can be rented at some hotels and guest-houses. Some of the roads are quite well surfaced, but be prepared for degraded surfaces in places and there are some steep hills. This is a great way to see the island at your own pace. Expect to pay about Rp 20,000-40,000 per day.

By motorbike[edit]
Motorbikes are also widely available for rent, but may be unnecessary given the short distances involved — the island is only about 4 km end-to-end. Expect to pay Rp 50,000-100,000 per day, depending on how busy it is. Local boys are more than happy to transport you on the back of their motorbike for a fee.

By truck[edit]
There are virtually no cars on Nusa Lembongan, and any business or local resident wishing to bring one to the island needs special permission from the village elders. This will only be granted in exceptional circumstances. Local 4-wheeled transport is available though in the form of basic pick-up trucks which most hotels and restaurants use. These are useful for transport to and from the boat transfer point when you are likely to have heavy bags, but are otherwise not really necessary.

By boat[edit]
Local boatmen are willing to take you by boat from Jungut Batu to Mushroom Bay. One way should cost about Rp 30,000. A return trip can be negotiated down to Rp 50,000.

See[edit]
Crashing waves at Devil's Tear
The attractions here are mostly natural. The beaches and other coastal landscapes are obviously a key draw, as are the sunsets. There are a limited number of man-made attractions, most notably temples and the rickety suspension bridge.

Beaches[edit]
-8.6909115.43321 Dream Beach. A wonderful secluded small beach with powdery, white sand, located on the south coast. From the main accommodation areas on the west coast, head southeast towards Lembongan Village where you should turn west, and then look for the signposted small track leading south to Dream Beach. There is a cafe attached to the single resort here, and this makes Dream Beach a great place to spend the whole day doing nothing. Be very careful though about entering the water here as the rips can be fierce. Only the strongest swimmers should consider this and even then, avoid the eastern end of the beach. Free. (updated Jun 2024)
-8.6889115.42982 Sandy Bay (Sunset Beach) (Small entrance by north, right of sandy beach club and looking like a scooters parking. Next to devil's tear but no path between via south.). A small but spectacular beach with white sand and crashing waves, located just to the north of Dream Beach, and easiest reached via the same route. The excellent Beach Club at Sandy Bay is located here and this should encourage visitors to spend the day. At low tide a dramatic cave is exposed in the low limestone cliff at the eastern side of the bay. Approach carefully and make sure you are not cut off from the beach by a rising tide. All-in-all, this is a delightful spot which is as laid back as anywhere in the whole of Bali. Free. (updated Jun 2024)
-8.6814115.43823 Tamarind Beach (between Playgrounds surf break and Mushroom Bay). Good views back to Bali, and of Mount Agung especially. 
Other[edit]
Nusa Lembongan is famous for spectacular sunsets
-8.6664115.44914 Marine Megafauna Foundation (MMF) (at Secret Garden Bungalows in Jungutbatu). A marine research centre set up to monitor the manta ray and mola mola populations around Nusa Penida. MMF works with the Lembongan dive shops to gather information about these magnificent creatures and their critical habitats that will eventually be used to help protect them. MMF lectures are given on Tu and Th at 18:30 the Yoga Shack. You will get an in depth look at the exciting marine life around the islands. (updated Jun 2017)
-8.6908115.42935 Devil's Tear (found by walking either a few min north from Dream Beach or south from Sunset Beach). A rocky outcrop on the south western coast. Spectacular crashing waves and water plumes. Ticket is valid for multiple days for one stay in lembongan. Rp 25,000. (updated Jun 2024)
-8.6682115.45666 Mangrove Forest (continue north on the only west coast road from Jungut Batu until you reach the mangroves). Northern Nusa Lembongan has an extensive forest of mature mangroves which can be explored in a jukung outrigger boat. Also great for families at high tide as perfect lagoon for kids swimming. 
-8.6823115.43357 Puncak Sari Temple, Lembongan Village (just north of Lembongan Village on the main route back to Jungut Batu). The largest and grandest Hindu temple on the island. Good views over the straits back to Bali from this area. 
-8.6946115.44138 Seaweed Farms (make your way to the shoreline anywhere in the southeast quarter of the island and just observe). Seaweed farming takes place in many parts of the island, but the most accessible farms are on the southern side of Lembongan Village. Most of the seaweed grown here is destined for the Asian cosmetics industry. 
-8.6808115.44699 Sunsets. One thing not to miss on Nusa Lembongan. The Sunset over Bali is awe-inspiring, and can be viewed from any west facing part of the island, but the beach at Jungut Batu is especially popular. A more rural alternative is to go over the bridge to Nusa Ceningan and view the sunset from one of the west-facing high ridges. Being just a few degrees south of the equator, sunset times do not vary much throughout the year here. Look to be in place between 17:30 and 18:00. 
-8.6942115.45110 Yellow Bridge (go through Lembongan Village heading west, sticking on the main road until you hit the estuarine channel). This quirky yellow suspension bridge should not be missed by any visitor. You can walk or bike across the bridge to neighbouring Nusa Ceningan. The noise it makes can be quite scary, and contributes to what is an all-round Indiana Jones-type experience. Although it is definitely getting more and more rickety as the years pass, the bridge is still safe, and there are many thousands of incident-free crossings every year. There are very rare occasions when the bridge is off-bounds to motorbikes due to maintenance. At such times boats, offer transport across the channel for you and your bike. Free. 
A road in Jungut Batu
-8.7115.4511 Nusa Ceningan. A tiny island between Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Penida, which is easily reached via the suspension bridge on foot or by bicycle/motorbike. The original bridge collapsed in October of 2016. The new bridge called the "love bridge" was opened in February 2017. There is a notable surf break off Nusa Ceningan which attracts some surfers away from the more crowded breaks on Nusa Lembongan. Otherwise the island offers some scenic roads and paths, and the westward views back over Nusa Lembongan to Bali are impressive. Viewing the sunset over Bali from the central Ceningan ridge is very much worth the effort. The estuarine channel between Lembongan and Ceningan is home to many seaweed farms. Very few visitors choose to stay on Nusa Ceningan, but there is a small bungalow complex.   
-8.70734115.4385712 Blue Lagoon Nusa Ceningan, Jl. Nusa Ceningan, Lembongan, Kec. Klungkung, Kabupaten Klungkung, Bali 80871 (1h10-1h30 walk from around lembongan villafe. other side yellow bridge). Front entrance through Klyf club/hotel, open to public, no entrance fee, drones forbidden. Right side entrance via small dirt path after klyf club and secret point huts, but before their parking. small sign "Blue Lagoon Ceningan". Left side with hotel in construction. Similar to devil's tear but less tourist and free. Be careful on dirt/rocky path and don't go to near the edge (no barriers). Free. (updated Jun 2024)

(updated Jun 2024)
Surfing[edit]
Nusa Lembongan was first opened up as a tourist destination by surfers, and it has long been an established part of the Bali surf circuit.
There are three main breaks, all off the top half of the west coast, with another less well known just to the southwest off Nusa Ceningan. Playgrounds, Lacerations and Shipwrecks are all close offshore and reached via an energetic paddle from the beach, or in a more leisurely fashion, by a local boat (perahu) which can be chartered from the nearest beach.
Whilst the breaks usually suit intermediate to experienced surfers given they all break over coral reefs, the aptly named Playgrounds is a little more forgiving and can be enjoyed by beginners and experts alike. All the surf breaks become extremely crowded during the dry season
Although surfable all year round, waves are best when winds are in the southeast quarter, normally from April to September/October.
There is a thriving surf scene in Jungut Batu. When compared to its tiny population, Nusa Lembongan has produced a remarkable number of international competition-quality surfers. Any keen surfer will certainly not be short of company here.

Scuba diving[edit]
Oceanic sunfish in the waters off Nusa Lembongan
Diving is of excellent quality in the crystal clear waters around the island. A number of reputable dive shops are present, and this is a notable teaching destination. Many hundreds of visitors have learned to dive here.
For more experienced divers, the most interesting sites are off neighbouring Nusa Penida. There are some challenging drift dives here, and dive operators will visit certain sites only when the sea conditions are safe. There are plenty of options for easier flat reef and wall dives as well. Marine highlights include large manta rays all year round, spectacular, massive oceanic sunfish (mola-mola) in season (July–October), white-tipped reef sharks, nurse sharks and the odd hammerhead. Whale sharks are far from regular, but the odd migrant is seen. Last but certainly not least, four species of sea turtle can be found here. All operators offer scheduled trips to the prime dive sites around all three islands.
Prices vary little from shop to shop. Course fees run from about US$60 for a half-day Discover Scuba introduction, to US$395 for PADI Open Water certification. A fun dive will cost approximately US$35-45 including all equipment, with discounts offered for multiple dives. Dive shops have variable opening hours according to seasonal demand. Night dives are widely offered and offer a fantastic underwater experience.

Snorkelling[edit]
Healthy reef-life in clear waters off Nusa Lembongan
Non-divers should not feel left out, as good snorkelling is available close inshore at various spots around the island. Perhaps the two best areas are Mushroom Bay on the west coast, and the mangroves on the northern tip. Equipment can be hired from your hotel or on the beach, and depending on the quality of the gear, you should expect to pay Rp 20,000-50,000 for renting a mask, snorkel and set of fins.
If you fancy getting further offshore, dive shops may sell you a snorkeling space on a scheduled dive boat, subject to availability.
Also, local boatmen are willing to take you by boat to various snorkeling spots. Depending on the number of snorkeling spots you want to visit, a boat trip can be arranged for about Rp 200,000-300,000 (including snorkeling gear). An enjoyable snorkelling spot reached by boat only is the west coast of neighbouring Nusa Penida, with Crystal Bay being especially rewarding. There is a strong current along this coast. The boatman will drop you off at the beginning of the current, and you can drift while snorkeling along the drop off wall with beautiful coral and loads of fish. The boatmen will follow you and pick you up at the end of the drift.
Typical snorkeling trip Rp 300,000-600,000 with 3 spots, possible stop in Nusa penida toyapakeh to fetch more people. Spots toyapakeh, manta bay or manta point, mangrave point or turtle point near lembongan beach. Travel to manta point is about 45min in fast boat one-way and can be bumpy depending on sea conditions and get sea sick for some. About 30 min per spot but possibly only 15min on Manta point as more crowded and sea conditions. Private boat Rp 1,200,000-3,000,000. Some operators may offer additional activities like kayaking.

Other water sports[edit]

Those who care a little about the environment may be keener to patronise the sea kayaking option. Your hotel will be able to assist with booking any of these activities. Alternatively, just head down to the beach at either Mushroom Bay or Jungut Batu, and figure it out for yourself. Costs start at about Rp 150,000 for a single banana boat ride.

Walking[edit]
This is an excellent island for walking and keen visitors should not hesitate to just head off and explore the myriad tracks that criss-cross the island.

Walking itinerary[edit]
The low cliffs in the south offer some splendid coastal walking routes. Perhaps the best of them starts at Dream Beach, from where you should take the obvious footpath north over the Devil's Tear outcrop, pausing to see some of the most dramatic wave formations anywhere around the island. The crashing plumes are sometimes huge here, so be prepared to get wet! Continue northwards to Sunset Beach and explore the cove. If you time your arrival for low tide, the cave at the eastern end of the beach may be accessible.
At the opposite end of the beach you will find the Beach Club. From here follow the footpath leading northwest up the hill always keeping the private villas to your left, until you again hit the cliff line. From here you will see right across the Badung Strait to Bali. Follow the cliff path northwards and then around to the east, all the time pausing to appreciate the dramatic coastal formations. Birdwatchers should lookout for flashes of turquoise and white, as spectacular sacred kingfishers are common in this area, and offshore it is worth keeping an eye out for huge frigatebirds.

Buy[edit]
Some hotels and scuba shops will accept credit cards, although many of them charge a fee of 3-5% for charges to a credit card.
There are multiple ATMs on the island nowadays, so it shouldn't be an issue to most travelers, although it is still advised to bring rupiah with you so you don't have to look everywhere for an ATM with money in it. There are also cash-withdrawal services, both on the main streets and in some hotels, but they charge a fee of around 8% to 10%.
Small shops are widespread, and they are geared towards basic visitor requirements, stocking sun-block, cheap knock-off boardshorts and hats, as well as the usual range of snacks, beer, soft drinks and cigarettes. Do not though expect anything too sophisticated. There is little in the way of souvenir type shopping on the island, and there is nothing of this nature which would not be better purchased on the Bali mainland.

Eat[edit]
Virtually any place you stay on Nusa Lembongan will have a cafe or restaurant attached to it, and the majority of these encourage non-staying guests to eat with them. These can be of hugely variable quality and any casual visitor could be forgiven for thinking the food on this island is terrible! Some of the better budget options can be found at Linda's Bungalows, Mainski, and Dream Beach Huts.
There are a few good local warungs to choose from, but by-and-large there have not been many decent independent restaurants on Nusa Lembongan. That is now changing at a pace though and the more notable exceptions to the old rule are listed below. Fish is naturally a great option.

Sleep[edit]


This guide uses the following price ranges for a standard double room:


Budget
Under Rp 300,000


Mid-range
Rp 300,000-1,000,000


Splurge
Over Rp 1,000,000

There is a broad range of accommodation, with options to suit almost any budget. Most budget accommodations can be found at Jungut Batu, while more up market accommodation is further south, around Mushroom Bay, the Bukit and Dream Beach. Traditionally, budget guest houses aimed at young surfers and back-packers dominated, but that changed as more and more well-heeled visitors discovered the island. Some of the older budget options are very tired indeed, and visitors should bear that in mind when assessing where to stay.
Check-in and check-out times are something of a movable feast at most hotels. It is safe to assume a time of about 13:00 for check-in and about 11:00 for checkout, unless specifically stated otherwise.
There are no formal campsites on the island but travellers do sometimes pitch tents. A small donation to the local community is recommended.

Stay safe[edit]
This is a safe island and reports of crime, major or minor, are rare. Most common is the theft of items left in unlocked rooms, so as you would anywhere in the world, just be sensible.
Drugs are not especially widespread here, but you may be offered marijuana or mushrooms, and more rarely, harder drugs. Be aware that the former is highly illegal in Indonesia and penalties are harsh. The Indonesian legal position on mushrooms is unclear but to be totally safe, visitors should steer clear.
The biggest dangers to visitors are related to the sea. Swimming is not be taken lightly in any waters around Bali, and Nusa Lembongan is no exception. Mushroom Bay and the area around the mangroves in the north are largely safe for swimming, but still take care. Swimming at Dream Beach and Sunset Beach (in particular) should be avoided by all but the very strongest of swimmers, and even then with great caution. Surfing at all four breaks is challenging for beginners.

Stay healthy[edit]
There is a small medical clinic in Jungut Batu with an attendant doctor. This is a perfectly good facility for treating minor ailments, but visitors with anything approaching a serious problem should get back to Bali as quickly as possible. Opening hours are erratic and unpredictable. Ask at your hotel.
Like all of Bali, Nusa Lembongan is officially a malaria-free zone. Dengue fever is a potential problem. Unlike in mainland Bali, there are no recent cases of rabies.

Connect[edit]
Telephone[edit]
It is possible to make phone calls from Nusa Lembongan. Although a little pricey, public telephone offices (wartels) can be found at the Scoot boat office and at Bungalow No7.

International phone operators: 101.
International Direct Dialing prefix: 001, 007, or 008.
The area code for Nusa Lembongan is officially 0366, although 0361 is also widely used.
Landlines are not that common, and even many well-established businesses operate with mobile telephones only. All of the major Indonesian mobile networks have coverage of the island.
For directory inquiries, dial 108 from a landline or 0361-108 from a mobile phone.
Nusa Lembongan receives good 3G coverage by all the major Indonesian networks.

Internet[edit]
Most places to stay and some restaurants now have wireless internet capability for guests but it's often very slow.
There are a couple of basic, well signed public internet cafes at the southern end of the main coast road in Jungut Batu. Look for the signs and expect to pay about Rp 30,000 per hour.  Service is sometimes very slow. Most of the internet cafes also have a download limit in addition to charging for time, so save your media streaming activities for Bali.
The national phone company, Telkomsel, provides a decent 3G connection, however it may default to GPRS.

Go next[edit]
The vast majority of visitors leave the way they came in, i.e. back to Sanur and then on to elsewhere in Bali.
For the adventurous, a side trip to Nusa Penida island will get you well off the beaten path.
There is a daily direct boat service to mainland Lombok and Gili Trawangan.
