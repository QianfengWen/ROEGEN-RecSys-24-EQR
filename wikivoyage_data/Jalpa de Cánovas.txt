Templo Misericordia in Jalpa de Cánovas
Jalpa de Cánovas is a small town in the Bajio region of central Mexico. It's one of the smallest towns to be recognized as a Pueblo Magico, though it does indeed offer considerable attractions for the historical and cultural traveler. It is a scenic colonial town that's a great place for peaceful weekend getaways.


Understand[edit]
The town was founded by Juan Villaseñor in 1542 when he was granted a block of land consisting of 7,365 hectares. Villaseñor used his land grant to start a hacienda that he ran as a cattle and horse ranch. In 1900, President Porfirio Diaz attended his goddaughter's wedding at the hacienda, gifting her with the honor of having the first hacienda with electricity (along with 30 years free of light bills). 
Jalpa de Canovas has a number of fruit and nut orchards rasing quince, walnuts, and grapes.
The town itself is really little more than a village of 670 residents (2020).
