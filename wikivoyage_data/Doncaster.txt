Doncaster is an industrial city in South Yorkshire in the north of England, with a population of about 110,000 in 2019. It's a metropolitan borough which also includes the towns of Bawtry, Mexborough, Conisbrough, Hatfield and Stainforth. 


Understand[edit]
Lakeside
"Donny" to the Romans was Danum. Their main highway Ermine Street ran from London through Lincoln to the Humber then to York, but ferrying across the Humber was sometimes impractical. So they created an alternative route through Danum that in modern times became the Great North Road then A1. Doncaster grew with trade but remained a small market town until the 19th century, when it industrialised through coal-mining. The South Yorkshire coalfield tilts, outcropping west towards the Pennines, having the best seams at Barnsley, and becoming unprofitable and deep to the east. So Doncaster didn't have mines but served the industry, especially through transport, with canals then railways. The railways began as a leash of company tracks between mines and wharves, then long distance routes were forged. Three sections linked in 1850 to create the East Coast Mainline from London Kings Cross to Edinburgh:  Doncaster is about midway and became a railway engineering centre.
Much of the industry has gone, with the better coal seams worked out, engineering jobs lost abroad, and limited investment in the railways. Doncaster transitioned to service and light industry. This area, historically part of West Riding of Yorkshire, in 1974 joined the new entity of South Yorkshire, along with Sheffield, Barnsley and Rotherham.
Visit Doncaster is the Travel Information Centre, in the Mansion House at the corner of High Street and Priory Place. It's open M-Sa 10AM-3:30PM.
