Cobh is a port in Cork Harbour, County Cork, in southwest Ireland. It's pronounced "cove" and that's what it means, a sheltered harbour. It's part of the commuter belt for Cork city and in 2022 had a population of 14,000. Cobh retains a small town atmosphere, with colourful terraces rising up the hill to the cathedral, and visiting cruise ships towering over the waterfront.


Understand[edit]
Until the 18th century, shipping to this region used small ports such as Youghal, Kinsale and Cork city. Ships grew bigger as Britain created a maritime empire, and bigger still as metal and steam replaced sailing vessels. Cork Harbour is a "ria", a drowned river valley and sheltered cove of 7–26 m depth, so large warships, freighters and liners can use it. In the 19th century "The Cove" became fortified as a navy base and was renamed Queenstown after Queen Victoria visited in 1849. It was one of Ireland's main ports of emigration, with some 1.5 million embarking here on their way to North America. That was one source of revenue that led the White Star Line to schedule Titanic to call here westbound in 1912. They didn't see any point in it calling on the eastbound return; and sure enough, it didn't. 
As Ireland struggled towards independence the royal name rankled, and the town became An Cóbh, which is the gaelicised version of "cove". But the British didn't leave – they retained three "Treaty Ports" as Royal Navy bases, here at Cobh / Queenstown, at Castletownbere on the southwest tip of Ireland, and at Lough Swilly in County Donegal. The Cobh port was not a land territory like Gibraltar or Hong Kong, but a collection of military installations dotted around the harbour, including at Crosshaven. In 1938 all three were handed over to Ireland and fell derelict. Ireland's own navy base was, and still is, on Haulbowline Island, which was not part of the Treaty Port. Cork Harbour remains busy with all kinds of shipping. 
The Tourist Office is in Market House on Casement Square, just above the Lusitania memorial. It's open M-F 09:00-17:00. Visit Cobh is the tourist information website.

By rail[edit]
Irish Rail commuter trains run every 30–60 min from Cork Kent station to Little Island, Glounthaune, Fota (for Wildlife Park), Carrigaloe, Rushbrooke and Cobh, taking 25 min, single fare €5.
Change in Cork for trains from Dublin Heuston, Limerick, Waterford and Mallow (for Cork Racecourse).
Change at Glounthaune for Carrigtwohill (for Barryscourt Castle) and Midleton (for Jameson Whiskey Distillery). 
51.8487-8.30091 Cobh railway station is on the sea front by the cruise ship terminal. It's a simple platform terminus, rather hidden away on Westbourne Place, with ramp access to the sole platform. The former station building is now a museum of the emigrant experience, see below.

By road[edit]
Cobh is on an island, so by road there are only two access routes:

From N25 East Cork Parkway take junction 3 onto R624 south. This crosses Fota Island then reaches Belvelly to follow the coast into Cobh.
51.861-8.3262 Passage West Ferry is reached by R610 east of Cork, and crosses to Carrigaloe 1 km north of Cobh. The ferry runs daily 6:30AM–9:30PM and takes 5 min, cars €6 single, €8 return.
There's no bridge across the island's eastern channel; the "East Ferry" sailed from medieval times, latterly cable-hauled, but ceased in 1913.
Cork Connect Bus 200 runs every 30-60 min daily from Cork St Patrick's Quay, taking 35 min to Cobh.

By boat[edit]
See Cork#Get in for the ferries from Roscoff and Santander. They dock at Ringaskiddy, west across the channel.
Cruise liners often visit: they may dock here or at Ringaskiddy, or land passengers by tender for excursions. They're mostly on round-trip itineraries, but check the upcoming cruise schedule in case a point-to-point journey is possible. For instance transatlantic one-way cruises from New York to Southampton might set down passengers here.

See[edit]
Titanic Memorial is on Pearse Square. This grand "unsinkable" liner was launched in Belfast in 1911 and began her maiden voyage for the White Star Line on 10 April 1912. The timetable was for RMS Titanic and her sister ships to sail from Southampton, cross the Channel to Cherbourg then overnight to Cobh, then onward to New York. Eastbound there was to be no stop at Cobh; the owners were eyeing the emigrant trade. She was too big to dock in Cherbourg or Cobh so passengers transferred by tender. 123 joined at Cobh, seven passengers left, and a stoker deserted. Two hours later Titanic was back under way into the Atlantic. Near Newfoundland she was gashed by an iceberg and sank in the early hours of 15 April, with the loss of over 1500 lives.
Lusitania memorial is on Casement Square. RMS Lusitania was a large Cunard liner plying between New York and Liverpool. On 7 May 1915 she was 12 miles off Kinsale Head, near the end of her eastbound crossing, when she was torpedoed by German submarine U-20. The single torpedo blast triggered a big secondary explosion and the ship sank within 18 minutes. The speed and list of the sinking prevented launching of most lifeboats, and 1195 people perished of the 1959 aboard. Survivors were landed at Cobh, as were many bodies. There was international anger at the attack: 128 US citizens were aboard, with the millionaire Alfred Vanderbilt being among those lost, but the USA stayed out of the war for another two years. Germany maintained that Lusitania was an enemy British ship within a designated war zone, and was carrying munitions. The shipwreck lies 93 m deep, so it's diveable but a hazardous technical exercise, not least because there are indeed munitions, now in an unstable condition.
51.851434-8.2934981 St Colman's Cathedral, 5 Cathedral Place. Daily 8AM-6PM. Towering neo-Gothic RC cathedral; the steeple is 91.4 m tall. Construction began in 1868, whereupon the bishop decided that it should be altogether grander than what had been planned by Pugin. The disruption and cost overrun meant the place wasn't completed until 1919. There's a remarkable 47-bell carillon, with the largest bell a humonguous 3.44 metric tonnes. Donation.   (updated Nov 2020)
 Cobh Heritage Centre (The Queenstown Story) (next to railway station), ☏ +353 21 4813591. Tu–Su 10AM-5PM. Museum inside the former dockside building depicts the town's emigration and other history, including the Great Famine and Titanic. Adult €11, conc €9, child €6.   (updated Nov 2020)Clock Tower on the quay
 Cobh Museum, Scots Church, High Rd. Apr-Oct: M-Sa 10AM-1PM, 2-5PM; Su 2:30-5PM. In an old Presbyterian church opposite (but separately run from) the Heritage Centre, this small museum has various exhibits of town life and its maritime history. Adult €4. (updated Nov 2020)
51.863-8.2962 Old Church ruins. This was built in 1694 as a Protestant church over earlier structures. It was abandoned and fell into ruin from 1815 when St Mary's was completed on Roches Row, but the cemetery remained in use. It was often used for those dying at sea or passing through the port-of-call, so it has a cosmopolitan selection. Best known are the mass graves of Lusitania victims but there are many other interesting graves. The 17 members of the crew of Lapwing died in 1804/05 of dysentery. The famous boxer, singer and crooner Jack Doyle (1913-1978) lies here. (updated Nov 2020)
51.881-8.3023 Belvelly Castle is the 14th to 15th century turret that greets arrivals via the road bridge to Cobh. It fell derelict in the 19th century but in 2018 was restored as a private residence. During World War I, sailors on shore leave at Queenstown would be brought here by enterprising coachmen to see "Blarney Castle"; there was even a counterfeit stone to be kissed. But given the nature of Blarney, those coachmen had demonstrated a genuine example. Next to the turret, Cobh Bouncy Castles has no connection with either the ersatz or echt Blarney, but sure it's tempting....
51.86-8.2664 Cuskinny Marsh is a wetland nature reserve, accessible 24 hours.
51.889585-8.3112765 Fota Wildlife Park  and Arboretum is a few km north, see Cork.
51.833-8.2836 Spike Island (Ferry from Kennedy Pier). There may have been a monastery here, but the main feature is the great bastion used for defence and as a prison for convicts awaiting transportation and for republicans. It remained a British base as part of the Treaty Port of Queenstown until in 1938 it was handed back to Ireland. It's named Fort Mitchel, but perhaps not for much longer, as John Mitchel was a notorious advocate of slavery; see Newry, where he grew up. (updated Nov 2020)
51.84-8.37 Haulbowline is the island half a km northwest of Spike Island. Just admire it from afar: although it's joined to the west harbour shore by a causeway, it's an Irish navy base, ugly and off-limits.

Fail to notice what day it is for a couple of weeks, while otherwise being a meticulous travel-planner, if you're the hero of Around the World in 80 Days. If ever a traveller needed the assistance of Wikivoyage, it's the fictional Phineas Fogg, who makes a £20,000 bet that he can circumnavigate and return to London in that time. Homebound from New York and behind schedule he commandeers a vessel, rapidly burning all its coal to maintain top speed then burning its wooden fittings. The fuel runs out off Ireland so he lands at Queenstown, takes the night train up to Dublin then a steamer to Liverpool. He can just about make it, then he's arrested for a few hours. It's soon cleared up but Fogg arrives in London a day late. The author Jules Verne (himself a keen amateur sailor who knew the harbours of Europe) had thought up the final twist several years before he used it in this story. Fogg has gained a day by circling eastbound, it's still only Saturday 21 Dec 1872, and he wins his bet and more importantly true lerv. So we're asked to believe that he never noticed being a day adrift all the way across San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Ireland and Liverpool. The theme tune to the 1956 film version with David Niven, sung by Sinatra, doesn't namecheck Queenstown / Cobh but County Down, for the sake of a clunky rhyme with London Town. Still, if the alternatives were Malay godown or Puget Soun'....
