Get in[edit]
See Estonia#Get around for bus and train schedules.

By bus[edit]
Buses arrive at the small bus station (bussijaam) on the border of the old town. This bus station feels like a big bus stop because the terminal building is somewhat hidden on the opposite side of the street. The  nearby fast-food kiosk opens early in the morning and caters to morning travellers while the whole city is still sleeping.
Buses from Tallinn depart every hour and reach Pärnu in about two hours. You can also travel from Viljandi (1 hr) and Tartu (2½-3 hr), Kuressaare (3 hr), and Valga (2½ hr). There is one daily bus from Saint Petersburg in Russia with a stop in Narva (5 hr). Check the schedules at here.
Pärnu is a major stop in the middle of the Tallinn–Riga route. Buses run every 1-2 hours and connect you to the Latvian capital in 2½ hr. Pärnu can be an excellent stopover on your away between the Baltic capitals.

By train[edit]
58.39496524.5882181 Pärnu railway station (Pärnu kaubajaam).   
Pärnu's train connection to Tallinn was closed permanently in 2018. Rail travellers will have to change to buses in Rapla and Lelle.

By car[edit]
Tallinn highway crossing the Pärnu river just north of the city center
Pärnu has road connections from Tallinn (128 km), Haapsalu (108 km), Tartu (174 km), as well as to  Riga in Latvia (184 km). The major artery of the Baltic states, Via Baltica, passes near Pärnu.

By plane[edit]
58.41916724.4727782 Pärnu airport (EPU  IATA) (is 4 km north-west of the city). It has some regular flights from Helsinki and Stockholm, but you are more likely to use this airport for continuing your journey from Pärnu rather than for traveling to the city. Luftverkehr Friesland-Harle [dead link] operates flights to the islands of Ruhnu (regular) and Kihnu (on request only). The Ruhnu flight continues to Kuressaare and costs about €25 for each flight segment.   
Expect absolutely no service at the airport. You will have to call taxi or arrange some other private transportation to the city. City bus #23 runs to the airport twice a day, but its schedule is adjusted to the airport staff, not to sporadic travelers.

By boat[edit]
Pärnu has a large port, which is mostly used for cargo traffic. Ferries to the island of Kihnu depart from the Munalaid dock located 35 km west of Pärnu. However, a small passenger harbor exists at Kalda 2(right at the city center) and may serve occasional weekend ferries to Kihnu and Ruhnu.
If you are arriving by sail boat (keelyacht), you can dock at the Pärnu Yacht Club[dead link].
To stay with motorboat you can use Talvesadam on 58.3851824.4920593 Pärnu moat (Pärnu vallikraav).
