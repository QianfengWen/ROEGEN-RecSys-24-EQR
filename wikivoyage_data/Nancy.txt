The place Stanislas.
Nancy is a moderate-sized city in the Grand-Est region of (eastern) France. Nancy is the capital of the French département of Meurthe-et-Moselle, and is the economic capital of the Lorraine region. It is also a major French university centre, with over 47,000 students and three major universities. Once the industrial and cultural powerhouse of Northeast France, the city boasts a very diverse architectural and cultural heritage. Parts of the historical city centre are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Get in[edit]

By train[edit]
Nancy is served by two major railway stations:

48.6897226.1736112 Gare de Nancy Ville.   (updated Jun 2023)
48.94756.1697223 Gare Lorraine-TGV (20 km).   (updated Jun 2023)
The main railway station seen by night
The Gare de Nancy Ville is the historical railway station, in the heart of the city, a major hub for national (including TGV) and regional trains (TER Métrolor). Major train lines include:

Paris - Nancy: 1 hr 30 min by TGV
Strasbourg - Nancy:  1hr 15 min
Dijon - Nancy: 2 hr 30 min
Lyon - Nancy: 4 hr
Luxembourg (city) - Nancy: 1 hr 30 min
There are washing machines on the station, but no baggage room and no lockboxes.
The Gare Lorraine-TGV is 20 km north of Nancy. The station is served only by TGV high-speed trains of the TGV Est high-speed line, linking Paris to Strasbourg. Destinations include Bordeaux, Northwest France, Lille, and various TGV stations around Paris (such as Charles de Gaulle Airport).
Because of local political feuds, the station was built halfway between Nancy and Metz, in the middle of nowhere. Thus, the station can only be accessed by road (A31 motorway). The station includes a taxi station. Additionally, a shuttle operated by the SNCF connects the station to Gare de Nancy Ville.
For schedules, fares and bookings, see the SNCF website.

By car[edit]
Nancy is an important regional automotive hub:

A31 to the north: Metz, Luxembourg
A31 to the west: Dijon, Lyon, Paris
A33/D400 (former N4) to the east: Strasbourg, Germany
N57 to the south: Épinal
By bus[edit]
International bus services are operated by Flixbus. Coaches usually stop at the Porte Sainte-Catherine, near the marina.

By boat[edit]
Nancy is crossed by the Canal de la Marne au Rhin, which is open to navigation for small boats and péniches. The Port de Nancy Saint-Georges offers dockage to visiting boats. It is on the eastern edge of the city centre, 500 m away from the place Stanislas.

On foot[edit]
Nancy is on the GR 5, a 2,600 km-long footpath that links the North Sea to the Mediterranean Sea.

Get around[edit]
By foot[edit]
Walking is one of the easiest and most pleasant ways to get around. The city centre is very compact, so most places of interest can be easily reached by foot. For example, walking from the railway station to the Porte Sainte-Catherine takes about 20 min. Many streets are pedestrian-only.

By public transportation[edit]
Nancy's tramway on tyres
The local public transportation system is operated by the Service de transport de l'agglomération Nancéienne, known as STAN. Coverage of the city is decent, but can be found quite wanting compared to other French cities of the same size. It can nonetheless be useful for moving around Greater Nancy, between the city centre and suburbs.
Until early 2023, the city had a peculiar "tramway", actually trolleybuses guided by a central rail set into the roadway. This never fulfilled the promises made by the manufacturer and was notoriously unreliable. It is now being replaced by a normal trolleybus route, but expect the city centre to be disrupted by works to rip up the guiderail.
Buses operate from 06:00 to 21:00. Service is dismal during Sundays and holidays.
On buses, you can buy tickets (€1.30) directly from the driver, but the ticket machines formerly provided at "tramway" stops are still in use. The only credit cards accepted are European-style ones with a chip.
Tickets are valid for one hour. If you'll be moving around Greater Nancy a lot, you might consider purchasing a "Pass 10" (€8.70) or a "Pass Découverte 24h" (€3.30). The latter one is valid for an unlimited number of trips during 24 hours.
There are two STAN offices in the city, where you can find maps and timetables, purchase tickets or ask information about the network.

48.688736.175495 Espace Transport (Gare de Nancy-Ville), Place de la République (Within the main railway station, near the exit 'République'), ☏ +33 383 300 808. 
48.689396.18426 Agence STAN, 3, rue du Docteur Schmitt (near the marketplace), ☏ +33 383 300 808. 
By bicycle[edit]
A VéloStan'lib bike rental station.
There are about 130 km of safe bike routes in the Greater Nancy area [1]. Cycling can be an excellent way to get around during spring and summer (much less in winter).
The city has a bike rental system called VélOstan, offering short- and long-term bike rental.
The short-term service is called VélOstan'lib and is quite similar to those found in other French cities. Users can to pick up, and drop cycles to and from over 25 points around the city. You need a credit card (Visa/MC/French CB) to make use of the service. It is very cheap:

1-day ticket: €1.50, then free for the first 30 min of each ride, €1 for 30 to 60 min, then €2 every 30 min.
7-day ticket: €5, then same fares as the 1-day ticket.
30 min is generally more than enough if you stay close to the city centre.
As of 2012, there are very few stations outside the city centre. Be careful not to go too far, as you may not find any station to return your bike to and then be overcharged. There are, however, plans to cover the whole Greater Nancy area.
The long-term rental service is called VélOstan'boutic. Users can rent bikes and accessories for up to one year. Price range from €2 for half a day, to €80 for a whole year. Reduction may apply in certain cases.
There are 5 shops around the city, including one in the main railway station (exit Place Thiers).
If you stay long enough to need your own bike, you can find cheap used bikes at the Atelier Dynamo, a small collective workshop. Membership can be as low as €15/year (for students), usable bikes can be found for €25 or more.

48.695856.180712 Atelier Dynamo, 35, Grande rue (near St-Epvre basilica, in the old town). 
By car[edit]
The streets of the city are narrow and not adapted to mass traffic. The local authorities are actively discouraging the use of cars in the historical centre, and have set up many pedestrian-only streets as well a labyrinth of one-way streets. Surface parking is rare and expensive. Avoid driving within the city if you can.
There are several underground car parks in the centre [2], as well as three park and ride car parks on the outskirts of the city. The latter are managed by STAN (see public transportation section for more info).

Taxis[edit]
The fares are fixed by the authorities and can vary depending on your destination or the time of the day. Minimum fare is €6.20 (as of January 2011). Taxis cannot be hailed on the street; you need to go to a taxi station or to call for one.
The major taxi companies are:

 Taxis de Nancy (Association Artisanale des Taxis de l'Agglomération Nancéienne), ☏ +33 383 376 537. 
 Taxi ServiTrans 54, ☏ +33 383 635 555. 24/7.

Drink[edit]
Nancy by night.
Nancy has its fair share of Irish pubs, wine bars, cafes, and other drinking establishments. The night life is quite active, due to the presence of many students. However, things tend to be more subdued during the summer holidays. Major nightlife spots are in the Ville vieille and near place Stanislas.

Stay safe[edit]
Nancy is a relatively quiet town, but usual advice applies. The city has seen a spike in muggings in the late 2010s.
Most of the upper northern neighbourhoods, known as "Plateau de Haye", as well as the commune of Vandoeuvre, have the reputation to be sensitive areas. As there is little of interest for tourists there, it is probably better to avoid these areas altogether.

Emergency numbers[edit]
 Police, ☏ 17. 
 Fire brigade, ☏ 18. 
 Medical emergency, ☏ 15. 
 European emergency number, ☏ 112 (should be used on mobile phones). 
Stay healthy[edit]
There are two major hospitals with emergency rooms:

48.646946.1487611 C.H.U de Brabois, Rue Morvan, ☏ +33 383 153 030. (updated Jun 2023)

Respect[edit]
When talking to locals, do not make unflattering comparisons of Nancy viz. the neighboring city of  Metz. The two cities have been political rivals for many centuries. Both are vying for the title of capital of Lorraine. This causes sometimes some crispations. To give you just an example, in 1970, the administrative seat of the Lorraine region was transferred from Nancy to Metz. It caused a small scandal back then, and some people are still bitter about it today.
