 Whipple Company Store, 612 and Scarbro Road, ☏ +1 304-465-0331. WV-in Scarbro. An impressive wooden structure built in the 1890s for the mining company; the store sold merchandise until the late 1980s, even after the mine closed in 1957. Today the building is a museum about the history of coal mining, coal miners, and their families. 
The small village of Minden (Minden Road, off WV-16) was a mining town in 1899, and still features examples of the company-built miners' homes. The mines themselves closed in the 1950s, and today the village - although it's only about 5 minutes outside Oak Hill - has a very different look than most small country towns. If you pay it a visit, drive slowly - the roads are narrow, with homes crowded close in, and young children are often playing in the streets. Minden has been a source of contention due to its status as a Superfund site and the community's contamination with PCBs in the 1980s, which many have claimed led to a "cancer cluster" in the area.
