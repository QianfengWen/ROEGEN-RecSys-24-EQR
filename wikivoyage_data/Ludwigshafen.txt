Ludwigshafen (Rhein) is a city in Rhineland-Palatinate.


Understand[edit]
Ludwigshafen is a big city on the west side of the Rhine (population: approx. 165.500) in the east of Rhineland-Palatinate, and across the river from Mannheim, in Baden-Württemberg. Ludwigshafen is famous for its chemical industry, especially the BASF. There are many boroughs, for example Mundenheim, Maudach or Oggersheim. Ludwigshafen lies to the south of Worms and to the east of Kaiserslautern. It is near the Palatinate Forest.

Get in[edit]
Ludwigshafen does not have an airport. If you get in by train, you will have to change to a local train or a suburban train in Mannheim, because intercity trains don't stop at Ludwigshafen. Mannheim, however, is a very important train station, so you won't have any problems to get into Ludwigshafen. If you want to travel by taxi, you can get one at Ludwigshafen main station, if you prefer to travel by tram or bus, go to "Ludwigshafen Mitte" with suburban train (RE) S1 or S3 or take a tram right in front of Mannheim's central station.

Get around[edit]

The centre for most means of transportation is the  "Berliner Platz." There are tram lines, busses and the train station "Ludwigshafen Mitte." You can also find taxis there. If you get in by regional train, you might prefer to get out at Ludwigshafen Mitte, because the main station is not so well connected to the bus lines. But you will always get a taxi there.

Ludwigshafen is not exactly the place for a great shopping experience, but it has a well-known shopping mall. This is the "Rhein Galerie" which is situated at the river bank, next to the city centre and opposite Mannheim. It is open since September 2010 and is a great option when the weather is not good enough for walking through the many shopping streets of Mannheim.
There are many stores which you will also find everywhere else, mostly fashion, but there are some special places such as a Swiss supermarket. At the entrance there is a bar called "Sunset Lounge" where you can have nice drinks and enjoy the view on the Rhein. In case you have a car, you can park it in the "Park and Ride" area. In the middle of the building there is a nice food court.
