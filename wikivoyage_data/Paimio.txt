Paimio (Swedish: Pemar) is a town in Finland Proper.


Understand[edit]
The railway station – no trains stop here though.
Paimio is on the Paimionjoki river and on the railway and highways between Turku and Helsinki, with Piikkiö to the west, Sauvo to the south, Halikko (of Salo) to the east and Tarvasjoki (of Lieto) and Marttila (of the Inland of Finland Proper) to the north.
Paimio is best known for the sanatorium by Alvar Aalto, where the architecture and environment were envisioned to help in the treatment. Since 2015 it is not a hospital any more, but quite a bit off as a side trip from Turku.

Get in[edit]
0°0′0″N 0°0′0″EMap of Paimio

Paimio centre is 24 km east of Turku, a few kilometres north from highways 1 (E18) and 110 from Helsinki. The former is a motorway, the latter more quiet and better for viewing landscapes. There are two main crossroads on the highways south of the centre: the one of road 181 and the one by Lähteenmäki. Road 110 has a third one in between. Paimiontie forks off the highways at Tammisilta on the border to Piikkiö and leads eastward to the centre from there.
Road 181 runs between Tarvasjoki of Lieto and highway 10 in the north and Sauvo and Kimitoön in the south, passing close by the centre.
The train station is not in use by passenger trains. Regional trains from Turku have been discussed since the 1990s but are still in the blue, as of 2023.

By bus[edit]
Bus lines 703–709 and 720P drive from Turku to Paimio centre (Turku–Paimio 35–60 min). Lines 703, 705, 720, 721 and 722 drive into Paimio by Valtatie (road 110; the latter three bypass the centre); 704, 706 and 720P by Paimiontie; 707 by Teerlakiantie; and 709 by the motorway (with no stops in Kaarina or Piikkiö).

703: via Naskarla to the centre
704: via Paimiontie to the centre
705: via Naskarla and the centre to the sanatorium
706: via Paimiontie and the centre to the sanatorium
707: via Hepojoki and Teerlakia to the centre
709: along the motorway (road 1, E18) to Lähteenmäki, then via Paimio centre to the sanatorium
720, 721, 722: along road 110, turning towards Sauvo and ending in Sauvo, Kimito and Dalsbruk, respectively
720P: via Paimiontie and the centre to Sauvo
Lines L6 and L11 of Lieto, to Tarvasjoki, pass along highway 10 (12 km north of Paimio centre), with their 60.550222.69251 Isohallintie stop just north of Paimio's border. L8 stops a bit earlier, but might be usable. From Turku you need a transfer in Lieto, and timetables are sparse. Line K6 of Kaarina (likewise: sparse) drives from Toivonlinna and Piikkiö to Hepojoki and Teerlakia (transfer from 7xx buses by Piikkiö church if coming from Turku or Kaarina).
Although especially the 72x lines may be served by coaches, all the above services are part of the Föli cooperation, see the Föli pages for timetables and routes. Paimio is not yet part of the cooperation (they will join on 1 July 2024), so tickets to Paimio cost as on coaches. If you get off before the border, in Kaarina/Piikkiö or Lieto/Tarvasjoki, they cost €4/€2 or €3/€1.50 (adult/child) depending on payment method.
Check Matkahuolto for other buses and coaches. Normal express (pikavuoro) coaches stop at the motorway junction a few kilometres south of the centre (from Turku €7–9/€5, 25–30 min; from Helsinki €10–30/€10–15, 1¾–2¼ hr). In daytime there are services more than hourly.
Some special express (express) coaches between Turku and Helsinki do not stop in Paimio

By bike[edit]
The most convenient route for biking from Turku (if not taking the bikes on the bus; bike fare on Föli buses €3, folded bikes free, on coaches possibly €14) is the signposted regional biking route 11. It uses the cycleways along road 110 to Piikkiö, then by other roads a bit north of it. There may be a 3-km stretch without cycleway just before Paimio.

By boat[edit]
The bay off the river mouth has a depth of about a metre and no official fairway, so you need a small boat. Check whether there are guest berths in the marina. For canoes and kayaks, which can be carried past the dams, the river offers nice landscapes.
The bay is accessible from the south via Gullkrona fjärd, Peimari and Paimionselkä between Pargas and Sauvo. From the west, the main sounds to Peimari and Paimionselkä are south of Stortervolandet and Lemlax, Rävsundet (with a high bridge) between Pargas and Kaarina, and Kuusistonsalmi (with a low bridge) in Kaarina. From 2023 until April 2025 Rävsundet is closed because of bridge works.

Get around[edit]
Paimio has two systems of local traffic: the Kymppilinjat[dead link], primarily for the elderly, and the lines PA1–PA4, primarily for school transport. Anybody can use these, tickets as on Föli buses.
