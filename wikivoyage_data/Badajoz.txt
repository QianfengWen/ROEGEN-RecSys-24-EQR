Badajoz is a city in Extremadura on the western border of Spain, looking across into Portugal. Its sprawling surrounds are industrial and residential, with a population of 151,565 in 2011, but the old city centre has many places worth seeing, such as its Moorish citadel Alcazaba. Badajoz is a good place to break a journey between Madrid and Lisbon.


Understand[edit]
Alcazaba, the citadel
Badajoz has been inhabited at least since 4000 BC; it was settled by Romans as Civitas Pacensis, then by the Visogoths. In the 8th century it was captured by the Moors, eventually becoming capital of their small kingdom or Taifa of Baṭalyaws. After the Christian reconquista, this area was disputed between Spain and Portugal, changing hands several times until a treaty of 1715 assigned it to Spain. Badajoz fell to Napoleonic forces during the Peninsular War, but in 1812 the future Duke of Wellington captured it after a costly siege, and began to roll back the French from across Spain. In 1936 the city was also an early victory for the Nationalists in the Civil War, whereupon they took some 4000 Republicans to the bullring and shot them.
Badajoz is industrial, with a large service sector, manufacturing of linen, woollen and leather goods, hats, pottery, and soap, and with cross-border trade with nearby Portugal. It has the typical climate of Extramadura, with hot dry summers (over 35 °C) and near-zero winter temperatures.

Badajoz Airport has no commercial flights in early 2021, either fly into Madrid (MAD IATA) or Lisbon (LIS IATA). 
Trains from Madrid Atocha Cercanías lumber every 2-3 hours across Extramadura, taking 5 hours with over a dozen stops such as Talavera de la Reina. A couple are direct, otherwise you change at Merida. A high speed line is under construction which (perhaps from 2024) will reduce the journey to two hours. The grand plan was for this to extend to Lisbon but work on the line in Portugal has been cancelled. One train per day runs from Lisbon Oriente to Entroncamento where you change for the cross-border train to Badajoz, journey time just over 4 hours.
38.891-6.9821 Badajoz railway station is 1 km north of the river. See below for local buses into town.
Avanza Bus runs 3 times a day from Madrid South station, taking 6 hours via Merida, for a fare (as of 2021) of around €35. Two buses continue west to Évora and Lisbon Oriente railway station, airport and Sete Rios bus and railway station, another four hours. 
Buses also run four times a day from Caceres, taking 75 min.
38.867-6.9752 Badajoz bus station is 1 km south of city centre.

La Galera gardens
38.883611-6.9683331 Alcazaba de Badajoz. This Moorish citadel was built in the 9th century, though what you see now is the 12th century Almohad fortifications. It's walled, with 8 towers: greatest of these is the 30 m Torre de Espantaperros - "scare-dogs tower", named for the effect of its bell on the dogs lazing in the plaza below. After the Almohads were ousted the citadel's mosque became the cathedral until St John's was built. The ducal palace La Galera has been city hall then a prison and now houses the Archaeological Museum, with finds from the Visigoth, Roman, and other periods. A large section of the citadel is occupied by Jardines de la Galera - the name indicated "gallows" as condemned prisoners were permitted to exercise here.   (updated Jul 2021)
