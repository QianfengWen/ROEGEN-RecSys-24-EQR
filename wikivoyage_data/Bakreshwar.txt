Bakreshwar is a pilgrimage centre in the central region of West Bengal.


Understand[edit]
According to Hindu belief, an insulted Sati, the wife of Lord Shiva, sacrificed herself at a yajna (fire worship ritual) which was being performed by her father Dakshmaharaj. Angry with this incident Lord Shiva started the tandava nritya (dance of destruction). In order to prevent the destruction of all creation, Lord Vishnu used his Sudarshan charka (wheel) to cut the body of Sati into several parts. Sati's body was scattered all over the Indian subcontinent. There are 51 such holy spots where temples have been erected and they are called Pithas or the Shakti Pithas. Some of the Pithas are in West Bengal. The most popular of them are Kalighat (in Kolkata}, Bakreshwar and Tarapith. Bakreswar is said to be the pitha where Sati's forehead and eyebrows fell. 
The main temple is that of Shiva or more popular than that of Bakranath. In architectural style it is akin to the “rekha-deul” of Odisha. Numerous Shiva temples surround the main temple, and a large number of temples are without any image.
According to legend, the disfigured and disconsolate Astabkra {also known as the sage Lomas), out on a pilgrimage, arrived at Kasi (Varanasi) intent on worshipping Shiva. He was informed that his prayers could not be answered till they were offered at an undefined spot named Gupta Kasi (the hidden Varanasi) in the distant realm of Gaur (Bengal). Astabakra took to an eastern direction and ended at Bakreswar, where he adored Siva for ten thousand years. The god, touched by the persistence of his votary, declared that those who worshipped. Astabakra first and himself afterwards would be vouchsafed an endless store of blessings. Viswakarma, the architect of the gods, received a command to erect a temple on the auspicious spot, and a stately shrine soon rose on the eastern shore of the river Bakreswar containing two graven images, the larger of which represented Astabakra. There is no evidence of the present temple being such an ancient one. A tablet records that a portion of the edifice was erected by one Darpanarayan in the year 1761 AD. 
There are eight hot springs of varying temperatures. The hottest, known as the Agni Kundu, is not far short of 200 °F (93 °C). It is said that water has healing powers. There is a large pond for bathers. Some piped water is also available for those who do not desire to get down into the pond. 

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
Bakreshwar is not served by any railway stations. Suri and Dubrajpur are the nearest options.

By car[edit]
Bakreshwar is on the Suri-Dubrajpur Road. There are two such roads - one via Chhinpai (near which is the power station) and the other via Bakrehwar. The latter is the lesser-used and slightly longer route. Buses ply this route.
