See and do[edit]
The main draw there is undoubtfully beaches, the bikini beach on the island is very small.

4.260672.99151 Bikini beach. You can also snorkel and see Mantas, Stingrays and some sharks which will swim away once you try to get close to them.. However, its coral reef has started degrading due to touristic activity and perhaps will die off in several years. And yay, bikinis are allowed here, in opposite to all other beach areas on the island where it's strictly prohibited. (updated Nov 2016)
4.2630772.991122 Masjid Hudha. (updated Nov 2016)
4.265573.00033 Picnic Island (Madivaru Island). Accessible by boat which could be arranged by any of the hotels.It is cheaper to  ask a local fisherman to take you there. Just negotiate price and time with the fisherman (updated Jan 2017)

Lots of shops selling overprices souvenirs. Not much less of grocery shops with very extensive range of products from all over the world, which is quite surprising, they also sell some fruits and vegetables.

4.264672.991381 Bank of Maldives, Rasdhoo branch. It has 24-hr ATM with Rf10,000 maximum withdrawal limit + Rf100 fee. Exchange rates are substandard, so it's better to change money in Male. (updated Nov 2016)
Eat[edit]
4.263372.991721 Coffee Ole, Bodu Magu, ☏ +960 777-8097. Nice place to drink a good cup of coffee. Menu is somehow limited to about a dozen of options, of which soups are better to avoid, some sorts of fried noodles are tasty. They also try to promote some meals that can be prepared by only preordering them one day in advance, however, in reality it then turns into variety of reef fish or even a lobster. Big fish served for us came on table after long waiting though a bit undercooked so it went back to kitchen for further processing.Disappointing experience, but tasty barracuda. However, general impression is positive for fish, curries, cocktails and coffee. Do not waste time for any Western type of food, it is not a place for that. WiFi is available for Cafe guests. Rf50-120 + 6% service charge. (updated Nov 2016)

4.2632172.992993 Coconut Garden. 09:00 - 00:00. Small restaurant on a side street with good food and cheap prices. However, owners cheat with total bill prices, which kills all the impression. Rf30-50 +12% service charge. (updated Nov 2016)
