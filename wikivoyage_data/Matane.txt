The Matane River ends at the St. Lawrence in Matane
Nominally in eastern Québec's Bas-Saint-Laurent administrative region, Matane is located on the south shore of the St. Lawrence where it serves as a gateway to the Gaspé Peninsula. A charming seaside community known for its excellent shrimp, Matane is the seat of "La Matanie" MRC (regional municipal county) and the largest economic centre serving the Gaspé region to the east. The town has about 15,000 inhabitants and the urban area nearly 25,000.
The Matane River, 101 km (63 miles) in length, is well-known as a good place to learn to fish.
