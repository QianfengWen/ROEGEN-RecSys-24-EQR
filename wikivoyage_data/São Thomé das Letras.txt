Igreja Matriz in São Thomé das Letras
São Thomé das Letras is in Southern Minas Gerais.


Understand[edit]
The name of the town is based in a legend of a runaway slave who found a statue of Saint Thomas inside a grotto, together with a letter written perfectly in superb calligraphy (impossible for an illiterate, untrained slave), after fleeing the plantation farm belonging to the powerful Baron of Alfenas (a rich landlord), where he was kept captive. When the slave was found by slave catchers, this revelation resulted in his alforria (emancipation) from his owner, who was greatly amazed by the facts and story the slave brought to him. The baron afterwards commanded the construction of a church beside the grotto; today, this church is the center of São Thomé das Letras.
