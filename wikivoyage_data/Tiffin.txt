Tiffin is a city in Northwest Ohio and part of the United States of America.  It is the county seat of Seneca County, a rural county of Ohio.  It is also the home to two institutions of higher learning: Tiffin University and Heidelberg University.


Understand[edit]
The Tiffin skyline
Once a bustling industrial city, Tiffin's manufacturing base and population has declined in recent decades.  However, Tiffin residents enjoy cultural and educational opportunities unmatched by most small towns thanks to the two colleges that that call Tiffin home.
The city of Tiffin is bisected by the Sandusky River.  Just east of the river is the city's downtown area, including city hall and public library. On the western side of the river, on the outskirts of town is the Wal-Mart, shopping mall, and supermarket.
Tiffin itself is seldom a destination for tourists.  However, if family or business reasons call you to Tiffin, rest assured you will find activities to fill your time, as well as a friendly small town atmosphere.
