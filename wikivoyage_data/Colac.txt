Colac is a town on the Princes Highway in the  Great Ocean Road region of Victoria.


Understand[edit]
The Princes Highway goes directly through the centre of this pretty Victorian country town.  Shops line the strip, and there is a pretty central part with shade and fountains.  The lake and botanical gardens are a short walk or drive from the centre of town.
Colac is the major town of the diverse Otways region, which has landscapes to appeal to everyone. With spectacular natural scenery, mighty timbers and magnificent waterfalls, the lush green hills roll down to long stretches of sandy beaches of the Great Ocean Road. There's also the volcanic lakes, craters and wetlands of the Hinterland.
The region encompasses smaller villages including Gellibrand, Forrest, Birregurra, Cressy, Beeac, Beech Forest and Lavers Hill. There are also the seaside hamlets of Wye and Kennett River, Cape Otway, Johanna Beach and the relaxed beach resort of Apollo Bay.
The Colac Visitor Information Centre can assist with all enquiries regarding this unique and diverse region.
