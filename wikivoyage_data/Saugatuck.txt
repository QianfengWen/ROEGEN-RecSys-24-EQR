Saugatuck and Douglas are small adjacent resort towns in West Michigan on the shores of Lake Michigan, and at the mouth of the Kalamazoo River. They are mostly a summer resort area popular with locals and Chicago residents, and have a lively arts scene and many out of the ordinary shops and restaurants.  They offer a peculiar mixture of traditional small-town midwestern values and progressive alternative-lifestyle tolerance.
