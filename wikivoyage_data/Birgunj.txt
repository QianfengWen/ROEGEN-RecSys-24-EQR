Birgunj is a city in Parsa district, Nepal.


Understand[edit]
Shankharacharya Gate
The city is located on the borders with the Indian state of Bihar, and is a major point of entry for goods coming from India and also the port of Kolkata.

Get in[edit]
Flights to the city are available from Kathmandu to an airport city called Jeetpur-Simara from where it takes around 30 minutes to reach Birgunj. If you have hotels booked then there is possibility of pick up from the airport to the hotel or you can hire some cabs.
If you want to travel by land then there are several buses leaving from Kathmandu and some are really good services. There are also night buses leaving from Kathmandu to Birgunj and these are the best buses running in Nepal.
Travel by Tata Sumo (jeep) from Birgunj to Kathmandu takes 4-5 hours and is a bumpy ride at best—perhaps not for the faint of heart.  The ride should cost INR350-400 (NPR 600).

Connect[edit]
If you're looking for a local Ncell SIM card, Birgunj has an official Ncell store halfway up the main road on the right from the border as you walk towards the large tower in the middle of the road. They speak perfect English! For more information about telecommunications in Nepal, have a look under the 'Contact' section in Nepal.

Go next[edit]
To get to Kathmandhu, your only options are private bus or jeep (sumo). Buses leave 6AM-10AM, then 7PM-10PM, with a 'deluxe' bus leaving daily at 7PM. Sumo's/Jeeps's can usually be taken from 6AM-3PM, and cost Rs 500 NPR per person in a ten-person shared Jeep, or Rs. 6000 NPR for a whole private jeep to yourself or your travelling companions. To get either a bus or jeep, you'll need to go to the bus station, which is located just off the main road. Keep going north (3 km from the border) until you reach a large tower in the middle of a round-a-bout. Take a right hand turn and the bus stop is 50m down that road. While it's little more than a dirt patch in the north of town, you'll know you got there as there are always plenty of buses parked. A cycle rickshaw should be about NPR 80 for the distance. Jeeps leave when full, from near the road (not towards the back of the bus stop) so expect to wait up to an hour.
