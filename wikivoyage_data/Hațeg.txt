45.58876722.9668241 Kendeffy Castle (Castelul Kendeffy), Sântamărie Orlea (3 km from Hațeg). The Kendeffy family raised the stateliest noble mansion in Hateg Country, probably on the site of an older residence in Sântamarie Orlea. It is a complex of buildings, a massive residence, with a tower raised west of its northern façade and with two other outbuilings (the stables and the servants' house), lying Northwards, U-shaped. In the l8th century, a superb Latin inscription was laid above the entrance, testifying to the couple's love and featuring the coats of arms of the families who owned the building at the time. 
45.59060322.9700732 Sântămăria-Orlea Church (Biserica din Sântămăria-Orlea), Sântămărie Orlea. Knyaz Cândea's church, now Calvinist, once Catholic, is one of the oldest churches in Romania. Built at the end of the 13th century. In the 15th century, more frescoes of a clear Eastern origin were added to its altar. This interior mix makes the church in Sântamarie one of the most original medieval monuments in the whole of Transylvania, where the Catholic and the Orthodox denominations have coexisted in a surprising synthesis. The church is one of the very few Protestant churches in Hațeg Country. 
Prislop Monastery
 Prislop Monastery, Silvasu de Sus village (13 km from Hațeg). According to some local stories passed on by oral tradition, the monastery’s church may has been constructed by the apprentices of master-builder Nicodim in the 14th century. Research has shown that the architectural plan and even the structure of the monument combine all the characteristic features of the religious architecture of that epoch. The monastery underwent major repairs in 1564, through the generosity of Princess Zamfira, the daughter of Moise Voivode, who ruled over Walachia between 1529 and 1530. After her father had fallen in the battle of Viisoara that had taken place in 1530, the princess took refuge in the province of Transylvania, where she settled down and got married. She was entombed in this monastery. In 1762, General Bukow set fire to the monastic establishment, causing serious damage to it. Over the succeeding centuries it was renovated many times. Although the monastery has been a focus for the spiritual life of the Romanians beyond the Carpathian Mountains and had a great historical significance, it was closed down as a result of the Governmental Ordinance no 410/1959, issued on the orders of the communist authorities. In 1973, a monk settled on the premises and tried to revive the monastic life of this place. In 1976, through the persevering efforts of the ever-memorable Father Arsenie Boca and of Mother Zamfira Constantinescu, the holy establishment was reopened and served as a convent. After 1990, conservation, consolidation and restoration activities have been carried out within the monastery. A theological school for training both young female resident monastic and lay young women has also been accommodated in the monastery. In June 1992, the Holy Synod of the Romanian Orthodox Church decided to canonize Venerable Ioan of Prislop, who was one of the most outstanding representatives of the Romanian monasticism at the end of the 14th century. Antonie Plamadeala, Metropolitan of Ardeal, took religious vows and entered the monastic life in this very monastery. The holy establishment also shelters a monastic theological seminary. 
Densus Church
45.582522.8052783 St. Nicholas Church, Densuș (Biserica Sf. Nicolae, Densuș), Densuș village (To reach the Church of Densuș one must drive about 10 km out of Hațeg town.), ☏ +40 254 775010. At Densuș exists a bizarre but very elegant church. It is very near from the former Roman Dacia capital - Colonia Ulpia Traiana Augusta Sarmizegetusa. This strange building from the Hateg County was the object of many controversies between scientists, eager to find its origins. Some had considered that the church was first a mausoleum for Roman general Longinus Maximus, killed by the Dacians; others that it was a temple for Mars god; Nicolae Iorga said that the monument dates from 14th century, and art historian Vatasescu in the last quarter of the 13th century. Many investigations were made. But the monument is still its mystery. It is assumed that the old church was modified along the centuries, especially at the end of the 13th. Built from river rocks, bricks with Roman inscriptions, funerary stones, canalizations, etc., taken from Ulpia Traiana, the Densus church has a bizarre aspect, being admired but also looked with astonishment. In the interior some fragments of painting are kept. The paintings from the upper naves and altar are signed by the artist Stefan (signature that can be seen till today) and are revealing the great artistic skills of the master. The features of the painting send us to those of the St. Nicolae Church from Curtea de Arges, built in the 14th century. The resemblance is telling us that a master from Vallachia was present here in Transylvania.
