Tsu (津) is the capital of Mie prefecture, Japan, and home to about 290,000 people.


Understand[edit]
Running in board of Tsu Station
Tsu is often claimed to be the world's shortest pronounceable city name (IPA: [tsɯ]). The vowel is similar to the one in the English word 'too', but is shorter, has less lip rounding, and is typically voiceless; it is perceptible, but sounds 'whispered'. Also, as English speakers may find the [t] hard to hear, the name sounds rather like 'Sue'. Pronouncing the [t], however, is essential in conveying the meaning.
In Japanese, the city name is usually written either using the character 津, or with つ, a 'hiragana' symbol which indicates the syllable [tsɯ]. Tsu is the only Japanese city name which consists of a single kana, making it the shortest name for a place of any size in Japan.

Tourist information site[edit]
The local tourist association has a multilingual guide site.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Chubu Airport is connected to Tsu by a ferry service which takes 40 minutes. From the port there is a direct bus to Tsu station, costing ¥200. Taxis also queue at the port.

By train[edit]
Tsu is on the Kintetsu Nagoya Line between Yokkaichi and Ise, starting at Nagoya. The main station, Tsu (津駅), serves Kintetsu and JR trains. A basic ticket between Nagoya and Tsu costs ¥980 on the Kintetsu line. In the north is the smaller Kintetsu Edobashi Station (江戸橋駅), where most students get off for the university, while the south is home to Kintetsu Tsu-Shinmachi Station (津新町駅). Travellers can alight at any of the three stations for the same fare. There are other JR local line stations around the city. 'Limited express' trains cost extra and only stop at Tsu.
Tsu is also on a direct line to Osaka; for Kyoto travellers should take the Kintetsu line and change at Yamato-Yagi (the route with the Shinkansen to Nagoya is almost as long but twice the price).

Get around[edit]
Tsu is split from north to south by Route 23, a highway which runs down the west coast of Ise Bay from Nagoya. It is therefore fairly easy to orientate yourself relative to the road. Tsu railway station is just off Route 23 towards the centre of town, as is Edobashi station.
Buses run from outside Tsu station all over the city. Routes are written in Romanised Japanese on the front. Stops are signposted only in Japanese. At Tsu Station, passengers alight at one stop and board at another. The stop opposite the local police station and branch of McDonald's by Tsu Station serves several buses which head along Route 23 in the direction of Mie University (三重大学 Mie Daigaku) and the University Hospital (大学病院 Daigaku Byouin).
Board a bus via the centre door and take a ticket; you should look up its number on the board at the front of the bus to find the fare you should pay. Deposit the exact money in the box next to the driver on exit: you can change thousand-yen notes in a little machine.

Drinks include a large list of cocktails, whiskeys, ume-shu, sake and more. The bar is also the venue for a community restaurant at lunchtime cooked by local amateur chefs on a rotating schedule.

34.734349136.5111722 Green Park Hotel Tsu (ホテルグリーンパーク津), ☏ +81 59-213-2111.
