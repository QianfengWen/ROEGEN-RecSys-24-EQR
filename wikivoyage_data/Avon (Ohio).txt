Avon is a suburb of Cleveland with about 24,000 people (2018). There's not a lot to draw visitors, but those with a sense of whimsy may want to come in late June for the Avon Heritage Duck Tape Festival, which celebrates duct tape (yes, it's a festival about adhesive tape) and is sponsored by Duck brand duct tape.
