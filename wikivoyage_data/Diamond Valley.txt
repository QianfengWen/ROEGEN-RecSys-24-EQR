Diamond Valley is a small town tucked into the foothills at the base of the Rocky Mountains. The former twin towns of Black Diamond and Turner Valley were separated by the Sheep River, with Black Diamond located on the east side and Turner Valley located on the west side. Black Diamond gained its name from the nearby coal deposits, while Turner Valley was named after Robert and John Turner who settled in the area.
Alberta's first major oil and natural gas field was discovered in 1914 at Turner Valley, subsequent discoveries kept the oil and gas scene active in the Turner Valley area for the next 30 years. The Turner Valley Gas Plant was constructed shortly after the initial discovery, was operational until 1985, and now designated as a national and provincial historic site.
