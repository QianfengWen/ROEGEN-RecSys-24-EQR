Inverkip is a village in Inverclyde, the western part of Clydeside in the Central Belt of Scotland, best known for its large marina. In 2020 its population was 3490. 
Wemyss Bay (pronounced "Weems") three miles south is the railway terminus and ferry port for the Isle of Bute. Wemyss Bay merges to the south with Skelmorlie across the border into Ayrshire, but sights associated with that village are even further south, so see Largs.

Trains run hourly (6AM-10:30PM) daily from Glasgow Central via Paisley Gilmour Street (for Glasgow Airport), Bishopton and Port Glasgow to 55.906-4.87241 Inverkip (45 min) and 55.8769-4.88912 Wemyss Bay (another 5 min) where the railway station is next to the ferry pier. This station is an elegant 1903 creation of glass and steel curves, and has a good bar while you're waiting. It has a ticket office and machines, toilets, and step-free access to all platforms.
Inverkip station is just a platform halt with no ticket office, machines or other facilities, buy on board if you start your journey here. There is step-free access to the sole platform.
Calmac ferries sail from Wemyss Bay to Rothesay on the Isle of Bute. They take 35 min and sail at least hourly daily year-round 7AM-8PM, see  Bute for fares. You don't have to return the same way, as another ferry connects the island to the Cowal peninsula.
By bus: Stagecoach Bus 585 runs along the coast from  Ayr via Prestwick Airport, Saltcoats, Ardrossan (for ferries to Arran and Campbeltown) and Largs (for ferries to Great Cumbrae) to Weymss Bay and Inverkip, continuing north to Greenock. It runs every 30 min M-Sa and every two hours on Sunday.
McGill's Bus 901 runs from Glasgow Buchanan station via Port Glasgow, Greenock, Gourock (for ferries to Kilcreggan and Dunoon), Inverkip and Wemyss Bay to Largs. This bus runs hourly M-Sa and every couple of hours on Sunday.

Get around[edit]
Both villages are small and walkable, but take Bus 585 or 901 to get between them. You need a bike or car to reach anywhere away from the main road, such as Loch Thom.

See[edit]
55.9092-4.86551 Inverkip Parish Church. It was built in 1805. A hundred yards southeast on Millhouse Road, the old cemetery is on the site of the medieval church; some of its stone was re-used in the Shaw-Stewart mausoleum, now derelict. People from Greenock had to walk six miles each way to attend here until in 1859 they got their own church. (updated Mar 2020)
55.9169-4.86982 Ardgowan House. This is a plush 18th-century mansion at the north edge of Inverkip. It's hired out as a wedding venue (sleeps 20) but doesn't operate as a hotel or restaurant or do tours. So you'll have to be content with glimpses of the exterior and of its predecessor castle as you drive past on A78.   (updated Mar 2020)
Do[edit]
Wemyss Bay Station
Walk along the shore: it's a decent beach between Inverkip and Wemyss Bay now the former power station has been cleared away.
Loch Thom and The Cut: see Greenock for description, but these walks are closer to Inverkip, three miles up the Shielhill Glen lane.
Sea sports: various boat operators offer trips, sea-fishing, sailing, boat-handling courses and scuba-diving in the Firth. These are all for organised groups, so get in touch with the relevant sport ir training agency, there's nothing here that you can just rock up and join.
Golf: Skelmorlie GC is two miles south of Wemyss Bay. White tees 5030 yards, par 65, visitor round £25.
Scotland's Boat Show is held at Inverkip Marina in October. Or if that palls, watch the bath-duck races down the River Kip.
Buy[edit]
Supermarket: Sainsburys in Inverkip is open M-Sa 7AM-10PM, Su 9AM-9PM.
Buy a boat. The glitzy new stuff is all at the boat show but for better prices come another time, when craft and chandlery will range from serviceable to rusty bathtubs.

Connect[edit]
The ferry to Bute
Inverkip and Wemyss Bay have 4G from all UK carriers. This extends along the main roads but as of Aug 2022 there are lots of dead areas with Vodafone. 5G has not reached town but is getting close.

Go next[edit]
You're probably here to reach the Isle of Bute, where Mount Stuart House is the top sight.
Further down the "Costa Clyde" is Ayrshire, with Largs, Troon, lots of golf, and Robert Burns' birthplace near  Ayr.
The main reason Inverkip and Wemyss Bay have limited amenities is that central Glasgow is only an hour away. Take the hint.
