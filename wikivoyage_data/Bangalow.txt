Bangalow is a village in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales.  It is near Lismore, Nimbin, and about an hour's drive inland from Byron Bay.


Understand[edit]
Bangalow features a single main street, where the buildings are all done in a consistent Federation style.  You'll find the cafes and restaurants are more upscale than your typical small country town.  Bangalow makes a great day trip from the Gold Coast or Byron Bay.

Get in[edit]
The only way you can get into Bangalow is by car. The Sydney to Brisbane train does not run here. Not to worry, the route to get here from either Brissie or Coffs are pretty easy, with most of it being a motorway. From Brisbane, head south onto the Pacific Highway until B62. Once at B62, exit and then turn right towards Bangalow and Casino. Go around 500m and you've arrived. From Coffs, it's the same except that you take the Pacific Motorway northbound, and exit onto B62 and turn left and continue for about 400m.
