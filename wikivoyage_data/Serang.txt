Serang is the capital of the province of Banten, in the Western Java region of Indonesia. The city, with a population of about 600,000, is about 75 km west of the city centre of Jakarta. However, the distance between Serang and the urban sprawl of Greater Jakarta around Tangerang is only about 30 km. Although the city of Serang is nowadays much larger, the town of Banten about 7 km to the north is historically of much more importance.

Compared with the majority in Banten Province who speak the Sundanese language, in addition to the Sundanese language, some residents local people in Serang speak the Javanese language with a dialect similar to the Cirebon dialect of Javanese, called Bahasa Jawa Serang or Jaseng. The reason for this is that many Javanese migrants arrived in early 1527 to build the Banten Sultanate, and remained to form the base of today's population.
