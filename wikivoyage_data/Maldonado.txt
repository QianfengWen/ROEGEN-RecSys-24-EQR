Stay safe[edit]
Avoid the Maldonado Nuevo area in the northeast of the city, because since the 1990 a lot of poor people in search of work settled in this area although there were a lack of houses, developing slums that were focus of crime. The situation in this neighbourhood has improved, but the area could still be dangerous for tourists.
