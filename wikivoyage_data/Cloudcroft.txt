Cloudcroft
Cloudcroft is a town in Southeast New Mexico with a population of less than a thousand.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
High in the Sacramento Mountains, the village was started as a mountain resort (a glorified camp site) in 1899 by the coming of the Alamogordo and Sacramento Mountain Railroad.

Climate[edit]
During the summer, temperatures go above 70 °F (21 °C) and lows are between 40 °F (4 °C) and 50 °F (10 °C). During the winter, the range is from the 40s Fahrenheit to the teens.

Get in[edit]
Map of Cloudcroft
Cloudcroft is located at the junction of Highways US 82 and NM 244. The nearest airport with commercial air service is in El Paso, Texas, about 96 miles away.  Commute to Cloudcroft from nearby Alamogordo entails going through New Mexico's only Tunnel and driving through High Rolls/Mountain Park.

Get around[edit]
Cloudcroft has no public transportation, except horse and horse-drawn carriage rentals.  The town itself is tiny and easy to navigate on foot.  For outlying areas, plan to drive and know that 4-wheel drive is helpful in the winter.

See[edit]
Sunspot Solar Observatory
The high altitude, low humidity and dark sky ordinance for the village, make Cloudcroft a popular site for day and night sky viewing. It is home to two observatories. Both observatories are located about 16 miles south of Cloudcroft on Highway 6563, the Sunspot Highway: this can be a challenging drive when snow is present.
