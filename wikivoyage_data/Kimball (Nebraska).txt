Kimball is a very small town in Kimball County, which is in the Nebraska Panhandle. As of the 2010 U.S. census the population was 2,569 people, all living within 2.71 square miles.


Understand[edit]
Many tiny places hidden in the United States are proud of their home town and Kimball is no exception.

History[edit]
Kimball has historically been called by two different names. Established in 1870, the plot of land that would become Kimball was called "Antelopeville" due to the large population of antelope in the area.
In honor of Uninion Pacific worker Thomas Kimball, "Antelopeville" became Kimball in 1885.
Kimball has seen periods of growth and decline. There was a little over four thousand people residing in Kimball in 1950. With a population half that size today, there remains an open question on what exactly caused the decline.

Get around[edit]
By car[edit]
Distances between locations in Kimball are short and can easily be traversed by car. Trips are often less than 10 minutes unless you get lost.
You shouldn't remain lost for long, however. The street grid consists of numbered streets running from east to west (higher numbers are in the north) intersection with named streets and avenues that run north and south, on which the first number of the street addresses correlates with the number of the previous intersection. (e.g. 102 Chestnut Street is the first house past the corner of 1st and Chestnut Streets).
In the winter months, utilize caution as driving can be difficult due to the weather.

Inside Nebraska[edit]
Gering is a nice small city that is about 55 miles north of Kimball on NE-71, lots of history
Scottsbluff. You can't consider the Scottsbluff/Gering/Terrytown area done just by visiting Gering. Have to visit all three, including the largest, Scottsbluff, which has a zoo and historical theater.
Sidney: Closest city on the list at only 30 miles east, museum.
Out of State[edit]
Cheyenne is the largest city in Wyoming that annually holds the largest Western event, CFD, with rodeo, night concerts, and parades. So diverse that you feel like you aren't in Cheyenne the entire time! 63 miles west on I-80.
Denver is the huge capital of Colorado, with 650,000 people and all that a big city offers (once you get past the congestion of I-25, of course). 150 miles via I-80/I-25 or 200 miles via I-80/I-76.
Rapid City, the charter city of Mount Rushmore in South Dakota, alongside Keystone. 241 miles via NE-71/SD-79/US-18.
