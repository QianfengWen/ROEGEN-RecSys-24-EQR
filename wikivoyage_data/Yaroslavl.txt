Understand[edit]
With a population of 600,000 people, Yaroslavl is the second-largest city in Central Russia after Moscow. Its 1000-year history and location in the middle of Golden Ring make Yaroslavl a good point for a day or weekend trip from Moscow.

Taking the opportunity of no traffic jams from Moscow, if any, drive on Yaroslavskoye shosse aka M-8 'Kholmogory' and visit beautiful destinations en-route: Sergiev Posad, Pereslavl Zalessky, Rostov Veliky. The road takes 4 hours or more, depending on traffic near Moscow.

Religious buildings[edit]
Church of Ilya the Prophet: a very impressive church, which is run like a museum. The frescoes inside are exceptionally rich in detail, and depict many of the most vivid Biblical stories. Well worth a visit. There is often a small choir performing in one of the side galleries, asking only for donations. 500 руб
Alexander Nevskiy Chapel
Transfiguration Cathedral
St. John the Baptist Church: a beautiful brick church on the Volga-riverside in a dreary suburb. Well worth a small trip (you can get their with marshrutkas (about 50 руб in total) but taxis are much quicker and not that much more expensive (around 100 руб). This church is considered to be the epitome of Yaroslavl's school of church architecture - and probably the most impressive brick church of Russia, only surpassed by Saint Basil's of Moscow. 100 руб.

Eat[edit]
The best place to eat out is the Volga promenade but there is a bunch of curious restaurants:

57.69460239.7928981 Farfor (Доставка еды Farfor), Dzerzhinsky Avenue, 2d, ☏ +7-905-63-11-888. 11:00-23:00. Pizza, rolls, sushi, assorted sets, Japanese soups, salads, desserts, main dishes and drinks. ~500 руб per person. (updated Aug 2023)

 DudkiBar, 33 Sobinova St, ☏ +7 4852  33-09-33, dudkibar@dudkibar.ru. European, Japanese and grill menus. 
For more standard Russian fare, visit one of the modern 'stolovaya's'  (buffets) of the Bazar chain, found all around the city. Priced very competitively.

Drink[edit]
For a dark, smoky atmosphere, you could do worse than Bar Beer, which is on the main street, just off Ploshad Volkovo, heading towards the monastery. They only sell beer: if you're looking for anything other than beer, you would be better off heading to Ars Café, which is inside a theatre next to the Bear's Corner hotel. There are three main sections to Ars Café, an upstairs, with comfortable sofas, which is often busy, a downstairs section, with dance floor and a big long table for larger groups, and a back room, which you have to pay to get into, but is very comfortable, and is primarily supposed to be used to smoke Kalyan (Shisha). Across the road from Ars Café is Tarzan, a higher end establishment, which is a restaurant by day. Dark inside, with a jungle theme. The bar Silver is on Ulitsa Svobody, near the Ulitsa Pobedy junction. Pleasant inside, with a very silver theme. They also serve food. Bristol, on Kirova, is nice, but pricey.
Aktor, a studenty bar a few years ago, has become a seedy, unpleasant place, and Cocktail Bar, next door, threaten to serve you "Cancer" (a mis-translation of Crab), but that's the least of your worries - bad vodka, appalling service, and a joke of a toilet means it's better avoided.
