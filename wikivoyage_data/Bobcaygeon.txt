Bobcaygeon is a community of about 3,600 people (2021) in the Kawarthas region of Central Ontario. Built on three islands, it was settled in 1832. It is a popular place for shopping and sport fishing. 


Understand[edit]

Taken from the Algonquin language, the name Bobcaygeon means "shallow rapids". Its lock was the first to be built on the Trent-Severn Waterway, connecting Pigeon and Stugeon Lakes with a short canal along the Bobcaygeon River in 1833. Today, the town and surrounding area is a popular retirement destination, and a busy hub for boaters traversing the Trent-Severn, or cottagers venturing further into the Kawarthas.
It is well-known in Canada because in 1998, the Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip immortalized Bobcaygeon in their hit single that takes its name from the village.

Stay safe[edit]
Blue-green algae is a toxic form of algae that can be an occasional problem in this region. Do not swim or wade in water where this algae is present, do not drink the water, and do not let pets in the water. Blooms most commonly occur in late summer and early fall. They thrive in areas where the water is shallow, slow moving and warm, but they may be present in deeper, cooler water. Dense blue-green algae blooms may make the water look bluish-green, or like green pea soup or turquoise paint. Very dense blooms may form solid-looking clumps. Fresh blooms often smell like newly mown grass, while older blooms may smell like rotting garbage.
Poison ivy is common in wooded areas. All parts of poison ivy, including the roots, contain a poisonous substance which causes an irritating inflammation of the skin of most people, the inflamed areas frequently developing blisters and accompanied by intense itchiness.
