Bethel is a city of 6,500 people (2018) in Alaska. It is the main hub for many of the surrounding native villages and the main port of the Kuskokwim River in the Yukon Kuskokwim Delta. Bethel is one of the largest cities in Alaska. It's also home to the K-300 dogsled race and Cama-I, the largest Native arts festival in Alaska.

Understand[edit]
Because of its location and culture, there is much that a traveler would benefit from understanding before visiting Bethel.  The town is far off the road system, 400 air miles west of Anchorage, and all fuel, grocery, household items, building materials, vehicles, etc., must be flown in or shipped in by barge.  Consequently, prices are relatively high, even by Alaskan standards.  It is good to remember, however, that as a hub community, Bethel prices are still less (sometimes by half) than prices even in nearby villages.
The Y-K Delta (as the greater area is called) is home to an active subsistence culture.  Many residents, both Native and Non-Native, fish and hunt for food as well as for sport.

The only practical way into Bethel from outside the immediate area is by air. Alaska Airlines has morning, afternoon, and evening flights to Bethel Airport (BET  IATA) from Anchorage. Grant Aviation also serves Bethel to other small communities throughout.

Get around[edit]
There are a number of transportation options in and around Bethel for visitors and residents, depending on your level of ambition:

By plane[edit]
Aerial view of Bethel
The state-owned Bethel Airport (BET) is the regional transportation center, and is served by seven passenger carriers, including Alaska Airlines, Frontier Flying Service, Grant Aviation, Hageland Aviation Services, and Yute Air. It also receives service from small air taxi services including Renfro's Alaskan Adventures. The airport ranks third in the state for total number of flights. It offers a 6,400-foot asphalt runway and 1,850-foot gravel crosswind runway. Three float plane bases are nearby: Hangar Lake, H Marker Lake, and the Kuskokwim River. See the Go next section for more details.

By taxi[edit]
Bethel has more cabs per capita than any other city in the United States.  Due to the dependence of many residents and visitors on cabs, and the high cost of transportation, cab fee maximums are mandated by the City of Bethel, corresponding roughly to the distance of the trip. Rides within the central area of town are $5, to or from the Tundra Ridge subdivision or the Airport is $8, and trips to the Kasayuli Subdivision are $12. You may find that you are charged per person as opposed to per carload. 
Something important for visitors to Bethel to know is that cab rides in Bethel are often a "communal" experience.  While riding in a cab from the airport into the main part of town, for example, the cab driver may get a call to pick up another fare in Blueberry Subdivision.  While potentially uncomfortable for the shy traveler (or if the cab gets too crowded), this is actually a great way to meet people in Bethel.
These are numbers for the taxi services in Bethel

 Kusko Cab, ☏ +1-907-543-2169. 
By public transit[edit]
The Bethel city bus costs $3 a ride for adults (14-64) and $2 for children (3-13). Free for seniors (65+) and those under 3. Routes include most of the town and operates Monday to Friday.
Bus information page[dead link], including a schedule and map.

By car[edit]
Those visiting for an extended period of time or moving to Bethel may be considering renting or buying a car.  As is true with most everything in Bethel, prices are substantially higher than one would expect, both to purchase (or ship in), own, and maintain a car in the rural setting, but many people feel it is worth it for convenience and independence.
Gas prices are high ($6.67/gallon in Apr 2016), but do not fluctuate daily as in other places.  Cost is set by the retailers when new supplies are barged in through the brief summer months, meaning the price of gas will only change a couple times a year.

See[edit]
 Kuskokwim River. One of the largest rivers in Alaska it offers some great views and activities. 
 Bethel Art Guild. This local attraction is a great showcase of local art. It's near the local Moravian Church. 
 BIA Buildings. A popular local attraction is a group of abandoned buildings. While it is illegal to go into them they are still an interesting sight to see. 
 White Alice. Cold War-era radio towers that were put up all around Alaska, the Air Force and National Guard have been systematically taking them down all across the state. Bethel used to have one of the few remaining White Alices in the state, but alas it was doomed to be taken down. It is being disassembled. 
 Bethel Dumpsters. A unique community activity a number of years ago the city decided to spice up the streets a bit by painting dumpsters in each neighborhood. They are definitely an interesting sight to see. 
 Skate park. See the farthest west skate parks in the United States.

Do[edit]
Start of the Kuskokwim 300 sled dog race
Salmon fishing and hunting for moose, caribou, ptarmigan, geese, ducks, rabbits, bears. Best hunting spots: Northeast of Bethel, Behind Bethel Airport by about a mile.

 Kuskokwim 300. In the winter, you can go dog sledding & compete in Bethel's annual Kuskokwim 300 were you race to the village of Aniak & back to the city of Bethel with a dog team & a race sled. Also you can go to the town's basketball games during the high school basketball season. 
 Pinky's Park. It used to be a small park for kids, you can still go to the place where it used to be, some remains are still there, it is unknown when it was taken down. It used to be a hangout spot for a lot of teenagers and then it became the city's most hazardous spot due to muffed up teenagers going there to do some bad stuff. 
 BMX. There are really good bikers at the skate park. Some aren't so good and some are great. 
Buy[edit]
There are many stores in Bethel like Alaska Commercial Company, Swanson's, and Corina's. They are expensive, but better than nothing.
You could go look at the great artwork at the Cultural Center and maybe buy a piece of locally produced art for an awesome price. They have Saturday Markets every Saturday at the Cultural Center where they sell food, some artwork, and drinks like pop and coffee.
