For the city in Florida, see Lake Placid (Florida).
Lake Placid is a village of 2,400 people (2019) in the Adirondack Mountains in Essex County, New York, near the center of the town of North Elba and named after an adjacent lake.
While the village is a year-round resort, it is most known as the site of the 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics. In a 1980 USA-USSR hockey game, the "Miracle on Ice," a group of American college students and amateurs upset the heavily-favored Soviet national ice hockey team 4-3. Two days later, they won the gold medal.
Lake Placid hosts a Winter Olympics summer training facility where one can watch sports like ski jumping, aerial jumping and figure skating. The town is charming and fun for the outdoorsy and/or adventure-spirited.

Be sure to set out with a group of people with plenty of water, food, rain gear and safety equipment.
The Northville Placid Trail[dead link] (NPT) is a 133-mile footpath that crosses the heart of the Adirondack Park in New York State from Northville, NY to Lake Placid, NY. It is considered a lowland trail in that it doesn’t cross mountain peaks or follow mountain ridges. The trail passes through what many consider the wildest and most remote parts of the Adirondack Park, notably the high plateau that encompasses the Spruce, West Canada, and Cedar lakes area, along with that of the Cold River. The highest point the N-P Trail reaches (3008 ft) is at the crest of the ridge to the E of Blue Mt. and Tirrell Pond.
