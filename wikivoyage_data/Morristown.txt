Morristown is a town of 19,000 people (2019) in Morris County, New Jersey. Morristown has been called "the military capital of the American Revolution" because of its strategic role in the war for independence from Great Britain. This history is visible in a variety of locations throughout the town that collectively make up Morristown National Historical Park.


Get in[edit]
There is a small Morristown airport, but it services private jets only.
Car is a good bet and generally the parking isn't especially miserable though on-street parking is often metered. Navigating the green can be a bit of a headache at times and depending on where you want to go, but it's nothing to lose sleep over. A range of exits off Highway 287 allow quick and easy access to different parts of the city.
The Morristown train station is generally well served by NJ Transit, where you can commute between New York City Penn Station in about an hour.

Morristown National Historical Park[edit]
For two critical winters of the American Revolution, 1777 and 1779–80, General George Washington chose the Morristown, New Jersey area as the main Continental Army's winter encampment. Because of its strategic location, the area continually served as the military capital throughout the war. During the 1779-1780 Jockey Hollow encampment, over 10,000 soldiers endured the war's most severe winter.
Morristown National Historical Park was established in 1933 to preserve and commemorate the story of the Continental Army struggling to survive during the American Revolution. The park consists of four non-contiguous units including the Washington's Headquarters unit, Fort Nonsense, Jockey Hollow, and the New Jersey Brigade area. The park features two original structures, Washington's Headquarters at the Ford Mansion and the Wick House in Jockey Hollow.
