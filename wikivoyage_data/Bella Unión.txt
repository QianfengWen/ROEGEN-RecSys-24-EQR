The shore of the Uruguay River in Bella Unión
Bella Unión is more or less at the northwestern tip of Uruguay. Located on the Uruguay River in the northern interior of the country, it is close to the tripoint where Uruguay, Brazil, and Argentina meet.
If you come to Bella Unión on the bus from Salto, you'll see lots of gauchos riding horses, and maybe even riding the bus with you. This is a preview of what's to come: Bella Unión is solidly in gaucho territory. It's perfectly normal to see men and even surprisingly young boys riding horses down the street, and if you head to the outskirts of town, you'll see plenty of cows and horses grazing, usually (but not always) with someone keeping an eye on them.
Aside from agriculture, Bella Unión is known for its main tourist draw: the duty-free shops (free shops). They primarily cater to visitors from across the border in Argentina and Brazil, but are open to anyone with a foreign passport.

From elsewhere in Uruguay[edit]
Bella Unión is on Uruguay Route 3 just before it reaches the Brazilian border.
Chadre buses run twice a day from Montevideo, stopping in various cities along the way including Colonia and Salto. El Norteño buses also offer service from Montevideo, Paysandú, Salto, and other cities. COTABU serves Bella Unión as well.
Bella Unión doesn't have a bus terminal, so instead, buses stop near the centrally located Plaza 25 de Agosto, and they let passengers off on the way into town too. From Salto, expect to pay U$270–300 each way (as of 2017). El Norteño gives a discount for round-trip tickets.

From Argentina[edit]
Bella Unión is across the Uruguay River from Monte Caseros. There is no bridge, but boats are available multiple times a day on weekdays. It's about a 10-minute boat ride across the river.

From Brazil[edit]
Bella Unión is close to Barra do Quaraí, just across the border in Brazil. There is a bridge.

Get around[edit]
The main part of the city, including most of the duty-free shops, is small enough to walk around pretty easily. To get to places on the outskirts of town (such as Macanudo Free Shop), you're better off driving or riding a motorcycle. If you have a horse to ride, you'll be right at home getting around that way as well.

See[edit]
Bella Unión isn't exactly known for its sights. There's one museum, some public art, and a few decent parks, but this is mostly a destination for shopping rather than sightseeing.
