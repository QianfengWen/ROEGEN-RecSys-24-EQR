Tu-Sa, 10:00-14:00 & 16:00-19:30; Su & holidays, 10:00-14:00. The best cultural thing that Valladolid has is the Polychrome Wood Museum.

41.657-4.72453 San Pablo. Next to the museum there is the San Pablo church with a beautiful façade. On the side you will find the Palacio de Pimentel. Legend says that mother of Phillip II wanted to have her child baptised in San Pablo, but they were staying at the Palacio of the Pimentel family and due to the position of the door, the child was to be baptised in the nearby San Martin church. So that the Queen could have her way, baby Phillip II was taken out by a window facing San Pablo square.   
41.656389-4.7238894 Casa-Museo de Zorrilla. Jose Zorrilla is one of the most famous pucelanos (common name to refer to someone from Valladolid, as the city is also known as "Pucela"), a well-known Romantic poet and dramatist. To find his house, take the little street on the right as you go from San Pablo to the Museo de Esculturas.  
One of the oldest and most interesting areas is the area beside San Martin Church. Really old, all the streets surrounding the area have a special charm.
 Catedral and Iglesia de la Antigua. Not far away (3 minutes walking) from San Pablo you can find the Antigua church, representing the Romanesque style in Valladolid. In front of it, there is the cathedral, which is unfinished because the architect Juan de Herrera was called to build the Escorial. You can see one of the main towers missing. 
 School of Law and University Square. One of the essential stops is the old university, which is still in use. It is very close to the cathedral, and the façade is breathtaking! The entrance is protected by a group of columns on top of which rest several lions. 
41.651983-4.7284695 Plaza Mayor. The main square is attractive, and hasn't suffered too much over the years.   
 San Benito (take the street on the right side of the Town Hall in the main square). A huge, Gothic church is found. On the side of San Benito there is the monastery, where concerts and open-air cinemas are organised during the summer. Nearby you can find some remains of the city walls and the market hall, which has an attractive design in iron. 
 Campo Grande Park (between the railway station and the centre). Very attractive and worth a wander through. The park alongside the river is less impressive and not really recommended. 
41.65135-4.7248226 Pasaje Gutiérrez. A passageway "hidden" in the centre of the city.  
 Museo Patio Herreriano. 
Do[edit]
41.653889-4.7244441 International Film Festival (Semana Internacional de Cine). One of the more interesting things you can do in Valladolid is attending the film festival. The main objective is to show and promote films of artistic quality which contribute to the knowledge of worldwide cinematography.   
 [formerly dead link] International Tapas Competition. In November, the most important tapas event worldwide. During one week over 40 tapas bars of the city offer tapas to the public. 
Football: Real Valladolid were promoted in 2024 and now play soccer in La Liga, the top tier. Their home ground Estadio José Zorrilla (capacity 27,800) is 2 km west of city centre.
Buy[edit]
You can buy sweets typical of the city or the province, such as Mantecados de Portillo. You can buy, of course, the best wine of Spain, because in Valladolid there are some of the most famous wines in the world, like the Vega Sicilia. But you also have a lot of delightful wines at all prices.

Eat[edit]
In the city centre, you can find many restaurants. Castilla y Leon is known for suckling pig and suckling lamb. In Valladolid, the suckling lamb is more famous, and there are restaurants where you go exclusively to eat lamb and the waiters ask you just for the drinks. You can also find good places to eat suckling pig.
Valladolid has a tapas culture, but you have to pay for tapas everywhere in Valladolid. There are many cities in Spain where the tapas are for free with your drink. There is a tapas competition between Valladolid bars that is held once a year. It is so successful that the council created a national competition in 2005. If you want to visit Valladolid for a weekend it is worth checking when the tapas competition will be held.
You get another good chance at the beginning of September when the festival takes place. All the pubs put bars in the street, and next to the stadium you can find marquees from different Spanish areas where you can taste all the typical and famous Spanish dishes.
You find good tapas bars in the old part of the city centre, but one favourite is in Calle Correos, behind the council building. This pub won the tapas competition one year.
