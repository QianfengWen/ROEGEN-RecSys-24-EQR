The only way to get in (by land) is by car (or perhaps bike). There is no rail service, and the nearest airport is in Penticton about 15 minutes north. If you have your own boat, or want to rent one you can ride the length of Skaha Lake from Penticton.
Highway 97 runs through the town, from Penticton to the north and Oliver to the south. A nice alternative route is to take Eastside Road on the east side of Skaha Lake of Penticton.
