St Davids  (Welsh: Tyddewi or "house of David") is Britain's smallest city and home to Wales' most important cathedral. The city is in the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, and is part of a cultural history area in Wales.


Get in[edit]
St Davids Cathedral and Bishop's Palace
By road[edit]
St Davids is the westernmost city in Wales. The A487 connects St Davids to Haverfordwest and Fishguard, which provide connections to the A40, rail service to other points in the UK and ferry service to Ireland.
The A487 does at a few places between St Davids and Fishguard reduce to a single lane road, which may concern those who are not familiar with the traffic issues that this presents. In general, drivers should exercise caution and show courtesy to other road users. Many of the lanes and minor roads around St Davids have single lane stretches with passing places.
There is a large car park on the eastern edge of the city, as motorists arrive from Haverfordwest. From here you walk past a modern visitor centre and tourist office on the way into the centre. A second, smaller car park can be found near the Bishop's Palace, on the road to St Justinian, and a third small car park to the left on the way out of town towards Whitesands Bay and Fishguard. All car parks are fee-paying, including the large one at Whitesands Bay, which overflows into neighbouring fields in high summer.

By bus[edit]
Richards Coaches service 411 Haverfordwest to Fishguard calls at St Davids. Connections with the National Express network from the rest of the UK can be made at Haverfordwest.

By rail[edit]
The best route (in terms of the number of trains and the number of connecting buses) is by train to 51.803-4.961 Haverfordwest station, and then the T11 bus from the railway station entrance to St Davids.
In addition, 52.012-4.9862 Fishguard Harbour station is about 15 miles to the north-east (but only has two trains a day), and is connected to St Davids by a less-frequent bus than the Haverfordwest service.  Plus the bus stop in Fishguard is a considerable walk from the railway station.

By sea[edit]
Stena Line sails from Rosslare in Ireland to Fishguard, which is a short bus journey from St Davids.
Visiting yachtsmen should use the harbour at nearby Solva.

Get around[edit]

The city is small enough that walking is the best way to get around and see the sights. Walking and hiking is also the best way to see the coastline around St Davids Head, as there are many hiking trails throughout the area. Roads in the area tend to be narrow, and can be busy in high season, also the car parks at the main tourist sites can fill up quite quickly, so driving can be a frustrating experience. To travel further afield than allowed by walking, cycling is a great option. Alternatively use the excellent bus service along the coast, organised by the local council.

There is a small shop and cafe in the car park, and a lifeguard station on the beach, which is divided into sections for swimmers and surfers/windsurfers.

The lifeboat station at St Justinian
51.878942-5.3084174 St Davids Lifeboat Station, ☏ +44 1437 720215. St Justinian — the "classic" lifeboat station, built up on stilts above the water, with the boat launching down a slipway to hit the water at speed.

There are interesting displays telling the stories of some of the rescues carried out by the lifeboat over the years, mostly involving boats carried by some of the fastest tides in UK waters on to The Bitches, the row of sharp rocks in the middle of Ramsey Sound. The selfless bravery of the lifeboatmen really comes through, especially reading the stories from the days when the lifeboat was just a large wooden rowing boat.

St Davids is near the extreme southwest tip of Wales, so to get out, you will likely have to return the way you came. If travelling around the coastal path, or touring by car, nearby towns include Haverfordwest and Fishguard. Places of interest further afield include Cardigan to the north, Tenby to the southeast and Carmarthenshire to the east.

Ramsey Island. An RSPB nature reserve known for its colonies of birds. Two boats per day land there, leaving from St Justinian at 10AM and noon, returning at noon and 4PM. Tickets available from Thousand Island Expeditions in Cross Square, St Davids.
Solva (Solfach) — pretty little village at the head of a long, narrow natural harbour. A more than 3-mile walk along the coast path to the east. The village has 4 pubs, so there's plenty of opportunity to get refreshments before walking back! The best views can be had from The Gribin, the cliff on the south side of the harbour. Solva's main car park is free.
Abereiddy small village and beach with plenty of activities. Near by is the Blue Lagoon.
