Flin Flon is a city of about 5100 people North of 53 in Manitoba on the border with Saskatchewan.  A small part of Flin Flon is located inside Saskatchewan, making it only one of two undivided border cities in Canada (alongside Lloydminster), although it is never enumerated as one of Saskatchewan's cities.


Understand[edit]
Flin Flon in the fall
Flin Flon was founded in 1927 by Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting (HBM&S) to exploit the large copper and zinc ore resources in the region.
The town's name is taken from the lead character in a paperback novel, The Sunless City by J. E. Preston Muddock. Josiah Flintabbatey Flonatin piloted a submarine through a bottomless lake where he passed into a strange underground world through a hole lined with gold. A copy of the book was allegedly found and read by prospector Tom Creighton.
When Tom Creighton discovered a high-grade exposure of copper, he thought of the book and called it Flin Flon's mine, and the town that developed around the mine adopted the name.

The town is named after the fictional character Josiah Flintabbatey Flonatin
The character of "Flinty", as he is locally known, is of such importance to the identity of the city that the local Chamber of Commerce commissioned the minting of a $3 coin which was considered legal tender amongst locally participating retailers during the year following its issue. A statue representing Flinty was designed by cartoonist Al Capp and is one of the points of interest of the city.
Its main industry is mining, and the town is dominated by the mine's smokestack. The town is largely constructed on exposed rock face, giving it a surreal, almost lunar, atmosphere. It is adjacent to the Saskatchewan town of Creighton.
Flin Flon experiences a humid continental climate. There is a wide range in seasonal temperatures, with warm summers and bitterly cold winters. Temperatures in January have an average low of −22.9 °C (−9.2 °F) and an average high of −14.7 °C (5.5 °F). Temperatures in July have an average high of 24.1 °C (75.4 °F) and an average low of 13.6 °C (56.5 °F).

The Hundred Stairs/Bomb shelter: In 1935, these stairs were built for pedestrians as a short cut to get to downtown from Third Avenue (located by Rotary Park).  These stairs were rebuilt in 1993. In 1947, a 140-meter tunnel was conceived to get pedestrians between Third Avenue and downtown (Main Street), Flin Flon, instead of walking up the Hundred Stairs.  The price tag for this endeavor would be $32,000.  The crew got within 4 meters of completing the tunnel when enthusiasm waned and the dimensions of the tunnel shrank to a point where it became a storm sewer outlet.  During the Cold War, citizens figured that if worse came to worse, they could hide in the tunnel.
Sewer Boxes: Flin Flon is the only city in the world to locate its sewage lines above the ground.  This is necessary in some areas of the city because of the masses of near-impenetrable bedrock.  Instead of burying the pipes, they are surrounded by a wooden casing and run above ground to create a unique snake-like appearance.  Early settlers built these above-ground sewer and water lines, becoming the settlement's first "sidewalks".  They are still used regularly today as fully usable sidewalks.
The North Park: The flowers in this park are entirely made from metal, representing all provinces and territories of Canada.
The Stack: The Flin Flon stack, at 250 m (825 ft.) tall, is the tallest free-standing structure in Western Canada.
Flinty's Submarine: This statue of fictional character Flintabaty Flonaton is featured on the submarine from the book The Sunless City.
