Westlock is a town of 5,100 people (2016) in North Central Alberta.


Understand[edit]
Westlock is located approximately 1 hour's drive north of Edmonton, and is located on the northern edge of the aspen parkland belt, a once heavily treed region that was cleared for agriculture at the turn of the 20th century. It lies just north of the continental divide between the Athabasca and North Saskatchewan river basins.  The area around Westlock is primarily agricultural, although there is some oil and gas activity, and is a service centre for the region.
Travellers heading from Edmonton to Northern Alberta will often pass through the Westlock area, arriving on Highway 2 near the neighbouring village of Clyde at an intersection locally known as Clyde Corner. A common route north is to take Highway 18 from Clyde to Westlock and continue north on Highway 44 where it rejoins Highway 2 near Smith.
