Shawnee is in the Frontier Country region of Oklahoma.
While normally not on the sight-seeing itinerary of those who do not know someone already living there, Shawnee could prove to be an interesting day trip.
Shawnee is known for its numerous Native American casinos, maybe lesser-so that it is where Brad Pitt and Jim Thorpe hailed from or the origin of Sonic restaurants.


Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Practically the only method of getting in or out of Shawnee is on the highway. Taxi cabs can be hired by calling a taxi service to have them pick you up, although doing so from another city could prove expensive.
There is an Enterprise Rent-a-Car in Shawnee and Shawnee Airport. Many visitors will rent at Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City.
Most traffic enters and exits Shawnee via Interstate Highway I-40, although State Highway 3 and US Highway 177 also pass through Shawnee.

By bus[edit]
Greyhound buses make daily stops in front of the American Colony motel on the far north side of Shawnee.
From there you will have to either call a taxi or arrange another form of pickup.

By train[edit]
Shawnee was established as a railroad hub, and still has many infrequently used rail tracks.

By plane[edit]
Chartered flights can fly you in to Shawnee airport, most likely originating from Oklahoma City or Tulsa. There are no commercial flight charter services based in Shawnee, so arrangements for your eventual pickup would have to be made as well.

On foot[edit]
While towns in Oklahoma are quite spread out, some have been known to hitchhike especially along I-40.  Not preferred.

Get around[edit]
If you are a tourist, getting around in Shawnee means either calling a taxi cab service to pick you up or using a rental car.
Shawnee is very, very spread out and you will quickly abandon any thoughts of walking if you ever want to get where you're going.

Shawnee's Twin Lakes[edit]
Shawnee's Twin Lakes offer enjoyable avocation and adventure to anyone who likes to experience the outdoors and water related leisure.
One lake is reserved for fishing and angling.
Its counterpart lake is for those who wish to swim or take part in non fishing related activities such as water skiing, jet skiing, or drinking. Consuming alcohol while fishing can be dangerous to yourself and those around you; it is strongly discouraged.
Due to pervasive droughts and low water levels, Shawnee Twin Lakes are often closed during the summer.

Casinos[edit]
Shawnee is surrounded by gaming establishments who advertise to be "just like Vegas". For smokers, these establishments offer the convenience of having their own smoke shops, which are not subject to local tobacco tax statutes.

Most places to eat are either on the northern edge of town along interstate highway I-40, sprinkled along Harrison and Kickapoo Street, or downtown on the south side of Shawnee.
Shawnee also has many pizza kitchens, although many of these are carry-out/delivery only.
