Aachen is a historically important city, spa and university centre in North Rhine-Westphalia, situated at the "three lands corner" where the borders of Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands meet. Known as Aix-la-Chapelle in French and Aken in Dutch, the city has played a prominent role in early Medieval Europe, when it became the favoured residence of Charlemagne, the first Holy Roman Emperor who created the Carolingian Empire in the late 8th and early 9th century and built the city's impressive cathedral, where he is now buried along with a succession of later German rulers, many of whom were also crowned in the city.
Apart from its medieval significance and a wealth of preserved artifacts, Aachen is also known for its springs, which have been attracting visitors since the Ancient Roman times and continue to do so today, with a number of historic baths and hotels sprinkled around the city. Contributing to the city's wealth and prominence is also the technical university, which made Aachen a hub for modern technologies and provides a sizeable student population (over 40,000 of the total 250,000 inhabitants in 2020). With all this, Aachen is now a multi-cultural, popular tourist destination.
Historically this spa-town was a prominent city, the place where the German Kings were crowned, and a famously favoured residence of Charlemagne who still lies buried in the impressive cathedral he himself had built. The city is packed with historic sights that remind of those days, including medieval buildings, city gates and beautiful fountains.

Understand[edit]
Aachen was the preferred residence of Charlemagne,  "Roman" Emperor from 800 to 814 AD and king of an empire covering much of modern-day Italy, France, Germany and the Benelux. Additional information can be found at the Route Charlemagne Aachen[dead link] website.
As Aachen is a legally recognised spa, it could call itself Bad Aachen, but refuses to do so, as it then would no longer be first in almost all alphabetical lists.
The city lies at the borders of Germany with Belgium and the Netherlands, forming the economic region called the Euregio Maas-Rhein. There are several Euregios in Europe, but regionally speaking just of "the Euregio" is understood to mean the one centred on Aachen.

By plane[edit]
Aachen shares its Maastricht-Aachen airport (MST IATA) with Maastricht. It is located some 40 km outside the city centre, in the Netherlands. Maastricht-Aachen airport is connected to only a limited number of international destinations and served by budget carriers. Transit to and from the airport via public transportation is only possible via the city of Maastricht.
The nearest major international airports are Düsseldorf (DUS IATA) and Cologne-Bonn (CGN IATA). Both airports can be reached by train (via the Düsseldorf and Cologne central stations respectively) or car in an hour. Another major airport within close proximity is Brussels (BRU IATA). It can be reached by train with a change either in Liège, Leuven/Louvain, or Brussels.
Smaller airports within reasonable distance are Weeze (NRN IATA) in Germany, Eindhoven airport (EIN IATA) in the Netherlands, and "Brussels" South Charleroi Airport (CRL IATA) in Belgium. All three airports are bases for low-cost airlines. They can be reached by car in roughly 1h30, or by lengthy train journeys with several changes. Also, Liège (Lüttich) airport ((LGG IATA in Belgium is 45min by car and has some charter flights. Finally, https://www.antwerp-airport.com/ (ANR IATA), also in Belgium, requires a 90-minute car ride. Aachen is probably unique in having 9 airports in 3 countries within 150 km.
If for some reason none of the nearby airports are feasible or affordable, the airport in Frankfurt (FRA IATA), Germany's main hub, has a direct ICE connection and offers a number of trains to Aachen with one interchange or less.
For some airports the rail&fly programme the German railways offer together with several airlines might be an option. For more on that see rail air alliances.

By train[edit]
Aachen central station (Hauptbahnhof)
50.7680056.0910141 Aachen Hauptbahnhof is the main railway station. Aachen has four other minor stations: Aachen Rothe Erde, Aachen Schanz, Aachen West and Aachen Eilendorf. In case of doubt, Aachen Hauptbahnhof is the most convenient station as it is served by all trains going to and through Aachen regardless of destination and it is closest to the city center.

Eurostar and ICE trains directly connect Aachen internationally with Liège, Brussels and Paris. ICE trains also provide direct connections every two hours from Frankfurt via Cologne, and daily connections from Berlin via Hanover and occasional connections to Hamburg.
Flixtrain serves the city.
There are also local trains from Liège every two hours.
Local trains (Regionalexpress) from Siegen via Cologne and Hamm via Düsseldorf run every half hour and take around 55 minutes from Cologne, 85 to 110 minutes from Düsseldorf.
Regional trains from Maastricht serve Aachen via Heerlen, Landgraaf and Herzogenrath (1 hr, €12.80)
Nightjet, the Austrian Railways' sleeper train, runs twice a week from Brussels via Aachen to Vienna, Munich and Innsbruck. It calls at Cologne, Bonn, Koblenz, Frankfurt airport, Würzburg and Nuremberg where the train divides: one portion runs via Linz to Vienna, the other via Munich to Innsbruck.
By bus[edit]
Aachen is connected by four bus operators for regional and long distance connections:

 Arriva from Maastricht and Heerlen. Bus line 350 from Maastricht serves Aachen every 15 minutes and passes through Margraten and Vaals (1 hr). Bus line 44 runs between Heerlen and Aachen (45 min, €5.80). Both lines call at various stops in Aachen including Aachen Hauptbahnhof. (updated Aug 2022)
 Flixbus. Flixbus operates several national and international bus connections. Coaches arrive at the stop at Henricistraße. (updated Aug 2022)

The buses call at three different locations depending on the operator:

By car[edit]
Being on major routes from the Netherlands and Belgium to Germany, easily reachable via the A4 and A44.
Parking in the town centre costs around €2 per hour. There is also park and ride[dead link] available around the outskirts of the town.
If you don't have your own vehicle, car-sharing is a possibility. Car-sharing is very common in Germany, but you should of course be cautious when booking a trip nonetheless. blablacar.de and mitfahrgelegenheit.de are good resources for finding rides to Aachen, although you're less likely to be successful if you're looking to book far in advance. Payment is expected.

By hitchhiking[edit]
There are several conventient possibilities to hitchhike to and from Aachen. More details and recommendations are available in the Aachen article at hitchwiki.

Get around[edit]
The old town is best explored on foot and orientation signs can be found all around. Apart from the centre, Aachen at a whole is a fairly large city.

By bus[edit]
Aachen has a city bus system, operated by ASEAG, including a few night bus lines. Most buses run to the central bus station 50.7769886.0899895 Bushof near the city centre. You can get tickets from the bus driver. On arrival in Aachen, it may be worth visiting the ASEAG Customer-Centre opposite the main bus station. Here, you can pick up timetables for all bus routes run by the company and you can of course speak to an adviser as well. There are no timetables available for services run by Veolia, such as the number 50 to Maastricht, or for bus services run by Deutsche Bahn, such as the number 66 to Monschau.

By train[edit]
Aachen does not have a tram, U-Bahn or S-Bahn network like many other large German cities. It is still possible to travel through the city by train. The euregio-Bahn is a local line that stops at the stations Aachen West (not far from RWTH Aachen University), Aachen-Schanz, Aachen Hauptbahnhof (the most convenient for the city centre) and Aachen-Rothe Erde. Ticket machines are available at all stations.

By car[edit]
The city centre is mostly blocked for car traffic. A car can come in handy in the outskirts. Parking can get expensive, especially in the center of town.

By bike[edit]
While being hilly and not the most biker-friendly town in Germany, there are a number of bike routes and getting around on bike is increasingly popular. As in other German cities, some bike thefts have been reported so reasonable caution is adviced. Bike parking with surveillance is possible in "fahrrad station", near the central train station. You can rent a bike at the "fahrrad station", near the central train station.

By e-scooter[edit]
Several e-scooter rental systems such as Tier and Voi are active in Aachen in a similar fashion to other German cities.

By taxi[edit]
Are readily available on the streets as well as on fixed locations, e.g. near Aachen Hauptbahnhof station, Aachen Rothe Erde station and in Pontstraße. The same conditions as in the rest of Germany apply.

Drink[edit]
There's no need to order your drinks at the bar when in Aachen - simply take a seat and a member of staff will come over to take your order. They'll write down what you've ordered on your coaster. When you've finished your drink, someone will soon come along and ask if you'd like to order another. When you're ready to pay, hand over your coaster to a member of staff. It's expected that you leave a small tip when paying; 5-10% is expected, typically by rounding up to the nearest Euro. You should make it clear you want to leave a tip before handing the money over by saying, for example, "I'll pay €8".

Aachen is one of Germany's safer cities on average, and the casual tourist does not have to worry whilst in Aachen. The city center is usually bustling with life, especially during the school year, though pickpockets can take advantage of people taking a drink. 
With that said, the areas immediately surrounding the main railway station (Hauptbahnhof) and the local bus station (Bushof) attract hordes of junkies. Furthermore, a lot of neighborhoods south of the city center can come off as sketchy if you are not accustomed to post-industrial towns. Most areas are usually fine.
As a border town, there is a certain amount of drug trafficking, but unless you are directly involved with this activity, you won't be affected.
