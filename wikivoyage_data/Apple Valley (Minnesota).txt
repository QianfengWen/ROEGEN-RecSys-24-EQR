Apple Valley, a relatively-modern suburban community at the southern edge of Minnesota's Twin Cities region, is far enough from the city to have plenty of open space to host parkland, a golf course and the state's expansive zoological gardens while remaining close enough to allow easy access to Minneapolis and its big-city amenities.


Understand[edit]
Apple Valley (population 56,000 in 2021) is an outer suburb located on the southern edge of the Twin Cities, south of Minneapolis-St. Paul's international airport and the Mall of America. The city was named for Apple Valley, California by developers who started building in then-rural Lebanon Township in 1969. The state of Minnesota constructed the 485-acre zoo in 1978.
