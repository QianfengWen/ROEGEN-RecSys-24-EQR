Sa Forcanera cove
Blanes is an old fishing town that has become an important beach destination on the Costa Brava and the province of Girona. In 2018 it had around 39,000 inhabitants.


Understand[edit]
It's mainly known because of its long city beach divided by the Sa Palomera rock. Other places of interest include botanical gardens, coves, such as the Cala Bona, and the Tordera river delta. It is also known for the international fireworks contest during the Santa Anna festival.
Its tourist attractions and good communications with Barcelona have transformed this old fishing and farming town into a small tourist-centered city that keeps its traditions on things like its vegetable and fish markets or the fish auction.

The climate in Blanes and the rest of Costa Brava is typically Mediterranean, mild and temperate, characterized by hot, dry summers, and moderately cold winters. The annual average temperature ranges from 7 to 28 °C.
From May to October the hot weather makes it suitable for sunbathing. Occasional rains can occur on May and October. As water warms up more slow than air, the best months for swimming and diving are July, August and September. August can be too hot and crowded.

History[edit]
Iberian activity has been attested in the area. Romanization of Blanes and its surroundings began around the 3rd century BC. During the Roman rule it was named Blanda or Blandae. Roman remains of the Blandae site lie nearby. After the rule of the Romans the area shared the fate of much of the Peninsula, being conquered successively by the Goths, the Moors and the Christians shortly after. In the 13th century, after the Christians regained the power, important architectural developments took place in Blanes. Some examples are the Cabrera palace, the Santa Maria's Church and the city walls.
In the 17th century, during the Catalan Revolt (Guerra dels Segadors), Blanes was practically burned to ashes. The Cabrera Palace was completely destroyed.
Another event that affected Blanes was the Spanish War of Succession (1701–1714). Afterwards, the reconstruction of the town and the expansion of agriculture started.
