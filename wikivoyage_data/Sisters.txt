Get around[edit]
Cycle: On several scenic highways which cross mountain passes from the Eugene and Salem area and lead to Redmond and Bend, the immediate Sisters area is relatively flat in a mountainous area, making for easy local cycling when there is no snow on the ground.  A bicycle or walking is perhaps the only reasonable way to travel during the rodeo and other tourist festivals when the out-of-town auto traffic effectively blocks the roads through town. Its mountain biking trails, include the Peterson Ridge Trail and Suttle Lake trails.
