Isla Holbox is an island in Quintana Roo, better known worldwide as the Mexican Caribbean.


Understand[edit]
Holbox Island, population 2,000, is 38 mi (61 km) north-west of Cancún, where the Caribbean Sea meets the Gulf of Mexico. It is part of the 154,000-km² Yum Balam ecological reserve. It is known in particular for its whale sharks. It used to be largely unknown to tourists; however, tourism in Holbox Island has boomed. This has also led to a rise in obnoxiously loud golf carts now roaming the once rather quiet island. While tourism may have grown, it remains a relatively off-the-beaten path location with plenty of local charm.

Get in[edit]
By ferry[edit]
Ferries depart from Chiquilá and take about 25-30 minutes. The ferries run from 6:00h to 21:30h every half hour. Where the "half-hour-times" are served from Holbox Express and the "whole-hour-times" are with 9hermanos (M$220 for both operators) (Aug 2023).
With two or more people you can charter a fisher's boat for the same price.

By car[edit]
From Cancún (follow signs on the road), take Hwy 180 (called Merida Libre) or Avenida José López Portillo, direction to Merida. Keep to the right when the road separates. At El Ideal, turn right to Kantunilkin, and you will arrive in Chiquilá, where the road ends.

By bus[edit]
There are three bus routes daily from Cancún to Chiquilá and back, on "Mayab" and "Oriente" buses run by ADO. They leave from the main Cancun ADO terminal and the price is M$350 per person as of August 2023. Check ADO's website for the current schedule. There are several busses around the day. They take around 2.5 - 3.5 Hours. On "Mayab" there is no luggage storage under the bus, and you'll need to take it aboard. The bus may or may not be full so there may be a chance to place your luggage in an empty seat, however, that is not always guaranteed. 
From Mérida you can take a night bus at 23:30, arriving in Chiquilá at 05:30, passing Valladolid around 02:30. If you prefer traveling during the day, you can take a bus from Mérida or Valladolid to Tizimín and change there to a bus to Chiquilá.

By charter plane[edit]

Get around[edit]

The island of Holbox is very small and there are no paved roads, only sandy paths. There are very few cars on the island and most people get around by walking, bicycle, or golf cart. 
One can also get around Holbox by taking the local taxi service, which consists exclusively of a fleet of four-wheelers. The taxis can be found on the beach and in the town during peak hours of the day (10:00-18:00). Taxis can be very limited in the early hours of the morning and late at night.
