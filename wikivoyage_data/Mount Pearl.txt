Mount Pearl is the second largest city in Newfoundland and Labrador, with a population of over 23,000 (2016).  The city is a twin sister to the provincial capital St. John's, and has grown from a playground for the summering rich into a thriving city.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Mount Pearl dates back to 1829, when Commander James Pearl and his wife, Lady Anne Pearl, arrived in Newfoundland with a Crown grant of 1000 acres (4 km²) of land, a reward for Commander Pearl's 27 years of distinguished service in the Royal Navy. In 1830, Commander Pearl built a house upon the most elevated section of his estate and named it Mount Cochrane in honour of then-governor Sir Thomas Cochrane. After the governor left Newfoundland, Pearl renamed the site Mount Pearl.
In the 1930s and 1940s, Mount Pearl became the meeting place of affluent members of society and lovers of horseracing. A large open air gallery, with benches for spectators to view surrounding lands was erected on "The Mount" in the 1940s. Horseracing continued to be prominent and Mount Pearl began to develop into something of a summer resort for St. John’s residents. Increased population during summer months led to increased population year round and eventual residential and industrial development.
