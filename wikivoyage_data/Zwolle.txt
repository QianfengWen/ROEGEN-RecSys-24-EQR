The Dutch city of Zwolle is home to some 120,000 people and, although second in size to Enschede, it serves as the province capital of Overijssel. It is known as a "green city" for its many parks and the municipality's efforts to maintain them through sustainable activities. Zwolle is surrounded by different rivers and lies at a meeting point of different ecological zones. For visitors, its well-kept town centre is one of the main attractions, with an abundance of historic buildings and a pleasant city atmosphere.


Understand[edit]
The Wijndragerstoren is one of the remaining towers of the city's defence walls
The area where Zwolle lies has been inhabited since the Neolithic times, for which proof was found in the form of archeological artifacts and a (Bronze time) timber circle which is colloquially called Zwolle's Woodhenge. In Roman times, Salian Franks lived here. The city as we know is first documented in the 11th century, but it was the 13th century city- and market rights that made the Zwolle grow. It became a member of the Hanseatic League and grew into a flourishing trade centre. There was strong competition with neighbouring Kampen.

Get in[edit]
Zwolle is an important transportation hub towards the Northern Netherlands, both for road and rail traffic.

By car[edit]
The A28 between Groningen (in the north) and Utrecht (in the middle of the country) passes right through the city. The part near Zwolle is one of the busiest roads outside the Randstad area. Although additional lanes have been created over the past years, traffic jams are still not uncommon during rush hour. Direct road connections via the A28 include those to Assen (45 min) and Groningen (60 min) to the north, and Harderwijk (30 min), Amersfoort (45 min) and Utrecht (60 min) to the south-west.
The A50 intersects with the A28 just a few kilometres out of town (intersection Hattemerbroek), providing easy connection to Apeldoorn (30min), Arnhem (45 min) and Eindhoven (85 min). From the intersection Hattemerbroek, this national road continues north-west as the N50 to Kampen and Emmeloord.

By train[edit]
Zwolle is a major rail transportation hub, and with trains running in 8 different directions from here, it's second only to the central station of Utrecht. The standard schedule sees eleven different trains arriving around the same time, twice per hour (around 15 and 45 min past the hour). This allows for a broad range of easy transfers. All southbound trains from Groningen and Leeuwarden stop in Zwolle, allowing for transfers from those lines to connections in all other directions. The station is served by fast intercity trains to large destinations, and by regional services to smaller towns. Important train connections passing through or ending in Zwolle include:

The intercity train from Rotterdam Centraal – Utrecht Centraal – Amersfoort – Zwolle – Groningen/Leeuwarden.
The intercity train from Den Haag Centraal – Schiphol – Lelystad Centrum – Zwolle – Groningen/Leeuwarden.
The intercity train from Roosendaal – Tilburg – 's-Hertogenbosch – Nijmegen – Arnhem – Zutphen – Deventer – Zwolle.
The intercity train from Vlissingen – Roosendaal – Dordrecht – Rotterdam Centraal – Den Haag Hollands Spoor – Schiphol – Amsterdam Centraal – Lelystad Centrum – Zwolle – Leeuwarden/Groningen
Other directly connected destinations via several regional Sprinter trains are Enschede, Almelo, Hengelo, Emmen and Kampen. Two direct Sprinter trains an hour run from Amsterdam Centraal via Almere and Lelystad, but the journey is around 30 minutes slower than picking up the Intercity from Amsterdam Zuid station.

Get around[edit]
52°30′44″N 6°5′36″EMap of Zwolle

The city centre is compact and in part car-free, so the best way to get around there is on foot. It's about a 10-minute walk from the train station to the centre.
To get to the outskirts of town or to see the surroundings, renting a bike is a good idea. You can rent one at Fietspoint Spruijt, the guarded bike parking at the train station. It's open early morning until late at night.
Although most visitors will remain mostly in the city centre, there are of course plenty of bus lines available to the different city district and surrounding towns. City buses are operated by Syntus. Regional bus connections are carried out by Syntus and OV Regio IJsselmond. There are two bus terminals, one on the east side of the train station, and one on the left. The division can be a bit confusing, but most of the city-bound buses leave from the west side, while most of the regional lines leave at the east side.

See[edit]
View of Zwolle, with the Peperbus tower
Most of the city's 14th-century defensive walls are gone, but a few parts remain. Especially in combination with the few surviving city gates, some towers and the canals, it's not too hard to get an impression of the extend of the fortified city from late Medieval times to the 17th-century Dutch Golden Age. This area, the historic city centre inside the canal ring, is the most charming part of town and holds a range of other old buildings.

52.5097226.0952781 Sassenpoort, Sassenstraat 51. Building of this city gate started in the late 14th century. Today, it's one of the city's main landmarks. It's built largely with natural stones and today it's owned and maintained by the national government. It's classified as a monument of extraordinary cultural-historical importance. The building is open to visitors. €5 adults.   (updated May 2022)
52.5136116.0988892 City wall ruins. Only small pieces of the former city walls can be seen today. The best place to see them is at the end of the Diezerstraat. Once, the Diezer tower stood here too. 
52.5119446.0902783 Basiliek van Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-ten-Hemelopneming and Peperbus tower, Ossenmarkt. This church was built in stages, with the first parts completed in the late 14th century. The final stage was the tower, which was constructed between 1454 en 1463 and is commonly known as the Peperbus, a nickname it gained from it's resemblance to a pepper pot. The church was granted the title of basilica upon its 600th anniversary in 1999. The 75-m-high tower is one of the main landmarks of the city and it's possible to climb the first part of the tower (236 stairs), to a height of 51 m, which allows for great views over town. Entrance to the basilica is free, climbing the tower costs €2.50 for adults and €1 for kids, including an information leaflet.  
52.5116676.0919444 Grote Kerk (Sint-Michaëlskerk), Grote Markt 18. This large church right on the central market was built in the 15th century and is dedicated to the archangel Michael. Already weakened by repeated lightning strikes, the tall church tower (the highest tower in the country at the time) collapsed in a 1682 storm. The church has Sunday services and is not open for visitors during the week.  
Parks[edit]
Famous as one of the country's "greenest" cities, Zwolle has no less than 33 parks on its city grounds. Many are small, but all are well-kept and where possible, sustainable and environmentally friendly measures are used for all necessary maintenance activities. A stroll or a summer pick-nick are excellent ways to get away from the city buzz. One or two of the parks contain historic graveyards, and most have some sort of playground for children.

52.509176.091395 Potgietersingel. This is one of the smallest parks (only 1.2 ha in size), but due to its location right in the city centre, it's one of the busiest. In summer, locals use the grass fields to enjoy the sun. The park was established in the 19th century, on top and around a part of the historic defence structures. It holds a number of large, old trees, a fountain and some flower beds.  
52.497786.068066 Engelse Werk (English Work). Creation of this park in English landscape garden style (hence the name) started in 1830. With a 36ha area, it's a rather large park. It's located at the south-west side of town, near the river IJssel. Before the 1800s, this place was part of the defensive structures and parts of the old ramparts can still be made out. The adjoining forest was planted in 1980, but now has a fairly natural feel to it.  
52.506676.113067 Park de Wezenlanden. This city park is the most visited of Zwolle's parks, but that's in part due to the event terrain that's located here. It's the scene of the city's annual Liberation Festival as well as a number of smaller events. This is a real city park, an area clearly dedicated to the outdoor needs of the locals. There's a basketball field, a fairly large skateboarding park, an adventure playground and more. The park is about 21 ha in size.
