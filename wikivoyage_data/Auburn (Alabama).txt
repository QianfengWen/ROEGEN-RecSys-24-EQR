Get around[edit]
Map of Auburn (Alabama)
By foot[edit]
Downtown Auburn is easily traversable on foot. The sidewalks and pedestrian crossings in and near downtown are heavily utilized by Auburn's student population which means that cars will often stop if they see a pedestrian waiting at a crosswalk.  However, the further one gets from downtown, the greater the distances become. Eventually, you will need to reconcile yourself to using a car or bicycle.
Areas outside of Downtown and north Auburn, especially areas along South College and Wire Road, lack sidewalks and pedestrian crossings and are not suitable for pedestrian traffic.

By bicycle[edit]
Bicycles are a common method of transportation in Auburn, allowing one to cover longer distances than when on foot. Most areas in Auburn can be reached by a short bike ride of any other point. Auburn was voted a "bicycle friendly city" by the league of American Bicyclists because of the city's bike plan, bike lanes, and advocacy efforts. Both the City of Auburn and Auburn University have established bicycle committees.
Auburn City Police will occasionally cite bicyclists for riding on the sidewalk. In Auburn (like the rest of the U.S.), bikes are considered traffic just like cars, though drivers will often ignore bicyclists. Be aware of your surroundings.
