New Plymouth is the largest city with an urban population of 58,000 (2021) in the Taranaki region, on the western coast of North Island in New Zealand, about midway between Auckland and Wellington, but well to the west. It lies on the coastal plains just to the north-west of Mount Taranaki (Egmont).


Understand[edit]
Paritutu Beach (Back Beach) is on the western coast of New Plymouth
New Plymouth is the main centre of the Taranaki region.
The area has enjoyed the benefits of oil, gas and petrochemical activity and some of the public facilities in the city reflect this relative prosperity.
Modernisation has begun in the CBD with many new eateries and bars opening up, including  boutique designer stores and artisanal producers.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
-39.008611174.1791671 New Plymouth Airport (NPL  IATA). It is on the coast 7 km to the north-east of the city at Bell Block. A shuttle is available to town for $25.   (updated Mar 2019)
Air New Zealand Link operates services from Auckland, Christchurch and Wellington, with 6–7 return flights daily to each, using 50-seat turboprop aircraft. On the rare days when Mount Taranaki is totally free of cloud, southbound flights can get spectacular views of the mountaintop.

By bus[edit]
National bus operator InterCity Coachlines provides daily services in and out of New Plymouth and the Taranaki region with connections throughout the North Island. Fares start from just $1 and can be purchased online or via numerous local agents including the i-SITE information network. Services arrive and depart from the main bus terminal at 19 Ariki St in the city centre.

By car[edit]
State Highway 3 passes through New Plymouth.
From the north (Auckland or Hamilton): State Highway 3 diverges from State Highway 1 at Hamilton and runs via Te Kuiti in the King Country and Waitara in Taranaki. New Plymouth is about 270 km from Hamilton and takes at least 3.5 hours by car, though allow 4.5 hours to be safe. A section of this road is narrow, winding, and includes a short single-lane tunnel. It is prone to closure by slips in bad weather.
From the south (Wellington and Palmerston North): Travel via State Highway 1 and/or State Highway 3 to Bulls then via State Highway 3 through Whanganui to Hawera, then inland via Stratford (which always has petrol 2c a litre cheaper than the standard price) and Inglewood. Wellington to New Plymouth is about 360 km and takes 4.5 - 5.5 hours non-stop, depending on traffic near Wellington; allow 6 - 7 hours including scenic and rest stops.
State Highway 45, The Surf Highway, which follows the coast (though seldom in sight of it) around the west of the mountain, via Opunake, is ~25 km longer and hillier, but scenic, alternative route from Hawera. Allow an extra half hour over travelling State Highway 3 direct.
State Highway 43, The Forgotten World Highway,  intersects State Highway 3 at Stratford. This can be an interesting alternative trip from the Central North Island via Taumarunui. The road winds and climbs for 160 km and includes about 30km unsealed though a spectacularly beautiful gorge.  It's worth stopping at the numerous historical information boards along the way. Allow 4-6 hours. (There is no petrol available between Stratford and Taumarunui and this highway section is difficult to maintain.)

By train[edit]
On rare occasions, a steam engine can be seen on the track. This most likely will be from the Waitara Railway Preservation Society, which runs the engine between Waitara and Lepperton.
