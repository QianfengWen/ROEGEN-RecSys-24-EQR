Understand[edit]
Las Tetas de Cayey
Cayey is located north of the Sierra de Cayey, an eastward branch of the Cordillera Central, the main mountain range that crosses Puerto Rico from west to east. Some of the highest peak in the Sierra, such as Cerro La Santa in the Carite State Forest, are within Cayey's borders. Cayey is most renowned through Puerto Rico for its lechoneras - these are food establishments that prepare and serve lechón (roasted pig).

Get in[edit]
San Juan: Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport
Aguadilla: Rafael Hernández Airport
Ponce: Mercedita Airport
By car[edit]
Expressway PR-52 and road PR-1 connect Cayey to Caguas and San Juan in the north and to Salinas and Ponce in the south.

Get around[edit]
The best way to get around is by car.
A word of caution: if driving you are sharing the road with trucks, and locals. The mountain roads have steep descents and ascents, hairpin turns, and steep cliff drops are not always protected by railing. Some roads may look like one-lane highways but are made to handle two-lane traffic.
