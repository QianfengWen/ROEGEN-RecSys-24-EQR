Bouzigues is a lovely coastal town in Hérault, southern France. It is known above all for its oyster production and numerous quality seafood restaurants. Bouzigues can be thought of as a seaside resort without the resort, with very limited accommodation, and not too many tourists. It is a perfect getaway for anyone who wants to enjoy a slower pace of life.


Understand[edit]
The waterfront. You can see the square tower of the church to the left.
Orientation[edit]
Bouzigues is on the north side of a large tidal salt water lagoon called the Étang de Thau, which extends 5 km south to the Mediterranean Sea. The sea water flows freely into the lagoon, fish and boats can come and go as they please, and the lagoon's shoreline is tidal. However, the étang is sheltered from the worst of the winter storms, and Bouzigues still enjoys the atmosphere of a traditional fishing port and the sunny and warm climate that draws so many to the south of France. The urban core is a dense medieval old town, with narrow streets and warmly pastel-coloured houses of two and three storeys, while further out are a few streets of modern villas. At the west end of the seafront are the shellfish industry's warehouses and stores, and at the other end, the cute little harbour. From here, you can gaze over miles of oyster beds across to the distant holiday complexes of Sète and Marseillan, while the Mediterranean scrub behind is scattered with vineyards and the odd olive grove.
The town's portentous title of oyster capital of France (capitale de l'huître) belies the fact that Bouzigues is for most of the day a small, sleepy community, with only around 1,700 residents. It only really comes alive just before lunchtime, when busloads of hungry travellers arrive to promenade up and down the waterfront in search of the perfect fruits de mer. Then, between 12:00 and 14:00, each restaurant is packed with people chowing down on oysters, mussels, razor-clams, prawns, sea bass and red mullet. Lunch service over, visitors gradually disperse, and Bouzigues drifts comfortably back into its peaceful ways. With the crowds gone, you can soak up sun on its two beautiful beaches, wander its shady medieval backstreets and keep track of the comings and goings of the marina - if not in solitude, at least with the feeling you are privy to a cleverly-guarded secret.

History[edit]




20 August 1944
Visitors will note the name of one of the streets which runs away from the port — rue du 20 août 1944. This was the site and date of one of the most dramatic moments in Bouzigues' history.
World War II was in full swing, the Allies had landed on both of France's coasts, and the Germans were on the run. There was a munitions factory on the quayside, which the Germans had determined to be tactically destroyed and abandoned. Unfortunately, as the soldiers were making the final preparations to leave, two local men were caught smuggling a stolen bomb out of the factory in a wheelbarrow. As punishment, they were taken as hostages and cruelly shut in the factory to be blown up with it.
The almighty explosion destroyed the entire quayside neighbourhood including several families' homes; boats moored in the harbour shattered and sank, while several passersby were injured and one killed. All this carnage is why the harbourside has modern buildings, while everything around is medieval.
As for the two hostages, they had a near-miraculous escape: the soldier responsible for imprisoning them neglected to lock the door of the factory. Whether this was a mistake, or a conscious and heroic act of mercy disobeying evil orders, is lost to the mists of time.


The name "Bouzigues" comes from the Occitan Bosigas, which means "fallow land" or "wasteland". Indeed, the area's early settlers seemed to live entirely from fishing and gathering wild fruits, and therefore did not need to cultivate their land. These fisherfolk were troglodytes - meaning they lived in caves hewn from the soft calcareous rock by winter and in tents by summer. Historians estimate the caves as being where the row of restaurants now stands on the seafront promenade, and indeed some of the buildings there are still troglodytic. Although cultivation wouldn't happen for centuries, oysters had been a major part of the local diet since the time of the Phoenicians, enjoyed alongside many of the same natural delicacies you can sample today.
The first vineyards were planted in the 15th century, but the bulk of Bouzigues' inhabitants remained fishermen. Nonetheless, by 1670, trade had increased to such a level that the town needed its own port rather than using that of Sète. The local baron, Timothée de Geoffroy, rented out a parcel of land to the town for the creation of a port, charging the generous rent of two hens per annum! The admittedly modest harbour was constructed as a whole town endeavour, with wealthier citizens providing building materials and the cattle to pull wagons and keep everyone fed, and the poorer inhabitants working as labourers. This port was sited not in the current location, but at what is now place du Général de Gaulle. The 21st century visitor will still notice the square is on two levels; the raised platform was the original quayside. The 100 metres or so of town to the south was reclaimed from the étang in 1820, and the port moved to its current site.
Surprisingly, oyster and mussel farming was only pioneered at the turn of the 20th century, and then only as a tentative, and at that time utterly unique, small-scale attempt for fishermen to have a more dependable catch. The only other way to get oysters, clams and coquilles Saint-Jacques was to dive up to eight metres below the surface, with no scuba gear of course. After the Second World War, the marine farming industry took off and most fishermen switched professions until the shellfish farms were at the scale you see today. The Bouzigues method of oyster and mussel culture, growing the shellfish on ropes suspended below the water, has since been copied all over the world.

Tourist information[edit]
The Musée de l'Étang de Thau has a small 43.446823.661581 tourist information centre with English spoken and plenty of brochures and discounts for attractions in the region, so make sure you pop in near the start of your visit. The main Office de Tourisme for the area is in Mèze, by the marina.

Get in[edit]
Bouzigues is located on the northern bank of the Étang de Thau, between the larger towns of Mèze (6 km) and Balaruc-les-Bains (8 km). Sète is 14 km away, while the regional capital Montpellier is around 30 km distant. The town is therefore within easy reach of other transport options, notably Sète which receives trains from all parts of France, as well as ferries from Morocco. Montpellier Méditerranée Airport (MPL IATA) is 35 km away; if driving, take the D66 from the airport up to the A709 autoroute, and merge onto that road following signs for Barcelona and Béziers. After a few minutes, you will pass through a toll gate and join the A9. Exit at junction 33 and follow signs for Bouzigues.

By car[edit]
The busy D613 is a local link road from junction 33 of the A9 autoroute, the main coastal motorway linking to Montpellier, Nîmes and beyond to the east and Béziers, Narbonne and other points south and west. Daytrippers should consider arriving early, as parking spaces are limited and fill up fast as midday approaches. The main 43.44683.60051 car park is free to use and serves the harbour and museum. On-street parking is possible, but not encouraged.

By campervan[edit]
There is a designated 43.4488743.6458872 campervan parking area on chemin de la Catonnière, just off the roundabout labelled Bouzigues - ouest. This is the third exit for Bouzigues when coming from the A9, or the first when coming from Mèze. This parking area is about 15 minutes' walk from the town centre.

By bus[edit]
The marina
Hérault Transport buses link Bouzigues several times a day to nearby towns and cities, and are excellent value for money with single fares as low as €1.60 for an adult, or €2.60 with a Montpellier tram ride included (Dec 2020). Two buses from Montpellier leave from suburban stations on the city's excellent tram network; the 603 leaves from Saint-Jean-de-Védas (tram line 2), and the 604 leaves from Sabines (also line 2). For Bouzigues, they stop at 43.4535623.6545123 La Clavade (by a roundabout on the main D613 bypass). The only pitfall is that this is around a 1 km walk outside of Bouzigues; the town is easy to find, but the distance is not really convenient for people with limited mobility.

By boat[edit]
With the étang being linked to the open sea at Sète and the start of the Canal du Midi at Marseillan, Bouzigues is a popular stopping point for touring boats, although like with parking, space is limited to about 10 of the typical boats used on the canal.

43.4468423.6607274 Harbour master (Capitainerie), ☏ +33 4 67 53 39 84. May–Sep 09:00–12:00, 14:30–19:00; Oct–Apr 09:00–12:00, 15:00–17:00). Upon arrival present yourself to the harbour master where you should pay port fees and taxes. 
By bike[edit]
While the direct railway line to Bouzigues is long gone, its route is not, and there is still a very high quality green way cycle track (voie verte piste cyclable) running parallel along the coast from Balaruc-les-Bains and Balaruc-le-Vieux, through Bouzigues, and then onwards to Loupian and Mèze. The track links to other routes at both its ends, so could feasibly be used as part of a bike tour of the wider area.

Get around[edit]
43°26′59″N 3°39′16″EMap of Bouzigues
Everything you'll want to see is within a short walk from the port, though some people prefer to discover the town on their bikes. Really though, the narrow alleys and winding streets of old Bouzigues and the picturesque seafront will entice even those stuffed to bursting with seafood to get up and explore.
If you wish to use Bouzigues as a base to tour the wider area, then you will ideally need access to your own wheels, as the bus services, while cheap and reasonably frequent, offer a fairly limited set of direct destinations (basically Mèze, Montpellier, and a handful of local villages). Driving and cycling are easy and popular ways to get around the Thau Basin.

See[edit]
Most of the enjoyment you will get from being in Bouzigues will just be down to mooching around the seafront, taking in the views, listening to the local chatter and smelling cooking fish and ozone mingling in the salty air.

43.4465243.6606921 Fishing port and marina (Port de pêche et port de plaisance), Quai du Port de pêche. The town's delightful little harbour should be the focus of your visit. Traditional wooden fishing boats are moored alongside flashier-looking yachts and all sorts of pleasurecraft. There are four different jetties to walk down, each with its own character and slightly different view. Take a wander past the colourful shack on the easternmost quay nearest the plage des Pyramides; you might see the boat repairman in his blue overalls pottering about on the various crafts under his care, not really working as such, but looking, listening, musing at what needs doing, and often pausing to greet passersby. (updated Dec 2020)
43.4468243.6616952 Musée de l'Étang de Thau, Quai du Port de Pêche, ☏ +33 4 67 78 33 57, musee.etang@agglopole.fr. Open Feb–Nov, generally Tu–Su 10:00–12:00 and 14:00–18:00, with some seasonal variation. Interesting museum all about life in and on the Étang de Thau in all its forms. The first part of the exhibition charts the history of the shellfish industry in Bouzigues from the 19th century to present, including many artefacts from fishermen past and present. If the subsequent aquarium of étang marine life, complete with cooking suggestions for each of the species displayed, seems a bit farcical, you will enjoy the third part of the visit much more. This is a rather in-depth look at the biology of the étang, with a focus on conservation and finding a balance which works for wildlife, the fishing industry and tourists equally. The museum is kid-friendly, and most of the information panels contain translations in English and German. Adults €5, children €3.50, under 8 years free.  (updated Dec 2020)
43.4478543.6589893 Old Bouzigues (From the Voile Blanche hotel, follow rue du Port past the town hall). Discover the pretty backstreets and squares of the old town, admiring the colourful buildings which press in on either side. Try not to miss the old 43.449383.6584924 communal well on chemin des Aiguilles, or the charming little 43.4481613.6575915 garden on the south side of the town church, rue Jean Jaurès. The 43.4482313.6573676 church (Église Saint-Jacques le Majeur, daily 10:00–19:00. Free.) merits a look inside, as it is the final resting place of the feudal lords of Bouzigues. Finally, if you're standing on 43.4471913.6588927 place du Général de Gaulle, and wondering why half of the square is 2 m higher than the other half, it is because this was the original harbour; where people and traffic now pass through was once underwaterǃ Take care on some of the narrower streets, as some drive their vehicles recklessly fast. (updated Dec 2020)
43.4533553.6579968 Ferme Zoo, 450 Chemin des Aiguilles (Walk from the town hall away from the sea along rue de la République for approx. 140 m, then at the crossroads take the pedestrian path (chemin des Aiguilles), passing the well on your R and the park on your L. After 450 m, keep going under the railway/cycle path bridge, then straight on for another 100 m or so.), ☏ +33 6 13 61 68 74, fermezoobouzigues34@hotmail.com. July-Augː Tu–Su 10ː00–19ː00; Sept-Junː W, Sa, Su, bank holidays 14ː00–18ː00. On rainy days, phone to verify opening. Cute little petting zoo that is home to all sorts of cuddly critters - goats, pigs, donkeys, deer, cows, emus, llamas - and their equally friendly keepers. Onsite, there are a picnic area and children's playground. Adults and children over 11 €6, children aged 2-11 €4, under 2 free. Free cup of feed for every child; additional cups €0.50. Cash only. (updated Dec 2020)
43.45193.65359 Musée du Sapeur-Pompier (Firefighters' Museum), Caserne de pompiers (Fire station), Z.A. de la Gare, Avenue Alfred Bouat, ☏ +33 4 67 18 45 15, csbouzigues1@orange.fr. Guided tours in French, upon arrangement. A hidden gem of an attraction run by volunteers who are themselves firefighters. The museum is home to a great many objects associated with the Pompiers (helmets, uniforms, fire engines) from 1780 to the present day. Free; donations welcome. (updated Dec 2020)
Do[edit]
La plagette on what passes for a busy day
Bouzigues has two small beaches:
43.4469173.6625531 Plage de la Pyramide (next to the museum and port, served by a small car park). A space has been cleared through the seaweed for swimming - stay between the floats. If you paddle softly enough, you will likely see fish basking in the warm shallows. Views over to Balaruc and Sète, and easy access to walks along the étang (see below). (updated Dec 2020)
43.4484273.6514862 Plagette (a few hundred metres W along avenue Louis Tudesq). This so-called "little beach" is ironically the slightly larger of the two. It has a net for volleyball, and the advantage of much less seaweed. Views over the oyster beds towards Mèze and, on a clear day, the Pyrenees. (updated Dec 2020)
Both beaches are officially dog-free as advertised by large signs, but France is a place where personal preference nearly always trumps official dictat, so don't be surprised to find yourself sharing the beach or even the water with family pets. Topless swimming and sunbathing is allowed and commonplace on both beaches, but full nudity is forbidden. There are no lifeguards, so you swim at your own risk.
 Voie Verte (start at the 43.4519013.654713 old railway station (where there is parking) if cycling, though walkers would be better off simply following the dirt track along the water's edge from the plage de la Pyramide, which misses out a rather dull bit through a modern housing estate). A former railway line turned cycle trail and footpath, links to Mèze in the west and Balaruc in the east across 12 km. The casual visitor will much prefer the route east out of Bouzigues, which runs very close to some gorgeous wetlands and mudflats, allowing you to spot the local birdlife. Hunting buzzards, graceful pink flamingos and various species of heron (grey and night herons, great and little egrets) are common, and the lucky may glimpse the blue flash of a passing kingfisher, or else catch sight of a red squirrel hurrying about its business. It is possible to go as far as Balaruc-les-Bains, but the route loses most of its charm after the large equestrian centre. (updated Dec 2020)
Explore the étang by boat[edit]
It couldn't be easier to get out onto the water. There is no fee to enter, navigate, or fish in the Étang de Thau, as it is legally part of the sea. A boat is a great vantage point from which to watch aquatic birdlife, and the pleasant climate and calm, sheltered waters make it a joy to explore. At an average depth of only 4 m, it is also a relatively safe and easy place to swim and snorkel off-shore.
There are, however, some important rules you need to follow, in order to help protect the étang's fragile environment and respect the livelihoods of those who depend on it. Just like on the road, there are maximum speeds which must be observed and areas which are off-limits. In general, the étang's speed limit is 25 knots (46 km/h; 29 mph), however within 300 m of the shoreline and 100 m of the shellfish farms, this is reduced to 5 knots (9.3 km/h; 5.8 mph). You may not pilot a boat into the shellfish farms; the only legal way to access the farms is to take a guided tour. Be mindful of your impact on nature: it is illegal to dump used water, chemicals, or human waste into the étang, and it is recommended that you carry any belongings in heavy bags or boxes, as plastic bags can all too easily blow away. Further information can be obtained from the local government's website.
Fishing is also heavily regulated: it is illegal to fish certain species, and for others there are quotas and minimum sizes. You must throw back any fish which exceed your personal quota or which are too small. The government has published a document (in French) detailing all of the laws, bylaws and recommendations which apply to marine fishing in Hérault. You must ensure you read and understand it, with the help of a translator if necessary, as ignorance of the law - even when there is a language barrier - is not a defence.

The mussel and oyster farms just off shore
43.4459113.6600964 Guided pleasure boat trips (Bateau-promenade Bleu Marin) (embark at the very end of the pleasure marina's main jetty), ☏ +33 6 03 31 44 90.

Hop aboard the Bleu Marin for a guided visit to the oyster and mussel beds, including a chance to see the shellfish at various stages of their life cycle as they grow on underwater ropes from larvae to harvest. The commentary is very comprehensive and peppered with banter, though unfortunately is only conducted in French. However, the chatty crew of two warmly welcome English-speaking passengers and provide sheets to read which give a rough summary of the commentary. Adults €12, children aged 3-16ː €8. (updated Dec 2020)
43.44953.66225 Hire a motor boat (Sinaué), 180 chemin du Mas d'Argent, ☏ +33 6 14 87 68 87. 1 May–30 June: M by appointment only, Tu–F 10:00–12:00/14:00–17:00, Sa Su 10:00–17:00; 1 July–31 Aug: M–F 10:30–12:30/13:30–18:00, Sa Su 10:00–18:00; 1 Sept–31 Oct Tu–Su 14:00–17:00, other times by appointment only. Environmentally-friendly and silent electric boats which you can rent without a permit, and take for a day's fishing, sightseeing or offshore swimming. The company train you in navigation and safety before letting you loose, and can recommend itineraries upon request. Wheelchair-accessible boat available by reservation. Contact the company to confirm operation and prices. (updated Dec 2020)
Events[edit]
For somewhere that only barely qualifies as a town, Bouzigues has a rather full events calendar. The complete list can be found, in French, on the municipal website, but here are the highlights:

 Bouzigues Carnival (Carnaval de Bouziges). 6 April 2019. A procession of costumed performers and floats accompanies the effigy of "Monsieur Carnaval" through the streets to the 43.4468913.6611486 belvedere above the harbour, where he is burnt at the setting of the sun. Join the townspeople for a costumed ball in the 43.4479363.6601687 Espace Fringadelle that same evening. Free. (updated Apr 2019)
 Flea markets (Brocantes de Bouzigues). 22 April, 10 June, 15 Aug 08:00–18:00. Three times a year, stalls selling furniture, linen and all sorts of trinkets turn up to line the seafront. Most of it may be worthless, if harmless, bric-a-brac, but you never know when you might stumble across a gem... Free. (updated Apr 2019)
 Feast of Saint Peter (Fête de Saint-Pierre). 30 June 2019. This festival of the patron saint of those lost at sea begins with mass in the parish church, and continues with a procession of local children dressed in traditional Languedocian costume to the harbour. Here, boats are blessed by the priest and a jet of water is fired in salute. At nightfall, a small boat on the harbour wall is ceremonially set on fire. Free. (updated Apr 2019)
 Bastille Day (Fête Nationale). 13–14 July 2019. Though national celebrations occur on 14 July, Bouzigues is typical of small towns in conducting its major festivities the evening before. Expect a torchlit procession, patriotic fireworks, and a public ball on the belvedere, with food, drinks, music and dancing, to last late into the night. Most people spend the 14th en famille, with some choosing to stay at home, perhaps tuning into the televised military parade in Paris, or else attending the regional celebrations in Montpellier. In Bouzigues, the town council puts on family-friendly games and activities at the port all afternoon. (updated Apr 2019)
 Feast of Saint James (Fête de Saint-Jacques). 26–28 July 2019. Celebrating Bouzigues' patron saint, the main event takes place on Sunday. The townspeople march to music from the town hall to the saint's namesake church. That evening, a funfair and the obligatory ball take place at the port. Free. (updated Apr 2019)
 Oyster Fair (Foire aux Huîtres) (Large parts of the town, notably the seafront, are pedestrianised for the duration. Temporary parking areas are provided at several entry points.), ☏ +33 4 67 43 66 40. 10–11 Aug 2019. Some 20,000 visitors descend on Bouzigues for an annual celebration of all things oyster. At the heart of things are the shellfish producers, whose delicacies you can sample in abundance, but also present are a multitude of other local food, wine and craft artisans. There are a number of events to keep you occupied, from 'best quality oyster' competitions, to tasting workshops, live music performances and fireworks on the Sunday evening. (updated Apr 2019)
Buy[edit]
A quiet backstreet
There is an ATM cashpoint, offering free withdrawals, on the wall of the 43.4470043.659412 Town Hall (mairie) on rue du Port.

Food and drink essentials[edit]
43.4479213.6589721 OC'API (minimarket), place Georges Clemenceau, ☏ +33 4 67 78 36 36. Daily 08:00–11:00, 15:00–18ː00. Fresh fruit and veg, small deli counter with meats and cheeses, regional produce, tinned goods, alcohol, beach items and other essentials (updated Apr 2019)
43.4479413.6579872 La Petrie Artisan Boulanger Pâtissier (bakery and cake shop), 12 Grand-Rue Étienne Portes (Ignore the entirely unhelpful directional signs. Follow rue de la République from the town hall right past place G. Clemenceau, after which take the first L, and then the L fork onto Grand-Rue immediately after. If all else fails, the locals are used to giving directions). Tu–Sa 07ː00–13ː00, 16ː30–19:30; Su 07ː00–13ː00, M closed. Great local bakery which makes excellent bread; try the aveyronnais rather than a baguette. Tasty but small selection of savoury snacks and sweet pâtisseries. On the down side, the viennoiseries (croissants et al.) are disappointing, and if you ever manage to raise a smile from the bloke behind the counter, you're a special person indeed. (updated Apr 2019)
43.4469113.6584013 Marché de Bouzigues (twice-weekly market), place de la Golette. Tu F mornings. Very small market (about four stalls) selling local produce. (updated Apr 2019)
For a proper market atmosphere, as well as two decent-sized supermarkets (Carrefour and Intermarché), go to Mèze.

Shellfish[edit]
There are about half a dozen shops where you can buy shellfish (coquillages) direct from producers. Expect to pay a slight premium for oysters, given they are what Bouzigues is known for. However, other shellfish are very reasonably priced, as are tielles sétoises, a local squid and tomato pie. Most of these shops are located on 43.448373.6472344 avenue Louis Tudesq, at the far end from the port; you will pass them on the way into town from the western D613 roundabout. There is also one shellfish shop on 43.4468523.6587235 place de la Golette.

Souvenirs[edit]
43.4475693.6573476 L'Atelier des Artisans (Les Savons de Bouzigues), 17 avenue Louis Tudesq, ☏ +33 4 30 72 64 03. Daily 10ː00–19ː00. Specialists in hand-made soaps and cosmetics, which the owner makes herself. Other craft products from local artisans also sold. (updated Apr 2019)
43.4472053.6583947 L'Elixir, rue de la Poterne, ☏ +33 4 67 78 75 98. Tu–F 07.00–12.30 and 15.00–19.30; Sa 07.30 –12.30 and 15.00–19.30 Su; 08.00–12.30. Tobacconist and newsagent which also sells some souvenirs and local wine (updated Apr 2019)

What to try[edit]
Oysters (huîtres) from Bouzigues are amazingly fresh and must be tried by every visitor! Squeeze a dash of lemon onto the flesh, then scoop it out with your teeny-tiny fork and swallow whole. Washed down with a glass of the local white (Picpoul de Pinet), this is just like tasting the sea.
Mussels (moules) are the other shellfish that is farmed in Bouzigues. Some of the restaurants serve them raw on a platter with oysters, but these are frankly not worth the bother unless you really want to try them. Much better are the classic moules marinières, or else moules farcies (stuffed with cheese, breadcrumbs and tomato) you can get at a few different restaurants.
Prawns (crevettes) in Bouzigues are fat and delicious, and are served shell-on - forget any notion of piddly little shrimps. There are few more satisfying food experiences than breaking into a prawn, dipping it in aioli, and devouring it whole.
Razor clams (couteaux) are uncommon on menus in the English-speaking world, which is odd because when cooked well they are divine: quite meaty, and a little bit squeaky when you chew them.
All of the above on one almighty seafood platter (plateau de fruits de mer), a typically-lavish offering served at many restaurants. Most are for sharing between two.
Tielle sétoise
Tielles sétoises are small pies filled with a sort of squid, tomato and red pepper paste, and are a speciality of Sète.
Bourride à la sétoise is an alioli-based orange-coloured fish soup which normally uses a white fish such as anglerfish (baudroie) with carrots, onion, potatoes and herbs.
Restaurants[edit]
There are many restaurants lining the front, and all seem to be of a very high standard, so the below list is by no means supposed to be comprehensive. If you are eating at dusk, try to get a table facing west; the sunsets over the étang can be spectacular whilst you're tucking into your meal.
Vegetarians, you're out of luck. Bouzigues is unfortunately typical of rural France in that none of the restaurants have proper vegetarian menus, and most don't even have the odd meat- or fish-free dish. The nearest vegetarian restaurant is La Part des Anges in Sète, but Montpellier has a much wider selection.

Tired of French food? You'll have to head into Sète for Moroccan, Chinese and Indian offerings, or Mèze, where you'll find a decent Vietnamese place on avenue de Montpellier (the main D613 road from Bouzigues). Other than that, the city of Montpellier's dining scene is considerably more cosmopolitan.

Drink[edit]
The local white wine, Picpoul de Pinet, is lush with seafood or as an apéritif. Black label (étiquette noire) Picpoul is fruitier and sweeter, while white label (étiquette blanche) is drier and smoother. There are many vineyards open to the public for buying and tasting Picpoul and other local wines in the triangle of land between Mèze, Marseillan and Pézenas, though of course all of the local shops and supermarkets stock most of the good Languedoc wines, and some of the bad ones.
Aside from food, Bouzigues is no place for nightlife. There is only one bar in town, not counting those in the hotels listed below:

43.4474763.6592991 Le Globe, 18 rue de la République, ☏ +33 4 67 78 32 69. Every day 07ː00–22ː00. Sports bar that also serves coffee. Mostly frequented by locals. Free wifi and friendly landlady. (updated Apr 2019)
Sleep[edit]

There are not a great many accommodation options in Bouzigues, which is one of the reasons it's nice and quiet. As well as what's listed below, there are a handful of self-catering gîtes and tiny B&Bs (chambres d'hôtes) scattered around the place.

Go next[edit]
Time to move on: flamingos in flight over the étang
Loupian - Bouzigues' attractive inland neighbour is an interesting village worth an hour of wandering. Most travellers visit the Gallo-Roman villa, which has some truly exceptional mosaics, but miss out Loupian itself; don't be like most travellers. Drive or catch the bus (104).
Mèze - more or less a larger version of Bouzigues, with a great market on Sundays and Thursdays, a very pleasant harbour and large sandy beach. Drive or catch the bus (103).
Sète - nearby large town with an interesting port area, a good regional art museum and links to the musician Georges Brassens. Drive.
Montpellier - unmissable city with a youthful buzz and cosmopolitan energy that Bouzigues just hasn't got. Drive or catch the bus (103 or 104 to tram stop, then tram L2 into city centre. Ask the bus driver to include the tram fare in the ticket; it doesn't cost any different to buying them separately, but it saves on time at the other end.)
Nîmes - some wonderfully-preserved Roman ruins, including a monumental amphitheatre still in use. Drive or catch the train from Sète (TER is cheaper than TGV).
