Downtown as viewed from the observation deck of The Pier (closed in 2013).
Saint Petersburg sits at the base of the Tampa Bay peninsula in Pinellas County, Florida, and enjoys a more subdued social atmosphere than its larger cousin, Tampa. The city has tried to characterize the downtown as an arts and entertainments destination and you will find no shortage of arts and crafts stores, galleries, & museums along with cafes and boutique food shops all within a couple blocks of the Tampa Bay waterfront. With water on three sides of the city, St. Pete is a superb location for fishing, sailing, and wandering beaches.

History[edit]
The "Snell Arcade" building houses some of the shops and restaurants that line Central Avenue in downtown St. Petersburg.
Saint Petersburg was founded by John C. Williams from Detroit, Michigan, who purchased the land in 1876. The town began with the help of Peter Demens, who was instrumental in bringing a railroad connection there in 1888. Saint Petersburg was named after the Saint Petersburg in Russia, the birthplace of Peter Demens. A local legend says that John C. Williams and Peter Demens flipped a coin to see who would have the honor of naming the city. Peter Demens won and named the city after his birthplace, while John C. Williams named the first hotel after his birthplace, Detroit. The Detroit Hotel still exists downtown, but it was converted into condos in 2002.

Stay safe[edit]
Statistically, Saint Petersburg is a safe community.  Like any city, there are parts to avoid, but the majority of St. Pete is a modern city full of nice people and hospitable places.   Cities that are tourist attractions are also attractions to those that prey on tourists.

Cope[edit]
The weather is warm year round here with highs typically in the 60s and 70s (°F) in the winter and 80s and 90s in the summer.  Summers are very hot and humid.  Sometimes when it rains in St. Pete, it literally pours!
The hurricane season runs through summer and fall with the peak of the season in September.  It has been many years since St. Pete has been directly hit by a hurricane.
Being on a peninsula, the city is surrounded on three sides by water.  There are also three very long bridges that access the area, the Sunshine Skyway rises to a height of 17 stories above the Tampa Bay.  The Howard Frankland Bridge and the Gandy Bridge are much lower rise as bridges grow.  If a person fears long bridges, they should be prepared to deal with this aspect of the area.

Newspapers[edit]
 Tampa Bay Times. Main newspaper for the region.   (updated Jul 2023)
 St. Pete Catalyst. St. Pete specific paper, somewhat business oriented.  (updated Jul 2023)
 The Current. Student-run newspaper of local college.  (updated Jul 2023)
Go next[edit]
The port of Tampa is the launchpoint of Caribbean and other cruises. The port is now limited to smaller (relatively speaking) cruise ships since many of the largest vessels on the Caribbean cannot navigate under the Sunshine Skyway Bridge (approximately 17 stories high) to enter the bay.
St. Petersburg is about 90 minutes west from Orlando and the various theme parks near Orlando like Disney World and Universal Studios. Three hours northeast from St. Petersburg is Daytona Beach and Cape Canaveral.
