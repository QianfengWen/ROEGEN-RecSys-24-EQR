Hongdo (홍도, 紅島) is a small (6.5 km2) island 115 km off the coast in South Jeolla Province, South Korea.


Understand[edit]
Hondo Town
Lying 115km west of Mokpo in the Yellow Sea, Hongdo Island is of the most remote locations in South Korea. Hongdo (meaning 'Red Island') was declared part of the Dadohae Marine National Park in 1981, and is regarded as a national monument of Korea. Most of the island is off limits to visitors, although a tour around the island by sea is the best way to see it. It has a small population of about 700 people, most of whom are involved in the fishing industry.

Get around[edit]
Because of restrictions walking through the national park, access to the 34.707099125.2008142 second village (somewhat disappointingly just called Hongdo 2-gil) on the island must be by boat.

See[edit]
The many rocks around the island
 Walking paths. Although the national park is off limits, you may walk around on carefully designated paths. 
Do[edit]
 Sightseeing boat trip. A boat trip that takes180 minutes to get around the 21km of coastline and countless interesting rock formations (assuming you like that sort of thing) 
 Beach. Hongdo town does in fact boast its own beach 
Buy[edit]
Due to the small population here, you are probably best off purchasing essentials in Mokpo before your journey to this island.
Some travelers have reported that their credit cards do not work on the island. Considering the long journey time back to Mokpo on the mainland it is probably wise to bring some extra cash with you just in case.

Eat[edit]
Dried fish on Hongdo
Hongdo is able to provide many restaurants selling fresh fish for a fraction of prices that you will find on the mainland.

Drink[edit]
Locals enjoy drinking beer and soju with their fresh fish in the evening.
