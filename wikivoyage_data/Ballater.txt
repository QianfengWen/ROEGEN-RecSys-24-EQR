Attractions are scattered, you need a car or at least a bike.

See[edit]
57.039722-3.2313891 Balmoral Castle, Balmoral Estates, Ballater AB35 5T (off A93 midway between Ballater and Braemar). April-July: daily 10AM-5PM, occasional guided tours in winter. Prince Albert, Queen Victoria's husband, bought this land and built a grandiloquent pile of a castle, the prototype of the "Scottish Baronial" style, all mock-turrets and stags heads looming over the stairways. Completed in 1856, it remains the Royal Family's summer holiday home. You can only visit one room within the castle, the ballroom, plus an exhibition in the stables, and the gardens. The queen is usually resident in Aug and Sept, so there is no access then. See website for dates of guided tours in winter. Adult £11.50.   (updated Nov 2018)
See Banchory for Crathes Castle and other nearby attractions.
57.2207-2.998792 Glenbuchat Castle, Strathdon AB36 8TN, ☏ +44 7713 627190. Roofless but substantial ruin of a Z-plan tower house built in 1590 for John Gordon of Cairnborrow, possibly by re-cycling stone from Kildrummy.

57.1628-3.23423 Corgarff Castle, Strathdon AB36 8YP. Apr-Sep: daily 9:30AM-5PM. Mid-16th-century tower house castle with reconstructed 1750 redcoat barracks. Adult £6.   (updated Aug 2018)
57.204-3.0714 Strathdon or Bellabeg is a village on A944 where the main sight is the Doune of Invernochty, a set of earthworks and foundations for a 12th-century castle. It's just southwest of village centre and free to stroll. The lane up the valley northwest leads to the little settlement of Lost, which for obvious reasons can't be shown on the map.

"2090" means in feet, it's only 645 metres altitude at base, with the hills above rising to 775 m. So do the maths, it's a beginners' and family-oriented resort.

There are mountain bike trails here in summer. (updated Nov 2018)
