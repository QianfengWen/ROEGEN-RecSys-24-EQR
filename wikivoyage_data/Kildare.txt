Kildare is a town in County Kildare 50 km southwest of Dublin, and part of the city's commuter belt. It's best known for its cathedral, and for its thoroughbred stud farm. Although it shares its name with the county, it's not the county town, which is Naas. In 2016 Kildare had a population of 8600.
Newbridge is another commuter town, 5 km east across the plain of The Curragh. The bridge in question is over the Liffey, which halts its westward course to make a broad U-turn and head east into Dublin. Newbridge grew rapidly in the 19th century as a garrison and industrial town, and in 2016 had a population of 23,000. Officially known by its Irish name of An Droichead Nua, it's the largest town in the county and its visitor facilities are also described here. 
Kilcullen is the third of the towns grouped around The Curragh. It has motorway links but no railway so it hasn't burgeoned like the others, and in 2016 had a population of 3500.  


Understand[edit]
Brigid was a Celtic goddess cloaked in glittering legends. Her many powers, attributes and miracles particularly centred on fire, and on fertility of plants, farm beasts and humankind. St Brigid (451-525; in Irish Naomh Bríd) is said to have founded an abbey at Kildare in 480, and in hagiographies she strongly resembled the pagan Brigid: clearly the old folk tales were Christianised and grafted onto her. And somebody established an early religious centre here, so we may as well credit St Brigid. She's said to have founded it by an oak tree, hence Cill Dara or "Church of the Oak." She wouldn't need to look very far, as in her days the western lowlands of Europe were carpeted in oak forests, and daire or -derry is a common placename element.

See[edit]
53.1572-6.90911 Kildare Castle. It survives only as a single tower next to Market Square, best viewed by strolling into the car park of the Silken Thomas pub. It was built by the Normans in the 12th century, and much bashed in the Gaelic resurgence of the 13th and 14th centuries. Little is known of its later history, but the surviving tower was probably a gatehouse converted into a fortified dwelling in the 15th century.   (updated Jul 2021)
53.157875-6.9113982 St Brigid's Cathedral, Market Square. Church of Ireland (Anglican) cathedral dating to 1223, though largely re-built from 1875. St Brigid (451-525) is said to have founded a church on this site in 480 AD. Myths and legends associated with the pagan Celtic goddess Brigid have been transferred to her, with many more accumulating in later centuries (see the example below), and her supposed date of death 1 Feb is the Celtic festival of Imbolc. The Round Tower a few steps northwest is almost 33 m tall: in the 1780s its conical cap was replaced by castellations. Its Romanesque doorway is 12th century but the tower may be 200 years older, and you can climb it for a small fee. "St Brigid's Kitchen" is the name given to a 14th-century burial vault in the grounds, and there's the remnants of a High Cross. Another structure is said to be an ancient "fire temple": St Brigid is altogether unlikely to have been Zoroastrian, but in the 6th century, woe betide anyone who let the community's main fire go out. Round tower adult €4, child €2.   (updated Jul 2021)
53.153104-6.9141893 Grey Abbey  500 m south of town centre is just a few tumbledown walls in an old cemetery. It was founded in 1260 for the Franciscans.
53.159444-6.9167154 White Abbey (Carmelite Friary Church). M-Sa 10AM-3PM, Su 10AM-1:30PM. Nothing remains of the Carmelite friary of 1290. Its white-robed friars survived Dissolution and the Penal Laws and built a church on the same site in the 1750s. That was replaced by the present Puginesque-Gothic church in 1884, still in use. Free.   (updated Jul 2021)
Black Abbey, just to ensure you collect the full set, is on Tully Road by the National Stud. Set in an old graveyard, it's a sturdy tower built 13th / 14th century for the Knights Hospitaller of St John, who wore black robes. There's no interior access but you see enough over the low hedge.
53.144582-6.9016035 Irish National Stud & Gardens, Tully Road R51 KX25, ☏ +353 45 521 617. Feb-Nov: daily 10AM-6PM. This farm was bought in 1900 by Colonel William Hall Walker, of Johnny Walker whisky, and he built up the stud business. Walker also developed the Japanese gardens here, and in 1916 he donated his entire bloodstock to the government to form a National Stud. After independence the British component was at Newmarket, England, but in 1943 the Irish equivalent was set up here. Half a dozen prize stallions stand ever-ready to service any beast you bring along. In 1999 St Fiacre's Gardens were added, and the grounds also include the Black Abbey, see above. Adult €14, conc €11, child €8.  (updated Jul 2021)
Japanese Gardens at the National Stud
53.143-6.9076 St Brigid's Well, off Tully Road. 24 hr. This is a "clooty well": you dip a piece of clothing in the blessed waters, rub the afflicted part, then pin the clothing to the rag tree. The affliction will fade along with the sacrificial rag. Free. (updated Jul 2021)
The Curragh is the flat grassy plain east of Kildare. Sand deposited by glacial meltwater has given it good drainage, so it's long been common grazing land for livestock (though pigs have been forbidden since 1299), for horse racing, and for parading and exercising troops. The first permanent military camp was built in 1856 for the Crimea Wars - until then the barracks were in Newbridge, with just tents out on the plain. Nearby were the camp followers or "Wrens", first recorded from 1840, a group of some 60 women in makeshift shelters. Some were in irregular partnerships with soldiers and therefore not allowed to live in married quarters in camp, others were sex workers. Curragh Camp is now Ireland's largest defence establishment, with some 2000 personnel. The M7 bisects Curragh plain with the camp south and the racecourse north.
53.15-6.8047 Donnelly's Hollow on R413 east of the plain is an obelisk celebrating the prizefighter Dan Donnelly (1788-1820), who had notable victories at this spot. This was bare-knuckle fighting, before boxing was codified. Post-mortem, his formidable right arm embarked on a remarkable solo career. An urban myth grew up that his arms stretched to his knees, but they were in proportion to his 6 foot / 183 cm stature.
53.184-6.8468 Pollardstown Fen is a wetland nature reserve and Ramsar site. Ireland is notoriously boggy but this place is unusual is being fed by calcareous springs from the aquifer beneath the plain. It's been compromised and whittled down by drainage over the centuries, including in 2003 by construction of the M7, but you can stroll along a boardwalk over what remains.
53.275-6.9469 Lullymore has a Heritage Park and the Bog of Allen Nature Centre.

And did those feet in ancient times? 
St Brigid's successor was St Durlagdach, who as a young nun lodged with Brigid, but one night she snuck out to tryst with a soldier lad. But then she got cold feet: "I know, I'll fill my shoes with burning coals, that should save me from temptation." This done, she traipsed back to the convent like a van with a dirty exhaust. Brigid not only proved a miraculous chiropodist but assured Durlagdach that she was now safe from the flame of impurity and the fire of hell. And they wonder why the Irish have suffered so many serious accidents through smoking in bed.
