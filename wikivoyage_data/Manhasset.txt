Stay safe[edit]
Manhasset is generally a very safe place to visit at all times of the day and night. There is an area called Spinney Hill (by Whitney Pond Park off Community Drive) which consists of two of the North Hempstead Housing Authority's public housing projects (Spinney Hill Homes and Pond View Homes). Despite the stories associated with housing projects generally-speaking, this area is not very dangerous and is of little interest to a tourist (although the former Manhasset Valley School, which is now a community center, is a beautiful old building with an interesting history), and the Nassau County Police Department's 6th Precinct headquarters is located just down the street.  
The one place in the hamlet where one should exercise just a teeny-weeny bit of extra caution is at the Travelodge on Northern Boulevard. Any local can tell you that this establishment is notorious for housing sex offenders and for being the location of drug deals every once-in-a-while during the overnight hours. Regardless of this, the area remains very safe, the cops are always in the area and on the case, and there is a great Chinese restaurant right next to the hotel; Pearl East is always packed for dinner.  
Just as you would anywhere else in the United States, in an emergency, dial 911.  

Stay healthy[edit]
Manhasset is home to North Shore University Hospital, which is one of the best hospitals on Long Island, in New York, and in the United States, as a whole.
