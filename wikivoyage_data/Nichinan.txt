From Kagoshima (Kagoshima-Chuo Station), take the Nippo Line to Minamiyamazaki Station where you can transfer to the Nichinan Line. From Kitakyushu, there are Limited Express Trains to Miyazaki via Oita where you can transfer.

Get around[edit]
The historic castle town and related sites are located within walking distance of Obi Station, but the city limits cover a wide area leaving most places, including the famous Udo Shrine, far from any stations. Buses can be used to access many of these locations, but a car will give you the greatest mobility.
