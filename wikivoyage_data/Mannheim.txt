Mannheim is a city in the northwest corner of the state of Baden-Württemberg in Germany, at the confluence of the Rhine and Neckar rivers. It is close to Ludwigshafen. Modern Mannheim is the second biggest city in Baden-Württemberg and one of the hotspots of immigration. Because of that you'll encounter a lively and colourful mixture of nationalities and cultures in the city. In 2020, it was home to about 310,000 people.


Understand[edit]
Wasserturm (water tower)
Mannheim was a small fishing village before it became a city at the beginning of the 17th century. It was constructed on the site of a fortress guarding the confluence of the rivers Rhine and Neckar. Even now, a few remnants of the fortification can be seen, and the peculiar street layout owes to that part of its history. For 58 years, Mannheim served as a royal residence, and gave Schiller, Lessing, Goethe and Mozart a home for some time. Before World War II, Mannheim was a beautiful city, but it was flattened in bomb raids due to its industrial significance. When it was time to rebuild the city, Mannheim, like many other German cities, opted for an all out modern approach to urban development. Thus, most of the old quarters were replaced by buildings typical of the 1950s. If you are not an adept to architecture, their appeal might not be easy to grasp. As a result, the impression is more of an industrial city with a few spots of beauty.

Mannheim also has a small local airport, the 49.47258.5141671 Mannheim City Airport (MHG  IATA). This airport is connected to Berlin Tegel and Hamburg up to twice a day (weekdays) by Rhein-Neckar-Air with small Turboprops, but their fares are pretty high. In the summer there are even flights to Sylt.   

By train[edit]
Mannheim is a regional transport hub with ICE, IC and regional trains all stopping in 49.4797188.4698242 Mannheim Hauptbahnhof. There are direct connections to and from many major German Cities, including Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, international destinations are Basel, Innsbruck, Salzburg, Paris and Marseille (via Strasbourg and Lyon). There are three CityNightline (CNL) trains crossing Mannheim, connecting it to Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Milano and Prague overnight. However, arrival and departure times for night trains can be in the middle of the night as Mannheim lies along the line and not on either terminus and onward connections can be scarce or nonexistent.

The 49.4782128.4726243 bus station (ZOB) is at Heinrich-von-Stephan-Str, near the Main Station (Hauptbahnhof). Mannheim is served by Flixbus.

Get around[edit]
The centre of Mannheim is laid out like a chess board, with no real street names. Addresses in the Quadrat take the form of a grid reference, such as Q3, 12 designating a block. The streets are not named:r "Q3" refers to the block.  If you follow a street from Q3, you might end up at either Q2 or P3.  It is best to navigate by "following" the blocks rather than the streets.  If you get lost, a rather high probability, ask a local.  They are used to it.
The public transportation system  is quite extensive. Bus routes cover Mannheim, and the tram system connects Mannheim to Ludwigshafen across the river, Heidelberg a few minutes away, and Weinheim, in addition to major routes across and through the city. Local/Regional Trains of the S-Bahn Rhein-Neckar connect Mannheim and the surrounding cities and countryside. As of 2018, the automatic ticket machines only accept coins, not notes or cards.

Eat[edit]
Spaghettieis
Spaghettieis was invented in Mannheim in 1969. Vanilla ice cream is pressed through a spaetzle press, creating the spaghetti-like shape, over which comes strawberry sauce as tomato sauce and grated white chocolate as grated cheese.
Mannheim is known for its many pretzel stands. Little pretzel baguettes with mozzarella and tomato are quite yum.
The Döner is a kind of Turkish kebab found throughout Germany and is definitely worth trying! One of the most popular Döner stalls is located right across the train station, called City Döner (see below). It is very common to have a Döner there after partying.
Mannheim is famous for its big Turkish community, so these restaurants offer a variety of different and traditional Turkish dishes, not limited to Döner Kebab. Definitely a part of Mannheim's food culture. There are many more Turkish restaurants and shops in the area west of Marktplatz. Therefore some refer to the area as "Little Istanbul".
Sunday morning buns. Get fresh buns for breakfast even on Sunday morning at G1 (Marktplatz). Backfactory and another bakery on the other side of the tram tracks are open on Sundays.

Stay safe[edit]
Most parts of Mannheim are safe, but there are a couple of districts that have higher crime rates (compared to other German cities; compared to non-European cities the whole of Mannheim is super safe). Examples are Vogelstang, Neckarstadt-West, Jungbusch (night) and some others. Street crime and violence, however, are very rare, so you will be perfectly ok if you simply use your common sense. In particular, it is not dangerous at all to visit the pubs and clubs of the Jungbusch or the Neckarstadt.
