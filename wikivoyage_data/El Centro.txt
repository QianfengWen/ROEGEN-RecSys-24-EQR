El Centro is the largest city in Imperial County in California. Its name is Spanish for "the center".


Understand[edit]
El Centro is the largest American city to lie entirely below sea level. In fact, at an average of 50 feet below sea level, it boasts one of the lowest elevations in the continental United States. From the I-8 freeway, passers-by can spot a line painted on a water tower proudly marking the negative elevation.  Founded in 1906, El Centro holds the county seat for the Imperial County.  Primarily a farming community, the area produces much of the state's winter vegetables including lettuce, onions, carrots, and tomatoes; in addition to cotton, alfalfa, and other produce.  El Centro also has numerous cattle feed lots.  The residing community of slightly over 40,000 people is primarily Hispanic and is significantly comprised of an agricultural migrant labor force.  Apart from agriculture, two nearby prisons and the U.S. Border Patrol provide much of the area's employment.
The motto of the El Centro Chamber of Commerce is "Where the Sun Spends the Winter" - but the sun spends the summer here as well, with temperatures regularly exceeding 115°F.  During the summer months, most residents understandably prefer spending their time indoors and generally only venture out for recreational reasons in the early morning or late evening.  In the fall, winter, and spring, however, the climate is more moderate and much more pleasant.
While considered a "desert" community, El Centro is in fact surrounded by agricultural fields.  The water used for irrigation, all of which originates from the Colorado River, contributes to the high humidity within the area- particularly in the summer months.  Most tourism in the area is either business related or in the form of stopovers on the East-West bound Interstate 8; although there are "snowbirds" from Canada and other parts of the Northern United States who vacation here during the winter.  The nearby sand dunes and desert areas offer many recreational opportunities to hundreds of thousands of people annually and have also served as the filming location for numerous Hollywood films including the Star Wars series, Jarhead, the Scorpion King, Stargate and Into the Wild.  El Centro's proximity to Mexico allows for easy cross-border visits.
The nearby Naval Air Facility due west of the city is the winter home to the Blue Angels, and is a dry-land practice area for Navy pilots.

By car[edit]
 Kumeyaay Hwy passes through from San Diego (120 miles west) and from Yuma (60 miles east). El Centro is accessed from Exits 111 (Forrester Rd) to 120 (Hwy 111).
 from  State Route (SR)-78 from Carlsbad at I-5 through Escondido (Jct ), Julian and Borrego Springs to Blythe (through Glamis) is an option if you are coming from the north. It intersects SR-111 in Hovley, 18.5 mi (29.8 km) north of El Centro along SR-111.
 &  from  Two major roads parallel each other from Indio on opposite sides of the Salton Sea. Hwy 86 goes along the western shores of the Salton Sea while SR-111 goes along the eastern shores of the Salton Sea. Hwy 86 provides a faster route to/from I-10 east of Indio (85 mi (137 km) north) than SR-111 which goes through Indio (92 mi (148 km) north of El Centro). SR-86 goes through town as 4th St while SR-111 bypasses town along the eastside through Anza. SR-86 (E Herber Rd) ends at its intersection with Hwy 111 south of town, south of the I-8 junction. Calexico is another (15 mi (24 km) southeast) of El Centro and the I-8 junction (Exit 115 of I-8).
By plane[edit]
32.8355-115.57241 Imperial County Airport (IPL IATA) Southern Airways Express is the only airline to offer commercial flights from Los Angeles International Airport. The airport is mostly used for general aviation.
It may be cheaper to fly into San Diego International Airport (SAN IATA) and then rent a car there or take a Greyhound bus to El Centro. From Mexico the nearest airport for commercial flights is in Mexicali (MXL IATA)

By bus[edit]

Get around[edit]
Driving is by far the preferred method of travel while in the Imperial Valley, and particularly within the city of El Centro.  The local transportation cooperative, Imperial Valley Transit, has routes connecting all cities in Imperial County. You can purchase punch cards at City Hall.  However, because of there are few buses, you may need to wait a few hours at some stops if you want to travel by bus.  Public transportation isn't very good, and it's even worse for spur-of-the-moment outings because it may be two hours before a bus comes.  In addition, it may be a long distance between the stop and your destination.  If you don't have a punch card, you should have exact change ready.  Route and fare information is on the company's website.
For local transportation if you're within the city of El Centro and without a car, taxis are preferable to the bus.  Rates are reasonable and because of the close proximity of most places in town, a one-way ride will generally be under $7.  El Centro Cab at +1 760-352-7600, City Cab at +1 760-337-8570, and Yellow Cab at +1 760-352-3100 are three taxi options.
Walking is not a good option because of extremely high temperatures during the summer months.

See[edit]
Farming in the El Centro region
Drive by the local agricultural fields and cattle feedlots to observe first-hand what your food is like, how it is grown and processed, and where it comes from before it arrives at your table.  Find an asparagus field and listen to it grow!  If you can, find a local farmer who can show you the sights or speak with a local resident who can tell you what life in El Centro is really like.

 Fishing. El Centro is one of those rare inland destinations where you can angle for fresh water fish without necessarily doing so in a body of water. Impressively sized catfish and small striped bass can be found within the miles and miles of irrigation canals used for agricultural purposes which run alongside many of El Centro's country roads. In addition to the canals, fishing hotspots include Sunbeam Lake, the Sunbeam Lagoon, the Central Main Canal, the Fig Lagoon and the Sperber Reservoir. 
 Frog-Gigging. With no seasonal designation or limit on bullfrogs, catching them downstream of drainage ditches, at the Imperial Wetlands or alongside country roads is easy with a light, spear, gig, paddle or your hands. Lightly battered frog legs cooked in clarified butter and served with cold slaw and french fries is a local delicacy in many homes.

Eat[edit]
The food in El Centro tends to be inexpensive, high in calories, and primarily Mexican. The local population serves as evidence of this as rates of obesity and diabetes in the area are well above the national average. The city's main thoroughfare, Imperial Avenue, is dotted with the typical fast-food restaurants you'll find in any city; however, there are a few local restaurants that are worth visiting. Be sure to try a "special quesadilla" at one of the local eateries if the opportunity presents itself. This deep fried treat is said to have been invented locally. Carne-asada burritos are also a staple of the local diet.

32.780641-115.553031 Antojitos Como En Casa, 425 Desert Gardens Dr (Off the west corner of 4th Street and Desert Gardens Drive), ☏ +1 760-482-5621. With hand-crafted Mexican cuisine typical of that of Central Mexico, this small establishment offers an assortment of dishes you will find no where else locally. A worthy stop if you're a "foody" or just enjoy new culinary experiences. (updated Jul 2017)

 Puerto Nuevo, 215 N Imperial Ave (on the corner of Broadway and Imperial Avenue), ☏ +1 760-352-2757. This restaurant specializes in Mexican seafood dishes. The shrimp cocktails and ceviche are highly recommended and are comparable to what you'll find across the border in Mexicali, but without the drive. 
 Mexicali Tacos, 2003 S 4th St, ☏ +1 760-353-4505. Mexican food served fast. Any of the burritos on the menu are worth a stop. 
 R&B Cyber Service, 1535 W. Adams, ☏ +1 760-353-7400. Not a restaurant, but an Internet Cafe where there is always a computer available for use. The place is run down and a bit of a dive, but you can surf the Internet in air-conditioned comfort, have a drink, or even have your computer repaired.

32.793241-115.5775354 Grasso's Italian Restaurant, 1902 West Main St, ☏ +1 760-352-4635. Try the Pollock Pizza (named after the owner), or the tomatoes-and-sweet-onions when they're in season. Open Wednesday-Sunday in the evenings. The place is a bit run-down and the sparse wine list leaves much to be desired; nevertheless, the food is hand-crafted and there is a "back room" which is less formal and better suited if you're dining with kids. Call to make a reservation if you want to be sure you'll get a table due to the popularity of the place. (updated Jul 2017)

Burgers & Beer There are two El Centro locations: one at 260 North Imperial Avenue (760-353-4431) and one at the Imperial Valley Mall (760-353-0007). This is a popular local place. Although they serve mainly American style food such as hamburgers and french fries, there are some Mexican items on the menu as well. In addition, there is a large selection of brews found no where else locally- some of which are on tap. With televisions mainly showing sports in every corner and small televisions which you can control at most of the booths, you'll find it difficult not to watch what's on TV while enjoying your food.
 Lucky Chinese Restaurant, 500 South 4th St, ☏ +1 760-352-7680. It's best to reserve a table if you're going at noon or on Sunday because it can get very busy.

With numerous combination plates for around $5, the food you order is freshly prepared in large woks right within your view.

Sleep[edit]
Because El Centro isn't a popular tourist destination, good hotel rooms are cheap and easy to find. Reservations are not necessary. Rates range from $50–60 a night. Some hotels around Adams Avenue are even cheaper, but these hotels are rather seedy and not in the most desirable parts of town.

Stay safe[edit]
El Centro is a relatively safe city. However, it's best to avoid areas east of 4th Street and north of Adams Avenue after dark. These areas are often filled with desperate characters and there isn't very much to see there anyway.  Main Street near 4th Street and North 5th Street are also best avoided after dark as drug-related crime in these areas has been on the rise.  In addition, the area of Adams Avenue should also be avoided late at night as this is home to most of the city's prostitutes.  Nevertheless, in most other areas of the city and despite the fact there is an average of only three police cars patrolling the entire city at any one time, it is generally safe to walk around at any hour of the day or night.
Car doors should always be locked as theft is common – largely due to the desperation of the impoverished and unemployed.  El Centro's unemployment rate typically hovers around 30% and is consistently among the highest in the nation.
Summers in El Centro are notoriously hot. It's common for temperatures to reach over 120 °F (49 °C) in July and August. If you're not used to this sort of heat, it's best to stay indoors, avoid being outside, wear sunscreen, and stay hydrated. Even some locals still get heatstroke. The heat can be deadly. If you're going to rent a car, make sure it has a fully-functioning AC.
Like other areas in California, El Centro commonly experiences earthquakes. Most of these are so minor (registering less than a 2.5 on the Richter Scale) you may not even feel them. Because of strict building regulations, most buildings are built to withstand major earthquakes. Major earthquakes are not common, so it should not be a concern.

Respect[edit]
Avoid bringing up the topic of illegal immigration. El Centro is overwhelmingly Hispanic and most people are either immigrants or the children of immigrants. Illegal immigration and immigration in general can be a sensitive subject.
People with gang affiliations have moved into the area from Los Angeles, Salinas, and other cities due to the lower cost of living.  Avoid staring at anyone you think might be affiliated with a gang as he or she might construe your unintentional look as "mad-dogging", which could provoke an altercation.
Many of El Centro's residents are employed by one of the area's two penitentiaries, the U.S. Border Patrol or other law enforcement, and may carry concealed firearms.  It's best to mind your own business despite the friendly nature of many local residents.
