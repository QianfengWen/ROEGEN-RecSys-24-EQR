The former village of Bristol is located on the Saint John River,  approximately 5 km north of Florenceville.

History[edit]
The Old Church Studio
The settlement of Buttermilk Creek was renamed Florenceville in 1855 to honour Florence Nightingale, the famous Crimean War nurse.  
Bristol was the site of a battle between Mi'kmaq and Maliseet peoples. The Maliseet called the area Shiktehawk", for "where he killed him". The name was changed when the New Brunswick Railway was constructed and railway officials were unable to pronounce the name correctly. Bristol sits where the Big Shiktehawk and Little Shiktehawk Streams empty into the Saint John River. This was an important stopping point for First Nations (Indigenous) peoples as it was the start of the cross-province route. They would canoe up the Big Shiktehawk Stream to Divide where they would portage a short distance to the Miramichi River and make their way to the eastern coast of New Brunswick.

Climate[edit]
The town gets a fair amount of precipitation, although major paralyzing snow and rain storms such as blizzards and hurricanes are uncommon but do happen on occasion. Snowfall is common between late November and early April, and snow usually stays on the ground beginning in December. Flooding occurs during the spring of most years and affects the low-lying areas of Florenceville-Bristol.
