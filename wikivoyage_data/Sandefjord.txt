Sandefjord is a small town in Vestfold in Norway. It has a notable history.


Understand[edit]
The whalers' monument
Sandefjord is a historical town which has become a modern town of culture with a dynamic business life, and a popular holiday destination with Norwegians. The history of Sandefjord has been formed by the Viking Age, the shipping industry and whaling in Arctic and Antarctic areas.
The Vikings had their first settlements in Vestfold, and the Gokstad Viking ship dating from the year 900 was discovered in Sandefjord. Today one can find a replica of this ship (the "Gaia“) at the harbour. Like the Vikings, the urge to go abroad and explore foreign parts of the world led the first whalers to the Antarctic Ocean. The history of the whalers can be explored at the Whaling Museum and at the Museum's Wharf with a visit aboard the whale-catcher "Southern Actor.“
