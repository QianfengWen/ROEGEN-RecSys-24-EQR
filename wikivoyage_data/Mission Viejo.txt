Mission Viejo is a town in Saddleback Valley, a region of Orange County, California.


Understand[edit]
Mission Viejo is about half way between Los Angeles and San Diego and is the best American embodiment of planned suburbia.  Six-lane wide avenues and endless subdivisions of single-family houses surrounding pockets of strip malls are the norm.
The proper name in Spanish should be Misión Vieja, as 'mission' is a feminine noun.  The masculine gender of "viejo" is a vestige from the original name of the area, "Rancho Mission Viejo"; "viejo" modified "rancho", a masculine noun. In light of the history of the area, the masculine adjective was preserved. The "Mission" of "Mission Viejo" is Mission San Juan Capistrano; Mission Viejo was a community of San Juan Capistrano until it became an independent city in 1988.
