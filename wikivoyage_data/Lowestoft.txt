Lowestoft is a coastal town in Suffolk, UK.


Understand[edit]
Lowestoft beach
Once a bustling fishing port, Lowestoft is now a small quiet town on the east coast of Britain. It houses not much but is a big tourist destination due to its huge beach which runs all the way down to Pakefield. Lowestoft also had a famous composer, Benjamin Britten, who died in the Red House in Aldeburgh in 1976.

Get in[edit]
By road[edit]
If coming from the south, the A12 London-Great Yarmouth road passes right through the town. Past Ipswich much of the road is single-carriageway and can become congested during summer holidays and weekends so allow 3–4 hours driving time from London. A- and B-roads link Lowestoft to most other locations in Suffolk and Norfolk.

By train[edit]
52.47421.74981 Railway Station, Denmark Rd, Lowestoft, NR32 2EG. The UK's most easterly railway station is in the centre of town, just north of the river. It is the terminus of 2 lines. Services from Norwich run every hour (M-Sa) and take around 30–45 minutes. The service is every two hours on Su. There is also an hourly service from Ipswich] (M-Sa). It takes around 90 minutes to arrive from Ipswich.   (updated Apr 2017)
By bus[edit]
All buses terminate at the town centre bus station. There's no direct service from Ipswich and the most useful bus is the hourly express coach from Peterborough via Norwich and Great Yarmouth. Getting to Great Yarmouth by train is very indirect and requires a change at Norwich so it's much quicker to take the bus.

 National Express. Twice daily service from London Victoria Coach Station (4hr 20min - 4hr 55min, from £25). (updated Dec 2018)

Drink[edit]
Harbour Inn
The Lowestoft town centre is fairly run down and that includes the pubs and bars. Your best bet is to head down to Oulton Broad which is a five-minute taxi ride away or catch the train there. Oulton Broad has really become the main place for bars and pubs in Lowestoft with many modern bars such as Winelodge, Broadview and Bridges open, the place is usually heaving during the weekend and can be busy in the week. There is also a new nightclub called Escape by Winelodge.
If you do choose to stay in Lowestoft your best bet is the pubs by the bridge with The Harbour, Notley, Iconic and Winelodge all close to each other although these tend to be very quiet during the week and only tend to get busy on Fridays and Saturdays and even then they can be quiet.
