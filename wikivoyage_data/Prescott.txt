Prescott is a city in Arizona, and the county seat of Yavapai County. It is home to the world's oldest rodeo, and to the famous Whiskey Row


Understand[edit]
Prescott (pronounced "PRES-kut") was the first (and third) Territorial Capital before Phoenix was chosen as the final site. Prescott, unlike much of Arizona, has clear seasonal changes and is very temperate. Warm summers, cold winters, and a monsoon season that generally starts at the beginning of July and lasts until September. Its elevation is 5,368 feet (1,636 m), which is about the same as Denver.

A couple of shuttle companies also make multiple daily trips between Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX IATA) and Prescott.

By shuttle[edit]

Get around[edit]
Prescott Dial-a-Ride[dead link] offers round-the-clock dial-a-ride service within the Prescott area for a fare of $3 cover plus $2.25 per mile, with discounts for seniors.
If staying in downtown Prescott, it's fairly easy to see the most important parts of the town on foot. However, Prescott also has a lot of taxi services, in large part due to the presence of Whiskey Row.
For those with a more adventurous side, ATV rentals are available near downtown. Scooters, bicycles, golf carts, and other conveyances are also available for those who'd like to get around a little more quickly.
