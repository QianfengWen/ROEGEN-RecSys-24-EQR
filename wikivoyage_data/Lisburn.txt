Lisburn is a market town traditionally in County Antrim north of the River Lagan; a small part lies south of the river in County Down. The counties have been abolished in Northern Ireland so since 2015 it's been in the "super-district" of Lisburn and Castlereagh. It's best known as the seat of linen manufacture in Ireland; but it's also notorious as the site of the former Long Kesh or Maze prison. With a population of 45,370 in 2011, Lisburn was officially dubbed a "city" in 2002 but this is just ceremonial. Not only does it continue to feel like a town, but "city" hereabouts means the metropolis of Belfast 9 miles north; so a town is how it's described on this page.  
Mystery cloaks Lisburn's Irish name of Lios na gCearrbhach, which means "ring-fort of the gamblers". Excavations have not revealed whether the gambling resembled Texas hold 'em, Craps, or a version of the Three Card Trick using megaliths. 
The Visitor Information Centre is on The Square next to the bus station, open M-Sa 9AM-5:30PM.


Understand[edit]
Louis Crommelin built up the linen industry throughout Ireland
Linen is a textile produced from flax. It was produced at least 30,000 years ago from wild flax, and since 9000 years ago from a domesticated species Linum usitatissimum, which became cultivated throughout the Old World. Linen is strong and absorbent, pleasantly cool to the touch, and can be given a lustrous shine. So it's made into garments and bedding, though it's tricky to work and production is laborious. By the Middle Ages flax was grown and processed in Ireland but the leading centres were along the lower Rhine, in what is now Germany, Netherlands and Belgium. In 1685 the Edict of Fontainebleau revoked religious tolerance of French Protestants, which they had enjoyed since the 1598 Edict of Nantes. This led to the flight of the Protestants (called Huguenots) to Britain and Ireland. They included many skilled weavers and brought with them improved methods of production. Notable among them was Louis Crommelin (1652-1727), who settled in Lisburn and built up the linen industry throughout Ireland; he's buried in the cathedral graveyard. Production scaled up from rural craft through cottage industry to large mills, and Victorian Lisburn was "Linenopolis" much as Manchester was "Cottonopolis" and Dundee was "Juteopolis." (See also Banbridge for early mill automation, which paved the way for computers and robots.) In the 20th century trade withered with cheap foreign imports and the development of artificial fibres. Linen lost its mass market but continued to be used for upmarket tailoring, and Irish linen nowadays uses imported flax.

See[edit]
54.511176-6.0434081 Irish Linen Centre & Lisburn Museum, Market Square BT28 1AG, ☏ +44 28 9266 3377. M-Sa 9:30AM-5PM. Linen was central to Northern Ireland's early industrial revolution, before the focus changed to metal-bashing. This museum is in the late 17th century market house where wares were traded. Free. (updated Sep 2020)
Christ Church Cathedral is on Castle St 100 yards east of the Linen Centre. It's Church of Ireland and completed in 1719 on the site of earlier churches that burned down.
Castle Gardens are a bosky green space on the north river bank. Nothing remains of the castle, a Plantation-era mansion.
Wallace Park is the larger, more open green space a couple of blocks north, 200 yards east of the railway station. The ring-fort (the one with the gamblers) was north side of the park, but the only sign of it now is the street name Fort Hill.
54.489-6.1042 Long Kesh, 3 miles west of Lisburn, is a bizarre illustration of the best and worst of Northern Ireland. It's a former RAF base, in use 1940-47 mainly as an aircraft assembly plant. Long Kesh along with other wartime bases in this region enabled the RAF to operate out in the Atlantic beyond the range of planes based in Great Britain, to protect Allied convoys and attack U-boats.
- Ulster Aviation Society has a museum with some 40 heritage aircraft. Enter via Gate 3, east side off Halftown Road.
- Maze Prison or "H-Blocks" began in 1971 as Long Kesh Detention Centre. In a dawn raid the British arrested 342 suspected paramilitary terrorists, and "interned" them - detained them without trial in Nissen huts on the disused airfield. The arrests were solely of supposed IRA members, with no action against loyalists; they let slip many republicans while incarcerating others with no IRA involvement; they practiced interrogation techniques little different from torture, and systematically abused the detainees. To official surprise, this didn't end terrorism in Ulster but sparked an escalation of violence. Internment without trial ended in 1975, and a permanent prison HMP Maze was built. It was named for the nearby village of Maze not for fiendish security, but it became known as H-blocks for the plan of its cells. Those held protested that they were political prisoners not criminals, and refused prison discipline. Protests included "the blanket" (refusing to wear prison garb), smearing the cells with excrement, and hunger strikes, with Bobby Sands and nine others starving themselves to death. In 1983 there was a mass escape of 38 prisoners, and 19 were never recaptured. But over the following years there was less paramilitary violence, the regime at the Maze stabilised, and it closed in 2000. Various grand plans for redevelopment of the site have so far come to little. So you can gaze through the fencing and the buddleia; that's close enough.
- Eikon is an exhibition centre on the east of the site, enter by Halftown Road. Balmoral Park showgrounds are also here.
See 54.462-6.0833 Hillsborough for the attractive village and castle four miles southwest of Lisburn.
