Fermont is a mining town located in the regional county municipality of Caniapiscau in the northern part of the Côte-Nord region of Quebec. This municipality includes Mont-Wright, an iron ore extraction sector, as well as Monts Severson (altitude: 840 m).
Its infrastructure makes it unique, including the "Wall", a long building serving as a screen against the north winds. It is a popular destination for hunting and fishing, as well as organized sports and recreation. Formerly isolated, with no access road, this northern town is increasingly accessible thanks to Route 389 linking Baie-Comeau to Labrador-City.
In 2021, it was home to about 2250 people. 


Understand[edit]
Fermont
Along with its neighbouring towns Wabush and Labrador City in Labrador, Fermont is part of the Labrador Trough. The Mont-Wright sector has a vast mining centre from which iron ore is extracted, hence the name Fermont. The city stands out for its main building, Place Daviault, commonly known as "Le Mur". It brings together the main businesses and services of the city in addition to housing a good number of housing units. It includes a grocery store, a post office, primary and secondary schools, a hotel and various sports facilities. The building is 1.5 km (0.93 mi) long and 50 m (160 ft) high. Its nickname is not accidental, because the building actually serves as a wall protecting the city against strong winds from the north. It also aims to allow its residents to participate in a living environment integrating a range of activities and services without having to leave the building in winter. In addition to this legendary screen wall, the city has many single and row houses in the area south and southwest of the screen wall. The village covers a tip of the northern part of Lake Daviault.
