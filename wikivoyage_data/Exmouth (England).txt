Exmouth Seafront, looking toward the Exe estuary
Exmouth is a seaside town in East Devon. Exmouth is Devon's oldest seaside resort and has a two mile long golden, sandy beach fronting the channel which attracts visitors and locals all year round. At the eastern end of the beach is the start of the Jurassic Coast, England's first natural World Heritage Site. The seafront is renowned for its fascinating rock pools, bird life and stunning views across the Exe Estuary.


Understand[edit]
Sitting where where the Exe Estuary joins the sea, Exmouth has a wide range of facilities and a wonderful collection of independent shops, beautiful gardens, and superb entertainment. With a wide variety of places to stay, eat, and drink, Exmouth has gradually established a reputation as a fantastic place to enjoy watersports, sailing, cycling, fishing, walking, eating out and the many special occasions the town has to offer. There is a full calendar of events such as the Medieval Christmas Cracker and the New Years Eve fancy dress celebrations, which were voted one of the UK's top destinations in which to celebrate, and Exmouth Arts Festival (end of May) which has developed from a rich arts scene. Another regular occasion is the Velo Vintage cycle parade; an eccentric affair, complete with penny farthings, tweed and theatrical, handlebar moustaches!
The town centre's piazza-style Strand Gardens, which have undergone a £3-million makeover, is the ideal place to watch the world go by. Once the sun has gone down you can watch the light display around the war memorial as you enjoy a coffee or cocktail al fresco in the café quarter. Exmouth has also benefited from the completion of the South West Coast Path, Exe Cycle Trail and an explosion of water sports, from waterskiing to kite surfing, body-boarding and sailing (Steph Bridge, five times world champion Kite Surfer, is a resident). 
The town is surrounded by the wooded, rolling hills of Woodbury Common and is a fantastic base to explore this part of Devon's countryside and coast with many charming, quaint towns and villages nearby.

Exmouth's town centre is rather small, so it's easy to travel on foot. Exmouth Cycle Hire rents bicycles and cycling equipment, so there is the option of cycling along the South West Coast Path that runs along the coast and connects Exmouth to Topsham to the west and Budleigh Salterton to the east, or along the Exe Estuary Trail which carries on from Topsham around the coast to Dawlish.
The Exmouth Land Train runs from 5 May to 28 October each year, from 10AM to 4PM, and is a fun way to get around Exmouth, with the train's route following a circuit alongside the beach and through the town centre.

Do[edit]
Exmouth is a popular tourist destination due to its long, sandy beach.  However, swimming is forbidden on a short stretch of the beach due to fast tidal currents.
A modest range of tourist attractions are open during the summer season, including a small boating lake, miniature golf course, model railway and amusements arcade.
Exmouth is one end of a long and pleasant coastal walk along the cliffs to Budleigh Salterton. The walk contains steep segments, though, and includes rough ground and stiles, so is not recommended for the frail.
Boat trips: Stuart Line Cruises based at the ferry pier explore the Jurassic Coast.
