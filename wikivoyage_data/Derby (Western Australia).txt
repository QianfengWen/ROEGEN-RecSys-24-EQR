Derby is a town in the  Kimberley Region of Western Australia, best known for its giant "prison" Boab tree. It's on the north coast on an inlet of King Sound, and in 2016 had a population of 3325, half of them Aboriginal. You might stop off here on the long, long highway into Northern Territory, or for fishing. The town has no decent beach and limited other attractions - if you're a mud crab you don't want to read about these.

The bus terminus in Derby is outside the Visitor Centre, northwest end of town on Loch Street.

See[edit]
-17.3493123.671 Boab Prison Tree stands at the entrance to town. It's a 1500-year-old hollow Boab (Adansonia gregorii) with a girth of 14.7 m. It was used by the Aboriginals as an ossuary, but in spite of the legend was never used as a jail, though the Boab near  Wyndham was. The real jail is 500 m southeast.
Frosty's Pool on the highway by the Boab turn-off is a rusting swimming pool, built in 1944 by Corporal Frost and a couple of mates. Hard to see how a Guardsman would ever fit in it.
-17.3565123.6992 Mowanjum Culture Centre, Gibb River Road, ☏ +61 8 9191 1008. Tu 9AM-5PM, W-F 9AM-3PM, Sa 9AM-2PM. The Mowanjum comprise the Worrorra, Ngarinyin, Wunambal and Gaambera people. The centre displays their art and crafts, hosts events and has a museum. Adult $5. (updated Mar 2024)
 Norval Gallery, 28 Loch St (by bus stop and visitor centre), ☏ +61 458 110 816. Temporarily closed. This displays Aboriginal art, some is for sale. (updated Mar 2024)
-17.3007123.62583 Wharfinger's House Museum, 3 Loch St, ☏ +61 8 9191 1426. Key from Visitor Centre. The "wharfinger" was the wharf manager, and his bungalow on stilts is now a local history museum. (updated Mar 2024)
-17.2914123.60944 Derby Jetty is the place to come line-fishing or watch the sunset. It's a curious horseshoe built in the 1960s, replacing the original of 1885 which was connected to town by a horse-drawn tram. As elsewhere on the Australian west coast, the problem for early European settlers was the lack of safe harbours and a big tidal range, which here reaches 12 m. Great expanses of mud flats disappear remarkably quickly as the tide floods, don't be caught out them.
Mary Island North and South are the low scrubby archipelago seen 8 km west of the jetty. Their waters and mud flats are popular for fishing.
Do[edit]
Boab Prison Tree
Beaches: frankly no, it's just mud flats, although the shoreline is enlivened by wacky sculptures. The big tides churn up the mud so the sea is turbid cold cocoa, no fun to swim or paddle in, and snorkelling is pointless.
Golf: Derby Sportsmen's Club is south side of town at 61 Ashley St. As well as the golf course they organise other events.
Memorial Swimming Pool is west side of the Visitor Centre, corner of Clarendon and Johnston streets. It's an open-air 25 m pool, open daily 11AM-5PM. Day membership is $5.50 in 2024.
One Mile Dinner Camp is south end of the golf course. Cattle drovers would lay up here with their herds awaiting the next ship at the jetty. One lucky cow traditionally got eaten here instead of further down the transport chain, with its meat traded for supplies from town, and the drovers tucking in to a roast. It's still a popular picnic spot especially at sundown.
Derby Speedway have regular races May-Oct. They're on Worsley Road south of town, turn off the highway by Frosty's Pool.
Mud crab races are two or three times a year, at Mary Island Fishing Club, 12 Elder St. The club gathers crabs and paints names on them. They're tipped into a ring marked by a rope, and the first to scramble out of the ring is the winner. But win or lose they all get eaten.
Birdwatching is mainly on the shore. There's a hide south of the golf course, and lots of other quiet spots along the tidal creeks. Doctors Creek is the bifurcated creek north of town, Airport and Alligator creeks are south. Remember those big tides - check times before venturing out on the flats.
