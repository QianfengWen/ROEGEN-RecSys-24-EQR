Djerba is an island and a cultural  UNESCO World Heritage Site in south Tunisia with beautiful sandy beaches and beautiful, peaceful and silent countryside. One from the best ecological destinations in the world, this island preserves its traditions and its unique architectural theme.


Understand[edit]
Djerba is known for its beautiful beaches and dramatic sunsets and therefore a popular tourist destination, particularly with French, German and Italian tourists. It is one of the few remaining places in Tunisia where a Berber language is still spoken. It is the largest island of North Africa with a total population of around 160,000. It is also notable for being home to one of the last remaining Jewish communities in the Arab world.

Public transportation is limited but taxis are available for reasonable prices. Stations de taxis exist in most towns and appear on Google Maps. Drivers are honest and use their meters. Ridesharing apps like Bolt and Uber do not work in Djerba as of early 2024.
It's also possible to rent a bicycle or motorcycle.

By bike[edit]
Bicycles are for rent for example in Houmt Souk or the Midoun area. Biking is relatively common and many drivers are accustomed to having bikes and small scooters on the roads. The main roads are clean and of good quality, and outside the towns traffic is quite light. Watch out for the smaller roads which are not always paved. Additionally, only a fraction of the roads is lit at night.

33.86666710.851 Houmt Souk. With colorful markets especially near Place d'Algérie, Borj El Kebir (a fort with no signs on the building itself but with an explanation room, you could pop by for a visit after the boat ride -- great for kids to run around), and the marina/port to the north, and Habib Bourguiba street (a charming replica of the giant one in Tunis). In the marché central one finds the traditional 'fish criers' - men seated on high blue stools auctioning a line of freshly caught fish to the crowd.   (updated Jul 2016)
33.72611110.8561112 Guellala. A village where pottery has been made since the times of the ancient Romans and where you may watch a wonderful sunset. There is also a museum of patrimony. Entrance fee is 7 DT with 2 for photo rights. One of the nicest museums in Tunisia housed in a beautiful traditional complex and well worth the visit, with detailed explanations in English of both Tunisian and Djerban customs. A café is next door with reasonable prices (1.5 DT for mint tea) and a great view down the hill. This is Djerba's highest spot.  
 Star Wars shooting location. The 1977 film Star Wars was filmed on Djerba. The infamous 33.7239910.750023 Mos Eisley Cantina, and the moisture farm where Luke Skywalker grew up, are still standing, and used as a residence in the case of the Cantina. 33.7408610.734954 Ben Kenobi's Hut is on the west coast, a half an hour's walk from Ajim, inconspicuous as it is today used as a fishermen's hut. Nice little seaside cafés along the way, peopled only by locals. This whole coastal road is not touristic, one could walk for about half an hour before running into a taxi, but it is a delightful walk during sunset hours. 33.8314610.748115 Sidi Jmour mosque, further north, is another filming location, and is a beach with a tiny cliff, popular with locals who row and fish and ride their horses into the sea while the children play in the sand. A fantastic location to watch the sunset, far away from the gimmicks of the touristy North East coast. Go with GPS locations saved on your phone as taxi drivers might not know exact locations of the star wars films.

A great place to watch beautiful sunsets is at the northwest side of the island is Borj Djillidj before turning left to Ajim.

A most quiet and serene place sure to inspire.
