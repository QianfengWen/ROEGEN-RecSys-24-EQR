Penguin is a small town in northern Tasmania, situated between Burnie and Ulverstone. It was named after the little penguins that used to wander around its beaches. Many things there, including bins are shaped like penguins. Penguin is also the home of Penguin Market.

Park by the beach, the Big Penguin, and shops on Main St.

Understand[edit]
Penguin was first settled in the mid-1800s as a timber town. Towards the end of the 1850s, demand for palings for home building during the gold rush in Victoria saw large quantities of timber shipped from the Penguin district across the Bass Strait.
The discovery of copper and silver further contributed to settlement in the area. The town of Penguin was proclaimed in October 1875.
