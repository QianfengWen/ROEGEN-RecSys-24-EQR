Indiantown is a small town in the Heartland of Florida. It is part of Martin County, but in the rustic part of the county.


Understand[edit]
Indiantown is a small town in Martin County with a population of roughly 6,000 people at the 2010 census. This town of a rustic nature was founded by the Seminole people as a trading post and was transformed into a town in the 1920s by S. Davies Warfield, as he planned to make it a railroad hub and model town. It is no longer served by passenger trains since Amtrak's service began in the early 1970s, but the town still has a CSX yard.
Even though Indiantown is considered to be a "deserted" town, there is a plus side of staying, which is little traffic through the city. There are many historic buildings in the town, including the Seminole Inn, built in the early 1900s, which is the only hotel within the city limits.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Florida State Road 710 is the main road of the city, Warfield Boulevard; SR 710 extends from Riviera Beach, near Palm Beach County Road 811, to Okeechobee, where it forms a junction with State Road 70, extending from Fort Pierce to Bradenton.

By train[edit]
Indiantown has had a long history of rail service with the Seaboard Coast Line until the station was no longer served in the 1970s when Amtrak began their services. Now, the closest Amtrak station to buy tickets from is in West Palm Beach, but the closest station to enter the town is in Okeechobee. Though Amtrak no longer serves Indiantown, there is still a CSX yard in the central area.

Get around[edit]
By car[edit]
It is easiest to get around Indiantown by car, mostly by taking the main road, Warfield Boulevard. There are also some really pretty county roads on the outside of town.

Indiantown is served by a public transit service known locally as the "Marty", a nickname for Martin County. The route runs mostly around Warfield, but has stops at the post office, the library, and the Boys and Girls Club.
