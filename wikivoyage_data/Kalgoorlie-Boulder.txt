Kalgoorlie-Boulder is a regional city (pop. 30,000 in 2018) in the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia. Kalgoorlie is a mining town with a long history that contains much of interest to the adventurous traveller. Over a hundred years of mining wealth has produced some beautiful old buildings that house pubs, post offices and general shops.


Understand[edit]
Grand public architecture reflects the wealth drawn from the gold mining that the city is built on.
The largest open cut gold mine in Australia abuts the town, though you are unlikely to notice it except for the mountain of dirt along the mines edge or the reverberations of the daily blast.
Kalgoorlie makes an ideal base to explore the other towns in the region that have an equally rich history.

 Kalgoorlie Visitor Centre, Cnr Hannan and Wilson St, ☏ +61 8 9168 1177, visitors@kalgoorlie.com. M-F 8:30AM-5PM, Sa Su 9AM-noon. Your best source for free pamphlets, maps and gold encrusted souvenirs. 
Get in[edit]
Kalgoorlie is about 600 km east of Perth, 397 km north of Esperance and 235 km south of Leonora. To the east is the endless desert.

By bus[edit]
From Esperance - TransWa runs 3 buses a week. The services on Wednesday and Friday leave Esperance's Dempster St Bus Station at 8:35AM, arriving Kalgoorlie train station 5 hours later. The Sunday bus leaves at 2PM. It stops at towns along the way including Norseman, Kambalda and Coolgardie.
By car[edit]
Kalgoorlie is the end point for three major highways. From Perth, the Great Eastern Hwy is the most direct path (596 km, 6-7 hours). From Esperance, the Coolgardie-Esperance Hwy (397 km, 4½ hr) connects up with the Great Eastern Hwy about 40 km away from Kalgoorlie. A detour via Kambalda on the Goldfields Hwy is slightly shorter. From Leonora, the Goldfields Hwy is a fairly quick drive in from anywhere north (235 km, less than 3 hr).
All the highways are sealed. There are frequent food and fuel stops at small towns along the way, except for on the Goldfields Hwy which has only one town, Menzies, along the way which doesn't have fuel at times. It would be a good idea to fill up in Leonora.

From Interstate[edit]
Norseman sits at the western side of the Eyre Hwy at the end of the long drive across the Nullabor plain. From here it's 191 km north on the Coolgardie-Esperance Hwy to Kalgoorlie.

By plane[edit]
-30.789444121.4616671 Kalgoorlie-Boulder Airport (KGI  IATA) (7 km from the centre of town). The small but modern airport has several daily flights from Perth, interstate and a couple of regional centers.   
Parking can be a problem as the carpark is often full with cars left behind by fly-in/fly-out workers. Taxis wait for every arriving flight and cost around $10 to town. There isn't an airport bus service and the local bus doesn't pass anywhere near the airport.

From Perth[edit]
Daily Qantas flights leave from Terminal 1 at Perth Domestic Airport. Virgin Australia Regional Airlines has less frequent flights throughout the week.

From interstate[edit]
Skywest have a weekly flight from Melbourne and Qantas flys as often from Adelaide.

By train[edit]
Kalgoorlie is on the interstate line that sees regular passenger services. The train station is in the main part of town within walking distance of backpackers and some hotels.

-31.482736118.2779491 The Prospector. One of the more pleasant ways to get here. The modern train takes about 7 hours from Perth with a few stops along the way. You can board in Perth at either the East Perth Rail Terminal or Midland Train Station. Onboard conditions are similar to economy class in an airliner, except that extra leg room is provided instead of free meals. Snacks and drinks can be purchased in the buffet car and there is a seat back digital entertainment system. Services leave Perth on M-Sa at 7:10 AM. An additional afternoon service only on Monday and Friday leaves at 3:15 PM. Sunday has only one train, departing at 2:10 PM. Similar departure times apply to services from Kalgoorlie to Perth. $93.70.   (updated Sep 2022)
 The Indian Pacific, ☏ +61 8 8213 4401, toll-free: 1800 703 357, salesenquiries@greatsouthernrail.com.au.

This train now runs only once weekly in each direction (passing through Kalgoorlie westbound on Friday nights, and eastbound on Sunday nights), and offers only platinum and gold class sleeper cabin accommodation. Although transcontinental passengers on this train may be able to organise a stopover in Kalgoorlie, those wishing to travel only between Perth and Kalgoorlie or vice versa should take The Prospector instead.

Get around[edit]
30°44′43″S 121°28′31″E
Most of the town attractions are clustered within walking distance in the centre of town. If you don't have a car it would be worth hiring one to get out to the spots on the outskirts.

By car[edit]
All the major rental car companies have booths at the airport. There is a big demand from the mining companies, especially during trade exhibitions so it would be worthwhile to book well in advance. Generally there large sedans and 4WD are the most common type of cat but you might be able to get a hatchback if you are just running about town.

By taxi[edit]
There are plenty of taxis that operate late into the night in the entertainment areas along Hannan St. The usual taxi charges apply.

By bus[edit]
Three routes of Transperth buses circle around town about every hour during the daylight hours. Weekend services are limited to the mornings. Most useful is route 2 that runs between Kalgoorlie and Boulder. The terminal for all services is at the intersection of Maritana and Hannan St, out the front of the Exchange and Palace Hotels. Timetables and route maps are available on the bus or at the visitors centre.

See[edit]
The depth of the Super pit makes everything look small.
You don't have to walk too far to see a plethora of historic buildings from different architectural eras. Some of the best examples line the length of Hannan St and adjoining streets.

-30.44192121.4171798 Kanowna, Yari Rd (29km east of Kal). A pair of cemeteries, a length of train platform and the occasional broken whiskey bottle are all that remains of a once thriving town of 12000 that occupies a flat plain pockmarked with abandoned mines.
