The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima in Cova da Iria.
Fátima is a world famous Catholic pilgrimage city and civil parish in the municipality of Ourém in Portugal's Beira Litoral region.


Understand[edit]
Fátima (FAH-tee-muh, /ˈfa.ti.mɐ/) is a world-famous place of Christian pilgrimage in commemoration of the apparitions of the Virgin Mary reported by three young shepherds (Lúcia, Francisco and Jacinta) from 13 May until 13 October 1917. The Catholic Church later recognized these events as "worthy of belief". A small chapel, now known as the Chapel of the Apparitions, was built at the site of the supernatural events, and a precious statue of Our Lady of Fátima installed.
Due to the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima, a Marian shrine complex containing two minor basilicas in Cova da Iria, the city has become in one of the most important international destinations for religious tourism, receiving between 6 and 8 million pilgrims by year. It attracts religious people and also those who seek the kind of peaceful lifestyle usually only found in convents and monasteries.

The Sanctuary of Fatima, also known as Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, is a group of religious buildings and structures in Cova da Iria, a place in the civil parish (freguesia) of Fatima.
In addition to the Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary, the sanctuary comprises the Chapel of the Lausperene, a great oak tree (near which the famous Marian apparitions occurred), a monument to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Chapel of the Apparitions, where three children Lúcia dos Santos and her cousins, Jacinta and Francisco Marto, were first visited by Virgin Mary. In addition, several other structures and monuments were built in the intervening years to commemorate the events associated with the events in 1916, including: the Hostel/Retreat House of Our Lady of Sorrows, the Rectory, the Hostel/Retreat House of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, a segment of the Berlin Wall, monuments to Fathers Formigão and Fischer, a High Cross (by artist Robert Schad), and individual monuments to recent popes. Across from the main sanctuary is the much larger Basilica of the Holy Trinity constructed after 1953, owing to the limited scale of the Marian shrine for large-scale pilgrimages and religious services.

39.63225-8.6718851 Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary (Basílica de Nossa Senhora do Rosário de Fátima). Contains the tombs of two of the little shepherds Francisco and Jacinta Marto (who died in 1919-1920), as well as the tomb of Sister Lucia (who died in 2005).

Here you can see a diamond-encrusted gold crown of the Virgin Mary's original image, which contains the bullet that was removed from Pope John Paul II after a failed assassination attempt.
