Irving is a city in the Prairies and Lakes region of Texas. Part of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, Irving has experienced exponential growth over the past fifty years, and is home to a multitude of attractions of all types, from modern art to major sporting events. Founded in 1902 out of the remnants of the small community of Kit, Irving is now a bustling city of approximately 197,000 residents.
Rather like Dallas, it is divided into a highly affluent northern half and less affluent but highly diverse southern half. It is bounded to the east by the northern fork (Elm Fork) of the Trinity River and to the northwest by the sprawling D/FW International Airport.


Get in[edit]
Irving Convention Center
By car[edit]
Irving is bordered on the northwest by Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, one of the largest and busiest in the world. Access to the city from D/FW is quite easy, from Texas State Highway 183 (also known as Airport Freeway) on the south, and Texas State Highway 114 (John Carpenter Expressway) and Interstate 635 (Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway) on the north. Dallas' inner loop (Loop 12, or Walton Walker Blvd) borders the city on the east, and Irving is also the current southern terminus for the President George Bush Turnpike. Additionally, Irving is traversed by Texas State Highway 183 which runs between Dallas and Ft. Worth.  It connects to both I-35E and I-35W that lead to other major interstates that lead all over the United States.

By public transportation[edit]
Irving is served by DART's Orange Line, the TRE, and a number of DART bus routes. From D/FW Airport, take the airside SkyTrain to Terminal A, then follow the signs to the DART rail station and board any train. Alternatively, you can head to the end of the platform and take a bus. From Love Field, take the LoveLink DART shuttle bus to Inwood/Love Field Station, then take the Orange Line bound for D/FW Airport Station.

Get around[edit]
By car[edit]
As in its larger neighbor Dallas, by far the fastest and most convenient way to get around Irving is by car. Several rental companies are available at each airport. Irving's streets are fairly easy to navigate, with most major thoroughfares laid out on a simple grid pattern. Major north-south streets are Belt Line Road, Story Road, MacArthur Blvd. and O'Connor Rd, and east-west include Walnut Hill Ln., Northgate Drive, Rochelle Rd., Irving Blvd. and Rock Island Road. During rush hour most of these streets (as well as the freeways serving the city) can become quite congested, so plan accordingly.

By public transportation[edit]
For those who prefer to avoid traffic altogether, Irving is also served by Dallas Area Rapid Transit, or DART, and the Trinity Railway Express, a rail link between downtown Dallas and Fort Worth, also passes through Irving. DART's Orange Line has six stops in Irving including the terminus at the airport and a local bus hub across the street from Irving Convention Center Station. The TRE makes two stops in Irving, and while its fares are surprisingly reasonable ($1.25 to Dallas) the stops are infrequent, especially on Saturdays, and there is no Sunday service. Getting around on DART and the TRE is covered more thoroughly in the Dallas article.

Do[edit]
While there is not really anything in Irving that could not be done in an afternoon, this suburb is filled with a wide mix of cultures from all over the world.

This fusion has led to the development of restaurants and shopping centers that creates a uniquely American suburban experience.

Go next[edit]
Irving is nestled deep in the heart of the Dallas/Ft. Worth metroplex.  Drive an hour or two in any direction to get out of the city and experience the real Texas in basically any small town you find.  The Texas people read about and see in movies is still alive and well, but unfortunately not in the fifth largest urban area in the United States.
