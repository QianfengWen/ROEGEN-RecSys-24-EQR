Katwijk is a town and municipality in South Holland, the Netherlands consisting of Valkenburg, Katwijk aan den Rijn (Katwijk on the Rhine), Katwijk Noord (Katwijk North), Rijnsburg and Katwijk aan Zee (Katwijk on Sea), which together house some 65,000 people.


Understand[edit]
Katwijk aan Zee and Katwijk aan den Rijn were once two separate towns, with Aan Zee being a fisherman's town and Aan den Rijn being more agricultural. Over time both towns grew together along with Valkenburg. The municipal office is held on the border of the two Katwijks, with the town hall itself on the Aan de Rijn-side, and the mayor's house being on the Aan Zee-side. This has been done so to not favor any of the two Katwijks during the merging of the two former municipalities. North of Katwijk aan Zee is a third district with Katwijk in its name, Katwijk-Noord, which consists of mostly post-war housing.

Valkenburg[edit]
Valkenburg is the oldest of the five districts. It began as a part of the county of Utrecht, and was transferred to the county of Holland in the 12th century. Katwijk and Valkenburg were always a part of the same ambacht, though the two were split when Valkenburg was sold in 1615. In 1798, during Batavian times, the municipal forms such as heerlijkheden, which Valkenburg was one of, were being dropped in favor of general municipalities. After annexation of the Batavian Republic by Napoleonic France in 1810, a new norm for municipalities was added, stating that a municipality needed to have at least five hundred inhabitants to be considered a municipality. Valkenburg did not, and was therefore reunited with Katwijk, only to split apart again after these rules were dropped following Napoleon's defeat and independence of the Netherlands. Since 2006, the municipalities have been joined again under the name "Katwijk".

Katwijk[edit]
Katwijk came to be where the Old Rhine meets the North Sea, possibly being named after the Germanic tribes that once lived there, the Chatten, with the -wijk suffix coming from the Latin word vicus, meaning settlement. The aan de Rijn suffix refers to the Rhine river, which used to run here until the eleventh century, when the river changed directions, leaving the Oude Rijn (Old Rhine) as a narrower river through the town.
Katwijk aan den Rijn is first mentioned in a 1231 document. The town lost its fish market to Katwijk aan Zee in 1388, after which Katwijk aan den Rijn focused more on agriculture. Katwijk aan den Rijn was besides that a small regional hub for water-bound transport. In the twentieth century, the Katwijk vegetable market grew bigger, with Katwijk being the biggest producer of carrots in Europe. The town lost this title at the start of the twenty-first century, when the vegetable market was disbanded.
