32.727265-114.6233451 Yuma Visitor Center, 265 S Main St, ☏ +1 928-783-0071, toll-free: +1 800-293-0071, fax: +1 928-783-1897, info@visityuma.com. Oct 1 - April 30: daily 9AM-5PM; May 1 - Sep 30: Tu-Sat 9AM-5PM. 
Yuma bills itself as the "Sunniest City on Earth", with weather (and weather records) to match: of any populated place in the contiguous United States, Yuma is the driest, the sunniest, and the least humid, has the lowest frequency of precipitation, and has the highest number of days per year – 175 – with a daily high temperature of 90 °F (32 °C) or above. Within the U.S., perhaps only Death Valley rivals it for extreme weather. Mix in tropical storm (Hurricane Nora, 1997), rare dusting of snow (Dec 1932, Jan 1937, Dec 1967) and along a fault zone (the Algodones fault zone in the Yuma Desert; record magnitude 7.1 in 1915), and it's not much of a stretch to claim that Yuma is a place of extremes.
The weather makes it a draw for out-of-state visitors and temporary winter residents (called "snow birds") and a year-round agricultural center. The Yuma area grows over 175 types of crops, ranging from citrus, alfalfa, cotton, wheat and other grains, dates - and the largest of which is lettuce. Yuma County grows 90% of all leafy vegetables in the U.S.
Aside from agriculture and tourism, there also is a large military presence, rounding out the top three industries for Yuma.
A number of movies have been shot in the area, most utilizing the desert landscapes.

Stay safe[edit]

Yuma is the last freight train stop before California and the Colorado River. This results in a lot of transients in this small, relatively conservative town. The police, in line with other places in Arizona, are quick to arrest 'loiterers'. If you are traveling with a backpack and don't look like a college student, be prepared to be rousted and harassed.

Go next[edit]
Yuma is next to the Mexican border, but getting to Mexico is not quite as easy as it seems due to the Colorado River. There is no access bridge from any part of the city. Due to a geographic oddity, Mexico is both to the west (closer) and south (further). The shortest way is to go into California on I-8, then south on Algodones Road (Exit 166/California State Route 186), and cross the border into metro Mexicali. (The first town is called Los Algodones.) You can also go south on US-95 from Yuma for just over 20 miles, and cross the border into San Luis Rio Colorado.
