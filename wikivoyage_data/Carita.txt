Carita is a town in the province of Banten in the Western Java region of Indonesia. It is on Java's west coast, and because it is mainly known for its beaches, the town is sometimes also called Carita Beach (Pantai Carita). Carita is just south of the even more well-known beaches of Anyer.

Administratively, Carita is a district in the regency of Pandeglang, about 30 km west of the town of Pandeglang.

Get in[edit]
Carita is along the coast road from the city of Cilegon via Anyer and Carita to Labuan. From Jakarta, Carita can be reached by taking the Jakarta-Merak toll road, exit at East Cilegon (Cilegon Timur), and then follow the main road to the south along the coast. Without traffic, Jakarta to Carita takes about 2.5 hours. However, because of the usual traffic congestion it is better to count on about 4 hours.
To get to Carita by public transport, you can take a so-called elf (public transport minibus) from behind the Grand Mosque of Cilegon. It is also possible to take a silver-coloured angkot (minivan) from Cilegon, but most of the angkots on this line do not go further than Anyer.
