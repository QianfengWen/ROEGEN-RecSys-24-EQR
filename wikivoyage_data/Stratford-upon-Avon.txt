High Street, Stratford-upon-Avon.
Stratford-upon-Avon is an historic town on the River Avon in the English county of Warwickshire, best known as the home town of the great English playwright and poet, William Shakespeare. Today, it is a major theatre-going destination as the home of the Royal Shakespeare Company. As such, it represents one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country.
Although it's often abbreviated to just "Stratford", when organising transport or accommodation always refer in full to "Stratford-upon-Avon". There's a large district of London called Stratford, where you don't want to go by mistake.


Understand[edit]


“

I like this place and could willingly waste my time in it.

”


—William Shakespeare - As You Like It, Act II, Scene 4

Stratford-upon-Avon has its origins in the Saxon culture of medieval England (the name "straet-ford" indicates that it was a river crossing). For many centuries it was little more than a small market town on the road to London; even today, it has only 24,000 permanent residents.  Though it has developed some industrial capacity, Stratford is now known mostly for its association with Shakespeare.  The town benefits tremendously from the resulting tourism and cultural activity, and has gone to great lengths to preserve those buildings that have survived since Shakespeare's time.  As a result the centre of town is quaint and attractive, drawing many thousands of tourists each year to its cultural and historical amenities.

By plane[edit]
The closest international airport is Birmingham Airport (BHX IATA), with many flights domestically and across Europe. Intercontinental destinations include Istanbul, Newark (New Jersey), the Gulf States, Amritsar and (who knew?) Ashgabat in Turkmenistan. Trains run from the airport to central Birmingham, change there for Stratford, and reckon 90 min.
The London airports, especially Heathrow (LHR IATA), have a wider intercontinental choice. Reaching any of them from Stratford by public transport takes around four hours by coach, and three hours by train (as you have to go into central London and then out again). By car, Heathrow is only 90 min away if the motorways are clear, but when would the M25 and M40 ever be clear?

By train[edit]

52.194-1.7161 Stratford-upon-Avon station. Is half a mile west of the town centre, an easy walk.   (updated Oct 2022)
52.2072-1.73092 Stratford-upon-Avon Parkway station. Don't get off at this other station! That's at the northwest edge of town, handy for motorists on the A46, but 3 km (1.9 mi) from the centre.   (updated Oct 2022)
There are frequent direct trains to Birmingham Snow Hill station (around an hour) and Warwick (around 30 minutes). For London there are only 3 direct trains, taking 2 hours to London Marylebone station. The journey usually takes 3 hours, changing either in Birmingham for trains to London Euston, or at Royal Leamington Spa for trains to London Marylebone.

By bus[edit]
National Express run direct coaches to Stratford from London Victoria (about 3 hr), Birmingham (1 hr) and Oxford (1 hr 15 min).

By car[edit]
From London follow the M40 motorway and exit at Junction 15 for A46 south. Distance 102 miles (164 km), journey time approximately 2 hours. See also the town's Park and Ride website.

By boat[edit]
At Stratford, the navigable River Avon meets the Stratford canal, which connects to Grand Union Canal and the entire English waterway network. You could even reach Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester, given enough time, and a narrowboat to wriggle through the narrow locks. Historically this was important, creating a freight route between Bristol to London in the early 19th century; and then in the 20th century it was the cause which focus efforts to rescue the national canal system from neglect.

Shakespeare's Birthplace
Hall's Croft
Holy Trinity Church


“

So long as men can breathe, or eyes can seeSo long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

”


—Sonnet 18

There are five sites closely associated with Shakespeare, and managed by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. A combi-ticket (called "The Full Story") is best value and they can all be seen in the course of an afternoon. Three are central: Shakespeare's birthplace on Henley Street is the obvious starting point. In later life he bought a house at New Place - it's long been demolished, but you visit to see the garden there, and the adjoining Nash's House where his grand-daughter Elizabeth lived. His daughter Susanna married Dr John Hall, and Hall's Croft was their house. A mile west in the hamlet of Shottery is Anne Hathaway's Cottage, where she grew up before marrying Shakespeare. Three miles west in Wilmcote is Mary Arden's Farm, childhood home of Shakespeare's mother.

52.193913-1.7080071 Shakespeare's Birthplace, Henley St CV37 6QW. Apr-Aug 9AM-5PM, Sep-Oct 9AM-4:30PM, Nov-Mar 10AM-3:30PM. Probably the location of Shakespeare's birth, and definitely the home of his early years. His father was a glove-maker and town magistrate, with a spell as mayor, so this is a fairly prosperous home of the 16th century. Restored with period decor and many authentic items, and small garden. "Full story" adult £22.50, age 3-17 £14.50, conc £21; Birthplace only £17.50, £11.50, £16.50.   (updated Jun 2018)
52.1911-1.707392 New Place, 22 Chapel Street CV37 6EP. Same hours as Birthplace. Substantial mansion built in 1483 and bought by Shakespeare in 1602, but it owes its present appearance (ie totally invisible) to The Rev Francis Gastrell: he so loathed Shakespeare and pesky tourists that in 1759 he demolished it. A good start, but he was run out of town before he could set about the other properties. So the site is nowadays a charming garden in Elizabethan style. The adjoining building, Nash's House, was the home of Shakespeare's grand-daughter Elizabeth, and her first husband Thomas Nash. "Full story" prices as Birthplace; New Place only adult £12.50, age 3-17 £8, conc £11.50.   (updated Jun 2018)
52.1886-1.708663 Hall's Croft, Old Town CV37 6BG. Apr-Aug 10AM-5PM, Sep-Oct 10AM-4:30PM, Nov-Mar 11AM-3:30PM. Home of Shakespeare's daughter Susanna and her husband Dr John Hall. In Jacobean style, with exhibition on medical & surgical practice of those times: no wonder so many patients died young. "Full story" prices as Birthplace; Hall's Croft only adult £8.50, age 3-17 £5.50, conc £8. Discounts for buying online.   (updated Jun 2018)
52.186667-1.70754 Holy Trinity Church, Old Town, CV37 6BG, ☏ +44 1789 266316, office@stratford-upon-avon.org. Apr-Sep: M-Sa 9AM-6PM, Su 12:30-5PM; Mar & Oct: M-Sa 9AM-5PM, Su 12:30-5PM; Nov-Feb: M-Sa 9AM-4PM, Su 12:30-5PM. The church is charming in its own right, but the main attraction is the burial place of Shakespeare and his immediate family within the chancel. So you can only view it when the church is open, and as a working church, services and other functions take precedence over tourism. Donation £3.   (updated Jun 2018)
52.19163-1.705435 Tudor World, 40 Sheep Street, ☏ +44 870 350 2770. Daily 10:30AM-5:30PM. Independent museum re-enacting life in Tudor England, set in an authentic Tudor building. £6. (updated May 2018)
52.18957-1.70036 Butterfly Farm, Swans Nest Lane CV37 7LS. Daily from 10AM; Oct-Mar till 5PM, Apr-Sep till 6PM. Walk-through tropical rain-forest butterfly habitat. See their life-cycles in the Caterpillar Room. In Insect City find Stick Insects, Beetles, Leaf-cutting ants and many more strange bugs. Arachnoland hosts the world's largest spider, a scorpion colony and other creepy-crawlies. Adults £7.25, children 3-15 £6.25.   (updated May 2018)
52.193106-1.7069157 Mechanical Art and Design (MAD) Museum, 4-5 Henley St CV37 6PT, ☏ +44 1789 269356. Apr-Sep: daily 10AM-5PM, Oct-Mar: M-F 10:30PM-4:30PM, Sa Su 10AM-5:30PM. The MAD museum is a collection of machines incorporating gears, chains, pulleys and whirligig paraphernalia. The exhibits fall into three areas: kinetic art, automata, and steampunk. Lots of rolling balls, clanking and rattling. There are exhibits indoors and in the garden with wind and water powered features and sculptures. Adult £7.80, child 6-15 £5.20. (updated May 2018)

Anne Hathaway's Cottage
52.190746-1.7319248 Anne Hathaway's Cottage, 22 Cottage Lane Shottery, CV37 9HH (One mile west of centre). Same hours as Birthplace.

Do[edit]
The Royal Shakespeare Theatre


“

All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players

”


—As You Like It, Act II, Scene 7

52.190509-1.7039971 Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Waterside, CV37 6BB, ☏ +44 1789 403493. Do see a production of Shakespeare, if you possibly can. You may have had boring experiences in the past, at school or with second-rate productions, or reckon you've seen enough of it on TV. But what the Royal Shakespeare Company bring to the plays in live performance is on a whole higher dimension. They perform here and in London but don't tour very much, so this is the place to see them. They do other plays as well and family-friendly versions of Shakespeare, see the RSC programme. And book early! Tickets are in high demand.   (updated Jun 2018)
There are three RSC theatres in town, which can be toured. The Royal Shakespeare Theatre within the Waterside complex is the main space for performing Shakespeare; it has 1018 seats with a thrust stage. Also within the complex is Swan Theatre, used for performing Shakespeare's contemporaries, and Restoration and newer work. It has 426 seats around a deep thrust stage. Some 150 m south along the river is The Other Place. This has a 200-seat theatre (incorporating the former Courtyard Theatre) plus rehearsal and studio space.
Tickets are normally £50-75 for seats on the lower level on the stage, with no restricted view. On the day standby tickets are considerably cheaper (£10-20), however you are not guaranteed availability, and seat choices are limited.
52.192459-1.7078922 Magic Alley, Bell Court CV37 6JP (off Rother St), ☏ +44 1789 290969. Hoaky re-imagining of the "lost years of William Shakespeare" - he was a wizard, apparently - plus lots and lots of merchandising (but thankfully no Harry Potter). £10. (updated May 2018)
Hire a rowing boat and take a trip up and down the river.
Stratford Town Walk is a guided sightseeing walk, daily at 11:00 plus Sa Su at 14:00. The walk starts from the Swan fountain on Waterside, near the Royal Shakespeare Theatre and opposite the junction of Sheep Street. The walk takes about two hours, adults £6, no booking. The same team also runs:

Buy[edit]


“

If money go before, all ways do lie open.

”


—The Merry Wives of Windsor, Act II, Scene 2

Stratford sounds like an ideal place to stock up on Shakespeare... but is it? A book of the complete works of Shakespeare can be bought online for less than £4 plus postage, a Kindle version for less than £1, and a simple text download for free. That's because the works are deemed to belong to the common heritage of the English-speaking peoples, with no copyright restrictions, and there are innumerable print editions and e-sources out there. So Old Bill could be adding class to your bookshelves long before your trip. 
On most summer Sundays there is a craft-market on the Waterside. The produce isn't particularly local though.

Eat[edit]


“

'Tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers.

”


—Romeo and Juliet, Act IV, Scene 2

Stratford eating places are well geared to theatre-goers. Usually there's a pre-theatre rush at 5PM, then it all goes quiet between 6PM and 7PM before the evening crowd starts coming in. But there's not much of a late night scene, as you'd find in London's West End or in Edinburgh.
