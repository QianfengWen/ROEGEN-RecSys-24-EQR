Get around[edit]
Having a car is important. You can get to Guerneville using public transportation, however is not easy or convenient. Once you are at 'the River' (as it is also known) having a car will help you explore the stunningly beautiful countryside. There are bicycle rentals available in town (seasonally), but much of the terrain is very hilly and the roads are narrow without much of a shoulder for getting well out of traffic.
