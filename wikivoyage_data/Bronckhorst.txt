Kasteel Keppel
Bronkhorst is a municipality in the middle of the Achterhoek, Gelderland, The Netherlands. The municipality has been around since 2005, when it was created by merging the former municipalities of Hengelo, Hummelo en Keppel, Steenderen, Vorden and Zelhem. This makes Bronckhost the 12th largest municipality of the Netherlands. Its name is derived from the smallest city in the Netherlands, Bronkhorst, which can also be found in this region.


Understand[edit]
Bronckhorst itself has little history as it has only been around for just over 10 years. Its predecessors however have some history to their name.

Hengelo[edit]

For other places with the same name, see Hengelo (disambiguation).

Not to be confused with Hengelo in the province of Overijssel. Hengelo is a village with many events, varying in size. Most notably is Hengelo's motorraces, with an annual road race on the Varsselring-circuit.

Hummelo and Keppel[edit]
Worn bridge near Hummelo
Hummelo is a town along the road between Doetinchem and Zutphen. The road however, has been permanently re-rerouted around the town, causing its main road's restaurants and shops to loose profit. Never the less, Hummelo is a pretty village that is worth visiting.
The name of Keppel implies that it is a single town, though in reality, it consists of Hoog-Keppel and Laag-Keppel (lit.: High-Keppel and Low-Keppel). Hoog-Keppel is, in short, no more than urban housing. Laag-Keppel is the main attraction of the two. The 19th century Keppelse Watermolen is a picturesque watermill between the Oude IJssel river and an old, partially blocked off diversion of the river. On this former island in the river you will also find Kasteel Keppel, which is a castle, originally built around 1350, and rebuilt in the 17th century after it has been destroyed in 1582.

Steenderen[edit]
Steenderen is a town that's mostly known for its factories of Aviko and FrieslandCampina. Steenderen is historically an industrial town, and it doesn't pose much for the average traveller.

Vorden[edit]
Vorden is the castletown of the Achterhoek, if not Gelderland. It counts a grand total of eight castles, all of which surround the town. Quite some time ago, in 1976, it was crowned the pearl of Gelderland for its many castles. None of these castles haven't changed much over time, and are still worth visiting or viewing when visiting isn't possible.

Zelhem[edit]
Coopsmolen, Zelhem
Zelhem is one of the larger towns in Bronckhorst, though its centre is the thing worth visiting Zelhem for, is rather small. The town's main pearl is the Lambertichurch in the middle of the town. When walking long distances, you might be interested for its location on the Pieterpad.
