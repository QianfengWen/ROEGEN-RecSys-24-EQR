Downtown Lawrence with The University of Kansas in the background
Lawrence is a city in Eastern Kansas, USA along I-70, 35 miles (56 km) west of Kansas City, Kansas. It is home to the University of Kansas. Lawrence provides a mix of academics, bohemia, and small-town Kansas kitsch. It has been the setting of many movies and is a growing cultural hub in Kansas.


Understand[edit]
Lawrence is a college town with ideologically diverse residents. Two universities are located in the town - the older and more historic University of Kansas, with a campus spanning from downtown Lawrence to west Lawrence, and the federally funded Haskell University in southeast Lawrence. There are also many historic settings, as this city was among the first in Kansas and shaped the cultural and political landscape of Kansas for generations to come, at its founding. Today, it is a cultural hub in the state, with several theaters, restaurants, music venues, bars, clubs, churches, and landmarks. This town, and the surrounding county, is oozing with history from the pre-Civil War Bleeding Kansas era, and there is much to explore.
