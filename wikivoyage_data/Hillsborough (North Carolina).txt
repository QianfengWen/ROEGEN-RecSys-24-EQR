Downtown Hillsborough
Hillsborough is an incredibly historic town in North Carolina, important to the history of the state. Easily accessible from nearby Durham and Chapel Hill, it has a cute historic downtown and a "small town" feel.


Understand[edit]
Visitors Center
Before being discovered by European settlers, Hillsborough was home to several Native-American groups including the Eno, Occoneechi, and Siouan tribes. White settlers founded Hillsborough in 1754. Almost immediately Hillsborough, became a place of political and social importance. There were many pre-Revolutionary War tensions during the 1700s and the town was even used as a base for British General Charles Cornwallis in February of 1781. During the American Civil War, Confederate general Joseph E. Johnston camped just outside of Hillsborough. In the 20th century, Hillsborough became a place well-known for its stock car racing, and was even home to Occoneechee Speedway, one of NASCAR's first two tracks. The remains of Occoneechee Speedway can still be visited today.
