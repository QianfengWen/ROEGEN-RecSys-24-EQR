Stein am Rhein is a town in the eastern part of Switzerland. It is situated on the river Rhine, at the western end of Lake Constance (Untersee). It is famous for its medieval town centre, including many half-timbered houses and frescoes. The town is split across the Rhine, with the old town centre on the north side.


Understand[edit]
Stein am Rhine was just a small fishing village until 1007, when St. Georges's abbey was moved there. Stein am Rhine was at an intersection between major roadways and the river, and both the town and the abbey prospered. The town now has a population of a little over 3000, and is a popular tourist destination.
