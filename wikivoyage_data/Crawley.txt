Crawley is a town of 119,000 people (2021) in West Sussex, on the border with Surrey, in the South East of England. The biggest influence on the town is Gatwick Airport, which lays claim to being the 6th-busiest airport in the world.


Understand[edit]
Crawley was a small town until 1947 when it was designated a New Town. Its population boomed in the 1950s and 1960s.
