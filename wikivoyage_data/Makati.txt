Makati's Central Business District
Makati lies in the heart of the Metro Manila. The city is known for its upscale shopping malls with high fashion brands, restaurants and hotels, and is home to many affluent Filipinos. Makati is considered to be a financial, commercial and economic center; it is home to the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE).

Cost of living[edit]
Makati City's cost of living is significantly higher than its neighboring Filipino cities, owing primarily to its skyrocketing real estate value and relatively upscale commercial and residential selections. However, compared to other major cities of the world, Makati is not that expensive compared to other upscale cities in the world. Furthermore, bargains comparable to other Philippine cities may be found in certain areas, such as in the Makati Cinema Square, The Landmark, Cash & Carry, and Guadalupe Mall, that will make a stay in Makati possible even with a backpackers' budget.

History[edit]
The area of Makati City was first dismissed as worthless swampland by the Spanish conquistador Juan Miguel de Legazpi in 1571. Yet over the centuries, this small community would leave large imprints in the social, economic, and cultural history of the country. In 1670 it was established as a visita of Sta. Ana de Sapa under the of the Franciscans. The friars established one of their earliest churches in the Philippines, the Church of Sts. Peter and Paul, in Makati, drawing pilgrims from all over the country. At the opening of the 20th century, the Americans established Fort McKinley in Makati, and in 1901, San Pedro de Makati, with a population of 2,500, was incorporated into the province of Rizal. On February 28, 1914, the Philippine Legislature passed Act 2390, shortening the name San Pedro Makati to Makati in the 1930s, the first airport, Nielson Airport, opened in what is now the Ayala Triangle. The first centrally planned community was established in the 1950s, and since the 1970s, Makati has been the undisputed financial and commercial capital. Makati has also figured prominently in the political history of the Filipinos. The community was one of the cradles of the revolt against Spanish colonial rule, and following the assassination of Ninoy Aquino in 1983, the epicenter of the protest movement against the dictatorial rule of Ferdinand Marcos. On January 2, 1995, Makati became an independent city by Republic Act 7854.

Talk[edit]
The main language choice for communication in this affluent city is English, making the stays here of international travelers and businessmen a relatively enjoyable experience. A knowledge of Tagalog, the local language, will benefit any traveler.

By car[edit]
Two of Metro Manila's main arteries pass through Makati. The Epifanio De los Santos Avenue (EDSA) passes along the southeast part of Makati and connects the city with Mandaluyong City and Pasay City. The South Luzon Expressway (SLEX) runs through the western part of Makati and connects the city with Manila to the north and with southern Metro Manila. The Skyway, an elevated highway built on top of SLEX, provides residents coming from southern Metro Manila a fast way to reach Makati. SLEX and EDSA intersect at the Magallanes Interchange, which is the most complex system of elevated roadways in Metro Manila.
Other major roads in Makati include Buendia Avenue (Sen. Gil Puyat Avenue), which connects EDSA and SLEX in the north; Ayala Avenue, an important street that runs through the Central Business District; and Makati Avenue, which connects Ayala Avenue with Buendia Avenue and also extends north to cross the Pasig River to Mandaluyong City.

By bus[edit]
Buses plying the Epifanio De los Santos Avenue (EDSA) route from Baclaran in Paranaque to Quezon City and Caloocan City pass through the Central Business District daily. As mentioned above, you can't load or unload just anywhere, you have to wait or go to the designated stops. There are separate loading and unloading zones which you must observe.

14.5506121.02857 One Ayala Terminal, Ayala Center, Epifanio Delos Santos Avenue corner Ayala Avenue.

By taxi[edit]

By ferry[edit]
The Pasig River Ferry [dead link] stops at one station in Makati: Guadalupe (near Guadalupe Bridge) is in a convenient spot for tourists, which makes this option far less convenient than hailing a taxi. It may be worth keeping the ferry service in mind as another means of getting into Makati from other riverside districts such as Manila/Intramuros in Manila.

Get around[edit]
You can easily walk around the Central Business District by way of the sidewalks or the pedestrian underpasses. Some areas in the Central Business District are connected with overpasses where pedestrians can walk above the streets.
Taxis are also abundant, especially around the malls. The flat rate is ₱40 and a ride across town is ₱100-150.
It is inadvisable to drive in Makati. Makati has some of the strictest traffic rules in Metro Manila. Traffic marshals actively enforce rules. The metro-wide road space rationing ("number coding" or "color coding") scheme is active all day unlike in neighboring cities where they are only enforced during rush hour. Traffic jams are a headache, one-ways streets are common, and left turns are less common than rights. Parking fees are steep, especially in the CBD, and enforcement is draconian, with clamping or towing for violations.

Drink[edit]
The epicenter of Makati's famous nightlife is Greenbelt where some of the city's best restaurants, cafes, bars and karaoke joints cluster around a park in the middle of the main business district. Meanwhile, there are a series of bars stretched out along Makati Avenue, northeast of Ayala Triangle, including the infamous P Burgos Street red district area.
The Poblacion area is next to (or arguably a part of) the Red Light District, and is possibly the best place for bar hopping in the Metro. The historically low rent (by Makati standards) of the area has led to several trendy bars and restaurants popping up, ranging from cheap beer gardens to some of the best bars in the country. Just start in the area around Don Pedro St. and walk around until you find a bar you like.

In Greenbelt: Museum Cafe Ground Floor, Ayala Museum, Makati Ave corner Dela Rosa Street (adjacent Greenbelt 3 and 5) Tel +63 2-757-3000. Kind of a swanky joint. Usually featuring live music. It's common to see well-heeled expats sipping mimosas at noon.

Stay safe[edit]
Makati is generally peaceful. Perhaps the more peaceful place than Makati is the Bonifacio Global City (Fort Bonifacio) area of Taguig. Choosing between Manila and Makati? Makati is much better security-wise.
Be mindful of people coming from outside of Makati though. They tend to be tagged as 'less civilized' by Makati residents because most offenses in the city are made by them.
Be wary of strangers and take extra precaution when being approached. Avoid crowded places, as well as sketchy locations.
Metro Manila police are generally foreigner-friendly. As usual, the recommended approach is to be on high alert at all times, as incidents may take place anywhere.

Connect[edit]
The international telephone country code for the Philippines is +63. The area code for Metro Manila (including Makati) is 2.

Cope[edit]
English is spoken everywhere. All traffic signs and business establishments are in English. In formal business engagements, English is the language of choice.
Expect heavy daytime traffic in Makati.  Avoid traveling during peak hours.  While jeepneys are banned from certain areas (namely Ayala Center), they are in full force everywhere else.  Just like any urban area, Makati is noisy.  In addition to the general traffic noise, the city is in the midst of a construction boom, and construction is ongoing 24/7.  So when choosing a hotel, it's a good idea to find out in advance what is happening in the nearby vicinity.  If there's a 40-story tower going up across from the Mandarin Oriental, which there is, ask for a room facing the other direction. It's highly recommended to use tap water for washing your hands and nothing more.
Be wary of taxi drivers.  Every other driver will tell you he doesn't know where Greenbelt 3 is, thereby forcing you to give directions or allow him to circle the area, unmercifully driving up your fare.  On Friday and Saturday nights, never light a taxi if the driver refuses to use the meter and insist on an extortionate fare to your destination, for instance, a normal cab ride from P Burgos Street to Greenbelt should be no more than ₱70.  On weekends, it's usually ₱100 just to get in the cab.  Some drivers will outright refuse to take you based upon what they perceive to be their odds of getting a return fare.
Also, if you're that reckless, beware of citizens stealing your information and making charges to your accounts.
Generally speaking, Makati is the most civilized and comfortable metropolis in the Philippines.  Travelers of all nations will feel comfortable.
