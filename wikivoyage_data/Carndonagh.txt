Carndonagh (Carn Domhnach) is a market town on the Inishowen Peninsula in County Donegal. With a population of 2471 in 2016, it's the largest settlement in the north of the peninsula, which ends at Malin Head the most northerly point on the Irish mainland. Other villages described here are Ballyliffin and Clonmany to the west, and Moville and Greencastle on the shore of Lough Foyle. Buncrana near the foot of the peninsula is described on its own page.

Get around[edit]
You need wheels to explore Inishowen Peninsula. A bike would do.

See[edit]
Church of the Sacred Heart in Carndonagh is the RC church prominent on the mound southside of The Diamond. It was completed in 1945 in Romanesque style. Barrack Hill Park and gardens are just south.
Donagh Cross is 500 m west of The Diamond on Church Rd, junction of R238 and R244. It's a 7th century high cross, one of the oldest in Europe, flanked by two "guard stones" like Dismas and Gestas. Across the street is the C of I Donagh Church, built in 1769. Look for the ancient "marigold stone" in the graveyard. Another 400 m north, a roadside white cross marks the Mass Rock used in the Penal times.
55.316329-7.3726741 Carrickabraghy Castle  is a scenic stump north of Pollan Strand. "Carrick" means a rock, "braghy" no-one knows, maybe something rocky. From 834 to 1215 AD it often featured in "The Annals of the Four Masters", which reflected the site's importance but was not good news, as the Annals mostly recorded people hacked to death in battle. It then fell into obscurity until 1600 when the present castle was built, as part of the final conflict between Gaelic and English rule. The Gaels lost and fled into exile, and the castle was abandoned from 1665. It's free to stroll around any time.
55.3086-7.335982 Doagh Famine Village, Lagacurry, ☏ +353 74 937 8078. Apr-Oct daily 10:00-17:00. Open-air village museum showing local history from the Great Famine in the 1840s to 20th century border troubles. Adult €10, child €6. (updated Aug 2021)
St Parick's High Cross
55.317-7.4033 Glashedy is the uninhabited island seen 1 km off Pollan beach. It's been used for grazing, but is best known for the number of ships it's wrecked, and for the scale of illegal poitín distillation discovered by the coastguard.
55.247-7.5324 Lenan Head Fort  was built in 1895, so it was a late addition to the Napoleonic-era artillery positions along this coast. Its three 9.2 inch guns stood ready during the First World War, and like the other Lough Swilly positions it remained held by the British until 1938 when all the "Treaty Ports" were handed over. The Irish held the position during the Second World War then abandoned it in 1952. And abandoned is what it appears, more like a derelict factory site than military. You can stroll it anytime.
Fort Dunree: is the best preserved of the coastal defences, see Buncrana for this and others further south.
Malin is the attractive small village that gives its name to the headland 13 further north.
Five Fingers Strand is a long beach with sandhills facing Doagh Famine Village across the channel. Reach it via the lane off R242 at Lagg.
55.383-7.3675 Malin Head is the most northerly point on the Irish mainland. Dúnalderagh at the tip is several km further north than anywhere in Northern Ireland (those extremes being Benbane Head near Giant's Causeway on the mainland, and Rathlin Island off Ballycastle). Ptolemy's "Geography" of the 2nd century AD calls it Βορειον - "Boreion", north, which pretty much sums it up. Bird-watching is the main attraction. There's a Napoleonic-era lookout tower, some ugly army huts, and clifftop viewpoints, such as Pólifreann or Hell's Hole, a cleft boiling with spray when the weather drives onshore. Ballyhillion is a series of raised beaches: after the glaciers melted the sea-level rose but the land rose faster as it rebounded from the weight of ice. A walk east brings you to the "Wee House of Malin", a hermit's hidey-hole. The Eire 80 marker is one of 82 etched around the coast in 1943 to advise aircraft that they were approaching the neutral Republic. Sadly, this neutrality was breached during the Star Wars between the Last Jedi and the First Order Fleet, filmed here, at Skellig Michael and in hyperspace in 2015 / 16. Later transgressors are wont to modify the access road sign from R242 to R2D2.
Lenan Head Fort
55.43-7.2346 Inishtrahull 10 km north of Malin Head is Ireland's most northerly island, though the wave-dashed Tor Rocks lurk another km further north. Its fisher folk left in 1929 but the lighthouse keepers stayed on until 1987 when the light was automated. The island is now a birdlife reserve, check the rules before landing, especially in the hatching season May-July. Inis Trá Thuathail means "island of the empty beach" - the landing point is north facing the Atlantic, away from the mainland and shelter, so it's always precarious.
55.268-7.1747 Clonca Church is the ruin of a 17th / 18th century church, on the site of a 6th century monastery. There are elaborately carved tombstones and masonry. The High Cross depicts the miracle of the loaves and fishes; another cross has fallen.
Temple of Deen is a group of megaliths 1 km east of Clonca Church, access via R238. These were support pillars for a large burial chamber, originally (maybe Bronze Age) covered in an earth cairn.
55.272-7.1488 Bocan Stone Circle is 1 km south of Culdaff village besides R238. Only 7 of the original 30-some stones remain standing.
 Inishowen Maritime Museum & Planetarium, Coastguard Station, Greencastle F93 T2KA (by Lough Foyle ferry pier), ☏ +353 74 938 1363. Tu-Sa 10:00-16:00, Su 12:00-16:00. Small museum about the area's maritime history. Museum alone adult €5, conc €4, child €3; with planetarium show €10, €8 & €6. (updated Aug 2021)
Northburg Castle is the ruin of a 14th-century bastion, smashed up and abandoned in the 17th. It's just a scenic stump, half a km east of Greencastle harbour.
55.197-7.3349 Slieve Snaght is the 615 m mountain between Carndonagh and Buncrana. You might be content to admire it from afar, as it's boggy and midge-ridden by any route. Shortest but soggiest approach is from the lane to the east, 12 km return. Many prefer to ascend from R244 around Drumfrees: a track leads up towards Slieve Snaghtbeg (505 m), then pick your way to the main summit.
