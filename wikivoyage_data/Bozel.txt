Bozel is situated in the Tarentaise Valley, in the department of Savoie, From 380 m to 3 855m, the Tarentaise Valley covers the high Isère Valley, in the heart of the French Alps, between Beaufortain and the Mont Blanc Massif in the North, Vanoise Massif and the Maurienne Valley in the south, and the crest of the Alps in the east, which falls over on the Aosta Valley in Italy.
The Tarentaise Valley is a national heritage area of exceptional importance:

Natural heritage and landscape shaped by man.
Religious heritage in a country filled by the Christianity since the 5th century. Then this heritage has been marked by the Baroque art.
Civil heritage with its towers of defense or vestiges of the Gallo-Roman culture.
At last, architectural heritage of mountains villages, and, closer to us, the craft or industrial heritages and leisure activities.

Understand[edit]
Inhabited since  Neolithic, Bozel is the quintessence of the Savoyard village since the Middle Ages.
Administrative Centre and shops at the valley below, and habitat shelled in seven hamlets clinging to the mountains: Villemartin, Tincave, The Mollinets, The Râtelard Lachenal, The Court, Les Moulins.
Bozel a shift from an altitude of 900 to 2558 meters, the summit of Mount Jovet. There, a 360 ° view: form the Mont Blanc Massif to the Vanoise glaciers.
In Bozel you walk in the footsteps of history: the "Sarazine Tower" (12th century) makes us imagine the Lords Rouge of Bozel's feudal power. The chapel of St. Barbe (16th century) recalls the strength and age of Christianity in the valley, to the Counter-Reformation Baroque.
While walking from village to village, you can also hear the echo of Tarines (cattle in the pasture of Tarentaise, used in France today to produce the cheese with a distinct flavor that comes from the high alpine villages of the Tarentaise valley), or locate the shaping of the landscape by obstinate mountain farmers, peasants became workers in the 20th century.
Today Bozel lies in the  Vanoise National Park [1][dead link] and the center of prestigious ski resorts such as Brides les Bains, Champagny, Courchevel, Méribel, La Tania and Pralognan la Vanoise.
Today Bozel is a growing town, counting 2031 inhabitants in 2008.

The 59234 was also the 13th century property and residence of the bishops of Tarentaise. This tower is called "Saracen", like many others in Savoie, evidence that the violent incursions of Spanish pirates in the 9th and 10th centuries have left an enduring memory in the collective memory.
