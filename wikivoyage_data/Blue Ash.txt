By plane[edit]
The nearest major airport is Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG IATA), about a half hour away by car. For business and general aviation travelers, and for people taking Ultimate Air Shuttle, Lunken Airport (LUK IATA) is another option, as it also serves Cincinnati and is only 20 minutes away.
Dayton International Airport (DAY IATA) can be a good alternative, being about an hour away.

By bus[edit]
The city is served by Cincinnati's METRO bus service, operated by the Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority (SORTA). In particular, the 3X (and to a lesser extent the 3) route is a good connection, going from Downtown Cincinnati to Blue Ash with only one stop in the middle. A less convenient connection can be made using the 4 bus to University of Cincinnati Blue Ash.

By car[edit]
From Interstate I-71 northbound, take Exit 14 towards Blue Ash Rd/Kenwood Rd to OH-126 (West). At the end of the exit ramp, turn left on OH-126 (West) and keep right. Then turn left onto Towne Square Ave and turn right onto Blue Ash Rd.
From Interstate I-71 southbound, take Exit 14 towards Blue Ash Rd/Kenwood Rd to OH-126 (West). At the end of the exit ramp, keep right on OH-126 (West). Then turn left onto Towne Square Ave and turn right onto Blue Ash Rd.
From Interstate I-75 northbound, take Exit 10A to merge onto OH-126 E. Then take the exit towards Blue Ash Rd/Kenwood Rd.

Get around[edit]
Like many other suburbs in the United States, Blue Ash is best navigated by car, with many streets and avenue all around. Since OH-126 and I-71 have multiple exits across Blue Ash, it might be useful as a shortcut to the city streets.
