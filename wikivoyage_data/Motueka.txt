Motueka is a town in the Nelson Bays region of New Zealand's South Island that lies close to the Motueka River. Nearby beaches (such as Kaiteriteri Beach and Marahau) are very popular with holidaymakers, and the area around Motueka has one of the country's highest annual sunshine-hour indices. Because of the gorgeous scenery and continual building of swanky clifftop homes by rich incomers, the coastline between Motueka and Marahau has been dubbed the Riviera of the South Island after the famous French Riviera.


Understand[edit]
The surrounding district has a large, but diminishing, number of orchards, as well as growing a variety of specialised crops such as hops and boysenberries (it used to be the main centre of tobacco growing in New Zealand and some patches survive between police raids, growing for their "own consumption"). A number of small boutique wineries have gained an international reputation.
Motueka, as the nearest town to the Abel Tasman and Kahurangi National Parks, has become the base of many tourism ventures in those parks, as well as in other recreational areas. Extensive limestone cave systems (including Harwoods Hole in the Takaka Hill area north of Motueka) attract cavers and rock climbers. Sea kayaking and tramping now attract many thousands of visitors each year.
Many artists and craftspeople live in the area around Motueka, especially potters and reggae musicians. The Riverside Community, in nearby Lower Moutere is a pacifist international community founded in the 1940s and now New Zealand's oldest co-operative commune.
