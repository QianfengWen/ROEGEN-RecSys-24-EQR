View of Ocean City from the pier
Ocean City is a popular oceanfront resort city on the coast of Maryland. Many things draw visitors -- skyscraper hotels, clean beaches, the boardwalk, restaurants, beachfront lodging, amusement parks and the large convention center -- but a simple bay sunset may be the greatest pleasure. Visitors range from families escaping the more urbanized Western Shore of Maryland to conventioneers soaking up the sun to teenagers enjoying the first taste of vacation without adult supervision


Understand[edit]
Ocean City is a beach resort town located on a barrier island along the Atlantic Ocean, on the east coast of the Delmarva Peninsula. The city is located in Maryland, with the adjacent beach town of Fenwick Island just over the border in Delaware. The city is about 10 miles long, running from the Ocean City Inlet to the south to the Delaware border to the north, and a few blocks wide. The downtown area is in the southern part of the city and contains the boardwalk, amusements, arcades, restaurants, shops, and older homes and motels. The central and northern parts of the are situated along a strip on Coastal Highway and are home to hotels, high-rise condos, restaurants, bars, shops, the convention center, and newer housing developments. The city has a year-round population of 6,800 (2020), but attracts between 320,000 and 345,000 vacationers on summer weekends and sees about 8 million visitors annually. Many visitors to Ocean City come from other parts of Maryland and the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area, with other visitors coming from Virginia, Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. The peak time for tourists to come to Ocean City is between Memorial Day weekend in late May and Labor Day weekend in early September. In June, the city is a popular destination for Senior Week, where recently-graduated high school seniors come to Ocean City to spend a week with their friends.

Summers are hot and humid with occasional thunderstorms, while winter is cool with most precipitation in the form of rain (though light snowfall and sleet is sometimes experienced, particularly in areas further from the ocean). Spring and autumn share mild temperatures and fair weather. Hurricanes and tropical storms are rarely concerns, but they do affect the area once or twice in a decade, typically as a much less intense storm.

Worcester County, of which Ocean City is a part, has several small towns with historic buildings that make a great side trip.
Assateague Island, which consists of Assateague State Park and Assateague Island National Seashore, has pristine beaches and wild ponies a short distance to the south of Ocean City. From Ocean City, follow U.S. Route 50 west and make a left onto Maryland Route 611 (Stephen Decatur Highway) south, and follow that route to the park entrance. Assateague Island is a 15 minute drive from Ocean City.
The Delaware beach resorts to the north offer a more relaxed environment than the bustle of Ocean City. Straight up the Coastal Highway, Delaware Route 1, is Bethany Beach (30 minutes) and Rehoboth Beach (45 minutes). Both Bethany Beach and Rehoboth Beach are home to boardwalks, shops, and restaurants, with Rehoboth Beach home to tax-free outlet shopping.
A 50 minute drive west along U.S. Route 50 will take you to Salisbury, the largest city on the Eastern Shore, with a quaint historic center. Salisbury is home to attractions including the Ward Museum of Wildfowl Art and the Salisbury Zoo.
You can also check out Washington D.C. and Baltimore, which are each about a 2 1/2 hour drive away on US 50.
On the other side of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel, the Hampton Roads are approximately a 2-3 hour drive away on 113/13 South.
If you go north through Delaware, you can drive to Philly and New York.
