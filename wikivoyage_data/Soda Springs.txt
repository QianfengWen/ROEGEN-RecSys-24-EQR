The Geyser
42.65717-111.605151 Geyser Park, 39 W 1st S. 24 hours daily. The main attraction of Soda Springs is the Geyser. It is not entirely a natural phenomenon, though. It was unexpectedly released during well drilling for a swimming pool thermal water source in 1937. Cold water powered by pressurized carbon dioxide was shooting 100 feet into the air. It has been capped and a timer releases it for 8 minutes once every hour. There is a visitor center at the site. Free.   (updated Aug 2022)
