52.5202-7.89061 Rock of Cashel (Carraig Phádraig, St Patrick's Rock), ☏ +353 62 61437, rockofcashel@opw.ie. Daily Sep-May 09:00-17:00, Jun-Aug 09:00-19:00. One of Ireland's top sights, mobbed by coach tours in summer, a fortified enclosure on a limestone outcrop. This natural stronghold has probably been settled for millennia; legend says that the devil took a bite out a mountain 30 km north, broke his teeth, and spat out the rock which landed here. The first documented occupants were the Eóganachta, who ruled Munster from the 6th to 10th century AD. They were ousted by the O'Briens under Brian Boru, whose great-grandson King Muircheartach O'Brien gifted the site to the church in 1101. Park at the foot of the rock and follow the walkway. Enter through the Hall of the Vicars Choral, built in the 15th century to house the cathedral choristers. Then pass through the cathedral (13th-century Gothic) and Archbishop's Residence (15th C), with the Round Tower (11th and 12th century) by one corner. The highlight is the Romanesque Cormac's Chapel, completed in 1127; give your eyes time to adjust to the gloom, to pick out the rich carvings and frescos. There are High Crosses in the graveyard. Adult €8, senior €6, child/student €4.   (updated Jul 2020)
 Brú Ború, Rock Cottage, 1 Rock Lane (by Rock of Cashel car park), ☏ +353 62 61122. It's primarily a performance venue for Irish music, song, dance and theatre, with shows Jul Aug: Tu-Sa at 21:00. It also has a genealogy centre and restaurant. (updated Jul 2020)
St Dominic's Abbey is the ruin 300 m south of the Rock. It was a Dominican abbey founded in 1243 and dissolved in 1540, though diehard friars were somehow still there 300 years later. It's free to stroll around anytime.
52.517568-7.88832 Folk Village, Dominic St, ☏ +353 87 915 1316. Apr to mid-Oct: M-Sa 10:15-20:00, Su 11:00-20:00.

52.515-7.8863 St John's Cathedral is Church of Ireland (Anglican), a Georgian building on John St.
52.515127-7.8857724 The Bolton Library. A remarkable collection of antiquarian books, which as of 2020 cannot be visited. They were amassed by Theophilus Bolton, Archbishop of Cashel 1730-1744. They include a 12th-century manuscript, the Nuremberg Chronicle of 1493 and works by Dante, Swift, Calvin, Erasmus, Machiavelli and the physicist Robert Boyle. Several bear library stamps showing ownership by Catherine of Aragon, or Francis Bacon. After Bolton died, the library remained in the archbishop's palace for almost a century then was moved to the chapter house of St John's Cathedral. Conditions there were unsuitable and many books deteriorated. In 1995 the collection passed into the care of the University of Limerick: their task of stabilising, restoring and cataloguing the contents continues. The books are now in the Glucksman Library on UL's Castletroy campus; it's not known when or where they might be exhibited.   
A few scraps of the city walls survive just south of the cathedral.
St John the Baptist is the Roman Catholic church facing the cathedral on Friar St. It was completed in 1795 over the site of a Franciscan friary.
52.516758-7.8876775 Kearney's Castle, 15 Main St. Closed. Just admire the exterior of this 15th-century tower house, which was used as a garrison by Lord Inchiquin's Parliamentarian army. The Kearney family lived in the building for many years, and Fr. John Kearney was hanged in the castle in 1652. The building in modern times was a hotel but this closed in 2016. (updated Jul 2020)
Hore Abbey
52.5175-7.96 Hore Abbey (Mainistir Iubhair), Loughnafina, Cashel (1 km west of the Rock). 24 hours. This monastery was founded by the Benedictines in the late 12th century, but in 1270 was granted to the Cistercians. The legend goes that the Archbishop ejected the Benedictines because he dreamed they planned to murder him. This doesn't seem likely, it was everyone else in town that was sharpening their knives for him, and there may have been an England versus Ireland twist to it. The abbey fell into ruin at the Dissolution. Free.   (updated Jul 2020)
52.497-7.9837 Golden Castle is one helluva name to give to the dilapidated stump on the island in the River Suir.

You only come this way along N74 to reach the Priory, turn south here and see below.
52.479-7.9828 Athassel Priory, Athassel North, Golden (7 km southwest of Cashel). Extensive riverside priory founded by the Augustinians in the late 12th century.
