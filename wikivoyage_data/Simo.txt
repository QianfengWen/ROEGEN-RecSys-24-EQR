Simo is a small municipality in southwest Finnish Lapland. This is a summer destination and most people come here for fishing wild salmon. Other attractions are the old villages Simokylä and Simoniemi.


Understand[edit]
Simonjoki by the Hanskankoski rapids rest spot
Simo has about 3,000 residents. The net migration is slightly positive but the population trend is slowly declining though. The community still lives strongly from agriculture, and potato is even nowadays a major product. Many locals however drive daily to the cities Kemi or Oulu for work. In close future a renovated highway from Oulu towards north will probably bind Simo more to influence of Oulu than to the rest of Lapland. Simo itself is an important wind power producer and there are several wind power plants. Simo is also an important producer of energy peat.

Geography[edit]
Geographically Simo is very similar to the Ostrobothnian area to its south. The landscape is flat and consist of forests and large open mires. Compared to the rest of Finland the lakes and rivers are notably scarce. The river Simo (Finnish: Simojoki) flows to the Baltic Sea, and is one of those few rivers left that still have its original breeding Baltic Sea salmon population. The shoreline to the Baltic Sea is long, and the shallow waters are in favour to many pelagic birds. The population is heavily concentrated to the sea shore and along the banks of the Simo river while there are few people residing elsewhere.
There are large bog and mire systems especially in the northeast. The southern part of the Runkaus Strict Nature Reserve, protecting an exceptionally important fen mire, is in Simo. To protect its nature the Runkaus area is closed to the public.

History[edit]
There are many place names of Sami origin at the area. The oldest known settlements on the mouth of Simo river are fishermen communities from 1300s. In 1540 there were 11 houses in Simonkylä, 6 in Simoniemi and 5 in Maksniemi village. The road connetion was established in 1652 but it took until 1750s before wagons could use it. During the 1700s, numerous settlers arrived to the area but it took until 1800s before first permanent settlements were built inland, to the banks of the Simo river. Simo became an independent parish in 1796.
When Finland was still part of the Russian Empire, some young Finns – known as Jägers – prepared themselves for rebellion against Russia by traveling secretly to Germany to get military training there. Later they arrived back to Finland via sparsely populated Ostrobothnian coast where hiding the autorities was easy. On December 11th, 1916, a group of these Jägers were hiding in a forest hut near Yli-Kärppä village when a police patrol found them. During the encounter known as Simon kahakka, the Simo Skirmish, one Jäger was killed, three Jägers and two policemen were wounded, and two Jägers were captured. The skirmish was the first violent encounter between Finns and Russians since the Finnish War (1808–1809) – except the assassination of the governor general Nikolaj Bobrikov 1904 – and is often seen as a start of weaponed fight for Finland's independence. There is a movie about the skirmish.

The museum road Simonkyläntie
In September 1944, during the Lapland War, the bridges across the river were completely destroyed by Germans to slow down approaching Finnish army. Maksniemi village and the surroundings of the railway station suffered heavy damage during these battles while Simonkylä and Simoniemi villages survived completely.
In the early 20th century the paper mill in Kemi started to turn the rural municipality into more laborious one. Agriculture remained the most important livelihood. During the 2010s, Simo has become an important producer of wind power.
