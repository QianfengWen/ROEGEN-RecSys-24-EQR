Piazza Grande - Arezzo's historical centre
Arezzo is a city in Tuscany, Italy that was an important Etruscan town. Nowadays, Arezzo is an agricultural trade centre; has machine, clothing, gold, and jewellery industries; and is a tourist centre.


Understand[edit]
Arezzo's origins as a place of human habitation date far back into the Stone Age. Its history begins no later than the 4th century BC, when it was called Aretim and was one of 12 hill towns of the Etruscan League (the list also included what are now called Perugia, Chiusi, Cortona and Volterra). After the Romans took over Etruria, they called this city Arretium. In the 11th century, Arezzo was made a free commune, siding with the Ghibellines. Arezzo is also famous for Guido d'Arezzo, the Medieval abbot who originated solfeggio (the mnemonic music system known to many from the song in The Sound of Music that starts "Doe, a deer") at the Duomo in the early 11th century.

Map of Arezzo


By plane[edit]
Arezzo can be reached by flying to Italian major international airports in Rome or Milan, or to the two airports in Tuscany:

Pisa International Airport Galileo Galilei[dead link] (PSA IATA), 1.5 km (1 mile) south of Pisa city centre.
Florence Airport Amerigo Vespucci (FLR IATA), 4 km from the centre of Florence.
By train[edit]
Arezzo's train station, which is at the edge of the historic old town, offers frequent connections to cities like Florence and Rome.

By bus[edit]
There are bus connections with other important destinations in Tuscany, including Florence and Siena.

Get around[edit]
The Duomo
Arezzo's historic old town is small enough to explore on foot. If you have a rental car, you can park in one of the municipal lots for under €10 for the entire day, then walk up into the historic centre.  Note that Arezzo is atop a steep incline, and you will feel as though you are walking uphill pretty much everywhere. Wear comfortable shoes.
ATAM runs the city bus service (there is also a "Centro Storico" line that covers the historic old town).
The taxi service is efficient and not too expensive.

Casa del Petrarca Only open if you knock and ask nicely if you can come in; this is the home of famous Italian medieval poet Petrarch.  Hours vary depending on the mood of the proprietor, but it is totally worth it.
La Vita è Bella Roberto Begnini's Academy Award-winning film was shot here in Arezzo, and as you proceed through the city centre, you will see colorful signs featuring pictures from the film at the specific locations of actual filming.  Spend at least an hour wandering from sign to sign.
The Crucifixion by Cimabue in the Chiesa di San Domenico
Do[edit]
The Antiques Fair that occupies Piazza Grande and many of the streets leading to it, with an array of some 500 stalls by which is fun to browse though. Arriving by car it's best to leave it in the Pietri free parking lot and go up to the Duomo on the escalator.
Dates: Takes place on the first Saturday and Sunday of every month.
Not being a big touristic city like Firenze it is most recommended to stroll in the charming old city center along the small alleys and enjoy its quiet streets. A good panoramic view of the city can be seen from the tower of "Palazzo dei Priori" in Piazza della Libertà, or walking through "Il Prato" park up to the Medicea Fortress.
Festivals[edit]
Stained glass in San Francesco
Arezzo is home to an annual medieval festival called the Joust of the Saracens (Giostra del Saracino). In this, "knights" on horseback representing different areas of the town charge at a wooden target attached to a carving of a Saracen king and score points according to accuracy. Virtually all the town's people dress up in medieval costume and enthusiastically cheer on the competitors.
Dates: The third Sunday of June and the first Sunday of September.
