Rugby is a market town of 78,000 people (2021) in the Borough of Rugby in Warwickshire, in the West Midlands region of England, part of the United Kingdom. The town is credited with being the birthplace of rugby football, and is a must visit for the avid rugby fan. Rugby is also a birthplace of the jet engine.


Understand[edit]
Rugby School
Rugby School is one of England's oldest and most prestigious public schools, and was the setting of Thomas Hughes's semi-autobiographical masterpiece Tom Brown's Schooldays. A substantial part of the 2004 dramatisation of the novel, starring Stephen Fry, was filmed on location at Rugby School.
In the 19th century, Rugby became famous for its once hugely important railway junction which was the setting for Charles Dickens's story Mugby Junction.
The town also inspired Thomas Hughes, (author of Tom Brown's Schooldays) to set up a colony in America, for the younger sons of the English gentry, who couldn't inherit under the laws of primogeniture. He named the town Rugby. The town of Rugby, Tennessee, still exists today.
Rugby has always been a centre for the surrounding farming communities, and a weekly cattle market continued to be held in the town until 2008, but it was the coming of the London & Birmingham Railway in 1838 which caused a significant expansion of the town.
In 1840 a junction with the Midland Counties Railway from Leicester was completed and in consequence major railway yards and other heavy engineering industries developed in the town.
The now demolished Rugby Radio Station would have been the radio station that would broadcast a firing message for Britain's nuclear submarine Polaris, should it have been necessary, according to declassified information. The radio station was key in linking London to New York.
The decline of heavy engineering and the downgrading of the railway facilities led to a decline in the town. However, efforts have been made to exploit the central location of the town to attract new businesses and distribution centres to the area.
