Window Rock (Navajo: Tségháhoodzání) is a town of 2,500 people (2020) in Apache County, in the state of Arizona in the United States of America. It is significant beyond its size as the administrative center of Navajo Nation, the country's largest Indian reservation and an important tourist destination.


Get in[edit]
Window Rock is just west of the New Mexico state line and is more easily reached by road from New Mexico than from Arizona. Hwy 264 leads from Gallup on Interstate highway 40 (following historic Route 66) to the town. The southwestern approach to the town is via US Hwy 191 from I-40.
Albuqueque International Sunport, with flights around the U.S., is about a 2½-hour drive away.

Go next[edit]
Window Rock is a good base camp from which to visit some of the Navajo Nation trading posts and look for Navajo rugs and other folk art. Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site, near Ganado, is a unit of the United States National Park System, but is also a working post with a good collection of rugs and jewelry. Posts at Crystal (picturesque setting, quite different from the desert you might be expecting), Two Grey Hills (a particularly noted rug-weaving region), and Wide Ruin are also close.
Other nearby national parks and monuments include Canyon de Chelly National Monument to the north and Petrified Forest National Park to the southwest along I-40.
