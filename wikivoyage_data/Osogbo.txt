You might consider a side trip to Ile-Ife, considered to be the ancestral home of the Yoruba people, as it is where Oduduwa is said to have grabbed the three items of creation from his older brother Obatala on their rather contentious trip down from heaven while the latter was imbibing on palm wine. Oduduwa then sprinkled some earth on the ocean and set a chicken on it, which spread the earth upon which Ile Ife came to be built, in a nutshell. The following are sites related to the cultural history of Yoruba in Ile-Ife:
In the core palace-sort of area of downtown Ile-Ife:

Ile Nla- Ooni of Ife Palace- this is where the current king of Yoruba (the Ooni of Ife) and descendant of the God-king Oduduwa presides. It may be possible to take a tour of the palace and even possibly meet the Ooni.
The National Museum - showcase of Yoruba culture and history, including the characteristic elongated bronze face sculptures that demonstrate Yoruban smelting ability and belief that the inner power and energy of a person, the Ase, are in the head.
Oduduwa Afewonro Park - a park centered around a statue of the deity Oduduwa, complete with his cockerel (chicken) ready to spread the earth.
Tower of Independence - an obelisk type monument celebrating Nigeria's independence in 1960.
Moremi, Statue of Liberty, Ile-Ife - this is a statue reminiscent in ways of the Statue of Liberty with a torch and all. This is said to be a monument to the autonomy of women.
A little ways out from the core:

Opa Oranmiyan - a shrine having to do with a Yoruba warrior whose descendants are royal heads in various parts of Nigeria, and a sacred grove.
Oduduwa Grove and Shrine - a similar sort of shrine, but unfortunately restricted without prior authorization
Also in Ile-Ife is the:

OAU Museum at the regarded Obafemi Awolowo University, which is perhaps one of Nigeria's only natural history museums.
Another outing on the other side of Osogbo (through Ilesha) is the Erin Ijesha Waterfall, a 7-tiered fall, but since it is quite crowded and people even seem to bath in it, the hour or so long trip may not be all that worth it.
