Merredin is a town in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia, with a population of 2604 in 2021. It's traditionally a stopping point between Perth and the Kalgoorlie gold mines, and had a gold rush itself in the 1880s / 90s. It was too dry for agriculture until a water-catchment was built on the nearby hill; it's nowadays a grain-producing area with huge grain silos by the railway tracks.
