Get in[edit]
Coming from Pristina, the fastest and simplest way to reach Gračanica is by the road between Albi Mall and Viva Fresh, just off the road to Skopje. Continue on this main road for roughly 6 km, and you'll find yourself in Gračanica's city center. A metered radio taxi should charge less than €6 from Albi Mall, or roughly €10 from Pristina's city center.
Follow this same road through the end of town to reach the monastery.
You can also catch the bus to Gjilan leaving every 20 minutes from the main bus station in Pristina. The fare to Gračanica is €0.50 (payable inside the bus) and the trip lasts about 15 minutes.

Ulpiana is one of the largest ancient urban sites in Kosovo. In the beginning of the 1st century AD, with the Roman occupation of the Dardania, this multi-layered archaeological site was developed from an ancient Dardanian settlement into a typical Roman town. Municipium Ulpiana was found and urbanized by the Roman Emperor Marcus Ulpius Traianus (Trajan). It reached its highest development during the period between 3rd and 4th centuries AD, a time when it was called Municipium Ulpiana Splendidissima – the Splendid City of Ulpiana. Ulpiana was destroyed almost entirely by a destructive earthquake in 518. Emperor Justinian the Great rebuilt it but also renamed it Justinianasecunda. The fortified town of Ulpiana had an area of 35.5 hectares. In the eastern side was the castrum, a fortified field garrison that covered an area of 16 hectares. Ulpiana with its surrounding suburbium occupied about 120 hectares.   (updated May 2022)
