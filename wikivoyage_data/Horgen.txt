In medieval times, the hamlet benefited from its favorable location on a mule track and was used as a trading center for the wares of merchants. After the Reformation, it momentary became turbulent because of conflicts with the Catholic inland and everything culminated in the War of Bocken at the time of Napoleon. Ever since those events, it stayed mostly calm, only the construction of the railway attracted attention because of some complications.
