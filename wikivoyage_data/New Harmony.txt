New Harmony is a town in Southwestern Indiana.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
New Harmony was the site of two attempted utopian communities during the early 19th century. The first was founded in 1814 by the Harmony Society and their leader, George Rapp. In 1825, their town was bought by social philosopher Robert Owen for his communitarian experiment, continuing the work he started in New Lanark, Scotland.

Map of New Harmony

New Harmony is near the western border of Indiana and I-64.  It is about 15 minutes from the Interstate highway.

Get around[edit]
You can walk everywhere in New Harmony.  It's about nine blocks long.
But if you would prefer to get off your feet, the New Harmony Golf Car Company offers rentals.  This is not as a strange as it sounds.  Many locals seem to own them, and they are a common form of transportation in this quiet town.

See[edit]
Scattered throughout the town, surviving Harmonist buildings are marked with the town's historic markers. Guided tours of these historic buildings depart from the decidedly modern Atheneum.

By phone[edit]
Most telephone numbers in New Harmony consist of +1 812 plus a seven-digit number, but a second area code (+1 930) was overlain onto the entire 812 area in September 2014. A local or in-state telephone call now requires all 10 digits of the local number be dialed (omitting just the leading +1 from a local landline call).
Signage on many established businesses may still display the original seven-digit numbers; dial 812 before these if no area code is indicated.
