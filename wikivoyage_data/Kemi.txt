Kemi is a town in Finnish Lapland, at the northernmost tip of the Gulf of Bothnia. Most tourists are drawn by two wintry sights: its world famous Lumilinna Snow Castle & Hotel and the unusual chance to have an icebreaker cruise. The city also boasts an array of shops, restaurants and bars. In its character, rather than having a Lappish ambiance, it strongly resembles an ordinary Finnish town.
The surrounding countryside is a separate municipality, Keminmaa.


Understand[edit]
Kemi is an industrial town dominated by a Metsä Group 65.754624.52081 pulp mill and Veitsiluoto 65.692324.62142 paper mill. The 65.7824.71683 Kemi mine in Keminmaa is the only chromium mine in Europe. The chromium is used in Tornio's stainless steel mill, which was established for this particular reason, 30 km away.
The area surrounding the mouth of the river Kemi (Finnish: Kemijoki) has been subject to agriculture at least since the 13th century. The Kemi parish was mentioned in 1329, but it was only in 1856 that Emperor Alexander II of Russia established the town. It was built according to a strict grid plan, which still makes finding places in downtown Kemi fairly simple.
A sawmill on the Laitakari island began operating in 1863; the economy of the reborn Kemi was heavily based on logging. The railway connected the town to southern Finland in 1903, and in 1939 the harbor moved from downtown to Ajos, about 10 km off-town. Today Kemi has one of the few deep-water harbours in Finland. During the World War II aftermath known as the Lapland War, retreating German troops devastated public buildings, and all the bridges over the Kemijoki river, but left private houses untouched.
In July 1949 the government wanted to cut the wages of lumber workers, who went into a strike against the plans. In August 18th 1949 the strike ended up into a bloody conflict between the police and over 3,000 lumber workers and harbour dockers. This "Bloody Thursday" is so far the last fatal political protest in Finland.
Due to its labour activist past Kemi has got fame as a "red town". The Left Alliance and the Social Democratic Party still have more than half of the city council seats, making Kemi a political curiosity in Finland.
Modern-day Kemi has slightly over 20,000 inhabitants. The population trend is declining.
