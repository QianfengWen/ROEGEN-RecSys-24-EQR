Ragueneau is a municipality in Manicouagan, Côte-Nord, in Quebec. It is on the Route des Baleines and the Route Nature aux mille délices (gourmet route).


Understand[edit]
Ragueneau has five magnificent bays on the coast of the St. Lawrence River: Baie à Chouinard (near the Old wharf), Baie du Père-Georges, Baie chez Phydime, Baie à Ti-Jos and Baie Verte. Each of these bays has fine sandy beaches and has a long sandstone at low tide. Moreover, the Batture aux Outardes in Baie aux Outardes (mouth of the Rivière aux Outardes) can stretch up to 6.6 km at low tide in front of the village of Ragueneau. Thus, at low tide, the water currents appear on the sandstone and the small islands emerge more.
