Toliara is a coastal city at the southern terminus of RN7 in the Toliara Province of Madagascar.


Understand[edit]
Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
 Toliara Airport (TLE  IATA). Madagascar Airlines flies from Antananarivo (daily), Morondava (once a week), Taolagnaro (twice a week). Book your flight early as these flights often fill up. 
By bus (taxi brousse)[edit]
Mini-buses are the cheapest way to get to Toliara. In Tana you can catch them at the Fasan-karana taxi brousse station. They leave around 09:00 and 16:00. They cost 35,000 Ar and take 18 - 24 hours to get to Toliara depending on the quality of the car and the number of times you break down. You can also catch a taxi brousse to Toliara from any of the major cities on the RN7.

By car[edit]
Many travellers rent a car and work their way down the RN7 over a few days. This is a great way to see a lot of different parts of the country. Major attractions on this route are Parc National Ranomafana (near Fianarantsoa) and Parc National Isalo. Cars usually run 130,000 Ar a day plus fuel. Car rentals almost always come with a driver.

Get around[edit]

Rickshaws, locally called, "pousse-pousse" are seemingly everywhere in Toliara. They are the cheapest form of transport available and are great to get you out of the hot sun or to go short distances with heavy luggage or shopping bags. While it may seem a bit odd for the first-time tourist to be pulled around the street by a man, rest assured that this awkwardness is only one way. These guys are proud of their pousse-pousse and the work they do. These aren't just for tourists, everyone uses them so go ahead and hop on-board!

Do[edit]
Buy[edit]
The downtown craft market "Tsena Cociagy" is behind Etoile de Mer and the Alliance Francais. Numerous handicrafts and shells are available. Dome of these shells are endangered species and bringing them into your home country can get you in a lot of trouble. Handicrafts are not made locally, but are brought in from Ambositra and Fianarantsoa so if you come down the RN7, better to buy them there or in Tana as prices are lower there and the selection is greater.
