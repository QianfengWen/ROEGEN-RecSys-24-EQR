Westport is the main town of the Buller District, in the northern part of the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand. Westport has spectacular beaches at its back door, and the mighty Buller River, the largest river by volume in NZ, runs right beside the town. Breathtaking views of the Paparoa Mountains and the Brunner Range are the backdrop for this scenic town. Outdoor adventures abound, coupled with fabulous eateries and hospitable locals.

Go next[edit]
It is best you check your fuel tank before leaving Westport, as it may be 70-90 km to the next filling station whether you're headed north, south or east.

North[edit]

Karamea - About 1.5 hours (90 km) drive to the north on State Highway 67, and the start (or finish) of the Heaphy Track. (There is no exit road from Karamea other than State Highway 67, so make it a day trip, at least.)

The Truman Track is south along the coast from Westport and is a 15 minute hike to the coast with excellent breakers and a pebble beach.
