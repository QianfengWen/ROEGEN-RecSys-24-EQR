Tracy City City Hall
Tracy City is a town of 1,400 people (2019) in Grundy County in central Tennessee. There are many hills, rock faces, and beautiful streams in the countryside surrounding Tracy City. The town is built around a few streams that flow through its limits. 


Understand[edit]
It's along US Route 41 near Interstate Route 24 in Central Tennessee, a region of the South that is, for the most part, thickly forested. 

History[edit]
Tracy City was incorporated in 1915, and named after financier Samuel Franklin Tracy. The city developed out of railroad and mining interests after coal was found in 1840. In 2010 the people of Tracy City elected a dead man, Carl Robin Geary, as mayor.

Get in[edit]
U.S. 41 connects Tracy City with Jasper and Monteagle, and Tennessee Route 56 connects Tracy City with Coalmont and Altamont.

Get around[edit]
See[edit]
Shook House'There are many beautiful waterfalls near Tracy City because it is on the edge of the Appalachians, and many canyons dramatically cut their way through the side of the mountain range. However, the canyons themselves are hard to view because the region is thickly forested in most places.
Although you might expect to see a lot of historic houses in the South, Tracy City was founded in the early 20th century, so there are not many historic buildings.

35.182005-85.6760781 Foster Falls, 498 Foster Falls Road (A couple hundred feet from the southern Fiery Gizzard Trailhead). This beautiful waterfall is on a tributary of the Fiery Gizzard Creek and only exists at certain times of the year. It falls down a large rock overhang and into a pond below like many Tennessee waterfalls do. It is fairly easily accessible from the Foster Falls Campground. (updated May 2018)
35.258654-85.7404792 Shook House (Corner of Railroad Avenue and Montgomery Street). This is a historic house near downtown. It is on a large property and is quite attractive, although not easy to view in detail from either Railroad Avenue or Montgomery Street. (updated May 2018)
Do[edit]
Foster FallsThe most well-known hike in the Tracy City area is the Fiery Gizzard Trail.
35.228051-85.7504111 Fiery Gizzard Trail, 131 Fiery Gizzard Road (Fiery Gizzard Trailhead), ☏ +1 931 924-2980. The Tracy City end of the Fiery Gizzard Trail is accessed via the relatively flat Grundy Forest Day Loop. The loop begins at the Grundy Forest State Natural Area Picnic Shelter, and after just 500 feet (150 m) presents hikers with a 20-foot (6.1 m) waterfall. Vestiges of the Civilian Conservation Corps camp S-67 can be seen another half mile down the walk. Hikers can see the confluence of Little and Big Fiery Gizzard Creeks, can cool off in three swimming holes, two with waterfalls. The Fiery Gizzard trail begins roughly midway along the Day Loop, crossing a bridge across Little Fiery Gizzard Creek while the loop continues without crossing the bridge. Sights along the trail begin with a large rock shelter and a five-century-old Hemlock tree, the 7-foot-deep (2.1 m) Blue Hole with 9-foot (2.7-m) waterfall, then Sycamore Falls, a swimming hole at the base of a 12-foot (3.7-m) fall. The trail then passes through the "Fruit Bowl," a pile of house-sized boulders with stairs through them that were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps. Other features in this portion of the hike include Chimney Rock, a 20-foot (6.1 m) rock column, Black Canyon - so named because of organic stain on the rocks, and Crumbling Bluff - an area honeycombed with pits and small caves. After 3.7 miles (6.0 km), the trail begins an arduous climb to Raven Point, possibly one of the most rugged and difficult trails in Tennessee. Raven Point offers a spectacular overlook on a spur 0.4 miles (0.64 km) off the main trail. Continuing from there, the path mostly follows the flatter top of the Cumberland Plateau, except for a precarious 0.3 miles (0.48 km) horizontal 200-foot (61-m) vertical (each way) dip into Laurel Branch Gorge across myriad rocks that all seem to move as you step on them.
