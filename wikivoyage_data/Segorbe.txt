Segorbe city walls
Segorbe is a town of about 8,900 people (2018) in Castellón (province). Segorbe's bull-running week (semana de Toros) in September attracts 200,000 visitors each year.


Understand[edit]
Segorbe has been inhabited since the earliest of times, due to its strategic location with fertile lands, a navigable river, and springs. During the Islamic era (8th-13th centuries) Segorbe was considered to be one of the most important cities of the Muslim province of Toledo. Its last Muslim ruler converted to Christianity in the early 13th century, and it was later occupied by King Jaime I of Aragon, who used it as a base for the conquest of Valencia.
In modern times the town is known for olive oil and wine, and for its annual running of the bulls.

Festivals[edit]
Gathering the bulls along C/ Argén, near the Torre del Verdugo
 Entrada de Toros y Caballos (Running of the Bulls and Horses). From M-Su of the 1st or 2nd week of September. Although not as well-known as Pamplona's Sanfermines, Segorbe's festival is just as old, dating from at least the 14th century, and has been designated a Festival of International Touristic Interest by the Spanish government. Unlike other bull runs, it is distinguished by the use of horses to guide the bulls as they run through the town, and by the absence of barriers protecting onlookers, who prod the bulls on with sticks or canes. An estimated 20,000 spectators participate each day in this event.At 12:00 each day a dozen bulls are collected from the nearby hamlet of Peñalba and driven across the river and along C/ Argén to the Torre del Verdugo (Torre del Botxí), which they reach at about 13:00. The roads are lined with spectators, and a few daredevils will attempt to run with the bulls as they pass; there are several good perches along the city walls from which to observe the action.At Torre del Verdugo six bulls are then selected for the carrera (running), which begins promptly at 14:00, signaled by a firecracker. The bulls and horsemen then thunder along C/ Colón to the provisional bullring at the 39.85227-0.4868513 Plaza de la Cueva Santa, where they are held in pens until the evening's bullfights. The entire run lasts just about a minute, with throngs of spectators who had previously been milling about frantically running to the sides of the street to evade the bulls. The horsemen then return to the starting point, with great applause and fanfare.   (updated Sep 2017)
