Buena Park is a city in Orange County in Southern California. Buena Park is nestled between Los Angeles and San Diego, and is best known for a Knott's Berry Farm on what used to be Walter and Cordelia Knott's farm.


Understand[edit]
European settlement of the area dates to the Spanish "ranchos", which were huge land grants in the late 1700s. A rail connection to Los Angeles was established in 1875. Buena Park was established as a community in 1877 (in conjunction with the railway development) and incorporated as a city in 1953. There has been some industrial activity in the area (such as a Nabisco factory which closed in 2006).

Knott's Berry Farm[edit]
Timber Mountain Log Ride, one of the classic attractions installed by Walter Knott.
Knott's Berry Farm is America's oldest theme park. In 1920, it was a working farm selling berries, with Mrs. Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant serving its first chicken dinners in 1934. Once the restaurant started drawing a crowd, Walter Knott began constructing a replica Ghost Town in 1940; the park's first ride attraction (the Ghost Town & Calico Railroad) opened in 1952. Knott's Berry Farm remained family-owned until late 1997. The park is now owned by Cedar Fair Entertainment Company and the food brand was acquired by the J.M. Smucker Company.
The park has the first, largest or only version of various amusements: the Calico Mine Ride (1960) the world's first themed amusement park attraction, Timber Mountain Log Ride (1969) the first log flume with thematic elements, Corkscrew (1975) the first modern roller coaster to successfully turn riders upside-down, Xcelerator (2002) the world's first hydraulically-launched roller coaster.
