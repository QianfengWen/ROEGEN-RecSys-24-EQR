Gettysburg, in Adams County in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, goes down in history as the battlefield in the Civil War where, despite terrible tragedy and loss of life, there was hope for the Union. In many ways, Gettysburg is where the North won the Civil War, and where Abraham Lincoln gave the Union hope that, somehow, something good was to come out of the lives lost in battle.


Understand[edit]

“

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

”


—Abraham Lincoln, Gettysburg Address, 1863

A re-enactment of Pickett's Charge
Gettysburg is a borough and the county seat of Adams County in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. However, Gettysburg is famous for the Battle of Gettysburg that was fought July 1-3, 1863. The fighting started when Union and Confederate troops converged just north of the town of Gettysburg. Three bloody days of fighting ensued, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. The town is also the location where President Abraham Lincoln gave his Gettysburg Address. The town hosts visitors to the Gettysburg National Battlefield in the Gettysburg National Military Park. The Battle is remembered both for Pickett's Charge and the "high water mark of the Confederacy" (considered by some to be the closest the Confederacy came to winning the war) as well as the turning point of the war that the failure of said charge and the overall offensive ultimately meant.

Terrain and climate[edit]
Flat meadows surrounded by rocky hills, with views of the Blue Ridge Mountains looming in the distance. In the countryside north of Gettysburg is the "Fruit Belt" of Pennsylvania with thousands of acres of apple and peach orchards and vineyards.
Gettysburg has a humid continental climate, with hot, humid summers and cold moist winters. Spring and Fall are mild and pleasant. Heavy winter storms occasionally strike the area, but these are fairly rare. Heaviest snowfall occurs during February and early March. Severe thunderstorms may occasionally hit the region, mostly in July and August.

Get around[edit]

Use caution when using these roads, as there may be many people walking or bicycling on these roads.  The speed limit throughout the park is 15 mph. When in your car, you may navigate by map or purchase a CD at several locations throughout Gettysburg that will orientate you to the battlefield.

By bus[edit]
Guided tours on buses are available. There are several different types of bus tours: one is with licensed battlefield guides (adult $30, child $19) and one is with headphone narration (adult $26, child $15).

By bike[edit]
If you have the time and have an average level of fitness, bikes can be rented and can provide an enhanced experience in the park. Cycling the major sites of the July 1-3 campaign can be completed in one day and allow you to experience battle lines and topography in a much more realistic fashion than car or bus.

By horse or carriage[edit]
The battlefield features NPS horse trails where you can either bring your own horse or book a battlefield tour on horseback with Confederate Trails of Gettysburg Guided Battlefield Horseback Tours https://confederatetrails.com . 2 hour guided battlefield tours and town history tours by Horse-drawn carriage or on foot are also a must do when visiting Gettysburg; walking and carriage tours can be booked with Horse Tours of Gettysburg's Victorian Carriage Company[dead link] Authorized by GNMP and use only Licensed Battlefield Guides.
