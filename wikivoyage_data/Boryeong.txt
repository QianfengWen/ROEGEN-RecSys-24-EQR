 Nampo Inkstone. Inkstone that is one of the four precious things for study of scholars was once as essential as computers are nowadays. Inkstones made in Nampo out of natural stone from the Sungju mountain were considered the most precious. As modern society influences in our life, inkstone is not used much and 60% to 70% of inkstones that are produced in Korea is made in Boryeong. So Boryeong is the main area for inkstone. The inkstone manufacturing in Nampo was designated as intangible cultural asset No. 6 in Chungcheongnamdo. 
 Ungcheon Stone. Osuk produced in Ungcheon is glossy and black like a feather of crow and the quality is excellent. So it is used as the material for various epitaph, tomestones, etc. As you trim the stone more and more, the black color becomes distinguished, and as you carve, the white color comes forth. Especially Osuk from Sungju mountain area is famous as the best quality in Korea and is the indigenous specialty of Boryeong. Boryeong is also famous for Chungsuk with blue color and Aesuk that is mainly used for religious purposes. 
 Marine products. Launce that is caught in the sea of Boryeong is regarded as having superior quality. Especially pickled launch that is caught in May and June, salted at the ratio of 8 to 2 and ripened has a unique taste. Due to the large tide in the area it takes longer time for oysters to grow and that allegedly gives them a better taste. 
 Agricultural Products. Western mushrooms in Boryeong and other mushrooms that are grow above an underground closed mine taste excellent, but on the other hand they are not durable. Grapes that grow along No. 21 national road from Nampo to Ungcheon has superior sweet taste and best nutrition. Especially, Sahyung grape from the Nampo area is famous for its very sweet taste. Masan area produces various edible greens such as seasoned aster. Especially, seasoned aster from Misan is popular thanks to its fragnancy and good taste.

Sleep[edit]
There are basically 3 kinds of accommodation available in Boryeong.
The most popular ones are motels. They are easy to be found because they are all over the place in this beach area. There are also many hotels. You can tell the difference between a motel and a hotel by the size of the building. Buildings that are more than 5 stories and larger in size are hotels. The quality of the room is not much different, but they have more facilities that customers can use such as spas, swimming pools and restaurants.
If you do not mind experiencing a Korean-style house for couple of days "minbak" (a private residence temporarily taking lodgers) is the one for you. In fact, there are more "minbaks" than any other accommodation, because for many people there, it's become another way to make a living.
