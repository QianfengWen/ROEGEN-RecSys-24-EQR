Moa is a town in the  Holguín Province in the eastern part of Cuba.


Understand[edit]
Moa is neither a fancy nor an in any way touristic town. It is mainly "famous" for its surrounding nickel mines, where many of the local people of Moa are employed. Most foreigners passing by or taking a stop at Moa are coming from or going to Baracoa.

Get in[edit]
The road between Moa and Baracoa is a potholed mess (you'll find your bus (or car or taxi) swinging back and forth to dodge them all, maybe occasionally leaving the road), and after the park it's even worse. However, as of December 2017, the road from Baracoa to Moa can be done in 1½ hr. The road is unpaved, but accessible. Along the way you will pass dirty nickel mines on red colored roads, a landscape most tourist officials probably do not want you to see.

By bus[edit]
Baracoa – There is at least one daily bus between Moa and Baracoa (~US$). The journey generally takes around 3 hr.
By colectivo[edit]
Sagua de Tánamo – There are shared taxis from Sagua de Tánamo for CUP30, which take about 30 min.
By car[edit]
From Baracoa, take the unpaved road towards Parque Nacional Alejandro de Humboldt and past the park. 

Get around[edit]
Walking is the best way to discover Moa. The well-known bici-taxis and regular taxis are however available as well.

See[edit]
There is not much to see in Moa, except for the surrounding nickel mines and the red dirt everywhere.

Sleep[edit]

20.664981-74.9519191 Miraflores (Islazul) (North west of the center). This shabby and worn-down hotel is probably the only tourist accommodation in town. It got air con, but don't expect toilet seats. The price includes a marginal breakfast. ~US$32/46 (low/high season). (updated Oct 2015)
20.6571-74.9431582 Casas Particulare (near the round-about in the center). At the river bridge there is a sign saying restaurant and accommodation. Probably the only cheaper option besides Miraflores. (updated Oct 2015)
