Konstanz[dead link] is a city in southern Germany. It lies on the border with Switzerland and on Lake Constance (Bodensee) between Obersee and Untersee, exactly where the river Rhine exits the lake. The city is split in two by the Rhine. Although the Rhine is the usual border between Switzerland and Germany, the historic part of Konstanz lies on the south ("Swiss") side of the Rhine and is more or less an exclave.


Understand[edit]
Konstanz has traces of civilization dating from the stone age and was settled by the Romans in about 50 CE. Konstanz was an important trade centre and a spiritual centre. At the council of Konstanz in 1414-1418, a papal election was held, ending the papal schism. Three popes went into the council (one from Avignon one from Rome one from Pisa) an entirely different person left as the single pope. The council was also the place where Jan Hus was burned despite an assurance of safe passage. Konstanz attempted to join the Swiss Confederacy in about 1460, but was voted down. Due to its proximity to Switzerland, Konstanz was not bombed during World War II and its historic old town remains intact. It is a historic city with a charming old town, and could be called the jewel of the region.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Konstanz has no commercial airport. The closest airports are:

Zurich Airport (Switzerland) (ZRH IATA). By car 1 hour to Konstanz. By train 1 to 1.5 hours to Konstanz. There is a direct train from Zurich airport to Konstanz once an hour, and another train with a connection in Weinfelden once an hour.
Friedrichshafen Airport (Germany) (FDH IATA). By car 1 hour to Konstanz (take the car ferry between Meersburg and Konstanz). By train approx. 2 hours to Konstanz. By boat approx 1 hour to Konstanz (take the train from Friedrichshafen airport to Friedrichshafen Hafen and get the Katamaran to Konstanz).
Stuttgart Airport (Germany) (STR IATA). By car 2 hours to Konstanz. By train 2.5 to 3 hours to Konstanz.
EuroAirport (Basel, Switzerland).  About 2 hours by car.  By train, 2 hours from Konstanz first to the Basel Bad Bahnhof (in Germany) then about 45 minutes by regular tram/bus to the airport via a transfer at the Basel SBB station on the Swiss side.
By train[edit]
47.6587649.1771671 Konstanz Hauptbahnhof (in the old town). This is the main train station. It's the last German stop before the Swiss border, and is therefore served by both German and Swiss trains. Hourly direct trains from Zurich Main Station (1hr 20 min) go via Zurich Airport. Zurich Main Station has excellent connections to the rest of Switzerland as well as Italy, Austria and France.   
The other train stations in Konstanz are in the city districts of Petershausen, Fürstenberg and Wollmatingen.
Most places around Lake Constance can be reached by train: Romanshorn, St. Gallen, Stein am Rhein and Schaffhausen can all be reached with a change in Kreuzlingen (which is the "Swiss suburb" of Konstanz, just across the border), whereas Friedrichshafen, Lindau and other German places around the lake require a change in Radolfzell and take a long time - the boat can often be quicker. Bregenz in Austria is best reached via Switzerland - change in Rorschach and St Margrethen.
To reach Konstanz from the rest of Germany is time-consuming. There are direct trains to Karlsruhe (3 hours on a scenic route through the Black Forest), but other connections require a change in Offenburg (for Frankfurt and cities further north), Radolfzell (Ulm, Augsburg, München and beyond) or Singen (Stuttgart).

By car[edit]
From Germany: from the A81, take the B33 into Konstanz.
From Switzerland: the A7 leads straight into Konstanz.

By boat[edit]
Possible from many cities on Lake Constance. The fastest connections are :

Car ferry from Meersburg, runs several times an hour from 06:00 until 24:00, and once an hour from 00:00 until 06:00. The crossing takes 15 min.
Katamaran from Friedrichshafen, runs once an hour from 06:00 until 19:00, taking around an hour.
Bodensee Schifffahrt runs several services across Lake Constance which may take longer, but include more cities. Apart from Meersburg and Friedrichshafen, the ferries to and from Konstanz call in. al. in Überlingen (1.5hr), Lindau in Bavaria (2hr) and Bregenz in Vorarlberg, Austria (4hr). The timetable is quite intricate and not all departures include all stops.

See[edit]
Landmarks[edit]
View from the Munster Cathedral tower
47.6633339.1763891 Konstanz Cathedral (Konstanzer Münster) (In the old town, at Münsterplatz). Construction completed on the North Tower in about 1100 AD. Built between 1100 and 1854, the church is a magnificent example of architectural styles of the centuries. Climb up the tower for a fantastic view of Konstanz and the Bodensee.   
 Art nouveau houses beside the lake, Seestraße (on the north shore where the lake meets the Rhine, just east of the train bridge). 
47.6797229.1805562 Bismarck Tower, Bismarksteig (in the Petershausen district). There are towers commemorating the first German chancellor Otto von Bismarck all over Germany. Konstanz's Bismarck tower is at the top of a grapevine-covered hill. There are benches and firepits at the base of the tower. It's a nice place to watch the sunset. There's a good view from the base of the tower and an even better one from the top. Adults €1.  (updated Nov 2021)
 Konzil (Council building) (at the harbour). This building was built in 1388 and originally used as a warehouse. From 1414-1417 the council of Konstanz was held here to resolve the three-way occidental schism (an earlier compromise attempt had not resolved the two rival claims, but instead produced a third). The Council was also where Czech reformer Jan Hus was burned as a heretic. The building contains a restaurant and concert hall, and is undergoing restoration work. 
 Rheintorturm and Pulverturm (Rhine entrance tower and Powder tower) (On the south shore of the Rhine, just downstream from where the lake meets the Rhine.). Remnants of the old city defenses. 
47.658739.170933 Schnetztor, Hussenstraße (at the south end of Hussenstraße in the old town). 14th-century city gate and tower, next to a bit of the old city wall.  
Miscellaneous[edit]

The men wear only the papal tiara and the crown, respectively. The statue refers to a short story by Balzac, "La belle Impéria".   
 Sculptures along the German-Swiss border (Along the border, next to the lake). Where there used to be a border fence, there is now a series of 22 sculptures representing the trumps of the tarot, the "Great Arkana". 
 The harbour. From the harbour on a clear day, you can see the Swiss and Austrian Alps across the lake. The harbour is a great place to see sailboats, catch a boat across the lake, sit in a beer garden, rent a paddle boat or mini motor boat, or relax in the park. 
 Niederburg district (north-west corner of old town). This charming district is the oldest part of Konstanz. It is made up of narrow streets and old buidings, sometimes more than 700 years old. On the first Friday of each month from May to October, the shops of Niederburg stay open late and there is music, flea market tables, and art in the streets. It's a very cozy atmosphere and worth a walk through.

Eat[edit]
Konstanz has a rich variety of all kinds of restaurants, cafes, bistros and bars. Due to the proximity of the Swiss border, prices are higher than in other cities (mentally add €2 to every main dish you are eating in other German cities).
In summertime most restaurants offer outside sitting and eating, in the evening hours it is hard to find a place, occasionally.
A yearly published magazine "Die Seezunge" covers many of the Konstanz eateries and is available in tabac shops and kiosks.
A good start to discover the Konstanz restaurant scene is to start at the central marketplace Marktstätte. Just north of the "Marktstätte" is the old fish market site Fischmarkt.
There are lots of very good "Dönerbuden" (kebap houses) in the city center selling this Turkish dish.
