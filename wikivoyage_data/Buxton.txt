Buxton Crescent and St Ann's Well in Buxton
Buxton is an ancient spa town in the Peak District, England. It is in the county of Derbyshire which is classified as part of the East Midlands but it is probably more associated with the North West of England. It is the main place for the High Peak Borough, for both administrative and for retail.
Buxton is known around the world for its bottled spring water which is marketed by the Buxton Mineral Water Company (owned by Nestlé Waters UK). During the summer months, the local economy benefits from an influx of tourists who visit the surrounding Peak District region. Buxton also plays host to a number of summer festivals which draw large numbers of visitors too.

By bus[edit]
High Peak buses provides services from a number of locations including Manchester Airport, Stockport, Matlock, Derby and Macclesfield.

By car[edit]
Buxton is not close to Britain's motorway network. However, it is a crossing point of some major trunk roads, such as the A6 from Both Manchester and Matlock, the A54 from Congleton, the A537 from Macclesfield, the A53 from Stoke-on-Trent and the A515 coming in from Derby and Ashbourne. Each route is very picturesque, but be wary of the A537, as it is rated as the road with the most “persistently higher risk” in the UK (as of 2017). Since all of these routes are high-level they are frequently affected by snow and ice in winter and subject to closure.

By plane[edit]
Buxton does not have its own airport, but is easily accessible from Manchester Airport (MAN IATA), via Skyline 199 bus or rail via Manchester (see getting there by train), and less easily East Midlands Airport (EMA IATA).
