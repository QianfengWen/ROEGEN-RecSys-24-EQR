Rosyth is a port in Fife in central Scotland. It was built from 1909 as housing for the workers at the Royal Navy dockyard so it's modern and industrial, with a population in 2016 of 13,780.  


Understand[edit]
"Garden city" was the concept
Dunfermline was effectively the capital of Scotland from the 11th century. It was reached from Edinburgh by the "Queen's Ferry" and a highway, later designated A823 / B980. The town grew rapidly to the east and south through 19th century coal-mining and other industry, and Rosyth and Inverkeithing were its main ports. In 1909 Rosyth was hived off to become a separate "garden city" or planned development along the highway from the ferry. Commercial shipping moved elsewhere, but Rosyth developed into a large Royal Navy base, with docks and various on-shore facilities. In 1964 the Forth Road Bridge opened, connecting with the M90 motorway north to Perth, and with a spur A823(M) for Dunfermline. These roads took the through-traffic off the historic highway and became the east and north boundaries of Rosyth. The Navy presence declined from the 1990s and large tracts of dockland and housing were transferred to civilian ownership; this process continues. From 2002 Rosyth was for few years a ferry port but this didn't prosper.

Get in[edit]
Rosyth docks
By road[edit]
Rosyth is 12 miles north of Edinburgh, follow M90 across the new Forth road bridge. (Cyclists must use the old bridge A9000). For the town, exit at junction 1C. For the navy base and industrial estate, exit at junction 1B immediately after the bridge.

By train[edit]
56.0454-3.42671 Rosyth railway station has trains every 30 min from Edinburgh Waverley via Haymarket (for airport), Dalmeny (for South Queensferry), North Queensferry and Inverkeithing, taking 30 min. These trains continue to Dunfermline, Cowdenbeath and Glenrothes. Change at Inverkeithing for trains along the Fife coast from Kirkcaldy, Leuchars (for St Andrews), Dundee, Aberdeen, Perth and Inverness. 
Rosyth station is north side of town by the A823(M) terminus. It's just a platform halt with ticket machines but no staffed office or toilets. There is ramp access to both platforms.

By bus[edit]
Stagecoach Bus X55 runs every 30 min from Edinburgh via the old Forth Bridge and Ferrytoll P&R, taking an hour to Rosyth and continuing to Dunfermline.
Bus 7 runs along the coast every 30 min from Leven via Kirkcaldy, Kinghorn, Burntisland, Dalgety Bay and Inverkeithing to Rosyth, and continues to Dunfermline.

See[edit]
56.0235-3.43141 Rosyth Castle, Murray Rd KY11 2XB. Closed. Ruin of a 15th-century tower house which fell derelict in the 18th. It was originally on a tidal islet in the Firth of Forth but became engulfed by land reclamation and navy docks. Eventually the Admiralty sold off this tract of dockland to civilian industry, and the castle remains an incongrous medieval islet amongst modern industrial units, trucks and cable drums. The interior is unsafe and closed off. In 2021 access to the exterior is also closed but you see enough from the street.   (updated Oct 2021)
The Forth bridges are prominent to the east: two road, one rail. The only one you can walk or cycle over is the old Forth Road Bridge, see North Queensferry.
56.03-3.4692 Rosyth Old Kirk was 12th century, part of the Monastery of Inchcolm (visited by boat trips from South Queensferry). It remained in use as a church to the 19th century, when its "morthouse" was built for secure storage for unburied bodies, as these were prize game for body-snatchers. (No, not Burke and Hare, their merchandise was fresher still.) The church now just a ruin on the coastal footpath.
56.033-3.483 Limekilns is where the coast upriver breaks free of dockland. Yet it's a good example of the little ports that were important to early modern industry in Fife, until shipping outgrew them and concentrated into fewer larger ports. Limestone, quicklime and fishing were its trades and a ferry plied across the Forth to Boness.
56.036-3.5034 Charlestown the next port has a massive bank of 18th century limekilns for production of quicklime. The village also exported coal and had ship-breaking yards. A block back from the coast, cottages are grouped around the green, a Georgian planned community.
Do[edit]
Rosyth Castle
Walk the Fife coastal path although Rosyth is frankly its ugliest section; use OS Landranger Map 65 "Falkirk". Coming from North Queensferry, follow B981 under the three bridges and inland to the junction. You may as well follow Milne Rd directly west through the dockland industrial estate, as swinging inland doesn't improve the view. This eventually leads you onto Caledonia Way and A985. 200 yards further west you turn south off the main road onto the path back down to the coast at Limekilns, and continue west via Charlestown and Torryburn towards Culross. See North Queensferry and Aberdour for the route east of the bridges.
Golf: see Dunfermline, Pitreavie GC is the closest.
