Wernigerode Castle in winter
Described by the German heath poet, Hermann Löns, as the "brightly coloured town by the Harz", Wernigerode is an attractive destination on the Holtemme river, nestling against the northern foothills of said mountain range.


Understand[edit]
Wernigeorde's charm — derived from its impressive medieval-era Old Town with its fascinating fairy-tale castle and rows of centuries-old timber-framed houses — have led to it becoming a popular waystop on two major tourist routes: the German Timber-Framed Road and the Orange Route, a German-Dutch holiday road. The town is also a good base for exploring the northern Harz on foot or by mountain bike.

History[edit]
Wernigerode is first recorded in 1121 when it was the seat of the medieval County of Wernigerode, a status it held until 1429. It was during that time, in 1229, that it was granted town rights. Wernigerode's heyday came during the 14th and 15th centuries as it grew wealthy through trading in cloth, beer and brandy. However, it suffered from plague epidemics in the 16th century as well as the ravages of the Thirty Years' War and fell into decline.
From 1645 to 1807, Wernigerode was the seat of the County of Stolberg-Wernigerode. At the end of the 18th century, the town's economy picked up again, this time based on tanning and the manufacture of cloth and linen. In 1815 it was absorbed into the Prussian Province of Saxony. During the Industrial Revolution, new metal and wood industries settling here. The railways arrived in 1872, the same year that the Harz's best known brewery, the Hasseröder Brauerei, was founded.
After the Second World War, Wernigerode fell on the East German side of the Inner German Border in the newly-created state Saxony-Anhalt. Wernigerode became part of the restored state of Saxony-Anhalt in 1990 after German reunification and did not take long to restore the beauty of its timber-framed town houses. Wernigerode has a population of about 35,000.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Wernigerode has two junctions (Wernigerode-Nord and Wernigerode-Zentrum) on the B 6, a motorway-like dual carriageway that runs along the northern edge of the Harz from west to east. The B 6 branches off the A 7 motorway near Goslar and the A 395 motorway from Brunswick to Vienenburg.

By train[edit]
51.8399910.7890631 Wernigerode railway station is on the Heudeber-Danstedt–Vienenburg line with two-hourly services that run between Hanover and Halle using the Harzexpress.
Wernigerode is also the main depot and terminus on the Harz Narrow Gauge Railways. Trains, including steam-hauled services, than run to various destinations in the Harz, including its highest mountain, the Brocken.
Tip: The HarzTourCard enables you to travel by bus, train and narrow gauge train (except trains to the summit of Brocken) as much as you like within three days. It costs €18 for a single card, €34.50 for a family.

By plane[edit]
Wernigerode is about 1 hr 15 min by car from Hanover airport and about 1½ hours from Leipzig airport.

Get around[edit]
51°50′2″N 10°47′6″EMap of Wernigerode
On foot[edit]
The vast majority of Wernigerode's important tourist sites are contained within the compact area of the old town, whose narrow cobbled streets aren't particularly amenable to motorized transportation. Walking is probably the most sensible way to get around.

By car[edit]
If you're staying in a further-flung area, your best bet is to leave your car at one of the several car parks or roadside parking meter bays near the centre.

By bus[edit]
The local public transport organization Harzer Verkehrsbetriebe (HVB) operates a municipal bus network throughout the city, consisting of four lines that converge on the 51.83508410.7843412 Rendezvous bus station, located at Ringstraße 31 in the centre of town. Regular buses run seven days a week, from roughly 06:00 until 19:00 on weekdays and 09:00 until 17:30 on Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays. From roughly 19:00 until 00:00, there's also more limited service courtesy of a night bus (Abendlinie). HVB's website includes a system map and schedules for each route[dead link].

See[edit]
The medieval town hall in Wernigerode
Wernigerode has a wealth of historic sights and curiosities. Without a shadow of doubt, though, its top sights are its preserved medieval castle overlooking the town and its splendid town hall. But wandering around its ancient, sometimes still cobbled streets, the tourist will come across rows of colourful timber-framed houses and oddities like the Leaning House and the tiny "Smallest House" in Wernigerode, as well as museums that reflect the town's history and culture.

Old fortifications[edit]
51.830310.7951 Wernigerode Castle (Schloss Wernigerode), Am Schloss 1 (follow the signs from the town centre). A walk around this striking medieval castle is well worth the effort of the climb from the town centre. There are numerous paths through the woods and grounds of the castle. A climb onto the Agnesberg hill behind it is rewarded with a view over the castle, the town, and the edge of the Harz mountains that many visitors simply miss. The more adventurous can make their way through the woods into the valley of Christianental, where there is a forest inn serving traditional German fare and a small wildlife park with deer, wild boar and birds of prey. The castle is now a museum which is open to the public - see "Museums" section below.   (updated May 2017)
51.8163410.7812972 Emperor Tower (Kaiserturm). 24 hours a day. This stone observation tower is not part of the town's old fortifications, though it certainly looks of a piece with the remaining medieval-era towers: named and dedicated in honor of Kaiser Wilhelm II, the Kaiserturm has stood since 1902 at the 478-m summit of the Armeleuteberg hill a short distance south of the town centre. From its top, you can enjoy breathtaking views of the castle and old town of Wernigerode and out to the high summits of the North Harz. Free.   
51.83162910.7910943 Half Tower (Halbschalenturm), north side of Burgberg between Nöschenröder Straße and Lindenallee. In the middle of a small park near the castle is another remnant of Wernigerode's medieval city wall: the semicircular shell of one of the old watchtowers (the side facing away from the castle is open) that was the object of a partial restoration in the 19th century at the request of Count Otto zu Stolberg-Wernigerode, and now is protected from the elements by a new slate roof. 
51.83245710.7816744 Western Gate Tower (Westerntorturm), Westernstraße at Ringstraße. This imposing tower, 38 m high, is first recorded in 1356 and acted as a toll gate. It was built in Early Gothic style and formed part of Wernigerode's city wall. 
Houses[edit]
51.83554110.7899565 Krummel House (Krummelsches Haus), Breite Straße 72. The Krummel House is another old, timber-framed building, now a restaurant, whose timberwork is beautifully decorated. It was built in 1674 by corn merchant, Heinrich Krummel. 
51.83265510.7843296 Leaning House (Schiefes Haus), Klintgasse 5. The Schiefes Haus is an old, timber-framed watermill, the present building dating to 1680 and built for the Guild of Clothmakers. It has subsided on one side because of the undercutting action of the mill stream over the centuries. The stream, which used to supply water to the mill and town, is no longer visible. Today the Leaning House is home to a local society. 
51.83391910.7817147 Oldest House (Ältestes Haus), Hinterstraße 48. Wernigerode's oldest house was built around 1400 as a plain post-and-beam structure. It is one of the few that survived the Great Fire of 1847. 
The smallest house in Wernigerode is now a museum; see below.
Elsewhere around the Old Town[edit]
51.83330710.784478 Medieval Town Hall (Rathaus), Marktplatz 1 (on the market place). Described as a "pearl of medieval timber-framed architecture" the town hall is stunningly beautiful and has dominated the town's market square since at least 1277. It used to be owned by the counts of Wernigerode and acted as a courthouse, and as a place of medieval entertainment including weddings. Guided tours are available and the cellars house a classic Ratskeller restaurant. 
51.832510.7834479 Old Mint (Alte Münze), Oberpfarrkirchhof 5. The Old Mint is one of the few remaining timber-framed buildings in Wernigerode from the 16th century. It has a stone base. Today it is home to the Harz Library and town archives. 
51.83471610.7955410 Orangery (Orangerie), Lindenallee 21. The old Orangery, with its pleasure garden (Lustgarten), was built between 1713 and 1719 by Count Ernest of Stolberg-Wernigerode and was supposed to be a miniature version of the Palace of Versailles. 
51.83669210.78883611 St. John's Church (St.-Johannis-Kirche), Pfarrstraße 24. St. John's Church is the oldest surviving church in Wernigerode and dominates the northwestern edge of the historic Neustadt. The oldest parts of the church - the west tower and transept - were built in the Romanesque style around 1279. Its original main hall was expanded in 1497 into a triple-aisled nave. The church underwent extensive restoration in the 19th century and, after being damaged in the air raid of 22 February 1944, was further restored during the post-war years. Especially impressive is the Gothic carved altar from 1415, the pulpit dating to the early 1600s and a sculpture of John the Baptist from around 1500. One of the portraits on the octagonal font is of the great reformer, Martin Luther. 
51.83333110.78442812 Town Fountain (Wohltäterbrunnen), Am Marktplatz (in the market square in front of the town hall). The ornate cast iron fountain in the market square was cast in 1848 in Ilsenburg in a neo-Gothic style. It was intended to commemorate those people who had worked for the good of the town.

The original Romanesque castle was built in the 12th century, but has been much altered over the years. Until they were dispossessed in 1945, it was the residence of the counts of Stolberg and, later, the princes of Stolberg-Wernigerode, but today it is a fascinating museum. The splendid, turreted stone and half-timbered castle has magnificent views over the town of Wernigerode. You can see the original state rooms that once hosted Europe's highest aristocracy. The castle appears very much as it was when the owners, the counts of Wernigerode, were dispossessed in 1945 and the rooms display many of their artefacts from paintings and books, to furniture and table settings.

Germany is renowned for its alcoholic spirits known as bitters, with their great variety of herbal and minty flavours, but the Harz has a particularly wide range of them, all made in local distilleries. Often sold in miniature bottles and drunk as chasers, the more widespread makes include Schierker Feuerstein and Brockenfeuer. 
 Christmas Market (Weihnachtsmarkt). Wernigerode's Christmas Market is especially atmospheric, thanks to its setting amongst the medieval town houses around the market square.
