Get in[edit]

To Enniscrone from Ballina is 20 min and from Sligo is just over an hour. The village bus stop is on Main Street, corner with Church Lane, by the hardware store.

See[edit]
O'Dowd's Castle at the east edge of the village is the shell of a 17th century mansion. Nearby is the equally scrappy ruin of Valentine's Church. Both were ruined by the invasion of 1798.
Cliff Baths are County Sligo's answer to Lisbon's Torre de Belém, a little white castle-cum-wedding cake perched on the beach, built in 1890. The building and baths within are long closed but you can get just as cold in the tide-filled pools outside.
54.29-8.961 Easky is a village 10 km northeast of Enniscrone on the coast road - the bus from Sligo comes this way. There are remains of another O'Dowd fortress, the turret of a 19th century signal tower, and an abbey and graveyard. Easky has pubs and accommodation.
Quirky Nights Glamping Village in 2016 laboriously transported a disused Boeing 767 here from Shannon Airport, where it had been abandoned by the bankrupt Russian airline Transaero. It was supposed to form the centrepiece of an offbeat accommodation complex: old buses, railway carriages, why not a hovercraft or funicular cabin. It got here, as you can see from the road by the caravan park, but the project flopped and the site is closed.
Do[edit]
Surfing here is relatively sedate and suitable for beginners.
Seaweed baths are available, see County Sligo#Do for a description.
Enniscrone Golf Club is southwest edge of the village. The Dunes championship course is 7033 yards par 73, Scurmore course is nine holes. Visitor day rates are €145 April-Oct and €50 Nov-March.
The Wild Atlantic Way is a coastal itinerary from Donegal to Kinsale in County Cork, 2500 km in all. The section from Sligo through Enniscrone to Ballina is self-evident.
Black Pig Festival is a week in late July. Various fun events and races, including racing on pigs, inspired by a legend of a giant pig chasing round the county until slain at Muckduff just south of the village. It was poisonous and couldn't be eaten. Dates for 2022, and the nature of any pigs' involvement, are tbc.
