Mödling is a city of 20,500 people (2018) in Lower Austria, on the southern outskirts of Vienna.


Understand[edit]
Mödling sits in the middle of the Vienna Woods (Wienerwald), at the foot of Mt. Anninger (653 m above sea level). From 1938 to 1954 it was the 24th district of Vienna, and only since 1954 has it been an autonomous city.
Mödling has had a turbulent history, but during the Biedermeier period (1815-1848), it was a favourite destination for painters, poets, and composers. Ludwig van Beethoven also enjoyed the city and spent some time here.

Get in[edit]
48°5′8″N 16°17′0″EMap of Mödling
By air[edit]
Vienna International Airport (VIE IATA) is 20 km away, however there is no longer a direct bus connection between the airport and Mödling, making it somewhat complicated to use public transportation. First you'll need to take the S-7 train to 48.19555616.3861112 Wien Rennweg, and from there take a regional train to Mödling. Both trains are timed to coordinate together and leave every 30 minutes. Use ÖBB's SCOTTY to look up train information online. The trip takes about 50 minutes and costs €7.80.

By train[edit]
48.0857216.2954011 Mödling Train Station (Bahnhof Mödling), Bahnhofplatz 10, ☏ +43 2236 225010. No international trains stop in Mödling. Travellers from the south will have to change trains in Wiener Neustadt; international connections can also be made at Wien Meidling or the main railway station in Vienna (Wien Hauptbahnhof). Connecting from Vienna's West train station (Westbahnhof) is more complicated, necessitating using Vienna's public transportation system to get to another train station (e.g. via U6 to Wien-Meidling station) offering service to Mödling. ÖBB's SCOTTY lists train information online. If you have a lot of luggage or don't want to travel at all by foot, the Mödling city bus (see listing below) leaves from directly in front of the train station.
