Taxis in Larissa, as everywhere in Greece are comparably cheap. You should not pay more than €4 if you hail a cab (silver colour) on the road to take you anywhere in the city. Taxi meters have two rates - rate 1 applies from 05:00 till 24:00, and rate 2, the double rate, from midnight to 05:00. Taxi fare fraud is not widespread but it still happens, so make sure the rate is correct. If you feel you have been overcharged, ask for a receipt (they are obliged to give one) and take the plate number, then phone the tourist police to report the driver on 171. Expect to pay €1 or €2 extra if you take a taxi from the bus station or the train station, and a surcharge if you call for a taxi service on demand.
