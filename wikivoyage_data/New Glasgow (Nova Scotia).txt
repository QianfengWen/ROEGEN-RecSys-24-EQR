New Glasgow is a town of 9,000 people (2016) in the Northumberland Shore region of Nova Scotia, Canada.


Understand[edit]
New Glasgow is divided by the East River (north - south), a tidal estuary with brackish (salt and fresh) water.

History[edit]
The George Street Bridge
Scottish immigrants, including those on the ship Hector in 1773, settled the area of the East River of Pictou during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Deacon Thomas Fraser first settled the area at the head of navigation on the East River of Pictou in 1784. The settlement was named "New Glasgow", after Glasgow in Scotland, in 1809, the same year its first trading post was developed.
The discovery of large coal deposits in the East River valley during the early 19th century resulted in New Glasgow, at the head of navigation, quickly developing into a manufacturing and port community.
In 1867, the Nova Scotia Railway opened its Eastern Line from Truro through New Glasgow to its terminus at the passenger and cargo wharf in Pictou Landing. In 1882 the Eastern Extension of the Intercolonial Railway was opened from New Glasgow to Mulgrave on the Strait of Canso, placing New Glasgow on the mainline between Cape Breton Island and the North American rail network.
Economic development in New Glasgow was driven by the steel industry in neighbouring Trenton (site of the first steel manufacturing in Canada), shipbuilding and shipping in Pictou and Pictou Landing, and coal mining in Stellarton and Westville.
In 1946, New Glasgow was the setting for an important civil rights case when Viola Desmond challenged racial segregation of New Glasgow's Roseland Theatre. In 2019, Desmond was featured on Canada's $10 bill.
New Glasgow became a service centre for the county during the late 20th century as shopping centres, retail and residential development was spurred by the construction of Highway 104.

Rainy and snowy cold winters and warm humid summers.

Do[edit]
The Sampson Trail is a popular walking trail that crosses the East River. Follow it along the water starting at the local marina and connecting the nearby town of Stellarton.
Beaches: It is within 10 minutes of the ocean. Melmerby Beach or Big Island Beach are great spots for all four seasons. The beaches are sandy and water temperate, making for a great day out in summer. In winter it’s great to see the ice and snow piled up along the beach as the ocean stretches out to the horizon.
Drive around the 'circle'.  From George Street Bridge, drive along Provost Street to the East River Road.  These leads to Foord Street (the main street of Stellarton) via Blue Acres.  Turn left onto Foord Street, and drive to Acadia Street turning right. Follow Acadia Street into Westville.  At the end of this road, turn right onto South Main Street of Westville.  Drive along this road for some time until you encounter a right turn onto George Street in New Glasgow again.
With all the nearby rivers and lakes, and the Atlantic Ocean, fishing or kayaking are popular. A local can let you know where you can find the best places, such Melmerby Beach. The downtown marina rents out kayaks in summer.
