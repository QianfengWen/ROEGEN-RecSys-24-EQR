Wadebridge (Cornish: Ponsrys) is a market town in North Cornwall, with a population of 7,900 (2011). The town sits at the Camel Estuary, 5 miles (8 km) upstream from Padstow. It is host to the Royal Cornwall Agricultural show, each June.


Understand[edit]
For many years Wadebridge was a traffic congested town but in 1991 the Wadebridge bypass was opened together with the Egloshayle bypass causing the two settlements to regain much of their former charm. The main shopping street in Wadebridge (Molesworth Street) has become pedestrianised through an inner link road, allowing traffic free shopping.
