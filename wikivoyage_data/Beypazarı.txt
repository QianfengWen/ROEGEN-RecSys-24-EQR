Beypazarı is a city in Central Anatolia in Turkey. With a population in 2020 of 48,732, it lies 100 km west of the capital Ankara, and is governed as a district of that city. 


Understand[edit]
The town is in a valley that has long been a trade and pilgrimage route between Constantinople / Istanbul and Ankara, and is now the route of Highway D140. It's the largest of a string of towns along that route, also briefly described on this page: west to east these are Nallıhan, Çayırhan, then Beypazarı and Ayaş. In Roman times Beypazarı was known as Lagania, meaning a rocky outcrop, but when the Roman emperor Anastasius I visited around 500 AD and was delighted with the place, his minions took the hint and renamed it Anastasiopolis. It fell to the Seljuks in the 12th century then the Ottomans: Gazi Gündüzalp the grandfather of Osman I, founder of the Ottoman dynasty, is buried here.
The Ottomans made this a cavalry base and renamed it Beypazarı, "the Bey's market". The valley has agriculture and they're particularly proud of their carrots, with a large phallic statue at the foot of the old town in case you'd overlooked this. The area is also industrial, with quarrying for ores such as soda for glass-making. The town has grown to sprawl several km southwest along the valley, but this hasn't disturbed the historic centre.

Bus 548 runs three times a day from Sincan, the west terminus of Ankara's metro railway and stop for YHT trains from Istanbul and Konya. It follows Highway D140 and takes two hours via Ayaş. 
Bus 577 runs five times a day from Ankara's main bus station AŞTİ via Ayaş to Beypazarı and continues to Nallıhan, another hour.
40.166831.92411 Beypazarı Otogarı the bus terminal is southeast side of town centre. The buses also stop at other intersections on D140.
Driving from Istanbul, it's simplest to stay on E89 to Sincan on the edge of Ankara then turn west on D140. You could also leave O-7 just past Adapazarı to take D140 east.

Get around[edit]
The old town is compact and walkable, but you need wheels to explore sights along the historic trade and pilgrimage route.

40.09802531.6723997 Çayırhan  25 km west of Beypazarı was another town on the old trade route: "-han" indicates a caravanserai. But the valley was flooded after Sarıyar Dam was built in 1956, so the present town is modern, relocated 3 km east, and its environs are industrial with ore mining. You can take a boat ride across the barrage lake to the scanty Roman ruins of Juliopolis.
40.105731.59838 Nallıhan Bird Reserve (Nallıhan Kuş Cenneti) is 33 km west of Beypazarı, near Çayırhan. It's a wetland in what was once an inland sea, but dried up until 1959 when Sarıyar barrage lake flooded the valley. There's a visitor centre and birdwatching hides. North across the lake, Mount Kıztepe is an eroded massif of brightly contrastingly rock layers, which tourist brochures call "Rainbow Hills".
40.18829531.3508719 Nallıhan  60 km west of Beypazarı was another stopover on the trade route. Its caravanserai Kocahan is now a food and souvenir market. Nasuhpaşa Mosque nearby is late Ottoman. The northwest corner of town, Akdere village, has many traditional buildings.
40.075131.39910 Emremsultan is a tiny village south of Nallıhan with the tomb and shrine of Tapduk Emre. His most famous disciple was Yunus Emre (1238-1328), the poet and Sufi mystic, who is buried some 50 km south at the village named after him.
