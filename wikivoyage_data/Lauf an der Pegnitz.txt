Understand[edit]
Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
There are two rail lines through town, one of them partially electrified and used by the S-Bahn Nuremberg, the so-called "left Pegnitz railway" ("left" and "right" refer to the direction of flow of the river) the other non-electrified and used by regional trains linking Nuremberg to Bayreuth and Hof, the "right Pegnitz railway". Accordingly the stations are named by the side of the river they sit on.
VGN[dead link] (Verkehrsverbund Großraum Nürnberg) has ample commections to Lauf, which has three stations, two of which are northwest and southeast of the city center respectively (Lauf rechts Pegnitz and Lauf Links Pegnitz), both in walkable distance. The trains are R3, R32 (Lauf (rechts Pegnitz), S1 (Lauf West, Lauf (lings Peg)).
