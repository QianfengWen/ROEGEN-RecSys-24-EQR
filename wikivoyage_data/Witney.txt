Understand[edit]
Those familiar with the writings of A. A. Milne, in particular Winnie-the-Pooh, might remember the game of "Pooh Sticks" from the book. The game is played on a bridge over a river and competitors drop their sticks in the river (at the same time) and see whose stick emerges downstream first. Childish fun, but these days the town hosts the annual World Pooh Sticks Championship. Organised by the Rotary Club of Oxford Spires and raising funds for the Rotary Club of Oxford Spires Charitable Trust Funds, it is held over the River Windrush close to the centre of town. There are both team and individual competitions, though advanced registration is required.
