Győr ([ˈɟøːr], German: Raab, Slovak: Ráb, Croatian: Jura Đura, Serbian: Ђер/Djerba) is a city in Western Transdanubia in Hungary. It is called A barokk városa (the Baroque City), because the old part of the city contains dozens of monumental buildings and sculptures from the 18th century.
It is the capital of Győr-Moson-Sopron county. The city is the sixth largest in Hungary, with around 129,000 inhabitants (2017).


Understand[edit]
Győr is in the northwestern part of Hungary, close to the Slovakian and Austrian borders in the middle of the 'Golden Triangle' between Bratislava, Budapest and Vienna. It is a good stop between Vienna and Budapest or Sopron and Budapest, and also a good base for day trips throughout almost the whole North Transdanubian region. It has very good train and bus connections, and the motorway that passes to its south enables easy travel to Vienna and Budapest.
The city is nicknamed A vízek városa or A folyók városa ("City of Waters" or "City of Rivers"), because Raab/Rába, Rábca, Mosoni-Duna, Marcal rivers melting here or nearby.
Győr is also home to one of the biggest engine manufacturing plants in Europe (over 400,000 units per year), which supplies most European Skoda, Audi and Seat car factories. The city centre is very well supplied with small restaurants, pubs, bars and most of the hotels are here or nearby.

History[edit]
Győr was founded around 450 BC by the Celts. The Romans settled there around the 1st century BC. After they abandoned the city, the Slavs eventually arrived around 500 AD. It was briefly part of Great Moravia and then the Kingdom of the East Franks. The Magyars came around 900 and survived the Mongol invasion of Hungary in the 1240s. During the Ottoman era, Győr saw much conflict and was captured by the Turkish Army for four years. At the end of the 17th century, it was a flourishing city. It achieved the status of 'free royal town', which helped to further improve the economy, trade and culture. During World War II, the local Jewish community was nearly wiped out and several buildings and factories were destroyed. In the 1950s and 60s, the Communist government built many block flats, and in the 1970s, the long process of restoring the Old Town began.
