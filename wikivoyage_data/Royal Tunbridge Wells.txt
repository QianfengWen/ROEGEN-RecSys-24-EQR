The Pantiles in Tunbridge Wells
Royal Tunbridge Wells is a town in west Kent on the border with East Sussex, in the South East of England.


Understand[edit]
Tunbridge Wells was founded in the 17th century following the discovery of the Chalybeate Spring in 1606. The waters from the spring were said to have restorative properties, and so Tunbridge Wells grew into a thriving spa resort town. Queen Victoria regularly travelled down from London to "take the waters", and in 1909 King Edward VII granted the town its "Royal" prefix (although this is rarely used by the inhabitants any more).

Visitor information[edit]

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Tunbridge Wells can be accessed from the north using the A21 trunk road, which runs as a dual carriageway for most of its length between the M25 and the outskirts of the town.  The A21 continues south past Tunbridge Wells to Lamberhurst and Hastings.
The single carriageway A26 runs through the town centre, providing a link to Brighton and Lewes to the south, and Tonbridge and the A21 to the north.
To the west, the A264 provides connections to East Grinstead, Crawley and Gatwick Airport.  To the east, the A264 becomes the A228 and links to Paddock Wood, Maidstone, Rochester and Strood.

By train[edit]
51.130.2631 Tunbridge Wells station is in the town centre at the bottom of Mount Pleasant Road, close to the historic High Street and 5 minutes' walk from the Pantiles. It is on the London (Charing Cross/Waterloo/London Bridge) to Hastings route; trains are operated by Southeastern, ☏ +44 8457 48 49 50.

Other Kent towns such as Canterbury, Ashford and Maidstone can be reached by train by changing at Tonbridge (10 minutes by train from Tunbridge Wells).

Hiking[edit]
 Tunbridge Wells circular walk. It makes a great day's hiking trip especially if you bring a picnic along. There are many entry and exit points on the footpaths so although the entire circular walk is 27.5 mi (44.3 km) you can easily do a much shorter hike starting and ending in the town itself. Many of the walks take you through pretty villages, atmospheric woodlands, farmland (and through livestock fields), past churches, along streams/rivers and past lots of pubs. You can grab a copy of a map with details of the different walks in the tourist information centre in the Pantiles. There is lots of wildlife around – including birds, livestock, snakes and lizards (if you're lucky!) If you want to do some camping there are several camping areas on route. (updated Dec 2023)
