Maerdy (Welsh: Y Maerdy) is a village of 3,200 people (2011) in Glamorgan. The area grew from a farming community to town around the coal mining industry and the development of Mardy Colliery in the late 19th century, but its last pit (Mardy Main) shut in 1990.  By the time of the Miners' strike in the 1980s, Maerdy was the location of one of the last working mines in the south Wales valleys, and the pictures of the returning miners once the strike was resolved was one of the defining moments of late 20th century Welsh history.

A newer, updated war memorial has been erected adjacent to the Colliery memorial with the names of all the soldiers who died in World Wars I and II.
In 2017, a memorial, known locally as the ‘Maerdy Gateway’ was created at the foot of the mountain road leading to neighbouring Aberdare. It consists of a pitwheel and a statue of a miner holding a child, wrapped in a traditional Welsh shawl, in memor and recognition of the area's booming coal industry.
