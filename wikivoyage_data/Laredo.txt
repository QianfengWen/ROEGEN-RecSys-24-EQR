The twin cities of Laredo and Nuevo Laredo, founded in 1775, are situated on the banks of the Rio Grande. Laredo has been governed under seven national flags. Nuevo Laredo has a burgeoning population of 374,000 (2010). The twin cities are collectively referred to as Los Dos Laredos.

Non-U.S. citizens are recommended to carry their immigration documents with them even if they do not plan on crossing the border into Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. There are check points on your way back from Laredo where you might be asked to show your immigration documents.
Non-U.S. citizens having a valid U.S. visa who decide to cross the border and enter Mexico should be prepared for a long wait at the CBP detention center/check post to get back into U.S., even with all the necessary documentation. It might not be a pleasant one, but can be minimized by crossing at off hours or by using alternative crossings, such as the Colombia bridge.
