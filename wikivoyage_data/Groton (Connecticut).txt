Do[edit]
Holiday Bowl-

Buy[edit]
Eat[edit]
 Koto Japanese Steak House, 527 Long Hill Road. Although the name implies a steak house it is similar to Benihana in the Teppenyaki side of the house. But, where the place really shines is their sushi. The chef is a Japanese national who is very skilled and quite innovative at making sushi. They regularly import fish from Japan and it is fantastic. It rivals some of the best NY sushi restaurants and by far exceeds anything in the area. 
 The Wokery, 507 Route 184, ☏ +1 860 448-3336. Chinese/Japanese.
