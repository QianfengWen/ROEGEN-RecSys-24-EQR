-36.9296144.70471 Pink Cliffs, 68 Pink Cliffs Rd. A whole area near Heathcote was mined for gold by eroding the area with high pressure water, using a water race from a nearby supply. The result 100 years later is an area that resembles a moonscape, with craters and cliffs eroded originally by the miners, and subsequently by the wind and rain. A 2-km loop walking track covers the whole area. Admission is free, and interpretive signs explain the history at the various points of interest. (updated Apr 2024)
