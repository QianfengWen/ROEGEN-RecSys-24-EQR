Alajuela is a city in the Central Valley of Costa Rica, near San José.

Fountain in Parque Central Alajuela

Understand[edit]
There is not very much to see in the city itself, but Alajuela is an excellent spot for beginning and ending a trip in part due to "San José" Airport being here.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
9.993889-84.2088891 Juan Santamaria International Airport (SJO IATA) (only 2-3 km from the center, walkable). Alajuela is cheaper and quicker to reach from the airport than San Jose. A cab ride into the center of town costs only around US$5, as opposed to US$25 to San Jose.   
By train[edit]
10.00852-84.209012 Alajuela Train Station. A train aimed mostly at commuters goes three times in the morning and twice in the evening to/from San José (Costa Rica) with an intermediate stop in Heredia. The station was inaugurated in 2016 and there are plans to expand service if and when demand rises. Although the rail line passes by the airport tantalizingly close, there is thus far no direct service to the airport, necessitating you to find some way to traverse those two kilometers of distance if you want to combine train and plane.

From San José (Estación Alantico) tickets are ₡1,005 (April 2020).

Get around[edit]
Map of Alajuela
On foot[edit]
Alajuela is small enough to take in by foot. You can see the entire downtown in one afternoon.

By bus[edit]
There are lots of public buses that criss-cross the city or travel to nearby towns. There are two main bus companies, TUASA and Station Wagon, that provide service between Alajuela and the capital, San Jose. The buses are cheap, less than US$1, and run every few minutes. There are also buses that depart to other nearby towns like Sarchi, San Ramon, Heredia, and Poas. Also, you can catch buses to farther destinations that regularly travel through Alajuela on the way to Pacific destinations.

By car[edit]
Taxis are often the easiest and a cheap way to get around the town. Taxies are red and there are many taxi stands scattered around the city. While the orange airport taxies will accept US dollars, the red taxies will only accept colones. Tipping is not expected, but you can let a taxi driver keep the change.

See[edit]
10.016636-84.2133741 The Central Cathedral. Alajuela's Central Cathedral is the very center of the town as is traditional in colonial Spanish urban planning. The church is pretty, but not a spectacular piece of architecture. In front of the cathedral is the central park which is a nice spot for people-watching and you may get a glimpse of wildlife such as parrots and a sloth that is an elusive resident. 
10.017799-84.2090562 Iglesia La Agonía. Five blocks east of the Central Cathedral, this landmark church has an ornate Baroque style, even though it was built in 1941. 
10.01493-84.213523 Parque Juan Santamaría. Alajuela is the hometown to Juan Santamaría, the Costa Rican National Hero. Around the city you can see the location of his home, although now there is just a small plaque and garden as the house in long gone. A block south of the Central Park is the Juan Santamaría park with a statue of the hero and a small collection of 1860s-era cannons.  
10.017019-84.2143454 Museo Histórico Cultural Juan Santamaría. A block north of the Central Park is the Juan Santamaría Museum, which shows some era pieces explaining the legacy of Juan Santamaría and the 1856 campaign against the filibuster invaders led by U.S. Southerner William Walker, who finagled their way into the Nicaraguan presidency and wanted to take control of Central America. Free to enter.  (updated Mar 2022)

 Liga Deportiva Alajuelense (Fútbol). Alajuela is home to Liga Deportiva Alajuelense ("La Liga") soccer club. It is a powerhouse in the Costa Rican soccer league and is regularly ends first or second in the Costa Rican First Division. The Morera Soto Stadium is very close to downtown and tickets are usually inexpensive. While the Alajuela crowd will be enthusiastic, Alajuela does not suffer from hooliganism, thus taking in a game is appropriate even for single women and families.   (updated Mar 2019)

Sleep[edit]
Budget[edit]
There are small hotels and hostels catering to budget travelers. However, they tend to be somewhat overpriced due perhaps to the city's proximity to the international airport.

10.011023-84.2190521 Habitationes con excelente ubicaion. Proper family-run guesthouse. The area does not to seem to be the safest, but just be a little curious. Double ~US$25. (updated Mar 2019)

10.014027-84.2143583 Alajuela Backpackers Hostel, Calle 4 Avenida 4. The only real downside to this place is that bizarrely the booking engine on its own website doesn't work and pre-booked rates are a lot cheaper than booking at the hostel. So you'd have to book through an aggregator. The rooms are cozy and clean, the view from the rooftop bar/restaurant is amazing even though the prices are on the high side and there's a free airport shuttle. From US$10 for a dorm if pre-booked online. (updated Sep 2018)
