Understand[edit]
A typical Falu red-colored cabin, with a view of Lake Siljan.
As the rest of Siljansbygden, Tällberg is considered an archetype of Swedish folk culture.
Tällberg traces its historical roots to the middle ages, and is mentioned in written sources as early as 1320. The name comes from the Swedish words "Tall", which means pine tree, and "Berg", which means mountain, and translates into "the pine covered mountain".
In the early 20th century it became a summer residence of several notable Swedish cultural figures, including the artists Gustaf Ankarcrona, Ivar Nyberg and Gabriel Burmeister, the mathematician Gösta Mittag-Leffler, as well as the composer and director Hugo Alfvén. In 1914 Tällberg Train Station was constructed, facilitating communications and thereby consolidating Tällbergs status as a tourist destination. In the 1920s the village consisted of some 50 farms, and a dozen typical Dalcarlian villas.
Today the village has some 200 permanent residents, plus another 400 holiday cottage owners. The village has remained a popular tourist destination with eight hotels and guesthouses, offering a total of about 1500 beds, and servicing  a quarter million visitors annually. It is one of few places in Sweden which only consists of traditional wood buildings, most of them painted in the classical Falu red color. Between 2005 and 2013 it hosted the annual international conference Tällberg Forum.
