Saint-Siméon is a parish municipality in Chaleur Bay, in Gaspésie, in the east of Quebec. The local community is mostly made up of Acadians.


Understand[edit]
Saint-Siméon is a riverside community on the north shore of Chaleur Bay (Baie-des-Chaleurs). It is made up of three villages: Saint-Siméon-Ouest, Saint-Siméon and Saint-Siméon-Est; in addition, there is the hamlet of the 2nd row East and that of the 2nd row West. The majority of residents live near Route 132. The northern part of the municipality is mainly forested, thus allowing several recreational tourism activities related to forestry. The territory of Saint-Siméon is crossed from north to south by the Saint-Siméon River; near its confluence with Baie-des-Chaleurs, a strip of land (about 300 m long) parallel to the coast causes the course of the river to bend to the east.
Its picturesque and modern character attracts vacationers.
