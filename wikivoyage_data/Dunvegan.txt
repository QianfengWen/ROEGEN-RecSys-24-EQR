Ancestral home of the Chiefs of Clan MacLeod for 800 years, built in the 13th century but much altered and prettified in the 19th. The "Fairy Flag" is an ancient silk heirloom, steeped in hoaky legend and tenuously-connected miracles; it's probably from Syria and may date back to the Crusades, though family tradition puts it much earlier. Other heirlooms are the Dunvegan Cup, dating to 1493, and Sir Rory Mor's Horn which may be 10th-century Norse. Adult £16.50, conc £13.50, child £11.50.   (updated Jun 2024)
57.4354-6.57932 Giant MacAskill Museum. July-Aug Th-M 10AM-5PM. Small museum about a giant (an ancestor of the owner) from Berneray. "Giant MacAskill", Angus Mor MacAskill (1825-1863) was known as the world's largest "true" giant (with normal proportions and no growth abnormalities), reaching a height of 7 ft 9 in. He moved to Stornoway then Canada, and never lived on Skye. Adult £2.   (updated Jun 2024)
St Mary's church is a ruin at the main village junction.

57.4241-6.59675 Dun Osdale is another broch. It's not deliberate camouflage, but you could easily mistake it for a heather-clad natural knoll as you drive past towards Colbost.
See Colbost for sights further west on that road, which ends at Neist Point Lighthouse.
