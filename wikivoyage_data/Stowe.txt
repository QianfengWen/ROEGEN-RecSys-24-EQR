Most of the activity in Stowe is centered in the historic Village and along the Mountain Road (Route 108) that extends from the Village about 5 miles to the ski area. It is easy to get around, and in the winter there is a free shuttle that runs frequently between the Village and the Mountain.

Nearby, Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream Factory, Cabot Cheese Outlet and the Cold Hollow Cider Mill are on many people's lists of favorite stops. Stowe has many photo opportunities: covered bridges, hiking trails, a river winding through town, mountains and of course brilliant fall foliage.

Made famous by "The Sound of Music" and still owned and operated by descendants of the beloved musical's real-life von Trapp family, this is a must-see when visiting Stowe, not least for one of the area's most-scenic views. In the winter, the public can enjoy cross-country skiing. In summer, concerts in the Trapp Family Meadow are popular with visitors and locals. Inside, the sprawling lodge is decorated with vintage memorabilia from the family's singing career (though little from the Broadway musical and smash-hit film that made them internationally famous, which the von Trapps felt unfairly portrayed their beloved patriarch as a cold disciplinarian).

Buy[edit]
There are lots of unique shops in Stowe; there are no chains or outlets in Stowe which is part of its charm. The retail shops are mixed in with restaurants, coffee houses, inns, offices and homes. Many of the buildings are old and interesting just to walk through.
There are no big parking lots, so you won't be trying to remember which row and section your car is in. Retail shopping is on both sides of Main Street which is also known as Route 100. More shops are spread out along the Mountain Road, or Route 108. Mountain Road forms a "T" with Main Street.
