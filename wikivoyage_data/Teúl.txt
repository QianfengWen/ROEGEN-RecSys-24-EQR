Teúl is a small town with a long history in southwestern Zacatecas, Mexico. The town has been continuously occupied since 200 BC, though the history of its occupation is filled with holes and mystery. Visitors enjoy the colonial town center with its stone walls and cobblestone streets almost as much as they enjoy sampling the locally made mezcals. The town has been designated as one of Mexico's Pueblos Mágicos.


Understand[edit]
The town's official name is Teúl de González Ortega in honor of Jesus Gonzalez Ortega, a 19th century army general who was supposed to have succeeded Benito Juarez as president, but through nefarious political machinations, he was thwarted. Gonzalez Ortega was born in Zacatecas and is a former governor of the state. The town is quite small with a population of about 5,500 (2020).

Origins of Teul[edit]
At the time of the Spanish conquest, Teul was inhabited by the Caxcan indigenous people, though they inhabited the town only since the early 14th century. The original builders are not known, but are suspected to have been Chichimeca people who gave up their nomadic hunting lifestyle for a more settled, sedentary lifestyle. 

Teúl Archaelogical Zone[edit]
Ruins of Teul
Looming over the town is the Cerro de Teúl, a large rounded hill on which the ancient ruins sit. Although the site covers an area of 150 hectares, only 6 hectares have been explored, documented, and opened to the public. The site is thought to have been a manufacturing center, primarily producing copper. 
The site includes two pyramids, a ballcourt, a circular altar, and a sunken patio area with several burial sites. The most significant structure is an intact copper smelter built of stone and masonry which has been dated at 800 years old. The site is administered by INAH and an app for the site is downloadable for Android phones.
