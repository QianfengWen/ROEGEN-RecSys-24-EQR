Dalat: "Le Petit Paris"
During the colonial era, Da Lat (Đà Lạt), also Dalat, in the South Central Highlands of Vietnam, was the playground of the French, who built villas in the clear mountain air to escape the heat and humidity of the plains and coastal areas.


Understand[edit]
Dalat looks somewhat like a cross between Vietnam and rural France. Many of its hotels and houses are built in a European/French style. The city spreads across a series of pine-covered hills, with a small lake in the centre and surrounded by a man-made lake and higher peaks, making for some lovely scenery quite different from the rest of Vietnam. Temperatures are pleasantly warm by day, and cool at night, down to perhaps 10°C.
Dalat is surrounded by some of the best mountain biking, hiking and canyoning opportunities in Vietnam, with hills of coffee and tea plantations, which evoke images of the colonial hill stations of the north of India.
Dalat's high altitude (1,500–2,000 m) and fertile landscape make it one of Vietnam's premier agricultural areas, producing varieties of fruits, vegetables, tea, coffee, and flowers that don't grow in the lowlands. In markets as far north as Hanoi and Haiphong, vegetable and flower vendors will tout their "grown in Dalat" produce.
Dalat is a favorite destination for company-sponsored weekend outings, family getaways, and honeymooners.

By bus[edit]
Most local and foreign travelers arrive in Dalat by bus, including those traveling on the famous Sinh Cafe Hanoi-HCMC open-tour buses.
Phuong Trang Busline runs several daily services to Dalat from Nha Trang and Ho Chi Minh City. From Nha Trang the bus ride is about 5 hours, with the obligatory stop at a dilapidated Cham temple/tourist site. From Nha Trang, the travel time to 3–4 hours, including a 30-minute breakfast/WC stop about one hour out of Nha Trang. From Ho Chi Minh City the bus ride is about 7 hours (9 hours if there is bad traffic leaving Saigon). If coming from Mui Ne, be careful as the road is rough most of the way, so try to book a large bus or at least a seat towards the front.
From Mui Ne:
 An Phu Travel. 07:30, afternoon. 2 buses a day. It's not too comfortable seater bus but still ok. Tickets can be booked in most hotels and guest houses. They have free pick up. Journey takes 4-5 hours and includes some great views. Drop off in Dalat: Nguyen Chi Thanh street, close to the city center. USD5. (updated Mar 2018).
 The Sinh Tourist. The bus tickets are available online on baolau (updated Mar 2018).
From Danang - Danang Central Bus Station, sleeper bus from Danang to Dalat with air-cond, toilet on bus, departs from Danang at 17:00 and arrives Dalat at 08:00 - 09:00 (15 hours), it costs 265,000 dong/ticket, you may come directly to the Bus Station or online booking via email danangdalatbus@gmail.com.

Alternatively, catch a local bus at Ho Chi Minh City, Bien Hoa, Phan Rang, Nha Trang or Buon Ma Thuot.

By motorbike[edit]

Motorbikes are also a good choice for adventurous travelers who like to travel in an experiential style and save money. From Saigon to Da Lat is about 300 km, it takes about 7 – 10 hours if traveling by motorbike. Although it takes quite a long time, these will be quite interesting experiences, as well as help you discover many beautiful scenes along the way. A legit motorbike driving license is required to rent a motorbike in Vietnam.

Get around[edit]
Depending on where you stay, you can walk to most parts around town. You can catch a xe om (motorbike taxi) from most corners, so if you're going somewhere farther out of town, you have a fast way to get there. You can also book via app using Grab Bike. Taxi cars are also abundant and reasonable in price, yet watch the meter, as meter fixing is a common practice from north to south. As of July 2018, meter-fixing is a much diminished problem and almost all taxi meters click into life after the vehicle has traveled a few metres. The occasional taxi may take you on a circuitous route to get to your destination but opening Google maps and pointing out that you know the way reduces incidents of this kind. Taxis are cheap and an ideal way to get round Dalat.
There is a local bus which passes near most of the main tourist sites. Heading south you can catch it at the bus shelter by the lake. Otherwise, the bus hub can be found on Hoa Binh Square (Khu Hoa Binh - behind Hoa Binh theater), just up from the market. The last bus each day is at 17:30.
There are many places around town to rent a bicycle, tandem, or motorbike. Please consider carefully before you rent a motorbike, as according to the Vietnamese law you must be in the possession of a valid Vietnamese driver's licence to be able to drive a motor vehicle in the country. Failure to have one cancels any insurance that the bike might come with and makes you liable for any damages. In Southeast Asia, you are always liable, as you are always guilty, as you are presumed to have more money than the other party. Hence you will have to pay for damages to the bike and its full value, damages to other people and their property, as well as ruining your holiday.

Most visitors to Dalat are Vietnamese, and most of them leave loaded with stuff. What they like to take home is dried and candied fruits, strawberry preserves, coffee, green and artichoke tea, local wine, dried venison, orchids, strawberries, avocados, and other fresh produce. If you take any sort of organized tour, chances are you will be off-loaded for a half hour at a shop selling these items. Local treats are also for sale in abundance in the large central market in the area around Nguyen Thi Minh Khai and Le Dai Hanh. Partly covered and partly outdoors, the market has dozens of small stalls selling fruits and vegetables, clothing, and a variety of other goods. There is a supermarket on the top floor selling necessities for travellers. Strolling around the market is a favourite evening activity, and every night it buzzes with thousands of visitors.
Dalat does not offer lot of high-end handicrafts of the sort favoured by overseas tourists. Dalat is famous, however, for its beautifully crafted silk embroidered pictures, which can be purchased at a massive mark up from the many galleries around Dalat or at a fraction of the price from the central Dalat market.
