Perugia's MiniMetro
Perugia is a large hill town. Most major attractions are at the top of the hill in the Centro Storico (historic centre). It is almost impossible to access the Centro Storico by car unless you have a confirmed hotel booking. Even outside the very centre you will drive very slowly over the many cobblestoned one-way streets and may very well end up driving around in circles several times as traffic signs are very confusing. Do as little driving as possible, and get around on foot. The main car park for tourists is at Piazza Partigiani. From there you can take a series of escalators (hopefully most of them will be working!) up into the old town. There are lots of interesting things to see on the way up as the route was dug through the Rocca Paolina, a medieval citadel. More details about car parks (in English) can be found on this website.
Buses also go to the top, ticket costs €1.50, when bought in a ticket office, and €2 from a driver. The railway station is, inevitably, some distance from the hilly center, but buses are easily available.
Perugia has MiniMetrò - a small, driverless train that every two minutes or so takes you from a car park (Pian di Massiano) near the football stadium, or from the main train and bus stations to the center of town; a single ticket is €1.50 (May 2019). These trains stop running at around 21:00.
Within the central area getting around on foot is best, although some of the hills can be a bit steep and you will need to be fit.

The region around Perugia


Underneath Perugia
43.10833312.3880561 Rocca Paolina. It was a Renaissance fortress, built in 1540-1543 for pope Paul III to designs by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger. The escalators from the lower town lead up through the remains of this fortress. It was built on top of medieval streets, which were used as foundations, and before coming out into daylight at Piazza Italia you go through some of these medieval streets covered with brick ceilings when the fortress was built. Little now remains of the fortress itself. Free admission.   (updated May 2019)
43.1082512.3888332 Porta Marzia (Marzia Gate). This is an Etruscan city gate built in the 3rd century BC and much later incorporated into the city walls. It is close to the remains of the Paolina Fortress. (updated Jan 2016)
43.11213912.3888333 Fontana Maggiore. This large medieval fountain is found between the cathedral and the Palazzo dei Priori. It was made between 1277 and 1278 by Nicola and Giovanni Pisano as part of Perugia's celebrations of its independence. On the twenty-five sides of the basin are sculptures representing prophets and saints, the work of the seasons, signs of the zodiac, Bible scenes and events from Roman history. (updated Jan 2016)
43.112512.3888894 Perugia Cathedral (Cattedrale di San Lorenzo). This has an unusual layout for Italian churches in that the side rather than the front entrance faces the main square. There have been many churches on the site: this one was last worked on around 1490. But finished it was not, as can be clearly seen from the unfinished façade facing the square. This side includes the Loggia di Braccio, an early Renaissance structure. Under it a section of Roman wall and the basement of the old bell tower can be seen. Also found here is the 1264 Pietra della Giustizia ("Justice Stone") with which Perugia announced that it had repaid its public debt, a not inconsiderable feat. Also noteworthy is the external pulpit from which Saint Bernardine of Siena, a virulently anti-homosexual priest, would preach. (updated Jan 2016)

Do[edit]
Just walking around. There is probably no city in the world that better rewards the casual explorer in the sheer variety of its streetscapes. You can stroll along a Roman aqueduct that connects two of the city's hills, passing doors on the third stories of homes to peer over the edge at the doors at street level below. You can walk along the Via delle Volta della Pace, which follows the Etruscan city wall, but is now wholly arched over by a Gothic portico. You can stumble along cobbled streets that have the unique combination of slopes interrupted by small steps that only Italians seem to master. The wide, traffic-free Corso Vannucci, named after the painter known as Il Perugino, is what really makes Perugia. You can loll with the students from the International University on the steps of the Cathedral at one end or amble down the Corso from those steps to sit on a bench at the other end and look over Umbria's hills as the sun sets.

Eat[edit]

For most tourists, the center, or downtown, of Perugia will be the most rewarding place to eat either lunch or dinner. The main street 'walk' begins at the Piazza Duomo at the Fontana Maggiore and ends with a dramatic view that showcases the city's churches and the Umbrian countryside. There are many dining options along this street. The last hotel on the right hand side (43.108412.387411 Hotel Brufani) before reaching the viewpoint offers five-star accommodation and regional dishes, specializing in legumes and fantastic olive oils. At the other end of Corso Vannucci, just to the right of the cathedral, is a charming pizzeria, La Mediterranea.
