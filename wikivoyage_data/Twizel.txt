Twizel is Mackenzie Country's largest town in the Canterbury region of New Zealand's South Island. Although it's the largest town in Mackenzie Country, it's well-visited as it's the closest decently-sized town near Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park.


Understand[edit]
The town of Twizel emerged as a workers' settlement during the construction of hydroelectric power stations in the Waitaki River region. Today the town's industry is on tourism. It's not just the nearby Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park that attracts visitors, it's also the nearby glacial lakes and reservoirs such as Lake Ruataniwha and Lake Benmore, which are popular with water sports enthusiasts, especially rowers.

The easiest way to get in otherwise is via State Highway 8, the only highway passing through the town. It is about 60 km southwest of Lake Tekapo and 30 km north of Omarama. The road is very much in good condition with a 100 km/h limit the entire way with little to no narrow bridges.
