Bardsey Island (Welsh: Ynys Enlli) is 1.9 miles (3.1 km) off Aberdaron, on the Llŷn Peninsula in the Welsh county of Gwynedd. To the south the island is the lighthouse, visible from most of the North Wales coast. The island has been an important religious site since Saint Cadfan built a monastery here in 516 and so became a major centre of pilgrimage. A bird observatory was established in 1953. There are regular boat trips to and from the island.
