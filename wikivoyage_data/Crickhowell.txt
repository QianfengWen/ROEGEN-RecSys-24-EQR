Crickhowell bridge
Crickhowell (Welsh: Crug Hywel, Crughywel, or Crucywel) is a small town in Powys, Wales. The name Crickhowell is taken from that of the nearby Iron Age hill fort of Crug Hywel above the town. The town has a population of around 2,800 people.
Today, Crickhowell is a popular tourist destination. In 2005 a Tourist Information centre was built in the centre of town and during summer the town is notably busier. Most people visit Crickhowell to see the Black Mountains and the Brecon Beacons, and maybe enjoy some mountain-biking, camping, hillwalking, rock climbing, fly-fishing, hang-gliding, caravanning or simply tour the area by car staying at Bed-and-breakfasts.
