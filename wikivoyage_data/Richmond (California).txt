Not to be confused with the Richmond district in San Francisco, California.

Though it was a booming industrial center during World War II, the subsequent decades were not kind to Richmond, California. Its thriving shipyards gave way to blight, and a reputation for violent crime kept visitors away. But in the 21st century crime has gone down, and a revitalization has begun. Richmond still isn't on any tourism shortlists, but its historic sites, nature, and strategic location between the East Bay and Marin County do attract some interest to this often-overlooked part of the San Francisco Bay Area.
Areas of note include the charming and historic Point Richmond neighborhood on the bay in the southwest of Richmond, as well as the World War II sites at the southern edge of the city. This article also covers Richmond's near-enclave of San Pablo.

A fairy house in Little Point Richmond


“


Little Point Richmond is on this street
We are shy so we may not meet
When you come near we fly away
But our little homes are here to stay
Search with an open heart and mind
And see how many houses you can find

Stay safe[edit]
Richmond has a reputation for high levels of crime. The safest parts of Richmond consist of Marina Bay and Point Richmond south of I-580, the Hilltop area north of San Pablo and much of East Richmond on the other side of I-80 or San Pablo Avenue at the most.  Areas to exercise caution, and to avoid at night, are the Iron Triangle and Central Richmond near Cutting, McDonald and Barrett Avenues.  These regional segments of Richmond are the reason behind its horrible reputation. In fact, the city used to rank with Compton as one of the worst cities in California statistically when it came to crime rate.  However, these days it's a lot safer, even if it's not the most well-to-do city in the Bay.
