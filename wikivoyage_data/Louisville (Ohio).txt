Get around[edit]




Do You Hear What I Hear?
If you happen to hear an approaching train while in town, the best advice is to stay where you are.  The tracks cross over Main Street and Chapel Street, the two main roads, and the entire town practically "shuts down".  Traffic, especially on Chapel Street, can get backed up more than a mile.


Just about everything in Louisville is within walking distance of Louisville/Main Street (SR 153) and Chapel Street/Ravenna Avenue (SR 44).  Parking is limited on Main Street, but most businesses have a few spots behind them.  There is also parking available in the Giant Eagle parking lot.
