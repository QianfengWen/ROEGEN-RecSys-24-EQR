One of Australia's highest towns is often an overlooked one. Perched at 1,017 metres, Adaminaby in the lower Snowy Mountains of New South Wales is both a town of success and failure. It used to be one of the most successful towns created as part of the Snowy Hydro Scheme, but was entirely submerged and had to be relocated due to the creation of Lake Eucumbene.
