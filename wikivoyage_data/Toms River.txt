Toms River is the county seat of Ocean County, New Jersey. It is a few miles west of the beaches of the Jersey Shore Region, midway between New York and Philadelphia and a short distance from Atlantic City. Toms River is easy to get to by car as the Garden State Parkway bisects the town, and it is served by express bus service to and from New York City.


Understand[edit]
The body of water the town is named after is actually a tidal inlet from the Barnegat Bay.

History[edit]
The first settlers of the area included many that were exiled from nearby colonies on basis on religion. Toms River was founded in 1767, then known as Dover Township.
The involvement of Toms River in the Revolutionary War has often been overlooked. The town had America's sole garrison, making it one of the key targets for the British Loyalists, who attacked the settlement at least thrice. The first attempt was unsuccessful, but the second and especially the third attacks breached the town's defenses. Captain Joshua Huddy, one of the defenders, was captured by a group of Loyalists while defending the Toms River Blockhouse and hanged without trial. The town was subsequently razed by arson, with the exception of two houses.
Despite this, the founders sought to rise back up from the rubble. New industries, such as the iron and then the charcoal industries, had come and gone. The first Mormon Branch in the state was established here in 1838. The 1850s saw an abrupt rise of cranberry farming in the vicinity. It was also when Dover Township, encompassing much more that it occupies today, became the county seat of the newly formed Ocean County. A new railroad through Toms River fueled further growth, although the population didn't rise above 10,000 for the first half of the 20th century.
The completion of the Garden State Parkway, which passes directly through the town, caused Toms River to sprawl beyond the downtown core, with droves of new residents raising the population to over 50,000 before 1980. In 1998, the Toms River Little League team was declared the victor of the World Series, which was celebrated by a parade on Route 37, now named to honor the victory.
The name of Dover Township was changed to Toms River Township in 2006 following a referendum.
In 2021, it was home to 97,000 people. Toms River's notoriety has grown among Orthodox Jews in the United States because of its growing religious population, spilling over from nearby Lakewood.
This article also covers Beachwood, Island Heights, Ocean Gate, Pine Beach and South Toms River, but not the portion of Toms River Township on Pelican Island or the Barnegat Peninsula.
