Great Barrington is a pleasant town in the Berkshire region of Massachusetts.


Understand[edit]
Great Barrington was home to 7,200 people in 2020, and it does not feel like a tiny town at all, as it has a row of buildings around a half a mile long on Main St. (US Highway 7) and a few side streets, including a couple of nice churches. Great Barrington also has a claim to fame as the childhood home of the famous civil rights leader, W.E.B. Du Bois.

Get in[edit]
Railroad St. in downtown Great Barrington
By car[edit]
From points south and north, take US Route 7 North and South, respectively. For points east and west, take I-90 (the Massachusetts Turnpike), which is a few miles north of town, and Exit 2 (from the east) or B3 (from the west).

By bus[edit]
Regular service on the routes up and down Route 7 from New York City to Vermont.

By train[edit]
There was once a passenger train to Great Barrington, as witness the name "Railroad St." However, it has been a long time since it was operational. The closest passenger train stops, nowadays, are in New York State and not worth going to for access to Great Barrington.

By plane[edit]
Albany International Airport is a 60-minute drive away. Hartford-Springfield Bradley International Airport is an 80-minute drive away.

Get around[edit]
You can get around the downtown area fairly easily on foot. To go further than that, you will need a car or at least a bicycle.
