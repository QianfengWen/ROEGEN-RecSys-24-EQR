Olympia is in the South Sound region of Washington.

The State Capitol Building rises over Capitol Lake Park
Olympia is the capital of Washington State, and the Thurston County seat.  The city reflects a diverse economic base and culture. Olympia's art and music scene is unusually large and active for a town of its size, and its identity as a city remains distinct despite strong influences from Seattle, Tacoma and Everett to the north and from Portland/Vancouver to the south. Olympia is somewhat of a breeding ground for Pacific Northwest alternative culture having spawned or influenced many of the region's better-known personalities.
The city's downtown core has been designated as a National Historic District.
The natural beauty of  Olympia is of particular note. From downtown, one can see the Olympic Mountains to the northwest set behind Puget Sound's Budd Bay - and towering Mt. Rainier to the southeast set next to the state capitol building and Capitol Lake.


Understand[edit]
It has a population of almost 56,000 (2020) and is also home to the Evergreen State College, one of six public four-year schools in Washington.
