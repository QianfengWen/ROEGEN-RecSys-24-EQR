Laitila (Swedish: Letala) is a small town in Finland Proper.


Understand[edit]
Keskuskatu, Laitila centre
Laitila, with some 8,500 inhabitants, has been regarded a town since 1986. It is surrounded by fields and known for production of egg and early vegetables (75% of Finnish early carrots), nowadays also for the brewery and soft drink factory (Laitilan Wirvoitusjuomatehdas). Indeed, a significant part of its industry is about food processing. Laitila belongs to a common commuting area with Uusikaupunki and Rauma, still with more people commuting to the town than away from it.
The area is rich in finds from the Iron Age, the most notable being the Vainionmäki grave field. The oldest glass item found in Finland, from Roman times, was found here. Among built environments of national interest are the villages of Untamala and Suontaka and the farm yard of Kauppila.

Hill forts[edit]
There are several ancient hill forts in Laitila: Kirkkelinna, Hautvuori, Seppälän linnavuoret and the ones of Vaimaro's Matinmaa. These were used as refuges when enemies or pirates were coming, steep outcrop hills, where walls were built at less steep sections. In addition to their value as historical sights, a visit usually entails a nice walk through the forest and fine views, and the hills offer adventures for children by their rugged milieu. The sites are protected, so don't move rocks or otherwise change the environment.
