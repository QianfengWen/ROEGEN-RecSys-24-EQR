Eat[edit]
Old Street Mall
Batu Pahat is fabulous for its food. Look for these Malay specialities:

Pisang goreng - only the original fried banana in batter along Jalan Omar (Warung Tandan Emas). Its unique taste comes from being mixed with their delicious blend of kicap pedas (spicy soy sauce).
Nasi bariani - seen all around Malaysia, the nasi bariani Batu Pahat originates from here. There are plentiful shops around Batu Pahat selling them but the best allegedly is located across the Batu Pahat Bridge opposite Putra Hospital. Alas, commercialisation has caused its quality to deteriorate.
There are a few coffee shops selling delicious teatime cakes, toasts, half-boiled eggs and desserts.
