According to Nihon Shoki (日本書紀), Isotakeru (五十猛) planted a tree in Japan. Ooyatsuhime (大屋都比賣神) and Tsumatsuhime (都麻都比賣命) planted a tree in Japan too. They are brother and sisters. They came back Ki no kuni. They dedicated Itakiso Jinja Shrine (伊太祁曽神社).
According to Kojiki (古事記), Isotakeru help Ōkuninushi that is targeted his life. Ōkuninushi dedicated Izumo Grand Shrine in Shimane Prefecture. Ōkuninushi and Sukunabikona (少彦名命) cooperated. But Sukunabikona go to Tokoyono kuni (常世の国). Sukunabikona dedicated Awashima-jinja Shrine (淡嶋神社) in Kada.
According to Nihon Shoki (日本書紀) and Kojiki (古事記), Emperor Jimmu and Hikoitsusenomikoto come to Wakayama. Hikoitsusenomikoto is Emperor Jimmu's older brother. He was wounded. He died in Onominato Wakayama, and buried in Kamayama. He dedicated Kamayama Jinja Shrine (竈山神社). Emperor Jimmu present Higata no Kagami and Hiboko no Kagami to Takeshi-uchi no Sukune that is Ki clan in Wakayama.

Kataonami (潟を無み) was named the beach. Subsequently, Kataonami (潟を無み) changed Kataonami (片男波). Emperor Shōmu was established Tamatsushima jinja Shrine (玉津島神社). Heian period, Many visitor to Kumano Hongū Taisha dropped in Wakanoura (若の浦) and wrote many Waka.Many waka use Tamatsushima for Utamakura (歌枕). Tamatsushima became famous. Tamatsushima jinja Shrine became shrine of Waka. Then Wakanoura (若の浦) changed Wakanoura (和歌浦).

Japanese old martial arts (Kobudō)[edit]
34.243101135.1507913 Sekiguchi Shin Shin-ryū (関口新心流), 1-20 Shimabashihigashinocho, ☏ +81-73-455-7021, sho19taro75@outlook.jp. The Sekiguchi Shinshin-ryu is a comprehensive martial art that was developed by Sekiguchi Juushin, a member of the Imagawa family of Suruga, at the beginning of the Edo period. After traveling around the country for martial arts training, he founded Sekiguchi Shinshin-ryu, which is based on the three arts of Jujutsu, Kenjutsu, and Iaido. The principle of "using soft power" is at the core of this style, which systematizes techniques based on "Ju" (softness or flexibility), emphasizing a mindset and physicality that does not resist external forces.Subsequently, it was patronized by Tokugawa Yorinobu, the founder of the Kishu Tokugawa family, and has been passed down as the official style of the Kishu domain for over 400 years. During the Edo period, the style gained nationwide recognition and became known as one of the three major schools of the era. The techniques of Sekiguchi Shinshin-ryu have influenced various other schools, and styles that have been influenced by it, such as the Higo Sekiguchi-ryu Iaido (sword-drawing techniques), continue to exist in various regions to this day.It is also the first school to use the terms "Ju" and "Jujutsu," and for this reason, Sekiguchi Juushin is often referred to as the founder of Jujutsu. Additionally, the school is known for creating the concept of "Ukemi," the art of falling safely, which is not only used in traditional martial arts but also in modern Judo. (updated Mar 2017)
 Iwakura-ryū eihou (岩倉流泳法), 778 Yoshida, ☏ +81-73-423-5543, info@iwakuraryu.jp. Old swimming style in Wakayama. The Japan Swimming Federation recognizes 12 schools of traditional Japanese swimming, one of which is the Iwakura-ryu. This school originated when Tokugawa Yoshimune, the fifth lord of the Kishu domain, appointed his retainer Iwakura Gousuke Shigemasa (with a stipend of 1,200 koku) in 1710 to oversee and instruct the domain's warriors in swimming techniques.When Yoshimune became the eighth Shogun, Shigemasa's disciples, Yoshida Tanyo and Tahara Nanuiseven, taught swimming to various warriors at the Fukagawa Etchu Island training ground in Edo. Later, due to old age, Shigemasa passed on the role of instructor to his high disciple Kawakami Dennyojo Naonobu in 1771.The tradition was passed down through Kawakami Katsujirō Naonobu, Kawakami Denuemon, and Kawakami Shinjuro Naoyuki, reaching the Meiji Restoration. Around 1873-1874, following the abolition of the feudal domains, a swimming dojo was opened on the Kii River.Dennyojo's son joined the Wakanoura branch of the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai in 1906 as the head of the swimming division, bringing along about 500 staff and trainees. At this time, it was sometimes referred to as the Kawakami-ryu.In 1949, Dennyojo and his eldest son Hiroshi issued a certificate of lineage to their high disciple Yukawa Kimi. After Kimi's death in 1957, his son Yukawa Setsuo inherited the swimming techniques. Setsuo opened the Iwakura-ryu Wakanoura Swimming School and worked on its popularization. Due to his old age, he passed on the lineage to his high disciple Nasu Kenji in 2002.This swimming technique has been designated as a cultural asset of Wakayama Prefecture since April 14, 1965. The techniques include various styles such as flat swimming, vertical swimming, and diving, as well as specialized techniques like leaping and one-handed leaping.There are also group swimming methods, where a person wearing armor leads the way, followed by others carrying swords, bows, spears, and guns, signaled by a large flag. This is known as the "Kii no Hana" or flower umbrella procession.The Iwakura-ryu Swimming Preservation Society and the Iwakura-ryu Wakanoura Swimming School continue to pass down the tradition. They also participate annually in the Japan Swimming Federation's certified Japanese Swimming Championship as one of the 12 recognized schools.

Sleep[edit]
There are a few small hotels in Wakayama, none of which are really used to dealing with tourists. The most easy to spot is the monstrous Daiwa Roynet, which towers above the city near Wakayama Castle. Nearby, in Burakuricho, there is a new business hotel, and there is the Granvia hotel, a rather exclusive and expensive hotel near JR station.

Perhaps one of the best features of Wakayama is that it is well connected, and provides good access to Osaka, Kyoto, Nara and so on without being on top of them. Wakayama is a smaller city which seemingly makes little effort to embrace tourism, so is a good example of a "normal" Japanese place untouched by the demons of tourism.
