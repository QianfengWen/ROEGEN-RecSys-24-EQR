Understand[edit]
Godbout bay and the quay on the sea
Godbout is an old coastal village on the Côte-Nord in Quebec in the regional county municipality of Manicouagan. The ferry linking the village to Matane on the south shore of the St. Lawrence is the village's main employer. Moreover, this has created an offer of accommodation and catering in the village. In the village of Godbout, sea or river fishing, especially salmon, is the major economic activity. Nestled between the mountains and at the bottom of a deep bay, the village benefits from protection against the heavy seas of the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

History[edit]
In the 17th century, a first fur trading post was opened at the bottom of Godbout Bay; it remained in operation there for nearly two centuries. The toponymic designation "Godbout" appears in the Relations of the Jesuits of 1670. This locality turns out to be the parish of birth of Mgr Napoléon Alexandre Labrie, bishop of the diocese of the North Shore; he was a great visionary, having contributed to promoting education and developing the socio-political context of the region. A second legendary character and resident of Godbout, Napoléon Alexandre Comeau, had many talents: trapper, geologist, naturalist, doctor and an adventurer who loved exploits.
The village of Godbout includes an Innu minority.
