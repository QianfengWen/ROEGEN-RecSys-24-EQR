Los Cristianos beach
Los Cristianos is one of the most popular tourist centres in the south of Tenerife, and has become known for its sandy beaches. It is a town of about 21,000 permanent residents (2015) that is 2 km southeast of Playa de las Américas and 5 km southeast of Costa Adeje, but it is the most authentic of these three, where locals mix with tourists.


Understand[edit]
Los Cristianos offers a full holiday experience, with two sandy beaches, a multitude of bars and restaurants, and its year-round sunny climate. There is accommodation for different budgets, including hotels, self-catering apartments and timeshare resorts. There is also a wealth of excursions focused around the town's busy port including dolphin and whale watching as well as game fishing trips and party cruises.
The town has attracted British expatriates who emigrated either permanently or semi-permanently to escape the cold British winters. English is as widely spoken as Spanish, and there are British-owned bars, restaurants, shops and services aimed predominantly at the tourist sector.
