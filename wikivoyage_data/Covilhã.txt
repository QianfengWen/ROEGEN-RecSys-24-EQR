Covilhã is a city in Portugal's Beira Baixa region.


Understand[edit]
Praça do Município.

Covilhã (koo-vee-LYUHN, /ku.vi.ˈʎɐ̃/) serves as a gateway to Serra da Estrela, the centre of Portugal's winter sports. The city proper has 35,000 residents, and the municipality is home to 52,000 people.

Climate[edit]
Covilhã enjoys a mild Mediterranean climate, but is one of the few areas of Portugal to experience regular snowfall. Higher locations in the municipality, such as Penhas da Saúde, can experience blizzards, while the city centre gets no more than a dusting that doesn't accumulate.
