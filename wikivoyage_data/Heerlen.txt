Heerlen is a city in South Limburg in the southeast of the Netherlands. In Roman times, it was a settlement named Coriovallum, which hosted a bathhouse, now the Thermenmuseum. Heerlen has become a part of a new larger project city, called Parkstad Limburg, composed of Brunssum, Kerkrade, Landgraaf, Onderbanken, Nuth, Simpelveld en Voerendaal.


Understand[edit]
Heerlen is uncommonly hilly compared to the rest of the country. It is in the southern part of the Netherlands, between Maastricht and Liège to the west, and Aachen to the east. It's also very close to nature reserve Brunssummerheide. Most travelers will mainly go here to visit the beautiful and plentiful limburgish landscapes, either by bike or on foot. However, the city has also plenty of worthwhile attractions to visit.
The city has been building on becoming a more green urban park city, from the old industrial city it was before. The old paved streets have been turned into lush green borders with trees, and the smaller suburbs have also gotten this overhaul, with smaller parks all around to discover between the houses. The city park Aambos houses a small free zoo with deer, goats and other animals. The Aambos is also next to Huize De Berg, an old cloister from 1897 with beautiful architecture, now a nursing home.

History[edit]
Even though there have been traces of earlier civilization, the real history of this town starts in the Roman era. The Roman military settlement, known as Coriovallum, sat at the crossroads of the Boulogne-Cologne and Xanten-Aachen-Trier routes.
In the late 19th century, the town's importance for the coal mining industry grew. A railway was built in 1896 and strongly improved the accessibility of the town, which was then only a village. The first major mine, the Oranje-Nassau mine, was opened in 1899, and three more mines followed by 1927. The town rapidly grew in size, changing it into one of the largest in the area.
In 1965, the decision to close all Dutch coal mines left many workers without jobs. In an attempt to create jobs, the Dutch government moved the Dutch Bureau for Statistics and the ABP, the pension fund for government and education employees in the Netherlands to Heerlen.

Tourist information[edit]
There is a tourist information office in Heerlen Centrum at Bongerd|d 6411 where they can provide maps for different types of interest related paths such as a path to follow to see the murals throughout the city. Many murals are a reflection of the mining history of the city. One mural is of a gas mask with the filter being a bird as the miners would know to leave the cave if the bird died while underground.
They can assist with maps, region guides, travel information, regional products, theater and concert information.

On foot[edit]
Heerlen is a great city to explore on foot. This is mainly due to the city center being car free. Walking to most things can be done within an hour. The train station is situated in the city center and it's only a short walk to the bongerd. While most streets are free of cars there are a number of streets where cyclists are allowed, therefore be careful when straying off the main streets as it can be busy with cyclists.

By bike[edit]
This is a great method of exploring the surrounding areas, but Heerlen is in the southern part of the Netherlands, so it is not flat. Stray even a small distance out of the city center and it will be obvious that there are hills. This becomes even more apparent if you bike to other towns or areas.

By car[edit]
Navigating Heerlen by car can be tricky as a lot of the street are one way and some are totally closed of for traffic. The districts outside can even be more of a nightmare if you are unfamiliar with the surroundings, though most tourist should not have a reason to go there. The main road network is however exceptional and getting to other towns is very easy and convienent. Exploring South Limburg is very well doable with Heerlen as the starting base and/or ending point.
