Klerksdorp is a mining and agricultural city of 186,000 people (2011) in North West Province. Together with Rustenburg, Klerksdorp forms the economic heart of North West Province. It is one of the hubs of the South African gold mining industry, although its importance has declined. It is expected to be a large uranium producer in the future.

Klerksdorp dates back to 1837 when the Voortrekkers settled along the Schoonspruit, and is the oldest European settlement north of the Vaal River in South Africa. Like other localities in the former Transvaal, it had its share of engagements between the Brits and the Boers, particularly during the Second Boer War, where the latter struck a decisive victory at Ysterspruit (Iron Stream), but still lost the war. It was the site of concentration camps too. 
In 1995, a tragic accident in nearby Vaal Reefs where an elevator plunged down a mine shaft taking 104 lives became the worst elevator accident in history. 
Apart from mining, Klerksdorp is positioned as a notable medical, retail and educational centre for North West Province and Northern Free State.
The Klerksdorp district is a major contributor to South African agriculture; maize, sorghum, groundnuts and sunflower are important crops farmed in the district. Klerksdorp has the largest agricultural co-op in the southern hemisphere, named 'Senwes'.
The farming district is also known for its Sussex cattle herds. The city is the headquarters of the South African Sussex Cattle Breeders Association.
