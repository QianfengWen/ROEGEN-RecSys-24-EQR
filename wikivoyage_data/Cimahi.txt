Cimahi is a city in the Parahyangan region of Western Java, Indonesia. The city is a suburb on the western side of the provincial capital Bandung.


Understand[edit]
Cimahi has a population of almost 600,000. Starting in 1886, the Dutch colonial government built many military institutions in the city, and nowadays still many branches of the Indonesian military are in the city, which is therefore nicknamed Kota Tentara (Army City or City of Soldiers).

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Cimahi is along the Purbaleunyi toll road that connects the city to Purwakarta (and further to Jakarta) and Bandung. The original trunk road between Cimahi and Bandung (part of the Great Post Road) is also still an important road between the two cities. In addition, there is a major trunk road from Cimahi to the west, to Cianjur and the Puncak pass. A smaller road connects Cimahi to Lembang in the mountains in the northwest.

By train[edit]
Cimahi is on the railway between Cikampek and Bandung. -6.88579107.536111 Cimahi railway station serves 7 executive class trains per day to Bandung's central station as well as 7 trains per day in the other direction to Gambir station in Central Jakarta. In addition, there are two daily executive trains to Cirebon, and one long-distance combined executive/business/economy class train per day to Surabaya via Cirebon and Semarang. There are two daily economy class trains to Pasar Senen station in Jakarta, one daily to Purwakarta, one to Cibatu near Garut, and two to Purwokerto via Tasikmalaya.

By bus[edit]
Frequent intercity buses are available at the two major bus terminals in Bandung: Cicaheum terminal in East Bandung for destinations in the east (such as Central and East Java) and Leuwi Panjang terminal in South Bandung for destinations in the west (such as Jakarta and the port of Merak). There are frequent green-coloured angkot (public minivans) from Leuwi Panjang terminal to Cimahi. To get from Cicaheum terminal to Cimahi, you will need to take two different angkot routes (for example with a change at Bandung's railway station).
Some bus companies offer intercity bus routes from Cimahi. For example, bus company Budiman has several routes from the -6.87925107.539412 Cimahi Mall bus stop, with frequent buses to Tasikmalaya and daily buses to various cities in Central Java, including Magelang, Solo, Yogyakarta, Cilacap, and Wonosobo.
