Sackets Harbor is a village of 1450 people on Lake Ontario in Northern New York. It was a naval base which withstood two Canadian attacks in battles during the War of 1812; its arch-nemesis was the British fortification at Kingston in Upper Canada.


Get in[edit]
By car, take NY 3 (Arsenal Street) west from Watertown (New York) to Adams Road or East Main Street. Sackets Harbor is about 8 mi (13 km) southwest of Watertown's airport (ART IATA) in Dexter, NY.
By boat, Sackets Harbor should be a clear shot across Lake Ontario from Kingston.

Get around[edit]
As this is a small village, less than a mile from the core to the edge of town, it is possible to tour on foot or bicycle.
