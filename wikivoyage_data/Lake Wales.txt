Lake Wales is a small city in eastern Polk County, Florida. The city is in the middle of a long, narrow region known as the Lake Wales Ridge. The Lake Wales Ridge was the first part of the Florida Peninsula to rise above sea level, beginning as a series of small sandy islands not unlike the Florida Keys today. It is a unique environment from its surrounding and home to several endemic species, such as the gopher tortoise and scrub jay. The city of Lake Wales lies at the southern foot of Iron Mountain—the second-highest  point on the Florida Peninsula at 295 ft (90 m)—and is home to famous Bok Tower Gardens and its Singing Tower. Near the center of town lies Lake Wailes. The city is small, but much of the rural area extending east and southeast of town is considered as part of Lake Wales and included in this guide.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
The city was first surveyed in 1879 by Sidney Irving Wailes, who changed the name of a lake—then known as Watts Lake—to Lake Wailes. The city was incorporated in 1911 as Lake Wales (the lake remains known as Lakes Wailes). In the 1920s, the town became a popular winter home for affluent residents from northern states. This resulted in the construction of many historical buildings which remain today in downtown and also in the construction of Bok Tower Gardens.

Climate[edit]








Check the weather forecast for Lake Wales at NOAA.



Lake Wales' climate is much the same as the rest of Central Florida (except coasts). Summers are hot and humid, with highs around 90-95°F (33-35°C) and lows around 74-78°F (23-26°C). During the summer, onshore winds from both coasts travel inland, heat up, rise and build into thunderstorms, usually along a rough line. Lying in the center of the state, the lines of storms (each called a "seabreeze") sometimes collide, resulting in strong thunderstorms with frequent lightning and tornadoes (small EF0-1s, not like the powerful tornadoes in the Plains states), over 50 mph winds, and hail possible. Strong storms are usually preceded by cooler winds caused by the rain-cooled air (cold air sinks) rapidly flowing away from the storm. The temperature after a strong thunderstorm passes can drop from 95°F (35°C) to 75°F (24°C) and since the storms can be fairly small, you can drive 5 miles and the temperature will drop/rise 20°F (10°C) between rain-cooled and surrounding areas.
Winters are mild, with highs in the 70s (°F; 21-27°C) and lows in the 50s (°F; 10-15°C). Lows in the 30s (°F; 0-5°C) are common after cold fronts and there are usually a handful of lows below freezing each winter, although that requires clear skies, so it usually warms very rapidly after sunrise (30°F/−1°C at 6AM, 55°F/13°C by noon is typical). Cold fronts occasionally pass by as squall lines, so tornadoes in December or January are not unusual. Snow is extremely rare; the last measurable snowfall was in 1977, although sleet/wintry mix fell in an unusually cold January 2010.
Spring and fall are transition periods, with spring tending to be the driest months of the year.
In 2004, Lake Wales was hit by three hurricanes: Charley, Frances, & Jeanne. It was the first time in recorded U.S. history that 3 hurricanes passed through the same county (Polk County) in the same year, with Lake Wales and other southern Polk County towns lying closest to the path of these hurricanes' eyes.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Lake Wales is located at the crossroads of U.S. 27 and State Road 60. U.S. 27 is a heavily-traveled 4-to-6-lane divided highway running north/south through the center of the peninsula, heading south to Sebring & Miami and running north to Clermont, Ocala, & Gainesville. State Road 60 runs east-west across the center of the state from Clearwater, Tampa and Brandon in the west to Vero Beach in the east.

From Orlando[edit]
Lake Wales is easily reached from the Orlando/Kissimmee area by taking Interstate 4 west to U.S. 27 (exit 55) and heading south about 25 mi.

From the Tampa Bay area[edit]
Take Interstate 4 east and exit on the Polk Parkway east (exit 27). Follow the parkway for 10 mi (toll: $1.25/car cash or $1/car with Sunpass) before exiting onto U.S. 98 (exit 10). Head south to Bartow, follow U.S. 98 left at the traffic light as it joins S.R. 60 east (Van Fleet Drive), stay right after turning and at the second traffic light, follow the signs to remain on S.R. 60 east to Lake Wales (U.S. 98 goes straight at light and continues a couple hundred feet to an intersection with U.S. 17).

From South Florida[edit]
Take either U.S. 27 north or take Florida's Turnpike north to SR 60 and head west.

By bus[edit]
Winter Haven Area Transit (WHAT, ☏ +1 863 534-5500) provides public bus service in eastern Polk County. Route 30 connects the Eagle Ridge Mall to southeast Winter Haven (including Legoland) and downtown Winter Haven. From the Eagle Ridge Mall, Route 35 runs south through Lake Wales, continuing on to Babson Park and Frostproof. Route 25 runs from Lake Wales Plaza to Bartow. Adult/youth fare is $1.50/ride with no free transfers. Seniors (65+) and the disabled ride for $0.75, with proper ID and no free transfers. Children under 7 ride free with an adult. A day pass for adults costs $3 (or $27 for a 10 pack) and is good for 24 hours from activation on bus. Senior/disabled day pass costs $1.50 (or $15 for a 10 pack). Weekly ($12) & 31-day passes ($47) are also available. A bike rack located on the front is available to put your bike at no additional charge. All regular buses are equipped with a wheel chair lift.

By train[edit]
Lake Wales lies close to the Amtrak Silver Star & Silver Meteor routes, but does not have a station. Winter Haven (Code: WTH; 1800 7th Street SW) is the nearest station along the daily Amtrak Silver Star and Silver Meteor routes. If you plan to arrive by train, you should have friends/family at the station to pick you up or have the phone number for a taxi to call when you arrive. The station is a poorly-maintained covered platform with a small office and is in a fairly unpleasant area beside a warehouse. Fortunately the trains arrive during daylight, but it's not a very great place to wait for hours. To reach Lake Wales by public transportation (WHAT, see "By bus" above), you can take Route 22XW south to Bartow, then switch to Route 25 to head east to Lake Wales. You could also take Route 22XW north to the downtown terminal, then Route 30 to the Eagle Ridge Mall, and Route 35 to Lake Wales.
The Amtrak station in Sebring (Code: SBG; 601 E Center Ave) is also reasonably convenient to the Lake Wales area. The Sebring station is served by both the Amtrak Silver Star and Silver Meteor routes. No public transportation connects Lake Wales and Sebring.

By air[edit]
The nearest commercial airport is Orlando International Airport (MCO IATA) in Orlando, located about an hour away. Tampa International Airport (TPA IATA) in Tampa is about an hour and a half away. Lakeland Linder Regional Airport (LAL IATA) in Lakeland does not have any regularly scheduled commercial flights as of Apr 2019.
Lake Wales Airport (FAA LID: X07) is 2 mi west of downtown. There are no scheduled air carrier, commuter, or air taxi services. The airport is used for skydiving flights—Lake Wales being the skydiving capital of Florida.

Do[edit]
Lake Wales lies on the edge of an outdoor enthusiast's paradise. All these parks lie several miles to the east of town, off S.R. 60. Lake Kissimmee State Park is the most popular park and offers many miles of trails for hiking, mountain biking, or horseback riding. The area is home to dozens of species of birds for birding enthusiasts to check out. The lakes and swamps are home to thousands of alligators. Alligators are largely nocturnal and are usually hard to spot during the day as most lay hidden in vegetation or submerged in lakes, but they can sometimes be seen sunning themselves on shore or—with a careful eye—submerged and barely sticking the top of their head out of the water. Airboat rides are a great way to view the animals of the marshes and swamps and are probably the best bet for spotting alligators, which may be hard to find from shore (be careful of how close you get!). KICCO Wildlife Management Area, stretching south from Lake Kissimmee along the Kissimmee River, is a great destination for hunting, be it deer, feral hogs, wild turkeys, ducks, or small game and has camping sites as well as trails/roads suitable for hiking and mountain biking. KICCO also contains 13 mi (21 km) of the Florida Trail, a 1400 mi (2100 km) wilderness backpacking trail across Florida, from the Everglades to Pensacola. Lake Rosalie Park, North Walk-in-Water Creek, & SUMICA are county-operated parks on environmentally sensitive land tracts which the state has purchased to save from development (under the Florida Forever program). These parks are large, but don't yet offer a lot of amenities beyond a parking lot, short trails, and primitive camping sites.
Lake Wales shares its name with the Lake Wales Ridge—a sandy, scrub environment home to several endemic species, such as the gopher tortoise and scrub jay (a bird). The Lake Wales Ridge is a long, narrow tract of land running mainly through Highlands and Polk Counties (but sections can be found further north in Osceola, Orange, and Lake Counties) on lands that were once islands and the first lands of the present Florida Peninsula to rise from the ocean. Despite their names, the Lake Wales State Forest is located in nearby Frostproof and the Lake Wales Ridge National Wildlife Refuge[dead link] consists of four small tracts of land—two in Highlands County, one near Winter Haven, and one near Poinciana/Haines City, none of which are open for public use.

27.943867-81.3542677 Lake Kissimmee State Park, 14248 Camp Mack Rd (Take S.R. 60 East of town about 8 mi (13 km). Turn left on Boy Scout Rd. Turn right on Camp Mack Rd. Entrance is about 5 mi (8 km), on right.), ☏ +1 863 696-1112. 7AM-Sunset, 365 days/yr. A nearly 6000 acre park located on the banks of the third largest lake in Florida. Offers 13 mi (21 km) of nature trails (walk, horse, mountain bike), picnic facilities, & camping pads. Fishing in Lake Kissimmee is excellent, especially on boat (although canal-side fishing opportunities exist). Cow Camp is a living-history demonstration of life in frontier Florida. Airboat tours of Lake Kissimmee (including some sections of the park) are also popular, but must be booked through an outside operator (see "On the water" section below), not through the park office or from within the park. Airboats are prohibited from being launched at the park's boat ramp or operate near the park's boat ramp/marina area. Airboat tours launch from nearby boat ramps and pass through limited sections of the park (mainly Lake Kissimmee, but not creeks/marshes leading away from the lake). $5 per vehicle (2-8 persons); $4 Single occupant vehicle; and $2 pedestrians/cyclists/extra passengers. 
A popular attraction at the park is Cow Camp, a living history demonstration taking you back to 1876 to discover the life of the Florida "cracker"—the early ranchers so named for the crack of their whips. At the end of the trail, you will meet with a Florida Cow Hunter resting in a frontier camp along the route of a cattle drive. He will be glad to tell you stories of life on the frontier, if not busy cooking or tending to the cattle. Cow Camp is open weekends Oct-Apr and all major holidays year round 9:30AM-4:30PM or upon request year-round for groups of 15 or more. There is no separate charge after entry into park.
Four categories of camping sites are available in the park: Full facility, primitive, equestrian, & youth. Sixty campsites with electric & water hookups are available with nearby dump station, boat ramp, marina, playground, & observation tower. The full facility sites are shaded in an oak hammock and can be booked up to 11 months in advance either online or by calling +1-800-326-3521 (8AM-8PM). Full facility sites are $20/night for tents or RVs (up to 20 ft). Two primitive campsites ($5 per person, per night) are available off trails in the park for up to 12 campers per site. Each site has two picnic tables & two grills, but everything else (including water) must be provided by the campers, who should follow leave-no-trace camping practices. Primitive equestrian campsites are also available. Youth camping sites ($1 per youth, per night; $5 per adult/chaperone, per night) are secluded just off the beaten path (under 200 ft/60 m from parking) and offer restrooms, cold showers, picnic tables, benches, & a fire pit. A minimum of 12 campers (and maximum of 25) are required to book a youth campsite. A guided overnight backpacking trip is also available between Nov-Mar upon request (minimum 4 backpackers). A Park Ranger accompanies the group on a guided 3.5 mi (5.6 km) hike to a primitive campsite Saturday afternoon, where participants camp overnight, finishing with a guided 3.5 mi (5.6 km) hike on Sunday morning.

Other activities[edit]
Spook Hill
Spook Hill (From S.R. 17, turn right onto J.A. Wiltshire) Put your car in neutral and watch as your car appears to defy gravity and roll uphill. Legend has it that ages ago, an Indian village on the banks of this swamp was plagued by raids from a huge alligator living in it. The village's great warrior chief and the gator were killed in battle, with the chief buried on the north side. When pioneers later traveled through here, they found their horses labored going "downhill" and called it "Spook Hill". Is it the gator seeking revenge or the chief protecting his land? Officially, this is a gravity hill—where the visual horizon is such that you appear to be going uphill, when in fact you are moving down a slight incline.
A good ol' American rodeo is held every Saturday night at Westgate River Ranch Resort (Off S.R. 60 about 25 mi (40 km) east of Lake Wales, near Kissimmee River.; Adults $15.50, children $8). Shows begin at 7:30PM and feature trick riding, calf roping, barrel racing, bull riding, and rodeo clowns.

Downtown Lake Wales lies just 15 min from Legoland Florida in southeast Winter Haven. For nature lovers, the Lake Wales Ridge continues south into Frostproof and there are thousands of acres of scrub and forests east of Frostproof for hunting, driving off-road vehicles, and fishing (such as Crooked Lake and Lake Arbuckle). For history buffs or just lovers of quaint little towns, head west to Bartow or Fort Meade.
