Jalandhar is a city in Punjab, India.  Jalandhar is now industrial center with leather goods and sport equipments being the big earners. This is a good place to share Punjabi people passion for foods.


Understand[edit]
Punjab's third largest city with a population of nearly one million has huge historic significance. Nearby flows the Beas River that marks the eastern-most border of Alexander the Great's conquests in 326 BCE. According to Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang or (Hsuan-tsang) who traveled to India between 627-643 CE, Adinapur (the current Jalalabad) was an important Buddhist center with lot of vihara (monasteries). At that time Adinapur was the capital of a powerful kingdom that encompassed a good part of southern Himachal Pardesh. But the city retains almost nothing of its past. Few archaeological relics are to the south, around Nakodar town.

Jalandhar is well connected to all the major cities in Punjab by Public and Private buses. There are private buses connecting Jalandhar to the towns in other states but generally they don't have the legal permits and took much time as compared to state owned buses. However, these can be comfortable as compared to state buses depending upon the bus operator. There are air conditioned buses also which generally have valid permits.
There is no airport in Jalandhar but the nearest airport is in Amritsar at a distance of 100 km (90 min). There are many airlines operating from Amritsar Airport connecting it to Europe, North America and the Middle East. However the transport system connecting the airport to Jalandhar is poor, so it is advisable to book a taxi before you arrive.
