Noordwijk is a town of 44,000 people (2021) in South Holland. Noordwijk is divided into two parts: Noordwijk aan Zee (the old fishing settlement, and now more touristy and with good shopping) on the dunes, and Noordwijk Binnen (the older, historic village) slightly further in land.


Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Coming from Amsterdam or Schiphol, take the A4 heading for Leiden, but turn onto the A44 after exit 4 (Nieuw-Vennep). Stay on the A44 for a while and then use exit 3 (Noordwijkerhout) to leave the A44 and join the N208. You will find yourself next to Sassenheim at this point. Keep going straight on the two roundabouts that you will come across. Confusingly, by going straight on the last one, you join the N443 instead of staying on the N208. Following the N443 brings you to Noordwijkerhout. For Noordwijk, turn onto the N206 going southwest, and leave the same road at the next exit, turning right will then bring you into Noordwijk.

By public transit[edit]
Noordwijk itself does not have a train station. The station is 52.22544.4841 Voorhout railway station  SPR . From here, bus 385 (which originates at 52.080714.324822 Den Haag Centraal Station  SPR  IC ) runs to Noordwijk. Alternatively, you could go to 52.16634.48233 Leiden railway station  SPR  IC  instead and take bus 21 to Noordwijk or bus 57 to Noordwijkerhout from there. Leiden has the advantage of being better connected to other railway stations throughout the country.

Get around[edit]
As with all small towns in Holland, a bike is by far the best way to get around.

Do[edit]
Go to the beach, one of the best in this part of Holland. Make sure you take time to head into one of the beach pavilions at the end of the day and grab a drink. These pavilions are every 500m and are disassembled in the winter.
Explore the dunes by bike.
Take a boat trip to the Kaag.

Eat[edit]
Noordwijk, especially Noordwijk aan Zee is focused very much towards tourists. Along the beach, you will find a pavilion roughly every 500 metres. Most of them get dismantled for the fall and winter.

 Binnen op Zee, Parallel Boulevard 4, ☏ +31 713615620. Think twice about getting a starter dish! Big meals for a good price. 
 Vivaldi's, street by the beach. The best ice cream in town. So good that locals even come here after dinner at home. Buy an ice cream, sit on one of the benches outside and watch the good and great come past. Had a very large selection of flavours. €2-3 for an ice cream. 
Drink[edit]
 Het Koffiehuis, De Grent 32. Nice small bar with lot's of different locals around! Be sure to try the Korenwolf draught beer.
