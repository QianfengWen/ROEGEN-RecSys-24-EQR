Not to be confused with Gwangju (Gyeonggi).

Gwangju (광주, 光州) (means city of light), (formerly Romanized as Kwangju)  is a metropolitan city in the center of South Jeolla province, South Korea. Gwangju has a thriving youth and arts culture and even a glance down the streets of 'Geumnam-ro' will note a generally more fashion-conscious populace. Further to this, the city has numerous art galleries and hosts a biennial Bienalle.
It is the only city in the world with a mountain more than 1,000 m difference from the average altitude of the city in the administrative district of the city where more than 1 million people live. It is common for a city to be located in a km-class highland, such as Tehran, Iran, and Mexico City, but Gwangju Metropolitan City is the only city with such a large altitude difference within the city's administrative district. Geographically, the fact that there is a 1,000-m mountain in the city is an absolute disadvantage for the city itself to grow and does not exist elsewhere. However, Gwangju Metropolitan City is in the volcanic basin plain, which is possible because the topography of this plain is vast.

The city has an interesting claim to fame as having the largest and most modern bus terminal (called U-Square) and possibly the largest single pedestrian drinking, dining and clubbing district in the country. This is reflective of the city in general, which holds a much more modern and cleaner appearance than anywhere else in the country, save perhaps Busan.
In Korea, Gwangju is famous for its cuisine as is the province of Jeolla. The entire area had been considered the breadbasket of Korea historically. On the practical side, food is generally tastier and easier on the wallet throughout this province.



“

What? Those Gwangju citizens aren't afraid of airborne troops? They must be rioters!

”


—South Korean military dictator Chun Doo-hwan, as dramatized in 5th Republic 

Gwangju is well known in South Korea for the Gwangju Massacre (aka the Gwangju Uprising, the May 18 Democratic Uprising or the Gwangju Democratization Movement) of May 18, 1980, in which at least 207 (or far higher depending on whom you ask) demonstrators were killed by the army in the course of suppressing a pro-democracy demonstration. Gwangju was seen as the forefront of the democracy movement in South Korea. The people of the city are proud of the uprising and tend to be at the forefront of any political upheaval in the country.

Climate[edit]
Gwangju lies between a subtropical and humid continental climate zones. November to April tend to be more continental, while warmer months are more subtropical with hot, humid summers. There are monsoon conditions in June and July and an average of nonheavy snow during winter.
As of mid-November 2022, Gwangju Metropolitan City and Jeollanam-do have been confirmed to have fallen below 30% due to the worst drought since 1973, and some parts of Jeollanam-do have not been able to supply normal water for more than six months, so they are living with limited water supply or transportation. As a result, all 12 cities and counties across Gwangju and Jeollanam-do are complaining of water conservation by reaching the "warning" stage, which is the fourth of the five stages of drought for living water, and Gwangju is likely to receive limited water in 30 years around January to March 2023.[1][2]

Orientation[edit]
Gwangju sits roughly 267 km (165 miles) the south of Seoul and about 202 km (125 miles) the west of Busan.
Chungjang-ro and Geumnam-ro streets to the center are Gwangju's conventional shopping and entertainment downtown and the main office building area. U-Square (Gwangju Bus Terminal) area, Chonnam National University Back Gate Area, and Cheomdan & Suwan & Pungam Districts are transportation nodes, comparatively new shopping areas and entertainment downtowns, while Sangmu district is the new office building area.
Mudeungsan National Park lies to the east, and Daechon-dong Countryside is in the south of Gwangju. To the west is Songjeong town where the Gwangju International Airport and Gwangju Songjeong Station are.
The district of Chungjang-ro and Geumnam-ro streets, which is the old urban core, is the most accessible area for foreigners, and many of Gwangju's attractions can be found here, making it a good base to start exploring the city.

Gwangju Airport is located in the suburbs of Gwangju. But in the front of the airport, there are many mass transits to reach downtown simply, such as subway, intra-city bus, taxi, and so forth.

By train[edit]
Korail's KTX trains or SR, Inc.'s SRT run from Seoul 20~23 times a day and are the quickest option for travelers wanting to go to Gwangju from Seoul. The trip takes 1½-3 hours and the cost is ₩46,800-65,500. In the case of SRT, it takes 1½ hours, the cost is ₩40,400-58,800.

By bus[edit]
Gwangju has a highly developed bus network because of Kumho Express, which is headquartered in Gwangju. Express buses between Seoul and Gwangju depart every 5 to 15 minutes all day long.
Buses from major cities throughout the country arrive and depart from “U-Square” (Gwangju Bus Terminal), a large, fancy bus terminal near the geographic center of the city. The largest and fanciest in the country to be precise: this place looks like an airport. Every taxi driver in Gwangju knows the bus terminal as 버스 터미널, "Beosuh Teo-mee-nal", or “U-Square”. Seoul Gangnam to Gwangju prices are ₩17,600 or ₩37,200 (May 2017) for the standard bus and premium limousine buses, respectively, and the trip takes about 3 or 4 hours. Prices to other cities are comparable; late night buses tend to be a little more expensive.

 Gwangju Express Bus Terminal (U-Square), ☏ +82 62-360-8114. 
Get around[edit]
Getting around in Gwangju is really quite easy, though rush hour significantly adds to travel time. There are two basic options: buses and taxis. Taxis are generally cheap but buses are frequent and more or less comfortable. Gwangju Subway line stretches from the southeast near downtown to the west-southwest, forming an arc with the northernmost point being near the bus terminal at Nongseong Station (농성역 - Nongseong Yeok). The subway line is not spread over the city, but the trains go through some busy streets. Moreover, Gwangju subway is never overcrowded as much as Seoul.

By subway[edit]
The subway is also cheap - ₩1400 in cash and ₩1250 in transportation card to any location (March 2017). The four main stops on the subway (though there are 20 in total) are the Culture Center (Munhwajeondang, former Provincial Office), Geumnamno-4 & 5 (pedestrian downtown), and Sangmu (the unofficial commercial center and western-style downtown area). To get to the bus terminal, exit at Nongseong Station (농성역 - Nongseong Yeok) and walk straight north (10 minutes) past E-Mart and Shinsegae department store. The bus terminal is juxtaposed to those two buildings. To take a train, take the subway to Songjeong-ni station and follow the signs for the train station. The second subway line that will eventually form a circle around the city will break ground towards the end of 2025. Eventually, there will be three lines in Gwangju.

By bus[edit]
Intra-city bus fare is the same as the subway: ₩1400 in cash and ₩1250 in transportation card. Buses are arranged by colors.
Red buses are express buses, running often, making very few stops, and covering large parts of the city. Bus number 순환01 (Sunhwan01) connects Sangmu area to the train station to Chosun University. Buses 풍암06 (Pungam06), 진월07 (Jinwol07), and 첨단09 (Cheomdan09) cover the rest of the city making large squares that intersect in important locations.
좌석02 (Jwaseok02) connects Jeungsimsa Temple to Asia Culture Center to Gwangju & Jeonnam Joint Innovation City and passes through Gwangju's main commercial areas, such as Geumnamno street, Songjeong Station, and Sangmu district. 좌석02 is a little bit expensive than the other buses: ₩1800 in cash and ₩1700 in transportation card.
Yellow buses are standard buses that run every 10 – 20 minutes.
Green buses are village buses that connect smaller communities and rural areas to transfer points.
Purple buses are district circulator buses, generally going to the outskirts of the city.
Every neighborhood (동 - dong) to main locations around the city.

By taxi[edit]
Taxis are incredibly cheap (by western standards). A general and regular taxi ride will cost ₩2800 for the first two kilometers then ₩100 per 145m or 35s after that.
모범택시(Deluxe taxi, Mobeom-taeksi) ride will cost ₩3200 for the first two kilometers then ₩200 per 172 m or 41 seconds after that.
From 00:00-04:00, you will pay 20% extra as late hour premium.
On a traffic-free night, you can get across the city for around ₩10,000. Black taxis have a higher surcharge than white or silver taxis but due to the fact they charge on distances only, tend to drive more unpredictably.

By car[edit]
Driving and parking in Gwangju are easier than other big cities in Korea. The roads are wide and drivers tend to be pretty inoffensive. The parking chaos seldom emerges except for busy streets. If you are willing to pay for commercial lots in the downtown, parking problem would be no trouble at all.
The reason why Gwangju has been prospered in modern times is, the city was constructed as a central part of South Jeolla. Thereby, if you are coming to explore the area around Gwangju (such as going down to Boseong) then the flexibility of driving yourself will help you enjoy it more.

By bicycle[edit]
The topography of Gwangju is flat widely, so moving somewhere in the city by bike is quite agreeable. However, South Korean do not tend to have a bicycle culture commonly, the bikeways in the city are not well-kept except for some areas. There are two places that have fine bike lanes in the urban area; one is Gwangju stream embankment and the other one is Pu-reun-gil park.
Gwangju City established a system of renting bikes for free. All you have to do is go to any metro station with your passport (and a valid phone number). They will hand you a key and a bike that you can use throughout the day. You will have to leave your passport or ID at the station and you will get it back when you bring back the bike.
If you are looking for the bike rental shop, there are two stores in Gwangju.

On foot[edit]
When it comes to Gwangju's district, there are major areas suitable for pedestrians such as the downtown (Geumnam-ro and Chungjang-ro Streets), the neighborhood of Chonnam National Univ. (mostly around the back gate), Sangmu district, U-square, and so forth. These districts are the commercial and public transit hub of the city and clustered together in a way that makes walking around them possible.
Wherever you are in the city, you can see a huge mountain, Mt. Mudeungsan, on the east side. Choose the direction depends on the mountain's location.
There's usually a bus stop within a five- to ten-minute walk in any direction.
Gwangju is mostly flatlands, walking around the city is quite easy.
Numerous mountains and parks with hiking trails can be found in the city.

Talk[edit]
See also: Korean phrasebook
English in Gwangju is not quite as widely understood as it is in Seoul, although people would still know enough to help you out. Taxi drivers are unlikely to have much English knowledge, although there is a translation service the taxi driver can call up if needed. Gwangju also has a distinct dialect different to Seoul. Even if you are pretty good at Korean, understanding conversation between natives would be difficult. They will use standard Korean dialect with foreigners.

See[edit]
Travelers coming to Gwangju can experience a slower paced experience than Seoul, despite still feeling the Ppalli Ppalli (빨리 빨리 - hurry hurry) lifestyle of Korea. Gwangju also serves well as a good hub for touring the surrounding province of South Jeolla.

Dong-Gu (동구, East District)[edit]
Asia Culture Center35.147126.921 Asia Culture Center (국립아시아문화전당) (Culture Center Metro Station). You can see art exhibitions and musical performances at this national art complex. It's one of the largest museums in South Korea, but most of the facilities are built in the basement. Old South Jeolla Provincial Hall, where the Gwangju Uprising started in 1980, is involved in this area. You can also buy Korean-style souvenirs here.It is a place with a very beautiful night view. For this reason, it becomes a popular walking place, dating course, and friendship street for Gwangju citizens at night. However, the location in charge of the city is similar to that of the National Theater + Sejong Center for the Performing Arts + Seoul Arts Center, so there are not many people interested in culture and art, so it is lame during the day.However, as the Gwangju Fringe Festival, which has been promoted since late 2015, was held in connection with the Cultural Center, it quickly emerged as Gwangju's first landmark as many people began to flock as the Cultural Center succeeded in promoting it. It is the largest cultural theme complex in the country, and it is easy to fall off while walking if you get lost.   (updated Dec 2022)

The Jusangjeollidae (pillar-shaped joint cliff) Overlook of Mudeungsan Mountain is the product of volcanic activity during the Cretaceous Period of the Mesozoic Era. Due to prolonged weathering, it has come to form a beautiful natural landscape that resembles a series of pillars or an extended folding screen. The cliffs set against the surrounding greenery and the rest of Mudeungsan Mountain make for a particularly majestic view. (updated May 2017)

Seo-Gu (서구, West District)[edit]
35.154126.9019 Yangdong Market (양동 시장) (Yangdong Market metro station). Since 2005, the river area has been undergoing a surprising facelift, stretching from Gwangju's most famous food, clothing and furniture market, Yangdong Market, all the way out of the city in a southeasterly direction. The river edge is beautifully lit at night, and with its colored lights and shopping areas nearby, is rapidly becoming a symbol of Gwangju - the City of Light and Culture. 
35.1578126.857510 5.18 Memorial Park (5.18 기념공원 (O-il-pal Gi-nyeom-gongwon)). Gwangju's claim to fame is for its own Gwangju uprising, May 18, 1980. There are two memorials for this moment in its history. The main one is found in the beautiful 5.18 Park, in central Sangmu district. There is an exhibition hall there that enlightens visitors to the events that exemplify South Koreans' struggle against authoritarian regimes and their fight for democracy. While there, follow the walking path to the top of the hill where you can then climb a three-story pagoda and take in a nice view of the more modern part of Gwangju. The other memorial to this occasion is the 5.18 Cemetery, located in the northeast of the city, about 50 minutes from the bus terminal. Again, more monuments and dedications to this moment in history - but make sure the museum is actually opened because the long travel is not really worth it otherwise. The cemetery is open year-round. The operating hour of the museum is from 08:00 to 18:00. 
Center Statue
35.1405126.865311 Gwangju Student Independence Movement Memorial Hall (광주학생독립운동기념관). This monument is in the geographical middle of the city. Not widely known, and requires a taxi ride to get to, this monument is rather large and situated in a very quiet park atop a hill. The monument commemorates the student uprising against Japanese Imperialism in the early 1900s. The Park includes an impressive museum with detailed representations of the time. At times English tours are available. 
35.1295126.881412 Pung-am District (풍암지구 (Pungamjigu)). Within Pungam is the World Cup Stadium (월드컵 경기장), connected to the Lotte Outlet Mall. A short walk from the stadium is the Pungam Reservoir, which has fountains, statues, and a walking path. If you enjoy hiking, you can also take an easy hike around Geumdangsan Mountain, which encircles the Pungam residential area. Starting from an Oriental medicine hospital, Wongwangdae hospital, the hike takes on average 2 hours at a moderate pace. 
35.1576126.881513 Kumho World Electronics Market (금호월드). This market occupies 15 stories of an office building right behind the main U-Square Bus terminal. From the first basement to the seventh floor, electronic markets took occupancy of that, and from the eighth floor, the building is composed of studio apartments. The building is easily recognizable from its arched roof of glass sitting jutting out of the skyline. Each floor specializes in a different electronic genre. As a market, the starting price is not always the set price like as Yongsan Electronics Market in Seoul, with some bargaining being possible. Remember to be polite, but also haggle a little if you like. The phrase 'Kkak-ka-Ju-Se-Yo (깎아 주세요)', means 'Give me a Discount please', or alternatively 'Hal-In-Hae-Joo-Sae-Yo (할인해 주세요)' has the same meaning. Sometimes this will work, sometimes not. Haggling with them is even hard to natives, buying something in this building as a foreigner is usually not recommended. 
Nam-Gu (남구, South District)[edit]
35.138126.917114 The Neighborhood of Yangnim-dong district (양림역사문화마을 (Yangnim-dong Modern History Culture Village)), 7, Cheonbyeonjwa-ro 446beon-gil, Nam-gu. The neighborhood of Yangnim-dong district has a variety of modern and contemporary architecture and dense groves of massive 100-year-old trees. The establishment of a church, school, and hospital by Christian missionaries during the Japanese occupation earned the neighborhood the nicknames “Jerusalem of Gwangju” and the “Western Village.” There are some traditional Korean houses, including the Choi Seunghyo House and the Lee Jangwoo House, and more attractions, such as ‘Penguin Village’ (but there is no penguin).Yangrim-dong, Nam-gu (Supia Girls' Middle School/Supia Girls' High School, Woo Il-sun's old house, missionary house, etc.) where modernization sites are located as the birthplace of Christian culture in Gwangju are well established along with the theme of modern history and culture.

If Penguin Village is a place that has become famous by word of mouth due to the voluntary creation of the community, the difference is that the historical and cultural village has been systematically created and became famous by writers who write various magazines and travel journals. However, the location is on the hill right behind Penguin Village, and the top of the hill is Sajik Park. Baeyeong School and Hyangsari Church, which were founded by missionary Bae Ji-ji, are connected to Gwangju Seohyeon Church, and if you cross this Gwangju Seohyeon Church, you will find Chungjang-ro, a busy city in Gwangju.

In Gu-sicheong (구시청; next to ACC and Chungjang district) you can hang out with young people, mostly early to mid-twenties. However, the place is regarded as a meat-market. You should not expect to speak in English in that area. Some pubs or bars are “clean”, but it will take some pains to find out.
Sangmu district is also considered as a meat-market, but Friday night and weekend only. Late 20s to early 30s office workers are the main users.
Chonnam National University's back gate is a bendering & amusement place. The users consist of students mainly. The back gate of Chosun Univ. is almost the same, but the scale of the former one is bigger.

Sleep[edit]
Budget[edit]
The cheapest place to sleep anywhere in Korea is at the local Jjimjil-bang (찜질방; Korean dry sauna). This is a kind of public bathhouse that has a communal room for sleeping on the heated floor. Expect sauna access, cotton pyjamas, a locker to put your stuff in and a price under ₩10,000. There's a bare possibility that is robbed by the thief when you're sleeping but, Be Vigilant at least.

35.14152126.918221 Welbing Geongang Laendeu (웰빙건강랜드 (Wellbeing Health Land)), 116, Baekseo-ro, Dong-gu (minimum cab fare from downtown, say “Welbing-geon-gang-laendeu-ro gajuseyo (Wellbeing Health Land, Please)”; or on foot, from the ACC, go to the river, turn left, and walk two bridges down; it's on the corner). With both Jjimjil-bangs in the Geumnamno shut down, this is the closest one left.

Mid-range[edit]
Gaudy motels abound in Korea, and this is no less true in Gwangju. The main concentration of motels is in and around Sangmu district, between the Sangmu and Uncheon subway stops, or at the front of Gwangju station, and Cheomdan district, near the Lotte Mart. Motels can range from ₩30,000-50,000 and tend to be very seedy. One can judge the quality of a "love" motel by the movie selection usually proudly displayed near the cashier and the vending machines located throughout the motel.

Stay safe[edit]
Generally speaking, Gwangju is as safe as most places in South Korea, which is to say very safe.
Gwangju is especially very safe to roam around freely at night and all day long. There isn't a single dangerous area in town.
There is no any gang activity in Gwangju. Sometimes, you can see delinquent pre-high school-aged boys in dim alleys or parks. However, they couldn't care less about you. The boys are just interested in smoking or drinking surreptitiously and chit-chat with themselves. If you are a well-built man or woman, they will just gaze in awe at you. Just ignore them – they wouldn't actually want to have a conversation with you because they do not speak English well.
Unlike in some other cities, Gwangju's stations and metro areas are not dangerous. Just keep away from extremely intoxicated people.
Rush hour and traffic congestion are of short duration and not as severe as in other cities. Drivers in Gwangju are somewhat gentle. Just watch out when you cross the road.
You don't have to worry about natural disasters. Sometimes storms or torrential rains come, but they are not severe.
Gwangju's tap water is "drinkable" however residents tend to boil their water or purchase affordable bottled water, or fill their own bottles at local parks or at the mountain springs that surround the town. Korean are just unfamiliar to the flavor of tap water because finding mineral water has been accessible in the land before.
There are occasionally sand storms and fine dust from China covering Gwangju. You should avoid going outside if one passes through, or wear a mask.
