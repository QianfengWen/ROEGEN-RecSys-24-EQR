As the local dogs do, walk along the side of the highway between the store, motel and restaurant.

See[edit]
The main sight and reason for visiting the area is obviously Glacier National Park. Northeast of the town is Chief Mountain, a very prominent peak with almost vertical edges.
The statue of a rodeo cowboy outside the school is an interesting cast sculpture. The old wooden church above the cafe and gas station is also worth a brief look.
