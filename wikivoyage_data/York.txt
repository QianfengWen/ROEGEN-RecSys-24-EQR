York is a medievalist's paradise
The ancient cathedral city of York has a history dating back over 2000 years. Romans, Saxons, Vikings, and Britons from all eras have each left their mark. It is home to some of Europe's best-preserved historical buildings and structures, including York Minster and dozens of other churches, the Shambles medieval shopping street, countless handsome townhouses, and the city's walls and gatehouses. Other popular attractions on the bucket lists of York's eight million annual visitors include the Jorvik Viking Centre and Britain's National Railway Museum.
York is in North Yorkshire, England, and is the unofficial capital of the entire region of Yorkshire. The city is a perfect base for exploring "God's own county", having some of the finest hotels around, and all the comforts and amenities of a large city, while retaining the atmosphere and scale of a small town. York's shops, markets, pubs, and restaurants delight in offering Yorkshire-made produce, so you will find it difficult not to overindulge.
A UNESCO City of Media Arts, York has a festival for every occasion, celebrating everything that has shaped the city's culture over the centuries: music, dance, chocolate, theatre, literature, horseracing, digital media. Whatever time of year you come, you're sure to find a gig, show or exhibition that tickles your fancy.
So, plunge forward, and discover York!

Orientation[edit]
Although only the sixth-largest city in Yorkshire and having no official status, York is regarded as the county's capital, and is also positioned just east of its geographic centre. For 1800 years, it was the largest and most important city in northern England, though today has a rather modest population just shy of 200,000 people. Despite its size, York packs in more history and culture than many much larger places, and is a fascinating and beautiful destination any time of year.





'Whip-Ma-Whop-Ma' what?
York is popularly known as a place "where the streets are gates, the gates are bars, and the bars are pubs!" If none of this makes any sense to you, remember that York has Viking roots, and the Norsemen also influenced the local language. So, yes, many streets are called gates (from Old Norse gata), among them Micklegate, Fossgate, and Whip-Ma-Whop-Ma-Gate, the shortest street in York with an insensibly long name, apparently meaning "What a street!" The fortified gates in the city walls are invariably known as bars (think "barrier" and it makes sense), pedestrianised areas are logically called footstreets, and simple alleys take on a new magic as snickelways. Need a drink after all that? Ask for the nearest pub.


York city centre is a compact and dense warren of mostly pedestrianised streets lined with centuries-old buildings in a mix of architectural styles, from Roman and Viking remnants, through timber frame medieval structures, to much grander stone and brick edifices from later periods. The centre straddles both banks of two rivers - the Ouse (pronounced ooze) and the Foss - which merge just south of the castle. At the city's heart stands the imposing York Minster, one of the largest Gothic cathedrals in the world, and the mother church for northern England's Anglican community. The Archbishop of York (Stephen Cottrell, since 2020) holds the third-highest office in the Church of England, after the King and the Archbishop of Canterbury. York's old town is completely encircled by a series of defensive medieval walls. At just over 2 miles (3.2 km) long, 13 feet (4 m) high, and 6 feet (1.8 m) thick, they are the UK's most extensive and best-preserved city walls.
Most visitor attractions are within or just outside these walls, so you will seldom find yourself venturing into York's outer neighbourhoods. However, if you do, you will find them pleasant and residential, mostly containing red brick houses from the 19th and 20th centuries. There is a modern university campus around Heslington in the south-eastern suburbs, a large racecourse called the Knavesmire in the south-west, and extensive parks along the Ouse's journey through the northern and southern suburbs. This urban sprawl is bounded by a modern day city wall of sorts: the ring road separates York from its rural surroundings, the well-endowed farmlands and villages of the Vale of York.

History[edit]
York has played a crucial role in many eras of English history, and the city's own story closely mirrors that of the country as a whole.
Evidence of human settlement in York dates back to 8000 BC, but the city wasn't founded until 71 AD by the Romans, who named it Eboracum, as a Latinisation of the Celtic Eburākon, meaning "yew tree place". Eboracum began as little more than a military outpost at the confluence of the rivers Ouse and Foss, but quickly became one of the most important cities in Roman Britain, and from 211 was the capital of the Britannia Inferior province; Emperors Hadrian, Septimius Severus and Constantius I all visited during their military campaigns against the native Britons and Picts. The latter of the three actually died during his stay, and his son, the future Constantine the Great, was first proclaimed Emperor in the city by his generals. Constantine later converted to Christianity, and legalised freedom of religion throughout the Empire. Eboracum was prosperous and particularly attracted merchants and retired veterans of the Emperors' wars. Why said retirees apparently chose the damp and chilly Yorkshire climate over the Empire's many Mediterranean provinces remains one of history's great mysteries.
After Rome, the 5th century brought the arrival of the Angles - the first Englishmen. This period saw the expansion of the city's trading prowess, the founding of York Minster as a small wooden church, and a spell of political prominence under the Kings of Northumbria. By 735, the Minster was already important enough to be the seat of an archbishop. But Eoforwic ("place rich in boar"), as it was now known, proved too much of a success and quickly caught the attention of avaricious Norsemen: Vikings had been harrying and raiding the north of England since the 700s, but why sail for days just to snatch a pig and a bracelet and rush back to sea, when they could harvest this rich farmland for their own? So, in 866, a huge army of Danes captured Eoforwic and, realising that name was a hopeless mouthful, rechristened their new city Jórvík (pronounced "Yor-vik"). From here, they controlled pretty much all of northern and eastern England, in a region known as the Danelaw. Jórvík was pretty perfect as a Viking capital, since its inland location offered defence and shelter, while the Ouse provided their longboats easy access to the sea via the Humber. Even though Viking power waxed and waned over the centuries, large numbers of Scandinavian people settled permanently in the region, meaning Jórvík was a bilingual (Old English and Old Norse) city at the time of the Norman Conquest.
By 1066, the Vikings had once again been ousted by the Saxons, but nursed ambitions to return. Harold Godwinson was crowned King of England, but faced a combined invasion by his exiled brother Tostig and the Norse king Harald Hardrada. The invaders won a battle at Fulford just outside York, but King Harold marched north and defeated them at Stamford Bridge 15 mi (24 km) east. Yet, while his back was turned, William the Conqueror's Normans invaded from across the English Channel. Harold's exhausted army marched south again, this time to crippling defeat at Hastings. England came under Norman rule, and the Anglo-Saxon/Norse society that the country had developed, and York exemplified, was dismantled swiftly and brutally.

York Minster
The Harrying of the North was a violent campaign of oppression against rebellious northerners in the years after the Conquest. From his castle in York, King William ordered the mass murder of civilians, demolition of numerous villages and burning of crops across the north of England, and York was also heavily damaged. As in the rest of the country, Normans became the new aristocracy, with the English and remaining Norse people reduced to serfdom. From this point on, the Normans consolidated their rule with the construction of castles, monasteries and great cathedrals. York Minster's Gothic design first took shape in the 12th century, while the present city walls, their gates (known as bars), and Clifford's Tower also cemented the Normans' impact on York's cityscape.
The late Medieval period produced much important architectural and cultural heritage, which are still evident today. The centuries-long construction of the Minster finally wrapped in 1472, while the higgledy-piggledy timber-frame shops of the Shambles mostly date from the 14th and 15th centuries. York's Mystery Plays, performing weird and wonderful Bible stories, were begun in the same era and continue to the present day. Then, in 1455, England was consumed by civil war: rival royals from York and Lancaster fought a brutal series of campaigns for control of the crown. Yorkist armies marched under the banner of a white rose, while their enemy Lancastrians followed the red rose, hence the name of this conflict, the Wars of the Roses. The last Yorkist king, Richard III, was finally defeated in combat at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, 30 years after the wars began. The Lancastrians' leader, Henry VII, became the first monarch of the Tudor dynasty, and both York in general and King Richard in particular were subsequently demonised.
The city's economy and status went into a long decline which wouldn't be recovered until after England's second Civil War, during which Royalist York was again on the wrong side of history, and besieged by the ultimate victors (Parliament) for 10 weeks in 1644. The siege and subsequent storming of the city destroyed many medieval buildings, but paved the way for fashionable new brick townhouses to be built as York regained its mojo in the late 17th and 18th centuries.
This resurgence in the city's wealth may have been what saved York's ancient streets from the smoke-stack industry which sprang up in many other northern towns from the late 18th century onwards. However, the industrial revolution didn't bypass York completely. In the 1840s, the first long-distance railway raced north from London to Edinburgh, and York's station was constructed as a cathedral of sorts in homage to the great connecting power of trains, while the locomotive yards next door kept the country's engines moving. The city found its other manufacturing niche soon after when the Rowntree family opened their chocolate factory. Many of their creations - among them KitKat, Aero and Smarties - are still staple snacks in the UK and around the world. The Rowntrees, known for their philanthropy, were Quakers, a religious group which has had a strong presence in York for three centuries, and whose members have done much to shape its development - they were also behind the burgeoning rail industry.
While its prominence and relative size in comparison to other cities have dwindled since the 19th century, and its status as capital of the north credibly challenged by the likes of Manchester and Leeds, York remains prosperous and lively; in 2018, it was named the best city to live in the UK by The Sunday Times. In 2021, the city celebrated its 1,950th anniversary, and today's visitor will easily recognise and marvel at just how well York has preserved aspects from every major episode of its history, as much in the way of culture and traditions as in the built environment.

Summer brings very long days and the best chance of sun and warmth, and is thus the finest time to make the most of the city's squares, parks and rivers. If you really like flat caps and whippets, then be sure to be in town on 1 August for Yorkshire Day, when a procession of proud Yorkshiremen march their white rose flags all through the streets. Summer visitors may also get the chance to see festivals dedicated to chocolate, early music and folk dance, and the really lucky may even catch a mystery play - although these follow an irregular schedule and don't take place every year.
On the other hand, summer is when everyone visits, so is not the best time if you don't like mingling with thousands of your fellow tourists. Besides, nobody comes to North Yorkshire for the weather, and summer washouts are just as likely as heatwaves, so why not take a punt on autumn or winter? Some of the city's key annual events, such as the Viking Festival and Christmas celebrations, take place in the chillier half of the year. What's more, you need short days in order to experience the magical atmosphere of a twilit evensong in the Minster, and you need to get cold to fully appreciate the cosiness of a hearty meal and pint next to a roaring fire in one of York's pubs.
By the way, if you're planning to use York as a base to explore the wider region's countryside and coast, then spring is the season for you. The fields and trees are at their greenest, wildflowers are in bloom, visitor numbers are fewer, and the late spring weather is often better suited to hiking and walking than high summer. And honestly, who doesn't love the sight of spring lambs gamboling about joyfully?

If you plan to do a lot of sightseeing, you can save money by purchasing the Visit York Pass, a ticket which gives you access to almost 40 attractions in York and its region. The pass also includes a 24-hour ticket for the City Sightseeing bus tour, discounts on meals, car hire, taxis and more.
You can get passes for one, two, three or six days. The pass is digital and issued via email to your smartphone; buy online or at the Visitor Information Centre.
The pass is valid for 12 months after purchase and is activated once you enter your first attraction. The one-day pass is valid for one calendar day, not a 24-hour period. Two- and six-day passes are valid for consecutive calendar days. Three-day passes can be used for any three days out of six. Passes cover the entry fee of every participating attraction, but do not allow you to queue jump or to have privileged access. As with every tourist pass, the more attractions you visit, the more money you'll save; a downside to this approach is you might find yourself rushing around town instead of taking everything in.

By plane[edit]
53.3539-2.2751 Manchester Airport (MAN IATA), 85 mi (137 km) south-west of York, has global direct connections, including from North America, Africa, the Middle East, Pakistan, East Asia, the Caribbean and pretty much everywhere in Europe. A direct train to York, operated by Transpennine Express, runs every 30 min, taking 1 hr 50 min. By road, from the airport, follow the M56 onto the M60 Manchester Ring Road (east/anticlockwise), then at junction 18 take the M62 towards Leeds. This takes you across Saddleworth Moor, the highest section of motorway in Britain; in good weather, it's very scenic, but snow and extremely dense fog can badly affect or even close the route any time of the year. At junction 29, take the M1 north. This soon merges onto the A1 (M), and from here you take the next exit for the A64 towards York.
53.865-1.662 Leeds-Bradford Airport (LBA IATA) is the closest airport to York, 31 mi (50 km) away by road. It has decent connections across western Europe, and is mostly served by budget carriers. Aer Lingus and KLM connect to their respective hubs at Dublin and Amsterdam Schiphol. The airport is north of Leeds, so you can mostly dodge the city traffic by following the A658 past Harrogate to the A59, where you pick up signs to York. By public transport, take bus A1 from the airport into Central Leeds. From here, you can take the train: Crosscountry, LNER and Transpennine Express all operate trains to York, taking 25 min and offering a 'turn-up-and-go' frequency.
The London airports obviously have a huge range of flights, especially Heathrow (LHR IATA) and Gatwick (LGW IATA). However, by public transport you have to travel into central London before heading north to York from King's Cross Station: from Heathrow use a combination of the Elizabeth line or Heathrow Express and London Underground; from Gatwick take the Thameslink train to St Pancras, adjacent to King's Cross. LNER trains depart King's Cross every 30 min and take roughly 2 hr. Alternatively, with a car you have to endure a long journey (at least 5 hours in good traffic) around the M25 ring road and up the A1.
By train[edit]
Wikivoyage has a guide to Rail travel in Great Britain.

The roof of York station
York is on the East Coast mainline, with LNER trains running every 30 min or so from Doncaster (20 min), Durham (50 min), Edinburgh Waverley (2 hr 30 min), Leeds (25 min), London King's Cross (2 hr) and Newcastle upon Tyne (1 hr). Hourly Crosscountry trains link to York from Birmingham New Street (2 hr 45 min – 3 hr 15 min), Bristol Temple Meads (4 hr 10 min), Plymouth (6 hr 15 min) and Sheffield (45 min – 1 hr). Transpennine Express trains run twice-hourly from Manchester Airport (1 hr 45 min), Manchester Piccadilly (1 hr 30 min) and Manchester Victoria (1 hr 15 min), via Huddersfield (47 min) and Leeds, and hourly from Liverpool Lime Street (2 hr 10 min). Transpennine and Northern branch lines run from Scarborough (50 min) and Hull (1 hr 10 min) on Yorkshire's east coast, and from Harrogate (40 min) and Knaresborough (30 min) in the west of the county. Although there are multiple train companies, times and prices for all can be found on the National Rail Planner or by calling ☏ +44 845 748 4950 (non-geographic).
King's Cross in London is adjacent to St Pancras International, the British terminus for high-speed Eurostar trains from the near continent. This very easy interchange brings York within 4 hr 30 min from Paris and Brussels, 3 hr 30 from Lille, and under 6 hr from Amsterdam.

53.958-1.09293 York railway station, Station Road, YO24 1AB. Just outside the western walls, access the city north along Station Road for the Museum Gardens and Minster, or south via Queen Street to Micklegate and the Jorvik Centre. Bus stops for many services are in the station forecourt, and any bus that doesn't pass here is likely to run through Rougier Street just inside the walls. The excellent National Railway Museum is adjacent on the west and is signposted from the platforms. There is no left luggage service at the station; the nearest one is on High Petergate, about 50 m from York Minster.   (updated Nov 2022)
By bus[edit]
Navigating York's streets is a breeze
National Express operate daytime and overnight coaches from Birmingham, Hull, Leeds, London, Middlesbrough, Milton Keynes, Sheffield, and Sunderland. The coaches call outside the railway station, at 53.957-1.0914 bus stop RC for northbound services, and at 53.958-1.0925 bus stop RG for southbound services. Megabus do not serve York, but do call at Leeds.
Coastliner run two different bus routes (840 and 843) through York from Leeds (840, 843), Tadcaster (840, 843), Malton (840, 843), Pickering (840), Scarborough (843) and Whitby (840) every 30 minutes during the daytime and every hour in the evenings. Both routes have two calling points in York city centre: outside the railway station at stops RC and RJ, and on 53.959-1.0766 The Stonebow. The last buses to York depart Leeds at 10:15PM, Scarborough at 8:25PM, and Whitby at 5PM. However, daytrippers from Leeds can get the last bus back from York at 11:05PM. Enjoy the view: Coastliner's 840 service has won the prodigious title of "Britain's most scenic bus route".

By car[edit]
Wikivoyage has a guide to Driving in the United Kingdom.
From the south, take the M1 north to junction 32, then the M18 east to junction 2, A1 (M) north to junction 44 and finally the A64 east to York. Or you can stay on the M1 all the way to the A64, but it gets very congested around Sheffield and Leeds in rush hour. Lighter traffic may be found by taking the A1 all the way from London. From the north, approach via the A1 (M) onto the A59 east, or take the A19. If you're coming from the urban north-west, follow the M62 east onto the M1; from the Yorkshire Dales and Lakes, use the A59. Approach from Leeds using the A64, and from Hull (for ferries from Rotterdam) by the A1079.

The old city is not designed for driving and is positively hostile to parking. If you are just visiting York for the day, don't try to park in town. Instead, use one of the park and ride sites, located close to the ring road and well signposted from the main roads. Each site is connected to the city centre by a unique colour-coded bus route, generally every 15 minutes, seven days a week. A day's parking is free, and a return bus fare costs £3.60 (May 2023). However, you can't use the park and ride overnight, so if you are staying in York, make sure that your accommodation offers parking, or consider leaving your car at home.

The City of York Council have a website named i-Travel York, which provides unbiased information for travelling around the city on foot, by bike, by bus and by car.

On foot[edit]
The best way to discover York: the city centre is small enough to walk from one side to the other in 20 minutes, and there is only a short distance on flat terrain between most of the sights. That said, the winding, narrow streets can be confusing and aren't always well-signposted, so a map is handy.
Some streets within the old city (i.e. inside the city walls) are pedestrianised during the day, closed to all cars except disabled drivers and emergency vehicles between 10:30AM and 5PM daily. You can see a map of these roads, locally known as footstreets, on i-Travel York. Some streets are subject to additional controls, for instance the Shambles is pedestrian-only at all times. Take care walking around the city centre when the roads open to car traffic at 5PM, as they fill up quickly with delivery vehicles servicing local shops and businesses.
If you enjoy walking, you must do the 2-mile (3.2-km) city wall circuit (see below for details), which offers views all around and should give you a feel for York's layout. Additionally, footpaths line the River Ouse for most of its journey through the city north to south, and there is a lot of parkland to discover alongside with the promise of wildlife sightings - see i-Travel's wildlife walks booklet for ideas.

By bike[edit]
York is one of the most cycle-friendly cities in the UK - there's an extensive network of cycle routes in and around the city, and most of the traffic controls have been set up to give cyclists priority. There are no significant hills in or around the city centre, which is a big help. The river path along the Ouse contains some wonderful bike routes out of the city. Also beware that police and CCTV operators take a very dim view of cycling without lights after dusk, or cycling in the city centre pedestrianised area before 5PM, and will hand out an on-the-spot £60 fine for doing so. Download your York Cycle Route Map for free from iTravel York.

53.945-1.0773 Get Cycling, 22 Hospital Fields Road, YO10 4DZ (1 mi (1.6 km) S of city centre, via riverside walk or buses 7, 18, 25, 26, 36, 42, 200, 415), ☏ +44 1904 636812, admin@getcycling.org.uk.

Other tariffs for tandem, cargo and disability bikes. 10% discount for groups of 10 or more. Helmets, locks and lights free. (updated May 2023)
By bus[edit]
Bus services connect all the points of interest in the city. Download a PDF of the city's network map here. A variety of operators run the individual routes, but thankfully you can still buy a ticket which works on every company and line in the city within a set period: All York comes in three flavours, one day (£4.90), one week (£19) and one month (£66) passes (May 2023). The day tickets are not 24 hour passes, rather they are valid until midnight on the day of purchase. If you are staying a week or longer, consider getting a smartcard, onto which you can load your All York ticket. Some operators accept contactless payment by credit and debit card. These tickets are only valid on public bus services, and not on sightseeing tours.
That said, the majority of bus routes are operated by First York, a private company. Adult single fares are £2 (May 2023), but increase for longer journeys. You can purchase your ticket with cash or contactless. For groups looking for a discount, here's a corker: if you are in a group divisible by five, you can get a ticket which gives five people unlimited travel in York for a whole day, valid every day of the week after 9AM Monday to Friday, and anytime weekends and bank holidays. You can only buy this ticket via the First Bus app[dead link], but each five-person ticket costs £9 (May 2023), so as long as you travel everywhere as a group it is great value compared even to the All York pass.

By taxi[edit]
Like everywhere else in the UK, all taxi services are provided by private companies, but the fares are metered and strictly regulated by the local government authority. In this case, it is the City of York Council which sets the rates, the details of which you can download from the city's website. During the daytime (7AM-10PM), the base fare is £2.90, while the nighttime (10PM-7AM) base fare is £3.70. To these, 10p is added for every 80 metres travelled.

By car[edit]
The best advice for driving in York is don't. The roads were designed for carts pulled by oxen, and the city council is actively discouraging car use through a combination of high parking charges and traffic-calming measures. If you are bringing a car to York, your best bet is to leave it in a park and ride, at your hotel, or if absolutely necessary, a city centre car park. 
If you're using York as a base from which to explore the Yorkshire countryside, you will find all the major car hire companies in town, mostly by the railway station.

Clifford's Tower
There's plenty to see in York, but if you leave without visiting the Minster and either the Jorvik Viking Centre or the National Railway Museum, you're doing it wrong. If you only have a day, prioritise two of these.
Aside from these three standout attractions, the joy of York is in wandering the ancient streets and coming across surprising buildings and beautiful views all by yourself. You might find old churches, timber-framed shops, the ruins of an abbey, or the leftovers of medieval defences.

Landmarks[edit]
53.961944-1.0819441 York Minster (Cathedral of St Peter in York), Deangate, YO1 7HH, ☏ +44 1904 557 200, info@yorkminster.org. Minster visits: M-Sa 9AM-4:30PM, Su 12:30PM-3PM; Museum: M-Sa 10AM-4:30PM, Su 1PM-3:15PM; Worship: 4 or more services daily 7:30AM-6PM. Seat of the Archbishop of York and the largest Gothic cathedral in northern Europe, York Minster dominates the skyline and dates back to the 8th century at least. The inside of the cathedral has beautiful stained glass and several interesting and peculiar features – look for the modern statues signalling "Christ is here" in semaphore and the dragon hanging from near the ceiling. The Undercroft Museum, beneath the Minster, displays centuries worth of archaeological findings in an interactive display. Then, climb the 275 steps to the top of the Minster's Central Tower to experience panoramic views from York's highest spot (ages 8+ only). The nightly Evensong worship has haunting acoustics, and is the only way of accessing the cathedral on Sunday late afternoons. On the south side of the Minster outside, don't miss the 53.961826-1.0817452 statue of Constantine the Great, who was in 306 AD proclaimed emperor of Rome in York. At the far end of the plaza from this is a 53.961634-1.0818133 Roman column which was unearthed beneath the Minster and reerected in 1971 to mark the 1,900th anniversary of the city's founding. Once you've seen all this, relax in the 53.963206-1.0824794 Dean's Park - a simple expanse of grass and trees that affords views of the north side of the Minster. In spring or summer, you may catch a glimpse of nesting peregrine falcons. Adult £11.50, senior £10.50, student with ID £9, child under 17 free. Access to Minster, museum and guided tour included; £5 extra for tower. Worship, park and plaza free. York Pass accepted.   (updated Mar 2021)




York's medieval pogrom
Jews settled in England for the first time in recorded history after the Norman Conquest. Being exempt from Catholic laws prohibiting money-lending, Jewish people were seen as engines for economic growth, and were thus granted special immunities under the Crown. As one of the most important cities in the kingdom, York had a significant Jewish population by the 12th century, but the ongoing wars of religion in the Holy Land and indebted townspeople's ill-feeling towards their creditors fuelled antisemitism. On 16 March 1190 - the Friday of Passover - in such a climate, all it took was for an accidental fire to be blamed on Jews, and a lynch mob was formed.
York's Jewish families were forced to flee and invoke the royal protection granted to them by seeking refuge in Clifford's Tower. Once inside, they were effectively under siege, however, and the soldiers who were supposed to be protecting them turned coat and joined the baying mob outside. At some point, a fire started in the tower - whether by the occupants or their tormentors is unknown. Vastly outnumbered, and faced with an ultimatum to convert to Christianity or be slaughtered, the community realised the only way out was suicide; on the advice of their Rabbi, the father of each family killed his wife and children, before taking his own life.
Consumed by flames, the wooden tower burnt to the ground, and among its ashes the Earthly remains of 150 people.


53.955856-1.0799925 Clifford's Tower, Tower Street, YO1 9SA, ☏ +44 1904 646 940. Daily 10AM-6PM. In the 11th century, the Normans built a castle here to keep the Vikings at bay and subdue the local population following their conquest of England. The Vikings being Vikings, they promptly smashed it, so the Normans built bigger and better - the tower you see today was the castle's keep. The tower was the scene of the infamous massacre of York's Jews in 1190. In 1684, its interior was wrecked by an explosion, but the hollow tower is now the oldest remnant of the castle. The rest fell into disrepair, before being re-built as a gaol, and in modern times housing the Castle Museum. Access is by very steep steps up the hillock; it's a bit like climbing a pyramid. After closure, you can still climb to the front door and look back over the square - this is especially atmospheric after dark. Adult £8.10, child £5.40, concession £7.30, English Heritage members free.   (updated Jun 2022)
53.9568-1.080066 Fairfax House, Castlegate, YO1 9RN, ☏ +44 1904 655 543, info@fairfaxhouse.co.uk. Sa–Th 11AM–4PM, F entrance by guided tour only 11AM, 2PM. A Georgian townhouse built as the winter home for the Viscount Fairfax and his daughter, which has today been lovingly restored as a charming example of aristocratic life in York. It is decorated and furnished similar to how it would have been in the 1760s, almost exclusively using objects from the private collection of chocolatier Noel Terry (1889–1979). Giuseppe Cortese's elaborately-wrought stucco ceilings are a particular highlight, adorning half a dozen of the Fairfaxs' stately rooms. 'Gregory the Townhouse Mouse' will keep your kids entertained with his exploration trails around the property. Audio tours in eight languages. Adult £7.50, guided tour £9. York Pass accepted.   (updated Dec 2021)
53.959734-1.0854687 Guildhall, St. Helen’s Square, YO1 9QN, ☏ +44 1904 553 979, civic@york.gov.uk. Built in the 15th century as a meeting hall for the guilds of York, the Guildhall is now also home to the city council chamber. Guilds are associations of artisans and merchants of a particular industry akin to something between a professional association, a trade union and a monopolistic cartel. In the middle ages, these guilds had a dominant role in the economies of every English city. However, the Guildhall you see today is a faithful replica, as the original was mostly destroyed by bombing in 1942. Notice the stained-glass window depicting York's history.   (updated Mar 2021)
53.962385-1.0866068 King's Manor, Exhibition Square, YO1 7EP, ☏ +44 1904 320 000. M-F 8AM-6PM. Now the very apt home for the University of York's Archaeology Department, this was a royal headquarters during the Tudor and Stuart dynasties (16th and 17th centuries). As this is a working academic building, you may have to content yourself with admiring the Grade I listed architecture from the outside, unless you can pass as a scholar that is! Respect the students and staff, or you'll ruin it for future visitors. Free.   (updated Mar 2021)
"God give us good fortune"
53.95785-1.0787989 Merchant Adventurers' Hall, Fossgate, YO1 9XD, ☏ +44 1904 654 818, enquiries@merchantshallyork.org. Su-F 10AM-4:30PM, Sa 10AM-1:30PM. Remarkable timbered guild hall, built by city merchants between 1357 and 1361.

The largest railway museum in the world, with a magnificent collection of locomotives, rolling stock, railway equipment, documents and records. The bulk of it is British, but there are also great snorting monsters from China and the U.S. Highlights include Queen Victoria's opulent Royal Train, famous locos such as Stephenson's Rocket and Mallard, and a first-generation Shinkansen - the only one outside of Japan. When it's not cruising the rails in summer, Flying Scotsman overwinters at the NRM. Out in the yard, a steam-engine hauls rides in the summer, and a miniature railway operates year-round. And the best thing for railbuffs: the museum is in sight of York station and has a viewing deck overlooking the East Coast Main Line!. Museum and all exhibitions free. Steam rides £4, miniature railway £3, under-2s free.   (updated Mar 2021)
53.959289-1.08003411 Snickelways. These are the famous medieval (and later) alleys and narrow streets that thread the centre of the city, typically lined with timber frame and brick houses and shops. They are all pedestrianised in the daytime, and indeed most are too narrow for vehicles to use. See Mark W Jones' book A Walk Around the Snickelways of York (ISBN 1871125723) or its hardback companion The Complete Snickelways of York (ISBN 1871125049) with their quirky, hand-written descriptions, and follow his suggested route taking in 50 of the snickelways within the city walls. Jones himself coined the term for his books in 1983, as a triple portmanteau of the Yorkshire dialect words snicket and ginnel, and their standard English equivalent alleyway.   (updated Dec 2021)

The York Archaeological Trust run four attractions, which can be visited on various individual or combined tickets. The most useful of these is the Triple Ticket, valid for 12 months, and allowing you entrance to three of the Trust's attractions: Jorvik, Barley Hall and DIG. This is available for £18 per adult, £14.50 per concession, and £12.50 per child.

53.9578-1.0805615 Jorvik Viking Centre, 19 Coppergate, YO1 9WT (within the Coppergate Shopping Centre), ☏ +44 1904 615 505, jorvik@yorkat.co.uk. Daily Apr-Oct 10AM-6PM, Nov-Mar 10AM-4PM, longer hours during school holidays. Reconstruction of York as it might have looked 1000+ years ago. The visit takes the form of a sit-down ride as you experience the sights, sounds, smells and diverse languages and faces of everyday 10th century life, with the aid of animatronics, dioramas and touchscreen technology. Although a bit like the Viking version of It's a Small World, everything you see has been meticulously researched and the centre is itself built on the archaeological remains of the real Jórvík. Audio commentary available in 15 languages. After the ride is a collection of artefacts, including replicas - for more visit the Yorkshire Museum. Adult £12.50, child 5-16 years £8.50, concession £10.50. Fasttrack entry with Pastport. York Pass accepted.   (updated Mar 2021)
53.96083-1.08258616 Barley Hall, 2 Coffee Yard, off Stonegate, YO1 8AR, ☏ +44 1904 615 505, barleyhall@yorkat.co.uk. Daily 10AM-3PM/4PM. Reconstruction of a medieval townhouse. Built in the 14th century by the monks of Nostell Priory in Wakefield, but serially chopped, changed and neglected over the centuries. By 1970 it was a plumber's storeroom, on the brink of demolition. It's now been rebuilt to how it was in the 15th century, discarding later additions. Its detractors say this was more like a retro-fit and prettification of history, but it's difficult to see how anything more "authentic" could have been made viable, and it can be accurately described as a large piece of experimental archaeology carried out by experts. Adult £6.50, child 5-16 years £3.50, concession £5. Combo ticket with Jorvik: adult £15, child £10, concession £12. York Pass accepted.   (updated Mar 2021)

One of York's more unusual sights is this 18th century windmill, unique in Britain for having five sails, which sits rather conspicuously in the middle - literally - of a very ordinary residential street. After falling into disuse in the 1930s, the mill was painstakingly restored to working condition by volunteers between 2001 and 2012. On open days, you can see the sails moving, then go inside the mill and understand how the power of wind is harnessed to turn the millstone and grind wheat and spelt into flour. The same volunteers are on hand to answer your questions and sell you some of their freshly-ground flour!. Adult £3, child (5-18 years) £1.   (updated Mar 2021)

As it is used as an outdoor history classroom during term time, access to the centre for the general public is limited to weekends and school holidays, and if you want to make the most of the 'living history' aspects (reenactors, stories from long ago, hands-on activities, weapons training etc), you'll need some children with you. The range of cool stuff for them to do will make you wish you were a kid again. To find exactly which activities are happening on which days see the site's events page.The Derwent Valley Light Railway is the half-mile remnant of a line which once linked York to Selby. Nowadays, you can enjoy unlimited - if admittedly short - diesel-hauled rides from Murton Park's cute little station.

Tours and trips[edit]
Walking the walls with superb views
53.9553-1.0818 City walls walk, ☏ +44 1904 551 550, ycc@york.gov.uk. Daily 8AM-dusk. Enjoy the great views, and try to imagine yourself in the role of city watch keeping a lookout for approaching enemy armies. The walls are medieval, built on Roman foundations, though the Station Road bridges are modern. The total walk is around 2 mi (3.2 km): if short on time or energy, the best section is along the western perimeter from 53.96271-1.08519 Bootham Bar to 53.96277-1.0785510 Monk Bar, close to the Minster. There never was a wall to the north-east, as the swamps along the River Foss were sufficient defence, so this is the least interesting section, where you have to walk along busy Foss Islands Road. No dogs, except guide dogs, are allowed on the walls. You can download a map and guide of the walls courtesy of the Friends of York Walls here. Free, except the Micklegate Bar, and Monk Bar towers, which are small museums.   (updated Oct 2022)
 Lucky Cat Trail (start on the Shambles), ☏ +44 1904 541 122. Cats have been considered good-luck omens in York for centuries, and cat statues were once placed on buildings throughout the city to ward off rats, mice, and the plague they were thought to carry. A mummified cat was even found concealed in the Mansion House. The original statues have now all long-since weathered away, but the concept was resurrected by a local architect in 1979. Since then, more and more buildings have added sculptures of cats clinging to walls or perched on balconies. Today, you can follow a trail around the old town in an attempt to find 22 cats, and spot plenty of landmarks while you're doing so. Download the trail map for free. (updated Mar 2021)

Learn[edit]
York is an excellent place to be a student; it's friendly, compact, walkable and beautiful, with a lively cultural scene to rival cities many times its size. You'll find York a cheaper place to live and study than other historic cities down south, such as Bath, Cambridge or Oxford, though certainly pricier than other, less desirable, parts of the North. Being on the East Coast Main Line, it's within easy reach of most parts of England and Scotland.

The departments of English literature, chemistry, computer science and psychology are particularly well-regarded internationally as leading research centres. York is a collegiate university with around 18,000 students across nine colleges, though is not particularly old for such an historic city, being founded in only 1963.   (updated Apr 2021)

Buy[edit]
York comes highly recommended for its unique shops and boutiques. There's the usual range of high street stores, but York is also a great place for independent shops, especially if you're looking for gifts, high-end English and Italian fashion, books, or - it has to be said - tourist tat! Shops in York change from year to year, but the beautiful old-fashioned shop fronts, both medieval wood and Victorian red brick, haven't changed much since they were first built. The extensive pedestrianisation and interesting architecture make shopping and spending a pleasure for even the most miserly Yorkshireman.

Local specialities[edit]

A breaded York ham
As capital of Yorkshire, the county's cuisine is front and centre on many of York's menus. This is honest and rustic fare, in which generous portions are the norm, and large tasting platters are common. Yorkshire puddings, pies, local game, lamb and beef are all prized by restaurateurs, as are the local cheeses: wensleydale from the Dales, shepherd's purse blues from north of Thirsk and St Helen's Farm hard goat's cheese, produced in the Vale of York. The fish and crab in restaurants is often landed at East Coast ports such as Grimsby and Whitby, while the county's Norse connections are maintained by the serving of Yorkshire-made gravadlax.
The city itself has two famous products: ham and chocolate.
York ham has been produced within the city walls for hundreds of years, and far-fetched local legend states that the first hams were smoked with sawdust generated by the building of the Minster. Made with the meat of the large white pig, in taste the ham is mild, salty, smoky and often breaded, and in appearance a delicate pink. When served hot, it is traditionally accompanied by Madeira sauce. Disaster struck in the mid-2000s, when the last curer in town went out of business, and for 10 years there was no ham produced in York. Appleton's Butchers had a shop on Lendal from 2016, marking the return of York-cured hams, but closed down in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, traditional York ham is no longer regularly produced in the city, though specialist butchers around Yorkshire do cure large white hams to a similar or identical recipe.
While other northern towns busied themselves manufacturing useful but boring things like steel and cotton, 19th-century York took a sweeter path. Rowntree's created Aero bars, Fruit Pastilles, Kit-Kat, Smarties and Yorkie bars, among other internationally-known sweets. Although bought out by Nestlé in the 1980s with most products rebranded, the original factory has been maintained and expanded, and the Rowntree's brand lives on with Fruit Pastilles and newer products brought out since the acquisition such as Rowntree's Randoms. The other large York company, Terry's (of Chocolate Orange fame) has had a less rosy time: upon acquisition by Modelez, production was moved overseas. But alongside Nestlé's investment, a number of small independent chocolatiers have appeared in York: Choc Affair, Guppy's, Monk Bar and the York Cocoa House.

Eating out[edit]
As diverse as York's restaurant scene is, there are some generalities that apply to many of the city's addresses. No matter the cuisine on offer, they have a sense of place and like working with local ingredients; even if you never eat a Yorkshire pudding, you'll be hard pressed to find a good café or restaurant not cooking food produced in the county. In addition to the aforementioned platters, many restaurants seem to be gripped by an obsession with "tasting menus": multi-course extravaganzas of small dishes, often with suggested drink pairings at a hefty premium. While this can be good for sampling variety, it's not so fun for cash- or time-poor travellers to be roped into spending hours eating and drinking expensively. On the other hand, at many places, you can get high-quality food experiences on the cheap if you plum for a weekday lunch or early evening meal, rather than waiting for dinner.

A chain which needs no introduction, but this one is worth a look for the setting - a spectacular 19th century gentlemen's club perched on the bank of the River Ouse.

Thoughtfully-crafted seasonal menu drawing from what's available locally.

Full marks, too, for the sympathetic restoration of their 17th century building and bonus points for the Roman archaeological remains in the wine cellar! Mains £19-£23; Sunday lunch two courses £27, three courses £33; tasting menu six courses £60 + £15 pp deposite. (updated Jun 2021)

Splurge[edit]
Al fresco dining is not uncommon in summer
53.9605-1.075423 Arras, The Old Coach House, Peasholme Green, YO1 7PW, ☏ +44 1904 633 737, reservations@arrasrestaurant.co.uk. Tu 6-9:30PM; W-Sa noon-2PM, 6-9:30PM. Despite the name, the French influence on Arras's set menu is not overly pronounced. Instead, focus is on unloved ingredients that most chefs stay away from: offal, Brussels sprouts, eel; this could be a recipe for disaster, but somehow it works. The dishes are refined and flavoursome, and the service knowledgeable and personable. They save the best to last, in the form of a bumper British cheese board introduced by chef himself. Lunch £22.50 for two courses, £27.50 for three courses; dinner £39.50 for two courses, £49.50 for three courses, £60 for five courses, with wine pairing £100. (updated Jun 2021)

Arrive up to 30 minutes ahead of sitting for apéritifs. Closed for half the week, limited sittings when it is open, no children or special diets allowed and a ruthless cancellation policy: "The Blind Pig" is like a parody of a stuffy and inflexible French restaurant. In this regard, the food completely subverts expectations: while based in the Gallic tradition and with an impressive cave à vin to match, it is not afraid to do its own thing and draw from diverse influences. Expect creative, bold and expressive dishes across a 4-course blind tasting menu (with the expectation that you, the diner, fill the role of pig). With room for only 20 covers, reservation is essential. Four-course lunch £75, with wine pairing £135; four-course dinner £95, with wine pairing £175. (updated Jun 2021)

W-Sa noon-1:45PM, Tu-Sa 5:30-9:30PM. Promoting fine dining without the formalities, and run by the York Food Festival's director, this is yet another place in town proving the worth of modern British gastronomy. Try the East Coast cod, or else the wild garlic gnocchi. Scrummy. Vegetarian and vegan tasting menus available. Set menu (dinner only): £42 for two courses, £50 for three courses; both include canapés and bread. Six-course tasting menu (lunch and dinner): £62, with cheese course £70. Add wine pairing for £38.

Actually, most of the main dishes - a range of posh burgers, plus a nice collection of salads, platters, meat and fish dishes - belong firmly in the mid-range bracket, but it's the steak and the shellfish - and the drinks - that will lighten your pockets. Mains £13-30. (updated Jun 2021)
53.9585-1.088928 The Rise, Station Rise, YO1 6GD (within the Grand Hotel), ☏ +44 1904 894 580, dining@thegrandyork.co.uk. Daily 12:30PM-9:30PM. Don't be fooled by the posh hotel setting, this is essentially pub food at a premium. If you're paying £22 for a burger, you'll want it to be the best damn burger you've ever eaten, but it won't be. Couple this with variable customer service, and it's hard to believe this and the Grand are run by the same people. Mains £17-34. (updated Jun 2021)
53.9605-1.087229 The Star Inn the City, Lendal Engine House, Museum Street, YO1 7DR, ☏ +44 1904 619 208, info@starinnthecity.co.uk. M-Th noon-9PM, F-Su 9:30AM-9PM. Dine on seasonal Yorkshire produce beside the Ouse within a warm velvet and tartan décor. Cook has a knack for making trad dishes look like intrepid new creations - or for overworking and needlessly 'cheffing up' old favourites, depending on your perspective. That said, the Star's sister restaurant in Helmsley has a Michelin star, so this is definitely one to watch. Mains £15-32, brunch £9-12. (updated Jun 2021)
Afternoon tea[edit]
York is known for its decadent afternoon teas: a pot of tea to a blend of your choice, served with dainty sandwiches with the crusts cut off, finger cakes and patisseries, and of course fruit scones with clotted cream and jam. Your food will arrive on a stacked metal stand, with three-tiered platters containing each course of the meal. To this can be added a glass of champagne or some other alcoholic beverage, for those who really want to indulge in luxury. If this sounds like a lot of food and drink, that's because it is; afternoon tea will typically replace lunch, and you may not feel like your dinner until much later on, if at all! The price of a full afternoon tea is fairly high; count on spending at least £20 per person, and add up to £10 more if you're having champagne too. Take into account that the venue itself is often as much a part of the experience as the tea, with Bettys, the Garden Room and the Countess of York arguably offering the most luxurious surroundings.
A less indulgent and cheaper option can be just to have a cream tea, that is jam-and-cream scones plus a pot of tea, which should cost no more than £10. Most cafés in York, though not listed here, will serve this, plus a selection of other traditional cakes.

Inside Bettys Tea Rooms
53.9601-1.084230 Bettys Tea Rooms, 6-8 St Helen's Square, YO1 8QP, ☏ +44 1904 659 142, customer.service@bettys.co.uk. Daily 9AM-9PM. World-famous for its nostalgic atmosphere and spectacular Swiss-Yorkshire patisserie-style catering. It is a 1930s-style tea room complete with palm trees, aproned waitresses and live pianist, and is best known for its afternoon teas but also serves breakfast and lunch/dinner. Vegetarian, vegan, and non-gluten menu options. As Bettys is the tea room all the tourists want to visit, be prepared to queue outside at peak times or book well in advance. Alternatively, you can try the Little Bettys at 46 Stonegate, which doesn't get as busy. Afternoon teas £25–33, breakfast £7–20, lunch/dinner £10–20.   (updated Dec 2021)
53.96-1.095631 Countess of York, Leeman Road, YO26 4XJ (within the National Railway Museum), ☏ +44 1904 686 295, countessofyork@nrm.org.uk. Tea served at noon, 2PM, 4PM. Railfans rejoice! You can get your afternoon tea fix in the NRM's opulently-restored train carriage, the Countess of York. There are a dozen blends of Harrogate tea to choose from, and a seasonal selection of sandwiches and cakes, with the highlight being traditional Yorkshire scones, vanilla cream and homemade jam. As capacity is constrained by the size of the carriage, it is recommended to book weeks in advance. Free parking token for the museum's car park. Traditional afternoon tea £26, with champagne £36. (updated Dec 2021)
53.9583-1.078532 The Cake Shop and Tea House, 24 Fossgate, YO1 9TA, ☏ +44 1904 671 199. Tu-F 10AM-4PM, Sa 10AM-5PM, Su 11AM-4PM. Afternoon tea: 12:30PM-3PM. Step into the 1940s for a slightly more economical afternoon tea that is certainly less refined than other options in the city, but is nonetheless still tasty, filling and satisfying. The advantages of going to a much smaller tea house like here is that you can be sure all the food is freshly made on-site, you don't need to make a reservation and you won't have to queue upon arrival. The place does some quirky house rules (no children under 10, no devices out at tables) and somewhat temperamental owners. Tea for two £35. (updated Jul 2020)
53.9586-1.091633 The Garden Room, The Principal York, Station Road, YO24 1AA, ☏ +44 1904 688 677, info@therefectory.co.uk. Daily noon-4PM. A grand and comfortable lounge with armchairs and sofas, and views across the lawns to the Minster. . Traditional afternoon tea £23.50, incl. champagne £30.50. (updated Jul 2020)
53.9585-1.088834 The Grand Hotel, Station Rise, YO1 6GD, ☏ +44 1904 899 521, dining@thegrandyork.co.uk. Daily noon-6PM (must be seated by 3:45PM). Take a four-course tea in the hotel's swish Rise restaurant, which offers views over the city walls. Vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free menus available. There's also a special menu for kids. Grand afternoon tea £25.50, incl. sparkling wine £30.50, incl. gin and tonic £33.50, incl. champagne £34.50, children £17. (updated Jul 2020)

Stonegate is a street of temptation for many.
Brewing and distilling[edit]
The city of York is the site of three breweries, one combined with a vineyard, and one distillery.
Beer, that is ale, has been brewed within the city walls for centuries, and the latest iteration of this tradition is York Brewery[dead link], which brews a range of three pale ales, the award-winning dark ruby ale Centurion's Ghost, and their signature golden ale Yorkshire Terrier. There is also a constantly changing selection of limited-edition creations, which adds a touch of FOMO-fuelled uniqueness to any beer-lover's visit to York. You can also visit the brewery; see the 'Do' section for details.
The new kid on the block is Brew York, which eschews tradition by selling its brews by can. They specialise in U.S.-style craft beers, with hipsterish names such as Cereal Killa (a gluten-free citrusy pale ale), Goose Willis (gooseberry fool in beer form), and Tonkoko (the "9th best stout in the world!"). Periodically, they mix things up by discontinuing their entire range and releasing a new selection; there's even an IPA which changes its hops with each batch. You can drink at their achingly trendy "tap room" (see below), or else look out for the odd brew of theirs in pubs.
Wine: Yorkshire has no fewer than six vineyards. The closest is Yorkshire Heart at Pool Lane, Nun Monkton YO26 8EL. They also have a brewery and a campsite, and offer tours.
And then there's gin. Running with the established zeitgeist of stunningly unimaginative names, the York Gin Company launched its range in March 2018. It has already become a fixture in the local drinks culture, being stocked by dozens of shops, bars and hotels in and around the city, and is now making a splash in international industry awards. The varieties available include the classic London-style dry gin which was at its peak popularity in York in the 18th century; Old Tom, imbued with the white rose of Yorkshire; and the imperial-red juniper, apple and berry-infused Roman Fruit — all nod to the city's heritage. For Yorkshire whiskey you'll have to visit Filey on the coast.
Cider is not made in York, and indeed has never been hugely popular up north, but if you like your apple tipple, then look out for Ampleforth Abbey Cider from nearby Thirsk.

Traditional pubs[edit]
York has perhaps the most pubs per square mile of any city in the country; supposedly there's one for every day of the year.

53.9567-1.08711 The Ackhorne, St Martin's Lane, YO1 6LR (Tucked down a very narrow streetlet off Micklegate, past the church), ☏ +44 7977 190 297, theackhorneyork@aol.com. M-F noon-9PM, Sa Su 11AM-9PM. Cosy locals' haunt that is too well hidden to be a major tourist trap. Think pub quiz, pork pies and Yorkshire ales and ciders. (updated Jul 2020)
53.9587-1.079192 The Blue Bell, 53 Fossgate, YO1 9TF, ☏ +44 1904 654 904, bluebellyork@gmail.com. M-Th 11AM-11PM, F Sa 11AM-midnight, Su noon-10:30PM. The smallest pub in York really is tiny, but the Edwardian interior (grade II* listed), conversational atmosphere and real ales mostly from around Yorkshire make this a firm locals' favourite. As there is nowhere to go but the bar area, children are not allowed.   (updated Mar 2021)
53.9629-1.07813 The Keystones, 4 Monkgate, YO31 7PE, ☏ +44 1904 656 202, thekeystones.york@stonegatepubs.com. Daily noon-10PM. Popular with a younger crowd for its live sports on telly at the weekends, pool table, variety of board games and free Playstation 4. Beer garden at rear. (updated Jul 2020)
53.957162-1.0830194 The Kings Arms, 3 King's Staith, YO1 9SN, ☏ +44 1904 659 435. M-Sa 11AM-11PM, Su noon-10:30PM. The king in question is Richard III, and his house is right on the river bank, meaning one of its annual traditions is becoming part of the river, a fact which is cheerfully recorded on its flood level gauge on the wall inside. Some of the bar rules ('no swearing', 'no drunkenness') are a bit suspect for a pub, and it exclusively serves beers from local brewery Samuel Smith's.   (updated Jul 2020)
53.9599-1.08495 Lendal Cellars, 26 Lendal, YO1 8AA, ☏ +44 1904 623 121, 7760@greeneking.co.uk. Su-Th noon-10PM, F Sa 11AM-10PM. A standard Greene King chain pub in all ways but one: the building. To access, the visitor must leave the street via a passageway, then descend into this arch-ceilinged underground bar, which was the Lord Mayor's personal wine cellar in the 18th century. An atmospheric venue for drinks, but avoid the food. (updated Jul 2020)
53.95927-1.088026 The Maltings, Tanner's Moat, YO1 1HU, ☏ +44 1904 655 387, info@maltings.co.uk. Daily 11AM-11PM. Absolutely cracking real-ale free house. The resident beer is Yorkshire's famous Black Sheep bitter, and there is a constant rotation of six other guest beers and four traditional ciders. (updated Jul 2020)
53.9559-1.09057 The Micklegate, 127 Micklegate, YO1 6LB, ☏ +44 1904 541 656. Su-Th 10AM-11PM, F Sa 10AM-midnight. Good for a noisy couple of hours. If there's no live football with eager fans staring at the multitude of screens, then the music will be playing loud. (updated Jul 2020)
53.96311-1.088278 The Minster Inn, 24 Marygate, YO30 7BH, ☏ +44 1904 849 240, minsterinnyork@gmail.com. W Th 4PM-10PM, F 3PM-10:30PM, Sa noon-10:30PM, Su noon-8PM. Not actually by the Minster and off the beaten track, most of the inn's clientele are regulars. Full of local charm, serving a wide range of traditional ales and, as a bonus from 4PM, pizzas stone-baked to order.   (updated Jul 2020)
53.95635-1.090079 The Priory, 103 Micklegate, YO1 6LB, ☏ +44 1904 653 231. M-Th 3PM-midnight, F Sa 11AM-1AM Su 11AM-midnight. Part of the Wear Inns chain, this pub has a pool table, jukebox and live sport on the telly. There is better beer to be had in York, and frankly better places to drink it, but the late-night opening makes The Priory stand out from the crowd. (updated Jul 2020)
53.9599-1.081910 The Roman Bath, 9 St. Sampson's Square, YO1 8RN, ☏ +44 1904 620 455. Daily 11AM-11PM. Shabby John Smiths pub with a wide selection of lagers and frequent open-mic nights. As the name hints at, the building is on top of the remains of a real Roman bath that you can visit for a fee (York Pass accepted).   (updated Jul 2020)
53.96221-1.084311 The Three Legged Mare (The Wonky Donkey), 15 High Petergate, YO1 7EN, ☏ +44 1904 638 246, enquiries@york-brewery.co.uk. W–Sa noon–midnight, Su noon–10:30PM, M–Tu noon–11PM. Black Sheep Brewery pub which serves their ales and bar snacks, it has quite an active social week, with a Monday quiz, Thursday open mic night, Friday live folk music and various live music acts on Saturday nights. Dogs welcome. (updated Dec 2021).
The Shambles by dusk
Bars[edit]
In this section, you'll find a selection of the most recommended bars in town, with a bit of everything from brewery tap rooms to cocktail bars, and places to nab a Viking brewski.


53.95757-1.0761912 Brew York, Enterprise Complex, Walmgate, YO1 9TT, ☏ +44 1904 848 448, info@brewyork.co.uk. Beer hall: Tu-Sa noon-11PM, Su noon-9PM.

This craft brewery's 200-seater beer hall and tap room are right alongside the brewing machinery; the beer couldn't be fresher! They also have a nice small open-air seating area in the back facing the River Foss. Burgers and Korean sides will help soak up the alcohol. (updated Jul 2020)
53.9595-1.083713 Dusk, 8 New Street, YO1 8RA, ☏ +44 1904 634 851, duskyork@gmail.com. Daily 10AM-2AM. 2-for-1 cocktails M-Th all night, F-Su until 10PM. A great place for cocktails, that describes itself as a "laid-back café bar by day, den of iniquity by night." While it does indeed get busy of an evening, especially when there's a live music act, you can usually find some space upstairs. (updated Jul 2020)
53.9611-1.08314 Evil Eye, 42 Stonegate, YO1 8AS, ☏ +44 1904 640 002, info@evileyelounge.com. W Th 4PM-midnight, F 4PM-1AM, Sa noon-1AM, Su noon-midnight. Colourful cocktail bar tucked behind a gin shop owned by the same people. You may have to queue to enter, as the place is very small. (updated Jul 2020)


53.9612-1.082915 House of the Trembling Madness (Stonegate), 48 Stonegate, YO1 8AS, ☏ +44 1904 640 009, info@tremblingmadness.co.uk. Daily 10AM-midnight. Email via online contact form. If the name doesn't put you off, then presumably neither will the taxidermied lion's head hanging over the bar, or the wax-encrusted candlesticks on the tables. Work your way through their encyclopedic collection of Belgian beers, and then soak up the booze with some maddeningly superior barsnacks. The same company has a much larger venue on Lendal. (updated Apr 2021)
53.9573-1.085316 Jalou, 2 Micklegate, YO1 6JG, ☏ +44 1904 466 502. Su-W 4PM-1AM, Th-Sa noon-2AM. Email via online contact form. Geordie glam meets medieval York: lavish and pricey cocktails served to an RnB soundtrack in a grade II-listed Gothic church with an impressive 'neon chandelier' centrepiece. (updated Jul 2020)
53.9602-1.081717 The Biltmore, 29 Swinegate, YO1 8AZ, ☏ +44 1904 610 075, biltmore@biltmoreandoscars.co.uk. Tu-Th 5PM-midnight, Fr 3PM-at least midnight, Sa Su noon-at least midnight. Housed in a converted historic church, this New York-inspired swish champagne and cocktail bar is relaxed in the week and buzzing at the weekend with the house DJ's music. (updated Jul 2020)
53.95842-1.0926518 The York Tap, York Station, Station Road, YO24 1AB, ☏ +44 1904 659 009, enquiries@yorktap.com. M-Th 10AM-11PM, F Sa 10AM-11:40PM, Su 11AM-11PM. Housed in a smartly converted Edwardian tea room, this is the place for a decent (if not cheap) pint while waiting for a train. True to its former life, you can still get hot drinks, pies, and homemade cakes here too. (updated Aug 2019)
53.9619-1.079619 Vahe Bar, 31-33 Goodramgate, YO1 7LS, ☏ +44 1904 628 344. W Th 5PM-11PM, F 10:30AM-midnight, Sa 12:30PM-midnight. Lovely relaxed bar overlooking York Minster serving British ales and Belgian draughts, plus over 200 bottled continental beers and 300 spirits. (updated Mar 2021)
53.9598-1.080720 Valhalla, 4 Patrick Pool, YO1 8BB, ☏ +44 1904 653 999. Su-Th noon-11:30PM, F-Sa 11:30AM-12:30AM. Anyone versed in Norse mythology will love this bar, which offers proof if it were needed that the Viking spirit is alive and well in York. A place for loudly drinking mead, cider and ale from a big horn, and feasting from platters stuffed to bursting with quality Yorkshire and Scandi produce. (updated Jul 2020)
York's nightclubs be like.
Nightclubs[edit]
The weak link in York's nightlife offering. If you're legally or mentally 18, you'll probably love the singularly awful half-dozen offerings which are aimed squarely at the city's population of students (and underage teens), but if you want any kind of sophistication or musical variety, then you should heed the call of Leeds.

53.9582-1.087321 Club Salvation (Salvo), 3 George Hudson Street, YO1 6JL, ☏ +44 1904 635 144, davesear@clubsalvation.co.uk. University term time: W F 10:30PM-4AM, Sa 11PM-4AM. University holidays: Sa 11PM-4AM. Essentially for boozed-up undergrad students, Salvo has cheap drinks, chart music and absolutely no class. The bouncers have a bad attitude, but a strict policy against drugs. Free entry before 10PM, then £5 (combo ticket with Society). (updated Aug 2019)
53.9568-1.081822 Kuda Bar and Club, 12 Clifford Street, YO1 9RD, ☏ +44 1904 647 947, york@kudaclub.com. M-W, F 11PM-3:30AM, Sa 9PM-3:30AM.

Describing itself as "cheese with style", Popworld is deeply proud of how uncool it is. This chain club is smaller than most of its sister venues, but has a revolving dancefloor on which you can bust out your worst moves to music as sugary as the floor's sticky coating. Entry generally free, some events £3. (updated Jul 2020)
53.9573-1.082124 The Stone Roses, 4 King Street, YO1 9SP, ☏ +44 1904 670 696, stonerosesstaff@gmail.com. M-F noon-1AM, Sa Su 11AM-1AM.

Sleep[edit]
Navigate to: Budget, Mid-range, and Splurge options, places for camping
York has everything from humble hostels and cosy guesthouses, to some of England's grandest historic hotels. The usual chains are present in abundance, but there are also plenty of unique independents worth seeking out. Most accommodation listings here are in the heart of the city, within easy walking distance from attractions and services, but some are situated in quieter residential neighbourhoods or just on the fringes, though nowhere is very far apart in compact York. And while most people don't associate city breaks with camping opportunities, there are a surprising number of places to pitch a tent or park a campervan both in town and a little way outside.



This guide uses the following price ranges for a standard double room:


Budget
Under £60


Mid-range
£60-£120


Splurge
Over £120

Where are the budget chains?
If you're looking for the likes of Premier Inn, Travelodge or Ibis in travel hotspot York, you'll either have to spend a bit more, or compromise on location. The city centre hotels of these usually budget-friendly chains charge premium room rates and are therefore listed in the 'Mid-range' section below. Alternatively, there are cheaper motel options for the former two brands on the A64, around 10 mi (16 km) west of the city; see Tadcaster for details.

Stay safe[edit]
York is a safe city with no significant crime problem. It is consistently ranked one of the best places to live in the whole UK, and high safety levels help to influence this. Unlike certain other European cities popular with tourists, visitors to York are not a particular target for scams and crimes. Terrorism is locally unheard of, though the nationwide threat level remains high. There are, however, some precautions worth taking.

Nightlife[edit]
Take care on weekend evenings in York. Plenty of local youngsters overestimate their capacity for alcohol and the city centre can seem to be awash with lager louts, mainly in the Micklegate area. If you are approached just keep on walking and they will find another victim to pester. Aim for Wikivoyage's recommended pubs, though, and you'll find that safe socialising in the company of affable locals is still possible!
Try to avoid secluded cycle paths and ginnels (alleyways) at night as it is not unknown for robberies to take place in these parts, however this tends to be away from the main city centre.

River safety[edit]
Be careful near and on the River Ouse, as it is deep and cold, and the current is surprisingly strong. If you have been drinking, avoid going near the river altogether, especially at night. The bankside paths can be slippery and poorly lit, and if you do fall in, there may well be no-one around to help you out. Several people drown in the Ouse every year, and alcohol and darkness play a role in the majority of deaths.

All of a sudden, that riverside B&B seems less attractive...
Flooding[edit]
In spite of elaborate defences, York floods pretty much every winter. All it takes is a few days of sustained rainfall somewhere upstream, and the houses and businesses nearest to the Ouse are submerged. There's about 30 mi (48 km) of Pennine moors, from Harrogate to Richmond, where the pouring rain has only one way out. If it keeps raining, then 48 hours later the river at York is brimming; another day of rain and riverside properties start to become inundated.
Aside from providing the press with a dependable annual news story, the only upside to York's frequent inundations is that locals know what to do. If you're caught in a flood, follow their lead. You can also access the city council's flood advice portal. While water damage to property is often serious, flood-related injuries and deaths are extremely rare. Follow the authorities' advice, and you'll be fine.

Stay healthy[edit]
53.9705-1.08354 York Hospital, Wigginton Road, YO31 8HE, ☏ +44 1904 631 313,  999,  112 (emergency). 24 hours. Visiting times 1PM-8PM. NHS hospital with accident and emergency facilities   (updated Sep 2019)

Cope[edit]
Worship[edit]
Timber-framed shops on the Shambles
York has dozens of Christian churches, including of the Anglican, Catholic, Baptist, Methodist, Quaker, Presbyterian, Russian Orthodox, and Latter Day Saints denominations. Muslims can worship at the city's first and only mosque on Bull Lane (YO10 3EN). The Buddhist Centre is at 17 Walmgate. The Quaker meeting house on Friargate (YO1 9RL) also hosts York's Liberal Jewish community. Adherents of other faiths and denominations will generally find their nearest place of worship to be in Leeds.

Toilets[edit]
There are numerous public toilets around York city centre. These are open daily 9AM-7PM and nearly all charge a fee of £0.40 (July 2021); various coins are accepted but no change is given. Three handy locations include: 

53.9567-1.07941 Castle Walk WC, 31 Castle Walk, YO1 9WT (close to Clifford's Tower, Fairfax House, Jorvik, York Castle Museum)
53.9595-1.08132 Silver Street WC, 32C Parliament Street, YO1 8RS (centrally-positioned for most shopping and eating. Often if not always dirty with urine on the floor despite being staffed and charging for entry.)
53.9629-1.08523 St Leonard's Place WC, YO1 7HB (next to Bootham Bar and close to the Minster and York Art Gallery)
Free public toilets are available in the railway station, on the first platform from the ticket office, right of the York Tap.

Connect[edit]
As of March 2024, York and its approach highways have 5G from all UK carriers. Wifi is widely available in public places. 

53.9614-1.08627 York Explore Library, Library Square, Museum Street, YO1 7DS, ☏ +44 1904 552 828, york@exploreyork.org.uk. M-Th 9AM-8PM, F 10AM-6PM, Sa 9AM-5PM, Su 11AM-4PM. Ask at the enquiry desk - you'll see plenty of locals using the computers, but the staff can arrange web access for visitors too. Printing facilities are also available.   (updated Nov 2022)
Go next[edit]
York is centrally located in Yorkshire, making it a great base for days out in any direction.

Vale of York[edit]
The Minster at sunset
The Vale is a prosperous agricultural country sandwiched between the Pennines and the East Coast. Peppered with medieval monasteries, castles and stately homes, it also has a selection of attractive small towns:

Harrogate is the obvious next move from York, being an elegant Regency-era spa town 21 mi (34 km) west on the A59, or 33 min on the train, and home to the original Bettys Tea Rooms. Worth a stop on the way is Knaresborough (25 min on the train), to see the 12th century castle and visit a witch's lair.
Ripon is a village-sized city that still packs in an impressive Early English cathedral, the haunting ruins of Fountains Abbey, and a host of justice-themed museums. It's 25 mi (40 km) north-west via the A59 and A1 (M), or bus 22 takes an absurd  1 hr 20 min. On the way, why not check out the Roman villa at Aldborough?
Selby's 11th century abbey is worth the 14 mi (23 km) journey south on the A19, or 20-30 min on the train.
Tadcaster is a brewery town noted for its Sam Smiths beers 10 mi (16 km) south-west on the A64, or 25 min on buses 840, 843, or 845.
Thirsk is a small market town 23 mi (37 km) north on the A19, or 15-20 min on the train, with a museum dedicated to the vet James Herriot.
Further afield[edit]
Hull is a major East Coast seaport in the midst of long-awaited urban renaissance, having successfully reinvented itself from a synonym for dull into the UK's 2017 City of Culture. It's 41 mi (66 km) south-east via the A1079 and A63, or 1 hr 5 min by train.
Leeds is the biggest and most cosmopolitan city in Yorkshire, known for its palatial shopping arcades and fantastic for clubbing, drinking and dining. It's 25 mi (40 km) south-west on the A64, or 25 min by train.
Rural Yorkshire's apotheosis, the Dales National Park, sits west of Harrogate. Drive as far as Bolton Abbey on the A59, then up the Wharfedale road into the heart of the park: the majestic Ribblehead Viaduct, Yorkshire's Three Peaks, cheese town Hawes, and bucolic Swaledale await. Access via public transport is easiest in summer, as there are some seasonal bus routes. Journeys at other times of the year will likely take you via Leeds, but you can equally get a bus up Nidderdale from Harrogate; see Yorkshire Dales#Get in for details.
The heather expanses of the North York Moors National Park stretch north of Pickering (26 mi (42 km), best accessed by the A64, turning off near Malton). The National Trust property Nunnington Hall, English Heritage ruin Rievaulx Abbey and baroque magnificence of Castle Howard are within the park. Coastliner bus 840 runs from York through the moors.
Bridlington (via the A166), Filey (via the A64) and Scarborough (via the A64) are all Victorian seaside resorts, and all 41 mi (66 km) from York, via different routes. The scenic coast road north of Scarborough leads past little coves and windswept moors to Whitby, where you can contemplate Count Dracula, while eating possibly the best fish and chips in the world. The train from York to Scarborough takes 55 min, and you can then catch onward trains or buses to the other destinations mentioned here
