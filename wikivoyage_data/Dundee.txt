Dundee is an industrial city and port, historically part of Angus county in North East Scotland. It stands on the north bank of the Firth of Tay, which here broadens out into the North Sea, and in 2021 had a population of 148,000. Dundee's prime visitor attractions are the polar sailing ship RRS Discovery, the Verdant Works jute mill, and the V&A design museum. It's also a good base for nearby major golf tournaments, and for exploring Deeside and the Eastern Highlands.


Understand[edit]
RRS Discovery
Dundee used to be a grubby, rough industrial town famous for its three J's: jute, jam and journalism. Jute (see "Verdant" below) still marks the landscape: the mills have closed but many still stand as offices and apartments. Jam was made from fruit grown nearby. Journalism refers to the D C Thomson publishing empire, whose renown was less for their journalism than for their stable of comics and cartoon strips. These include the Sunday Post with "Oor Wullie" and "The Broons", the Dandy with "Desperate Dan" and the Beano with "Dennis the Menace". Of course that wasn't all the city had to offer: delicacies such as Dundee Cake, studded with sultanas and almonds, was probably what your Great Aunt Morag enjoyed for Sunday tea along with some Dundee Marmalade to top it off (if you're Scottish). And then there was the bridge that famously and tragically fell down. And Dundee's great cultural icon was William McGonagall (see info box), surely the world's worst poet.
But the industrial grubbiness is gradually disappearing, enabling the city to shine in its attractive natural setting. There are major visitor attractions already and more appearing. There's a student buzz from the universities, and a friendly feel to the place. It's definitely worth a day or two to visit.
Dundee has its own dialect: the vocabulary is much the same as Lowland Scots (see Scotland#Talk) but pronunciation is distinctive. "T" is often dropped in a glottal stop, but the signature sound is the short "eh" (phonetic: ɛ) replacing ay, ae, e, i, ie, uy, y and more. So a pie is a "peh"; "eh" can mean I, yes, what? or hmmm... Dundonians can conduct entire conversations by just saying "eh".

Get in[edit]
Caird Hall and Desperate Dan
By plane[edit]
Edinburgh Airport (EDI IATA) is usually the most convenient. From there, take Xplore Dundee's Edinburgh Airport Xpress Service from directly outside the terminal all the way non-stop to just across from the train station in Dundee. Alternatively, take Stagecoach Bus Jet 747 to Inverkeithing in Fife to catch the hourly train to Dundee, or to Halbeath for the hourly Stagecoach Bus X54. Otherwise take the tram or bus from the airport to Edinburgh Haymarket, or Gateway for trains or buses to Dundee.
56.4525-3.01751 Dundee Airport (DND  IATA) is 2 miles west of city centre on A85 - with light baggage you could walk it in 30 min. You can fly to Dundee from London City (LCY) or Belfast City (BHD) with Loganair year-round. You can fly from London twice daily Monday to Friday, and there is one service on a Sunday, flights take around 1 hr 45 min. The Belfast flights operate once per weekday and Sunday lunchtime with flights taking just over one hour. These air routes are flown using ATR-42 turboprop aircraft, with 48 seats.

By train[edit]
Dundee has Scotrail trains hourly or better from Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen, all taking 80 min. Three direct daytime LNER trains run from London King's Cross (6 hr) via York and Newcastle, but it's usually more convenient to change in Edinburgh. From the Midlands and Southwest, take the CrossCountry train, winding all the way from Penzance via Bristol, Birmingham, Sheffield and York.
The Caledonian Highland Sleeper to Aberdeen runs Su-F from London Euston, departing after 9PM and ejecting you onto a chilly Dundee platform at 6AM. The southbound train picks up around 11PM to reach Euston towards 8AM. You might prefer to take the Lowland Sleeper from Euston towards midnight and change to a day train in Edinburgh. Going back, you need to leave Dundee around 10PM to join the southbound sleeper at 11:30PM from Edinburgh.
56.4576-2.96942 Dundee railway station (DEE). The station is just south of city centre, close to Discovery and the ramps onto the Tay Road Bridge. The station was rebuilt in 2018 with a SleeperZ hotel on its upper floors. There's not much in the concourse and the retail units are unlet, but there's a WH Smith beyond the ticket barrier.   (updated Feb 2020)
There's also a station halt at the west edge of town at Invergowrie, which might be more convenient for Ninewells Hospital area.
Four miles east of town is the seaside town of Broughty Ferry, with an hourly train (towards Arbroath) taking 7 min.
The slow trains to Arbroath also stop at Monifieth and Carnoustie.

By car[edit]
From 30 May 2024, the city centre will be a Low Emission Zone. There will be a £60 penalty charge for driving into the city centre in a non-compliant car or van. Cars built after 2015 generally are compliant, but check online. The zone covers an area within the A991 Inner Ring Road.
From Edinburgh and the south follow M90 / A90 north, about 55 miles (90 km) or just over an hour's drive. A slow scenic route is to branch off onto A92 towards Kirkcaldy then wind along the Fife coast and through St Andrews.
From Glasgow follow M80 then M9 / A9 to Perth, and then swing east onto A90. It's 75 miles (120 km), about a 90-min drive.
From Aberdeen follow A90 south: it's 67 miles (105 km) and will take about 80 min.
A90 skirts the north of Dundee, where it's called Kingsway. The speed limit of 40/50 mph is vigilantly enforced.

By bus[edit]
Scottish Citylink buses run hourly from Glasgow Buchanan station (1 hr 40 min) and Aberdeen Union Square (1 hr 20 min), and every two hours from Edinburgh St Andrews Square (90 min): beware slower buses that meander through the small towns. Megabus competes on those city routes, and also runs direct from Manchester (6 hr). National Express coaches take 11-12 hr from London Victoria and continue to Aberdeen.
Ember Electric Bus glides quietly from Edinburgh every 90 min daytime, plus two night buses, for a single fare in 2022 of £7.50. It takes 1 hr 45 min via Haymarket, the zoo, Ingliston P&R (for trams), Edinburgh Airport, Rosyth P&R, Kinross P&R, Bridge of Earn and Perth Broxden P&R.
Ember buses also run from Glasgow Buchanan Station every two hours daytime, with two night runs, single fare £8.50. They take two hours via Cumbernauld, Stirling Castleview P&R, Dunblane and Perth Broxden P&R.  
56.463-2.9663 Dundee bus station is on Seagate. There are no left-luggage facilities, but lots of cafes & fast-food nearby.

Cycle Hub for bike rentals is by the V&A, 100 yards from the railway station.
By taxi you'll pay about £6 for a journey within the city centre and £15 to Broughty Ferry.





The world's worst poet
William McGonagall (1825-1902) was a Dundee hand-loom weaver inspired to take up poetry, which he recited publicly. His “Poetic Gems”, as he called them, were lengthy doggerel that often championed noble values, e.g. for female emancipation, and against the evils of alcohol:

"... after spending his earnings foolishly he beats his wife-
The man that promised to protect her during life-
And so the man would if there was no drink in society,
For seldom a man beats his wife in a state of sobriety....
His talent ranged over battles, shipwrecks and the Scottish countryside. In 1883 a whale swam into the River Tay and was landed:

"... So Mr John Wood has bought it for two hundred and twenty-six pound,
And has brought it to Dundee all safe and all sound;
Which measures 40 feet in length from the snout to the tail,
So I advise the people far and near to see it without fail...."
But his most celebrated works were those extolling the "Beautiful Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay! With your numerous arches and pillars in so grand array...."
And so on, and on, and on, until tragically

"... the train mov’d slowly along the Bridge of Tay,
Until it was about midway,
Then the central girders with a crash gave way,
And down went the train and passengers into the Tay!"
He published some 200 poems of similar brilliance. He was mocked, he was pelted with eggs, he endured practical jokes (most famously the hoax award of the Siamese Order of the White Elephant), he was chronically poor. A true artist: nothing and nobody could stop the flow of his poetry.

56.45679-2.968331 RRS Discovery, Riverside Drive DD1 4XA. Apr-Oct: M-Sa 10AM-6PM, Su 11AM-6PM; Nov-Mar: M-Sa 10AM-5PM, Su 11AM-5PM. Discovery, launched in 1901, is an Royal Research Ship (RRS) specifically built for Antarctic exploration. Built in Dundee, she's a wooden sailing vessel with only auxiliary steam power. Discovery was commanded by Robert Falcon Scott, and also aboard was Ernest Shackleton. They reached Antarctica in early 1902 (summer), intending to spend one winter, but the ship became icebound for the next two years. They were just about to abandon ship in Feb 1904 when the ice broke and they escaped homeward to public acclaim. Both men were to return: Shackleton in 1907-09 didn't quite reach the South Pole, but survived; Scott in 1910-12 did reach it, but behind Amundsen, and all his party perished on the trek back to the coast. The museum has an extensive display of the 1902-04 expedition, and then you go aboard the dry-docked ship, which had a later career as a polar merchant vessel. Adult £11.50, combi with Verdant Works £18.65.   (updated Feb 2020)

A 46-gun frigate launched in 1824 at Chatham Docks in England, but immediately mothballed, so she was never fitted with masts, rigging or guns. Her hull was roofed over and her only sea voyage was in 1873 when she was towed north to Dundee to act as a training hulk. This means her original Georgian timbers are in unusually good condition. Her sister ship HMS Trincomalee also survives, and can be visited in Hartlepool. Adult £7.25, child £3.50.   (updated Feb 2020)

In the 19th century you just had to have jute. Curtains and carpets and blankets, hard-wearing clothing. Satchels and roof felt, ropes of all kinds, sails for ships, tents for soldiers. The raw material is a coarse flax that grows in Bengal: it was processed here because Dundee had fast ships to import it, whale oil to make it soft and workable, flax-weaving technology, and then again the fast ships to export finished goods globally. The city's mill owners grew very rich; the mill workers didn't, nor did the Bengalis. Verdant Works, built in 1833, was one of many jute factories here. Many of them still stand, converted into offices and apartments; Verdant was turned into a museum in 1996. Volunteers demonstrate the clanking machinery. Adult £11.50, combi with Discovery £18.65.

As of Aug 2021, Dundee and its surrounds have 4G from all UK carriers, and city centre has 5G from Vodafone.

Stay safe[edit]
The local police is Police Scotland and the main office is in the town centre at the end of West Bell St beside Dundee's Sheriff Court. In the UK, '999' is the number to call the emergency services, and 101 for less urgent calls to the police.  The pan-European emergency number 112 also works.
Dundee has an extensive CCTV system, covering most of the city and the entire city centre. This is owned by Dundee City Council and run by Tayside Police and has helped reduce crime significantly.
Dundee, like any other major city, has its anti-social problems, mainly drugs. The area round the rear of the Wellgate centre (Hilltown) and Stobswell have a bad reputation and care should be exercised on The Law at night. Overall the city has a good reputation.
Dundee has a dual carriageway going through it, the Kingsway, which almost splits the city in half. Be aware of speeding cars, as in any other busy city, as accidents are common.

Go next[edit]
South across the Tay is St Andrews, an ancient university town by the sea. It's the home of the Royal and Ancient, the ruling body of golf, and is the former ecclesiastical capital of Scotland. Frequent buses take 30 min. With your own car, continue south to the charming fishing villages of East Fife, such as Anstruther, and to Falkland Palace.
A short bus or train ride brings you to  Perth  and Stirling.
Visit the nearby glens: Glenshee, Glenisla and the Tay Valley. North on A9 through Dunkeld and Blair Atholl leads to Aviemore, the Spey Valley and Inverness.
North along the coast is Aberdeen and Deeside, and eventually Inverness. So the coast route and the Tay Valley route together make a natural circuit of the east and central Highlands.
