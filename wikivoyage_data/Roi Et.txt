Understand[edit]
Roi Et is both a city and a province in the mid-northeast Thailand. Established over 200 years ago, it used to be a very large and glorious city named Saket Nakhon having 11 city gates and 11 satellite cities or subordinated communities under its rule. Modern development has replaced the ancient civilization, and it is hard to find traces of the old.
Roi Et occupies an area of about 8,300 km².
Roi Et has many impressive Buddha images and some spectacular festivals, including rocket festivals in several towns across the province in May and June.
Tall Buddha images are popular in Roi Et, including the 68-m-tall walking Buddha at Wat Buraphaphiram. You can climb a staircase to knee-high level.

History[edit]
The recorded history of Muang Roi Et began during the late Ayutthaya period, when a king of Laos and his people migrated from Champasak City to settle down in the area which is now Suwannaphum. Later, during the reign of King Taksin of Thon Buri, Roi Et was moved to its present site. Suwannaphum is still at its original location.
