Hillsboro is a city in the Portland Metropolitan Area in Oregon. It contains several districts such as hip and trendy Orenco in all of its high-density glory, along with more rural South Hillsboro, although the mayor's building program is building up this area into subdivisions as of 2022. Central Hillsboro and the downtown area contains buildings dated back to the 1950s, and a few earlier examples still exist. Northern Hillsboro around the Airport is mostly industrial with no tourist attractions other than the hotels.


Understand[edit]
This city has a traditional farming community background with visible roots of agriculture. Remnants of this rural past can still be seen in the rural areas outside the city. The Orenco district used to be completely filled with nurseries, although the remaining ones have moved outside the city.
There is also a rich Hispanic history here. Almost half of the population is Hispanic and many people speak Spanish. Schools in this area offer a Dual Language program where students in grades K-12 can take half of their courses in Spanish!
This city is home to technology giant Intel, and has production facilities for many other tech and software companies. This city also serves as a home base for trips out into the countryside, or day trips to Portland.

Get around[edit]
Map of Hillsboro (Oregon)


By car[edit]
The immediate areas around the MAX light station in downtown Hillsboro are closer together and are more walkable. Anywhere beyond you will find it quicker and preferable to drive as you would in any American suburban city. The addresses in Hillsboro do not conform to Portland's addressing system but rather have its own addressing and street numbering system based on a quadrant from 1st Ave & Main St in downtown as NE, SE, SW & NW with the house numbers increasing as you go further from 1st & Main till you reach the city limits when the house numbers become different. First Ave goes north & south and divides east from west while Main St goes east & west and divides north from south. The streets going east & west are named while the streets going north & south are numbered with others named. So a road, such as Cornell Rd or Evergreen Pkwy, in adjacent Aloha has a 'NW' designation will suddenly become 'NE' as you cross into Hillsboro with a different range of house numbers along the way. Many roads in areas more recently incorporated into Hillsboro such the areas surrounding Tanasbourne and between NW/SW 185th Ave to 219th, that were once unincorporated rural areas had a mixture of Hillsboro designations (NE & SE) and Portland designations (NW & SW) and are now dual-signed with both the new and old street names or numbers.
