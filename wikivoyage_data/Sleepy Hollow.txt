Sleepy Hollow is a village in Westchester County in the state of New York. It was one of the settings for Washington Irving's short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow".


Understand[edit]
The mill and millpond at Philipsburg Manor.
Founded as an agricultural center in Dutch New Netherland by Frederick Philipse. Philipse switched allegiance to England when the British evicted the Dutch, but his heirs were less astute in their political affiliations: 3rd generation Philipses continued allegiance to England during the American Revolution and were forced to forfeit their vast land holdings. After the war, the small hamlet around the Philipse's mill was renamed Beekmantown after a prominent patriot family. By 1874 the hamlet had grown into a village and incorporated as North Tarrytown. In 1996 residents of the village voted to change its name from North Tarrytown to Sleepy Hollow to distinguish it from the adjacent village of Tarrytown. Sleepy Hollow shares a zip code and a school system with Tarrytown, but the two villages are separate municipalities.
Washington Irving's short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" is set here and in Tarrytown. In the story, "Sleepy Hollow" is the valley of the Pocantico River, now largely occupied by Sleepy Hollow Cemetery and Rockefeller State Park Preserve.
Sleepy Hollow Chamber of Commerce provides tourist information and descriptions of seasonal events on its web site and in its storefront window: 1 Neperan Rd, Tarrytown, +1 914 631-1705.

By car[edit]
Sleepy Hollow is easily accessible from the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada via interstate highways such as the New England and New Jersey Turnpikes (I-95) and the New York State Thruway system. The I-87 portion of the Thruway connecting Albany and New York City crosses the Hudson River in adjacent Tarrytown on the Tappan Zee bridge as does I-287, which connects with I-95 to the east. The Saw Mill River Parkway, which runs along the village's eastern flank, connects with the Taconic State Parkway to the north (to Albany and the I-90 east-west portion of the Thruway system) and the Henry Hudson Parkway into New York City. Route 9 connects Sleepy Hollow to the major highways in Tarrytown.
By train[edit]
Metro-North Railroad - Hudson line. Downtown Sleepy Hollow is just about equidistant from the Tarrytown and Philipse Manor (Sleepy Hollow) stations. Express service between Tarrytown station and New York City's Grand Central Terminal is about 35 minutes, about 39 minutes to Philipse Manor station. Local rail service is available between other Metro-North commuter stations. Taxis swarm the Tarrytown station at the arrival of nearly every train, but Philipse Manor does not get the same attention. On all Metro-North trains on-board fares are subject to a stiff surcharge, so buy your tickets at the station or at the vending machines located on the southbound (to New York) platform at the Tarrytown station. Metro-North's "One-Day Getaways" discount package is available to Kykuit, the Rockefeller estate. Enterprise has a car rental office for Metro-North stations.

Get around[edit]
Map of Sleepy Hollow

If arriving by train from New York City and planning only a day trip within the central business district, you can get about on foot or by local taxi. NY Waterway tours have their own bus transportation between destinations. If you stay in local hotels or motels, a car becomes something of a necessity. Broadway (aka Route 9) is the main north to south route through the village.

Do[edit]
Patriot's Park
 Follow Ichabod Crane's route. Fans of Washington Irving's "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" can follow the route of Ichabod Crane from the center of adjacent Tarrytown north into Sleepy Hollow. But don't expect to find the "Western Woods" or anything else from the 1999 movie Sleepy Hollow. Tim Burton's production is only loosely based on Irving's story and was filmed largely in Hertfordshire, England. The original bridge is long gone, but there's a rustic bridge inside Sleepy Hollow Cemetery. 
 Sleepy Hollow Cemetery walking tours. Day and evening guided tours introduce some of the famous and infamous residents of Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, including Washington Irving, author of "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow," industrialists Andrew Carnegie and William Rockefeller, and others. 
 Old Croton Aqueduct. Go hiking or bicycling on the aqueduct's trailway. The original water supply to New York City is now a walking trail that runs from Croton-on-Hudson in the north to Yonkers in the south. Notably, the trail passes through the Lyndhurst estate in the south end of Tarrytown, and very near Washington Irving's Sunnyside. Over the 180 years since it was built, portions have disappeared from the downtown areas of several river towns, including Sleepy Hollow (part of Sleepy Hollow High School is built on top of the aqueduct, forcing a detour behind the school). 
 Hike, horseback ride, fish, or go birding. At Rockefeller State Park Preserve. Equestrians can park horse trailers at the park's main entrance (in case you wish to make your own horseback ride through Sleepy Hollow). Trail maps are available at the park visitor center on Route 117, one mile east of Route 9. There is a parking fee at the main entrance, but no fee if you enter trails from Old Sleepy Hollow Road (see online map) or the Rockwood Hall portion of the park located west of Route 9. The park includes portions of the valley of the Pocantico River, which is what Irving dubbed Sleepy Hollow in his famous tale. 
Take a guided kayak tour on the Hudson River. Hudson River Recreation, ☏ +1-888-321-HUDSON (483766). Tours depart from Kingsland Point Park, Palmer Ave. Seasonal.
