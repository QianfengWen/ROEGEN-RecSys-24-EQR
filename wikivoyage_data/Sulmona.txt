Sulmona  is a secluded and somewhat overlooked small city in Abruzzo. Surrounded by imposing mountains at about four hundred metres above sea level, it doesn't feel like it has 25,000 inhabitants. It is close to the ski resorts of Roccaraso and the beaches around Pescara. Sulmona is one of the oldest towns in Abruzzo, with many buildings from the Middle Ages or earlier. It is well known for being the native town of the poet Ovid.

Piazza Garibaldi

Get in[edit]
Sulmona is very well connected to Rome, Pescara and other cities in Abruzzo, via train, bus and autostrada.

By train[edit]
The train across the mountains from Rome (via Tivoli and Avezzano) is spectacular and slow, perfect for checking out the scenery. There are about six trains daily from Rome Tiburtina station (first at 07.51, last at 18.38) which take about 2 hours 45 minutes.
About ten Trenitalia trains run daily from Pescara Centrale station (first at 04.50, last at 21.00) which takes about an hour. [1].

By bus[edit]
The quickest way from Rome is to take the regular buses to and from Rome Tiburtina bus station which takes around two hours. There are also ARPA buses from Pescara and L'Aquila. [2]

By car[edit]
Driving from Rome takes about 1.5 hours along the Autostrada A25 (Roma–Pescara). The roads are excellent and traffic light most of the time, but be prepared for traffic getting out of Rome. The toll will cost around €9 all the way (pick up a ticket going out of Rome, hand the ticket to the booth at the Sulmona exit).
It's possible to drive from pescara in less than 1 hour.
When parking it's best to avoid the old town and park just outside. There is a good car park next to the fire station (follow signs to the 'Vigili del fuoco' from where it is a short walk up to the old town.

The aqueduct
Get around[edit]
There are local buses that go to and from the station into town, and to the surrounding towns (buy tickets in the tabacchi outside the station or in the centre). Buses don't run on Sundays.
When arriving by train is possible to walk to the centre in about 15 minutes (turn right out of the station). There is usually a taxi or two waiting for the train, if there is not then try phoning from the taxi phone outside the station. It's not unusual to be offered (or to ask for) a lift in someone's car up to town.
For private car or bus hire there is a friendly and English speaking company called Vedaviaggi that can take various sizes of groups around the area.

The Pelino museum and factory can be visited for free on Via Stazione Introdacqua 55. 
 Boutiques of Corso Ovidio. The main street is lined with fashion boutiques, from large names such as Sisley and Benetton to local brands like Carpisa and Chagall. Plenty of shoe shops. 
 Markets, Piazza Garibaldi. The weekly markets sell vegetables, meats and local produce, as well as a hit-and-miss selection of furniture and antiques. Look out for local farmers and their families with a couple of jars of honey or a few cloves of garlic for sale on an upturned crate.
