The Nemesis rollercoaster at Alton Towers
Alton Towers, the largest theme park in the United Kingdom, is in Staffordshire, England. It is generally considered by rollercoaster enthusiasts to hold its own with any such park in the world. 


Understand[edit]
Alton Towers is owned by Merlin Entertainments, who also run Madame Tussaud's, Warwick Castle, The London Eye and the London Dungeon and the Blackpool Tower amongst others.
Nemesis and Oblivion (you get the picture) are white-knuckle rides to match anything in Europe and most rides in the USA. The park is very well-themed and is built in several zones, namely Tower Street, Mutiny Bay, Katanga Canyon, Gloomy Wood, X-Sector, Forbidden Valley, Dark Forest, The World of David Walliams, Adventure Land and CBeebies Land. The ruins of this stately home are even used in a ride: Hex.
Alton Towers is well signposted from the major motorways and is easily accessible from the major cities in England. Those visitors who wish to overnight can stay at one of the park's five accommodation options – the Alton Towers Hotel, CBeebies Land Hotel, Enchanted Village Woodland Lodges and Treehouses, Stargazing Pods and the Splash Landings Hotel, which is also associated with a spectacular water park.

History[edit]
Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Alton Towers is accessible on both the M6 and M1 motorways. As it is a major tourist attraction it is very well signposted. Be prepared to drive the last few miles on narrow country lanes.

By train and bus[edit]
The public transport links to Alton Towers are infrequent Alton Towers, but good options exist seasonally from Stoke on Trent, Uttoxeter and Derby.
You will need to be at either:

The Alton Towers shuttle bus
Derby train station or Nottingham bus station to catch the X52 bus to Alton Towers. There is only one bus per day April-August so make sure you don't miss it. As of 2019 the prices of the X52 are: 

from Nottingham: (one-way/return) adult £10/15, child £6/9
from Derby: (one-way/return) adult £8/12, child £5/7
Stoke-on-Trent train station, then catch the 30 bus to the Towers.
Uttoxeter train station, then catch the 32A bus to the Towers. This bus has an average frequency of about once every two hours and is a local service, servicing all the little villages around Alton Towers. These buses have gained a reputation with the locals as being a bad service and there is little need to use them as getting to Uttoxeter requires changing or passing through at either Derby or Stoke.






Note: "Alton" is also the name of a market town in Hampshire. Be very careful not to travel to Alton in Hampshire as it is 185 miles from Alton Towers Resort. The journey time by train and bus from Alton station in Hampshire to Alton Towers Resort is approximately 4 hours and 46 minutes, so if you mistakenly travel to Hampshire, you will have to change or cancel your plans.





Get around[edit]
52°59′12″N 1°53′9″WMap of Alton Towers
You can get a free park map from staff at the entrances or at various information points scattered throughout the park. Alternatively, a PDF copy can be found on the official website.

By foot[edit]
The best way to get around the park is on foot. The park however is quite large and very hilly so be prepared to walk long distances between rides.

By monorail[edit]
There is also a monorail between the hotels and car park and the park entrance. This is quicker than the 10-minute walk between the two but can have large queues during peak times.

By cable car[edit]
Also, you can use the cable car (Skyride) to get between the Park Entrance, Forbidden Valley which is an alien-themed area and Fountain Square, for The Towers, The World of David Walliams (one of the two children's areas of the park) and the Dark Forest. It is advisable to use the Skyride when traversing the valley between Forbidden Valley and Fountain Square as it is a very long and steep route through the park's gardens.
