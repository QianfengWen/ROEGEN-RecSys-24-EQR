38.555556-76.5997993 Stoney's Seafood House, 896 Costley Way, ☏ +1 410-586-1888. Maryland is known for blue crabs, and the Washington Post voted Stoney's as having the best crab cakes in the state (and, by extension, the universe). There are three locations: on Broomes Island, in the Fox Run Shopping Center in Prince Frederick, and on the Solomons Island Pier, but the Broomes Island location is the oldest and the one with the best ambiance, as it sits directly on the water of the Patuxent River. Crab cakes come in two sizes, small and regular. The small is the size of a baseball and ordered as a sandwich is an ample meal for one. Order the regular and they'll have to carry you out. Stoney's also has great tomato-based seafood chowder, fried rockfish (another Maryland classic), mussels, and potato salad. Be warned that the Broomes Island location is closed during the winter months, so call ahead to make sure they're open. The other locations are open year-round. $15-30.
