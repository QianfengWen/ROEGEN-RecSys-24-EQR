Venlo is a city in the Southern Netherlands, right on the German border. It's a  centre for industries and trade but also the go-to place for shopping and services for people from the wide region, including the neighbouring German Ruhr area. Although the town centre sustained a lot of damage in World War II, there's still a lot of monumental buildings to see. The city has invested heavily in re-vamping the town centre, creating new shopping boulevards and improving infrastructure, which was done in part because of the 2012 national Floriade flower show, which was hosted here.


Understand[edit]
Venlo is one of the most popular small town destinations in the Netherlands due to being right across the border from heavily populated German areas.

See[edit]
The town hall
Much of the historic centre of Venlo was destroyed in World War II, and several remaining houses were replaced by new projects in the years that followed. Some of the oldest houses are not recognizable as such, as modern façades have been placed in front of them. Nonetheless, there's plenty of history still around, especially in the city centre.

51.3704036.1690111 Stadhuis (Town hall). Built at the end of the 16th century, this renaissance-style building remained remarkably undamaged in the war. It determines the look of the central market square and was intensively restored in 2009. The lower floor used to be a market place and the building also served as the city weigh house. The medallions on the façade represent famous Venlo people from the time. Research proved however that the image of Hubert Goltzius, a famous engraver and printer, is in fact one of his cousin. Another one, representing painter Jan van Cleef, must be a fantasy image as no pictures of the man exist, also not at the time the medallions were made. 
51.3688956.166472 Romerhuis, Wijngaardstraat 2. Historic house, built around 1491 and well preserved. Its design is late Gothic art style.

 Stad Frankfort. One of the most interesting buildings today is a house with medieval roots and an early 19th-century front. It's considered the oldest house in the city. (updated Aug 2018)

Several hiking routes are available for the area around Venlo. Distances and kinds of terrain vary.

[1][dead link]. At the east side of town, there are several interesting natural areas.

Buy[edit]
The Venlo area is known as a shopping destination for people from the wider region, including Germany. The Maasboulevard, as the renovated shopping area is called, was fully redone just a few years ago. The Vleesstraat has most of the major chain stores, and at the end of it you'll find the so-called "German quarter", with many German oriented shops. Along the Parade, de Jodenstraat and Gasthuisstraat you'll find more boutiques and small speciality shops.
The region is known for its asparagus production, and in spring, when they are in season, you'll find them in abundance both on restaurant menus and for sale along the provincial streets in the agricultural areas.

The Kwartelenmarkt and Grote Markt area are good places to look for restaurants, especially in summer when they set up outdoor terraces on the squares.

Drink[edit]
There's aren't really any major clubs, but you'll find plenty of cafés. Some of them have a special "club night", when the music is turned up and the tables removed as people come in to dance. For serious clubbing, German cities in the region have some good options, and university city Eindhoven is a good alternative.

Sleep[edit]
 Stationshotel Venlo, Keulsepoort 16. This friendly, family-run hotel may not be the most modern option, but the basic rooms are clean and it's one of the cheapest options in town. There's no elevator, so count on taking the stairs. As the name suggests, it's at the train station and close to restaurants and the Limburgs Museum. singles/doubles €46/65. 
 Bilderberg Hotel De Bovenste Molen, Bovenste Molenweg 12. Outside of town in a forest area, the supposedly modern interior and some of the wellness facilities could use a revamp, but it's a pleasant place with good service, especially if you want to go for a walk or bike trip. Breakfast is nice but dinner is a bit overpriced. From €80. 
 Hotel Puur, Parade 7a. Very central in town, which is an asset in term of sightseeing, but take into account that it can be noisy at night, as there's a bar adjoining the hotel. Rooms are not too spacious but adequate. 
 Hotel American, Keulsepoort 14. A fairly basic place but in a nice city centre spot and, in terms of price, one of the cheaper options. €70.
