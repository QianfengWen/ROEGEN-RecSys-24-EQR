Hip and urban, Iowa City is a prominent college town primarily known as the home of the University of Iowa. Along with its adjacent suburb of Coralville, just to the west. Iowa City sits at the center of a metro area home to 171,000 people (2020) in the I-380 Corridor region of Eastern Iowa.


Understand[edit]
Old Capitol Building
Iowa City was the first capital of the State of Iowa, established in 1839 by the then-Territory of Iowa, which at the time was rapidly expanding westward from the Mississippi River. Within 20 years the capital was again moved westward, this time to the more centralized location of Des Moines, where it remains. But before the capital left, the University of Iowa was established and thus was the town's future course set.
Today Iowa City is widely recognized as one of the most educated cities in the United States, with day-to-day life revolving around the University of Iowa, which is frequently regarded as one of the best public universities in the nation. The university has a major effect on the culture and economy of Iowa City, with an enrollment of over 30,000 students. Many of the town's jobs are associated with the university and its teaching hospital, with other large employers including educational service companies ACT and Pearson.
Iowa City is also noted for the university's Writer's Workshop, a celebrated creative writing program that has produced many a noted author. The Writer's Workshop established a strong literary community in the area, which is reflected in the town's literary festivals and the famed Prairie Lights bookstore. All of this led to Iowa City being named the third UNESCO City of Literature, so far the only such city in North America.

Iowa City gets more than its fair share of severe weather. It was hit by the 2006 tornadoes and by the 2008 floods, which resulted in the temporary closure of most of the major bridges in the city.

Get in[edit]
41°39′47″N 91°32′49″WMap of Iowa City
By car[edit]
Iowa City can be reached by I-80 from Chicago to the east and Des Moines to the west. I-380 brings in traffic from Cedar Rapids and Waterloo to the north. Especially in the fall and winter, expect traffic delays from university games as there are very few main roads or entrances/exits to I-80.

By plane[edit]
The nearest commercial airport, the Eastern Iowa Airport (CID IATA), is in Cedar Rapids, about 20 miles to the north on I-380. A taxi to Iowa City may cost $40; a shuttle $25. Sometimes lower-cost flights are available into Moline (MLI IATA) or Des Moines (DSM IATA).

41.6392-91.54651 Iowa City Municipal Airport (IOW IATA). General aviation airport.  No scheduled passenger service.   (updated Aug 2020)
By bus[edit]
Greyhound and Burlington Trailways offer bus service to a variety of cities, mostly ones along Interstate 80. They operate from the 41.656905-91.5335572 Court Street Transportation Center, located at the northeast corner of East Court Street and South Dubuque Street in Downtown Iowa City.
Get around[edit]
Walking is the easiest way to get around Downtown Iowa City; the main campus of the university is right in the middle of Downtown and is very integrated with the town. West Campus, on the other side of the river, is more sprawling and hilly and is home to the hospital campus and most of the athletic stadiums and facilities. Bicycling is also a common way of getting around town; the university's biking page has a good list of resources for bicyclers.
For greater distances, there is an extensive bus system called Iowa City Transit; fare is $1. The university's Cambus system covers most campus buildings and is free and open to the public; the most useful routes for visitors are the Red and Blue, which loop between Downtown and West Campus clockwise and counterclockwise, respectively. Coralville Transit handles bus transit between Iowa City and Coralville; fare is $1.
