This is an exceptionally well preserved meteor (impact) crater, although not the largest in the world as sometimes claimed. The crater was formed approximately 50,000 years ago by an explosion estimated to be the equivalent of 2.5 megatons of TNT, or 150 times the force of the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. The meteorite itself was estimated to be 150 feet across and weighed approximately 300,000 tons. Although most of the meteorite itself vaporized upon impact, large chunks of nickel-iron remnants have been found in the surrounding area. It is historically important, as this was the site that informed much of the early theoretical work on the nature of meteorite impacts. Apollo astronauts trained here due to its similarity to lunar topography. The site is privately owned and includes a well-done visitor center with a number of interpretive exhibits and an on-site restaurant called Blasted Bistro. There short trails to viewpoints as well as a guided tour that goes around the rim. $16 (adults), $15 (seniors), $8 (juniors 8-17); no passes accepted.

35.023458-110.6980583 Take It Easy (corner of N Kinsley Ave and E 2nd St). Winslow owes much of its fame to the Eagles' hit song of the 1970s, "Take It Easy," with lyrics that talk about "standin' on a corner in Winslow, Arizona." If you want to relive the song, the town has erected a small exhibit at Standin' on the Corner Park in the downtown area; go there and see if a girl in a flat bed Ford slows down to take a look at you.

Sleep[edit]
Interior of the historic La Posada Hotel
Lodging in Winslow can charitably be described as "functional" – geared to the thousands of travelers passing by on I-40 who need a place to sleep and nothing more. The usual motels and motor lodges (Best Western, Days Inn, Super 8, etc.) cluster near the exits, with little to choose among them. For a bit of flavor of the old town and Route 66, try the La Posada Hotel.

An architectural gem and must-stop for Route 66 tourists, rail buffs and fans of Old Hollywood. Very-high-quality gift shop, excellent bar and quality high-end restaurant in The Turquoise Room. Pets welcomed for a slight additional charge. Pretentious and prissy staff can ruin the experience. Complete disconnect from the surrounding native populace. $89-169.
