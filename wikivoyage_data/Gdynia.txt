Gdynia is a port city in northern Poland. Gdynia, together with nearby Gdańsk and Sopot are often referred as Tricity (pl: Trójmiasto). Gdynia was first mentioned in the 13th century as a fishing village. After World War I, it became Poland's main harbour and the big sea port on the Baltic Sea, which it still is.


Understand[edit]
Gdynia is one of the youngest and modern cities in Poland. In the early 1900s Gdynia was a little village, but after World War I and establishing the Free City of Danzig, the Polish Government decided to build a deep-sea port. Construction began in 1921. The city rose fast in the 1920s and 1930s, so architecture and planning reflect European trends of the day - Modernism. The city continues to grow to this day. Today, Gdynia is a modern city with a population of 244,000 (2021) and is the second major Polish port in the Baltic Sea after Gdańsk.

See[edit]
Gdynia is a relatively modern city and one will not find many historical buildings. The oldest building in Gdynia is the 13th-century St. Michael Archangel's Church in Oksywie. There is also a 17th-century neo-Gothic manor house located in the Folwarczna Street in Orłowo.
However, what most tourists look for Gdynia deals with its recent past. In the harbour there are two museum ships anchored, the ORP Błyskawica destroyer and the Dar Pomorza Tall Ship frigate. Gdynia is also famous for its numerous examples of early 20th-century architecture, especially monumentalism and early functionalism. Świętojańska street and Kościuszki square are also worth mentioning.
The surrounding hills and the coastline attract many nature lovers. Leisure pier and cliff-like coastline in Kępa Redłowska as well as the surrounding Reservation Park are also popular. A 1.5-km-long promenade leads from the marina in the city centre to the beach in Redłowo. Most of Gdynia can be seen from Kamienna Góra (54 metres asl) or a newly built observation point near Chwaszczyno.
You can also take hydrofoil or ship trip to Gdańsk Westerplatte, Hel or just see port.
Gdynia is the only city in Poland and one of the few in Europe to pride itself on such long and accessible seashore. You will easily catch great views of the sea, and also find long promenades, beautiful waterfronts, marinas, yacht clubs and great sand beaches.

Beaches[edit]
