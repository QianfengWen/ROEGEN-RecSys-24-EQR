Carrbridge is a village in  the Spey Valley  in the central Highlands of Scotland, 24 miles southeast of Inverness and six miles north of Aviemore. Its Gaelic name is Drochaid Chàrr but derives from Norse: "boggy area". The main reason to visit is to access Cairngorms National Park. It's a quiet place in the wooded valley with a population of roughly 700.
Boat of Garten (Coit a' Ghartain) five miles southeast is a village of similar size, historically a ferry crossing of the River Spey until replaced by a bridge in 1899. It nowadays hosts the Strathspey Railway stock, and has a nature reserve where ospreys nest.

Carrbridge is on the railway from Edinburgh and Glasgow, with trains every 2-3 hours. They take 3 hr 15 min via Stirling,  Perth, Dunkeld & Birnam, Pitlochry, Kingussie and Aviemore, and continue north to Inverness. Not all trains to Inverness stop in Carrbridge. Change at Inverness for Aberdeen, Thurso (for Orkney), and Kyle of Lochalsh (for Skye). 
Nightly F-Su the Caledonian Sleeper leaves London Euston around 9PM to reach Carrbridge by 8AM, continuing to Inverness; return timings are similar.
See below for the heritage Strathspey Railway: this starts from Aviemore, but its main collection of locomotives and rolling stock is at Boat of Garten.
57.2795-3.82821 Carrbridge railway station is half a mile west of village centre. It has a staffed ticket office but no machines, and a waiting room but no cafe or toilets. There is level access to Platform 2 but a footbridge with stairs and no lift to Platform 1. 
Carrbridge is on a lengthy bypassed loop of the A9 from Perth to Inverness, with no direct access. From the south you join this loop (badged A95) at Granish north of Aviemore, then B9135. Coming from the north exit onto A938. Inter-city buses flash past on A9 and don't stop at the village. Local buses you might use, run by Stagecoach Highland, are:

Bus X37 from Inverness via Tomatin to Carrbridge, continuing to Dulnain Bridge, Grantown-on-Spey, Nethy Bridge and Boat of Garten; five buses M-F and three on Saturday.
Bus 39 from Dalwhinnie and Newtonmore to Kingussie, Aviemore and Carrbridge, every two hours M-Sa.
Bus 37 from Aviemore via Boat of Garten and Nethy Bridge to Grantown-on-Spey, every two hours M-Sa with four on Sunday.
Cyclists may use A9 throughout but will prefer to use the loops of its former course wherever possible.

57.2838-3.81561 Old Packhorse Bridge over River Dulnain is the oldest surviving bridge in the Highlands. It was built in 1717 to enable funeral processions to reach Duthil Church, hence it was also known as "coffin bridge". Only the basic arch remains, as the parapet and surface were lost in 1829 to the "Muckle Spate" flood, so don't try to scramble across with or without packhorse or coffin.
Carrbridge Parish Church south along Main Street was built in 1909, and holds memorials and other items relocated from the former church at Duthill. It remains active as a Church of Scotland.

Trains continue northeast to Broomhill, a small station where you can also start, then hiss to a halt a quarter-mile further when the line ends inconsequentially in the fields.
