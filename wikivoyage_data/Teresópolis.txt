Teresópolis is a city in Rio de Janeiro (state), at 900 meters above sea level. It is one of the most charming cities in the region, with relatively cold weather and beautiful mountains. Less rich than her cousin Petrópolis, Teresópolis is the ideal point of departure for the magnificent Serra dos Orgãos National Park.


Understand[edit]
God's finger peak in Teresopolis
Some miles from Petrópolis, Teresópolis is named after Dom Pedro II's wife, Empress Teresa Cristina, and also delights in the same agreeable mountain climate. In the distance are the bay of Guanabara and the spectacular surroundings of this town.
In this seldom-visited region the history of the emperors has nevertheless left its indelible sacred mark.
In 2020, the city was home to 184,000 people.
