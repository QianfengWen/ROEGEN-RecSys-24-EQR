Mount Buller village during the snow season
Mount Buller, often called Buller by locals, is an alpine village and ski resort around 250 km northeast of Melbourne. In winter, the mountain contained 263 ha of terrain for skiers and snowboarders, satisfying a wide range of skiers, from total beginners to ultra-advanced. In summer, Mount Buller has rapidly expanded from just an 'off season' to a significant destination for hiking and mountain biking, with more to come. 


Understand[edit]
At only 3-4 hours drive from Melbourne, Mount Buller is popular with day trippers from Melbourne, but also boasts 7,000 beds on the mountain. The mountain itself rises to 1,805 m (5,922 ft) above sea level, with average snow depth during winter of 1.5 m. Extensive snowmaking takes place to ensure a longer season.
One thing to note is that skiing in Australia is extremely expensive, and Mount Buller is no exception. Expect high prices, especially for accommodation and food.

Mount Buller can be divided into two seasons, winter and summer. 
The winter season, dominated by skiing and snowboarding, lasts from the King's birthday long weekend in June through to the October school holidays, depending on seasonal conditions. The mountain is usually busiest during the June school holidays and Victorian Interschools week (21-27 August), where large numbers of families come up to Mount Buller. During these times, it can be very hard to get accommodation, and if you do, expect long lift waits. August is generally the month with best snow, with most to all of the mountain being open. In winter, Mount Buller is very cold, with temperatures regularly below 0°C, so it is important to wear appropriate clothing. Most skiers and snowboarders wear thermals, warm jackets and (most importantly) waterproof jackets and pants, especially in peak season. Even if you are only visiting for snow play or sightseeing, wearing warm clothing is important. It is possible to rent this clothing from Buller Sports (mentioned below).
Snow-wise, Mount Buller varies significantly from season to season, and despite efforts every year, it is almost impossible to predict. If you see incoming snow on the forecast, don't always rely on it, as predicted conditions can change rapidly. A large part of the resort has a sunny northern aspect, which means snow melts quicker, and Buller tends to retain less snow than the other Victorian resorts. Luckily, Mount Buller provides a snow guarantee, which provides a full refund on prepaid accommodation, lift ticket, rental, lesson packages and toboggan park entries, provided you apply before 5PM the day before your planned arrival. In the early and late portions of the season, where snow can be scarce, it applies if Bourke Street Express is not running, and in peak season, if Bourke Street Express and less than three of a variety of other lifts are not running. 
The summer season, dominated by mountain biking and hiking, lasts from early December to early April, with peak season being summer school holidays from opening to late January. However, the mountain tends to be much less busy in summer than in winter. In summer, the weather warms up to a rough average maximum of 15°C, however it is still often cool enough for multiple layers of clothing. Many places, including some of the locations mentioned in this guide, are closed in summer. 

Visitor information[edit]
Mount Buller website
Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
There is only one paved road into Mount Buller, the Mount Buller Road (C320) which starts in Mansfield, a small town 55 km away. Most of the Mount Buller Road is fairly safe and easy to drive, but the road starts getting complicated once you drive past the Sawmill Settlement as the road begins climbs up the mountain. Extreme care is needed to navigate the road up the mountain with many blind corners and natural hazards such as ice and loose rock falling onto the road. The maximum speed limit is 60 km/h in good conditions, if the weather deteriorates, the safe speed can be reduced to 40 km/h (25 mph) or less.
If you are departing from Melbourne, leave at about 8:30 to 9AM to arrive in Mansfield to arrive at around noon for lunch. Stop at the Mansfield Bakery for award-winning pies, or go to the Mansfield Coffee Merchant for a more gourmet meal, with great coffee.
To get into the resort, you must pay for resort entry and have it available to display upon entering the resort, this can be done here. Cars also have to carry wheel chains if they are visiting the resort. You will also need to book Rideshare or private transfer, this can be done here. Note that Rideshare can be busy and delayed both entering and exiting the mountain, and the options for private transfer are very expensive. All cars visiting Mt Buller must carry diamond-pattern wheel chains, these can be hired from Buller Sports in Mansfield.

By bus[edit]
As explained above, the road up to Mount Buller is difficult to drive, so taking a bus can be preferable if you are not confident with driving the road, or do not drive at all. 
For a direct route with a full days' skiing, Altitude Tours runs a bus at 5:30AM from the Old Melbourne Gaol to Mount Buller, with a return bus leaving at 4PM. This bus stops off at Box Hill and Glen Waverley, in Melbourne, and at Alzburg Resort, for ski and equipment hire, along the route. It is also possible to get a full day tour from Melbourne, of which there are many options, such as Mt Buller Tours and Adventure Snow Tours.  
During winter, there is also a V/Line "snow coach" service that runs from Southern Cross to Mount Buller, which must be reserved, as tickets sell out quickly - information on prices and where to book is usually published before the start of the winter season. This consists of a V/line coach to Mansfield, a coach from Mansfield to Mount Buller provided by Mansfield Mt Buller Bus Lines, and the Rideshare service to accommodation.

By air[edit]
There are some companies that offer helicopter trips to Mount Buller from Melbourne, such as Microflite and Mile High[dead link], however these are expensive and are often cancelled or delayed due to wind or visibility issues. 
If you are travelling interstate or internationally and wishing to fly, Melbourne Airport will be your best option, as it is the largest airport in Victoria, and closest major airport to Mount Buller. From here, it is easiest to use another of the options listed to get to Mount Buller.

Get around[edit]
Village Square at Mount Buller, facing the Bourke Street Express lift
To get around the Mount Buller village, there are free village bus services available for you to catch to allow you to reach the slopes from different points such as Chamois, Village Plaza, Ski School and Bourke Street. The buses are equipped with special clamps to secure your skies or snowboards on to remove the hassle of bringing your snow gear inside the bus and upsetting other users. There are three routes, all starting and ending at the -37.14621146.450531 Village Centre; to the top of Summit Road, along The Avenue and around Stirling Road and the south side of the village.

Skiing and snowboarding[edit]




Ski lessons at Mount Buller
It's important for skiers and snowboarders of all levels to get lessons to learn and develop new skills. Thankfully, Mount Buller has a fantastic Ski and Snowboard School, with options for all ages and levels. For kids, the Bunyips (3-6 years old) and Buller Kids (7-14 years old) programs, are best suited, with a variety of ability levels and small groups. These come in either morning, afternoon, or all-day lessons. For people aged 15 and above, group lessons are available for 1st time, beginner and intermediate skiers. 1st time lessons run for 2 hours starting at 9AM, 11AM and 1:30PM, and beginner and intermediate lessons run for 2 hours starting at 10AM and 1:30PM. For advanced skiers and snowboarders above the age of 15, private lessons are the best choice, which run throughout the day, and are also suitable for people wanting one-on-one lessons or families of a similar skill level.
All of these options are available for booking through the website, however there are limited spots, so it is important to book early. In the early 2020s, Mount Buller has had a shortage of international ski instructors, so advanced lessons have occasionally been cancelled. All ski lessons start from Helicopter Flat, in front of the Ski School building and next to the Abom Express lift queue, except for Bunyips, which meet inside the Ski School building. Snowboard lessons meet across Bourke Street from Helicopter Flat.


Skiing and snowboarding is a very common activity on Mount Buller, and many people come exclusively to do so. Mount Buller has an extensive network, comprising of 88 trails served by 20 lifts. Lift tickets can be bought on Mount Buller's website, with prices changing throughout the season. When skiing or snowboarding, remember to abide by the Alpine Responsibility Code. The one thing to remember, even if you are an advanced skier, is to know your limits and to not push them. Pushing your limits can often lead to accidents, which could leave you seriously injured and out of pocket. 

Beginner (Green Circle): The beginner runs on Mount Buller are Bourke Street, Baldy and Burnt Hut. The slopes on these runs are gentle and easy to slide down on. Burnt Hut is slightly steeper, but the scenery is a lot nicer than Bourke Street, with trees on both sides. Bourke Street is ideal for beginners who wish to stay near their accommodation, since it is right in the middle of the Mount Buller Village, and a newly-built six-pack chairlift, Bourke Street Express, is very fast despite the previously-long lines. Baldy ends at the top of Bourke Street, and is quite flat, making it harder than Bourke Street. All of the beginner runs are available from the Abom chairlift.
Intermediate (Blue Square): Two very popular intermediate runs are the twin runs of Wombat and Little Buller Spur, located near the top of Baldy. Groomed most days and covered by snowmaking, the runs are suitable for many intermediates wishing to move up from green to blue. However, the runs get a bit busy on Sundays and school holidays, and the chairlift serving them, Wombat, is very old and slow. Another easy run is Skyline, accessible from Baldy, however it is served by a T-bar, which can be difficult for skiers and especially snowboarders who have not used them before. Family Run is very easy, too, and used to be marked as beginner. It does have a small uphill part, which can be annoying to get up. A slightly more difficult run is Standard, located at the end of Skyline. It can, at some times, get somewhat choppy or icy in some parts. Other runs similar to Standard are Shakey Knees, Tirol, Summit Blue and Chamois. The most difficult blue run is Summit Slide, which is considered 'double blue' by some skiers and snowboarders. It is covered by moguls, or bumps, and is somewhat steep. It is usually used as an introduction to moguls before moving onto other runs with steeper, larger moguls.
Advanced (Black Diamond): Mount Buller has a large variety of advanced runs, from easy black runs to very steep terrain. The easiest black run on the mountain is the chain of Summit Black and Howqua, followed by Dam Run and Yurredla. These are all not as steep as most advanced runs, and tend to get good snow cover. Summit Black and Howqua have snowmaking, furthering snow cover. A good run in the middle difficulty of advanced runs is Men's Downhill, which has snowmaking and is very popular on a good day. Chalet Creek is a similar steepness but more technical, as it doesn't have as good snow cover. The runs on the Bull Run bowl, encircled by Standard, is also in the middle range, although the upper runs such as Hogg's Back and Sun Valley are more difficult. The most prominent run in the Bull Run bowl is Fall Line, which offers the most difficult moguls on the mountain and is very popular with mogul skiers on a good day. The most difficult advanced runs on the mountain are the runs on the Summit, including the Fanny's Finish and Summit Ridge areas. These are very steep and can get very icy at times.
Extreme (Double Black Diamond): Mount Buller has both on and off-piste terrain. As of 2023, Mt Buller has declared two runs as double black runs: Plug Hole, accessible from the Bull Run chair, and Fanny's Finish, accessible from the Summit chair. There are two locations where off-piste double black runs can be found. The first is off of Summit, past Fanny's Finish, where the Chutes are located. There are much more well known than the double blacks located in the second location, off of the Canyon Trail, near Chamois. Only the most experienced skiers should ski in these areas, and help may be a long way off if anything happens. Skiing the Chutes will also result in a walk back up to the Howqua chairlift if you go down too far.
Tobogganing[edit]
There are two toboggan parks in Mount Buller; the -37.14555146.449114 Village Toboggan Park, right near the Village Centre and Alpine Central, and -37.14141146.45585 Celia's Toboggan Park, at the base of the mountain. Celia's can be accessed using the Northside Express chairlift, which is walkable from the Village. Since 2022, you cannot bring your own toboggan onto the mountain, instead, you must hire them or book a toboggan park ticket from the Buller website, this has been done to reduce the number of people tobogganing on the slopes or in between buildings, both possibly dangerous situations.

In Summer[edit]
Mt Buller offers a series of activities in summer, including a large mountain biking network, multiple nature walks and a large hiking network. Mt Buller also is the home of the Australian Alpine Epic, a 51km mountain bike track from the Village to the town of Mirimbah, and is one of the few IMBA Epic-accredited trails in the world.

Work[edit]
International workers on working holiday visas are fairly common at Mount Buller, with local workers often in short supply due to the remote location of the mountain. These jobs are mostly in the hospitality sector or at the ski school. A list of available positions can be found here. Most jobs also offer subsidised on-mountain accommodation as part of the remuneration, but if your position doesn't, on-mountain accommodation is very expensive, and off-mountain accommodation, often in towns near Buller like Mansfield, Merrijig and Sawmill Settlement, is still at least a 20-minute drive from the village. 
If you are a ski instructor that works at a Northern Hemisphere ski resort and can speak English, you can work as a ski instructor across most of the year, at your home mountain in the Australian summer and at Mount Buller in winter, due to Mount Buller's position in the Southern Hemisphere. It is fairly common for ski instructors, particularly those for higher levels, to be from abroad. There is also a shortage of ski instructors, so getting a position should not be difficult provided you have the proper qualifications. 

Learn[edit]
If you are interested in staying in Buller for most or all of the winter season with children, it is possible for them to receive an adequate education. Mansfield Primary School operates a campus in Mount Buller in the Alpine Central building, however this is only for students from Foundation to Grade 6 level, and only operates during the winter season. Mansfield High School operates a similar seasonal program for Grade 7 to 10 students.

Stay safe[edit]
Due to the mountainous, isolated nature of the mountain and the danger in traversing the mountain, safety can be a concern. -37.14639146.450782 Mount Buller CFA is on the junction of Stirling Road and The Avenue and the -37.1463146.45143 Mount Buller Police Station is nearby, on Chamois Close. The -37.14609146.445324 Medical Centre and the -37.14608146.445675 Ski Patrol are located on Summit Road, at the top of Athlete's Walk. Be careful on Athlete's Walk, as it is very steep and sometimes slippery, although the installation of heaters has remedied this to an extent. Downloading the Mount Buller app is a must, as Ski Patrol can be called using a quick-to-access button on the app.

Cope[edit]
