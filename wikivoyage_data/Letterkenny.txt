Letterkenny is the largest town in County Donegal, with a population of 22,500 in 2022. It's a workaday place, frankly not scenic, but with lots of accommodation and other visitor amenities. It's the county transport hub and a good base for exploring the rest of Donegal, especially the north coast.


Understand[edit]
"Polestar": just so you know where you are
Glaciers carved out deep valleys around the coast of Donegal, which flooded to become fjords during the post-glacial rise of the sea. The largest were Lough Foyle (now by Derry city) and at Lough Swilly by Letterkenny, with Inishowen peninsula between. Their deep sea channels assisted transport of people and goods in an era when overland roads were muddy tracks in fair weather and morasses at other times. The Vikings (who enjoyed sailing into fjords) are the first documented outsiders, but there were many others including the Celts / Gaels to give Donegal its name Dún na nGall, fort of the foreigners.
The Irish ousted the Vikings but from the 12th century came under attack by the Normans. Those incursions never got far in northwest Ireland, so it was only from the 16th century that the English Tudors could resume their land-grab. Stiff resistance from the chieftains of Tyrconnell (Donegal) and Tyrone was only broken in 1603 by the Nine Years' War; the chieftains fled to Europe and their land was seized for "plantation" by English and Scottish colonists, laying the seeds for the partition of Ireland. The local tracts were granted in 1611 to Patrick Crawford from Scotland: he and his successors developed a town north of the River Foyle, eclipsing the original Irish settlement on the south bank. 
In Irish Leitir means a hillside littered with stones, and Letterkenny is the stony hillside of the O'Cannon tribe. Until the 17th century it was a seaport, but vessels grew larger while the Swilly estuary silted up. The harbour at Ballyraine stayed in business into the 19th century, importing salt and grain, while Donegal's people drained out - some to North America, but a large contingent went to Glasgow. The last act of the 1798 rebellion of United Irishmen was played out here: the main uprising in County Wexford was already crushed when the French invasion forces arrived, too little too late. The French landing in County Mayo caught the government off-guard and they campaigned almost unopposed for 11 days before being encircled. The final sortie brought the rebellion's leader Theobald Wolfe Tone into Lough Swilly, but they were captured by the Royal Navy. Wolfe Tone was brought ashore at Letterkenny, carted off to Dublin for trial, sentenced to hang but committed suicide in prison.
The 1921 partition of Ireland bore especially hard upon the northwest, as towns such as Lettekenny lost their traditional links to both Dublin and Belfast. The manufacturing economy has always been small, though a service sector has grown and made the town into the largest in the county. Revival came with the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, which enshrined an open border and end to hostilities, so you can hop on a bus in Derry and come here with no border checks. As elsewhere in Ulster, the big question is the long-term effect of Brexit on this. 

54.949-7.7171 Letterkenny Tourist Information Centre, Neil T Blaney Rd, Ballyraine (at Port Bridge Roundabout as N14 enters town). Tu-Sa 9AM-1PM, 2-5PM. On the roundabout is "Polestar", a public sculpture that's supposed to commemorate the town's transport history. Mmm, maybe a boat's timbers, or the innards of a locomotive, or a tourist driver unsure of the correct roundabout exit through inability to navigate by the Pole Star? (updated Jun 2024)

"There is a town called Letterkenny which hath a market every Friday and two fairs in the year with a fair Church and a bridge at the east end over the River Swilly" - survey of 1652-56
Main Street (one way traffic south) is a mix of 19th century and modern low rise. Market Square is a little green space, with a statue commemorating its Hiring Fairs: bring any spare members of your family along and hope to hire them out for the season to local farmers. Especially your children: that's money in your pocket, fewer mouths to feed, and their education taken care of; it's just like Montessori only with cuffs to the earlugs instead of violin lessons.
Town Park is a pleasant green area north end of High Road by the hospital.
St Eunan's Cathedral (RC) on Castle St was built in the 1890s and is open daily 7AM-9PM. The Adoration Chapel adjacent within the Loretto Convent is also usually open similar hours.
