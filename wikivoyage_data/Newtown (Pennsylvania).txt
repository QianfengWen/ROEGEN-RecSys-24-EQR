You will probably need to drive here, but once you're in it is much more effective (and enjoyable) to walk around. The shopping district and center of Newtown is beautifully kept up, well lit, and easily traversed on foot.  There are plenty of places to park, including parallel parking right on State Street.  If you can't find parking there because it is usually pretty crowded, there are plenty of parking lots surrounding State Street and parking is free.
