Panorama of the bridge connecting Frankfurt to the neighbouring Polish town of Słubice
Frankfurt (Oder)  (Previously known as: Frankfurt an der Oder or sometimes Frankfurt/Oder)  is on the Oder River in Brandenburg, a state of Germany. It lies directly on the border with Poland, and is connected via bridge to its Polish sister city Slubice.  The city is occasionally mistaken to be the much larger, and more well-known Frankfurt am Main.


Get in[edit]
100 km east of Berlin and 470 km west of Warsaw.

By train[edit]
52.336814.54711 Railway station. Regional Express Trains run from Berlin once every hour and the ride is just a little over an hour to Frankfurt. There is also a EuroCity (EC) Train that runs from Berlin through Frankfurt on its way to Poland, but this is significantly more expensive than the commuter train.   
By plane[edit]
Frankfurt (Oder) doesn't have an airport. The closest ones would be those of Berlin, which are probably your best options. On the Polish side, Poznan has a limited selection of flights.

By car[edit]
Take the A 12 from Berlin

Get around[edit]
52°20′38″N 14°33′14″EMap of Frankfurt an der Oder

There is a local bus as well as a streetcar system but the town isn't all that big so it's easy to walk everywhere.

See[edit]
52.34305614.5544441 Marienkirche. famous for its medieval window picturing the Antichrist's life. The only known depiction of the story of the Anti-Christ from the Bible. It is on display in the Rathaus (town hall) but should soon be on display in the church. The director of the restoration of this church, Hans-Dieter Laube tells a fascinating story about the window pane and the history of the town in general, however he speaks only German so that could be a problem, but if you can speak the language it's worth while to stop and speak with him.

Cope[edit]
Frankfurt has potentially a lot to offer for a day visit, although you will need to speak German to take advantage. Given that the town was very deep in the former GDR there are limited numbers of English speakers available.
