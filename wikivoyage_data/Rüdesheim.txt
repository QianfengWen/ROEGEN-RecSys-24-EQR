Rüdesheim am Rhein (also spelled Rudesheim or Ruedesheim) is a city in the Rheingau in Hesse, at the southern end of the Rhine Valley, across the river from Bingen. The Rüdesheim village within the city is a small picturesque place at the Rhine, one very typical example of Rheinromantik


Understand[edit]
The town incorporates the village of Assmannshausen, also on the Rhine but on the other side of a bend in the river, and is also known as Rüdesheim am Rhein to distinguish it from the smaller nearby town of Rüdesheim an der Nahe.
Uphill (go by car or ropeway) you will find the Niederwald monument and its surroundings. The monument is one of a select group of national monuments in Germany and is a major attraction. It has a tremendous view over the Rhine, Rüdesheim and Bingen. You can combine the visit with a walk in the forest that includes an animal park and other smaller places to see.

As you enter the town from the north, a railway level crossing ensures long traffic jams, particularly on weekends when the weather is fine.

See[edit]
Adlerturm
49.9782677.920841 Drosselgasse. The heart of Rüdesheim's old town.  
49.9779257.9258552 Adlerturm (Eagle Tower). This late Gothic corner tower was built in the 15th century as part of the old city wall. It is 20.5 m high and has an inner diameter of 5 m. The walls are 1 m thick. One of the four floors contains a dungeon which is only accessible through a hole in the vault. The tower used to stand directly on the Rhine. In the last century it was home to an inn called "Zum Adler", from which the tower took its name. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe lived here when he visited Rüdesheim, admiring the magnificent view of the river. Today the Adlerturm is owned by a bank. 
 Aristocratic residences. A series of beautiful aristocratic residences dating back to a variety of cultural eras can be found on Oberstraße: Frankensteiner Hof, Ritter‘scher Hof and Bassenheimer Hof. The street is also home to what is undoubtedly the most attractive of all of Rüdesheim’s aristocratic dwellings, the Brömserhof, which was built in 1542. 
Brömserburg Castle

49.97767.91773 Brömserburg Castle (Niederburg Castle). The archbishops of Mainz owned the Brömserburg from the early 10th to the early 19th century. They transformed the original fortification into a residential castle in the 12th century. It used to be completely surrounded by water. Walls more than two meters thick, and vaulted ceilings with apexes one metre thick, resisted every attack. The Duke of Longville could destroy only the southeastern part of the castle. The clergy sold Brömserburg in 1803, and the castle passed through several hands until it was acquired by the town of Rüdesheim in 1941. Today the castle hosts the Rheingau Wine Museum, the oldest wine-related collection in the world. The castle garden contains old wine presses from different periods.
