Swedesboro is a borough in Gloucester County, New Jersey. It is a small quaint little town of a little over 2,500 people. Swedesboro was formed as a borough by an Act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 9, 1902, from portions of Woolwich Township (population over 3,000), which completely surrounds it.

Old Swede's Church (Holy Trinity) in Swedesboro. Congregation founded about 1700 as a Swedish Lutheran Church with services in Swedish, but became Anglican then Episcopal Church built in 1786

Understand[edit]
Swedesboro is on the south side of Raccoon Creek, about 5 miles from its mouth. It is an enclave within Woolwich Township, 10 miles from Woodbury, NJ and about 18 miles from Camden. Swedesboro is one of only two Swedish settlements in New Jersey, along with Bridgeport.
What is now known as the Borough of Swedesboro, was originally part of the colony named New Sweden, and was made up of Finnish and Swedish settlers (Finland was then a part of Sweden). From 1638 until 1656 the land along both shores of the Delaware River was the colony's territory, and ships continued to bring additional settlers, ruled by royal governors.
