Visitor information[edit]

While it may be puzzling why a town with few notable things to see has mid-sized visitor centre, this visitor centre acts as an entire regional visitor centre for the entire Meander Valley, specifically the Great Western Tiers Wilderness Area. There's a gift shop available on-site, with maps and books (and even books of maps!) with local information. (updated Apr 2023)
Get in[edit]
Devonport is approximately 50 km west of Launceston via the Bass Highway, which is a two-lane freeway up till Deloraine with sporadic four-lane sections. Exit at either A5 (Highland Lakes Rd) or B12 (Mole Creek Rd). From Devonport, use the Bass Highway south for about 50 km and take the B12 exit (the first exit once the road becomes a freeway). Unlike the section between Launceston and Deloraine, the section between Devonport and Deloraine is not a freeway but still has 110 km/h (68 mph) limits.
