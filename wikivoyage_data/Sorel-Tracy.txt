its great history since the passage of Jacques-Cartier in 1535; the Pierre-de-Saurel Historical Society contributes to historical research and disseminates it to the public; the main museums and educational places for visitors are the House of Governors and the Biophare;
its particular geographical location, at the confluence of the Richelieu River and the St. Lawrence River, and facing the Îles-de-Sorel, thus offering boaters a magnificent riparian and river landscape, as well as an exceptional environment for navigation boating through the islands, the channels, Lake Saint-Pierre, the St. Lawrence River and the Richelieu River; the passage of migratory birds (spring and autumn) offers quite a fluvial spectacle;
its recreational infrastructure: Parc régional des Grèves, Club de Golf Sorel-Tracy Les Dunes, Parc Nautique Regard sur le Fleuve, marinas, boat launches, bike paths, municipal parks, Carré Royal; and
its picturesque and modern built heritage, which testifies to various eras and various vocations of the city (industrial, maritime, commercial, institutional, religious, residential).

History[edit]
Jacques Cartier passed by the site of the present city in 1535, as did and Samuel de Champlain in 1608 and he led the battle of Cap de la Victoire on June 19, 1610 at Contrecoeur.
In 1642, Charles Huault de Montmagny, governor of New France, erected a fort at the confluence of the Richelieu River and the St. Lawrence River. This fort was abandoned in 1647, for lack of resources. In 1665, following the decision of King Louis XIV to take over New France after the dissolution of the Compagnie des cent associés, the sustainable exploitation of the lands of Sorel began.
The city of Sorel was built on the site of Fort Richelieu, at the mouth of the Richelieu River in the 17th century. Formerly this river was designated river of the Iroquois. This toponym evokes the life work of Cardinal de Richelieu (1585-1642), minister of Louis XIII. The toponym of the city evokes Captain Pierre de Saurel, who chose to leave the military career to settle in New France with his friends: Antoine Pécaudy de Contrecoeur, Pierre de Saint-Ours, Jacques de Chambly, Alexandre Berthier, René Gaultier de Varennes and François Jarret de Vercheres. Each of them was assigned a seigneury, in accordance with the rules of the seigneurial system in New France. The seigneury of Pierre de Saurel was granted to him in 1672.
In 1781, the first illuminated Christmas tree was presented at the Governors' House in Sorel-Tracy; this custom quickly took root in Canada.
Throughout the 18th century, shipbuilding proved to be the city's main economic vocation. Related industries begin their operation. In 1740, a first factory, a tar factory was established there. The seigniory then had 800 inhabitants.
After the Conquest of New France by the English army, the de Ramezay family sold the seigneury of Sorel to John Bondfield, an Englishman. In 1780, the British Crown acquired the seigneury of Sorel. Subsequently, the city continued to expand, except during the Great Depression which began in 1929.
