Marshall is a town and country area in Western North Carolina.


Understand[edit]
Marshall consists of a small village and a larger country area in the Appalachians. The historic part of Marshall is compact, being almost entirely on the Main Street, with the French Broad River on the southern side and hills on the northern side. The hills north of historic Marshall are not very densely populated.
However, there are more companies and services scattered along the part of U.S. Route 70 (also U.S. Route 25) that goes past the northern side of Marshall. There are also some houses on the southern side of the French Broad River.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
U.S. Routes 70 and 25 follow the same route along the northern side of Marshall, and go to many of Marshall's restaurants and services. To get from U.S. Route 70 to historic Marshall, take a left on Marshall's Main Street (U.S. Bus Route 70), which goes past a library and into historic downtown Marshall.

By train[edit]
A railroad goes past historic Marshall, but there are no train stations along the Marshall part of the railroad line.

Get around[edit]
You can easily walk around historic Marshall, but you will probably want to drive to the northern part of Marshall, which is more than a mile from the historic area.
