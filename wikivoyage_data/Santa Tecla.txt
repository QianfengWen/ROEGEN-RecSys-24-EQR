Santa Tecla is the second largest city in El Salvador. It is a suburb of San Salvador. 


Understand[edit]
Downtown Santa Tecla preserves the antique architectural style found only in towns such as Juayua or Suchitoto, with the convenience of being located in the city. While El Salvador is considered by many to be unsafe, Santa Tecla is usually patrolled by the metropolitan guards, and by the police.

Get in[edit]
Map of Santa Tecla
By car[edit]
Car is the easiest way to get in, as major roads, such as Monseñor Romero blvd. or the Panamerican highway, lead directly into the city.
Monseñor Romero blvd. exit to Santa Tecla leads to the 7a Avenida Norte, which can be driven through to get to the center of the city. The drive from downtown San Salvador can take as little as 15 minutes without traffic or as much as 40 minutes during la hora pica.  

By bus[edit]
Bus routes are available all over town, with connections to neighboring cities and towns.

Get around[edit]
Walking is the easiest way to get around once inside Santa Tecla. Places such as Paseo el Carmen, during the weekend nights, are closed off to cars for the pedestrians to take over. You can have your hotel call for a radio taxi so you don't have to hail one on the street. Uber is available as well. 
If walking through downtown Santa Tecla, common sense and precautions are needed, such as not flashing valuable objects or electronics around just to be on the safe side.

 Street vendors. On the weekends, to the west from El Carmen church, there are many street vendors that set up their stands, especially in the evenings and late in the afternoon. It's a really fun atmosphere, with tables set up on one side of the street, and the vendors with their stands sitting on the opposite side. 
 Pupuserias. For those wanting to try the authentic Salvadoran pupusas, there are a few pupuserias (pupusa shops) scattered around the place. A tasty and affordable (each pupusa is about 50 cents) one is located south from the Museum, on 7a Avenida Norte. Cheese and/or bean pupusas should be preferred over chicharron (pork) if you fear getting food poisoning. The aforementioned pupuseria has a very convenient hand sanitizer right next to the cash register.
