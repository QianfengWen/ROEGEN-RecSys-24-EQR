Middleburg is a town of 800 people (2019) in Virginia known as the capital of horse country. This quaint town features historic architecture, tree-lined streets, charming and unique shops, and a variety of dining establishments. Middleburg is also home to The Red Fox Inn, touted as the oldest original inn in the country.

Kennedy and Jackie Kennedy, Elizabeth Taylor, and Pamela Harriman. Olympic equestrian riders, Fortune 500, and heirs are included in the towns prestigious list of residents.
The Civil War features prominently in the town's history, as troops from both Union and Confederate armies camped and skirmished here on their way to Gettysburg. Confederate Colonel John S. Mosby used Middleburg as a base camp from which to raid nearby Union outposts. Self-guided driving tour brochures, audio tapes, and CDs on the Mosby Heritage Area are available for purchase at the Loudoun County Visitors Center in Leesburg.
Annual Middleburg events include the Hunt County Stable Tour held on Memorial Day weekend when more than a dozen major horse estates and equine facilities open their doors to the public, and the annual Christmas Parade on the first Saturday in December which is led by the hounds of the local hunt followed by riders on horseback in their traditional hunting attire.
