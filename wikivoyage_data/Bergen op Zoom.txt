Bergen op Zoom is a city in the west of the Dutch province of North Brabant in The Netherlands. Situated on the border of neighbouring province Zeeland, the city lies on the hills of the "Brabantse wal", an area heightened over the centuries under influence of the river Schelde and the Sea. The area is dotted with historic estates and large parts of it are natural reserves, making it a fine destination for hikers. Bergen op Zoom is known as pleasant and historic city, packed with monumental buildings, plenty of good shopping opportunities and many welcoming cafés.


Understand[edit]
This is a historical city with about 66,000 inhabitants and a strategic location close to both Rotterdam and Antwerp. Nevertheless it has the typical atmosphere of a North-Brabant city. It is said that hotel De Draak is the oldest hotel in the Netherlands.

History[edit]
The Markiezenhof
Bergen op Zoom originated in the Middle Ages from the combined growth of three small settlements. It was walled in 1330 and received city rights in 1347 . The city was the administrative center of the area. From 1533, the lords of the city from the house of Glymes were allowed to carry the title of Marquis. Their palace (Markiezenhof) is a museum now. About 1500, Bergen op Zoom was, with its port on the Oosterschelde and its fairs, a major trade competitor for Antwerp. Two differing influences caused a decline: massive floods with storm surges to the hinterland and the impact of the Eighty Years' War (1568–1648).
In 1577, during the Eighty Years' War, the Spanish who were expelled from the city, made numerous attempts to recapture it: In 1581 and 1588 (by Alessandro Farnese), in 1605 and 1622 (by Ambrogio Spinola).
The fort of Bergen op Zoom was created in 1688 by Menno van Coehoorn and was considered one of the strongest fortresses of the Low Countries. However, in 1747 it was taken by the French general Löwendahl after a three-month siege. Just one year later, due to the Aachen Peace treaty, the French had to evacuate the fort.
On 30 January 1795 Bergen op Zoom was handed over to the French without a fight. In 1814 there was an unsuccessful attempt to capture the fortress by a British force commanded by General Graham.
In 1867 the fort was abandoned and dismantled.
