San Leandro is a mid-size city of about 90,000 people (2018) in the San Francisco Bay Area in Northern California in the United States of America.


Understand[edit]
San Leandro (known locally as SL) is in Alameda County in the East Bay portion of California's Bay Area. Historically a town with dozens of huge cherry farms and a Spanish missionary ranch, San Leandro today is a rapidly growing city home to prominent business firms and is a suburb of Oakland. Founded in 1872, it is one of the oldest cities in California. San Leandro does not have as much to offer as its neighbors, however its central location may make it a very economical home base for tourists and commuters, and its panoramic views of the San Francisco Bay and its hills are worth a trip for visitors.
San Leandro has a diverse population, with Asians forming a plurality at roughly 30% of the population, Whites and Hispanics each at around 27%, African-Americans at 12%, and one of the lower 48 states' larger Pacific Islander populations forming about 1% of the city's population.

San Francisco International Airport (SFO IATA) is also accessible to San Leandro by BART and bus services and is about 25–30 minutes from San Leandro. San Jose International Airport (SJC IATA) is the least accessible to San Leandro, because it is not served by BART, so access by car, bus or an expensive taxi ride are the only options, San Jose International Airport to San Leandro is 30–40 minutes.

San Leandro is close to the Oakland Amtrak station and is accessible to San Leandro by BART or bus.

By bus[edit]
San Leandro is linked to Bay Area cities by bus services, and has local bus services, Flex Shuttle and LINKS linking parts of town to another.

By ferry[edit]

By bike[edit]

Get around[edit]
Interstates 580, 880 and 238, California State Routes 238, 185, 112 and 61, BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) 2 stations, San Leandro and Bayfair, local bus services and close access to Oakland International Airport.

Traffic[edit]
During rush hour on weekdays (8AM-9AM) and (4PM-6:30PM) traffic on all interstates can be terrible. Traffic on 580 is troublesome from Downtown on both sides and at the Bayfair Center on Eastbound 580 at 150th Avenue. 880 and 238 are clogged during these times. On weekends, 580 and 880 fare better while 238 is clogged on Sundays. Traveling on California State Routes 185 and 112 are also troublesome on Sundays.

Stay safe[edit]
Despite its suburban characteristics, San Leandro does have its tough neighborhoods at its borders with larger cities. One area to be aware of is the portion of MacArthur Boulevard near the Oakland border. This area is next to the notorious and impoverished "deep" East Oakland, which has some of the Bay Area's highest drug trafficking and murder rates. The area between the Hayward and Ashland borders (just south of the Bayfair Center)  is reasonably safe during the day, but gets sketchy after dark. Nevertheless, San Leandro is a safe city with designated crime free zones, including the area near the Castro Valley border at Lake Chabot to the end of Estudillo Avenue (where downtown begins), near the marina, and a large portion of the Washington Manor neighborhood (including the Washington Manor Park and Pool) from Interstate 880 to Farnsworth Avenue. Due to the presence of a juvenile hall, Fairmont Drive in the city's eastern hills is heavily secured between Lake Chabot Park and 152nd Avenue. Police patrols are very frequent and security cameras are hidden on trees and fences.

Stay healthy[edit]
As with almost every city in the United States, San Leandro has at least one hospital. The San Leandro Hospital is a health care facility treating the most basic of health needs such as the flu to various surgeries and basic emergencies. If in a dire emergency head to Eden Hospital in Castro Valley as it is a Level 1 trauma center. San Leandro also has another hospital, Kindred Hospital in the hills. The hospital has no emergency service.
