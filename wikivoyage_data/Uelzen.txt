The new town hall
Uelzen is a town or about 34,000 (2022) in northeast Lower Saxony and also the county town of Uelzen county. It is part of the Hamburg Metropolitan Region and also a Hanseatic town in its own right.
Uelzen is a picturesque place with pretty, timber-framed buildings as well as some impressive examples of North German brick Gothic architecture. The town's fame grew considerably in 2000, when Viennese artist and architect, Friedensreich Hundertwasser, was commissioned to redesign its station. The result was the striking "Hundertwasser Station" which has since become a tourist magnet.
