Yarm is a small town in North Yorkshire, England, which grew up at the tidal limit of the River Tees. Between 1974 and 1996 it was part of a new county, Cleveland, along with neighbouring Stockton-on-Tees. When that was abolished, Stockton was re-assigned to County Durham; but it still governs Yarm even though they're in separate counties. The winding river marks the boundary - just north of it (in County Durham) is the village of Egglescliffe, which has mutated into Eaglescliffe, also described here. They're both effectively suburbs of Stockton, and commuter-belt for Middlesbrough; in 2011 the population of Yarm was about 8400 and of Eaglescliffe was 10,500.
The world's first public railway, the Stockton & Darlington Railway, passed through Eaglescliffe with a spur to Yarm. It opened on 27 Sept 1825, hauled by Stephenson's steam locomotive No 1 "The Locomotion". After the grand opening, steam haulage was reserved for coal — much more lucrative — and passenger trains were horse-drawn until 1833.

Yarm Castle
 Yarm Castle. Wouldn't repel any invader for long. It's almost 3 feet tall, and it's simply a garden ornament at 52 West Street. There was a real Jarum Castle in Norman times at the top of High Street, but no trace remains of that, or of the friary.

Among other advantages, "there are no corners for the devil to hide in."  (updated Jul 2020)
