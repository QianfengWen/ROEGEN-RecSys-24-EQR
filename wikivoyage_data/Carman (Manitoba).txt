Carman has several arts events. Every April the Canadian Wall of Fame for exceptional violin talent is held. 
In February (vocal/choral/speech arts and band/instrumental) and April (piano/strings and dance), Carman hosts the Tempo Festival of the Arts. This includes speech arts, strings, vocal, choral, piano and band classes in association with the Association of Manitoba Music Festivals. 
One of Manitoba's longest existing choral groups is the Sonatrice Singers. The group has been meeting and performing since 1972. This choir has earned bronze and silver at choralfest Canada as well as Manitoba Provincial honours. Their spring concert takes place in early May every year. In addition to this, the Sontrice Singers sing to support the Carman/area Christmas cheer board, Canadian Cancer Society's Relay for Life, seniors homes, hospitals, schools and other places.
