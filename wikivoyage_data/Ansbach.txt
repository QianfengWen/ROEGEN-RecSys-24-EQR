Ansbach is the administrative capital of Middle Franconia, largely due to having been a residence of the Margraves of Ansbach-Bayreuth in the past. At roughly 40,000 inhabitants, it is by far not the largest city in Middle Franconia.

Understand[edit]
The town of Ansbach served as the residence of a cadet branch of the Hohenzollern dynasty and capital of a petty margravial state from the 14th to 19th century. One of the most famous Prussian military marches ("Hohenfriedberger") is a tribute to the Ansbach dragoons. The margraviate of Ansbach was annexed by Bavaria in 1806. For historic reasons, the former residence (rather than the much bigger city of Nuremberg) still serves as the administrative seat of Middle Franconia, hosting a number of agencies, courts and educational facilities that is disproportional to the size of the town.
Kaspar Hauser, a mysterious foundling who claimed to have grown up in complete isolation, lived in Ansbach from 1831 until his violent death two years later. Some believed him to be the abducted heir to the throne of Baden, while others considered him a patent liar and a fraud. Before he succumbed to his injuries, Hauser claimed that he had been assassinated in the court garden; most experts however believe that his injuries were self-inflicted (without suicidal intent) in order to gain attention.
Ansbach is home to an American Army Garrison which has been downsized in the course of post-Cold War withdrawal from Germany.

See[edit]
Orangery
Ansbach has a lovely and well-maintained old town.

49.303110.57581 Ansbach Residence (Margrave's Palace). Large Rococo-style palace (almost disproportional to the size of the town) that now hosts the district government of Middle Franconia and a comprehensive collection of faiences and porcelain, paintings, ballroom with ceiling fresco and hall of mirrors. €4.50.   (updated Jul 2018)
49.302810.57332 St. Gumbertus. Late-romanesque church with burial place of the Ansbach margraves. It was built around 750 CE, and was converted into a Lutheran church when the Margraves became Lutheran. According to the then valid principle of cuius regio eius religio, their subjects had to convert or leave, too.   (updated Jul 2018)
49.303110.57073 St. Johannis, Martin-Luther-Platz. The second major medieval church of the town. Its architecture is Gothic, the interior Baroque.   (updated Jan 2019)
49.301210.571034 Synagogue, Rosenbadstraße. Baroque-style. Unlike most synagogues in Germany, it survived the Nazis' "Kristallnacht" of 1938 almost undamaged. Can only be visited during a guided tour.  (updated Jan 2019)
49.30222210.5802785 Orangerie. Large Baroque-style orangery, part of the court garden.  (updated Jan 2019)
49.30116510.580496 Court garden (Hofgarten). Extensive and idyllic French-styled garden, including limetree avenues, lawns, flower parterre, orangery and citrus house. A medicinal plant garden was layed out according to the works of 16th-century botanist and physician Leonhart Fuchs (name giver of the fuchsia). A stele marks the place where Kaspar Hauser was supposedly assassinated: Hic occultus occulto occisus est ("The mysterious one was killed here in a mysterious way"). (updated Jan 2019)
Do[edit]
49.3026510.577651 Ansbach theater, Promenade 29. Quite an impressive repertoire for such a small town. Founded in the mid 2000s.   (updated Jul 2018)
49.30642810.5571392 Ansbach Grizzlies. One of the oldest American football teams in Germany, they played the very first German Bowl in 1979 against the now defunct Frankfurt Löwen. Their founding, like that of many of the earliest American football teams in Germany was linked to a notable US Army presence in the area. In the first years (before the introduction of more substantial limits on the number of Americans on the field), many of their players were serving tours of duty for the US Army at nearby bases, which have been shut down or greatly reduced in size in the post Cold War era. However, during the 1980s Ansbach produced several German national team players. They played in every German Bowl between 1979 and 1986 (I-VIII), winning it all in 1981, 1982 and 1985. Since those glory days, their fortunes have waned, however, they still field some pretty decent youth teams given the small size of the town.   (updated Jul 2018)
The surroundings of Ansbach are picturesque and inviting for a cycling tour. However they are quite hilly, so if you are not trained at all, you may opt for an e-bike.
