There is a hike from the botanical garden up the hill to the east, which offers a wonderful view of Roseau and the Caribbean Sea. The hike is of easy-to-moderate difficulty and will take a novice hiker perhaps 40 minutes one-way. The hike allows for up-close exploration of many native Caribbean plants, many of which are common house plants outside of the tropics. A small shrine is located at the top of the hill, near a look out. Free.   (updated Dec 2016)
Do[edit]
Emerald Pool
 Emerald Pool. A serene waterfall just outside of the city that's accessible by a short drive followed by a short hike. Due to the water coming from the mountains and the thick forest canopy, the waterfall and pool is relatively cool. (updated Dec 2016)
 Champagne Beach. South of Roseau is this popular spot for swimming, snorkelling, and diving due to bubbles caused by geothermic activity and beautiful coral in the water. The beach is stony but the water is clear and teeming with ocean life. You can access this area by taxi, bus or private car and you will need to make a short walk down from the road to the water.

Buy[edit]

Sundays in Roseau are very quiet and more store-fronts (and many restaurants) are closed. Best to plan for a nature-day on Sundays. However, make sure your transportation is planned because buses and taxis will either not be operating or at much less frequency.
Highlights for travellers in Roseau include the Saturday morning market near where the Roseau River meets the Caribbean Sea. The market vendors start setting up very early (before dawn) to ensure they get good stall locations and snacks can be had by revellers returning late from Friday night festivities. The market is a great place to buy fresh fruit, seafood, and spices. There is less variety but still good prices for vegetables, meat and goods.

 Food Market. Located on the north end of town, this market abounds with vendors selling all kinds of tropical fruit. 
Eat[edit]
Dining in Roseau is centered around Creole fare with an emphasis on fresh local herbs and freshly caught seafood. Even the French, Italian and Chinese dining includes a little creole flavor to satisfy the local palette.
Fast food franchise restaurants KFC and Pizza Hut each have one branch in Roseau.
