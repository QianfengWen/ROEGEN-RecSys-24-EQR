Gijón or Xixón (in Asturian language) is a coastal city in Asturias province in northwest Spain. It lies close to the cities of Aviles and Oviedo. It attracts a growing number of visitors, drawn by a good offer of culture and sports and a strong service sector.


Understand[edit]
Climate[edit]
The weather in Gijón is not like much of the rest of Spain. Gijón is on the northern coast where it is wet and not very hot in summer.
The climate of Gijón may be defined, in this sense, as being temperate, with an average annual temperature of 15 ºC and only slightly varying annual average maximum and minimum temperatures.
Rainfall ranges between 800-1,000 mm/year, fairly regularly distributed, with few very dry periods and no great concentration of rainfall at specific times of the year.
Both variables, temperature and rainfall, are slightly modified at the southeastern border of the municipality, where the highest altitudes are to be found: the temperatures decrease and the rainfall increases.

History[edit]
The first inhabitants of Asturias, arrived 250,000 years ago. Some neanderthal remains are from the Palaeolithic era, and others belongs to the "Asturiense" period, local culture between 7000 and 5000 BC. One of the most important neanderthal remains are Mount Areo dolmens.
The territory was occupied continuously during the Middle Ages, proof of which is the Romanesque churches dating from the 12th and 13th centuries. The founding of the Puebla (Village) in 1270 implied an urban expansion that was to come to a standstill at the end of the 14th century, when Gijón became the stage for the Trastámara conflicts, during which the town was almost completely destroyed.
In the 18th century, the erudite Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos laid out the plans for the development of Gijón. The process of industrialisation begun in the mid-19th century changed the city into the industrial centre of Asturias, with its leading El Musel Port, shipyards and numerous manufacturing installations.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Asturias airport (OVD IATA) is 30 km west of north of Gijón, close to Avilés. It has flights from Madrid, Barcelona, Palma de Mallorca, Sevilla and other Spanish airports, as well as international flights from Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and the United Kingdom. (as of September 2023).
A direct ALSA bus runs between Gijón bus station and the airport hourly taking 45 min; the fare is €8. A taxi costs €40 and takes 20 min.
Other flight options are to use Santander which has budget flights (eg Ryanair from London Stansted), 3 hours away by bus, or fly into Madrid and reach Oviedo by bus or train.

By train[edit]
The Spanish railway company RENFE run direct trains from Alicante and Madrid via Oviedo, plus frequent metro services around the area. Metric gauge company Feve also has a line inland through Oviedo, connecting there with its slow, scenic services along the coast west to Ribadeo and Ferrol, east to Santander, Bilbao, San Sebastian and Irun / Hendaye on the French border. Feve is nowadays owned by Renfe with timetables on that website, but the systems aren't integrated. So between Oviedo and Gijón there are duplicate trains and tracks with non-interchangeable ticketing (adult single €6.80): this means trains at least hourly but doesn't look sustainable.
43.537652-5.6751321 Gijón railway station is the terminus for both Renfe (Iberian gauge) and Feve (metric gauge) trains. It's 500 m west of city centre along c. Sanz Crespo. Old maps show a welter of railway sidings continuing towards town, but these are ripped up and it's now just a brownfield expanse of gravel and buddleia. This means you can cross by a paved path at street level (eg towards the railway museum) and don't need to use the road bridge of c. Carlos Marx.

By bus[edit]
ALSA runs several direct services a day from Madrid and some other Spanish cities.

43.538915-5.6671072 ALSA bus station, Calle Magnus Blikstad, 4. 24/7. Bus station for all ALSA lines. It's also an historical protected building in rationalist-expressionist style, opened in 1941. It's on the corner of Magnus Blikstad and Llanes streets, and the 1940s company logo in the Llanes street front. (updated Feb 2018)

From east and west, A-8 runs along the coast, toll-free except between Bilbao and Behobie-French border.

Walking will let you interact with local people. Don't hesitate to ask them for advice or help, because they are warm and friendly. Foreign languages may be challenging for them (more so for older people), but some writing and gesturing will do the trick.

Gijón has a decent network of cycle lanes which allows a comfortable city visit. There are 8 public and free bike stations, but a Tarjeta Ciudadana (Citizen Card) is required to take a bike from a station. Anyone can get a Tarjeta Ciudadana, but it takes some time and patience to do the paperwork (in Spanish)
There are also plenty of bike shops where yo can get parts or repair your bike if you need so. Be warned also not to leave your bike unattended, even locked in a bike parking, or some pieces might be stolen. It's not so common but, just in case...

By taxi[edit]
Taxis in Gijón urban area may cost between €6 and €20, depending on distance. Extra fees may apply in stations, out of urban area and by night. There are several radio-taxi companies which may send you a free cab within a few minutes.

Eat[edit]
If Gijón and Asturias are characterized by something it is by their tasty and varied gastronomy. Produce is not lacking, fish, seafood, meats, cider and delicious pastries. To promote all these attractions and enhance this work that has been carried out for three years, Gijón Joint Tourism Board has devised a plan of action focused on five main axes: Gijón Gourmet Menu; Sweet-toothed Gijón; Cider Routes; Gijón Cocktails and Going out for pinchos around Gijón.
Gijón Gourmet Menu arose 5 years ago to make the city's new culinary trends known by encouraging restaurants distinguished by some quality seal or mark to popularize its cuisine. Given the success of this initiative, the idea is to further extend the product by enhancing the use of produce in the region.
As its name suggests Sweet-toothed Gijon aims at highlighting one of the citys biggest attractions, its wonderful pastries. Therefore, Gijón is known for having the largest number of bakers shops per capita in the country, something that the townspeople boast about because of their fondness for sweet treats. Thus, its pastries, cakes, and chocolate will be closer to visitors. The product, presented with authenticity and uniqueness, would create routes of associated establishments in the city with the chance to taste the specialties of each establishment.
Cider Routes Gijón, being the largest borough producing this famous drink throughout the Principality, seeks to link the culture of cider, its elaboration and its presence in the city. For this reason, we will have the collaboration of Comarca de la Sidra (Cider Shire).
Gijón Cocktails.This initiative is born to encourage the catering and tourism sector bringing the citizen closer to the cocktail world as it is a very important part of gastronomy. The idea is to organize a contest on the streets and suggest routes by the participating establishments. Going out for pinchos and tapas around Gijón is a logical action given the long tradition of tapas (appetizers) and the need to enhance pinchos (small snacks) with an increasing demand among the townspeople themselves.

Go next[edit]
Oviedo is a short half-hour drive (or bus) from Gijón. More classically picturesque but quieter than Gijón, Oviedo has plenty of museums, churches and parks to pass the time, and as the capital of the region also has excellent transport links.
The Picos de Europa, one of Europe's best-kept secrets, is a national park centred around a dramatic snow-capped mountain range, to the outsider appearing more reminiscent of the Alps than what one may expect of Spain. There are buses and a (phenomenally slow and unreliable) rail service serving the southeast corner of Asturias, where the national park is located.
