Cities[edit]
Labuan is an island with an estimated population of 100,000 people. It's quite a close community where everyone knows everyone. The main town is known as Labuan Town (Bandar Labuan in Malay) but was known as Victoria during the colonial era. Labuan Town is among the cleanest towns in Malaysia and has been called "the Pearl of Borneo". Labuan was proclaimed a Federal Territory in 1984 and declared an International Offshore Financial Centre in 1990.
The major businesses on the island include international offshore banking, steel mills, a methanol plant, floor tiles production, flour mills, and offshore supplies. Because of these major businesses, Labuan has many non-Labuan natives that work here.

Understand[edit]
Geography[edit]
Federal Territory of Labuan is located off the northwest coast of Borneo, north of Brunei Bay, and faces the South China Sea. It comprises the main island of Pulau Labuan and six smaller islands: Pulau Kuraman, Pulau Daat, Pulau Rusukan Besar, Pulau Rusukan Kecil, Pulau Papan and Pulau Burong. It is located at 05 latitude North and 115 longitude East, and lies approximately 10 km southeast off the coast of the East Malaysian state of Sabah and 25 km north of Brunei. The Federal Territory of Labuan covers an area of 92 km2 and the main island of Labuan is 75 km2. The island is mainly flat and undulating and the highest point is only 85 m.

Economy[edit]
More than 70 percent of the island is still under vegetation. Due to the fact that land utility is geared more towards property and industrial use, there is less agricultural activity in the area. Most of the island's prime land, waterfront and suburbs are used for residential and tourism development. A sizeable area on the southwestern side of the island is used by shipbuilding, manufacturing and oil and gas industries.

Climate[edit]
Labuan has a tropical climate with two annual monsoon seasons - the South West monsoon from April to June and the North East monsoon from September to December. It is free from hurricanes and typhoons and enjoys good climate all year round. Daily temperatures average 28-32°C.

History[edit]
Memorial stone from 1846
The island's name came from Brunei Malay word "labohan" which means anchorage. Labuan had a glorious history under the rule of various empires. After the demise of the Majapahit Empire in the 14th century, Labuan came under the rule of the Brunei Sultanate. On 24 December 1846, Captain G.R. Mundy, commanding H.M.S. Iris, took possession of Labuan, "In the Name of Her Majesty Victoria Queen of Great Britain and Ireland under the Direction of His Excellency Rear Admiral Sir Thomas Cochrane, C.B., Commander-in-Chief".
The British had negotiated with the Sultanate of Brunei for Labuan among other things. By 1847 the British government concluded a Treaty of Friendship and Commerce with the Sultan of Brunei, at the same time acquiring the island of Labuan. On 1 August 1848, Labuan was declared a free port and open to settlers. The Colonial Office took over Labuan in January 1906. In 1907 it became part of the Straits Settlements, a British colony comprising Singapore, Penang and Malacca.
During World War II, Labuan was occupied by the Japanese, along with other parts of what was then called British North Borneo (now Sabah). Thousands of Allied troops died in the fighting and eventual defeat of the Japanese in Labuan.
In 1963, Sabah joined the Federation of Malaysia, with Labuan included as a district of Sabah. In the 1984 Labuan Agreement, Sabah agreed to cede Labuan to the Federal Government of Malaysia. Labuan became a Federal Territory, with a status equivalent to that of the states of Malaysia.

Tourist information[edit]
There are at least two information offices on the island: one is at the international arrivals hall in Labuan ferry terminal, second - in front of Labuan Muzium.

Sport fishing - Pulau Labuan is surrounded by six smaller islands namely Pulau Kuraman, Pulau Daat, Pulau Rusukan Besar, Pulau Rusukan Kecil, Pulau Papan and Pulau Burong. The blue clear water around these idyllic islands is home to one of the world's richest coral and fishing grounds which offers unlimited deep sea tackling and coastal table-fish catches.
Labuan also hosts the International Sea Challenge in May every year which comprises four events - the Underwater Treasure Hunt, Jet Sport Challenge, Cross Channel Swim Challenge and Big Game Fishing Tournament.
Wreck diving - Pulau Labuan has one of the best wreck diving sites in Asia. There are four wreck sites on the island's locally known as the Australian Wreck. The Australian Wreck provides a very atmospheric dive thanks to the combination of the less than 10m visibility, rich coral growth, the skeletal remains of the ship, her tragic end and a reputation to be haunted. The American Wreck has a rich and tragic history, having been capsized during the World War II era with the loss of 9 lives. This journey back in time is complete with the sightings of bullet clips, depth chargers, wire bottles and canon artifacts still intact. Cement Wreck. The shallowest wreck in Labuan with its super structure rising to 19 m and the way it sits makes it the easiest to pass through and great for wreck diving training for beginners. The Cement Wreck also offers rare whale shark sightings to lucky divers. Blue Water Wreck, also known as Mabini Padre, is a large Philippines fishing trawler, which caught fire and sank in 1981. The completely intact vessel with masts lies on its side and is enhanced by an abundance of marine life. However, there are no diving operators in Labuan, and one has to organize a trip from Brunei or Sabah.
Beaches - As the Pearl of South China Sea, it has beautiful stretches of beaches. The famous ones are Batu Manikar, Pancur Hitam and Layang-layangan beach where the locals hang out and have a BBQ picnic during the weekend. These beaches won the United Nation COBSEA Clean Beach Award 2008. The award is well deserved as every morning Labuan Corporation workers can be seen hard at work cleaning the beach from any rubbish and debris.

Duty-free shopping - Labuan's modern shopping centres carry a wide range of locally produced and imported goods. Most popular are spirits and tobacco, textiles and appliances. Every end of the year, the island hosts a month-long shopping carnival with attractive discounts. Cultural shows add to the excitement
International Offshore Financial Centre - Pulau Labuan is Asia's newest international offshore financial centre. The 65 foreign banks operating on the island offer sophisticated offshore banking services and numbered accounts facilities to the world's rich and famous.
Although it's a duty-free island, the things here are not that cheap. However, the followed items should be cheaper than other places:

Pearl & crystals - Made into jewelleries like brooch, bracelets, pendants, earrings, and baju Melayu buttons. Bazaar Labuan is a good place to shop for them.
Cars - Especially imported ones. But, they are subjected to taxes when transported out of the island.
Chocolate - Lots of choices too, that hard to be found in Peninsular.
Cigarette - The price is half of the Peninsula's, but the flavor is not that desirable to some smokers.
Alcohol
Batik sarongs (RM10 is reasonable and normal price in Malaysia, if more than that, you shouldn't buy it!)
Seafood - Wet Market near Bazaar Labuan is a recommended place. You can even ask the sellers to pack the items frozen-ready for flights. Recommended place to buy frozen ready seafood is SBS Seafood Sdn. Bhd in the center of Labuan town. Just ask a local or taxi driver, they can show you where is the shop. Recommended to buy - frozen fish coated with flour which is RM14 per bag, deep-fried it; very crunchy and boneless fish!
Things that are really exorbitant here:

Computer stuff - sometimes almost double the Peninsula's.
Electronics

Stay safe[edit]
Labuan is full of prostitutes. Additionally, sex slavery is a very real issue in Malaysia, particularly Labuan. Steer clear of the karaoke bars and pool halls, especially if you value your sexual health.
Labuan is a very safe town. It is a very peaceful place and the people are very nice and friendly. Except road blocks with JPJ (local Department Motor Vehicle), police presence is pretty hard to notice, possibly because of the calmness and peace of the town.
You can notice lots of people jogging around in the evenings, even in the secluded roads in the hills, without the fear of being mugged that they might have in other big cities.
Crime rate is very low, except once in a while, there used to be physical arguments between the immigrants, but only among themselves.
Roads are not busy, except occasionally in town. The driving attitude of people here is quite leisurely​, so it's common to have a car cruising in front of you very, very slowly without any purpose. There are lots of jaywalkers, and pedestrians crossing the road don't practice much caution. Several attractions such as Peace Park and Anjung Ketam are located in village areas where children usually play near or at the road. Be careful if you're driving.

Go next[edit]
Sabah, Brunei, and Sarawak are logical places to go next (see #By boat above for information on ferry service).
