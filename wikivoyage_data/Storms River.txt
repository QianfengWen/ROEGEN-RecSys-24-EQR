Storms River (Stormsriver) is a small village in the Eastern Cape on the Garden Route surrounded by pine plantations along the N2. It is the gateway to the Tsitsikamma National Park.


Understand[edit]
Storms River
Storms River
Only a short drive east of Knysna, Storms River comprises more than just a village – it is a synonym for anything adventurous and daring, mild or wild. Storms River mouth is spanned by a suspension bridge, offering breathtaking views over rocks and coves and crashing waves of the Indian Ocean. The bridge leads to a lookout point from which sweeping views over a verdant forest and the Storms River camp reward any hike to this area. A first-class eco-destination, ecologically sensitive activities such as bungee jumping from the Bloukrans River Bridge, and canopy tours, are two of the most popular things to do at Storms River and surrounds!

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Located on the N2 the village is easily accessible by car from Port Elizabeth and Cape Town as well as other towns along the Garden Route.

By bus[edit]
The main companies stop in Storms River at the petrol station on their Cape Town—Port Elizabeth run. The petrol station is 5 km from town, all establishments in Storms River will charge something like R50 for pick up and drop off. The cheaper option: the public bus, drives from Knysna towards Port Elizabeth in the morning, returning to Knysna in the afternoon. The bus stops north of Storms River West (township) on the N2 (which is walking distance), around 07:30 and 15:30, bus fare to PE costs R60, way less than what the main companies charge.

There is no rail station nor airport in Storms River. Though the nearest train station is at Assegaai, in Kareedouw (40 km), as a stop of the Apple Express[dead link]. The nearest airports are located either in George or in Port Elizabeth, both 180 km away.
