Yass Court House
Yass is a country service town on the intersection of the Hume Highway (M31) and Barton Highway (A25) in New South Wales, just under an hour north-west of Canberra. It has a range of accommodation and good facilities for those passing through, and a handful of local attractions for wishing to relax a little longer.


Understand[edit]
Before the Yass Bypass was complete, the Hume Highway used to pass straight down the main street of town.  The high street consisted of service stations, take-aways and motels.  There are now highway services on the freeway, and little passing traffic through the town.

By car[edit]
Yass is 3 hours drive from Sydney and 6 hours drive from Melbourne on the Hume Highway. Yass is approximately a 40-50 minute drive from Canberra, the national capital.

By train[edit]
Because of an historical curiosity, the train service from Sydney to Melbourne does not pass through Yass.  It was linked by a spur line that has long since closed.  Accordingly, you will need to be picked up or get a taxi from Yass Junction to Yass.
Train services run from Sydney and Melbourne to Yass Junction and are provided by NSW Trainlink (tel 13 22 32). Trains run run twice a day in both directions. It is approximately 4 hours from Sydney by train ($45 economy) and 7.5 hours from Melbourne ($90 economy).

By bus[edit]
Bus services are provided by:

NSW Trainlink from Cootamundra and, in the other direction, from Queanbeyan (the service passes through Canberra but does not pick up passengers).
