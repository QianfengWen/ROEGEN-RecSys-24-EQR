Fort Augustus is a village in  The Great Glen, the fault line that traverses the Scottish Highlands. It's at the south end of Loch Ness, midway between Fort William and Inverness, and in 2023 had a population of about 650. Originally called Cille Chuimein (Church of St Cummein, anglicised as "Kiliwhimin"), it was renamed for Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, who crushed the Jacobite rebellion of 1745. The fort has disappeared beneath later buildings and the main reason to stop off here is to see Loch Ness and the Caledonian Canal. 
Invermoriston is a village five miles north along Loch Ness, and Invergarry is five miles south on Loch Oich; their facilities are also described on this page.


Get in[edit]
57°8′42″N 4°40′48″WMap of Fort Augustus
The town is on A82, which traverses the Great Glen between Fort William and Inverness along the west bank of Loch Ness. 
Citylink Bus 919 runs along A82 from Fort William via Spean Bridge, Laggan, Invergarry, Fort Augustus (one hour), Invermoriston, Castle Urquhart and Drumnadrochit to Inverness (another hour), four times M-Sa and twice on Sunday. The bus stops at the Medical Centre south of the river (handiest for most accommodation) then by the parking lot just north of the bridge. 
Buses to Skye bypass Fort Augustus. You either change at Drumnadrochit for Bus 917 Inverness-Portree, or at Invergarry for Bus 915/916 Glasgow-Fort William-Portree-Uig.

Get around[edit]
Fort Augustus is small and walkable. The bus links Glengarry and Invermoriston.

See[edit]
57.1449-4.68231 Caledonian Canal stretches coast to coast for 60 miles along the Great Glen, from Corpach near Fort William to Inverness. At Fort Augustus it climbs by a ladder of five locks towards Loch Oich, the highest point on the system. The canal parallels the non-navigable River Oich, with a footpath along the bootlace island between.
57.1461-4.67522 Pepper Pot Lighthouse was built in 1840. It's simply a channel marker to indicate the entrance to the canal.
57.145-4.6773 The Fort was built in the 1730s to curb the Jacobites. In the 19th century it became a Benedictine Abbey and school, which closed in 1993. Subsequently there were widespread and well-evidenced claims of abuse of the pupils by the monks. The building became a heritage centre but costs far outran income. It's now luxury apartments trading as Highland Club. You can stroll the grounds.
Invergarry Castle is a gaunt shell within the grounds of Glengarry Castle Hotel, see Sleep. It's a 17th-century L-plan tower house, part-demolished by Cumberland after the battle of Culloden to render it useless to rebels. In this he was copying Cromwell, who'd torched it a century earlier.
