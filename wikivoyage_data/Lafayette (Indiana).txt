The area is divided by the Wabash River. To the east of the river is Lafayette and to the west is West Lafayette. Lafayette is broken down into several neighborhoods. Starting at the river and heading east is downtown. Here you will find numerous shops and restaurants as well as most of the museums and theaters. North of downtown is the Historical Centennial Neighborhood. South of downtown is the Ninth Street Hill Neighborhood. Most of the shopping and hotels are either downtown or along one of the main arteries. State Rd 26 runs east and west bisecting both cities. State Rd 52 curves around the East side of town and crosses the river into the Northern side of West Lafayette. On State Rd 52 near the Southeast side of town you will find the Tippecanoe Mall. Interstate 65 marks the eastern edge of Lafayette. From South to North there are 4 exits for Lafayette, St Rd 38, St Rd 26, St Rd 25, and St Rd 43 (for West Lafayette).
The John T. Myers Pedestrian Bridge connects downtown Lafayette with West Lafayette. Starting at the river and heading west into West Lafayette is the Levee area and Wabash Landing. This area is fairly new with several shops, a multiplex theater, a park, and an outdoor ice skating rink. Continue west up the hill on State Rd. 26 to the Chauncey Hill and Village area. There you will find most of the college bars and several restaurants. Continue west on Hwy. 26 to pass through the main campus of Purdue University. To the north and east of Purdue is the main residential area of West Lafayette.

Bus, There are 15 bus routes around the cities. Tickets are $1, 10 tokens for $7.50 (you can ask for one free transfer ticket), $28 for a calendar month pass, free for students and staff at Purdue. There is a free trolley bus going from downtown Lafayette to West Lafayette/Purdue and back every 15 minutes.  Some bus lines do not run on weekends, in the summer, or anytime when classes are not in session; check schedules for details.  Lafayette and the surroundings areas are suburban and relatively spread out; a private automobile is recommended.

Lafayette[edit]

Drink[edit]
Lafayette[edit]
Ben Hur Tavern, 1002 S 4th.
Biltmore Tap Room, 1202 S 4th.
 Black Sparrow, 223 Main St. Located right down town across from the Red Seven restaurant. Smaller lunch / dinner menu with unique items. The closest Lafayette comes to a hipster bar. Bands often play on Friday / Saturday nights and sometimes there is a cover charge. 
 Checkerboard Tavern, 1521 Kossuth St. careful, they don't seem to change their fryer oil often enough. 
6th Street Dive, 827 N 6th. Craft beers, everybody just sort of seems to find room for another one.
 Danzer's Show Club, 3481 McCarty Ln. Strip club. 
 DT Kirby's, 605 Main St. Delicious (greasy) food that will stop your heart, great liquor selection, friendly dive bar atmosphere (as long as you're a Bears fan.) 
Filling Station, 2603 Greenbush.
 Hunter's Pub, 1092 Sagamore Parkway, West Lafayette, ☏ +1 765 463-7785. 
 East End Grille, 1016 Main Street. Great restaurant in Killer Beans Coffee's old spot, probably one of the best in town. Upscale for Lafayette (but that isn't hard to do) 
 Knickerbocker Saloon, 113 N 5th St, ☏ +1 765 423-2234. Founded in 1835, billed as Indiana's oldest bar. Note that the bar itself is the oldest in Indiana, but it was moved to this location. Tons of live music, sometimes jazz or other local bands. Cover is charged when bands are playing. 
 Lafayette Brewing Company, 622 Main St, ☏ +1 765 742-2591. One of two Lafayette breweries (do not ask for a bud light here, only beer made on site served). Brew pub with very good selection of beers. Also has good food and a second floor stage with live music and open mic nights. 
Linwood Tavern, 1244 N 14th.
 Professor Joe's Pizza, 648 Main St.

 The Tick Tock Tavern & Eatery, 1816 N. 9th Street. 
West Lafayette[edit]
 Brother's Bar & Grill, 306 W. State Street. Brother's always has specials and hence makes it a fairly cheap alternative to Harry's or Yacht Club. Much more relaxed atmosphere compared to other bars on campus. 
 Harry's Chocolate Shop, 329 W State St. Harry's is a campus classic and has been around since the times of prohibition. It used to be a soda fountain but don't expect any chocolate to be served in this drinking mainstay. The vast majority of Purdue's campus will probably say Harry's is their favorite bar since it has a little of something for everyone. Strong drinks. 
 Neon Cactus, 360 Brown St. Dance club and piano bar. On Thursday nights it is mostly frequented by college students as there is a $5 cover and $0.50 32-oz beers/$1.75 32-oz well drinks. 
 Nine Irish Brothers Traditional Irish Pub, 402 Brown St (Just N of the River Rd & State intersection), ☏ +1 765 746-4782. 11AM-1AM daily. An impressively authentic Irish pub, with above average food—plenty of Irish cuisine such as shepherd's pie, Guinness beef stew, fish and chips, Connemara chicken, and--of course--corned beef and cabbage. It would be a great little Irish pub just for the atmosphere, but the big attractions are the bar and the entertainment. Nine Brothers has great draught beer, and a full bar with an impressive selection of Irish whiskeys, which are surpirsingly affordable. On weekends, the menu and booze are complemented by live Irish music; otherwise you can stop in to watch European sports (football, rugby, Gaelic football, hurling) on the telly, as well as the obligatory Purdue, Cubs, Bears, and Colts games. 
 Where Else? Bar, 304 State St. Dance floor in the back, students tend to gather here at the end of their bar crawl. Featured in Sports Illustrated as #7 College Tailgate Location in the Nation. Featured on Big Ten Network for being the home of "BREAKFAST CLUB". 
 Brokerage Brewing, 2516 Covington St West Lafayette, ☏ +1 765 233-2767. 21+. Local Brewery. (updated Aug 2023)
Sleep[edit]
Bed and Breakfast[edit]
 Loeb House. 
Hotels[edit]
Tons of hotels on Route 26 near Interstate 65, budget-moderate priced: Holiday Inn Express, Best Western, Comfort Inn, Day's Inn, Red Roof Inn, etc.—pick your favorite chain. These are outside of comfortable walking distance from West Lafayette (and therefore Purdue University), but only about a 20-minute drive from the heart of campus. If you're driving into town anyway and don't need pedestrian access to campus or downtown West Lafayette, these are a good (and often cheaper) choice.
 Comfort Suites Lafayette University Area, 31 Frontage Rd, ☏ +1 765-447-0016. Breakfast and indoor pool. $75. 
 Union Club Hotel, 101 North Grant Street, ☏ +1 765 494-8913, fax: +1 765 494-8924. Right on Purdue's campus, inside of the Purdue Union building. Good restaurants downstairs in the Union.
