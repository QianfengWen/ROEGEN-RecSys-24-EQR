 Namdroling Monastery. Is located at 4th camps, and with around 3,000 monks is the largest Nyingma monastery outside of Tibet. Nyingma Monastry is also known as Golden Temple; this name was given my the tourists. It is especially famous for its three copper and gold plated statues of Buddha (one 60 Ft. high and the other two 58 Ft. high) located in the Golden Temple. In accordance with the Vajrayana Buddhist tradition, sacred scriptures and stupas have been placed inside these statues as a means of consectration. This monastery is popular with local Tibetans who attend rituals ceremonies (pujas), and visitors are very welcome to stroll around the monastery grounds and may freely turn the prayer wheels and circumambulate the stupas. According to Tibetan belief, turning prayer wheels disseminates the prayers to the five directions. 'Wind Horses' (lungta), which are flags enscribed with prayers, have the same function. 
Sera - This monastic community is comprised of two monasteries, Sera Jey and Sera Mey, and with a combined population of almost 5,000 it is one of the largest Tibetan Buddhist monastic communities outside of Tibet.

 Debate/"Question answer" sessions, At Sera the monasteries. These sessions are a great sight to watch. The students have 2 question answer sessions every day, one in the morning at around 9:30 AM, other in the evening. The debates are 1-to-1 and the sight of all the students(pairs of students) debating parallely is really a thing to see, especially the clapping action that the questioning student does.

 Science center at Sera Jey Monastery (In the Sera Jey Monastic complex). It is an interesting science center if you get somebody to explain it (Search for somebody called Khechok, he manages the science center and is a great person to talk to). This is a great attempt to bridge the said gap between "modern" technology and the age old traditions of Buddhism (updated Sep 2016)
Do[edit]
Prayer wheels. Those with enough stamina can rotate the prayer wheels that surround the monastery compound. The wheels contain consecrated mantras and prayers, and it is believed that those who turn them in a clockwise direction and with a pure motivation of benefiting others are creating the causes and conditions that will eventually place them in a position where they themselves can help relieve others of their suffering. Although turning the wheels is considered an alternative to chanting mantras, most devotees combine the two activities.
