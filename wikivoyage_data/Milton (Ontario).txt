Main St. Downtown Milton
Milton is a town of 110,000 people (2016) in Southern Ontario, approximately 40 km (25 mi) west of Toronto.

Understand[edit]
History[edit]
The town took root out of a settlement by Jasper Martin along the Sixteen Mile Creek; Martin immigrated from Newcastle upon Tyne, England with his wife Sarah and two sons in 1818. Martin was granted 100 acres (40 ha) of land, from the Crown in 1820. Martin built a grist mill along the creek and created a pond, known as Mill Pond, to power his mill. The mill became the centre of settlement for others as they settled in the region. In 1837 the area had a population of approximately 100 people and was named after the English poet John Milton.
