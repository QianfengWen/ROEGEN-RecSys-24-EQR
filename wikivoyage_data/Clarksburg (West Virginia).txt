Clarksburg, also called the "Jewel of the Hills", is a city of 16,000 people (2020) in West Virginia. It is the county seat of Harrison Count in the North Central West Virginia region, also known as 'Mountaineer Country' and the 'I-79 Technology Corridor'. 
Clarksburg and Harrison County have a large percentage of residents of Italian ancestry, their families mostly arriving during an industrial boom in the early 1900s, making Clarksburg a natural location of the West Virginia Italian Heritage Festival held every year in downtown Clarksburg since 1979, and many Italian restaurants can be found in the area.


Understand[edit]
West Main Street between South 4th and South 3rd Streets
Clarksburg is almost 1,000 ft above sea level in a region of steeply rolling hills along the West Fork River. 
Established in 1785, it was named for General George Rogers Clark, an important military leader in the Revolutionary War and the brother of William Clark, who was half of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. It was the birthplace of Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson. 
Clarksburg, along with Fairmont 20 minutes north, has a fairly large population descended from Italian immigrants, many of whom came to the area to work in the coal mines and the glass factories. While Fairmont claims to be the place of origin of West Virginia's official state food: the pepperoni roll; Clarksburg also has a large proportion of bakeries specializing in the dish. Many Italians initially settled in the Glen Elk neighborhood, located between the train station (now a CSX office) and downtown on the other side of Elk Creek.  
Clarksburg has suffered significant population loss within its city limits, as of 2020 half of its 1950 peak. Additionally, the historic downtown business district has suffered an apocalyptic vacancy rate with many grand buildings from Clarksburg's wealthy heyday at risk of demolition. While some of this is directly due to de-industrialization, more has to do with suburbanization and lack of civic motive to invest in the city center, evidenced by the fact that the suburb of Bridgeport to the east of Clarksburg has grown significantly during this time, and the retail nucleus of Harrison County has transitioned to a long string of big-box style development on Emily Dr. (paralleling I-79) between Clarksburg and Bridgeport.
