Understand[edit]
Burrillville is part of Providence County. The town was settled in the 1600s and recognized as its own town in the 1800s. It was named after senator James Burrill, Jr. Today, Burrillville is home to just under 16,000 residents. The town is divided into seven smaller villages: Pascoag, Harrisville, Mapleville, Nasonville, Mohegan, Oakland and Glendale. Each village has its own history; the villages were founded around their respective mill complexes. Residents often identify themselves according to which village they live in. For example, most residents will say they live in Harrisville, rather than Burrillville.
