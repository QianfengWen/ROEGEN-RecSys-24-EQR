Metz is in the Grand-Est region of France and in the Moselle departement that borders Luxembourg and Germany.


Understand[edit]

Due to its German heritage and military tradition, Metz has yet to earn much respect in the eyes of the French. Most of the criticism about Metz is clichéd and unwarranted; in fact, Strasbourg has stronger German heritage yet has been overwhelmingly embraced by the French and visitors alike.
Metz and the rest of the region offer much to view of historical interest, as well as a well-rounded shopping scene, ranging from the low- to high-end and including a great Saturday farmers' market.

History and name[edit]
This location has been inhabited from the days of early man, and was subsequently settled and fought over too many times to name. The first known permanent settlers in the area were a Celtic tribe known as the Mediomatrici. They found that the area was rich in resources, and supposed it easier to defend, as the confluence of the Seille and Moselle rivers created several islands at this spot. The area became known as the Oppidum of the Medioatrici until the Greco-Roman times, when the city was incorporated into the Roman Empire and become known as Divodurum Mediomatricum, meaning the "Holy Fortress of the Mediomatric". Later, the name evolved to Mediometrix. In the 5th century the name evolved into 'Mettis', which ultimately evolved into 'Metz'.
Metz was the birthplace of the Carolingian Dynasty before becoming the capital of the burgeoning Kingdom of Lotharingia (855-958 AD); then it was the capital of the Duchy of Upper Lorraine (959-1233), before breaking away to form an independent city state during the high Middle Ages (1234-1552). As such, Metz was one of the most powerful cities in feudal Europe, and this rich cultural history can still be seen, particularly in its grand Cathedral and its beautiful old town built using the "pierre de Jaumont", a local yellow-colored limestone.

Talk[edit]
Although Metz is close to Luxembourg and Germany, locals are not fluent in German and speak French as in any other French city. The local German dialect (Platt) is spoken in some parts of northern and eastern Moselle but spoken in Metz infrequently.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Metz lies along the A31, north of Nancy and south of Luxembourg.  From Paris or Strasbourg, take the A4 to the A31; Metz is just to the south.

By plane[edit]
48.9783336.2466671 Metz–Nancy–Lorraine Airport (ETZ  IATA) (southeast of Metz). A small regional airport for Metz and Nancy. Once a decent mid-sized airport, its golden years are long gone. Most destinations served are in France.   (updated Feb 2023)
 Luxembourg Airport. Located nearby in Luxembourg, this airport is small compared to other 'international' European hubs, but it serves most major destinations around the continent. From Metz, you can drive there in less than an hour. Otherwise, you can take a train to Luxembourg-City, then take a bus to the airport; expect this journey to take about 1.5 hours (updated Feb 2023)
If you are feeling adventurous or do not mind taking your time, you can also fly from Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Strasbourg, and Saarbrücken airports.

By car[edit]
Driving in the centre of town is not recommended.  Park in one of the parking areas (well-marked from the main roads in) and walk or use public transport.
Be aware of immigrant beggars in parking areas offering to watch your car and approaching you at ticket machines when your wallet is in your hand. Local police refuse to prevent this activity even though they accept it is illegal and keeps visitors away.

On foot[edit]
This is an easy city to navigate on foot as most any-place is a short walk and it takes less time to walk than to spend time looking for parking.
Take a downtown map if you do not know your way around, however, you will find it easy to learn the layout and will very soon be comfortable on your own.
Take your time and enjoy the varied sights and sounds of this city. Its buildings are varied in design, style and age with fun and fanciful details you will miss if you are not looking.
Everything in the city centre is easily accessible on foot, and much of the main downtown/shopping area is pedestrian.  There are a few hills, though!
By bicycle[edit]
Bikes are also a great way to get around, though the same comment about hills applies here too.
If the weather is nice, rent a bike and head south along the river Moselle in the direction of Nancy or Thionville.  Paths are well-marked, well-maintained, and mostly flat.  Bikes are available next to the train station or across the street from the cathedral.  Cost is €10 per day (but requires a credit card number or cash deposit of €100 per bike).

Stay safe[edit]
Metz is quite a safe town. Even so, it might be a good idea to avoid suburbs like Borny or St Eloy, and the old town's small alleys by night.
In the centre, some people are likely to ask you to give them some money or a cigarette. Feel free to say no.
Don't walk from Lafayette to Resam (Résidence Arts & Métiers de Metz-Technopôle) late at night.
