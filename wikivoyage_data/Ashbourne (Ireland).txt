This page describes a town near Dublin. For the town in Derbyshire, see Ashbourne.
Ashbourne is in County Meath, 22 km northwest of Dublin city centre and the airport. It's a commuter town, with a population in 2022 of 16,000. You'd probably only come to visit Emerald Park (formerly Tayto Park); or if you flew into Dublin in the evening it would provide an overnight stop before you drove on northwest. The town was originally Killeglan or Kildeglan (Cill Dhéagláin, "Déaglán's church"). The area was bought up in the 19th century by Frederick Bourne, a transport entrepreneur, who set up a coaching inn and (presumably after much cogitation) renamed the place Ashbourne. He just happened to like ash trees, it's a mercy he didn't have a thing for eucalyptus. 
Ratoath 5 km west is another commuter town, with a population of 10,000 in 2022. 
Dunshaughlin another 8 km west is the third commuter town, with a population of 6600 in 2022, and some abbey ruins. 


Understand[edit]
Potatoes are a staple food in Ireland - blighted harvests in the 1840s caused mass starvation and emigration. Yet already in the early 19th century they were also a luxury item, in the form of thinly-sliced deep-fried potato crisps. In North America these are called potato chips but in Ireland and the UK that denotes a thicker fried slice, also known as French Fries. The earliest known recipe for crisps is in The Cook's Oracle by William Kitchiner in 1817. They became popular as a kitchen or restaurant delicacy but evolved in the early 20th century into a mass-produced snack food, and the global market in potato crisps is now around US $ 17 billion. In 2022 you might pay €2 per kilo for potatoes but €15 for the equivalent weight in crisps; it costs nowhere near €13 to make them. 
From the 1920s a little bag of salt was included in the packet, but crisps were unflavoured until the 1950s. In 1954 Joe "Spud" Murphy founded Tayto and offered Cheese & Onion and Salt & Vinegar flavoured crisps, and other companies vied to buy rights to use his techniques. The Tayto factory was based in Coolock on the north edge of Dublin; this closed in 2005 but production continues elsewhere. (Tayto (Northern Ireland), founded in 1956, is a separate company in County Armagh making similar products under licence.) Weird flavours that have been used for crisps include octopus, hedgehog, Cajun squirrel, white chocolate with pepper and cappuccino. They also come in different formats, such as the even saddle-shape of Pringles. In 2010, Tayto capitalised on their success by opening Tayto Park, Ireland's only major theme park, near Ashbourne. In 2015 Tayto was sold to the German food company Intersnack. Tayto Park was renamed Emerald Park.

See[edit]
Ashbourne is modern and nondescript, straggling along R135, and its medieval remains are tucked away beneath Lidl supermarket. Church of the Immaculate Conception is the 1880s RC parish church. The Arkle memorial commemorates the famous steeplechaser of 1957-1970. Although himself a gelding, he's ended up at the Irish National Stud in County Kildare, where his skeleton is a memento mori for all the impatient stallions outside.
Rath Cross is a memorial to "The Battle of Ashbourne:" it's north along R135 by the retail park, junction with Ballymadun Rd. As part of the Easter Rising of 1916, the "Fingal Volunteers" stormed the town police barracks. There was a shoot-out over several hours as police and rebel reinforcements poured in. Two rebels were killed but the barracks was captured and held for a couple of days; they surrendered when the main Rising in Dublin was crushed. The local rebels were sentenced to death but this was commuted to penal servitude.
53.514-6.5391 St Seachnall's Church is all that's left of the medieval abbey at Dunshaughlin. It's on R147, with the present Church of Ireland church (built 1813) just north.
