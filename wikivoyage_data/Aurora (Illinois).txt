Aurora is the second-largest city in the U.S. state of Illinois, located about 35 miles west of Chicago. It's at the very edge of Chicagoland and, situated on the Fox River, has many opportunities for urban, suburban, and rural recreation. Often overlooked, Aurora in fact has many surprisingly interesting attractions and a downtown unlike that of a typical suburb. It is probably best known for being the setting of the "Wayne's World" movies.

As is commonplace in the suburbs, the easiest way to get around is by car.  However, Pace Bus also has extensive service in Aurora (it being Illinois's second largest city, after all), and multiple routes connect the Aurora Transportation Center with the rest of the city as well as Elgin, Geneva, St. Charles, Batavia, and Naperville.
