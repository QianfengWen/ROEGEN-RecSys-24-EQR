Understand[edit]

Tarrytown shares a zip code and a school system with adjacent Sleepy Hollow, but the two villages are separate municipalities.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Westchester County Airport (HPN IATA also known as White Plains Airport). The closest airport, about 20 minutes drive. Rental cars are available.
Stewart International Airport (SWF IATA). Another alternative to the congestion of the 3 major airports. Allegiant Air, American Eagle, and JetBlue operate flights from Florida and Philadelphia (Mar 2021).
Newark Liberty International Airport, Newark, New Jersey, John F. Kennedy International Airport, and LaGuardia Airport: The three major international airports in the New York City area offer service to just about anywhere. Westchester-based taxi and livery cars offer regular service to and from the three internationals from most areas of the county. New York City yellow cabs will take to you Westchester in a pinch (they are required to by law), but the fares can be exorbitant and many cabbies don't know the way.  Ride apps like Uber and Lyft are legal between NYC and Westchester in either direction and are generally cheaper and more reliable than taking a yellow cab. Ask if your hotel offers shuttle service.
By car[edit]
Tarrytown is easily accessible from the northeastern United States of America via interstate highways such as the New England and New Jersey Turnpikes (I-95) and the New York State Thruway system. The I-87 portion of the Thruway connecting Albany and New York City crosses the Hudson River at Tarrytown on the Tappan Zee bridge as does I-287, which connects with I-95 to the east. The Saw Mill River Parkway, which runs along the village's eastern flank, connects with the Taconic State Parkway to the north (to Albany and the I-90 east-west portion of the Thruway system) and the Henry Hudson Parkway into New York City.
By train[edit]
Metro-North Railroad - Hudson line. Express service between Tarrytown station and New York City's Grand Central Terminal is about 35 minutes. Local service is available between other Metro-North commuter stations. Local taxis swarm the station at the approach of a train (if you are accustomed to New York City yellow cabs with their single fare restriction and meters, be aware that taxis in Tarrytown can take multiple passengers and charge flat rates by zone). On-board train fares are subject to a stiff surcharge, so buy your tickets at the station or at the vending machines located on the southbound (to New York) platform or between the northbound (from New York) platform and the station building.
Amtrak.  Long distance connections are available in New York City's Penn Station and at Metro-North's Yonkers and Croton-Harmon stations. Amtrak connections available to VIA Rail Canada.

Get around[edit]
Map of Tarrytown

Getting around Tarrytown depends on whether or not you are staying in local lodging and what you want to see.  If arriving by train from New York City and planning on only a day trip within the central business district, you can easily get about on foot or by local taxi. NY Waterway tours have their own bus transportation between destinations. If you stay in local hotels or motels, your own vehicle or taxi service are something of a necessity. Broadway (aka Route 9) is the main north to south route through the village. It is divided into North Broadway and South Broadway by Main Street.

The grounds reflect Washington Irving's romantic view of art, nature, and history. He arranged garden paths, trees and shrubs, vistas, and water features to appear natural, and planted an exotic wisteria vine (still growing) to envelope the house. Irving's contemporaries extensively described and illustrated Sunnyside during his lifetime. Since Sunnyside and many of its furnishings remained in the family, so it is an authentic experience of mid-19th century life in America. adult $12, seniors 65+ $10, children 3-17 $6.
