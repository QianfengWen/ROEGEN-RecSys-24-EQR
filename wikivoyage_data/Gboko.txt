By bus[edit]
Commercial bus
Within the township, the role of buses as a public transport cannot be underplayed. They provide services that aid the movement of people and their goods. These buses have conductors who accompany the drivers on trips around town. Sometimes these conductors might use vulgar language so do not be surprised if they put up an attitude. 

By bike[edit]
Motor cyclists also popularly called Okada. Cyclists can take you to your destination faster but they are infamous for over speeding due to their impatience. They are also notorious for illegal U-turns and extortions especially at night. The FRSC (Federal Road Security Commission) have tried to curb this issue by introducing stern regulations against road use and related offenses.

Bike rider with passenger
Some cyclist and drivers are rude, lack discipline and respect so avoid having squabbles with them. The number one rule is that, always agree on the price and make sure they know exactly where you are going. Bike ride is particularly useful if you are running late and cannot afford to wait for taxi.

Connect[edit]
Most places have 2G/3G/4G mobile network coverage. Some hotels even offer free wifi. Service can be disrupted the farther you go away from the town center, and you might occasionally experience network outage for all or some of the mobile phone service providers in those remote areas of the town. And different networks tend to be more stable and reliable in different locations of the town at different times. 
if you are planning a visit to this town, you should consider having multiple SIM cards preferably for all the mobile service providers, since you can't tell which will be more stable and reliable at a time in your location during your visit. And if you will risk not having any of them, you might be better off not risking the MTN network, because, from indications, it seem to perform well than the others, though its rates may be high and its offers and services might be stringent, but you are less likely to be concerned of erratic voice and data connection compared to others.
Of the service providers is Glo (or Globacom), which boasts of fast network speed for internet browsing activities, but that might not be enjoyable in some locations in Gboko. Airtel is fairly satisfactory for all you might need to connect to the world, including rates and network stability. And 9mobile usually also performs well in internet browsing speed but not without locational limitations.
