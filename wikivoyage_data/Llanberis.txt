Llanberis is in North Wales, 7 miles away from Caernarfon.


Get in[edit]
By Bus[edit]
Llanberis is easily reachable by bus. Sherpa busses (prefixed S) from Betws-y-Coed is the most reliable possibility, but Sherpa bus from Porthmadog or local busses from Caernarfon are other alternatives.

By Train[edit]
Bangor is the closest station to Llanberis. Hiring a cab from there costs around £20. Caernarfon is closer, but the only train to Caernarfon is the narrow-gauge heritage railway Welsh Highland Railway from Porthmadog - and if in Porthmadog it is easier to catch a direct bus to Llanberis.

By car[edit]
Llanberis is on the A4086 Caernarfon to Betwys-y-Coed road. The B4547 branches off just west of town for Bangor, Conwy and the A55.
There are large car parks all along the A4086 road inside Llanberis, with the price rising steadily as you get closer to the Snowdon Mountain Railway. The closest car park costs £6 per day (and no discount for shorter stay), 100m up the road it is £4 per day and further west beyond the Electric Mountain Visitor Center it is £2 per day.

Get around[edit]
On foot easily. You may also want to take a ride on Llanberis Lake Railway (£6.00)

53.118458-4.1032233 Dinorwig Power Station, Llanberis, Gwynedd, LL55 4TY, ☏ +44 1286 870166, info@fhc.co.uk. At Llanberis — Visitor centre is closed for refurbishment until some time in 2020.  Tours of this power station are, despite the somewhat outdated multimedia presentation at the beginning, a must see. A huge cavern was carved out of the mountain and six turbines installed which sit in tunnels between two lakes, one high up, the other at close to sea level. When Britain switches on the kettle during the advert break in Coronation Street, water is released from the upper lake and the most expensive electricity in Britain is generated to cope with demand. Later at night, when demand is low and electricity is cheaper, water is pumped back up to the top lake from the lower one. Wheelchairs are exceptionally well catered-for, and the cafe is not a bad place to stop in whilst waiting for the tour to begin.
