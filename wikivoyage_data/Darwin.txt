The Darwin Waterfront at night
Darwin, a small yet cosmopolitan city, is the tropical capital city of the Northern Territory. People from more than 50 nations make up its population of 147,255 (2019). It sits on the Northern Territory coast, with the Timor Sea (a branch of the Indian Ocean) to the west, and the Arafura Sea to the north in Indonesian waters. Darwin is the only city of its size to have a north coast in mainland Australia, with the rest being small settlements.

A Map of Darwin
Darwin has a relaxed lifestyle and unique multiculturalism, where people from over 50 different cultures live and work side by side. The regular Asian-style markets form an intrinsic part of the everyday Darwin landscape, for local residents see food, music, language, and culture from just about every Asian nation, alongside "crocodile hunters", local Aboriginal artists, musicians of every genre, sports fishing operators, sunset sails, and families with children playing on the beach. Darwin's unique cosmopolitan makeup has been recognised as an "multicultural icon of national significance" by the Australian National Trust.
Darwin's tropical climate has two major seasons: the "dry", from about May to October, and the "wet", from November to April. There is also the "build up", the time from the end of the dry, leading into the wet when the humidity rises, but the rain doesn't fall.  The arrival of the wet is always a welcome break from the buildup.
Major cyclones have occurred approximately once every three decades. Much of the city was destroyed by Cyclone Tracy in 1974. More recent cyclones have not been as dangerous, and building codes and emergency procedures have improved since then.
Darwin is also the only Australian capital city to have come under substantial attack during a war.  On 19 February 1942, Japanese planes made two major air raids on Darwin from the aircraft carrier fleet that had attacked Pearl Harbor less than 3 months earlier. These were the first of 64 air attacks sustained by the city during World War II, the last being on 12 November 1943. (Other areas in northern Queensland and northern Western Australia were also bombed by Japanese aircraft while Sydney Harbour had some submarine attacks.)

History[edit]
Darwin was first named in 1839 by John Lort Stokes during the third voyage of the Beagle.  It was named after his former shipmate and famous naturalist Charles Darwin. Darwin's development was accelerated by the discovery of gold at Pine Creek, about 200 km south of the city in 1871. After the gold rush Darwin's growth slowed mainly due to the harsh, tropical climate, distance and poor communications with other Australian cities. The Second World War put Darwin back on the map when the town became an important base for Allied action against the Japanese in the Pacific. The road south to the railhead at Alice Springs was surfaced, putting the city in direct contact with the rest of the country. Modern Darwin is one of Australia's most cosmopolitan cities, more open to Asia than perhaps any other Australian city. It plays an important role as the door to Australia's northern region. Natural wonders such as Kakadu, Katherine Gorge, and Litchfield are all within driving distance from the city and still contain near pre-colonial populations of crocodiles, goannas, snakes and wallabies.
Today Darwin is a fast-growing regional centre that has unique history, culture and adventure.

Climate[edit]
The Top End, which includes Darwin, Katherine, Kakadu National Park and Arnhem Land, has a tropical climate. Darwin has an average temperature of 32°C (90°F) all year, with varying humidity.
Darwin is climatically perfect to visit from May to October.  There is no need to check the weather forecast as it is nearly always 31°C (89°F) and sunny during the day, with cooler nights.
November and December is the time the build up, or pre-monsoon season, begins and humidity levels start to rise. The summer rains bring the natural landscape to life and deliver the picturesque storms and sunsets the Northern Territory is renowned for.   Some people enjoy this aspect of the wet, with the rivers and waterfalls in full glory, and the landscape greener. But its generally not a pleasant time to visit Darwin.

There are transfers in Adelaide from Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. You can bring your car from either Adelaide or Perth. The train line to Darwin was only completed in 2004, and was designed primarily for freight.

Stay safe[edit]
In an emergency dial 000 for ambulance, fire or police.

Dial 000 and request the service that you need
Remember to remain as calm as you can and give a clear description of your location
Speak clearly and give the details as requested
Take care at night. While the tourist areas around the waterfront are pretty friendly, there are some rough areas in the city proper. Darwin has consistently been ranked as Australia's most dangerous city, with a crime rate similar to Tripoli (according to Numbeo). Avoid walking alone at night; the most common types of crime are break-ins, car vandalism, theft, knife crime, and pickpocketing, much of which is alcohol-fueled. Take extra care of your belongings and around bottle shops – don't leave any valuables unattended.
Royal Darwin Hospital is one of five public hospitals located within the Northern Territory. The hospital is on Rocklands Drive, Tiwi, on the northern side of Darwin. As you approach Casuarina, blue signs give directions to the hospital, but it is better to familiarise yourself with the Hospital's location before you may need to find it. Darwin Private hospital is situated across the road. Extensive delays may occur for treatment of anything other than very serious illness or trauma injuries at the Accident and emergency section of Royal Darwin Hospital. Be prepared for a long wait, especially on weekends.
Drink plenty of water; at least 1 litre of water for every hour of walking in very warm weather. Ensure you have an adequate fitness level for the bushwalk you plan to undertake.
Avoid walking in the hottest part of the day or walking alone, register with the overnight bushwalking register if you plan an extended walk. Carry a map of the area you're walking/camping in and know how to read it, tell someone your plan and when you expect to return. Carry a mobile telephone if in a potential coverage area but do not expect coverage anywhere other than very built up areas with good line of sight to a transponder tower. Under no circumstances should you rely on mobile telephony for essential communications unless within the city area. Ensure you are using a mobile telephone service that provides usable coverage in the Northern Territory. Not all of the service providers give even faintly adequate coverage throughout the Darwin area and much less so outside the immediate city and suburban area. Please see the Driving in Australia article for some useful tips that apply to travelling by road in the Northern Territory. Even locations very nearby to the city can present serious challenges and concerns unless properly skilled and prepared for the conditions. The effects of hot weather and exhaustion can set in quickly if you encounter difficulties. Even if you are successful in raising an alarm for assistance it may still be a long wait before it can arrive.
Malaria does not exist in or around Darwin and during the peak of the dry season (the preferred travelling season) Mosquitoes are still present though in areas where there is water. Bring a DEET based repellent, as this will also work on sandflys.  Risks arising from Dengue fever should be considered.
The dreaded Box Jellyfish is a potentially deadly beach hazard between the months of October and May, but less so during the peak travel season. When swimming at local beaches, even in the 'safe' season of June to September, bring vinegar and pour it over the wound if stung. Transport to hospital is a must as the venom of the Box Jellyfish can be deadly - remember CPR.
Crocodiles are very common in waterways, but are only occasionally found on public beaches. The local newspaper loves a good crocodile story. If a crocodile is nearby to a public place it will often feature in the local media.
Never camp near the water's edge.
There are safe swimming areas in and around Darwin, but caution should always be practiced- if you are even the slightest bit unsure about an area do not swim. A 6 m crocodile can lie completely invisible for more than 2h in less than 1 m (3 ft) of water, so unless an area has been deemed safe by the local wildlife management, you'd be best to leave it alone. A check with the NT Parks and Wildlife Service will reveal which parks are open, and which are open with swimming prohibited.
Snakes inhabit most areas of the Territory, so be cautious when walking through long grass

Connect[edit]
Internet[edit]
Many hotels, motels and backpacker lodges have Internet access with special deals for guests. Some accommodation providers have free internet for guests.
Local roadhouses increasingly offer internet kiosks. Darwin libraries offer Internet access terminals for $3 per half hour for visitors, and there are variety of Internet cafes around the city.
Free Wi-Fi is available at Darwin Airport, Smith Street Mall, CBD library, Casuarina Shopping Centre as well as McDonalds restaurants (in the CBD, Stuart Park, and Bagot Road near the Airport).

Go next[edit]
Indigenous culture in Tiwi Island
Darwin is the gateway to the rest of the Northern Territory. It provides a base for day trips to explore the 'Top End' of the Territory.

Kakadu National Park is the second largest national park in Australia. It contains one of the highest concentrated areas of Aboriginal rock art sites in the world, the most famous being at Nourlangie Rock and Ubirr.
Katherine is where the outback meets the tropics. Situated about 300 km south of Darwin. The township is situated on the banks of the Katherine River, which flows down from the world-renowned Katherine Gorge (Nitmiluk National Park). There are incredibly diverse landscapes and unique ecosystems set the scene for outback adventure activities like fishing, canoeing, bushwalking, birdwatching, camping and four-wheel driving.
Litchfield National Park is a 1,500 km² park situated an hour-and-a-half's drive from Darwin. The Park includes a lot of the Tabletop Range, which is a wide sandstone plateau mostly surrounded by cliffs. Stay for the day or for the more adventurous stay for two or three days. The monsoon season lasts from October to May, the rest of the year is a good time to visit as the waterfalls flow more gently, making the waterholes perfect spots for a cool dip. Main attractions include permanent spring fed waterfalls (Florence, Tolmer and Wangi), cascades at Buley Rockhole, magnetic termite mounds, and a wildlife cruise along the majestic Reynolds River.
Tiwi Islands are a small archipelago 100 km north of Darwin, famous for Aboriginal culture and art.  Only a 20min flight away, but only accessible via organized tour.
