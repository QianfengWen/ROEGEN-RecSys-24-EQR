Understand[edit]
Batalha monastery

Batalha (buh-TAH-lyuh, /bɐ.ˈta.ʎɐ/) municipality has 15,553 residents (2021 preliminary).
In 1385, the Aljubarrota battle would end the ongoing war for Portugal's crown in favour of Portuguese born Mestre de Avis, soon to be D. João I. In appreciation to the Virgin Mary having answered his prayers, the winner had a monastery erected near the location of the battle. The settlement that was created to support the building of the monastery developed into the current town of Batalha.
