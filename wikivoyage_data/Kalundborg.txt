Kalundborg is a city in Zealand, Denmark. You might come here for the medieval city remains, for the spectacular nature of Røsnæs, or because Kalundborg could be on your way from Copenhagen via Samsø to Aarhus.


Understand[edit]
The centre of Kalundborg.
Kalundborg is on western Zealand inside Kalundborg Fjord between the two peninsulas Røsnæs and Asnæs.  The town has around 17,000 inhabitants.

History[edit]
Kalundborg was established in 1170 by Esbern Snare who built the West Castle (only ruins remain) just west of the medieval High Town.  During the 13th century, the five-spired Church of Our Lady as well as the medieval High Town were established.  The town was important during the next couple of centuries as significant part of the Danish central administration was moved to here.  During the 16th and 17th centuries, the downtown was established at the location of the present day major shopping and commercial street, Kordilgade.
