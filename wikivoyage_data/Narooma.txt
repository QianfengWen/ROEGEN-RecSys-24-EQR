Stay safe[edit]
The bar crossing that boats must take exiting Narooma is the most dangerous in New South Wales. Take extreme care if skippering a boat across it, and you should have experience handling a boat in high swell. It should only be crossed during the incoming tide. You must contact the Coastal Patrol on channel 86 prior to beginning the crossing. When leaving, circle inside the channel a couple of times to familiarize yourself with conditions and then cross diagonally from the northern side of the bar. Once you begin crossing do not turn around and attempt to abort the crossing. All passengers in a boat crossing the bar must be wearing life jackets throughout the crossing, both by law and in the interests of safety.
Returning boats should also come in on the incoming tide and take the reverse of the path they took going out (that is, diagonally from south to north). Contact Coastal Patrol before the crossing and afterwards to confirm that you crossed safely. If conditions in the bar have deteriorated and you cannot re-enter, you will need to go south to Bermagui's harbor.
