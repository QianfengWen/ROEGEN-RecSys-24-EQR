Carluke is a town five miles north of Lanark with a population in 2020 of 13,810. Carluke is mostly a commuter town for the Glasgow-Motherwell industrial corridor. 


Understand[edit]
Carluke in Gaelic is Cathair MoLuaig - "car" means a strong point, as in Cardiff or Carlisle. Carluke is not an obvious defensive position, but a group of monks venerating St MoLuaig (better known as St Malo) thought it a healthy spot and shifted their church here from across the Clyde. Their new home was on a plateau above the river, which has cut deep into the sandstone bedrock. It was a draughty place suitable for windmills, but the power of these was limited and erratic, and weaving was by hand looms. Then steam power arrived in the 19th century, with the High Mill converting from wind to steam in 1830, and Carluke's industries took off. There was corn milling, and Lanarkshire-mined coal fired kilns for bricks and glass. Apples, pears and soft fruit also grow around town, and tomatoes were cultivated once glasshouses became practical. But all these businesses were small-scale and succumbed to competition. It used to be part of Lanarkshire and is now within Clydesdale.
