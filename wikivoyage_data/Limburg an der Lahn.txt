The Limburger Dom, also known as Georgsdom, is situated above the medieval town center just beside Limburg castle. Due to its exposed position the Dom is a widely visible landmark. Its basilica is a architectural masterpiece of the late romantic era, consisting of a three-aisled basilica with late romantic and early Gothic elements. The Dom has 7 towers. Constructions for a first church at that place began in 910 AD, although construction works for the Dom only started between 1175 AD and 1200 AD. The Dom's consecration was held in 1235 AD by the Arch Bishop of Trier, Theoderich von Wied. €3.
