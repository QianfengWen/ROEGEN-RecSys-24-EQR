History[edit]
It was named for Uxbridge, England, a name which was derived from "Wixan's Bridge".
The first settlers in the area were Quakers who started arriving in 1806 from the Catawissa area of Pennsylvania. The community's oldest building, the Uxbridge Friends Meeting House, was built in 1820 and overlooks the town from Quaker Hill, a kilometre to the west.
The first passenger-carrying narrow-gauge railway in North America, the Toronto and Nipissing Railway arrived in Uxbridge in June 1871, and for over a decade Uxbridge was the headquarters of the railway.

Map of Uxbridge (Ontario)
Travel through the town may be done on foot, but the increasingly sprawling nature of the town necessitates car travel.  Durham Transit provides intermittent shuttle service between Uxbridge, Port Perry, and north Oshawa.  GO buses connect Uxbridge to Stouffville, allowing access to Toronto.  Some limited taxi service is available.  The traditional 'downtown' is demarcated by an area known as the Four Corners, which delineates the intersection of Hwy. 47 (Toronto Street) with Durham Road 8 (Brock Street).
