West Kilbride is a town in Ayrshire on the Clyde coast of southwest Scotland, with a population of 4860 in 2020. It has sought to distinguish itself as an arts & crafts centre, with partial success, and to distance itself from the industrial complex of Hunterston just north.  Hunterston is well known for its nuclear reactors.


Understand[edit]
It was traditionally a weaving, potato-growing and sheep-farming town, expanding when the railway arrived in 1878, to grow into nearby Seamill and Portencross. 
There a fabulous Celtic brooch was found, dating to 700 AD and now in the National Museum in Edinburgh.
Hunterston B nuclear power station, run by EDF, stopped generating in 2022, and us being decommissioned. Tours no longer seem to get available.  EDF has seven other nuclear plants in the UK which can be visited: at Torness East Lothian, Dungeness B in Kent, West Burton B near Retford Notts, Heysham Lancs, Hinckley Point Somerset, Hartlepool, and Sizewell B in Suffolk.

By plane: Glasgow Airport (GLA IATA) has the best choice of flights. Take the airport bus to Glasgow city centre then train or bus as below. Prestwick (PIK IATA) is closer but only has Ryanair flights from the Mediterranean.
By train: Trains run hourly from Glasgow Central, taking 50 min via Paisley, Kilwinning and Ardrossan, and continuing north to Fairlie and Largs. Change at Kilwinning for trains from Ayr, Prestwick, Troon and Irvine.
The 55.6962-4.85181 railway station is just east of town centre. It's just a platform halt with ticket machines but no staffed office or toilets. There is step-free access to the only platform. 
By bus: buses pass through West Kilbride every 30 min or so on their way north to Largs (10 min) and Greenock (60 min), and south to Ardrossan (20 min), Irvine (40 min) and Ayr (60 min). From central Glasgow (Buchanan station) travel either via Ardrossan or Greenock: it's usually quicker via Ardrossan but ask at the ticket office for your best connection.
By road follow A78 the coastal main highway.
