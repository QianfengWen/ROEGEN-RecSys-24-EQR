Aquia Harbour is in Stafford County, Virginia. It might be incorrect to call it a major tourist destination. If you happen to be here, however, you could take a gander at the 1755 Aquia Church, a National Historic Landmark. There is also a yacht harbor, a golf course, country club, horse stables, and 8 parks.

Map of Aquia Harbour

Aquia Harbor is at Exit 143A next to I-95.

See[edit]
 Aquia Church, 2938 Jefferson Davis Hwy (US-1), ☏ +1 540 659-4007. Built by the Church of England in 1755, Aquia Church retains an active Episcopal congregation. It was designed on a relatively rare "Greek Cross plan", less common for colonial churches. Tours are offered M-F 8AM-4PM, but it is best to call ahead to arrange one, so they know you are coming. 
Do[edit]
Buy[edit]
Eat[edit]
 El Gran Charro, 2834 Jefferson Davis Hwy, ☏ +1 540 720-7770. Authentic, cheap Mexican in this little restaurant is actually a good reason to leave the highway for a bit, skipping the bland heart-destroying fast food chains. $4-10. 
Drink[edit]
Sleep[edit]
 Best Western, 2868 Jefferson Davis Hwy, ☏ +1 703 780-7234. A basic two diamond side-of-the-highway hotel. $76.50 for a single or double room (rates as of January 2016).

Go next[edit]
Just north along I-95 is Quantico, with its excellent National Marine Corps Museum. Stafford is the next town south, of little interest, before reaching legitimately interesting Fredericksburg.
