Gerringong is a town in the Illawarra region, south of Kiama, New South Wales.


Understand[edit]
Gerringong is the first coastal town south of Kiama, and considerably quieter than it's northern neighbour.  It completely surrounds the beach suburb of Werri Beach.  Gerringong derives from the Aboriginal word meaning "fearful place".

Get in[edit]
-34.74482150.817561 Gerringong Station is the next station on the train line south from Kiama.  You'll have to change trains at Kiama to the diesel service, that only connects with every second Kiama train.  Alternatively, the town is a very short deviation from the Princes Hwy heading south. Be warned, the pressure changes that come with the train entering the several tunnels between Kiama and Gerringong at 115 km/h can irritate young children.

Get around[edit]

It is a couple of kilometre walk down the hill from the station to the beach.  There is a shared (bicycle/pedestrian) pathway on the footpath adjacent to the road down the hill, but usually the roads a quiet enough to make them a safer alternative for bicycles.

Do[edit]
The town has two beaches, -34.7422150.8331 Gerringong Beach and -34.7293150.8382 Werri Beach. Neither of them are exceptional but great if you want to swim in peace. If you are taking the train, Gerringong Beach is closer to the station.
The town is also the southern endpoint of the Kiama Coast Walk.
