Pokhara is the second largest city in Nepal with about 520,000 people in 2021. It is the starting point for most of the treks in the Annapurna area. It is a very popular location with most people staying around the beautiful Fewa Lake. Dozens of hotels and restaurants are sprouting like mushrooms everywhere, and today it is much easier to find modern amenities not common to other locations in Nepal, but Pokhara is losing its small town charm and the lakeside now feels more like Khao San Road (with all the usual: yoga, reiki, massages by blind people, overpriced souvenirs and disingenuous locals).

The Annapurna Mountains above Pokhara's Phewa Tal lakeshore.
Pokhara is still beautiful and many great and genuine people can be found, but it takes some work on the traveler's side. If you intend to stay on the lakeside road, para-glide, and trek to Annapurna, you will be getting a very inauthentic version of Nepal. If you make an effort to get out of the tourist areas, you will find amazing scenery, great people, and unforgettable experiences.


Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
From Kathmandu[edit]
Tourist buses (Rs700-800, 6-7 hr) and crowded local buses/microbuses (Rs400-600, 6-7 hr) travel the 200-km journey between Kathmandu and Pokhara almost every 15 minutes from 07:30 until late afternoon. Night buses are available, but the ride is painful. Greenline operates a convenient bus every morning between the popular tourist areas of Thamel in Kathmandu and Lakeside in Pokhara (US$20, lunch included). 
Swift operates comfortable tourist buses for US$15 per ride. The bus runs twice daily, leaving in the morning and in the evening. Swift buses offer comfortable, reclining and extra-wide seats (three per row).
The road is winding with many switchbacks but offers wonderful views of hills and rural Nepalese lifestyle. The drivers will generally not drive too fast but some will calmly weave in and out of the stream of opposing traffic and slam on the brakes when a stop is required, making for a scary ride if you look out the front window. During the rainy season, there may be problems with the roads, and flying may make more sense.
If your bus leaves you at the "old bus station" near the old airport, just take a city bus from the road to lakeside (Rs20).
Update May 2023: There's construction on a new road between Kathmandu and Pokhara and many parts of the route have been broken up or narrowed to only one lane, making for traffic snarls and an extremely bumpy ride. Plan on spend at least 8 and possibly 9 or 10 hours on the road now, with frequent nauseating and bone-rattling sections. Air travel may be more advisable while construction is underway. Locals say it's been going on for a year, and estimate construction will likely go on for another two.

From Sunauli and the Indian Border[edit]
Buses are available from the border town of Sunauli (Rs500-700, 10 hours). If you can travel to the nearby town of Butwal, you will have more options for travelling to Pokhara. A 12-seater vehicle will cost around Rs5500 from Butwal to Pokhara.

From Siddharth nagar rail station to Kakrahwa border - Kakrahwa border to Bhairahawa Bus Park - Pokhara[edit]
Shared Tempo Rs 50 Indian on shared tempo/ bus from Siddharth Nagar rail station to Kakrahwa border approx 50 mins if no jam on road (Last bus around 6 pm all via Lumbini). Kakrahwa border to Bhairahawa Rs 130/- Nepali by bus. Rs 25/- per person by shared auto to Bhairahawa Bus Park. Bus park to Lumbini Rs 750/- Nepali Non AC bus. (Added this route on Sept 2023 after travel)

By plane[edit]
From Kathmandu[edit]
Yeti Airlines, Buddha Air and Air Viva are reputable airlines that operate regular flights (US$102-106, 40 minutes) that can be purchased online and at the last minute. The flights offer the benefit of a bird's eye view of the countryside and of the panoramic mountains themselves. Flights are almost always delayed and afternoon flights run the risk of cancellation as delays from the morning compound.
A taxi from the Pokhara airport to Lakeside should cost Rs250 if negotiated in advance, but the city bus passes the airport and costs Rs20.

Get around[edit]
Map of Pokhara
By foot[edit]
Pokhara is a mid-sized city and can be traversed on cycle or car or bike. Walking is necessary to get to places where vehicles or bicycles can't reach.

By bus[edit]
Buses and minivans operate on most of the popular routes. These are crowded and uncomfortable but the fare is cheap and student discounts may be offered. Fare is Rs20–40 per way (as of March 2023).

By taxi[edit]
Comfortable taxis are available to be hired. You may also use InDrive app to hail a taxi or motorbike.

By bicycle[edit]
Bicycles can be hired in a lot of shops in Lakeside (Rs300-2,000/day). Make sure the seat is not too hard, and try realigning the seat if it is set uphill way, instead of sloping down.

By motorbike or scooter[edit]
It is also possible to hire a scooter or a motorbike in Lakeside (from Rs550/day). You will have to buy petrol (Rs120/litre). It is not possible to reach Sarangkot or the World Peace Pagoda with an automatic motorbike or scooter due to the steep uphill road, so get a manual gear model if you intend to travel to those places.

Lakes and waterfalls[edit]
 Phewa/Fewa Lake (Phewa/Fewa Tal) (just west of Pokhara). One of Nepal's most beautiful spots, Phewa Tal is surrounded by a combination of monkey-filled forests and high white peaks. The reflections in the mirror-like water in the early mornings are impressive. Hire a boat and row yourself across the lake, or hire a local to do it for you – there are some fine times to be had on this lake, even in the middle of the night. 
28.1702484.097421 Begnas Lake (Begnas Tal) (13.3 km south-east from Pokhara, along the Prithvi Rajmarg road). Out of town and away from the hustle, Begnas Tal is quiet, clean and peaceful. There are a few basic hotels nearby and the odd refreshment shop. A very nice Vipassana Meditation Retreat is also here, one of many around the world. The walk along the road leading to Begnas Tal is fascinating; the seasonal rhythms of daily life in the country make great images. (updated Sep 2016)
28.173984.09732 Rupa Lake (Rupa Tal) (15 km south-east from Pokhara, along the Prithvi Rajmarg road). One of the more remote lakes in Pokhara with limited accessibility and hence more serene and unspoiled compared to the other lakes. A must visit for any nature lover. (updated Oct 2016)
 Dipang Lake (Dipang Tal) (12.7 km south-east from Pokhara, along the Prithvi Rajmarg road). Beautiful lake where you can find wild lotus and wild swan. It is about 25 minutes walk from Sisuwa, the city centre of Lekhnath municipality. (updated Sep 2016)
28.1983.963 Devi's Falls (Patale Chhango). Spectacular, especially after heavy rains. Devi's Falls plunge into a cave and disappear into the earth. The name is from a Swiss couple who were washed away (or fell in) and drowned. Rs25.   
Viewpoints[edit]
28.2012583.944974 World Peace Pagoda (Shanti Stupa). Daily 05:00–18:00. Opened in 1999 on top of a hill just south of Phewa Tal, the Stupa offers great views of the Annapurna Mountains, including Fishtail, Dhaulagiri, Annapurna South, and Annapurna III. This is a great place to watch the sunrise or sunset over Pokhara. The easiest way to get there is to take a taxi to the base of the Peace Pagoda (Rs1000 return, including waiting). If you want to go on foot, you must first get to the southern side of Phewa Tal, either by walking around the lake, getting a taxi or rowing across the lake. Then take a very steep hike through the forest (watch out for leeches during the monsoon) or from the road that passes Devi's Fall. Free.   (updated Mar 2023)
28.2449783.948765 Sarangkot. Cable car: 05:00–07:00, 07:30–11:30, 12:30–17:30. The perfect pre-trek warm-up. Head up Sarangkot, and be prepared as it's steep and hard work. You can rent a motor bike or use the cable car to go to the top. The road is rough, but traversable. Great views, spectacular images and a great way to get a taste of what it's like to be trekking.The Sarangkot south slope trail is a challenging run/polewalk workout. Go north through Lakeside about 5 km, through Kare until cable car bottom station. Follow the road up the hill and don't try to ride a motorbike or bike up this road, too rocky. Shortly after you've crossed under the cable cars, the trail goes off the road to the left (there's a sign, too) and soon the gruelling stone steps begin. Follow the steps all the way, notice the arrows carved into stones where confusing, but stay on stone step trail for the shortest way or use the road for a longer, less steep alternative. Morning views are best. This trail takes at least 1 hour from the bottom. Knee jarring descent takes 40 min, or an easy ride with the cable car (notice their many breaks during the day). Cable car: Rs660 single trip, Rs1185 return. (updated Mar 2023)
28.2380684.01366 Kahun Dharahara. Kahun is the second nearest hill close to the city. At the top of Kahun there's a view tower locally called "Kahun Dharhara". You can get there by bus, motorbike or cycle. Hiking also shouldn't take more than 2½ hours to reach there from Ranipauwa. A spectacular view of Annapurna range can be seen straight from the tower. The Pokhara valley can also be observed. The environment is peaceful at the top, you should shop and carry required items either from the valley itself or from the local shop in Kahun as there are no shops, cafe or hotels available at Kahun Dharhara. (updated Mar 2023)
28.2877283.975177 Dhiki Danda. One of the hills that provides a closer view to the Himalayas. Located on the north of Mahendra Cave, one can reach it by hiking 2-3 hours all the way through Armala. The trail is about 5 km from Mahendra Cave. Beautiful scenery can be observed form the top. (updated Mar 2023)

28.2183283.958661 Parahawking/Vulture Restaurant. The population of certain species of vulture has collapsed in many parts of Asia due to vultures eating dead cows that have been injected with a drug that helps the cows in old age but poisons the vultures when they eat them after their die. A charity has established a hospice for cows coming to the end of their lives. They look after the cows but ensure they don't have any of the drug that kills the vultures. When the cows eventually die they are given as food to the vultures. Trips are arranged to view such early morning vulture feasts. To find out more visit Blue Sky Paragliding. (updated Sep 2016)

Mountain Biking. Consider these fun bike rides:
Around Phewa Lake
Sarankot/Naudada/Hemja loop — 3 hours hard from Lakeside is a fast time. Go towards downtown (Mahendrapul) from Lakeside, turn north at "Zero Kilometre" along the main road to Baglung. Be careful as it's crowded. Ride about 5–6 km north, slowly up, past the nasty old bus park, to the Sarankot Road junction, turn left (west). The climb time starts at the fork 50 m further. Follow paved road up incredibly steep climb, 1st gear almost all the way. Good pavement mostly, climb zigs past houses and ends at a small village on a saddle. It takes around 40 min from bottom. From here you can park bike and hike up old ridge trail to Sarankot, but for this loop continue west along rocky jeep road along mountains south slopes, past parasail place and onwards, rolling ascent to Kalipani village and after and hour or so jeep road hits the "hi-way" at Naudada village on ridgetop. From here good pavement zigs steep down to valley bottom, then its a long gradual descent to Hemja village, and back into Pokhara.
Dobindy Pass ride — A fun up and back hillclimb to a pass on pavement southwest of Damside. Take paved road south from Damside to Birota area then turn right (west) along main road, the "hi-way to Syangja and Tansen, gradually down towards Devi's Falls, continue west to the Chorepatan area to base of climb. The steep bends begin here, road climbs steadily, though not too steep, along south side of Peace Pagoda ridge, up to a few villages, then after a short steep descent into a forest for last climb up to the pass at Dobindy village. At least, it'll take just under an hour from Lakeside. From here you can continue west through scenic rolling country towards Syangja town, but it's usually possible to zip back down to hotel in about 35 min. Beware; this road is getting more crowded, and sometimes with lots of buses & trucks in the wrong lane.
Tibetan Refugee Camp — go for a bike ride down to the airport way, on the way to the Tibetan settlement where there is a nice little monastery, a school, and refugee-made jewellery and craft stalls. Be prepared to ride all the way uphill on the return trip to Lake area and it is wise to take a rest halfway if you want to avoid suffering from cramps and weariness the following day, from the long ride.

Education[edit]
Cooking classes - Stay on a farm and learn to cook Dal Baht from scratch!
Reiki, yoga, meditation & massage[edit]
Pokhara is Nepal's top yoga destination and there are over a dozen yoga retreats. Many of these retreats also offer massage, reiki and water/honey therapy. Some also organise 1- to 20-day treks that combine hiking with classes in yoga and meditation.

28.224783.95962 Purna Yoga Retreat Centre, Sedi Bagar, Lakeside, Pokhara (10 min walk uphill from north Lakeside, behind and above Castle Resort), ☏ +9779841436877, info@purnayoga.com.np.

Live music[edit]
With the ever-present backpacker atmosphere, there is no shortage of live music. Lakeside is certainly the best place to find it. A walk along the shore reveals many little pubs and bars with bands and overpriced libations. Often there are busking musicians who can actually be quite talented and add real local flavour.
Most clubs are sausage-fests of local guys or "girl dance" bars where the only women are the staff, paid to 'dance' on the stage and then come ask male patrons to buy them drinks (with no possibility of anything else).

Catwalk Club Beside the amusement park in North Lakeside, seems to be the only club that actually has female patrons. It is only "electronic" music (EDM), with local or Nepali DJs playing every night. A very impressive theatre, and totally unexpected in a place like Pokhara, with a really powerful sound-system, and ludicrously expensive (but effective) drinks (over 1000 Rs for a Long Island) – western style, western prices.
Busy Bee Cafe in Lakeside frequently has a live local band playing, and usually a hotspot for local tourists (even in 2024), although probably the most overpriced drinks on the Lakeside strip.
Festivals[edit]
Dipawali — the Hindu festival of lights and worshipping of Laxmi, celebrated in either October or November, is a great time to be in Pokhara.
Full Moon Trance Parties are held in the surrounding hills during the warmer months. Ask around for details and schedule. There have been several instances of festivals publishing fake line-ups so check with the artists.
Holi — the festival of colour is heavily celebrated. Concerts and musical events are held on Pokhara, Lakeside.
Street Festival — is celebrated every year from 27 December to 2 January. Thousands of people gather and celebrate the festival on Lakeside street. It is one of the biggest festivals in the Pokhara valley.
Buy[edit]
There are several ATMs in central Lakeside and all over Pokhara. All charge a withdrawal fee of Rs500 per transaction. Nabil Bank and Standard Chartered Bank ATMs have the highest withdrawal limit of Rs35,000 per transaction.

Jewels and trinkets from the lovely Tibetan women who ply the streets with their wares in backpacks or blankets. Sit and enjoy the atmosphere, and make sure you bargain as starting prices generally are highly inflated.
Kriayt Social Business is a marketplace in central Lakeside with the mission of empowering Nepali women to earn a living. You can buy beautiful handmade items and even design your own, all while supporting a good cause.
Hemp products. There are numerous stores in the Lakeside area where you can get clothing, bags, and other accessories made from hemp. Hemp fibre is superior to cotton in durability, breathability, and environment impact. There are different quality (e.g. fibre density), so compare ahead.
General shopping can be done cheaply in new Town, a large bazaar selling clothing, fruit, vegetables and general items is located across the road from the old bus station
Though relatively cheap, hiking gear sold in lakeside is of notoriously poor quality — often not even surviving one trek.
General shopping can be done cheaply in the bazaar across the road from the old bus station.
 Bhat Bhateni Supermaket & Department Store, off New road (City center pokhara), ☏ +977-61-523264. (updated Jun 2019)
Eat[edit]
The cheapest (and often the best) food is found at the street stalls, selling momos/dumplings, samosas or fried noodles. Early in the morning, children walk the streets with trays of pastries; chocolate croissants, cinnamon rolls and other cakes.
The bazaar across from the old bus station has basic Nepali dishes from Rs60, and a nice atmosphere amongst the bustle of vendors.

Budget[edit]

The only way you'll find this place is to look out for the handwritten sign sitting at the end of the alleyway that the restaurant sits in.

Sleep[edit]
Virtually all tourist accommodations are in Lakeside and Damside, near Phewa Lake. In addition, there are around 12 guesthouses uphill in Sarangkot which offer better views and less air pollution, but are much more expensive for both accommodation and food. Note that these hotels are not accessible by car - they are a 20-minute walk uphill on gravel from the taxi stand in Sarangkot (Rs500 for a taxi, less for a microbus).
Work-aways and farm stays are common, many will ask for money to cover volunteers food.

Long-term[edit]
It is possible to find medium or long-term accomndation in Pokhara. Best by far is to ask locally. Anything geared exclusively for tourists in the Lakeside area will start at about US$250/300 per month for a probably new but not really special place. It takes some time but if you scout around you can find good deals for US$100-150 per month. Keep in mind that most locals make a very meager salary usually under US$200. When they say that US$300 is "local price", it is of course not true. Many local options lack furniture, Internet, etc., so you will have realistically have to pay a bit more if you want something where you can immediately move into.
