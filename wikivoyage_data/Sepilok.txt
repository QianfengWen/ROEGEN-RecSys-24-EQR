5.864978117.9490861 Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre (Situated on the edge of a forest reserve. Taxis can be found out front: RM40 to Sandakan), ☏ +60 8821 5353, rhinosbh@gmail.com. 09:00-12:00 & 14:00-16:00. Exhibition Hall: Sa-Th 09:00-16:30. Established in 1964, its purpose is to rescue orphaned and abandoned juvenile orangutans and teach them to fend for themselves. The best time to visit is at feeding times (10AM and 3PM) when orangutans and monkeys such as the long-tailed macaques are likely to appear for the bananas and sugar cane. Feeding times may be delayed due to rain.An informative video about the work of the centre is played at 9AM and after the morning feeding. Within the reserve, the visitor is restricted to the boardwalks leading to the feeding area and outdoor nursery (the best place to watch young orangutan if they’re there, as they exercise / play on the ropes and with each other). Visitors can only bring cameras into the reserve. Bags, water, and food must be left in the free lockers near the entrance. You can buy drinks and souvenirs from the outdoor nursery. There is an average cafe outside the reserve by the car park. As the centre is in a rainforest, you may want to apply insect repellent before you go in, but you can’t put on any inside. Keep an eye out for signs of rain. There is no shelter at the feeding area, but the nearby outdoor nursery viewing room has a roof and air conditioning.Expect that morning feeding time will be crowded with tour buses full of travelers from Kota Kinabalu, all keenly jostling for that perfect photo. For those with the luxury of time, the afternoon has the added delight of likely seeing a larger number of the animals in a more personal, peaceful atmosphere.Each ticket is valid all day, so you could arrive for the 9AM video, see the morning feeding, visit the sun bear centre next door, have lunch nearby, and return for the afternoon feeding. Adults: foreigner RM 30, Malaysian RM 5. Youth 17 years and younger: foreigner RM 15, Malaysian RM 2. Camera fee: RM 10 (2019).   (updated Aug 2019)

Centre itself is not very big, 30-40 minutes will be enough to see everything inside. Adults Malaysian RM 15, foreigner RM 30. Children aged 12-17 Malaysian RM 2, foreigner RM 5.   (updated Aug 2016)
