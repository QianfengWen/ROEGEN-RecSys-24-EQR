Understand[edit]
Bamfield
Bamfield was populated by Huu-ay-aht of the Nuu-chah-nulth, the local indigenous people. Europeans founded a small fishing community sometime in the late 1800s. Most of the indigenous people now live in the neighbouring village of Anacla about 5 km from Bamfield.
Bamfield was named after the first government agent of the area, William Eddy Banfield. The name "Bamfield" with an "m" is said to be either due to how the local First Nations people had trouble pronouncing the letter "n" in his name, or a mistake made by the post office. In 1902, the Bamfield cable station was constructed as the western terminus of a worldwide undersea telegraph cable called by some the All Red Line as it passed only through countries and territories controlled by the British Empire, which were coloured red on the map. The cable went to Fanning Island, a tiny coral atoll in the mid-Pacific, and from there continued to Fiji, New Zealand, and Australia. A second building, made of concrete, was built on the site in 1926 to replace the old wood structure. This building, designated a historic site in 1930, is now used by the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre.
A Marine and Fisheries lifesaving station on the Pacific coast was established at Bamfield in 1907. It was the first lifesaving station on Canada's Pacific Coast.
In 1953 the cable was extended up the Alberni Inlet to Port Alberni and the local station was closed in 1959.  In 1972, the site was converted into a marine biology research station, the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre. It became the largest employer in the community.
Commercial fishing was based in Bamfield up to the mid-1980s. Bamfield is now home to several sport fishing lodges, which pursue primarily salmon and halibut. Bamfield is also the northern terminus of the West Coast Trail, a hiking trail built in 1907 along the west coast of Vancouver Island to help survivors of the area's many shipwrecks find their way back to civilization. The trail runs 77 km (48 mi) along extremely rugged terrain.

The Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre also offers credited university courses through its five associated universities. An outreach program, which provides multi-day immersion field trips for school, college and adult learners, also bring thousands of visitors to the community every year.
