Fairview, "Heart of the Peace", is a town of about 3,000 people (2016) in Alberta's Peace River Country. Fairview is an agricultural community that is halfway between Grande Prairie and Peace River. 


Understand[edit]
The last real oil boom faded in the 1990s, and the explosive growth of Grande Prairie - about an hour down the road - has had further negative impact on the town's commercial life, but tidy Fairview remains a center of government and farm services. In the 1950s, the town was awarded one of the province's three agricultural colleges, and the old campus (formerly Fairview College, briefly and controversially taken over by Edmonton's NAIT, now managed at a closer distance by Grande Prairie Regional College) occupies much of the town today. If you came from the south, you'll already be 20 minutes past Fairview's greatest attraction: the glorious Peace River valley, slashed out of the surrounding prairie with very little warning.
This little town has produced a few famous sons and daughters — former Alberta premier Rachel Notley grew up here, as did far-right firebrand Jordan B. Peterson. Smack the pedestrian crossing button at the town's only traffic light (installed a couple years ago for the sake of elementary school students), or admire one of Alberta's widest main streets. Try to find the Anglican Church (it's inside a mini-mall!) If the highly-in-demand Dunvegan campground is full, Cummings Lake just north of town is an acceptable alternative, with paved trails and a surprisingly large and comprehensive (although little-staffed) museum.

Get in[edit]
Fairview is on Highway 2, 5 hours northwest of Edmonton and an hour-and-a-half north of Grande Prairie.
The Fairview Airport is 3 km northwest of the town; there are no scheduled flights.
