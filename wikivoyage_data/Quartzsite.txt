I-10 and Hwy 95 are the main thoroughfares into and through town.

By car[edit]
 Interstate 10 (I-10)/Christopher Columbus Transcontinental Fwy passes through Quartzite in an east/west direction. It is the main stopping area when traveling from Phoenix and before crossing into California. Quartzite is accessed from Exits 11 and 31 with Exit 17 and 19 specifically into town.

 Main St serves as local road access from Exit 17 of I-10, through downtown Quartzite to Riggles Ave where it connects back to I-10 at Mile 19. The old US Routes 60 & 70 that used to go (concurrently) through town as Main St before the freeway was built.
 &  Central Blvd divides the town in directional quadrants at its intersection with Main. Central divides east from west and Main divides north from south.  Going north on US-95, it goes concurrently on I-10 to Blythe, CA (at Exit 242) and through the eastside of Blythe on Intake Blvd towards Needles at I-40. Going north on Central Blvd the road becomes AZ-95 towards Parker and to the south as US-95 towards Yuma.
