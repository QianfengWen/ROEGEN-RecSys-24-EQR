Understand[edit]
Montauk is known by many Long Island residents as "The End," because it is the easternmost point of the island and New York state.
Montauk has a rich history. It is named after the Montaukett tribe that lived on the lands that now encompass Montauk. Urban legend tells of Captain Kidd burying treasure somewhere in Montauk around 1700. Montauk is also home to the oldest ranch in the United States, Deep Hollow Ranch.
At the point of the hamlet stands Montauk Point Lighthouse, the first lighthouse built in New York and fourth-oldest lighthouse in the United States.
Montauk is home to the largest commercial and recreational fishing fleet in the state of New York. It boasts the claim that it has more saltwater fishing records than any other port in the world.

Get in[edit]
Montauk is easily accessible by car, by bus, by rail, and even by boat.

By plane[edit]
41.076667-71.9205561 Montauk Airport (MTP  IATA), 428 E Lake Dr (on the north side directly east of Montauk County Park), ☏ +1 631 668-3738. Serves charter planes and private flights, with Tropic Ocean Airways offering seasonal routes from New York Seaplane Base.   
East Hampton Airport (HTO IATA) offers a larger runway suitable for light jets with a number of charter companies.
Otherwise, taking a commercial flight to New York is easy. There are three airports to chose from in the region. John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK IATA) and LaGuardia Airport (LGA IATA), both in Queens, and MacArthur Airport (ISP IATA) in Islip are all easily the first step to getting to Montauk. However, the Queens airports, in particular, are quite distant from Montauk, and taxi fares to or from those airports would be prohibitively expensive.

By car[edit]
It's easy to get out to "The End" in your own car or by rental car. The only road that goes out to seaside town is Sunrise Highway (or Route 27), which runs from New York City all the way to Montauk. Along the way, Sunrise Highway turns into Montauk Highway, yet it is still known as Route 27.

By bus[edit]
The Hampton Jitney bus service runs from Manhattan to Montauk. There are also local Suffolk County buses that run from town to town.

By train[edit]
The Long Island Railroad (LIRR), run by MTA, is an alternative to driving. Most trains run from Jamaica station in Queens, where it's an easy change from other trains from Manhattan and other parts of New York City.

41.048236-71.9532082 Montauk railway station, Edgemere Street and Fort Pond Road (north of the city center).   (updated Apr 2020)
