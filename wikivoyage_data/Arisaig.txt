Arisaig is a village on the coast of  Lochaber in the Scottish Highlands, with a population of about 300. It stands on the "Road to the Isles", the traditional route from the south via Fort William to Mallaig and thence to Skye. You can still travel this way, though most traffic now reaches Skye via the bridge. Arisaig is now on a bypassed loop of the road and is more peaceful as a result.

By train[edit]
ScotRail run four trains M-Sa (one on Sunday in winter, two in summer) from Glasgow Queen Street along the scenic West Highland Line via Arrochar (for Loch Lomond), Crianlarich (where a portion divides for Oban), Fort William, Glenfinnan, Beasdale and Arisaig to Mallaig. The last train south is around 6:30PM to reach Queen Street by midnight.
The Jacobite steam train runs Apr-Oct between Fort William and Mallaig, and stops by request at Arisaig. It's a six-hour excursion (depart 10:15AM, return by 4PM) allowing two hours in Arisaig. May to mid-Sept there's also an afternoon train (2:30 - 8:30PM), so you could have six hours here, time for a boat trip to the Small Isles, by going in the morning and returning on the afternoon excursion. Trains also stop at Glenfinnan for the obligatory photo of the viaduct. These excursions connect with the Caledonian Sleeper from London. See their website and Fort William#Get in for more info. 
Under your own steam, using the regular train service, you can day trip here from Fort William leaving at 8:30AM or noon and setting off back around 4:20PM or 6:30PM, for only £15 adult return, about a quarter of the Jacobite fare. 
56.9129-5.83951 Arisaig railway station is the most westerly on the Great Britain rail network. It's just a platform halt with no facilities, buy your ticket on board if your journey starts here. There is step-free access to Platform 1 and a "barrow" level crossing to Platform 2 towards Fort William. 
56.9001-5.7642 Beasdale railway station  is another request stop eight minutes before Arisaig, which may be more convenient for Loch nan Uamh. It's just a platform halt with no facilities, the former station house is privately owned. During World War II this area was used for training "special ops" agents in paramilitary skills, and at Beasdale station they practiced leaping on and off moving trains. 

By bus[edit]
Shiel Buses 500, 502, 505 and 534 run from Fort William three times M-F and once on Saturday, taking an hour via Glenfinnan and Lochailort, and continuing to Morar and Mallaig. The bus stop in Arisaig is by the village shop.
Bus 501 runs from Lochailort and Arisaig to Mallaig once on schoolday mornings, returning in the afternoon, with an extra run on Thursdays.

By road[edit]
Arisaig is just off A830 the "Road to the Isles", coursing west from the A82 at Fort William to Mallaig. Much of the A830 has been improved, so it's fairly quick driving, but there are a few tight bends.

56.89495-5.745173 The Prince's Cairn  is where Bonnie Prince Charlie embarked for France on 20 Sep 1746. He'd been on the run for six months since his defeat at Culloden, and this was the sixth attempted rescue by ship with winter approaching and the redcoat dragnet tightening. He left with some 100 supporters, with upbeat promises to return; but France would not commit troops to a further invasion and in 1747 made peace with Britain.
56.8926-5.730564 Loch nan Uamh Viaduct  was built of concrete 1897-1901 to carry the railway past the head of the loch. At the larger Glenfinnan Viaduct 15 miles east, there was a legend that a horse and cart fell into one of the bridge pylons during construction and became entombed. Modern imaging could find nothing there, but in 2001 the horse and cart were detected within the central pylon here. Alas, it was too late to save the poor horse.
