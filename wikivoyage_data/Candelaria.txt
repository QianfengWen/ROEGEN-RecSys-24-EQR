History[edit]
Prehistoric caves has been found in the surrounding area of present day Candelaria, in which burials have been found containing Guanche mummies. Interestingly, the burial process used here was very similar to those used for the pharaohs in Egypt, which leads scientists to believe some connection between those existed. From the end of the 14th century, Candelaria was a deserted area often frequented by shepherds of the neighbouring Güímar kingdom which predated Hispanic rule. Ravines in the area were said to be the residence of Chaxiraxi, the Guanche mother of the gods.
Modern Candelaria is the principal Catholic centre of pilgrimage of the Canary Islands, and of the principal ones of Spain. The city is annually visited by thousands of people, both Catholic pilgrims and tourists.

The Basilica of Candelaria
28.35128-16.3697821 Basilica of Candelaria (Basílica y Real Santuario Mariano de Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria), Plaza Patrona de Canarias. Roman Catholic minor basilica, dedicated to the Virgin of Candelaria which is the patron of the Canarias. After a design of architect José Enrique Marrero Regalado, it is the most important religious building on Tenerife. The basilica was built on the ruins of a Guanche era church that was destroyed by a fire in 1789, but construction had been postponed several times, first due to the economic crisis of 1931, then by the outbreak of the First World War and later the Spanish Civil War. It was only due to efforts by the bishop of Tenerife that an updated design of the basilica was put forward in a neo-Canarian eclectic mix of all styles that have occurred on the Canary Islands. Construction started in 1949 and was finished a decade later, with consecration in 1959. The basilica receives 2.5 million visitors annually, and has space for 5000 worshippers. Free.

It dates back to the Guanche era when the cave was used as a place of worship. Archaeological evidence indicates the cave has been in use for ritual purposes for over 3000 years, and a fire was kept burning in it permanently. The entrance of the cave is nowadays concealed by a small chapel. Inside the cave is a bronze replica of the Virgin of Candelaria, and her statue is the most venerated on the island. Free.

28.351667-16.373 Square of the Saint Patron of the Canary Islands (Plaza de la Patrona de Canarias). 24/7. One of the most important squares of Tenerife, surrounded by the famous basilica and numerous bars and cafes. The history dates back to the late 17th century when at the location of the current plaza stood a fortress called Castillo de San Pedro. It was a defensive fortification on a beach built to protect the church predating the current basilica and a convent against pirate attacks and looting. When the castle was wiped off the map in 1826 by a storm, the idea of a square developed. Construction began a century later in the late 1950s, and the square was officially inaugurated in 1959, the same year as the basilica. Free.   (updated Jul 2019)
