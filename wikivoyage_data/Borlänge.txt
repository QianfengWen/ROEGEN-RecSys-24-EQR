Borlänge is a town in the Dalarna province in Sweden. It has a population of roughly 51,000, slightly less than its close neighbor Falun.


Understand[edit]
Until the end of the 19th century, Borlänge was a small village. In the 1870s, the village became a stop on the new railway connecting Falun and Ludvika, and around the train station a service and industry city emerged. The most notable among the Borlänge industries were Kvarnveden paper mill and Domnarvets Jernverk steel mill. In 1900 Borlänge had grown to some 4,000 inhabitants. The city remained heavily industrialized until the 1970s, but today the majority of Borlänge's population work in the service sector. Borlänge's modernist city centre was voted the ugliest in Sweden in a 2018 popular poll.

Drink[edit]
Younger people go to S2, located opposite of Stationsgatan 1, or Flamingo for dancing. If you want a pub with the real local feel you should check out Engelska. It's kind of a dive bar and populated by a diverse bunch of people. Bolanche, above Stationsgatan 1, is the place for people in the ages 25-30 while Liljan, in the Liljan "galleria" on the park side, is the place for the more mature. If you like rock you may want to head to The Rock House, opposite Flamingo, although it's usually kind of deserted. And as always it's easiest to ask the locals were to find these places.
