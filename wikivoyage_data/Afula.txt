Afula[dead link] is medium-sized town in the northern Israel. It is the largest city in the Jezreel Valley and the capital of that region.


Understand[edit]
Dating back at least since the 11th century, but possible several thousand more years. Afula remained a small village but became somewhat of a logistics node when the Jezreel Valley railway was inaugurated in 1904. The whole town was bought in 1925 by American Zionist Commonwealth as part of the Sursock Purchase, the largest Jewish land acquisition during Mandatory Palestine. About one hundred Arab families who had lived in the area either accepted compensation for their land and left voluntarily or were evicted. In the following decades Afula saw a large influx of Jewish immigrants and it has grown into a modern and well-developed town, however lacking in tourist sights.
