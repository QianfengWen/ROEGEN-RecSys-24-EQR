Vladimir is somewhat elongated along the river that forms its southern boundary. From the north, the city is bounded by a "semi-circle" road, formerly a part of the M7 highway. Inside the city, small rivers flow into the Klyazma and form deep valleys that were used as fortifications.
The inner layout of Vladimir is fairly simple. The main street runs roughly from west to east close to the Klyazma River and passes through the historical centre. Different parts of this street have different names: Московское шоссе (entry from Moscow) – проспект Ленина – улица Студёная гора – Дворянская улица – Большая Московская улица – Большая Нижегородская улица – Добросельская улица (entry from Nizhny Novgorod). Several major streets branch off to the north, cross the "semi-circle" road and turn into the roads towards Suzdal and Ivanovo (Суздальское шоссе) or Yuryev-Polsky (улица Горького). A single street (Муромское шоссе) also runs to the south, crosses the river and continues towards Sudogda, Murom, and Gus-Khrustalnyi.
The main sights, along with a number of hotels and restaurants, are found in the historical centre, close to Bolshaya Moskovskaya Ulitsa (Большая Московская улица). If you arrive to Vladimir from Moscow, you enter this part of the city at the Golden Gate. Moving further to the east, one leaves the historical centre after passing the Nativity Monastery and the Hotel Vladimir. The Cathedral Square (Соборная площадь) is in the middle of this way. The train and bus stations are found to the east from the historical centre, at the bottom of the hill.

History[edit]
Vladimir was founded in 1108 by Vladimir Monomakh. There is an alternative version that ascribes the foundation of the city to Vladimir the Red Sun in 990. Yet the exact year does not seem to be very important for the average traveler, since the oldest existing monuments date back only to the middle of the 12th century. At that period, the city was rapidly developing due to the activity of Prince Andrey Bogolyubsky who established the capital of North-Eastern Russia in Vladimir. The city's period of greatest importance was probably in the late 12th and early 13th century, up to the Mongol invasion. Several of Russia's greatest architectural monuments were built in Vladimir during that time, including Assumption Cathedral and the Golden Gates, both of which are World Heritage Sites.
In 1238, Vladimir was besieged and taken by the Mongol hordes under Batu Khan. The city never recovered fully. Though it remained the pricipality's capital for a century, Vladimir gradually lost its political and cultural significance to Moscow. Until the middle of the 15th century, Vladimir was the capital of North-Eastern Russia, but the actual government worked in Moscow. The transfer of the capital was completed in the 15th century: the Assumption Cathedral in the Moscow Kremlin, modeled after one of the oldest cathedrals in Vladimir, became the state church. The holy icon of Our Lady of Vladimir was also moved to Moscow.
Vladimir continued to be a provincial capital. It gradually grew in size due to its advantageous location in the middle of Central Russia. The development of the city was enhanced by the construction of the Moscow – Nizhny Novgorod railroad in the late 19th century.
Vladimir is a partially industrialized city, although the historical centre remains almost untouched since the beginning of the 20th century. In 1992, Vladimir was included in the World Heritage List of UNESCO.

Get in[edit]
Vladimir is halfway between Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod, so you will be able to get in from both cities. It is also possible to visit Vladimir during a trip around the Golden Ring.

By plane[edit]
Vladimir Semyazino airport does not have regular passenger communication. Nearest airports are in Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod, both receive international flights. From there, you can easily reach Vladimir by train, by bus, or by car.

By train[edit]
The main station is next to the central bus station and close to the historic centre.

56.1299440.420421 Vladimir railway station.  (updated Jun 2021)
From Moscow[edit]
Four or five suburban trains per day run to Vladimir from Moscow's Kurskaya Station. The journey takes 2½-3 hr. Buy tickets at the regional (short-distance) train ticket counter in the right wing of the Kurskaya station (Poezda Prigorodnogo Napravleniya - Gorkogo). Tickets cost from 505 руб (June 2019) one way. There are several daily departures with the earliest at 08:00. The 18:00 express is the quickest of these local trains but it has limited seats available. It returns from Vladimir at 06:00.
Some super-fast Sapsan trains also call at Vladimir en route between Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod. The journey takes 1hr 45min and a seat costs 1400-3000 руб. The 06:45 departure may appeal to early risers. They use a different section of the same station as the local trains.
Regular long-distance trains also call at Vladimir. They are more frequent than the suburban trains but they are generally not faster. Prices from Moscow range greatly from 500 руб to around 1000 руб. They mainly leave from the same station as the Sapsan high-speed trains but many also leave from Moscow's Yaroslavsky rail terminal. One or two depart from Moscow's Kazansky rail terminal.
Heading beyond Moscow, Vladimir is well connected to many cities including Saint Petersburg and Vladivostok.
From Moscow, taking one of the hourly local trains to Petushki is an alternative. Local trains between Vladimir and Petushki run 3 times per day. The overall journey is longer (3½-4 hr) but it may be helpful in case you miss other trains and the buses are overcrowded.

From Nizhny Novgorod[edit]
All trains to Vladimir depart from the main railway station. There is a direct express local train, which leaves Nizhny Novgorod at 16:10 and returns from Vladimir at 07:00. The trip takes 3½ hr.
The high-speed Sapsan train takes around 2 hr and costs from 1200 руб. Several long-distance trains from all over the country also connect Vladimir and Nizhny Novgorod. Price range from 400 руб to 1000 руб. The journey takes 3-4 hr.
Ordinary local trains connect in stages the towns along the Moscow - Nizhny Novgorod railway (such as Pokrov, Kovrov, Vyazniki, Gorokhovets) to Vladimir. Unless you are planning to see these towns it is advisable to use buses, as the local trains are slow and the necessary changes will make the journey last all day.

By bus[edit]
Vladimir has two bus stations:

Central bus station is next to the railway station, close to the historical centre. This station operates bus routes to every town in Vladimir Oblast as well as many intercity routes (to Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Ivanovo, Ryazan, etc.) Normally, you have to buy tickets inside the station. The square near the central bus station is a hub of private bus routes that are usually operated by minibuses. Such routes do not have a strict schedule and depart as soon as the minibus is filled up. You should pay directly to the driver or to a special person who collects money near the bus. The private routes serve Moscow, Murom, Gus-Khrustalny, and Ivanovo (via Suzdal). The last bus to Moscow departs at around 20:00.
Local bus station is near the Central Market (take trolleybus #10 from the central bus station). This station serves a number of very local bus routes to nearby villages. You are unlikely to use it.
Basic options of travelling to Vladimir by bus are as follows:

From Moscow: "official" buses depart from the central (intercity) bus station at Shelkovskaya metro station.  There are at least ten buses per day, either running between Moscow and Vladimir or heading for further destinations (Kovrov, Ivanovo, Gus-Khrustalny, Murom, Vyazniki). Basically, it is more convenient to use private buses that depart from the square near Kursky railway station. Such buses leave every 30 minutes or even more often. The trip takes at least 3 hours, the price is about 220 руб. Expect a longer trip during the weekdays (especially in the evening due to traffic problems near Moscow) and long queues for the buses during rush hours (like Friday and Sunday evenings).
From Nizhny Novgorod: buses to Vladimir depart from Kanavino bus station. There are 8-10 buses per day (either to Moscow or Vladimir), and the trip takes about 5 hours.
From other places: you will find at least 2 or 3 daily buses to Vladimir from any town of Vladimir region and from central cities of neighboring regions. The most frequent connections (every 1-1½ hours) run from Suzdal, Murom, Gus-Khrustalny, and Ivanovo (via Suzdal).
By car[edit]
Vladimir is easily reachable from Moscow (180 km along the M7 road), Nizhny Novgorod (240 km along the M7 road), Ivanovo (115 km along the A113 road), and Ryazan (230 km along the R123 and R73 roads, via Tuma and Gus-Khrustalny). In the city, you will find a lot of space for free parking on side streets and several parking areas on the main street (Bolshaya Moscovskaya) as well.

Get around[edit]
56°7′38″N 40°24′32″EMap of Vladimir
The historical centre is easily explored by foot, so the regular traveller is unlikely to use the public transport in Vladimir. Still, there is an extensive network of trolleybuses, buses, and minibuses (marshrutki), serving the whole city. The most useful option is the trolleybus #5 that connects the train station to the historical centre and runs along Bolshaya Moscovksaya Ulitsa. Normally, you have to pay to the driver or to a special lady who sits in the bus and collects the money.

See[edit]
Must-see list[edit]
These monuments are recognized by UNESCO and included in the World Heritage List. They are essential tourist destinations in Vladimir.

St. Demetrius Cathedral
56.12738640.4089171 Cathedral of the Assumption (Успенский собор), Соборная площадь (Cathedral Square). It is one of the most historically important Russian Orthodox Churches. For a short period in the 14th century, the cathedral was the seat of the Metropolitan, the leader of the Russian Ortodox Church. The cathedral was built in 1158 with only one dome. However, the major reconstruction followed already in 1185: four smaller domes were added, and the building was considerably enlarged in order to resemble St. Sophia's Cathedral in Kyiv. Later on, a similar project was utilized for the cathedral of the Assumption in Moscow Kremlin. The neghboring bell tower of eclectic style was built in 1810 to replace the former hip-roof tower. The interior of the cathedral includes a number of ancient frescos from the late 12th century (northern wall) and 15th century (vaults), the latter being painted by Andrei Rublev and Daniil Chyorny. The cathedral combines church and museum activities. Services are normally held in the morning and offer free entrance. During the opening hours of the museum (Tu-Su 13:00-16:30), the tickets are sold.   (updated Sep 2023)
56.12916740.4108332 Cathedral of St. Demetrius (Дмитриевский собор), Соборная площадь. This is the other ancient cathedral of Vladimir. The building was constructed in 1194-97 as an in-house church of the Prince's court. Galleries linked the cathedral to the palace, but they were removed during the reconstruction in the 19th century. St. Demetrius' Cathedral is now a detached church, a unique monument of ancient Russian architecture. The bottom part of the walls is flat (here the galleries were attached), while the upper part is covered by fine stone carvings. These carvings depict stories from the life of King David and praise the harmony of the world. Yet the meaning of some carvings remains unknown. The cathedral hosts a small museum that presents enlarged images and detailed explanations for a number of carvings as well as a small piece of original frescos from the late 12th century. The museum is open W-M from 11:00 till 17:00 or 18:00. Don't forget to have a look from the nearby viewpoint!   
Golden Gate
56.12666740.3969443 [dead link] Golden Gate (Золотые ворота), Большая Московская ул (west from the Cathedral square). Once the entrance to the walled city, the gate was built in 1158-64. At that time, the city was surrounded by a rampart with five stone gates. The Golden Gate is the only remaining part of the complex and the unique monument of ancient fortifications in Russia. The ramparts were removed in the 19th century, and the gate was reinforced by four circular bastions at the buttresses. These bastions strongly changed the appearance of the gate, so it may be advisable to see the picture of the original building like in a museum of military history inside the gate. The remaining part of the rampart is found south from the gate, along the Kozlov Rampart Street (ул. Козлов вал).   
Other churches[edit]
There are lots of churches in Vladimir, and you're unlikely to visit all of them. Here are representative examples of various styles:

56.13166740.4136114 Nativity Monastery (Рождественский монастырь), Большая Московская ул. 68 (east from the Cathedral square). The monastery was founded in the end of the 12th century and played important role for Russian Orthodox Church during the Middle Ages. None of the ancient buildings survived, but it is worth to see the stone walls and towers from the 18th century. Though there was no real threat to Vladimir at that time, the walls imitate fortifications of ancient Russian monasteries. You will also find a church and several living houses with fine decorations from the 17th century. The monastery is a home to the bishop of Vladimir region.  
56.1311440.399095 Cathedral of the Assumption (Princess Convent) (Успенский собор Княгинина монастыря), Княгининская ул (north from the Trading Rows). The history of the Princess Convent is traced back to the 12th century. The central building, the Cathedral of the Assumption, was built in the beginning of the 13th century. In the 16th century, the cathedral was rebuilt in its present shape (known as "Moscow style" of church architecture). You can see numerous kokoshniki below the dome and compare this type of decoration with the ancient one from St. Demetrius' Cathedral. Note fine frescos from the 17th century inside the Cathedral.  
 Church of the Assumption of our Lady (Богородице-Успенская церковь), Большая Московская ул. 106а (east from the historical centre). This church built in 1644-49 presents another example of original Russian architecture. Apart from kokoshniki, you will find a hip-roof bell tower, a typical feature of the 17th century-style. 
56.130340.39696 Church of St. Nikita (Никитская церковь), Княгининская ул., 8 (next to the Princess Convent). This former church was built in baroque style in the middle of the 18th century. Bright green color and huge building sharply contrast to the harmony of the ancient white-stone cathedrals. Still, the decoration of the church is remarkable. The building houses a restoration workshop.  
56.1268540.40217 Church of St. George (Георгиевская церковь), Георгиевская ул., 6 (cross Bolshaya Moscovskaya st. near the Trading Rows and head south). Another example of baroque-style architecture. This church is rather small and looks modest as compared to the Church of St. Nikita. The nice appearance is supplied by the neighboring hip-roof bell tower. For a long time, the Church of St. George housed a concert hall, but now it should start regular services.  
56.12486340.3870878 Church of St. Michael the Archangel (Михаило-Архангельская церковь), ул. Студёная гора, 1a (west from the Golden Gate). This impressive dark-red church was built in the end of the 19th century in neo-Byzantine style. It is probably one of the best (or, at least, most harmonious) representatives of this style in Russia.  
56.126340.3969 Church of St. Trinity / Red Church (Троицкая церковь), Дворянская ул., 2 (next to the Golden Gate). The red-brick church of eclectic style (with an emphasis on Russian revival, though) from 1913-1916. It houses a museum of crystal, miniature paintings, and embroidery.  
56.12540.39510 Church of Our Lady of the Rosary (Костёл св. Розария Пречистой Девы Марии), ул. Гоголя, 12в (south from the Golden Gate). This Catholic church from the late 19th century is a rare example of neo-gothic building in Vladimir region. The church was constructed for Polish-Lithuanian troop that stayed in Vladimir. The church works under the supervision of Roman Catholic church. This lovely place is worth a visit, especially during Catholic holidays.  
Secular buildings[edit]
Since the 18th century, Vladimir has been a provincial city, so its secular buildings are rather small and modest. Do not expect to see any masterpieces. Still, it is possible to find a number of nice buildings from different periods and styles.

56.12958140.40732111 House of the Assembly of Nobility (Дворянское собрание), Большая Московская ул., 33 (next to the Cathedral Square). This building in the empire style from the early 19th century has once been a cultural centre of Vladimir.  
56.1283340.4031212 Trading Rows (Торговые ряды), Большая Московская ул., 19 (between the Cathedral square and the Golden Gate). A very typical building for Russian architecture of the late 18th – early 19th century. The Trading Rows in Vladimir follow the general classicism style with an original project from the late 18th century, although the present appearance of the building is heavily disrupted by the signboards and advertisements.  
56.12721240.4023913 Old Pharmacy (Старая аптека), Георгиевская ул., 3 (close to the Trading Rows and the Church of St. George). A small lovely building from the late 18th century.  
 City Bank (Городской банк), Большая Московская ул., 29 (next to the Cathedral square). The red-and-white neoclassical building from 1896. 
 City Museum (Городской музей), Большая Московская ул., 64 (east from the Cathedral square). This red-brick building of Russian-revival (pseudo-Russian) style is now a home to the history museum. 
56.12521140.39865814 Water tower (Водонапорная башня), ул. Козлов вал (south from the Golden Gate). The pseudo-Russian style water tower is likely one of the most impressive and unusual secular buildings in Vladimir. It was constructed in 1868 as a part of the first water-supply system and re-built in 1912. It houses an exhibition on the history of Vladimir.  
 House of the Temperance Association (Народный дом общества трезвости), ул. Гагарина, 7 (south from the Trading Rows). A very unusual mix of neoclassical and art nouveau styles. In the beginning of the 20th century, this house was one of the cultural centres of Vladimir. 
 House of Realschule (Реальное училище), Никитская ул., 1 (next to the Golden Gate). It is an art nouveau building from 1908 with colored brick and nice decorations. It is occupied by Vladimir University. 
 Building College (Строительный колледж), ул. Дзержинского, 6 (west from the Golden Gate). A rare example of the building from Stalin's Empire style in Vladimir. The project is rather regular and dates back to 1950, although a small tower is certainly an unusual feature that originates from art nouveau or Russian-revival fashion. 
Museums[edit]
The two important museums of Vladimir are the Cathedral of the Assumption and the Cathedral of St. Demetrius that exhibit ancient frescos (see the "Must-see list" above). You can also visit other museums:

The museum covers the history of Vladimir region from the very beginning (Stone age) till the February Revolution of 1917.

Stoletov family is well-known in Russia: Nilokay Stoletov was a military leader, while his brother, Alexander Stoletov, was a famous physicist. The exhibition occupies a wing of the house that used to belong to the family.

Further sights[edit]
56.1290140.40788319 Monument of the 850th anniversary, Соборная площадь (Cathedral square). This amusing monument was laid on 1958 (the 850th anniversary of Vladimir) and completed in 1969. It is a typical example of the "Soviet realism" style. The monument shows three aspects of Vladimir's history (or three faces of the city): a warrior with a sword, an architect with a design, and a worker with a tractor. All together they look quite funny. Don't miss this monument!

Budget[edit]
 Blinchiki (Блинчики), Большая Московская ул. 32 (across the street from the Trading Rows). This small cafe preserves soviet and pretty much fast-food style. However, the menu is rather diverse. The pancakes are very tasty and will certainly satisfy your hunger. 
 Canteen # 2 (Столовая № 2), Вокзальная ул. 15 (west from the train station). Daily 07:00–19:00. A cheap Soviet-style canteen.

Mid-range[edit]
 Shesh Besh (Шеш Беш), Большая Московская ул., 78 (eastern part of the historical centre). A stylish restaurant of Azerbaijan cuisine. Don't expect to find a variety of food (and, especially, vegetarian food) here. Still, different kinds of meat, either grilled (shashlyk) or chopped (lulya-kebab), are perfect. Additionally, there is a buffet with a selection of salads and pickles, spicy eastern-style soups, nice grilled fish, and home-made tea. It is certainly worth to have lunch or dinner in this restaurant, unless you are alrealy experienced in Azerbaijan cuisine. Main dishes: 150-250 руб. 
 Coffee house Na Chekhova (кофейня На Чехова), Большая Московская ул., 67 / ул. Чехова, 2 (eastern part of the historical centre). This is a regular restaurant rather than a small coffee house despite the name. The design is stylish, the choice is wide, and the food is excellent. If you are a gourmet, this coffee house is probably your choice in Vladimir, because you are unlikely to find more delicious and less trivial food in a city like this. Moreover, the prices are really encouraging. Main dishes: 200-350 руб.

Drink[edit]
Beer[edit]
Beer is probably the only local speciality in Vladimir. Vladimir brewery used to be known for a variety of beer sorts, but the diversity has been substantially reduced, because the brewery joined the brand of "live beer" Fifth Ocean (Пятый океан) – a wheat-free unfiltered beer with a special storage technology that allows to keep fresh unfiltered beer for rather long time. This beer is produced in several breweries and distributed all round the country. In Vladimir, it can be found in SPAR supermarkets.
A few filtered lager beers are produced under the general brand Vladimirskoe (Владимирское). They are not very special, but they are local and may be thus expected to be fresh.

Further destinations[edit]
From Vladimir, you can easily reach any place in Vladimir Oblast, and the trip should not take more than 3-3.5 hours. Below, the nearest destinations are listed:

Bogolyubovo – a village near Vladimir with remarkable white-stone monuments from 12th century. The must-see destination for any traveller coming to Vladimir.
Suzdal – the pretty, but quaint, world heritage site. Suzdal supplements Vladimir in the UNESCO list and presents lots of architectural sights from 13th-17th centuries.
Yuryev-Polsky – another part of the Golden Ring, a very provincial town with a nice and unusual white-stone cathedral dating back to 13th century.
Gus-Khrustalny – the town at the crystal factory. The local crystalware is really remarkable and compares to the international brands. Additionally, the town is a gateway to one of the few active networks of narrow-gauge railways in Central Russia.
Vyazniki – a remarkable town with several ancient churches, interesting secular buildings, and a really splendid viewpoint on the hill above the Klyazma river. Vyazniki is close to Mstyora, a famous region of handicrafts, including miniature painting and magnificent emroidery.
Sudogda – some people say that this is one of the most typical provincial towns in Central Russia. Sudogda preserves the complex of provincial buildings from 19th century and sufficiently reflects the present state of Russian province.
Kovrov – an industrial area and the second largest city of Vladimir region. Kovrov does not have any popular tourist attractions, but a number of buildings from late 19th – early 20th century are remarkable.
Lakinsk and Sobinka – small industrial towns to the west from Vladimir with several notable buildings from late 19th – early 20th century.
