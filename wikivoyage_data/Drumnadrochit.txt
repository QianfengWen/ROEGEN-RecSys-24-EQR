Drumnadrochit is a village in  the Great Glen, the fault line that traverses the Scottish Highlands. With a population of 1130 in 2020, it stands on the west shore of Loch Ness at the outlet of the River Enrick. This was difficult to ford in spate so Thomas Telford built a bridge in 1811, hence Druim na Drochaid, "the ridge of the bridge". The impressive ruins of Urquhart Castle stand nearby, but the town makes its living from the legend of the Loch Ness Monster, and every coach tour of the Highlands calls here.

The village is on the A82 between Inverness and Fort William. The usual approach is by road from Inverness, 15 miles north, which has an airport and rail services.
Citylink buses from Inverness take 30 min via Dochgarroch at the north tip of the loch and continue south past Castle Urquhart to Invermoriston. Bus 919 continues on A82 to Fort Augustus, Laggan, Spean Bridge and Fort William, running four times M-Sa and twice on Sunday. Bus 917 branches west on A87 towards Kyle of Lochalsh and Portree on Skye. This runs twice daily.
Stagecoach Bus 17 runs from Inverness Raigmore Hospital and bus station to Drumnadrochit, then heads into the hills along A831 to Corrimony, Cannich and Tomich, so it doesn't run past the castle. There are five M-F and three on Saturday.

Get around[edit]
The core of Drumnadrochit is around the junction of A82 and A831. The south end is nominally the separate village of Lewiston. It's all walkable.
The A82 between village and castle is busy but there's a sidewalk. Buses 917 and 919 stop at castle and village.

Nessie (pictured above) basks in the pond outside the Centre, no charge to view. Frankly it resembles the corpse of a swan: did it eat something it shouldn't?

Impressive ruins of 13th- to 16th-century castle sited on Strone Point overlooking Loch Ness. There was a time when if you traversed the Highlands then you had to pass this way. St Columba (6th century) worked a healing miracle here, and soon afterwards had the first recorded encounter with the Monster, in the river near Inverness. Everyone else brought an army and tried to capture or wreck the place: the English, the Scots, more English, more Scots under Robert the Bruce, then raiders from the Lord of the Isles, and more raiders. After the "Glorious Revolution" of 1688 it was garrisoned against the Jacobites and held out against a siege. The garrison left in 1695 and blew it up to prevent the Jacobites using it, and that was the end of the castle. The Jacobites returned the compliment in 1746 when they abandoned and blew up Inverness Castle. Online: adult £13, child (5-15) £7.80, conc (65+) £10.40; £1 more at the gate.   (updated Aug 2023)
