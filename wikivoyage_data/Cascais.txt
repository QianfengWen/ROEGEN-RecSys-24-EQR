Cascais is beach town in Greater Lisbon, Estremadura, Portugal, at the end of the mouth of the River Tagus as it meets the ocean, with spectacular beaches to be found on its Atlantic shorelines. The combination of maritime leisurely charm, strategic position and location close to Lisbon made it a favourite residence of the Portuguese royal family and several other nobles and one of Portugal's first holiday resorts.


Understand[edit]

Cascais (kush-KIGHSH, /kɐʃ.ˈkajʃ/) is dominated by the bay and the imposing Cidadela fort, and the historic centre is brimming with architectural treasures of a religious, military and civil nature. Likewise, the museums of the Sea, Casa das Histórias de Paula Rego, and the Municipal Museum Condes de Castro Guimarães are also must-see attractions.

Get in[edit]
Cascais is easily reachable from Lisbon by car or by train (40 min), from the Cais do Sodré station. A return ticket costs €5 (June 2018) and can be bought from the automatic ticket machines. Keep the ticket as it will be checked and punched by the conductor in both directions. Each ticket is only valid for one person at a time and costs €0.50 to buy and can be reused until a set date of expiration. Carris operate a bus between Cais do Sodre and Lisbon Airport every 20 min.
A car ride between Lisbon International Airport and Cascais can range between 30 minutes and 1 hr 15 min (during rush hours).
Cascais once a fishermen's harbour is a nice and sophisticated town, also a great gateway to explore the beautiful gold sand beach of Guincho.

By plane[edit]

Get around[edit]
Map of Cascais

The town is small enough to explore entirely by foot. To get a feeling for the life it's best to stroll around on foot. Uphill, beyond the town centre there are numerous narrow cobbled streets to explore with interesting architecture, plants and animals to see.

By bicycle[edit]
Riding a bicycle in Cascais is one of the "must do" things. Keen cyclists with their own bikes and like hills can venture towards Cabo da Roca, the westernmost point of continental Europe's mainland and even to Sintra using the nice roads while crossing the heart of this incredible nature reserve so close to the capital city of Lisbon. However, these are not trips to be taken with bikes rented in Cascais. For those with more limited cycling abilities and stamina, a popular trip is to follow the coastline through the town of Cascais as far as Guincho beach, about 10 km. There is a cycle track (shared with pedestrians!) that begins after you have passed the marina. In the summer, the northwesterly winds can make the last 3 km of this trip a bit tough but, in compensation, you will have a tail wind all the way back to Cascais.
Basic bicycles are available to rent for free (providing you have ID and your accommodation address) through the municipal council's BiCas scheme. Bicycles are available from several locations around the town. The tourist office will have further information. This bikes are heavily (mis)used by locals, students, and budget minded visitors and often are not available when needed, when available most times not always in the best safety and enjoyable conditions thus the common breakdowns. Colourful bikes can be rented in the forecourt of Cascais station and the Europcar car rental company also has some. Companies operating from Lisbon include Bike Iberia (+351 96 242 3455) in Lisbon Downtown off the train station of Cais do Sodre.

By bus[edit]
A looped bus line, BusCas, serves the town and the nearby surrounding area. For travelling further afield there is an extensive bus service, mainly operating from the bus station beneath the shopping centre opposite the train station. Taxis are always available and easy enough to find in the centre of town.

Cascais is a magnet for those looking to practice every type of sport and leisure activity. Besides excellent facilities and all the professional staff and necessary equipment, the region boasts a wide range of natural advantages such as pure air, temperate year-round climate and close proximity to the sea and mountains.
Beginning on Avenida Rei Humberto II de Italia, just outside town past the marina, is a cycle lane and footpath extending the whole 5 km to Guincho beaches. This route runs beside the sea and is ideal for morning and evening strolls. The almost perennial North Atlantic sea breeze lends a refreshing air, especially during the hot summer months.

Eat[edit]
Sardinhas in Cascais
A selection of excellent food and drink can be found on the Estoril Coast if you know where to look. Cod, seabass, and squid are the most popular dishes, and many other types of seafood are available at good establishments. Within central Cascais good food, and especially good value, can be hard to find. Taking time to scout out genuine Portuguese eating houses is worth doing, however, as the tastiest and most interesting dishes often exist in tucked away more modest restaurants, where locals tend to dine.
For the best food in town skip the Indian, Italian and English restaurants and head into the residential part of town, or walk down the coast to an establishment with fresh fish and a sea view.
Bacalhau occupies top spot in terms of culinary richness. You can choose from a 100 different recipes! And if you’d like to try a typical meat dish of the region, try Leitão de Negrais or Mercês-style pork.
Find yourself a restaurant that takes its desserts seriously, and finish your meal with one of the local sweet specialties: Travesseiros, the famous Queijadas de Sintra, Fofos de Belas, Areias de Cascais or Trouxas de Malveira. Portuguese egg-based confectionery is unique and delicious, and a fine companion for some after dinner port.
Vino Verde, "green wine", is a refreshing, slightly sparkling accompaniment to Portuguese meals, and shouldn't be missed. Portuguese red wines are on a par with those in France, Italy and Spain. The main demarcated regions are found in the Douro, Dão and Alentejo, but the Estoril Coast produces very small quantities of its own fine wines in Carcavelos and Colares, a rare pleasure that you might have the opportunity to try.

Fresh seafood fills the menu at this folksy restaurant, a favorite since 1964, where a cluttered ceiling and maritime-related artifacts distract the eye.
