Lake Inari
Inari (North Sami: Anár, Inari Sami: Aanaar, Skolt Sami: Aanar, Swedish: Enare) is a village in the municipality of the same name in Finnish Lapland, on the shore of Lake Inari. The village is an administrative and cultural centre of the Sami people in Finland (but not of the municipality itself). The lake, its surroundings and some other destinations in the municipality are also covered in this article.


Understand[edit]
Winter in the village of Inari.
Because Inari is 300 km north of the Arctic Circle, there is Midnight sun from late May to late July and Polar Night from the beginning of December to middle January. The last ice within the lake disappear at the end of May. Even in July, the average day temperature is only about 17°C. Inari municipality is the largest municipality in Finland by area covering 5 % of the country, stretching from the Norwegian border in the west to the Norwegian and Russian borders in the east. There are less than 7,000 inhabitants though. The municipality got road connection when the road to Petsamo – connection to the Arctic Sea – was accomplished in 1931. 
Four languages are spoken in Inari: Finnish, Northern Sámi, Inari Sami, and Skolt Sami. Inari Sami is the language traditionally used in the surroundings of the lake. Northern Sami is the biggest Sami language, spread with large scale reindeer husbandry and acts as the lingua franca among the Sami people around the whole Nordic. The Skolt Sami people were evacuated from Petsamo (Russian: Pechenga) when Finland lost that area in the World War II, and the people were resettled into the Inari municipality.
Ivalo (40 km south) is the administrative centre of the municipality and the biggest village with some 4,000 inhabitants. Inari is the second (1,000 inhabitants) and houses the Sami parliament, the Sami cultural centre, Finland's National Sami Museum, and the 68.900926.99871 Sami Education Institute (SOGSAKK) a vocational school and a training centre giving education both in Finnish and in the three local Sami languages. SOGSAKK is also one of those few places where anyone can study Sami languages and Sami culture.
Other villages include Angeli, Kaamanen, Lisma, Nellim, Näätämö, Saariselkä, and Sevettijärvi. There are parts of two national parks (Lemmenjoki and UKK) and six wilderness areas (Muotkatunturit, Paistunturi, Kaldoaivi, Vätsäri, Tsarmitunturi, and Hammastunturi) in the municipality. Lake Inari is the third largest lake in size in Finland but there are 8,000 other lakes here as well.

Lake Inari (Finnish: Inarijärvi, Northern Sami: Anárjávri, Inari Sami: Aanaarjävri, Skolt Sami: Aanarjäuʹrr) is the largest lake in Lapland and the 12th in Europe; about 40 x 80 km. The deepest point is 92 m. More than half of its area is not open water but a labyrinth of more than 3300 islands. The lake is a popular fishing destination, trout, Arctic char and grayling being the main catch. Sightseeing cruises start from the village. The lake starts to freeze in late October, and there may be still some ice left in June. The surface water temperature remains virtually always under +20°C.

An old legend tells that once a local man sought shelter during a snowstorm and found the opening under the stone. Next morning when he woke up he realized he had been sleeping next to a bear, hence the name. This huge stone high on a hill is actually almost hollow making it one of the weirdest places around. The stone itself is a glacial erratic and the geological name of this kind of void is "tafoni". The entrance into the stone is via a small opening close to the ground, inside the stone there is enough room for several people standing. Unfortunately not suitable for disabled: 200 m through the forest, mostly by stairs. The forest behind the hill has never been subject to logging and some pines are over 700 years old. There is a café by the parking lot. free. 
Do[edit]
Jäniskoski Rapids of Juutuanjoki in August 2022
Lake Inari is ideal for fishing, canoeing/kayaking and boating: you are mostly alone and maybe won't meet any person for weeks. The landscape is very nice because of the islands, but prepare for lots of mosquitoes. There are a number of open wilderness huts, lapp pole tents, and cabins for rent on the islands. For boating you need the Lake Inarijärvi yachting chart[dead link] (Inarijärven veneilykartta; chart no 480).
Canoes and bikes can be rented from the shop next to Hotel Inari. There are "sea kayaking" routes on the lake, and the Juutuanjoki for those preferring whitewater (but the Jäniskoski rapids have to be portaged; a memorial by the shore for one who thought he'll manage but drowned as he thought he had made it a little too early). It is possible to come by canoe all the way from Kultasatama in Lemmenjoki National Park (about 70 km, most of it more easy/quiet canoeing).
There are also opportunities for horse riding and sleigh riding with huskies, depending on the season.
There are many nature and hiking trails in the area.

Nature trails:
Oi Juutua! telling about people, events and fishing. 7.5 km, starting point by the bridge in the village.
Snowshoe Trail, telling about snow, 1.3 km, starting at the mouth of the Juutuanvuono Fjord.
Five Senses Nature Trail, telling about the history and nature, tough, unmarked but with GPS coordinates.
Other trails:
Inari – Otsamo Trail, 9 km. The trail goes by the river through old pine forest, passes the fell birch zone to the treeless 68.884226.83817 Otsamo fell top at 418 m. Great view from the top. Start from Siida or Jäniskoski (where you can get by car or by the Juutua trail). There is also a shorter trail (3 km) to the fell top from the Otsamo/Rovajärvi parking area.
Pielpajärvi Wilderness Church Trail, see above
There are also cross country skiing tracks, biking trails and snowmobile tracks in the area.

 Lake & Snow Inari, ☏ +358 16 671-108. Cruises, fishing trips and snowmobile safaris. (updated Nov 2019)
The 68.759226.23761 Lemmenjoki National Park is nearby (45 km), the largest National Park in Finland, and, according to Metsähallitus, "one of the whole Europe’s most extensive uninhabited and roadless backwoods". The park can partly be explored by riverboat, but there are also marked trails and wilderness huts as well as rental huts, and a vast backcountry. The park borders to Øvre Anárjohka National Park in Norway.
Also nearby is the 68.968826.62072 Muotkatunturit Wilderness Area, "literally a wilderness area" according to Metsähallitus. There are no marked trails, few wilderness huts or other facilities in the wilderness area itself – and phones are out of signal except on fell tops. Experience and adequate equipment are needed, but the terrain is quite easy. Suitable for hiking and cross-country skiing, for those who enjoy the silence. A few places are more frequented, such as the Stuorraäytsi canyon.
At the south-eastern shore of lake Inari, there is the Nellim village, with an orthodox church. Nearby (5–7 km) there is infrastructure from the war (Rautaportti, "iron gate"), and a restored log-floating flume. 30 km farther is the common border point between Finland, Norway and Russia (guided tours offered; mind the border zone if going by yourselves, the border point itself is reachable without permits by a long hike around the border zone and along the Norwegian side of the border).
At the eastern end of the lake, past Nellim in the south and Sevettijärvi in the north, is the roadless Vätsäri Wilderness Area, part of the  Pasvik-Inari Trilateral Park. Rugged landscape with a mosaic of pine forests, mires and a labyrinth of the lakes. The Piilola trail through the area leads to Øvre Pasvik National Park in Norway (a rather special shortcut to Kirkenes). The trail is marked and there are wilderness huts, but hiking experience is needed as you are on your own here.
