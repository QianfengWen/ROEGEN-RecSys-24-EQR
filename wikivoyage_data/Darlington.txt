Understand[edit]
"Nothing remarkable but dirt" - Daniel Defoe's impression of town in the 18th century
To the Anglo-Saxons this was Dearthington, "the settlement of Deornoth's people", but the Normans shortened it to Derlington. It was a small market town until the dawn of the railway age: on 27 Sept 1825 Stephenson's steam locomotive hauled passengers through town on the inaugural run from Shildon to Stockton. Thus began 200 glorious years of railway cut-backs, as after that ceremonial run the passengers had to make do with horse-drawn coaches, while the steam loco hauled more profitable coal. Darlington then grew into a railway town, with three large works, all of which closed down in the 1960s. The swansong was 60613 Tornado, a 4-6-2 Peppercorn Pacific steam loco built from 1994 to 2008 to 1948 designs, modified to incorporate modern braking, signalling and other essentials for main line working. Darlington continues to have a large engineering sector, mixed with telecoms, other light industry, services and local government.
