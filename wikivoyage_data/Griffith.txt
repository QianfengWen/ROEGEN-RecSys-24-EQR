Griffith is a city in the southwestern Riverina region of New South Wales.  Griffith is a city of immigration and irrigation.  Developed by Italian immigrants after the Second World War, watered by the Murrumbidgee and the Snowy Mountains Scheme, Griffith is an agricultural centre for fruits, wines, and rice.  Due to irrigation, the areas are more intensively farmed than much of New South Wales, with many small farms close to the town.


Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
-34.251667146.0666671 Griffith airport (GFF  IATA) (around 5km from the city centre). A small airport. The terminal and surround have been renovated, and there are daily flights from Sydney.   
You can rent a car from the terminal. Hertz, Avis and Thrifty operate from the terminal - but make sure you have the car booked and confirmed in advance if you expect someone to be there to meet you. As with many of these country depots, it can pay to give them a call locally rather than just doing the normal website booking.
You can also get a taxi into town. Call the 131 800 national number.

Regional Express flying from Sydney several times a day.
By train[edit]
NSW TrainLink run a direct train service linking Sydney to Griffith on Wednesdays and Saturdays, returning on Thursdays and Sundays.  The train travels for most of the day, so it isn't practical to take a train trip from Sydney for the weekend.  Other days there is a coach connection to meet with the Sydney and Melbourne XPT service at Wagga Wagga.  The railway station is two blocks north of the town centre, within easy walking distance of the town centre.  The coach connection stops in the town and at the station.
V-Line run a daily coach service connecting with the train at Shepparton.  It arrives in Griffith around midnight, before turning around and heading back towards Shepparton in the early hours of the morning.
