Maumere is in Flores, Indonesia.


Get in[edit]
Maumere is a small town both in geography and population.

By plane[edit]
-8.640556120.8333331 Frans Xavier Seda Airport (MOF  IATA Indonesian: Bandar Udara Wai Oti, also known as Wai Oti Airport or Maumere Airport) (3 km out of town). Maumere is linked by air with regular flights from Kupang/Timor's El Tari Airport (KOE IATA). and Denpasar's Ngurah Rai International Airport (DPS IATA). 3 companies fly to here, Batavia & Lion Air. All flights eventually end up in Bali, either via Kupang, Sumba or Labuanbajo, so together there is at least 1 flight every day from Bali.   
An ojek from the airport to anywhere shouldn't be more than Rp 5,000. If you walk the 500 m to the main road there are plenty of bemos to take you into town, but it's doubtful you will get that far before a reasonably priced private transport provider offers a low price you can't say no to.

By boat[edit]
Pelni has ships to Makassar and Kupang every 2 weeks. The schedule keeps changing and even the local Pelni office has given up planning more than 2 weeks ahead. Tickets can be bought from the local Pelni office near the port on the road to Wailiti and Gading Beach Hotels.

By bus[edit]
Buses to Ende, stopping in Moni start from the west bus terminal a fair way out of town. Have your hotel arrange the transport for you, and they will come and pick you up. As always, the bus will circle the town until full. You can get as far as Bajawa in a single day, but that is a 15-hr drive. Buses to Labuanbajo will stop in Bajawa for 1 night.
Buses from Moni to Ende sometimes stop in the centre of Maumere - not at the terminals - and some might even take you to your hotel, if you already know where you want to stay.

Get around[edit]
8°37′7″S 122°13′7″EMap of Maumere
It seems everyone is an Ojek, and will take you anywhere for around Rp 5,000. Gading Beach Hotel 10 km from the centre will cost you 5,000 Rp. Bemos charge Rp 1,000 around town and Rp 3,000 outside.
Renting a scooter for one day will cost you approximately Rp 100,000.

See[edit]
There are rumours about caves and hot springs, but this remains to be seen. The beaches outside of town are nice enough to spend a day or two on, but it's better to simply choose one and stay there instead of the town.

Do[edit]
Water sports[edit]
 Diving. The waters off nearby Pulau Besar has good reefs for snorkeling and diving. Unfortunately, the dive centres don't get many customers and will only leave with 2 or more guests, so single divers will get a tough time buddying up. Prices hover around US$75-80 for a day with 2 dives, full equipment and lunch. Operators are found at Ankermi, "Blue Crystal Dive Trip", Sea World Club or Wailiti Beach Hotel. 
 Snorkelling. Most hotels have snorkel gear you can rent (or simply borrow). You will have to go pretty far out from the shore to get to the reefs, but the currents are not too strong in this area so you should be alright if you are a decent swimmer. Check with your hotel for the best spot - or arrange a boat tour with a local fisherman (around Rp 450,000 for the day). 
 Jetski / Banana boat. Wailiti Hotel offers thrillseeking fun on the banana boat, if you really want to get into the holiday spirit. Rp 150,000-200,000.. 
Buy[edit]
There are tons of ATMs in Maumere accepting international credit cards.

Pasar Alok. Weekly market happening on Tuesdays. Stalls with fruit, vegetables, second hand clothes, traditional textiles (Tanon Ikat). Locals from the mountains and other villages come to sell their goods.
Pasar Wairkoja. Weekly market happening on Fridays.
Toko Daur Ulang (part of Pantai Paris Homestay). Shop selling various recycled and upcycled products made by the local community and disabled people.
Eat[edit]
There are plenty of Warungs around the centre, offering all the usual suspects. Restaurants of the kind you would associate with candle light dinners does not exist. Outside the town you are at the mercy of the restaurants at your hotel, so check them out before checking in.

 Warung Jakarta (by the port). has fresh fish and seafood at reasonable prices in big portions. 
 Warung Dahlia (near the Church, 500 meters inland from the port). Cheap and popular with the locals, this place serves all the usual suspects; soto ayam, nasi campur, ikan bakar. If it's Indonesian they have it. Everything is cooked fresh. 
 Golden Fish. Up market, and highly recommended fish restaurant. Choose your live fish, crab or lobster from the tank and wait while they steam, grill or fry it for you. 
 My Bread Bakery (just around the corner from Gardena Hotel). The proximity to Gardena Hotel and the heavy amounts of chocolate used in the baked goods here make it a bad combination for your diet. However, once in a while you should allow yourself to indulge in the goodies. You can buy bread, cakes, burgers or mini-pizzas for eating in or take-away. 
 Roxy Supermarket (near the Post Office). The well-stocked, low-priced Roxy is a good place to stock up on essentials for the 24-hr boat ride to Makassar. 
Drink[edit]
Maumere is a port town. Port towns mean sailors, and sailors mean alcohol and prostitution. The karaoke bars outside of town make up the venues that often combine the two. However, regardless of your intentions, there is much fun to have while loudly reading random Indonesian words from a TV monitor into a microphone while music is playing - also known as karaoke.

 Libra Karaoke. 
 Bintang Disco and Karaoke.
