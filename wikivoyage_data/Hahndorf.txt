Hahndorf in the Adelaide Hills region and is Australia's oldest surviving German settlement. Hahndorf has plenty of souvenir shops, craft outlets and galleries to explore. There's still a strong German flavour in the town, most evident in the small good outlets and German bakeries that line the main street. Visitors can pick their own strawberries at Beerenberg Strawberry Farm or visit the former home and studio of Sir Hans Heysen, The Cedars. There are several good winery cellar doors in the area and the Hahndorf Farm Barn is an enjoyable stop for families. 


Understand[edit]
A sign in German – hot dogs, anyone?
History[edit]
The town was settled by Lutheran migrants largely from in and around a small village then named Kay in Prussia and now known as Kije, Lubusz Voivodeship in Poland. Many of the settlers arrived aboard the Zebra on 28 December 1838. The town is named after Dirk Meinerts Hahn, the Danish captain of the Zebra. 

Early German settlers[edit]
During the British colonisation of South Australia, the settlers were mostly British, but some German "Old Lutherans" also emigrated in the early years. The first large group of Germans arrived in 1838, with the financial assistance of the Emigration Fund. Most moved out of Adelaide and to the Barossa Valley and settlements in the Hills such as Hahndorf, living in socially closed communities, by 1842, and did not participate in government until 15 years later.

Respect[edit]
Hahndorf is not a part of Adelaide, and like other towns in the orbit of a bigger city, doesn't like being conflated with the nearby city rather than recognised for its own identity.
