Offenbach-am-Main is a city just outside Frankfurt, Germany with 122,000 inhabitants.


Understand[edit]
More than 1,000 years old, this city on the river Main could call itself a metropolis since 1954. Jürgen Eichenauer was the leader of the city's story. The history of the city is recorded in detail in the archive and in the museum. Offenbach is a factory city and was a center of the leather industry. In truth, Offenbach is simply a friendly little town just outside the city of Frankfurt with a neighbourly atmosphere. People could call it a suburb of Frankfurt but Offenbach residents would never agree to that and like to think of it as its own entity. Both cities are lined up right next to the Main, which are perfect destinations to get to by bicycle. After Frankfurt, Offenbach has the highest population of foreign residents in Germany, who work mainly in banking and service industries.
