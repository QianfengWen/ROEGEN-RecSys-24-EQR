Villach is a town  in the Carinthia province of Austria. It has about 62,000 inhabitants (2018). Villach is the second-largest city of Carinthia and a railway gateway to most parts of Austria as well as the Italian border. 


Understand[edit]
Its carnival is broadcast on public television throughout Austria.
It's quite old, with roots back in Roman times (when the city was called Santicum). The city was heavily bombed in World War II, destroying many parts of the city.

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
Villach is a railway hub for Austria, so trains converge from most other big cities including Vienna, Graz, Klagenfurt, Salzburg, Linz, Innsbruck and Bregenz. There are also direct connections to Munich, Zurich, Venice, Ljubljana, Zagreb and Belgrade. Several sleeper trains stop en route to destinations such as Florence, Milan, Munich, Rome, Stuttgart, and Zurich. However, Villach is a mid-point for these journeys, so departure times are after midnight.
Optima Express runs a car-train between Villach and Edirne in western Turkey two or three times a week April-November, taking 33 hours. Departure days vary. This train enables motorists to take their own cars to Turkey while avoiding the tricky, tiring roads through the Balkans, and it's also open for passengers without cars. It's one of the cheaper ways to retrace the old Orient Express in the modern day.

Get around[edit]
46°36′53″N 13°49′48″EMap of Villach

It's a quite small town, so it is easy to get around on foot. Taxis can be found near the railway station and in the centre of the city near Hauptplatz. Federal buses go to the surrounding area from the local Busbahnhof (busterminal, a few minutes away from the railway station).
Local busline no.10 (operated by a company called Kowatsch) goes around the historic city centre.
Getting around by car can be tiring since parking space is rare during weekdays and traffic jams at business hours are very common. During weekdays parking fees are charged in most areas around the centre of the city.

Faakersee
46.5655613.784092 Schütt located in the south of mountain Dobratsch, an area with huge stone rocks, which are parts of Dobratsch itself after an earthquake back in the 14th century caused half of the mountain to fall into the surrounding area.
46.693313.91583 Gerlitzen is a mountain and small ski resort located half an hour from Villach. The skiing is nothing special but Gerlitzen offers some of the best vistas in Austria. On clear days almost the whole of Carinthia can be seen from this mountain top. You can either drive up (take care in winter) or take the cable car. From the parking space/cable car station it's an hour's walk to the summit. The cable car station at the mountain's base at 46.659413.90154 Annenheim can be reached by bus or train, including S-Bahn line S2 from the Villach main station.
46.546613.90315 Burgruine Finkenstein  are the scenic remains of a castle built in the 12th century. Has great views. Today it is used as location for musical events.
The Soca/Isonzo valley in Slovenia is about an hour's drive from Villach over the Predil mountain pass via Italy. Its deep limestone gorges offer a spectacular scenery and its emerald-coloured rivers are famed for some of the best kayaking and white water rafting in Europe. Since the Soca valley is actually easier to reach from Villach and Klagenfurt than Ljubljana (Slovenia's capital) it's well worth a day trip if you're hanging around Carinthia for longer. Head for the town Bovec, the touristic centre of the Soca valley.
47.19805612.1713896 Krimml Waterfalls , on the border of Salzburg and Tyrol, is the largest of Austria.

From here towards the Zillertal and over the Gerloss-pass to the waterfall. Then back to Carinthia. As a daytrip only with your own transportation.
