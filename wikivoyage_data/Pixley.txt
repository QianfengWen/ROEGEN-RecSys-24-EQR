Understand[edit]
History[edit]
The town began as a real-estate-speculation in 1884. Frank Pixley was a partner in the Pixley Townsite Company. The company purchased additional land in the vicinity. When the Southern Pacific extended its tracks to the townsite, the town prospered. Special railroad fares were offered to people in other areas of California and as far away as Boston in order to bring potential customers to see the new lands and the investment possibilities near Pixley.
In the early 1890s, Chris Evans and John Sontag robbed a Southern Pacific Railroad train at Pixley.
In 1933, Pixley was one of the towns in California involved in the San Joaquin cotton strike, a labor action by agricultural workers seeking higher wages. A violent clash between strikers and growers left two workers dead and eight wounded. Five thousand workers gathered in Tulare for the dead strikers' funerals, one of the largest agricultural demonstrations in California's history. Eight cotton growers were indicted in the violence against the workers, but were later acquitted.

35.9192-119.3761 Pixley National Wildlife Refuge (from SR-99 take exit 56 5.7 miles west), ☏ +1 661 725-2767. This wildlife refuge is the winter home to up to 6000 sandhill cranes from September to March, with numbers peaking in January. The refuge's habitat also supports a variety of raptors and waterbirds, accessible via a single 1.5-mile loop trail that leads to an overlook of the wetlands. Visitors hoping to see cranes should use their ears as much as their eyes - the cranes have a distinctive call, and will often be found outside of the refuge in nearby fields during daylight hours.
