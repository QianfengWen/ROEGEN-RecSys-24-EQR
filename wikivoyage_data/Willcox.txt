Chiricahua National Monument
Fort Bowie National Historic Site is an oddity in the United States National Park System, in that you must hike cross-country to get to it rather than just driving. The parking area is reachable via the Apache Pass road southeast of Willcox. The ruins of an old fort are about a three-mile (round trip) hike from the parking area (bring plenty of water).
