Dalaman is a resort town in Lycia on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey. The town and surrounding district had a population of 43,036 in 2020. 
In tourist literature, "Dalaman" can refer to any of the resorts served by Dalaman airport, the largest being Dalyan and Marmaris west, and Fethiye east, described on their own pages. Dalaman town itself is a workaday nondescript place, but there's a beach and cluster of hotels at Sarıgerme 10 km south. 


Understand[edit]
This area is rugged, but the small Dalaman river has carved out a fertile plain, so around town is agricultural - one notable landowner was Abbas II the last Ottoman ruler of Egypt and Sudan. Dalaman town was (and remains) an insignificant market centre, until western tourism to Turkey got going from the 1970s. The flat plain was an obvious site for an airport, so this was built just south of town to open in 1981. It's been upgraded since, with the second terminal opening in 2018, and has boosted tourism along a 200 km stretch of coastline that had previously involved a long coach transfer from airports such Izmir or Antalya. (Milas-Bodrum airport gave a similar boost to resorts further north.) Dalaman's own resort strip of Sarıgerme is small, so most tourists who book holidays marketed as "Dalaman" will be whisked away by their package coaches and never set foot here.

See[edit]
Ruined baths of Hamam Bay
Dalaman town is modern. The central mosque (Merkez Cami) is in traditional style but only built in 1991, and Düç Mosque west end of main street is similar.
36.767628.79531 "Railway Station" is really the State Farm offices, Tarım İşletmesi Müdürlüğü, but a modern myth tells that it's a station built by mistake, hundreds of km away from any railway. Abbās Ḥilmī Pāshā (1874-1944) was the last Khedive of Egypt and Sudan (the hereditary Ottoman viceroy) and owned vast tracts of farmland around Dalaman. In 1905 he supposedly commissioned a hunting lodge here plus a railway station in Alexandria, and the plans and materials got swopped. Some versions of the legend add a stretch of railway track leading nowhere. The building is a fine late Ottoman mansion that doesn't remotely resemble a railway station (look at that tiny main door, and where's the clocktower?) and Alexandria already had two sturdy stations by that date. Abbās was a better farmer than a statesman, establishing model farms in Egypt; he probably intended the same here and that is what the building has become. But he antagonised the British, who side-lined him and then deposed him in 1914 when the Ottomans allied with Germany in the First World War.
36.749728.83072 Şerefler village lies below the hilltop ancient city of Kalynda. The ruins are scrappy and you'll probably need a local guide to find them.
36.640528.8553 Haman Bay is a tranquil lagoon and nature reserve south of Sarsala beach. There's no road access, but it's a popular spot for boat trips. The sand is composed of ooids: spherical limestone crystals, like miniature pearls, that grow by accretion. The ruined hamam is also known as Cleopatra's Bath, because of a legend that Mark Antony constructed it and the beach for her - similar ooids are found in Egypt. It's equally likely that he was really trying to build a railway station.
Twelve Islands are the archipelago beyond the bay in the Gulf of Göcek, reached by boat trip from Sarıgerme beach or Göcek.
