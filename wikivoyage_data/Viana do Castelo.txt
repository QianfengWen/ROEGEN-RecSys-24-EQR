Understand[edit]




The Legend of Rio Lima

It is said that when the Roman legions arrived in the first century C.E. at the falls of the Lima River, they were so taken aback with the landscape that they thought they were at the gates of paradise, with the River Lethe, the famed river of forgetfulness at their feet. The men refused to take another step. The then Councilor who accompanied them charged ahead and crossed it alone. He was then only able to convince the others it was safe by calling out the name of each and every man, to prove that the river hadn't caused him to forget everything.


A view of the city.

Viana do Castelo (vee-UH-nuh doo kuhsh-TEH-loo, /vi.ˈɐ.nɐ du kɐʃ.ˈte.ɫu/) is the capital of a municipality with 314.36 km2 (121.38 sq mi) and has some 36,750 inhabitants. The municipality borders the municipality of Caminha in the north, the municipality of Ponte de Lima in the east, the municipalities of Barcelos and Esposende in the south and the Atlantic Ocean in the west. The city's origins date back to before the Christian era, as it can be seen in the hill fort near the Basilica of Santa Luzia. It received its first foral from King Afonso III of Portugal in 1258, as well as the name Viana da Foz do Lima, because of its geographic location; in 1848 it became a city by a decree of Maria II of Portugal, and received the name of Viana do Castelo.
