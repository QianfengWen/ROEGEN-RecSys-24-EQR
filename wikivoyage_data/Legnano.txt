Legnano[dead link] is a city in Milan Province, in the Lombardy region of Italy, about 20 km from downtown Milan. It is crossed by the river Olona (fiume Olona), and is home to 60,000 people (2021). Thanks to the historic Battle of Legnano, Legnano is the only town, in addition to Rome, named in the Italian national anthem. Every year Legnanesi remember this battle with the Palio di Legnano.


Understand[edit]
From 1820 to 1915, with the introduction of numerous textile and mechanical companies, Legnano grew from an agricultural to an industrial center. Most of the textile industries closed in the 1960s: today the services sector is the most thriving one.
