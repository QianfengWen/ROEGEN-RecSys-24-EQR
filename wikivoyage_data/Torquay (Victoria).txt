Torquay is a city in Victoria, Australia. Renowned for its beaches, it is a popular seaside destination along the Great Ocean Road and a must-see for any avid surfer or any traveller looking for a beachside getaway.


Understand[edit]
Located at the eastern end of the Great Ocean Road, Torquay is a famous surfing spot, with Quiksilver and Rip Curl headquartered here and Bells Beach just around the corner.

Get in[edit]
Torquay is 97 km south of Melbourne, 22 km south of Geelong and 253 km east of Warrnambool at the other end of the Great Ocean Road.
Torquay is serviced by the V/Line coach between Geelong and Apollo Bay, which runs four times a day each direction on weekdays and two times on weekends, connecting to rail services from Melbourne at Geelong Station. Alternatively, Route 50 (map) and 51 (map) operate between Geelong Station and Jan Juc, a suburb in the south of Torquay, via Marshall Station in Geelong's south. These services operate more frequently, about every hour, although stop more frequently so have a slightly longer travel time.

Routes 50 and 51 between Geelong and Jan Juc form the town's only public transport, as an extension of Geelong's bus network (map). Both routes largely follow the same route down the Surf Coast Highway, although Route 50 diverts to serve the north-eastern area of Torquay, including The Sands Resort. A map is available on the PTV website.
