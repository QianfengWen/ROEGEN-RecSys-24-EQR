Map of Portsmouth (Rhode Island)
Though it is on an island, Portsmouth is most readily accessible from RI Rt. 138.
Avoid the traffic on West Main Road by taking a left onto Access Road (next to a Courtyard Marriott) and follow. Go down a hill and take a slight right onto Defense Road. Follow until taking a sharp right ontp Stringham Road, which will bring you back up to West Main Road. By taking this quiet, scenic road, you bypass traffic and the commercialized portion of West Main Road.

Get around[edit]
As it is a small, quaint town, it is easiest to get around Portsmouth by car. Unlike a more metropolitan city which can easily be navigated on foot or by public transportation, Portsmouth is far too rural and suburban to rely on these types of transportation.
The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) does, however, have buses running to and from Portsmouth.
