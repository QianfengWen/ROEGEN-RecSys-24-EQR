The "beach promenade" of Võru
Võru[dead link] is a city in Southern Estonia. The surrounding Võrumaa (Võru county) covers 2,305 km².


Understand[edit]
The Võro language ("võro kiil") is the main language spoken but Estonian is universally spoken as well. Russian and English are also understood by many people. Despite the picturesque location on the shore of the lake, Võru does not inhibit much of a medieval history. The central landmark is the cosy house-museum of Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald, the collector of the Estonian epic poetry and one of the founders of Estonian literature. From 1944 to 1953, the Estonian Forest Brothers (anti-Soviet partisans) were most active in Võru County.

57.8438126.997481 Kreutzwald House Museum, Kreutzwaldi 31, ☏ +372 7821798. Apr-Sep W-Su 10-18:00, Oct-Mar W-Su 10-17:00. The founder of Estonian literature, Friedrich Kreutzwald, was born in a peasant family near Rakvere, and studied medicine at the University of Tartu. He practised medicine for 44 years in Võru, simultaneously writing about the situation of the Estonian peasantry and collecting Estonian folklore. The most famous work of Kreutzwald was the collection of the Estonian epic poetry, Kalevipoeg. In addition, Kreutzwald was actively creating a single Estonian language (in exchange for dissimilar northern and southern adverbs) and introducing it into public life.Even if you are unfamiliar with the person and works of Kreutzwald, going to the museum will be interesting. In addition to the household—the main house with interiors, a bathhouse, and a barn—there is a historical and literary side to it. To the left of the entrance there is a detailed and very informative exposition on the life of the writer, with information in Estonian and Russian languages. In one of the sheds, a collection of publications of Kalevipoeg and illustrations can be found. All very cosy and feels somewhat at home. The presenters will be happy to talk with you in a variety of languages, including English. €4. (updated Oct 2022)
57.8485226.995062 The Church of Catharina (Katariina kirik), Jüri 9. This Lutheran Church was built in 1788-93 with the support of the Catherine II. The architectural style was probably chosen with her help, because the church strikingly resembles the Latvian monuments of the Baroque style. Pay attention to the multi-tiered clock tower. On the square in front of the church stands a stone memorial for those killed on an Estonia ferry. Impressive due to a hand stretching out of the stone for help. 
57.8483326.997663 The Church of Catherine (Ekaterina kirik), Lembitu 1. Same time, similar origins. All churches of Võru were sponsored by Catherine II, taking care of the integration of the Baltic states into the Russian Empire. This church contains a high and narrow drum stuck in the middle of the nave resembles an inedible mushroom. However, the church looks a little disproportionate.

57.8468126.980785 Suspension bridge (Roosisaarele viiv rippsild), Tamula / Roosisaare sild (in the northern part of the city). This modern construction has become a main attraction, maybe due to the lack of other sights. The bridge leads through the swamp to the opposite shore, where there was a settlement during the Stone Age. Pleasantly swaying under the feet, and at night beautifully highlighted. 
57.84152327.0019366 Eduard Tamm Memorial. Born 16 May 1879 in Narva and deceased 18 May 1941 in Võru. He was an Estonian composer, who laid the foundation for the original wind instrument.
