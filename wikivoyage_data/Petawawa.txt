Petawawa (population 18,000 in 2021) is the largest town in eastern Ontario's Ottawa Valley. Petawawa is on the south shore of the Ottawa River, and exists primarily to support the CFB Petawawa military base. The town can serve as a gateway to the eastern parts of Algonquin Park, but Petawawa also offers canoeing opportunities in-town, on the Ottawa and Petawawa Rivers.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Emerald Necklace Trail and the Petawawa River
The earliest settlement in the Petawawa area was inhabited by the Algonquin First Nation. The name Petawawa originates from a local Algonquin language word, biidaawewe, meaning "where one hears a noise like this".
In the late 19th century, the area was surveyed and settled by emigres from Scotland, Ireland and Germany. The land was unsuitable for crops, but the heavily forested surroundings were useful for logging. The Canadian military acquired land in the area in 1905, which later became Canadian Forces Base Petawawa. An internment camp was set up at the Militia Camp in Petawawa from December 1914 to May 1916; it also housed German prisoners-of-war during World War II.
CFB Petawawa is one of Canada's largest ground forces bases with members deployed throughout the world on various missions supporting the United Nations in peacekeeping or the War on Terror.

Climate[edit]
Petawawa has a humid continental climate with long, cold, snowy winters and warm summers.
