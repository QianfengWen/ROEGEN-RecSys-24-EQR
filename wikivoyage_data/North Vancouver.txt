North Vancouver is a mostly suburban area across the Burrard Inlet from downtown Vancouver. Surrounded by mountains and water on three sides, it's the ideal playground for the outdoor-minded. You can wander on miles of hiking trails (or test yourself on Nature's stairmaster), take in steep descents on a mountain bike or skis, kayak a fjord and cross canyons on a suspension bridge. If you're not looking for something that gets the heart going, there are always the stellar views the city affords. Ride the gondola to the top of Grouse Mountain for a view of Vancouver and beyond, stroll along the waterfront by Lonsdale Quay or relax in one of the many coffee shops. And that's one of the great things about North Vancouver — it's close to the sophistication offered by Vancouver but in 30 minutes you can be in the wilderness or a beautiful spot like Deep Cove and forget you're in a metropolitan area of over two million people.


Understand[edit]
The Wallace Shipyards — once one of the city's largest employers, now a public gathering place
The history and culture of North Vancouver is largely shaped by its geography and climate. Drawing on the frequent rain and temperate climate, the slopes of the Coastal Mountains were forested with massive trees and lush vegetation. The streams and rivers cascading down the mountains were ideal sources of salmon and the forests had abundant wildlife. The first inhabitants of the area, the Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh peoples, had a number of villages and camps on the shores of Burrard Inlet and relied on the rivers and forests for food and resources.
The same giant trees attracted European settlers, who started arriving in the mid 1800s. Logging became the principle industry and for a stretch of time in the late 1800s, the sale of logs from the Moodyville mill in North Vancouver was one of British Columbia's largest sources of export revenue.  By the early 1900s, most of the old growth forest had been chopped down and the industrial focus switched to shipbuilding. The North Vancouver shipyards were at their peak during World War II and the decades immediately following, and are estimated to have built half of Canada's wartime cargo vessels. Much of the old shipyards are gone now, but their story is still told in the Shipyards area close to Lonsdale Quay.
One thing any visitor to North Vancouver will notice is the mountains rising up behind the city. More than just a beautiful backdrop on a pretty postcard, the mountains are an attraction onto themselves. Grouse Mountain and Mount Seymour became popular in the 1920s and 30s with hikers and skiers. Chalets and cabins were built, followed by rope tows and chair lifts. Development has continued, with Mount Seymour now protected as a provincial park, while Grouse Mountain has become one of the Vancouver region's top tourist attractions with its views and year-round activities. The mountains were early hot-spots for and helped push snowboarding and mountain biking, and remain favorite locations for pro photo shoots. Many people choose to live in North Vancouver today for the easy access it provides to outdoor recreation.
North Vancouver is composed of two municipalities: the City of North Vancouver and the District of North Vancouver. The city is centred on Lonsdale Ave and is more dense and urban in character. The district is more suburban and is largely composed of single-family homes. The distinction between the two is irrelevant for travellers, and most locals would have a difficult time telling you where the city ends and the district begins (it's all just "North Vancouver"). However, if you get a parking ticket or need to visit one of the city halls, make sure to check which one — city or district — you need to go to.
Together with its neighbour West Vancouver, North Vancouver is part of a local regional grouping referred to as the North Shore municipalities, or simply "the North Shore".

Climate and when to go[edit]
The weather in North Van follows what happens in Vancouver, with sunny dry summers (July & Aug) and wet winters (Nov-Mar). The proximity of the mountains does influence the local weather though, with somewhat more rain and less sunshine than Vancouver. There's also more snow the further up the mountain you go. All of this will often be irrelevant to visitors, but if you are planning on hiking or skiing in the mountains, be aware the weather may be quite different than what you see in Lonsdale Quay, or can change quickly, so be prepared.
It's hard to pin down when is a best time to visit North Vancouver (and the region as a whole). The main attractions like Grouse Mountain and the suspension bridges are open year-round, as are hikes at lower elevations. If you have your heart set on doing the Grouse Grind or back-country hikes, then May-Oct are when they are open. The local ski hills are normally open from Dec to early/mid April, while kayaking and Deep Cove are at their best May through Sept.

North Vancouver - Main roads and Attractions


See Vancouver for a listing of options to reach the Vancouver area by plane, by ferry, by intercity bus, and by intercity rail.

By car[edit]
If you're coming from anywhere other than downtown Vancouver, driving is probably the easiest way to get to North Vancouver. From downtown, the Lion's Gate Bridge (Highway 99) provides a scenic although sometimes congested entrance point. Highway 1 (Trans-Canada Highway) and the Second Narrows Bridge (also called the Ironworkers Memorial Bridge) generally moves better. Both bridges slow down significantly during rush hour on weekdays; traffic can backup on weekend afternoons, as well.

By train[edit]
Rocky Mountaineer has a station in North Vancouver, which is served by the train to Jasper via Whistler and Quesnel in the summer months. This is a luxury service aimed squarely at tourists who wish to enjoy the scenery at a leisurely pace, and not a practical option for travel.

Get around[edit]
Car and bus are both convenient ways to get around North Vancouver, although a car will generally be a little faster and more direct. Cycling is also possible with the network of bike lanes, but the terrain is hilly and the distance between attractions tends to be large, so a bike may not be the most efficient way to get around.

By road[edit]
Hwy 1, or the Upper Levels Highway, runs east-west from the Second Narrows Bridge to West Vancouver and provides quick transit across the city.  However, if you're going to see the attractions, you'll need to get off the highway.  Lonsdale Avenue runs north-south through the middle of the City of North Vancouver, while Capilano Road, Lynn Valley Road and Mount Seymour Parkway provide access to the areas above and east of the highway.  Many shops, restaurants and businesses are located along Marine Drive and Lonsdale Avenue. As with most cities, traffic on these roads can be busy at morning and evening rush hours. Parking is quite plentiful and usually free on the North Shore.

By public transit[edit]
 TransLink, ☏ +1-604-953-3333. Translink is the main public transit network in the Vancouver area, including: Burnaby, Coquitlam, Delta, Langley, Lions Bay, Maple Ridge, New Westminster, North Vancouver, Port Coquitlam, Pitt Meadows, Port Moody, Richmond, Surrey, West Vancouver, and White Rock. Its network includes buses, SkyTrain (rail rapid transit), SeaBus (ferries), West Coast Express (commuter rail), and HandyDART (door-to-door shared-ride service for those who cannot ride public transit without assistance).   (updated Mar 2022)
If your trip only involves the bus system, the standard adult fare is $3.15. Trips that combine the bus with either the SeaBus or Skytrain follow the normal three zone pricing system.
On the North Shore, the three transit hubs are Park Royal in West Vancouver, Lonsdale Quay in North Vancouver and Phibbs Exchange in North Vancouver. Buses run between each of these hubs and out to the various attractions and parts of the region (e.g., Grouse Mountain, Horseshoe Bay, and Deep Cove). Park Royal and Lonsdale Quay have buses that connect with downtown Vancouver while Phibbs Exchange has buses that connect with Vancouver and Burnaby. Travel within North and West Vancouver is considered one zone and costs $3.15.
The main bus routes of note to reach North Vancouver from other cities are:
R2 - RapidBus service that connects Lonsdale Quay (and the Seabus) with Phibbs Exchange and Park Royal. This is one of two bus routes that connect with West Vancouver bus routes.
28 - Connects North Van (at Phibbs Exchange) with the Millenium and Expo Skytrain routes (Gilmore and Joyce stations, respectively).
210 & 211 - Connects North Van and downtown Vancouver via Gastown, East Van and the Second Narrows Bridge. The bus routes continue on to Deep Cove with a stop at Phibbs Exchange for transfers to other North Van bus routes.
240 - Connects Lynn Valley, Central Lonsdale and Marine Dr with downtown Vancouver via the Lions Gate Bridge and the West End.
SeaBus is an easy, efficient, utilitarian option to travel between North Vancouver and downtown Vancouver. Departing from Waterfront Station downtown and Lonsdale Quay in North Vancouver, the passenger only ferry ride takes 12 minutes to cross the harbour and the big windows at the front and back provide great views of the North Shore mountains and the downtown Vancouver skyline. Departures are generally every 15 minutes until the 9PM departure from North Vancouver and the 9:15PM departure from Vancouver; after that it runs every half hour until last sailing. The SeaBus operates from 6:02AM to 1:22AM M-Sa, and from 8:02AM-11:16PM on Sunday and public holidays. Passage is considered two zones so the standard adult fare is $4.55 on weekdays until 6:30PM and $3.15 at other times. Cash is not accepted on the SeaBus so you must either buy a Compass ticket or Compass Card from the vending machines outside the SeaBus terminal or tap your credit card at the fare gate.
By taxi[edit]

By bicycle[edit]
The city has made a real effort to be more bicycle-friendly, enhancing existing bike lanes and building new separated lanes across some parts of the city. The network is particularly useful for getting from Lonsdale Quay/Lower Lonsdale to the Lions Gate Bridge but is less useful for getting to attractions at the edge of the city like Lynn Canyon, Grouse Mountain and Deep Cove. A map is available from the Translink website.

See[edit]
The North Shore mountains are a beautiful spot and much of the area's attractions are designed to capture that beauty or to take in what people have built to overcome the obstacles posed by the mountains. Grouse Mountain and the Capilano Suspension Bridge are the big attractions and popular with tour buses. To get a more local feel and North Shore experience, check out Deep Cove, Lynn Canyon or one of the parks listed below.

Lonsdale Quay and the Waterfront[edit]
The SeaBus arrives at Lonsdale Quay
Lonsdale Quay is a market, gathering place and transportation hub for North Vancouver, and often the starting point for exploring the city. The waterfront as a whole is still in development, but there are parks, public spaces, some history of the area and great views of the downtown Vancouver skyline.

49.31026-123.082171 Lonsdale Quay Market, 123 Carrie Cates Court (Adjacent to Lonsdale Quay SeaBus terminal and bus loop), ☏ +1 604-985-6261. 9AM-7PM. A bustling and popular market, especially around lunch and early afternoon. The first floor has a variety of shops, mostly selling tourist-oriented souvenirs of varying quality and tackiness. The second floor has a more eclectic variety of shops and boutiques, as well as a children's play area. The best value is the food options, with a diverse food court and a number of sweet smelling shops that entice with baked goods, sandwiches and treats. Climbing the steps outside to the revolving Q provides nice views across the harbour to downtown Vancouver.   (updated Aug 2022)
49.3103-123.08062 Polygon Gallery, 101 Carrie Cates Court (at the foot of Lonsdale on the waterfront), ☏ +1 604-986-1351. Tu-Su 10AM-5PM. Art gallery focusing on contemporary art.

49.31013-123.079873 The Shipyards (Shipyards Historic Precinct), Lonsdale Ave & Victory Ship Way (from Lonsdale Quay, head east on Carrie Cates Court past the Seaspan office to the red-roofed buildings that mark the entrance to the Shipyards). This is the site of what was once the largest shipyard in British Columbia. There are a number of displays that go through the history of shipbuilding on the North Shore, and Shipbuilders Square hosts community events throughout the year, including free summer concerts, a summer night market on Friday evenings and a Christmas market. For views of Vancouver, the Burrard Inlet and North Vancouver, head east along the waterfront to the 700 ft (210 m) Burrard Dry Dock Pier. (updated Aug 2022)
49.31185-123.085734 Waterfront Park, foot of Chesterfield Ave on the west side (from Lonsdale Quay, head west past the McDonald's and the SeaBus drop-off area (follow the Trans-Canada Trail signs)). Small park on the waterfront looking across to downtown Vancouver. There is a small Japanese garden, a gazebo on the water and lots of green space and benches to enjoy the view or have a picnic. The curvy bars in the middle of the park are an artist's interpretation of the North Shore mountains. The park also hosts a number of summer festivals including Canada Day activities and Caribbean Days.  (updated Jul 2016)
Grouse Mountain[edit]
The Grouse Mountain Skyride in action
49.38623-123.076085 Grouse Mountain  is an all-season attraction with a wide range of activities. The Skyride whisks you up the side of the mountain while providing views of Metro Vancouver and the North Shore Mountains. Up top, the 49.3793-123.08346 Grouse Mountain Chalet has three restaurants, two shops, viewing windows and Theatre in the Sky, which shows short films about the area. Immediately outside of the chalet, is the summer patio that becomes the 49.3797-123.08267 skating pond in winter. Beyond that are a number of fairly easy walking trails that lead to the Lumberjack Show, the Birds in Motion show and wildlife refuge area. There are a number of chainsaw-made wood carvings that are worth a look and on clear days you can catch a glimpse of Mt Baker.
From around April to October, trails are available to reach Grouse Mountain instead of taking the Skyride, which are covered in the Do section below. The Grouse Grind is only intended for one-way travel, up the mountain. Those who hike to the top can take the Grouse Mountain Skyride for $15 per descent.

49.3723-123.0998 Grouse Mountain Skyride, 6400 Nancy Greene Way (head north on Capilano Rd until it ends, or take bus #236 from Lonsdale Quay), ☏ +1 604-984-0661. Daily 9AM-10PM. The iconic ride up Grouse Mountain to the "Peak of Vancouver". The view is lovely although it can be quite cramped in the gondola when it's busy.

Capilano River attractions[edit]
The Capilano Suspension Bridge
The Capilano River and canyon, along North Vancouver's western side, serves a number of roles. It's a spawning ground for salmon, the reservoir above the dam provides a large portion of Metro Vancouver's drinking water, and it's a recreation area, including one of the city's biggest tourist attractions, Capilano Suspension Bridge.

49.3427-123.114411 Capilano Suspension Bridge, 3735 Capilano Rd (a few minutes north of Hwy 1 off Exit 14, or by bus #236 from Lonsdale Quay), ☏ +1 604-985-7474, fax: +1 604-985-7479, info@capbridge.com. Open daily June to Labour Day: 8AM - 8PM; winter: 9AM - 5PM (except Dec when it's 10AM - 9PM for the Canyon Lights); closed Dec 25. The largest of the two suspension bridges in the North Shore at 137 m across and sitting 70 m above the Capilano River, the Capilano Suspension Bridge offers visitors more than a wobbly walk. The area includes nature trails, Treetops (a series of elevated platforms near the tree canopy), Cliffwalk (a series of narrow platforms suspended over the edge of the canyon), a First Nations (Aboriginal) cultural centre and several restaurants. BC residents can exchange their full-price ticket for a 365-day membership which gives discounts on shopping and on future tickets for visitors. Bridge and far side of park are not wheelchair accessible. There is a free shuttle from downtown Vancouver and Coal Harbour with departures every 10-15 minutes in the summer during the day. $15 child (6-12), $28 youth (13-16), $35 student (17+ with student ID), $43 senior, $47 adult.   (updated Jul 2018)
49.35616-123.1104712 Capilano Fish Hatchery, 4500 Capilano Rd, ☏ +1 604-666-1790. Open daily spring/summer: 8AM - 9PM; at other times: 8AM - dusk.

49.3604-123.11113 Cleveland Dam, Capilano Rd, just north of Montroyal. Located within Capilano River Regional Park.  A good spot to take in the view. Looking north from the dam are the Lions and Capilano Lake, while south is the nearly 300 ft (91 m) high spillway from the dam and Capilano Canyon. There are also some picnic tables nearby. The dam was built to build a reservoir for Metro Vancouver's drinking water and has appeared in TV shows (Smallville) and movies (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes). Free.   (updated Nov 2016)
Other attractions[edit]
Deep Cove
Park & Tilford Gardens in spring

Deep Cove is very popular on summer weekends, so take public transit or come early if you want to find a parking spot.   (updated Mar 2016)
49.34383-123.0180816 Lynn Canyon Park, Peters Rd (head north on Lynn Valley Rd from Hwy 1 (exit 19), turn right onto Peters Rd and follow it until it ends), ☏ +1 604-984-3149. Open daily 7AM-dusk. A great little park set on the forested slopes of Lynn Creek. The main draw is the Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge, which is shorter, less busy but almost as high as the more noted Capilano Suspension Bridge. The bridge connects to hiking trails on the both sides of the creek, with a common 20-30 minute hike being a loop that crosses the suspension bridge and follows the canyon down to Twin Falls. The creek is a popular swimming spot in the summer with pools above the suspension bridge and below Twin Falls. But be careful if swimming — the water is icy cold (it is snow melt, after all) and read the warning signs; there are deaths almost every year. Free.   (updated Nov 2016)

Hiking[edit]
Forest trail in Capilano River Regional Park
There are beautiful hikes to do on the North Shore ranging from rugged steep climbs to gentle strolls, and range in time commitment from a couple of hours to a full day. Along the way you can potentially see waterfalls, lots of trees and some nice views. If doing some of the more advanced hikes in the mountains, be mindful that the terrain is sometimes steep, the trail rough and that you are in a wilderness area with bears and cougars so take appropriate precautions.

49.3583-123.11211 Capilano River Regional Park, 5077 Capilano Rd (access is from Cleveland Dam or the Capilano Fish Hatchery — see the Capilano River Attractions section above), ☏ +1 604-224-5739. June-Aug 7AM-10PM, Sept-May 7AM-8PM. 26 km of hiking trails mostly set in the rain forest along the Capilano River canyon. Trails are up and down with occasional steep sections. The Second Canyon Viewpoint Trail (starts near the fish hatchery) provides some stellar views of the canyon and Cleveland Dam in spring when water levels are high. Free.   (updated Jul 2018)
49.37107-123.09792 Grouse Mountain Regional Park, 6400 Nancy Greene Way (entry gate is on the east side of the road above Grouse Mountain's Parking Lot D), ☏ +1 604-224-5739. Usually open May-Oct from an hour after dawn to a couple of hours before sunset (roughly 6:15AM-7:30PM in summer). Features the Grouse Grind, The busiest and best-known hiking trail in the Lower Mainland, the Grind is more of a fitness challenge than an outdoor experience. Nicknamed "Nature's Stairmaster", the 2,830 steps (2.9 km) climb nearly 1,000-m up the forested slopes of Grouse Mountain. There are unfortunately no real views from the trail but it does give a real sense of accomplishment when you break through the trees at the top and see the chalet. Fit hikers can do it in under an hour, the average time is 1.5-2 hours. Good footwear is recommended (no flip-flops), and in the late afternoon, make sure to allow enough time to complete the climb before dusk. Travel is one direction — up. Downhill travel is not permitted for safety reasons so hikers are expected to take the Grouse Mountain Skyride back down. It's possible to take the neighbouring BCMC trail back to the parking lot, but it is easy to miss the turns in that trail and the downhill is very hard on the knees. Use of the trail is free, the tram ride back down is $15.  (updated Jul 2018)
49.3612-123.02813 Lynn Headwaters Regional Park, end of Lynn Valley Rd (access from the corner of Lynn Valley Rd & Dempsey Rd), ☏ +1 604-224-5739. A popular spot with locals that has picnic tables on the river close to the parking lot. There are a number of trails of varying difficulty on the other side of the river. The most common are to take the trail along Lynn Creek or do the Lynn Loop, a 5 km trail that loops through the forest and back along Lynn Creek to the parking lot. There are also longer, more difficult trails that go into the mountains.   (updated Mar 2016)
49.3058-123.00464 Maplewood Flats, 2649 Dollarton Hwy, ☏ +1 604-929-2379. 6AM-10PM. A conservation area and popular birders' destination on Burrard Inlet. A restored mix of deciduous forest, meadow and wetland supports local wildlife and migratory birds. There are about 3 km of trails (mostly wheelchair accessible) and some benches and platforms to take in the view. Free.   (updated Jul 2018)
49.3657-122.94885 Mount Seymour Provincial Park, at the end of the Mount Seymour road. Provincial park with 14 hiking trails of varying lengths and difficulty, from a couple of km to 14 km (all distances round trip). Sights include views of Greater Vancouver, lakes, forest trails and climbing some peaks. The trail to Dinky Bluff is under 1 km with a small elevation gain and provides views of the Lower Mainland. Dog Mountain is a popular trail with views of Vancouver and the Seymour River valley. The trail is rolling and mostly in forest until you reach the bluff, distance is about 6 km roundtrip. Another popular but more difficult trail is to the top of Mount Seymour. Return distance is 8 km and the elevation gain is 450 m. Hikers are rewarded at the top with panoramic views of the Lower Mainland, the North Shore Mountains, and on clear days, Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands. Most trails are accessed from the north end of Parking Lot 4 (the parking lot at the end of the road). There are also information boards with trail maps at a few of the parking lots along the access road (including the main trailheads at Parking Lot 4). Most trails are not open in winter due to the snowy conditions and the operations of the ski resort. Free.   (updated Mar 2017)
49.3301-122.94986 Quarry Rock hike (trailhead across the street from the north end of Panorama Park). An up-and-down hike through the forest with plenty of cedars, waterfalls and wooden bridges along the way. The reward is a big outcrop with nice views of Deep Cove and Burnaby Mountain. It's a very popular hike so expect to share the trail. Total hiking time is typically around 45 minutes each way and the hike can be done any time of the year. (updated May 2018)
Snow sports[edit]
Skiing with views on Grouse Mountain
One of the things that drew people over to the North Shore in the early days was skiing and it continues to draw the crowds, particularly on weekends in January and February. The three ski hills offer a mix of downhill and cross-country skiing, tubing and snowshoeing. Opening and closing dates depend on the weather, but they are usually open by late November and close in early/mid April.

49.386111-123.0763897 Grouse Mountain. Accessed through the Grouse Mountain Skyride at the northern end of Capilano Road (Exit 14 from Hwy 1 or bus #236 or #232). It is known for its terrain parks (Jib, Rookie and Advanced) and the great views it provides of Vancouver. You can also snowshoe on the trails at the top of the mountain.

On the water[edit]
You'd never be able to describe the water as warm, but there are beaches at Deep Cove and Cates Park if you want a refreshing dip. The real attraction though, is the excellent kayaking in Indian Arm. Novice kayakers, or paddlers just looking for a couple of hours on the water, can paddle around Deep Cove and the nearby shoreline; the more experienced can explore the further reaches of Indian Arm. If you head up the Arm in a kayak, watch for motorboats as some move very quickly and be aware the wind normally picks up in the afternoon and will usually be against you on the way back to Deep Cove, so plan accordingly.

Cycling and mountain biking[edit]
A mellow North Shore ride
North Vancouver, and the entire North Shore, is world-famous among mountain bikers as one of the best places to mountain bike. The obstacles created by the local terrain — roots, fallen trees, drops and the mountains — have led to a unique style of trails which combine man-made features and natural obstacles that has become known around the world as “North Shore” style. Not every trail in North Vancouver is a heart-pumping gnarly descent, though. There’s a growing network of paved trails that provide some easy riding and nice views. The main one is the Spirit Trail, which can be easily accessed from the Seabus and Lonsdale Quay.

Rentals[edit]
Bike rentals aren't as plentiful on the North Shore as they are downtown, so it may be easier to rent a bike downtown and take it on the Seabus. There are a couple of local options though with a good selection of bikes that can handle the level of riding you want.

Trails[edit]
North Vancouver trails cover the range from city cruising to forest paths to downhill descents. They’re listed below in approximate level of difficulty (paved trails at the top, mountain biking trails at the end). Mountain bike trails are graded using a green/blue/black system, with green being beginner, blue for intermediate and black/double black for advanced. Many of the trails are maintained by the North Shore Mountain Bike Association and Trailforks has an abundance of detailed trail information (also available as an app for iPhone and Android). Local bike shops are also good sources of information and first-hand knowledge.

For microbreweries, the area just southeast of the Lonsdale Quay SeaBus Terminal has been designated the "Brewery District" and is home to microbreweries, cider mill, winery, distillery, and braggotery, with new establishments opening every few months.

Connect[edit]
All of the commercial and residential areas of the North Shore have cell phone coverage.  However, the terrain is quite mountainous and therefore there are dead spots here and there. Once you get off on the hiking trails you lose cell phone coverage amazingly quickly.

Stay safe[edit]
Be prepared, there be mountains and other hazards beyond this gate
The biggest danger in North Vancouver is the terrain and not being prepared. Property crime happens and usual precautions like keeping valuables out of sight should be followed. Violent crime is rare. If you need to contact emergency services, dial 911.
When hiking in the mountains, biking or skiing, understand the trails you are going on and do not go beyond your abilities or provisions. The terrain can be treacherous off marked trails with cliffs and gullies, and local rescue teams are frequently called out to find people who were unprepared or got in over their heads. Hikers should stay on well marked trails, have shoes and clothing appropriate to the level of hike and leave plenty of time to get back to the trailhead before nightfall (which happens quite quickly in the dense forest). Skier/snowboarders should stay in-bounds of the ski resort.
There are a lot of black bears around in the summer. Be bear aware when hiking around the North Shore areas.
