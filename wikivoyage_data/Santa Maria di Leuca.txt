By foot[edit]
The locality is quite small and can be visited by foot quickly, walking along the beautiful promenade of Via Cristoforo Colombo. You can reach the Sanctuary of Finibus Terrae from the harbor by walking up a 284-step monumental staircase. Don't forget a pair of comfortable shoes and a bottle of water!

By car[edit]
Many streets are one-way and road signs can be difficult to understand (a trick of the municipality to earn money thanks to the fines), so if you choose to drive in the central area of the village watch out for eventual driving bans and road marking. The boardwalk is extremely busy at every hour of every day during summer and parking there is virtually impossible. Be prepared to park your car some blocks north and don't forget the parking meter!
Despite this a car can be useful to explore the coast in both directions or to reach the magnificent grottoes on the Ionian Sea, driving towards west.

Stay safe[edit]
Crime is practically absent in all the territory and the only advice is leaving your bag out while you are taking a bath at the sea, so that you can take a look at it. The only real problem for your safety is exactly the sea! Leuca has little stretches of sandy coast along the promenade but the rest of the coastline is rocky and can be difficult to move along it for people not accustomed. Consider the idea of buying a pair of sea shoes that are sold in many shops, also in most of newsstands.
If you want to rent a boat to explore the sea caves don't forget to take the phone number of the attendant and be careful when you steer the boat behind the promontory of Punta Meliso (the one with the lighthouse), since the waters become deep and the sea is usually a bit rough.
