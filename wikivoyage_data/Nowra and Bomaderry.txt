Nowra is a town on the Shoalhaven region of New South Wales situated on the Shoalhaven River 163 km south of Sydney. With a population 29,000 Nowra is the chief administrative and business centre in the Shoalhaven City municipality, and a regional centre for tourism. Bomaderry is its twin town to the north of the Shoalhaven River and contains the town's train station.

Nowra Bridge

Understand[edit]
The traditional owners of the area south of the river are Wandi-Wandandian tribe of the Yuin nation. Nowra is an Aboriginal word meaning 'Black Cockatoo'.
The centre of city is a service town, just a short diversion of the Princes Highway.  There is a shopping mall, and handful of speciality shops.  It is good to stop for supplies or a coffee, but the centre of town isn't particularly scenic.  It is away from the Shoalhaven River, and away from the coast.
The hinterland, the river, and the nearby beaches are spectacular on a sunny day, and offer good opportunities for scenic drives, or even a bicycle ride down country lanes if you plan your trip carefully.

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
Trains on the South Coast Line (SCO) run to -34.853863150.6098071 Bomaderry Station  from Kiama, which has direct trains from Wollongong and Sydney.  The trains terminate at Bomaderry which is north of the Shoalhaven river from the Nowra township.  A bus connects with the train to go over the road bridge to Nowra (extra fare).  
The train journey from Kiama usually runs every two hours – from anywhere north of Kiama, you'll need to change from electric to diesel trains in Kiama for the last leg.  Consequently, some indicator boards show the train only going as far as Kiama.  So check the timetable before travelling, or check with station staff.  The train from Sydney (Central) usually takes three to three and a half hours to arrive in Nowra/Bomaderry. Bomaderry is on the Opal network, so no seat reservations or bookings are required.
The train fares to Nowra are cheap for the distance travelled - no more expensive than to the outskirts of Sydney.  The Opal Sunday fare cap in particular makes it a good value trip.  
The trip down the coast south of Sydney by train is a pleasant one.

By bus[edit]
Premier Motor Services run coaches from Sydney to Nowra and beyond.
Priors Scenic Express run coaches from Greater Sydney and the Southern Highlands to Nowra and as far south as Narooma.

By car[edit]
Nowra is on the Princes Hwy which is A1/M1 heading south from Sydney.  Follow the signs south to Wollongong, then Kiama and then continue on to Nowra.  It is about 2 hours drive from Sydney to Nowra on good quality roads.  Driving will easily beat the train and the bus for time, although the train line is more scenic and runs closer to the coast for most of the distance.

Being in Nowra without a car is limiting, as many of the attractions are away from the town centre; the city layout is also car-centric otherwise.  You can access the shopping strip easily, but this is probably the least inspiring part of the town.  You can walk as far as the river, bridge and train station if you are enthusiastic, it is around 3-4 km from the town centre to the station.  Most other locations will require a car.
There are cycle lanes on the Princes Highway around the centre of Nowra, but paint isn't true cycle infrastructure.  The streets south of the river down to Comerong Island and Greenwell point are good for cycling.   Bolong Road to the north of the river gets busy with fast traffic and narrow shoulders.

By bus[edit]
Nowra Coaches, Kennedy's tours and Shoalbus provide local bus services, but these only run a few times a day to surrounding areas.
