Understand[edit]
Älmhult was not more than a farming hamlet until 1862, when the Stockholm-Malmö railroad was built. The town has two claims for fame. Firstly, Carl Linnaeus, founder of systematic biology, was born on a farm near Älmhult (Linnaeus' Råshult) in 1707. Secondly, Älmhult is the spiritual home the furniture chain IKEA, the founder Ingvar Kamprad was born nearby in 1926 and in 1958 the first IKEA store opened here. IKEA maintains a strong presence in town. Älmhult has since long been associated with entrepreneurship and has an unusually high number of small businesses.
