Dunkeld is a village in the Highland part of Perth and Kinross, Scotland, on the east bank of the River Tay (which here makes an S-bend, so it becomes the north bank.) The village of Birnam is on the opposite bank, connected by the Telford Bridge; the combined population in 2021 was 1350.
The original village was near the cathedral, but was smashed up by a battle in 1689. Dunkeld was therefore rebuilt in the early 18th century, and is the best-preserved example in Scotland of the style of that era. In 1809 the seven-arched Telford bridge was opened across the Tay, and highway and village became re-aligned. Dunkeld and Birnam long stood on the A9 main road north, but were bypassed in 1977.


Get in[edit]

Dunkeld is just off the A9 main road from the south towards Inverness. Stagecoach bus 23 / 27 runs hourly from Perth via Birnam and Dunkeld (40 min), continuing to Aberfeldy. But most intercity coaches along the A9 bypass Dunkeld, and there's just one Citylink bus per day from Edinburgh, heading for Inverness.
The A923 climbs east over the hills towards Blairgowrie & Rattray; the bus along this route has been axed. 
56.557-3.5781 Dunkeld & Birnam Railway Station is across the bridge in Birnam. It has trains every hour or two from Edinburgh and Glasgow via Perth en route to Pitlochry, Aviemore and Inverness.

Get around[edit]
Dunkeld is a small village, so you can walk everywhere. Loch of the Lowes (2 miles) can be reached by the Fungarth Path.
