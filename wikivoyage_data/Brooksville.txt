28.618611-82.3651 Chinsegut Hill, 22495 Chinsegut Hill Rd (five miles northeast of the city). The manor house on this hill was built in the early 1850s before the Civil War by Francis H. Ederington. After the Civil War, Colonel Russell Snow, Ederington's son-in-law named it Snow Hill and expanded the living space of the home. The Robins family bought the home in 1904 and renamed it Chinsegut Hill and continued its expansion as Raymond Robins worked as an advisor for seven presidents. Electricity came to the home in 1933. Following the economic crash in 1929, however, the family donated the home to the U.S. government on the basis that they could remain there and avoid paying property tax. Raymond Robins died in 1954 and the University of South Florida used the property for educational purposes. It was added the registry of historical places in 2003.   (updated Jul 2021)
