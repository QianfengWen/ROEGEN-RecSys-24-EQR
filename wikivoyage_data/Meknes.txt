Meknes (مكناس) is a city in the Middle Atlas region of Morocco. Meknes is a vibrant, modern city bustling with nightlife, restaurants and an impressive imperial city created in the 17th century by King Moulay Ismaïl, with numerous historical monuments and natural sites; it is also the nearest city to the Roman ruins of Volubilis (Oualili). 

Meknes

Understand[edit]
Is Fez driving you nuts? Nearby Meknes is relatively ignored by most tourists. It's also free of the usual hassles (touts, faux guides, etc.) that plague the other tourist centers. The prices in Meknes are among the most reasonable.

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
Meknes is on the Fès-Rabat railway line and has two train stations. The smaller one called 33.8996-5.54561 Gare de Meknès-Amir Abdelkader is more centrally located in the new town (ville nouvelle), while the bigger 33.8966-5.53192 Gare Meknès-Ville is a bit further east.
Meknes is connected by train to most major cities like Marrakech (6½ hr, 174 dirham), Tangier (3½–4½ hr, 85 dirham), Rabat (2¼ hr, 69 dirham), Casablanca (3¼ hr), Fes (40 min, 20 dirham) or Oujda (6 hr, 130 dirham). Specific times and prices can be found on the website of the Moroccan National Office for Railways.

By bus[edit]
33.8906-5.575153 Gare Routière (Sidi Saïd) (west of the Medina). It is co-located with the main grand taxi station. Buses leaving for eastward (e.g. Fez bus #13, 15 dirham) and northward (e.g. Volubilis bus #15, 7 dirham) destinations circle around the Medina where you can also board them. (updated Jul 2023)
33.8976-5.53684 CTM Bus Station. A brand new station, near Meknes train station (east of the new town). (updated Apr 2019)
There are buses to Meknès from almost anywhere in Morocco, including Agadir (11 hr; 200-230 dirham), Casablanca (5 hr; 80-90 dirham), Chefchaouen (5½ hrs; 60-80 dirham), Erfoud (10 hr, 100-110 dirham), Fez (1 hr; 13-15 dirham), Marrakech (9 hr; 140-160 dirham), Rabat (3½ hr; 50-60 dirham) and Tangier (6 hr, 80-90 dirham).

By grand taxi[edit]
Grand taxi arrive and leave from several places, the most popular being El-Amir Abdelkader train station. Opposite the road of the Institute Français is also a quite large taxi rank.

33.89921-5.553515 Grand taxi stand to Volubilis. .
By car[edit]
Meknès is on Autoroute 2 (Rabat-Fès), which continues further east on N6 to Oujda.
Road N13 goes over the mountain range to Tetouan and Tangier or Ceuta to the north, in the northbound direction it goes to Azrou and At-Rachida.

Get around[edit]
Map of Meknes
Hamrya is a new town with all entertainment facilities. You can find all what you need there, but there is no monuments or things to see except if you like to chat with people. Medina is the other side is the ancient Meknes and it contains all the monuments of this wonderful city.

By taxi[edit]
Petit taxis (small blue cars of Fiat Uno or Peugeot 205 brands) abound, as well as an efficient and comprehensive, if cramped local bus service. The minimum cost for a petit taxi is 5 dirham (the price is calculated based on 1.40 dirham + 0.20 dirham/100 m but you should expect a surcharge of 50% after 20:00).

By bus[edit]
While the bus is slightly cheaper, buses are quite difficult to navigate, because they are, in the majority of cases, very crowded and operate to transport people between agglomerations and the ville nouvelle and Medina.

On foot[edit]
The ville nouvelle (new town), which is known as Hamrya in Arabic, is easily navigated on foot, as is the medina. The two sides of town are connected by a bridge over the dry Oued Boufekrane (river), with a McDonald's placed in between for weary (or wary!) travelers.

See[edit]
Bab Mansour in the world heritage listed old town
33.892611-5.5646391 Bab Mansour. Bab means "gate" or "door" in Arabic, and Bab Mansour is the largest and most striking of Meknes' many gates (27 gates). It's directly across from Lahdim Square, the medina's main square. The gate is nowadays used for art exhibitions. The gate is closed for reconstruction, which is supposed to be finished in 2023, but still ongoing (February 2024).   (updated Feb 2018)
33.893189-5.5655122 Lahdim Square. Redone with new brickwork, this square once rivaled Djemaa el Fna in Marrakech but is now significantly less exciting (though there are a few nice cafés and snack spots in which to people-watch).

The complex was first built in 1703 under Moulay Isma'il and then later expanded multiple times. The original complex was less extensive than it is today and it likely included only the tomb chamber, the adjoining rooms on either side of it, and the main courtyard leading up to it. Free admission.   (updated Jan 2023)
33.891129-5.5646247 Prison Kara (Habs Qara). A huge underground prison where Moulay Ismail allegedly kept prisoners. A little pricey for basically just some empty halls underground. 60 dirham.   (updated Apr 2019)

Do[edit]
 Public swimming pool. There is a very popular public swimming pool between the medina and the new city, on a hot day it is a godsend. (updated Jul 2017)
Buy[edit]
Meknes is not a shopper's paradise, but it is certainly cheaper than nearby Fez. The medina is chock full of traditional Moroccan clothing and rugs, as well as the popular Moroccan shoe, bilgha.. It is also known for its metallic articles; the local artisanal speciality. The best way to enter the medina is at the back of Place Hedim, next to Dar Jamai. Herein you can find many shops catering to tourists. If you sojourn a bit deeper into the medina, you'll find plenty of unique shops selling jewellery, household goods and other treasures.
Be sure to bargain! Don't accept the shopkeeper's first offer: not only does it ruin it for tourists who come after you, but it also goes against Moroccan custom. The easiest way to bargain, particularly without knowledge of French or Arabic, is to offer half of the given price (or 75% for expensive or large-scale items). From there, the shopkeeper will go down a bit; you are expected to raise your price slowly until you come to an agreement.
If you can't agree on a price, try walking out of the shop as this will generally lower the price significantly. And try not to be too stingy: the value of an item is your appreciation of it, not its price.

Eat[edit]
The market near the main place in the medina (at the Bab El-Mansur) has incredible fresh products. Lots of different kinds of olives, sweets, pickles, etc.

Meknes market
In Ville Nouvelle there are dozens of restaurants and snack bars lining the main road, Rue Antsirape offering the staples of harira, tagine, cous cous and of course rotisserie chicken. A few restaurants on Rue Ghana, just off Rue Antsirabi, are popular with travellers and offer 40-dirham set menus.

Splurge[edit]
Drink[edit]
Those looking to find a watering hole in Meknes have come to the right place, in Morocco, anyway. For some reason, Meknes seems to have more bars than people. Only a few are suitable for the average traveler, however.

 Le Pub, Avenue Allal Ben Abdellah. Daily until midnight. One of the only places in Meknes where women will feel comfortable finding a drink, this lively pub has two floors; the bottom is where the music and "scene" happens. Try the local wines; Guerrouane and Amazir are particularly tasty. 15-45 dirham bottle beers only, 50 dirham cocktails, Shisha (hookah tobacco) costs 50 dirham. (updated Jul 2023)
 Novelty (top of Rue de Paris). Daily until midnight. This renovated pub is rumored to be owned by Italians, which would explain the lovely wood decor. It's also the only place in Meknes to drink draught beer. Wine is served by the bottle only. 15-45 dirham draft or bottle beers, 50 dirham cocktails. (updated Jul 2023)
Sleep[edit]
Budget[edit]
Most budget hotels are along Rue Rouamzine, just before the medina. Hotel Maroc and Hotel Regina are two such choices. Hotel Regina is very dirty and stinky, but very cheap.

Wedged between the medina and ville nouvelle, just two doors down from the much swankier and well known Hotel Transatlantique. In the new city, it is 1½ km from the closest medina gate; in fact it's not really near anything and you loose whatever you save staying here on a taxi (8 dirham) coming or going. For the same price, Hostel Maroc is better. They do let anyone use the shower for 7 dirham though. Dorms from 70 dirham for HI members (+20 if you aren't, and they don't honour E-memberships), 160 dirham for a double room w/ shared bathroom. (updated Feb 2018)
