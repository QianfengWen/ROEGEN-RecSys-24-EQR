Clifden (An Clochán, "stepping stones") is a small town on the northwest coast of County Galway in the west of Ireland. It grew up as a harbour and market town, then after the Famine became a coast resort with its present Victorian architecture. Clifden's population in 2016 was only 1597, but this greatly swells in summer, as it's the main commercial and tourist centre for Connemara. 
The TIC is on Main St, open M-F 09:00-17:00.

See Galway for long distance routes. From Galway, road N59 runs west to Clifden (79 km) then loops north to Letterfrack and Westport, County Mayo.
Citylink Bus 923 and Bus Éireann 419 between them run every hour or two from Galway via Oughterard and Maam Cross to Clifden (90 min); a couple of buses continue to Letterfrack and Cleggan. This is a scenic drive across Connemara with views of Lough Corrib, numerous smaller lakes and the Twelve Bens mountain range. Train and bus connections are available from Dublin, Cork and Limerick in Galway.
Bus Éireann 423 runs three times a day from Westport in County Mayo, taking 90 min via Leenane, along the bank of Killary Fjord and Letterfrack to Clifden. Some departures are timed to connect with trains from Dublin at Westport.

See[edit]
Beach Road is a pleasant stroll north side of the bay, leading eventually to the beach sheltered by a spit of land.
The Station House Museum in Clifden was closed in early 2020.
53.492-10.0561 Clifden Castle is a picturesque ruined mansion in Gothic Revival style. It was the home of John D'Arcy (1785–1839), who founded Clifden, but his successors went bankrupt during the great potato famine. The next owners were absentees then the estate suffered land raids; in the 20th century the place fell derelict. You can stroll up the lane from Sky Road but the building is unsafe to enter. It's inhabited by cows, who have made themselves comfortable, so you could reasonably call it "Clifden Cattle".
53.4-10.2342 Slyne Head Lighthouse stands on an island beyond the golf course.
53.446-10.0223 Alcock & Brown's landing site is at the end of Marconi St, 10 km south of Clifden off R341. In 1913 the Daily Mail of London put up a prize of £10,000 for the first transatlantic flight: the competition was suspended for the First World War but resumed after the Armistice. Captain Jack Alcock (1892-1919) and 2nd Lieutenant Teddie Brown (1886-1948) had both been shot down during the war and taken prisoner - Alcock near Gallipoli and Brown near Arras in Pas de Calais. Postwar they found their way to Vickers the aircraft manufacturers, and a Vickers Vimy IV twin-engined bomber was converted for the attempt. They wobbled into the sky at 13:45  on 14 June 1919 from Lester's Field in St John's, Newfoundland, stealing a march on the Handley Page team who weren't quite ready. Alcock was pilot and Brown was navigator: all their skills were tested to the limit. The aircraft generator failed, taking out the radio, intercom and heating; the carburettor and trim control aso failed. They endured fog, snow and freezing rain. They flew 1890 miles (3040 km) in 15 hours 57 minutes at an average speed of 115 mph (185 km/h), and 08:40 next morning found them crossing the Galway coast. They had enough fuel to press on to England but in bad weather opted to land here, in a promising big green field - gloop! Sure enough they'd found themselves a bog, the wheels dug in and the aircraft nose-planted. But they'd flown across the Atlantic, and it only remained to squelch a few yards to the Marconi transmitting station, to send word of their triumph.
53.379-9.964 Dog's Bay and Gurteen Bay are the two sides of a tombola on the coast further south. The two beaches are made of tiny shells of Foraminifera or marine borers.
53.394-9.9195 Roundstone (Cloch na Rón) is a picture-perfect harbour village. Roundstone Musical Instruments & Crafts, open daily, makes traditional bodhran and has become a tourist attraction. (See Inis Oírr for the annual bodhran festival.) Stroll up Mt Errisbeg (298 m) just behind the village for great views.
53.48-9.9116 Connemara Heritage and History Centre is a small museum on N59 five km east of town, recreating a 1800 homestead. It's open Apr-Oct daily 10:00-18:00, adult €8.50.
53.556-10.1117 Cleggan is a tiny fishing hamlet. It has a couple of bars, a restaurant, some B&Bs and a riding centre. Ferries sail from here to Inishbofin and occasionally to Inishturk.
53.543-10.1398 Claddaghduff is the start of the tidal crossing to Omey Island.
53.616-10.2099 Inishbofin Island is reached by ferry from Cleggan. It's low-lying and treeless, with a Cromwell-era fort and Iron Age fortifications.
53.704-10.11410 Inishturk: beware, there are three. This one, north of Inishbofin, is inhabited and can be reached by boat from Cleggan; but it's in County Mayo and more usually reached from Roonagh. Another, known as Inishturk South, is uninhabited and is seen just off the headland of the Sky Road. And there's the privately-owned Inishturk Beg in Clew Bay in Mayo.
See Letterfrack for Connemara National Park and the "Twelve Bens".
Do[edit]
Clifden Castle - or Cattle?
Drive or cycle the Sky Road, the scenic loop of lane around the Atlantic headland. This forms part of the Wild Atlantic Way: once Sky Road loops back to N59, the suggested route is to branch west along the lane to Claddaghduff (for Omey Island) and Cleggan, then return to N59 to reach Letterfrack. From Galway to Clifden by that route, hug the coast through Spiddal,  Costello, Inver, Carna, Dog's Bay and Ballyconneelly.
