Eastport

Understand[edit]
Originally known as Salvage Bay, Salvage New, and Brighton, it eventually became known as Eastport due to it being on the east side of Salvage Bay. In the early 1960s, under the resettlement program, several families from Flat Island and Coward’s Island moved to Eastport. They brought with them their unique culture which added a new and interesting dimension to the community. Today, that friendly unique culture can be seen throughout Eastport whenever you stop for a ‘yarn’ with residents.
Eastport is the service centre for the Eastport Peninsula. Here you will find grocery stores, restaurants, accommodations, and service stations (as well as lots to do!).

Get in[edit]
Eastport is 285 km from St. John's, which has the nearest major airport, and 85 km from Gander, which has a small airport.
