Located in Chiapas, the Mayan ruined city of Palenque stands out as one of the most beautiful and tourist-friendly of the Mayan cities. It has well developed tourist infrastructure with easy accessibility and a spectacular setting on a mountain in the midst of a rainforest. Beautiful architecture, unique in the Maya world, and well-preserved reliefs integrate with natural landscape to provide an educational tour with impact. Numerous discoveries were made in Palenque, defining a large chunk of the known history and mythology of the ancient Mayan culture. The site is still being actively explored and renown archaeologists from around the world come to research new theories about the Mesoamerican world. 
Mythology names King U-Ch'ix-K'an as the ruler of Palenque in 993 BC, but the physical evidence found to date shows the city to have thrived between 226 BC and 800 AD. Either way, it's old. Set amidst thick trees, Palenque still evokes some of the wonder that the early Spanish visitors must have felt when they first came across the ruins. 
The ruins are set deep in a national park, with tropical rainforests surrounding the archaeological site. 
Both the ruins and the park are inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.



Understand[edit]
Archaeological site[edit]
Palenque is a medium-sized archaeological site, much smaller than Tikal or Yaxchilan, but it contains some of the finest sculpture, architecture, roof combs, and bas-relief carvings of the Mayan era. The site's many carvings (stelae and lintels) provide fertile source material for historians to study as they seek to understand the site's past.  As was common at the time, Palenque was frequently at war with rival city-states, such as Calakmul and Toniná (whose warriors sacked the city in the early 8th century AD).
Palenque is a well-developed site that's been extensively explored and documented (it's often regarded as the most studied site in the Americas.) Despite the number of excavations, only a small part of the total archaeological site is seen by the public. Almost 90% of the original Mayan city remains hidden in the jungle, awaiting a future generation of archaeologists to uncover even more secrets.
Some highlights of the site include:

Temple of the Inscriptions - pyramid where the tomb of Pacal the Great was found, many carvings for historians to study
Temples of the Cross - three temples set atop three pyramids in a building cluster, Temple of the Cross, Temple of the Sun, and Temple of the Foliated Cross
Palace - home of royalty, contains an observatory, spa baths, and a sauna. It's good to be the king.
National park[edit]
Surrounding the ancient Mayan ruins are 1,772 hectares of tropical jungle, intended as a buffer area for the site and to preserve the forest environment, providing habitat for native plants and animals. The park includes several waterfalls and a camping area.
More than 1,500 species have been catalogued in the national park, including 62 mammal species. In addition to jaguars, monkeys, and other species commonly associated with tropical jungles, the park is home to over two dozen different kinds of bats (which make up the largest family of mammalians in the park). About 300 bird species have been spotted in the Nacional Parque Palenque, 87 of which are migratory species and the rest live in the park year round. Lots of reptiles and amphibians are found in the park including 29 species of frog and 52 species of snake. Two species of crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) and (Crocodylus moreletti) are found in the park's rivers and marshes -- and both are endangered.

Town[edit]
Parque Central in town of Palenque
The town of Palenque is just 8 km from the archaeological site. It was established by Dominican missionaries under the leadership of Fray Pedro Lorenzo in 1567, yet it would be 300 years before the friars learned about the ruins and reported their existence to the Spanish crown. Numerous expeditions ensued over the years, making Palenque one of the best explored and best documented of the Maya city-states. The town grew along with the reputation of its Maya treasures.
The town of Palenque is large for the state of Chiapas with a charming colonial centro and a large number of quaint older posadas and good restaurants that present the regional cuisine of Chiapas. A number of boutique shops and an artesan market showcase some of the crafts and artists of the local community. Recognizing the touristic value of Palenque, the tourism department of the federal government designated the town a Pueblo Mágico in 1987.

Waterfalls[edit]
Misol-Ha waterfall in Palenque
Palenque is famous for its spectacular waterfalls. There are three falls that are worth making a special effort to visit. These take some time and effort to reach so it would be wise to schedule a visit on a different day than you visit the ruins, which will easily take a full day to experience. The easiest way to visit these waterfalls is to arrange a day tour in the town of Palenque. You can visit on your own but it will be a hassle to figure out how to get in and out of the area around the falls and how to use combis for transportation. The tours are cheap and convenient and give travellers an added measure of safety since the falls are in a rural area outside the safety of Palenque.

Agua Azul waterfall
The three major waterfalls are:

Misol Ha - highest of the three falls with a dramatic 35-foot fall that's great for pictures, close to town and easily reached by public combis
Agua Azul - most popular of the waterfalls due to its bright blue water (as the name implies), many vendors
Roberto Barrios - best swimming of the three falls, but most remote location and smallest crowds
There is an admission charge for some of the waterfalls (Misol-Ha charged M$30 in June 2022).
Keep in mind that wet rocks around waterfalls can be slippery. Rubber sole shoes or watershoes are recommended.

Climate[edit]
The national park ranges in altitude between 200 and 800 meters with a climate typical of low-lying tropical jungles. Expect hot temperatures averaging 26°C and high humidity. Torrential downpours can occur at any time of year, but are most common in the summer months.
