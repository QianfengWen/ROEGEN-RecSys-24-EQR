Siesta Key is a barrier island in Southwest Florida, and has one of the most beautiful beaches in North America and possibly the world.  The beach is a fine white powder that is never too hot to enjoy a walk.  Calm Gulf waters are typically warmer than the Atlantic coast.  It is a short distance west of Sarasota.


Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The northern entrance is Siesta Dr, which connects from US-41 on the mainland (Sarasota). At the junction with Higel Ave, take a left. When Higel Ave intersects with Midnight Pass Rd, a left turn bypasses the downtown, while a right turn from Higel Ave onto Ocean Blvd a block later goes to the downtown.
The "southern," or eastern entrance to the park is via Stickney Point Rd (FL-72). This road intersects US-41 on the south side of Sarasota.
There is no road to Siesta Key from Ben Franklin Rd; to go to Longboat Key, it is necessary to drive a route via the mainland. There is also no highway connecting to Siesta Key from the south (Palmer Point Park).
