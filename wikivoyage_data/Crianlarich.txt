Crianlarich is a village in  Stirlingshire, 6 miles northeast of the head of Loch Lomond. It bills itself as "the gateway to the Highlands" but it's more like halfway down the hall, because it's distinctly Highland in nature. It's a tiny place (the population in 2001 was 185) but an important junction: routes through here date back to General Wade's 18th century military roads, and the railway divides for Oban or Fort William. It's also the midpoint of the West Highland Way long distance walking trail. Most visitors are just making a rest stop. The main reason to stay longer is the choice of nearby mountains, easily climbed.
There isn't a tourist information centre in Crianlarich, but the Scottish Tourist Board can be contacted online or on 0845 225 5121.

By road, have at least half a tank of fuel before leaving the lowlands - filling stations here are sparse and pricey. The north-south highway is A82 from Glasgow along the west bank of Loch Lomond then over the hill to Crianlarich, then on north over Rannoch Moor to Glencoe and Fort William. The east-west highway is A85 from Perth via Crieff to Lochearnhead, then over the hill into Glen Dochart and Crianlarich. Here it merges with the A82 north as far as Tyndrum then strikes out west towards Oban.
By bus: Citylink Buses 914/915/916/975 run 6 times a day from Glasgow Buchanan station via A82, taking 1 hr 45 min to Crianlarich. They continue either to Oban, or to Glencoe, Fort William, Invergarry, Kyle of Lochalsh and Portree on the Isle of Skye. The bus stop is at the Crianlarich Hotel.

Connect[edit]
Angler on Loch Iubhair
As of March 2024, Crianlarich and the A82 from Loch Lomond have 4G with all UK carriers, but the signal is patchy further north on A82 or east on A85. Don't plan on getting any signal on the mountains. 5G has not reached this area.

Go next[edit]
Loch Lomond is easily reached on A82 south towards Glasgow, but this runs along the west bank and is always busy with traffic. There's no direct road to the more peaceful, scenic east bank: you have to circle around via A85 to Lochearnhead and Callander before approaching from the east.
Rannoch Moor is similarly skirted by A82 north to Glencoe. But to get in properly, you have to swing away east along Loch Tay then Bridge of Tummel before starting up the long valley.
Loch Tay is reached by A85 east, then branch off through the village of Killin. Ben Lawers is the big climb on the north bank.
Head west to Oban for ferries to several Hebridean islands - Mull is the most popular - but for Skye you go north past Fort William to cross via the bridge.
