For other places with the same name, see Salem (disambiguation).

A charming New England seaside destination, Salem offers visitors the requisite bevy of enthralling elements: a world-class museum, compelling oceanfront and maritime history, quirky shops and tempting restaurants. They're all here and vying for your attention. However, one event in Salem's 400-year history looms above all else—the Salem witch trials. One of the most notorious cases of mass hysteria, the trials saw over 200 people charged with witchcraft, 25 of whom died as a direct result. Try as they might, the city was never able to memory hole the events of 1692. So eventually they changed tack, leaning into the lore of witches and magic. Today the "Witch City" plasters its civic institutions with witch silhouettes, they even built a baseball diamond atop Gallows Hill Park. The plan seems to have worked, tourists have responded and business is up. You know what they say, "time heals all wounds".


Understand[edit]
House of Seven Gables with a Salem harbor backdrop
For thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans, the Naumkeag people enjoyed life on this rocky peninsula. Contact with early explorers was calamitous, and disease would shatter their society. Throughout the 17th century, a series of wars and pogroms pushed them to the brink of extinction. In 1686, Naumkeag survivors pressed their claim in court, and were given £20 (roughly $5,000 today) in payment for their land.
Salem is perhaps best known for the Salem witch trials, which began during the winter of 1692. Two little girls began behaving erratically, acts which town elders quickly deemed "witchcraft". A flurry of accusations and trials would play out over the course of the following year. By the time the outrage subsided, over 200 villagers stood accused of witchcraft. 19 were hanged, 5 died in jail, and one was pressed to death. In hindsight, the major political upheaval of the day combined with neighborly quarrels likely sparked the mass hysteria. The accused were overwhelmingly women (78%), and were often impoverished, having little means to speak of.
During the American Revolution, hundreds of large privateers arrived in Salem to assist the patriot cause. These vessels and their crews saw a great deal of action, scuttling somewhere around 600 British ships. Post-war, sea captains turned their attention to distant lands; the East Indies, China, and Zanzibar to name but a few. Warships were modified to support commerce, and bold Captain-entrepreneurs imported pepper, silks and other luxuries with windfall profits. Today, the legacy of these riches remains on full display throughout the many overlapping historic districts of this city of 44,000 people (2020).

Orientation[edit]
Wilson House, Chestnut Street District
Derby Street is of primary concern to any visitor. Running roughly east to west, it passes through the Maritime District on its way to the ferry terminal. Equally as important is Essex Street, roughly paralleling Derby one block behind the harbor. The vast majority of tourist attractions are found between these two streets. At their western boundaries, you'll encounter Washington Street. This north-south thoroughfare holds the train station at its northern end. Cross Washington to find Summer Street, where your walking tour of the Chestnut Street District begins. The architecture here is stunning, but the shops and restaurants mostly drop away.
For those venturing further afield; Salem Willows and Winter Park can be found to the northeast. Follow Derby until it becomes Fort Ave. To the south, Pioneer Village and Salem University can be reached by following Washington until it merges with Lafayette Street. The more modern areas of Salem (the hospital, the Target, et al) can be found to the southwest, after Essex turns into Highland Ave.

Read and watch[edit]
The Witch (2015 film) — Set about 60 years before the witch trials, watch this darkly atmospheric film to sample some of the deepest fears held by Puritanical New Englanders. Exactingly detailed in its period sets and themes; you've never seen a goat or a forest with peculiarities like these.
Hidden History of Salem (2010 book) —  While not widely distributed, this quick read by Susanne Saville is a collection of short stories—mostly focusing on topics other than the witch trials. Worth exploring for those interested in lesser-known facts about the town.
The Crucible (1996 film) — Based on Arthur Miller's groundbreaking 1953 play; this is a faithful adaptation of Miller's dramatized story of the Salem witch trials. While the film doesn't go quite as hard delving into the political allegories that made the play so forceful; it does feature "spectacular" performances by Daniel Day-Lewis, Joan Allen, and Winona Ryder.
I, Tituba, Black Witch of Salem (1986 book) — This French Grand Prix award winning novel by Maryse Condé was translated into English in 1992. Traumatic and compelling, the life of Tituba is reconstructed from historical records and skillfully blended with fantasy. Gives a voice to one of the accusees least heard from during the witch trials.
The House of the Seven Gables (1851 book) — A gothic romance novel by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Set in the titular home, it weaves together an array of human emotions with a supernatural flair. The book was quite influential on H.P. Lovecraft, if you're into that sort of thing. Sections can feel dated, with some contemporary readers finding it a slog to get through.

The climate in Salem is roughly identical to nearby Boston. Summers are typically warm and humid, while winters are cold and stormy and feature the occasional bout of snow. Spring and fall tend to be cool to mild, with a commensurate uptick in tourism during the annual autumnal fireworks.

Get in[edit]
If you're day tripping from Boston and just concentrating on the core downtown area, your best bet could be the train. It's affordable, takes a ½ hour, and runs somewhat often. The ferry provides outstanding views, but it takes an hour and is more expensive and infrequent. A car can be a good idea if you're visiting other north shore locations, but high season parking can be challenging. The trip might take 30 minutes to an hour or more depending on traffic.

By train[edit]
42.525-70.8958331 Salem Station, 252 Bridge St (MBTA Newburyport/Rockport). 5AM-midnight. Open since 1838, Salem Station has been rebuilt four times; most recently in 2014. Its accessible platforms and secure bike parking are just a few blocks north of the town center. Trains departing from Boston's North Station take about 30 minutes to arrive. Trains run roughly once an hour, and every 30 minutes M-F during rush hours. Fares cannot be purchased at the station, please use the MBTA mTicket app. $8 from Boston one way.   (updated Apr 2022)
By boat[edit]
The Salem Ferry docked off Blaney Street
42.5219-70.88042 Salem Ferry, 10 Blaney St, ☏ +1 978-741-0220. 4-5 ferries daily May 26 - Oct 31. Hop aboard the Nathaniel Bowditch, a 92-foot catamaran with a top speed of 30 knots which makes the trip between Salem and Boston's Long Wharf in 50 minutes to an hour. A bit pricier than the train, but the views of Nahant, Marblehead, and minor islands more than make up for it. Light snacks and cash bar on board. No extra charge for bicycles. $25, $23 senior, $19 children 3-11. (updated Apr 2022)
42.51969-70.889443 Pickering Wharf Marina, 68 Wharf St, ☏ +1 978-210-4584. M-Th Su 8AM-6PM, F Sa 8AM-9PM. On the off chance you're lucky enough to pilot your own private vessel to Salem, this is the place to weigh anchor. Additionally, some tour companies offering a day out on the water will depart from this location. Accommodations for sail and power boats up to 120 feet in length during both the summer and winter seasons. Some amenities include: WiFi, restrooms, showers and laundry facilities. $4/foot. (updated Nov 2022)
By car[edit]
From Boston and points south, take Route 1 north, then merge onto MA-128 north, which is also labelled as Yankee Division Highway on some maps (although no-one calls it that). Next you'll take exit 40A and merge onto MA-114 east. From points north, take Interstate 95 south to Route 1 south, and follow signs for MA-114 east, Peabody and Salem. Continue on 114, pass under Route 128, and a few miles after that you'll cross the North River. You're in downtown Salem! Drop your vehicle off as soon as possible. Parking is quite challenging during most of the summer, and is especially tricky during the month of October. Driving in Salem on Halloween—or the closest weekends—is the stuff nightmares are made of.

By bus[edit]
A few infrequent and slow MBTA buses provide service to Salem. They are the cheapest option ($2.40 from Logan Airport in 2023), but tend to be more useful as a means of escape. The 450 and 455 bus routes travel to Lynn, the 435 to Peabody, and during weekday rush hours the 451 goes to Beverly. There is no Sunday service to Salem on the 435 bus. The 455 always runs out from the Wonderland MBTA station, but the 450 is a bit wacky; running from Haymarket weekdays, and from Wonderland station on weekends.

By bicycle[edit]
Salem finds itself well positioned along several cycling routes. The East Coast Greenway passes through the center of town, making good use of both the Salem Bike Path and Marblehead Rail Trail. The former will run you into the heart of town; while the latter is unpaved, but well traveled. Almost any bike should make short work of these trails. Many riders choose to add the Northern Strand Trail to their cue sheet, and pedal to Salem from Boston. It's a flat 25 mi (40 km) between the Peabody Essex Museum and the P-town ferry, most of which is hidden away from cars. Along the way you'll pass miles of protected marshes, historical markers, and oceanfront vistas – it's really quite a remarkable route.

By foot[edit]
Salem remains a small town, and as such the tourist attractions here fall within a tightly packed area. A stretch of Essex Street, from Washington St to Hawthorne Blvd, is closed to cars and is a delight to walk. Walking across the city; say from the ferry dock to the Witch House, is barely over a mile. Most folks should be able to cover this distance in about 20-25 minutes. The sites you'll pass along the way are packed with more than enough curios to hold anyone's attention.
The Salem Harborwalk is a short walkway along the South River basin, extending from Derby to Congress streets. It's a nice way to escape the crowds on Derby, and there are even a few picnic tables squeezed in-between the parking lots.

By bicycle[edit]
 Bluebikes, toll-free: +1-855-948-2929. 24 hours daily. The same Bluebike system running in Boston runs here as well. There are 8 stations total, and bikes can be returned to any rack. There's a rack by the ferry terminal, one by the train station, one up by Salem Willows, and the rest are scattered around downtown. You'll need to install an app on your smartphone to use the system. $3 every 30 minutes until you return the bike. (updated Jun 2022)
By car[edit]
The downtown area is often congested, and becomes all but impassable to cars during October. Do not drive to Salem on Halloween. On street parking is generally good for about 2-4 hours and costs a dollar or two per hour. The city also owns a few garages and off-street lots if you're in need of some longer-term parking. Your best bet is going to be in one of the lots off of Church Street. There's a few surface lots there as well as the Museum Place Garage. Your other option is the MBTA parking lot and the adjacent Crescent lot. The Town of Salem has a great map showing all the gory parking details.

See[edit]
If you've only got one day, take a brisk walk through the Peabody Essex Museum, then maybe try to squeeze in a tour of the House of Seven Gables. Spend the rest of the day investigating whatever piques your interest along Derby street in the Maritime National Historic Site.
With extra time, it's easy to tailor an itinerary to your interests. There's plenty more to see at the PEM, architecture buffs will head for the Chestnut Street District, and nature lovers have a variety of options beyond the city center to explore. Parents might try Forest River Park or perhaps some of the kitschy stuff with older children. If you're open to it, the Satanic Temple is a true "only in Salem" experience.

Museums[edit]
The Peabody Essex Museum's main entrance
42.522222-70.89251 Peabody Essex Museum (PEM), 161 Essex St, toll-free: +1-866-745-1876. Tu-Su 10AM-5M. Open 3rd Th of the month until 9PM.

Founded in 1799, it is the oldest continuously operating museum in the United States. The museum owns and exhibits a number of historic houses in downtown Salem. In 2003, it completed a massive $100-million renovation and expansion, designed by architect Moshe Safdie, and moved a 200-year-old 16-room Chinese home from Xiuning County in southeastern China to the grounds of the museum. Gift shop available in person and online.

Made famous by the eponymous 1851 Nathaniel Hawthorne novel. The oldest sections of the home date to 1668, when it was built for Captain John Turner and his family. The home has been altered and modified countless times over the centuries as family fortunes ebbed and flowed. Eventually; in 1908, wealthy philanthropist Caroline Emmerton purchased the home and set about effecting its restoration. Supervised by Boston's city architect; they restored the home to its former glory, making only the occasional sacrifice to historical accuracy. Visitors today will discover low ceilings, extensive Georgian paneling, and hidden staircases among hundreds of period curios. Walking the grounds is always a charming activity. The fresh ocean breezes are sure to invigorate. Also on site is the home where Nathaniel Hawthorne was born. It was moved here in 1958 and is worth a few minutes of your time. $20, $12 children 5-12, $5 grounds pass.   (updated Apr 2022)
42.5215-70.89893 The Witch House (Jonathan Corwin House), 310 Essex St, ☏ +1 978-744-8815. The Witch House is the last extant building with direct ties to the 1692 Salem witch trials. An excellent example of 17th-century architecture, it was probably built sometime between 1620 and 1642. Bought by Judge Jonathan Corwin in 1675, he would go on to live here for over forty years. As a local magistrate and civic leader, Corwin was called upon to investigate the claims of diabolical activity when a surge of witchcraft accusations arose in and around Salem. Eventually, he would send 19 people to the gallows, all of whom maintained their innocence and refused to admit to witchcraft. No interrogations or trials were conducted within the Witch House, nor were any of the accused brought here. The house remained in the Corwin family until the 1940s. At this time the Witch House was moved about 35 ft (11 m) to its current location and was restored to its 17th century origins. Today it basically looks as it would have in Corwin's time, although the gambrel roof was altered.   (updated Apr 2022)

This small park features a stone wall with each of the deceased's names etched in stone. Quiet and somber, the ledge was dedicated in 2017, 325 years after the executions. Free. (updated Jul 2022)
42.524-70.889212 Salem Common, N Washington Square. 24 hours daily. On this field in 1637 the East Regiment militia performed various drills and exercises. This day of training became known as "the first muster"—eventually leading to the birth of the US National Guard. 30 years later, in 1667, villagers decided the park should be held as common land where their livestock could graze. As the town grew and the park could no longer fulfill its purpose, it was closed in. The current handsome wrought iron fence dates from 1850.

Chestnut Street District[edit]
Opulence on display, the power of the Old China Trade remains visible along Chestnut street
The Pickering House—oldest in Salem—has had a few updates over the years
Perhaps the perfect spot for a stroll. The Chestnut Street District calls out to architecture buffs, budding photographers, and anyone seeking a brief respite from the crowds. Many grand mansions line these boulevards, serving to showcase the enormous wealth created by the Old China Trade. Although demolished, Samuel McIntire's home and workshop at 31 Summer Street still anchors this historic area. Roughly bounded by Bridge, Summer, Beckford, and Broad Streets and referred to locally as the McIntire Historic District, it was created in 1973 and contains some 407 notable buildings.

42.519611-70.89932520 Hamilton Hall, 9 Chestnut St, ☏ +1 978-744-0805. M-F 10AM-2PM. One of the finest examples of Federal style building, Hamilton Hall was completed in 1807 by Samuel McIntire. Upon opening the townsfolk held many celebrations and banquets here, feting high status guests. That tradition continues today; hosting concerts, lectures, weddings, and other joyful events in the lives of Salem's residents. The hall is owned by a non-profit, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. Free.   (updated Sep 2022)
42.5228-70.921 Peirce-Nichols House, 80 Federal St. Irregular tours offered by PEM. One of McIntire's earlier commissions, this home was built in the Georgian style for Jerathmiel Peirce and completed around 1784.

The home has been owned by Peabody Essex Museum since 1917, and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1968.   (updated Sep 2022)

After some squabbling over the inheritance, heir Nathaniel West completed the mansion in 1821. Four rooms from Elias' earlier home were moved to fashionable Chestnut Street to make up the core of the house. Purchased and restored in 1911 by Anna Phillips and her husband, they lived here until their deaths in 1955. Today the mansion is owned by Historic New England and showcases an eclectic collection of family heirlooms and historic technologies. $15, $13 seniors, $7 children.   (updated Sep 2022)
42.5184-70.923 Pickering House, 18 Broad St, ☏ +1 978-744-4777. Su 10AM-3PM. Built in 1664 by John Pickering, a carpenter from Coventry; this is the oldest house in Salem. It's also the oldest home in America continuously owned by the same family. For over 330 years, each new generation of Pickering would alter the home to suit the times and their changing needs. Ceiling heights were raised, extra wings were constructed, and plenty of gothic detailing added for good measure. It's a great place to spend an hour if you're interested in discovering the details of lives lived long ago. $10, residents $5, children free.   (updated Sep 2022)
42.5212-70.899824 Ropes Mansion, 318 Essex St, ☏ +1 978-745-9500. Sa Su noon-4PM; gardens sunrise-sunset daily.

Three generations of Ropes called this mansion home, until it was given to a trust in 1907. The building has seen many renovations and restorations over its life, but generally maintains its original form. Today the mansion is open to the public and controlled by the Peabody Essex Museum.

Salem Maritime National Historic Site[edit]
The Friendship of Salem docks along Derby Wharf in the Maritime National Historic Site
Spend an afternoon along Salem's historic nine acre waterfront, where a dozen remarkable buildings span over 600 years of maritime history. The park was established in 1938 as America's first historic site. Plaques throughout the area offer interpretive explanations of the infamous triangular trade (rum, molasses, slaves), privateering during the revolutionary war, and the Old China Trade in the post-war period. Most visitors simply walk down Derby street and explore whatever strikes them. If you're into it, however; begin your visit along the tiny walkway adjacent to the Narbonne House on Essex street. This short path is part of the NPS and takes you past a formal garden and several historic views.

42.52155-70.8871425 Custom House, 176 Derby St, ☏ +1 978-740-1650. 10AM-noon, 1-4PM daily. Salem's 13th customs house, this one dates from 1819 and was built to represent the power of the federal government. Pay a visit to reveal exhibits on the tools of the Custom Service, the work of the Customs inspectors, and the office of Nathaniel Hawthorne, the famous American author whose three-year stint in the Salem Custom House inspired his classic novel, The Scarlet Letter. Free. (updated Oct 2022)
42.516556-70.88358326 Derby Wharf (Derby Wharf Light). 24 hours daily. Reaching nearly half a mile by 1806, this wharf is Salem's longest. At the height of its power, over 20 buildings here stored goods imported from around the globe. Today it provides beautiful, if windy, views of the harbor and park itself. Visitors who make it to the end are rewarded with up close views of Derby Wharf Lighthouse, built 1871. Free.   (updated Oct 2022)
42.52012-70.8865627 Friendship of Salem. Irregular dockside tours via Waite & Peirce. This replica ship usually functions as a floating museum; however, the vessel is fully functional and Coast Guard certified. She was designed after a model of the original (on display at PEM), and is occasionally taken out under full sail for crew trainings and tall ship events. The original was a three-masted trading ship built in Salem in 1797. After circumnavigating the world over a dozen times, she would eventually be taken by British forces during the War of 1812, then stripped and sold for parts. Free.   (updated Oct 2022)
42.52268-70.8873728 Narbonne House, 71 Essex St. Irregular tours via Salem Armory Visitor Center. Built in 1675, this home wouldn't be added to the park until 1964. Acting as a counterpoint to some of the more grandiose structures, this is a remarkable example of a 17th century middle-class family home. Exhibits within the house showcase rare early ephemera and artifacts discovered during archeological digs on-site. The taller bits belong to the original structure, which remains (mostly) as it was when absorbed in the 1960s. The small adjacent sidewalk is a "hidden gem" entrance to the larger Salem Maritime National Historic Site. Free. (updated Oct 2022)
Do[edit]
Dusk at Salem Willows
Unless it's calling to you, most items on this list are skippable if pressed for time. Although parents (and children at heart) should make note of the options available at Salem Willows. 

42.5319-70.87441 Fort Lee, Fort Ave. 24 hours daily. These 5 point irregular star fort is what remains of earthworks constructed in 1776, during the Revolutionary War. Some original bits remain, although it has been modified dozens of times over the years. Granted to the Federal Government in 1867, it was returned to Salem in 1922. Some trails and interpretive signs were added at the nation's bicentennial, but they were removed and the site is today overgrown. The paths are well trod today, and it's certainly worth a visit to any history buff. Free.   (updated Apr 2022)
42.5473-70.7982 Misery Islands (Float a ½ mile across Salem Sound by private boat, dinghy, canoe, or kayak.), ☏ +1 978 526-8687. Sunrise-sunset daily. In the past Great Misery Island played host to a golf club and manicured course with over two dozen permanent cottages. However; a fire in 1926 destroyed pretty much everything, and an 87-acre nature reserve was established here in 1935. Today the islands are uninhabited and managed by The Trustees. The peculiar name originates with shipbuilder Robert Moulton. After being stranded on the islands during a winter storm in the 1620s, he described his experience as "three miserable days". Nearby, Little Misery Island can be reached from Great Misery on foot by wading across at low tide. If you lack a private vessel, Essex Heritage Tours offers occasional day trips here in summer. Free.   (updated Apr 2022)

Based around a recreated Puritan village, it gives visitors the opportunity to observe how the lives of Salem's earliest English settlers might have been lived. Holds space for the Naumkeag and other Massachusett peoples. You'll get some amazing pictures, but overall it's quite small, you'd be hard pressed to spend 30 minutes here. $5.   (updated Aug 2022)
42.535022-70.8694754 Salem Willows Arcade and Park, 165 Fort Ave, ☏ +1 978-745-0251. 11AM-9PM daily. An oceanfront neighborhood and amusement park with a bit of a carnival atmosphere. It's quite good fun, if you're looking for something slightly kitschy and definitely well loved. You'll find a merry-go-round and other rides for smaller children, and an arcade for the older ones. The arcade features video games, pinball, skiball, tickets & prizes, air-hockey tables, and so on. Unfortunately, the only real food options are low quality pizza and Chinese, which you may have to wait over 30 minutes for! The exception to this rule is E.W. Hobbs, well known for quality popcorn and ice cream. Feel free to bring your own eats, the grassy parks and beaches make perfect picnic spots. Parking is ample, and public restrooms are available. Historically, Salem Willows is named for the European white willow trees planted here in 1801. The trees created a shaded canopy for patients convalescing at a nearby smallpox hospital. The area became a public park in 1858, and in the 20th century it became a North Shore summer destination. The beaches here are a great spot to watch 4th of July fireworks; as you can see the shows put on by Salem, Beverly, and Marblehead. Free.   (updated Aug 2022)

While this tour group offers several interesting walking tours, the real highlight is the excursions offered on their 32 foot vessel, Naumkeag. During the high season they offer trips to see Bakers Island Light and ​Misery Island. The trip is slightly adventurous, and visitors must be at least 4 years old and be able to withstand some light exposure to the elements.

Events[edit]
 Halloween, ☏ +1 978-741-3252. October 31. Halloween is the absolute zenith of Salem's tourist season, when about half a million visitors descend upon the town. Prices are higher, and all restaurants, events, and hotels will have sold out months in advance of the holiday. More kid-friendly events take place during daylight hours, and things get more wild as the night progresses. If you'd like to avoid the worst of the crowds, the presence of Halloween vibes (and porta-potties) remains strong throughout the entire month of October. Do not drive into town, it can take hours in traffic from Boston, and some streets close to cars. The ferry continues to operate and the MBTA runs extra trains to accommodate revelers. Prepare yourself for an experience, wear a costume, bring snacks, and get ready to party! (updated Feb 2023)

Visitors should expect to find a wide range of elevated fare, often rubbing shoulders alongside classic dining experiences. Many tourists descend on the area for the first class seafood options, which are in no short supply. Unsurprisingly, many are found along the looping Wharf Street, fronting the harbor. The highest concentration of restaurants can be found on Washington street from Derby to Essex streets. Lappin Park in particular has a few worthy mid-range options along its borders. As with all tourist zones, local gems await your discovery just a short walk from the center of the action. These eateries remain open throughout the winter months, when usually the only changes you'll see are to the menu.

Sleep[edit]
Due to its small size, pretty much everything in Salem is going to be "right in the heart of it all". The high season here runs from Memorial Day until Halloween. Book well in advance to ensure your bunk! Sleeping here on Halloween night? Make your reservations by Thanksgiving. For real. Most accommodations are basically the same price, around $300 once you factor in taxes, fees, and surcharges. Same story for AirBnB and similar services. If you're looking to save money, there is a campsite on Winter Island. If roughing it's not your thing, there are more affordable options along the Route 1 & I-95 corridor in Peabody and Danvers, but then you'll have to deal with driving here.





"More weight"
One of the few men to be executed during the witch trials, Giles Corey was pressed to death in September of 1692.
After being accused of witchcraft, he refused to enter a plea of either guilty or innocent. According to the law of that era, one could not be tried in court without first entering a plea. While rarely put into practice, a form of torture—pressing—was used as a threat to coerce pleas from the accused. In this case; however, it was in Corey's financial interest not to enter a plea. He was 80 years old and could see clearly which way the winds were blowing. A guilty verdict would forfeit his right to pass his estate down to his children.
After some months in prison, Giles was stripped naked, tied down, and heavy planks were laid across his body. Weighty stones were placed atop the planks while Sheriff George Corwin asked how he pleaded. For three days Corey's only reply would be "More weight." After his death, his wife Martha (also accused of witchcraft) would be hung just a few days later.
The public and gruesome nature of Corey's execution could have been the event that caused the colonists to "wake up" from their witch-related hysteria. His estate was transferred in accordance with his will, although his heirs would be harangued for years to come. Eventually Giles and Martha had their excommunications from the church reversed. But only Giles had the charges of witchcraft formally withdrawn.

Stay safe[edit]
As in the rest of the country, dial 911 in an emergency for help. Overall, Salem is a very safe city with a crime rate far below the US average. Take the same standard precautions you would anywhere else. Keep valuables out of sight, don't flash wads of cash, take your headphones off, and so on. Many visitors come to Salem to blow off steam, so don't be surprised to see increasingly drunken behavior as the night wears on. Bars tend to close around midnight-1AM. Finally, don't let any black cats cross your path, and if you find a monkey's paw leave it alone!

Motif #1 in Rockport is "the most often-painted building in America"
Nature lovers might enjoy exploring almost 2,000 acres in Topsfield's Ipswich River Wildlife Sanctuary. The views are great by foot, but exploring by paddle can really shape your sense of the land, and afford some truly unique wildlife encounters. The famous Topsfield Fair is also well worth your time if you're visiting in late September.
For a taste of the English countryside, look no further than Crane Estate in Ipswich. Featuring the ostentatious mansion Castle Hill, acres of gardens replete with hiking trails, as well as the breathtaking Crane Beach.
Popular resort town just to the south, Nahant boasts some fantastic beaches and superlative ocean views.
Head north-east to Singing Beach in Manchester-by-the-Sea. If it's dry, the sands may seem to "sing" as you walk along.
Further north-east takes you to Rockport, and the end of the line. Stroll Bearskin Neck where densely packed studios, shops, and restaurants wind along a narrow road backed by the Atlantic Ocean. Don't forget to snap a photo of Motif #1 before you leave.
Did you enjoy Salem's historical appeal, but were hoping for less tourists? Check out one time whaling capital New Bedford, filled with great museums, history, and Pastel de Nata to boot. About a 1½- to 2-hour drive to the south depending on traffic.
