Cold Spring is a village in Putnam County in the state of New York in the United States of America. Its location in the scenic Hudson Highlands and proximity to a commuter railroad makes it a popular weekend escape from New York City.


Understand[edit]
Main Street
Founded in 1846 and holding an economy in iron production throughout the Civil War, it is what essentially created the village. It was named a Federal Historic District in 1973. Prominence had faded since the foundry closed in 1911, but its notoriety locally in the antiquities trade is negligible in comparison to the sheer touristic appeal of the village.
Cold Spring enjoys the temperate climate, but bad weather breaks on the mountains, as such you can enjoy more than 260 days of sunshine a year, as well as the appropriately impressive thunder storm. To hear the echoes roll through the valley is really something! However, if you will be hiking, water is a must. The trees are appropriately shady, but you can go for miles in the mountains.
The tourist information booth is downtown by the river, on the east-side of the tracks. They also house two bathrooms behind them, which are usually clean.
There are several denominations in the area, specifically in Cold Spring are the Catholic church, near the river, The Episcopalian church on Main Street which is next to the traffic light, the Presbyterian church up one street from the Episcopalian, the Methodist church near the School, and the Baptist church which famously only has a handful of members and shares its priest. They have been a new marketing strategy as 'the Church on the Hill' they are also the famous divide between Nelsonville and Cold Spring.

By boat[edit]
By bus[edit]
Get around[edit]
There is no easily accessed taxi service in Cold Spring, but on the weekends you can take the train north one station to a stop which lets you out right at Breakneck, a popular mountain to hike up, especially in clear weather when you can look up and down the Hudson River. Any train will stop on its way south in the town of Garrison as well.
Also on the weekends is a trolley that does a circuit a few times a day. To acquire some more information about it, visit the tourism information booth by the bathrooms on the East side of the train tracks. There is often a volunteer there from the Village Board. The ride is scenic and relaxed, reputedly only costing a dime. The stops are various points of interest in Cold Spring, the Garrison train station and Boscobel.
The most common way to get around is to walk. The country can be steep so leave yourself time. The Hudson Valley enjoys around 260 days of sunshine a year, usually more, so please hydrate appropriately! The cheapest water to be found is either free from the faucets in the always-open bathrooms down by the tracks (the water is reputedly from the Catskills and is the same that services the school's water fountains) or for one-dollar at the Chinese Take-out, Ming Moon.
