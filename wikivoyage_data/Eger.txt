Castle as seen from minaret

For other places with the same name, see Eger (disambiguation).

Eger is a historic town in Northern Hungary, capital of Heves County, situated between the Mátra and Bükk mountains. Eger district outside of the city is covered in a separate article.


Understand[edit]
Eger is mainly known for its castle, thermal baths, historic buildings (including the northernmost Turkish minaret) and, above all else, the best Hungarian red wines in the "Valley of the beautiful women". When you plan your trip, it looks like a small town for which half a day is more than enough, but 3 days may not even be enough to enjoy it fully, even in the winter. In 2017, it was home to 54,000 people.
The majority of visitors come for a single day (mostly Slovakians), not staying overnight. Ukrainians and Russians frequent the castle, as do many Italians. Around the town you may also run into many German-speaking visitors.

By train[edit]
Trains leave the Budapest Keleti station each hour. The ones leaving at odd hours are direct, the ones leaving at even hours require you to change trains in Füzesabony. Most of these trains are gyors (fast) trains and will take about 2 hours and 20 minutes to arrive. Hourly IC trains will take you directly to Füzesabony, cutting the total travel time to just under 2 hours, but a reservation is required.
If you come from Miskolc your options are similar, except there is no direct service and you will have to change trains in Füzesabony. IC trains take just under an hour to arrive.

By bus[edit]
Buses leave the bus stop behind Budapest's Stadionok station for Eger twice an hour and the trip takes a little over 2 hours. The quarter past bus takes the highway and takes two hours, and the quarter to bus takes smaller roads and takes 2½ hours. 
Buses (1343 and 1344) leave from Debrecen's main bus station Kulso Vasarter ~4x a day, and take about 2½ hours. They return to Debrecen from Eger most days at 06:20am, 10:15, 13:00, 13:45, 14:45pm, but the bus station info desk will have the best information. As of June 2023, the trip is 2520 Ft each way.
You can buy a ticket on the bus. The buses take only cash in the local currency. Get there 20 minutes early during peak times, as there might be a queue and you might not get a seat. Most major cities in Hungary also have direct bus connections to Eger.

By car[edit]
The easiest way to arrive is to take the M3 as far as Füzesabony, then continue north on route 25. For a more scenic route from Miskolc you can drive through the windy roads of the Bükk mountains.

Get around[edit]
The train station is located about a 10-minute walk from the downtown area and most attractions. Walk over to Deák Ferenc út and walk north until you reach the Basilica. You can also take buses #10, 11, or 12. If you arrived by bus, the town bus station is located downtown directly behind the basilica.
Once downtown, the city is small and best walked. You won't need alpine boots, but high-heeled shoes are still not good as there is much cobblestone pavement downtown.
However, the town has a taxi service which is especially useful if you arrive by train or if your hotel is outside of the town centre. (phones: 555-555; 333-333).
Also, if you go for some outdoor activities near the town there are some buses connecting the town with the suburbs. Check at the main bus station for schedules.
There is also a touristy tram (a fun experience) that runs occasionally from the city center (Egeszsegaz u. ?) to the Valley of Beautiful Women (wine caves valley). Easiest to ride it back when you've enjoyed some wines and don't want to walk back up the hill. 1200 Ft each way (June 2023).

47.8976820.375142 Gárdonyi Géza Theater, Hatvani kapu tér, 4, ☏ +36 36 310-026. Probably the only theater in town, quite modern and comfortable; attracts cream of the city, especially on holiday concerts. 
 Horseback riding by Mátyus Udvarház (Petró Tanya) (5 minutes by taxi from the middle of Eger), ☏ +36 36 517-937, info@matyusudvarhaz.hu. In winter, rides start at 10:00 (to 12:00) and 13:00 (to 17:00). Can offer good gallops and intense rides if guide can tell that you have enough experience. There is breathtaking scenery even in winter time: along and across vineyards; up the hills; through the forest; in beautiful fields. Ride whatever the weather, even in winter. Recommended by Senator Ház. Among personnel, only 1 or 2 speak basic English (neither can be a guide); in off-season, English emails are not responded to--call instead. The only shortcoming: guiding rider smokes on the route. Have some Panzio of the same owner next to the stalls (closed in winter). Horses: Fantom (1994): too slow as a leader on a gallop. Sigi (1996): trials rider in the first minutes, restless and fast through the route, but rarely keeps the distance. Hadfi (1996): need constant attention of rider on a route. Guided route: Ft 4,000 per hour per person..

Drink[edit]
Wine[edit]
Eger is the centre of one of the top wine regions in Europe. Egri Bikavér is most famous cuvee here, but there are several others definitely worth a sip, such as dry whites.
Egri Bikavér (Bull's Blood) is a strong red Hungarian wine which supposedly saved a clever Hungarian girl from her fate with a Turkish sultan. During the time of the Turkish occupation, it is said a young girl was summoned to become a member of the local sultan's harem. Not wanting this fate for his daughter, her father gave her a bottle of Egri Bikavér to take to the sultan. He told her to tell the ruler it was bull's blood, and would make him invincible. The sultan, being Muslim, was unaccustomed to alcohol, and proceeded to pass out, leaving the daughter unharmed. That's a legend -- but in real life, also be careful with Egri Bikavér. It's excellent, but strong stuff!
The real story is an important piece of Hungarian history:
the "bull's blood" made there - is a cuvee (two types of red wine mixed). This name was given by the Turkish horde trying to conquer Eger - and then proceed towards Austria, etc. They failed: there were approx. 2000 Hungarians inside Eger, and 200,000 Turks outside. They had always seen the Hungarians drinking red wine, but they did not know what it was, and they assumed this must be bull's blood which makes these warriors so strong and fearless.

Wine shops[edit]
 Wine shop (at Dr. Hibay Károly u., just across Senator Ház). Nice place to taste and try wines. Walls and windows are all packed with wine bottles, there are even some mounted in the floor. Offers selection of wine-tasting menu, with full range of cheese and snacks.

Valley of Beautiful Women (Szépasszony-völgy)[edit]
47.8904120.3592824 Szépasszony Valley (Szépasszony Völgy, lit.Valley  of the Beautiful Woman), Eger, Szépasszonyvölgy (2 km west-southwest from town centre, within about 15-20 minutes walk from centre of town, and easy to get to (but much harder to walk home from); follow the street signs with the English text "Nice Woman Valley"). Szépasszony Valley is the main place to go for winetasting in the town. This having about 200 small wine cellars have strongly become connected to the fame of the wines of Eger in the past centuries. Here sell local wines with very good prices. There is no inambiguous explanation for the origin of the name, neither for the date of the construction of the first cellars. The cellars were cut into rhiolit tufa of volcanic origin very easy to shape and which can be found under and around the town several hundred metres thick. Another advantage is that the wines are stored in them at constant, 10-15 °C temperature all the year around. Moreover, the moss, fungi living in the cellars create a special atmosphere, their pleasant smell supports aging of wine, developing their bouquet. Vendors will fill whatever container you have with you, so bring along some extra pop bottles. Most vendors also sell plastic jugs that you may take with you. Sometimes you pay for the glasses you drink there, though occasionally you will only be charged for the wine you take with you. Some wines are only available in bottles, and may be a little more expensive. A few of the places have hosts with very good English, though many do not. A liter of wine runs between Ft 1200 and 5000, 1 dl tastings Ft 450-1200 (June 2023).  
 Bíró Borozó. Elderly women are  great hosts, outgoing but not annoying, with good English and a sense of humor. Some wine is poured from a barrel through a decanter--it's a nice show, ask for a demonstration. Some is provided from bottles.
