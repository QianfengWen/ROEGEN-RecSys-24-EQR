Patiala is a nice city, rich in cultural heritage. Its history dates back to the middle of the 18th century, when Baba Ala Singh established a princely state in the Malwa region of Punjab. In 1763 Ala Singh built the fort known as Qila Mubaraka which was his permanent seat until his death two years later. Under his successors, the kingdom expanded and the fort continued to be a residence of the royal family. During the Anglo-Sikh wars, the rulers of Patiala were an ally of the British. As a result of their "meritorious services", the British granted them the title of Maharajas. In the aftermath of the Indian Independence Act, Patiala's last ruler signed an accession to the Indian Union. The city is also called a CM City (CM means Chief Minister). Patiala was a part of PEPSU (PEPSU means Patiala and East Punjab States Union), and many Government of Punjab offices, as well as head corporate offices, are in Patiala rather than Punjab's capital Chandigarh. So, you can also say Patiala is a mini-capital of Punjab State.
As elsewhere in Punjab, November marks the disappearance of the monsoon. Sunny skies prevail till mid February. Daytime temperatures are comfortable. This is undoubtedly one of the best times to visit.
