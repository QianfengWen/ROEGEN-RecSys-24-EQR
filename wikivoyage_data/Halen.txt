Halen is a municipality in Limburg, Flanders (Belgium).


Understand[edit]
In 1914 Halen has written history by beating the Germans in the "battle of the Silver Helmets" during World War one. A museum on this matter exists in Loksbergen one of the parts of Halen. there are two rivers passing Halen called "de Velpe" and "de Gete". In 1646 the construction of a water-grain-mill started. The mill still exists. Halen has multiple municipalities called Halen, Zelem, Loksbergen, Zelk.
Halen is the centre part between the other municipalities. It is well located between Hasselt and Diest.
Loksbergen (bergen is the Dutch word for hills) has some small hills and stunning sunken roads. They are protected natural domains and available for the public. In the 19th century it had some smaller pots bakeries and a clog factory that now is transformed in a big wood dealership. It has mostly fruit plantations and is a paradise with your Vespa, bicycle, motor or endless walking between the fields.
Zelem is the best side of Halen for living. It has lots of forests and nature. With its big monastery and beautiful views of the Demer valley and the typical brown river called "de zwarte beek". The brown colour comes from the ferro in the ground. It has lots of coniferous and deciduous forests open for the public and for free.
Zelk also has some of the most beautiful sunken roads of the region. Just like Zelem there are mainly fields and grasslands. Agriculture is still very important in this region.
