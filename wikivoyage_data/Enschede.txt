Enschede is a city in the Netherlands. It is the largest city of the Twente region (a former center of textile industry), and also of the Overijssel province. Enschede was designated the greenest town in the Netherlands in 2003.


Understand[edit]
Oude Markt, Enschede
On May 13, 2000, a fireworks storage in Enschede exploded, destroying an entire neighborhood and killing 23 people, including 4 firemen. This catastrophe is known in the Netherlands as the Vuurwerkramp, Dutch for fireworks disaster. Since this event, the city has undergone a major reconstruction process. After the fall of the textile industry, Enschede strives to become a center of business, innovation and technology through the Business and Science park next to the University of Twente.
As a city famous for being "destroyed and reconstructed" many times, Enschede does not offer much in terms of historical attractions. However, the city has nice displays of contemporary Dutch architecture, particularly in the Roombeek neighborhood and at University of Twente, and its nightlife, cultural vibrancy and shopping options are quite developed for a city of its size.

Talk[edit]
Official language is Dutch. Almost all understand English. Since Enschede is close to Germany, there are more tourist information brochures in German than English.

By train[edit]
From elsewhere in the Netherlands, Enschede is easily accessible by train from all major Dutch cities, and can be reached from smaller cities with at most one or two transfers. The journey time from Amsterdam is approximately two hours. An excellent (train only) travel planner is available at Nationale Spoorwegen. Hourly intercity trains from Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, The Hague and Zwolle terminate at 52.2223726.8904951 Enschede railway station. If you need to use a connecting bus or ferry from within the Netherlands, use 9292.
From Germany, direct trains (ending in Enschede railway station) are available from Gronau, Dortmund, and Münster. From Münster, it takes 1 hr 20 min by hourly regional train to Enschede. To reach Enschede from Berlin, a stopover is available in Hengelo (a small city about 10 minutes by train from Enschede). Further guidance is available at Die Bahn.

By bus[edit]
KLM provides free bus transfer for travellers arriving or departing on KLM flights from Amsterdam Schiphol airport. The bus leaves Amsterdam Schiphol twice a day, at 09:05 and 21:00. The entire ride takes 3 hours.
Flixbus provides bus service from major cities Netherlands and Germany to Enschede. Buses stop at Enschede train station and University of Twente.

By car[edit]
There is a large parking lot underneath the market square in the centre of the city, the H.J. van Heekplein, which provides approximately 2000 parking spaces for visitors arriving by car.
There is a cheaper park-and-ride solution available at the expanded P+R Zuiderval. Frequent buses travel from here directly to the city center (approximately 5 minutes by bus). This is especially useful if you are arriving in Enschede via the highway, as the lot is just off the highway exit.

Get around[edit]
Enschede is a city best explored by bicycle, on foot or by public transportation. Parking spaces can be difficult to find and there are often traffic jams, especially during rush hour. The city center is also closed to motorized vehicles.

The oldest pub in Enschede is Het Bolwerk, in the Bolwerkstraat, where one can drink a wide variety of beers and spirits, with the shocking exception of the Enschede-brewed Grolsch.
While the hipper crowds turn to places like Aspen Valley and Central Park, the alternative scene spends their Saturday night in Atak, where one can see a wide variety of customers from hippies to gothics to hard-core-metal-lovers. The student associations also have their own pub in de Pakkerij, like the largest student association of Enschede, AEGEE-Enschede which is often also open to visits from AEGEE students visiting from other European student cities.
