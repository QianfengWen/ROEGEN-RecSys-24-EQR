Get in[edit]
From Copenhagen, the most convenient way to reach Fredensborg is to catch an S-train to Hillerød, and change to the Lille Nord[dead link] train towards Fredensborg and Helsingør, which sees departures towards the city twice per hour most of the day.  It is possible to use the same line from Helsingør.  The trip from Copenhagen takes about an hour.
It is also possible to catch a bus from Humlebæk (Louisiana Art Museum, bus 844 and 733E, 25 minutes).  From Nørreport station in central Copenhagen there is a rushhour express bus (06:00-09:00, 13:00-17:00), which completes the journey in 45 minutes (bus 173E)
If you have your own wheels take the Helsingørmotorvejen highway (E47 and E55) to exit 7 (Kokkedal), turn left, and follow Fredensborg Kongevej to the end.

Go next[edit]
A good one day itinerary, which we could call "a day in the Nordsjælland of the kings", if we were the local tourist organisation - but we're not - so let us just say that it involves the three grand palaces of the region; Take the S-train to Hillerød and see the Frederiksborg Palace and museum and go for a stroll in the nice barque gardens - retrace your steps to the station and jump on the train to Fredensborg to see the palace from the pretty park. Jump back on the same train (though unless you are superman, the same train 2 hours later), and continue the journey to Helsingør, do an L through the old town, pass the harbour and finish the castle viewing with Hamlet's Kronborg, and nice views over the sound and Sweden. Head back to station and take the Kystbanen Railway back to Copenhagen. If you have time to spare, you could stop by the fabulous Louisiana Art museum in Humlebæk on your way back.
