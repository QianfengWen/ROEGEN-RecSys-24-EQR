Ashford is a hamlet (population 652 in 2016) in the New England region in New South Wales, Australia.


Understand[edit]
Albury Street, located in the centre of Ashford
The site of Ashford was originally surveyed in 1851 as Edgerton, and renamed to Frazer's Creek when a post office opened in 1853. The name changed to Ashford Frazer's Creek in 1860, and finally to Ashford in 1863. No one knows why the name Ashford was applied. A police station was opened in 1864 and the first school opened in 1868. The bushranger Frederick Ward, better known as Captain Thunderbolt, rode through the district in 1867. Tobacco farming and a local coal mine were major industries but these have long ceased, and cattle farming and sheep farming now dominate the local economy. Ashford is in the Inverell Shire Local Government Area.
