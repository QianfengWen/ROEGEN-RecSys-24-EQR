Understand[edit]
Downtown Eustis
History[edit]
The town was ultimately named after the nearby lake, which was named after General Abraham Eustis. During the latter half of the 19th century, a citrus grove was planted and a hotel opened, and the town became a port. Cold weather in the winter of 1894-1895 slowed local development. The town became more prosperous as a winter haven for northerners, which brought success to the Ocklawaha Hotel. The population grew steadily during the 20th century from about 400 people at the 1900 census to about 4,000 in 1950 and more than 15,000 in 2000. By 2019 the population had passed 20,000.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
 State Route (SR)-19  enters Eustis from the north, as it passes just east of Fort Mason, a suburb of Eustis. FL-19 then goes between Trout Lake and Lake Eustis as it enters downtown Eustis as Bay St as an one way street (southbound) through the downtown while Grove St is the northbound route. South of downtown the two streets once again converge and FL-19 as Bay St continues south to an on-ramp to US-441.
 State Route (SR)-44  comes to the eastern edge of Eustis where SR-44 turns south towards US Hwy 441 on the NE edge of Mount Dora. The road itself continues west into town from the turn off as Orange Ave. Going east, SR-44 goes 29 mi (47 km) to DeLand (nearest Amtrak Station).
 US Hwy 441 goes across the southern edge of town. Travelers can go north on SR-19 or Lake Eustice drive to go into town from Leesburg (13 mi (21 km) west). US 441 continues east, into/around Mt Dora and down 37 mi (60 km) towards Orlando via Apopka where it enters as W Orange Blossom Trail.
