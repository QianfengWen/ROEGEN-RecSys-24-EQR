Waterford is a community of about 3,100 people (2016) in Norfolk County, in Ontario. The area surrounding the town is primarily agricultural land, with tomatoes, tobacco and corn among the chief crops. Area farmers generally suffered from the decline of the tobacco industry, but natural health and organic crops are being explored, such as ginseng, as well as lavender and wine grapes.

History[edit]
Waterford's earliest known inhabitants, from around the year 1000 until approximately 300–350 years later, were the Algonquin nation. They were noted flint-workers and evidence of their skill in crafting arrowheads is still to be found in open worked field areas surrounding the village. The next wave of inhabitants were the Attawandaron nation, the Neutrals, who occupied the region from about 1350 until their absorption by the Iroquois 300 years later. The last significant native nation to occupy the area was the Mississaugas.
Founded in 1794, this community was established as a saw and grist mill community. Settlement of this area, with rich soil and large forests, within Townsend Township, started in 1794, and by 1782 Paul Averill was operating saw and grist-mills on Nanticoke Creek. By 1851, Waterford contained the Township Hall and many industries, including a large agricultural implements factory built by James Green. The railway arrived in 1871 and helped increase growth.
