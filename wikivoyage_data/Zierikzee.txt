Zierikzee is a town in the municipality of Schouwen-Duiveland in the Dutch province of Zeeland. The city has 11,000 inhabitants and is the capital of the municipality.


Understand[edit]
Zierikzee is a historic town on the Eastern Scheldt. It has 568 official monuments, a unique medieval street pattern and the oldest still playing carillon of the Netherlands. During high season it is crowded with visitors, mainly Dutch and German. It's a good hub to explore the rest of the province which has much to offer both culturally and scenically. Historical cities, attractions and beaches are nearby. Zierikzee offers good hotels and restaurants and is a pleasant city to stay.

History[edit]
De Haene (early 14th century)
The name Siricasha (Zierikzee) was first mentioned in 1156. The city rights were confirmed and expended by count William II of Holland. It is unknown when the city received its rights for the first time. At the end of the Middle Ages Zierikzee was an important city. In 1304 the Battle of Zierikzee took place where a combined French and Holland fleet was successfully in defeating the Flemish who had invaded Zeeland and Holland. During the 80 years war the city was taken by the Geuzen (Beggars) and later recaptured by the Spaniards. They left the city four months later after a mutiny of Spanish soldiers because of arrears. In the 17th century Zierikzee was primarily a fishery city and had a commercial fleet that limited herself to European waters. Unlike Middelburg the city had little input in the colonization of East and West Indian regions. In the 18th century the trade became more important than fishing. The merchant had to cope with setbacks about the middle of the 18th century. The fourth Anglo-Dutch war resulted in a decline of the fleet and the inhabitants of Zierikzee fell from 10,000 to 6,000. During the 19th century Zierikzee became to a more or less forgotten city.
