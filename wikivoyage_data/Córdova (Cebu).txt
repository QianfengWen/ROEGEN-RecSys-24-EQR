Location of Cordova on Cebu
Córdova[dead link] is a small (population around 60,000) municipality in Cebu Province, part of Metro Cebu.


Understand[edit]
Córdova is the southern tip of Mactan Island (the rest of the island is Lapu-Lapu) plus some smaller islands nearby including the southern part of the Olango Island Group. Like Lapu-Lapu to the north, Córdova is well provided with beach and diving resorts; those are the main tourist draws.

Get in[edit]
Get to Lapu-Lapu, and then go south, and you should come to Cordova. Also, a narrow water channel separates Córdova from Mactan Island itself, even though Cordova is considered to be part of Mactan Island.
The Cebu-Cordova Link Espressway now links Córdova directly to Cebu City, but this is a toll road.
Jeepney routes are MI-03A from Lapu-Lapu City Public Market and MI-03B from Mactan Export Processing Zone (MEPZ).

Get around[edit]
Córdova only has a couple major routes, but getting around it should be fairly easy because the town is not large.
