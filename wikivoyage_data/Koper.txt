Koper (Italian: Capodistria) is Slovenia's only commercial port and one of its oldest towns with a very rich history.

Understand[edit]
Koper, the oldest town in Slovenia, developed on a rocky island with the Roman name Capris. Out of the three Slovenian coast cities (Koper, Izola, Piran), Koper has experienced the most numerous layout modifications. The reasons for that also need to be sought in the changes of various reigns and states, all of which marked the city with their specific traits and names. Koper was called Capris in Roman times, in the times of the pope Gregory I (599) Insula Capraria (“goat island”), Iustinopolis under the Byzantine Empire (between mid 6th and 8th centuries) and Caput Histriae (‘head of Istria’) by the Aquileia Patriarchs. The Venetians rendered that name into the Italian form, Capodistria. The Slovenian equivalent of the name is Koper.
The longest reign over the city was that of the Venetian Republic (1279-1797), when Koper experienced economic (trade, salt production) and cultural prosperity (painting, music). The Venetian period is still echoed by the city architecture; despite numerous modern interventions, it has preserved its medieval character, with the city of Koper being a member of the European Association of Medieval Cities. In the Middle Ages, Koper was an island surrounded by walls and connected with the mainland with a wood bridge in the direction of Škocjan. It was protected by a mighty fortress – Lion Castle, and surrounded by vast saltpans. Koper’s importance began to diminish in the 18th century, when Trieste was proclaimed a free port, which ended with the downfall of the Venetian Republic.
In the period from the 19th century to the First World War (i.e. from the Napoleonic Empire 1806-1813 to the Hapsburg Monarchy 1813-1918), Koper experienced numerous changes in the economic and social development. This period was marked by the reduction of the saltpans, which were entirely abandoned in 1912, and the changing layout of the city, which began to lose its island character. In 1825, a second road connection with the mainland was constructed (Semedela Road) followed by the coastal road in the middle 19th century, a sea connection with Trieste-Poreč and the railway connection Trieste-Poreč in 1902.
Under the Italian Empire, Koper entirely lost its island character by means of the draining of the deserted saltpans.
The time after the Second World War brought further changes. Until the final determination of the border with Italy through the signing of the London Memorandum in 1954, when it became part of former Yugoslavia, Koper was part of Zone B administered by the Yugoslav national Army, first belonging to the Julian March and from September 1947 to the neutral state called the Free Trieste Territory (FTT). As part of Yugoslavia, Koper experienced profound changes in its national structure. This also brought about new architectural interventions both in the city centre and its surroundings, especially in terms of huge development with the construction of the port.
Today, Koper is both a commercial and tourist city, continuing to develop its offer in terms of seaside resorts, nautical tourism, sports and shopping. It has also become a University City.

By car[edit]
Koper has easy highway connections from Ljubljana and Trieste.
There are no regular border immigration checks between Slovenia, Croatia and Italy,  Croatia became a member of the Schengen agreement in January 2023. 
Beware of the need for a Vinjeta (highway toll sticker) before driving on Slovenian highways! There is a fuel station immediately at the border where you can purchase one. Controllers are often stationed exactly after that station to issue heavy fines to violators.
Parking rules are enforced in the city, but some public lots are free on weekends and after-hours. If you get a traffic fine and do not have a European bank account to pay it, any Slovenian post office can make the money transfer for you for a very small fee.

By rideshare[edit]
A locally-created website and app named Prevoz[dead link] is the most widely used ride sharing site within Slovenia. The typical fare to Ljubljana is €5 from the 45.54547313.7267386 Tržnica / Oly Burger bus stop in the center. This is often the fastest and least expensive way to travel to Koper from other parts of Slovenia.

By bus[edit]
From Trieste[edit]
The direct bus services to Trieste operate between 3 and 6 times a day, costing about €3-5 depending on the bus company. As of November 2019, the fixed price on Arriva is €3.30. The drivers can sell tickets on the bus but sometimes prefer if you pre-purchase it in the station. The journey takes between 20 and 40 minutes.
The very cheapest way to get between Koper and Trieste is to take an inter-urban bus to Škofije at the Slovene border (€0.80), walk ten minutes on a path under the highway to Bricocenter in Muggia, and take Trieste city bus no. 20[dead link] to the centre (€1.30). Use of Google Maps is recommended to follow your drive for the first time, and the Slovene buses are infrequent. Trieste city buses do not sell tickets on the bus, but they can be purchased with the nationwide Italian "MyCicero[dead link]" app (Android/Apple), or at locations in Trieste. Make sure your ticket is validated/stamped after boarding.

There are also hourly buses from Ljubljana listed at the Ljubljana bus station with many stops on the way.

By train[edit]
The national railway company Slovenske železnice[dead link] operates 5-6 daily trains from Ljubljana (2 h) and Maribor (4½ h). 45.5393213.73814811 Koper railway station (Železniška postaja Koper) is close to the bus station and is about 1 km south the Muda Gate to the old city. There is no longer any direct train service to Trieste, but trains run a lazy route to Ljubljana a few times per day. See Slovenian Railways[dead link]. Sometimes, the train station sells discount tickets in person to cities as far away as Vienna and Munich at prices not available online (around €30).
See the warning under 'Taxi' about drivers overcharging at the bus/train station.

By Taxi[edit]
In general, Slovene taxis are less expensive than Italian taxis. They are permitted to pick you up (or drop you off) in Trieste if you order them (about €20-25). Cammeo has a nice English-language app which helps with language barriers. Pick-ups from Trieste might need to be requested over the phone.
Beware of taxis waiting at the bus/train station. The usual price within Koper is about €3, but the taxi drivers waiting at the station sometimes attempt to charge more than twice that even if you speak Slovene. If you have too much luggage to walk, call a local taxi to get a fair price.
