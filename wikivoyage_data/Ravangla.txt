Understand[edit]
Ravangla is a relatively new tourist spot in South Sikkim. It is a small picturesque town on the highway from Gangtok to Gyalshing at an elevation of 8,000 ft. Ravangla is one of the few places in Sikkim which offer undisturbed views of the Greater Himalayas (Mt. Kanchenjunga, Mt. Pandim, Mt. Sinialchu, Mt. Kabru). In April and May lots of flowers are in full blossom. The weather in Ravangla is very volatile, so always be prepared for rains.

Ravangla is situated about 65 km west of Gangtok and 52 km east of Pelling. It is directly accessible from Gangtok (2 hrs 15 mins), Siliguri (126 km - 4 hrs 30 mins), Darjeeling and Kalimpong. If you want to reach Ravangla by evening, make sure you book or hire a taxi by afternoon. Beyond afternoon, one can reach Ravangla by traveling to Namchi and from there another taxi to Ravangla.

Ravangla serves as basis for moderate treks to Menam (3,200 m) and Tendong (2,575 m).

Menam trek. The ascent to the Maenam is about 12 km long with a difference in altitude of about 1,000 m and takes about 3 to 4 hrs. Weather permitting it offers splendid views on the steep peak of Mount Narsing (5,825 m), Kanchenjunga, and other prominent peaks of Sikkim. It is not easy to find the path, therefore a local guide (₹1000-1500, group of 4 in 2015) is highly recommended. A small brick hut at the few minutes before the top can be used as accommodation. The hut can accommodate up to 5 people and can be managed for even 6 people. No availability of water at the top. There is a small Gompa (a small Buddhist temple) at the peak. The path winds through a forest of oak, chestnut, magnolia and rhododendron trees. There are few trees along the trek whose barks have unique property of glowing in the dark. The guide will get you one if you ask, but its effect is short lived (2 to 3 days) and not sure if it glows until you carry it back to your place. There are two types of paths along the trek, one which is made as a footpath for easy and gradual climb and another is a very rough short route which goes very steep crossing the footpath at many places. Only sufficiently fit people use the short route according to the guide. Flowers are in full blossom in April and May. The area is the natural habitat of the red panda, Himalayan black bear and many species of deer and is designated as a Wildlife Sanctuary.
Before starting the trek one must register his/her name in the forest barrack which is just near the entry point of the trek. If guides are not available to anyone, the person in the forest office will either help you find one or he himself will come as a guide. The forest entry fees is 25 rupees (2015) per day. The entry point to the trek is near the Buddha Park entry gate and any local will assist you to the forest office on asking for it.

Tendong trek starts with a 13 km drive to Damthang and 2 hrs 30 mins trek. Tendong peak (8.500 ft, 2,575 m) offers a spectacular view of the mountains of Sikkim and the distant plains of North Bengal.
