Eksjö is a town in the Småland province with 10,000 inhabitants. It is the seat of Eksjö Municipality, which has roughly 17,000 inhabitants. It is notable as one of the best preserved old wood-towns in Sweden.


Understand[edit]
Eksjö developed during the medieval era as a natural meeting place on the roads connecting the bishoprics Linköping, Växjö and Kalmar. The city was entirely destroyed in 1568 during the Nordic Seven Years war, but was later rebuilt some 500 meters from its original location. The new city stretched in a north-south direction with the northern half separated from the southern by the church, city square, and latter also the city hotel. A major disaster hit the city in 1856 when the southern half of the city was destroyed in a major fire. Another setback for Eksjö came in the 1860s, as it was decided that the major railway connecting Stockholm with southern Sweden and Malmö would not pass Eksjö but rather the town Nässjö some 16 kilometers west of Eksjö. Due to this Eksjö was not as heavily industrialized as other cities, and as all resources where devoted to rebuilding the southern half of the city there was no urban renewal of its northern half. As a consequence of this the northern half of central Eksjö (a.k.a. "Gamla Stan" or "Old town") is one of the best preserved traditional wooden towns in Sweden, with many houses from the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries. The southern half is dominated by neo-classicist stone buildings from the latter part of the 19th century.
Eksjö has been an important military city since the 15th century and is today the seat of Eksjö garrison. It is also the seat for Höglandssjukhuset ("The Highland Hospital").
Settlements include Eksjö, Mariannelund, Ingatorp, Hult, Hjältevad and Bruzaholm.
