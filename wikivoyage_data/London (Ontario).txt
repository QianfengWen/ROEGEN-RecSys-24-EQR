London is a major manufacturing centre for southwestern Ontario, founded in 1793. Nicknamed the "Forest City," London has an abundance of urban parks and woodlands. Early in its history it was considered as a potential site for the capital city of Upper Canada, but that title eventually went to York (later Toronto).  The city is roughly rectangular in shape, approximately 16 km (10 miles) from east to west, and 13 km (8 miles) from north to south.
Many cities, towns, counties, and rivers in this area of Southwestern Ontario take their names from their counterparts in England, and London is no exception. London features landmarks such as Picadilly Street, the Covent Garden Market and the Thames.
In the 1920s, London-born Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians hit the U.S. music scene and went on to achieve legendary fame. London's Wonderland Gardens later became a big-band hot-spot in 1935 - being situated on the Thames river where Guy Lombardo developed his love for speedboat racing by racing his father's small motorized boat on the Thames River behind the Labatt Brewing Company.
With two major hospitals, London is a regional medical centre, treating patients from up to 200 km away. London also has the region's only university (University of Western Ontario) which has all the typical professional schools (business, law, medicine, engineering, education) as well as sciences and the arts. Since the city is also home to Fanshawe College, students comprise a significant percentage of London's population during the school year.

By car[edit]
London is fairly easy to navigate, as its streets are based on a grid system. Except for a short section of Highbury Avenue, the city lacks internal freeways. Roads have a speed limit of 50 km/h unless signed otherwise. Traffic can cause delays, especially around Downtown and the University.
Oxford Street, Dundas Street and Commissioners Road are major east-west arteries. Fanshawe Park Road runs east-west across the northern part of the city while Southdale and Exeter Roads go east-west through the southern portions.
The main north-south arterial roads are, going east to west: Wonderland Road, Wharncliffe Road, Richmond Street, Wellington Road, Adelaide Street, Highbury Avenue, Clarke Road, and Veterans Memorial Parkway.
Parking is usually easy to find and free or reasonably priced, however be aware that a city bylaw doesn't let you park on any public streets overnight in the fall and winter.
