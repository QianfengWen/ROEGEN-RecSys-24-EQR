Pinawa is a hamlet of about 1,300 residents (2016 census) in southeastern Manitoba, 110 kilometres north-east of Winnipeg.
It is one of the west-side entry points to Whiteshell Provincial Park.


Understand[edit]
The community of Pinawa was established in 1901 to support the operation of an early hydroelectric generating station but was abandoned in 1951 when the site was shut down.
Pinawa was re-established about 10 km from the original settlement in 1963 when Atomic Energy of Canada Limited built the Whiteshell Laboratories nuclear research facility in the area. Pinawa was developed as a planned community which preserved many of the natural features of the site and designated all riverfront property as public reserve.

Get in[edit]
Pinawa is about 1½ hour's drive east on Winnipeg on Highway 59 and 44, then on Provincial Road 211.
