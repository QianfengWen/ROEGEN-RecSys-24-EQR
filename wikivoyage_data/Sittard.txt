Sittard is a city in the region South Limburg, in the Dutch province of Limburg.


Understand[edit]
Sittard is a city in the Dutch province of Limburg, which is the southernmost province of the Netherlands. On the east Sittard borders on Germany (municipality Selfkant, in North Rhine-Westphalia). It has some 48,400 inhabitants (including those of neighbouring villages Munstergeleen, Limbricht, Einighausen and Guttecoven). Sittard is part of the municipality of Sittard-Geleen.
Sittard has a small historic city centre with numerous architectural monuments, including several old churches (St Peter's, St Michael's, Basilica of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart) and a few half-timbered houses. The city has retained part of its city wall. On the south-eastern side of the city centre, the St Rosa chapel crowns the Kollenberg hill. Museum "Het Domein" is situated in a converted nineteenth century school building in the city centre. It focuses on contemporary art, urban history and archeology.

By train[edit]
The main train station is a 10-minute walk from the city center. Sittard is served by intercity and regional train services. The intercity trains coming from the north (thus from the directions of Amsterdam, Utrecht, 's Hertogenbosch, Eindhoven, Weert, Roermond) are split in two here, with one part continuing to Heerlen and another to Maastricht. In the opposite direction, the two trains are combined here to continue north as one.
Regional trains pass through from the directions of Echt, Roermond, Heerlen and Maastricht.
Trivia: According to NS (Dutch Railways), the Sittard train station has the longest train platforms in the Netherlands, as of 2021.

By bus[edit]
The bus terminal is next to the train station. The bus operator in Sittard and surrounding cities is Veolia, with lines to most of the smaller town in the region but also to larger destinations like Heerlen, Maastricht, Roermond, and Geleen.

By car[edit]
Get around[edit]
On foot and bike[edit]
As nearly all stores, restaurants and bars are located in the center, walking is a good way to get around Sittard. From the main railway station, it's a 10-minute walk through the Steenweg to reach the Market and most of the sights. The streets in the center are pretty much free of cars and bicycles.
Bike rentals:

 Rijwielshop Station Sittard, Stationsplein 2-A (Railway station Sittard). M-F 07:00-19:00, Sa 08:00-19:00, Su closed. €2.85 per day. 
By bus[edit]
Arriva offers bus connections from Sittards railway station to the surroundings. You can plan your trip door-to-door using 9292.nl, though results vary. Busses run twice an hour to most locations. Bus tickets cost € 4.10 and can only be purchased using a debit or credit card. To save money, it is recommended to travel using an OV-chipkaart instead, or to check in with your debit or credit card using the OVpay system.

By car or taxi[edit]
If you have a car, try parking outside the city center as it is much cheaper or even free. Renting a car is only useful if you want to head to the outskirts of town or even other cities or villages. The city center is small enough to do on foot, but also mostly car free. Taxis are a fairly expensive way to get around, but you can find them at the trainstation.
