Narrabri is a town (population 5,903 in 2016) in the New England region of New South Wales, Australia at the intersection of the Newell and Kamilaroi Highways.


Understand[edit]
Narrabri Gaol and Heritage Museum
The indigenous Kamilaroi people are the original inhabitants of the district. The European explorers John Oxley and Allan Cunningham traversed the district in the early 19th century, but the first European settler was the escaped convict George (The Butcher) Clarke, whose tale of a river leading to an inland sea prompted the explorer Major Thomas Mitchell to throughly explore the area in order to open it up for settlement. The first farm, Nurrabry Run, was established in 1834 and from which Narrabri derived its name, with the town site surveyed in 1848. Narrabri is a major cotton farming centre, with wheat, beef, and lamb farms as well. Mount Kaputar National Park is a popular attraction, and the nearby radio telescopes at the Paul Wild Observatory bring many visitors too.
Narrabri is the main centre of the Narrabri Shire Local Government Area.
