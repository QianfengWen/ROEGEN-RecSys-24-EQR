Dortmund (Low German: Düörpm; Latin: Tremonia) is a city with a population of about 600,000 in the North Rhine-Westphalia region of Germany. It is in the middle part of the state and is considered to be the administrative, commercial and cultural centre of the Ruhr area, which has some 5.21 million inhabitants (2017). The city is famous for its beer, football, events and shopping.


Understand[edit]
The city pops up first when people think of the Ruhr valley, and that's no surprise. It is the largest Ruhr city, the third largest by population after Cologne and Düsseldorf, and the geographical center of the North Rhine-Westphalia state. Worldwide, the city is foremost known for beer (pale export/lager beer called Dortmunder) and the famous sports club Ballspielverein Borussia 09, Borussia Dortmund or BVB for short. But there is another gentler side to this former industrial powerhouse. Modern Dortmund is vibrant and cultural, well-known for excellent shopping, a range of fascinating museums and theaters, one of Germany's most surprising startup scenes (not quite on the same level as Berlin, but ahead of the rest of the Rhine-Ruhr area and even Munich), and with half the city given over to parks and gardens, enough green areas to soothe the senses.
And yes, the city is no classy beauty, and rough at first glance, though pretty honest, adorable and cordial at the second.

History[edit]
Alter Markt
Founded around the year 882, Dortmund became an Imperial Free City. Throughout the 13th and 14th centuries, it was the "chief city" of the Rhine, Westphalia, and of the Netherlandish Circle of the Hanseatic League. After the Thirty Years' War, the city was destroyed, and decreased in significance until the onset of industrialization; then, it became one of Germany's most important coal, steel and beer centres. Dortmund acquired the nickname Stahlstadt (Steel City) in the 19th century, when it became the world center of steel production. Consequently, the city was one of the most heavily bombed cities in Germany during World War II. The devastating bombing raids of 12 March 1945, with more than 1,110 aircraft, destroyed 98% of buildings in the inner city center, a record to a single target in this war. Much of what you see in the city center was built in the last 50 years. The region has adapted since the collapse of its steel and coal industries, and shifted to high technology, biomedical technology, micro systems technology and also services.
In November 2017, according to a study by data of German National Statistics Office, the National Employment Agency, Mercer, Handelsblatt, Numbeo and Immowelt, Dortmund was ranked as the seventh most livable city in Germany for expats. In September 2017, The New York Times praised the city of Dortmund, which has adapted since the collapse of its century long steel and coal industries and shifted to high technology biomedical technology, micro systems technology and services, as the hidden star of structural change with a good quality of life for employers. According to the 2017 Global Least & Most Stressful Cities Ranking, Dortmund is one of the least stressful cities in the world. It's ranked 27th out of 150 between Copenhagen and Vancouver and highly ranked in the category Traffic & Public Transport, Gender equality and debt per capital.

When to visit[edit]
The best times for Dortmund are late spring to early autumn, its peak season for tourism. The summers tend to be sunny and warm around 25°C (77°F), during November and December 5°C.

By plane[edit]
51.5183337.6122221 Dortmund airport (DTM  IATA). Home of several low-cost airlines (easyJet, Eurowings, Ryanair, Wizzair), it serves mainly national and European destinations, with a noticeably heavy focus on Eastern Europe. Unusual for a German airport, there is no direct train or tram connection to the airport, but there are shuttle buses between the airport and Dortmund Central Station or Holzwickede Station.   (updated Nov 2018)
From and to Central Station: A non-stop shuttle-bus can be found opposite the main railway station Dortmund Hauptbahnhof (also signed as: Dortmund Hbf or DO Hbf). The journey lasts 25 - 30 min and costs €6.5 per passenger (6-14 children €2; younger children free). This bus service is not covered by a travelcard.
Via Aplerbeck The municipal 490 bus travels between the Airport and Aplerbeck, where passengers can change to the Stadtbahn U47 (tram) which will go to the Hbf via the two major Stadtbahn hubs, Stadtgarten and Kampstraße. The journey is approximately 45 min. Tickets cost €3.30 for a single ride, VRR tickets and the Deutschlandticket accepted. This service runs more frequently than the shuttle bus at every 20 minutes M-F, every 30 minutes on weekends and at late hours, no service during midnight-early morning.
From Holzwickede Station: A bus service (€3/passenger), runs regularly about every 15 minutes between 05:00 and 23:00. The trip to the terminal building takes approx. 5 minutes. You can walk it in 20 minutes if you are unencumbered by luggage.
By taxi: The trip costs around €25 to the City Centre. Drivers operate on the meter; if they don't, get a different taxi!
Duesseldorf Airport (DUS IATA) can also be used and may be a better option, especially for passengers who prefer major carriers. It is a 45-60 minute drive away from Dortmund. Direct train services also run between Dortmund Central Station and Düsseldorf Airport operated by Deutsche Bahn. Düsseldorf Airport serves a variety of long haul destinations in North America and Asia, as well as short haul services throughout Europe.

Central station (Hauptbahnhof)
51.51757.4588892 Dortmund central station (Dortmund Hauptbahnhof), Königswall 15, 44137. This is a major stop for Deutsche Bahn (German state railway) and has over 600 departing trains on a typical weekday. There are different types of trains such as S-Bahn, Regionalbahn, and Regionalexpress. The station is a terminus for some Thalys trains (usually 3 per day). Also Flixtrain serves this train station.   (updated Nov 2018)
51.48847.50053 Dortmund Hörde station (Bahnhof DO-Hörde), Hörder Bahnhofstraße (Stadtbahn U41, 10 mins to Dortmund city centre). This is the second biggest stop in Dortmund and it is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 4 station. Trains run hourly, except for the RB 59 (Hellweg-Bahn) service, which runs every 30 minutes on weekdays. There are additional services on weekdays during the peak hour   
All tickets will have to be validated before departure. For the trains like Regionalbahn or Regionalexpress there's an orange machine before you go up the stairs to the platform, where you have to stamp your ticket. The Stadtbahn Dortmund (DSW21) tickets for the local Stadtbahn (light rail) and Straßenbahn (tram) service must be validated on the actual trains although you will find stamp boxes at the entrance to the platform as well.
Failure to stamp the ticket in the appropriate machines ("entwerten") will result in either a €40 on-the-spot fine or being brought to a police station by the security where the police will request your I.D. such as your passport for later prosecution. Not being German, not understanding the language or complicated system, or the fact that you have purchased a ticket will not be accepted as excuses: if it is not stamped, it is not valid, and travelling with a non-stamped ticket is considered an offence.

Getting around in Dortmund is easy. The centre of Dortmund is not that big for a city of half a million. It is entirely feasible to walk between both ends of the centre.

By public transport[edit]
Dortmund is part of the VRR (Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr), a cooperation of the regional transportation companies, giving easy access to public transportation in the whole Ruhr District in S-Bahn, regional trains, trams, subways and buses.
Dortmund's central station (Dortmund Hauptbahnhof or DO Hbf) is a junction of the national railroad system with local, regional and long-distance services all throughout Northrhine-Westphalia, Germany and abroad. 
The Stadtbahn is a local hybrid system being partially metro, partially tram, running underground in the city centre. This system has three major trunk tunnels which cross the city centre, branching off to different suburbs and the neighbouring city of Lünen. The three trunk tunnels intersect at three stations, forming a downward pointed triangle between Kampstraße, Reinoldikirche and Stadtgarten stations. 
Significant portions of this network run on grade-separated tracks in tunnels or next to major roads, ensuring fast trips even on cross-city rides, running at 10-minute frequency during peak times, less frequent off-peak and on Sundays.

U41 Lünen-Brambauer - Fredenbaum - Leopoldstr. - Hauptbahnhof - Kampstr. - Stadtgarten - Stadthaus - Märkische Str. - Hörde - Clarenberg
U42 Grevel - Schulte-Rödding - Brunnenstr. - Reinoldikirche - Stadtgarten - Möllerbrücke - Th.-Fliedner-Heim - Barop - Hombruch

U49 Hafen - Leopoldstr. - Hauptbahnhof - Kampstraße - Stadtgarten - Stadthaus - Westfalenpark - Rombergpark - Hacheney
During matches at the stadium, additional trains will run from the matchday-only Stadion stop. 
At major stops, the Stadtbahn offers easy transfer to local bus lines, that cover suburbs more broadly, running down residential streets and extending to towns around Dortmund. Service hours are generally 05:00 - 23:00, with some lines running earlier or later. Frequencies on bus lines can range from every 10 minutes to hourly, most running at least half-hourly. The system is laid out so you're in most cases only one transfer away from the city centre.
There is night bus (NachtExpress) service on weekends, running from shortly after midnight to the early morning hours on Saturday and Sunday mornings. Night buses have timed transfers at Reinoldikirche stop in the city centre. 
Dortmund has an automatic monorail system, the H-Bahn (meaning hanging railway) at the University. It connects the campus with Dortmund-Universität train station and the suburb of Eichlinghofen, where transfer to buses is available. Campus Nord and Technologiezentrum stations are only served Monday - Friday, while Universität, Campus Süd and Eichlinghofen are served Monday - Saturday, no service on Sunday and public holidays.  
Tickets can be bought from machines at Stadtbahn stops, on apps or at some selected kiosks, and from bus drivers. You may transfer freely between buses, Stadtbahn, regional trains etc., as long as you are within the permitted travel zone (Preisstufe) and the time limit. Exception to this is the Kurzstrecke ticket for up to 3 stops on Stadtbahn or local buses. Tickets may need to be stamped. There are no ticket gates, but getting caught by inspector teams will land you a €60.00 fine.

By bicycle[edit]
Look for one of the orange bikeshare stations
Dortmund has, like Cologne, Berlin and Frankfurt, a Call A Bike - System called Metropolradruhr. After you register for an account on-line, it will charge your bank card a per minute fee. You can pick up or drop off one of the silver-red bikes anywhere in the city. It is also possible to rent a bike at many share stations, placed at transport hubs and educational or recreational sites; bike is perhaps the best way to go around the city.
The bike path network is lackluster at best, and often along major streets, so perhaps don't jump ahead to grab a bike if you're not a regular cyclist.

51.51377.4661 Alter Markt. Dortmund’s marketplace for almost 900 years may have a modern aspect today, but it is still the sociable centre of the city. Up to the Second World War the town hall for the Free and Hanseatic City was located on Alter Markt. In warm weather outdoor bar and cafe seating fills the plaza and turn the square into a giant beer garden, if Borussia Dortmund plays the Alter Markt completely black and yellow. There’s a reminder of the square’s trading history at the Bläserbrunnen fountain: the horn-player stature sculpted in 1901, and the pool underneath used to be a drinking fountain for livestock. 
51.51077.46692 Altes Stadthaus (Old Civic Hall). The Old Civic Hall, or Altes Stadthaus, a fine Neo-Renaissance structure built in 1899. A notable feature of the building’s façade is the large eagle representing the city of Dortmund. Another nearby old building worth seeing is Berswordt Hall, the Town Hall. 
51.5157.453623 Dortmunder U, ☏ +49 231 5024723. The same way one associates the city Paris with the Eiffel Tower, London with the Big Ben or Cologne with the Dom, the city of Dortmund is associated with the U-Tower. This high-rise former brewery building has been a Dortmund landmark since 1927. It housed the Dortmunder Union Brauerei, which for a short time was the most productive brewery in West Germany. That trademark “U” on the roof was added in 1968 and stands nine metres tall. In 2010, to coincide with the Ruhr becoming European Capital of Culture, the Dortmunder U was turned into a centre of culture and creativity, hosting the Ostwall Museum, exhibition rooms, a restaurant, an art association and a campus for the Dortmund University of Applied Sciences. Throughout the day the grid of panels under the “U” displays the “flying pictures” installation by the cinematic artist Adolf Winkelmann.   (updated Jun 2022)
51.42067.48884 Hohensyburg and Casino, Hohensyburgstraße 200, 44265, ☏ +49 231 77400. A popular destination in the south of Dortmund is the Ruins of the Syburg (year 1100) Vincke-Tower.

Next to the Ruins within the woods is the modern, glass-fronted casino hotel with live music, bars & restaurants. Jackets required for men! 
51.54127.41345 Kokerei Hansa, Emscherallee 11, 44369, ☏ +49 231 9311220. An awesome industrial monument in Huckarde district, this is a noteworthy stop on the Ruhr’s Industrial Heritage Trail. Guided tours and audio tours are given at this hulking facility that would receive anthracite from local collieries and convert it into coke or coke-oven gas.The construction was begun in the late 1920s and most of it is still standing after being shut down in 1992. Bring a camera, as there are loads of opportunities for dramatic photos, not least in the compressor room where the epic steam-powered gas piston compressors look like they’ve only just been turned off for the day. 
51.51447.4686 Marienkirche, on the Hellweg, opposite the Reinoldikirche. Tu W F 10:00-12:00 and 14:00-16:00, Th 10:00-12:00 and 14:00-18:00, Sa 10:00 -13:00. A free public guided tour is offered every Thursday at 16:30. At the eastern end of Westenhellweg, this is the oldest standing church in Dortmund’s Innenstadt. The Marienkirche is a blend of Romanesque and Gothic architecture. Its earliest sections were built in the 1100s while the later Gothic elements are from the 14th century. Sadly the Marienkirche was totally destroyed in the Second World War, but not before its medieval art had been removed for safe-keeping: The middle panel of the Beswordtaltar from 1380 has a Gothic painting evoking the Swoon of Mary. The Marienaltar meanwhile was composed by the Dortmund painter Conrad von Soest in 1420, and even though it was cut down in 1720 to fit a new Baroque reredos is still a masterwork of International Gothic art.   (updated May 2020)
 Ostwall Museum. Dortmund’s modern and contemporary art museum was founded in 1948 and moved to the Dortmunder U in 2010. When the museum first opened it displayed the Expressionist and New Objectivity works that the Nazis had deemed “degenerate art”, and the museum swelled with the arrival of the Gröppel Collection in 1957. Expressionism is still the soul of the permanent exhibition and there are pieces by artists from both Die Brücke and Der Blaue Reiter, like Emil Nolde, Kandinsky, Kirchner, Franz Marc and August Macke. From later movements there are works by Alberto Giacometti, Otto Dix and Paul Klee, while the graphics collection is fabulous and has pieces by Picasso, Chagall, Joan Miró and Salvador Dalí. 
51.51477.46777 Reinoldikirche. The Reinoldikirche the main Churche in the city of Dortmund. The Baroque spire of St Reinold’s Church rises over Willy-Brandt-Platz at the geographical centre of Dortmund. The building was raised in the 13th century after a fire claimed its predecessor, and it has a Romanesque nave and Gothic chancel. In the middle ages St Reinold’s Church was Dortmund’s spiritual centre, and was the main parish church up to the Reformation in the 16th century. There’s a lot to see inside, like a 14th-century statue of St Reinoldus, a stool on the south side of the choir from 1462 and the magnificent retable on the high altar carved by the Flanders-born Master of Hakendover 1420. Be sure to scale the tower’s stairs to the observation platform just beneath the clock. 
51.5517.36238 Schloss Bodelschwingh, Zur Hunnenboke, 44357, ☏ +49 231 28862060. Bodelschwingh, which was constructed upon oak posts, is one of the best-preserved buildings of this kind in the Ruhrgebiet and is, as a medieval moated castle from the 13th century, the biggest and most important moated castle in Dortmund. The castle, which includes a park and access yard, has been in family ownership for more than 700 years and is not open to the public. In the framework of the successful concept of "living and working" the utility buildings grouped around the courtyard have been converted into modern residential and commercial premises by the owner Baron zu Knyphausen. One can visit Schloss Bodelschwingh 'virtually' on the Internet. Interested visitors can thus take a look at the private grounds on photos and find out about the history of the castle. €10. 
51.4967.47959 TV Tower (Florian), Florianstraße 2, 44139, ☏ +49 231 5026100. The entrance to Dortmund’s television tower called Florian is on the north side of the Westfalenpark. It costs €2.50 to catch the lift to the observation deck, in addition to the €1.50 to enter the park. At just under 220 metres, the Florianturm is the 14th highest structure in Germany and for a brief time after it was completed in 1959 it was the tallest television tower. The elevator whizzes you to the two observation decks at 140 metres in no time at all. There’s no orientation board to point out the landmarks far below, but you can use a map on your phone as a substitute. Below the lower deck is a revolving restaurant if you’d like to pause over the view for a while longer. €2.50. 
51.51787.3346510 Zeche Zollern, Grubenweg 5, ☏ +49 231 6961111, zeche-zollern@lwl.org. Tu-Su and holidays 10:00-18:00, closed 24 Dec-2 Jan. If you never thought a colliery could be beautiful, wait until you see Zeche Zollern, which has stylish Art Nouveau elements from the turn of the 20th century. The Berlin Jugendstil architect Bruno Möhring designed the central machine building, fronted by a stained glass window with blue and green panels. The colliery closed down in 1969 and since 1981 has been the headquarters for the LWL Industrial Museum, which has eight locations around Wesphalia and Lippe. The exhibition at Zeche Zollern goes into the social and cultural history of the Ruhr industrial region, while the surrounding buildings have been restored and opened up: the machine hall’s 100-year-old conveyers, converters and compressors are an exhilarating relic of the steam age. Now it hosts a museum of industrial history, part of the Route der Industriekultur.

Viertel - City Quarters[edit]
Kreuzviertel
Unlike the Dortmund city centre, much of the inner districts (Viertel) around the old medieval centre escaped damage in the second world war and post war redevelopment. The best bars, pubs and restaurants are around the former ramparts of Dortmund.

Borsigplatz and Nordmarkt – Borussia Dortmund was founded nearby, north-east of the main railway station.Tram "Borisgplatz"
Hafenviertel – This district is one of the hippest places to live, with pubs, restaurants, art galleries with favorable lease for immigrants, students, and original, working-class Harbour inhabitants, U-Bahn "Schützenstraße" or "Hafen"
Kaiserviertel – around the Kaiserstreet. The Moltkestreet also known as the Cherry Blossom Street, became famous after photographers started posting pictures of blooming trees. Every spring, usually in April, the street in the Kaiserstraßen district is booming with pink blossoms and attracts tourists - it has preserved a unique, conservative, upscale feel. Stadtbahn "Ostentor"
Kreuzviertel – It is known for its many bars, clubs, pubs, and cafes, concentrated in the vicinity of Kreuzstraße and Vinkeplatz and create a day and nightlife atmosphere unique from the rest of the city.

51.48287.466423 Rombergpark, Am Rombergpark 49B. 08:00-16:00. At 65 hectares, Dortmund’s botanical gardens are among the largest in the world. They are named for the Romberg family whose estate was landscaped as an English park in 1822. The park came into the city’s hands in the 1920s, and thousands of perennials, flowering plants, medicinal herbs and trees have been planted. There are four greenhouses, for tropical vegetation, succulents, ferns and a mixture of camellias, lemon trees and jasmine. The older trees from the time of the Romberg estate are some of the tallest in North Rhine-Westphalia. The perennials are worth the trip alone, boxed by yew hedges and arranged according to colour. And the herb garden is just special, planted with more than 400 plant species, producing intoxicating scents in spring and summer. 
 Rosarium (Deutsches Rosarium VDR), Westfalenpark - An der Buschmühle 3, or -26116, ☏ +49 231-50-26100, fax: +49 231-5026111. This rosarium has a collection of more than 3000 rose species.

Under the constant gaze of the Florianturm on the south side of Dortmund, the Westfalenpark is a paid-entry 70-hectare green space with a multitude of little attractions to keep you engaged a whole afternoon. The horticultural areas deserve a detour: The Deutsches Rosarium has 3,000 different rose varieties, but also stages annual events like the electronic Juicy Beats festival in summer and the Lichterfest (Festival of Lights) in winter. Another summer attraction is the chair lift, which opened in 1959 and runs on Sundays between a “Mountain” and “Valley” station 500 m apart.

Westenhellweg around St. Reynolds
Krügerpassage
Dortmund is known nationwide as a shopping destination and the shopping center of the entire region, particularly popular with visitors from nearby areas like South Westphalia, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Belgium.
The Westenhellweg is a popular shopping destination, and with nearly 13,000 visitors per hour, it is Germany's most frequented shopping street. Together with the Ostenhellweg this old trading route runs through Dortmund city centre like a pulsing vein. When Dortmund was still a Hanseatic city, wagons rolled along here laden with salt and silk, because back in the Middle Ages, the only free imperial city in Westphalia was already regarded as an important centre of trade. Today some of the most reputed shops, department stores, and labels have their stores here. It is a pedestrian-only area and is bordered by the Reinoldikirche in the east and U-Tower in the west. The Westenhellweg has one of the highest rents for retail and office space in North Rhine-Westphalia. 85 percent of the shops are retail chains such as H&M, Saturn, Esprit, Zara or NewYorker. Thier-Galerie shopping center has 100 stores and chains like Armani, Adidas, Diesel and Hollister.
Three more shopping malls occupy the Thier-Galerie, Galeria Kaufhof and Karstadt as well as large fashion retail clothing stores from Peek & Cloppenburg and C&A. During the month before Christmas, the extended pedestrian-only zone is host to Dortmund Christmas Market, one of the largest and oldest Christmas markets in Germany.
In close proximity to the Dortmund concert hall lies the Brückstraßenviertel, a quarter hub especially for young people. The "Rue de Pommes Frites", which is what the Dortmund citizens have called the Brückstraße for a long time, has turned into a modern, young shopping promenade.
For a long time the Kampstraße had a shadowy existence as a parallel street to the Westenhellweg and Ostenhellweg, but it has now become a grand boulevard which contains specialist stores. Right next to the Kampstraße is the Kleppingstraße, an expensive shopping street with prestigious shops.
Kleppingstraße is a shopping street with a high concentration of gastronomy and expensive, prestigious shops like van Laack, Lindner Fashion, and Marc Cain. It is located between the Ostenhellweg and Neutor to Wallring.

Alcoholic drinks[edit]
Dortmund had more than 550 years of brewing tradition, some of the oldest breweries in Westphalia are founded around the Old Market in Dortmund. Dortmund is known for its pale lager beer called Dortmunder Export or Dortmunder, it became popular with industrial workers and was responsible for Dortmunder Union becoming Germany's largest brewery and Dortmund having the highest concentration of breweries in Germany. Popular and traditional beer brands are Dortmunder Actien Brauerei, Bergmann Bier, Kronen, Union, Brinkhoff's, Dortmunder Hansa, Hövels, Ritter, Thier and Stifts. Beer as a typical "proletarian" beverage has been connected with the industrial might of Dortmund's past and while the railway enabled sales to faraway lands (the name "Export" is ample testament to this) ultimately consolidation and the decline of heavy industry hit the breweries and today many brands have been abandoned or bought up by large conglomerates.
"Stösschen" is a beer in a small glass "Stösschen" 0.2 litres and can be drunk in about two draughts. The idea of a Stößchen came about in the 19th century when people would have to wait at the level crossing to cross the Nordstadt Railway Line that divided the city centre from the Nordstadt district. A local innkeeper saw the potential of serving quick drinks to people waiting, and a Dortmund tradition began. The Dortmunder Tropfen Schnaps is a type of liqueur that is flavored with herbs or spices and traditionally drunk neat as a digestif.

Stay safe[edit]
Dortmund is a relatively safe and welcoming city on the whole. As it is not a big tourist destination, it does not suffer from rampant pickpocket issues. Due to the decline of its prominent heavy industries, Dortmund and most of its neighboring suburbs (Castrop-Rauxel, Waltrop, Witten) are less well-off than other major cities in Germany, and socioeconomic disparities are some of the most glaring in the country. But this has surprisingly not translated to widespread crime. Some poorer neighborhoods in the northern quarters of the city may not look appealing, but being wary of your surroundings will suffice during the day. 
However, Dortmund Hauptbahnhof/Central station and its surrounding areas do suffer from lingering gang and drug-related activities. Be careful when in the vicinity of the station.
Football games in Dortmund are known to be some of the friendliest and safest in Europe. Some drunkards might show up but they will not harm you.
