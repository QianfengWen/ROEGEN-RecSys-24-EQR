Breda is a city of 180,000 people (2014) in the Dutch province of North Brabant. It has a long history as a military stronghold and army base. Important parts of the Dutch military still reside here. The military character is still at the heart of town, as the national Dutch Military Academy resides in the historic Castle of Breda, right in the centre of the old town.


Understand[edit]
The VVV has 2 offices in town. The primary one is across the train station, but there's a smaller office with more limited opening hours on the Grote Markt.

51.594214.779181 Tourist Information Office (VVV), Willemstraat 17-19, ☏ +31 900-522 24 44, info@vvvbreda.nl. M 13:00-17:00, Tu-F 10:00-17:00, Sa 10:00-14:30, Su closed.

In summer, outdoor café terraces on the Grote Markt quickly fill up.
Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Breda does not have a commercial airport, but thanks to the excellent public transportation system of the Netherlands, it can be reached easily from numerous airports in the Netherlands and even in Belgium.

Amsterdam Airport Schiphol  (AMS IATA) is the largest in the Netherlands and one of the most important global hubs, with extensive flight connection network across many continents. From the airport's train station (directly underneath the terminal), NS Dutch Railways[dead link] operates frequent Intercity Direct high-speed rail service every 30 minutes to Breda. The journey takes 1 hour and costs €21.40 one-way (including €2.40 supplement for using the Intercity Direct)
Rotterdam The Hague Airport (RTM IATA) is closer to Breda and served by a number of short-haul connections. From there, one needs to take RET's bus 33 to Rotterdam Centraal railway station and continue to Breda by the same Intercity Direct or regular Intercity to Breda. The total journey takes about an hour as well and costs €11 (Intercity Direct supplement does not apply, as it is only required for journeys including the stretch between Rotterdam and Schiphol).
Eindhoven Airport (EIN IATA) is the country's second-largest airport by number of passengers, served mostly by low-fare traffic from all over Europe. Again, one needs to take a bus from the airport to Eindhoven's railway station and change to an Intercity train to Breda, with a total journey time of slightly above 1 hour and costs €12.90.
Brussels Airport (BRU IATA) is another international and intercontinental hub close to Breda, with many flights to Africa in particular. It has an integrated train station as well, but trains from Brussels Airport no longer run directly to Breda - one has to change in Roosendaal. The total journey time is 1.5 hours and cost of both train tickets should not come above €20.
The Breda train station has been undergoing extensive redevelopment since 2012.
By train[edit]
Breda is a major railway hub. Two railway lines meet at the Breda station - the north-south line from Rotterdam to the Belgian border, with further extensions to Amsterdam, Schiphol Airport and The Hague, and the east-west line branching out in Breda through Tilburg towards Eindhoven and 's-Hertogenbosch. The latter connects to branches going to Utrecht, Arnhem, Nijmegen and Zwolle. A variety of trains, including frequently stopping Sprinters, traverse those lines connecting Breda not only to those major cities but also many smaller stations along the way, such as Delft. Pretty much all of the Netherlands can be reached from Breda by trains with one train change.
High-speed premium Intercity Direct trains connect Breda to Amsterdam, Schiphol and Rotterdam without intermediate stops. As of 2018, Breda again has direct international connections to Antwerp and Brussels, eliminating the need to change in Roosendaal along the way.
Train schedules and ticket prices can be found on the Nederlandse Spoorwegen website[dead link].

By car[edit]
From Amsterdam, Breda can be reached by taking the A2 to Utrecht and then the A27. Breda is less than a 90 minute drive from the three main ferry ports in Holland. From Rotterdam, Breda can be reached by taking the A16 to Breda, which will take about 30 to 40 minutes.

By boat[edit]
P&O Ferries operates overnight ferry service between Hull, England and Rotterdam, the nearest port to Breda. The journey takes 12 hours.

See[edit]
Grote Kerk seen from the Grote Markt
51.58914.77521 Grote Kerk (Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk). Built in the Brabantine Gothic style in the 15th and 16th centuries, the church dedicated to Our Lady (as Virgin Mary is most often referred to in the Netherlands) boasts a tower of almost 100 metres and one of the largest organs in the country. Inside you will find the Prinsenkapel, where members of the Orange-Nassau family had been buried until the city of Breda fell to the Spanish. 
Oude Stadhuis
51.588794.77632 Old city hall (Oude Stadhuis). Compared to the large church, the city hall standing at its back in a wall of buildings lining up the elongated Grote Markt is inassuming at best. Apart from being a neat example of Dutch 18th-century architecture, quite ascetic compared to the raging rococo found in many other countries at that time. The building is now a historic monument and home to several works of art as well as tourist information, but the actual municipal facilities have been moved to a modern building on Claudius Prinsenlaan.  
Castle of Breda
51.59144.774563 Castle of Breda. The castle originates in the 14th century and was substantially renewed in Renaissance style around 1540. Unfortunately, the castle is not available for visitors as it is home to the Military Academy since 1826, but of course it can still be admired from the outside. 
The Begijnhof is a peaceful place, much like it was 100 years ago.
51.590144.778634 Begijnhof, Entrance is at the Catharinastraat. Daily 09:00-18:00. Even though it lies right in the middle of the bustling city centre, much of the historic peace and tranquillity remains in this former Béguinage. Although no beguines remain, the small houses around the charming courtyard are still inhabited by single ladies. There's a herb garden and a small museum at nr. 29, which is a side branch of the much larger Breda's Museum. €1 for the museum. 
Interior of the Cathedral of Breda
51.587464.777425 Sint-Antoniuskathedraal (Cathedral of Saint Anthony). Nestled in a side street (incidentally named after Saint John), the cathedral church of the long-standing diocese of Breda is much less imposing than the Grote Kerk, but quite unique in that it is a 19th-century creation built in neoclassical style, both inside and out, which is a relative rarity as far as cathedrals go, especially in the Netherlands. (updated Jun 2016)
Koepelgevangenis seen from the Nassausingel
51.59044.78726 Koepelgevangenis, Nassausingel 26. A panopticon-style prison, whose name refers to the cupola topping the round building with prison cells stacked in rounds on the outside walls around a large covered courtyard. It is this prison that held the "Breda four" – the only German prisoners of war who served their sentences after the Second World War in the Netherlands for war crimes committed. The prison building complex is no longer in use and a national monument, but generally is not open for sightseeing. (updated Jun 2016)
