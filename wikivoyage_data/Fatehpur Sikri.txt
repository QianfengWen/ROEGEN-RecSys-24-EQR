Literally meaning the City of Victory, Fatehpur Sikri was founded by Mughal Emperor Akbar in 1571 and served as the capital from its founding to 1585.  Emperor Akbar established the city to honour the local Sufi saint Salim Chishti who predicted the birth of his heir, Jahangir. Its name derived from the village of Sikri, which occupied the land prior to the construction of the city. The city was renamed Fatehpur Sikri to commemorate the successful Gujarat campaign by Emperor Akbar in 1573. It was abandoned in 1585 due to failure of the water supply. Today, there continues to be a town at the foothills of the historic site.
Often lumped together with Agra on tourist tours and trails, Fatehpur Sikri is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in its own right. It includes one of the largest mosques in India, the Jama Masjid. The complex is made from red sandstone and is of Mughal architecture reflecting both Islamic and Hindu styles. Full of well preserved palaces and courtyards, it is a must see for anyone visiting Agra.
