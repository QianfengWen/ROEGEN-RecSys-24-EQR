Calistoga is at the north end of the Napa Valley in the Bay Area region of California. Calistoga was founded as a hot springs resort in the 1860s by Sam Brannan, California's first millionaire, and has long been a destination for its natural hot springs and mineral water and their supposed health benefits. Its position at the north end of the Napa Valley also makes it a gateway to Sonoma County wine country. Calistoga is a visitor's destination that celebrates being different - franchise fast food is against the law (really!) and healthy hedonists are celebrated.  Go wine tasting, have a fabulous dinner, then take a bike ride and have a mud bath before you leave.


Understand[edit]
At least since the 1700s, Calistoga's distinguishing characteristic has been its hot springs, which were used by the native Wappo people for medicinal purposes.  After the time of Spanish missions and Mexican ranchos, Samuel Brannan bought 2000 acres, founding Calistoga and starting the Indian Springs resort.  The resort eventually went into the hands of Doctor John Wilkinson, the founder of the spa industry.
Due to the spa industry, the California wine boom of the 1970s, the ensuing tourism, and the proximity to San Francisco (which in turn has fueled more tourism), Calistoga, like the rest of the Napa Valley, has maintained very high property value. This has increased the cost of living and essentially the price of everything from coffee to gasoline.   The surprise win by Chateau Montelena Winery of Calistoga at a 1976 Chardonnay blind tasting in France instigated the California wine boom of the 1970s.

Get around[edit]
Calistoga is a very small town, with most of the shops and restaurants on two crossing streets, Lincoln Avenue and Washington Street.  Walking is the best way to explore the town.
Bicycles are another good option, especially for those wishing to visit the wineries and other attractions a little farther from the center of town.  Bicycles can be rented at the Calistoga Bike Shop, which also dispenses tips and route advice.  The Bike Shop can also arrange "Calistoga Cool Wine" tours, with arrangements for the shop to pick up and deliver any purchased wine, so the bicyclist is not weighted down.
A bike path connects the eastern end of Washington Street to Dunaweal Lane, providing easy, car-free access from the center of town to several wineries, including Sterling, Twomey, Clos Pegase, Paoletti and Cuvaison.

This park is centered on a water-powered grain mill built in the middle of the 19th century. The grist mill still works and is operated on the weekends; the tour is worth the extra charge of $5 a person. Because wooden mills can't comply with modern food safety standards, the corn, wheat, and rye flour that they mill for the demonstrations can't be sold, but small bags are available as souvenirs for a donation. There is a hiking trail to Bothe-Napa Valley State Park and its camping facilities. Picnic area and drinking water. Wheelchair-accessible unisex restrooms. Geocaching site.

However, the main reason to go to this park is to spend half the day hiking up the mountain (9 mi., 2000' elevation each way) to see the 360° panoramic view from the summit. This is not an easy trail, especially the last mile. Bring water, sunscreen (there is no shade after the first mile), a hat, good shoes, stout lungs, and warm clothes for the windy summit. During the summer, plan to start this hike before mid-morning. Bikes permitted on some trails. No dogs permitted anywhere. Geocaching site. No restrooms, no drinking water, and limited parking.
