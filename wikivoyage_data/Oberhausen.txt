By public transport[edit]
Oberhausen has a well-developed public transport network, operated by local company STOAG according to VRR tariffs. 
The backbone of the system is the Streetcar line 112 and especially the part of it between the central station and Sterkrade, which doubles as a bus rapid transit (BRT) line. Opened in 1996 on a former industrial railway, this transitway has frequent and fast services every few minutes. If you miss one, don't worry, you can most likely already see the next bus or tram approaching in the distance. Board any service from platform 1 at the central station tram stop to get to the centr.O shopping mall at 51.489336.873853 Neue Mitte station. Tickets should be bought before boarding at the transitway stops. Customer service offices are located at the central station, at Neue Mitte stop next to the shopping mall and at Oberhausen-Sterkrade station.
