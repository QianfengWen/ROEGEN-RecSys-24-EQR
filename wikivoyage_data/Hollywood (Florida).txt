Hollywoods paved "Broadwalk" along the ocean
Hollywood is a city in Florida, located between Fort Lauderdale and Miami. With a population of 153,000 people (2022), Hollywood is a relatively small city that retains an old, laid-back, Florida feel to it compared to the larger cities in the area.


Understand[edit]
Hollywood can be divided into four different areas. The first would be Hollywood Beach along the Atlantic Ocean, where you will find most of the action. A short ways inland is Art Deco downtown Hollywood, filled with restaurants, shops, a park, and California essence housing. From here on out there is not much to see as residual housing and small business occupies the area. When you finally get to the edge of town by the Florida Turnpike, you will find a few hotels, casinos and other attractions here along an Indian reservation owned by the Seminole Tribe of Florida who have lived in the area since the 18th century.

History[edit]
Hollywood was founded in 1925.

The summer is a rainy season with occasional tropical storms and hurricanes. The winter is drier and mostly sunny by comparison. Hollywood gets about 60 inches of rain annually.

Get around[edit]

Broward County is served by three major Interstates (I-75, I-95, I-595) and some U.S. Highways including U.S. Highway 1, US 27 and US 441. It is also served by Florida's Turnpike and State Highway 869, also known as the Sawgrass Expressway.

Stay safe[edit]
Hollywood is a relatively safe city, especially near tourist areas along the ocean. Still use common sense. Don't walk at night alone, be wary of strangers, and do not draw too much attention to yourself. Also the beach in the area is prone to rip currents and man-o-war (jellyfish). Usually you will see a flag hanging at a nearby lifeguard stand telling how safe the water is. If the flag is colored green or yellow it should be safe to go in. if the flag is purple, red, or any other color you should stay out of the water.  Only swim in sight of a lifeguard stand.
Remember if you are caught in a rip current don't try to fight it. Instead swim out diagonally with the current until you are safely out of the current's grasp.
As with the rest of the USA the emergency telephone number for fire, police and rescue emergencies is 911.
