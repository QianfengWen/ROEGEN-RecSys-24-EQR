Do[edit]
37.0446-121.8851 The Forest of Nisene Marks, Aptos Creek Road and Soquel Dr (4 mi. N of Aptos on Aptos Creek Road.), ☏ +1 831 763-7062. This state park is a beautiful, mossy area that used to be a logging site. It's great for hiking and mountain biking. Although most people don't know this, it is the site of the 1989 Loma Prieta quake epicenter. $6 parking fee.   
36.9722-121.9142 Seacliff State Beach, State Park Dr (Exit at State Park Drive from Hwy 1 in Aptos.), ☏ +1 831 685-6442. This beach can get crowded in the summer, but has some nice walks, a little visitors' center, and a striking centerpiece: the Palo Alto, a concrete ship with a strange history. It rots away in the water but is fascinating in a melancholy way. Read about it in the center if it's open when you're there (call ahead due to state budget cuts). Parking fee, unless you are creative and careful regarding street parking.
