Armagh is a city in County Armagh, Northern Ireland, with a population in 2011 of 14,700. It's regarded as the ecclesiastic capital of all Ireland by both Protestants and Roman Catholics. It's no longer a "county town" as there's no such unit of governance in Northern Ireland, but since 2015 it's formed part of the Armagh-Banbridge-Craigavon "super-district" covering the northern half of historic County Armagh.


Understand[edit]

Armagh was a religious and secular power centre even in pagan times. In 432 AD St Patrick literally capitalised on this tradition by building his first stone church here and declaring it to be the country's Christian capital. (Or at least, he did so in any history controlled by the Armagh church: earlier christianising missionaries elsewhere in Ireland were studiously ignored, so today they have local observances but don't get to stop the New York traffic with a big annual parade.) The site of that 5th century church is now Saint Patrick's Cathedral, the seat of the Church of Ireland (ie Protestant) Archbishop & Primate of All Ireland. Here as elsewhere, the Protestants ejected the Catholics from their churches, and forbade them to build anew. Only in the 19th century was that prohibition abolished, so on the neighbouring hilltop was built St Patrick's Roman Catholic Cathedral, the seat of the RC Archbishop & Primate of All Ireland.
The religious divide was exacerbated by the national divide: after the Irish partition Armagh found itself in Northern Ireland, but with a large population who were Catholic and supportive of the republican cause, and with a nearby porous border with the Republic. "The Troubles" of 1969-1998 were very bitter hereabouts, with 86 deaths, and the place became run-down as business and individuals took flight.
Armagh lost its city status in 1840 but this was restored in 1994 - it's ceremonial, and the place continues to feel like a medium-sized town. After "The Troubles" were calmed by the Good Friday Agreement, Belfast and Londonderry successfully relaunched themselves as lively destinations for travel and business, but Armagh hasn't yet done so. It's still worth visiting for itself and as a base for exploring the county.
