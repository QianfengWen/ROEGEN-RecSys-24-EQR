Lakeside  is a city in Ottawa County, Ohio.


Understand[edit]
Lakeside was founded in 1873 as a Methodist summer retreat on one square mile of land on the Marblehead Peninsula.  Lakeside is known as "The Chautauqua on Lake Erie."  Chautauqua is an American summertime institution during which visitors can participate in activities, such as musical concerts, artists, lectures, and family activities throughout the summer. Lakeside boasts a full professional orchestra, a well regarded amateur chorus, and a packed daily schedule of creative, educational, and religious activities. 
During the 11 week summer season (roughly Memorial Day to Labor Day) Lakeside is a gated community.  Visitors must buy a gate pass to get in; the pass entitles them to use all of Lakeside's amenities as well as participate in Lakeside's daily activities.  The Lakeside Association maintains municipal and community services, such as the roadways, pier, auditorium, parks, etc.  Private homeowners own individual houses in Lakeside and most of the businesses in the downtown are privately run.   
While the Lakeside community and activities are open to all, visitors are expected to adhere to a code of conduct.  Lakeside is a dry community; no alcohol is served in any Lakeside restaurants nor allowed to be consumed anywhere on Association property.  Smoking is likewise prohibited.
Lakeside events and classes are scheduled week by week.  Sign up for many art activities is on Sunday afternoon.

Get around[edit]
For most people, walking is the best way to get around Lakeside.  The community is rather compact, and most activities are in the "downtown" area.  Bicycles are another option.  For those who want to get around without the effort, golf carts are available for rent.  Some (mostly older residents) use personal scooters as well.  Only foot traffic is allowed in Lakeside's parks and walking paths.
Lakeside offers a shuttle service -- an extended golf cart operating on a fixed route every 15 minutes or so on a set route. 
Cars are not a useful way to get around lakeside.  Park your car on arrival and keep it parked.  Parking is available by the south entrance (for a fee), at the Danbury High School (just outside Lakeside's south gate, for free).  Some cottages have their own garages and parking, and parking lots are available at the hotels.
