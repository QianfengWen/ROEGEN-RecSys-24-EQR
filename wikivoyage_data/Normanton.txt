Normanton is a town in the Gulf Country in Queensland  It is the largest town in the region, and has a population of about 1,200 people (2016).
Normanton thrived as a port town in the late 1800s when the gold rush was on in Croydon. The Normanton-to-Croydon railway line, established at that time, today it runs the Gulflander tourist train.
Australia's largest saltwater crocodile, known as Krys the Savannah King, was shot at nearby Archer's Creek in 1957. A life-size replica of his body, over 8 metres long, can be seen in the council park.
Some 30 km to the south-west of Normanton is camp 119, Burke and Wills' most northerly camp. The wetlands between Normanton and Karumba are also excellent for birdwatching, particularly just after the 'wet season'.


Get in[edit]
Normanton is 484 km north of Mt Isa.
About 700 km from Cairns on the Savannah Way - Highway 1, or around 500 km from Mount Isa on the Barkly Highway.
The Gulflander runs from Croydon, but since Croydon is in the middle of nowhere, with no real means of getting there, that is unlikely to help you get in much.
