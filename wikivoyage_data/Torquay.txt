Torquay Town Hall
Torquay (pronounced "Tor-kee") is a town on the coast of the English Riviera and South Devon region of Devon. Since the 19th century, it has been a fashionable seaside resort in the English Riviera. The town sits on the shore of the English Channel, on the southern edge of Torbay, an east facing bay that is part of the larger Lyme Bay.


Understand[edit]
Torquay's advantages as a seaside resort and destination are obvious, with 9 sandy beaches and extremely high standards of water quality (holder of 3 European Blue Flags, more than any other English resort). Torbay enjoys a warm micro-climate that allows palm-like trees to grow readily, though these are not true palms but rather Cordyline australis - Cabbage Tree.
Torquay is infamous as the setting of Fawlty Towers, the hotel owned by Basil and Sybil Fawlty in the classic 1970s British television comedy. The TV show was inspired by the now closed Gleneagles Hotel which the cast stayed at while filming Monty Python's Flying Circus.
The coastal area of Torbay which includes Torquay, Paignton and Brixham, was given the nickname 'English Riviera' because of the large amount of sandy beaches and the relatively warm climate compared to the rest of the country. Officially known as Torbay, it is almost completely made up of tourist resorts and small fishing communities. It is in a natural east-facing harbour.
In 2011, it was home to 65,000 people.
Torquay is also known for being the place where explorer Percy Fawcett was born.

Visitor information[edit]

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Exeter (EXT IATA) is the closest airport, but seldom the most convenient as it's lost its flights to London. 

By road[edit]
Torquay is connected to the UK motorway network by the A380, which traces the outskirts of the town as Hellevoetsluis Way and Hamelin Way, leading to the A38 and then on to the M5 at Exeter. The A3022 branches from the A380, leading into Torquay as Riviera Way, to the seafront as Newton Road and then Avenue Road, and then on to Paignton as Torbay Road. The A379 runs past the harbour to the Babbacombe and St Marychurch areas of Torquay, and then north along the coast to Teignmouth.

By train[edit]
Torquay is on the scenic Riviera Line. Trains run every 30 min from Exmouth, looping round the estuary and taking 55 min from Exeter (3 stations) via Starcross, Dawlish, Teignmouth, Newton Abbot and Torre, and continuing from Torquay to Paignton. There's occasionally a through-service but usually you change at Exeter for Bristol, West Midlands, Manchester Piccadilly and London Paddington. 
50.4613-3.54311 Torquay railway station is on the coast near Torre Abbey. There's a staffed ticket office, machines and a coffee shop. Plusbus tickets are available.
50.4729-3.54632 Torre railway station is one mile north along the road to Newton Abbot. The frequent Exmouth-Exeter-Paignton trains stop here but not the long-distance services.

By bus[edit]
Torquay is the terminus of the Gold service which runs from Plymouth, Totnes, and Paignton, and terminates at the harbour. This can be a useful way to reach Torquay from the west since it means you do not need to change trains at Newton Abbot.

Get around[edit]
Two bus routes operated by Stagecoach Devon pass through Torquay — the 'Bayline' number 12 service between Newton Abbot and Brixham, and the X46 service between Exeter and Paignton — while other routes operate within the town.
