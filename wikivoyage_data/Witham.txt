Witham is in Essex, England.


Understand[edit]
St Nicholas Church
River Brain
Remains have been found dating habitation back to neolithic times. As the town lies on the main Roman London to Colchester road it is not surprising that Roman remains have been found; specifically a Roman temple and a pottery kiln. The parish was listed in the Doomsday Book (1086) and in 1148 the manor was given to the Knights Templar.
In the 1960s & 1970s the town expanded rapidly, building 3 major housing estates.
Today the town caters mainly for residents, the area being regarded by some as a "dormitory town" for London. Good rail links mean that many from the area commute to work in London.
