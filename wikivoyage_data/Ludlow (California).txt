Historic Route 66, signed directly on the roadway

Understand[edit]
With a population of 10 persons in 2000, Ludlow is a ghost town of two eras: first from the railroad, then from the Interstate highway system.
Today there are a few traveler-oriented services, like many rural Interstate stops-along-the-way – gas stations, restaurants and a motel.
For most tourists this is a waypoint along Interstate 40 or a turn onto historic Route 66. Route 66 branches off from I-40 onto (now) San Bernadino County Route 66, proceeds east through several ghost towns including Amboy, and after 70 mi (110 km) connects back up with Interstate 40 near Needles.

History[edit]
The settlement dates from the 1870s. The town was founded in 1882 as a water stop for the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. Ore was found in the nearby hills, leading to the town's boom. Several railway lines catered to the several mining industries of the immediate area and further afield, carrying bulk cargo to the long distance lines of the (then) Santa Fe Railway – gold and other ores in the nearby hills and further south, to borax from Death Valley and Beatty, Nevada from the north.
By the 1940s the mining and railway activity had ceased, and the town survived suppling the needs of travelers on the National Old Trails Road, later renamed and numbered to become the legendary Route 66.
Interstate 40, completed in 1973, didn't bypass Ludlow but paralleled Route 66 to the west. However, even with an exit for historic Route 66 most businesses and residents departed.
The original portion of Ludlow lies along the railroad, just south of the current stand of buildings. The BNSF railway carries cargo and Amtrak's Southwest Chief roll right on by.

Most travelers will arrive by car, either along Interstate 40 or along what was once Route 66 (now San Bernardino County Route 66, also known as National Old Trails Highway). Route 66 west-bound parallels I-40 to New Berrysprings; Route 66 east-bound bends south and away from I-40.
Gas stations are available on both sides of the I-40 exits.

See[edit]
The old railroad-era town is south of the existing buildings, along the railroad tracks. A few buildings are still partially standing.

Nearby[edit]
East, along Route 66 — For railroad enthusiasts, explore other ghost towns along the BNSF railway and Route 66, southeast towards Amboy. These towns provided services to area mining operations, or were water stops or sidings along the way. Now, even most of the foundations have disappeared.
Between Klondike and Siberia there is a steep grade where the railway line splits, with one route a steeper, more direct, and the second more gradual but snake-curved climb.

34.6675-116.00392 Klondike ghost town.

West, accessible along Route 66 — The Lavic Lake volcanic view is a 39 square miles (100 km2) lava plain with four cinder cone-type volcanos. The Pisgah Crater is the most accessible and most prominent in the field with a height of 330 ft (100 m) aboue the field.
Lava tubes can be dangerous, so take caution. Take water with you. And drink it! Black volcanic rock radiates heat during the afternoon, making temperatures unbearable. Hiking in open desert mid-day, the hottest time, is dangerous in summer. One quart (one liter) of water per person per hour (or more) may be needed for survival; as soon as you've used 40% of your potable water, turn back lest you run dry during the return trip.
