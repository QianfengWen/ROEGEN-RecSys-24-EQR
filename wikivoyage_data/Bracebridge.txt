Bracebridge is a town of 17,300 people (2021) in the Muskoka region of the province of Ontario.  Its most notable and first recognized characteristic is the modern, European-style downtown.  In the summer, the small town's population increases significantly providing recreation for tens of thousands of tourists and seasonal residents.


Understand[edit]
The municipal boundaries of Bracebridge encompass the smaller communities of Clear Lake, Falkenburg (a ghost town), Falkenburg Station, Fraserburg, Germania, Lakewood, Matthiasville, Monsell (a ghost town), Purbrook, Rocksborough, Springdale Park, Stoneleigh, Uffington and Vankoughnet.

History[edit]
Bracebridge is shaped by its proximity to Lake Muskoka to which it is connected by 6 miles of the Muskoka River. The abundant water power afforded by the great waterfall at the foot of the downtown powered the first factory. The arrival of the Grand Trunk Railway cemented the town's role as a transportation hub for the area.
Modern settlement of the town began in the 1860s, beginning at first with a few log huts. The Muskoka colonization road had been completed to the first falls on the north branch of the Muskoka River by 1862. Entrepreneurs began to take advantage of the area's water power. With the advent of steamship service on Lake Muskoka a few years later, Bracebridge prospered as the main distribution centre for the region.

By car[edit]
Car travel is the most popular way to reach Muskoka.  It is on the 45th parallel, approximately 190 km north of Toronto.  Take Highway 400 north through Barrie and continue north up Highway 11 in the direction of North Bay.  In the summer, Highway 400 and the two northern highways (Hwys 11 and 69) will always be packed heading north on a Friday and south on a Sunday.  Dual lanes in each direction have eased the traffic in the past few years, however on 'long weekends', travel to Muskoka is always busy and can take several hours from the Toronto area: Victoria Day (the Monday before May 25), Canada Day (July 1), Ontario Civic Holiday (first Monday in August), and Labour Day (first Monday in September).
Winter travel to the region can be tricky depending on the weather.  Bracebridge and the surrounding area do get several winter storms per year, and can be difficult to access if you are not used to winter driving.  Winters have become milder, and improved roads in the area in also help.  However, this can vary from year to year as it lies on the cusp of the strong snow-belt areas of the country.
