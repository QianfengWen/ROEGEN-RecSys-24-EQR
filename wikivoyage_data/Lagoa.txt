Lagoa is a municipality in the Algarve region of southern Portugal. Lagoa is one of the most important tourist areas of the Algarve. There are various factors which have contributed to its popularity, namely the variety of offerings to visitors (the beauty of its beaches, modern tourist accommodation, its golf courses and cultural heritage), and the friendliness of its citizens.


Understand[edit]

The city of Lagoa (luh-GOH-uh, /ɫɐ.ˈgo.ɐ/) is not very spectacular, since it is inland. However, the nearby beaches, caves and nature sights are worth a few stops along the way between Albufeira and Portimao.
