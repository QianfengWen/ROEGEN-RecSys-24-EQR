A lodge at Dinner Plain near the Cobungra Platter in falling snow
Dinner Plain is a village in the High Country of Victoria, Australia.


Understand[edit]
Dinner Plain, which is located above the snowline in winter, is one of the few alpine areas in Australia with freehold land. Very strict planning controls ensure a certain uniformity of look: the buildings are all wooden veneers with a green-grey paint job to match the surrounding snow gums. In winter, Dinner Plain is a dormitory village for the Mount Hotham ski resort. In summer it's a good base for walking, hiking and cycling in the alpine area.

Get in[edit]
Dinner Plain is accessible by on the Great Alpine Road from Harrietville (45 kilometers) via Mount Hotham (20 kilometers) or from Bairnsdale via Omeo (60 kilometers). If travelling through Mount Hotham, just tell the gate staff that you are driving right through to Dinner Plain and they will not charge you the entry fee. Fitting snow chains must be carried after Harrietville or Omeo between June 1 and October 10 each year and you can be required to fit them at various points on the highway.
There is a bus service from Mount Hotham in winter, leaving from the Transit Center and opposite the Big D ski lift. Bus travellers would catch the Melbourne-Bright-Harrietville service to Mount Hotham and change at the transit center, but the bus is usually used by people skiing at Hotham and staying at Dinner Plain.

Get around[edit]
See[edit]
Chamonix in Drybone Lane at #7(formerely 179) as the FIRST building of any description ever sold in this new town.  Bernie and Leonie Valentini purchased the home called "Wattle Circle" by the builders' architect, Peter Macintyre, before it was even built. It was pre-constructed in modular form in Kilsyth Melbourne, and thence transported by semi-trailers via primitive dirt road from Omeo to Dinner Plain. "Home Welcoming" parties were held for the first few years, with the sale of each home, whereupon the original new owners would give their purchase an official name, by them, the owners. This "pioneering" FIRST home was hence named "Chamonix" by the Valentinis. When complete, there was no infrastructure of any kind, and access to the new home was only possible for the first 2 years via walking across the mud & snow from the primitive car park near original front gate; some 300 metres away, dragging luggage, skiis and food on sheets of plastic. Four wheel drive vehicles driven by inexperienced drivers, were getting bogged in mud and snow more often than not. The Valentini's Datsun 200B had no hope. They purchased a Toyota Landcruiser 4WD very soon after.

Do[edit]
 Cobungra Platter. The Cobungra Platter ski slope is a short beginners' run, a good place for introductory lessons or a warm-up. A J-bar lift is provided, tickets for the lift and for lessons are available through many local shops.

Walks[edit]
Mountains as seen from the Room With a View walk
When there's not snow, the area has the following walks:

 Room With a View. The Room With a View walk starts across the highway from the tennis courts, about 200 metres towards the Alpine School. After about 500 metres, it descends fairly gently down into the valley, ending in a clear area with a view of Mount Hotham and surrounding peaks. It is 4 kilometres return. 
While Dinner Plain is far below the altitude at which altitude sickness is usually a problem, if you've come up from sea level allow for these walks to be a little more difficult than you'd expect.

Buy[edit]

The supermarket and most cafes and restaurants accept EFTPOS (Australian debit cards) or credit cards.

There is no petrol (gas), or other fuel, for vehicles available in Dinner Plain or at Mount Hotham. The closest fuel is available in Harrietville or Omeo, both of which require descending from the alpine area.
