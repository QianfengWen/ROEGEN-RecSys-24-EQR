Grosse Isle, an island of the Isle-aux-Grues archipelago in the Chaudière-Appalaches region of Quebec, is in the St. Lawrence River opposite the south shore communities of Berthier-sur-Mer and Montmagny.


Understand[edit]

The 21-island Isle-aux-Grues archipelago is uninhabited, with the exception of one tiny community (Saint-Antoine-de-l'Isle-aux-Grues) on Île-aux-Grues itself. The region (Montmagny Regional County Municipality) is known for bird-watching, goose-hunting and cheeses.
Grosse Isle (Grosse-Île, "big island") was notorious for its role as disembarkation point for "coffin ships" — the overcrowded, disease-ridden immigrant vessels in which the starving Irish fled the Great Potato Famine of the 1840s. The island had been established as an 1832 quarantine station for inbound sea traffic to Quebec City during an earlier cholera epidemic, but was clearly unprepared for and overwhelmed by the mass influx of potato famine refugees in 1847. Medical care was primitive and housing and sanitation clearly inadequate for the tens of thousands of arriving travellers.

Thousands died from typhoid fever at the quarantine station or at sea. An estimated five thousand Great Famine victims are buried on the island, the largest potato famine graveyard outside Ireland. Thousands more were buried at sea before their ships even reached the New World. Of 90,000 who fled Ireland for Canada, an estimated 16,000 succumbed to the typhus epidemic of 1847 at sea, at Grosse-Île or at a subsequent destination; among those who left Grosse-Île seemingly healthy, 6,000 are buried at Windmill Point (Montréal) and thousands more succumbed in distant communities like Kingston, Bytown and Toronto. Partridge Island, as quarantine station for Saint John, New Brunswick, was in a similar position with nearly 1,200 fatalities.
Grosse-Île is now uninhabited; the quarantine station, expanded with more adequate facilities for arriving ocean liners after Canada's confederation in 1867, closed in 1937 and is now a national historic site. Île-aux-Grues is inhabited as a tiny village (year-round population: 130); the closest school is in Montmagny and, once the seasonal ferry stops running, students must be transported by aircraft.
