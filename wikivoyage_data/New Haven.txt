Center Church on the Green
New Haven is a city in Connecticut that is best known as the home of Yale University.


Understand[edit]
With a population density of 6,000 people per km2, downtown New Haven has a particularly residential character. As a result, numerous shops, cafes and top-rated restaurants have proliferated.  Ethnic restaurants include Ethiopian, Vietnamese, Eritrean, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, French, Mexican, Thai, Indian and Malaysian cuisines, among many others. According to the Hartford Courant, New Haven has more pedestrian activity than any place between New York City and Boston, and also has a burgeoning nightlife scene.
The area is a center for bicycling and hiking, with nearby East Rock Park, West Rock State Park, and Sleeping Giant State Park.  Together, they provide many miles of hiking trails and summits with expansive views over hundreds of square miles. Bicyclists enjoy cruising along the beautiful shoreline, or along the Farmington Canal Trail, a former canal and railroad that has been converted for recreational use.

By car[edit]
New Haven sits at the junction of Interstates 91 and 95. Be careful to lock your doors, as the crime rate in New Haven has been known to elicit broken windows.  Do not leave your GPS unit or its accessories (such as mounting units, suction cups, or suction cup marks on the window) in plain sight.  Belongings are typically not taken in these incidents.

Eat[edit]
White clam apizza from Pepe's
New Haven has many famous pizza parlors and is often credited with having introduced pizza to the United States, although New Havenites themselves often contend that New Haven-style apizza (pronounced uh-BEETZ) is a separate food from pizza altogether. The pizza has a thin, bitter crust, offset by high quality ingredients, making for one of the world's best pizza experiences. The most famous pizza locations are Pepe's and Sally's, which are over 80 years old and usually have lines going around the block. Modern Apizza—a more recent arrival (1934), further from the city center—has nonetheless usurped these establishments as the local favorite. For a real New England New Haven experience, order the white clam bake pizza—the simple toppings of garlic, olive oil, and New England clams against the backdrop of the bitter, oven-scorched crust make for a delight to the senses.
While it is a bit sacrilegious to pass through New Haven without trying the pizza, the small city has an astonishing wealth of fine dining establishments—easily rivaling the dining scene of any of New York's outer boroughs. The blocks just south of Yale University along Chapel, Crown, and George Streets are home to the majority of the city's best restaurants. Often-cited top restaurants in town include the Union League Cafe, Ibiza, Heirloom, and Zinc, but there are fantastic options around every corner in this part of town to try.

The burger served in Louis' traditional style: steamed in an antique table-top cast-iron gas broiler, served between two pieces of white-bread toast, optionally with cheese, tomato, and onion. Condiments like ketchup, mayonnaise, and mustard are not used or available, which is a point of pride for management who are adamant that such extras detract from the experience.

Stay safe[edit]
As with New York City, New Haven's crime rate has gone down considerably since the early 1990s, and it is now considered to be a safe city, at least in the downtown area. Today, there is very little risk involved with traveling to New Haven's tourist attractions as streets bustle with crowds generated by hundreds of restaurants, cinemas, theaters, cafes and stores. Luxury apartments and million-dollar condominiums have proliferated, adding a large population base to formerly industrial or commercial zones. In such areas, the downtown area is generally safe at night, but like other cities, late night travel through certain city neighborhoods outside the downtown, without someone who knows the area, is not recommended.  When visiting, exercise the same precautions you would use in any large city.
It is not recommended to venture outside the Metro North stop at Union Station at night. Taxis wait near the doorway, and it would be wise to take advantage of them if you must arrive in New Haven during the evening. The surrounding area is poorly lit and has seen a variety of violent and non-violent crime.
