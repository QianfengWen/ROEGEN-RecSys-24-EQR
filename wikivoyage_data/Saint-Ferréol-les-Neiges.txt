Waterfall on Sainte-Anne River circa 1900 in Saint-Ferréol-les-Neiges
Mont Ferréol (summit at 762 m) straddles Saint-Ferréol-les-Neiges and the unorganized territory of Lac-Jacques-Cartier. This intermunicipal limit passes almost at the top of the mountain. The latter is overlooked by the summit of Mont Sainte-Anne (altitude: 809 m) located 7.1 km (4.4 mi) south of the summit of Mont Ferréol. This mountain is part of the Mont Sainte-Anne park.
The vast majority of Saint-Ferréol-les-Neiges residents live along Route 360, which runs along the north shore of the Sainte-Anne River and in the Saint-Nicolas sector.

History[edit]
In 1916, a run-of-river hydroelectric power station was erected on the Sainte-Anne River, thus giving impetus to the local economy and the quality of life of the inhabitants. The operations of this power station were suspended in 1984. This hydroelectric power station operated by Hydro-Québec was restored and put back into service in 1999 as part of the government's policy to revive small power stations. Today, it is at the heart of a vast interpretation centre, combined with a natural park.

The Sainte-Anne canyon is on the border of Saint-Joachim and Saint-Ferréol-les-Neiges. It started 1.2 billion years ago (Precambrian era) with the formation of the rock of the walls and the bottom of the canyon which are part of the Canadian Shield. It was during the melting of an ice cap 75,000 years ago that the current Quebec hydrographic network was formed (St. Lawrence River, Île d'Orléans, Îles de la Madeleine and the rivers known today) as well as the Canyon as we can see it today.This extraordinary natural site has been accessible to the general public since 1973, but Indigenous peoples used to frequent the site. The waterfall was painted by the famous artist Cornelius Kreighoff, and described by the American ecologist and philosopher H.D. Thoreau.Easy-to-access family footpaths allow you to enter the spectacular canyon carved out by the imposing 74 metres (243 ft) fall which constantly rumbles between the rocky walls of the gorges. Visitors cross 3 suspension bridges… including one 60 metres (200 ft) high! One of the largest giant's pot in Quebec (15 metres (49 ft) in diameter) is visible as well as several waterfalls when you are at the bottom of the Canyon.The exceptional beauty of the site has often been recognized, both in Quebec (recipient of 3 Grands Prix du tourisme) and in Canada (national winner Attractions Canada). When John Travolta came to shoot his film Battlefield Earth in Montreal, several scenes were shot in Charlevoix as well as at Canyon Sainte-Anne."Roc-ambolesque" family games allow young people and their parents to have fun by decoding riddles and legends in a section of the park different from that which allows the visit of the site.For adventurers and thrill-seekers, it is possible to do vias ferrata, abseiling and zip-lining in the gorges of the Canyon. In fact, the via des marmites was the first via installed in Quebec. The concept is imported from Europe by well-known Quebec adventurer François-Guy Thivièrge.For people who have difficulty walking, it is possible to take advantage of a shuttle service that runs along the entire North Rim of the Canyon and provides access to 2 of the 3 suspension bridges.On site, the main building offers a snack service and a pleasant terrace. There are also 2 wooded picnic areas, one of which is directly by the river.   (updated Feb 2022)

Eat[edit]
Since March 2020, in the context of health measures resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic, several restaurants or dining rooms in the Quebec City region have transformed the mode of meals at the tables into take-out or delivery service. In general, restaurateurs have demonstrated great resilience by updating their website, integrating interactive and automated applications for remote orders, as well as the display of the menu, opening hours, their mode of operation (e.g. by reservation, drive-thru service), required health measures (e.g., vaccination record, mask, distancing), other services (e.g., caterer, shops, accommodation, access for disabled, wi-fi, take-out, delivery), contact details and often the history of the restaurant or site. Considering the evolving context of the pandemic and government measures, it is recommended that customers inquire with each establishment by consulting their respective website.
