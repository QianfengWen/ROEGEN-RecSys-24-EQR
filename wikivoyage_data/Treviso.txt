Chiesa Convento San Francesco
A bridge on the Sile river in Treviso
On foot[edit]
Discovering the city on foot is very easy. The historic center is quite small, so you can go around in the narrow streets.

By bus[edit]
The local buses are okay, but by nighttime the service becomes quite infrequent. The fares are €1 within the Treviso Comune and €1.50 outside.

By car[edit]
It is better to avoid driving your own car, as there are lots of one-way streets in Treviso and a one-way ring road around the walled city.

By bike[edit]
With the local rental bike shops you can make a good excursion at Palladian Villas.  Ask locals for the Restera, a nice track all along Sile River. If you are brave, you can reach the Venetian Lagoon.
