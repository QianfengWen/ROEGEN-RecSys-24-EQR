Herm is an island measuring 1½ miles north-south by half a mile east-west, so it's the smallest of the publicly-accessible Channel Islands. It's part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey and lies 3 miles east of that island. The population is about 65 - the Census of 2021 recorded 87 on Herm combined with Jethou. Little has ever happened here, even during the wartime occupation. Notable past residents were the novelist Compton Mackenzie, and Prince and Princess Blücher of Prussia: the Prince, descended from the ally who saved Wellington's skin at Waterloo, decided that what Herm needed was lots and lots of wallabies.  


Get in[edit]

The only public transport to Herm is the Trident Ferry from St Peter Port on Guernsey. This sails daily year round, taking 20 min, with six sailings Apr-June and Sept-Oct, eight July-Aug, and only one Nov-March. In 2022 an adult return is £16, child £8, no charge for dogs. Buy tickets before boarding from the ticket kiosk, prominent next to the Weighbridge clock tower and roundabout on the Esplanade. (Or online, but that's only necessary if you need to be on a specific sailing, the ferry carries 70.) Listen carefully to their instructions for boarding and return, because these vary with the tides and weather. In St Peter Port it's usually the Inter-Island Quay a little further down the pier on the right, but at low tide it may be from next to the Weighbridge (the "Cambridge Steps" are no longer used). On Herm, it will be the main harbour at high tide, or Rosaire steps half a mile south at low water.

Get around[edit]
Walk. There are no vehicles on Herm, not even bikes. Locals use tractors and quads as necessary, and if you arrive with luggage for a stay-over, your accommodation can arrange a pick-up from the harbour. Spine Road is the bosky lane running the length of the island.

See[edit]
49.4717-2.44921 St Tugual's Chapel dates to the 11th century. The stained glass windows depict Noah's Ark and Guernsey cows, and Jesus talking to the fisherman at Herm harbour. It's named for the Breton Saint Tugual (d 564 AD) and is non-denominational and unconsecrated. It was restored in 2011 and is generally open.
Beaches: the south of Herm has a rocky coastline, but all round the north are sandy beaches, with the best on the sheltered east coast. Follow the lane across the island and the first is the small 49.474-2.4442 Belvoir Bay. Go a half a mile  north to the long 49.478-2.4483 Shell Beach.
49.458-2.4624 Jethou is the small island half a mile south of Herm. It's governed as part of St Peter Port on Guernsey, rather than as part of Herm. But the distinction is irrelevant since it's privately owned and you can't visit, and this is as close as you'll get.
Do[edit]
Outdoor Guernsey hire kayaks and paddleboards, lead kayak trips and do archery.
Garden tours are mid-April to mid-Sept, Tuesday at 11:00, £8.
Rock on Herm is next held on 23-24 Sept 2022.

Connect[edit]
The dialling code for Herm and Guernsey is +44, same as for mainland Britain and Jersey, so to call between them you don't dial +44. It's as if the entire Bailiwick of Guernsey was a mainland city with dialling code 01481 and UK domestic call charges.
Herm has 4G from each of its three carriers: Airtel-Vodafone, JT and Sure. As of Sept 2022, there are many dead areas towards the north and south of the island, and 5G has not arrived here. For the latest detailed coverage see GCRA[dead link], as Nperf doesn't track coverage in the Channel Islands.
Visitors from the UK and Europe should check their mobile provider for roaming charges.

Stay safe[edit]

You must have personal travel health insurance: like the rest of the Bailiwick of Guernsey, Herm has no reciprocal agreements with the UK National Health Service, EU "EHIC" system, or any other nation. Any local medical treatment must therefore be paid in full.

Back to Guernsey it must be.
