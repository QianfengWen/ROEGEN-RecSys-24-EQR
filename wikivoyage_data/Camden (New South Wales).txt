Camden is a town in the south west of Sydney in New South Wales.


Understand[edit]
Camden is a town at a crossroads. A prestigious and agricultural based town, Camden is on the very edge of Sydney's extensive urban sprawl.  The town still fiercely maintains is independent and country character, with a focus on its heritage, but it remains to be seen how long it can maintain this difference in the wave of development in Sydney's south west and new land releases right on the doorstep.

Get in[edit]
By car, Camden is a short diversion from the Hume Motorway (M31) heading south from Sydney. Around an hour from the city centre.
Bus services (with around 30 minute frequency) link Camden with Campbelltown station and Macarthur stations on the Sydney Trains network.  All the services accept Opal, and you can use the NSW TransportInfo for routing info.  
You can also take a bike on the train and cycle from Macarthur or Campbelltown to Camden, and an off-road/quiet road cycle route all the way from Campbelltown station to Camden.
There is a busy general aviation airport at Camden, but it's probably more useful for getting out then getting in.  If you're wanting a charter flight from Sydney to get out to some of the countryside in a hurry, Camden offers better value than the other Sydney airports.
