Understand[edit]

Tourist information sites[edit]
Official English Travel Guide is available on the city's site.
There is also a semi-official Visitors Guide site maintained by Hachioji Visitors & Convention Association (just one page for its English part).

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
If coming from Narita Airport (NRT IATA), take the JR Narita Express to Tokyo station, and change for the Chuo Line for service to Hachioji (about 2 hr 15 min, ¥3670). It is a real climb all the way up to the Chuo platforms, but since Chuo line trains start at Tokyo station, odds are you will probably find a seat. The alternative is to continue on the Narita Express to Shinjuku and from there board the Chuo Line, or the less-expensive Keio Line.
If you have a Japan Rail Pass, and if the timing is right, you may be able to reserve a seat on a Kaiji or Azusa train from Shinjuku and have a more comfortable journey to Hachioji.
The Narita Express runs directly from Narita Airport to Hachioji twice in the evening (leaving Narita 19:45 and 20:44), and there are two trains from Hachioji to Narita in the morning (05:19, 05:55).
Six daily airport limousine buses run from Narita to both the JR and Keio Hachioji train stations in about 2 hours, 40 minutes (¥3700).
From Haneda Airport (HND IATA), the easiest way to Hachioji by train is to take the Keikyu Line to Shinagawa, from where you can take the JR Yamanote Line in either direction, to either Tokyo or Shinjuku station, to pick up the Chuo Line for Hachioji. It costs ¥1180 no matter which way you go; allow about 1 hr 45 min. Slightly faster, but requiring an extra transfer, is to travel via Yokohama.
Six daily limousine buses go from Haneda to the JR and Keio Hachioji train stations in 1½-2 hours (¥1700).

By train[edit]
The two main railways serving Hachioji are the JR and the private Keio railway, both of which run directly to Tokyo. The two stations, Hachioji (for the JR) and Keio Hachioji, are separated by a 10-minute walk.
The cheapest trip between Tokyo and Hachioji is on the Keio railway, taking about 50 minutes on the fastest service at a cost of only ¥350. The JR Chuo Line travels to Mitaka from both Tokyo Station (¥780) and Shinjuku (¥460). The faster Chūō Special Rapid (中央特快 Chūō-tokkai) trains run from Shinjuku to Hachioji in 35 minutes, compared to regular rapid trains which take 50–60 minutes.
JR Hachioji is also a primary stop for Azusa (あずさ) limited express trains between Tokyo and Matsumoto, and Kaiji (かいじ) limited express trains between Tokyo, Otsuki and Kofu. These trains require a surcharge on top of the regular train fare. Japan Rail Pass holders can travel on these trains for free; lucky rail pass travelers can hop onto a Kaiji or Azusa unreserved seat car in Shinjuku and get to Hachioji in as little as 30 minutes.

By car[edit]

By bus[edit]
Overnight buses run into and out of Keio Hachioji station. Services run from Kyoto (Tama Bus/Keihan Bus; ¥7950 one way; ¥14310 round-trip), Osaka (Tama Bus/Kintetsu Bus; ¥8250 one way; ¥14770 round-trip) and Kanazawa (Tama Bus/Hokuriku Railroad; ¥8250 one way; ¥14850 round-trip)

Get around[edit]
City buses depart from all train stations and serve even the farthest outlying areas.  Taxis can also be found at train stations.  Renting a car is a reasonable option, but traffic can be slow and parking anywhere in Tokyo gets expensive.
