Lake Maggiore, as seen from Locarno
Locarno is a city at the northern end of Lake Maggiore in Switzerland. The city, along with Venice and Cannes, hosts an international film festival, the third oldest important cinema festival in the world.


Understand[edit]
Locarno was a spot for the rich and famous to meet and cure (real or supposed) ailments due to its climate and clean air. It was here that foreign minister Stresemann of The German Weimar Republic managed to negotiate a rapprochement with Britain and France that earned Germany re-admittance into the League of Nations and him the Nobel Peace Prize. However, as Stresemann died in 1929, the peace he helped build ultimately did not last.
More relevant to travellers today, Locarno has an extremely scenic location, with extraordinary views from the top of Monte Cardada and from Lago Maggiore, and both are easily accessible for most travellers.
