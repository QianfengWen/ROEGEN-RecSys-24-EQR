Great Yarmouth is a long-established English seaside town in the county of Norfolk,  at the mouth of the River Yare. Around 5 million people visit Great Yarmouth every year, making it Britain's third most popular seaside resort.


Understand[edit]
Great Yarmouth seafront.
Great Yarmouth is about 120 miles (172 km) to the north east of London, about 20 miles (32 km) from Norwich, the nearest city, and close to the Norfolk Broads — a popular network of inland lakes and rivers.
Great Yarmouth used to be the home of one of the most lucrative fishing industry and famous for herrings. Now it is a bustling and very popular seaside resort. Undoubtedly, one of the most popular attractions is Great Yarmouth Pleasure Beach, a free-entry theme park, which boasts 28 rides (including the 'Scenic Railway roller coaster', built in 1932) and draws annually 1.5 million visitors. The two piers, Britannia Pier and Wellington Pier, both contain family-orientated entertainment including a Bowling alley (Wellington) and a theatre (Britannia). 
As well as the usual thrills and spills one would expect on a classic British seafront, Great Yarmouth also has a quieter side, with a fascinating heritage quarter to explore. Not many people know that Great Yarmouth has the most complete city walls after York, with heritage walks to help you discover this medieval attraction along with several museums and houses dating back many centuries. If ghost walks are more your cup of tea, Eerie Tales and Yarmouth Yarns is the tour for you, (+44 1493 846346).
Great Yarmouth is also a centre for the North Sea oil and gas industry and increasingly for offshore wind power. The new outer harbour is a huge development taking place which will see cruise liners and larger ships coming to the town. The Maritime Festival in September each year celebrates Great Yarmouth's maritime heritage.
Yarmouth has seen significant regeneration spending to improve and modernise the popular seafront area and to ensure it is linked to the town centre. Regent Road has a stunning ceiling of light which is illuminated in the evenings and is now a lovely pedestrianed link street leading from town centre to the seafront area.
Illuminations along Marine Parade are also worth an evening stroll, some have been designed by children from local primary schools. Fireworks celebrations run for 6 weeks every Wednesday evening for the six weeks of the school summer holidays when a carnival atmosphere can been enjoyed.

Great Yarmouth has lots of car parking, all clearly signed. It is a common misconception that parking is difficult to find, but this is not actually the case, with many car parks to be found up and down Marine Parade on the sea front and in the town centre, catering for nearly 2000 cars. Prices start from £1.00 per hour in summer. If you do try to park on a side street to avoid paying, make sure you watch out for residents parking areas where a pass is required.
A refurbished and improved Marine Parade includes extra wide pavements and a special slow lane for bicycles and the landau. A widened road with clearly marked crossing areas for pedestrians and several new roundabouts mean that it is now much easier to cruise up and down when finding somewhere to park.
Regular bus and train services are also available.

Great Yarmouth's Holiday Mile
The Greater Yarmouth area has a variety of interesting and entertaining attractions to enjoy, whether you're on holiday, day-tripping or live in or around Norfolk.
