Mutare is the fourth largest city in Zimbabwe.


Get in[edit]
Although Mutare has an small airstrip there are no regular scheduled services; however airtaxi or small private planes may land. The nearest international gateway is in the capital, Harare.
National Railways of Zimbabwe[dead link] runs an overnight train service from Harare three times a week, leaving Harare at 9:30PM on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays. Arrival time is early morning the next day just after dawn, at 5:20AM according to schedule. Services have been in decline for the past few years, don't expect top-notch conditions. The 2nd class sleeper fare is $5. There are no cross-border rail services from Mozambique. -18.98395832.6632011 Mutare railway station is southwest of the city centre.
Roads are decent and asphalted but potholes are common. Highway A3 leads inlands towards Harare while A9 turns southwards. Across the border to the east is EN9 which connects with the coastal city of Beira. Traffic can be heavy since this is one of Zimbabwe's main routes to the ocean. There is also a lot of cross-border traffic with people visiting the nearby cities of Manica and Chimoio
Commuter buses are a popular way of travelling for traffic across the border and from outlying villages. Expect a rough ride however! Long-distance buses are also available from Harare.
There are buses from Johannesburg in South Africa.
