History[edit]

The community takes its name from the Highwood River, which flows through the town. The area was first inhabited largely by the Blackfoot First Nation, who called the site Ispitzee (or the “place of high trees along running water”). By 1870, after the arrival of the North-West Mounted Police and after Treaty Number 7 had been signed in 1877, settlers began arriving into the region. High River was a convenient location for people, horses and cattle to cross the Highwood River - a location known as "The Crossing".
Development of the town was supported by the completion of the Calgary and Edmonton Railway in 1892. High River was incorporated as a village in 1901, and as a town in 1906.
Although growth slowed during the First World War, it continued after the war with the building of brick structures and a number of industries. One of Canada's first air force stations was constructed to the east of the town in 1921. The establishment of a British Commonwealth Air Training Plan elementary flying training school at the same air station helped boost High River's economy during the Second World War.
The Highwood River is subject to frequent flooding. Flood events of exceptional magnitude occurred in 1894, 1899, 1902, 1908, 1912, 1923, 1929, 1932, 1942, 1995, 2005 and 2013. During the 2013 Alberta floods, thousands of people in Alberta were ordered to evacuate their homes after the rise of the Highwood River, Bow River, Elbow River Sheep River, and numerous others.  In 2013, three people died as a result of the flooding of the Highwood River.
