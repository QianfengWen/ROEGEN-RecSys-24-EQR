Genting Highlands is in Pahang, Malaysia which is famous for having Malaysia's only legal casinos, as well as theme parks, shopping malls and hotels.


Understand[edit]
Genting Highlands
Resorts World Genting on top of Genting Highlands
Genting Highlands — pronounced ghen-ting with a hard "G" — is a self-proclaimed "City of Entertainment". The primary draw is that Genting Highlands is home to the only legal casinos in Malaysia. It also features theme parks, shopping malls, hotels and convention centres. The resort offers six hotels with 10,500 rooms, over 50 fun rides, 170 dining and shopping outlets, shows, business convention facilities and entertainment options. As a plus, being up in the highlands means it's cooler than the steamy lowlands. Genting Highlands attracted 28.7 million visitors in 2019.
Those seeking natural beauty should visit the Chin Swee Temple, located slightly below the main attraction Resorts World Genting, a temple located in the middle of tropical forest where one needs to ride the Awana Skyway to reach the place, passing through the cloudy forest, or Resorts World Awana, a resort with an 18-hole golf course, jungle trekking, camping and bird watching.
Unlike many of Malaysia's other hill stations, Genting Highlands was not built by the British during colonial times; it was only built following independence by the late Malaysian-Chinese businessman Lim Goh Tong in 1965.

Orientation[edit]
Orienting yourself in Resorts World Genting is simultaneously easy and difficult. There are no "streets" of any kind; instead, all the gigantic buildings are connected with a vast warren of well-signposted walkways, tunnels and escalators. Nevertheless, you can easily spot any staff as you walk around and they will be more than happy to give you direction. Although not applied uniformly everywhere, you can always find naming directions written in combination of English, Malay and/or Chinese.

Climate[edit]
Located at an altitude of 1,800 m (5,900 ft), temperatures in Genting Highlands are a good 10°C lower than in Kuala Lumpur, generally staying in the 15-25°C range, and rarely falling below 14°C. The lowest recorded temperature ever was 8.4°C. On a clear day, there are stunning views down into the valley — but when it's raining in Kuala Lumpur, Genting Highlands is swathed in rolling clouds and visibility drops to zero. Thanks to the walkway system, you almost never need to venture outside (except when visiting the outdoor Genting SkyWorlds Theme Park), but hotel rooms are unheated and can get chilly at night.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The nearest airport is in Subang, Selangor. From there, take train (28 min) to KL Sentral then connect to the bus from there. The second nearest airport is Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang, Selangor. Express train (to KL Sentral), limousine and taxi services are available from the airport to Genting Highlands.

From northern region of Peninsular Malaysia, take train to Batang Kali Station and transfer to Aerobus Shuttle Service for destination to Genting Highlands. Bus departure times are at 9:30AM, 11:30AM, 2:30PM and 6:30PM. From the southern region, take train to KL Sentral and transfer to the express bus service to the highlands.

By car and taxi[edit]
Genting Highlands can be reached by car from Kuala Lumpur in about 1 hr on the Karak Highway. An executive taxi from the centre of Kuala Lumpur to Genting Highlands costs RM150-RM200 whilst a regular taxi from the centre of KL to Genting Highlands costs around RM60-RM70. Ride hailing services will cost you around RM130-140 with the same destination. Limousine services are available to Genting Highlands from Johor (Johor Bahru), Kedah (Alor Setar), Melaka, Penang (Butterworth, George Town), Perak (Ipoh) and Selangor (KLIA/KLIA2).

It is slightly cheaper to buy a combined bus and cable car ticket, costing RM20. A direct non-stop bus departs from Genting Highlands to KL, the last bus departing at 8PM (RM 35 one-way; travel time 2 hr, reservation available at bus counter no:3).
You may also consider buying the so-called Go Genting Golden Package (valid for one day only; RM 47, (RM 4 more on national public holidays) from the Genting ticket office on the second level of KL Sentral.

Stay safe[edit]
Casinos are generally very safe. Casinos take security very seriously and have cameras recording almost every square inch of their property, as well as uniformed security personnel patrolling at all times. There are two police stations in the highland, one at the hill top next to Genting SkyWorlds Hotel and one at the bottom hill in Gohtong Jaya.

Weather[edit]
Temperature can go relatively low at night and in early morning, so visitors are expected to have warm clothes with them. When thick cloud passes by the highland, expect some drizzle for a prolonged time, thus having raincoat or umbrella can be beneficial. Be extra careful for the slippery slope floors at Genting SkyWorlds Theme Park during raining time.

Cope[edit]
Wheelchair ramp in front of Genting Grand Hotel
Every place in Resorts World Genting is accessible-friendly. It is equipped with wheelchair ramps and lifts to access almost all floors available. Wheelchairs and baby strollers can be rented for free (with RM100 refundable deposit) at Customer Service Counter, Level 1 SkyAvenue.

Go next[edit]
Located at the border between Selangor and Pahang state, Genting Highlands stands in a strategic position for travelers to further their travel towards other hill resorts or inland towns in Pahang, yet maintain a relatively short distance to the capital Kuala Lumpur at all time.

Kuala Lumpur - the capital of Malaysia, 45 minutes away
Fraser's Hill - a nearby hill resort on the same mountain range as Genting
Bukit Tinggi - another nearby hill resort with European architecture design
Kuala Gandah - home to a famous elephant sanctuary
Kuantan - seat of the state of Pahang, about three hours away
