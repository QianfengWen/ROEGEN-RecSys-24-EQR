By car[edit]
Murwillumbah is about a 132 km (82 mi) drive from Brisbane CBD. From Brisbane, use the M1 south, past the NSW border, and take the exit at Tweed Valley Way (Tourist Drive 40) and continue for 20 km (12 mi) until Murwillumbah. While the motorway is good quality, Tourist Drive 40 is quite winding as it climbs the Great Dividing Range. Alternatively, you may take exit 95 north of the border and use State Route 98 and Tourist Drive 42 down to Murwillumbah.

Coolangatta Airport — 31 min (32.8 km) via M1 and Tweed Valley Way
Ballina Airport — 57 min (72.6 km) via M1 and Tweed Valley Way
