Portland is a coastal town in Victoria, roughly midway between Melbourne and Adelaide, just beyond the region known as the Great Ocean Road.


Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The township is a very short diversion from the Princes Highway, around 360km east of Melbourne.

By train and coach[edit]
V/Line train service connects with a coach service at Warrnambool to Portland, and on to Mount Gambier.

By plane[edit]
There is no regular passenger transport to Portland.  There is an airport, for charter flights, etc.  Mount Gambier and Melbourne are the alternatives.


Get around[edit]
See[edit]
Portland was Victoria's first permanent settlement, which gives it a rich heritage feeling with more than 200 historical buildings from the 1800s.
Portland has a long seafaring history beginning with the sealers and whalers that took shelter during southern storms in Portland's natural deep water harbour. Portland's Maritime Discovery Centre provides you with fascinating displays of this era as well information on whales with a Sperm Whale Skeleton, Southern Right Whale, Shark Showcase, the Portland Lifeboat from the 1850s, shipwreck displays and many other exhibits.
Today's waterfront is a hub of activity with ships from around the world loading up with local produce, the local fishing fleet bringing in their catch in the early mornings and locals and visitors alike strolling along the wide foreshore reserve.
Whales often visit in the winter months.
