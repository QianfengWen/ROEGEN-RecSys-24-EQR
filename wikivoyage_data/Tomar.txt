Legend of Santa Iria
Iria, a young woman, as rich in physical as in moral gifts, had a religious education in the Benedictine convent of Santa Clara. When the young woman reached adolescence, the Benedictine abbot, her maternal uncle, entrusted her education to the monk Remígio, who he considered worthy of such a delicate mission. She would early gather the sympathy of the nuns and the people of the village, especially the young men and gentlemen, who disputed among themselves the virtues of the novice; among whom stood out the young Britaldo who, surrendered to so much beauty, fell madly in love. Because she intended to dedicate her life to the service of God, she always rejected his loving proposals. 
Britaldo, mad with love, fell ill. Iria, moved by Christian charity, comforted him and convinced him of the impossibility of their marriage, as she had taken a vow of chastity. The monk Remígio was aware of Britaldo's loves, and also not indifferent to the maiden's beauty. Mad with jealousy, the monk made Iria drink a potion, provoking signs of pregnancy. Britaldo, considering himself deceived, commissioned his subordinate to kill Iria. And so, on October 20, 653, when Iria prayed her prayers devoutly in a small chapel by the river Nabão, the vile sicario buried a dagger in her chest, throwing her body into the waters. 
Iria's body, according to legend, went downstream, ending up at Scalabis. From then on, Scalabis took the name of the Holy Virgin and Martyr, Sant'Iria, today Santarém.
