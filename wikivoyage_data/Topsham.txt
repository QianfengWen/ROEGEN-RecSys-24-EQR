This article is about the town in England.  For the town in the US state of Maine, see Topsham (Maine)
Topsham is a town of 3,700 people (2011) in Devon in England's West Country. Formerly a major seaport, the town is now of interest for its architecture, scenery and proximity to nature reserves for wading and migrating birds, such as RSPB Bowling Green Marsh on the Exe Estuary, the whole of which is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).

Understand[edit]
Topsham is a part of Exeter, but used to be a town in its own right, and most locals to the area consider Topsham separate and distinct from Exeter. Before the arrival of the railway, situated as it is on the Exe estuary, it was a busy port concerned with fishing and shipbuilding and the import and export of goods of all description.
Topsham has become a desirable and high-value residential location. In the 21st century  development has expanded into the 'Topsham Gap' – greenfield land between Topsham and Exeter.

Get in[edit]
The M5 motorway crosses the Exe estuary just north of Topsham. Exit 30 is a couple of miles away. From Exeter there is a rail link running down the Exe estuary to Exmouth. Topsham has its own railway station. There is a frequent bus service from the Quay into Exeter.

Map of Topsham
See[edit]
On a sunny day, it's enough just to stroll around. Take a turn to the end of the Strand, as far as the Goatwalk. Venture up some of the side streets, perhaps Higher or Lower Shapter Street. If you choose Monmouth Street, walk as far as Monmouth Avenue on the left and cross the bridge over the road which once was the spur rail link to the Quay. Walk a few yards and find your way into White Street, where many of the fishermen used to live. Follow it back to the shore. Stroll along the Underway where, near the spot where the fishermen used to dry and repair their nets, you might like to climb the steps to St Margaret's Church. Or go further, past Trout's boatyard[dead link] to the ferry. Make your way out to Fore Street and do a little window gazing.
