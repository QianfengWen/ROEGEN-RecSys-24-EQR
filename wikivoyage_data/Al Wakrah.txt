Shell Roundabout in Al-Wakrah
Al-Wakrah is a city in eastern Qatar, just south of Doha. The town has a history independent from that of the capital, but it has developed into a bedroom community of Doha.


Understand[edit]
Get in[edit]
The Route 109 and 119 buses (timetable) pass through the Al Wakrah. Both leave from Al Ghanim Bus Station in Doha, with the 109 heading towards Mesaieed or Al-Wukair, and the 119 terminating in Al-Wakra. The frequency of both routes combined is about 5-20 minutes, with the journey time to the town centre being half an hour. There are different timetables for Saturday-Thursday and Fridays. Buses can be affected by service changes and disruptions, so it is recommended you call Mowasalat to confirm first on +974 4458 8888.
By private car, you should follow the Al-Wakrah highway signs out of Doha to the south-east, past the airport. The journey is just under 20 km, equating to 25 minutes in good traffic.
The newly opened Doha Metro Red Line connects Doha to the northern edge of the city. Multiple bus routes are available, such as M129 for inside main city, M134 covering some outskirts of main city and hospitals, M132 covering Al Junoub Stadium and M127 to Souq Wakra
