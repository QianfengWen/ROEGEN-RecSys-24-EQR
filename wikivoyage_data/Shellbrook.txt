History[edit]
European settlers began arriving in the area in the late 19th century and, in 1894, a post office named after the Shell Brook was established. More settlers began to arrive in the district in the early 20th century, with significant representation from people of British and Scandinavian origins. In 1910, the Canadian Northern Railway reached Shellbrook from Prince Albert and the community developed as a service centre for the surrounding agricultural region.
