Brynmawr is an easy to access town although in winter months snow can be a hazard. Brynmawr's town centre is easy accessible by car although walking access is limited with traffic lights hard to come by. A useful traffic light however has been placed by the entrance to Ebbw Vale, a handy tool for walkers. If you are however planning a trip to the Brecon Beacons, heading down to Abergavenny is useful and then up to Llanfoist.

51.797736-3.1743693 The Talisman, 9 Market Square, ☏ +44 1495 312138. The Talisman also being a pub isn't the most ideal place to eat with it also being next to Ladbrokes betting office but is a reasonable place to eat and serves good food with reasonable service. Just another place to eat in Brynmawr. 
 Gwesty Bach. Gwesty Bach (Little Hotel in English) is again also a pub but serves reasonable food once again. However the food and drink is quite expensive, though still a good view into the Brynmawr life. 
 The Griffin. The Griffin is another pub restaurant near the Market Hall Cinema next to the square. It however only serves Indian cuisine on the upper floor. Because of crime inside the building, it is not the best place to be but is a reasonable place. 
 Firat's Place. The corner kebab house, Firat's Place is an original place to eat. It is not the best kebab house to ever be made but it's got okay food and quick and easy for a cheap kebab 
 Munchies. Munchies is a local pizza restaurant and takeaway which is run by a very friendly family who make the pizzas within the warm restaurant. You can eat in or out but still a great pizza of your selection.
