Understand[edit]
The name Shōdoshima literally means "island of small beans". There are 2 towns on the island: Tonoshō (土庄) and Shodoshima Town. Along with Teshima, the island comprises Shozu District in Kagawa.
Shōdoshima is famous as the setting for the 1954 antiwar movie Twenty-Four Eyes (二十四の瞳 / Nijūshi no Hitomi). The movie is based on a book written in 1952 by Sakae Tsuboi (1899-1967), who was born on Shōdoshima.
In 1908, the island became the first in Japan to successfully cultivate olives. Olive trees proliferate on the island and olive-related merchandise is quite popular with tourists.
Shōdoshima is also known for its soy sauce, wild monkeys, and beaches.
