Los Alamos is a small town in northern New Mexico, about an hour northwest of Santa Fe. Its claim to fame is the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), where Oppenheimer and other physicists created the world's first atomic bomb during World War II. Many of Los Alamos's 12,000 residents work at the laboratory.  White Rock, with about 6,000, is a part of Los Alamos, but is separated from the main town by LANL. Nearly all of LANL is closed to the public, but the town has a couple of museums which are good places to learn about the history of the town.


Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
35°51′36″N 106°17′52″WMap of Los Alamos
From US 285 north of Santa Fe, take NM 502 west, which leads directly to the town.  This is a very scenic drive, with photo opportunities from the Clinton P. Anderson Scenic Overlook outside of town.  From NM 502 a side road, NM 4, leads to White Rock and Bandelier National Monument.
You can rent a car or passenger van from Hertz elsewhere and return it in Los Alamos, or rent it in Los Alamos and return it elsewhere, without paying a drop-off fee (if you rent by calling the Los Alamos office, +1 505 662-8907).  Residents and visitors alike find this convenient and inexpensive for getting to and from airports.  The Los Alamos office is inside the tiny main building at the Los Alamos County airport on NM 502 just east of town.
Crossing LANL property (e.g. when entering town from the west) requires passing a security checkpoint; but under most conditions require no more than slowing down or a brief stop.

By bus[edit]
Los Alamos is served by public commuter bus and commercial shuttle from several other cities in northern New Mexico.
New Mexico Park & Ride has direct bus service to Los Alamos from both Espanola and Santa Fe.  This is popular with commuters and occasional travelers alike.  The Los Alamos terminus is a bus shelter on Central Avenue between 19th St and 20th St.  It is in front of Mesa Public Library and a skate park and tot lot, in sight of the Reel Deal movie theater, and one block from the Aquatic Center.  The nearest public toilets are in the library lobby.  The Santa Fe bus can be used to make connections via Santa Fe to the Albuquerque airport (ABQ) using the Rail Runner train or the Sandia Shuttle Express. Connections can also be made in Pojoaque with shuttle services that run between Albuquerque and Taos.
By appointment, Roadrunner Shuttle and Charter (+1 505 424-3367) will take you from Santa Fe (airport SAF or downtown), Lamy (Amtrak train station) or Albuquerque airport to Los Alamos. Some Los Alamos bed-and-breakfasts may also be available to pick you up.

By bike[edit]
If you don't want to make the 2000-foot climb from the Rio Grande up the "big hill", you can hitch a ride on the commuter coach buses that serve Los Alamos.  They have front racks and luggage compartments.

By horse[edit]
Horse friendly trails abound in and around Los Alamos.  Travel through Santa Clara Pueblo requires a permit;  the permit is easy to obtain but must be obtained in advance.  Travel through Valles Caldera also requires advance permission, and may be iffy to obtain.  Travel around Valles Caldera, via its rim, is largely feasible although the first segment of a consolidated rim trail is now read for use.

By plane[edit]
Los Alamos has a municipal airport, with daily service to Albuquerque via Boutique Air. The single runway is adequate for a large commercial jet, and its approach is extremely scenic: cross the Rio Grande Valley to perch on top of a narrow mesa with canyons on either side.  Hertz rental car agency operates out of the airport terminal. Atomic Transit bus stops at the airport entrance on East Drive.
The Santa Fe airport (SAF IATA), 40 minutes away by car, has very limited commercial service. Albuquerque (ABQ IATA, 2 hours away by car) is served by most major airlines and is the airport of choice for most travelers to and from Los Alamos.

Get around[edit]
The downtown area is compact, and the museums and most restaurants are within easy walking distance of the main hotels and many of the B&Bs.  Public transportation by Atomic City Transit is free and includes both fixed routes and an on-demand service.
Many Los Alamos residents bicycle to work and around town.  Cycling is feasible for visitors as well, but be aware that the town is at an elevation of about 7320 feet (2231 meters) and quite hilly.  Puffing up the hills before you've acclimated to the altitude can be a surprisingly exhausting experience.
Road cycling is popular here, and some competitive road bicycle racers come here to train.  Popular routes include NM 502 between Los Alamos and Pojoaque, and Camp May Road up to Pajarito Mountain Ski Area.  White Rock is nearly a thousand feet lower and about 10 miles (16 km) away by road; riding to it on a bike can be a thrill, but oh, that hill coming back!  From White Rock you can take a bus back to townsite: Atomic City Transit buses are equipped with bike racks.
Los Alamos County has an extensive trails network that is open to mountain bikes.  The network is especially well developed around townsite, and connects to trails in Santa Fe National Forest and Pajarito Mountain Ski Area.  In summer and fall the ski area offers lift-served mountain biking:  ride the lift up and bike down easy sideslope trails or bomb down very challenging trails designed specifically for mountain biking.  The ski area also has a mountain biking terrain park.

See[edit]
Fuller Lodge
The downtown area contains a number of artifacts of the early days of the "Manhattan Project" to build the bomb, and the even earlier days "when Los Alamos was a ranch school" (the title, incidentally, of an interesting little booklet on the history of the town that is available in local bookstores). Start at pretty Fuller Lodge, one of the old ranch-school buildings and a local landmark, and work your way out.
35.8816-106.2991 Bradbury Science Museum, 15th St. and Central Ave, ☏ +1 505 667-4444. Su-M 1PM-5PM, Tu-Sa 10AM-5PM. Explains the principles behind atomic energy and its uses in peace and war. Also presents the historical and social issues surrounding atomic energy. Free.   (updated Jan 2016)
35.8809-106.30212 Los Alamos Historical Society, 1050 Bathtub Row (next to Fuller Lodge), ☏ +1 505 662-6272. M-F 9AM-5PM, Sa Su 10AM-4PM. A small museum on the history of the area, with associated bookstore containing a number of books written by Historical Society members on local culture, history, recreational opportunities, etc., including the one listed below under "References." $5.   (updated Apr 2019)
35.882-106.3023 Fuller Lodge Art Center, ☏ +1 505 662-1635. M-Sa 10AM-4PM. An art gallery with regularly changing exhibits, held in an old timber-framed lodge that was once the main building for the Los Alamos Ranch School, before becoming a gathering place for scientists during the Manhattan Project. The art center promotes the development of local and regional artists, and provides art classes and hosts arts & crafts fairs in August on the weekend of the Los Alamos Rodeo, and another in late October. The art center also operates a gift shop that specializes in handmade artworks including jewelry, picture postcards, paintings, ceramics and more. (updated Jan 2016)




Ashley Pond, or is it Ashley Pond Pond?
One of the downtown landmarks dating to ranch-school days is a little puddle, fed by runoff from the mountains, called Ashley Pond. The visitor might surmise that this lakelet was named for someone significant in the ranch school named Ashley, but would be only half right: the founder of Los Alamos Ranch School was named Ashley Pond. Punning students attached Pond's name in toto to the body of water, which should perhaps be called "Ashley Pond Pond" or "Pond Pond," but history and wit trump accuracy. Whatever you call it, Ashley Pond has undergone a transformation from its muddy stock-tank origins to a pleasant and well-kept little park just south of Fuller Lodge that's a nice place for picnics in the warmer part of the year. Tend small children carefully, as the pond has no constructed barriers to keep them from getting into the water.


35.8844-106.30674 Pajarito Environmental Education Center, 2600 Canyon Road, ☏ +1 505 662-0460. M W F Sa 10AM-4PM, Tu 10AM-8PM, Su 1-4PM. A nature center that offers exhibits on local amphibians, birds, butterflies, fossils, energy and more. Local critters and demonstration gardens are on display, with friendly volunteers and books to purchase on the local flora, fauna and trails written by local experts. The center is also connected to the regional trail system, with trails leading down into the canyon behind the center. Free. (updated Jan 2016)
35.826091-106.1845425 Overlook Park (White Rock). Contains athletic fields and a wheelchair-accessible scenic overlook of White Rock Canyon, the Rio Grande, and the mountainous country to the east, with a moderately rugged trail leading into the canyon. Pleasant for picnics, particularly in the fall; White Rock's lower elevation compared to Los Alamos proper means that it can be hot in the summer. 
Do[edit]
35.768275-106.3136311 Bandelier National Monument. Contains many Pueblo dwelling ruins to visit and other hiking opportunities. Don't forget to visit the separate Tsankawi unit of Bandelier, which is equally fascinating, but less visited. The latest hike to be opened at Bandelier is the Cerro Grande hike that rises up to the rim of the Valles Caldera National Preserve. The hike climbs 900 feet through beautiful forest and meadow and provides spectacular views of the surrounding area for miles around.   (updated Nov 2016)
35.83207-106.4872692 Valles Caldera National Preserve. A unit of the national park system in the Jemez Mountains. Recreational opportunities at the Preserve are still being developed; inquire locally. When driving up to the Jemez Mountains from Los Alamos on HWY 501/W. Jemez Rd., you will encounter what is locally known as "Bodman's Blocked Colon," a kink in the road with a "toll booth" like structure that provides security for the Los Alamos National Laboratory . Do not fear proceeding through the security entrance as it is open to the public unless security warning levels rise to most extreme levels. You will be able to continue on 501 unhindered; no stop is required under normal security conditions. How many places can you go and drive through a high security National Nuclear Research Laboratory site?   (updated Nov 2016)
35.894946-106.3913093 Pajarito Mountain. A very good and surprisingly challenging downhill ski area. Snow conditions can be marginal (indeed, during the drought years at the end of the 20th century, there were seasons when the area didn't open for months, or even at all), but when the snow is good, it's excellent value for dollar, with very small crowds. Rentals are available and a good lunch can be had. Cross-country ski trails are accessible from the same parking lot as services the downhill area; however, snow conditions are more likely to be marginal or not skiable than on the higher downhill runs. The area often runs its lifts during the summer to allow hikers, mountain bikers, etc., access to the top of the mountain. Camp May is a county park just beyond the ski area that is nice for picnics during the height of early summer heat, but skip it if you're prone to respiratory problems, as it's at very high altitude.   (updated Nov 2016)
 Trails. Los Alamos County boasts 58 miles of pedestrian/bicycle/equestrian trails through town and connecting to hundreds of miles of cross-country trails in the surrounding Santa Fe National Forest. Trails west and north of townsite were damaged severely by tree falls and erosion after the catastrophic Cerro Grande forest fire in 2000, but thanks to the hard work of many volunteers, trail damage has been repaired. Since 2006, each spring a 50-mile ultramarathon foot race has been held on these trails. A pleasant (at least until summer heat sets in) set of connecting trails lead into White Rock Canyon from several points around White Rock, they are known as the Red Dot & Blue Dot trails. Beware of rattlesnakes in White Rock Canyon. A good resource for mountain bike riding is the local mountain biking club, The Tuff Riders who know the area inside and out and are always willing to provide information. Free maps are available at the Visitors Center; other maps can be purchased at Otowi Station Bookstore beside the Bradbury Museum and Mesa Public Library has a complete collection of USGS topographic maps of New Mexico. (updated Nov 2016)
Santa Fe National Forest lies west and north of the town and offers many recreation opportunities such as hiking and exploring four-wheel drive roads. The reference book below gives more details. SFNF trails connecting to the Los Alamos trails network include:
Trail 287, Quemazon Trail
Trail 280, Pajarito Canyon Trail
Trail 279, Cabra Loop Trail
Trail 285, Guaje Ridge Trail
Trail 69, Mitchell Trail
35.883929-106.3075944 Larry R. Walkup Aquatic Center. Soak in the hot therapy pool or swim in the indoor swimming pool. On Wacky Wednesdays, Freaky Fridays, and Warm Water Weekends, the aquatic center has special recreational programs featuring pool toys and floating obstacle course. The therapy pool water is cholorinated; to soak without chorine travel to one of the undeveloped hot springs on the mountain above town, to developed hot springs in Jemez Springs or Ojo Caliente, or to Ten Thousand Waves in Santa Fe. (updated Nov 2016)
35.899752-106.3061895 Los Alamos County Golf Course. An exceptional golfing experience at an altitude of 7,400 ft (2,300 m).

35.879815-106.3259856 Los Alamos County Ice Rink. A seasonal outdoor NHL regulation size ice skating facility. Operated by the Los Alamos County Recreation Division the Rink offers youth and adult hockey, public skating, skating lessons, holiday events, and a full concession stand. (updated Nov 2016)
For a small town, Los Alamos attracts some very good musical groups, particularly in the classical genre. The Los Alamos Concert Association runs a subscription series of concerts by internationally-known classical performers. The professional Santa Fe Desert Chorale and non-professional but very good Sangre de Cristo Chorale and Coro de Camara perform choral music. Popular concerts occur frequently in the main community shopping center, and there are "coffeehouses" on several Friday nights a year at Fuller Lodge; inquire locally for details.
 Los Alamos Festival, Fair and Rodeo. On the second weekend of August (Friday-Sunday), Los Alamos holds its annual festival, fair and rodeo. Musical and rodeo events happen each day. On Saturday, an arts & crafts fair can be found on the east lawn of Fuller Lodge, sponsored by the Art Center at Fuller Lodge. A hometown parade goes down Central Avenue on Saturday. (updated Nov 2016)

Buy[edit]
35.880514-106.2945791 Casa Mesita Thrift Shop, 747 Central Ave, ☏ +1 505 662-7235. An interesting "local color" business. It doubles as a second-hand store and repository for the townsfolk's odds and ends, some of them very odd indeed. Proceeds from sales support a group home for girls from difficult domestic environments. 
Eat[edit]
As with many communities in New Mexico, it makes sense to categorize restaurants as "New Mexican" (specializing in enchiladas, stuffed sopaipillas, etc., with the usual "red or green?" choice of chile—red is usually hotter, green more flavorful, but inquire) or otherwise. Most restaurants cater to the community more than to the tourist, and consequently, many are closed on Sunday and some even on Saturday. Check on open days and hours before deciding where to eat.

Budget[edit]
35.879331-106.3006131 Chile Works, 1743 Trinity Dr, ☏ +1 505 662-7591. A take-out joint that looks like (indeed, used to be) an old used-car lot. Open for breakfast and lunch only, closed on Sunday and Monday. Lunches respectable, and the breakfast burritos are excellent; you'll have to wait in line with commuters and students heading for high school who flock here to start their days. Although it's mainly take-out, a few outside tables are available. 
35.87994-106.2985652 Viola's (across Trinity from Chili Works (the local phone book's Yellow Pages entry for its address is incorrect)), ☏ +1 505 662-5617. Standard New Mexican fare in a busy diner-like setting, run by a long-standing Los Alamos restaurateur family. Very good service with very fast turnaround. Excellent breakfast, good enchiladas and sopapillas. Open for breakfast and lunch, Monday through Saturday. 
35.880972-106.3011213 Ruby-K's Bagel Cafe, 1789 Central Ave, ☏ +1 505 662-9866. Bagels, bagel sandwiches, soups, salads, breakfast bagels, coffee, smoothies and other goodies. Indoor/outdoor seating. Very tasty! Open early serving breakfast and lunch till mid afternoon. 
35.88065-106.3013294 El Parasol Restaurant, 1903 Central Ave (next door to Ruby-K's and Starbuck's). Tasty tamales and tacos, regular & breakfast burritos, chips & salsa, green chile stew and other Mexican fast food dishes. A Lab lunchtime favorite. 
35.899433-106.3204215 Bob's Bodacious BBQ, 3801 Arkansas Ave (in a small strip mall hidden behind a gas station in Los Alamos's "North Community" neighborhood. From the Trinity/Diamond intersection at the west end of town, go north on Diamond Drive about 1.5 miles and take a left at the light near the Conoco station and onto Arkansas), ☏ +1 505 662-4227. Take-out or eat-in Texas-style barbeque. Order at the counter from a choice of tasty, slow-cooked offerings such as beef brisket, pulled pork, and smoked chicken, together with a variety of down-home sides like potato salad or cole slaw. The place clearly aims primarily at the take-out market (paper plates and plastic forks), but several tables are available, as is a reasonable selection of bottled beers, including several good microbrews. 
Mid-range[edit]
35.899649-106.3200476 Cafe Sushi, 3801 Arkansas Ave, ☏ +1 505 662-7131. This tiny hole-in-the-wall sushi bar offers some of the best sushi in the state, the fish always remarkably fresh (considering it is 1000 miles inland) and expertly prepared. Located in the same out-of-the-way strip mall as Bob's BBQ, above. Open M-F for lunch and dinner. Seating is scarce and that the hours for this mom-and-pop operation can be rather arbitrary, particularly for dinner: they close as soon as the day's ration of fish and rice is exhausted, which often can be as early as 6:45PM, so go early. 
35.88225-106.2992057 Red Dragon Bowl, 121 Central Park Square (Shopping center in the middle of town), ☏ +1 505 662-2883. One of several surprisingly good Chinese restaurants in town. This one is subpar for dinner, but the lunch buffet (open M-F) is very good value for dollar. Come here for lunch, but for dinner, instead try 
35.880703-106.2946098 China Palace, 759 Central Ave, ☏ +1 505 662-4433. The best Chinese dinners in town, with pleasant service. The various clay-pot dishes are excellent. Take-out is available. So-so for lunch (M-F), but strongly recommended for dinner (7 days). 
35.877051-106.3254459 Hot Rocks Java Cafe, 4200 W. Jemez Rd, ☏ +1 505 663-5282. The only eating place on the "Laboratory," as opposed to "town," side of the bridge separating LANL from the community (other than the lab's own cafeteria, where the public is only grudgingly accepted), and hence convenient if you're driving into the mountains, although parking is a headache. A reasonable mixed bag of lunches, again with edible quiche, but usually very busy as it serves the LANL workforce. Breakfast and lunch M-F only. 
35.882356-106.30107910 Origami, 182 Central Park Sq, ☏ +1 505 661-2592. Excellent sushi and other dishes. 
35.880674-106.2947211 Pyramid Cafe, 751 Central Ave, ☏ +1 505 661-1717. M-F 11AM-8PM. Spin-off of a Santa Fe restaurant with the same name; slightly more formal atmosphere but similar menu of Greek and Mediterranean choices. 
Splurge[edit]
35.881046-106.2947512 Blue Window Bistro, 813 Central Ave, ☏ +1 505 662-6305. American-meets-Continental fare with some creativity. Lunch M-F, dinner M-Saturday. Decor is unique, homey and eclectic, with great pieces of Santa Fe inspired artwork adorning every wall. The Pork Adobo and Fillet Mignon are outstanding. Plan to relax (you'll have to for dinner whether you intend it or not, as service then can be glacially slow) and stay for the dessert, which is out of this world. 
Drink[edit]
Los Alamos contains more churches than bars, which is a probably sufficient commentary on the night life. Some of the restaurants occasionally offer live entertainment on Friday and Saturday evenings.

 Bathtub Row Brewing, 163 Central Park Sq, ☏ +1 505 500-8381. (updated Feb 2023)
Sleep[edit]
Accommodations can be hard to find during the second week of October, when Albuquerque, 90 miles away, hosts the Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta.  If you're visiting at that time and planning to stay in a hotel or B&B, reserve well in advance.

Lodging[edit]
There are curiously few hotels and motels in town, given the number of travelers (mainly professional) who pass through the area. There are also several bed and breakfasts in Los Alamos and one or two in White Rock.

35.827443-106.2089871 Hampton Inn, 124 State Rd (White Rock), ☏ +1 505 672-3838. 
35.880521-106.3052492 Comfort Inn and Suites, 2455 Trinity Dr, ☏ +1 505 661-1110. 
35.895457-106.3251043 North Road Inn (B&B), 2127 North Rd, ☏ +1 505 662-3678. 
Camping[edit]
35.7-106.24 Santa Fe National Forest, ☏ +1 505 667-5120. The national forest has primitive camping. The forest is big, the people are few, and the campsites are great. Explore back on the dirt roads until you find a fire ring. Seasonal closures due to fire hazard are common (see under "Stay safe"). Call for information on current closures/restrictions. Horses are welcome.   (updated Nov 2016)
 Camp May (Above the Pajarito Ski Area.). An undeveloped campground. Horses are welcome here and at the transient pens at the County Rodeo Ground on North Mesa. At both locations, permits are required for any overnight use. Closed in winter. (updated Nov 2016)
 Bandelier National Monument. There are two campgrounds: Juniper Campground, catering to families and small groups, and Ponderosa Campground, which serves large groups (by reservation). (updated Nov 2016)
There is a tiny RV park at East Gate on NM 502 just east of town and the municipal airport; perched on the tip of a mesa, this RV park has stunning views. There is a large RV park 20 minutes away, on US 84/285 in Pojoaque; it has hookups and is within easy walking distance of several restaurants.
Stay safe[edit]
Violent crime is almost unknown in Los Alamos.  The biggest lawbreaking threat to life and limb is drunk drivers.  Northern New Mexico has an unfortunate and well-deserved reputation for DUI problems.  Be alert when driving on the arterial roads after 10PM, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights.  Another driving hazard is wildlife.  Mule deer can be seen around town all year long, day and night.  Herds of elk come down from the Jemez Mountains during the winter and often congregate around the roads.  If your car hits an elk at highway speed, the elk may lose, but you will most assuredly not win.  Be careful driving after sundown during the winter months.
Believe it or not, one of the most important types of fatal accident sustained by townspeople is falling off a cliff—sometimes a cliff literally in the victim's back yard.  The sheer canyon walls that give the area much of its natural beauty also pose traps for the unwary recreational hiker.  If you're out enjoying the many hiking trails around town, stay on the trail when around a cliff unless you're doing roped climbing.
In most other regards, Los Alamos is an almost absurdly safe place.  When pursuing outdoors activities, take the usual precautions, with maybe a little extra attention to fire safety; several of the disastrous forest fires the area experienced over the last 30 years resulted from poorly constructed campfires that were not well put out and thus smoldered, eventually starting up again and igniting tinder.  If the national forest is closed to camping owing to fire hazard (as often happens in early summer) or forbids open fires (which can happen almost any time from May until August), please comply and seek your accommodations somewhere else.  One final note: bubonic plague is endemic to northern New Mexico, and plague-bearing fleas and rodents have been trapped from within the city limits.  As cautioned in the article on Bandelier National Monument, if you see a distressed or dead rodent or other small animal, leave it alone; buzzards are immune to plague, you are not.

Medical care[edit]
35.881892-106.3194251 Los Alamos Medical Center, ☏ +1 505-662-4201. A small municipal primary care hospital. Serious injuries are sent on to larger hospitals in Santa Fe, Albuquerque, and more distant points by ambulance.

Santa Fe is one of the world's great travel destinations and is only about 35 miles (55 km) away by road.  It would be silly to make a vacation stop to see Los Alamos and not see Santa Fe.
Taos, another fine travel destination, is a little over an hour away.  Retrace your path down NM 502, but before reaching Pojoaque, turn off on NM 30 to Española by way of Santa Clara Pueblo.  NM 30 leads you to NM 68 and eventually Taos via a beautiful drive along the Rio Grande.  Or, take the "high road" to Taos through a series of tiny Colonial Spanish mountain villages.
If traveling to Albuquerque on the way home from Los Alamos, consider forsaking the highway route (NM 502 to US 84/285 to I-25) in favor of the "back road" through the Jemez Mountains.  Take NM 501 west out of Los Alamos and proceed past the Camp May road to a T intersection with NM 4.  Left leads back to Bandelier; instead turn right, climbing steeply and spectacularly into the mountains and through Valle Grande, the largest grass meadow of the Valles Caldera.  On emerging on the west side of the mountains, NM 4 connects with NM 44 (US highway 550) which leads back to the interstate close to Albuquerque.  This takes up to half an hour longer than the highway route but is worth it for the mountain scenery.  Be wary of radar traps, and skip it in winter after a snowstorm, as the road through the mountains may be temporarily impassable.
