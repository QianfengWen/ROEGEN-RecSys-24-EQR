Merikarvia (Swedish: Sastmola) is a municipality of 3,000 people (2021) by the coast in northern Satakunta, Finland.


Understand[edit]
Merikarvianjoki at Kiila
Merikarvia has an intricate coastline with many bays and capes. Along and farther off the coast there are many islands. Some islands and the sea outside the archipelagos belong to Bothnian Sea National Park. There are tours to the Oura archipelago far out. The river Merikarvianjoki offers nice fishing.

Get in[edit]
61°52′41″N 21°30′0″EMap of Merikarvia

E8 along the western coast passes through the eastern part of Merikarvia. Road 270 from Siikainen leads from E8 to the centre (8.5 km).
Road 2680 leads along the coast from Ahlainen north of Pori to the centre of Merikarvia and continues northward to Sideby of Kristinestad as road 6600.

By bus[edit]
There are buses from Pori (ca 50 km, 1 hr, €12.60 as of 2022) several times daily in schooldays, some along E8, some via Ahlainen, some via Noormarkku. They are operated by Aaro E. Mäkelä (as of 2022). There are also a few services from Isojoki. In weekends you probably have to resort to express buses along E8 and get off at the crossroads (Tuorila).

By boat[edit]
The official fairways come from the open sea. There is a half-official boating route (1.0 m) through the archipelagos from Pori along all the Merikarvia coast; it is narrow, going amidst very stony waters.

Get around[edit]
Villages along E8 are easily reached by the coaches, at least in school days. A few coaches drive along the coast, via Pohjansaha and Peippu, a few via Kuvaskangas and Koittankoski. Mostly you'd like to have a bike or car, though, or take a taxi.
