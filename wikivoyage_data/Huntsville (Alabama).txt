Huntsville is in northern Alabama, about 20 miles (32 km) from the border with Tennessee. The city is a center for missile defense and aerospace technologies, with companies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Northrop Grumman having major operations here. Cummings Research Park, the second largest research park in the country, is home to many of these companies.


Understand[edit]
Huntsville was founded in 1805 by a Virginia man named John Hunt. For the first 140 years of its history, the city was a sleepy cotton town. In 1950, the US Army transferred Dr. Werner von Braun and his team of German rocket scientists to Redstone Arsenal. Within a decade, the city became a center for rocket design and construction. In 1960, NASA opened the Marshall Space Flight Center, which has played a significant role in the Mercury-Redstone (named after Redstone Arsenal), Gemini, and Apollo manned space programs.
Huntsville is home to almost 200,000 residents (2018). The Huntsville metro area, with 463,000 residents, is the third largest in Alabama, after Birmingham and Mobile, though the city proper became the largest in Alabama as of the 2020 Census. Madison, Athens, Decatur, and a number of smaller cities are generally considered part of the Huntsville metro area.

Summers are hot and humid, but the thermometer rarely goes above 100 °F (38 °C). Strong thunderstorms do come out of nowhere in the afternoons. Autumn is quite comfortable in Huntsville. First frost normally happens around Halloween. In winter, snow is a possibility, but never a guarantee. Most snow in Huntsville is on the light side (less than 2 inches). However, any snow amounts more than 1/3" can close roads and schools.
Being in a "tornado alley", Huntsville gets many tornado warnings in the spring, as well as a second tornado season around November-December.

In general, the most dangerous region of the city is the northern neighborhoods (particularly the northwest). In addition to crime, If hiking on Monte Sano or engaging in some other outdoor activity, be aware that during the Summer, temperatures can hit triple digits and one can dehydrate quickly.  Be sure to consume an adequate amount of fluids during the warm temperatures.
