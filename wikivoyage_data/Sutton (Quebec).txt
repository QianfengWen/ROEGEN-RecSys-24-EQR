Main Street (Quebec Route 139)
Sutton is a village of 3,900 people (2011) in the Eastern Townships in the south-east of Quebec.


Understand[edit]
Like many other communities in the southwestern quadrant of the province, Sutton was an anglophone enclave in a predominantly Francophone province. Today Anglophones make up only 33% of the population, compared to 60% for Francophones and 5% for Allophones.
Because there are many Swiss people in the town, Sutton has many German-speakers. Every year Swiss National Day is celebrated at Mont Sutton ski resort on the last Saturday in July.

History[edit]
Like many other towns and villages in the Eastern Townships, Sutton became home to many United Empire Loyalists, following the American Revolution. In 1799 the first recorded Loyalists immigrated to the area, among them Richard Shepherd, originally of New Hampshire. During the 19th century, new buildings were erected to serve the town's growing population, among them a school in 1808 (located on the road linking the town to nearby Abercorn) as well as the town hall built in 1859. In the decades that followed, Protestant and Roman Catholic churches were built as was a railway station.
The economy has moved from one largely based on farming to one that is heavily reliant on tourism due to the opening of Sutton Ski Resort in 1960. Sutton has also become a popular destination for road biking, hiking and visits to vineyards making it an all-year tourist destination.
