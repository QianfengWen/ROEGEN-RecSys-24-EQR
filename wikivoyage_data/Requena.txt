Requena is a town of 20,000 people (2018) in the west of Valencia province. It is dominated by the ancient citadel of the Moors, and still has traces of the original town walls. There are three ancient parish churches. Near the town are the sulphurous springs of Fuentepodrida. It is known for its excellent wines.


Understand[edit]
Requena (from Arabic rakka'na – 'strong') was established by the Iberians in the 7th century BCE, and was later occupied by the Romans. During the Moorish period it was part of the Muslim kingdom of Valencia, but after the Christian reconquista in the 13th century it became part of the kingdom of Castille, to which it belonged until the mid-19th century when it rejoined Valencia. Largely for this reason the principal language spoken here is Spanish, not Valencian as in other parts of the province.
In the Middle Ages the town grew wealthy from the silk trade. Following the collapse of the silk economy in the 19th century it became more known for its excellent wines, a reputation which continues to the present.
