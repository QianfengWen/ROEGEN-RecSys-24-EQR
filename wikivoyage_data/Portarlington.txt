For other places with the same name, see Portarlington (disambiguation).

Portarlington is a town in County Laois, with a population of 9300 in 2022. Locally it's referred to as "Port", but so too is nearby Portlaoise, so that term isn't used here. The River Barrow flows through town and forms the county boundary, with most of Portarlington east in County Laois, but a section of it west in County Offaly.


Understand[edit]
"Port" in this context is "Fort", as it was land confiscated after the rebellion of 1641 and awarded to Baron Arlington. His plantation colony flopped, so it was re-settled by French Huguenots, and French was used in school lessons and church services as late as 1820.

The town is compact, but you might need a car or transportation to see areas outside the town centre.

See[edit]
53.162-7.191 Market Square is the town centre, with 18th- and 19th-century low-rise in the streets around. The Huguenot tradition really only lives on in the name French Church Street, referring to St Paul's (Church of Ireland). Services were held in French in its predecessor into the 1820s, but the present church was built over the site in 1851. St Michael's is the Roman Catholic church, west on Patrick St.
53.144-7.1882 Carrick Wood is on a small hill south side of town. Stroll up from the car park to "The Spire", an 18th-century folly probably made from the ruin of a windmill. The town waterworks are adjacent.
53.156-7.1473 Lea Castle is a ruin along R420 four km east of town. It was built in fits and starts over the 13th century, replacing a timber and earthwork structure, and in its pomp was a mighty four-towered donjon or keep with an inner and outer moat and bawn wall. But it was wrecked on multiple occasions, and was already in a sorry state when Cromwell's troops came by in 1650, and wrecked it some more just to keep their hands in. One last tenant lived here until 1737. The ruin is overgrown and unsafe, so it's closed to the public, and work is under way to try to stabilise what remains.
53.107-7.1974 Emo Court, Emo R32 C44V, ☏ +353 57 862 6573. Grounds daily 8:30AM-4:30PM. Grand neo-classical mansion, designed by Gandon in 1790 but construction took another 70 years. Then at last the Earls of Portarlington could enjoy it and entertain in glittering style, but these were the final halcyon days of the Protestant ascendancy. Arms Quarterly 1st & 4th, Barry nebuly of six Argent and Gules, over all a Bend engrailed Azure... (and so on, at some length) somehow didn't enthrall an independent Republic of Ireland. The family left, and the house lay empty until 1930, then was a Jesuit college until 1969. Not wishing to sully their pious gaze with Grecian nymphs, the Jesuits chucked the statues in the lake. The estate was bought by Major Cholmeley Harrison, who restored the house, fished out the statues and opened the gardens to the public. House and gardens are now curated by the Office of Public Works, but the house is closed for restoration until summer 2024. (updated May 2024)
53.182-7.1895 Derryounce Lake was a bog where peat was commercially extracted to burn at Portarlington power station. It caused pollution, and extraction ceased in 1980, and the cutaway bog flooded to create Lough Lurgan, now a wetland wildlife haven. Derryounce was created by digging through the peat to a layer of sand, which was heaped up to form an inland beach. There are trails and boardwalks.
