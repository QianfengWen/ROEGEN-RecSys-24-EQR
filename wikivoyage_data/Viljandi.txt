Understand[edit]
A cobblestone path and old wooden houses in Viljandi
Evidence of civilization around Viljandi dates back to 500 BC. The first written record of a "Viljandi stronghold" was in 1154 in the commentaries to al-Idrisi's world atlas "Geography." Hanseatic merchants settled in Viljandi in the 14th century. 
During the Soviet era, Viljandi was an important center of agriculture and industry, and many new apartment blocks and industrial facilities were built. However, the town also suffered from neglect and environmental degradation during this time.
For many people Viljandi conjures up images of the Viljandi Folk Music Festival and Viljandi Culture Academy. This small city is a cultural hub and the "capital of folk music" for most Estonians and a treat for the eye.  Old wooden houses, cobblestone roads, the beautiful surroundings of the castle and the nearby lake make this city something special.

The fortress got its final shape and size in the beginning of the 16th century and was one of the most distinguished fortresses in Estonia and Latvia. Owing to various wars, all that are left from the entire order castle today are just a few stone walls, however they still give an impression of its former grandeur.
