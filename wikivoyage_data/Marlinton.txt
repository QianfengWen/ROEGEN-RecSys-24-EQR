Roadkill Cook-off, ☏ +1-800-336-7009. Part of the Autumn Harvest Festival, held annually in late September. Cooking begins at 11AM, judging at 3PM. A culinary competition in which chefs prepare dishes made from animals that are commonly found on the side of the road: turkey, opossum, squirrel, rabbit, groundhog, bear, deer, boar, elk, moose, rattlesnake, frog and turtle. Dishes are usually given unappetizing names, such as "Turkey Gobble Vomit over Maggots", "Squirrel Scrotum Stew" or "Blood, Rocks and Guts over Snails and Maggots". The cook-off started in 1991 as a joke, in a bid to increase tourism to the area, and although it has drawn criticism for playing on a negative stereotype of Appalachians, the contest attracts cooks from all over. Visitors can sample the results. There's also arts and crafts, an agricultural and homemaking show, mountain music and dancing, and regular food concessions.
