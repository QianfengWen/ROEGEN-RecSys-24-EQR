Gouda is a city in the province South-Holland in The Netherlands. It is a typical Dutch city with many old buildings, canals and pretty sights, and is a popular destination for a day trip. It is also a good base for exploring the rest of the Netherlands, thanks to its great rail- and highway connections. The city is famous for its cheese, its 15th-century town hall and the amazing glass windows in St. Janskerk, but there is a lot more to see and do.

Gouda has a population of about 71,000. As well as its cheese, Gouda is also famous for its stroopwafels (syrup waffles), candles and its clay pipes. Most of the city is below sea level. The lowest point of the Netherlands can be found a few kilometres outside the city and is marked by a monument.
Gouda is pronounced GHOW-da (IPA: [ˈɣʌudaː]), with the 'g' pronounced similarly to the 'ch' in 'loch' but voiced in the throat instead of mouth, not with a hard 'g' like how native English speakers pronounce the name of the cheese. The "ou" sound should rhyme with cow or the German haus. Saying the name correctly will win you points with the locals!

History[edit]
Gouda is named after the river Gouwe and the Van der Goude family, who built a castle on the Gouwe River in the 11th century. At that time, the area was swampland. Over the next two hundred years peat was collected and the land was developed. In 1225, a canal was built connecting the Gouwe River with the Oude Rijn (part of the Rhine delta). This was used to help ship goods to France and further afield. This provided a safer route than traveling by sea. This resulted in a surge of economic activity around Gouda and the town gained importance. In 1272, it was declared a city by count Floris V. Most of the canals were built around this time.
Over the years, there have been fires (1361, 1438), occupations (1572) and plagues (1574, 1625, 1636, 1673). In 1577, the castle was destroyed. Despite these disasters, Gouda is still a beautiful place to visit.
In 1667 a tax was introduced on the locally produced cheese. This raised a lot of money for the town. In 1668, the Waag (cheese weighing house) was built, to weigh the cheese and collect this tax.

The city centre of Gouda, like many other historic Dutch cities, is surrounded by a circular canal. The city only started to expand beyond this circle in the late 19th century, so most historic sights can be found within it. It is also the main shopping district of the city.

By foot[edit]
The centre of Gouda is easy to walk around. Most of the streets are pedestrianized. The main shopping street, Kleiweg, is pedestrianized and bike free. At the centre of Gouda and the end of Kleiweg is the central square of the city, called Markt. The Stadhuis and De Waag are here, and this is where the weekly cheese market takes place.

By bike[edit]
If you want to travel outside the centre of Gouda, biking is a good option. At the tourist office, staff can tell you the most interesting routes to cycle, both within the city as well as the immediate surroundings (Groene Hart). Most of the streets in the centre are bike friendly, the main exception being Kleiweg. You can walk along this street with your bike, just don't cycle. As you would expect in a Dutch city, there are lots of bicycle parking opportunities. Make sure you lock it. Bike theft is very common in the Netherlands.

Go next[edit]
Due to its central location, Gouda makes for a good base to explore the region and easily connects to other sights in the Netherlands.

Oudewater - this village is 15 km from Gouda, and the route in between makes for a scenic bike ride. Oudewater is famous for its witch weighing house, where they issue certificates proving people aren't witches. It became famous during the 16th century because people accused of witchcraft were offered an honest chance of proving their innocence. In many cities and countries such trials were usually rigged, resulting in the burning or drowning of hundreds of innocent people. No witches ever were found in Oudewater...
Rotterdam - the second largest city in the Netherlands, and the second largest port in the world is only 15 min from Gouda. Check out its 20th-century architecture and great shopping.
The Hague - home of the Dutch government and the residence of the Dutch Queen, this city is full of history at less than half an hour from Gouda.
Utrecht - the city has some great historic architecture and is a transport hub for the Netherlands.
Delft - a historic city known for its Delftware pottery, Delft is about 40 min away (by train or car) from Gouda.
Leiden - with the second-largest city centre (after Amsterdam) and a lively student population, Leiden is an interesting city to visit.
