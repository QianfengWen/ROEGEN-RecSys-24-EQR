Bad Muskau is a spa town in northeastern Saxony, Germany, on the border with Poland. It is known for its palace and extensive landscape gardens that are a UNESCO World Heritage site.


Understand[edit]
Old Castle
"Fuchsia" bridge
Bad Muskau is located on the western bank of the river Neisse, in the northeastern-most corner of the German state of Saxony, right on the border triangle with the state of Brandenburg and with Poland. In the 19th century, it was the residence of the Counts of Pückler-Muskau, most notably Prince Hermann von Pückler-Muskau (1785–1871), the most famous scion of this family, a colourful adventurer, author, womaniser, patron of the arts, and—most importantly—landscape gardener.

German-Polish border crossing and entrance to Bad Muskau
The Polish town Łęknica (German Lugknitz) used to be a borough of Bad Muskau, until they were separated after the Second World War by the Neisse border river. While the spa and palace are in the German part, two thirds of the parks are on the Eastern, i.e. Polish, bank. For decades, the two parts were separated and the bridges were blocked or even destroyed. Thanks to European integration, they form a whole again, and you may stroll through both parts without passing a border checkpoint. Nevertheless, you should bring your passport (ID card suffices for EU citizens) as there may be infrequent spot checks.

Get in[edit]
The closest airports are Dresden (115 km away) and Berlin Brandenburg Airport (140 km).
Regular rail service to Bad Muskau was seized. The nearest station that is still served is in Weißwasser (9 km from Bad Muskau) from where you have to continue by bus, or ask your hotel to pick you up (some of them offer this service). By train and bus it takes 2 hr 45 min from Dresden (change in Görlitz and Weißwasser), 2 hr 50 min from Berlin (change in Cottbus and Döbern). From either Görlitz or Cottbus it is a 1 hr 10 min ride.
ZVON[dead link] combi-tickets are valid both in local trains and busses. With an international EURO-NEISSE-Ticket, you may even cross the border to the neighbouring parts of Poland.
Only during the summer months, there is a heritage small-gauge railway from Weißwasser to Bad Muskau. It is however used for amusement rather than as an actual means of transportation.
The most comfortable way to get in is by car. From the Berlin area, take autobahn A 15 to exit no. 6 Roggosen, then follow the road to Döbern and finally the B 115 to Bad Muskau. From Dresden, take A 4 to exit no. 90 Bautzen-Ost, then follow B 156 road to Bad Muskau. The 160-km drive from Berlin takes about two hours, the 120 km from Dresden about 1½ hours. Both Cottbus and Görlitz are 40 km (40 minutes) from Bad Muskau.
Finally, Bad Muskau is located right on the Oder-Neisse Cycle Route[dead link], a well-paved and signposted bike trail along the German-Polish border rivers. It is a 66-km ride from Görlitz, 61 km from Guben.

See[edit]
New Castle
 Fürst-Pückler-Park. Muskau's main attraction. With an area of 2050 acres, it is the largest English-style landscape garden in continental Europe. In 2004 it was listed as a World Heritage site. The park's creator, Prince Hermann von Pückler-Muskau, was keen on variety, his motto was "A park must be like an art gallery, every few steps you should see a new picture." Consequently, the park features copious meadows, majestic trees, curved paths, picturesque lakes and rivers, unique bridges and buildings. Especially characteristic are the park's surprising, long vistas. The park is open daily, all year, admission is free. 
Orangerie
The following sights are within the grounds:

 Old Castle. 
 New Castle (Neues Schloss). April–October 10:00-18:00. Reopened in 2012 after careful renovation. Houses the exhibition "Pückler! Catch him if you can?". Innovative, multi-faceted and comprehensive exposition on the erstwhile lord of the manor, Prince Hermann von Pückler-Muskau, dedicated to his different roles (ruler, adventurer, landscape artist, writer, bon vivant). With several interactive options (like a "love letter machine" that automatically writes a suitable love letter after you tweak some settings—Pückler has written thousands of letters, sometimes using recurring, only slightly varied text modules), lovingly designed animations and displays, short film scenes as well as little audio plays and texts recited by actors. While some of the stations might only unfold their whole allure if you have some knowledge of German language and culture, most of the texts are also available in English, and the activities are simply fun, no matter what language you speak. Admission €6, reduced €3. (updated Oct 2016)
historical palm and cactus house
Cavalier house, nowadays used as peat bath
Moorish-style Orangerie

Rakotz bridge at the Azalea and Rhododendron park Kromlau
51.5355614.636111 Azalea and Rhododendron park Kromlau (Azaleen- und Rhododendronpark) (6 km west of Bad Muskau; 300 m from the forest railway station Kromlau). A landscape garden of nearly 81 ha, created by landowner Friedrich Hermann Rötschke—a contemporary of Prince Hermann von Pückler—starting in 1844. He directed the planting of both domestic and exotic plants as well as the arranging of artificial rock formations and landscape sculptures (like caves, grottos, pyramids) made of basalt from Saxon Switzerland and Bohemia. After Count Egloffstein-Arklitten acquired the park in 1893, he hired landscape gardener Georg Eichler to redesign the park with rhododendrons and azalea that still dominate the park's flora. The park includes a 18th-century mansion and the very picturesque Rakotz bridge (colloquially called "devil's bridge").   (updated Apr 2017)

About 6000 boulders, witnesses of the ice age in Central Europe, that were in the way of the excavators' giant shovels, were collected and arranged here, surrounded by artificial hills and a variety of different plants, including rhododendrons, succulents, perennials and heather.
