Balbriggan (Baile Brigín) is a seaside town at the north end of County Dublin, 32 km north of Dublin city centre. It was a small fishing village until 1780 then grew rapidly as a textile town, processing cotton and linen. When John Wayne hollered at someone to put their balbriggans on, he meant long-johns, traditionally made here; Queen Victoria and the Czarina of Russia also wore them. 
This page also describes the villages of Skerries (not to be confused with Out Skerries in the Shetland Islands) and Rush, and the nearby islands, of which only Lambay is inhabited. 


Understand[edit]
"The village is resorted to in Summertime by several genteel people for the benefit of bathing" - 18th century travelogue
Baile Brigín may mean "Brecan's town", no-one knows. It was a tiny place until the fashion for sea-bathing began, but only grew rapidly from the 19th century as a textile town. The railway arrived in 1844. The main highway to Belfast came this way, so it was a bottleneck until 1998 when the M1 bypass was created. Balbriggan nowadays is a commuter town for Dublin. It is a possible base for exploring the city, but even more for sights just across the county boundary to the north and west such as Brú Na Bóinne Neolithic complex. Or at least it would be if it had more accommodation: there's more in Skerries 8 km south along the coast.
In 1994 County Dublin was divided into four, so these towns are now part of County Fingal. In 2022 the population of Balbriggan was 24,300, of Skerries 10,470, of Rush 11,100 and of Lusk 10,800.

See[edit]
Balbriggan Martello Tower
The Harbour is scenic. Across the bay, no stretch of Irish coastline would be complete without its Martello tower.
The Sack of Balbriggan is commemorated by a plaque on Bridge St. On 20 Sept 1920 during the Irish War of Independence, two police officers were shot dead in Smyth's Pub by the Irish Republican Army. In revenge, the Black and Tans raided the town that night, destroying a factory, 49 houses and four pubs, and two townsmen were beaten to death.
St George's Church was built in 1813. It's off Church St near the harbour.

Rush 8 km south of Skerries is another small harbour with a good beach where you often see racehorses training. Kenure church is a ruin at the north edge of town, while all that's left of Kenure House is a cod-Hellenistic portico, looking like a derelict NatWest bank.
Lusk 4 km inland from Rush has a 10th-century Round Tower, incorporated into a Norman-style 15th century church.

 Brú Na Bóinne is a remarkable collection of Neolithic chamber tombs 8 km west of Drogheda. It's a 15 min drive from Balbriggan but you must book, and you must head for the visitor centre south of the River Boyne (M1 exit 9). There's no direct access to the tombs, so don't follow directions to Newgrange Farm.
