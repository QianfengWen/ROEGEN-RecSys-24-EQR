Not to be confused with Carbost, the source of Talisker whisky
Colbost (Gaelic: Cealabost) is the first of a straggle of tiny settlements on the Duirnish Peninsula in the northwest of Skye. The others are Totaig, Glendale, Lephin and Milovaig, then the road dead-ends. Cealabost probably means "cold farm"; it also translates as "farm of the rounded tops" but the hills hereabouts are abrupt scarps, great scenery.

Get around[edit]
You need wheels for this strung-out area. A car shelters you from the rain, buffeting breeze and midges.

See[edit]
57.4241-6.59671 Dun Osdale is the heather-clad outcrop you pass without noticing on the road to the village - it's actually an Iron Age broch. See Dunvegan for points further east.
57.4463-6.652 Colbost Folk Museum, Colbost IV55 8ZT, ☏ +44 1470 521296. Closed. This 19th-century crofter's heather-thatched blackhouse has suffered storm damage and is closed for repair. (updated Jun 2024)
Dun Colbost is another broch on the hill west of the Folk Museum.
57.4498-6.72243 Glendale Corn Mill has seen better days. It's an 18th-century overshot waterwheel with 19th-century millhouse, and was restored in the 1970s. But the thatched roof caved in and was replaced by corrugated metal, the machinery has been removed and it's no longer open as a museum. Still you can look in and shine a torch around, and give the mice something to talk about.
57.4233-6.788114 Neist Point Lighthouse is a 62 ft / 19 m tower built in 1909 and automated in 1990. It's a half-mile walk from the road end, along a well-paved but initially steep path. A longer walk leads to the Point.
57.3346-6.58065 MacLeod's Maidens are sea-stacks, a five-mile hike from the road, see Dunvegan.
Do[edit]
Wildlife: always be watching, especially close to shore.
Macleod's Tables: see Dunvegan#Do for the hike to these plateaux.

Cafe Lephin on the road to Milovaig is licensed. It's open M-F 10:30AM-4PM.
Drink[edit]
There's no pub or off-licence here, and the illicit still was another casualty of the storm that damaged the museum.
Talisker, remember, is the fluid that doesn't come from Colbost but from Carbost. This and other whiskies are widely available but byob.
