Seward Alaska aerial view
Seward ("SOO-word") is a small port city (population ~2,700) located at the head of Resurrection Bay on the Kenai Peninsula in Southcentral Alaska. Seward was named in honor of William H. Seward, President Abraham Lincoln's Secretary of State, who was responsible for negotiating the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867.


Understand[edit]
Founded in 1903 as the ocean terminus of what is now the Alaska Railroad, Seward prides itself, not only on its natural beauty, but as Alaska's only deep-water, ice-free port with rail, highway and air transportation to Alaska's interior and major urban population centers.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Seward is located 127 road miles south of Anchorage.  The Seward Highway is a very scenic 2.5-hour drive from Anchorage to Seward, but can be slow in peak summer.
In 2017, the Alaska Department of Transportation announced a Milepost 75-90 Rehabilitation Project to make major safety improvements to a busy crash-prone section of the Seward Highway from Girdwood to beyond the Portage curve toward Turnagain Pass. In July 2015 a tour bus crash at Milepost 79 (Portage Glacier Road and Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center) killed one man and critically injured several others, causing a 10-hour traffic jam. During the summer months, up to 15,000 vehicles use this 15-mile stretch of Seward Highway daily.  

By train[edit]
The Alaska Railroad offers daily rail passage between Anchorage and Seward in the summer, May 13 to Sept 14. The trip between Anchorage and Seward -- the Coastal Classic -- is arguably its most scenic section, and you can take the train one-way. The train parallels the Seward Highway along the Turnagain Arm, but also heads up into the mountains away from the road, pass glaciers and alpine meadows you won't be able to see by car.  Adventure Class (with shared access to older vista dome railcar) Round Trip/One Way fare: $178/$105 adults, $89/$53 children (2-11); GoldStar Service (New Dome Railcar) Round Trip/One Way fare: $363/$213 adults, $215/$126 children.
Passengers are required by TSA to check-in at the ticket window (an hour before at Anchorage, 30-45 minutes before at Seward) and show a government issued photo ID (for those age 18 and older) to receive boarding passes. If you have luggage (2 pieces max), it must be checked through to your destination.  At depots, boarding for trains occurs 20-30 minutes prior to the scheduled departure.

By bus[edit]

By ship[edit]
The Dale R. Lindsey Alaska Railroad Seward Intermodal Terminal ("cruise-ship dock" to locals), 913 Port Ave, is where cruise ships moor.  Ships tie up directly to the dock, and no tenders are used to transport guests between the ship and shore.  The Alaska Railroad uses this facility for freight.
From May to September, about 50 ships arrive and depart Seward's port as part of the popular 7-14 day Alaska cruises, round-the-world itineraries, and special charter cruises.
The ferries of Alaska Marine Highway call at Whittier, from where you should be able to take a train (or drive).
