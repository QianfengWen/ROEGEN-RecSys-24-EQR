This article covers the rural area around Tweed, Ontario, Canada. For the town in Northumberland UK see Berwick-upon-Tweed, for the town in Australia see Tweed Heads.
Tweed and the Land 'o Lakes region of Ontario cover a large, primarily-rural area north of Napanee-Belleville in Quinte-Northumberland. This is a sparsely-populated area with multiple small villages, farms, lakes for fishing and snowmobile/ATV trails.


Understand[edit]
This page covers multiple small villages including Madoc, Marmora and Tweed. See also Stirling and Shannonville in Belleville's article.
Tweed is a village with a population of 1,700 in 2016 is near the junction of the Black River and the Moira River. The Ontario Powder Company made dynamite locally (with sometimes disastrous results) until a takeover by the Canadian Explosives Company in 1910; only ruins of the original factory remain. A Canadian Pacific rail line (built 1880s, removed 1987) once led to Smiths Falls; the Bay of Quinte Railway line was removed in the early 1940s.
Stoco Lake, on the Moira River directly north of Sugar Island, is popular among sport fishers for muskellunge (Muskie, esox masquinongy), trout, pike, walleye, large mouth and small mouth bass, as well as ice fishing in winter. The Moira River (and fisheries management zone 18) ends at Lake Ontario in Belleville.
