Get around[edit]
See[edit]
Matriz de Santo Antônio
 Capela Nossa Senhora Mãe dos Homens, near the Conselheiro Lafaiete exit on the Estrada Real. This small, simply-designed chapel was built in the middle of the 19th century. 
The architectural and landscape complex of Capela de Santana and the main house of Fazenda Pé do Morro are 4 km outside of town at the foot of the Ouro Branco mountain range and on the banks of the Estrada Real. The origin of the place dates back to the 18th century, and it is recognized for its heritage value.
 Casa de Tiradentes, Carreiras. This somewhat misnamed construction was never the residence of Tiradentes nor a meeting place of the inconfidentes, but rather a lodge used by imperial troops during the mid-18th century. 
 Igreja de Santo Antônio, Itatiaia. The first church here was built  before 1714. It was destroyed and reconstructed in 1761, but was never fully completed. It houses a number of precious paintings, some of possible Portuguese origin. 
 Matriz de Santo Antônio. It is uncertain when construction began on this church, but it is one of the oldest in the state, in use by 1717 and probably finished in 1779. The gold-covered altars are fine examples of baroque style, and several of the paintings done by Ataíde here are fantastic.
