Kengtung (Cheingtung, Chiang Tung, Kengtong, Kyaingtong) is a town in Shan State, Eastern Myanmar.

Isolated from the rest of Myanmar, Kengtung is a hotspot of cultural diversity. Close to the Thai and Chinese borders, Kengtung has been at a crossroads in terms of Southeast Asian trade for a very long time.
Being in the heart of the opium-growing Golden Triangle, Kengtung used to be off-limits for foreigners. The ceasefire between the rebels and government has opened up the town and valley to the rest of world.
