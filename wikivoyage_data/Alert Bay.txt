Alert Bay is a small town of 449 people (2021) on Cormorant Island, off the east coast of  northern Vancouver Island, British Columbia.


Understand[edit]
Alert Bay has a long history as a centre of First Nations (Aboriginal) culture. It is in traditional Kwakwaka'wakw territory. More than half of the present residents are First Nations, from 'Namgis First Nation and other nations. More than half the island is reserve land.

Derelict Fish Plant
A decaying building glowered from a small hill to the north of town for many decades, before being demolished in 2015. It was St Michael's School, the primary residential school for the region. It is a physical reminder of the program of cultural eradication practiced by Canada for many decades, causing trauma and anguish for generations of First Nations people. Confronting the legacy of residential schools has been a major part of reconciliation between Canada and First Nations in the first decades of the 21st century.
Several Alert Bay attractions draw from the First Nations cultural history. Others draw from the scenic beauty and the water life.
