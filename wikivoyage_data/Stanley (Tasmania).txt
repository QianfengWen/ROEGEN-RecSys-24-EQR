The view of Stanley from a distance with The Nut clearly visible
Stanley is located in the northwestern part of Tasmania. According to the 2016 census, Stanley had a population of 553. It's perhaps best known for The Nut, a 143-metre-high volcanic plug by the coast that's viewable from almost every part of town.

By car[edit]
The only way to get into Stanley is by car. The nearest major city is Burnie, and give yourself 3 hours to get to Stanley if you want to see the amazing beaches, capes and bluffs along Tasmania's north coast, also known as The Great Nature Trail. If you do not stop along the way, then the drive takes a little over an hour from Burnie via the Bass Highway (A2) and Stanley Highway (B21).

Get around[edit]
See[edit]
-40.763574145.3031511 The Nut State Reserve, The Nut Summit Cct. The main attraction of Stanley and a flat-top volcanic plug with views of the town and Rocky Cape National Park. The Nut can be viewed from all over Stanley. (updated Jan 2022)
-40.7593145.29882 Little Penguin Viewing Area, Harrison Tce. Northwest Tasmania is home to many little fairy penguins, and if you happen to be in Stanley just after dark, you may be able to spot them. They may be loud at night, hosting a penguin party, but they're often hidden beneath rocks. Remember, don't take flash photography or use a flashlight – it can blind their eyesight. If anything, use a red torch to avoid damaging their eyesight. (updated Feb 2023)
-40.7747145.27943 Trethewies Lookout, Stanley Hwy (B21). The entry point of Stanley makes a good photo spot of The Nut. (updated Feb 2023)
-40.7481145.29244 Highfield Historic Site, 143 Green Hills Rd, ☏ +61 3 6458 1100. Daily 9:30AM–4:30PM. A relic of colonial architecture from the Regency Period.

(updated Feb 2023)
Do[edit]
Take a chairlift up to the Nut for stunning views of Stanley and its surroundings. Look out into the blue waters of the Bass Strait.
Once you're up the chairlife, The Nut Walk is a 4.6-kilometer circuit that takes about an hour to bushwalk. The walk includes various lookouts – each give different views at different points, whether it's the rocky cape of Rocky Cape NP, farmland, beaches, or woodland. If you want to bushwalk around The Nut without having to use the chairlift, access is via The Nut Zig Zag Track, which is steep to an extent, but not as steep as some of Tasmania's other popular bushwalks.

Good base from which to explore the Tarkine Forests, and the Edge of the World coast-line.

Souvenirs are available in the visitor centre of The Nut.
