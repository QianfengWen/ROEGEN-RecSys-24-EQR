Morrisburg is a village of a little over a thousand people in the Seaway Region of eastern Ontario between Brockville/Prescott and Cornwall. 


Understand[edit]
Upper Canada Village
This region is United Empire Loyalist country, much of it colonised by loyal British subjects in 1784, immediately after the American Revolution. The Battle of Crysler's Farm, an 1813 British-Canadian victory during the War of 1812, was fought in this area to preserve British control of the St. Lawrence River for shipping.
The McIntosh apple originated in this region, near Williamsburg. The construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1958 flooded and destroyed several small villages between Morrisburg and Cornwall; the largest of these Lost Villages were Aultsville and Moulinette. Some historic buildings and structures from the affected region were relocated to Upper Canada Village, a pioneer village and living museum along the St. Lawrence in Morrisburg.
As of 1998, Morrisburg is no longer an incorporated municipality and local highways 2 and 31 have been downloaded as county roads.
