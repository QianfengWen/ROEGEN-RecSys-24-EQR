Malinalco is a fascinating small town in Mexico State that is a popular weekend destination for people from Mexico City and Cuernavaca. It is a very old community famous for its Aztec temples, its colonial era small town feel with several historic churches, its natural scenery with mountains and valleys, and for the nearby village of Chalma with its church that houses a famous "black christ" figure that is a magnet for religious pilgrims and those seeking divine intervention. Malinalco is known for its shamans and a reputation for black magic. The town is one of Mexico's designated Pueblos Mágicos.

Malinalco is ancient. Archaeologists have found potsherds and signs of human occupation dating back to 1800 BC, but the area was sparsely populated until the Classic area (roughly around the 10th century). The archaeological site at Malinalco is quite young by Mexican standards, focusing on Aztec constructions from the late 15th century right up until the day the Spaniards marched in and informed the local indigenous population that they now had the honor of serving the Spanish crown. The Aztec structures were built to honor the eagle warriors and jaguar warriors.
Aztec mythology says that Malinalco was settled when a nomadic tribe stumbled into an argument between the god Huitzilopochtil and his sister Malinalxochitl. Huitzilopochtil was irritated with his sister, so in the middle of the night, he left the encampment along with most of the nomadic people. In the morning, Malinalxochitl discovered that she'd been abandoned with the smaller group of nomads. These people became known as the Matlazlincans, who then occupied the land. 

Capilla de San Pedro is one of several 16th century Augustinian churches in Malinalco
Historically, groups of Toltec and Otomi moved into the area at various points in history. There is evidence they paid tribute to Tula, and in 1476, they were conquered by the Aztec army of Axayacatl. The Aztec dominated the region until the conquest.
Although different religious orders were present in Malinalco at various points in the colonial era, the enduring imprint was made by the Augustinians who evangelized the community beginning in 1537 and who built a large convent and several smaller churches and chapels in Malinalco and its surrounding villages. The most significant of these churches are the Church of the Divine Savior in the town of Malinalco and the Sanctuary of Chalma.
The town is situated in a river valley, giving it a sense of isolation. Just over 6,500 people live in the town of Malinalco (2015), with several thousand more in nearby villages.

Walkway in the cloisters at the Convento Agustino del Divino Salvador
18.951917-99.4979371 Zocalo (Kiosko Malinalco). One of two central squares in Malinalco, this one featuring the bandstand/kiosk. Pleasant park for strolling, relaxing and people watching. 
18.951141-99.4973062 Parroquia del Divino Salvador (Church of the Divine Savior, Convento Agustino del Transfiguracion), Esq. De Progreso e Hidalgo, Centro. Historic 16th-century church built by the Augustinians between 1540 and 1580. Adjacent to church is the Convento de Augustino Transfiguracion. Both the main church and the convent reflect rennaissance style and are known for their frescos, painted by various artists over a period of several decades. Flemish artist Simón Pereyns painted some of the frescoes in the late 1560s. In the convent, the Augustinians enlisted indigenous artists known as Tlacuilos who painted many of the frescoes and mediterranean designs in the architectural detail. Parts of the church were damaged by an earthquake in 2017 and are frequently closed off for renovation. 
Aztec temple to warriors at Malinalco (Building 1)
18.956626-99.5063483 Malinalco Archaeological Zone (Cuauhtinchan, Cerro de los Idolos), Amajac, Barrio Santa Monica, ☏ +52 714 147 3103. 10:00 - 15:00 (closed M). The ruins of Malinalco seem to be carved into the cliffside, giving it a dramatic feel and natural setting. The site features six structures built in the late 15th century and early 16th century. The most famous are two temples, honoring the eagle warriors and the jaguar warriors. Malinalco was a sanctuary for Aztec warriors and was used for secret ceremonies and rituals involving high priests and probably the emperor himself. The most impressive structure is Building 1, which was carved directly into the mountain's stone walls (including the sculptures). The main staircase is flanked by jaguar sculptures and a third is in the middle of the steps (all three scultpures are badly eroded after 5 centuries of neglect and exposure to the elements). The temple doorway is carved as a snake mouth with jaws gaping open through which you walk. Additional eagle and jaguar sculptures are inside the temple. All that remains of Building 2 is a raised platform. The stones used to construct the building were plundered by the Augustinian friars in the 16th century for use in building their convent. Building 3 was also carved into the rock of the mountain and is said to have been decorated with murals, which have degraded over the centuries to the point that there is little sign of any previous artwork. Building 4 is the northernmost building at the site and you can enter it by climbing a short set of stairs. Inside is a sunken altar. The site also includes an area of pre-Aztec ruins, though the area is closed to all but archaeologists with permits from INAH. A site museum (called Museo Universitario Dr. Luis Mario Schneider) is a modern, inviting facility that documents and explains the history of Malinalco and its ruins, with a number of relics on display that were excavated during several digs in the 20th and 21st centuries. M$85. 
Main altar of the Sanctuary of Chalma
18.933577-99.4344494 Sanctuary of Chalma (Santuario: El Señor de Chalma), Independencia, Chalma. This is one of the coolest old churches in Mexico and not just because its stunningly beautiful (which it is), but because of the cultural value behind it. Long before the Spanish invaded Mexico, and long before the Aztecs had invaded Malinalco, the indigenous population worshiped an idol of the god Oxtoteotl in the caves of Chalma. When the Augustinian friars came in and started evangelizing the native population they were going to destroy the idol, but found that it had been miraculously converted to a Christ figure and that the indigenous people would worship that just they had the idol in its previous incarnation. Locals took it as a miracle, and the Augustinians were just happy to have them worshiping Christ instead of an indigenous god. Today, the "black Christ" idol is displayed prominently inside the sanctuary, which is an active church maintained by the Diocese of Tenancingo. The church also holds a famous sculpture of the archangel Michael and a painting of the Virgin of Guadalupe. A pavilion outside the church is used for traditional dancers. There is also a spring where pilgims cleanse themselves in the healing waters and a room filled with retablos, testaments as to miracles granted after praying to the black christ of Chalma. The church is hugely popular and famous across Mexico. It claims to be the second-most visited shrine in Mexico (after the Basilica of Guadalupe in Mexico City). A small village has grown up around the sanctuary for locals who make their living serving the pilgrim and tourist crowds (vendors, innkeepers, etc.), but crowds during Holy Week far outstrip the resources of the small community with an estimated 50,000 visitors vying to crowd into the small church.
