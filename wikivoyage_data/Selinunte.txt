Selinunte (full name Marinella di Selinunte) is a district of the village Castelvetrano on the south coast of Sicily, Italy. It is most famous for the neighbouring ruins of the Greek city of Selinus in the archeological park Selinunte (italian: Parco archeologico Selinunte). This park is a main tourist attraction in this region.


Understand[edit]
Selinunte was founded around 700 BC by colonists from the Greek city Megara (an independent city-state 35 km from Athens). Around 580 BC a conflict broke out with the native Elymians from Segesta. To obtain support the Greeks of Selinunte entered into a covenant with Carthage and later with Syracuse. Even in times of peace a smoldering conflict remained with Segesta. In 415 BC Segesta persuaded Athenians to send an expedition, however this did not result into a clash with Selinunte. In 409 BC expelled Carthaginians landed from Motya at Marsala and warred against Selinunte. They took over the city after a ten-day siege. The displaced residents returned after the demolition of the city walls and entered into a covenant with the Carthaginians. As an ally of the Carthaginians the city regained power and grandeur. Around 250 BC, after the first Punic war against the Romans, the Carthaginians destroyed the city and retreated to Lilybaeum. Selinunte was never rebuilt and matured over the centuries to ruins. In the 19th century the ruins of the city were barely recognizable. In the 20th century, the temples on the eastern hill were excavated. In 1950 temple E was reconstructed on a controversial manner and the excavations of the Acropolis were started.

Get around[edit]
The archaeological site of Selinunte is divided in several parts. The eastern hill area with the temples E, F and G. One kilometer further at sea the ruins of the old walled city with the Acropolis and temples A, B, C, D and O. Further west lies the shrine Malaphoros with a Necropolis. In the north part is a large Necropolis.  All areas are connected with walking trails, however you can take the tourist train (Trenino) for €3 per stop, or €12 for the full tour (Nov 2019). Because it can be very hot, it is advisable to go as early as possible as there is little shade. Wear good walking shoes and take plenty of water. The park is at its best in spring with flower fields and with far fewer tourists than during high season. Opposite the entrance of the park you can buy soft drinks and sandwiches. At the East Hill and near the Acropolis are toilets.
