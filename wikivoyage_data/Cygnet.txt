Cygnet is a small town in the Huon Valley region of Southern Tasmania, of population 839. It is nessled in an apple and berry growing district, a short distance from the Huon river, amongst ungulating hills and valleys.
The township has a burgeoning artistic community and a number of excellent cafes, restaurants and galleries. There is much local agricultural produce that can be procured from the side of the road and forms a theme through the local cuisine. The best produce, food and art is best found by asking one of the many friendly locals or shopkeepers. This is a town with an old fashioned small town ethos with a unique Tasmanian fusion of art and agrarianism.

Cygnet is a 56-km (50-minute) drive south-west from Hobart. The township is within an hour from the Hartz mountains national park and many other local towns. An irregular bus service to Huonville is run by Tassielink.
