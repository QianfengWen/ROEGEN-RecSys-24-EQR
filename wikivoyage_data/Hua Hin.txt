Hua Hin (หัวหิน) is a seaside resort city of about 50,000 residents (2012) in Thailand. Three or four hours south of Bangkok (195 km), it is popular with middle-aged and older foreign visitors, as a weekend getaway spot for Bangkok Thais, and as an expat retirement home.


Understand[edit]
Hua Hin Beach, Hilton Hotel in the background
Popularised as a resort in the early 1920s by King Prajadhipok, Hua Hin is closely associated with the Thai royal family and is a quiet and relaxing seaside resort ideal for family vacation. Until 1934, it was known as Samore Riang (สมอเรียง), or 'rows of rocks'.
The fishing village was turned into a royal resort and consequently became popular among Siam's nobility and upper classes. In 1928, Prajadhipok built his Klai Kangwon ('far from worries') Palace. As of 2020, Klai Kangwon is a little-used summer residence of the king and is not open for visitors, although the outer palace grounds are open for walkers and joggers from 16:00 to 19:00 daily (wear shoes, have sleeved shirts that cover at least your upper arms and bring your passport).
The six kilometre-long beach is pretty and relatively clean, more so than Pattaya's, and the cleanliness of the sea is rated "fair". Most of the beach can completely disappear along certain parts of the coast during high tide. Besides just sunbathing, snorkelling and swimming, visitors can also enjoy golf, spas, caves, peaks, waterfalls, shops, seafood, and nearby national parks. The town is clean, friendly, and laid-back, making it ideal for families and couples.
Tourist information can be found from the corner of Petchkasem Rd and Damnerkasem Rd (Soi 76), quite close to the railway station.
There is also a tourist information centre near the clock tower in the centre of town, which is right next to a Starbucks for those of you requiring a caffeine fix. This is also where many minivans stop to offload and pick up passengers, even though it is not the official bus station, and consequently is an easy place to find a motorcycle taxi or tuk-tuk.
The town of Hua Hin cannot be called scenic. Aside from the beach, the grounds of posh hotels, and the several blocks west of the Hilton Hotel, there is no place to stroll in Hua Hin. The town lacks a central square or focal point. Like most Thai towns, Hua Hin is a nightmare for pedestrians and impossible for those with physical disabilities, the blind, and wheelchair users. Signage and other obstacles impede sidewalks, where there are sidewalks, every few metres. Phetkasem Road, which divides the town into two halves, is a virtual racetrack, with few concessions like crosswalks for those on foot or bicycle lanes for cyclists.

Orientation[edit]
Clock tower (หอนาฬิกา), central Hua Hin
Hua Hin has no real "centre". A nondescript clock tower on Phetkasem Road serves as a de facto transportation hub, where minivans from the north arrive and minivans to the south depart. The tower is just north of Soi 61.
Phetkasem Road bisects the town, leading to Cha-am in the north and Prachuap Khiri Khan in the south. Roads perpendicular to Phetkasem on the inland side are even-numbered sois. Those on the sea-side are odd-numbered. The numbers do not match up across Phetkasem. For example, Soi 61 leads to the central seaside area around the Hilton Hotel. The same street on the other side of Phetkasem is Soi 76. It leads to the railway station. At the northeast corner of the Soi 61/Soi 76 intersection you will find the tourist information centre. Behind it is the central police station. Across the street from the police station is a post office. Continuing down Soi 61 to the beach is the office of the Tourist Police.

Climate[edit]
Hua Hin has a tropical climate with high humidity and occasional rain. It is typically pleasant however, and can be enjoyed year round. Generally, the best time of the year to visit Hua Hin is in the cool season from November to February, but for those who like it hot, then the hot season is from March to May (when the temperature can well exceed 30 °C (86 °F)). The rainy season (although it doesn't rain every day) is from June to October with September being the rainiest of all. The rain in Thailand usually comes in short sharp bursts. It doesn't usually drizzle for long periods of time.

Environment[edit]
The quality of the waters of the Gulf of Thailand off central Hua Hin were rated "fair" in 2015 by the Pollution Control Department. But, the report noted that "... the main tourism areas, namely Cha–Am Beach... and Hua Hin Beach... should be consistently monitored, since enterococci (fecal) bacteria levels exceeded the standard...."
One of the first things a visitor to Hua Hin notices is the blizzard of signage. Evidently anyone can put up a sign. Hotels and other commercial enterprises design their signs to look like official signage. They and every other type of sign imaginable degrade the environment and contribute to its ugliness. Town officials do not enforce existing sign ordinances.
Signage is  Thai nightmare, however Thais do not object. Every sign  poster is actually approved  by the local authority and a fee is paid per day.

Beach in Hua Hin
There is only one, long beach: Hua Hin Beach (ชายหาดหัวหิน Hat Hua Hin). This runs from the Hilton Hotel six kilometres south to a headland where a Buddhist temple clings to the rocks. Fine white sand, resort hotels and many water sports opportunities lend the resort its distinctive ambiance. At the south end of town, the hill of Khao Takiab interrupts the beach. On the other side is a lovely swimming beach with a view of Khao Takiab's south face. Just a little further on, Suan Son Beach is owned by the Thai army but is open to the public. Notable for the tropical sea pines lining the shore.
Parts of the beach closer to the town may have greenish water, in this case continue walking down the beach where the water appears cleaner. There is an ample supply of deck chairs along the beach, although many places charge around 100 baht for their hire. Deck chairs that are part of a beachside cafe may be free, on the assumption that you will buy food or drink.
Some entrances to the beach are controlled by hotels—what looks like a road to the beach on a map might really be a hotel's private driveway.

Massage[edit]
Thai massage shops aim mostly at extracting money from your wallet. Claims for its holistic health benefits by enhancing physical, emotional, and spiritual states are mostly hogwash. The majority of massage places are fairly dumpy except at the high end, do not have soothing background music, nor the scent of Asian incense. The exceptions are high-end and expensive.
There are over 200 massage shops in Hua Hin. Most have identical prices. Most hotels in Hua Hin offer massage services.

Hua Hin is known for its seafood which can be found in abundance at the night market, restaurants, and hotel restaurants. Naresdamri Road is a fine place for great inexpensive restaurants while serving up romantic sea views. Some hotels offer buffets consisting of open cooking stations, including seafood BBQ, and also offer live entertainment like traditional Thai music and dancing.
Surprisingly, in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic in spring 2021, Soi 94 has bloomed into a happening street with many restaurants and bars of all types. 
This area is the site of the Hua Hin Fishing Harbour and in the early morning, seafood can be purchased (its provenance is unknown as the Gulf of Thailand is increasingly fished out).
Moreover, there are numerous dining spots serving Western, Indian, and Japanese food.
Three Hua Hin Italian restaurants, Andreas, Da Mario, and La Grappa, were named in the 2020 edition of the Guidebook to Italian Cuisine, having passed rigorous testing by Italy's tourism bureau. They use 100% Italian ingredients and recipes.

Renting a house for a long stay[edit]
If you're staying for a month or more, then Hua Hin has great options. The price for renting a nice villa with private pool can be as low as 20,000 baht. Houses have modern furniture and are ready to move into. Best way to find a house is to go to realty agencies around the Hilton Hotel. They pick you up from your hotel and show options for your budget and taste. Best strategy is to contact by them email a week before, so they will make a selection beforehand.

Cope[edit]
It would seem that if you are not Thai, you are viewed by the Thai police as a walking ATM. Should a cop be short of beer money and see you not wearing a helmet while on a motorbike, you are likely to be stopped and shaken down for cash. The police box at the SE corner of Soi 61 and Phetkasem Road seems to be where they send officers who are short of cash. The cop on duty will often signal farang to the roadside for some infraction, often trumped up, or for a sobriety test. Most of the time, you will pay cash on the spot, 200 baht and up, to be allowed to go on your way. Another danger spot is Phetkasem Road between Sois 67 and 69. There is a pedestrian bridge across the road there that affords the cops some shade, plus a Family Mart so that they are never short of cold drinks. At this spot they stop all vehicles, usually in late morning, to check for driver's licenses or proof of rental or passports or whatever else they need to have you pay on the spot. The good news is that this roadblock does not operate when it is too hot, rainy, on weekends or at hours requiring the payment of overtime.

Medical and dental[edit]
Perhaps due to the population of aged foreigners, there are two large private hospitals in Hua Hin, both on Phetkasem Road. Medical and dental clinics are not hard to find on the main road also.

12.55484799.96083822 Bangkok Hospital Hua Hin, 888 Petchkasem Rd (Just S of Soi 94/1, inland side of Phetkasem), ☏ +66 32 616-800. 24/7.

12.55219899.96178126 Nana Dental Clinic, 256/6-7 Soi Hua Hin 94/3 (Just off the inland side of Phetkasem Rd, S of Bangkok Hospital), ☏ +66 99 145 9949, nanadentalclinic@gmail.com. M-Sa, 09:30-19:00.

Reading matter[edit]
There are a number of English-language publications, offering a variety of styles, as well as information and entertainment. Long-time visitors to the town will have been familiar with the free monthly Hua Hin Observer magazine found around the town, but in Jan 2010, this became an on-line-only publication. Another monthly publication is the Hua Hin Today newspaper which can be a little dry for tourists, as it contains plenty of local government and local dignitaries news along with details of the latest infrastructure projects and housing developments. Its on-line presence is more of a portal for international news and selling property than a local site.
There are a number of other printed publications and Internet sites relating to Hua Hin, but they are mostly concerned with selling or renting property, or promoting another local business. There are also a couple of non-English language publications with a small distribution.

Recycling electronics[edit]
 Bluport Shopping Mall (Ground floor, parking garage, outside food court, SW corner of building). A kiosk outside Bluport in the parking garage accepts batteries, light bulbs, cell phones, fluorescent tubes, aerosol containers. Next to it is a bin for soi dog food donations. Free. (updated Oct 2019)
Surveillance[edit]
Thailand is rapidly becoming a surveillance state. CCTV cameras are being installed at a rapid pace. To send a package, purchase a bus ticket, SIM card, or hotel room you will need to produce a passport. As of October 2019 coffee shops are required to keep a log of all web browsing done on their premises for 90 days.
