Understand[edit]
Deborah Sampson was born in Plympton in 1760. She dressed as a man and fought in the Revolutionary War. When her leg was injured, she tended to it herself so her gender was not discovered. Later, the leg became infected and she was hospitalized. Her gender was discovered and she was honorably discharged.
