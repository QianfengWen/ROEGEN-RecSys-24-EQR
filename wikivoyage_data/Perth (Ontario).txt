Perth is a small, historic town in eastern Ontario, Canada, home to around 6,500 people (2021).


Understand[edit]
Perth, Ontario
Established as a military settlement in 1816, Perth-upon-Tay was first settled by military veterans of the War of 1812 as the seat of Lanark County. The Scottish, Irish and European stonemasons who constructed the Rideau Canal (opened 1832, Kingston to Ottawa) built many local historic stone buildings which have been preserved in their original condition or carefully restored.
The seven "Marks Brothers", Canadian kings of theatrical repertoire who toured North America from the 1870s-1920s, hailed from Christie Lake just outside of Perth. The Balderson Theatre building at 12 Gore Street East (still standing, now a furniture store) was the largest theatre between Montreal and Toronto in its time; the brothers were called (Maclean’s Magazine, 1958) "the most remarkable theatrical family in Canadian history. The dazzling Marks Brothers were the greatest impresario performers of our small town stage in the era before the nickelodeon."


The two-century-old downtown huddles around the Tay Basin, the end-point of the Tay Canal that connects Perth into the Rideau Canal system. Large boats arriving from the Rideau via the Tay Canal will get no further than the Last Duel Campground due to very low bridges between the campground and the Tay Basin but smaller boats, canoes and kayaks should be able to navigate under these bridges to the Tay Basin in downtown Perth.
Local arts and crafts can be found throughout the town. Paintings, prints and art cards of Nostalgic Realism artist Craig Campbell (available at many downtown stores) are internationally known for their nostalgic portrayal of the steam train era.
The town is named for Perth (Scotland), one of its two sister cities, which is built on a Tay River. County Lanark is also named for a Scottish town Lanark (from the Cumbric Lanerc meaning "clear space, glade") in the former Lanarkshire.
