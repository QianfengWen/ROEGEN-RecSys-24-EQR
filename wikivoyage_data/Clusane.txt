Clusane is a small village of 2,000 inhabitants along the south part of Lake Iseo, in Iseo municipality. It is a village of Franciacorta, a region well known for its wine, especially red and sparkling wine: around the village you can see many vineyards and if you came on late August/September you'll see the grape harvest (and if you want, you can contact a wine producer to take part in the harvest).


Understand[edit]
Clusane - panorama
Clusane has been a fishing village since the 18th century. Its countryside is cultivated with cereals, vineyards, mulberries, olive trees and fruit trees .
The eastern and northern slopes of Monte Alto are rich in woods, olive groves, and meadows.
Clusane is also known as "the village of the roasted tench" (in Italian: paese della Tinca al Forno) because of its famous dish: the roasted tench (a variety of fish from the lake).

History[edit]
The village was founded during the Bronze Age as many ruins of old palafittes can confirm. During the Roman Age a bath was built, and you can see some ruins of this in the eastern part of the lakefront (Lungolago Capponi).
In the early Middle Ages, two monks who belonged to the family of Cluniac monks, were sent to Clusane and founded a priory there. The monks led the land reclamation works, to drain the predominantly marshy land, and they built some agricultural organizations.
In the Cluniac monastery (now Castello Carmagnola), the historic centre of Clusane was formed. The old church, which has now been deconsecrated, has become a small theatre.
