Warwick Parish is one of the one parishes in Bermuda. The parish is in the centre-south of Bermuda, occupying part of the main island to the southeast of the Great Sound. Also in the parish are Darrell's Island, Hawkins Island, Long Island, and Marshall's Island.


Understand[edit]

It is named after Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick (1587-1658).
It is located in the central south of the island chain, occupying part of the main island to the southeast of the Great Sound, the large expanse of water which dominates the geography of western Bermuda, and also a number of islands which lie within that sound.  It had a population of 9,000 in 2016.
Natural features in Warwick include Warwick Long Bay, Riddell's Bay, Darrell's Island, Hawkins Island, Long Island, and Marshall's Island. Hinson's Island, once part of Warwick, is now part of Paget Parish.
The parish also contains Warwick Camp, the former rifle ranges of the Imperial military garrison, which is, today, the home of the Bermuda Regiment, and most of which doubles as parkland (and the territory of which includes Warwick Long Bay, Horseshoe Bay, and the smaller beaches between).
