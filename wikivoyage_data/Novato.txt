Novato is a sprawling suburb in Marin County in the San Francisco Bay Area of California. Novato is in the transition zone between the patchwork of suburban Marin County towns, long oriented towards San Francisco and the bay, and the wineries and pastureland of Sonoma County to the north.


Get in[edit]
Map of Novato


By car[edit]
Via Highway 101, the major north-south freeway or from Highway 37 which crosses marshland from Vallejo and Highway 80 or from west Marin on Hicks Valley Road/Novato Blvd.

By bus[edit]
Marin Transit offers service from other Marin County cities, and the affiliated service Golden Gate Transit goes north to Sonoma County and south to San Francisco.

By train[edit]
Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit, or SMART, connects Novato with San Rafael, Larkspur, and places in Sonoma County: Petaluma, Rohnert Park, Santa Rosa, and Sonoma County Airport. The Larkspur station allows connections to the Golden Gate Ferry to San Francisco.
SMART has three stations in Novato:

38.1063-122.56471 Novato Downtown station. Right downtown, a short walk from various restaurants and shops.   (updated Nov 2023)
38.0563-122.52392 Novato Hamilton station. Close to the Marin Museum of Contemporary Art and nature walks in the nearby wetlands.   (updated Nov 2023)
38.1208-122.56613 Novato San Marin station. Close to nothing in particular, though it is within walking distance of Rush Creek Open Space Preserve.   (updated Nov 2023)
Get around[edit]
Novato has tried to manufacture a "cute historic downtown" feel but alas it has not quite been successful. The small downtown area is very walkable and nicer than an outdoor mall, but it lacks the character and organic liveliness of downtown San Rafael, Petaluma, or even Larkspur.
Outside of downtown, Novato is a car-oriented community with inconsistent sidewalks and large distances.

By bike[edit]
Conditions may be too windy for bicycles to go "upwind."

By bus[edit]
There is limited Marin Transit (bus) service, which is primarily used by commuters. The bus serves a major stop "downtown" on Old Redwood Highway.
