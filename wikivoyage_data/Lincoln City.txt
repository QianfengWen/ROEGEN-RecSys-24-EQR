Lincoln City is a town of 9,800 people (2020) on the Central Oregon Coast. Visitors come for the casino, or to fly a kite. The city is known by some as the "Kite Capital of the World", and hosts two kite festivals each year.


Get in[edit]
Lincoln City is approximately 2 hours southwest of Portland. There are two ways to get to Lincoln City from Portland, both of which take approximately the same amount of time:

Take I-5 south to Oregon 99W west in Tigard, then follow Oregon 18 west near McMinnville to its intersection with U.S. 101. OR
Take I-5 south to Salem Parkway in Salem. In downtown Salem, take Oregon 22 west to Oregon 18 west at Willamina. Follow Oregon 18 to U.S. 101.
Central Lincoln City is about 5 miles south on U.S. 101 from the junction with Oregon 18.
Portland International Airport (PDX IATA) and Eugene Airport (EUG IATA) are the two nearest airports with scheduled service.

Get around[edit]
Lincoln City is a fairly small town and very easy to find your way around by car, bicycle, public transportation or by foot or walk the length (north & south) along the beach at low tide.  Much of Lincoln City is laid out in a grid, and fairly easy to navigate. The town is divided into quadrants. These quadrants are roughly divided by the 'D' River between north/south and Highway 101 between east/west (Logan Rd divides between east & west north of the 4100 block, north of town).

By bus[edit]
Lincoln County Transit (LINC) operates a regularly scheduled bus/shuttle service around town as the Lincoln City Loop and limited service down to Depoe Bay & Newport along US Hwy 101 on one route and to Otis and Rose Lodge along OR-Hwy 18 on another route.  Bus routes are not numbered.
