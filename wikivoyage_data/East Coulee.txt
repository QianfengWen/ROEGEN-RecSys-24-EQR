Follow in the historic footsteps of the miners. Put on a cap lamp and hike up the inclined conveyer tunnel to the mine entry, set high in the Badlands.

Do[edit]
51.38042-112.535023 Willow Creek Hoodoo Interpretive Trail (take Highway 10 southeast 16 km from Drumheller, look for sign marking turnoff, drive 1 km NE to parking area). Hoodoos are a characteristic rock formation of the badlands. Looking like 2-m-tall mushrooms, they were formed when a cap of more resistant rock protected the softer rock underneath from erosion. Hoodoos can be found in other parts of the region, but this trail makes a few of them easy to visit. A picture there shows that, sadly, there are fewer hoodoos now than even a few decades ago, as erosion and tourist curiosity take their toll. The trail is under 1 km and an easy scramble across rocks. Parking area includes covered picnic tables and chemical toilets. There is also a Hoodoo Trail drive through the area, along Route 10.
