Würzburg or Wuerzburg (and sometimes misspelled as Wurzburg) is in Franconia, in northern Bavaria, Germany. It is the largest city in the Lower Franconia region, famous throughout Germany for its wine and as the northern end of the Romantic Road.

Understand[edit]
A city rich in history that revolves around the Franconian locality, today Würzburg is a beautiful, historic, and lively city that is often overlooked by foreign visitors. It should also not be overlooked however, that a third of its roughly 130,000 inhabitants (2018) are students of 3 colleges based here. As such, travellers can also find an extensive assortment of cheap non-German food and some partying scenes, amidst the local culture that the city preserves.

History[edit]
Founded in the 10th century, Würzburg served as the home of powerful prince-bishops for many centuries. It is renowned for the Residence, regarded as one of the finest palaces in Europe and a high point of Baroque art (UNESCO cultural world heritage). Würzburg is also home to one of the oldest churches in Germany, built in the 8th century on top of a former pagan shrine. One of its most famous structures, Festung Marienberg, is a fortress which now surrounds the church.
Würzburg was the centre of the kingdom known as Franconia, also the namesake region for the northern half of what is now the state of Bavaria. In the 19th century, Napoleon merged Franconia with its southern neighbour Bavaria, by which the city is ruled to this day.
Würzburg experienced heavy demolition during a 20-minute Allied bombing raid in 1945 which destroyed some 80% of its city buildings. Much of the city has since been rebuilt, though not as painstakingly true to its original architecture as some other historic German communities. Anyone eager to visit this town to study its historic architectural structures should be prepared to see its restored buildings placed next to several post-war modernistic houses. Until 2006, Würzburg was home to a large US military installment after World War II. As a result, many of the locals are still familiar with American customs.
Today, Würzburg is still a beautiful old town, which although still not very famous outside Germany, but offers a charming culture and exterior that entices visitors to explore the region, either as part of the Main River cruise or the Romantic Road excursion.

Get in[edit]
49°47′36″N 9°55′49″EMap of Würzburg


By plane[edit]
49.64819.966391 Giebelstadt Airport (GHF  IATA) (20 km to the south of Würzburg). This former Army airfield (first used by the Nazis and until 2006 by the US) can handle somewhat larger private planes.   
49.81789.89752 Würzburg-Schenkenturm airfield. Private propeller airplanes may land at Schenkenturm airstrip.   
For commercial service, Frankfurt (FRA IATA) and Nuremberg (NUE IATA) are the closest airports. Connection to the Frankfurt airport is faster and much more convenient thanks to the presence of a dedicated long-distance station, from where travellers can ride the Intercity Express (ICE) for 90 minutes to the city's main train station, which comes at least every hour.
If you are flying to Nuremberg, you must transfer to the main train station. From here, trains range from the expensive express train (ICE) (60 minutes) to the cheap regional service (R or RE) (minimum 2 hours). If speed and time is not of highest concern, buy a Bayern ticket which covers all local transportation and regional rail between the cities.
Munich Airport (MUC IATA) Lufthansa's second hub is geographically close and downtown Munich is indeed only two hours from Würzburg. However, you'll have to schlep 45 minutes by S-Bahn to downtown Munich before you can get on an ICE, making the connection somewhat tedious.

By train[edit]
49.8013899.9355563 Würzburg Hauptbahnhof (main train station) (QWU  IATA). It can be reached directly from almost any major train station in most parts of Germany; getting to eastern German cities such as Berlin and Leipzig, or the Black Forest region requires a transit. As Würzburg is the southern terminus of Germany's first high speed railway line specifically built for the ICE, connections are remarkably easy. Hourly direct ICE services run to Frankfurt (1 hr), Cologne (2 hr 40 min), and Düsseldorf (2 hr 50 min) at the westbound track, in addition to Hannover (2 hr 30 min) and Hamburg (3 hr 30 min) to the north, while Munich (2 hr) and Nuremberg (1 hr) are served half-hourly. Speed does however come at a price, and unless you buy your tickets in advance you will pay a lot. Tickets on the ICE start at €20 per person (group discounts available) when bought in advance with the number of cheap tickets lower and sold out faster on popular routes and times. The only main city not connected to the ICE system would be Stuttgart, 2 hr 30 min away using an express regional train every hour.   
Internationally, there's also an Austrian Nightjet sleeper train two nights a week, north via Frankfurt airport and Cologne to Brussels and south to Vienna, Munich and Innsbruck. Daytime ICE trains also run to Vienna every 3 hours.
Regional trains connect Würzburg to other cities within the Franconia area, with up to hourly connections to Schweinfurt, Bamberg, Aschaffenburg, and Nuremberg, the same train can sometimes also take you to Frankfurt in the neighboring state of Hessen. For regional trains throughout the state of Bavaria, you can get the Bayern Ticket that costs €26 for one person and €8 for every additional member of your group up to four and is valid for the whole day (starting at 09:00 unless it is a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday). The Bayern ticket is also accepted on all local public transportation. Regio-Tickets for regional trains to Frankfurt as well as Leipzig and the state of Thüringen (€32, €29, and €23 respectively, plus €8 per additional person up to 4 people) are also available. Travel to Würzburg is also covered under the Baden-Württemberg ticket for travel to or from the state of Baden-Württemberg (cost: €24 per person plus €6 per additional passenger up to 4 people). A direct train ride to Stuttgart takes around 2½ hours.

By bus[edit]
All public and private buses are served at the Busbahnhof on the left side of the main train station. While direct connections to major German towns are possible, getting outside of Germany usually requires a transit at the larger cities.
From April to October, a shuttle service runs between Würzburg and along the Romantic Road to Füssen, with connections to Frankfurt and Munich, respectively.

By car[edit]
Würzburg has an excellent connection to the German "Autobahn" (highway)-system. A3 (highway 3) from Cologne via Frankfurt and Nuremberg to Austria passes the city as well as A7 (highway 7) from Hannover via Göttingen to Ulm. In addition there is A81 to Stuttgart.

By ship[edit]
Cruises along the Main River often feature a stop at Würzburg, docking adjacent to the city centre. Ships dock during the morning so that the tourists can explore the city by day and be back in the boat by night.

Get around[edit]
Orientation[edit]
Würzburg is a municipal city with multiple districts; they are however easily distinguishable because of its separation.
The area of most interest for tourists and most commercial activity would be the city center or Innenstadt, enclosed by the Ringpark (a park circling the downtown area) up to the Main River. Sanderau is immediately south of downtown and a couple hundred meters east of the park is Frauenland. West of the river is Zellerau, where the trams also pass by. Northeast of the train station passing the bridge over the track is Grombühl, also served by a tram line. These are the de-facto central areas of Würzburg where most of the population lives and activities occur.

On foot[edit]
Most of the commercial and tourist spots in Würzburg are contained within the Ringpark. The retail area is found primarily alongside the tram lines and on the pedestrian-only Spiegelstraße and Eichhornstraße, just straight after the Marian chapel at the city square.
A non-stop walk from the main train station to the south end of Ringpark at the Sandering tram station should take only 30 minutes. With the exception of a steep climb to the Marienberg Fortress and the Käppele, you can expect to walk on flat ground on the inner side of the Ringpark.

Public transportation[edit]
Map of the Würzburg tram system
Würzburg is well served by five tram lines (German: Straßenbahn or locally: Straba) and a handful of bus routes (some of which also run all night) will take you to the suburbs. Public transportation maps and timetables for the immediate city area can be found from the WVV website (in German only). In a general orientation however, all five tram lines are interconnected at a corridor spanning within the city centre between the main train station (Hauptbahnhof) at the north end and Sanderring at the south end, with most bus lines terminating or stopping at either end.
For visitors to the Marienberg fortress, a bus service (Route 9) from the Mainfranken Theater and the Würzburg Residenz runs only from Easter to mid-October. Otherwise, from the city centre cross the old bridge and walk the way up for about 30 minutes.

Fares[edit]
A short ride within 4 tram or bus stops will cost €1.40 for adults and 70 cents for kids ages 6 to 14.
A one-way ticket costs €2.50 for adults and €1.20 for kids ages 6 to 14.
A 6-time ticket costs €6.80 and can be used in any way such as 6 rides for one person or one ride for six people.
A daily ticket costs €4.30 for one person and €8.70 for two adults plus up to two kids ages 6 to 14 and is valid up to 03:00 the following day; if the ticket is bought on a Saturday or the first of a two-day holiday, it is valid until 03:00 Monday or day after the two-day holiday.
All bus tickets can be bought at the automated machines in the tram stations or from the bus drivers, they give change too!
As an alternative, a Bayern ticket valid for the entire state as well as the Deutschlandticket can also be used.

By car[edit]
While a car is not necessarily needed in the city centre (and forbidden on many roads within the city centre), it might be useful for venturing out elsewhere, especially to the Marienberg fortress, due to the scarcity of bus service. The areas north of Hauptbahnhof and east of the highway are exclusively served by bus for its public transport with at least 20-minute intervals; if you don't want to wait, then a car will take you there faster.

Churches[edit]
Interior of the Neumünster church
Within the city centre are nine Catholic churches, many located less than 500 m from each other, each offering a different design of its facade and altar.

49.793089.932167 Würzburger Dom (St. Killian's Cathedral), Domstraße 40, ☏ +49 931 38662900. One of the largest Romanesque's churches in Germany, the Catholic church in its present form was built from 1040 to 1075 and consecrated in 1187.

49.794779.929518 Marienkapelle, Markplatz 7, ☏ +49 931 38662800. This building essentially dominates the market square, thanks to its size and its dominant red paint. The chapel, erected in 1377, is a mixture between a basilica and a hall church that was popular in the late-Gothic period and its three portals portray late Gothic to early Renaissance design, each with its own delicate carving at its tympanum, depicting of some of the key events of Christianity. At the top of the tower is a gold-covered statue of Mary. (updated Sep 2019)
49.784329.921819 Käppele (Little Chapel), Spittelbergweg 21 (take bus 35 to Käppele bus stop, walk down the second alley on the left at the dead end; for access from the Stations of the Cross, turn left to the pathway at Nikolausstraße, make another left at the end, and turn right in front of the Germania House), ☏ +49 931 79407760. Daily 08:00-17:00. A church at the hillside near the fortress. From its humble beginnings as the site of an erected pieta in 1640, at which at least four miracles were reported, a chapel was then built around it. Balthasar Neumann, the same architect that designed the Residence, built a church that incorporated the old chapel in 1750, though the interiors were actually not finished until 71 years later. Because of its extensive collection of life-size statues and classic interior, being the only church intact during the 1945 bombing, it is an extremely popular place for weddings, in addition to pilgrimage during the Marian holidays and Pentecost. Behind the church are the Stations of the Cross staggered on 5 floors, with each of the station hosting meticulously carved statues at least two meters wide. (updated Sep 2019)

Hofgarten Weinfest, in the Court Gardens of the Residence Palace, in July.
Weinfest am Stein, in a winery in the vineyards. With live music, crowded, in July.
Weinparade, on Market Square, end of August.
Nearly every winegrowing village in Lower Franconia has its own wine fair, so you can visit at least one if you visit Würzburg in the summer or autumn.

Other festivals[edit]
Faschingszug, as with the rest of Germany, the Sunday before Lent is always filled with parades of floats and festivities.
Africa Festival, Europe's largest African music and culture festival. Late May to early June.

Outdoors[edit]
Both banks of the Main River, especially on the east side, contain an almost uninterrupted walking and jogging track. For those who prefer to just chill, benches are abundant, or simply sit at the quay like the locals do.
49.800219.902392 Skatepark Würzburg, Mainaustraße 46. M-Sa 08:00-20:00, Su 08:00-13:00 & 15:00-20:00. A public skatepark frequented by youngsters located at the Main River bank. (updated Sep 2020)
Hiking[edit]
Outside the city center, you will see a wine garden on at least one side of your view.
Hiking on the wine hills around Würzburg is a local pastime while enjoying the majestic views of the city and the Main river valley. Unlike many other parts of the world, the paths are open to the public!

A hike on the hill behind the main train station offers you a splendid panorama of the whole city, which also includes the landmark Marienberg fortress at the other side of the river. These are accessible from the path near the psychiatry department of Uniklinikum in the Grombühl neighborhood or a tunnel under Posthalle.
The wine fields adjacent to the Marienberg fortress is also an alternate route up the hill, albeit in a slower pace. Hiking here offers you three sides of views: the city center opposite the river, the Kappele and adjacent large houses, and the rear side of the fortress. These are accessible from the path opposite Lidl grocery store at Leistenstraße, Burkarder Garten next to Sparkasse Bank on the riverside, or from Oberer Burgweg (on the way along access to the fortress by car or bus).
Slightly away from the city is a much larger and taller winery area that overlooks the Heidingsfeld neighborhood and the Main River valley. These are accessible from Hans-Löffler Straße (bus number 6) or about 5 minute ride south from the University of Würzburg campus at Hubland.
Buy[edit]
Even though shops are to close all day on Sundays and at 20:00 on other days, as are the rest of Bavaria, there are two exceptions to this: Mantelnsonntag on the last Sunday of October (open from 13:00 to 18:00) and Kultur- und Einkaufsnacht on the Saturday before Advent (4 weekends before Christmas) when shops open until 23:00 and the Christmas Market until 22:00.
The general shopping area downtown lies along the tram tracks all the way from the main train station to Sanderring and the streets that immediately branch out of it. Away from the tram tracks, locals also frequent the pedestrian-only Eichhornstraße and Spiegelstraße (if you know German, you will see symbols on the sidewalks that resemble the street name). Eichhornstraße extends westward to the Marienplatz, where a traditional market and small stalls stand amidst the Marienkapelle and a few large shops. Here is also where the annual Christmas market takes place. West of the river, there is a strip of shops along Burkarderstraße and Zellerstraße immediately after the old bridge. Outside these areas, the stores generally cater to residents of the local district.

49.7855910.030611 S.Oliver Outlet, Am Moritzberg 3, Rottendorf, ☏ +49 9302 3096495. M-F 10:00-19:00, Sa 09:00-18:00. The clothing brand S.Oliver has its roots in Würzburg. Here is its only outlet store. (updated Sep 2019)
Wine[edit]
Germany may be world renowned for its beer, but its wine is its hidden treasure. Franconian wines are white and produced from mainly Silvaner grapes, high in minerals thanks to the soil on which the vine grows, and very dry, with sugar amounts of only up to 5 grams. Another of its unique feature is being packed in a Bocksbeutel of 3/4 or 3/8 litres. Unlike many other German wine regions, a large amount of Franconian wine is drunk in the area where it is produced.
If you do not know much about wine, buy it directly from the winegrowers or from small shops which sell only wine (Vinothek).

49.796059.935132 Bürgerspital Weinhaus, Semmelstraße 2. Tu-Sa 09:00-00:00, Su 11:00-18:00, M 09:00-18:00. Wine collection, both red and white, from the Bürgerspital brand, with opportunities for tasting flights and even pairing with a platter of your choice. (updated Sep 2019)

Learn[edit]
As one enters Würzburg from the motorway, the sign above the city name says it all, Universitätstadt (university city). Almost a third of its 150,000 inhabitants are students from three colleges, whose buildings are peppered around town. In addition, thousands of foreign full time and exchange students do flock to Würzburg annually, which explains the regular overhearing of English and other foreign languages being spoken if you happen to pass by, a good selection of international food, and noticeably fewer people during exam and holiday periods of February to March and July to September. Among the factors that entice them to come include extensive cooperation with foreign universities, availability of English courses, the medium size of the city, and its location right in central Germany.

49.787919.935484 University of Würzburg (Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg), Sanderring 2, ☏ +49 931 31-0. Over 80% of Würzburg students (around 29,000 to be exact) study here. Founded in 1402, it's the 6th oldest university in the German language scope (Germany, Austria, Switzerland). It belongs to the U15 group of top research universities. Many foreigners going here are usually taking a master's and postgraduate degree and research, many of which are also offered in English. Exchange students from all around the world also come here to study for up to three semesters under the Erasmus exchange programme. Lecture halls are scattered throughout town depending on the faculty, but most concentrated at Hubland which used to be site of the former US Army garrison. (updated Oct 2019)
49.787589.933385 Würzburg-Schweinfurt Technical College (Technische Hochschule Würzburg-Schweinfurt), Münzstraße 12, ☏ +49 931 3511-0. Although the university serves two towns with equal division of quantity of faculties, Würzburg is where most of the administrative seats are. Foreigners who come here are mainly exchange and master students taking up business and economy courses in English. As with the University, lecture halls are scattered throughout town depending on the faculty, but they are most concentrated at around Münzstraße near Sanderring. (updated Oct 2019)
49.794629.940226 University of Music Würzburg (Hochschule für Musik Würzburg), Hofstallstr. 6–8, ☏ +49 931 32187 0. Offering specialized bachelor degrees in an array of musical instruments, composing, conducting, and even a special program as a music teacher. (updated Oct 2019)

The first footing of Italian cuisine in Germany
Pizzas and Italian cuisine in general are country-wide beloved non-German options, however its history is only fairly recent in the making compared to say, the Americas.
Nicolino di Camilo, called Nick, comes from Villa Magna in Abruzzo and came in 1946 via Fürth to Würzburg. Here he first worked as a bouncer in the "Country Club", a popular meeting place for US soldiers. By chance, he met the US officer Coletti, an American who also came from the native Abruzzo. At the instigation of the officer, Nick worked as a part-time cook at the American GIs in clubs and casinos around Würzburg with food from his homeland. The success was so immense that Nick opened on 24 March 1952 the Bier- und Speisewirtschaft Capri (now Capri Blau Grotto) as the first Italian restaurant in Germany. Later he invented the now standardized cardboard pizza boxes for his delivery service.
The first guests in the restaurant were US soldiers of the former Würzburg garrison. Only starting from the 1970s economic miracle did Germans get to know Italian cuisine after trade between Germany and other countries intensified and the yeast dough flat cake in the Italian version became one of Germany's favourite comfort foods.


Even though it is in Bayern, those that look forward to the brown pretzel and white sausage (Weißwurst) are unfortunately coming to the wrong place. Instead, Franconian cuisine is traditionally served. Even then it is still an umbrella term, as even different cities can have different variations. Specialities of Würzburg include fish from the Main River and sausage with wine blend.
Otherwise, those feeling peckish for something else should not be left disappointed. Thanks to its young and multicultural student population, a couple of Asian and southern European establishments have also been established.

Stay safe[edit]
Like most of Bavaria, Würzburg is very safe. At worst, areas near the Hauptbahnhof and at Grombühl may be frequented with rowdy people, although they will usually not disturb anyone else's business. Use your common sense to avoid risky situations, though.

Go next[edit]

A shortlist of other attractions on the Lower Franconia include castles at Lohr am Main, Mespelbrunn, the spa town of Bad Kissingen, and Miltenberg.
Bamberg is less than an hour away and its unspoiled old city is on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
In Wertheim (about 35 km away), you can travel the route Charming Tauber valley from Wertheim via Tauberbischofsheim and Bad Mergentheim to Rothenburg ob der Tauber.
