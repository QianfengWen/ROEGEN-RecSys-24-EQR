Jojutla (officially known as Jojutla de Juarez) is in the southern part of the state of Morelos. Jojutla is a weekend destination for people who enjoy water sports of all kinds. There are at least a half dozen waterparks around town with tubes, chutes, wave pools and lazy rivers for tube floating. If you like your water faster, the nearby Amacuzac River offers Class 3 whitewater rafting. If you prefer a big, open lake for power boating, water skiing, or jet skiing, you'll love Lake Tequesquitengo.


Understand[edit]
History has been pretty calm around Jojutla. Although obsidian and ceramic fragments have been found in at least three nearby villages, there are no significant archaeological sites in the area. The town is old though, having been conquered by the Aztec between 1425 and 1436, according to the Codex Mendoza. 
No significant battles were fought in Jojutla during the War for Independence. Although the town was held and sacked by the Maderistas during the Mexican Revolution of the early 20th century, no significant historical sites or museums document the period.
The city and surrounding villages were hit hard by an earthquake in 2017. Hundreds of buildings were destroyed and 73 people died. Several public facilities, including the town hall, were severely damaged. There are still homes and businesses that have not been rebuilt.
In 2010, the city was home to almost 19,000 people.
