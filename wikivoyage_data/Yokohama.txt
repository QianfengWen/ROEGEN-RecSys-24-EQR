Nippon-Maru at Minato Mirai
On the western coast of Tokyo Bay directly south of Tokyo, Yokohama (横浜) is the second largest city in Japan and one of the cities most used to seeing foreigners.


Understand[edit]
First a fishing village, Yokohama developed into a bustling port city following the establishment of foreign trade after the opening of Japan in 1854. It was the site where Commodore Matthew Perry landed and signed the Kanagawa Treaty ending over 200 years of isolationalism by the Tokugawa Shogunate. At the forefront of the Meiji restoration, the first train line in Japan connected Tokyo and Yokohama.  However, Yokohama was devastated by the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 and again by the firebombings of World War II, and never really regained its prominence.  It remains a maritime city to this day and retains an international flavor.

Tourist Information[edit]
The city has a multilingual Official Visitors Guide site.

Get in[edit]
Yokohama is half an hour away from Tokyo, and effectively forms a part of the giant conurbation.

By plane[edit]
Yokohama does not have its own airport. You can reach Yokohama from Tokyo's two main airports.
Some Narita Express trains from Narita Airport go through to Yokohama (1½ hours, ¥4290 or free with JR Pass). Limousine Buses run frequently from Narita to the Yokohama City Air Terminal (YCAT) in 2 hours (¥3600). The cheapest access from Narita Airport involves a Keisei train. The Keisei Main Line train, with one across-the-platform transfer at Aoto, will cost ¥1500 to Yokohama. The Sky Access line train will cost ¥1690. Most Sky Access trains run to Keisei Ueno, but there are a handful each day which run through to Yokohama (and beyond; generally to Kanazawa-Bunko) on the Keikyu Main Line.
From Haneda Airport, take the Keikyu Line's Express (急行) to Yokohama station in 30–35 minutes for ¥480. The Express has several variants: If the train's destination is Shin-Zushi (新逗子) or Kanazawa-Bunko (金沢文庫), then you can stay on the train for the entire trip. If the train goes to another destination, it's likely to continue on into Tokyo so you will need to change at Keikyu-Kamata station to the next main line limited express train going in the other direction.

By train[edit]

The overwhelming majority of visitors to Yokohama arrive from Tokyo by train.  A multitude of train lines connect the two cities at roughly equal prices, but some of the more convenient options are:

Tokyu Toyoko Line (東急東横線) from Shibuya to Yokohama Station. A trip from Shibuya to Yokohama takes as little as 26 minutes on the fastest service; at a cost of ¥280 this is the cheapest trip from metro Tokyo. Chinatown, the terminus of the MM21 line, is another 10 minutes away (Motomachi-Chukagai, ¥220 from Yokohama or ¥500 from Shibuya). Up to eight kyūkō (急行) and tokkyū (特急) trains per hour.
The Toyoko Line station in Shibuya is deep underground, due to its connection with the Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line subway. On a positive note, this allows trains to continue north to Shinjuku, Ikebukuro and into Saitama.

JR Ueno-Tokyo Line (上野東京ライン) and Tokaido Main Line (東海道線) from Ueno, Tokyo and Shinagawa stations (all on the Yamanote Line). Departs every 10 minutes; more trains during rush hour. About 25 minutes from Tokyo to Yokohama, ¥470. Commuter Rapid Service (通勤快速) and Shonan Liner (湘南ライナー) trains do not  stop at Yokohama Station.
JR Shonan-Shinjuku Line (湘南新宿ライン) from Ikebukuro, Shinjuku, Shibuya, Ebisu and Ōsaki. This was the first JR line that connected the western part of the Tokyo metropolis to Yokohama; it competes with the Fukutoshin and Toyoko lines. Roughly four trains per hour, reaching Yokohama from Shinjuku in as little as 30 minutes at a cost of ¥550.
JR Trains from Ōmiya and Urawa in Saitama and Akabane in northern Tokyo run towards Yokohama using either the Shonan Shinjuku Line or the Ueno-Tokyo Line. The trip from Ōmiya takes 60–70 minutes either way and costs ¥920.

JR Yokosuka Line (横須賀線): A less-convenient alternative from Tokyo Station and Shinagawa. However, it is the route of choice if coming from stations east of Tokyo on the Sobu Rapid line, such as Tsudanuma and Chiba, as most of these trains continue onto the Yokosuka line. About 30 minutes from Tokyo to Yokohama; about 75 minutes from Chiba (¥1080). Departs every 15 minutes or so from Tokyo; more trains during rush hour.
JR Keihin-Tohoku Line (京浜東北線) from Nippori, Ueno, Akihabara, Tokyo, and Shinagawa Stations. This train stops at more stations in Yokohama than the Yokosuka Line, including Sakuragicho (桜木町), which is within walking distance of Chinatown. It is also a convenient route from stations north of Tokyo in Saitama prefecture. About 35 minutes from Tokyo Station to Yokohama Station. Departs every 5 minutes from Tokyo; more trains during rush hour.
On the Tokaido, Yokosuka and Keihin Tohoku lines, the trip from Tokyo Station costs ¥470, and from Shinagawa, ¥290.

Keihin-Kyuko Main Line (京急本線), or Keikyu for short, from Shinagawa and Haneda Airport. Most trains from the Toei Asakusa subway line continue onto the Keikyu line. Departs every 10 minutes from Shinagawa at a cost of ¥300 (more trains during rush hour), with the fastest train reaching Yokohama in only 18 minutes. Keikyu WING (京急ウィング) trains do not stop at Yokohama.
Sotetsu Line (相鉄線)  from Ebina to Yokohama (25 minutes by limited express, ¥310) and from Shonan-dai to Yokohama (30 minutes by express, ¥350). A useful connection from the western Tokyo suburbs on the Odakyu Line. The Sotetsu Line also has through-service to the JR Line (via the Shonan-Shinjuku Line) to Shibuya and Shinjuku. The trip from Ebina to Shinjuku costs ¥844.  There are no direct trains coming from Shonandai to Shinjuku on the Sotetsu Line, so a transfer at Nishiya is needed for service to the JR Line. Alternatively, those from Shonandai can take the Odakyu Line which also runs into Shinjuku.
Shinkansen trains go to Shin-Yokohama station instead, a few stations away from the main Yokohama station. The two stations are connected via the JR Yokohama line (10–15 minutes via direct service, ¥170) and the Yokohama Subway Blue Line (10 minutes, ¥240). Alternatively, take the Shinkansen to Shinagawa and change to the Tokaido, Yokosuka or Keihin Tohoku lines. If your final destination is Chinatown or the harbor area, taking one of the non-Shinkansen trains listed above is likely to be faster.

Minato-Mirai Line[edit]
The Minato Mirai Line (みなとみらい線) is a direct extension of the Tokyu Toyoko Line. Connection with the lines is at Yokohama Station, and the line has five stations: Shin-Takashimacho (新高島町), Minatomirai (みなとみらい), Bashamichi (馬車道), Nihon Ōdori (日本大通り), and Motomachi-Chūkagai (元町・中華街), terminating at the posh Motomachi shopping street and the second largest Chinatown in the world. The line’s stations are worth seeing, especially Minato-Mirai Station itself, where you are able to see straight up to the very spacious entrance hall (7 floors in all) of the Yokohama Landmark Tower, the second tallest building in Japan.
Bashamichi Station is built with artifact bricks and hosts the remains of the first western style bank of Yokohama. Bashamichi (literal translation: horse carriage street) was the first street in Japan to have gas fired street lighting, which were re-installed lately. Bashamichi Station is surrounded by historical buildings, built only a century ago, but for Japanese standards are a true catapulting into westernization. Thus all buildings remaining (partially rebuilt after the heavy bombings of World War II) are protected as “historical – cultural national treasure.”
Nihon-Ōdori Station is similar to Bashamichi Station. Nihon-Ōdori (meaning Japan Avenue) is a two lane-two way avenue, which back then separated the living quarters of the foreign delegation and Japanese.
The line runs parallel to the Keihin-Tohoku Line. Due to the massive expense of maintaining the designer-class stations, the fares are rather pricey, but definitely worthwhile. The line runs through the very historical parts of Yokohama, when Japan opened up to the Western civilization. Many history-related museums of Yokohama are dotted along the line, and to attract further tourists, the line offers a one-day unlimited ride ticket (¥460 for adults, 1/2 price for children).

Get around[edit]
View of Yokohama skyline and passenger port
Yokohama is not a very automobile-friendly place, especially for foreigners. Public transit and walking works best. The official guide site has some maps in English.

By train[edit]
The Minato Mirai 21 subway line from Yokohama station down the harborfront to Chinatown is the best method of accessing the main tourist haunts.  The main subway line is useful primarily for transfers between central Yokohama and the Shinkansen station. JR Negishi Line (根岸線) is also available for Chinatown and Minato Mirai Area. All Negishi Line Trains with the blue line are direct service via the Keihin-Tohoku Line.  For suburban areas, Yokohama has a subway and extensive commuter rail lines that crisscross the city from every direction and to all neighboring cities.
Yokohama Subway (横浜市営地下鉄) has two lines: the main Blue Line from Azamino to Shonandai and the short Green Line from Hiyoshi to Nakayama. You can get around Yokohama easily using the subway lines.

By bus[edit]
Akai Kutsu Bus is a sight-seeing bus around Minatomirai, Chinatown and Motomachi. It looks like an old red bus and runs every 20 minutes on the main loop. A ticket costs ¥220, and a 1 day pass costs ¥500.

By boat[edit]
The "Sea Bass" boat operates between JR Yokohama station (east exit), Minato Mirai and Yamashita Park, and is one of the nicest ways to get around on a sunny day. The fare is ¥350-700 depending on the distance.

By human power[edit]
Velo taxis called "Cyclopolitain" (シクロポリタン, shikuroporitan) are widely available within the harbor area, while rickshaws make their rounds within Chinatown.

On foot[edit]
Central Yokohama is comparatively compact and the Chinatown/Yamashita Park area is best explored on foot.
