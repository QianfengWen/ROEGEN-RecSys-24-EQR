Sussex is a town in Kings County, New Brunswick.
The town's population is about 4,300 people (2016), and the general area is home to some 35,000 people. It's a quiet, friendly area, where people on the street smile and say "Hi", even if by chance they don't know one another.


Understand[edit]
Sussex is nicknamed Dairytown and is known as the "Dairy Centre of the Maritimes"; the reason is obvious when you look in any direction. Farms dot the landscape of Sussex Farm and its outlying areas, and there are some operating within the town's boundaries. It's not uncommon to see tractors and other farm equipment travelling in town or on local roads, especially during fall harvest or haying seasons. Sussex really is an agricultural centre, besides the poultry and dairy farms, pastures of cattle, sheep and horses, a livestock auction is held in town every Wednesday, and it's home to the NB Agriculture Museum. Overlooking Sussex, Dairytown Products Limited turns New Brunswick milk into award-winning butter, and also operates "Mrs. Dunsters", a bakery famous for its doughnuts.
An underground salt and potash mine just east of town in the community of Penobsquis provided 400 jobs to the area until was closed in 2018. Potash is a key ingredient in fertilizer.
Camp Sussex (which is now the Sussex Industrial Park) housed Camp Sussex Mural, and trained most of the Canadian Army personnel who were dispatched overseas during the Second World War. The 8th Hussars Regiment is headquartered here and hundreds of veterans return each year to see the town that they called home during training.
