Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
Tassielink provides a bus service from Hobart once daily from Monday to Thursday.

By car[edit]
From Hobart, use the Midland Highway (National Highway 1) until the A4 exit. Once on the A4 exit, head east, and continue straight when the road changes its name from A4 to A3. Halt at the welcome to Scamander sign.
Alternatively, you could just use the A3 from Hobart the entire journey, although you really won't go more than 100 km/h at max.
