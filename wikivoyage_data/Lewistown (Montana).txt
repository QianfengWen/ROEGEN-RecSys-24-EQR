Map of Lewistown (Montana)
As with most of Montana, a vehicle is the best way to get around.  The historic downtown area is walkable, and walking tour maps can be picked up at the Chamber.
When adventuring outside of town, be sure you plan for fuel and download maps. Wide open country is great to explore, just don't expect to always have service and amenities.
