Greenville, one of the fastest growing cities in North Carolina, is the county seat of Pitt County, and is
the principal city of the Greenville, North Carolina metropolitan area. Greenville is known as the cultural, economical, and educational hub of North Carolina's Inner Banks, the geographical area east of Raleigh and west of the North Carolina coast. 


Understand[edit]
The city boasts a vibrant business community and East Carolina University, and is ranked among the top places nationally to play, bike, and study. In 2004, Greenville was named Sportstown USA for the state of North Carolina by Sports Illustrated and the National Parks & Recreation Association.  The city is also known as "BMX Pro Town USA", as it is home for many top professional BMX riders, such as Dave Mirra, Ryan Nyquist, Ryan Guettler, Mike Laird, and Josh Harrington. It's also home to famous YouTuber MrBeast.

Get in[edit]
Greenville is in a central relative location, being equidistant from Raleigh (to the west) and the Outer Banks (to the east). It is also approximately midway between the North Carolina-Virginia border and the North Carolina-South Carolina border.

By plane[edit]
American Airlines operates a charter flight to Greenville and the airline's regional hub in Charlotte, or fly into the Raleigh-Durham International Airport and use a rental car.

35.635278-77.3852781 Pitt–Greenville Airport (PGV  IATA). You can fly in from Charlotte   (updated May 2019)
But you can also get in from Raleigh-Durham International Airport, the airport that serves the Research Triangle. It's a one-and-a-half hour drive.

By car[edit]
From Raleigh, NC, use US Routes 64 East, 264 East, and 13 North to get into town.  Charlotte Douglas International Airport is considerably further away, but Greenville can be reached from there via I-277 North, I-77 North, I-85 North, I-40 East (and from that point, one uses the routes used by going from Raleigh to Greenville mentioned earlier). From I-95 North or South, use US 264 East to reach Greenville.

By bus[edit]
Greyhound buses are available, as is Amtrak Thruway bus service.

Get around[edit]
Rental cars are the preferred mode of transport, and there is the occasional taxi (but they are not simply out-and-about... one must use the Yellow Pages in the back of the phone book to obtain their services).  For transportation in and around East Carolina University's campus, university visitors can use its bus system.  The City of Greenville operates a mass transit bus system, Greenville Area Rapid Transit or GREAT (the fare is $1.00 with free transfers).
