See[edit]
-2.5887829.745181 National Museum of Rwanda. The National Museum is a surprisingly comprehensive and interesting museum. Even travellers knowledgeable about recent Rwandan history will learn much about Rwanda's colonial and post-colonial governments, as well as the Tutsi monarchy which pre-dated both of these. Many of Rwanda's idiosyncratic cultural attributes will make more sense after a visit to the national museum. FRw 5000 for non-residents   (updated Nov 2019)
 Butare Market. Butare has a bustling market that is open every day except Saturday. Although there will be no souvenirs on sale, this market is an excellent way to learn how Rwandans shop for their everyday needs. Be prepared to bargain. (updated Nov 2019)
-2.61611129.7427781 [dead link] National University of Rwanda. Although a stroll through the University would take at most 20 minutes, it is a worthwhile trip to see an active African university.

-2.454429.56842 Murambi Genocide Memorial Centre. In 1994, Murambi was the site of a large massacre at a vocational school where several hundred Tutsis were hiding.

Do[edit]
Murambi Genocide Memorial centre: This memorial center is one of six major centres in Rwanda that commemorate the 1994 Genocide against Tutsi in Rwanda. The memorial was founded on 21 April 1995. The site contains 50,000 graves. The school building is now a genocide museum exhibiting the skeletons and mummified bodies of some of the thousands of people killed in Gikongoro Province in 1994. In his study of Rwandan genocide memorials, Timothy Longman argues that although the bodies on display at Murambi are presented as those of people killed on site, in reality they are bodies brought to Murambi from throughout the surrounding area. Those killed at Murambi were buried in mass graves on site in 1996. This Memorial site is source of information on the Gnocide against Tutsi in 1994 in Rwanda.
Buy[edit]
 Souvenir Shop (next to Cafe Connexion). Shop with lots of handicraft: woodcarvings, baskets, printed cards. (updated Feb 2017)
Eat[edit]
The most reliable restaurant in Butare is the restaurant at the Hotel Ibis on the main street.  However, much of the Ibis's fare is Belgian instead of Rwandan.  For Rwandan fare, try the Restaurant Macrobiotique, which is located on the same side of the main road as the Hotel Ibis, but farther towards the university. It is a popular place for students to take their meals.
For lunch, try the nameless lunch restaurant located across the street from the Ibis and a little to the right (as you face away from Ibis).  It is to the right of the craft store.  For lunch they offer classic Rwandan comfort food: brochettes (goat kabobs), plantains, sweet potatoes, boiled cassava, beans, and rice.  It is excellent.
According to local people several years ago the government passed a law requiring that all government employees only had 30 minutes for lunch each day, this lead to the creation of lunch buffets across Rwanda that allowed for these workers to fill up on food and get back to the office in time. For one of these ubiquitous buffets head to Amafu Restaurant on the second floor across the street from Hotel Ibis.  The menu changes depending on the day, but usually you can find soup, rice, beans, potatoes, sombe (kassava leaves), pasta, salad, and meat.  A vegetarian plate costs FRw 3000.  Beef is FRw 500 extra and chicken and fish FRw 1500 extra.
If you walk towards the University you will find Hotel Credo on the left side, they have a swimming pool and a restaurant. Opposite of this hotel there is the ice cream parlour Inzozi Nziza where you can get ice cream, very nice cakes and cookies.
An excellent place for dinner is the Chinese restaurant located across the street from the market, behind the gas station.  Chinese workers built most of the paved roads in Rwanda, and a few Chinese restaurants survived their departure.  This one serves a variety of chicken, pork, vegetarian, and beef dishes.

Drink[edit]
There is a nameless dance club in Butare that is open on Friday and Saturday nights.  It is located on the right side of the road which leads to the market from the main road (a quick inquiry at the Hotel Ibis can yield more specific directions).  The club serves beer and liquor.
Basically every restaurant in Butare is also a bar, in hotel Faucon also on the main road, towards Kigali if you leave from Ibis there is a bar with TV specialized on football (soccer) and on Fridays and Saturdays they have a disco.
If you travel the main road towards the University just after you left town and you go down hill there is Cafe Connexion on your right side, you can drink the best cappuccino served in Rwanda there and you can buy the coffee in the shop. Inside you will see the equipment they use to make this excellent coffee. (If the owner is around he is also demonstrating the coffee roasting if you ask him).

Sleep[edit]
By far the best hotel in Butare is the Hotel Ibis, which has been a Butare landmark since the 1940s. Run by a Belgian family for several decades, the Ibis is the only hotel in Butare that has a reliable restaurant open every day of the week, as well as hot water and electricity virtually 24/7. A large patio with outdoor seating is ideal for consumption of Mutzig or Primus (popular beers in Rwanda) or the occasional sorghum beer.
Of course, one popular strategy is to stay at another (cheaper) hotel and eat at the Ibis restaurant, which is open to everyone.
