By train[edit]
South Shore Line. The South Shore Line is an interurban commuter line running from Chicago to South Bend that serves much of northern Indiana and has two stations in Michigan City, 41.711821-86.897851 11th Street and 41.713217-86.8676982 Caroll Avenue. The former is in the city's historic downtown. Its original station house is closed, so riders have to make do with a small passenger shelter at the tip of the adjacent parking lot. The later station is near Michigan City's southern border, in the railroad's depot and repair facilities. Late at night and early in the morning, South Shore Line trains only run between this station and South Bend. South Shore Line runs on a single track embedded in the middle of the street as it travels though Michigan City. When the train stops at 11th Street station, it literally stops in the middle of the street. The city designed special traffic lights that signal the cars not to travel on this section of the street when the train is picking up and dropping off passengers.
Amtrak. In addition to South Shore Line, the city is served by Amtrak's Wolverine Service, which stops in Michigan City twice a day. Amtrak uses the tracks along the lake shore, north of downtown but close to Washington Park, the Old Lighthouse Museum and the beach. The 41.720802-86.9058033 Michigan City station is at 100 Washington St and has a rudimentary passenger shelter.
