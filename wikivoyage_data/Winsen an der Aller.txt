The Groode Hus at Winsen's Farm Museum
Winsen has a population of around 12,900 and lies on the southern edge of the Lüneburg Heath, close to the huge military training area of Bergen-Hohne. It is about 15 km northwest of the county town of Celle. Within the borough of Winsen are the villages of Bannetze, Meißendorf, Stedden, Südwinsen, Thören, Walle and Wolthausen.
Winsen's church is dedicated to John the Baptist which is a clue to when it was founded. All other  villages with churches named after John the Baptist appeared around AD 800.
Today Winsen is a popular local recreation and holiday sport and is an official climatic health spa (Luftkurort).

Prince’s Stones (Prinzensteine), by the track between Winsen and Oldau recall a decisive battle on 28 May 1388 during the Lüneburg War of Succession. According to legend two princes wounded each other mortally at this spot before they realised they were brothers.
Town hall (Rathaus) built on the site of the original district office that had to be demolished. The present building is a baroque affair dating to the 18th century.
