Encarnación is the most southern city of Paraguay and often called The pearl of the South. The Rio Paraná separates it and the Argentine town of Posadas.


Understand[edit]
Encarnación is a short jaunt on a local bus across the river from Posadas, Argentina. A shopping destination for many Argentines availing themselves of the lower taxes and prices, Encarnación is a pleasant, modern and relaxed city. The nearby Jesuit Missions of La Santisima Trinidad de Parana and Jesus de Tavarangue near Encarnación are on the UNESCO World Heritage List.

By bus[edit]
Ciudad del Este stopping at all towns including Trinidad for the Jesuit Mission take about 6 hr and costs GS.60,000.
Asuncion take about 7 hr. Tickets cost GS.70,000 - 120,00 (May 2023) and the buses pass by San Ignacio Guazú (3 hr).
Posadas in Argentina Local buses labelled "Internacional", white in colour, depart from several stops in Posadas' centre, all along Calle Entre Rios. They leave regularly, about two per hour. Tickets are AR$6. The bus will drop you off at the Argentinian passport office, and wait for you to re-board. It will cross the bridge, then leave you at the Paraguayan passport office. Unless you are quick, the bus will move on without you, but you can wait and catch the next one (keep your ticket stub!) instead of paying the exorbitant taxi fees. Bus will drop you at the terminal in Encarnación.
By train[edit]
-27.361172-55.8490311 Estación Internacional de Pasajeros (a few hundred meters from the bridge, south of city center). A railway shuttle service connects Encarnación to Posadas, Argentina, across the bridge over the Río Paraná. This service departs every 30 minutes during the day and reduces travel time to just over ten minutes.  (updated Feb 2019)
Get around[edit]
Encarnación is fairly compact, in as much as there isn't a lot to see outside the easily walkable centre. Buses are infrequent, each ride costs around GS.2,500. There are several taxi stands near the plaza and the bus station, should you wish to go further afield.

Do[edit]
Encarnación's beach
-27.336633-55.8729761 San Jose Beach (Playa San José), End of Curupayty, along the river. The small, artificial beach in Encarnación is surprisingly pleasant. You can stretch out in the sun and soak up the rays, imagining you are at the coast; there is a slight breeze, and the river is wide. You can even go for a dip - apparently it is quite clean and safe. OK for the kids too, as it is not very deep. Yellow buoys separate bathers from jet-skis and boats. Also has a corniche called the Costanera De Encarnación that extends to the north and south ends of the city. If you get hungry, the Hiroshima Grill restaurant has a small outlet on the beach selling snacks and sushi. Free.
