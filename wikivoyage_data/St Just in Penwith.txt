Do[edit]
Walk up to the moors above the town.
St Just is good placed for an overnight stop on the Coastal Path (from Penzance, Lands' End and Sennen to the South and Zennor and St. Ives to the North).
Scenic flights or trial flight lessons from Lands End Airfield 2 miles from town.
Visit Cape Cornwall 2 miles down Cape Cornwall Road (past the grey grim looking Secondary School).  Once thought to be the most Westerly point in the UK, proved wrong with modern mapping.  Stunning scenery and a welcoming Coast Watch Station (www.ccnci.org.uk) on the sea facing slope of the cape.  A good circular walk (3 miles, an hour, plus stops) is: down Cape Cornwall Road to the cricket club, turn left and follow on to Carn Gloose, carry on down the track to Cape Cornwall.  On the way back follow the road for 100 m and turn left 45 degrees along a foot path track, follow this round past the house on the left before turning left onto a foot path.  Follow the valley all the way back to the town.
Visit the ancient stone circles around the town.
Events[edit]
Lafrowda Festival: performing arts festival with (free) live music into the night.  Mid July.
St Just Feast: on 1st November every year is the start of the St Just hunt (which isn't allowed to hunt any more), general 'piss up' in the town.
New Year's Eve: fancy dress night.  Normally every one spills out from all the pubs and dances round the Christmas tree in Market Square (the one with the Co-op) just before midnight.
Market Jew Day in early April every second year is another excuse for a party. It is traditionally the day when the Jews would be shipped out, but luckily now this is only celebrated in a tongue-in-cheek manner.

Stay safe[edit]
St. Just is a safe place with low rates of petty crime.  Be sensible though and don't leave valuables on display in your car over night.  St. Just is a major gateway for narcotics dropped off by small speed boats in the middle of the night at the large number of coves dotted around the coast.  There is a significant organised criminal network operating, although this should be of little significance to the visitor it does create some of the lowest street prices for illegal drugs in Western Europe.

Go next[edit]
Geevor - tin mine Pendeen.
Visit the Isles of Scilly, a 15-minute flight from Land's End Airfield 2 miles from the town or a 2-hour, 40-minute sea crossing from Penzance.
St Ives: drive (or take an open top bus in summer) the 15 miles along the North Coast road (B3306) to St Ives. Spectacular scenery, and various pubs to stop at along the way.  Luckily the UK has a higher drink drive limit than the US or other European countries and it's perfectly normal to have a couple of pints and still drive.  While the limit is higher, the police still crack down hard on anyone caught driving above this limit.
