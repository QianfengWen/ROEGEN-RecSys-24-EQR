Corte's citadel
42.30599.148441 Corte citadel (A citadella). The citadel of Corte was the first of the seven Corsican citadels. It was the only one built inland and its three levels of defence make it an exceptional site in Europe. It was built in two stages, 350 years apart: in 1419, Vincentello d'lstria, built the castle, also called "Eagle's Nest", at the top of the rock overlooking the city. In 1769, under the orders of the Count of Vaux, French troops began the construction of the citadel.
