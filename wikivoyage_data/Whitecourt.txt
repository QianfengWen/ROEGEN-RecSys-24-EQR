The original inhabitants, the Woodland Cree Nation, call this area Sagitawah – “the place where the rivers meet.” The first Hudson's Bay Company trading post was established in 1897, and the first permanent resident settled in 1905. In 1910, with the expansion of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, immigrants were encouraged settle in the inhabited area between Edmonton and the Peace River Country. The name "Whitecourt" was chosen in 1910 by Walter White, the postmaster of the young community.
