Pay a visit to picturesque Brunswick, Maine, and you'll discover something special, something greater than the sum of its parts. It's a classic New England charmer to be sure. Surrounded by pine forests and nestled into a crook of the Androscoggin River, natural beauty is in no short supply. History buffs will appreciate Bowdoin College and her several museums of note; while literature mavens will recognize Brunswick as the setting where Harriet Beecher Stowe penned Uncle Tom's Cabin, a 19th century clarion call for America's abolitionist movement.
Today, several talented chefs have chosen to call this town of 22,000 (2020) home. They've taken the areas already burgeoning food scene and iterated on it, serving up some truly extraordinary cuisine. When you combine the gastronomic offerings, retail options, and a proximity to nature—well, it just adds up to package that's hard to beat. Even if you can't extend your stay, the transit options and relative closeness to larger cities make it almost too easy to return.
Across the river to the north, Topsham is a sleepy town of 10,000 (2020). Along its riverbank, you'll find several fine eateries and a promenade with some great water views.


Understand[edit]
The Androscoggin Swinging Bridge is closely tied to the French Canadian heritage of Brunswick
History[edit]
It was first settled by the Abenaki people, then occupied by English colonists in 1628 as Pejepscot, meaning "the long, rocky rapids part [of the river]". Relations between the peoples were not good; the fledgling town would be burned during King Philip's War and remained generally abandoned until around 1717. Around this time settlers from Boston and Portsmouth purchased the land and decided to give it another go. Colonist-Native relations remained hostile, and after a decade of warring the Abenaki were no more. Thus, the town of Brunswick was established by 1739.
The towns judicious location by the Androscoggin River allowed for growth and prosperity by way of the sea. This newfound wealth afforded the creation of Bowdoin College in 1794. The river provided power for mills, and nearby forests were harvested for raw materials. Brunswick pumped out an increasing array of goods such as textiles, furniture, and foodstuffs throughout the 19th century.
Today many old mills and sea captains' mansions remain, the ornate structures have been repurposed and transformed into art galleries, restaurants, museums, inns, and boutiques. A modern visitor to Brunswick will find the memories of the past tastefully blended with the imagination of today.

By car[edit]
The only interstate running close-by to Brunswick is I-295. Well paved and graded, this two-lane highway branches off of I-95 just north of Portland. If you're approaching from the south, exit at US Route 1 or if you're coming from the north, watch for the US Route 201 exit instead. Both routes will run you straight into the city's center. It's about a 30 minute ride from Portland, 35 minutes from Lewiston, and 40 minutes from Augusta.
To the east, Route 1 also provides access to the dozens of quaint Mid-Coast communities scattered along the shoreline. Two minor roads; ME-123 and ME-24, provide connections to Harpswell and the Harpswell Islands respectively.

Get around[edit]
The Harriet Beecher Stowe House, just behind Park Row
Once in town, you'll find many of Brunswick's amenities concentrated along Maine Street, which basically runs you from the Androscoggin River in the north to Bowdoin College in the south. As such, the majority of all shops, restaurants, and museums can be accessed on foot.
If you want to get away from Maine Street and hit up nearby trails, having a car will really help out. You'll find a few options along Bath Road, which connects the modern and traditional city centers. On the off chance you didn't bring your own vehicle, rent one at the airport or use ride-hailing apps. Waiting times for pick-ups are a few minutes longer here than in the big city, but generally not a problem. Be wary of going too far into the sticks in a ride-hail; you could wind up without enough signal to request the return ride!
The only public transit to speak of is a single bus called The Brunswick Link. It runs once an hour during daylight hours and costs $2 a ride. The route is erratic, and it doesn't go anywhere interesting or particularly far; so for most visitors it's not recommended bothering with. It could be worth investigating, however, if you have mobility issues and don't have private transport.
There's little cycling infrastructure here to speak of, but on the plus side Maine's harsh winters afford wide shoulders on most roadways, and the traffic isn't that bad. Anyone with a modicum of road-riding experience should find themselves capable of navigating the streets of Brunswick.

Brunswick could be the perfect environment for experienced restaurateurs to branch out, try new things and follow their passions. Boston? Too expensive to take risks. Portland? Too much competition to expand. But here in Brunswick, chefs are finding a place to make all their own. You'll find a much wider variety of cuisines here than your average small town; French and Italian, Greek, Japanese, Chinese, Indian, Thai, Vietnamese, and so on. The food scene here is really elevating here, and yes, that does mean prices are creeping up; but it doesn't mean the old standbys are going anywhere. The classic drive-in spots still get crowded, and their filling fare is still enjoyed by newcomer and stalwart alike.
