Hotchkiss is a town in the Northwestern part of the Rocky Mountains state of Colorado. It is also a part of the West Elks American Viticultural Area (AVA), part of Colorado's Wine Country and home to the highest wine vineyards in North America.


Understand[edit]
The Uncompahgre Valley was the ancestral home of the Ute nation. But in the late 1870s, the lure of the gold and silver deposits in the San Juan Mountains to the south proved too great for the white settler population to resist. Tensions boiled over with the Meeker Massacre in 1879. Pushed to the breaking point by the Federal government's insistence that they give up their nomadic way of life and become farmers, the Utes killed several whites and launched the so-called Ute War. Initially successful, the Utes were forcibly relocated to Utah, and Southwestern Colorado, near Cortez.
Less than a year after the Meeker Massacre, the first prospective settlers ventured into the North Fork area. They were a small group of mineral speculators from the mining town of Lake City. Led by Enos Throop Hotchkiss, who had made his money by discovering the Golden Fleece mine at Lake City, Hotchkiss's party surreptitiously scouted the valley and picked out likely homesteads while the Utes were still in possession.
Hotchkiss died in 1900, just a few months before the settlement was incorporated as a town.
Hotchkiss built its economy on land development, coal, orchards and ranching. The coal is still mined today, a hard anthracite, "clean burning" coal much in demand for power plants around the country.
A sleepy town with a classic "Main Street" row of 19th- and early 20th-century storefronts, Hotchkiss is a rich agricultural area located in the foothills of the Grand Mesa. The rich soil is perfect for growing peaches, apples, cherries, as well as grapes.
By the late 20th century, grape growers had discovered the area's potential for raising white wine varietals, and Colorado's wine industry migrated south from Grand Junction and Palisade. The West Elks American Viticultural Area was formed in 2001. Ranging from 5,400 feet (1646 m) to 6,400 feet (1951 m) above sea level, West Elks comprises the highest vineyards in North America.
Hotchkiss is home to the Delta County Fair, a rodeo and festival held every August.
The town is just 9 mi (14 km) away from the small town of Paonia, which hosts the Cherry Days Festival every July.
