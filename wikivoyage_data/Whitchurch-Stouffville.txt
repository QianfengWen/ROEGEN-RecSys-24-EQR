York Region Transit operates only one route in Whitchurch-Stouffville. The Route is 9 Ninth Line, which forms a square routing in the town of Stouffville and follows Ninth Line south of the town.
The primary fare media used on the YRT is the Presto Card, which is also usable on many surrounding transit systems, on UP Express between Pearson Airport and downtown, and on GO Transit which provides regional rail and bus service (including service to Niagara Falls). Presto cards may be purchased at many local outlets, and at any staffed GO Transit station, The card costs $6.00, and can be loaded with any desired amount of money. To use the card, tap it on the green reader when entering a bus. A green light and a beep will confirm acceptance. If multiple YRT/VIVA vehicles are used to complete a one-way journey under two hours from your initial tap-on, only a single fare will be charged. Separate fares apply on other transit systems.

GO Transit[edit]
GO Buses operate during off-peak times when train service on the Stouffville Line does not operate.

By taxi[edit]
Taxis are generally not found on the roads; therefore they cannot be hailed from the street. In order to acquire a taxi, it is best to pre-book a trip using a phone or using the internet. 
Ride-share applications such as Uber and Lyft can also be used and are easier to acquire a ride compared to traditional taxis.

By bicycle[edit]
Cycling is possible throughout the municipality. 
It is a provincial law that cyclists under 18 must wear a helmet, and all riders must have a bike with reflectors and a bell. This is almost never enforced due to the low number of cyclists.
The YRT has taken measures to be welcoming of bicycles. All YRT/VIVA buses have easy to use bike racks.
Beware of right-turning vehicles when you enter an intersection. Drivers usually do not expect cyclists or pedestrians due to the low number of peds and cyclists. Therefore they may not look before they turn, as they only look for other cars.
