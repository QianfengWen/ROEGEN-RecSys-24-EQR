Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
From Boston take Interstate 93 South to Route 3 South to Exit 14 (Route 228).  At exit 14, go left and follow Route 228 north about 10 miles.
By public transit[edit]
The ferry is certainly the most scenic and interesting way to arrive; but the terminal is—let's say—austere. Although the views are great, no protection from the sun and elements mean you won't be hanging around long.

42.30348-70.920241 Hull Terminal (Hingham/Hull Ferry, F2H), 180 Main St. 8AM-6PM, varies. Ferry service connecting to Long Wharf in Boston. Certain routes also stop at Hingham and Logan Airport. Review the schedule, service runs year round with many more trips offered in summer. No connections to George's Island or the Boston Harbor Islands were offered from Hull in 2023, you'll have to connect through another station. Handicap accessible with a long ramp. No bicycle parking here, but bikes are allowed on MBTA ferries. $9.75 to Long Wharf, free parking (200 spots, resident only, strongly enforced). (updated May 2023)
The MBTA provides route 220 bus service from Quincy Center to Hingham, where you can connect with the 714 bus to Hull. The 714 runs every hour up and down the peninsula and connects with the ferry terminal at the end.

Get around[edit]
Map of Hull (Massachusetts)

Hull is a narrow peninsula and therefore has one major road in and out, Nantasket Avenue. Hull is surrounded by two waterfronts, the "beach side" and "bay side". Most neighborhood streets run in a grid-like fashion leading to either the bay or beach side, and cross over Nantasket Ave which runs down the middle of the peninsula. One can travel Nantasket Ave. all the way to the tip of Hull, known as Hull Gut, which is where the local high school, ferry and windmill are located. A good view of Boston proper can be seen across the channel.
