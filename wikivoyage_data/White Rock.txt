White Rock is a small community in Vancouver's southern suburbs surrounded on three sides by the city of Surrey, and to the south by the waters of Boundary Bay. The city is named for the 400-ton white rock that sits on the beach in the town centre. Its beach has long made it a weekend getaway for Vancouverites.

Areas immediately adjacent, and as far west as Crescent Beach are sometimes incorrect referred to as being within White Rock, but are actually in South Surrey.

White Rock town centre (Marine Drive along the beach) is at sea level, while the rest of the town is perched on a bench several hundred feet above. The town center is walkable but it is steep if you want to see other parts of the city.
The broader area — usually referred to as South Surrey but often referred to as White Rock — is quite large and will require a car to get to some areas. Translink operates bus service for all of Greater Vancouver. In White Rock and South Surrey most local buses are community shuttles. Most tourist areas of South Surrey are accessible by Translink.

By car[edit]
Parking[edit]
Most parking in White Rock is pay parking. The cost fluctuates but it is most expensive off Marine Drive by the beach ($3.75 per hour in high season). The new pay-by-space system makes buying or adding time simple. Just enter your space number on any nearby dispenser, pay, take your receipt and walk away. There's no need to return to your vehicle or place your ticket on your vehicle's dash.

The Beach[edit]
49.024724-122.8177661 White Rock Beach, Parallel to Marine Drive. A sandy beach, especially toward low tide.  The big white rock, that gives the community its name, is on the beach near the pier on Semiahmoo Bay between Blaine in Washington State and White Rock. Nineteenth-century sailors used this rock as a beacon. The White Rock is visible while entering customs coming into Canada from across the bay. Some people claim to have had luck on the lottery by rubbing their tickets on the 486-tonne boulder resting on the beach. White Rock Beach is the waterfront area of the City of White Rock in the southwest corner of the lower mainland of British Columbia, bordering Washington State.  
49.024724-122.8177662 White Rock Promenade, Parallel to Marine Drive between Bay Street and Finlay Street (north-west end is at Bay Street and Marine Drive). Free. 
49.016598-122.7901663 White Rock Promenade, south-east (Finlay Street) end, Marine Drive and Finlay Street (at the western tip of Semiahmoo Park). Free. 
White Rock has the largest and one of the most popular beaches in the Lower Mainland, located on the southern edge of the city alongside Marine Drive. The long sandy beach is perfect for everything from picnics to a game of frisbee. When the tide goes out there are many tidal pools that are left exposed and is a great place to see marine life up close. British Columbia's south coast is sheltered by Vancouver Island, because of this the water temperatures are relatively warm. If you don't want to walk in the sand, the White Rock Promenade stretches for 2.2 km (1.4 miles) next to Marine Drive.
The White Rock Promenade can be a pleasant dinnertime walk, especially at sunset, ideally with a low tide. Find a parking spot to the west part of Marine Drive, say near Bay St or Oxford Street. Walk eastwards down the beach. When you reach the pier, walk to end of it and back. Continue eastwards until the beachfront strip ends, at Finlay Street where Semiahmoo Park begins. There, you've done the nature/ocean thing. Now, cross Marine Drive. Walk back along the long line of restaurants, and get an idea from the vibe and the menus out front if you like them. Pick one for dinner, or make a reservation for later.

The Pier[edit]
49.020946-122.8057044 White Rock Pier, 15044 Marine Dr (Opposite Dolce Gelato). A pier that juts out nearly 500 meters from the shore. It is a popular place for a walk.

Restaurants in White Rock are split between those on the beach, usually offering patios and ocean views, typically on Marine Drive; and restaurants in the main commercial area away from the water.

Stay safe[edit]
If you are visiting the White Rock's beach or pier, pay attention for trains while crossing the tracks and do not walk or jog along the tracks.  A number of people, especially people distracted by wearing headphones, have walked or jogged on or over the busy tracks without paying attention for trains and have died due to being run over by trains.
