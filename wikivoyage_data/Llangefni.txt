By bicycle[edit]
The best way to get around town and the island itself, when not on foot.

By foot[edit]
Most attractions are outside the town, therefore alternative transport is needed.

By car[edit]
Car services can be called for attractions that cannot be reached by the previous two forms of transportation.

Do[edit]
Today, Llangefni offers vacationers shopping, catching a rugby match on one of the T.V.'s in one of the local pubs, go on a golf outing at one of the local courses, as well as just take some time to relax.
