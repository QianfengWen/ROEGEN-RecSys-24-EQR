Rathlin Island (In Irish Reachlainn) is an island historically part of County Antrim in Northern Ireland. Those counties have been abolished so it's now part of Causeway Coast and Glens District; it's Northern Ireland's only inhabited island with a population in 2011 of 154. 


Understand[edit]
The ferry leaving Rathlin harbour
Rathlin was created by the same outpouring of lava that formed Giant's Causeway, and its sea cliffs and bird life are its main attractions. It's poor land for farming, and its outlying position made it vulnerable to raids by Vikings and others. Outcasts such as Robert the Bruce of Scotland have occasionally taken refuge here, only to bring down murderous reprisals upon the entire population. In the 18th century it was briefly industrial thanks to kelp, then morphed in Victorian times into a tourist resort.
In 2021 a five-year project was launched to rid the island of its rats and ferrets, to protect the ground-nesting birds.

Visitor information[edit]
Rathlin Island visitor information website
Get in[edit]
Rathlin Island Ferries sail from Ballycastle to Rathlin Island four or five times daily, taking 30 min. There are two vessels: Kintra II is for foot passengers (no luggage), Spirit of Rathlin also carries vehicles. Visitors may not bring vehicles (see Ballycastle for long stay car parks) but passengers with restricted mobility or luggage should use the car ferry. Bicycles must be booked, and dogs on leads are welcome. Single fares are adult £8, child £4, bicycle £2.20.
55.293-6.1941 Church Bay is the ferry pier and only settlement on the island. A draughty perspex bus shelter is the only semblance of a "passenger terminal", and there are no toilets.

Get around[edit]

Kilmeer is the hilly west arm of the island, five miles long. In the middle is the settlement of Church Bay, then Kinkeel is the low-lying south arm, three miles long. A tarmac lane runs the length of the island, single track with passing places. You can hike it all, and bicycles can be hired from Soerneog View Hostel.
In summer the Puffin Bus meets the ferry and charges £6 for a "tour", including a one-hour stop at the RSPB Seabird Centre at the west tip. This "tour" may or may not bother to drive you back.

There's a standing stone and a burial cist in the fields by McCuaig's Bar.
Kelp House is the ruin at the south end of the bay, built circa 1750. Until 1820, kelp was valuable as its ash contained sodium carbonate for making soap and glass, though you needed over 400 tons of seaweed to get one ton of sodium carbonate. The price crashed when the Leblanc Process created it much more cheaply; kelp was still needed as a source of iodine but many remote coastal communities lost their livelihood.
Church of the Immaculate Conception
 St Thomas' Church, 3 Churchquarter BT54 6RT, ☏ +44 28 2076 0079. This Church of Ireland church dates from 1812 and is named for St Thomas Lindsay of Armagh.

The graveyard is for all denominations; here lies Rev John Gage, who bought the island in 1746. War graves hold the crew of HMS Viknor, lost in Jan 1915 probably sunk by a mine, and HMS Racoon, which hit the rocks in Jan 1918.

Go next[edit]
Back to Ballycastle it must be.
From there either track east along the mainland coast to the big attractions of Carrick-a-Rede Bridge, Giant's Causeway and Bushmills, or southeast to the Antrim Glens.
The Copeland islands were inhabited until 1996 when the lighthouse was automated. Reach them by boat trip from Donaghadee near  Bangor, County Down.
