Fredericksburg's historic downtown
Fredericksburg is a city nearly halfway between Washington, D.C., and Richmond, Virginia.


Understand[edit]
Fredericksburg was founded in colonial era as a port city on the Rappahannock River—the fifth longest river in Virginia. At the time, it was at the farthest point navigable by large ships trading goods with the Old World. Although the city became a key trading center for the plantation owners and farmers nearby, it never achieved the level of commerce enjoyed by Richmond and Alexandria.
The city was contested during the American Civil War, changing hands numerous times between Union and Confederate forces.  In the most famous battle in Fredericksburg, Union General Burnside repeatedly marched thousands of his troops across the Rappahannock River and up Marye's Heights to their doom.
The population  of Fredericksburg and surrounding communities has boomed as housing costs closer to Washington, DC, has forced commuters to seek neighborhoods farther out.  Many living in Fredericksburg drive up to two hours or catch the VRE commuter rail to work in DC.  Fredericksburg is also a popular home for military families employed by the nearby Quantico Marine and Dahlgren Naval bases.
The downtown area has experienced a revival since the 1970s allowing a strong arts community to thrive.  Galleries, music venues, and fine dining can all be found in the historic district.  While the city has seen massive growth, the downtown area and battlefields have been well preserved due to strong local commitment to historic preservation, providing a unique blend of old and new culture.

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
One Amtrak train station serves Fredericksburg at Caroline St. and Lafayette Blvd., which is a stop for Amtrak's Carolinian and Piedmont and Regional trains.

 Virginia Railway Express. Commuter trains for Fredericksburg's Amtrak station leave Union Station in Washington, DC on weekdays from 7:20AM to 7:05PM. The trip from DC takes approximately an hour and a half, depending on freight train schedules and track work. A single ticket from Union Station is $12.15 ($6.05 for seniors and Americans with disabilities). Discounts are offered for ten-trip, five-day, and monthly passes. VRE does not run on federal holidays but does run special service on Independence Day. (updated Dec 2019)

By car[edit]
Fredericksburg is about fifty miles south of Washington D.C. located directly on Interstate 95 at exit 130.  It is also one hour north of Richmond on Interstate 95.
Travel time from the north (Washington, DC) will vary due to traffic conditions (avoid rush hour). Between 2:30PM and 7PM, typical travel times to Fredericksburg are 1½-2½ hours.  Alternative routes include taking either State Highway 28 through Manassas to US Route 17, or by taking US Route 29 through Warrenton to US Route 17.  Both routes take about an hour and a half, but the traffic is much more bearable and most of the trip consists of rural driving at full speed.
Another alternative to I-95 South from Fairfax is to take the following routes:

Chancellorsville Battlefield
Fairfax County Parkway to Hwy 123
Hwy 123 South to right on Hwy 641 (Chapel Rd)
Hwy 641 to left on Hwy 610 (Wolf Run Shoals Rd)
Hwy 610 to right on Hwy 643 (Henderson Rd)
Hwy 643 to left on Hwy 612 (Old Yates Ford Rd)
Left onto Hwy 3000 (Prince William Parkway)
Right onto Hwy 642 (Hoadly Rd)
Left onto Hwy 234 (Dumfries Rd)
Right onto Bristow Rd
Left onto Hwy 646 (Aden Rd)
Left onto Fleetwood Drive
Left onto Hwy 612 (Brent Town Rd)
Straight onto Hwy 610 (Garrisonville Rd)
Right onto Hwy 648 (Shelton Shop Rd)
Left onto Hwy 630 (Courthouse Rd)
Exit onto I-95 South
This way takes about 2 hours, but you avoid the stop-and-go traffic from the mixing bowl (I-95/I-495 interchange) all the way to the Express Lanes merge (just south of the Garrisonville/Aquia Exit). You also avoid the bottleneck on Hwy 123 at Occoquan. As of 2021 the Express Lanes are being extended another 10 miles into Fredericksburg, and are expected to open to traffic in 2022. This along with other projects along I-95 should help speed up the drive to and from Fredericksburg.

By bus[edit]
Greyhound buses stop at 1400 Jefferson Davis Hwy.

Get around[edit]
Downtown Fredericksburg is a walking city - the sidewalks are wide, inviting, and mostly paved in brick.  Many locals frequent the streets as well as the occasional street musician.
Biking downtown can be fun, but stay off the sidewalks and be sure to follow the traffic laws.
Taking the local bus (known as the Fred) is convenient and inexpensive.  There are stops throughout downtown, at all major surrounding shopping locations, and most local subdivisions.  Racks on the front of the buses allow you to take a bike along for the ride. Fare is 75 cents for adults, children under three ride free.  Schedules and route planning can be found at the official website, ridefred.com
Driving is a good option. Downtown roads are largely straightforward aside from some non-standard intersections and one-way streets; outside the city numerous signs point to places of interest and major through ways. If possible, avoid driving during rush hour as  traffic is intolerable, especially on I-95, US-1, US-3, and US-17.  There is plenty of free parking downtown, either on the street or in the many public lots (PDF map). During normal business hours (8AM-5PM), much of the street parking has a two-hour time limit, after which cars will be ticketed. Parking at a city-owned garage at 600 Sophia Street is free for the first two hours.  After that, the rates vary, but they are roughly $1 per hour, $8 or less per day.

Do[edit]
Canoeing or Kayaking on the Rappahannock River.[1] The river can be very dangerous if you are not careful.  There have been many drownings since the early 1960s.  It is not unheard of at least one or two drownings to occur along the river each year.  Therefore, if you decide to go adventure on the Rappahannock River, be sure to check out the safety information and water levels before you begin your adventure[2].
Hiking along the Rappahannock River near Francis Thornton's Mill just off of Riverside Drive on the south bank of the river, upstream of the US-1 bridge. It is also possible to hike up along the canal to where the old Embrey Dam used to be.  There are a network of hiking/biking trails all the way up along the river, well past the I-95 bridge.  Beware when hiking through the quarry, that there are "No Trespassing" signs posted.  As tempting as it would be on a hot day, do not swim in the quarry, lest you want to run the risk of meeting Frederiskburg's Finest.  If merely hiking through the area, it is unlikely you'll be hassled, however.  If you hike up the river far enough, you may be able to get a glimpse of some of the old canal locks.
Golfing at any of the several nearby golf courses, such as Meadow Farms, Cannon Ridge, or Lees Hill.

Drink[edit]
Downtown[edit]
Downtown Fredericksburg may not be huge, but due to the presence of a college and a fun-loving local crowd from both the city and the surrounding counties, it does have a good number of decent places to catch a drink.  Catering to those who want a relatively low-key atmosphere to catch up with friends and to those who simply want to let loose and get drunk, there should be something for everyone.  A good route for a downtown bar crawl: start at Capitol Ale House for some good beers and burgers; hit Spirit's for a can of PBR; stop by J. Brian's for a pint of Guinness; then check the scene at Fatty J's, Brock's or The Colonial Tavern, and stop in if they're hopping and let loose.

38.30328-77.4602961 The Bourbon Room, 216 William St. Located above Cafe New Orleans, the Bourbon Room is where a lot of locals hang out. 
38.299544-77.455392 Brock's, 503 Sophia St. Rather fancy dining by day, full scale bar scene at night.  Another local hang out full of mini-reunions, especially in the summer when the spacious outdoor deck is open and the DJ is spinning.

Casual upscale atmosphere, great for big groups, darts and board games are freely available in back.  Lots of weekly specials on food and drink.  On Friday nights, they tap a firkin (wooden barrel of beer), it's a great way to enjoy traditional brews. 
38.297657-77.458954 Colonial Tavern, 406 Lafayette Blvd, ☏ +1 540 373-1313. Irish-themed pub, regularly features karaoke and live music, sometimes features touring acts. 
38.301537-77.4585635 J Brian's Tap Room, 200 Hanover St, ☏ +1 540 373-0738. As the name implies, this place is serious about what's on tap.  With not a bottled beer in sight, they instead sport 23 selections of lagers, stouts, ales, ciders, and pilsners. Quirky decor and a great jukebox make this a good late night hangout. 
38.312658-77.466536 KC's Music Alley, 1917 Princess Anne St, ☏ +1 540 371-0300. Catering mostly to the metal/punk crowd, KC's is a huge music venue located in a seedier part of town.  Plenty of pool tables, poker tournaments, and other bar novelties are featured. 
 Recreation Center, 213 William St, ☏ +1 540 371-6498. A local favorite affectionately known as "The Rec Center," this dive of a pool hall serves up hot dogs and cold PBR.

Bowman's Center[edit]
38.279456-77.4475379 Adventure South, 3300 Dill Smith Drive, ☏ +1 540 371-7799. Fredericksburg's local microbrewery located a mile south of downtown off of US Route 2 in an industrial park. Lee's Retreat is their in-house restaurant, many refillable growlers are available. Free tours of the brewery (including samples) are available from W 2-6PM, F 3-8PM, and Sa 10AM-1PM. 
Central Park[edit]
While downtown is far more charming, inviting and local, if you are more into the strip-mall bar scene, Central Park (Route 3 West, just outside of the city) has several places to go hang out, not all of which are totally generic. Yes, Central Park has its fair share of dime-a-dozen joints like TGI Friday's, Applebee's and Ruby Tuesday's; but do yourself a favor and skip them in favor of these places:

 Bailey's, 1861 Carl D Silver Parkway. Somewhat generic strip-mall chain sports bar, which still manages to maintain a decent atmosphere. Good wings. 
 Buffalo Wild Wings, 1638 Carl D Silver Parkway. Another place that is quickly becoming ubiquitous as locations open up all over the country, but like Cheeseburger in Paradise, Fredericksburg had one of the first locations. Very large, massive and excellent flavor list to go on rather mediocre wings, and plenty of cheap booze and televisions playing every sport on at any given moment. Gets particularly packed during football season, mainly for Redskins and Virginia Tech games. 
 Q Ball Cafe, 960 Bragg Rd (in front of Spotsylvania Towne Centre). Noon-2AM. Large pool hall located across Route 3 from Central Park, next to the main entrance of the Spotsylvania Towne Centre (aka "the mall"). Features your basic pool-hall fare, lots of fried food and cheap drinks. Texas Hold'em tournaments on Sunday, Monday, Wednesday and Thursday (no buy-in, since paid table games are illegal in Virginia, but they do feature a $50 cash prize), Karaoke on Friday, live music on Saturday. 
Sleep[edit]

Go next[edit]
George Washington's boyhood home, Ferry Farm[dead link], is located across the river in Stafford county.
Many other sites of historical interest are a short drive away, including Spotsylvania Courthouse[dead link].
Lake Anna is about 20 miles or so outside of town, which is a popular boating and fishing destination.  The Lake Anna State Park offers some 15 miles of hiking trails, a beach on the lake, picnic areas, and camping.
A trip down to Kings Dominion, which is a large theme park a mere 35 miles to the south along I-95, is worth a day to see and experience.  In decent traffic, it takes around a half an hour to get there from Fredericksburg.  The park features many roller coasters and other rides, including some world class rides such as Volcano, the Blast Coaster and the Dominator.
About 20 miles (32 km) to the north along I-95 is the awesome National Marine Corps Museum near the Quantico Marine Corps Base.  This museum features all kinds of interactive displays detailing the history and evolution of the United States Marine Corps.
For those that love to shop, Potomac Mills, one of the largest outlet malls in the country is only about 1/2 hour or so to the north (assuming decent traffic).  There are more than 220 outlet stores in this place, so all kinds of options for the shopping fanatic.  There are also several restaurants as well as an 18-screen movie theater.
About and hour and half west of town is the Shenandoah National Park, which includes over 500 miles (800 km) of hiking trails, and camping.  If you are not the hiking nor camping type, at the very least, a drive down Skyline Drive can be worthwhile to check out some of the incredible views.  During the peak of the fall colors (later part of October to the first part of November), it can get pretty crowded.
During the winter, there are two places within 2 hours of Fredericksburg to go skiing, Wintergreen Resort and Massanutten.  Massanutten also has the added benefit of an indoor waterpark, featuring one of the east coast's only Flowriders. During the summer months, there is also an outdoor section with a wavepool and additional slides available. These resorts also feature golfing, fitness centers, and spas. Either one would be a worthwhile get-a-way. If you are willing to go even farther, there are other places that offers skiing that are within a few hours of driving from Fredericksburg.
