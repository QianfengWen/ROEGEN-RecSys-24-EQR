Not to be confused with Boulder City, the town in Nevada near the Hoover Dam.

Boulder is a college town of about 106,000 in the Front Range region of Colorado.  The home of the University of Colorado, the city has a reputation for progressive values and outdoor recreation. It is a very pleasant place to live and visit.

These days, Boulder wears several hats: as a university town, home of the University of Colorado Boulder and others; as a hi-tech town that is rapidly spawning bedroom communities in outlying farm towns; and as a center of alternate culture, with various new age institutions, Naropa University, meditation centers, Buddhist centers, and the like.  What perhaps distinguishes it most from other cities of similar size in the United States, however, is its status as a mecca for serious athletes, many of whom have made their home here for the conditioning advantages of high altitude, combined with businesses, facilities, and a community that provides opportunities for serious training and competition. Even the average nine-to-five Boulderite is much more likely than the average American to be a serious climber, cyclist, runner, skier, etc., and you will see the difference as you're about town.
Boulder is in the Front Range region of Colorado and is virtually adjacent to Denver, except for its buffer of Open Space Parks which border the city and provide it shelter from its growing surroundings.  This reflects that it is the "front door" to the mountainous country to the west, with many outdoor attractions, including a medium-sized ski resort less than an hour from the city limits, and also the fact that there are significant cultural differences between Boulder and Denver beyond its liberal politics.
Boulder is known for its outdoors and the residents with one of the healthiest lifestyles in America. It is very true, no matter what the weather, there are always people outdoors; running, biking, walking, hiking. It has a great atmosphere and beautiful sights.
Living in Boulder is very expensive. Along with being one of the most active towns in America, it is right up there with the living expense. Smaller towns are popping up around Boulder that are cheaper, but may take 10–15 minutes to get into this vibrant town.
Downtown Boulder covers a large area, with the Pearl Street Mall (see below) at its core. Downtown features shopping, eating, and entertainment for all ages. Be sure to check out the restaurants on Walnut Street, between 9th Street and Broadway, as they offer several good options just off the Pearl Street Mall. Also check out the West End of Pearl Street, between 8th Street and the Pearl Street Mall, as it offers additional shopping and more restaurant options. For home furnishings, make sure to check out Pearl Street's East End, from the Pearl Street Mall to 20th Street. Stop by the Boulder Farmers Market on 13th St, between Canyon and Arapaho Avenues, on Saturday mornings and Wednesday evenings- an experience not to miss.
As you stroll down Pearl Street, there are many street performers (when the weather is nice). One of the most famous is the "zip-code man" this is one performance not to miss. He knows every zip code throughout the entire world and there is always a huge crowd around him. Other performers include magicians, mimes, and other assortments of crazy acts. Pearl Street is always somewhere to find live entertainment. Make sure to come at the right time though, usually in the winter the performers are not out, obviously.
University Hill a small area west of Broadway across from the main campus of the University of Colorado at Boulder. Commonly referred to as 'The Hill,' the area caters to college students with a variety of restaurants and bars, and services such as barbershops, bookstores, and coffee houses. There are also several entertainment venues that showcase up-and-coming talent from around the world.

Get in[edit]
Boulder is easily reached from Denver International Airport via car or bus. Boulder is roughly 30 miles (50 km) from Denver, and is an easy drive via US highway 36. The drive is pretty spectacular, with beautiful scenery as you drive straight toward the Rocky Mountains. The Regional Transportation District (RTD) operates bus service to and around Boulder and is a clean, safe, and easy way to get to town; the Skyride 'AB' bus runs hourly between Denver International Airport and Boulder, while the Flatiron Flyer offers fast service along express highway lanes between Boulder and Denver.

Get around[edit]
40°1′23″N 105°15′18″WMap of Boulder
Mass transit[edit]
Boulder and Denver share a common mass transit system, known as RTD. which won "Best Public Transportation" in a nationwide survey in 2008.  You will also notice that a lot of locals use bicycles to get around the downtown (most of the city sights are within 2 miles). Many locals use the "Skyride" RTD bus to get to and from the airport.  It's greener and easier.

By car[edit]
If you choose to drive around town, be aware that there is heavy traffic on the main thoroughfares, high numbers of pedestrians (cyclists) and parking downtown can be a bit tight.  There are a number of city-owned garages tucked behind the buildings downtown.  Keep your eyes open for the large green "P" signs outside their entrance ramps, as they don't look like parking garages from the outside.  Be careful when parking in the university area, as tickets can be quite expensive.  Boulder's police are vigilant about drunk driving, so keep out of the car when you find yourself tipping down a local microbrew or two.  Watch carefully for the school zones:  when the yellow lights are flashing, slow down to 20 mph. Many of the main streetlights have cameras that can capture you running the tail end of yellow lights. Watch out, or you may get tickets in the mail!

By bike[edit]
 Boulder B-Cycle. Bike sharing program with stations downtown and near campus. Unlimited rides under 30 minutes. $8/24 hours; $20/7 days..

Stay safe[edit]
Crime and personal safety[edit]
Boulder has a very low crime rate and has no bad neighborhoods, but use common sense. University Hill, which is bordered by Baseline, Broadway, and Canyon can become raucous in the evenings, especially on weekends. Downtown Boulder, especially at night, is frequented by panhandlers, who can be aggressive at times but are not dangerous. Aggressive panhandling is illegal in Boulder, and you may report it to the police. Throughout the hiking trails near university property, Boulder has black posts lit with a blue light that have emergency phones in them that only dial 911. It is not advised for women to walk alone after 1 AM on the hill or near Pearl St. Mall. Boulder has also had reports of violence against Asians.

Outdoors[edit]
Boulder has a dry climate and during any season, dehydration can be a problem for visitors and residents alike. Drink plenty of water. If you go hiking in the evening, bring two quarts of water. At night, temperatures drop remarkably, so bring warm clothing if you'll be out at night. (This is true even during summer months.) Be aware of mountain lions while hiking.

Go next[edit]
There are a lot of opportunities for outdoor recreation.  Go to the Gallery map store or to the Boulder Bookstore and buy maps and a guide.
Local favorites include the Anne U White hiking trail, the Chatauqua trails, White Rock, Eagle Trail, Boulder Creek, Dowdy Draw, Green Mountain, and Walker Ranch.
For skiers and snowboarders, the closest resort is Eldora, near Nederland, Colorado. It takes about 45–60 minutes to drive there from Downtown.  The 'N' RTD Bus to Nederland runs to Eldora during ski season.
