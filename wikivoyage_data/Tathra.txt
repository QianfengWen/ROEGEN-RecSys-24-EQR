Do[edit]
 The Beach (it's the bit where the sea stops at the land; you can't miss it, really). 24/7. A pretty good beach. It is very long, but only has lifeguards at the southern end. That end of the beach can get a little crowded because of this, but not to any extreme level and it should be easy to find a spot some space away from anyone else. Good surf and adequate shops make this one of the better beaches to spend a day. Tathra Beach looking towards Surf Life Saving Club. Free.

Eat[edit]
 Fat Tony's Bar & Grill, 15 Bega Street (Between the catholic church and the pub), ☏ +61 2 6494 4550. Tu-Sa lunch and dinner. An awesome restaurant with steaks that melt in your mouth. A real surprise for a restaurant in such a sleepy village, Fat Tony's Bar & Grill has a great menu selection. Two minuses to this place are the price, which while fantastic value probably rules out regular visits for a few people. The second minus is the beer. A good selection, but in true Australian fashion comes at just above freezing, is a low volume and tasteless. In defence of Fat tony's, this is Australia and so is to be expected. 
Drink[edit]
