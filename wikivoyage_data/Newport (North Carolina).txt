Newport is a small town just outside the Crystal Coast region of North Carolina, situated on the scenic Newport River. Because it's inland, away from the touristy coastal area, and doesn't have much in the way of attractions, Newport remains a mostly residential community. However, it's in the Croatan National Forest, so if you want a convenient base to reach both the beach and the woods, Newport might be the ideal spot.


Get in[edit]
Newport is right on US-70, between Havelock and Morehead City. As with the rest of the region, it's about a 3-hour drive from Raleigh.

Get around[edit]
Being a rural town, Newport has no public transportation to speak of. Bring your car; you'll need it to get here anyway.

See[edit]
When you leave the Crystal Coast, the rest of Carteret County is taken up by the Croatan National Forest. Newport is in the southeastern corner of it; the larger town of Havelock, to the north, is smack in the middle. It contains elevated swamp habitat, salt marsh, estuaries and carnivorous plants. The White Oak, Neuse and Newport rivers flow through the forest. As activities go, there are plenty of boat ramps, canoeing areas, fishing spots and trails, some of them self-guided.

Do[edit]
At the end of March, Newport hosts the Newport Pig Cookin' Contest in the community park, an annual tradition since 1978. Over 80 cooks, armed with their own secret sauces, grill a whole pig in the hopes of winning a cash prize.
 Little Doo Mud Bog, 678 Tom Mann Rd, ☏ +1 252-223-4604. One of the more unusual activities in the Crystal Coast area, Little Doo Mud Bog offers entertainment for the entire family, centered around a wide muddy track. Adults can bring trucks or buggies to race, and there's also a smaller track where kids can race in toy trucks. There's a race every Saturday at 6PM; Gates open at 3PM. $7 (adults), free for kids 12 and under. 
Outside Newport, near the community of Mill Creek where the Newport River widens out to meet the Bogue Sound, people often take their boats out to go shrimping, or harvest fresh oysters.
