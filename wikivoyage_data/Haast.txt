SH6 offers beautiful vistas of the Tasman Sea and travels through rainforests. The Haast River Bridge just to the north of the town is also the longest single-lane bridge in the Southern Hemisphere, which also contains two passing bays. Priority for this bridge is for southbound traffic.

Get around[edit]

The Haast region consists of more than 2500 km² of one of the world's most diverse and spectacular landscapes. In 1990 this area was internationally recognised as a location of significant natural value and became the centre piece of Te Wahipounamu - South West New Zealand World Heritage Area.
The Haast is the perfect destination to explore some of New Zealand's most unique scenery and wildlife. Most of which can be found in neighbouring Mount Aspiring National Park.
