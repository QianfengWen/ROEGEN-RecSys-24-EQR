Festival de las Flores in Mazamitla
Mazamitla is a 1,000-year-old small town in the mountains of Jalisco, Mexico. With its abundant forests and rugged terrain, it is a popular weekend destination for active outdoorsmen and for young couples looking for a romantic small town getaway. The town has been designated as one of Mexico's Pueblos Mágicos.


Understand[edit]
The town of Mazamitla was founded by the Aztecs in 1165, conquered by the Purhepecha 300 years later, and a century later,  conquered by the Spanish conquistadors. It's a peaceful place today, with very little conquering going on, but a lot of cool mountain air and cool traditional vibes. About 8,000 people live in the town itself with another 3,000 or so in the outlying farms and villages that are part of the greater municipal area.
The town is set in a mountainous area known as the Sierra del Tigre. Most of the landscape is pine forest hills. The highest mountain in the area is about 2800 meters (the two highest points are Cerro El Jackal and Cerro del Tigre). The climate is warm in the summer, but quite cool in fall, winter and spring.  You'll want a jacket in the evening, which can get downright cold. The area has several springs, streams and rivers in it. The area gets quite a bit of natural rainfall with the wettest months from June through October. The mountain forests have quite a bit of biodiversity, from deer to porcupines, while bird watchers can find more than 100 avian species living in the pine and oak forests, including wild turkeys (which the locals call guajolote) and chachalaca.

Get in[edit]
Map of Mazamitla
The town is located about 140 km from Guadalajara, south of Lake Chapala.

By bus[edit]
Mazamitla has frequent bus service to and from Guadalajara through Autotransportes Mazamitla. It is a second-class bus line with older buses that are often dirty and that stop frequently in every small town and anyplace someone on the side of the road waves a hat. As a result, the trip takes almost 3 hours. Tickets cost M$150 (Nov 2023).

19.919637-103.0182191 Estacion Autotransportes Mazamitla (bus station), Calle 16 Septiembre 34, La Gloria. Small bus terminal in the heart of downtown. Use the restrooms in the waiting area because the buses don't have on-board loos. 
Get around[edit]
Uber and its fellow ride-hailing apps don't work in Mazamitla, but local taxis work, though there aren't enough to meet demand when weekenders arrive. Sitios are outside the bus station and in the town center at the zocalo. Fortunately, the town is small, compact, and very easily walkable, though you will want a taxi or a tour to visit the nearby forests, dam, and the El Salto waterfall.

See[edit]
Parroquia San Cristobal
19.915712-103.0211751 Parroquia San Cristobal (St Christopher Church), Gomez Farias 4, Centro. Strikingly unique church that looks historic but was actually built in the 20th century.

The town's main square is a lively central plaza with manicured trees and shrubbery, a bandstand, iron benches along paved walkways, and lined with shops and historic buildings including the Palacio Municipal and the big colorful letters spelling out the town's name, just waiting for you to snap the selfie and post to Instagram. 
Do[edit]
 Cascada el Salto. Scenic 50-meter-high waterfall that involves a brisk hike along cobblestone roads going past woodland cabins in the Los Cazos area, then the trail continues along the river to get to the falls. If you don't want to hike, you can rent a horse for M$250, though you may still need to do some walking. There are pools near the falls where you can swim. M$30 (Nov 2023). 
 Valle de Juarez. Nearby village with a dam and lake where you can ride trajineras (flat wooden boats like those used in Xochimilco). 
Outdoor activities in the nearby forests include: hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking, climbing, and zip lining. Tours in town can be arranged that include guided trips to these places by horse or in safari trucks or ATVs.
