Once on the cape there is another option. The Cape Cod Regional Transit Authority as few viable options. The H2O bus goes from Hyannis to Orleans and traveling down Route 28. It takes about an hour and half from start to stop, but this is also doable. In Harwich you can catch the FLEX bus that takes you to Proviencetown.

See[edit]
 Historic Beech Tree, 599 Main Street (See Twisted Tree/Beech Bar under the Eat section). The legends and lore surrounding this English Weeping Beech are almost as enormous as the tree itself. Supposedly gifted to Barnstable in 1776 by the local British Governor as a reward for loyalty to the Crown, the tree was instructed "to be planted in the center of commerce". Later that year, coincidentally, Barnstable was the only town on the Cape that did not vote for independence. Whether the vote was a result of that gift, or due to a vicious beating of local patriot James Otis, the world will never know. Either way, the tree is now at the base of a local watering hole, so kick back and have a drink in the shade of history! (updated Jun 2018)
