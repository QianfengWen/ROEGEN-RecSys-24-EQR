Winkler is a city of about 12,500 people (2016) in the Pembina Valley of Central Manitoba. Along with the neighbouring community of Morden, it is the centre of a richly productive agricultural area, and home to a large Mennonite community.


Understand[edit]
European settlement of the area began in 1874 when German-speaking Mennonites from Russia began settling in the area. In 1996, two-thirds of its inhabitants claimed German heritage.
Winkler is the economic hub of southern Manitoba.  Approximately 30% of the work force is employed in the industrial sector. The city's second-largest employer, employing 20% of the work force, is the health and education sector.
Winkler's agricultural sector is one of the most productive and diversified in Manitoba. The area surrounding Winkler is home to rich, fertile soils which are especially suited to growing potatoes. However, many other crops are grown in the area, including wheat, canola, corn and beans. The area's livestock operations also continue to grow; hogs and cattle are raised, while dairy farms contribute to the making of cheese.
Winkler's climate is typically continental, resulting in dry cold winters and hot, frequently dry summers. Summer temperatures typically range from 20 to 30 °C, while winter temperatures average between -15 and -25 °C. Winkler receives an annual average of 416 mm of precipitation (most of which falls during the spring and summer months) and 119.7 cm of snow.
