Baie Comeau is a city that is approximately 420 km (260 mi) north-east of Quebec City in the Manicouagan region of the province of Quebec. It is on the shores of the Saint Lawrence River near the mouth of the Manicouagan River, and is the seat of Manicouagan Regional County Municipality. 


Understand[edit]
St-Pancrace Bay
The municipality had a population of 21,500 in 2016, which has declined from 25,500 in 1996. The population is  roughly split between two urban area population centres within the city limits: Baie-Comeau proper and Hauterive.
The city is named after the adjacent Comeau Bay, which is named in honour of Napoléon-Alexandre Comeau, a Québécois naturalist. Baie-Comeau is the birthplace of former Prime Minister of Canada Brian Mulroney.

History[edit]
Baie-Comeau proper (the eastern part of the current town) was founded in 1936 when a paper mill was constructed by Colonel Robert R. McCormick, publisher of the Chicago Tribune. Experiencing remarkable growth, the Town of Baie-Comeau was incorporated the following year. The area continued to see economic development with the establishment of the hydro-electric power stations on the Manicouagan and Outardes Rivers beginning with the Chutes-aux-Outardes Station in 1952, an aluminum smelter in 1958, and grain warehouses (the largest in Canada) in 1959.

Climate[edit]
In July, the average daily high is near 21°C (70°F) but at night it cools down to a temperature near 10°C (50°F).
In January, the average daily high is about -9°C (16°F) but at night it cools down to a temperature near -20°C (-4°F).
No matter when in the year you go, you should always bring a jacket. Temperatures can deviate significantly from the average, so be prepared.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Baie-Comeau is five to six hours beyond Québec City on Québec Route 138. As there is no railway, the main option is to come by car.
From Quebec City, take Autoroute 440-E until it becomes Quebec Route 138. Drive about 400 km until you arrive in Baie Comeau. Visitors from Montréal or points westward on the Trans-Canada Highway will arrive in Québec City on Autoroute 40 (as the last bridge on the St. Lawrence is west of the city), then follow the north shore from there.
From Chicoutimi-Jonquière and Lac-Saint-Jean go to Chicoutimi Nord, where Québec Route 172 follows the north shore of the Saguenay river to Tadoussac. From there, Québec Route 138 leads 200 km downriver to Baie-Comeau.
From Atlantic Canada, take the Trans-Canada Highway westward to Rivière-du-Loup, then cross the St. Lawrence River by ferry to reach Route 138 on the north shore. (From New Brunswick's Acadian Coast, an alternative route is to enter at Campbellton-Pointe à la Croix, take QC132 through Amqui to Rimouski or Matane, then cross the St. Lawrence by ferry.)
Baie-Comeau is also the southern end of Quebec Route 389 which connects with Fermont (567 km away) and the Trans-Labrador Highway (573 km away).  Travel from Labrador City, Newfoundland and Labrador is about 588 km away and involves taking Highway 500 (Trans-Labrador Highway) southwest until it crosses into Quebec and becomes Quebec Route 389.
