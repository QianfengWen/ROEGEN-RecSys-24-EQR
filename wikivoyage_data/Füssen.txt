Schloss Neuschwanstein near Füssen in 2013
Füssen in Allgäu is an enchanting town in the south of Bavaria, Germany known for the Hohes Schloss and its Basilica and former Benedictine monastery of St Mang.  The world famous Neuschwanstein Castle is situated a few kilometres to the east. Some visitors come to tour the castles and leave immediately afterwards leaving the beautiful little town unexplored.  This is a great pity as there is much to see in Füssen and the surrounding area if you know what you are looking for! There are magnificent lakes with beautiful views and the "Kalvarienberg" which has the "Stations of the Cross" on it.

Map of Füssen
Füssen is small enough that a car is not really needed. There is a bus to the castles and the trains to Munich and Augsburg and the old town is easy enough to access by foot. You can walk to Neuschwanstein and Hochschwangau castles via some marked roads; travel times posted on the signboards are comfortable over-estimates.
There are some great areas nearby, like some of the lesser-known castles, which would be easier to reach with your own car. It is possible to rent a car in Füssen.
Another alternative is to rent a mountain bike. There are numerous shops, one even right at the train station. Füssen has invested a lot into developing a network of bike routes and paths to make biking easier.
