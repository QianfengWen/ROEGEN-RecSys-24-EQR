Nashik  (Marathi: नाशिक Nāśik) is a city in the state of Maharashtra with a population of about 2.3 million people (2023). This is an ancient holy city, also known as the Wine Capital of India, part of the Mumbai - Pune - Nashik so-called "golden triangle of Maharashtra". It is a city of pilgrimage for many Hindus, important for Hindu rituals for the afterlife offerings, and also one of the four locations of the Kumbha Mela festival.


Understand[edit]
Nashik city has grown rapidly in the last five years encompassing all the villages around it.
Nashik is one of the world's holiest Hindu cities. Kumbhmela is held here once in 12 years along with four other cities in India. Lord Rama along with Lakshmana and Sita spent 14 years of his exile at Tapovan near Nashik. The city came under the rule of Mughal in 16th century and was renamed Gulshanabad. Then it comes under Peshwa of Maratha Empire in 1818. City is also noted for its participation in freedom struggle. Freedom fighters like Veer Savarkar and Anant Laxman Kanhere were born in Nashik.
For a long time, the name of the city has changed according to different rulers. Some believe the name "Nashik" was derived after the incident in Ramayana when Lakshman (Sri Ram's brother) chopped off the nose of Surpanakha (Ravan's sister). Another school of thought states that Nashik is a combination of nava shikha - nine summits. It was also named as Gulshnabad by Muslim rulers which was immediately disputed by the residents. It was spelled incorrectly by the British administration, as Nasik but eventually changed to the current Nashik.
