Aberfeldy (Gaelic: Obar Pheallaidh) is a small town in Perth and Kinross in North East Scotland, with a population of 1940 in 2021. That county straddles the Highland / Lowland divide, and Aberfeldy is scenically very much in the central Highlands. Set on the banks of the River Tay, it grew up as a resort town in the 19th century. Since the 20th century the area has been mined for baryte, an ingredient of drill fluid in the oil industry, but it's small scale and hasn't marred the scenery.
Near Aberfeldy you can also visit the village of Dull. Because someone has to.

Had you seen these roads before they were made, you would lift up your hands and bless General Wade!
You can walk to the Castle and up the Birks. Dull is three miles away and you need a car to reach the path for Schiehallion ten miles away.
Sweeney's Bus 91 plies between Aberfeldy and Kenmore twice M-F around 9AM and 4PM. It usually runs along the main road and takes 15 min, but some days makes a loop through Weem, Dull, Coshieville, Fortingall and Fearnan to Kenmore. Stagecoach Bus 892 similarly makes an occasional school run up the B-road from Aberfeldy to Coshieville then returns the same way.

See[edit]
56.6213-3.87311 Wade's Bridge spans the Tay. Highland roads at the start of the 18th century were often little better than cattle tracks, struggling through fords and bogs. In 1715 the Jacobite rebellion rocked the government; it was quashed, but showed the need to be able to move troops swiftly into troublesome districts. General George Wade (1673-1748), as Scotland's military commander, set about building better roads and bridges. The Crieff to Dalnarcardoch road, built in 1730, crossed the Tay at Aberfeldy by this impressive bridge. Designed by William Adam, it was the most expensive structure in the whole network, and was only completed in 1734. When Wade retired, his assistant Major William Caulfeild took over, building many roads later credited to Wade, and coining the lines quoted above. Meanwhile the Jacobites rebelled again, and this time got as far south as Derby: bless these new roads!
56.6252-3.87042 Plastic Footbridge over the River Tay links two sections of the golf course. The name is an ironic nod to the great William McGonagall, who wrote numerous doggerel odes about the Tay and much else, but his poem about Aberfeldy is sublimely awful even by his exacting standards.
56.6239-3.89693 Castle Menzies, Weem PH15 2JD (B846 1.5 miles west of Aberfeldy), ☏ +44 1887 820982. Apr-Oct M-Sa 10:30AM-4:30PM, Su 2-4:30PM. Fine 16th-century castle, restored in the 20th century (this work continues), transitional in style between a defensive fortress and a decorative chateau. "The man who would be king": Bonnie Prince Charlie stayed here in 1746, and the deposed Maharajah of the Sikh Empire was in residence 1855-58. Adult £11, conc £10, child £5.   (updated Mar 2024)

The League of Extraordinary Communities: well one of them, not to overdo the excitement. Dull is a tiny farming community straggling along the B846 three miles west of Aberfeldy. There was a monastery in the 7th century; various associated carvings and grave slabs are now in the NMS in Edinburgh. There's nothing here nowadays. But in 2012 Dull began trading on its name, linking up with the town of Boring near Portland Oregon. You can image the T-shirts, the photo-ops, the mugs. In 2013 the town of Bland, New South Wales got in on the act, so these three market themselves as the "League of Extraordinary Communities" of Dull, Boring and Bland. Take a photo of the village sign, press "share", your work here is done.
56.6-4.254 Glen Lyon is a scenic but little-visited glen 8 miles west of Aberfeldy. Follow B846 beyond Dull, passing Comrie Castle (the masonry stump of a 16th century tower house) to Coshieville. Here the B-road climbs north out of the valley towards Schiehallion, Loch Tummel and Loch Rannoch, while a narrow lane stays along the River Lyon. It winds through Fortingall, where the yew tree in the graveyard is believed to be well over 2000 years old, but there is no sense to be made of the hoaky legend that Pontius Pilate was born here. The lane continues upstream for many a lonely mile behind Ben Lawers, before eventually looping south over the hills to rejoin the main road at Killin at the head of Loch Tay.
56.6018-3.96025 Croft Moraig Stone Circle is by the A827. It seems to have been rebuilt in several phases; some pottery found here was from 2000 BC.
56.585-3.9996 Kenmore is reached by A827 west of Aberfeldy along the riverside to Loch Tay. April-Oct there are boat trips by Loch Tay Safaris. A827 continues west along the sunlit north bank of the loch, with access to Ben Lawers. A narrow, gloomy, tree-dripping lane follows the south bank.
56.5818-4.01967 Scottish Crannog Centre, Kenmore PH15 2NX, ☏ +44 1887 830583. Apr-Oct daily 10AM-4:30PM. Iron Age dwellers in Scotland and across Europe often dwelt in stilt-houses in lakes, and this is a reconstruction of one such crannog. Visit by guided tour every 30 min. Adult £15, conc £12.50, child £10. (updated Mar 2024)
Do[edit]
Welcome to Dull, linked with Boring and Bland
Birks Cinema in town centre is a restored Art Deco building with films and other entertainment. The cafe is open daily.
Walk the 56.616-3.8671 Birks o'Aberfeldy, the birch-filled glen south of the village that inspired the poem by Robert Burns. The path leads up to the Falls of Moness.
Find 56.628-3.8852 St David's Well if you can, hidden in the woods above Weem off B846. The nearby rocks have cup-and-ring carvings: some may be prehistoric, but probably most are modern replicas.
Climb Schiehallion, sometimes called "The Mount Fuji of Scotland" for its near-perfect cone and isolation from other peaks. It's a Munro of 1083 m (3553 ft) which looks volcanic but is quartzite polished by glaciation. Its shape made its volume easy to calculate, so in 1774 it was used to estimate the earth's mass and gravity by the deflection of a nearby pendulum. It's a popular ascent, usually from the car park at Brae of Foss, a 3-mile trail.
Climb Ben Lawers, a Munro of 1214 m (3983 ft) brooding over Loch Tay, with alpine / arctic habitat on its upper slopes. Early geologists supposed that after a first volcanic phase of the earth's formation, later rocks were laid down by sedimentation. But they found more and more awkward anomalies, and at Ben Lawers they discovered that the entire sequence of strata was inverted - which turned conventional wisdom on its head. The path up the mountain is straightforward, from the NTS car park you ascend via the lesser peak of Beinn Ghlas.
White-water rafting along the Tay and Tummel, both equally cold if you get soaked. The Rafting Company (+44 1887 829292) are in town centre; Splash (+44 1887 829706) are along Dunkeld Rd, with another base in Glasgow.
