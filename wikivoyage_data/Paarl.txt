By car[edit]
The easiest way to get there from Cape Town is by car is to follow the N1 North. Travel time is from 45 minutes up to an hour depending on traffic.

By train[edit]
Metrorail[dead link] runs trains from Cape Town, including the high-end Boland Business Express. Services are aimed mainly at commuters, with more trains in the morning and afternoon. Long distance Shosholoza Meyl[dead link] trains between Cape Town and Johannesburg also calls here.
There are several railway stations in Paarl, but the main ones for tourists are:

-33.7318.9766671 Huguenot railway station, Distillery St. Main station in Paarl, where all express and intercity trains calls.   (updated Aug 2019)
-33.76471218.9644732 Paarl railway station. Confusingly, this is a much smaller station in the southern suburbs. It's near the Paarl monument but not much else. Not all trains calls here. (updated Aug 2019)
By bus[edit]
Long distance coach operator Intercape has connections to Paarl from several major cities in South Africa as well as one international service from Harare, in Zimbabwe. While intercity buses are relatively cheap, journey times can be grueling.

Get around[edit]
As with most of South Africa, it is best to use a rented car.
