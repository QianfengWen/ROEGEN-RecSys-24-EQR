Easton is one of three cities, along with Allentown and Bethlehem, that are the urban population centers of the Lehigh Valley in eastern Pennsylvania. In the Lehigh Valley, Easton borders the Delaware River and Phillipsburg, New Jersey to its east and Bethlehem to its southwest. The city lies in the center of the highly populated Northeast megalopolis region of the U.S., 2 miles (3.2 km) west of the Skylands and New Jersey state line, 72 miles (116 km) west of New York City and 77 miles (124 km) north of Philadelphia.


Understand[edit]
The 106-foot (32 m) high Easton Peace Candle on Centre Square at night, December 2009
In 1736, Thomas Penn (William Penn's son) surveyed the area and Easton was founded in 1752.  Prior to that, Easton had been known as "Lechawitauk", meaning "The Place at the Forks." On July 8, 1776 the Declaration of Independence was read in Easton's Centre Square, one of three public readings of the document. Every year, Easton celebrates this historic event with its Heritage Day celebration, held in July.
Easton became a primary commercial location during the canals and railroads era of the 1800s. The Delaware, Morris and Lehigh Canals were vital for transportation of goods. The railroads replaced the canals for transportation and five railroads served Easton. The city had a strong German heritage. During Prohibition, it was known for nightlife and had plenty of liquor and a large number of brothels.
The population in Easton continues to diversify. Between the 1990 and 2000 censuses, the Hispanic and Black populations increased significantly. However, the primary ethnicity in the city remains White/non-Hispanic.

Geography[edit]
Easton sits at the confluence of the Delaware and Lehigh Rivers. Native Americans called Easton Lechawitau, "the place at the Forks".

Climate[edit]
Easton has a highly variable four-season temperate climate.
Summertime highs average in the low 80s F, but with occasional short heat waves with temps over 95 °F (35 °C), with considerable humidity and occasionally intense thunderstorms.
Winters are somewhat cold with average highs in the mid to upper 30s F (around 1-3 °C), but with occasional short thaws when temperatures can suddenly rise over 65 F for a few days. Severe cold snaps are common, with highs dropping into the twenties. Heavy snowfalls rarely occur more than once or twice each winter, but a wintry mix of ice, sleet, and light snow is possible from mid-November through early April. The combination of above freezing daytime temps and below freezing nights makes black ice a constant wintertime driving hazard even when there has not been precipitation recently.
Late spring and early summer (from mid-April to late June), and autumn are the most pleasant times of the year, with very mild temperatures and generally low humidity. Autumn leaf season usually arrives in the last two weeks of October.

Larry Holmes Drive, an Easton street named in honor of former heavyweight boxing champion Larry Holmes, who was from Easton and was the only boxer (in 1980) to have beaten Muhammad Ali so bad that Ali's corner had to intervene to stop the fight. Holmes' boxing nickname was "The Easton Assassin".
U.S. Route 22 is a main thoroughfare, being a 4-lane limited-access highway with a speed limit of 55 miles per hour through all of Lehigh Valley except in Easton.
Drivers coming from points east will want to note that all of the major bridges across the Delaware River (from New Jersey) are free eastbound, but require tolls westbound. Locating the free bridge in Phillipsburg is possible but not recommended to those unfamiliar with the area. It is called Northampton Street for the adventurous and adds only about half a mile to the trip (unless yu easily get lost).
From the southeast and northwest, PA Route 309 provides fairly quick access and is a good road to travel.
Interstate 78 and Interstate 476 (PA Turnpike; tolled) intersect very close to the city of Easton, going in all directions north, south, east, and west.
PA Route 33 is the best approach for travelers from I-80 in the Poconos and points east.
