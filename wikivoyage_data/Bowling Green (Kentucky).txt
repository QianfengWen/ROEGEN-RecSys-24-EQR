By car[edit]
Bowling Green is accessible by car, primarily from I-65, which connects it with Nashville to the south and Louisville to the north.
Two roads in the state's parkway system of former toll roads serve the Bowling Green area. Interstate 165 (formerly the William H. Natcher Parkway, and still earlier the Green River Parkway) connects I-65 in Bowling Green with Owensboro, 70 miles to the northwest. I-165 intersects with the Western Kentucky Parkway near Beaver Dam, giving Bowling Green easy access to Paducah and the Land Between the Lakes. The Cumberland Parkway connects I-65 northeast of Bowling Green to Somerset, 80 miles to the east. From there KY 80 provides access to I-75 at London.
Another major road in the area is U.S. 68. To the east of the city, it is a two-lane road that largely parallels I-65 and the Cumberland Parkway before taking a sharp turn toward central Kentucky. However, to the west, it is a four-lane divided highway (though with at-grade intersections) until the town of Cadiz, near Land Between the Lakes.

A local or in-state telephone call now requires all 10 digits of the local number be dialed (omitting just the leading +1 from a local landline call).
Signage on many established businesses may still display the original seven-digit numbers; dial 270 before these if no area code is indicated.
