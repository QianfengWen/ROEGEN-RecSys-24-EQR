Hebron (Arabic: الخليل al-Ḫalīl; Hebrew: חֶבְרוֹן Ḥevron, Ḥeḇrôn, or Ḥebron) is an ancient city in the southern West Bank. It is the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives. This makes it a significant religious site for the Abrahamic religions. In 2017, the old town was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.


Understand[edit]
Hebron is mentioned in the Bible as the home of Abraham, and the burial place of him and several generations of his family. In King David's time, Hebron was briefly the capital of the Israelite state, before the capital moved to Jerusalem. Today, Hebron is holy to both Muslims and Jews due to its association with Abraham. (Christianity is also an Abrahamic religion, but Christians haven't paid as much attention to Hebron.)
The Jewish population of Hebron was evacuated after Arabs killed nearly 70 of them in 1929. After the 1967 war, a few Jews resettled the Jewish quarter. Today, about 500 Jews live in part of the old city of Hebron under continual Israel Defense Force protection, and with a ratio of four Israeli soldiers for each Israeli settler.

Political map of Hebron
Today, the city of Hebron is home to about 500 Jews and 200,000 Palestinians. The Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba (population 8,000) is a separate city immediately adjacent to Hebron. Hebron is divided into two sectors: H1 is entirely Palestinian and includes about 80% of the city's residents, while H2 contains all the Jews and the remainder of the Arabs. H1 is under full Palestinian control (i.e. Area A), while H2 is under full Israel control. The Cave of the Patriarchs, the main holy site in the city, is on the border between H1 and H2.
This has been one of the tensest places between Jews and Palestinians, as in Hebron both sides here tend to be more extreme and violent than the average for their ethnic groups. Jews here have the 1929 massacre on their minds, while Palestinians have Baruch Goldstein's 1994 massacre of praying Muslims on theirs. This is not a good place to express your opinion on the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. Even Jewish residents here have an often-hostile relationship with the Israel army, because they see it as being too accommodating to Palestinians. Unfortunately, the 2017 declaration of the Old Town as a UNESCO world heritage site has done little to ease the tensions, as the Israeli government protested its classification as an "endangered" "Palestinian" site, despite its Jewish heritage.

Get in[edit]
If you are visibly Jewish, it is probably not safe to travel unaccompanied to the "other" side of Hebron. However, if you look and sound like an international tourist, you should be fine on both sides.

To the Jewish side[edit]
From Jerusalem – Take bus 381 or 383 from the CBS (₪8.10) to the Jewish side of Hebron. The third from the last stop (Me'arat Hamahpela) is in front of the Cave of the Patriarchs on the Jewish side. The final stop (Beit Romano) is a five minute walk from an H1/H2 checkpoint.
From Be'er Sheva – Take bus 254 (₪13.50), which terminates at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, from where you can take 381 or 383 over to the Jewish side of Hebron. This transfer might be free if you show them the bus 254 ticket.
To the Palestinian side[edit]
From Jerusalem – Take bus 21 from the Sultan Suleiman bus station just out and to the right from Damascus gate. Tell them Hebron or Al-Khalil (Arabic). They will take you to a mid way drop off point at the Bethlehem bus station. From there, go to the very bottom floor of the Bethlehem bus station where a servees (the Palestinian version of a sherut, called a serv-eese in Arabic) will deliver you to Hebron for less than ₪10.
Alternatively, take the bus to Abu Dis and tell the bus driver you are going to Khalil.
From Bethlehem – As mentioned before, from the very bottom floor of the Bethlehem bus station (at Manger Street) a servees will deliver you to Hebron for ₪9.
From Ramallah – Direct servees to Hebron depart from one of the many bus stations in Ramallah, just ask around. It might be faster to go to Bethlehem first, though.
From Be'er Sheva – Make your way to the last stop in front of the Church of the Patriarchs on the Jewish side, as explained before. From there just walk further passing by at least three Israeli checkpoints, with the 31.52653135.1022061 last checkpoint being a gate which "delivers" you to the Palestinian side. Alternatively, you can directly enter the Palestinian side via a 31.5245335.1099742 gate to the left of the Muslim entrance of the Church of the Patriarchs, after which however you will need to go through a lengthy and little depressing souq alley.
Also, arriving at 31.52955335.1182443 Kiryat Arba, you can walk directly into the Palestinian part of Hebron – consult Google Maps for the best way. However, taking the short ride with the Egged bus might be more convenient coming here the first time.
Get around[edit]

Crossing between the sides[edit]
There are at least two gates that allow pedestrian traffic between the Palestinian and Jewish sides. The most convenient gate for travelers is the Bab El-Zawiya crossing, a five minute walk from the Beit Romano bus stop on David Hamelech Street. Parking for Israeli registered vehicles is possible just before the crossing.
There is a myth that it is impossible to access the Jewish side of Hebron on foot coming from the highway/main road. However, this was likely only true in tense times, because there were no gates and metal detectors you could be checked with, although this has since changed. Generally, Palestinian taxi drivers are not allowed to drive to the Jewish side. In that case, you will need to go by taxi or bus from an Israeli town or a Jewish settlement (like Kiryat Arba). Either way, internationals can drive into the Jewish side, if your driver is not Palestinian.
It is now possible to make a long (25 min) walk from Kiryat Arba to the Cave of the Patriarchs directly via a stubby sidewalk. If that is not possible directly for some reason, walk via the Palestinian side and then through one of the gates coming from Be'er Sheva.

In general[edit]
The 31.52723935.098661 Hebron Bus Station for servees to and from the surrounding areas, and even Bethlehem and Ramallah is on the upper floors of the Jeel-Saed shopping centre along Adel Street.
On the Palestinian side of Hebron, taxi rides within the city shouldn't cost more than ₪10-15. For seeing sights out-of-town, it's best to take a servees taxi at the service-taxi/bus station or negotiate a fair price with a taxi driver. Make sure to agree on a price for a taxi before getting in.
On the Jewish side of Hebron, a 10-minute walk will take you from one end to the other.

See[edit]
Cave of the Patriarchs
31.5248735.110711 Cave of the Patriarchs (al Haram al Ibrahimi/Ibrahimi Mosque, Ma'arat HaMachpelah/Machpelah Cave). The main religious site in the city. The cave, where the Patriarchs and their wives are buried, is deep underground. Now, people pray in a building on top of the cave, built by King Herod about 2000 years ago. The building is divided into Muslim and Jewish sections. Visitors are welcome to visit both sides when they are not being used for scheduled prayer. The Muslim side provides cloaks for women to cover up when visiting. The Muslim side contains the only known entrance to the Cave below (it is locked by a marble door), as well as the tomb-markers of Isaac and Rebecca. The tomb-markers of Abraham and Sarah lie on the border of both the Muslim and Jewish sections, while the Jewish section contains the tomb-markers of Jacob and Leah. Most of the time, half of the building is used for Muslim and half for Jewish prayer. On a few predetermined days each year, each religion gets to use the entire building. For the Jews, in addition to the normal holidays, one of these days is "Shabbat Chayei Sarah" each fall, on which thousands of people from all of Israel visit Hebron to commemorate Abraham's purchase of the Cave from its previous Hittite owners. For the Muslims, it is on Fridays during Ramadan, and during the Eid al Fitr and Eid al Adha holiday, commemorating Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son. The Cave of the Patriarchs is a  UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the contested recognition of it led the US's and Israel's 2017 decision to leave the UNESCO on 31 Dec 2018.

In this building, also the Hebron Observatory can be found – just walk up the stairs inside of the building and hope the upper door is not locked.

Hebron is famous of its traditional dish called Al-Qidrah (Al-Khaliliyah). This meal contains mainly rice and meat (chicken or lamb).

Drink[edit]
As an overwhelmingly Muslim city with a more conservative culture than cities such as Bethlehem and Ramallah, alcoholic drinks are not available on the Palestinian side of Hebron.

Stay safe[edit]
Touts[edit]
It seems like there are many "guides" running around, trying to catch tourists on the basis of charity or political activism, showing you pictures of other westerners they have supposedly worked together with. They even suggest you're Jewish if you don't tell them your nationality, and might become pushy asking for money.
This tout-like behavior leaves some doubts whether they really stand for what they are claiming. If you just don't want to be bothered, tell them you have been here before and not interested this time. Be firm, you have nothing to fear from these guys. Hebron definitely is a very political place, but you should decide for yourself whether to take action.
In general, be wary of unofficial guides, which mostly will try to take you from one place to the other where you will likely buy something, so they can make their share from the shop owner. They will even ruthlessly tell you that something is closed or might take too long (like the Church of the Patriarchs), which is not true, just to make sure you spend more time potentially spending money. Better to use a regular guide with an agreed and claimable schedule.

Security[edit]
Many people are hesitant to come to Hebron, because they get told by hostel owners (e.g. in Bethlehem, for apparent reasons) that Hebron is unsafe. However, Hebron is not less safe than any other city in the West Bank during "peace times". Also, if you are non-Jewish you are not a threat or target, for that matter, to/for any Palestinian, and you are likely to be greeted with the characteristic "welcome!" in the city center. However, in some of the Palestinian suburbs around the Kiryat Arba settlement, tourists are not a regular occurrence and a small minority of locals may be less friendly, especially if they believe you to be associated with the settlement.
In addition, the special situation makes it a must if you want to understand more about the conflict.

Go next[edit]
Nearby popular sights in the West Bank, that allow for a day trip from Hebron, include Tor-Safa Cave, Taffuh Underground Church, Tomb of Prophet Lot and Birkat al-Karmil (Holy Pool).
Bethlehem – The biblical birthplace of Jesus and hometown of David.
Jerusalem – Besides the Dead Sea, a central focus for most people coming to Israel.
Jericho – One of the oldest settlements in the world and the Middle East.
Negev & Judaean – Deserts close to the Dead Sea, featuring amazing sites and desert landscapes, including the Ramon Crater and two other craters.
Hiking in the Judaean Desert – Go out to other nearby hiking trails; particularly the Mishmar and Ze'elim streams are very close by.
Dead Sea – One of the most famous things to see or do in Israel and Jordan.
For bus travel to destinations in Israel, Egged runs various routes from/via inside Kiryat Alba. You may have a hard time gaining admittance to the settlement, but you might still be able to catch the buses at the settlement's 31.5417535.1323334 entrance/exit gate near the highway. Failing that, it will probably be necessary to take a bus to Jerusalem to interchange for onward travel.
