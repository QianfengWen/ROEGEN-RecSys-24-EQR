It is popular for its mild climate, many sunny days and a great amount of snow through the winter. Visitors can buy or rent any necessary skiing and snowboarding equipment. 
Bowling alley
Movie theatre
The Central Park has a small amusement park with a slow-moving ferris wheel and other fast-moving rides.
In warmer weather, there are lots of amusements for small kids in the paved square opposite the new movie theater.
In freezing cold weather, the same paved square hosts an amazing ice-carved village, including a very long ice slide. Lots of fun, but bundle up because it gets c-c-c-cold.
