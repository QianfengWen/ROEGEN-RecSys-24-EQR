Lyttelton is the seaport satellite town of Christchurch in New Zealand, lying just over the Port Hills from Christchurch.


Understand[edit]
Lyttelton provides a safe, sheltered deepwater harbour, as it lies in the caldera of an extinct volcano. The town's steep streets are a novelty for many Christchurch drivers, who rarely encounter a hill (unless they deliberately drive to the hill suburbs on the edge of the city).
Lyttelton was established as a seaport in the late 1840s. The early settlers had to walk over the Bridle Path - so named because the path was so steep that horses had to be led by the bridle as they could not be ridden. In the early years, Lyttelton provided a trans-shipment point for cargo bound for Christchurch. Passengers and light cargo would travel over the Bridle Path on foot or horseback. Heavier cargo was shipped in shallow draught coastal vessels back around the coast, across the treacherous Sumner bar and into the estuary to Ferrymead or, later, Steam Wharf, just down the Heathcote River from where the Tunnel Road meets Ferry Road.
New Zealand's first public railway was built to link Christchurch and Lyttelton, opening from Christchurch to Ferrymead in 1863 and then to Lyttelton once the 2.6-km Lyttelton Rail Tunnel was completed in 1867. In 1964, the rail tunnel was supplemented by the 2.0-km Lyttelton Road Tunnel. Between 1895 and 1976, steam ferries operated an overnight service between Lyttelton and Wellington, linking New Zealand's two main islands.
Lyttelton was extensively damaged in the 2010 and 2011 Christchurch earthquakes. Several historic buildings were damaged beyond repair including the famous Timeball Station, which was rebuilt in 2018.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
There are three ways by car from Christchurch into Lyttelton:

Through SH 74/Tunnel Rd (sometimes called Tunnel Rd Mwy). The tunnel is probably the best bet if you're unfamiliar with driving on the left and squeamish about steep twisty turns on hills. Although New Zealand roads are pretty good and you do get a great view going over the hills.
Over the Port Hills along Dyers Pass Road (past the Sign of the Takahe)
Via Gebbies Pass, though this is a rather indirect route and is probably only a practical alternative if southwest of Christchurch.
Over the Port Hills along Evans Pass Road and down the newly reopened Sumner Road.
By bus[edit]
Take the number 28 bus from the Bus Exchange to Rapaki/Lyttelton.

By foot[edit]
Walk the Bridal Path from Heathcote.

By boat[edit]

Get around[edit]
43°36′12″S 172°43′17″EMap of Lyttelton
The town of Lyttelton is very small but very hilly. The streets usually have a nice European charm to it, but it also means that driving will be unpleasant (as it was intended). The best way to get around the town is entirely on foot, even if you have a car, unless you are leaving the town proper.
There are buses that run within the town, but the distances are too short to justify realistically waiting.
