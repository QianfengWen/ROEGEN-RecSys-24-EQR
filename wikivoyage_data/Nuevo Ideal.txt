Nuevo Ideal is one of the larger towns in a long, dry valley. There are several other towns in this valley, at the southern end of which is the city of Durango. The city sits at an elevation around 2,000 m (6,600 ft).

Climate[edit]
Like many towns in the region, Nuevo Ideal could be hotter, but its high elevation prevents that.

Talk[edit]
The area is Spanish-speaking, and, unlike places closer to the border and tourist attractions, has almost no American influence, so do not expect anyone to speak English.
