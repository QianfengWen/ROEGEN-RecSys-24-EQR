Brantford is a former industrial city of 105,000 people (2021) on the Grand River in Southwestern Ontario. "The Telephone City", it is where Alexander Graham Bell said he invented his telephone, and from where he placed the first long-distance call to nearby Paris (Ontario). His Tutela Heights home, south of the city, is an international tourist attraction. For ice hockey fans, it's also famous as the hometown of the legendary Wayne Gretzky.
Brant County surrounds the City of Brantford. It had a population  of 37,000 in 2016. It includes the pretty riverside community of Paris. The Brant census division includes the Six Nations Reserve, which has about 13,000 residents, but is not part of the county.


Understand[edit]
Brantford is named after Joseph Brant, an important Mohawk First Nations (Aboriginal) chief during the American Revolutionary War and later, who led his people in their first decades in Upper Canada. Many of his descendants, and other First Nations citizens, live on the nearby Reserve of Six Nations of the Grand River, 20 km from Brantford; it is the most populous reserve in Canada.

History[edit]
The Iroquoian-speaking Attawandaron, known in English as the Neutral Nation, lived in the Grand River valley area before the 17th century; their main village and seat of the chief, Kandoucho, was identified by 19th-century historians as having been located on the Grand River where present-day Brantford developed. This community, like the rest of their settlements, was destroyed when the Iroquois declared war in 1650 over the fur trade and exterminated the Neutral nation.
In 1784, Captain Joseph Brant and the Mohawk people of the Iroquois Confederacy left New York State for Canada. As a reward for their loyalty to the British Crown, they were given a large land grant, referred to as the Haldimand Tract, on the Grand River. The original Mohawk settlement was on the south edge of the present-day city at a location favourable for landing canoes. Brant's crossing (or fording) of the river gave the original name to the area: Brant's ford.
The area began to grow from a small settlement in the 1820s as the Hamilton and London Road was improved. By the 1830s, Brantford became a stop on the Underground Railroad. From the 1830s to the 1860s, several hundred people of African descent settled in the area around Murray Street, and in Cainsville. In Brantford, they established their own school and church, now known as the S.R. Drake Memorial Church. In 1846, it is estimated 2000 residents lived in the city's core while 5199 lived in the outlying rural areas.
By 1847, Europeans began to settle further up the river at a ford in the Grand River and named their village Brantford. The population increased after 1848 when river navigation to Brantford was opened and again in 1854 with the arrival of the railway to Brantford.
Because of the ease of navigation from new roads and the Grand River, several manufacturing companies could be found in the town by 1869.

Stay safe[edit]
Brantford is a dangerous city during the night hours. From the Lorne Bridge down to Stanley Street is where most of the crime takes place. Assaults and robberies are common in these areas, as in Eagle Place which is located east of the downtown core. Police presence is most frequented in these areas; drunken bar fights are an every night thing in Brantford on the weekends, and sometimes week nights. The Brantford downtown has come a long way since the year 2000; the city has put money into the downtown core, and continues to build new buildings and more local friendly attractions. Wilfrid Laurier University is across from the Eaton Square, which is in the downtown core. Police have stepped up and cut down crime since Maclean's magazine ranked Brantford 11th worst city in Canada for its crime rate. If you take the necessary precautions and walk with groups you will unlikely encounter any problems, but if you are alone you may be target for criminals or drug addicts looking for their next fix.
