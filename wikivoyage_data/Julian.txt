Julian is a town in San Diego County, about one hour inland from San Diego.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Julian was founded by Confederate veterans after the Civil War, and enjoyed a boom when gold was discovered in the area a few years later.

Climate[edit]
A mountain town situated among Cleveland National Forest, Cuyamaca Rancho State Park and Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, Julian gets the kind of seasonal weather that is rare in Southern California.  Leaves change color in fall, snow falls in winter, flowers bloom in spring and the summer months are hot.
