Understand[edit]
MelbourneWhile most of Melbourne is on the mainland, a small portion is located on a barrier island. The Indian River Lagoon separates the mainland from the island. The island is a narrow strip of land that separates the Lagoon from the Atlantic Ocean.
Spanning the Indian River Lagoon to connect the mainland to the barrier island are a pair of four-lane, high-rise bridges: the Melbourne Causeway and the Eau Gallie Causeway.
