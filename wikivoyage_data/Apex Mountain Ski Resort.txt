Apex Mountain Alpine Resort is a ski village in the Okanagan region of British Columbia. The closest city is Penticton. Apex is distinguished by its big-mountain terrain with a small-mountain village and vibe. The locals are fervent in their advocacy of the mountain. The lift lines are generally nonexistent but for weekends when the 'city people' come up and take over the slopes, village and parking lot. Unless it is an epic powder day the locals will stay at home on the weekends. Characterized by the 'Cheers' effect (i.e.: everybody knows your name) Apex is without doubt one of the friendliest hills in British Columbia. No one cares about sporting the latest styles in winterwear, rather they care about what's really important: the snow, and getting the most out of their beloved hill.


Get in[edit]
The only method into the village is by road. It is about a 35-45 minute drive from Penticton. Follow Green Mountain Road 20 km from town and turn right at the Apex Guest Ranch. If travelling from Keremeos then turn left at the ranch. You can also take your chances on the Hedley Corkscrew Road which winds down the mountain to Hedley via a system of tight switchbacks perched on steep cliffs. This is not recommended in the winter without a very good 4x4 vehicle (e.g. a Hummer).

Get around[edit]

Well, you will want to ski of course! You can ski from the upper village to the main part, where the hotels and restaurants are located. Otherwise, you will have to drive or snowmobile.

Go Tubing, in the lift accessed tube park. Inquire locally for times.
Summer[edit]
Mountain biking
Apex has a brief summer season. Most on-hill facilities are shutdown during the summer, so you may have to make it a day trip from Penticton unless you know someone. Although there are some year-round residents at Apex, in the summer it generally resembles a ghost town.
Fishing
You can also go fishing at nearby 49.3982-119.95643 Nickel Plate Lake. If you plan to fish make absolute sure you have a valid fishing license, as conservation officials are able to confiscate all your gear including boats or vehicles and hit you with a stiff fine.
Buy[edit]
There is not much to buy up at Apex other than food and your lift ticket.

49.39042-119.90411 Trading Post, Strayhorse Rd (located in the bottom floor of the Gunbarrel Saloon), ☏ +1 250-328-3062. Small bakery/convenience store that stocks food/drink, serves coffee, essential toiletries, and a modest selection of Apex souvenirs. This is the only place to buy cold beer, wine, and spirits other than at the Gunbarrel Saloon. Selection is limited, so if you are a discriminating drinker you will want to bring your own booze from town. (updated May 2023)
49.39017-119.9032 The Mountain Shop. Sells ski and snowboard equipment and clothing. Also handles repairs and service to equipment. Be warned that the location on the hill warrants a 15-20% markup over prices you would pay in town. It is recommended to get the gear you need in town unless absolutely necessary, or you have money to burn. Located above the rental shop. (updated May 2023)
