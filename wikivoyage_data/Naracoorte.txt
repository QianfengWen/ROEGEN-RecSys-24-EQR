Naracoorte Caves
-37.035658140.7965691 Naracoorte Caves National Park. UNESCO World Heritage listed site of mammalian fossils. The caves contains the fossils of enormous extinct Australian megafauna such as the marsupial lion, giant kangaroo as well as five-metre long snakes. Over the last two to three million years, geological processes brought sand and soil into the caves. This created thick sedimentary deposits which preserved the remains of the animal living in and around the caves at the time. Up to 20 species of megafauna are preserved at a remarkable level across multiple caves. The site is one of the jewels in Australian paleontology.
