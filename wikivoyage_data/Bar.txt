Understand[edit]
The Old Town of Bar, 4 km far from the coast, is the most significant among the numerous cultural-historical monuments of this town, a witness to its turbulent history. These old bricks are deaf witnesses of numerous conquerors and different cultures.
Bar is the main port city of Montenegro. Unlike other cities along the coastline, Bar is not only tourist-focused, and the most majority of restaurants, bars and shops are open year-around for the local population. The tourist centres and tour companies usually only operate during the May - September summer season.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
For the airports in Podgorica or Tivat take a bus or a Taxi, from Podgorica you can also take the train, and then continue a local taxi to the airport.
Alternatively, take an one-hour drive by a car. It is possible to reach Podgorica airport through a taxi service. A transfer should cost €30 for a vehicle up to four passengers, and €60 for a minivan up to eight passengers.

By train[edit]
One day train ("Tara") and one night train ("Lovcen") take eleven hours from Belgrade via Rakovica (for Belgrade suburban lines), Bijelo Poljea, Prijepolje, Podgorica and a dozen other stops; they're chronically an hour late. Scheduled arrival is 7:23 AM. For 2024 the day service runs only between mid-June and mid-September and requires a simple change between Serbian and Montenegrin local trains at the border station of Bijelo Polje. In Belgrade for some years these trains departed from Topcider, the dreary motorail terminal in the southern burbs, but they now run from Centar station.
