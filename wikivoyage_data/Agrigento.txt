Agrigento (Sicilian: Girgenti or Giurgenti) is the capital of the eponymous province on the Italian island of Sicily.


Understand[edit]
Agrigento is primarily famous for the Valley of Temples, impressive remains of Greek Doric temples. Since 1997 the Valley of Temples and the other ancient sites in the area have been included in the UNESCO's World Heritage List.
During the golden age of Ancient Greece, it was known as Akragas (Ἀκράγας). One of the leading cities of Magna Graecia, it was the hometown of philosopher Empedocles. Later on, it became Agrigentum in Latin, and Kirkent or Jirjent in Arabic.
Agrigento is the birthplace of the novelist, poet and playwright Luigi Pirandello who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1934.

Similarly to nearby Gela, Agrigento has a semi-arid climate, with just enough precipitation to avoid being classified as a desert climate. It features hot summers and mild winters. The winter months usually present mild to warm daytime temperatures and the weather is mostly sunny. Summer presents a pronounced aridity in which sunny conditions are virtually assured every day.

By train[edit]
Frequent trains run from the station near the centre of town to Palermo and Caltanissetta, less frequently to Enna (but not that useful - the station in Enna is about 5 km below the town). The journey to/from Palermo takes 2 hours and costs €10.90 (as of March 2023). Connecting with the east of Sicily by train is not easy, and takes a long time.
The train station is at Piazza Marconi, on the southeast corner of the old town.

The Valley of Temples is a string of five Greek temples stretching along a ridge to the south of the city. It is a sight worthy of comparison to the Acropolis in Athens. The temples are usually divided into two zones: the Eastern Zone and Western Zone each side of the main entrance and the road from the city centre.
It can get punishingly hot in summer and there is little shade other than some olive trees along the ridge. There is a shuttle bus that runs through the site (€3 for one stop, Nov 2019). Parking costs €1 for 30 min to a maximum of €5 (Nov 2019).

37.290313.58642 Tempio di Ercole (Temple of Hercules). The first temple east of the entrance is long, thin and about 1/3 standing. It is the oldest of the temples, built towards the end of the 6th century BC. Next to it are some interesting deep ruts formed by ancient carriages.   (updated Feb 2017)

37.290813.58446 Tempio di Giove (Temple of Jupiter). To the west of the main entrance is the massive temple which was never completed and is now in ruins with little structure visible. Most notable is one of the huge stone statues now lying on the ground.   (updated Feb 2017)

An audio tour is available at the entrance to the temples. (Some ID is required as security for these, which means walking back the entire length of the site just to give the guide back).
To put all these sights in context, it is well worth visiting the Archeological Museum (half way back into the city centre) and the adjacent Roman Quarter (with a few nice mosaics).
