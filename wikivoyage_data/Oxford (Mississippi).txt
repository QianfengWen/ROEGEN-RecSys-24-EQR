Oxford  is a historic, picturesque town in North Central Mississippi.  With its scenic town square, acclaimed restaurants, unique boutiques, oak-shaded neighborhoods, and friendly people, Oxford is the model Southern town.  Named after Oxford, England, in hopes of attracting a university, the town was selected as the home of the University of Mississippi in 1848, which dominates life here today.

Understand[edit]
Oxford is the home of the University of Mississippi, affectionately known as Ole Miss, and is in Lafayette County, outside the Oxford city limits.  It also served as the inspiration for Nobel Prize winner William Faulkner's fictional Jefferson (Lafayette County being Yoknapatawpha), the locale of many of his novels.  Oxonians and University members like to describe the town with the motto "We may not win every game, but we never lose a party."  Locals, partially jokingly, refer to the Square as the "Center of the Universe."  Many residents see Oxford as a small town New Orleans, calling it the Little Easy.  It is widely known throughout the South for its Southern charm, Old South feel, party atmosphere, and its beautiful women, whom even Hugh Hefner called the finest in the world.  Oxford is also considered a literary center with many writers calling it home.  Also being home to the Ole Miss School of Law and a federal courthouse, it is often said that everyone in Oxford is a "lawyer, writer, or both."  As if to prove this point, famous author John Grisham, an Ole Miss Law alum, still owns a house in Oxford and visits frequently.
The Square is the center of downtown and is the main location for the town's best restaurants, shops, bars, and scenery (of the Old South architecture and gorgeous Southern belles).  Chain restaurants, a Walmart Supercenter, and other national retailers are located on the fringes of town.  However, most locals are staunchly anti-chain.  They actively protested the arrival of Applebee's and the Walmart Supercenter, even voting out the old mayor because she did not do more to stop it.  Therefore, to truly enjoy Oxford, you must visit the Square and eat and shop at locally-owned establishments.  Otherwise, you are wasting your time visiting and are missing out if you only come for a football game.  Immerse yourself in the town to see why Reader's Digest proclaimed, "If Oxford didn't exist, it would have to be invented."
As National Geographic Traveler magazine wrote, "Sophisticated little Oxford is waiting for you."

By plane[edit]
The closest airports with airline service are in Memphis, 70 miles to the north, and Tupelo, 45 miles to the east. Memphis is a major hub for Delta Air Lines and is thus the preferred airport. Tupelo has daily flights to Memphis and Atlanta.
University-Oxford Airport, also known as Clegg Field, offers service to private planes, including jets.  The airport has a 5,600-foot runway with a terminal and aviation full-services.

By train[edit]
For passenger service, the nearest Amtrak stops are on the City of New Orleans line in Memphis and Greenwood, Mississippi.  The train will take you to Chicago or New Orleans.

By car[edit]
Major highways in the area are as follows:

North-south - State Highways 7, 9, 315 and 331
East-west - State Highways 6,30,314,328 and 334
Highway 6 - Connects with Interstate 55
From Memphis or Jackson (Miss.) take I-55 to Batesville and exit MS Hwy 6 East.  Take the Old Taylor Rd. or Coliseum Dr. exits to access the University.  Exit at South Lamar Blvd. to get to the Square and downtown.  Oxford is approximately 25 miles from Batesville.  It takes about an hour and 15 minutes to travel to Oxford from Memphis, about 2½ hours from Jackson, and about 45 minutes from Tupelo.  A shorter route from Memphis and Jackson is Hwy 7, but this road is two-lane.  However, from the eastern suburbs of Memphis, it is faster to take Hwy 78 to Hwy 7.  From downtown, the airport, and Southaven, I-55 to Hwy 6 is faster.

By bus[edit]
Greyhound bus service to Oxford was suspended. The closest Greyhound bus stop is in Tupelo.
Get around[edit]
The public transportation is called the O-U-T. It has several lines that run through all of the major points around town.  The best way to get around is by foot, as Oxford is a beautiful town to walk and parking is scarce downtown and on campus.  The second best way is by car.  Once you find a place to park on campus, stay there and walk everywhere you want to go.  The same applies to downtown.  Once you figure out how to navigate the square (it will take awhile) and the surrounding one-way streets, you can find a place to park by cruising the back alleys.  If you park illegally, you will get an expensive ticket.
Do not drink and drive as the cops keep a watchful eye on the byways, not to mention you are risking your life and the lives of others.  You can avoid this by walking home, hitching a ride (it's easy to find a ride from a friendly stranger on the Square), or calling a cab.

—William Faulkner, Requiem for a Nun

Oxford is an historic town best seen by foot. Begin with the antebellum buildings on campus, the Courthouse Square, and Rowan Oak. Soak up the town and meet some of the locals while you are at it!

The Historic Oxford Courthouse: Located in the heart of the city, the Square. Burned by federal troops in 1864, it was rebuilt after the war and is scheduled to undergo an extensive restoration. Visitors are allowed to browse the building on their own. The courtroom upstairs is a step back in time.
Lafayette Courthouse during Double Decker Festival
34.3598-89.52471 Rowan Oak, ☏ +1 662 234-3284. Old Taylor Road. The home of Nobel Prize-winning author William Faulkner. This historic home and grounds located just blocks from the Square. Faulkner even wrote part of a novel on the wall of his bedroom, later uncovered during a renovation. Walking tours available. Free admission on Wednesdays, $5 on other weekdays (donations always accepted). Entrance to the grounds is free, open until sunset.   
Rowan Oak, Home of William Faulkner
Oxford Cemetery, Here are buried such notables as William Faulkner and LQC Lamar, Confederate Ambassador to Russia, and Mississippi's only US Supreme Court Justice. Tradition calls for visitors of Faulkner's grave to leave a pint of whiskey, though scotch is what he would prefer.
The Grove, on the campus of the University of Mississippi. During the early Spring it has the appearance of a nicely manicured park, but during football season it turns into the most revered tailgating locale in all of college football. Sports Illustrated rates tailgating in the Grove, a multi-acre green space in the heart of the Ole Miss campus, as one of America's premier college events, placing it No. 3 on a list of 100 things to do before graduating. Bring your "refreshments" and your Sunday best. See the "Cope" section below for an important rule while tailgating.
 Southside Gallery, 150 Courthouse Square (on the square), ☏ +1 662 234-9090. An intimate collection of changing art pieces located in the heart of Oxford, The Square. Free admission. This is a nice stop if you are browsing the Square during the day or if you are waiting on a table at night. 
34.3643-89.52532 University Museum, 5th & University Avenue, ☏ +1 662 915-7073. Tu-Sa 9:30AM-4:30PM, Su 1-4PM, closed most University holidays. Features Greek and Roman antiques, 19th-century scientific instruments, the Theora Hamblett collection, a growing Southern folk art collection, and other temporary exhibits. There is an unpaved natural trail that leads from the museum parking lot to Rowan Oak (Faulkner's home). It is an easy walk that will give you a glimpse of an old-growth Mississippi forest, and it will also give you an idea of the jungle that the first settlers here had to clear in order to build their plantations.   
Ole Miss Blues Archives, University of Mississippi Campus, +1 662 915-7753. The world's most extensive collection of blues recordings and related material. If you are a blues enthusiast, this is a must-see. B.B. King recorded a live album (Live at Ole Miss) in the Grove.
The Lyceum, The first building on the Ole Miss campus. Seen as a symbol of the University. Used as a Confederate hospital during the Civil War. The front columns contain bullet holes from the integration of James Meredith. Stop by the Chancellor's office located on the first floor, and someone will be glad to give you a tour of the beautiful building. Even the friendly Chancellor loves to meet visitors.
The Lyceum
Ventress Hall, a 19th-century Victorian building on the edge of The Grove. Originally used as a library, now the home of the College of Liberal Arts. Inside is a huge stained glass window depicting a battle scene from The War(unless otherwise specified, "the war" in the deep South means the one taking place between 1861 and 1865). The window was commissioned by the Delta Gamma Sorority from the Tiffany Glass Company to honor the University Greys, a company comprised completely of Ole Miss students that suffered 100 percent casualties at the battle of Gettysburg. The turret contains a winding staircase filled with graffiti over 100 years old. Legend has it that William Faulkner got intoxicated, climbed to the top of the turret, and began shouting "Hotty Toddy" — the school's unofficial cheer. However, this is likely merely a legend, but a darn good one. A member of the staff inside would be happy to give you a brief tour.
34.366111-89.5344443 Center for the Study of Southern Culture (Barnard Observatory). Another antebellum building on campus that was built to house the world's largest telescope. It is widely believed among locals that the telescope was being shipped during the war when it was captured by Yankee troops and sent to Northwestern University. However, it is more likely that the University could no longer afford to pay for the telescope after the war began, and Northwestern bought it instead. The building was never used as an observatory and is now home to the Center for the Study of Southern Culture and hosts small exhibits.   (updated Oct 2020)
 Confederate Cemetery. behind Tad Smith Coliseum on the Ole Miss campus. It is the resting place of more than 700 Confederate dead, mostly from the Battle of Shiloh. University buildings were used as hospitals and headquarters of both Union and Confederate forces between 1862 and 1865. All those buried here perished on the grounds of the University. While many names are known (they are etched on a monument in the center of the cemetery) most buried here are unknown soldiers. Union dead were once buried here as well, but long ago moved to a national cemetery. One of Oxford and Ole Miss' lesser known sites, it is a must-see for Civil War Buffs. (updated Oct 2020)
 UM Department of Archives and Special Collections. A must for any Faulkner afficianado. It's in the J.D. Williams Library, and houses over 300 manuscript collections, the William Faulkner Collection, University archival collections, Mississippi State documents, and in the Mississippi Collections over 20,000 volumes of Mississippiana. It is moving soon to the beautifuly restored and historic Bryant Hall.

Budget[edit]

Try the steak sandwich, but you can't go wrong with the great barbeque (still hickory smoked when most famous Memphis places have switched to gas smokers) or the hamburgers made they way they were 50 years ago. The banana pudding is some of the best you'll ever eat, and you can't beat the price at 97 cents per serving.

By day, "Larry's" is a great place for a hot meal.

 Taylor Grocery (Taylor Grocery), 4 County Road 338, Taylor (8 miles south of Oxford), ☏ +1 662 236-6363, forrest@taylorgrocery.com. This may well be the best catfish place in the world.

Live bluegrass and blues.  Brown Bag (bring your own alcohol) is a must.   Be prepared to wait for at least 30 minutes to an hour, but it's well worth it.  Locals bring their own drinks and tailgate outside on the front porch.   An art gallery is close by, as well as sculptor's and potter's shops, which you can browse while waiting for your table. Down the road is Taylor Creek Farm, where you can find fresh flowers, herbs and eggs, and they welcome folks to tour the gardens during the summer.

Splurge[edit]
City Grocery, 152 Courthouse Square (on the square), +1 662 232-8080.  Upscale dining in the New Orleans tradition.  Good wine list.  Famous for their "shrimp & grits."  Probably the most well-known restaurant in Oxford.  Chef John Currence was nominated for the prestigious James Beard award, the highest national award a chef can receive.  Entrees $20-30.  Reservations not available home football weekends, seat upon arrival.
Drink[edit]
Cold beer is not sold in Oxford, except for bars and restaurants. Either purchase your cold beer at the county line on Hwy 6 or Hwy 7 as you are coming into town, or ice it down. An often told myth is that Oxford does not sell beer cold because the mayor once owned the local icehouse. Open containers are also not allowed in the city limits, but as long as you pour it in a cup, you are fine. If a cop sees a beer can or liquor bottle, he will pour out all of your supply. However, if you have it in a cup, you will not be bothered unless you are extremely unruly. This especially applies to the Ole Miss campus and The Grove.  Just keep it in a cup and pour discreetly. Due to antiquated Southern laws, the Ole Miss campus is wet on liquor only (no beer allowed), except east of Gertrude Ford Boulevard (the old railroad bed), where both liquor and beer are allowed. In any case, alcohol is not allowed in plain view and must be kept in a cup.
Remember, bars in Oxford close early. Monday-Wednesday they close at midnight. Thursday and Friday they close at 1AM. They close at midnight on Saturdays except on game weekends, when they are open till 1AM. Still, most bar goers don't go home and go to bed but instead head to the infamous "late-nights," parties at someone's home or apartment. Despite police efforts to crack down on late-nights, they are still going strong, sometimes numbering into the thousands of partiers. Word spreads about the location of late-nights earlier in the night at the bars. Be sure to secure your beer or liquor for the late-night before you go out, because they will have stopped selling by the time the bars have closed (midnight most days, Sunday it's a "dry" city).
The Chevron at University and South Lamar, called "Chicken-on-a-Stick" because of the drunk food it serves by the same name, is a very popular stopping point between the bars and the late-nights and has achieved legendary status. Several other convenience stores carry the same food minus the tradition. If you are too drunk to drive and have no other way home, you can almost always find a ride at Chicken-on-a-Stick (the Chevron) just after the bars close.
The City Grocery Bar, or "The Grocery," is located above its namesake restaurant and tends to attract a mix between locals, writers, lawyers, and older college students. 
One place to hear live music is Proud Larry's, where local and regional artists perform frequently.

The Library Sports Bar, known as the "Sports Bar", is an addition to the Library Bar & Grill and fills the void of a true sports bar on the Oxford Square.  At the corner of 11th Street and Van Buren - just down from the original Library Bar & Grill. The Library attracts a younger crowd as it is 18-and-up.120 South 11th Street, +1 662 234-1411. It l features talented local bands and entertainment at night. During the day, you can stop by and say hi to Johnny "D" to have lunch and a drink.
Sleep[edit]
While Oxford has no luxury hotels yet, two boutique hotels are under construction just off the Square. One, (The Ava, under construction just off the Square on Jackson Ave., next to the pedestrian/bike bridge) will feature a spa and fine dining.  Until they are built, the closest you will get to luxury is to stay at a bed and breakfast.  Oxford has a large number of hotel rooms for a town of its size.  However, if you are coming for a game weekend, nearly all the rooms are presold as a package deal for the season.  Occasional rooms do open up though, but chances are slim.  The next closest town with motels is Bruce (24 miles) Batesville (25 miles) to the west, Holly Springs (30 miles) to the north, Pontotoc (20 miles) to the east, Grenada (40 miles) to the south, and Senatobia (40 miles) to the northeast.  Many visitors choose to stay in downtown Memphis in order to experience Beale Street and only come in for the game, or they stay in Tunica at a casino. However, it can be very difficult to get in, out, or around Oxford on Game Day. A viable option is to rent an RV in Memphis and stay on campus for free.  You can park your RV and walk wherever you need to go the whole weekend.  If you are staying in Oxford, the Graduate Hotel and the Inn at Ole Miss are the most highly recommended because of the quality of the rooms, the services, and the great locations.

Stay safe[edit]
Oxford is a very safe town, with the court dockets mostly full of minors-in-possession, public drunks, and DUIs. Oxford Police are always nearby and allow little slack for disruptive behavior.  The town is safe to walk at any time of night, with only the most basic precautions necessary.

Cope[edit]
Game Day[edit]
Homecoming 2012 - Ole Miss vs. Auburn
Oxford is very crowded on football game days.  Football is a religion here, and fall Saturdays are the sabbath.  Therefore, expect heavy traffic, hotels that fill months in advance, and no available reservations at restaurants. The Grove opens for tailgating at 6PM Friday night, but the crowds can overwhelm security as early as 4PM Friday night, and all the good spots in the Grove will be gone by 8PM.  Most tailgating is concentrated in the Grove, but it takes place everywhere on campus.  The Circle, next to the Grove, has more of a family atmosphere.  Officially, liquor but not beer is allowed in the Grove, but all alcohol must be kept in a cup and out of plain view. The Grove - Ole Miss vs. Texas - 9/15/2012
Alcohol Policy[dead link].  The university policy on alcohol is very complicated and enforcement of it is even more so.  Liquor is legal on all the campus and beer on the part of campus east of Gertrude Ford Boulevard.  However, all alcohol must remain out of plain view at all times.  Keep it in a cup or in your cooler.  While beer is  illegal in the Grove, the police will not confiscate it if you keep it in a cup.  Police are allowed to search unattended coolers, so keep it at a tent that is attended at all times or put a lock on it.  Bottom line: keep your alcohol out of plain view and under your control, keep your behavior in check, and you won't be bothered by the police.  And don't even think about drinking and driving.
Vaught-Hemingway Stadium Where the three-time national champion Ole Miss Rebels play football.  For online ticket sales and a seating chart, visit the  Ole Miss Ticket Office.  The stadium is officially alcohol-free, but many fans sneak in a flask, and drinking in the club levels and suites is completely ignored. Expect extensive body searches at the visitor and student gates. If you enjoy being molested by a security guard of the same sex, you're in heaven. At the other gates, security generally just looks inside purses and bags.
Game Day Info from the University.  Including tailgating and stadium rules, traffic info, and parking info.
RV information.  The university provides free gravel RV lots at the Old Taylor Road and the Coliseum Drive exits off of the Hwy 6 bypass.  Overflow RV parking is available at the intramural fields, accessed by the Coliseum Drive exit (turn left at the four-way stop).  Paved lots with hookups including cable TV are available, but they must be purchased for the whole season.  The University officially does not allow RV parking before Friday afternoon, but in reality, they allow parking in the gravel lots days in advance.  People are known to never move their RVs from one Saturday to the next.  A private RV park with full amenities is available in town.  Many choose to stay at the more spacious and scenic Sardis Lake, which offers a plethora of cheap RV parking with full hookups in a tree-shaded environment.  It is located between Oxford and Batesville, 15 to 20 minutes from town.
RV information.  Cart Barn Inn @ Yoda Creek has Rv parking.  kay@cartbarninn.com ☏ +1 662-983-7829,  20 minutes south of Oxford down hwy 7 to hwy 9w to Bruce.
Churches[edit]
If your weekend visit to Oxford necessitates a visit with the Deity, there are many local worship options. Some of these houses of worship have enough historic value to warrant a purely secular visit any day of the week. True to its Deep South locale, Oxford is replete with Baptist and Methodist churches, but other faiths are by no means left out in this cosmopolitan university town. Here is a very small sampling of Oxford's larger and historic religious buildings and bodies:

Baptist[edit]
 Antioch Primitive Baptist Church, South 15th Street. Sunday services are at 10:30AM. This congretation was organized in 1836. The congregation has been meeting in the current building since 1949. 
 First Baptist Church (SBC), 800 Van Buren Avenue, ☏ +1 662 234-3515. Sunday services are at 8:30AM, 9:45AM and 11AM. The congregation was founded in 1842 and the original church structure was burned by Union troops in 1864. Current site was obtained in 1881 and the current building was completed in 1952. 
 Second Baptist Church (MBC), 611 Jackson Avenue, ☏ +1 662 234-7868. It was organized by former slaves in 1869. The roots of this faith community stretch back to Baptist and Methodist ex-slaves who built a brush arbor on the edge of the old Pegues Plantation near the current church structure immediately after emancipation. 
Catholic[edit]
St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church (Roman Catholic), 403 University Avenue, ☏ +1 662 234-6073. Catholic presence in Oxford dates back to antebellum times when small numbers of Catholic residents and students at the University relied on visiting priests for spiritual sustenance. St. John's was founded in the 1930s as a mission of Water Valley's St. Patrick's parish. The original church building (a simple neo-classical structure constructed in 1943) and its adjoining rectory/parish hall, played host to federal troops sent to quell the riots surrounding the integration of the University in 1962. These buildings were later declared structurally unsound and were razed in 2003 for the construction of a new church building on the same property. Masses are celebrated on Sundays at 8:30AM, 11AM and 5PM.
Episcopal[edit]
St. Peter's Episcopal Church (ECUS), 113 South 9th Street, ☏ +1 662 234-1269-. Organized in 1851, this was the original seat of the first Episcopal bishop of Mississippi, making this building the pro-cathedral (i.e. preliminary cathedral) for the Episcopal Diocese of Mississippi. First resident pastor was Frederick A.P. Barnard, originally a faculty member at Ole Miss, eventually the university's chancellor and, later, president of Columbia University. The building was completed in 1860 and was the only religious structure within the town limits of Oxford to survive the burning of the town by Union troops in 1864. William Faulkner was a parishioner. Sunday services are at 7:45AM, 9AM, 11AM and 5:30PM. There is a Spanish language service at 7PM.
Methodist[edit]
Old Burns Church/Belfry Building, Original Building - West Jackson Avenue. Oxford's first African-American church, organized by former slaves in 1869 as Sewell Chapel, it was renamed Burns Methodist-Episcopal Church in 1900. An original wood frame structure was replaced in 1910 by the current brick building. The current congregation moved to a modern structure in 1973 on the corner of Molly Barr Road and Washington Avenue. After the congregation moved out, the 1910 building served for a time as an office for author John Grisham. Grisham donated the building for use as a Civil Rights museum. The congregation's current church building is located at 600 Molly Barr Road. Sunday worship service is at 11AM.
Oxford-University Methodist Church (UMC), University Avenue, ☏ +1 662 234-5278. Founded in 1836 as Oxford Methodist-Episcopal Church, the congregation was served by a circuit-riding minister who made regular stops in Oxford for services. The church's first building was on Van Buren Avenue and the congregation went through two more structures on Jackson Avenue before purchasing the current site in 1936. Services began at the current site in 1937 and the current brick sanctuary was completed in 1950. Famous parishioners have included Charles B. Galloway and L.Q.C. Lamar.
Presbyterian[edit]
College Hill Presbyterian Church (PCA), College Hill Road, ☏ +1 662 234-5020. The church was founded in 1835. The building, built using slave labor and bricks fired on the grounds, was completed in 1846. It is the oldest church building in the Oxford area. During the Civil War, the surrounding community of College Hill was invaded by Union General Sherman and his troops in 1862, who occupied the grounds of the church and used the church building for sleeping quarters. William Faulkner was married here in 1929. The original structure and furnishings remain remarkably unchanged. The pulpit, pews and pew gates are original to the structure. The only major structural changes to the original structure were: 1) the addition of a veneer of modern brick which covers the structure's original exterior bricks (though the original brickwork is still viewable at a view points on the east side of the church exterior where some of the modern bricks were purposefully left un-mortared and can be temporarily removed to "peek" at the original bricks beneath), 2) the modern addition of office space in the rear of the structure, and 3) the removal of the building's slave galley (a balcony reserved for slaves to sit in during church services). The exterior doors which once led to the galley, however, still remain, floating ominously above the main entrance to the church, sans stairs.
First Presbyterian Church (PCUSA), 924 Van Buren Avenue, {{phone|+1 662 234-1757}. The first Presbyterian congregation in the town of Oxford was organized in 1837 by early settlers of Scottish descent. The church's original 1847 wood frame building fell casualty to the flames of 1864 (when the courthouse, its square and other buildings and homes in town were burned by federal troops). The current building was built in 1881. Sunday worship services are at 8:30AM and 11AM.
Unitarian-Universalist[edit]
Unitarian-Universalist Congregation of Oxford, 31 County Road 198, ☏ +1 662 513-0970.  An intergenerational community that fosters spiritual growth through free thought and respect for personal beliefs.  Visitors of all faiths and beliefs are welcome.  Services are Sundays at 11AM, and children of all ages are welcome with childcare provided during the service (from 10:50AM -12:15PM.)
Mormon[edit]
