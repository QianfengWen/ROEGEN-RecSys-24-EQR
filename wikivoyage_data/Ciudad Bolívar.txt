Understand[edit]
Ciudad Bolívar is located on the banks of the Orinoco River. It is named after Simon Bolívar, Venezuela's Independence hero.
It is a frequent stopoff point on visit to Angel Falls and is a good place to find tour companies to take you there. Its previous name Angostura (thin ribbon) represents the river's last navigable port.
