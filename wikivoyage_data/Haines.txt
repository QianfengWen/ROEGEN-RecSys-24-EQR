Haines is a small port community (population about 2,000) in Southeastern Alaska on the shores of the Lynn Canal, the state's longest fjord. It is surrounded by glacier-covered mountains of the Coast Range.


Understand[edit]
If you loved the TV show Northern Exposure , you'll love the down-home feel of Haines. It's the kind of laid-back place you picture when you think about an Alaskan town. The first thing you'll notice when you arrive is how scenic Haines is.
Haines is blessed with surrounding natural areas and wildlife in what is known as the "Valley of the Eagles." The area is a magnet for bald eagles, drawn by the warm open water and abundant supply of salmon. More than 3,500 of the birds visit from October to February – during that time a dozen eagles may share a single tree limb.

Get in[edit]
59°13′51″N 135°26′47″WMap of Haines
There are three main ways to get to Haines, which makes Haines more accessible than most other southeast Alaskan communities of its size.

By car[edit]
The only road access to the remainder of the continent is on Highway 3 from Haines Junction, Yukon, located 155 miles away.  At Haines Junction, Highway 3 intersects with Yukon Highway 1 (Alaska Highway).

By plane[edit]
It is possible to fly into 59.247247-135.5294641 Haines Airport, but the only scheduled commercial flights are from Juneau and Skagway. So you can fly Alaska Airlines to Juneau and then catch a smaller bush carrier or charter a flight into Haines. Haines Airport is on the Haines Highway, about 4 miles west of town.

By boat[edit]
See also: Alaska Marine Highway
The third, and probably most popular, way to Haines is by boat.  The primary mode of inter-Alaskan transportation is by the Alaska Marine Highway.  The Lynn Canal route of the ferry system (Juneau-Haines-Skagway) receives a large amount of ferry traffic, especially in the summer.  The 59.281486-135.4631942 Haines State Ferry Terminal is about 4 miles north of town.

By cruise ship[edit]
Haines is a port-of-call to cruise ships, only about 20 calls per season, mainly from the Holland-America Line. The 59.228525-135.4383573 Port Chilkoot Wharf is where the cruise ship docks. If you are on a cruise that visits Haines, you can rest assured that your ship will be the only ship in port, and there won't be any large crowds to contend with in town.

Get around[edit]
Haines is small enough that you can easily walk around the town in an hour or two.
During cruise ship dockings, there is a Shuttle Bus service that runs every 30 minutes.  It starts at the Port Chilkoot Dock, and makes a loop to the Sheldon Museum, Visitor Center, Library, Dalton City, Eagle Foundation, Fort Seward Historic District, and then back to the Dock.
There are no taxis in Haines. Occasionally there is one when someone tries to start a taxi business, but they don't survive. You will need a car, a bike, a shuttle service, or make a friend quick.

See[edit]
59.2267-135.4441 Fort William H. Seward, House No. 1, Fort Seward Dr (above 2nd Ave S and Portage St). On the original Haines Mission grounds, Fort William H. Seward was Alaska's first US army fort, built during the gold rush era (1902). It is a nationally recognized historic site (declared National Historic Landmark in 1978). The Fort is also referred to as Port Chilkoot, a leftover from the Port Chilkoot Company, which was formed after World War II by a group of investors who purchased the Fort from the Federal Government. An increasing number of restaurants, lodges, and art galleries are utilizing the original buildings; e.g., the Fort's hospital is now the Alaska Indian Arts Center. Within the parade ground is Totem Village. Although not part of the original fort, it includes two tribal houses and totem poles and is the home of the Chilkat Storytellers Theater Show, an hour-long performance of Alaska Native dramatization. A walking-tour map of the Fort is available at the Visitors Bureau, or you can just read the historical panels that have been erected there.
