A modern planned city that is well-maintained and well-organised,  Islamabad (Urdu: اسلام آباد) is Pakistan's clean, calm, and green capital. Founded in the 1960s, it attracts people from all over Pakistan, and hosts a large number of diplomats, politicians and government employees, making it one of the nation's most cosmopolitan and urbanized cities. Although it is only the country's ninth largest city, its metropolitan area (encompassing the neighbouring city of Rawalpindi) is the country's third largest conurbation, with a population of over 4.5 million. Lying on the Pothohar Plateau in the north-east, within the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), it is regarded as the most developed city in Pakistan.


Understand[edit]
Islamabad's most recognizable landmark – Faisal Mosque, the national mosque of Pakistan
Although the majority of the population in Islamabad traditionally have been employees of the Federal Government, the wealth of the Musharraf years fuelled a boom in Islamabad and it has become an important financial and business centre. In the last decade there have been vast changes in the city's traditional reputation. From it being a typical 9-to-5 city, Islamabad has become more lively with many new restaurants and hotels springing up to service this new wealth. A lot of international food chains have opened, and generally a great improvement in night life with increasing shopping areas opening till late. However, during winter season streets are considerably quiet after dark.
Even now, Islamabad remains a city where people come from all over the country to enjoy its peaceful, noise-free atmosphere with a lot of greenery and nice surrounding scenery. It also serves as a base camp for people from the south and coastal areas like Karachi, visiting relatively lush valleys such as Swat and Kaghan together with northern areas like Gilgit, Hunza, Skardu and Chitral in the Himalayas mountains.

Zones and sectors[edit]
Islamabad zones map.In reality, sectors F-5 and G-5 are limited to a much smaller area than indicated here.
Zigzag road to lush green Margalla Hills
view of Blue Area, the commercial hub of the city.
ICT covers an area of 1,165.5 km2 (450 mi2), and 906 km2 (349.8 mi2) of that is Islamabad proper, which is divided into five zones:

Zone I – Consists mainly of all the developed residential sectors.
Zone II – Consists of the under-developed residential sectors.
Zone III – Consists primarily of the Margalla Hills and Margalla Hills National Park. Rawal Lake is also in this zone.
Zone IV – The largest in area. Contains a portion of the Islamabad park, along with some rural areas.
Zone V – Consists of the other portion of the Islamabad park, and also some rural areas.
Travellers will soon notice that Zones 1 and 2 are laid out on a grid system comprising sectors. Each sector is identified by a letter of the alphabet and a number, and covers an area of approximately 2 × 2 km (unless it is crosscut by another zone's boundary). Each sector is subdivided into four numbered sub-sectors (e.g. E-7/1, E-7/2, E-7/3, and E-7/4). The sectors are lettered alphabetically A–I and numbered 5–17. There are no sectors numbered 1–4, as the area to the northeast that would otherwise have contained such sectors is not subject to the sector scheme (it also encompasses northeastern "halves" of G-5 and F-5, i.e. what would have been G-5/3, G-5/4, F-5/3, and F-5/4). The following are some of the best-known sectors:

E-7, F-5, F-6, F-7, G-5, G-6, and G-7 are the oldest sectors. F6 and F7 are where most of the action happens, and may be the most desirable option for accommodation, as they are generally posh areas with all the necessary facilities close by. However, the number of government institutions, embassies, and powerful Pakistanis' dwellings in and around these areas also mean a lot of security, concrete barriers, and boom gates, that are fortunately largely absent elsewhere.
E-8 and E-9 are occupied by military housing complexes and are effectively out-of-bounds to travellers.
F-8, F-10, F-11, G-10, G-11, and I-8 are where the 'new money' has been invested.
G-7, G-8, and G-9 are poorer areas where the city planners wanted the cleaners and office clerks to live. But these areas tend to be the only cultured areas in the city – here you would find a common Pakistani rather than a common Islamabadi.
History[edit]
The city of Islamabad is on the Pothohar Plateau which is one of the earliest known sites of human settlement in Asia. Some of the earliest Stone Age artifacts in the world have been found on the plateau, dating from 500,000 to one million years ago. The crude stones recovered from the terraces of the Soan River testify to the endeavours of early man in the inter-glacial period. Items of pottery and utensils dating back to prehistory have been found in several areas.
Limited excavations have confirmed evidence of prehistoric cultures. Relics and human skulls have been found dating back to 5000 BCE that show this region was home to Neolithic man, who roamed the banks of the Soan River. During the Neolithic, people developed small communities in the region around 3000 BCE. At one end of the Indus Valley Civilization, the area was an early habitation of the Aryan community in Central Asia. Their civilization flourished here between the 23rd and 18th centuries BCE. Many great armies - such as those of Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, Timur and Ahmad Shah Durrani - used the corridor through the region on their way to invade the Indian Subcontinent. A Buddhist town once existed in the region and remains of a stupa have been identified in the G-12 sector. Modern Islamabad also incorporates the old settlement of Saidpur. The British took control of the region from the Sikhs in 1849 and built Asia's largest cantonment in the region in Rawalpindi.
When Pakistan gained independence in 1947, Karachi becomes its first capital. In 1960, Islamabad was constructed as a forward capital for several reasons. Traditionally, development in Pakistan was focused on the colonial centre of Karachi, and President Ayub Khan wanted it equally distributed. Moreover, Karachi having tropical weather conditions, was at one end of the country, making it vulnerable to attacks from the Arabian Sea. Pakistan need a capital that was easily accessible from all parts of the country was needed. Karachi, a business centre, was also considered unsuitable partly because of intervention of business interests in government affairs. The newly selected location of Islamabad was closer to the army headquarters in Rawalpindi and the disputed territory of Kashmir in the north.
In 1958, a commission was constituted to select a suitable site for the national capital with particular emphasis on location, climate, logistics, and defence requirements along with other attributes. After extensive study, research, and a thorough review of potential sites, the commission recommended the area northeast of Rawalpindi in 1959. A Greek firm of architects, Konstantinos Apostolos Doxiadis, designed the master plan of the city, based on a grid plan and triangular shape with its apex towards the Margalla Hills. The capital was not moved directly from Karachi to Islamabad; it was first shifted temporarily to Rawalpindi in the early 1960s and then to Islamabad when the essential development work was completed in 1966.
Islamabad has attracted people from all over Pakistan, making it one of the most cosmopolitan and urbanised areas of Pakistan. As the capital city it has hosted a number of important meetings, such as the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation summit. In October 2005, the city suffered some damage due to the 2005 Kashmir earthquake having a magnitude of 7.6. Islamabad has experienced a series of terrorist incidents including the July 2007 Siege of Lal Masjid (Red Mosque), the June 2008 Danish embassy bombing, and the September 2008 Marriott bombing. In 2011, four terrorism incidents occurred in the city, killing four people, including the murder of the then Punjab Governor Salmaan Taseer. Tragic air crashes also took place here: on 28 July 2010, Airblue Flight 202 crashed in the Margalla Hills killing all 152 flight crew and passengers on board and Bhoja Air Flight 213 carrying 121 passengers crashed while making the final approach for landing, killing all on board on 20 April 2012.
Today, Islamabad is considered by some as one of the most extensively and successfully planned cities in South Asia. The city is home to many migrants from other regions of Pakistan and has a modern culture that is not so dissimilar to other internationalised cities.

By bus[edit]
Islamabad Metro Bus
Niazi Express, Skyways and Daewoo Sammi[dead link] (☏ +92 51 111 007 008) are some of the nicer long-haul operators. Skyways offer some direct services to/from Islamabad and Lahore, Peshawar and Karachi. Daewoo has its own terminal on the road from Islamabad just outside Rawalpindi. The majority of buses arrive and depart from Rawalpindi, a few kilometers and a 45-minute taxi ride from Islamabad. It's best to book Daewoo by phone in advance if possible. They serve Karachi, Peshawar, Lahore, Murree, Sialkot, Abottabad, Bahawalpur, Faisalabad and Multan.
By train[edit]
Despite Islamabad have its railway station in sector I-9, majority travel through the railway station in the neighbouring city Rawalpindi, which is a major railway station and has good railway connections with various major cities including Karachi, Lahore & Peshawar.
Pakistan Railways[dead link] premium Green Line service between Islamabad and Karachi offers free Wi-Fi, breakfast, newspaper among other basic facilities to its passengers. The train is air-conditioned and has few stops along the route such as Hyderabad, Lahore and Rawalpindi. Tickets on this route are more expensive compared to other trains.

By taxi[edit]
Taxis in Islamabad are abundant, popular and generally safe. Cost is around Rs 50-60 per sector travelled, depending on your bargaining skills. Prices will be higher at night, especially departing from places like Jinnah Super (F-7). It is always advisable to agree the fare before travelling.
However, most of the people prefer using Careem or InDrive, as ride-sharing is one of the cheaper means of transportation. The cheapest way to travel is through calling Careem Bike.

By car[edit]
Car hire is also a good way of getting around. Although road signs and directions are only available on main roads, the city's grid and numbering system make it relatively easy to find your way around. There are various car hire companies in Blue Area F-6 and also in G-8 Markaz where cars can be hired with drivers. Most major hotels have their own car hire services and are relatively cheap. A tip to the driver at the end of the booking period is always appreciated but not mandatory.

By bus[edit]
The city has implemented two bus rapid transit (BRT) lines.

Makes a nice cycle-ride from Islamabad.   
33.68638973.0763893 Pakistan Museum of Natural History. This is more a place for school trips than a tourist destination - however there is an impressive blue whale skeleton outside.   
33.730573.0914 National Art Gallery, F5/1. Opened in 2007, the gallery is a modern, light filled, air conditioned edifice that would not be out of place in many European cities.

Do[edit]
The Margalla Hills are effectively foothills of the Himalayas – and are very easily accessible from Islamabad. However these are quite big, steep hills, and shouldn't be underestimated – if you are planning on a walk up to the top of the first ridge (i.e. where the shuttered Monal restaurant is) then sturdy footwear, a large water bottle, and a change of t-shirt are necessary (good chance you'll be drenched in sweat by the time you get to the top). Between March and November it is best to start walking in the early morning (before 7:30AM, or 6:30AM in the height of summer) as it is uncomfortably hot during the day.
Go karting - F1 Traxx - Lake View Park (Rawal Lake) - there is another track in Bahria Town, Rawalpindi
Climbing - there is a climbing wall in Rawal Lake's Lake View Park
Para Gliding – at Margalla Hills. The Pakistan Adventure Foundation is the place to call, reservations are recommended.
Cycling – Mountain biking is fast becoming a much-loved activity because of the weather and the terrain. If you're in the mood for some adventurous cycling down one of Islamabad's beautifully scenic bike trails, get your bike ready. Information can again be had from the ASG's hiking publication. Cheap bikes can be purchased for Rs 6,000-10,000 in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. Alternatively you can hire decent quality bikes from K2Riders[dead link] - based in F8/2.

 Art & Craft Village, Shakarparian - Near Rose and Jasmine Garden in Shakarparian National Park (across the Kashmir Highway on 7th Avenue). 11:00 to 19:00. A craft bazaar with a food court serving 5 regional cuisines plus 3 Chai Khanas serving assorted teas and snacks. Built by the local Capital Development Authority but conceptualised and supervised by the Indus Heritage Trust. 
Buy[edit]
Each sector having its own central shopping area (or markaz) where all local amenities are found. Some of the more popular markazes are the F6 Markaz (aka Supermarket) F7 Markaz (aka Jinnah Market), G6 Markaz (aka Melody Park), G9 Markaz (aka Karachi Company) and so on. There isn't much going on in the markets of F8, G7 an G8 that would interest the tourist. Each markaz has its own peculiarities and each one is worth visiting individually. However most things are catered for in each markaz, i.e. clothing, shoes, fast food etc. There's always a real buzz in the evenings when all the shoppers come out, particularly in the run up to Eid.

7th Avenue, at Jinnah Super Market (F7 Markaz), has large selection of western food products.
Super Market (F6 Markaz)
 Metro. Way out in I11 is a huge Walmart type store selling groceries and household goods. Prices are good but not the cheapest in Islamabad - but if you are looking for a western style shopping trolley experience this is your best bet. 
Handicrafts: the Capital Development Authority has established a handicrafts village near super market, where small stalls with handicrafts from around the country are available. You should be able to walk from there to Mahraja (next to united Bakery) and find plenty of other stores much larger and with a much better collection of handicrafts and traditional items. This is a must-visit for all first time visitors and a useful stop for quick gift items for people back home. A good present for the ladies is Pashmina shawls or wraps, which can cost between US$15 and $700. Remember to bargain, you will be charged Gora price.
Art See above. Some of the places to visit are The National Art Gallery and Nomad Art Gallery.
Haroons, a place to shop for gifts and women accessories. In Super Market.
Saeed Book Bank is the largest book store in the city, in the F-7 Markaz. A wide variety, from old books of local interest ("The Story of the Malakand Field Force" by Churchill, for instance) to modern best-sellers. Plenty about geopolitics and war in Pakistan and Afghanistan as well.
Furniture: There are places selling antique or new furniture made from antique wood pieces, such as Wood Heritage, Pak Turk, and another small but packed one in E-7.
Shopping malls[edit]
The Mega Mall of Islamabad, The Centaurus

Eat[edit]
At first glance the visitor may feel that Islamabad offers little to excite the taste-buds, however beneath the surface there is a thriving restaurant scene. There are many typical dhabbas (small restaurants) which offer traditional food. Many of the better restaurants are away from the main markets of F6 and F7. Most do not serve alcohol, but some allow you to bring your own. Call ahead to ask.

 Des Pardes (In Saidpur village off the Margella Road), ☏ +92-51-2825151. lunch & dinner. A great choice for top notch Pakistani food - evenings are best when Saidpur is illuminated with subtle floodlighting, and you can relax on the terrace and admire the architecture. Can be very busy on weekends so reserving a table is recommended - the parking can be chaotic also. Mains Rs 400. 
Rawal Lake[edit]
Lake View Park Restaurant is the only place to eat on the northern part of the lake. Which is a shame as the place is over 1 km from the waters edge and the food is overpriced for what you get.
Drink[edit]
Drinking alcohol in public is nominally banned although most of the top end hotels have their own bars, as do some of the larger embassies if you befriend a diplomat. The windowless basement sports bar in the Marriott is probably the most frequented of the hotel bars.
Most Pakistanis though would find it extremely rude and offensive if you show or drink alcohol in public. Night Life is exists, but it's not easy to find. There are no open 'night clubs' in the city - however periodic special events are organised in various venues about once every two months - spread by word-of-mouth. Less excitingly some of the embassy clubs in the diplomatic enclave have 'dance parties' and the like but these tend to be exclusively expatriate and rather low brow.
Non-Muslim visitors can obtain from the local police a so-called 'non-Muslim declaration'. This permit gives you the right to legally buy a limited amount of alcoholic drinks like bottles of wine or beer. For instance, Pakistan's small Christian minority is by law allowed to consume alcohol.
Try local brands like Murree Brewery, in addition to that there are other brands such as Budweiser and Bavaria with non-alcoholic beer. There is a small off-license around the side of the Marriot hotel (next to the dry cleaners) - you'll need a 'non-Muslim declaration' (or maybe just a foreign passport if you turn on the charm) to be able to buy anything.
In soft drinks, all the usual western brands are available but better to try local limca cola which makes "pop" sound when opened. you can also try Pakola; Pakistan's premier soft drink brand which is available in different flavours like Ice cream soda, Lychee, Orange, Raspberry, Apple sidra, Vino, Double cola, Bubble up etc. A 'fresh lime 7-up' is a better alternative for people who don't like standard soft drinks.
In other drinks try strawberry milk shakes and dhamaka soda (dhamaka means bang - the bang that happens when one opens the bottle) from Jinnah super market.

 Mocca Coffee, Shop #1, Kohsar Market, F-6/3 (Main Kohsar Market). The classic expat coffee shop - typically expensive with exclusive decor, display and sale of world-renowned contemporary Nordic design, such as Georg Jensen, Arne Jacobsen, Stelton, Eva-trio and Rosendahl. 
Sleep[edit]
Budget[edit]
Budget accommodation in Islamabad is fairly lacklustre and of questionable cleanliness. There are many guesthouses around the city that make a nice alternative to a hotel.

The Key Bridge Marriott is the company's longest operating hotel.

Stay safe[edit]
The police have set up numerous checkpoints on roads to sensitive buildings and on the roads entering the city. These are usually harmless and they'll wave you through, but to access Constitution Avenue (including the Serena hotel) the police will want to look in the boot of your car.
While travelling in city, you should keep your national identity card, passport, or driving licence with you to prove your identity.
Crime-wise Islamabad is safe. Men can walk pretty much anywhere in the city day or night with little to fear. Lone women will attract male attention, particularly in areas of the city not often frequented by westerners. The Red Mosque in G6 and immediate surrounds aren't recommended given the history attached to this area.

Emergencies[edit]
The Police emergency number is 15. There are various Police stations in the city with staff available 24/7.
112 from any GSM mobile handset should theoretically forward to the local emergency number, too.

Stay healthy[edit]
Bottled water is a good idea. Although water in Islamabad is generally clean, it is mainly sourced from mountain water and tube wells and may contain minerals your system is not used to. It may also not be stored and carried in the cleanest of ways.
Most locals do not drink tap water but instead draw water from government-installed filtration plants. Tap water is normally boiled and it is strongly suggested that you carry bottled water and request it at all food places. If you are unsure about the hygiene of a particular place, try to avoid ice in all your drinks.
There are 3 major hospitals in Islamabad: the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (also known as PIMS) next to G-8 Markaz, Shifa International Hospital in H-8/1 and the Poly Clinic in sector G-6.
Also, there are various private hospitals in every sector in Islamabad providing extensive health care with different price ranges. Ali Medical Centre in F-8 Markaz is one of them.
The Blue Area and Super Market (F-6) have the two most trustworthy pharmacies: Shaheen Chemists and D. Watson. Both these stores are reliable and will be able to offer sound advice for minor ailments. They also carry a wide variety of European and American foods, albeit at a high price. They may even have a doctor at the facility, should a quick suggestion be required.

Respect[edit]
Although Islamabad may look relatively modern, superficially hinting at a Western lifestyle, there are some basic guidelines to keep in mind given the cultural values of Pakistan's society:

People are very friendly and indeed very good hosts. Many of Islamabad's citizens are well-educated and speak English very well, working for the government and in the private sector. Be gracious in accepting invitations to people's houses for lunch, tea or dinner: it will reflect well on you if you verbally ensure that you are causing them no inconvenience.
Generally, women do not shake hands with men, though this varies greatly by social class, social setting, age and personal upbringing. A good rule of thumb for both men and women: do not shake hands with members of the opposite sex unless they extend their hands first (in which case it would be rude of you not to shake hands). The best way to greet someone is to nod and say "Assalam-u-alaikum": smiling always helps!
Alcohol consumption is banned in Pakistan
It's a good idea to avoid taking photographs of military establishments, police stations and anyone in uniform (army officers wear khaki, naval officers wear white, and the Islamabad police wear navy blue trousers with a light blue shirt). If in doubt, permission can be requested from the officers concerned.
Islamabad is relatively safe, compared to other Pakistani cities, or indeed most other capital cities: violent crime is very rare, but use precautions as you would in any other city.

Newspapers[edit]
The Dawn, The News, The Express Tribune, The Nation and The Daily Times are national  newspapers in English supplemented with local news sections.
Business Recorder is the only newspaper providing national and international business news. However, newspapers like the International Herald Tribune, Financial Times, Khaleej Times, Gulf News, and London's Sunday Times, are also available. These international newspapers usually arrive in Islamabad a day after publishing.
All newspapers (international, national and local) are available at book stores in leading hotels like Serena & Marriott. They can also be purchased from leading book stores such as London Book House (Kohsar Market in sector F-6/3), Saeed Book Bank (Jinnah Super Market in sector F-7), and Mr. Books (Super Market in sector F-6).

Go next[edit]
Islamabad is well situated for day trips and weekend trips to nearby cities and attractions.

Day trips[edit]
Rawalpindi
Taxila, an ancient Buddhist and Hindu site with strong Greek influence from Alexander the Great's time. Worth a visit and a picnic. Should you be interested further in the subject, guided tours can be arranged for sites around the museum.
Murree & the Galis, One hour scenic journey through beautiful mountains to the hill resort of Murree which is a nice place to visit especially during the summer. A small place has a weather entirely different to that of Islamabad and much similar to most cities of Northern Europe. However the town is suffering under the sheer number of visitors and the small number of colonial buildings have been swamped by a plethora of cheap hotels - and consequently many visitors feel the town does not live up to its guidebook hype.  Chairlifts of Murree and Patriata, Kashmir point are attractions for tourists. A 2-km "Mall" is the center of gravity of Murree where all the shops and hotels are located. If you want to escape the crowds head further north towards Nathia Gali where there are several small towns with easy access to the mountains.  The roads to Murree are very winding and busy - and not fun to drive in the dark.  Driving through Murree is also not much fun.
Simly Dam It is about 30 km east of Islamabad (look for the route on Google maps). A very picturesque lake spread over an area of 28,750 acres. There is not much there, some walking trails to the side of the lake (not possible to do a full circuit) and there is a guesthouse / lodge / cafe place on the dam itself.  This isn't a place many Islamabad dwellers visit, and can be eerily quiet - best not to visit alone.
Rawat Fort and the Mankiala Stupa to the south of Rawalpindi can fill an afternoon
Khan Pur Lake a 1-hour drive north-west of the city.
Kallar Kahar lake is 2 hours down the motorway - can go boating on the lake and visit some pleasant nearby shrines.
Ketas Temples and the Khewra Salt mines makes for a pleasant day trip - the Salt Mines are good to visit in the summer as a place to escape the punishing heat of the salt range. The road between Ketas and Khewra is also spectacular.
Malot temple in the Salt Range makes for an off-the-beaten-track destination about a 2-hour drive from Islamabad down the motorway. Coordinates are  32.684537° N  72.799391° E.  You need to drive through the Lafarge cement factory to get there - the vista is as spectacular as the temple - and a nice spot for a picnic.
Chiniot is an oft-overlooked gem just off the motorway near Faisalabad (about a 3-hour drive).  Interesting old town and a centre for wooden furniture manufacture (hence a great place to go if you are furnishing a house).  The Umar Hayat Palace is quite amazing also.
Rohtas Fort 2-hour drive south of Islamabad off the GT road - enormous old fort that makes for a great day trip from Islamabad. Leave the old water well until last.
Peshawar can be visited in a long day trip - about 2½ hours on the motorway - visit the museum, have lunch, then go for a guided wander around the old town before heading back to Islamabad. May not be safe for Westerners.
Weekend trips[edit]
Lahore makes a great weekend destination - although you'll need more than 2 days to see everything.  Gets very hot in the summer however so this makes a good winter weekend break.
Combine a trip to Chiniot and Faisalabad spending a day in each. Staying in Kallar Kahar (a lake halfway to Chiniot) on the Friday night is also a possibility.
Perhaps a bit ambitious for a weekend but you can visit India through the Wagah border.  Usually, visiting Delhi should take you half a day by car, however you will need a visa.  On the way, it is advisable to see the Golden Temple in Amritsar, and many other inspiring sights.
Trips to the northern mountains are possible if flying - PIA flies to Chitral, Gilgit and Skardu - flights can be unreliable with cancellations for poor weather or not enough passengers common.  This makes a weekend trip a bit of a gamble in case your flight is cancelled and you get stuck up north. Also in a weekend there isn't enough time to get in much walking. An alternative is to drive to the Kaghan Valley which is a 6 -hour drive from Islamabad and can be done in a weekend (e.g. leaving Friday lunchtime and overnighting in Abbottabad) - but better to plan 3 or more nights if you can. Beware of landslides however if it has been raining - these can easily get you stranded for a week or more - best to save Kaghan for the dry season.
