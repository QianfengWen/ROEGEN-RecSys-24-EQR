Monsanto's (/mõ.ˈsɐ̃.tu/, mohn-SUHN-too) appearance has not changed in centuries. In 2011, it was home to about 800 people.
At the top of the 122 m (400 ft)-high hill, stands a very old square built fortress or castle, that played an important role in Medieval times; it's said to have been built by the Templars Grand Master and withstood several battles, including the Napoleonic invasions. The walk up to the castle is rewarded by gorgeous views in the whole region.
