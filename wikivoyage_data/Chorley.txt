One of Chorley's main shopping streets.
Chorley is a town in Lancashire, England, in the West Pennine Moors.
Chorley describes itself as "Lancashire's Market Town". The markets take place most days, and continue to attract shoppers from around the local area. Chorley Borough, surrounding the town, includes many charming rural villages, and contrasting types of countryside.

To the east of the town, the terrain rises up into the West Pennine Moors. Relatively low altitude, but still a remote landscape. The terrain to the west of the town could not be more different, with the flat, fertile West Lancashire Mosslands stretching away to the coast at Southport

53.673-2.6312 Preston England Temple (LDS or Mormon Temple), Hartwood Green, Chorley PR6 7EQ (M61 jcn 8 to A6 north). Open most days. The Mormons or Church of Latter Day Saints were almost driven out of the U.S. in the 19th century, but regrouped from their church in Preston to re-establish in Utah and worldwide. This temple, built 1994-98, commemorates that era, and now serves LDS for central and northern England, Scotland, and most of Ireland. Its gleaming white 48 m spire is visible for miles around.  (updated Mar 2019)
53.7329-2.57353 Hoghton Tower, Hoghton Bottoms PR5 0SH (M65 jcn 3 to A675 northwest). Apr-Sep: Su-Th 10AM-4PM; house only by guided tour at 11AM, noon, 1PM, 2PM & 3PM. 16th-century fortified manor house atop a hill. Note the well house, banqueting hall, state bedroom and ballroom, and no less than three "priest holes". There's a fanciful association with Shakespeare and a myth that King James I knighted his dinner as "Sir Loin" steak when he stayed here in 1617. What's genuine is the birth here of Sunday sports: James was persuaded to repeal the sterner sabbatarian rules, and issued the Book of Sports setting out what was allowed, at first for Lancashire, then the whole country. Archery and dancing on Sunday were fine, bear-baiting was definitely out. Adult £10.   (updated Mar 2019)
53.63-2.5154 Winter Hill. At 1,496 ft (456 m), this is the highest point of the West Pennine Moors, on the border with Horwich and Bolton. It adjoins Rivington Pike, with a tower built in 1733. Views stretch to the Lake District, Snowdonia and, on clear days, the Isle of Mann. Various markers and monuments commemorate incidents both apocryphal ("ooh, they were never seen again!") and real, including the 1958 crash of a charter flight from the Isle of Man to Manchester. Towering over all is the 309-m mast of the Arqiva transmission tower which broadcasts TV and radio across the North West of England and beyond.   (updated Dec 2023)
