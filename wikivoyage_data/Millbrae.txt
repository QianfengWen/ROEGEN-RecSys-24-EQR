Millbrae is a city on the Peninsula in the San Francisco Bay Area of California.  It is south of San Bruno and north of Burlingame. It is very close to San Francisco International Airport and is an important Bay Area transit hub because it has the southernmost BART station on the Peninsula and is served by Caltrain.

The large 37.6003-122.38671 Millbrae Transit Center is near the intersection of El Camino Real and Millbrae Avenue. It is served by BART, Caltrain, and SamTrans. This is the terminating BART station for trains going south from San Francisco, so it is a common transfer point for people connecting between BART and Caltrain. There is a BART spur to the San Francisco International Airport (SFO IATA) just north of the Millbrae Station.
You can catch a Caltrain at Millbrae for points further south on the peninsula (a few travel down to Gilroy).  Caltrains going north from Millbrae all terminate in San Francisco at 4th and King Streets.  If your destination in San Francisco or your point of departure from San Francisco is anywhere near the 4th & King Caltrain station (near the South Beach area of SOMA), you should take the Caltrain rather than BART.  The Caltrain trip between San Francisco and Millbrae is 18 minutes ("baby bullet"), 20 minutes (express), or 31 minutes (local).  BART takes 36 minutes to San Francisco's Montgomery Station, and Caltrain is a far more pleasant ride.  However, Caltrain takes more planning; it runs less frequently with more limited hours than BART.

Get around[edit]
The San Mateo Transit District, samTrans, provides bus service around Millbrae and beyond.

From then on, the linear trail goes into an open field and runs just to the west of the middle school. Heading into another patch of eucalyptus trees, the trail crosses two streets as it skirts the southwest corner of the middle school. South of the middle school, the twisty trail ascends and descends through some grassly woodlands until it ends on Hillcrest Drive. (updated Nov 2017)
37.597138-122.3895344 Spur Trail (Southern Section), along Milbrae Ave (a few blocks west of the transit center). Located about half a mile (800 m) south of the northern segment, the southern part of the Spur trail has an east-west orientation. It begins on South Ashton Drive close to where Millbrae Creek dives underground. The trail heads east through a grove filled with different types of trees, ranging from oak and Monterey Pine to the west to mostly eucalyptus to the east. The trail roughly parallels Millbrae Creek for a tiny distance where the creek re-emerges from the ground but then disappears underground under the path. As the trail twists and turns through the Spur property parkland, it parallels Millbrae Avenue and skirts the northern friges of Mills High School's running track/football and baseball fields. The trail turns by a skatepark and several tennis courts before terminating on the corner of Millbrae and Magnolia Drive about two blocks away from the transit center. (updated Nov 2017)
