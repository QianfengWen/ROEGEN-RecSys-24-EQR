Praça da Independência, São Tomé
São Tomé is the capital city of São Tomé and Príncipe, and the largest city, travel hub and main commercial center in the country. It had a population of almost 72,000 in 2015, or over a third of the total population of the country. As it has the only international airport in the country, it plays an important role in the country's small tourism industry. 


Understand[edit]
The city was founded in 1485 in the northeast of the island of São Tomé by Portuguese colonists, who wanted to explore the cultivation of sugar cane. Sao Tome retains much of the colonial architecture, with buildings dating from the 16th century, such as the Fort of São Sebastião, now the National Museum. It is in the city center that the main commercial activities take place.
When to go: December and January are the best for birding as birds adopt their bright breeding plumage. From mid-November to early February turtles nest on the beaches, and you can watch the eggs hatching 45 days later. Humpback whales, killer whales and dolphins can be seen off the northeast coast from August to October. Trekking is best in the dry season from June to September. 

Climate[edit]
The city has a tropical humid climate, with temperatures between 27-31 ºC, and frequent precipitation.
During the dry season from June to September, be prepared for clear skies and a very strong, equatorial sun. There are two rainy seasons – the short rains in October and November and the long rains from February to May.

 Obo Natural Park (30 minutes from the city). Great hiking on several trails. You can stay overnight at the old plantations 'roças'. The lightest rainforest trek is the round trip to Lagoa Amelia, which takes about 4-5 hours. For longer treks, you must organise transport, guides, and accommodations. You can pick up guides from Bom Successo on the way. A 2-day and 2-night trek would be from Bom Successo to Roca Bombain, overnight in Roca Bombain, and then Bombain to Roca Sao Joao dos Angolares.
