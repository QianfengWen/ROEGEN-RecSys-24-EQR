Île d'Orléans is an island in the Saint Lawrence River about 5 km (3.1 mi) east of Quebec City.
The island was one of the first parts of the province to be colonized by the French, and a large percentage of French Canadians can trace ancestry to early residents of the island. The island has been described as the "microcosm of traditional Quebec and as the birthplace of francophones in North America."


Understand[edit]
The rural, pastoral and historic Île d'Orléans represents the tidal divide of the St. Lawrence, where fresh water begins to mix with the sea at the island's northeastern point. A National Historic Site of Canada, the island has over 600 recognized heritage buildings and six municipalities:

Sainte-Famille,
Saint-François-de-l'Île-d'Orléans,
Saint-Jean-de-l'Île-d'Orléans,
Saint-Laurent-de-l'Île-d'Orléans,
Sainte-Pétronille and
Saint-Pierre-de-l'Île-d'Orléans.
The island is 34 km (21 mi) long and 8 km (5.0 mi) wide at the widest point. It has a hilly relief, small valleys, and gradual crests that reach a maximum height of about 150 m (490 ft) at Sainte-Pétronille and Saint-Laurent in the south.
Since the days of the first French settlers, agriculture has been the main economic activity. The island, known as the "Garden of Quebec", is famous locally for its produce, especially strawberries, apples, potatoes and wineries. Sugar maple stands produce maple syrup and other products.
While the old trades of fishing and boat building have been abandoned, the island's rich cultural heritage and pastoral scenery has led to a flourishing tourism industry. it offers many bed-and-breakfast inns, regional cuisine restaurants, roadside fruit stands, art galleries and craft shops.
Today the island is a mix of suburban communities and farms. It is a popular destination for daytrippers and bicyclists.

History[edit]
The island had long been inhabited by the First Nations (aboriginal) peoples. The Huron called it Minigo (meaning "Enchantress", because of its charm). The French explorer Jacques Cartier first set foot on the island in 1535 near the present-day village of Saint-François. He called it Île de Bascuz (from Bacchus) because of the abundance of wild grapes growing on the island. Officials later changed the name to Île d'Orléans in honour of the second son of King Francis I, Henri II, the Duke of Orléans.
Early French settlers, immigrating mostly from the Normandy and Poitou regions in France, were attracted to the island because of its fertile soil. They colonized it according to the seigneurial system of New France, which is still evident in its layout, featuring residences close together, with outlying long, narrow fields and a common. In 1661, the first parish of Sainte-Famille was founded. By 1685, there were 1205 mostly French inhabitants.
Jean Mauvide, a surgeon for the King of France, built the Manoir Mauvide-Genest in 1734 as his residence. In 1759 it was occupied by British General Wolfe when his forces occupied the island shortly before the Battle of the Plains of Abraham during the Seven Years' War.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The island is accessible from the mainland via the Île d'Orléans Bridge from Beauport. Route 368 is the sole provincial route on the island. It crosses the bridge and circles the perimeter of the island.

By bus[edit]
There is a weekday commuter bus (the PLUMobile) which makes three trips a day M-F between Québec City and the island.
Many tour buses from Québec City visit the island, often with a stop at Montmorency Falls or the Sainte Anne de Beaupré church on the north shore in the same region.
