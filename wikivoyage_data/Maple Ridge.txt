Maple Ridge is a city of about 82,000 people (2016) on the north shore of the Fraser River in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia. Haney, an eastern district of Maple Ridge, has a century-long history as a commercial centre.

Maple Ridge is made up of several different historical areas: Albion, Haney (downtown), Iron Mountain, Kanaka Creek, Port Hammond, Ruskin, Silver Valley, Thornhill, Webster's Corners, Whonnock, and Yennadon. Some of these areas are identified with a cultural group. For instance, Albion and Webster's Corner are represented by the many Finnish families that settled in the area. While Port Hammond is known for its small cottage-like mill houses built by the local mill to house its workers. Ruskin is the location of a community hall of the Sons of Norway, although the area was founded by English followers of John Ruskin. Kanaka Creek began was a community for Kanaka employees of Fort Langley.
Port Haney, on the Fraser River to the southwest of downtown Haney, is the site of the West Coast Express commuter rail station. It is a heritage district created to protect some of the remaining buildings from earlier times. In addition to buildings already on-site when this was the steamboat landing and the Canadian Pacific Railway station, other heritage buildings from around the City of Maple Ridge were relocated to Port Haney to preserve them and enhance the heritage flavour of the location.

Pitt Lake
Early settlers in Maple Ridge engaged in forestry and agriculture. Forestry companies continue to be the largest private-sector employers in the district. They include companies that manufacture building materials, yachts and poles. The soil and climate are not well-suited to the production of traditional food crops, but berry crops, nurseries and horse breeding are profitable sectors.
The City of Maple Ridge has become a popular location for feature films and television series. On almost any day there is a film or TV crew working in the city. The Ridge Film Studios is in an old retail space in the downtown and serves as a set location for episodic television programs. Maple Ridge's film roots go back to the 1970s when scenes for the feature film Rambo were shot here. Over time the city has become a background for a number of films and TV series including The X-Files, Bordertown, Smallville, Bird on a Wire, We're No Angels, Percy Jackson & the Lightening Thief, and Stargate SG-1.

Get in[edit]
See Vancouver for options to get in the Vancouver area by plane, by bus, and by train, and by boat.

By car[edit]
Maple Ridge lies along Highway 7 and can be accessed from the west via Pitt Meadows or from the east via Mission. From Highway 1, you can take the 176th St. and 192nd St. (eastbound only) exits in Surrey, or the 200th St. exit in Langley and cross the Golden Ears Bridge into Maple Ridge.

From Vancouver or its airport (YVR IATA), expect at least a one-hour commute by car during off peak hours, or over two hours by bus.
The Pitt Meadows Regional Airport is the only Fraser Valley airport (other than water airports) on the Fraser River's north side. It is 2.5 km (1.6 mi) east of the confluence of the Pitt and Fraser rivers, and serves the area north of the Fraser River from Mission up to and including Vancouver.
Abbotsford International Airport, which is 40 km (25 mi) away in Abbotsford, offers flights daily throughout Canada and to the Caribbean and the United States.

TransLink's bus services in Maple Ridge are slim but sufficient. The 701 and 791 buses run along Dewdney Trunk Road and will take you to the main spots in town. From there community shuttles can take you the rest of the way, but they run infrequently.
There are also a few cab companies based in Maple Ridge.

Map of Maple Ridge
There isn't much to see in Maple Ridge. Probably the biggest attraction is a large clock with a steel horse monument on top, outside City Hall on Dewdney Trunk Road. In the past, its limbs would move every 15 minutes to make the horse stand up on its hind legs, but apparently it doesn't even do that anymore.

 The Arts Centre and Theatre (ACT), 11944 Haney Place, ☏ +1 604-476-2787. The principal venue for performing arts in Maple Ridge. The ACT has received a gold certification from the Rick Hansen Foundation Accessibility Certification program. (updated May 2018)
 The Maple Ridge Art Gallery, 11944 Haney Place. Tu-Sa 10AM-4PM. Focusing on local artists and art students. (updated May 2018)

Buy[edit]
Maple Ridge has embraced its reputation as being a cheaper place to live, suitable for seniors and lower income families. As such, there are plenty of locally owned shops offering decent quality products for good prices, as well as plenty of discount and dollar stores.

The area around Highway 224 and Lougheed is friendly although a bit backward in a lot of ways. There is a problem with an abundance of drug users, drunks, beggars, etc. Look where you are going and common sense applies.
