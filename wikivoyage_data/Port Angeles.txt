Port Angeles is the largest city in the Olympic Peninsula region of Washington, dubbed as the "Center of it All" for the specific part of the state. It is the county seat of Clallam County. It's a great place to start for a day trip to Hurricane Ridge or a vacation to explore all of the Olympic National Park. Outdoor sports like kayaking, biking or hiking are very popular, while the quaint shops attract shoppers downtown and the expansive waterfront provides relaxation. With ferries coming and going all day, Port Angeles is the departure point for a trip to Victoria (British Columbia). Beautiful Pacific beaches are nearby and the lavender fields and berry farms of Sequim beckon all summer. Port Angeles is the place to be when it comes to experiencing all that the Olympic Peninsula has to offer.
Due to the vast and spreading area, this article covers listings as far west as Joyce on Highway 112 towards Neah Bay.


Understand[edit]
Port Angeles is on the northern tip of the Olympic Peninsula at the northwestern side of the state of Washington in the United States. Comparably however, it is closer to Victoria (British Columbia's capital) than the state capital of Olympia!
Like most of Washington, the development of the city revolves around its nature. Pitted closely by the Olympic National Park and the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Port Angeles is the gateway for outdoor adventure, with roads leading to breathtaking lakes, stunning vistas, and the towering Olympics. Though notably less notorious than its 'angelic' counterpart in California, this quiet town had its great times when the explorers map the area and traders set posts there thanks to its deep waters.

History[edit]
The area around Port Angeles was inhabited predominantly by the Indian tribes of Klallam and Makah in an area abundant of natural resources: coniferous forests and deep blue sea that sustain prolific wildlife & marine life for daily survivals.
The first non-native sighting of the peninsula was made by explorer Juan Perez in 1774, while the first sailing along the Strait of Juan de Fuca was recorded by Captain Charles Barkley who named the water body after the Greek explorer (Ioannis Phokas) striving to seek the Strait of Anián, which legend has it is actually this same water passage. The city was then named "The Port of Our Lady of the Angels" by Spanish explorer Francisco Eliza in 1791 as it provides a haven from the rough seas of the strait, before it was incorporated to the namesake town in 1861.
Port Angeles' prime location attracts a couple aspiring businessmen to set afoot and develop the land further. Beginning with a port of entry for imported goods in the 1860s to being a federal townsite for lighthouse & military. It was the second city fully plot by the federal government after Washington, D.C, earning the city a nickname "Second National City". Alongside the federal government, entrepreneurs were trying their luck by erecting timber businesses and a fisherman wharf, and along with it commercial industries for incoming settlements. Through the next 100 years, some of the largest sawmills have bankrupted and replaced by other money-making sectors, yet the city has always been a lovable place to live: not too quiet like a village, but not too crowded like metropolitan cities.
Today, the city has a population of around 50,000 with both outside settlements and Indian natives living in harmony.

Average max. and min. temperatures in °C
Precipitation+Snow totals in mm


Like the rest of western Washington, most of the rain falls in fall and winter before tapering off in spring and gloriously sunny on most summer days. Comparatively speaking however, the amount of rain the city gets is one of the lowest in the peninsula at 25 inches (640 mm) thanks to the Olympic rain shadow; Forks, a town 60 miles (97 km) west of Port Angeles, gets more than thrice the amount of annual rainfall!
Though snow is a rare occurrence, it is more susceptible than Seattle due to its unique topography: frigid cold air that occasionally blows from Canada slams into the Olympics above Port Angeles, often times keeping the low temperature longer than other areas of the peninsula.
Thanks to the moderating ocean effect, summers are comfortably warm with high temperatures usually no higher than the 70s (F, about 26°C), and winter temperatures rarely fall below freezing except during the above situation.

Get in[edit]
MV Coho ferry leaving Port Angeles harbor for Victoria, BC Canada.
By car[edit]
The main road traversing Port Angeles is the US Highway 101, which loops around the Olympic Peninsula. The nearest major towns are Forks, 1 hour to the west, and Sequim, 30 minutes away in the east.

By plane[edit]
The William R. Fairchild International Airport (CLM  IATA) is on the west side of the city. The airport is used primarily for charter and general aviation purposes.

Be sure to have the proper travel documents to cross the border between Canada and the United States if arriving and/or departing through Victoria.

West of Port Angeles is the "adventure" part of the trail, for which a cross-country mountain bike is recommended. The trail is non-technical single track, making it an introductory level XC, challenging but doable on a loaded touring bicycle.

Most visitors go to and around the town by car, especially those who would venture far out into the Olympic National Park or anywhere off the Hwy 101 corridor. Parking is generally easy to find, but the downtown area only allows 2 hours of street parking. Taking the bus up here (see 'By bus' under 'Getting in' in the above) from Sea-Tac and renting car here may cheaper than renting a car at the airport, especially with the 12% airport surcharge, and driving up here especially.

Connect[edit]
Most telecom companies are able to stream 4G-LTE internet speed at the downtown area, but it can quickly deteriorate the further away you are from Highway 101. In the national park, coverage can be spotty at Lake Crescent, to non-existent at Hurricane Ridge.
The area codes for Port Angeles, and Western Washington as a whole, are 360 and 564. Because their areas overlap, all numbers must be dialed with the area code, including local calls.
You may even get Canadian networks at times which could lead to roaming costs; but it will be helpful for Canadians calling back home.
