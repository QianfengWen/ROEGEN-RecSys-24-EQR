Do[edit]
Soak in the waters from the hot springs. There are several commercial operations that use the waters with varying degrees of gimmickry, but in addition, the town maintains a bathhouse that is free (under the terms of the treaty whereby a local Indian tribe ceded access to the spring in the 19th century) and open to the public during daylight hours.
