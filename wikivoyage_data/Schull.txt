Schull (pronounced "skull") is a harbour town on the Mizen Head peninsula of County Cork, at the southwest tip of Ireland. The name means school, and was first documented in 1199 suggesting a religious seminary, but there's no trace of that. Once a fishing port, Schull is now a tourist resort, with a population in 2016 of 700. It's the obvious base for exploring Mizen Head and this page describes amenities and attractions there.

Get in[edit]
Schull main street
Bus Eireann 237 runs daily from Cork via Bandon, Clonakilty, Rosscarbery and Skibbereen. There the service branches, with three buses continuing to Ballydehob and Schull, a journey of 2 hr 15 min, and two persevere as far west as Goleen. The other buses turn south at Skibbereen to Baltimore.
On Tuesday morning a bus runs from Goleen via Schull and Durrus to Bantry, returning early afternoon. There's a bus Tu-F along the main road between Bantry, Durrus, Ballydehob and Skibbereen, but it doesn't serve Schull.
The 51.527-9.5481 main bus stop is next to the library and Bunratty Inn.
By car follow N71 from Cork and turn off at Ballydehob.

See[edit]
Edge of the known universe: Schull is the last place on Earth where you'd expect to find a Planetarium. It's on Colla Rd and open July-Aug M W F, adult €6, child €4. On any clear night find somewhere away from streetlights and admire the night sky.
51.514-9.6441 Altar Wedge Tomb is 7 km west of Schull on R592. The style is late Neolithic / Early Bronze Age, circa 2500-2000 BC, and it was primarily a grave rather than a ritual altar.
51.495-9.7112 Goleen is a small harbour village with pubs, a restaurant, and a large 19th century neo-Gothic Roman Catholic church.
51.475-9.7433 Tooreen is a collection of megaliths: Tooreen and Arduslough Wedge Tombs, Giant's Grave, and an Ogham Stone.
51.47-9.7254 Crookhaven refers to the village at the end of R591, and the large sea inlet sheltered by its peninsula. It's popular for sailing and has B&B and two pubs. The other local sport is offering implausible explanations to visitors curious about the abandoned buildings on the hillsides: Aztec temples? Leprechaun treacle factories? No, just quarry buildings.
51.448-9.7725 Brow Head is the most southerly point on mainland Ireland, pipping Mizen Head to the title by a few metres. Park on the Crookhaven lane and walk up the track rather than risk getting snarled. There are remains of copper miners' cottages and a Napoleonic-era signal station. From 1904 Marconi used Brow Head as a wireless signal station. Out to sea is Ireland's most southerly point of all, Fastnet.
51.47-9.786 Barleycove is a sandy beach and village resort. There's accommodation, which hasn't improved the view.
51.45-9.8197 Mizen Head is Ireland's most southwesterly point. Park up at the Visitor Centre, which has a small exhibition, then continue on the paved path. The Head is almost an island, historically reached by a perilous path down and up again, but the chasm is now spanned by a footbridge.
The bridge to Mizen Head
51.54-9.6648 Dunmanus is a little cove and harbour north side of the peninsula, presided over by the obligatory crumbling tower house.
51.62-9.5269 Durrus is the village at the head of the inlet separating Mizen Head from the middle peninsula, Sheep's Head. See Bantry for amenities and attractions in this area.
51.5-9.5510 Long Island or Inishfada is reached by ferry from Colla. It's about 5 km long by 0.8 km wide, with a lane straggling along it. It's mostly farmland with some old copper mines, and ruined cottages from before the Famine, when the population peaked at 300. Copper Point (or White Tower) Lighthouse stands near the ferry landing. There's no accommodation, shelter or other facilities so a day trip will be plenty.
51.507-9.50411 Castle Island is privately owned, changing hands in 2020. It's just grazing land and the castle is a stump. There's no ferry.
51.516-9.46812 Horse Island is likewise privately owned and changed hands in 2020. There's no ferry or public access.
For Heir Island sail from Cunnamore near Skibbereen. For Sherkin Island sail from Baltimore.
