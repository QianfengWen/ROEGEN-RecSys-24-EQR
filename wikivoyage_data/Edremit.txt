Edremit is a city in the Northern Aegean Region of Turkey. It’s a few km inland from the tip of the Gulf of Edremit, a large inlet of the Aegean Sea. Small resorts straggle along the coast, the main ones being Altınoluk, Akçay and Burhaniye, with Güre inland on the slopes of Kazdağı, the ancient Mount Ida. These resorts are also described on this page. The combined district had a population of 161,145 in 2020.


Understand[edit]

Edremit is named for Adramytteion, which lies somewhere beneath its modern streets. That ancient city had disappeared before the Turkish tribes assailed the area, and it was an early Ottoman conquest, by Orhan in 1336. However like other coastal towns it continued to have a majority Greek population: Dr Panos Dukakis, the father of Governor Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, emigrated from Edremit in 1912. Murderous ethnic conflict broke out here in 1914, continuing through the First World War into the follow-on Greek-Turkish War. The 1923 Treaty of Lausanne deported the Greeks, who were replaced by Turks displaced from the Balkans plus immigrants from Anatolia.
The lowlands around town grow olives and other produce, while the slopes just north are forested, so Edremit's industries are agricultural. 
Turizm Danışma the tourist office is on Ismail Kızıklı Cd near Ören beach west of Burhaniye, +90 266 416 3500. It's open M-F 08:30-12:30, 13:30-17:30, Sa Su 10:30-16:00. Other "tourist offices" across the district are travel agencies and commercial outlets marketing their own tours or accommodation.

39.55527.0141 Balıkesir Koca Seyit Airport ((EDO  IATA)), Bostancı, Edremit, ☏ +90 266 376 1297. Previously known as Edremit Körfez, this changed its name in 2012 to honour Koca (Corporal) Seyit, heroic gunner of 1915. What they didn't do is make it in any way more convenient for Balıkesir 90 km east. It has flights by Turkish Airlines twice daily from Istanbul IST (1 hr) and once from SAW; flying from Ankara involves a change so you might be quicker by bus. In summer there are occasional flights from Düsseldorf. There are car hire desks in Arrivals.   (updated Jul 2022)
Edremit is on the Istanbul - Izmir bus route, so it has direct services every hour or so round the clock. From Istanbul these take 7 hours via Bursa and Balıkesir, fare 500 TL, and from Izmir 3 hours for 140 TL. Direct buses also run from Ankara (8 hr 30 min, 500 TL) via Eskişehir, Balıkesir and Bursa, and from Çanakkale (2 hours, 130 TL) on their way to Izmir. Operators are Metro Turizm, Pamukkale and Flixbus.
39.594127.0142 Otogar the bus station is central in Edremit town.

Get around[edit]
Dolmuşes radiate from Edremit to all the other townships. Don't use the inter-city buses for the short hop between the Edremit Gulf towns; they probably wouldn't sell you a ticket.

 Ethnography Museum (Ayşe Sıdıka Erke Etnografya Müzesi), Yılmaz Akpınar Blv 12a, Edremit (500 m southeast of otogar), ☏ +90 266 374 1718. Daily 09:00-17:00. Small fusty museum in Edremit town centre. Adult 2 TL. (updated Jul 2022)
Burhaniye town centre is modern, but Hacı Ahmet mosque south along Atatürk Cd is from 1798. It's built in the style of a Greek basilica but was always a mosque, not a converted church. There are pleasant cobbled streets south of it. In the centre, look out Koca and Çarşı mosques.
Akçay beach is crowded in summer
39.50426.9811 National Forces Culture Museum (Kuvayi Milliye Kültür Müzesi), Fidanlık Sk, Burhaniye (Burhaniye town centre). Daily 09:00-17:30.

(updated Jul 2022)
39.500726.93322 Adramyttium was a coastal city founded in the 6th century BC. It lay at the edge of several empires, so it was warred over by Persia, the Grecian states, Rome, the Norman Crusaders, Genoa and others. The original site is now in the midst of Ören beach strip and is still under excavation, but you can peek through the fence at the work in progress. A Pegasus statue was dug up - a modern replica has been set up north side of the site. At some point Adramyttium relocated to what is now Edremit, but nothing of this Mark II city remains. It's not known when or why it moved, but 6th to 12th century AD through harbour silting is the best guess.
39.48626.94743 Our Village Museum (Bizim Köy Müze Hareketli Etnoğrafya Galerisi) is on the main highway towards Ayvalık and Izmir. It's kinda kitsch and retail-oriented, which is why it's open daily 08:00-00:00.
39.4726.864 Pelitköy is a beach resort on the cape west of Burhaniye. Its antiquities have moved to museums elsewhere.
39.438726.94815 Şahinler east of Pelitköy, 7 km from the highway, is the site of a "painted mosque". Don't be disillusioned by the mosque's very plain, boxy appearance from the outside; its interior is richly decorated with atypical floral and landscape paintings.
39.4326.8356 Karaağaç is a small resort further south. Ancient Kisthene (Κισθήνη) lay somewhere south near Gömeç, but until they find it, you can't go and see it.
See Ayvalık for sights further west and south towards Izmir.
39.58526.9257 Akçay is a large beach resort at the head of the gulf, with the widest choice of accommodation and eating places.

39.586226.880210 Kazdağı Museum is a small museum at the foot of the road up to Güre. It's open daily 10:00-18:00, adult 8 TL, child 5 TL. 200 m up that road you can see the foundations of the ancient city of Astyra.
39.571526.786411 Antandrus (Ἄντανδρος) was a Hellenistic city on Devren hill. Excavations and discoveries continue, but you can look at the work in progress here and at the necropolis 500 m further west.
Hasan drowned but you'll be fine
39.642726.919612 Hasanboğuldu is a scenic mountain valley: from the coast highway east of Akçay, follow the lane north for 5 km through Zeytinli. There are waterfalls and ponds you can plunge in, where the steady temperature of 7°C will get your attention. There's a picnic area, camping and eating places. The name means "Hasan drowned" and there's a mawkish folk tale of unrequited love. Hasan the lowlander twice failed the test to marry the sturdy highlander Emine: by failing to tote a sack of salt that she wouldn't blink at, and then by drowning himself in a pool that hundreds of visitors actually find refreshing. So Emine hanged herself, but the upside is that she carried the salt home first, and there isn't a tree called "Emineasıldı".
39.726.8513 Kaz Dağı is a mountain of 1774 m. In legend it was Mount Ida, where the gods reclined and watched the progress of the Trojan Wars. Its south slopes towards the gulf are a national park, Kazdağı Millî Parkı, and the main access is by the lane winding up from Pınarbaşı. It can also be approached from the north via Bayramiç; this side is not within the park.
Altınoluk is the westernmost resort along the coast of Edremit district, see "Go" marker. Lots of accommodation and eating places. Some of these use "Güre" as their postal address, but see above for that hillside village.
See Assos for the next small resort west, Küçukkuyu. Here you branch off on the coast road to Behramkale, for the ancient citadel of Assos.
39.55827.114 Havran is a small town with a museum and a memorial to local hero Corporal Seyit. In 1915 he was a gunner at  Kilitbahir repulsing the Allied fleet, but his crane for loading the massive shells was knocked out. He hefted and loaded three shells with his own brute strength, and the third of them disabled and sank a French cruiser.
