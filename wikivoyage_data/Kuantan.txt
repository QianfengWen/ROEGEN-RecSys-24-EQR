By bus[edit]
Kuantan Sentral Terminal
3.80528103.328142 Terminal Kuantan Sentral (Kuantan's long-distance bus station, new in August 2013) is several kilometres from the city centre, at Bandar Indera Mahkota (basically, in the middle of nowhere). A rapidKuantan bus (#303, RM2) will bring you to the city local bus terminal (3.81204103.322773 Hentian Bandar), or taxis to the city centre will cost about RM20.00.

To/from Cherating: Catch a Sihat Bas or Mira heading for Kemaman and get off along the main road at the Cherating turn-off. The journey may take about an hour. In Kuantan, catch the buses at the local bus station on Jalan Besar. From Cherating, walk out onto the main road and wait for any Kuantan-bound (south-bound) bus.
To/from Singapore: Transnasional operates a twice-daily bus service from its Beach Road office (as of May 2014) Travel time is 6 hours, with a stopover in Larkin terminal (JB). For a cheaper alternative, go to Larkin and book the bus from there instead.
By car[edit]
The East Coast Expressway connects Kuantan to Karak and Kuala Terengganu, and continues from Karak as the Kuala Lumpur-Karak Expressway onward to Kuala Lumpur. The distance to Kuala Lumpur is approximately 250 km can be covered in 3-3.5 hours, while the distance to Kuala Terengganu is approximately 230 km and can be covered in 2.5-3 hours. The East Coast Expressway is served by evenly distributed stop-over areas that are equipped with toilets, sundry shops and food stalls. You may exit at either the Gambang or Kuantan exit. Both expressways are toll roads to travel the entire journey via the expressways costs RM27.60 for a car. There is no expressway between Kuala Terengganu and Kota Bharu, so if you are coming from Kota Bharu, you will need to drive on regular country roads up to Kuala Terengganu where you can then get on the expressway towards Kuantan.
Federal route 2 also links Kuala Lumpur to Kuantan. As it is an ordinary road, it has no toll. However it is a somewhat slower route than the expressway as there are traffic lights along the way and a lower speed limit.
There is no expressway southward towards Johor Bahru, so you will have to drive on regular country roads with lower speed limits and traffic lights; it would take about 4.5-5 hours to cover the distance of approximately 430 km.
