Go next[edit]
Jackson, Wyoming, about 33 miles and a 45-minute drive to the east, is the "big city" that some Driggs residents commute to every day and probably the most obvious place to base yourself next if you want to continue your visit to the Tetons and indeed remain in Teton County (but in a different state).
Further north are Grand Teton National Park and Yellowstone National Park.
To the west are the heavily Mormon college town of Rexburg (pop. 31,000 as of 2020) and the city of Idaho Falls, which at about 65,000 as of 2020 is over six times as big as Jackson and with a metro area that has 100,000 more inhabitants yet still is not far from nature at all.
