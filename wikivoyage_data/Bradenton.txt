Stay safe[edit]
For the most part Bradenton is a safe city, with crime rates among the lowest in Tampa Bay Area. However some areas, especially south of downtown, tend to have a higher concentration of crime, especially at night.
Don't walk around by yourself late at night or carry around expensive objects or large amounts of cash. Driving is normally pretty safe, though carjackings have been known to happen. When driving around at night, lock your car doors and windows and stick to major roads to avoid getting lost and ending up in a bad neighborhood.
