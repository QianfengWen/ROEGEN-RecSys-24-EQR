The industrial inland port of Runcorn is a treasure trove of architectural styles, from medieval ruins to 1970s utopia. Its impressive bridges across the River Mersey mark the gateway north to cosmopolitan Liverpool and south to leafy Cheshire. Very much off the tourist trail, this town of 62,000 people (2021) nonetheless has some surprising hidden gems for curious urban explorers.


Understand[edit]
Runcorn was founded in 915 AD as a Mercian fortress to guard against Viking invasion at a narrowing of the River Mersey. The earliest written reference to the town is in the medieval Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, where it is spelled "Rumcofan", literally meaning 'a wide cove or bay'. To this day, there is a friendly rivalry with the townsfolk of Widnes to the Viking north.





Did you know...
The remains of the Mercian fort were discovered by the Victorians when digging foundations for the railway bridge across the Mersey, so they styled the bridge to look like the towers of a castle.


Runcorn was a small, poor village until the industrial revolution in the 18th century when the extension of the Bridgewater Canal to the town made it an industrial hub.
Although an ancient settlement, it was designated a 'new town' in the 1960s and greatly expanded eastwards, swallowing neighbouring settlements. Idealistic planners created a brand new town centre with 'Shopping City', an Amercian style mall, at its heart.  So Runcorn effectively has two town centres; the 'Old Town' and 'The City'.

Get in[edit]
The tolled Mersey Gateway Bridge
By plane[edit]
The town is well placed between the North West's two main international airports; Liverpool John Lennon Airport and Manchester Airport. Both are easily accessible via the road and railway networks. Use Runcorn station for services to Liverpool John Lennon Airport and Runcorn East station for Manchester Airport.

By train[edit]
Runcorn has two railway stations:

53.338633-2.7393751 Runcorn Station, Shaw Street. Runcorn station is in the Old Town. Use this station for services north to Liverpool, west to Chester, and south to Birmingham and London. Trains here are operated by Avanti West Coast, West Midlands Trains and Transport for Wales. West Midlands services stop at Liverpool South Parkway (for Liverpool John Lennon Airport), whereas Avanti services head straight for Liverpool Lime Street, a journey which takes around 20 minutes. Use Platform 1 for Chester, Birmingham New Street and London Euston. Use Platform 2 for Liverpool South Parkway and Liverpool Lime Street. The station has a small shop, two waiting rooms, two lifts and a first class lounge. 
53.327926-2.6655122 Runcorn East Station, Barnfield Avenue. Runcorn East station is in the New Town to the east. Use this station for services west to Chester and North Wales, and east to Manchester. It is a small, unmanned station and you will need to either get a taxi or a bus if travelling to the town centre from here. It also has two platforms. Use Platform 1 for Manchester Piccadilly and Platform 2 for Chester and Llandudno. Trains to Manchester Piccadilly take around 45 minutes, to Chester take 30 minutes, and to Llandudno take an hour and thirty minutes. 
By car[edit]
Runcorn is well connected to the motorway network. To the south is the M56 motorway to Manchester, Chester and North Wales. The M6 lies to the east and the M62 is to the north in the neighbouring town of Widnes.
The two road bridges across the Mersey for Liverpool are tolled. There are no toll booths but you must pay the toll to Merseyflow online by midnight the following day or face a £40 penalty.

By bus[edit]
There are good bus connections with neighbouring cities and towns, including Liverpool, Chester, Widnes, Frodsham and Warrington.
There are two main bus interchanges. One is in the Old Town near the railway station and the other at Shopping City.

By boat[edit]
Bridgewater Canal route map
The town has two canals. The Manchester Ship Canal is not open to non-commercial traffic, but the Bridgewater Canal is open to public use and is popular with pleasure boaters. The Bridgewater Canal terminates in Runcorn Old Town but there are plans to reopen the flight of locks to connect the Bridgewater Canal with the Manchester Ship Canal and the River Weaver Navigation, creating a second Cheshire ring.
There are two canal boat docks in Runcorn. Waterloo Junction is the main dock in Runcorn Old Town. The second dock is privately owned and is located further west. It can be accessed from Halton Road. Bridgewater Motor Boat Club is based in Runcorn and can give advice on moorings in the town.

Get around[edit]

By bus[edit]
When Runcorn New Town was built, a system of dedicated busways was constructed, completely separate from the road network. This makes getting around by bus fast and easy.
There are two main bus interchanges. One is in the Old Town near the railway station and the other at Shopping City.

By car[edit]
Getting around Runcorn by car is easy using the high-speed dual carriageway system which surrounds the town in a figure of 8. Each area of the town has its own junction. The network is so well designed that traffic congestion is unheard of.

By foot or bicycle[edit]
Runcorn is spread out but walking and cycling in Runcorn can be a real pleasure. Because Runcorn is a planned New Town, it was designed so that pedestrians and vehicles are kept totally separate.
The Bridgewater Canal forms a lovely walk from east to west. In fact, you can walk all the way from Runcorn railway station to Runcorn East station just following the canal towpath, though it is a fair distance. Town Park in the east forms a pedestrian link between all the communities in that area. It links to Runcorn Shopping City by raised walkways meaning you never have to cross a busy road.
Wigg Island is a popular cycle route. The route is not open to cars and you can cycle all the way to neighbouring Warrington following the Manchester Ship Canal. Many people cycle a loop starting from Wigg Island, to Warrington, across the River Mersey, follow the Mersey back along Spike Island in Widnes, cross the Silver Jubilee Bridge and back to Wigg Island.

There is a second memorial in Castle Road, Halton village, commemorating residents of the village who served in the Boer War. 
 Architecture. For those interested in town planning and modernist architecture, Runcorn is a treasure trove of buildings constructed in the late 1960s and 1970s. Runcorn Shopping City at the heart of the New Town was designed by Fred Roche CBE. At the time of its construction, it was the largest covered shopping centre in Europe. There are also several listed buildings in Runcorn of some importance, including All Saints Parish Church and Holy Trinity Church in the centre of the older part of the town, St Mary's in Halton village, St John's in Weston, and Christ Church in Weston Point. All Saints' Church, a Grade II* listed building, dates from 1849 and was built by Anthony Salvin in red sandstone. The oldest surviving houses are the Seneschal's House in Halton village (1598), Weston Old Hall (1607), Brookfield Farmhouse (1691) and Halton Old Hall (1693). Other outstanding houses include Runcorn Town Hall (formerly Halton Grange), Camden House and Cottage in High Street and Bridgewater House near the Ship Canal. 
Runcorn is often used as a filming location for TV programmes so you may recognise some settings such as the old Waterloo Pub - now a Buddhist temple - from Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps.

Stay safe[edit]
Runcorn is generally safe during the day. As in most town centres, the Old Town can attract drunken behaviour at night, particularly at weekends which sometimes leads to violence. Some areas have high levels of poverty and bad reputations for crime, including parts of Halton Lodge, Halton Brook, Palacefields and Murdishaw.
The local police force is Cheshire Constabulary and Runcorn Police Station is adjacent to the Shopping City. Call 101 for non-emergencies and 999 for emergencies.

Connect[edit]
As of Oct 2022, Runcorn and its approach roads have 4G from O2 and Three, and 5G from EE and Vodafone.
