The Galt Carnegie Library building still stands along the Grand River, but the library moved to larger facilities in 1969.
Cambridge is one of the cities that forms a tightly-integrated metro area, along with Kitchener and Waterloo, within the larger Region of Waterloo in Southwestern Ontario.


Understand[edit]
Cambridge was created in 1973 by the merger of four municipalities: Galt, Preston, Hespeler, and Blair. The four communities maintain their individual identities to a certain extent.
The former city of Galt covers the largest portion of Cambridge, making up the southern half of the city. The former town of Preston and village of Blair are on the western side of the city, while the former town Hespeler is in the most northeasterly section of Cambridge. There was considerable resistance among the local population to this "shotgun marriage" arranged by the provincial government and a healthy sense of rivalry had always governed relations among the three communities. Each unique centre has its own history that is well documented in the Cambridge City Archives.
As Cambridge has developed and the open spaces between the original municipalities have been filled in, a fourth commercial core, entirely modern in its construction, has emerged. The Macdonald-Cartier Freeway Highway 401 runs through its midst.

History[edit]
Galt: In the late 1700s, developers began to buy land around the Grand River from the Six Nations Indians. The land was divided and sold particularly to Scottish settlers. The planned community was named in honour of John Galt of the Canada Company which was developing this entire area. Primarily agricultural in early years, Galt had attracted industry by 1840, and was called "Manchester of Canada" because of the extensive industry, powered by the Grand River.  The railway reached Galt in 1879, increasing the opportunities of exporting local goods and importing others.
Preston: Preston was formed on land belonging to the German Company Tract, along the Speed River, which was purchased earlier from the Six Nations Indians. The name Preston is from the hometown of William Scollick, who was surveyor and a native of Preston, Lancashire in England. In the 1800s a group of German-speaking Mennonites from Pennsylvania arrived in the area and purchased land. The population continued to grow primarily because of immigration from Germany. By 1879 there were many industries such as a foundry, carriage manufacturer, potteries and a furniture company. This was also the year that the Cherry Flour Mills started, which would later become the Dover Flour Mills, a Preston company that still operates today.
Hespeler: The area was purchased in 1798 by Mennonites from Pennsylvania from the Six Nations Indians with the assistance of developer Richard Beasley. Settler Jacob Hespeler arrived in 1845 and bought a 145 acres (0.59 km²) tract on the Speed River. He built an industrial complex that was the beginning of Hespeler's future industrialization which would consist primarily of woollen and textile mills. The arrival of the railway in 1859 helped businesses to develop and prosper. Textile production mills were the primary industry in the early 1900s and continued to be successful until the late 1940s, when this industry began to decline.
Blair: The land was purchased from the Six Nations, and was settled in 1800 by  Mennonites from Pennsylvania. In 1846, a large flour mill called the Bowman Mill, Blair Mill and also the Carlisle Mill opened. In about 1876, a 15-horsepower hydroelectric system, the Sheave Tower, was built on Bowman Creek to help power the flour mill using a series of shafts and gears.  The village's honours Adam Johnston Fergusson-Blair, the first judge of Wellington District and a militia colonel in the area.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Highway 401, Ontario's main east-west highway, runs through Cambridge, and there are five exits in or adjacent to Cambridge:

Exit 275 (Fountain Street), west of Blair
Exit 278 (Shantz Hill Road), northwest of Preston
Exit 282 (Hespeler Road/former Highway 24), south of Hespeler and north of Galt
Exit 284 (Franklin Street), south of Hespeler
Exit 286 (Townline Road), southeast of Hespeler
If arriving from the southeast (Hamilton and beyond), take Highway 8, which becomes Dundas Street in Cambridge.
If arriving from the south (Brantford), take Highway 24, which becomes Water Street in Cambridge.

By intercity bus[edit]
There are three stops serving intercity buses for Cambridge:

43.411707-80.3240731 Cambridge Smartcentre, 44 Pinebush Rd (behind The Keg restaurant near a GRT bus stop). (updated Jul 2019)
 GO Transit. GO Transit provides bus service about once every two hours to Mississauga and Waterloo University. You must have a pre-purchased ticket, Presto card, or cash to buy a ticket from the driver (about $15 one way to Mississauga). Buses have bike racks that can accommodate two bicycles at a time. (updated Jul 2019)
43.3575-80.31332 Ainslie Street Transit Terminal, Ainslie St S, Galt, Cambridge. (updated Jan 2019)
 Grand River Transit (ION). Grand River Transit, the public transit authority in the Region of Waterloo, offers its ION light rail and bus service for those coming to Cambridge from Kitchener and Waterloo. First take an ION light rail train to ION Fairway station and from there transfer to an ION express bus (route 302) to Cambridge. The ION bus stops at the Cambridge Centre on Hespeler Road before terminating at the Ainslie Street Transit Terminal in Galt. (updated Jul 2019)
43.409987-80.392863 Kitchener Sportsworld, Sportworld Drive, Kitchener (south-west side of Highway 8 interchange). A number of GO Transit buses from Mississauga Square One stop at this location near the city limits between Kitchener and Cambridge before proceeding to Kitchener Railway Station and University of Waterloo Station. ION bus 302 running between ION Fairview Station (Kitchener) and the Ainslie Street Transit Terminal (Cambridge) also stops here. (updated Jul 2019)
By train[edit]
Cambridge does not have passenger rail service.  Nearby cities served by VIA Rail are Kitchener, Guelph, and Brantford. Kitchener Railway Station, near Downtown Kitchener, is probably the most convenient as it is near the ION light rail line which connects to the ION bus (route 302) to the Ainslie Street Transit Terminal in Cambridge.
