Get around[edit]
A car is a must in this sparse but spread out town, the main town centre is where most of the action is from 9-5 and busses are available but scarce and can be expensive. Some backpackers provide transport to and from town and also some can provide transport to farms where most backpackers go for work.

See[edit]
The town has a scenic lookout, on which a lot of the town can be seen. The Big Apple isn't really much to look at as it is dilapidated, the paint on it is peeling and traces of rust can be found on this not so big apple.
