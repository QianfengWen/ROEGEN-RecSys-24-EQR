İnegöl is a city in the Eastern Marmara region of Turkey, with a population in 2020 of 281,384. The cornerstone of İnegöl tourism is Oylat Thermal Springs. It also has many historical buildings.


Understand[edit]
The town used to be known as Ἀγγελόκωμις, Angelokomis, and it's possible that "İnegöl" is a mispronunciation of this. The Ottoman dynasty was founded nearby in Söğüt and in 1285 İnegöl was an early conquest. They went on to capture Bursa then Thrace, then made their move on Constantinople. The town is along a trade route from Anatolia and was embellished in the 15th century by the İshak Paşa mosque. In the 19th century it was a settlement area for those displaced from the Balkans as the Ottoman Empire crumbled. Over the centuries several invading armies also came this way, the last being the Greeks in the war of 1920-22.
İnegöl stands near forested hills: the timber finds multiple uses but here is especially made into furniture. It's the town's chief industry, and İnegöl is Turkey's main producer.
