Understand[edit]
Rue Principale
Granby is a regional centre for industries (textile, lumber, dairy products) and commercial zone, but is also a tourist town, due to the presence of the important Granby Zoo.
The town is named after John Manners, Marquess of Granby.

History[edit]
Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the area was inhabited sporadically by nomadic First Nations people.
In 1792, Loyalists fleeing the United States were granted permission to colonize the Eastern Townships. In 1803, the Executive Council of Quebec conceded the Township of Granby to Colonel Henry Caldwell and his 97 associates. John Horner, the first inhabitant who settled on the site of the current town arrived in 1813. Horner built a sawmill near the Yamaska River.
Field areas have been exploited for agricultural use and the North Yamaska river's flow has been used for its hydraulic energy since the construction of a first dam in 1815 by large industrial companies; the use of dams along the stream has provoked the formation of a large shallow swamp, called Lac Boivin, often cited as one of Granby's landmarks.
