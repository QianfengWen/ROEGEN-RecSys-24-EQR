Carvoeiro is a village in Algarve. Carvoeiro, or more commonly known as Praia de Carvoeiro (although this is no longer its formal name), is a Portuguese civil parish/freguesia in the municipality/concelho of Lagoa (Algarve), about 5 km south of the city (on the Atlantic Ocean). This picturesque fishing village, with a long history of settlement, has grown over the last decades into the main tourist area of the concelho. It has a number of fine beaches protected by clifts. 


Understand[edit]
It was created as a separate freguesia in 1985 and raised to the status of town on April 19, 2001. The village is 14.12 km2 (5.45 sq mi) in area with 2,700 inhabitants (2011). 
There are traces of Roman habitation and naval activity in the area. There has also been a long history of pirate and enemy military assaults on the coast, and a number of naval battles here, most notably the battle in 1544 between a squadron of ships under D. Petro da Cunha, and the Turkish corsair (barbary pirate), Xarramet.
According to historical sources, the name of the village derives from "Caboiere" an old name for a hamlet of fishermen from the Islamic-medieval period. For most of its history, fishing was the mainstay of the local economy.
Carvoeiro profited from the expansion of the preserving industry, like the surrounding freguesias, because it created many jobs and wealth at its prime.
However, from the 1960s onward, tourism gradually became the economic base of the area, with many new hotels, apartment complexes, shops, roads, and a significant improvement in the infrastructure.
Carvoeiro represents a particularly attractive option when it comes to tourism (beaches, golf and water sports). The scarped coast, the water quality, the warm climate and the famous golf courses, offer the right conditions to make Carvoeiro stand out, as a quality destination for Portuguese and foreign tourists.
Walking by the seaside while admiring the natural beauty and pieces of history (architectural heritage, an ancient fortress and the Shrine of Nossa Senhora da Conceição), that remained in this location, is great advice for those who like to relax and to contemplate the beauty of nature's work.
Its Patron Saint is Nossa Senhora da Encarnação (Our Lady of the Incarnation).

After leaving the airport, take the EN 125 and follow the indications towards the Via do Infante Highway (A22), following the Portimão direction.When you reach the exit of Lagoa Sul/Carvoeiro, take that exit which will take you back to the EN 125.

On the motorway route, a toll system has been implemented. It is not like those in France where you drop coins in at a pay station or use your credit card.

Car rental companies may forward the fine notice to you at your home address.

Carvoeiro has a number of bars which cater for most tastes. The Estrada do Farol is the main street in town and is quite a steep hill around 600 m long. Around halfway up is The Roundup, a wild west theme bar with a lot of cool Americana type artifacts and a good party atmosphere. There is often live music and karaoke, and by the time you've been there a week you'll know some of the local "characters" who make this an enjoyable night out.
A long-standing favourite nightspot is the Jailhouse Bar on the Rua do Escondidinho, a little side street 50 m from the town square which itself sits at the bottom of the hill. Run by a very friendly, sociable and talented English chap who also does live music every night till late. This bar is very popular with musicians as members of the audience are encouraged to get up on stage and do a song or two! Good place to chill out and meet other people.
Hemingway's nearby is a nice place for a quiet drink. Also check out Cheers Bar on Rua dos Pescadores in town. A small "living room" sized bar run by an amiable Swiss couple who are excellent company and mix amazing cocktails.
