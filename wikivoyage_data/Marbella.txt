Street in Old Town
Marbella is one of the Mediterranean's most representative tourist venues and a top favourite for travellers. What was once a small white village of fishermen is now one of the most cosmopolitan beach resorts on the Costa del Sol in Spain.


Understand[edit]
The beaches with its fine sand and the Mediterranean with its clean water are the main attractions of Marbella. A variety of activities, both on land and sea are available, as is shopping, eating and nightlife.
The city itself has a long history, being settled by the Phoenicians in the 7th century BC. Later on came the Romans and Moors, who have left traces in the city. The Moors called the city Marbil-la, probably derived from an earlier Iberian name. Much of the current old town dates from the 15th and 16th centuries, when Marbella had once again become part of Spain. Later on the city was a centre of iron mining industry.
Some of the first hotels were built in the 1920s, but the Spanish Civil War brought the development to a stop. After World War II, Marbella emerged as a popular destination for Europe's rich and famous. Soon the affluent beach suburb of Puerto Banús (handled in its own article) sprung up about 7 km west of Marbella. Eventually, the city also became a getaway for "royals" of organized crime and in their footsteps petty criminals and drug users, which in the early 1990s gave Marbella a bad reputation. Nowadays, however, the city is clean and safe and according to a 2008 study boasts the highest life quality in all of Andalusia. The city is also full of domestic and international visitors, most of them from the British Isles.

The climate type is Mediterranean, unsurprisingly. Marbella's location between the ocean in the south and the Sierra Blanca range in the north gives the city a pleasant microclimate. With about 320 sunshine days a year, it's no surprise that many telecommuters, retirees and other expats (especially from the northern half of Europe) have made Marbella and other destinations on Costa del Sol their second home. December and January have somewhat more rain than the rest of the year, though.

Tourist information[edit]
The tourist offices are at the Plaza de los Naranjos (in the corner of the city hall) and Paseo Maritímo.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Malaga Airport (AGP IATA), 45 km to the east, is the nearest major airport. It's the major airport of Costa del Sol and serviced by most European regular, budget and charter carriers. From there, your options are bus (one way €6.15 as of May 2015), taxi or rental car. If you're coming from the UK you can fly in to Gibraltar, although this entails a 1½-hour drive.

By car[edit]
The main coast road (N340, now known as the A7) connects the major towns along the whole southern coast and Marbella is approx 30 minutes drive along the N340 from the provincial capital, Malaga. If you are prepared to pay the toll fee (€4-6 depending upon season) you can take the new AP-7 road which runs parallel to the N340, but with less traffic and higher speed limits means you will reach your destination more quickly. Several parking houses are available both in Marbella and in Puerto Banus. It is also possible to hire a car from a variety of companies, such as Nizacars[dead link] or Marbesol.

By bus[edit]
Marbella's bus station. To the right a part of the mountain La Concha
36.5197-4.89241 [formerly dead link] Marbella's central bus station is right off the motorway (A-7 / E-15), right off exit 164. It's 1½ km to the old town and the beach, walkable in 15–20 minutes.
From Malaga Airport, buy a bus ticket from the vendor facing the exit of the arrivals hall. In May 2015 a one-way ticket costs either €6.15 or €8.30 depending on the comfort level of the bus. Buses to Marbella are operated by Avanzabus. The buses will arrive every hour or two on the road behind the vendor. Make sure to be there on time, since the bus leaves exactly on time, or even a minute before. Be aware that drivers don't sell tickets, you need to have bought one at the station or online. The buses are modern and air conditioned. Make sure to sit on the left side of the bus if you want to see the beautiful coastal view. When riding back to the airport you'll get a much better view sitting on the right. Without traffic (there really shouldn't be any, since the bus takes the toll road), the ride should take around 40 min.
Also, there are buses from all other major cities and towns along Costa del Sol, plus other larger cities in Andalusia. Although cheap, the buses can run to their own timetable (!) and are often very busy in summer.

By train[edit]
There is a train service between Fuengirola and Malaga, which is to be extended to run further down the coast to Marbella. Until then, you must take some other form of transportation the last part from Fuengirola. Malaga is reachable by the AVE rapid train from some other major cities in Spain such as Seville, Córdoba or Madrid.

By taxi[edit]
Marbella's own taxis are white with a blue strip
Taxis are available from Malaga Airport to Marbella outside the terminal. The cost of the  journey is around €68. The disabled can also pre-book a wheelchair accessible taxi or minivan online with Marbella Taxis for €65, if you are looking for a reliable and at the same time economical taxi company you can Pre-Book with Malaga Taxi Service[dead link], no waiting in long airport queues for your taxi or minibus transfer.

A transfer from Malaga Airport to Marbella] will quote €66.50 with Autosol. Holiday-Transfer will quote only €58. Bookingtaxi[dead link] charges €59 and up for transfers from Malaga Airport to any hotel in Marbella.

By boat[edit]
Marbella has two yacht harbors.

Get around[edit]
36°30′54″N 4°53′6″WMap of Marbella
By foot[edit]
Downtown is fairly compact and you can get around by foot fairly easily if you are moderately fit, just remember to drink water regularly if visiting in the summer when daytime temperatures above +30 °C are the rule rather than the exception. Also sidewalks are often very narrow.

By bus[edit]
The city operates a network of seven local bus lines. Here [dead link] is information concerning routes, schedules and fares. The Spanish version of the site has an additional route map for each line using Google Maps. Single tickets cost €1.18 when purchased from the driver.

By car[edit]
A car is probably an option if you want to go somewhere further out — west, east or inland. If you want to rent a car, all the major car hire firms are represented, but the best value will probably come from local firms. Small car for around €80-90 a week in off season.

If you like hiking, it's possible to hike up to the summit of La Concha — the 1215-m-high mountain that can be seen from everywhere in the city. The summit is about 6 km northwest of the old town as the crow flies, but the main hiking trails start from the northern side of the mountain. They are located near the villages of Ojén (longer trail) and Istan (shorter but steeper trail). The walk is not very difficult, though if you do it in summer you'll need sunscreen and plenty of water.
Events[edit]
Save for the winter, there are several festivities and processions going on each month in and around Marbella, most of them religious.

You will therefore have no trouble finding a restaurant and as elsewhere in touristed parts of the world the menus may be available in ten languages and restaurant staff are very eager to get passers by patronizing their restaurant! Also, your hotel is likely to have one or more restaurants, especially if the hotel is away from downtown.
Even as all major cuisines are represented on the Marbellan restaurant scene, most (also) offer Spanish and Andalusian dishes — especially paella in all thinkable varieties. Also, unlike lesser touristed parts of Spain, restaurants open for dinner already at 18:00, even with some special offers for early diners. Tapas are available all day.

Go next[edit]
Nearby[edit]
36.4636-5.00041 Guadalmina Beach, Marbella Málaga (12 km west of Marbella), ☏ +34 952 12 62 79. The beach has exceptional surroundings including the third-century AD Roman ruins known as Las Bóvedas in a protected archaeological site. This beach has been blueflagged since 1992. 
Puerto Banús - is the famous yacht marina, lined with popular bars and restaurants, and a veritable posers' paradise. Plenty of late night bars and the odd celebrity are to be found here, but don't forget your wallet, it's not cheap! Some 7 km west along the beach.
Head up to Refugio de Juanar near Ojen, about 5 km inland. You can hike in the woods and up to the summit of La Concha for great views over the region.
Day trips[edit]
For instance Gibraltar is doable as a daytrip
Other cities and towns on Costa del Sol can easily be visited as a daytrip by bus or rental car. In addition to sights and services you can expect from beach resorts, most also offer interesting architecture dating back to Roman times, museums and typical Andalusian landscapes. Also the picturesque inland town of Ronda can be worth considering.
If visiting during the winter months, Marbella is a good base to visit the famous Spanish Ski resort of Sierra Nevada, 1½ hours away by car
Gibraltar - visit the historical British colony, climb the famous rock and see the mischievous Barbary Apes. NB You will need your passport as the Spanish Guardia operate a full border control.
You can actually make a daytrip to Africa. Take an early bus to Algeciras, and one of the frequent fast ferries to Ceuta and head back in the afternoon. On the other hand, Morocco and back is probably not feasible in one day, as it will involve multiple changes of transportation and times at the borders. There are however companies offering day-length tours to Tangier for about €80 per person.
Further away[edit]
If you want to make a longer side trip and are interested in history, culture and architecture, why not head to Sotogrande, Córdoba, Seville or Granada, accessible by direct bus? Southwards you can explore more of Morocco.
