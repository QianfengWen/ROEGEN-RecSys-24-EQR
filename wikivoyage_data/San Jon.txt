San Jon is a tiny village of 300 people in Northeast New Mexico. Established in 1902 as a railroad town, it prospered during the heyday of Route 66 but became a semi-ghost town when 66 was bypassed by Interstate 40 in 1981.
The service stations and cafés which served US 66 are mostly gone, although one motel remains.
