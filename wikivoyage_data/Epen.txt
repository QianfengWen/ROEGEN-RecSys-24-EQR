Epen is a small town in South Limburg, the southern most region of the Netherlands. It's a picturesque little place that features some of the best landscape views in the country and is dotted with the timber framed houses that are so typical for this area.


Understand[edit]
Natural and agricultural landscapes around the village are the main attraction.
For long, Dutch, Belgian and German tourists have discovered the beautiful surroundings of this region and of Epen in particular. Although only some 740 locals live in the village itself today, or 1120 when the surrounding area is added to that number, there are plenty of options to stay, eat and drink.
Epen is part of the municipality of Gulpen-Wittem, with Gulpen and Wittem obviously being the primary towns. The Belgian border is at walking distance, allowing for lovely cross-border hikes to the Belgian villages on the other side. The river Geul passes through Epen, leaving zinc and other specific elements in the soils it touches. It is therefore that Zinkviooltjes, a rare kind of violets, and other rare, zinc-loving plants are found here.

History[edit]
In medieval times, the Epen territory belonged to the Carolingian kings. First written evidence of the settlement dates back to 1041, when it is mentioned in an akt of the Roman king Hendrik under the name "Apine". In 1056 Hendrik, then German Emperor, gives a number of goods in "villa Apensis" to the abbey of Burtscheid, to which they belong until 1794. Some believe that poverty, due to the many passing armies and the effects of war, are the reason why so many timber framed houses in the area remain.

 VVV tourist information office, Julianastraat 15, ☏ +31 900-555 9798. The tourist information office has a good range of maps and other information. They can also assist in finding a place to stay. 
Get in[edit]
There are basically three roads leading to the village, in the directions of nearby Vaals, Mechelen/Partij and Slenaken.
Coming from the N278 (e.g. from Maastricht), leave that road at Partij and follow signs for Mechelen and Epen. The way is also indicated from Vaals, Vijlen and Gulpen. It's generally a pleasant drive with nice vistas.
There's no train station in the direct surroundings, but bus line 57 connects Epen to Gulpen and Maastricht. Therefore, when arriving by train, your best option is to take an intercity train to Maastricht and catch the bus from there. The nearest airport is also Maastricht-Aachen Airport.
Cycling is highly popular in this area, and if the slopes are not an issue for you, cycling in is a nice way to pick up some of the great scenery on the way. Routes are plentiful, with cycling directions provided on almost all way pointers (look for the red bike). For hikers, several walking routes avoid roads and concentrate mostly on forest paths and the open fields.

Get around[edit]
To see the best of the town, you'll have to see the outskirts and the surrounding natural areas and hamlets. Hiking is a great way to enjoy some peace and quiet as well as good views, since you can take the many small walking paths around. However, prepare for a fairly long and at times tiring hike through the hilly area. The same goes for exploring Epen's surroundings on a normal bike. Alternatively, reserve an electric bike from Wingbergermolen, Terpoorterweg 4, +31 (0)43-4559110. A car is another good option, but you'll need to head to Valkenburg, Maastricht or Heerlen to rent one.

See[edit]
Timber framed houses are a common sight here, with many of them old and listed as monuments.

50.7731035.9204082 Eper Molen (Wingbergermolen), Terpoorterweg 4. This watermill along the river Geul was built in 1844, but renovations in the 20th century changed the looks of it.  
50.7695475.9196693 Volmolen, Plaatweg 1, Plaat. This 18th century watermill on a side stream of the Geul was originally build as a fulling mill. It is located in the hamlet of Plaat, near Epen. It was part of the then blooming cloth industry in Vaals. In the 1830s, after not being used for years, a German by the name of Johann Wilhelm Kannengiesser changed it into a wool spinning mill. After it was destroyed twice in fires, it was sold and changed into a grain mill. Following the Second World War, the mill became abandoned. In the 1970s, it was renovated and brought back into action as a grain mill, which it still is today.
