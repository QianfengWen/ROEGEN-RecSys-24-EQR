 Pildappa Rock, along Pildappa Road, 15 km from the neighbouring town of Minnipa. Pildappa Rock is a striking granite plug that forms several wave walls. It is popular with caravanners but you can go out just for a look and walk to the top for district views. Note that most of the road to the rock is dirt - half is in excellent condition, the other half is OK but keep your speed down. (updated Apr 2015)

The park is best accessed by high clearance vehicles and a permit is required for anyone wishing to visit the park. Permits can be obtained at self-service locations at Park entries or at the Gawler Ranges Visitor Information Outlet (Wudinna Telecentre) at 44 Eyre Highway. $10 day entry ($8 concession), camping $11 per night.
