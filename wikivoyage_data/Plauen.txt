Plauen is the biggest city of the Vogtland in the federal-state of Saxony (Freistaat Sachsen). It is famous for its lace industry.


Understand[edit]
Plauen was founded by Sorbs. It was a booming Germany city in the early 20th century because of its lace industry. At this time it was one of the biggest cities in Germany and was a home to a lot of rich people. World War I and World War II destroyed more than 75% of the city. Because of its proximity to the inner German border during the cold war it was a base to Russian soldiers. The first demonstrations against the communist government of East Germany, and divided Germany started here. Today it is home to around 66,000 people. It's the most important city in the "kreis" of Saxony.
