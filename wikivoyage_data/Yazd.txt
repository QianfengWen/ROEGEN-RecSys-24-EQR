Ashura is on the 10th day of Muharram with activities going on a couple of days before and after. A group of volunteers organizes 'spiritual tourism' to help tourists attend the events securely.

Activities vary from taking tourists to a candle lighting ceremony or to community lunch. A highlight is the main Ashura ceremony for what they organize buses to bring tourists to a mosque just outside the city where the biggest celebration is held. They provide lunch and are extremely careful to where they take you: You will get a fantastic and secure spot to observe the ceremony and you can ask one of the many English speaking volunteers to explain what you see.
