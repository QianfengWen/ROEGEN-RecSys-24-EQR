The small town of Biar, with its monumental Arabic castle, is one of the better-preserved medieval towns in Alicante (province) and in the Valencian Community.


Understand[edit]
The name is likely derived from the Arabic word بِئَار (bi'ar – 'well'). The town has been inhabited since prehistoric times, although the current town layout dates primarily from the Moorish period. After the Christian reconquista in the 13th century the town and castle became a border post along the frontier between the kingdoms of Castile and of Aragon and Valencia.
Today the town's economy is primarily based on the production of olive oil, with a secondary focus on tourism.

By car[edit]
The most convenient way to get to Biar is definitely by car.

By public transport[edit]
Getting in by public transport is possible, but requires some careful planning. To and from Villena Subus[dead link] runs one bus a day Monday through Friday. The bus departing Villena leaves at the very inconvenient time of 06:10, but there is a taxi stand just outside the Villena train station, and the ten minute journey by taxi from Villena to Biar will cost about €15. The return bus leaves Biar at approximately 15:45 and arrives at Villena 15 minutes later. A current bus schedule can be downloaded here.

Get around[edit]
It is easiest to get around by food, as Biar is very small.
