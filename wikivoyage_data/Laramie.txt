Laramie is located at very high altitude (7,200 ft/2,200 m) and due to this has considerably milder summers and more fierce winters than other US cities of comparable latitude in the upper Midwest. Because it lies east of the Continental Divide, placing it in the rain shadow of the Rockies, the climate around Laramie is very dry most of the year so travelers here should take care to drink lots of fluid and not overexert themselves immediately upon arrival to mitigate potential altitude sickness risks.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The primary access to Laramie is along Interstate 80, the main east–west corridor in the state; it's roughly an hour west of the junction with I-25 at Cheyenne.  Because of the altitude and northern location, it is important to be aware of road conditions and road closures along all roads but especially I-80 as its closure can strand you.  Road conditions are available on the internet at several sources including this one: [1]
In the summer months the town is also easily accessible on a smaller road (US 287) that comes up from Fort Collins, Colorado.  From Denver it makes for a shorter drive than I-25/I-80, but not noticeably faster.
