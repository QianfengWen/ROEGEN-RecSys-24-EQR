Oulu (Swedish: Uleåborg) is the biggest city in Northern Finland, with about 210,000 inhabitants (in 2021). Once known for wood tar and salmon, Oulu has become a major high-tech centre, particularly in IT and wellness technology. Oulu has been selected as the European Capital of Culture for 2026.
The adjacent town of Kempele and the former municipalities of Ylikiiminki,  Haukipudas, Kiiminki, Oulunsalo and Yli-Ii are also handled in this article.

Oulu is the capital of the province of Oulu and the region of Northern Ostrobothnia. It is the fifth largest municipality in Finland by population and the largest and most important in Northern Finland. As a result of two consolidations of neighbouring municipalities, first Ylikiiminki in 2009, and then Haukipudas, Kiiminki, Oulunsalo and Yli-Ii in 2013, its land area is over 3,000 km² (five to ten times the size of other similar sized cities in Finland). As urban area it comes fourth, after the capital region, Tampere and Turku.
A lot of Finnish IT companies, including Nokia, have offices in Oulu or nearby areas. In 1988 Jarkko Oikarinen wrote the first IRC server and client here. Oulu is also home to Oulun Kärpät, a successful hockey team playing in the top Finnish league, Liiga.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Until the end of the Stone Age, the current city was underwater, but around 1800 BCE, the post-glacial rebound had moved the coastline inside the current city borders. The Oulu river had already been an important trade river, as it offered connections to the east and the west, as well as to the south by the sea. During the Iron Age, the population in the Oulu area most likely lessened a bit, although the Sami population persisted through the Iron Age. During the Iron Age, the southern Finnish peoples such as the Finns Proper and the Tavastians made hunting, trade and taxation journeys to the north.
In the 12th century, Oulu became an important spot for trade and hunting trips by the Karelians, including the people from the flourishing population centres of the shores of the Lake Ladoga.

From the Middle Ages to the 16th century[edit]
The Observatory, built over the castle ruins
It is commonly interpreted that the Treaty of Nöteborg in 1323 placed Oulu inside the Republic of Novgorod, but according to some historians, Ostrobothnia was shared as a collaborative area between the two nations, Sweden and Novgorod. However, in the year 1345 Sweden annexed the regions all the way to Kemi as a part of Turku Diocese. The possession of the area became controversial, and  during the next centuries the Novgorodians and later the Russians made raids to Ostrobothnia all the way to Oulu. The first armaments of the Oulu Castle were made in 1375. The fortification was known in Swedish as "Uleåborg", "Ule River Castle". After the founding of the castle, the city started to slowly evolve close to the castle, which was colloquially known as "Uleåstad", "Ule River Town".
Oulu, Kemi, Tornio and Ii were given the right to serve as trading centres by the Swedish King Gustav Vasa of Sweden in 1531.
During the Russo-Swedish war of 1590–1595, the fortification was turned into a small castle. In the Treaty of Teusina (1595), Russia acknowledged the Oulu area as a part of the Kingdom of Sweden.

The founding of the city and the 18th century[edit]
Oulu market square granaries
Oulu is the oldest city in Northern Finland. It was founded with the Swedish name of Uleåborg in 1605 by the King Karl IX at the mouth of Oulujoki river, on the opposite bank of Oulu Castle. In the beginning there were around 400 residents in the city. The city got its full city rights in 1610, and during the 17th century even some small-scale industry was born in town; the only rifle manufacturing plant in Finland was in Oulu. The first pedagogium in the city was founded in 1611 and in 1682 it was transformed into a trivial school.
The Oulu Castle was destroyed by a lightning strike in 1793 and never rebuilt.

The 19th and the 20th century[edit]
The newly built Oulu lyceum in 1908
During its history, the city has suffered eight great fires; after the 1822 one, the city centre got the look it still has today.
In the 19th century the trivial school was transformed into an upper comprehensive school and a gymnasium school was attached to it. In 1872 the first Oulu private lyceum was opened and it was transformed into the Oulu Lyceum in 1883.
The city was greatly affected by wars, and Oulu was a battlefield for the Whites and the Reds in the civil war of 1918. The Winter War was seen in the city when the Germans built different training, maintenance and cadre centres in Oulu. In the Continuation war, Oulu was bombed heavily and some traces from the bombings are still seen in some of the older buildings in the city centre.
The 20th century brought industrialisation to the city and the borders became too tight for all population and the city borders were expanded by adding some smaller neighbouring municipalities to the city.
The University of Oulu was founded in 1959, although Oulu had been proposed as a university town since 1917. The new university got a great reception, since it was the first one in Northern Finland and the people didn't have to go all the way to southern Finland in order to get academic education.

Recent history and modern day[edit]
Nowadays Oulu is known especially as a technology city and the economical engine of Northern Finland. Technopolis, founded in 1982, was the first so-called technology village of the Nordic countries.
The latest municipality mergers alongside population growth of the city proper have made Oulu the 5th biggest city and 4th biggest urban area in Finland. It is by far the biggest city in the northern part of the Nordic countries.
Modern Oulu is known all over Finland with the nickname "Paska kaupunni" ("Shitty City") due to a graffiti made at some point in the 1980s to a wall in the address Uusikatu 22. The urban tradition of drawing the graffiti again and again has persisted to this day.
Other well-known things related to the city are the Toripolliisi statue (1987), the Oulu Market Hall (1901), the Marketplace granaries, the hockey team Oulun Kärpät, Tietomaa Science Centre, the annual Air Guitar World Championships, the Starboy tradition, the Oulu dialect and Rössypottu.
Oulu is also one of Finland's "cycling capitals" with over 20% of residents cycling daily – the cold weather notwithstanding. In fact, due to the prioritising of clearing snow from the main bicycle network, even at temperatures below -20°C you will see many people out and about on their bikes.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
64.92916725.3555561 Oulu Airport (OUL  IATA). The airport is 15 km south-west of the city. It has six Finnair flights a day from Helsinki Airport. In summer there are also flights from Mediterranean holiday resorts. That is about all, although the airport website (nothing if not aspirational) list 50 airlines flying here including from Tibet. There is only one terminal, open whenever there are flights. There are several device charging points and free Wi-Fi. There is also a piano and rocking chairs in the free Hailuoto Lounge. Oluthuone Toppila in the gate area stock beer, cider, soft drinks and the local "kärkkäri" sausage, as well as hamburgers and other food. Oulu Café (both airside and in Arrivals) has snacks and souvenirs. There is also a pharmacy by the café in the gate area.   (updated Jun 2019)
Transport: Bus routes 8 (to Teknologiakylä) and 9 (to Heikinharju) run between the airport and central Oulu, taking 30 min. The bus stop is to the right as you exit the terminal. There are usually two buses an hour M–Sa 06:25–21:00, otherwise hourly to 01:20.
The airport is in Fare Zone B, and the centre is Zone A, so you need a ticket for Zone AB. Adult fare is €5.80 (cash to the driver or use the transport app) but double after 23:00 – see "Get around" below for practicalities. The ticket is valid for transfers for 60 min. However the airport hotel and the southern municipality of Kempele are in Zone B, so for those, tell the driver and pay for that Zone only.
The main city stop for the lines 8 and 9 is Kaupungintalo. The bus doesn't stop on the Pekuri stop in the city centre at all. The university is on bus route 8, else change in the centre to buses 1 (Jylkynkangas), 2 (Ritaharju), 3 (Aaltokangas), 5 (Kaijonharju), 18 (Kaijonharju) or 23 (Haukipudas-Ii): tell the driver "Yliopistolle" (ILL-yo-piss-toll-e) meaning "to the university". You can also take the bus 48 or 52 from other bus stops. 
Taxis might cost €35; Otaxi is the main airport operator.
Car rental: all the main car rental firms are found at the airport. Book in advance as they have small fleets here, and their kiosks may have limited staffed hours.

By train[edit]
Oulu station building
Oulu is on the main railway line between Helsinki and the far north of Finland. Day trains by VR run from Helsinki to Oulu every hour or two via Tampere, taking 6 hours; they continue north to Kemi and either Rovaniemi (all year) or Tornio and Kolari (some trains in season). There are also sleeper trains (which take cars from some stations) on the Helsinki–Oulu–far north routes. See Finland#Get around: By train. The cost from Helsinki can be as low as €27 (less than €20 for students with a VR-approved student card) if bought well in advance.
65.01142225.483982 Oulu railway station, Rautatienkatu 11 A (1 km east of the market square). 07:00–21:00. Café-kiosk, news stand and luggage lockers. Ticket sail by machine only. Toilets charge €1. For city buses and taxis, exit west towards the water front, to reach Raksila district or for out-of-town buses, walk through the tunnel to exit east by the bus station.   

By bus[edit]
Trip duration from Helsinki varies between 8 and 15 hours and costs around €25–50, cheapest Onnibus fares €15. Direct bus connections are available also from Turku, Jyväskylä, Lahti, Kuopio, Pori, Joensuu, Vaasa and Rovaniemi. Coming via Tallinn or Stockholm, there may be coach connections from the port with arranged transfer, mostly via Kamppi.
From Sweden you can take a coach to Haparanda, walk across the border, and continue from Tornio. From Northern Norway, you usually need to transfer in Rovaniemi; in summer there may be a direct coach service between Tromsø and Oulu by Eskelisen Lapin Linjat. See Matkahuolto.
The bus station is across the tracks from the railway station.

By boat[edit]
There is no ferry, but for arriving with your own boat, Oulu has four marinas dotted around the estuary of the Oulujoki river. The main one is right next to the marketplace.

By car[edit]
Oulu is on Highway 4, which runs the length of the country from Helsinki via Jyväskylä to Oulu, continuing north to Kemi, Rovaniemi and Utsjoki on the border with Norway. The highway is part of E75 between Northern Norway and Athens.
Route E8 runs along the coast from Turku through Rauma, Pori, Vaasa and Kokkola to Oulu, continuing north as E75 to Kemi then as E8 to Kolari and eventually Tromsø.

Kivisydän, Hallituskatu 1 Entrance
City parking: Kivisydän underground car park stretches the length of the centre. There are two entrances: Hallituskatu 1, a block north of the market place off Rantakatu, search map for "Kivisydän Torin Ramppi". Hallituskatu 20 is at the junction of Hallituskatu and Uusikatu, search for "Kivisydän Uusikadun Ramppi."
Park & ride: use the free parking lot of Prisma Limingantulli (Nuottasaarentie 1) and take Citybus line C to the city centre. It runs every 30 minutes and costs €1.50 each way, cash and mobile ticket only. The Citybus stop is on the northern side of the hypermarket.
When coming from the north, you can also park at Ideapark Oulu mall (Ritaharjuntie 49) and take Bus 3 to the centre, though this is unlikely to save you any money (unless you travel alone) since you will have to pay the normal bus fare.

By foot[edit]
For being the fifth largest city in Finland the city centre is small compared to, say, Tampere or Turku. The whole of the city centre is easily walkable, and the walking conditions are good. There are usually free walking route maps distributed at the Tourist Information.

By scooter[edit]

For 2024, the only e-scooter company in town is Ryde.

By bus[edit]
An Oulu public transport bus in Toppilansaari
The public transportation is operated by OSL (Oulu Regional Transport). Single ticket (kertalippu) within about 10 km from the city centre costs €3.30 (€1.70 for children ages 7-16). Between 23:00–04:30 a single ticket costs €6.60, but night services are limited. The bus drivers usually understand some English, but best plan your trip beforehand. To plan your route in the city, use Google Maps' public transport features. It gives you the most convenient route to where you want to go, including walks to/from bus stops, which bus lines to use and where to switch buses. You can also use Oulu's own journey planner, Oulun liikenne, but it's not as good. Few third-party phone apps like Nysse do the job better. The buses have trackers which let the customers see where the bus is on a map and how long you have to wait for it. There are screens on bus stops that use this technology, but the previously mentioned Nysse also takes advantage of this feature (granted you have an internet connection, of course).
You can use the app Oulu Public Transport by iQ Payments or Waltti Mobile by LMJ to purchase the ticket. After purchasing the ticket from the app, show it to the driver and you're good to go. You cannot buy tickets in advance with the app, so you must buy it right before you need it.
There are day tickets available, you can buy them from the tourist information or Oulu10. You can also buy a day ticket for one day from the Waltti Mobile app or 1, 2 or 7 day tickets for zone a from Nallikari Holiday Village. 
Using the bus is simple. If you pay with cash, you just tell your destination to the driver (and if you're young, you should tell if you're under 16 or not; the bus drivers will almost automatically take you as an adult). 
If you pay with a Waltti-card (more info in the section With Waltti Travel Card), you just press the card against the reader (a machine with a blue ring on it). If you want to load more money (or "value") on the card, you just give the driver the money and ask to load the card with it ("lataa arvoa"). The loading of value in the buses costs €2 whereas you can load it freely in select R-Kiosks or ticket machines in, for example, Oulu10 (Torikatu 10, but temporarily located in Saaristonkatu 8), Shopping centre Valkea, OYS (the University Hospital), the University and the Airport.
You can also use NFC payment with Visa, Mastercard or Eurocard (Diners Club and American Express do not work) or a mobile device with Apple Pay, Pivo or Google Pay: the payment card or mobile device is displayed to the reader device, which then says "Lähimaksu hyväksytty" ("Proximity payment accepted"). The system calculates the fare combining all trips paid with the card/device: a new single ticket fee will not be charged until the 90-minute changeover period has ended, and a day ticket will be substituted when those are relevant.
Most buses display the information on the upcoming stops, as of May 2021, but it is still good to have a downloaded map with your current location on your phone. The displays are slow, so check the name of the previous stop to yours and press the stop button after that. 
Taking a bike to the bus costs €2/trip, and if the bus is full, you might have to wait for the next one. You can take your bike on some taller long-distance buses (e.g. to Tyrnävä) which have narrow hallways, elevated floors and single middle doors (as opposed to doubles), too, but you need to ask the driver to put the bike in the luggage container of the bus. Taking a folding bike on the bus is free (if the bike is folded, that is) but some bus drivers don't know that (since folding bikes quite rare). 
The validity of single and value tickets is 60 minutes when travelling in one zone or two zones, and 80 minutes in three or more zones. You can transfer from one vehicle to another within the validity of your ticket. A-City ticket is valid only in citybus. The validity of A-City ticket is 30 minutes.
OSL has decided on simplifying the transport system by abolishing the current the zone system. This change will come into effect in the end of 2024. Until then the fare (using app or card) is €1.20/1.10 for the centre by minibus, €2.05/1.10 for single zones, €4.05/2.10 for adjacent zones, $6.25/3.15 for three zones, and €8.20/4.15 for centre–zone D. The fare for adults when paying by cash or buying a single ticket from a vending machine or R kiosk is €1.50/3.30/5.80/8.30/10.10.
In the future, the price of a ticket will be the same no matter the destination. The price of the ticket will be €2,5 for adults, €1,25 for children. This means that the price of airport transportation will become lower, while the price of the current zone A will be a bit higher.
The bus stops are named so that the name of the stop is followed by either an E or a P. The letters stand for Etelä (South) and Pohjoinen (North), implicating the direction of the buses passing through the stop.
Be careful when using the bus in the city centre, since not all buses stop in all bus stops. When using the stops Pekuri and Kaupungintalo, remember that the lines 1-17 stop at Kaupungintalo, whereas lines 20-57 stop at Pekuri. City bus lines (A, B, C) stop at Kaupungintalo E. If unsure, check if the number of the line is found on the sign on top of the bus stop.
Some bus lines include:

2 Ritaharju–University–Tuira–City centre–Raksila–OYS–Kaukovainio–Kaakkuri–Metsokangas
The most popular bus line in town, hence one of the most operated one. Departure times vary, but during daytime on weekdays it departs every 10–20min. It takes you through the university, the city hospital (OYS) and the infamous (yet nowadays quite peaceful) Kaukovainio into the neighborhood of Metsokangas, which is full of newer, wood/brick residential buildings. Also passes through Kaakkuri shopping hub which holds the Verkkokauppa.com electronics store mentioned in this article.
8 Technology village–University–Tuira–City centre–Raksila–Oulunsalo–Airport

20 Haukipudas–Toppila–Tuira–City centre–Raksila–OYS–Oulu vocational college
One of the most popular bus lines. It starts from the suburb of Haukipudas, which used to be a town of its own but which is part of the city nowadays. It also passes through the somewhat sketchy Toppila suburb and terminates in OSAO, the main unit of Oulu vocational college, which has a cheap cafe and a store full of student-made food and delicacies.
21 Kiviniemi–Herukka–Pateniemi–Rajakylä–Toppila–Tuira–City centre–Limingantulli–Karjasilta–Kaukovainio

23 Ii–Haukipudas–Linnanmaa–Tuira–City centre–Raksila–OYS–Oulu vocational college
This line takes you to the municipality of Ii, which has a small, but beautiful old town. It also passes through the hospital and terminates in OSAO, the vocational college.
35 Kiiminki–Jääli–Tuira<City centre–Oulu vocational college
A quite popular bus line, which starts from the neighbourhood of Kiiminki, which is similar to Haukipudas since it also was a town of its own in the past.
40/41 City centre–Tuira–Hintta⨪Myllyoja–Saarela–Sanginsuu–Päivärinne–Muhos
The line takes you to the town of Muhos, which is the hometown of the first ever Miss Universum. It also passes closest to the Turkansaari Outdoor museum.
50 City centre–Heinäpää–Limingantulli–Kempele–Zeppelin–Haapamaa
The main bus line to Kempele takes you to Limingantulli, Kempele and the shopping centre Zeppelin.
51 City centre–Raksila–Kaakkuri–Metsokangas–Honkanen–Zeppelin–Kempele
A longer, but more interesting line to Kempele than 50. You see more of new, wooden residential buildings as well as brick ones. Also passes through Kaakkuri shopping hub and Metsokangas, similarly to number 2.

52(/52A) City centre–Heinäpää–Kempele–Tupos–Liminka(–Liminganlahti–Lumijoki)
This line operates to Liminka, which is the home of Liminganlahti, an important bird-watching area. Liminganlahti is only reached by the bus 52A or 53 though. Liminka is also a nice place to visit with historic buildings and points of interest.
54 City centre–Raksila–Tyrnävä–Liminka
This line takes you to Liminka through the rural municipality of Tyrnävä, known for its potatoes. If you want to see real countryside, be sure to take this line.
59 Bus station–Heinäpää–Oulunsalo–Hailuoto
The longest public transport bus trip in the Oulu area is the bus number 59 which takes you to Hailuoto, the biggest island in the Bothnian Bay. The municipality has about a 1000 residents making it the smallest in Northern Ostrobothnia. It is suggested to take the bus in to the very end of the line to Marjaniemi, since there are the most important sights in Hailuoto. Remember to check the schedules though, the bus doesn't operate too often.
A City centre–Train station–Myllytulli–Värttö
The citybus line takes you to Värttö, next to the quite pretty and old Oulu psychiatric hospital area. You can walk in the area freely, but cannot enter the buildings. It passes through Myllytulli (near the science cent Tietomaa) and next to the Oulu prison. The trip costs €1.50.

Public transport system Oulun joukkoliikenne is divided into zones from A to D that radiate from the centre. The urban area within about 10-km radius from the city centre is zone A and the regions further from that are B, C and D. Nearly all the hotels, University of Oulu and the main sights are in zone A. The airport, Kempele and Haukipudas are in zone B, Ii, Muhos, and Liminka are on zone C. Only Yli-Ii and Hailuoto are in zone D. The number of zones you travel through during your trip will determine your fare. A detailed map of the zones is found here (PDF)[dead link].

Potnapekka
To get a good look around Oulu, with English commentary, try Potnapekka[dead link] (in Finnish). Half train, half bus, it operates during summer months (June to August) on two routes, via Nallikari or Hupisaaret, through roads for light traffic. Both routes leave from the city hall (at the centre of Oulu) and the journey lasts about one hour. You can hop off and in on the way.
The bus starts from the city hall, and there is a ticket booth where you can buy tickets and get free route maps there. Single tickets cost €8/adult and €4/child from 5 to 14. Children under 5 travel for free. Family ticket is €20. Day tickets cost €15/adult and €8/child from 5 to 14. Family ticket is €50.

By bike[edit]
This "Amsterdam of Finland" is well renowned for its good bicycle routes, which get you around the city easily and safely even through the cold winter. To rent a bicycle, try Pyörä-Suvala, Lekatie 27. If you're staying at Nallikari Camping, Leiritie 10, they also have bikes to rent for visitors, costing €12/day. Bike paths are cleared of snow in the winter and you usually won't have to have studded tires because the ground is rarely icy or slippery.
When biking, be sure to use the special bike lanes (usually marked with red). You can take the bike through the shopping centre Valkea, but you have to walk the bike. Take care when cycling through Rotuaari pedestrian street, you're required to give way to pedestrians when cycling. There are even experiments with projecting the bike lane signs directly onto the surface — very helpful in winter — but as of early 2021 it's only a trial in one location.
Oulu also has had an extensive bikesharing system, which opened in August 2019. It had 60 stations with 10 bikes each, and the cost was €5/day, €10/week and €20/season. After paying the fee, you were able to bike around for free for 30 minutes, after which it cost €1/hour. The hourly fee could be avoided by returning the bike in 30 minutes to the station and taking a new one immediately. You needed a debit or credit card in order to rent the bikes.
The system was taken down, at least for now, because there were problems with the operator. They're planning on bringing the bikes back, but it is unsure when it will happen. 
More information in the webpage[dead link].

By train[edit]
You're unlikely to use the train within the city area. However you can ride between Kempele and Oulu on the long distance VR Helsinki-Oulu-Kemi trains, and between Oulu and Muhos on the trains to Kuopio, fares for both routes about €5.
In the summer there are some steam-hauled trains between Kempele, Oulu and Haukipudas, mainly used as an attraction.

65.0137725.464091 Market Square (Kauppatori) is a hotch-potch of styles: old red granaries, renaissance revival architecture and 1970s brutalist concrete. But during the brief warmth of summer, its terraces, cafes and market booths are busy and lively, though the main market hall is closed in 2019 for re-building. The area is presided over by Toripolliisi, the often photographed statue of the Market Square Policeman. He's a squat stubby young-old figure, as if weighted down by his responsibilities.
65.01925.48252 Oulu Museum of Art (Oulun Taidemuseo), Kasarmintie 7 (500 m north of centre), ☏ +358 44-703-7471. Tu-Su 10:00-17:00. Two-storey museum with a wide variety of modern artwork.

65.018525.48563 Tietomaa Science Centre (Tiedekeskus Tietomaa), Nahkatehtaankatu 2 (500 m north of centre, near the Art Museum). M-F 10:00–17:00, Sa Su 10:00-18:00. The oldest science museum in the country, mostly kinematic and interactive, great for pre-teens but plenty for adults to enjoy. It is partially located in the former Åström leather factory, and you can ride the glass lift up the 19th-century brick water tower. Adult €15, child (6-15) €11. (updated Jul 2019)
65.017325.46784 Oulu Castle (Oulun linna). Cafe daily May & Sept 11:00-19:00, June & late Aug 11:00-20:00, July & early Aug 11:00-21:00 21:00. The castle was damaged by attack in the 18th century and finally blown to pieces in 1793 when lightning struck the gunpowder magazine. What you see now is the maritime observatory built on the ruins; it's set in a pleasant park, and you can climb the tower for views. There's a café (Tähtitornin kahvila) within. The cellar (same hours) displays info on the castle - mostly in Finnish, but there's more in the Northern Ostrobothnia Museum. Free. (updated Jun 2019)

64.96342125.5030196 Oulu Automobile Museum (Oulun Automuseo), Automuseontie 1 (next to national road 847, 5 km south of the city centre;  Buses 9, 50, 52, 59 take you there.), ☏ +358 8 552-1600. M-Sa 09:00-17:00, Su 09:00-15:00 (summer, closed on Sundays in the winter). A car museum with 40 cars and 20 motorcycles and some traffic related paraphernalia on display. A couple of really interesting vehicles like the largest car ever built in the Nordic countries (a truck for a dam company), the remains of a Ford "killed in action" during World War II and a "motorcycle" where the rider sits inside a large wheel. The car museum also has a restaurant open for lunch. Adults €7, children €5. 
65.019625.47987 Hupisaaret park, Fountains and salmon stairs (Hupisaaret, kalatie) (a short walk from the city centre). 24 hr. The beautiful park of Hupisaaret (lit. Fun Islands) is a lush area with little paths and bridges crossing beautiful little streams.

Adults €6, students and seniors €4, children under 18 for free. A version of the Paska kaupunni graffitiMörkökivi (The Groke Stone)
65.01270125.476659 Paska Kaupunni graffiti (Paska Kaupunki), Uusikatu 22 (on a wall right next to the K-Market). 24/7. This iconic graffiti (or at least the nickname which Oulu got from it) is known all around Finland. The term "Paska kaupunki" literally means "Shitty city", and it was adopted from the song with the same name by Kauko Röyhkä. The graffiti appeared on the wall at some point in the 1980s, and after this, the graffiti has been removed numerous times but it has always reappeared on the same spot. The condominium owning the wall has even thought of framing the graffiti or protecting it in other ways since it has become one of the symbols of Oulu. As implied before, this isn't a site funded or even initiated by any official or commercial agent, so the presence of it can't be assured. Although, the drawing or painting of it has become an urban tradition, and if removed, it is almost certainly always remade in some form after a few days from its removal.  
Madetojan & Pokkisenpuisto are the little parks along the stream just north of the centre, divided by Aleksanterinkatu. The statue is of Leevi Madetoja (1887-1947), an Oulu-born composer who ranks alongside Sibelius.
65.0165325.4861110 Kruununmakasiini (a short walk from Tietomaa). In Sweden (to which Finland belonged from the 1300s to 1809), a "Kronomagasin" was a state-administered warehouse in which grain and other foodstuffs collected as tax were stored. Unfortunately, one can't go inside the warehouse any more since today it functions as an office for an architecture company. It is worth checking out from the outside though, the old wooden building sticks out amusingly from the 1980s apartment buildings and offers a reminder of the historical aspects of the city. (updated Feb 2018)
65.0105425.4599111 Oulun Suomalaisen Yhteiskoulun Lukio (OSYK), Maunonkatu 1 (a short walk from the market square). The Finnish Co-educational Lycée of Oulu was established and opened in 1902 as a private Finnish-language lycée. It was the first co-educational upper secondary school in Oulu, a progressive learning institution at the time since both boys and girls studied in the same school. The students of today keep up the progressive spirit in the school with a wide distribution of information on gender and sexual neutrality and diversity. The school is said to have the best team spirit in Oulu. Nowadays the school also is one of the most appreciated upper secondary school in the city and it emphasizes wide-scale art education. As pretty as it is from the inside, not entering the building without a reason is appreciated since it is reserved for students doing their schoolwork. You can admire the building from the outside. The school building was finished in 1908, and the Jugend style building is a rare find in town. As well as many other buildings in Oulu, the school is said to be haunted. There is also a quarter of pretty wooden buildings and a big park with a children's traffic playground near the school.   (updated Oct 2018)
65.0172925.4581112 Sailor's Home Museum (Merimiehenkotimuseo), Pikisaarentie 6, ☏ +358 50-316-6897. The Sailor’s Home Museum is on the idyllic island of Pikisaari near downtown Oulu. The museum is in the oldest surviving wooden building in Oulu, also known as Matila House, and is the former home of sailor Isak Matilainen. (updated Feb 2018)
64.99916725.45147413 The Groke Stone (Mörkökivi) (In Heinäpää near the bowling hall. A couple of kilometers by walking from the city centre, if you want to lessen the amount you need to walk, take any bus that goes from the bus stop "Virastotalo" to the stop "Harjapuisto E" or then alternatively the Citybus C to "Limingantulli" (a bit longer route). You can drive to the end of Isokatu, there are a lot of free parking there.). 24 hr. The urban artwork "Mörkökivi" is known amongst the locals, but not so much advertised to travellers. The reason probably is that it is not an official artwork, the artist is unknown, and, to be fair, it is just a simple stone with some paint on it. Yet it is a sympathetic little artwork, even said to be "The pole of Oulu" (figuratively) by some. It depicts a Moomin character "The Groke" and is on the top of the bigger-than-average-sized hill (for the flat terrain of the seaside city of Oulu, that is). Definitely not the most touristic attraction (or actually virtually unknown), but still liked by most locals. Best to use an appropriate map to find a route!  
65.0251825.4828314 The Blue House (Sininen talo), Valtatie 42 (on the other side of the river, accessible by walking the 2-km trip to Tuira; you can also take the buses 11, 17, 35, 36, and 40 to Kalliola P). The Blue House is the former home of the Finnish teacher, ethnographer and writer Samuli Paulaharju. Paulaharju lived there from his birth in 1919 until his death in 1944. The year of construction of the house is unknown, but the log structure of the house is probably from the end of the 19th century, and the house is said to be haunted. The building sticks out from the newer, blocky apartment buildings well. Again, not the biggest attraction for tourists, but if you have some extra time and are interested in history, be sure to check out the building. The house is still lived in, so do not enter the yard or the house. (updated Jan 2019)
 Old and new Oulu. The historic northern part of the city centre offers architecture from the 19th century, by architects like Carl Ludvig Engel and Johan Jacob Ahrenberg. In order to see chraming, old wooden buildings, head out to the neighbourhoods of Raksila and Pikisaari.

The buildings there are built right next to each other, creating small alleyways between the houses.For newer architecture, the neighborhood of Toppilansaari is a go-to destination. It is under construction, so expect to see cranes at work. The same goes for the newer part of the Hiukkavaara neighborhood. (updated Mar 2019)
64.94825.706815 Turkansaari Open Air Museum, Turkansaarentie 165 (the nearest bus stop is 1.5 km away, and buses 41, 41A and 49 take you there; you have to take the bus 40 back to Oulu; easier accessed by car, go toward Kajaani and turn from Turkansaari sign), ☏ +358 44-703-7191. 10:00-18:00.

65.01133125.4730894 Shopping Centre Valkea (Kauppakeskus Valkea) (150–200 m from the Tourist Info). A shopping centre in the heart of Oulu that opened in 2016. It offers a warm, covered street "Kesäkatu" (which is part of a public street in Oulu), and a number of shops and cafes on both sides of it. This is the place for most young people to hang out in town. Usually safe, but has gained a bit of a bad reputation due to the cases of harassment of young girls and drug sales on the "summer street". Nonetheless, the presence of security guards and youth workers has been increased when these defects have been surfaced, and the shopping centre is a safe place to visit. (updated May 2021)
64.9967525.460725 Power Limingantulli, Nuottasaarentie 4 (Citybus line C or 3, 9, 50, 52, 53 or 59), ☏ +358 30-50305. A competitor of Verkkokauppa.com, but closer to the city centre. (updated Feb 2018)

The Raksila markets (or more officially the Raksila Mall) are the place to go if you need something from the store for a cheap price. The markets are big, but the cheapest option if you're on a budget. They are found close to the ice hockey rink of Oulu and the city centre. The buildings are definitely a contemporary ensemble from the 1970s, but function well and do their job. The markets are going to be renewed completely by 2021, and they will build brand new ones on the spot of the current-day parking lot. (updated Nov 2018)
Due to the limited opening hour culture in Finland, most places in Oulu will close a bit too early for the taste of a foreign visitor. If you are in desperate need of something from the grocery store late at night (which means after 21:00 for Finns) or early morning, the options are narrowed down to some gas station stores like Shell HelmiSimpukka and Neste K (which tend to be outside the city centre, usually open until 24:00) and the grocery store Sale Raksila (open until 24). Three shops (S-Market Kaakkuri, Kastelli and Tuira) have been open 24/7. If you need to get somewhere warm in the middle of the night in the winter, other places that are open 24/7 are the McDonald's at Rotuaari and the "summer street" of the shopping centre Valkea (yet no shops there are open in the night). The railway station building is open 04:00-01:20

Stay safe[edit]
Oulu is, on the whole, a very safe city, but avoid getting into arguments late in the night in fast food joints. Pickpocketing is remarkably rare, but it doesn't harm you to keep an eye on your belongings just like in any other place.
Even though crime, especially towards foreigners, otherwise is rare, Oulu has experienced a lot of bike thefts, so make sure to keep your bike locked when you go shopping etc.
There can be some drunks in Rotuaari, the "summer street" of Valkea, the Mannerheim park and some other places in the city centre, but they shouldn't cause any harm to travellers.
The police are helpful and friendly, although some might lack English skills. If you have non-emergency cases or questions, you can contact the police department of Oulu at ☏ +358 29-546-0211. The central police office is at Kirkkokatu 13.

Medical help[edit]
OYS
In case of emergency, contact the emergency number ☏ 112.
For non-emergency but urgent cases, contact the number ☏ 116117 (OYS emergency centre) for a free evaluation of the situation.
If you are unsure about calling the emergency number 112, it's always better to call than not to call.
The emergency centre is not a health centre, but a place where urgent and severe cases are handled. For smaller, non-urgent cases, call ☏ +358 8 5584-4333.
There are also private health centres, where you can get an appointment faster. These include Terveystalo, Mehiläinen and Pihlajalinna, all of which have multiple locations in Oulu, including in the city centre.

The tourist information centre has a computer with free internet access.
Usually, there is free Wi-Fi in cafés, although the connections might not be the strongest. The same goes with Oulu PTA's buses.
