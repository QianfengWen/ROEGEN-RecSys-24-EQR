Get in[edit]
36°57′36″N 120°3′45″WMap of MaderaGetting in via a car, Amtrak or Greyhound are your options for getting to Madera.
By road[edit]
Take Highway 99 from either North or South until you are halfway between Fresno and Merced (both of which are in the State of California). 

By train[edit]
Take Amtrak to Madera, but do it in the daylight for your health. That way, you can enjoy a scenic trip through the Delta and beyond, and just when you think you can't go any farther, don't fall asleep, you will have reached Madera.

37.022575-120.0751291 Amtrak Station (Take Avenue 15 1/2 at 29th Road. Just a warning, though: there is no payphone, no station attendant, and no bathroom; it's basic).   (updated Jun 2018)
Get around[edit]
By foot[edit]
It's best not to get around the town on foot: the size of the town makes this impractical, and this is probably not safest, especially at night.

By car[edit]
Most drivers in Madera don't have car insurance. This means that, if their car crashes into yours or your car crashes into theirs, they don't have an insurance company that will pay for the damage.

By bicycle[edit]
This issue reflects the problems with getting around by foot or car: safety, size of the town, and insurance.

See and do[edit]
 Orchards (In the countryside around town). When the orchards are in bloom in late January to early March, take a drive down the country roads into what appears to be a sea of clouds in a pure blue sky: almond orchards as far as the eye can see. (updated Jun 2018)
Buy, eat, and drink[edit]
36.944578-120.0744731 TECO Farm Supply (Teco Hardware), 880 South Pine Street. One of the West's last farm supply stores, this store has switched to carrying primarily hardware. You can still get a feel for what it used to be like, driving up in the Model T and picking up a can of dewormer for the cows. (updated Jun 2018)
