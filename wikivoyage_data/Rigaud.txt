Rigaud
While in many ways a typical rural Quebec town, it features Mont-Rigaud, a small mountain in the otherwise flat Ottawa River valley. The mountain attracts skiers, hikers, climbers, snowshoers, maple syrup and beer enthusiasts and religious tourists. History buffs can take a heritage tour in Old-Rigaud (Vieux-Rigaud). It can make for a pleasant stop on the way between Montreal and Ottawa.

History[edit]
On October 29, 1732, the brothers Pierre (naval officer) and François-Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil, governors in New France, obtained the concession of the Seigneurie de Rigaud. The first settlers settled in Rigaud in 1783 under the aegis of Lord Alain Chartier de Lotbinière, who acquired the rights to the seigneury.
Construction of the Notre-Dame-de-Lourdes chapel began on June 19, 1887. The inauguration of the Vaudreuil-Rigaud railway took place in 1890. In 1909, the Northern Explosive Company, owned by Curtis & Harvey, began operations.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The Carillon-Pointe-Fortune and Hudson-Oka's ferry can take you across the Ottawa River to the Outaouais and  Laurentian Mountain regions of Quebec. In winter, ice bridges are maintained at Carillon-Pointe-Fortune and Hudson-Oka to connect the two shores.
Rigaud is within sight of exit 9 of Quebec Autoroute 40.  Turn left after the exit onto St-Jean-Baptiste street and drive about 1.5 km (0.93 mi) to town centre.  Autoroute 40 in Quebec continues as Highway 417 in Ontario, and both of those freeways are part of the Trans-Canada Highway between Montreal and Ottawa.  
From Montreal, take Autoroute 40.  This takes 45-60 minutes except at evening rush hour, when it can take up to 2 hours.  
From Ottawa, take Highway 417 east, which becomes Autoroute 40 at the Quebec border. Turn left after the exit onto St-Jean-Baptiste street and drive about 1.5 km (0.93 mi) to town centre. The trip takes around 90 minutes.

By taxi[edit]
When arriving in Rigaud, or if you need transportation within the town, taxi services are readily available. Taxi companies in Rigaud offer convenient and reliable transportation options, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free journey. Whether you're heading to your accommodation or exploring the area, taxis provide a comfortable and efficient means of travel.

By bus[edit]
A commuter bus runs by CIT La Presqu'Ile runs twice per weekday in the evening to Rigaud, departing from John Abbott College in Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue in Montreal's West Island, which also connect with Vaudreuil Train Station.  It returns from Rigaud early in the morning on weekdays. The bus does not run on weekends.

By bicycle[edit]
If you are biking along the Quebec portion of the south side of the Ottawa River, you will pass through Rigaud. If you are coming from Ontario or the Carillon-Pointe-Fortune ferry, you will reach it via Chemin de la Baie. If you are coming from the Montreal/Hudson direction, you will reach it along Chemin de l'Anse.

By train[edit]
Rigaud no longer has direct train service. There are some buses available to Rigaud that connect from Vaudreuil train station (see the "By bus" section above) for the AMT trains from Montreal to Vaudreuil.

Get around[edit]
The centre of town is very small, mainly lying along the two streets at the base of Mont-Rigaud. It can be crossed on foot within minutes. However, most of Rigaud's main attractions (ski slopes, maple sugar shacks, hiking trails, restaurants) lie scattered around the mountain. Some of Rigaud's more secluded attractions are on different highway exits than the one that leads to the centre of town. You may need to drive for 10 or 15 minutes between different sites in Rigaud.
