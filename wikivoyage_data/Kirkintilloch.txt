Kirkintilloch is an industrial town in the Clydeside area of central Scotland, with a population in 2022 of 20,000. It's about 8 miles northeast of central Glasgow, on the Forth and Clyde Canal. The main reason to visit is to see the Antonine Wall east of the town. It's also a base for exploring the canal and the Campsie Fells to the north.


Understand[edit]
Puffers were designed to be beached
Clyde Puffers were stubby little cargo ships that plied the seas around the Firth of Clyde and the Hebrides, and came to hold a romanticised place in Scottish lore. Kirkintilloch, miles inland, was their unlikely birthplace.
The first puffers in 1856 were simply iron canal barges with a rudimentary steam engine. Since the barge could continually draw fresh water from the canal, the engine didn’t have a condenser, so the piston strokes created a great snorting puff-puff-puff of steam. Later designs had condensers and could go to sea but the name stuck. The ships had blunt bows, shallow draft with flat bottoms, a single mast, and (later) a derrick and a wheelhouse just behind the funnel. They were built along the Forth and Clyde Canal, with yards concentrated at Glasgow Maryhill and at Kirkintilloch. New ships were launched sideways into the canal with an almighty splash, and the local children’s sport was to try to sprint along the towpath beneath the wave without getting drenched.
Forth and Clyde Canal traffic withered as the railways were built, but the Crinan Canal remained an important shortcut between Glasgow and the Hebrides, which lacked roads and harbour facilities. The puffer could simply be beached as the tide fell, a horse and cart plodded alongside for the coal sacks and other supplies to be offloaded, then the puffer departed on the next flood of tide. This era passed into legend with the Para Handy tales of Neil Munro, published from 1905, describing the adventures of the four-man Vital Spark. 
By 1939 the puffers were being replaced by diesel craft, but wartime created a shortage of diesel while Britain mined its own coal. The puffers had proved useful auxiliary vessels in World War I so the Admiralty placed a large order for more, known as VICs – Victualling Inshore Craft. Over 100 were built, mostly in England as the Clyde builders were too busy with other navy work. Many survived the war, were converted to diesel and remained in civilian cargo service, but by 1993 better roads and harbours finally brought about their retirement.
A few puffers survive. VIC 27 "Auld Reekie" played the role of Vital Spark in the TV adaptation of Munro’s stories; it’s under restoration at Crinan. VIC 32, also based at Crinan, runs cruises in summer.

See[edit]
55.94-4.1611  The Antonine Wall was a turf wall and line of defence built by the Romans from 142 AD, and garrisoned to 162 AD then they retreated to Hadrian's Wall. Their fort at Kirkintilloch is just an embankment in Peel Park, and the best sections are further east at Kilsyth. Discoveries from the wall, such as the richly-carved plaques left by its builders and garrisons, are in the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow. The Normans built a motte-and-bailey castle on the site of the fort, but that too has gone. The finest feature in Peel Park nowadays is the Victorian wrought iron bandstand, cast at the town's Lion Foundry.
Auld Kirk was built in 1644. It was vacated for a new church in 1913 and is nowadays a small free museum of local history, open Tu-Sa 10AM-1PM and 2-5PM.
55.9401-4.158392 Kirkintilloch Town Hall, Union St G66 1HH. This 1906 building is nowadays mostly an event space, e.g. for weddings. There are occasional exhibitions and talks.   (updated Mar 2019)
55.9556-4.12943 Inchterf "Secret Bunker" conflates two separate facilities, of which you'll nowadays only see "no entry" signs. Above ground was the Proof and Experimental Establishment, an artillery test range developed in the 1930s. The walls were thin not blast-proof, the idea being that if a gun barrel exploded and brought down the building, the occupants wouldn't be crushed. This closed in the 1990s. Nearby underground was the unrelated bunker, an ROC Monitoring Post built in the Cold War of the 1950s.
Lenzie Moss just west of the railway station is a peat bog with birch woods and wildlife. Access is by the footpath from the station.
