Jurien Bay is a coastal town 220 miles north of Perth in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia. In 2021 the population was 1985. 
This coastline was mapped in 1801 by Nicolas Baudin, who named the spot for Charles Marie Jurien, a French navy bigwig. A sheep-farming town (little more than a few shacks) appeared in the 1850s, the first jetty was built, and Jurien Bay morphed into a fishing village. Better roads from the 1950s enabled it to grow, specialising in crayfish (Western Rock Lobster, Panulirus cygnus), and the airstrip from the 1990s facilitated their rapid global export. This is still a busy trade in town. but being close to the big city Jurien Bay has also become a holiday resort.

Get around[edit]
The town is small enough to walk around but most sights are at some distance. You need your own wheels with 4WD for these.

See[edit]
-30.3025115.03631 The jetty is the 162 m fishing and strolling pier completed in 2011. (Boats don't come in here, they use the marina.) Two old jetties were wrecked by storms in 2003: one was completely dismantled to make way for the new, but some wooden piles of the other remain 200 yards north.
-30.231114.9962 North Head is a scenic peninsula with remnants of a wartime radar station.
-30.235115.093 Drover's Cave National Park is four miles north of town. Many caves are screened off to prevent vandalism and casual visitors coming to grief. The must-see is Stockyard Gully, with a 250 m limestone tunnel that you walk through. No entrance fee but you need high-clearance 4WD to reach it; no dogs.
-30.1344115.1014 Lesueur National Park, Cockleshell Gully Rd, ☏ +61 8 9688 6000. 24 hours. This is an extensive park but the most accessible is the 18.5 km sealed driveway off Gairdner Rd, as marked on the map. It has a profusion of wildflowers, at their best after the rains in early summer. Bush walks include Lesueur (3.5 km), Yued Ponar (6 km) and Yonga (26 km), plus a 50 m wheelchair loop. Mount Lesueur provides a good view of the bay. $15 per car.   (updated Jan 2023)
-30.3153115.00365 Boullanger Island is the largest and closest of the archipelago of the Marine Park. The island is named for the cartographer on Boudin's 1801 survey, and home to a rare marsupial mouse.
Jurien Bay Marine Park stretches along the coast from Green Head in the north to the boundary of Nambung National Park in the south. It extends three miles offshore, taking in a long submerged limestone ridge, which here and there forms small islands. The signature wildlife are the sea lions; you might also see dolphins or migrating whales. The ridge is easily reached by boat trips, see below, for scuba-diving, snorkelling and fishing. There's little reason to land on the islands and some are off-limits.
-30.1833114.99896 Sandy Cape is a stretch within the Marine Park for recreational activities such as kayaking. It's an attractive cove with camp grounds, accessible by 2WD.
