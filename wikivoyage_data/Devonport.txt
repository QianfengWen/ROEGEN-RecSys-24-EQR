For other places with the same name, see Devonport (disambiguation).

Devonport is the third largest city in Tasmania, on the northwest coast off the Bass Strait.
Devonport, along with the centres of Ulverstone, Latrobe, Wynyard and Burnie is part of Tasmania’s North West or Cradle Coast region.
Often referred to as the gateway to Tasmania, being the arrival port of the daily Bass Strait ferry service from the mainland.
With a population of around 25,000 people, Devonport is really just a large town. The main part of the town, West Devonport sits largely between the Don River to the west and Mersey River to the east. The other part of the town, East Devonport is directly across the Mersey River from the town centre. Devonport boasts a number of pleasant beaches, natural bush reserves and striking headlands including the Mersey Bluff with its lighthouse sitting atop.
Devonport is the closest point of arrival to the World Heritage listed Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park, only around an hours drive away.


Get in[edit]
By ship[edit]
Spirit of Tasmania in Devonport Harbour
Devonport is the Tasmanian arrival port for the  Spirit of Tasmania passenger ferries from the mainland.
The Spirit of Tasmania I and Spirit of Tasmania II travel the Geelong–Devonport route providing an overnight service in both directions every day of the year. The vessels depart at 8PM and arrive the following morning at 7AM. During peak periods there are additional daytime crossings, departing at 9AM and arriving the same day at 6PM, and the overnight ferry going from 9PM until 6AM.  The ferry travels faster!  The ferry terminal is in East Devonport, directly across the river from the town centre.  Boarding closes 45 minutes before the departure time, and it is not unusual for the ship to be sailing well away from the wharf at the time of scheduled departure.
There are restaurants, both buffet and à-la-carte on board.  There is a cinema, several bars, and live music during summer crossings.  There is a shop selling essentials and tourist items.  There is a phone which works while at sea, and an ATM which doesn't.
Telstra provides mobile and 3G data throughout the ship to its subscribers, even when at sea.  No other mobile or data services are available.
The vessels have a wide variety of accommodation, these include Cruise Seats, Business Class Seats, Inside 3, 4 Berth Cabin, Porthole 3, 4 Berth Cabin, Inside Twin Cabin, Porthole Twin Cabin and the luxurious Deluxe Cabins.
Fares
Its cheap to take your car onboard, at $65 per car year around each way.  The cost is subsidised by the federal government as part of the national highway budget.  Unfortunately you can't send your car unaccompanied, and you will have to buy at least one seat on the ship.
A seat usually costing between $120 and $180 depending on the time of year.  The cheapest cabin costing between $170 and $280 per person, depending on the time of year each way.  More for a twin or deluxe cabin, more for a porthole.
It can easily be cheaper to fly than to take the ship, and as a guide a flight and a week of car hire in a small car for a couple usually works out around the same price as a return trip with a car in a twin cabin.
Motorbikes cost $45, and bicycles cost $7.  However, officially these are only entitled to the subsidised rate if they are your form of transportation.  If you can get the bicycles on the car on a bike rack within the standard car length, then you pay no extra for them.
The ship docks in East Devonport.  The walk around via the road bridge is a long one, and you may need to get a taxi into town if you don't have a car, or you aren't renting one at the wharf.
During daytime (M-F 7AM-5:30PM; Sa 9AM-5PM) the little Torquay Ferry crosses the river directly from dock to city centre ($3, Feb 2019).

By plane[edit]
Devonport Airport is 8 km (5 miles) from the town centre. This small regional Airport is served by Qantaslink [1] which arrives up to six times a day, connecting with other flights on the mainland at Tullamarine Airport in Melbourne. Local carrier Tasair operates passenger and cargo flights to King Island.
To get to or from the airport:

A taxi will cost approximately $20 from the town centre.
Taste the Tiers Tours operate buses between the town centre and the airport. Fares start at $10 per person one way.
There are a number of car rental agencies with an office at the airport.

Get around[edit]

By foot[edit]
The CBD of Devonport is concentrated within walking distance. So it makes sense to get around the area on foot. If your apartment or hotel is not close to the CBD, a taxi will come and pick you up. Devonport is, beside the ferry terminus, a small country town.
It's just over 30 minutes walk out to the bluff and the lighthouse.
It is, however, a significant walk from the ferry terminus in East Devonport to downtown in West Devonport.  The passenger ferry service Torquay that used to operate across the Mersey from the ferry to the town has been suspended.

By bicycle[edit]
An offroad cycleway follows the waterfront, going up to the lighthouse.  However, the two sections of cycleway relied on the passenger ferry to connect them. East Devonport is inaccessible unless you want to cycle on a narrow path, and are prepared to take the freeway bridge.

By bus[edit]
 Merseylink. Merseylink offers a surprisingly extensive bus service for an Australian town the size of Devonport.  It's nothing like a turn-up-and-go service, however, so check the timetables if you need to use it.  A bus does connect to East Devonport, around even hour on weekdays, however it doesn't service the ferry terminal directly. 

By rental car[edit]
If you are going to hire a car, there are car rental facilities at the wharf.
