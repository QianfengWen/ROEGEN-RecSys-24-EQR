Agartala is the capital city of Tripura, and is the second-largest city in North-Eastern India after Guwahati. It is on the banks of the Haora River, near the Bangladesh border, about 90 km (55 mi) east of Bangladesh's capital Dhaka. Agartala is being developed under the Smart Cities Mission, a flagship scheme of the Government of India, the third international internet gateway after Mumbai and Chennai.


Understand[edit]
Agartala is a city of 400,000 people (2011) on a plain along the Haora River, although the city also extends to the low-lying hills on its northern parts.

Climate[edit]
Agartala has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate just short of being hot enough to qualify as a borderline tropical savanna/tropical monsoon  climate. Large amounts of rain fall all year except during the dry "winter" or "cool" season. The city experiences long, hot and wet summers, lasting from April to October. Average temperatures are around 28 °C or 82.4 °F, fluctuating with rainfall. There is a short, mild winter from mid-November to early March, with mostly dry conditions and average temperatures around 18 °C (64 °F). The best time to visit is from September to February. Summers are long and extremely hot with much sunlight and warm days. Rain is very common in this season, and the city can be found flooded. The Haora River flows through the city and remains flooded with water during the time of monsoon.

If coming via road from Bangladesh, the nearby Akhaura Land Port accepts eVisas. The Cumilla Land Port, further south, does not (July 2023). Exit of Bangladesh incurs a "Travel Tax" of 1000 taka.

By train[edit]

Agartala lies on the Sabroom-Lumding line, with daily trains south, to/from Sabroom, and north, as far as Silchar. Trains to/from further destinations occur less frequently, on alternate days, or even weekly.
The new Tripura Sundari Express links Delhi with Agartala once every week via Guwahati.

By bus[edit]
Agartala can be reached directly by bus from Guwahati, Shillong and Silchar. The Akhaura check post also connects Agartala to Dhaka. This route extends to Kolkata in West Bengal.

By sumo[edit]
There's intermittent sumo service (shared SUV) direct from Aizawl in Mizoram, but it only runs when enough passengers have booked seats in advance, which doesn't happen every day. As of May 2023, the cost is ₹1300 per person (or you can "reserve" the whole car for ₹13,000). If starting from Aizawl, inquire at the sumo counter inside a convenience store just uphill from Temple Square. The ride is notoriously long and bumpy.
