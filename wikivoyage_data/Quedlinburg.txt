Roofs of Quedlinburg
Quedlinburg is a town in the Harz Mountains, of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. It is one of Europe's best preserved medieval renaissance towns. It features a rare combination of ancient and modern historical treasures. In 2020, it was home to 24,000 people.


Understand[edit]
Quedlinburg is on the northern boundary of the Harz Mountains National Park. It was once at the centre of the German Empire.  In 1992 it was placed on the UNESCO World Heritage list. Almost all of the buildings in the town centre are timber framed, some dating back to the 16th century. It is a sight not to be missed, walking through the narrow alleys and streets around the town square and seeing all the colourful painted old houses. In the innermost parts of the town a wide selection of timber framed buildings from at least five different centuries are to be found, including a 14th-century structure, one of Germany's oldest. Fortunately Quedlinburg did not suffer too much damage during World War II, and preservation orders were put on a large number of these properties. If you wish to learn more about the timber framed buildings of the region, a trip to the Fachwerkmuseum Standebau in one of Germany's oldest half-timbered houses (1310) is a must.
A highlight of Quedlinburg is the castle (schlossberg) perched above the city, of which the centre piece is the restored baroque Blue Hall (blue Halle).

Map of Quedlinburg
Surrounding area - Quedlingburg is an ideal point of departure to reach the nearby Harz, with dramatic gorges and mountainous landscapes waiting to be explored in a hiker's paradise. The 'Romanesque Road' recounts dynasties and events from German and European history up to a thousand years ago. Numerous Romanesque edifices in the immediate vicinity of Quedlinburg bear witness to this history.
The Harz Narrow Gauge Railway - More than a million passengers a year and not only for the railway enthusiasts, enjoy this steam railway. Anyone who likes train travel, beautiful scenery and history will love the Harz Narrow Gauge Railways. It takes you through the beautiful picturesque scenery of the Harz: it's hills and mountains, forests and meadows. A trip on a steam train is a delightful experience. The railway connects the principal cities of Wernigerode, Nordhausen and Quedlinburg and several smaller towns in the area. Although opened in 1898, it has only been accessible to Quedliburg since 2006. There are three services:
The Trans-Harz Railway Line: Crosses the Harz Mountains from north to south. On the 60-km track passengers are treated to a kaleidoscopic journey through nature.
The Selke Valley Railway Line: Is the most romantic track of the whole narrow gauge network and has long been an open secret among nature lovers.
The Brocken Railway Line: In July 1992 public rail service was resumed to the legendary Brocken. Climbing up there is a hard work for the 700 HP steam-powered locomotives.
The Brocken trip uses carriages that have a feel of times gone by. There are wooden platforms between the carriages, which enable you to admire the views which are breathtaking, steep slopes, and twists and turns. The climb from Schierke, 685 m above sea level, to the Brocken, 1142 m above sea level, is hard and you can listen to the train puffing its way up. Once near the top, the fir trees gave way to the Brocken plateau. it can be very windy on top so do make sure you pack approriate clothing . The summit has the Brocken House, the Brocken Hotel and the TV tower as well as the Brocken-plateau, a great place to get your picture taken. There is a free viewing point on the 8th floor of the Brocken Hotel, which is all glassed in and commands excellent views. There is a restaurant on the 7th floor. The museum is in the Brocken House with exhibitions on four floors that cover witches, the use of the Brocken as a former military base and border post. There is a cafe on the 2nd floor and another viewing platform on the 3rd floor. Entrance is €4 for adults and €2 for kids (6-16). If you have the time, than the walk down is possible and well sign posted. For further information go to www.hsb-wr.de.
See[edit]
Castle and Collegiate Church of Quedlinburg
Relatively untouched by World War II, the old town and the castle mount and collegiate church in Quedlinburg are listed on UNESCO's register of World Heritage Sites, and the town is one of Germany's best-preserved medieval and Renaissance towns. The town's medieval buildings are worth a visit: its half-timbered buildings represent at least five different centuries (including one of Germany's oldest, from the 14th century). Around the edges of the old town are late 19th- and 20th-century examples of Jugendstil buildings.
The Harzer Schmalspurbahnen Selketal branch of the historic steam narrow gauge railway was extended into Quedlinburg from Gernrode in 2006, giving access to Alexisbad and the high Harz plateau.

Quedlinburg is on the edge of the Harz Mountains, with its dramatic gorges and mountainous landscapes, waiting to be explored by hikers and bikers alike. The 'Romanesque Road'[dead link] recounts dynasties and events from German and European history going back over a thousand years. Many Romanesque edificies can be found in the immediate vicinity of Quedlinburg, which bear witness to this history.

Harzer Schmalspurbahn – A narrow gauge tourist railway runs from Quedlinburg through the Selke Valley (parallel with the River Selke), to the top of the Brocken, the highest peak in the Harz Mountains.
Thale Hexentanzplatz (Witches Dance Floor)is reputedly an Old Saxon cult site, at which, celebrations were held in honour of the so-called Hagedisen (forest and mountain goddesses), particularly on the night of 1 May. The place did not become known as the Hexentanzplatz until the cult was banned by the invading Christian Franks. According to tradition the site was guarded by Frankish soldiers in order to enforce the ban and they were chased off by Saxons dressed as witches and riding on broomsticks. On this plateau is the Thale Mountain Theatre (Bergtheater Thale), one of the oldest open-air theatres in Germany with 1,350 seats, which was founded in 1903 by Ernst Wachler. A gondola lift runs from Thale up to the Hexentanzplatz, where today, the plateau resembles a small Theme Park aimed at families. It includes  various rides, small gift and craft shops and a Wildlife Park, illustrating the wide variety of different species of animal who can be found in the Harz region. While there are relatively unspoiled forests nearby with plenty of hiking trails, the immediate area of the Hexentanzplatz has become fairly commercialized.
Bode Valley lies below the Hexentanplatz. This trail follows the Bode River deep into the Bode Valley gorge. Take in the spectacular scenery and rich flora as the stream tumbles over granite boulders. The walk starts next to Thale gondola station, where the path follows the river, taking you through dense forest and then into open meadows filled with wildflowers, ending in the village of Treseburg near a ruined castle. The walk along the Bode Valley takes about three hours (covering about 10 km), and is mostly gentle, with one short, somewhat steep climb that takes you to a great vantage point above the river. You can take the bus from Treseburg back to Thale. From the same starting point, you can also branch off this trail and hike up to the Hexentanzplatz or the Rosstrappe, the two rocky outcrops that surround the opening of the Bode Valley (shorter but much steeper routes).
