Understand[edit]


Chaves (SHAH-v(ih)sh, /ˈʃa.vɨʃ/) is surrounded by mountains and that brings windy and changing weather, so you'd better bring a jacket or an umbrella with you, at least in and autumn and winter.
Chaves was already inhabited before the time of the Roman Empire, since prehistory. About two millennia ago, the Romans occupied the place, built monuments such as the Trajan bridge and named the city Aquæ Flaviæ. Later the Suevos, Visigodos and Alanos, coming from Eastern Europe, put an end to the Roman occupation. With the Arabs, Islam also invaded the space once occupied by Christianity. Chaves was conquered in the 9th century by Don Afonso, king of Leão. But, at the beginning of the 10th century Chaves was conquered again by the Moors, until, in the 11th century, Don Afonso III, king of Leão, rescued it, ordered to rebuild, populate and surround walls again.
Around 1160 Chaves joined Portugal. Due to its border situation, Chaves was vulnerable to attack by invaders and as a measure of protection, Don Dinis ordered the castle and the walls that still dominate much of the city and its periphery to be raised.

41.7432-7.46884 Forte São Francisco. Strongly protected by the defence of the border with Galicia, by the Middle Ages Chaves became unprotected. It had to fortify itself, garrison the nearby hilltops, in order to keep them from being occupied by enemy artillery. The first to be considered was the hill of Pedisqueira, where there was a Franciscan convent. During the final phase of the Portuguese Restoration War (1640-1668), the decision was made to build a fort according to the modern concepts of military engineering. This fort played an important role in the Napoleonic invasion of Portugal in 1807, when it was captured by Marshal Soult, and then retaken when a light garrison was left to guard it. It was also the scene of several pro-royalist revolts in the early eighteenth century and later in 1910. The fort is based on the Vauban system, with a four-pointed star, each one serving as a lookout tower. The walls are all of granite, with about 1 m of thickness. The height varies according to the slope of the terrain, but the maximum point has 20 m. The main entrance faces the south, with a drawbridge over the moat, that no longer exists. There are other gates, to the east and west. To go inside, follow a tunnel that leads to the center of the fort. Inside, there is the old church of São Francisco, where for three centuries lay the sarcophagus of the first Duke of Bragança. (updated Nov 2019)
