Get in[edit]
29°6′42″S 153°25′58″EMap of Evans Head
The town is serviced by a daily NSW Trainlink coach from Casino, connecting with the XPT train. There are also infrequent commuter buses provided by Buslines group to Grafton, Lismore and Ballina. If entering by road there are two ways into the town, both leading from the Pacific Highway. One leaves the small village of Woodburn, the other leaves from the small village of Broadwater. All 3 are approximately 10 km away from each other. In effect the roads form a triangle facing the Pacific Ocean, with Evans head at its apex, the Broadwater-Evans Head road forming the northern side, the Evans Head-Woodburn road forming its southern side and the Pacific Highway forming the western side.
Note that the locals travel quickly along the roads into town-particularly Broadwater–Evans Head Road. Feel free to slow down somewhat if you don't feel comfortable doing 100 km/h. Woodburn–Evans Head Road has an 80 km/h speed limit and is more residential.

Get around[edit]
The town itself is very compact so walking or a bicycle should suffice.

Connect[edit]
Go next[edit]
The road to Broadwater passes through a national park and may have wildlife on it during the evenings and nights so caution is advised. Take it slow and you should be alright, or alternatively travel via Woodburn. There is still a risk of some wildlife however the road passes through farmland and is fenced at least.
