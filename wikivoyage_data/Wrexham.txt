Wrexham (Welsh: Wrecsam) is a city in Clwyd in North Wales. It's industrial, but has lost its former trades of coal-mining and brick-making. It was granted "city" status in 2022, but this is ceremonial and doesn't affect its governance. In 2021 the population of Wrexham was 44,785.
This is Wrexham is the visitor information centre. It's within Tŷ Pawb gallery on Market St, opposite Xplore! science museum, and open M-Sa 09:00-17:00. 


Understand[edit]
Town centre
When the Romans arrived in 48 AD they encountered a tribe based in the Wrekin hillfort above Wroxeter. That tribe may have had an outpost here, thus Wrocansaetan the settlers from Wrekin or Wroxeter. The Romans laid into them all then marched on to Deva, their encampment on the Dee that is now Chester. 
This area is a borderland, but largely peaceful since Wales was conquered by England in the 13th century. Owain Glyndŵr rebelled in the 15th century and re-established an independent Wales, but was overthrown and his realm suppressed. Wrexham then became part of Denbighshire, nowadays Clwyd. It was a small market town until the 18th century, then industrialised with leather trades, lead and coal mining, brick-making, breweries and iron works. 
These industries scarred the landscape, while Wrexham grew to govern a ring of grubby villages. During the 20th century the industries withered - lead mining ceased in 1914, and coal mining during the bitter disputes of the 1970s. (The Gresford colliery disaster claimed 266 lives in 1934.) The mines also caused subsidence damage to many fine old buildings - Erddig Hall was on the brink of being demolished. The colliery sites have now been refurbished into light industrial and business parks.
Town centre is mostly modern but many 18th and 19th century buildings remain, with the grime scrubbed off. In 1989 the main road A483 was re-routed to the west and upgraded to a fast dual carriageway. This reduced traffic pressure through town and slashed travel times north to Chester and south beyond Oswestry.

The enterprise folded in 1914 when the price of lead and zinc fell and the cost of steam-coal rose. The area has been landscaped into a country park, open free daylight hours. Features include the beam engine house, winding engine, boiler houses, and areas for processing the ore, but there's no interior access. (updated Apr 2023)
