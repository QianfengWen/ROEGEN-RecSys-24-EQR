There is also a city called Kusatsu in Shiga, Japan, without hot springs.

Kusatsu (草津) is a famous hot-spring resort town in Gunma, Japan. It is one of the Three Famous Springs (三名泉) in the 17th-century ranking of Hayashi Razan, and remains highly rated and popular.


Understand[edit]
Kusatsu
Kusatsu is an onsen town, about 1,200 metres above sea level, beside several volcanoes including the active Mt. Kusatsu-Shirane (Shirane), and known for its healing waters. Water for the town originates from Mt. Shirane with a flow of more than 32,000 litres per minute. This is one of the largest natural outputs of hot spring water in Japan. The water is very acidic, having a sterilizing effect. A 6-inch nail is said to dissolve to only a small metal shard after 10 days.
During the Edo period, Kusatsu became famous for its therapeutic waters. One of the shoguns at the time was said to have shipped its waters to his castle to bathe. Then, in the Meiji period, a German court physician to the emperor, Dr. Erwin Bälz, popularized the healing effects of the water even more by researching and championing its healing properties. Today, Kusatsu continues to be a popular hot spring destination, with upwards to 3 million visitors a year.
