The Porta Nigra
Trier[dead link] on the banks of the Moselle, in the Rhineland-Palatinate region of Germany, is the country's oldest city, dating from Roman times. In 2019, it had 112,000 inhabitants.


Understand[edit]
Trier is rich in ruins from the Roman Empire (protected by UNESCO), such as the Porta Nigra, the Roman baths and Roman amphitheater. As Trier was founded by the Romans as Augusta Treverorum, it can dispute the title of "oldest German city" with Augsburg, Cologne, Kempten and Xanten. Unlike the somewhat provincial and quaint feel the town exudes today, it was actually one of the centers of power during the Imperial Crisis of the 3rd century AD, and certainly the most important Roman town of the province of Germania.
Besides its ample Roman heritage, Trier is also known as the birthplace of Karl Marx, a fact that the city has had difficulty grappling with during more anti-communist times, but now widely markets for tourism.

Learn[edit]
Trier hosts a University as well as a University of Applied Sciences (the so-called Fachhochschule).
The Fachhochschule is in sight of the city. The first buildings were built in 1944 and were used by the Nazis to educate the next generation of soldiers. After the war, the complex was not officially used as a school. In the 1970s the University of Trier was refounded and used the buildings until a new university complex was built on the other side of the Mosel valley. Since then the Fachhochschule uses the complex.

Drink[edit]
Karl Marx birthplace, a Baroque building constructed in 1727 and now containing a museum of Marx and Marxism
Trier lies at the heart of a famous wine region. In recent decades, vintners have added reds (especially Spätburgunder) and rosés to the traditional whites (especially Riesling). Apart from the standard wines and beers (Trier - Löwenbräu, Cologne - often Gaffel Kölsch, Bitburg - Bitburger), one should definitely try Viez. Viez is a natural, refreshing apple wine, which many prefer with a splash of orange soda Viez/Limo or with half sparkling mineral water Viez-Sprudel because of the tartness. In October, many enjoy freshly pressed apple juice (süßen Viez) or mixing this unfermented juice with half regular Viez. The drink is traditionally served in a white porcelain or stoneware mug holding 0.4 l.
