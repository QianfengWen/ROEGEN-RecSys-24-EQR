Battle Creek is a city in West Central Michigan. It boasts a population of 52,721 as of 2020. The city is renowned for its prominent breakfast cereal industry.


Understand
The city enjoyed prosperity through much of the 20th century. However, akin to numerous small Midwestern cities, it witnessed a decline in manufacturing jobs and stagnant wages. The impact was particularly severe on Kellogg Cereal, the stalwart that once upheld the now-closed Cereal City attraction.
Additionally, the city resides adjacent to a substantial National Guard base. A portion of the erstwhile Fort Custer Army base has now transformed into a state park.
Moreover, during the 1980s and 90s, the city undertook the annexation of various nearby areas, resulting in its present expanse of 43 sq mi (110 km2), a significant portion of which remains sparsely populated.
