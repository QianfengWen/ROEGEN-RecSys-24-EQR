Dungloe is a village on the west coast of County Donegal. It's in a Gaeltacht area so its official name is the Irish An Clochan Liath - "the grey stepping stones". But Irish has dwindled here as the holiday cottages have multiplied, and only 15% nowadays have it as their main language. Dungloe is best known to the world for the 1936 song Mary from Dungloe, a sentimental refrain of star-crossed love, which is recalled in an annual beauty contest and festival. 
Dungloe had a population of 1785 in 2016, so it's the largest village of The Rosses, the area separated by the Derryveagh Mountains from the rest of the county. "Rosses" means "headlands": grassy boulder-strewn peninsulas facing the Atlantic, with a scattering of islands beyond. Arranmore is the largest island and although part of The Rosses it's described on its own page.
