Barstow is a city of 24,000 people (2018) in the southern desert of the state of California.  The city's location at the junction of Interstate 15 and Interstate 40, as well as its position on the old Route 66, make it a frequent pit stop for travelers passing through on their way to more exotic destinations.

By car[edit]





Note: In the areas between the Inland Empire (San Bernardino, Riverseride, etc) and Las Vegas there are very limited services—if they are available at all! In remote locations on state and local highways, services are farther apart or unavailable. Driving over 100 miles in temperatures over 110 °F (43 °C) can be dangerous. Carry plenty of fresh drinking water during every cross-desert travel. Make sure your vehicle is in good, non-overheating condition, with a cool A/C, and also make sure the vehicle has a full tank of gas.





Route 66 sign in Barstow
 & , both major cross-country highways, intersect in Barstow.  I-15 (Mojave Freeway) comes from San Diego in Southern California to the south and to Las Vegas in the north.  I-40 (Blue Star Memorial/Needles Freeway) comes from Northern Arizona and the Grand Canyon ends at its junction with I-15 in Barstow (exit 184A from NB lanes of I-15 only) while WB traffic on I-40 merges into I-15 SB only.  Travelers going between Las Vegas (I-15) and northern Arizona (I-40) would have to get onto Main St (exit 184 from I-15 or exit 1 from I-40) as there are no direct onramps from I-40 WB to I-15NB or from I-15SB to I-40EB.
 Bakersfield-Barstow Hwy (exit 179 of I-15) connects I-15/40 in Barstow to CA-99/I-5 in Bakersfield. Travelers going towards I-5 can get off CA-58 at Bear Mountain Springs and continue west on CA-223 to exit 239 of I-5, to bypass local traffic in Bakersfield. This route serves as a northern bypass of the Los Angeles metropolitan area for travelers coming from Northern California and the San Joaquin Valley in the north & west, and going to Las Vegas, Northern Arizona or the Inland Empire in the east (and vice-versa).
 &  The Historic Route 66 goes alongside I-15 & 40 as County Road (CR) 66, through town as Main St and becomes National Trails Highway west of town.
 S Barstow Rd (exit 183 of I-15) winds its way south towards CA-62 in the Yucca Valley (via Lucerne Valley), at the northwestern edge of the Joshua Tree National Park. It is another way to go towards Joshua Tree and Palm Springs without going through the busier San Bernardino. Going north, it goes into downtown as Barstow Rd. and ends at its intersection with E Main St (CR-66).
