Bailieborough is a town in the east of County Cavan in northwest Ireland, with a population of 2683 in 2016. It's within an hour's drive of Dublin and is mostly a commuter town. Originally it was Killycolley or Coill an Chollaigh, "the wood of the boar", but in the early 17th century William Bailie of Ayrshire was awarded the lands by James I of England. He settled the area with loyal Scots and built a fine mansion, but reckoned the village huddled at its foot was unsightly. So he swept away Killycolley and re-sited the town 2 km further south, no doubt long mulling over a suitable name before coming up with "Bailieborough". The land changed hands several times and in the 19th century Sir William Young built the Victorian town you see today.

That's what the Pratt family reckoned, when the Fosters bankrupted themselves building it; so they bought it and vacated their Cabra House. This was an outbuilding of Old Cabra Castle, smashed up by Cromwell, and Cabra House in turn fell derelict. The new place has been on-and-off a hotel since the 1960s. Its present incarnation since the 1990s gets great reviews for comfort and service. B&B double €180.  (updated Mar 2021)
