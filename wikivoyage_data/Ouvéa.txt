Ouvéa is an island in Loyalty Islands, New Caledonia.
It is connected via a bridge to Mouli island.

20°35′8″S 166°34′51″EMap of Ouvéa

Understand[edit]
The island includes the settlements of Fayaoué, Heo and Mouli
Ouvéa is an independentist stronghold (more than 84% of the population voted for independence in the 2018 New Caledonian independence referendum), but the population is very friendly, including to French. Expect to be greeted by anyone you will meet on the road.
The island has a single ATM, near the post office and the gendarmerie.
Most of the population speaks French, and basic English. There are many Japanese signs too (virtually everything in the tourist infrastructure is translated to English and Japanese).

Get in[edit]
-20.64242166.572491 Aérogare d'Ouvéa. Several flights a day to Nouméa with Air Calédonie. Tickets are rather expensive but, the earlier, the cheaper. The aerodrome has minimal facilities, with toilets. No Wi-Fi, no ATM. No shuttle nor bus. Arrange a shuttle with your accommodation or rent a car (also to be arranged in advance). (updated Dec 2018)
Get around[edit]
There are no public transportation in Ouvéa.
The island is too large to be walkable (almost 40 km from South West to North East), and perhaps too small to be done by car. The best option is probably by bicycle. The main road is in perfect condition.

By car[edit]
By bicycle[edit]
Bicycle rental is expensive (often around 3000 F a day).
The camping Le Petit corail rents bikes in good condition for 2000 F a day.

Eat[edit]
Self-catering is the best option; while New Caledonia is expensive, Ouvéa is even more. The only self-service convenience store is in the middle of the island, near the airport road. A few more non-self-service options exist, with almost empty shops selling a few dusty products imported from mainland France.
