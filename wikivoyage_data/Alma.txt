Go next[edit]
Alma is a good starting point to head to the "mitt" of Michigan - aka Northern Michigan. Here are a few other places that aren't necessarily in Northern Michigan to get you out and away from Alma:

Mount Pleasant is 20 minute drive north from Alma. Mt. Pleasant is home to a Saginaw Chippewa Indian community, which throws a big pow-wow each year.
Lansing, the state capital, is about an hour away via car. It's a college town, being home to Michigan State University, one off the biggest universities in the country.
Holland, Michigan, not the Netherlands! It's about a two hour drive. Go during the spring, to see all of the beautiful tulips and enjoy the town's Dutch heritage.
Muskegon is two hours away and has clean lovely beaches with bike trails to visit on Lake Michigan.
Detroit is also two hours away, and one of the most famous American cities - home to the car industry, revitalization, soul music, and more.
