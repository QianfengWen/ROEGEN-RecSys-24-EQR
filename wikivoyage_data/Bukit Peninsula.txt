The majestic cliff setting of Uluwatu Temple
The Bukit Peninsula is southernmost point of Bali, Indonesia. Bukit means hill, and the peninsula has a dramatic landscape that if anything exceeds the promise of its name.


Understand[edit]
This is a large limestone peninsula which, bar a sliver of land just south of the airport, would be a separate island. It is rugged and dry, and pre-tourist development this was a real backwater of Bali.
The Bukit (as it is commonly referred to) includes the famous cliff-hanging temple at Uluwatu, a number of Bali's very best beaches including Balangan, and the top surfing spots on the island. As is so often the case, it was intrepid surfers who really opened up the eyes of the world to this part of the island.
The two main towns with strong local communities on the Bukit are Pecatu and Ungasan.
This article covers the whole of the Bukit Peninsula south of Jimbaran and west of Nusa Dua.

Get in[edit]
Map of the south-west of the Bukit Peninsula
The Bukit Peninsula is connected to Kuta through Jimbaran by the busy Jalan Bypass Nusa Dua and this is the only route in. Take this main road south to the junction with Jalan Uluwatu II (the famous McDonald's junction), turn west towards Jimbaran Bay, continue about 2 km and at the four road junction make a sharp left up the hill (signposted for Uluwatu). Continue on this road into the heart of the peninsula.
A taxi from Kuta to Uluwatu for example takes 30–40 minutes on winding roads and will cost about Rp 120,000 one-way.  If you are just visiting for the day, consider asking the driver to wait trip as it can be difficult to find transport back. Figure on paying the taxi driver Rp 20,000/hour to wait.  Joining a tour can be a cheaper way of getting to Uluwatu and this destination is very widely offered by tour operators all over the island.

Get around[edit]
Exploring the Bukit lends itself very well to a rented motorbike. A number of the nicer beaches are reached via small roads or dirt tracks and a motorbike is the best method.
Taxis are not plentiful but can be found. There is a taxi stand at Padang-Padang just north of the bridge and one or two taxis are often sitting there waiting for customers.
A few bemos ply the main routes only but they are neither regular nor reliable.

See[edit]
-8.829167115.0843331 Uluwatu Temple (Pura Uluwatu). Daily 07:00-19:00. One of Bali's nine key directional temples. Though a small temple was claimed to have existed beforehand, the structure was significantly expanded by a Javanese sage, Empu Kuturan in the 11th Century. Another sage from East Java, Dang Hyang Nirartha is credited for constructing the padmasana shrines and is claimed to have attained Moksha here. Even more remarkable than the temple itself is its location, perched on a steep cliff 70 metres above the roaring Indian ocean waves. There are more steep headlands on either side and sunsets over Uluwatu are a sight to behold. You need to wear long pants, if not there are Sarongs and sashes available free at the entrance. Guides, once famously mercenary, hassle visitors less than they used to, although they may offer to "protect" you from the monkeys, for a tip of course. While you are free to walk around the temple grounds, the central courtyards can only be entered during special rituals. The temple is inhabited by large number of monkeys, who are extremely adept at snatching visitors' belonging, including bags, cameras and eyeglasses. Keep a very close grip on all your belongings and stow away your eyeglasses if at all possible. If you do have something taken, the monkeys can usually be induced to exchange it for some fruit. Rewarding the monkeys like this only encourages them to steal more. Locals and even the temple priests will be happy to do the job for you, naturally in exchange for a tip (Rp 10,000-50,000). Adults 50,000 Rp, children 30,000 Rp.   (updated Oct 2019)
Hold on to your belongings at Uluwatu
The cliff is fascinating but the temple is not as impressive as others in Bali. There is also a very scenic cave underneath with rock formations leading onto a beach close to the temple. This is a popular spot for surfers.

Beaches[edit]
There are a number of good white sand beaches on the Bukit Peninsula which many consider the best in Bali.

-8.8458115.18532 Pandawa. It used to be known as Secret Beach because the beach is hard to access and behind cliffs. Local people call the beach Kutuh Beach because it's in Kutuh Village, a traditional seaweed farming area. It is the newest beach has developed by local government and attracts many domestic tourists, especially in domestic holiday seasons. Pandawa is a clan of five of wayang puppets and government built the beach with a Pandawa atmosphere. A 1.5-km flanking access road cut the cliff. There are no hotels on the beach, because of local opposition, but food stalls and beach umbrella rentals are present. (updated Jul 2017)
-8.7914115.12383 Balangan. Rated by some as the single best beach in Bali, but receives relatively few visitors. It takes a bit of finding but from the main junction at Ungasan heading out from Jimbaran towards Uluwatu turn right (west) by Nirmala Supermarket. The road then twists and turns for about 6 km until you reach the beach. Keep following informal signs to "Balangan" or "Balangan Surf" and a west-northwest bearing. This is a stunning beach and well worth the effort required in finding it. There are a few very laid-back warungs on the beach and even a couple of bungalows where you can stay the night. (updated Jul 2017)
Bingin Beach
-8.8055115.11334 Bingin. Another white sand beach north of Padang-Padang and south of Dreamland. The beach here is not easy to access as the cliffs are high but the ocean views alone make the visit worthwhile. From the village of Pecatu head towards Padang-Padang and look for informal signs on your right directing you to "Bingin Surf". Proceed down the maze of small roads here, paying a Rp 3,000 toll if the village attendant is there, until you reach the obvious parking areas at the clifftop. There are two sets of steps down the cliff to the beach which are known as the northerly and southerly steps. Don't be surprised if you have to walk through grassy fields with cows and narrow pathways. Women offering massages might chase you from the parking lot. They'll back off after a firm 'no'. (updated Jul 2017)
-8.7995115.11755 Dreamland. Formerly a very beautiful beach which has been ruined by the adjacent Pecatu Graha Indah "New Kuta" development, sadly it has turned into "Nightmare-land". There are still excellent surfing conditions, especially for intermediate surfers & on days when other breaks are too big to surf. The break goes right & left, is not too shallow and has decent shape. If you do visit this beach, try to imagine how glorious it was before the bulldozers moved in. The entrance road to Pecatu Graha Indah is about 2 km southwest of Ungasan on Jl Uluwatu, and is impossible to miss adorned as it by huge statues and truly massive, intrusive billboards. The entrance fee to use the road down to the waterfront is now not available anymore. Visitors must go through the Klapa Lounge and pay Rp 100.000. (updated Jul 2017)
-8.8112115.10366 Padang-Padang. A truly lovely beach with a big surf break offshore. Accessed from a stepped pathway on the north side of the obvious bridge 3 km north of Uluwatu Temple heading back towards Pecatu. The white sand beach here is a little bit narrow at the highest of tides but is otherwise very nice indeed. (updated Jul 2017)
-8.8137115.09247 Suluban Beach. To the west of Padang-Padang Beach is secluded Suluban Beach, also known as Blue Point Beach. Access is not as public as that for Padang Padang, hence it is generally very quiet here. Even at high tides with the rolling surf, Suluban Beach has a rather wide sand beach. As tide recedes some 100 m, Suluban Beach makes a nice exploratory wade among the rocks, corals and seaweed. The view from the Suluban cliff-line above is a show of spectacular ocean colours. 
Do[edit]
The Kecak Dance at Uluwatu
Uluwatu is a very well known destination among surfing enthusiasts. Most of the surf spots are only suitable for advanced or expert surfers though - the waves are big here. The main surfing spots are Uluwatu, Dreamland, Padang-Padang, Bingin/Impossibles and Suluban.
Kecak Dance (monkey dance) performances are held at Uluwatu temple daily 18:00-19:00. Tickets for the visually spectacular, if rather unoriginal show (it was invented in the 1930s), cost Rp 100,000 (from Jan 2015). Buy them more than a few minutes before the show starts—they sell out.
Choosing to get married or renewing vows in Bali is increasingly popular, and the Bukit Peninsula is the most popular destination for such ceremonies. There is a stunning, modernist, purpose-built cliff-front wedding chapel close to Nyang Nyang Beach and the Bulgari Hotel, and a number of resorts offer specialist wedding packages and planning.

 Tirtha Wedding Chapel, Jl Raya Uluwatu,Banjar Dinas Karang Boma, Pecatu (on the southern cliff edge between The Bulgari and Puri Bali at Nyang Nyang), ☏ +62 361 8471151, info@tirthabali.com. This impressive chapel was designed by leading architect Glen Parker and is stunningly located on the cliff top above Nyang Nyang Beach. The architecture is very modern and the chapel is essentially a series of glass-walled triangular pavilions surrounded by reflection pools. Full wedding planning services offered. 
 New Kuta Golf Course, Kawasan Pecatu Indah, Jl Uluwatu, Pecatu, ☏ +62 361 8481333, info@newkutagolf.com. This golf course is stunningly located on top of the cliffs above Dreamland beach and is a top class venue. It is part of the highly controversial Pecatu Graha Indah development that was the brainchild of former dictator Soeharto's son Tommy. The dubious acquisition methods of the land here by his development company from the traditional landowners is still a huge bone of contention in Bali. That, coupled with the development ruining Dreamland Beach, has led to a lot of controversy. Anyone wishing to play at the course may wish to bear all of that in mind. 
Spas[edit]
 Ayutaya Spa Bali, Jl. Bingin Sari, Pondok Belong Jimbaran, ☏ +62 361 704555. Located with a view of Garuda Wisnu Kencana Culture Park. All treatment rooms have are equipped with a locker, large bathtub with hot shower and two jacuzzis. 
-8.81703115.093571 Yoga Searcher Bali - Organic Spa, Jl. Labuansait, Pecatu - Uluwatu (200 m before Uluwatu Beach and 2 km after Padang Padang Beach), ☏ +62811399150, contact@yogasearcher-bali.com. Daily 08:00-22:00. Offer 100% organic products for their spa menu (lulur full body scrub, manicure, pedicure, nail color, organic body waxing, traditional Balinese massage, wheat grass facial, and yogi surf burn relief. They also offer an infra red sauna and an herbal steam sauna. US$18. (updated May 2016)
Buy[edit]
There are the usual souvenir shops at the parking area at the entrance to Uluwatu temple. Otherwise, this is not an area of Bali known for its shopping.
There are convenience stores and small supermarkets in the villages of Pecatu and Ungasan for everyday shopping.

Eat[edit]
The growing number of five star resorts on the Bukit Peninsula all have top class restaurants (and prices to match). Alila and Karma Kandara are especially highly rated.
At a more humble level, there are a host of simple local roadside cafes catering to the young surfing crowd at Bingin, Padang-Padang and Uluwatu. A lot of these hardly have a name, let alone contact details, and the best advice is to follow the crowds. Expect cold beers and good, simple Indonesian food.

 Cafe Moka, Jl Uluwatu, Ungasan. Daily 08:00-22:00. Excellent coffee shop and cafe in Ungusan village close to the main Nirmala Supermarket. Bread and pastries are fresh daily and salads are excellent. Free wireless internet for customers. 
 Jiwa Juice Internet Cafe, 108 Jl Labuan Sait, Pecatu (on main road between Bingin and Padang Padang), ☏ +62 361 8470736, jiwajuice@mac.com. Daily 08:00-20:00. A full service internet cafe and wireless hotspot. Serves breakfast, sandwiches, salads and smoothies. Also acts as a business centre, has a bulletin board and is a well known local surfies meeting spot. Jiwa means soul in Indonesian. 
 Yeye's, Jl Labuan Sait. Pizzas and other reliable fare is served at this simple cafe close between Padang-Padang and Suluban. Beware that it is sometimes closed all day in the off season. 
Drink[edit]
This is certainly not an area in which to expect much nightlife, and visitors staying here wanting some late night bar or club culture might make the 45-minute journey up to Kuta or Seminyak.
You will almost always find somebody to join you for a relaxed beer on the beach though as there is a strong surf culture here.  The beaches at Padang-Padang and Bingin are the best bets.

 Single Fin, Uluwatu Beach. Sprawling multi-level bar/club with postcard sunset views high above the surf at Uluwatu beach. Trendy, with prices and patrons to match. 
Sleep[edit]

As a tourist destination, the whole Bukit Peninsula area was popularised by surfers. There are still numerous small, cheap bungalows close to the main surf points at Uluwatu, Padang-Padang, Bingin and Suluban, and many visitors just turn up and take what is available.
The area has an impressive collection of high-end villas and resorts as well. Beware false advertising though: only the most expensive "villas" are completely private and self-contained, while most share at least some facilities, and the cheapest ones are just clusters of bungalows.

Mostly Indonesian food prepared by the owners. The stairs down are murderous, but you get used to them. Try to pack light and bring a flashlight as there is no lighting on the stairs.
