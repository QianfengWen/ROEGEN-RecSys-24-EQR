Black Chasm Cavern, a National Natural Landmark found in Volcano.
Volcano is a town in Amador County, California.


Understand[edit]
Volcano is a small town with a population of only 115 persons (2010 Census). Despite the name, it is not on or near a volcano.  The name came from early miners who thought the bowl-shaped valley where the town is was a volcanic crater.  In the 1850s, Volcano was a booming mine town but the years following brought a steady decline to its current population.

Get in[edit]
Volcano is 3 miles north of California State Route 88, which connects with California 99 to the west and US 395 to the east.
