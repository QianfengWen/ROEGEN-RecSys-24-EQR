Church of St. Michael (Michaeliskirche) - World Cultural Heritage
Hildesheim[dead link] is a city in the north German region (Land) of Lower Saxony (Niedersachsen).


Understand[edit]
The historical centre of Hildesheim consisted of over 1900 half-timbered buildings and was often called "Nuremberg of the north" up to the Second World War. During the war, 90% of the centre was destroyed; only a few lanes in the southern centre remained unchanged. Today the centre consists mainly of postwar buildings, 1950 to 1970. However, many historical monuments have been reconstructed. In this process, some of the changes of the last few centuries were removed and the original form of the buildings restored. Two church buildings were declared UNESCO World Heritage sites in 1985.
