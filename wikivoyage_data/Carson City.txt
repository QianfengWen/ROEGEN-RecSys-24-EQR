Nevada's capital, Carson City is located along the eastern front of the Sierra Nevada, in the Eagle Valley, just east of Lake Tahoe, south of Reno, and north of Douglas County and the Carson Valley communities of Minden, Gardnerville, and Genoa.  The Carson River flows through the southeast corner of the city.  With a population approaching 60,000 (2020), Carson City is a picturesque, evolving destination with central access to the outdoors as well as larger and smaller communities nearby.


Understand[edit]
From the beginning, Carson City was intended to be Nevada's capital.  Its cause was advanced by local fraternal orders and businessmen, chief among them Abraham Curry, who bankrolled and oversaw many of Carson City's early developments.  Carson City was once home to an outlet of the US Mint.  The collectible "CC" Carson City coins were produced here from 1870-1893.
With several hidden surprises for the history buff, Carson City is a pleasant daytrip from nearby Reno and Lake Tahoe.

39°9′39″N 119°45′14″WMap of Carson City
By bus[edit]
Carson City's transit service is called JAC (for Jump Around Carson).  Regular scheduled service operates 6 days a week hourly on 3 routes.  RTC Intercity shares a few stops with JAC.  JAC connects to Tahoe Transportation, offering stops in Minden, Gardnerville and South Lake Tahoe.  The route setup and schedule frequency of the various bus transit services operating in and around Carson City makes using public transit as your primary means of getting around in the Carson City area a challenge.

By car[edit]
Interstate 580 Nevada, known until 2012 as US 395, connects Carson City with Reno and terminates at the junction with US-50.
Carson Street, which is also US 395 business, runs north-south through the city. It is supplemented by Stewart Street, Roop Street, and Saliman Rd providing north-south connectivity through Carson City.
Williams Street is also US-50 as it heads east through Carson City.  Highway 50 (as it is mostly referred to locally) is joined by 5th Street to the south and College Parkway on the north carrying traffic eastward and westward to and from Carson Street.  The west side of Carson Street is known as Carson City's "West Side" and is served mainly by small neighborhood streets.

By foot[edit]
Downtown Carson City and the West Side are all easily explored on foot.  The Kit Carson Trail, a route of blue lines and bronze medallions on the sidewalk, guides the visitor past a variety of historic and cultural attractions.

Do[edit]
Casinos[edit]




If you win...
Chances are that, if you win it big in Carson City and you are not a U.S. citizen your winnings will be subject to a 30% withholding tax from the Internal Revenue Service. That $10,000 slot winning can dwindle quite quickly if that is taken off the top. Not to worry though you can reclaim your gambling winnings tax through a 1042-S form. You should get this from the casino so don't lose it: it is your starting ticket to getting your gambling winnings back.

Go next[edit]
Lake Tahoe.  Just over Spooner Summit at the south end of town, via Highway 50 West (completely different road than the popular "Highway 50" Williams Street), is Lake Tahoe.  Carson City is a direct route to South Lake Tahoe and the Stateline casino area, as well as Heavenly ski area and the rest of what Lake Tahoe has to offer.
Nevada Outback.  The other way on Highway 50 East, Williams Street, you find the Nevada outback.  This region of basins and ranges is perhaps best explored via Highway 50.  Overnight trips work best for anything beyond Sand Mountain, which lies outside Fallon.  Other things to see along the Highway 50 corridor include Fort Churchill State Park, Lahontan Reservoir, and the historic diametric opposite central Nevada mining towns of Austin and Eureka.
Carson Valley.  South along 395, the Carson Valley is home to Genoa, Nevada's oldest settlement (established as Mormon Station in 1851), as well as the towns of Minden and Gardnerville.  Gardnerville is home to some Basque food and downtown Minden is quaint and picturesque.  Kingsbury Grade climbs the Sierra west of Carson Valley to Lake Tahoe, and is the Nevada side entrance to Heavenly Ski Resort.
