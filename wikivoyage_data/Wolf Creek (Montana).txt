Wolf Creek is an extremely small town in Montana. According to the 2020 census, only 25 people live there. However many houses are scattered in the surrounding area.


Understand[edit]
Nestled deep in the Big Belt Mountains in one of the most spectacular canyons in Montana, Wolf Creek was established as a stop along the Montana Central Railroad, which later became a part of the Great Northern Railway. The twisting canyon walls that surround Little Prickly Pear Creek and the Missouri River make a beautiful path to follow as they cut through the Rocky Mountains.

Get in[edit]
Wolf Creek is located on Interstate 15, midway between Helena and Great Falls.

Get around[edit]
As a small town, you can walk to any location.
