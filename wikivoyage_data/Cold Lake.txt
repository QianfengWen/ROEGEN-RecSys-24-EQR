Cold Lake is a small city of about 15,000 people (2016) in Lakeland, Alberta set against the backdrop of one of Alberta's most beautiful lakes. Home to Canada's largest air force base, Cold Lake is today the amalgamation of three towns, Cold Lake, Grand Centre and Medley, better known as 4-Wing Cold Lake.


Understand[edit]
Kinosoo Beach
The city's economy is inextricably linked to military spending at Canadian Forces Base Cold Lake. The region also supports oil and gas exploration and production. The Athabasca Oil Sands project in Fort McMurray is having a growing influence in the region as well. The Cold Lake oil sands may become a significant contributor to the local economy.
Every year Cold Lake hosts military forces from around the world for Exercise Maple Flag, a training exercise where pilots and support staff of NATO allies can take advantage of the Air Weapons Range and relatively open rural air space. Running from 4 to 6 weeks and starting in May of each year, commercial accommodations in the entire region are left with little to no vacancy.
