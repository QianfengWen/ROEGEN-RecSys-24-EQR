Toruń (Kashubian: Torń, German: Thorn) is a beautiful, medieval city in North-Western Poland, situated on the Vistula River. Its architecture was not hit by bombs during World War II, and as such represents one of the few examples of true Gothic architecture in Poland.  It is still reasonably off the radars of most European travelers, so one can expect to have an amazing Polish experience here without the nightmares of a million and one Interrail travelers.
It has been one of the capitals of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship since 1999, and was the capital of the Toruń Voivodeship from 1975 to 1998 and of the Pomeranian Voivodeship from 1921 to 1939. The city is located near the Geographic Center of Europe.
Toruń's medieval Old Town or Starówka is on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Toruń is the birthplace of the world famous astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus. The house where Copernicus was born and the chapel where he was christened are still standing in the city. From Middle Ages the town is known for its gingerbreads.
As of 2019, Toruń was home to 201,000 people.

Alternatively, buses #22 and #27 run directly to the old town. These depart from both sides of the railway station; however, the kiosk for buying tickets is on the south side of the station. Take the bus two stops to Plac Rapackiego (You'll also notice the old town as you cross the bridge - it's the stop that immediately follows the bridge). You don't need an additional ticket for the bag, as long as you don't put it on the seats.
53.01207818.6198692 Toruń Miasto railway station is another railway station which is smaller but much closer to the old town. Not all trains stop there, but if your train does then getting off at Toruń Miasto is the simplest solution.

Get around[edit]
Main street in Toruń (ul. Szeroka)
Toruń's Old Town is small. Torun's public transportation system does not enter the Old Town. Walking around is your best option. During summertime it is possible to hire a pedicab.
Outside of the Old Town, there are plentiful buses and trams. There are more and more ticket machines in buses and trams. Still there is a small possibility that you will find one without a ticket machine, and will have to buy a ticket from the driver (they rarely speak English). You can also buy a ticket in one of the many kiosks (newspaper shops), but only for cash, unless you buy something more than a ticket. If ticket inspectors (always in plainclothes) board the bus with you, you may have only 10-30 seconds to stamp your ticket before the stamping machines are frozen. Don't assume that a jam-packed bus will prevent ticket inspectors from checking your ticket: they quite frequently force their way through crowded buses to check everyone's ticket, to maximise their chance of finding a ticketless traveller.
If you plan to use public transport, you can consider using a mobile ticket (Mobilet or SkyCash; even if the websites are in Polish, the apps fortunately have English language versions).
The operators have an English version of the timetable[dead link] available, but better is to use the Jak Dojadę application. It is reliable and has up-do-date info in changes in timetables.
Best bet is to walk, or if you can speak Polish or have your destination written down. Taxis are quite cheap. To get further afield, cars can be hired for around 100 zł a day.
