Tropicana lido repurposed as a fun park.
51.3409-2.98283 Tropicana, Marine Promenade. When it opened in 1937, this lido was the largest open-air swimming pool in Europe. Erected in art deco style, it was rebranded as the Tropicana in 1983 and received upgrades such as a wave pool and water slide. But as the infrastructure aged, visitor numbers declined, and Tropicana was closed in 2000. The facility was neglected and deteriorated quickly, and after a decade of disrepair the infrastructure had become unsafe. The city council announced that Tropicana would be demolished to make room for a new project. Lack of funding and planning permissions delayed the project, until artist Banksy curated an art exposition in Tropicana in 2015, attracting international attention. The city council committed an investment of half a million pounds to render the site safe until a new use for it can be found. The Tropicana's impressive sea wall and art deco facade are a modern day relic of the lost glory of Weston-super-Mare.   (updated Aug 2020)
Birnbeck island and its north landing pier
51.3565-2.99454 Birnbeck Pier (get off at bus stop Birnbeck Pier). Pier in Victorian architectural style, connecting the shore to Birnbeck island. The pier was constructed between 1864 and 1867 when it opened, and a toll of a single old penny was charged to walk over the pier to the island. It became important as steam paddlers crossed the channel, bringing in passengers from Wales. During the Second World War however it was taken over by the military and commissioned as the HMS Birnbeck, then used as a research facility for secret weapons such as the famous "bouncing bombs". After the war it resumed operation, but visitor numbers had started to decline. Since the 1960s there have been proposals to redevelop the pier as casino, hotel, luxury flats, or marina. Regular ferries ceased operation to the pier in 1971 and the last trip was made in 1979, after which the pier remained disused. It was badly damaged by a storm in 1990, forcing the city council to fence it off in 1994, a state in which it has remained for 25 years. As of 2020, it is in a state of dereliction, has changed ownership a few times, and has been the target of vandalism. The north landing collapsed after a storm in 2015.   (updated Aug 2020)
