Lesmahagow is a small town in Clydesdale just off M74, with a population of 4300 in 2020. The town name means "the enclosure of St Machutus" (better known as St Malo) though only the  Priory foundations remain. Their spiritual successors based here are ISKCON, the Scottish branch of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. 
A distinguished duo from Lesmahagow were the Cairncross brothers. Sir Alex Cairncross (1911 – 1998) was an economist. John Cairncross (1913 - 1995) was an intelligence officer at Bletchley Park, but recruited by the Soviet Union as a spy. At Cambridge he knew Burgess, Maclean, Philby and Blunt, but it's debateable how much he collaborated with them.

See[edit]
55.638-3.88511 Lesmahagow Priory, Church Square ML11 0EJ. 24 hrs. This Tironensian monastery was founded in 1144 as a dependency of Kelso Abbey, replacing a group of Culdee monks. It was suppressed in 1607 and its masonry swiftly recycled, so all that remains is the foundation course. The priory church continued in use until 1804 when the present "Old Parish Church" (Church of Scotland) was completed. It suffered a fire in 1981 but was restored. Free.   (updated Dec 2022)
Karuna Bhavan Temple is within ISKCON, see Sleep. It's open Sundays 10:30-19:00.
55.633-3.8892 Birkwood Castle: only the gatehouse remains of this mansion, built in the 18th century then greatly extended in the 19th. In 1923 it became a hospital for children with learning difficulties, which closed in 2005. It's been derelict and dropping to bits ever since, and two developers went bust trying to turn it into a hotel. When another wall collapsed in 2015, paranormal experts said this was because the place was haunted.
Tinto is the hill rising prominently to the east, you get a better view by heading up New Trows Rd. See Biggar (Scotland)#Do for the ascent of Tinto.
