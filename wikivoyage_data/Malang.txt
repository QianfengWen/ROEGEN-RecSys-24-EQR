Malang is a regency in  East Java. Its capital city is the second largest city in East Java with a rapidly growing population of about 887,000 in the city (2017), and 2.8 million in the urban area. Modern-day Malang, although significantly urbanised, has retained much of its historical character, remains vibrant and is regarded as by far the most attractive large city in the East Java region.


Understand[edit]
The capital city of great historical significance. The oldest existing record of Malang as a regency is from the 8th century when it was the seat of government of the ancient Kanjuruhan and Singhasari kingdoms. The region officially became part of the all encompassing Javanese Mataram kingdom in the 17th century which by that time was controlled by the Dutch colonialists. Unsurprisingly given that history, there are several interesting Hindu relics in this area. The region quickly became very popular with the Dutch due to its cool climate, very attractive rural surrounds and easy reach from the main trading port city of Surabaya.
Malang Regency is between two groups of mountains with Mount Semeru, the highest mountain on Java, and Bromo-Tengger-Semeru National Park to the east. The biggest attraction here is the beautiful landscape; there are some temples not far away.

While the executive taxi is Rp9,000, Rp6,650 and Rp66,500 respectively. Both with minimum payment Rp30,000, because Malang is a big city with low price, so the metering maybe stated lower than Rp30,000.
Online ride-hailing-services such as Gojek and Grab are abundant.

By minivan[edit]
City mini-vans in Malang, called "mikrolet" or "angkot" by locals, are blue and can be hailed at random. Two- or three- letter acronyms indicate their routes, and journeys are flat-priced at Rp 2,500 for students, indicated by their uniform, and Rp 4,000 for everyone else. There are multiple routes that the mini-vans take, and prices may differ on how far you ride.

By becak[edit]
Becaks (pedicabs) are a great way to see the Malang city and are easy to find, often on the side of the road waiting for customers.

On foot[edit]
With its relatively cool climate and wide colonial streets, Malang is a good city to walk around. But keep with you an umbrella in the Wet Season (Oct-Apr), and wear cool clothes in the Dry Season (May-Sep). Though Malang has cooler temperatures, it still is a tropical climate.

See[edit]
In a region of such great cultural and historical significance there are lots of cultural attractions and any visitor to Malang should dedicate some time to exploring these.
There are also a number of beautiful sights in the rural areas surrounding the city. Malang is home to multiple temples and mountains, as it is a mountainous region. Several mountains such as Bromo, Panderman and Semeru, surround the regency and can be seen in the early morning and evening.

Balekambang Beach, south of Malang
-8.4035112.53911 Balekambang Beaches (about 60 km south of Malang). There are actually three beaches here: Balekambang, Ngliyep and Sendang Biru. All three are quite beautiful, are close by to each other and locals most often refer to all 3 as just Balekambang. It is best to visit on weekdays as this is a very popular weekend escape and it can get crowded. It is not safe to swim here but these are great relaxation beaches which offer some stunning coastal scenery. There is an offshore island called Pulau Sempu which can be visited by chartering a boat from Sedang Biru beach. At Balekambang beach there are three little islets just offshore which are attached to the beach by walkways. Of the three beaches, Balekambang is perhaps the most attractive but all three are worth visiting. The beaches can be easily visited as a day-trip from Malang in a car but for the adventurous there are basic places to stay at and around all three. Rp 10,000. (updated Sep 2021)
-7.9723112.62152 Ijen Boulevard (Jalan Besar Ijen). This is a quite beautiful street. It is lined with well-tended bougainvillea against a backdrop of old colonial structures. The street houses a number of interesting buildings including the Brawijaya Army Museum, the Catholic Church and the city library. Usually every Sunday, there is an event called "Car Free Day" when almost all of Ijen Boulevard is free of motorised vehicles. There is also a "Pasar Minggu", a traditional market which offers a wide range of items to buy, from traditional foods to clothing, even pets. It starts from 06:00 to around 10:00, depending on the number of events held. You should take in this area as part of a becak or walking tour of the historic downtown area. 
-7.9833112.63763 Jodipan Colorful Village (Kampung Warna-Warni Jodipan). Daily, 07:00-17:00. This village has all houses in it painted colorfully. The village has two areas, Jodipan and Tridi, which are connected by the Ngalam Indonesia Glass Bridge over the Brantas River, the first glass bridge in Indonesia. Rp3,000.  (updated May 2020)
-8.0145112.76514 Padepokan Seni Mangun Dharma (Mangun Dharma Art Centre), Desa Tulus Besar Tumpang, ☏ +62 341 787907, psmd@indo.net.id.

-7.797833112.7368065 Purwodadi Botanical Gardens (Kebun Raya Purwodadi, Pasuruan), Jl Raya Purwodadi (about 20 km north of Malang), kriblipi@bogor.wasantara.net.id. Opened in 1941, This is one of the four official botanical gardens in Indonesia (the others being the headquarters at Bogor, Bedugul in Bali and Cibodas in West Java. The 85 hectares of gardens house an impressive collection and the splendid Baung waterfall.   
Singosari Temple near Malang
-7.8925112.6666 Singosari Temple (Candi Singosari), Singosari (about 12 km north from Malang). This well preserved Hindu temple dates from 1300 AD and is a reminder of the great Hindu kingdoms that ruled East Java before the arrival of Islam. A visit to the nearby bathing pools at Ken Dedes combines perfectly with Singosari Temple. Ken Dedes was the wife of the first King of Singhasari (later Singosari) and these bathing pools are believed to have been part of the royal court. There are some quite wonderful statues here. The whole area has some other fine relics from the early Hindu kingdoms including Candi Jago and Candi Kidal. Ask your guide or at Singosari Temple for further directions.

Visit the many Buddhist and Hindu temples in the area.
Climb one of the mountains surrounding the regency.

Playing golf with a mountain view.
Go to Mount Bromo on your own. There are many "sunrise" tours available to Mount Bromo that can be booked in Malang. This is the "safe" (yet arguably dull) way to get there. If you are feeling more adventurous, you can rent a motorbike and go see the park by yourself. The ride takes about 2-3 hours each way. This ride is also not suggested for inexperienced motorbike drivers and it is not suggested that you do the ride when it is dark, so seeing the sunrise may not be an option unless you want to stay there over night. However, going later in the day guarantees that you will be at the main sights at a time when it is not swarming with tourists and you will have the freedom to chose when to stop, where to eat and where to go. Driving through the "Sea of Sand" on your own bike can be particularly exhilarating, though somewhat challenging. Many of the people working at the hotels will tell you that the roads are too dangerous and that you can't rent motorbikes in Malang. Neither of these things are true. You can rent 150cc manual dirt bikes/ trail bikes for 200,000 rupiah a day from "Moto East Java" (+628123399902) in Jalan Simpang Sulfat Utara 63. The roads heading there and back are usually in pretty good condition after repaving that was completed in early 2016, though they are very steep. Riding with 2 people on one bike may require that the passenger gets off and walks for a few short distances during the steep inclines, but it is by no means not doable. If you head to Cemoro Lawang using a map or GPS, you should have no problem figuring out where to go from there.
But most people visit Malang as a starting point for a trip to the nearby volcanoes, or as a place to enjoy cooler weather for a time.

Buy[edit]
