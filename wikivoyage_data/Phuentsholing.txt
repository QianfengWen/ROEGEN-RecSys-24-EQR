Phuentsholing (also sometimes spelled Phuntsholing), the second largest town in Bhutan (population around 30,000), is on the Indian border, next to the town of Jaigaon.

Phuentsholing

Understand[edit]
Phuentsholing is the point of entry for travelers arriving by bus from Kolkata and Siliguri and the town functions primarily as a place where Bhutanese and Indians do business. With a population approaching 30k, it is the second largest city in Bhutan, after Thimphu. The town itself is actually nothing more than a jumble of concrete, non-descript buildings squashed in a small area between mountains and the border; it also lacks a  dzong, famous monastery, or in fact anything of particular interest to tourists. However, like all of Bhutan, it does offer a clean and safe environment in which to go about your business.  Indian nationals require a travel permit to enter Bhutan proper, but can visit Phuentsholing without any documentation.
The tourist information office is located in the Bhutan Post Building. Tel: +975 5 251–393.

Get in[edit]
Entry procedure[edit]
The information below is relevant only to guests, foreign nationals with visa clearance documents, or those with a work permit. Bhutan does not operate a visa on arrival system, and visitors without correct documentation will be denied entry. The border immigration is open twenty-four hours. 

Receive exit stamp from Indian immigration office (see 'Cope' on Jaigaon page)
Inside the Bhutanese immigration complex, travellers are directed to a tourist area where there is an information desk, immigration officials, a currency exchange and waiting area. There is a fee of 10 ngultrum to enter the facility.
Present your visa authorisation document.
Travellers are not be permitted to leave the immigration complex building without a guide
Indian nationals do not require a visa to enter Phuentsholing, but they do require proof of citizenship, such as a voter card or passport, to travel beyond the town. In Phuentsholing, they will be issued a permit to visit other parts of the country. There is a Nu1,200 per day fee to go beyond Phuentsholing and a guide (Nu2,000 per day) is a requirement. (a list of guides is available at the immigration office)  

By bus[edit]
Before entering Bhutan, non-Indians are required to receive an exit stamp in their passports at the Indian immigration office. Therefore, when getting on the bus, inform the driver that you'll be getting off in Jaigaon, and so your luggage should be placed in an area from where it can be removed easily - certainly not under piles of luggage of passengers going to the final destination. Request the driver to let you off near the Indian immigration office (next to the movie theater). It is a five-minute walk from there to Bhutan gate.

From Kolkata. The Bhutan Government runs a direct service from Kolkata to Phuentsholing, with buses departing Esplanade Bus Station at 7PM on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, with the return journey starting from the Phuentsholing office of Bhutan Post at 3PM on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The journey takes around 18-25 hours (depending on road work) and costs 350Rps/Nu. The buses are comfortable, but because much of the highway through West Bengal is like the surface of the moon, don't bank on getting much sleep on the way.
From Siliguri. Buses depart at 7:30AM and 2PM every day from opposite Golden Plaza on Burdwan Road (behind Air View More). Tickets are sold at a counter near the bus. It is roughly a four-hour journey. See 'Go next' on Siliguri page for more information.
By train[edit]
The nearest railway station to Phuentsholing is at Hasimara, which is approximately a 30 minutes bus/auto ride. See Jaigaon page for more information.  
There are around 50 trains each week departing from Siliguri Junction or New Jalpaiguri station (also in Siliguri) which stop at Hasimara. The journey takes between 3 and 4 hours.

Get around[edit]

Karbandi Monastery. After an Indian pilgrim became pregnant after praying at this monastery to conceive, the temple has become a regular port of call for couples wishing for children. For those who do not have parental ambitions, the view from the monastery over Phuentsholing and the Bengal Plain is still worth making the trip. The monastery is located a short distance above the town. Take a cab up and walk back.

Alcohol[edit]
The Bhutanese are generally very liberal consumers of alcohol, and so the town has a high number of bars. One can choose from a range of Bhutanese brands of whiskeys, rums, brandies, gins, and a peculiar green concoction called sonfy which one would be wise to avoid. Two whiskey brands, Special Courier, and CSJ, made with Scottish malt, are actually quite pleasant. More internationally recognized brands of alcohol are also available at some of the more reputed watering holes, such as the bars at Hotel Kuenga and at Hotel Druk-Bhutan.
