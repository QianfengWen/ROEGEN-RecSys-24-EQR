Kaslo is a village of almost 1,000 people (2016) in the West Kootenays of British Columbia. It is sometimes called the Switzerland of the Americas.


Understand[edit]
Kaslo was designated as a sawmill site in 1889, and grew on the silver boom of the 19th century. It retains much of the history from its mining days. The town today relies mainly on the industries of forestry and tourism.

Kaslo was incorporated as a city on August 14, 1893, making it the oldest incorporated community in the Kootenays. It was an important center for shipping and silver ore mining. After the silver rush Kaslo's fortunes faded but it was re-incorporated as a village on January 1, 1959.

Kaslo is small enough to be easily walkable and the main "shopping district" is only about a block long.  Park your vehicle on a side street and wander.  "Lower Kaslo", as the name suggests, is closest to Kootenay Lake and is where stores and shops can be found.  "Upper Kaslo" is mainly residential with great views of the village's natural setting.

It's a good display of the varied skills found in this erstwhile logging town.

Go next[edit]
If you really want to get out, consider going on a challenging backcountry hike.  There are many to choose from and they've been keeping lots of the locals busy for years.  These aren't always easy to find and they are challenging, so you need to be prepared.  Arm yourself with a copy of the trail guide Where Locals Hike in the West Kootenay, the latest copy of the Backroads Mapbook of the area, possibly a topographic map, a high clearance vehicle and some knowledge of how to conduct yourself in mountainous terrain where bears live and visit some of the truly stunning destinations available in the area.  Some examples would include Monica Meadows, Macbeth Icefield trail, Whitewater Creek (not anywhere near the ski hill, despite the similar name), Fry Creek Canyon, Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park.
