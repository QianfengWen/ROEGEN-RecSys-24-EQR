Understand[edit]
Intersection of Rose Street and George Street, showing the Imperial Hotel
The name Wee Waa (pronounced as 'we wore') means 'fire for roasting' in the indigenous Kamilaroi language. The first farm in the district was established in 1837 and a settlement was founded in the 1840s, the first settlement on the Namoi River. A railway line was extended in 1908 from Narrabri to Walgett, passing through the town, although passenger services ceased by 1975. Wee Waa serves the villages of Burren Junction, Pilliga, and Gwabegar.
Wee Waa is known as 'The Cotton Capital of Australia' as it was the birthplace of the commercial cotton industry in 1961.
Wee Waa is in the Narrabri Shire Local Government Area.
