This is pretty much a one-street town, with everything within easy walking distance.

36.709262-105.4096641 Capo's Corner, 110 Pioneer Rd, ☏ +1 575 754-6297. Italian restaurant with indoor or patio seating next to the river. Pasta dishes tend to be a bit too al dente for some tastes, but the pizzas are excellent. 
 Old Timers Cafe, 210 E Main St, ☏ +1 575 754-2951. Chicken-fried steak, roast beef sandwiches and pizzas. 
36.709711-105.409612 Shotgun Willie's, 403 W Main St, ☏ +1 575 754-6505. The atmosphere is really nothing more than a shack, and the food is served on paper plates with plastic utensils, but this place offers good value for decent hamburgers and good barbecue. 
36.706667-105.4025123 Sundance Mexican Restaurant, 401 E High St, ☏ +1 575 754-2971. This popular restaurant is one of the only places to get decent Mexican (not New Mexican) food in the area. Reservations are recommended if you plan to go between 5PM and 7PM. 
36.706278-105.4030444 Texas Reds Steakhouse & Saloon, 105 E Main St, ☏ +1 575 754-2922. This long-time Red River establishment serves thick steaks and hefty burgers in a casual saloon atmosphere with peanut shells all over the floor. Has the kind of schlocky "ambience" you'd expect from a less-than-famous ski-resort restaurant, but the steaks are good.  Dinner 7 days, but may be closed for a while in the spring after the skiing has stopped. Try the buffalo burger.
