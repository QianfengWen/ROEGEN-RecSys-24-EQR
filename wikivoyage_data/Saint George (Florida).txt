St. George is a small island connected by bridge to the mainland on Florida's Forgotten Coast.  St. George has a tiny town surrounded by a sprinkling of vacation homes and a state park in the dunes.
St. George is a good escape from the rat race. If you like a Florida that is not "touristy" at all, you will love St. George.
