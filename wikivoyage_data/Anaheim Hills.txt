Anaheim Hills is a community in Orange County in Southern California and is directly south of the city of Yorba Linda. Anaheim Hills is part of the city of Anaheim but because it does not border central Anaheim and is geographically separated from that part of the city, the name Anaheim Hills is used to distinguish it from Anaheim.
