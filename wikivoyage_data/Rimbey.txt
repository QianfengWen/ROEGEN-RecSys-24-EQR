Map of Rimbey
Rimbey is a small nestled in the Blindman River Valley amongst the rolling hills which border the Rocky Mountain foothills. Rimbey is mainly a farming community, with the oil and gas sector increasing in importance.

History[edit]
Officially made a community in 1902, the first name given to the settlement at the turn of the century was Kansas Ridge as many of the settlers originated from the American state of Kansas. Among them were the three Rimbey brothers (Sam, Ben, and Jim) for whom the town was officially named after in 1904. In 1919 the Lacombe and Blindman Valley Electric Railway (later part of the Canadian Pacific Railway) reached Rimbey, and there was much enthusiasm for the "new town" by the tracks. Two grain companies built elevators the following year and Rimbey's population swelled to 319 by 1921.
