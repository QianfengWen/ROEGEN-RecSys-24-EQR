La Malbaie (population 8300, 2016) is a small city in regional county municipality (RCM) of Charlevoix-Est, on the north shore of St. Lawrence River, in administrative region of Capitale-Nationale, in Quebec, in Canada.
La Malbaie is advantageously located along Route 138 which runs along the north shore of the St. Lawrence River. Straddling the Malbaie River, this charming town has a large reception capacity, a diversified offer of recreational and tourist activities, a great hospitality and natural attractions. These characteristics make La Malbaie the jewel of Charlevoix and a city of entertainment.
Two sectors of La Malbaie are part of the Association of the most beautiful villages of Quebec: the sector Pointe-au-Pic and Cap-à-l'Aigle. In 2016, La Malbaie obtained quota 4 as part of the "Fleurons du Québec" program, thus recognizing the efforts of sustainable horticultural beautification of the municipal territory. In 2019, the city even reached a 5th flagship in terms of community and sustainable development initiatives.


Understand[edit]
La Malbaie
History[edit]
In 1608, Samuel de Champlain denounced this location as Malle Baye (the bad bay) upon finding no suitable anchorage for his ships. It didn't help that the bay was dry at low tide. The region where the Malbaie River meets the St. Lawrence has been a travel destination since 1760, an era when Scottish feudal lords John Nairne and Malcolm Fraser owned much of the area's land. On June 8-9, 2018, La Malbaie hosted Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and world leaders at the G7 Summit.
Almost 400 million years ago, the fall of a meteorite significantly modified the relief of Charlevoix, creating a crater 54 km in diameter; it is the eleventh largest impact site identified on earth. The impact zone would be located along the St. Lawrence River; 60% of the astroprobleme covers the north bank of the river and 40% under the water of the river. The astroprobleme begins on the southwest side a few kilometers west of Baie-Saint-Paul, up to Cap-à-l'Aigle, located on the east bank of the Malbaie River in La Malbaie. The center of the astrobleme would be Mont des Éboulements (summit at 768 m), formed by the effect of raising the bottom of the crater following the impact. Since this impact, the crater has undergone significant metamorphosis under the effect of various erosion agents, making it more difficult to recognize its outline, particularly the part submerged in the St. Lawrence River. Consequently, experts define this ancient impact structure as the astrobleme. Inaugurated in 2014, an interpretation center dedicated to the Charlevoix astrobleme is open to the public; this interpretation center is housed in the former Club House of the Manoir Richelieu.

Geography[edit]
Its territory along the north shore of the St.Lawrence River stretches from the Montagne des Boies (northeastern limit of La Malbaie and southwestern side of the Port-au-Persil hamlet), to Le Gros Ruisseau (southwest of La Malbaie) which delimits Saint-Irénée and La Malbaie. The territory of La Malbaie includes several villages or hamlets, each offering a picturesque character:

west side of the Malbaie River: Pointe-au-Pic, Jean-Noël, Butte à Caron, La Gadelle, Sainte-Agnès-de-Charlevoix, Rivière-Mailloux;

Eat[edit]
Since March 2020, in the context of health measures resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic, several restaurants or dining rooms in Charlevoix have transformed the mode of meals at the tables into take-out or by delivery service. In general, restaurateurs have shown great resilience by updating their website, integrating interactive and automated applications for remote orders, as well as displaying the menu, opening hours, their mode of operation (e.g., by reservation, drive-through service), health measures required (e.g., vaccination record, mask, distance), other services (e.g., caterer, shops, accommodation, access for disabled, wi-fi, take-out, delivery), contact details and often the history of the restaurant or site. Considering the evolving context of the pandemic and government measures, it is recommended that customers obtain information from each establishment by consulting their respective website.
