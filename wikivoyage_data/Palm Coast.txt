Palm Coast is a suburban city in the First Coast. Palm Coast is a growing city that has attracted everyone from young families who want to start a family there to retirees who just want to visit for a few months out of the year. This is an excellent city for outdoor recreation, with an expansive Intracoastal Waterway system that attracts boaters, to a number of parks and winding ocean front jogging trails where outdoor lovers can start their day off right with a walk or jog.


Understand[edit]
The city is home to approximately 90,000 residents (2019), and lies on the Northeastern coast of Florida in between Jacksonville and Orlando. Palm Coast is close enough to St. Augustine, Daytona Beach, and Mt. Dora for a few afternoon trips but far enough away from any major tourist developments. The beauty of Palm Coast lies in the ability to sustain a downtown lifestyle with charming shops scattered throughout the downtown streets. As well, Palm Coast manages to maintain an essence of peace and tranquility while still inviting tourists to enjoy the laid-back lifestyle. There are an abundance of golf courses, marinas, and tennis courts to keep visitors busy for an entire summer.
