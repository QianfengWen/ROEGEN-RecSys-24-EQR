Ruda Śląska is an industrial city in the Silesian Voivodeship of southwest Poland, with a population of 135,008 in 2021. It's part of the Upper Silesian metropolis, centered around Katowice. 


Understand[edit]
"Ruda" means mineral ores, and from medieval times iron and coal were mined in dozens of villages set in the forests of Upper Silesia. Better mining and metal-working techniques in the 18th century caused the villages to expand and merge with each other, but in Ruda Śląska this never quite happened, so it's a straggle of ten towns with no centre. Silesia in that era was part of Prussia then Germany, so for example the town now called Nowy Bytom was known as Friedenshütte. When Poland regained independence in 1921, some Silesian cities voted to remain German but most including Ruda Śląska joined Poland; the remainder joined after 1945.
Traditional smokestack industries are in decline here as elsewhere in Europe, but they remain active in Ruda Śląska. This incurs an environmental and a human cost: a mining explosion in 2006 killed 23 and another in 2009 killed 18.

Get in[edit]

Ruda Śląska borders Katowice, so long distance public transport is via that city. Katowice-Pyrzowice Airport (KTW IATA) is 36 km north of Ruda Śląska, take the airport bus into central Katowice and change. 
Trains from Katowice run every 20 minutes and take 17 min via Chorzów, Świętochłowice and Ruda Chebzie; they continue west to Zabrze and Gliwice, another 12 min. These trains may start from Częstochowa or Dąbrowa Górnicza. 
50.315818.85161 Ruda Śląska railway station is a simple unstaffed platform halt in the north of town. It has a ticket machine and that's all. Access to platforms is by a smelly passageway with steps and no ramp or elevator. 
50.303718.87762 Ruda Chebzie railway station may be a more congenial place to get off. The station itself is just a halt, but the former station hall has been refurbished with cafes and a library. There's disabled access and trams outside run to Ruda Południowa in the centre of Ruda Śląska and on to Zabrze and Gliwice.

50.290318.87492 Pokój Steelworks Blast Furnace (Wielki Piec Huty Pokój), Hutnicza. Huta Pokój steelworks were founded in 1840, using Bessemer and open-hearth technology, and the blast furnace was erected in 1968. Remarkably, it was then decided to shift this 1780-tonne object by 19 m to its present position. Production ceased in 2005, and there's been talk ever since of turning it into an industrial museum. They're still talking, so for the time being you can only peer through the fence.  (updated May 2024)
