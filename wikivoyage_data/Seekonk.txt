Seekonk[dead link] is a town of 16,000 people (2020) in the SouthCoast region of Massachusetts. Though much of the town primarily serves as a residential suburb of nearby cities (Providence, Boston, Taunton, Fall River), its relative wealth of shopping locales and destinations like the Seekonk Speedway combine with an all-around dose of Swamp Yankee charm to make Seekonk an interesting place to visit, or perhaps work. In any case, you'll probably drive through it at some point if you frequently travel around Southern New England (especially Massachusetts and Rhode Island), so knowing where to stop could come in handy.


Understand[edit]
Seekonk traces its name to a Wampanoag (Native American) word for Canada geese ("Seaconcke"), which can frequently be seen migrating over Seekonk or living, for a time, in the Seekonk Reservoir (the original pond/lake was another possible meaning for the word Seekonk) or other locations. Indeed, many species of migratory birds can be seen in an area which has preserved many wetlands and natural resources while also developing a sprawl of suburban infrastructure, best epitomized in the endless stores of Route 6. In early winter, large mobs of birds have been known to inhabit the power lines on Route 6 as well as they prepare for the long journey south. More about the area-at-large's birding can be found from Mass Audubon.
It borders East Providence and Pawtucket, Rhode Island to the west, Attleboro to the north, Rehoboth to the east, and Swansea (Massachusetts) and Barrington (Rhode Island) to the south.

By car[edit]
Seekonk is most easily accessed by car.

Interstate 195 runs east-west from Providence to Cape Cod. Exit 1.
US Route 6, a 3000-mi connection from Cape Cod to California, is the town's main thoroughfare (here, named Fall River Ave).
US Route 44 from Plymouth and Taunton via Rehoboth connects to East Providence and then Providence. Known here as Taunton Ave.
MA Route 152 connects to Attleboro, Plainville, and East Providence.
Route 114A runs from East Providence in the south to... East Providence again in the north, vertically slicing Seekonk in half along the way.
By bike[edit]
The adventurous Providence biker can cross a bridge and journey through East Providence, which has notorious potholes in places but generally good sidewalks. Many cyclists can be seen in Seekonk on fair weather days.

By train[edit]
From Boston: take the Providence Commuter Rail to Providence or Attleboro (not South Attleboro), then follow bus instructions below. Assuming the schedules line up, Attleboro would be the easiest connection, since the bus and train go to the same transportation center.

From Providence: Rhode Island Public Transportation Authority (RIPTA) Routes 32 and 34 connect Providence's Kennedy Plaza with Seekonk.
From Attleboro: GATRA Bus Route 19 connects Attleboro Transit Center to Seekonk.
By plane[edit]
Logan International Airport (BOS IATA) in Boston is the primary international airport serving the area.
T.F. Green Airport (PVD IATA) in Warwick (Rhode Island) is the town's nearest major domestic airport.
Get around[edit]
Seekonk is most easily traveled by car. Most businesses and attractions are on one of the town's main highways, which are not very friendly to pedestrians and cyclists.
