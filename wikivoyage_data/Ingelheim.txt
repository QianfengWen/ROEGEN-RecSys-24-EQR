Map of Ingelheim
It is a sprawling town that has effectively more than one centre (Stadtteil). The centre, Nieder-Ingelheim, has been rejuvenated to provide a friendly car free shopping area. To the east of the centre moving uphill you come to the area of the Kaiserpfalz, many of the ruins being part of houses. To the west of the centre passed the Boehringer pharmaceutical plant is more modern housing and stores. Ober-Ingelheim is the older part of town to the south which includes the Burgkirche. To the north is Frei-Weinheim where you take the ferry for Oestrich-Winkel.
