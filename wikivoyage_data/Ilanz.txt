Map of Ilanz
By train[edit]
The railway station in Illanz has one hourly connection in each direction: From Disentis (35 min), where trains arrive from Andermatt and the Valais. And from Scuol (2h 50min), Klosters (2h 5min), Chur (35 min) through the spectacular Rhine gorge. From Zurich and most other parts of Switzerland, you have to change in Chur.

By car[edit]
The fastest way to Ilanz for most travelers will be from the west. Exit the A13 highway in Reichenau and follow the main road to Ilanz. From the east, coming from Disentis or over any of the passes, also follow the main road towards Ilanz.

Get around[edit]
The Post Buses run to every conceivable village including nearby, including Vals, Vrin, Obersaxen, Laax Dorf, Ladir, Ruschein. The open-air terminal is opposite the train station. The town centre is manageable on foot, yet the outskirts may need a bike to reach quickly.

See[edit]
The main street of Ilanz curves to the left after crossing the railway. The train station is accessed on the left immediately after the crossing. On the bend of the road a wide cobbled semi- pedestrianised street flows to the right, this is where markets are held every Saturday, selling staple foods as well as local specialities, e.g. Bündner Fleisch (a cured beef) and Salzis (similar to salami). This street leads into the old quarter.

The old town is made entirely of cobbled streets, with solid stone buildings lining the narrow way, the occasional tower or steeple looming above. They generally have brightly painted and patterned shutters and hefty wooden doors, a charming part of town ideal for spending a sunny afternoon (very briefly) getting lost in.
