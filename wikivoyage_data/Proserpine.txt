By plane[edit]
-20.495148.5516671 Proserpine Airport (PPP  IATA also known as Whitsunday Coast Airport) (about 10 km south of town). A number of airlines serve this domestic airport, which has scheduled flights to Brisbane, Newcastle, Sunshine Coast, Melbourne, Sydney, Cairns and Rockhampton. A number of buses serve the terminal and go to Airlie Beach or other locations, most require prebooking. The tickets cost a flat $15 per person one way and can be purchased in a queue at a clearly marked booth just inside the arrival gate. The bus driver mans the booth, and when everyone has got a ticket (about 30-40 minutes wait from arrival) the bus gets going. Another option is to take a taxi, for which there is also a booth inside the arrivals gate. However taxi rides seem to match the bus price and cost $15 per person. Also, there may not be any taxis waiting. The ride to Airlie beach is smooth and takes about 40 minutes. The driver will ask where you are staying and drop you off at your exact destination.
