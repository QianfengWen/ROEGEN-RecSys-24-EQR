Dénia (Spanish: Denia; "Dénia" is Valencian) is a small tourist city on the southeastern coast of Spain, to the north of Alicante province. It has a population of around 40,000, although this can be more than doubled by tourism during the summer months.


Understand[edit]
Dénia is right on the coastline of the Costa Blanca - the White Coast. On one side is the Mediterranean sea and to the other distant mountains. The town has had a very long history predating the Romans (when it was called Hemeroscopeion) and continuing through the Moorish period until the present. Almost everywhere in the town you can find ruins dating back to its historic past.
