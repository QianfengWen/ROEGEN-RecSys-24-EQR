Understand[edit]
A "Welcome to Kingman" sign on a water tower, marking its connection with Route 66
Kingman is the midpoint of the longest remaining stretch of the legendary Route 66, which reaches east of Seligman and goes west to the Colorado River at Topock/Golden Shores. It also boasts no less than forty buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Before automobiles became the primary mode of transportation, Kingman was a major railroad hub for the AT&SF railroad. These factors combine to make Kingman a city rich with history.
