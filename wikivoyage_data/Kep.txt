Remains of a colonial French villa
Kep is a small seaside town in Cambodia, popular with lots of Cambodian beachgoers and a fair number of international visitors, who come not just for the beach but also for the dense forest you can hike through on the hill behind the town.


Understand[edit]
Kep was Cambodia's top seaside destination until eclipsed in the 1960s by Sihanoukville (and, soon after, decades of civil war). The town is full of ruined shells of old villas, destroyed in the Khmer Rouge days and during the subsequent Civil War.
Today's Kep has become established as a Khmer holiday spot and is slowly being rediscovered by travellers. An unfortunate attitude of "milk the foreigner" pervades the local businesses, which makes bargaining a necessity.

By taxi[edit]
From:

Kampot – For a motorcycle taxi (US$2–3) or tuk-tuk (around US$6) be prepared to bargain like a local or pay a bit more. A tuk-tuk from PassApp is about US$10. Package day tours between the two towns often include a visit to nearby destinations such as Rabbit Island, the caves between Kampot and Kep, and a pepper plantation.
From Phnom Penh – Hiring your own taxi should cost around US$40-50 (2½-3 hr).
From Ha Tien, Vietnam – Motorbike taxis take 45 min and should cost over 100,000 dong (~US$5). Bargain hard and in dollars, it will work out cheaper than in dong. It is a 45-min journey mainly on a dirt road.
Get around[edit]
Map of Kep
Tuk-tuks are plentiful. Short trips around town should cost US$1–2, the price for a full day is between US$12–25. Some roads can be a little bumpy, but there is no major dust irritation like in Siem Reap or Phnom Penh.

The beach in Kep
Self-drive motorcycles can be rented for around US$7 per day for a small 125 cc or around US$14 for a 250 cc. Bicycles are also available for rent.

See[edit]
Kep National Park
 Angkaul Beach (45 min to the east near the Vietnamese border). Angkaul Beach was once the swimming beach for the Cambodian elite in the 1960s. The trip there might be long, but it is worth every minute. The 2-km-long beach is clean with white sand and totally deserted except some fishermen. Now there are 6 deck chairs and parasols and a small shop selling cold drinks for the few tourists going there. The water is shallow but clean. 
 Caves. Around Kep there are 3 major caves, some with small shrines inside. The biggest and most impressive is near Kompong Trach (30 km from Kep). It boasts beautiful limestone formations and a nearby swimming cave. 
 Colonial Villas. There are around 100 or more old French villas, mostly destroyed by the Kep locals, returning after the fall of the Khmer Rouge regime (and not by the Khmer Rouge as most travel guides tend to make you believe) and some of them overgrown like Angkor Wat, quite a spooky feeling. Some of them have been restored, but most of them are owned of rich military officials who are waiting to sell it at the highest price. 
 Kampot Pepper (at Phnom Voir mountain, about a 20-min drive from Kep). An absolute must is to visit the Pepper plantation. The pepper used to be the number one pepper in the world and all the good French restaurants had it. It is having a revival with a local NGO (Farmlink) helping promote and plant it again. 
10.479121104.293851 Kep Beach. A single, kilometre-long crescent of sand near the tip of the Kep peninsula. Tasty street food and fruit as well as beachwear is for sale along the road behind the beach. Busy on weekends, mainly with Cambodian visitors, but often deserted during the week. The road through Kep traces the coastline to the beach and then circles back on itself. Cars and vans must pay admission to drive the loop (2,500-5,000 riel). Motorcycles and pedestrians are free. The loop is one-way only and the police do occasionally enforce the law, levying fines against violators. 
10.50615104.3080052 Kep National Park (Kep Mountain). There is an easy trail going full circle around the hill above Kep in the national park. It's a wonderful piece of jungle, in which it is quite probable to see some monkeys and other animals. The trail is about 8 km long (a 2-3 hour walk). If you don't want to walk, the path is big enough to ride a bicycle or a motorbike. There are even some small benches to enjoy the view and have a rest during the walk. US$1 entry, collected by the ranger on your way into the park.   (updated Jan 2020)
 Rabbit Island (a 20-minute boat trip from Kep Beach (US$8-10 return if part of a tour; alternatively, get to the boat pier before 09:00 and share a US$20 boat ride with other travellers). Bungalows on Rabbit Island are quaint and cheap (from US$5 a night). The island is generally pretty quiet and is a gem of coastal Cambodia. Development is slow, though there is now a massage shack directly on the beach. 
Do[edit]
The amazing swimming cave in Kompong Trach
 Lida Massage, National Road, ☏ +855 12 953427. Great massages (Thai, oil, or steam) for only US$7, next to the Kep Lodge. 
 Sailing Club (next to the crab market). Rent catamarans, kayaks, and even a speedboat. They also have a restaurant with some special foods. 
 Swim. While Kep Beach doesn't have the world's nicest sand, it's still enjoyable to go for a swim in the calm, cool water, as lots of Cambodian children do every day. There are wooden lounge chairs spread along the beach, occasionally with a Cambodian woman requesting US$1 to use them. Lots of cold drink vendors nearby and a decent place to watch the sunset too. Don't believe the gloom and doom that some guide books write about the beaches in Kep, they're actually quite nice. Also, going for a swim at night in the sea off Rabbit Island results in phosphorescent (bio luminescent) algae glowing all around you, which is a charming experience. 
Buy[edit]
Seafood, beachwear, and basic everyday necessities can be found for sale in Kep. For anything more substantial you may need to head to Kampot, which is the nearest sizeable town.
There are money changers at the Crab Market that will exchange euros, dong, US dollars and riel. The riel is maintained at around 4,000 to the dollar. Anyone offering much off this is a crook. The market traders will have no problem in breaking large denomination dollar notes.

 ATMs. There is an ATM near the pharmacy. Veranda Natural Resort and Kep Lodge also offer cash advances on Visa and MasterCard cards but levy a service charge of 5%. 
10.489133104.2889681 Crab Market. Crowded, noisy, humid outdoor market selling fresh seafood, plus drinks, dresses, and swimsuits for the tourists. Beachwear here is about half the price you'd pay at the shops by the beach. (updated Feb 2020)

Eat[edit]
Fresh fish with pepper sauce. Only USD2!
Kep is famous for its crabs. The crab market (a 20-minute walk or US$1 tuk-tuk ride from Kep Beach) has line-caught crabs held in floating cages in the sea. Depending on the size of the crustaceans and your bargaining skills a kilogram of crabs should cost 10,000-20,000 riel. Vendors can steam your purchases in the boiling pots in the market or your hotel may also cook them for you. No visit to Kep is complete without having a least one meal of the fresh crabs, reputedly the best in Cambodia.
Several seafood restaurants line the seashore near the crab market. They have terraces built over the sea to provide stunning sunset views of Phu Quoc and Bokor National Park while you enjoy crab cooked with fresh Kampot peppercorns. If you head there early afternoon you can watch fisherman unload their catch of the day.
