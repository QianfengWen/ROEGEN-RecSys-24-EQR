By car[edit]
By car is the cheapest way to go to Anderson.  There are two major roads to take: Interstate 5 and California State Highway 273.  The fastest way is, by far, I-5 because I-5 is much straighter and CA-273 has construction work on it a lot.  However, CA-273 runs along and frequently connects with a major industrial strip called Frontage Road.  If you wish to go to one of these places along it on the way, be prepared for a slow ride along CA-273.

By bus[edit]
There is only one bus line that goes into Anderson: RABA, from Redding in the north.

Redding Area Bus Authority (RABA). The route that goes into Anderson.  The route is called the Anderson Express, which leaves from Gate 9 at the Downtown Transit Center in Redding and then turns back at the Prime Outlets in Anderson.
Get around[edit]
Anderson is a small town, so it is wise to just drive.

See[edit]
40.467-122.27271 Anderson River Park. This, by far, is the largest and most familiar park in Anderson. Most of the sightseeing, however, is just the wildlife. There is plenty of it, though. Birds are abundant, fish jump out of the water (in season), and sometimes, you will see frogs, lizards, and some snakes.  The park's facilities include a softball/soccer field, boating, fishing, tennis and basketball courts, disk golf, picnicking and two playgrounds. (updated May 2016)
Do[edit]
40.4355-122.2871 Valley 11 Cinemas, ☏ +1 530-378-1080. This is one of the nicer movie theaters in the Redding-Anderson area.  While not as big as some of the others, it plays most mainstream movies as well as the occasional midnight showing or matinee.  Many shows that have 3D showings in other theaters don't in this one, so you may want to go to Redding to do that 
Annual events[edit]
 Shasta Highlands Renaissance and Celtic Faire, Anderson River Park. May 6-7. The Shasta Highlands Renaissance and Celtic Faire is a very large Renaissance fair, usually put on by a group of volunteers known simply as the Friends of the Faire. It is very authentic, where you can practice such medieval leisures as fencing (with real swords), watch jugglers and other performers, eat some good food and simply listen to the volunteers' strange accents. 
 Paesano Days Italian Festival and Bocce Tournament, Anderson River Park, ☏ +1 530 221-1254. Autumn. This free Italian festival mainly advertises its bocce tournaments, but also features a spaghetti feed, live music, activities, craft booths, and raffles.
