Gruyères
Gruyères is a town in Switzerland and the capital of the district of Gruyère in the canton of Fribourg in Switzerland. Its German name is Greyerz. This medieval town is an important tourist location in the upper valley of the Saane river, and gives its name to the well-known Gruyère cheese. While its most famous landmark (other than the cheese) is the castle, the old town is lovely as well.
