Balneário Camboriú is a resort city in the state of Santa Catarina.


Understand[edit]
The Tupí–Guaraní Indians  were the first ones to enjoy this land. The historical story registers that, in 1826, the Portuguese farmer Baltazar Pinto Correa received, from the government of the Province of Santa Catarina, this area to be populated. He had come from the colony of Porto Bello, searching fertile lands. He and his family had fixed residence in the left edge of the River, now known as neighborhood of Barra, which is still conserving the Azorian traditions.
In 1849 the village got an upgrade, the construction of the Church of Nossa Senhora do Bom Sucesso, made by slaves, in mortar of rude rocks and whale oil. The temple is known by Church of Santo Amaro. The Village, at the same time was the beginning of the cities of Camboriú and Balneário Camboriú, belonging to Itajaí, and to these two cities, before it became a forgotten neighborhood, after some politician pressures that transformed Camboriú, at that time in 1884, known as Vila dos Garcias, into the new headquarters of the town.

The Atlantic Ocean bathes the well-kept rural beach where the regional fisherman culture is maintained and where locals and tourists alike come to surf. The Azorean heritage here is evident in the construction of the fishermens' huts.
 Cristo Luz, Rua Indonésia, 880 - Bairro das Nações. 10:00 to 01:00. In similar fashion to Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, Light Christ (Cristo Luz in Portuguese) was built at one of the highest points of the city at 150 m. The statue is 33 m high, 22 m wide and weights 528 tons. The main feature of this attraction is that it is illuminated alternatively during the night with 7 colors (each one with a meaning) and it holds on his left shoulder a broad-brimmed hat, which irradiates a beam that illuminates the city. You will get charged depending whether you arrive during daytime (8 Reais) or after the sunset (R$16). Its complex contains a restaurant, a photo gallery and some shows.
