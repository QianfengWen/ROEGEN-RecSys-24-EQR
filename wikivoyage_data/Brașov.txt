Brașov (pronounced Bra-shov in Romanian) is a city in Transylvania, Romania. It's set in the Carpathian Mountains in the centre of the country, 180 km (110 mi) from Bucharest. It's mostly a modern industrial city with a population of about 250,000, but the reason to visit is the well-preserved Old Town. It's also an alternative base for skiing at the nearby resort of Poiana Brașov.


Understand[edit]
Council Square (Piața Sfatului)
In the Middle Ages Transylvania had Hungarian rulers, who brought in Saxon settlers. They developed the walled town known in German as Kronstadt and in Hungarian as Brassó. Later development was further out so this old centre was largely preserved. It has good tourist facilities and is well worth an extended stay: perhaps because it lacks an airport, it's not as well known to westerners as similar old towns such as Sibiu and Cluj Napoca. Shop, restaurant and hotel staff often speak English and German.
For the visitor therefore, the core of Brașov is the old town (largely pedestrianised) and adjoining Șchei district. The modern city is to the east and north, with a "centrul nou" or civic centre, and low-rise blocks sprawling to the bus and railway stations and beyond. To avoid ambiguity, directions here refer to the old town centre.
The Tourist Information Centre is in the Town History Museum on Piața Sfatului (Council Square), open daily 09:00-17:00.
Bring warm clothing, the mountain setting means that Brașov is often wet and cold, especially at night.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
45.707125.52431 Brașov Airport (GHV  IATA). The newest airport in Romania, opened in June 2023. Flights from Dortmund and London-Luton, provided by Wizz Air. There are no domestic flights.   (updated Mar 2024)
44.57111126.0852 Bucharest Otopeni Airport (OTP IATA). About 160 km (99 mi) south, and has good connections across Europe. There are direct buses to Brașov from the airport, and trains from Gara de Nord, every hour or two, taking 3 hours.   (updated Oct 2023)
By train[edit]
From Bucharest Gara de Nord there are 13 direct trains daily between 06:00 and 21:00, taking about 2 hr 40 min (49 lei, Sep 2018). Travel via Bucharest from Bulgaria, Moldova and Turkey.
From Budapest Keleti there are three direct trains daily (one daytime & two overnight sleepers) via Arad, Deva and Sibiu, taking about 13 hours. One of the sleepers is a direct train from Vienna Hbf. A couple of other connections are possible from Budapest Nyugati via Oradea, taking 16 hours.
There are direct trains from Sibiu (6/day, 3-4 hours), Constanța (one direct, others via Bucharest) and Cluj Napoca (4/day, 7 hours).
The passenger train operator is CFR Călători[dead link]. The 45.66125.6143 railway station is 3 km north of the old centre, at the foot of Bvd Victoriei. It's a tired communist-era hall, but there are ticket kiosks, ATMs, cafes and (downstairs) a left-luggage store open 24/7 (5 lei per day small bag, 10 lei large). More food kiosks outside, and city bus stops - take #4 or #51 for the old centre. Next door is Autogara 1.

By car[edit]
Brașov has good road connections, as it's in a valley where several routes across the hills converge. Main highways are:

E60 runs south past Ploiesti and Otopeni airport to Bucharest. Towards north, it leads to Sighisoara, Cluj-Napoca, Oradea and Budapest.
E68 runs west to Sibiu, Deva, Arad and Timișoara into Hungary.
E574 runs north to Romania's Moldavia region, Iași, and into Ukraine and Moldova. It runs south to Pitesti and Craiova.
Ring ahead to your accommodation for advice on parking, which is often difficult in Brașov. In winter you're required to have winter tyres: in this hilly region police often check, with stiff fines for non-compliance.

By bus[edit]
Buses run every hour or two to Sibiu (2 hr 30 min), Cluj Napoca (4 hr 30 min) and Bucharest (3 hr). The Bucharest buses also stop at Otopeni airport.
The Bucharest buses run from Autogara 1 (also called Codreana), next to the railway station. Most other inter-city buses run from 45.66425.5854 Autogara 2, at the foot of Strada Avram Iancu, 4 km north of the old centre. (It's sometimes called Stadion Tineretului for the adjacent sports stadium.)
For timetables and fares see Autogari.

Get around[edit]
45°38′41″N 25°35′43″EMap of Brașov
On foot[edit]
The old town, and westward extension of Șchei, are compact and walkable - indeed they're mostly pedestrian precinct. The new town and burbs stretch a long way. Bike rental is available in the central square Piața Sfatului, 4 lei per hour.

By bus[edit]
Buses in Brașov are run by RATBv (Regia Autonomă de Transport Brașov). They mostly run weekdays 05:30 to midnight, weekends 06:30 to 23:00; there's no night service. Most bus stops have real-time digital displays of what's coming. Google Maps usually plans perfect routes via public transport in Brașov.
The biggest city bus interchange near the old city is 45.645725.58865 Livada Poștei. It is on the north edge of the old centre; if you travel a lot around the city, prepare to arrive to and depart from here lots of times.

Tickets[edit]
For tourists and visitors, a recommended option (least hassle) is to pay using the 24pay smartphone app. You should scan the QR code by the driver with the app to get the ticket.
Alternatively, you can by paper tickets (from the kiosks or ticket machines at the main bus stops - if there aren't any, look for any nearby newsagent kiosk or super/mini market - they'll often display a sign "bilete"). Validate the ticket after boarding the bus.
A standard ticket is 5 lei, which can be used for 2 x 50 minutes with any number of transfers. Not valid on bus 20.
A one-way ticket to Poiana Brașov (bus 20) costs 6 lei.
If you stay long-term, consider buying a one-month pass (85 lei, unlimited travels on all bus lines, including 20).
Lines[edit]
For visitors, the most relevant bus lines:

Bus 4 from the railway station to Piața Sfatului in old centre then Șchei and Tocile, then loops back again
Bus 50 from the valley SW of town through Piața Unirii in Șchei, round old centre via Livada Poștei then out again SW
Bus 20 from Livada Poștei to Poiana Brașov - at the kiosk, say where you're going for the appropriate ticket
Bus A1 from the railway station to Brașov Airport
Some other useful lines are:

If you're going to Autogara 2, you can use buses 12, 15, 28 (from Livada Poștei) or 23, 23B (from the railway station)
To reach Coresi Mall (the biggest mall in the city), you can use buses 2 (from Livada Poștei) or 8 (from the railway station)
To reach the zoo or Aventura park, you can use buses 17 (from Livada Poștei) or 35 (from the railway station)
To go hiking in Piatra Mare mountains (including Seven Ladders canyon), use bus 17B (from the railway station; runs once every 1-2 hours)
Taxis[edit]
Taxis make sense if you're struggling with luggage between bus and railway station and old town, reckon 3 lei per km. A trip from the train station to the old town should not cost more than 20 lei. See Taximetre[dead link] for operators and rates. There are many taxi hyenas at the railway station so be careful (see more at Stay Safe). Uber is available in Brașov.

Old Town[edit]
In the Middle Ages, Transylvania's Hungarian rulers brought in Saxon settlers, to defend and develop the area. They built up the walled city of Kronstadt, which today forms the Old Town of Brașov. Most of the city sights are here, in the pedestrianised zone centred on Council Square (Piața Sfatului) and along the spine of Republicii street. Main sights include the Piața Sfatului, the Black Church, and the former Council House. Around the walled city, you can see the Șchei and Catherine Gates, Weavers' Bastion, Black Tower, and White Tower. To the south lies Șchei district, described below. Stroll at random, or follow the route suggested in the Brasov cultural itinerary, or join one of the free guided walking tours run by Guided-Brasov.com.
Note: if you wish to take photos in any museum, you must pay an extra fee (inquire when buying tickets). In the Black Church, you cannot take photos.

It was scorched by the Great Fire of 1689, hence the name "Black Church", and later restored in Baroque style. Its main features are the six-tonne bell, the 4000-pipe organ built in 1839 by Carl August Buchholz which is still played during weekly concerts, and a rich collection of Anatolian carpets, donated in the Middle Ages by city merchants. 10 lei adult, 3 lei age 7-18.

Șchei district[edit]
If you're weren't Saxon, then you weren't allowed to live in medieval walled city Kronstadt, so the Romanians mostly lived in Șchei hamlet, south of the gate. Here too lived Bulgarians brought in to solve a labour shortage, who were nicknamed "Șchei" (probably from Latin "sclavis", meaning Slavs). The hamlet grew into the township of Șcheii Brașovului, centred on St Nicholas Church and Piața Unirii. It's now a charming area to stroll or stay.

45.635625.581411 St. Nicholas Church (Biserica Sf. Nicolae), Piața Unirii. The first Orthodox church of Brașov, and an old cultural and spiritual centre for the Romanians. It church dates from 1495-1512, Gothic embellished with Baroque, with fine murals by Mișu Popp.   (updated Apr 2018)

Stay safe[edit]
Brașov is very safe for visitors, and the main tourist areas are well-policed. As in most Romanian cities, be on your guard against pickpockets and scams.

Keep your valuables close, especially in the crowded tourist areas in the city center, on buses, and in restaurants
If you plan to get a taxi, make sure it belongs to a company, and prices and phone number are written on the door. Especially avoid taxis that stand in the first line (near the sidewalk) on the right as you exit the train station.
Exchange bureaux have a bad reputation for scams: see Romania article. Shop around for decent rates: the exchanges by the bus & railway stations have poor rates, and for less common currencies such as Canadian or Australian dollars the rate will be poor everywhere.
The forests around Brașov have a large population of bears, and sometimes they approach town to feed from dumpsters. This is the Eurasian Brown Bear, Ursus arctos arctos, which will eat any sheep left unguarded but seldom attacks humans unless it feels threatened. Keep your distance, and in the woods make noise so you don't startle them.

Cope[edit]
Most shops and businesses accept credit and debit cards. For cash, there are many ATMs: it's best to use those next to a bank, and during regular business hours, so you've some recourse if it doesn't pay out. The ATM should also display a support phone number: note this before entering your PIN.
Currency exchange is best done at a major bank, such as the BCR, BNR, BT, or Raiffeisen Bank - they're efficient, honest, and trade all the main currencies. You'll need your passport. BCR headquarters on 15 Noiembrie Street has an exchange ATM that converts EUR, USD, GBP and CHF into lei at the bank's official rates and is available 24/7.

Connect[edit]
Brașov and its approach roads have 4G from all Romanian carriers. As of Aug 2022, there is patchy 5G cover from Digi, Orange and Vodafone. 

Go next[edit]
Easy day trips from Brașov include:
Râșnov with its great fortress and abundant history is only 16 km southwest. Take train or frequent bus.
Bran, another 10 km further, has a striking castle, but is tourist-trippy and overplays the Dracula connection.
Poiana Brașov is a big ski resort 10 km above Brașov. Frequent buses, lots of tourist facilities.
Prejmer is a village 12 km east with a fortified church.
Feldioara fortress is 15 km north.
Further away:
Făgăraș, to the north, has a fortress, and a little way beyond it is Sâmbăta de Sus fortress and monastery
Sighișoara is a medieval fortified town teetering on a hilltop, and birthplace of Dracula. It's 120 km north and reached by train or bus. With your own transport, detour along the way to see Hoghiz, Racoș, Rupea and Viscri.
Sibiu is the star attraction of Transylvania, a splendidly preserved medieval city, about 3 hours away by bus or train.
Heading south, Pitești (120 km) is the last town that feels "Transylvanian". It's reached via Bran and the Rucar pass across the mountains. On the way, detour to  Curtea de Argeș, an old Wallachian fortress.
Further south, you come down to the flat fields of Wallachia, and the highway races away to Bucharest.
