El Fuerte is a colonial city of 13,000 people (2010) in Sinaloa. El Fuerte, meaning "The Fort", was named a Pueblo Mágico ("Magical Town") in 2010, for it has many attractions and a special, pretty-small-town aura. The town is known as the "home of Zorro", so keep an eye open for Antonio Banderas swashbuckling his way through town.

Though often referred to as the Gateway to Copper Canyon (Barranca del Cobre), El Fuerte is a delightful destination in itself, best visited from November through April. 
Founded as San Juan Bautista de Carapoa in 1564 by Spanish explorers, the city derives its present name from the fort constructed in 1610 to defend against attacks by the Zuaque and Tehueco tribes who resented the Spanish intrusion. El Fuerte soon became one of the most important staging and trading centers of northern Mexico, with its location near the head of the wide, verdant Río Fuerte valley assuring prosperity from agriculture. In 1824, it became the territorial capital of the vast area comprising what is now Sinaloa, Sonora, and part of southern Arizona.
The architectural results of this history are evident today throughout the center of the city, from the central Plaza de Armas to the colonial mansions that extend for several blocks.

El Fuerte church and plaza
There are local petroglyphs a short distance from the downtown in the Rio Fuerte basin. These rock inscriptions were left by Nahua groups that centuries ago passed through the Sinaloan migratory corridor. Access to them is somewhat difficult.
The Cerro de la Máscara is an archaeological site just north of town and across the Rio Fuerte. The site is home to a petroglyph complex, considered one of the most significant in the state due to the sheer number of engravings and the diversity of contents. It is located on the banks of the Río Fuerte, approximately 5 km from the city. In total, there are about 45 stones that together contain more than 100 engravings, whose antiquity is estimated between 800 and 2500 years, in different stages of sculptural application and that, due to historical memory, must belong to Toltec and Aztec migrations. Highlighting among them: the buried Stone of the Goddess of Fertility or Parturient Woman, and The Chief.
