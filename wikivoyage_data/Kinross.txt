Kinross is a small town in Perth and Kinross, 13 miles south of Perth. With a population of 5650 in 2021, it stands on the shores of Loch Leven, with the scarp of the Lomond Hills looming to the east and a mysterious giant golf ball to the west. The reason to visit is to take the boat across the loch to the island castle, where Mary Queen of Scots was held captive but escaped. Another island in the loch may be the place where Macbeth's theatrical fate was first written down.


Understand[edit]
The golf ball at Balado Bridge
The Lomond Hills are volcanic crags that force the route from the Fife coast (nowadays the M90) to pass this way before crossing the Ochil hills towards Perth. Kinross thus grew up as a market town in a fertile lowland plain. From 1890 it was the county town of the small county of Kinross-shire. In 1927 the county council adopted the sturdy slogan “For all time”, which turned out to mean until 1930 when the county was amalgamated with Perthshire.
There isn't a physical tourist information centre, but see Visit Loch Leven online.

From the P&R to town centre and on to the boat pier is only a mile. You'll need a car to get round the loch, for instance to climb The Bishop.

See[edit]
Loch Leven is the shallow freshwater lake east side of town: it may be the crater of a meteor impact. It’s triangular, 4 miles long by 1½ miles wide, and is drained from its southeast tip by the River Leven, which flows east to the coast at Leven. In the early 19th century the upper river was canalised, the surrounding wetland drained for farming, and the level of the loch dropped by almost 5 feet. So its islands enlarged while new ones appeared. Much wetland remains, and the islands provide safe nesting for both resident and migratory birds, such as pink-footed geese in their thousands. The area is therefore a National Nature Reserve (NNR) and Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).
56.2008-3.39191 Loch Leven Castle, Kinross KY13 8UF (10 min ferry from Kinross pier), ☏ +44 7836 313769. Apr-Oct daily 10AM-4PM. Mary Stuart was only six days old when in 1542 her father James V died, and she became Queen of Scotland. At first, regents ruled the country while she lived mostly in France. Her husbands were short-lived: first Francis II of France, then Lord Darnley; Mary promptly married Bothwell who was suspected of Darnley's murder. In 1567 the pair of them were overthrown, and Mary was imprisoned in Loch Leven Castle and forced to abdicate. She made several attempts to escape and succeeded in 1568: the scene of her being rowed away has graced innumerable historical romances. She made her way to England thinking her cousin Queen Elizabeth would protect her — big mistake. The castle was built around 1300 and took up almost all of what was then a much smaller island, and an early visitor under duress was King Alexander III. In the 17th century it ceased to be a residence and fell derelict. It's now in the keeping of Historic Environment Scotland. You can stroll the peaceful woodlands while awaiting the return ferry. This only has capacity for 12, so on summer weekends best book your visit. Adult £10, conc £9, child £6, HS free.   (updated Apr 2024)
56.1897-3.35732 St Serfs Inch is the largest island in the loch. You'll probably just admire it through binoculars as there are no regular boat trips. Its ruined Augustinian monastery or priory is 12th century but stands on the site of a much older Culdee foundation. Macbeth’s theatrical fate may have been first written here, as its canon Andrew of Wyntoun related the witches’ prophecies in the Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland. This was written circa 1420 and Shakespeare drew on this source. Wyntoun also described Robin Hood, who first appeared in legend in the 13th century.

56.2-3.3156 Scotlandwell has been a spa and pilgrimage site since Roman times for its spring bubbling out of the hillside. Robert the Bruce is said to have been cured of leprosy here. By the 19th century it was “an almost unapproachable slough of mire and filth" but village and well were refurbished in the 1850s and again in modern times.
56.21-3.467 The golf ball west of town is the radar dome of a former Ministry of Defence (MOD) communications base, containing a large dish antenna. Balado Bridge was an RAF airfield 1942-57 then from 1985 to 2006 was a Satcom II Satellite Ground Listening Station. From 1997 to 2014 the nearby fields hosted “T in the Park” music festival, which then moved to Strathallan Castle then folded. The airfield’s hard standing nowadays supports a fine array of chicken sheds. The MOD sold the site in 2007; in the years since it's been back on the market with an asking price of £1 million. The main blockhouse is claimed to be proof against chemical and nuclear attack and chickens. No public access to the site but you see enough from the road.
56.1883-3.5288 Tullibole Castle off A977 is a 17th-century tower house, and nowadays a posh event venue.

Glider over Portmoak
Loch Leven Heritage Trail circles the loch. It's firm going and barrier free — 13 miles to go round, so maybe one to cycle rather than walk.
The Bishop is the scarp of the Lomond Hills that rises steeply east of the loch. The best path starts opposite Portmoak Church 400 yards north of Scotlandwell. There are various rock formations, the most striking being the 30-foot Carlin Maggie, said to be a petrified witch.
