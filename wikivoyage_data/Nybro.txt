Central Nybro - Stora Hotellet on the right
Nybro is a city in Småland in Sweden. The local industry is dominated by companies within glass manufacturing, paper and wood. The biggest employer is the floor manufacturer AB Gustaf Kähr. Nybro is the gateway to the world famous Swedish glass manufacturing district Glasriket which can be translated to The Kingdom of Glass.


Understand[edit]
Nybro's importance as a center of trade and manufacturing increased gradually during the first half of the 19th century. In 1865 Nybro achieved market town status. During the 1870s, the railway reached Nybro and Kalmar, something which meant a financial and demographic increase. In 1932, Nybro had grown so much that it achieved town status. The increase in population terms continued until the 1970s, but has since decreased. The previous villages Hanemåla and Madesjö are now a part of the town.
Orrefors, 16 km (9.9 mi) north-east of Nybro is one of several glass manufacturing villages in the area.
