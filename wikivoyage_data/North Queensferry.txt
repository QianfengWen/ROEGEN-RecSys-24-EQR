North Queensferry is a village in Fife in central Scotland, with a population of 1076 in 2011. It's on the north bank of the Firth of Forth, at a narrow point that has been a ferry crossing for many centuries. From around 1068 AD, St Margaret wife of King Malcolm III supported the ferry to ensure regular transport from Edinburgh to Dunfermline (then the capital) and to the pilgrimage town of St Andrews. She was a regular traveller and the crossing became known as "Queen's Ferry".
The distinctive railway bridge opened in 1890, to adorn a myriad biscuit tin lids, while the road crossing was by ferry until 1964 when the Forth Road Bridge opened. By the 1990s this was showing its age and in 2017 the Queensferry Crossing (M90) opened. So nowadays trains, trucks and coaches rumble high above the village, which has become a backwater, with the waves lapping gently on its little-used slipway. The main reasons to visit are the walk-through aquarium "Deep Sea World", to walk across the Forth Road Bridge for the views, and for hikes along the Fife Coastal Trail.
This page also briefly describes Inverkeithing two miles north, which is residential and post-industrial but is a minor transport hub.

 Edinburgh Airport has good flight connections across Europe and UK and within Scotland. Direct buses run from airport stop G across the old Forth Road Bridge towards Inverkeithing and Halbeath in Fife, get off at the bus stop north end of the bridge and descend the steps to the village. This is Stagecoach Jet 747 bus which takes 30 min and costs £7.50 single and £14 for a return within 28 days. It runs daily 24 hours, every 20 min daytime.

By car[edit]
A9000, the Forth Road Bridge, is only for bikes, motorcycles and public transport. Other vehicles must use M90, the new Queensferry Crossing. They're both toll-free, take the first exit on the north bank to reach town.

Inverkeithing was described in 1758 as a "mean, miserable, paultry town, teaching us what to expect from its neighbouring villages". It was industrial from medieval times, and is now part of the Fife rustbelt and commuterland. It's worth a brief stop for St Peter's Kirk (rebuilt in 1826 in Gothic), the Hospitium of Grey Friars from 1350, and Mercat Cross. The Town House Museum remains closed in 2021.
56-3.3864 Inchgarvie is the gaunt islet beneath the railway bridge, looking like a stone warship: indeed it was fortified in wartime. What you see is just the tip of a submerged crag similar to Edinburgh castle, but dwarfed by the massive bridge supports. It's uninhabited and with no access.
Inchcolm is the most interesting of the three small islands further east, for its ruined abbey. Boat trips visit from South Queensferry.
Do[edit]
Walk the Fife coastal path. Use OS Landranger Map 65 "Falkirk". Going east, the path hugs the coast through Inverkeithing and Dalgety Bay, then at the ruins of St Bridget's Kirk it swings inland to come into Aberdour. Going west, you have to stay on the road as you pass under the bridges and follow it inland, to avoid the navy base. There's a couple of miles to tramp through industrial Rosyth before you can return to the coast at Limekilns, and continue west via Charlestown and Torryburn to Culross.
