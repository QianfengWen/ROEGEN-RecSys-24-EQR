Adler (Russian: Áдлер, Ah-dler) is the center of Adler district and is part of Greater Sochi.


Understand[edit]

Adler is the historic and administrative center of Adler district. It is 22 km from the center of Sochi and is 7 km from Khosta. The center of Adler is located near the inflow of Mzymta river to the Black Sea. Adler hosted the 2014 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

Talk[edit]
As in all of Russia, Russian is preferred language. You also can hear Armenian spoken on the streets due to the large Armenian community. English is not widely spoken, so it's a good idea to prepare some Russian phrases for communication.

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
Almost every train going to Sochi from other Russian cities has a last stop in Adler. The railroad station is a bit aside from the center.
A commuter line is running every half an hour from Sochi station and the trip takes about 30 minutes.

By bus[edit]
There are buses running from about 07:00 to about 22:00.
Buses 125 and 124 run from Sochi railroad station to Adler center. The trip usually takes about 40 minutes but due to traffic it can be as long as 2 hours. 

By plane[edit]
Sochi airport is located in Adler. You can take several buses to get from there:

51 - from the airport to central market;
105, 124 - from the airport to the railroad station (can take also to kurortny gorodok).
There is also an option of using aeroexpress, departing to Sochi railroad station every hour and has a stop at Adler station as well. But the price for a short trip (9 min) is quite high, so it is recommended to use buses.
Also you could take a taxi, but it is necessary to have it booked beforehand as the prices in the airport will be inadequately high.
