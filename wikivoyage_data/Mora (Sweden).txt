Mora[dead link] is a city in the Dalarna province in Sweden. It is on the shore of Lake Siljan, the sixth largest lake in Sweden. The municipality of Mora has about 20,000 inhabitants.


Understand[edit]
Due to its strategic location on the isthmus between the lakes Siljan and Orsan, with the Dalälv river as a major communication route, the area has been populated as early as the 7th century AD. Several archaeological discoveries from around 1000 AD tells of a rich  Viking-era culture built around fur hunting, fishing and iron processing.
The name "Mora" is first used in written sources in 1325. The word itself is the plural user of the dialectical word 'mor', meaning "dense forest on damp land". Mora became an important place in Swedish history during the 16th century, when it supported Gustav Vasa in the Swedish war of independence from the Kalmar Union, 1521-1523.
Mora became industrialized during the latter part of the 18th century with the production of Mora clocks. During the 19th century Mora instead became a producer of knives, faucets and ice drills.

The Dalarna province is by many considered to be the very essence of Sweden, and Mora is a strong contributor to that fact. This is the home of the Dala Horse, the most famous Swedish souvenir there is.

Nusnäs (10 km south-east of Mora. To get to Nusnäs from Mora, take bus 108 from the railway station in Mora) The village of Nusnäs is the place where the Dala Horse is made. These small wooden horses have been around since the 17th century. They are normally painted orange or blue with symmetrical decorations known as kurbits painting. The horses are carved and painted in workshops open for tourists, and you can buy a carving kit of your own or even try to paint one yourself. Dala Horse workshops in Nusnäs:

Gopsmor, Zorn's refuge when the pressure got too high, is in the municipality of Älvdalen and is only open for visitors in July. 
Do[edit]
Ice hockey is popular in Mora. The local team Mora IK remains the arch rival of Leksand, the traditional hockey superpower in the lwague. The two teams have  rollercoasted in and out of the top league, SHL. After failing the 2019 SHL qualifiers, Mora has been relegated for play in the second-tier league, HockeyAllsvenskan. During the hockey season (September-March) you can join the crowds in FM Mattsson Arena. Tickets can be purchased at the tourist agency. If you want to stand with the hardcore fans a ticket is 125 kr, if you prefer sitting down prices range from 180 kr to 295 kr.
 Vasaloppet. The world's third longest cross-country skiing race, takes place every year on the first Sunday of March. It is a memory of how Swedish king-to-be Gustav Vasa went on skis between Mora and Sälen, where he was talked into staying in Sweden and lead the fight against the Danes. The memorial race goes in the opposite direction and around 16,000 skiers try to make it from Sälen to the goal in Mora, a distance of 90 km. The goal now stands in the middle of Mora (Vasagatan, near the corner with Björnramsgatan) all year round, a portal consisting of two red pillars and a banner with the classical inscription "I fäders spår - för framtids segrar" ("In fathers' tracks - for future victories"). The event itself has grown into Vasaloppet's Week (Vasaloppsveckan), an entire week in late February filled with ski races and other activities. 
Buy[edit]
Might as well get that Dala Horse immediately. You can run but you can't hide.
A more useful memory of Mora would be a Mora knife, the weapon of choice for Swedes whatever task needs to be fulfilled. You will for instance never see a Swedish soldier or construction worker without a Mora knife in his belt. Old style Mora knives have handles made of wood, but cheaper versions with plastic handles are available as well. The knives are made by two Mora companies: Frosts and Mora of Sweden. Mora of Sweden[dead link] has an outlet store.
