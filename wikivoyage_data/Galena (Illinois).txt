Galena is a city in the Illinois Driftless Area 16 miles east of Dubuque, Iowa, and 163 miles west from Chicago. Galena is known as "The City that Time Forgot" for its rich 19th century heritage. 
Named after the local lead deposits, the city was founded in 1826 and was a major port on the Mississippi River. Its fortunes changed in the 20th century as demand for lead dropped, but in the 1980s, the city reinvented itself as a tourist destination. 
Today, 3,200 residents (as of 2018) form a community that is rich in history, claiming the home of the 18th President of the United States, Ulysses S. Grant. More than a thousand buildings in Galena are listed in the National Register of Historic Places by the U.S. Department of the Interior. Many of the elegantly restored homes are now bed & breakfasts or open to the public for tours. Galena has become the third largest tourist attraction in Illinois after Chicago and Springfield.

The name Galena comes from the word for lead sulfide, and indeed the very reason for the town's early growth was the abundant lead found in the area, mined since the times of the Native Americans.  Galena grew to be the most important river port north of St. Louis (despite only being on a small tributary of the Mississippi) and in its heyday rivaled Chicago in size and importance.  During the Age of Railroads, however, the town passed up a Chicago-Dubuque rail line in order to "keep the sanctity of the port", a decision that began Galena's decline.  Floods and the Great Depression took their tolls as well, but soon enough people began to move back and restore the beautiful 19th century heritage.  Now Galena has reinvented itself as a tourist destination, taking in its commercial and presidential history, beautiful setting among the hilly driftless region, and ample opportunity for outdoor recreation, becoming a popular weekend destination for Illinoisans, Iowans, and Wisconsinites.

By car[edit]
The vast majority of visitors to Galena arrive by car. Galena is intersected on the west end by US 20 (between East Dubuque and Chicago), which runs concurrently with IL 84. IL 84 branches off north of Galena to become WI 80 to Platteville. From Chicago, take I 90 west to Rockford and follow US 20 further west. From the south (such as Springfield or the Quad Cities), take IL 84 north along the Great River Road until it intersects US 20 north of Hanover.
There is ample free parking throughout the city.

By plane[edit]
There are no major airports near Galena. Dubuque Regional Airport (DBQ IATA) is a small airport 23 miles west in Iowa, serving American Airlines flights from O'Hare International Airport in Chicago and charter services. You will need to rent a car or take a taxi to reach Galena.
Despite the city's prominence as a northern Illinois tourist destination, there are no interurban bus or train services.

Get around[edit]
Map of Galena and environs
Galena is only two miles long, so the most convenient way to travel is to park and walk through town. However, there is a fairly steep bluff between Bench and Prospect streets, which may make northwest foot travel from downtown difficult. Most parking is free, although parking spaces in the downtown area (Bench, Main, and Commerce streets) fill up quickly. There is also a large pay lot on the south bank of the Galena river west of Grant Park. A few companies offer trolley services that stop at significant places in town, which can also be chartered.
