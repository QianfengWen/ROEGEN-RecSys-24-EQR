Alcamo Marina is a seaside resort in Sicily in the territory of Alcamo (Trapani). It is characterized by a lot of holiday houses, where thousands of people from Alcamo are hosted together with tourists, attracted by its golden beaches (about 7 km long) and from the possibility they have of visiting the nearby tourist resorts.


Understand[edit]
Geography[edit]
Alcamo Marina is in the middle of the coast of the Gulf of Castellammare, near the towns of Alcamo (in the south), Castellammare del Golfo (in the west) and Balestrate (in the east).

When to go[edit]
As it is a seaside resort, the best period for visiting this place is certainly summertime, especially in June and September; you can practise a lot of aquatic sports, and in the afternoon they organize various sport tournaments.
For the people who love tranquillity, jogging or biking, the best months are May and October: in fact since half September, Alcamo Marina begins to empty because vintage time starts and this is one of the greatest economic activities in the Alcamo area.

History[edit]
Alcamo Marina began as a centre for tuna fishing, later, it was turned into a holiday resort and, as a consequence, restaurants, pizzerias, bars and entertainment places have risen in its neighbourhood.

By car[edit]
If you want to go to Alcamo Marina there are two main roads from Alcamo: the Provincial Road 55 (SP55)  for the Canalotto-Calatubo areas, and the Provincial Road 47 (SP47 Scampati) which arrives at Magazzinazzi.  Besides, if you take the National Road 187 (SS187)  you can arrive from Balestrate or Castellammare del Golfo.
Owing to the length of this locality, it is a little difficult to reach the outskirts like Calatubo (on the east)  and contrada Magazzinazzi and Foggia where you can visit the ancient Roman Furnaces dated 100 BC (on the west side), so the best ways to travel long distances are by car, motorbike or bicycle.
There are a few parking areas: in Piazzale Canalotto, in Piazzale Battigia, near Castellammare railway station or along Via del Mare. They are going to open private parking areas in a short time and complete the cycle and pedestrian lanes along Via del Mare, next to the railway (on the west side). Every year from 15 June until the end of September there is a bus service connecting Alcamo with all the areas of Alcamo Marina.
