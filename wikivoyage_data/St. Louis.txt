The Gateway City of St. Louis is the epitome of the modern Midwestern metropolis. Missouri's second-largest city is vibrant but laid-back, populous but navigable, historic but still relevant. The city's planners have created an aesthetically beautiful city, with plenty of green space amidst buildings both old and new, framed by the majestic Mississippi and Missouri rivers. And capping it all is the world's tallest man-made monument, the beautiful and iconic Gateway Arch.
St. Louis is a city of culture and surprisingly inexpensive. Among American cities, only Washington, D.C. has more free attractions for tourists and residents alike. Hotels, restaurants, and even parking garages avoid the premium pricing common in other big cities. Although often overlooked, St. Louis can be an affordable, educational, and fun family getaway.


Understand[edit]
The city is named after King Louis IX of France, but is pronounced "Saint Lewis", not "Saint Louie". St. Louis is known by the nickname of The Gateway to the West. The city was the last major stop before pioneers journeyed westward to the Pacific coast. The city also played a large part during the steamboat era due to its position at the confluence of the Mississippi River and the Missouri River. St. Louis was acquired from France by the United States during President Thomas Jefferson's term in 1803 as part of the Louisiana Purchase. The transfer of power from Spain was made official in a ceremony called "Three Flags Day." On March 8, 1804, the Spanish flag was lowered and the French one raised. On March 10, the French flag was replaced by that of the USA. In 1904, St. Louis hosted that year's World's Fair and the Summer Olympic Games. Many of the parks, buildings, and finer homes in St. Louis were built around this time period. While the Fair has passed out of living memory, it holds an important place in the modern development of the city.
Before Detroit became America's automotive capital, St. Louis was the largest producer of American automobiles in the early part of the 20th century. Midtown and Downtown still have many of the original warehouses and factories standing, but most have been converted to other purposes, such as loft apartments, shops and restaurants. St. Louis was also home to a bustling fashion manufacturing industry in the early 1900s, centered on Washington Avenue downtown. As with the auto industry, the last remnants of the fashion manufacturing industry can be found in the  rehabilitated warehouses which contain new businesses and loft condominiums.  In the late 20th century, St. Louis began a transformation from a manufacturing and industrial economy into a globally known center for research in medicine, biotechnology, and other sciences. Firms such as Bayer, Centene, Solae, Energizer, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Edward Jones, Wells Fargo Advisors, Nestle Purina, and Anheuser-Busch/Inbev are headquartered in St. Louis. AT&T and Bank of America operate major regional offices here. Two major private research universities, Washington University in St. Louis and Saint Louis University, are an important part of the local economy and society.
St. Louis is truly a city of neighborhoods, each with its own distinct flavor and culture. There are 79 government-designated neighborhoods within the City of St. Louis, many of which have associations and councils that exercise wide control over development and subsidies from the highest to the very lowest local level. Some neighborhoods contain avenues of massive stone mansions built as palaces for heads of state visiting the 1904 World's Fair, and now occupied by some of the more wealthy families and individuals in the City of St. Louis. Other neighborhoods are predominantly middle class and working-class and have retained their singular cultural identity for 200 years. Today, most of them have endured as strong and cohesive communities for their residents

With neither mountains nor large bodies of water nearby to moderate the climate, St. Louis experiences extremes of temperatures at both ends of the scale. The Winter cold from December through March can be brutal to the unaccustomed body, as can the Summer heat from June through September. The Mississippi River makes this area humid, though temperatures are generally moderate. Storms can occur at any time of the year. July and August are hottest and most humid, and January and February are cold, with occasional snow. Normal temperatures range from 21°F in the winter to 90°F in the summer (-6°C to 32°C), but summer highs of 100°F and winter lows of 0°F are not uncommon (38°C and -18°C).

Neighborhoods[edit]
St. Louis is one of the more segregated cities in the nation, and is home to the country's first private gated street - Benton Place in Lafayette Square. In one minute you might be driving down tree-lined avenues with large houses, and the next minute you might be in a low-income neighborhood. Though the region is now more racially and economically integrated than it was, the road system still follows historic boundaries marking one area from the next. Hotels and most St. Louis guide books should have good maps of the layout of the neighborhoods of the City.
St. Louis City is separate from St. Louis County - the city is really a city without a county, with its own government, school system, and other services. St. Louis City has just under 294,000 residents while St. Louis County has just under one million residents. The entire St. Louis metropolitan region has approximately 3,000,000 residents.
Some of the more well-visited and larger neighborhoods in St. Louis City are:

Downtown St. Louis at night
Downtown - The Central Business District of St. Louis, downtown is nearing the end of a decade-long multi-billion dollar revitalization. Featuring professional sports stadiums, dozens of hotels, corporate headquarters, trendy dining and shopping, entertainment, nightlife, and the Gateway Arch, downtown St. Louis is now also home to tens of thousands of residents, many living in warehouses that have been converted to apartments and condominiums.
Laclede's Landing - Next to the Mississippi River, north of the Arch, this is one of the oldest standing neighborhoods of the city. A former industrial area, the Landing has original cobblestone streets, horse-drawn carriage rides in the evenings, live music, and restaurants and bars in converted industrial buildings.
Soulard - To the southwest of downtown lies St. Louis's oldest neighborhood. Today it is a perfect case study for traditional St. Louis red brick architecture, and also features the famous Soulard Farmers Market and many trendy restaurants.
Lafayette Square - Although some may group this with Soulard due to proximity, Lafayette Square features its own distinct architecture (Victorian and French Second Empire) and demographics. Surrounding the oldest park in St. Louis are tree-lined streets with rehabbed townhouses, some shopping and dining, and bed and breakfasts.
Old North St Louis - Just north of Downtown, the historic Old North neighborhood is in the midst of a dramatic revitalization that includes a significant number of historically rehabilitated brick, 19th Century structures; new businesses, such as Old North Grocery Co-op, Therapy Boutique, and La Mancha Coffeehouse; and a diverse community of residents, with a population that grew by 28% since 2000. The center of the neighborhood is at St. Louis Avenue & N. 14th Street, which is where the legendary Crown Candy Kitchen is found, along with the Crown Square, the $35 million redevelopment of the former 14th Street Pedestrian Mall.  Crown Square is also the site of the North City Farmers' Market, which in 2010 was identified as one of "America's Favorite Farmers' Markets," according to  American Farmland Trust.
Benton Park/Brewery - Just south of Soulard, Benton Park has come back from decades of disrepair. The area contains the Anheuser Busch Brewery and the old Lemp Brewery, in addition to a small eponymous park and working-class versions of the townhomes of Lafayette Square.
Forest Park Southeast -  Forest Park Southeast is at the beginning of a revitalization. Younger professionals have been attracted to the area due to the popular bars, and have since settled down and contributed to the area's infrastructure.
Grand Center/Midtown - West of Downtown down an area known as the Central Corridor (that includes Forest Park and the CWE), Grand Center is home to a booming performing arts, theatre, and museum district. St. Louis University is in this area.
Tower Grove/South Grand - A few miles south of Grand Center is Tower Grove Park, a 19th-century Victorian walking park. The nearby South Grand strip has a variety of shops, coffeehouses, bars, service businesses, and the area's largest concentration of Asian restaurants and shops. An ethnically diverse, gay-friendly area with an active street life and turn-of-the-century architecture.
Central West End - A very cosmopolitan neighborhood featuring stunning turn-of-the-century palace-like homes, upscale dining, and boutique shopping, the Central West End also contains an eclectic mix of antique shops, coffee houses, and art galleries. It's on the eastern edge of Forest Park, and includes the world-renowned Medical School of Washington University.
The Hill - St. Louis's Little Italy is home to a large number of locally renowned Italian restaurants, bakeries, and grocery stores. Its name is due to its proximity to the highest point of the city.
North St. Louis -  The historic African-American neighborhood known as "The Ville", and contains many historical sites relating to the history of Black Americans in the Midwest, including Sumner High School and  Homer G. Phillips Hospital.  This area extends north from Delmar Boulevard, and contains much of the industrial record of St. Louis and the migration of newcomers to the city.
Cherokee Street - A long-time shopping district, created from the convergence of two streetcar lines, this 12 block stretch of antique stores, cafés, restaurants and bars is divided by Jefferson Avenue. Cherokee Street runs from the antique and vintage stores, starting at what remains of the old Lemp Brewery warehouses, east of Jefferson. It crosses over to host 5 blocks of hipster/grunge bars, capped by the city’s most celebrated collection of Hispanic bakeries & taquerias. All of it centered on the Cinco de Mayo festival, each weekend around May 5th. It's also the city center for burlesque, with the Casa Loma Ballroom hosting the annual Show-me Burlesque Festival each June. This neighborhood is having a resurgence, becoming a destination for shopping, dining and entertainment, south of Benton Park/Brewery.

Category: Catenary
The Gateway Arch's shape is what's known as a catenary arch. It looks similar to a parabola, but you might know it as the shape created when a chain or string is suspended from two points. (That makes the Gateway Arch an inverted catenary, of course.) In particular, it's a specific catenary arch with a width exactly equal to its height (both 630 ft (190 m)).
Cross sections of the Arch are triangular, a trait readily visible from within the tram pods during the trip to the top. The arch is constructed of carbon steel, clad with stainless steel, on a concrete and carbon steel core. Its foundation is anchored 60 feet (18 m) underground.


Obviously, the Gateway Arch is a must-see attraction; even if you can't handle the ride to the top, you should at least gaze upward and ponder the arch's majesty. But St. Louis has plenty else to see, too, and several of the attractions offer free admission. (That doesn't mean parking is free, or that you can do everything within the attraction without extra charges... but still: free!)

38.5975-90.2122221 Anheuser-Busch Brewery, 1200 Lynch St, ☏ +1 314-577-2626. The place where all Anheuser-Busch beers are made for the mid-west U.S. Free tour, with free beer samples for those 21+, of one of the world's largest breweries and bottling factories, housed in beautiful red-brick buildings. The Clydesdale horses and their historic truck and stables are one of the biggest attractions on the tour, as are the brew house and packaging facility. The adjacent beer garden serves really good food and offers cheap samples of most Anheuser-Busch branded beer, from Goose Island to Hoegaarden.   
38.6425-90.25462 Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis, 4431 Lindell Blvd (at Newstead Ave in the Central West End neighborhood), ☏ +1 314-373-8200. 7AM-7PM. This Roman Catholic church contains the most mosaic art in one site in the world—83,000 square feet, installed by a family of artists who used more than 41 million tiles with more than 7,000 colors.   
38.62677-90.193753 Citygarden, 801 Market St (walk down Market Street five blocks from the Arch). Sunrise to 10PM. Citygarden gives kids fountains to play in and sculptures they can related to (Pinocchio, big heads, etc.); art lovers the chance to experience 24 sculptures by some of modern art's great masters (Leger, Herring, etc.); and everyone an award-winning garden in the midst of the city where you can relax and beat the heat. If you'd like to eat in the gardens, there is a cafe that is open for lunch or you can pick up something from the many takeout places nearby. Free.   (updated Sep 2016)
38.6336-90.20064 City Museum, 750 N 16th St, ☏ +1 314-231-2489. M-Th 9AM-5PM, F Sa 9AM-midnight, Su 11AM-5PM; closed M Tu in winter. For the young, the young at heart, or anyone who thinks a five-story playground made of salvaged materials sounds awesome. Don't let the name fool you; this place is a blast! The City Museum is a huge playground built in an old 11-story warehouse made largely out of architectural artifacts from around St. Louis collected by an eccentric millionaire. There are concessions inside the museum as well as bar service by local brewery Schlafy. While there are plenty of artifacts on display, it's not so much a museum as it is a collection of mazes, obstacle courses, tunnels, airplanes suspended in midair, and chutes and ladders. There's a Ferris wheel on the roof, a ten-story spiral slide, an enormous pipe organ, and lots of ways to get lost. Take care when parking; lots of nearby lots tout the "City Museum" on their signs, but only the one on the east side of 16th street (guarded by huge snake sculptures) is officially associated with the museum. Expect to stay here for 3-4 hours. $12+tax ($10+tax F-Sa after 5PM), under 2 free; roof access +$5 (weather permitting).   (updated Feb 2016)
38.6405-90.2355 Contemporary Art Museum, 3750 Washington Blvd (Near the hip 'loft district' downtown, in the Grand Center arts district), ☏ +1 314-535-4660. W Sa Su 10AM-5PM, Th F 10AM-8PM, M Tu closed. Shares a courtyard with the Pulitzer Foundation for the Arts. Free.   (updated May 2015)
38.628056-90.1713896 Eads Bridge. This bridge was the first to cross the Mississippi at St. Louis, the first primarily steel structure in the world, and the longest bridge in the world at completion in 1874. This overlooked landmark is worth checking out for the Eiffel Tower-like steel lattice that still holds up cars and the MetroLink to this day. It connects to Washington Avenue, and is directly adjacent to Laclede's Landing, both are centers of St. Louis nightlife. The easiest way to access Eads Bridge is via the Laclede's Landing MetroLink stop. Well worth a walk across as one of the best places to see the sun setting with the Gateway Arch and city providing a very artistic view of the area.   
38.638889-90.2847227 Forest Park. One of the nation's largest city parks, with 1,293 acres, is open to the public for golf, tennis, baseball, bicycling, boating, fishing, handball, ice skating, in-line skating, jogging, cricket, rugby and more. The park is also home to the St. Louis Science Center, the art museum, the zoo, and a history museum, all with free admission. Forest Park is really at the heart of St. Louis. It was also the site of the 1904 Louisiana Purchase World's Fair, which lays claim to serving the first hot dogs, hamburgers, and ice cream cones. You cannot visit St. Louis without hearing about, driving by, or exploring Forest Park.   
38.6452-90.28598 Missouri History Museum, 5700 Lindell Blvd, ☏ +1 314-746-4599. W-M 10AM-5PM, Tu 10AM-8PM. Check out the Charles Lindbergh exhibit and see a life size replica of the original Spirit of St. Louis. Free.   (updated May 2015)
38.639444-90.2944449 Saint Louis Art Museum (SLAM), 1 Fine Arts Dr, ☏ +1 314-721-0072. Tu–Th Sa Su 10AM–5PM, F 10AM-9PM. It's in Forest Park atop a large lake and hill, and is one of the leading comprehensive art museums in the nation. It hosts visiting displays which in the past have included such exhibits as the Angels of the Vatican and the Royal Tombs of Ur. Free.   (updated May 2015)
38.6289-90.270810 Saint Louis Science Center (SLSC), 5050 Oakland Ave, ☏ +1 314-289-4400. M-Sa 9:30AM-4:30PM, Su 11AM-4:30PM. A fun, hands-on science museum. Equipped with an IMAX Dome theater, a planetarium, floors of interactive activities, and several traveling exhibits, the Science Center has something for everyone (though the majority is geared solidly toward the under-12 set; older teens and adults will find the exhibits somewhat elementary). The museum is actually just south of Forest Park; the planetarium, however, is within the park itself, and an enclosed walkway above I-64 connects the two. Base admission is free; parking $10; extra fee for planetarium, IMAX shows, and special exhibits.   (updated Aug 2015)
38.6355-90.290511 Saint Louis Zoo, 1 Government Dr, ☏ +1 314-781-0900. 9AM-5PM daily. Recognized as one of the top five zoos in the nation. The zoo has both indoor and outdoor exhibits. There are several centers for in depth exploration and learning. Free; fees charged for certain attractions.   (updated May 2015)
38.6246-90.18512 Gateway Arch National Park (along the Mississippi River facing downtown St. Louis), ☏ +1 314-655-1700. A large park with plenty of big lawns, wooded areas, and a few ponds. The park and the nearby parking garage are closed for renovation; however, the arch remains open.   (updated Apr 2018)
38.6245-90.184713 Gateway Arch, toll-free: +1-877-982-1410. Summer: 8AM-10PM daily; fall, winter, spring: 9AM-6PM daily (last tram 1 hr before closing). Designed by Eero Saarinen, this is the world's tallest national monument, built to be a symbolic gateway to the West. The icon of the city, the Arch is right on the bank of the Mississippi and offers an inspiring sight to travelers coming in from Illinois. There's a gift shop and a confectionery, as well as an inspiring film called "Monument to the Dream," about the building of the Arch; it is an exceptionally well-made and memorable tribute to how a vision was made tangible. But the main attraction is the Journey to the Top; you'll ride a unique tram/elevator—essentially a cross between a cable railway and a ferris wheel—up either the north or south leg to the top of the arch, where you can see for dozens of miles into Illinois and Missouri. The cars are very small; they hold five very close friends or relatives each, and are not suitable for the claustrophobic. Tickets sell out during peak season; expect a long wait on major summer holidays to go to the top. Entry only (incl film): adults $3, under 16 free; Journey to the Top (incl entry and film): adults $10, ages 3-15 $5.   (updated Aug 2015)
38.6258-90.189314 Old Courthouse. The site of the historic Dred Scott slavery case which was one of the seeds of the Civil War. While the Park is under construction, you can buy tickets to the arch here. The Courthouse also holds exhibits from the now-closed Museum of Westward Expansion, which used to be underneath the Arch. Free.   
38.6241-90.187215 Old Cathedral (Basilica of Saint Louis, King of France), 209 Walnut St, ☏ +1 314-231-3250. The first cathedral built west of the Mississippi River (1834), this is the only building that was spared when the park was constructed. It's still an active Roman Catholic basilica.   
38.6472-90.302716 Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum, 1 Brookings Dr (Skinker Blvd and Forsyth Blvd, on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis), ☏ +1 314-935-4523. W-M 11AM-5PM, Tu closed; 11AM-8PM first F of the month. It has been voted the best museum in St. Louis by the Riverfront Times. One of the world's finest university art collections, it is also the oldest art museum west of the Mississippi River - it was founded in 1881. It is now housed in a new facility designed by Pritzker Prize winning architect, Fumihiko Maki. Among the permanent collection are pieces by Pablo Piccasso, Rembrandt, Max Ernst, Jackson Pollock, Robert Rauschenberg, Juan Gris, Alexander Calder, and a separate department dedicated to currency called the Newman Money Museum.

Stroll the grounds, explore the home gardening resources, or enjoy one of the many events throughout the year. This is a "must see." One of the main features is the Climatron, a very large geodesic dome that houses a good portion of the Garden's 80 acres of horticultural offerings. 2006 featured hundreds of glass sculptures around the park by glass artist Chihuly. $8; children 12 and under free.   (updated May 2015)
38.6404-90.234418 Pulitzer Foundation for the Arts, 3716 Washington Blvd, ☏ +1 314-754-1850. W Sa 10AM-5PM, Th F 10AM-8PM. Experience modern art in a stunning avant-garde structure. A permanent installation titled Joe by Richard Serra is large enough for visitors to walk through and experience first-hand.

The theatre is much-visited by local elementary schools, and you can arrange to tag along with a group or schedule your own trip. This expanded museum replaces the previous Delta Dental Health Theatre Museum.

One of the more lively neighborhoods in St. Louis that borders Forest Park, the CWE is a great destination for a day of walking around or a weekend stay. 
38.63037-90.184214 Laclede's Landing. Just north of the Arch and part of Downtown St Louis, and the second oldest neighborhood after Soulard, "the Landing" is what amounts to St. Louis' old town. You are likely to enjoy the cobblestone streets and the shops, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and a bizarre wax museum. Next to the Landing is a $400 million casino complex called Lumiere Place, featuring a Four Seasons hotel, nightclubs, 75,000 square feet of casino gaming, and an innovative multi-colored light feature spanning 24 vertical floors on the exterior of the building that lights up St. Louis' skyline. Not many original buildings on the Landing remain, as the area is constantly undergoing new developments and rehabilatation of older buildings. Nightly horse-drawn carriage rides take you around the Landing and much of Downtown.   
38.61073-90.200925 Soulard Market, 730 Carroll St. Although strangely named ("un soulard " means "a drunk" in French.), the Soulard neighborhood, covering the waterfront for several miles south of the Arch, is the oldest in St. Louis. The Georgian (or should that be Louis XVI?) style houses surround a central farmer's market which supplies the city's residents, supermarkets, and restaurants with the freshest, and inexpensive, local produce. This is the oldest farmer's market west of the Mississippi, and is open year-round every weekend. There are a number of bars and restaurants in the neighborhood as well, and visitors can celebrate French heritage with the locals during Mardi Gras or on Bastille Day.   
38.6559-90.303816 The Delmar Loop. Delmar Blvd. straddles the city limits and University City. This street was named in 2007 by the American Planning Association as one of the 10 Great Streets in America. This is the area known as The Loop to most locals, however, usage of the term outside of the St. Louis area is not as popular due to more famous Chicago loop. Rock and roll legend Chuck Berry performed every month at the historic Blueberry Hill restaurant until late 2014. Although most popular with the 20-something hipster crowd, something can be found for everyone. Boutique shopping, ethnic restaurants (including many Thai establishments), upscale dining, independent movie theatres, record stores, nightlife opportunities, a few music concert venues, and people watching are among the many things to do on the Loop. Many restaurants feature outdoor dining to take in the bustling street scene.

Twice yearly are walking tours of the area that will take you inside some of the more remarkable Victorian mansions.

Festivals and events[edit]

Provel cheese, please
As you're gazing at a restaurant menu in St. Louis, you're likely to notice "Provel" listed as a topping choice for burgers or pizza, or as an ingredient in other dishes. It's not just a weird local abbreviation for provolone!
Provel is actually a processed cheese blend of provolone, Swiss, and cheddar cheeses, and St. Louisans put it on everything. Well, maybe not everything, but anyplace you'd expect to find provolone, or Swiss, or even mozzarella, you're likely to instead see Provel.
Provel cheese is, in fact, a key component of St. Louis-style pizza, which by default consists of a cracker-thin unleavened crust, with heavily oreganoed pizza sauce and plenty of Provel on top.

Drink[edit]
Most tourists will be familiar with St. Louis' world famous Anheuser-Busch brewery, especially its signature variety Budweiser, or their best-seller Bud Light.  However, unless you are accustomed to American style pilsners, it is unlikely you will find these and other Anheuser-Busch brands suit your palate.  For those more familiar with European brews or who have been caught up in the domestic craft brewery explosion interested in sampling a local brewery's product, the Saint Louis Brewery's Schlafly craft brews are more likely to satisfy.  Schlfaly is the largest craft brewery in St. Louis but not the only one.  4Hands, Civil Life, Urban Chestnut, Square One, Perennial Artisan Ales, and O'Fallon Brewery are just a few of the other breweries in town.  They are definitely worth a look.
If you would rather explore rather than choose one specific establishment, two areas in St. Louis are great for wandering from location to location: The Central West End (featuring Sub-Zero Vodka Bar, the Drunken Fish, Tom's Bar, the Loading Zone, Mandarin Lounge, and Bissinger's Chocolate Lounge all off Euclid Ave), and Downtown centered around Washington Ave (featuring Kyo, Home, Pepper Lounge, Lucas Park Grille, Plush, Nectar, and rue13). St. Louis's MetroLink system is great if you prefer not to drive, but much of the line will stop running by 1AM.
St. Louis is also home to a number of gay and lesbian friendly nightlife options. From busy bars to energetic dance clubs, make sure to stop by rBar, Atomic Cowboy, Novak's, and the Complex. Much of these are on Manchester Rd in Forest Park Southeast.

Sleep[edit]
St. Louis does have the host of usual Marriott, Hilton, Holiday Inn and similar chains. Check out chain websites for exact locations throughout the metropolitan region. One great thing about the city is an abundance of hotel rooms, convention and meeting space, and amenities for travelers. Since the city has a low cost of living, even for the Midwest, you might find even the most expensive hotels relatively affordable; rooms at even the Ritz-Carlton start in the mid $200s per night.

Stay safe[edit]
Crime[edit]
St. Louis' designation as the "most dangerous city in America" should not deter the potential visitor. In reality St. Louis is just as safe as any other Midwestern city - that is to say, extremely safe in suburbs and wealthy neighborhoods, and quite dangerous in inner-city slums. The statistical discrepancy is because, unlike most cities, St Louis' municipal boundaries include mostly slums and very few suburb-like areas. The areas of the city proper that are most often visited by tourists, such as Downtown, the Central West End, and Forest Park, have quite low crime rates.
The northern suburb of Ferguson, Missouri gained widespread media attention in 2014 for riots against police brutality, but these are no longer ongoing.
Some economically depressed North County suburbs like Wellston, Pagedale and parts of Normandy and Jennings, as well as many parts of North St. Louis city are unsafe. The post-war exodus to the suburbs has taken a huge economic toll on these areas, leaving many buildings abandoned, decaying, or demolished. East St. Louis, in Illinois, is also noted for its high crime rate (this is not true of Alton or Belleville, in Illinois to the north and south). When in the city, a general guideline (though politically incorrect and somewhat simplistic) is that areas north of Delmar Blvd are unsafe, and should be entirely avoided after dark. Most tourists, however, will have little reason to visit any of these places, so it should not present reason for much concern.
Some Metrolink stations are in areas some may find questionable after dark as well. But most downtown areas around Busch Stadium, and Union Station, as well as the St. Louis University area and commuter lots near the airport, are generally safe and patrolled.

Natural disasters[edit]
St. Louis sits on a fault line, whose last big earthquake changed the course of the Mississippi River. Another earthquake still remains a possibility today—albeit a remote one, according to most scientists.
St. Louis gets a lot of urban tornadoes, so make sure you understand tornado safety precautions.

Nearby[edit]
Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site is just across the river in Illinois. It is the site of the largest pre-Columbian city north of Mexico, with an estimated population of 10-20,000 people at its peak. It is a UNESCO World Heritage site. The top of the "Monk's Mound" offers amazing views of the city and the arch and the free museum is very well done and gives great insights into how the people of what is now America lived 1,000 years ago. It is hard, although possible, to reach the site via public transportation, but it is a $25 Uber ride from downtown.
The Katy Trail State Bike Trail. The Katy Trail is a bike path built where a Kansas-Missouri-Texas railroad line formerly ran. It's over 200 miles long, and biking on a section (or the whole thing) and stopping on the small towns dotting the tree-lined trail is a worthwhile excursion. Great place for bikers, runners, and those who want to experience small town Missouri and the great outdoors.

(updated Apr 2022)
Further afield[edit]
Alton is a historic river town just across the Mississippi River from St. Louis. Enjoy wineries, winter eagle watching, 50 antique shops, 9 golf courses, historic sites, fine dining, and elegant bed and breakfast accommodations. For a scenic day trip, take the Great River Road north from Alton to Grafton, Illinois, stopping for antique shops and then on to lunch at the Père Marquette Lodge in Père Marquette State Park. This drive is especially beautiful in the fall months, but in the winter you can see a number of bald eagles roosting along the river bluffs.
St. Charles - nearby and makes a nice day trip.
Jefferson City - Take a short trip to the state capital!
Troy - only a short ride away.
