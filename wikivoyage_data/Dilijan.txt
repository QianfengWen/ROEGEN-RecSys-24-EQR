Sharambeyan Street, Old Town Dilijan
Dilijan is a town with mild climate and fresh air to the northeast of Yerevan. It is famous for its lovely surroundings, called the "Armenian Switzerland" by the locals, due to the densely forested valleys and mountains with alpine meadows surrounding them. It is an excellent base for hiking.
Most visitors to Armenia spend all of their nights in Yerevan. Spending a night or two in Dilijan while exploring Tavush Marz region is well worth it. There are plentiful accommodations in Dilijan, from the luxury of the Tufenkian Hotel to much more basic hotels or homes. From Dilijan you can explore up to the Georgian border and the remote Shamshadin region much more easily than from Yerevan, and then continue on to Lori Marz.


Understand[edit]
The first settlements in this area were established around the end of the second millennium and beginning of first millennium BC. Some excavated collections of artifacts from that period are exhibited in the museums of Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Tbilisi, Baku and Yerevan, with the reminder kept in the Dilijan Geological Museum.
During the Medieval period this territory belonged to the Arsacid kings and was one of their favourite forest and a summer resorts used for hunting. A bit later, in the 13th century, Bujur Dili settlement was founded here. The monasteries of Haghartsin and Goshavank were built between the 10th and 13th centuries, quickly developed and have served as cultural and educational centers in the intervening centuries. Some other important religious and educational centers have also survived in Dilijan, such as the Jukhtak Vank Monastery and Matosavank Monastery.
Since the town came under Russian rule in 1801, the population has gradually grown. A school, library and several theaters were opened. In the second half of the 19th century Dilijan’s fame as of a resort center started to grow.
During Soviet years it was already widely known as a mountain climatic and balneological resort; there used to be 35 major sanatoriums hosting tens of thousands people yearly. It was popular among creative people, musicians and painters. However, all its fame faded away quite quickly after the collapse of Soviet Union, the number of tourists fell dramatically, and sanatoriums and all other tourist-oriented infrastructure went into a serious decline. The situation has started to improve. Tourists (mainly wealthy Armenians and some foreigners as well) have started coming back, giving a fresh breath to the town. New hotels and restaurants have started to appear again. There are still many signs of decline; there is a feel of abandonment and some provincial neglect (which is somehow inherent to the majority of Armenian towns). Nonetheless, pristine nature, calm and relaxed atmosphere and ancient monasteries are still the main points of interest and the main reasons to visit the town.

40.73926944.8625121 Tourist Information Office, Tsaturyan Street. It is a resource for valuable advice, maps and souvenirs. They can also find guides who can accompany visitors on their trips to Dilijan National Park. There is Wi-Fi in the office, computers for visitors and a small adjacent bistro serving coffee, snacks and beer. (updated Nov 2019)

Get around[edit]
40°44′35″N 44°54′0″EMap of Dilijan
On foot[edit]
Within town, for the most part, walking is quite easy.

By bus[edit]
There are 2 bus routes starting at the mineral water plant factory (which is a starting point for hikes to Jukhtak Vank Monastery) and then crossing entire town and ending at another end of it.
Operation time: M-F 07:30-18:30, Sa Su 09:30-17:30, about every ½ hr.

By taxi[edit]
A taxi within the town should cost no more than 600 dram.
If you need to get to some of the regional monasteries, your best bet is negotiating a package deal with the taxis. You can ask someone from the tourist information office help you translate and negotiate, as most of the drivers will not speak English. If a driver tries to change the price on you, absolutely refuse, and take the matter to the police if necessary. Don't trust any taxi driver.

By bicycle[edit]
Bikes can be rented either at the Dilijan National Park's information center (at park's HQ 500 m past Dilijan roundabout, 1,000 dram/hr or 5,000 dram/day) or at the "Old Dilijan" historic center.
