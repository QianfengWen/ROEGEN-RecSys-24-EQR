Not to be confused with Mafra, Portugal.

Maffra is a small agricultural town in Gippsland, Victoria with a rich local history and heritage.


Understand[edit]
Historically, the sugar beet industry in the town has been highly profitable, beginning in the 1890s and winding up after World War 2. The town was also connected to the state's rail network, however railway services ended in the 1990s, with the railway line being replaced with the Gippsland Plains Rail Trail.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The easiest way to get into Maffra is by car. All 4 roads leading into Maffra are named for Maffra. From Stratford, the Stratford-Maffra Road (C105) is an easy 5-10 minute journey. The Sale route is similarly straightforward, taking 15 minutes using the Sale-Maffra Road (C492). If you're travelling from Briagolong, the Maffra-Briagolong Road (C493) takes about the same amount of time. From Traralgon, the Traralgon-Maffra Road (C105) is a longer 1 hour journey that goes through towns such as Glengarry, Heyfield and Tinamba.
If you're travelling from Melbourne,  it's a question of whether you want to stay on the Princes Highway. If you don't, you can turn off at Traralgon, otherwise follow it to Sale and then turn off towards Maffra. However, if you're travelling in a western direction from, say, Bairnsdale or Lakes Entrance, the best option is to use the Stratford-Maffra Road.

By coach[edit]
V/Line operates coach services to Maffra from Traralgon to Maffra 7 days a week, with Sale to Maffra services available once a day from Monday to Friday. These are supplemented by train services V/Line operates from Melbourne to Traralgon and Sale. While train services terminating in Traralgon use Myki cards, all coach services and train services to Sale require paper tickets, which can be purchased at Southern Cross, Traralgon and Sale train stations, though oddly enough they can't be purchased in Maffra. A full timetable is available here.
