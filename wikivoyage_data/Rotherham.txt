Rotherham is a large town in South Yorkshire, Its traditional industries were coal-mining, glass-blowing and steel-making: much of this gone, but Rotherham is still a big steel producer, albeit more focused on specialist engineering steel rather than mass production. In 2011 the population was 109,691.
Rotherham Visitor Centre is at 26 High Street, within Makers Emporium Gift Shop opposite the Minster. It's open Tu-Sa 9AM-4PM.


Understand[edit]
"Rother" is Old English for "chief river", roduβr, but those Old English can't have travelled very far, since the River Rother is merely a tributary of the Don, which in turn joins the Trent / Ouse tidal system and then the broad Humber. It wasn't navigable but had water enough to power mills and supply industry, which drove Rotherham's 18th-century growth from a small market town into a busy, grubby city. Iron and steel was the main industry, using local iron ore fired by coal from the rich Barnsley seam. The coal was suitable for making coke, used for the very high temperatures for quality steel and for glass-making. The Templeborough steelworks in its Edwardian heyday was over a mile long, employed 10,000 workers, and produced 1.8 million tonnes of steel a year. But many of the manufacturers succumbed to foreign competition: Templeborough closed in 1993 and is now the site of Magna Science Adventure Centre. There's still a strip of steelworks along A630 northeast edge of town. 
Famous people from Rotherham include goalkeeper David Seaman (b 1963), football referee Howard Webb (b 1971), TV presenter James May (b 1963) and politician William Hague (b 1961). Those from elsewhere who got their career start in Rotherham include actor Sean Bean (b 1959) and TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson (b 1960).
