Naoshima (直島) is an island and town in the Seto Inland Sea of Japan. Although the island is much closer to the main Japanese island of Honshu, administratively it belongs to Kagawa Prefecture in Shikoku.


Understand[edit]
Naoshima is famous for its contemporary art museums as well as outdoor contemporary art installations throughout the island. It has a population of approximately 3,000 people.
Avoid visiting the island on Mondays, as most of the museums will be closed.

History[edit]
The first settlement on the island was at the now-diminutive fishing port of Tsumuura on the southeastern tip of the island. The most prominent settlement on the island was Honmura which was established as a coastal castle town during the warring states period (1467–1568). The main industry is a smelter and refinery operated by Mitsubishi Materials.

Tourist information site[edit]
The local tourist association has a bilingual guide site.

Miyanoura port to Honmura (Art House Project): about 30 minutes.
