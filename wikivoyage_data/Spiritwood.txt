Spiritwood is a small town in Saskatchewan, Canada with approximately 900 people (2011).


Understand[edit]
Spiritwood is the largest community in the region, and functions as the major supply, service, and administrative headquarters for the trading area population which includes several First Nation (Aboriginal) reserves including Witchekan Lake, Big River and Pelican Lake.
Mixed farming predominates and consists primarily of grain production. A Spiritwood company with global connections that focuses on pig genetics, producing breeding stock and commercial swine, has roughly 50 employees. There is some forestry in the region north of Spiritwood.

History[edit]
The district began to be settled around 1911–12; however, growth in the area was slow until the coming of the railway in the late 1920s. The first settlers primarily engaged in ranching. The Spiritwood post office, which had been established in 1923, was named after Spiritwood Lake, North Dakota, the hometown of the first postmaster, Rupert J. Dumond. After the railway arrived, settlers of diverse origins poured into the district and many businesses were established.
It was the scene of the two deaths of RCMP officers in 2006, where after a 12-day manhunt, the suspect surrendered without incident.
