0.4206333.197531 Source of the Nile (Behind the golf course). There is a small monument in the area dedicated to Gandhi. Some of his ashes were released here. Although the experience of going here is not that interesting, it may be worth it for the sole reason that you can go home and tell everyone that you visited the source of the longest river in the world. But then again, you may just have a look at the water anywhere outside of the park for free. USh 30000 for non-residents. (updated May 2023)
 Swaminarayan Temple. 
The Jinja market is in the very centre of town, and consists of multiple acres of colourful shacks squeezed on top of each other selling everything from chicken hearts to motor parts. Definitely a must-see, even if you're in Jinja for one day.
The easiest and best way to see the town is to flag down the nearest boda boda driver (motorcycle which takes passengers) and ask him for a tour. Pay no more than USh 6000 however, for less than an hour tour.

Do[edit]

Buy[edit]
Uganda is not a terribly touristy country. Jinja is one of the only places that sells 'African souvenirs'. A day of shopping is best started by the Source Café and the surrounding streets. It is possible to buy drums, Ugandan guitars, paintings, and many other things ideal as gifts. Remember that -- apart from a few locations in Kampala -- you are unlikely to find shops like this elsewhere in Uganda.
Tourist shops also sprung up around the NRE camp in Bujagali, but they'll be a little more expensive than in Jinja.

Bujagali is a ten minute boda boda ride out from Jinja. It's a small tourist village, based on picturesque Bujagali Falls. Witness the locals swimming down the falls with nothing but a jerry can keeping them safe, as well as the odd rafter or kayaker who's made a mistake. Soft Power Health and the Allen stone charities work from Bujagali, and it's very popular with volunteers.
