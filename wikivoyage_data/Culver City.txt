Culver City is a city on the Westside of Los Angeles County. It was given the moniker the "Heart of Screenland" during the 1930s and 1940s when it was responsible for half of America's motion picture production; today it remains home to Sony Pictures Studios (formerly MGM Studios) and Culver Studios.  In addition to its role in the film and television industry the city has a reputation as a great food destination due to the huge number of trendy restaurants found in the downtown and elsewhere.


Understand[edit]
Culver City has a history in the film industry that goes back to the 1920s.
Harry Culver, a real estate developer, founded the city as a sundown town in 1913.  Located along the roads and rail line that connected the beach resort city of Venice with downtown Los Angeles, the town grew fairly quickly.  Culver attracted migrants from the Midwest by offering homes that included furniture and even appliances in exchange for a monthly mortgage payment.
In the 1920s the film industry arrived, with silent film comedy producer Hal Roach and Metro Goldwyn Mayer (MGM) building studios. From the 1930s through the 1940s Culver City was home to half of America's motion picture production and was dubbed the "Heart of Screenland", and MGM was the largest of the major film studios from the 1930s to the early 1950s.  Today entertainment companies that call Culver City home include Sony Pictures Studios (formerly MGM), Culver Studios (formerly RKO-Pathé Studios, and future home of Amazon Studios), National Public Radio's "NPR West" facility, the NFL Network, and a handful of smaller media companies.  In 2021 HBO will move its West Coast headquarters to Culver City, followed in 2022 by the opening of a new facility housing 1,000 employees working on Apple's entertainment offerings.
Movies that have been produced in Culver City include classics such as Citizen Kane, the original King Kong, and Gone With the Wind.  The Wizard of Oz was filmed at MGM studios, and part of the original yellow brick road is still inside the lot on Stage 27 of Sony Pictures Studios.  In addition to being the home of classic films, the television show I Love Lucy was produced at Desilu Studios.  More recent productions include Grease, Raging Bull, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, City Slickers, Men in Black, Air Force One and Spider-Man. In addition to I Love Lucy, television shows made on Culver City sets include Lassie, Batman, The Andy Griffith Show, Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune.
The city has other ties to the entertainment industry beyond the movies and television shows created at its studios.  The iconic Culver Hotel was once owned by Charlie Chaplin and was later sold to John Wayne, allegedly for the price of $1 after a high-stakes poker game.  The town's streets also reflect Culver City's entertainment history, with names such as (Mary) Pickford and (Douglas) Fairbanks.
Culver City was in a state of decline in the 1990s, but since that time has undergone a tremendous revival.  The downtown area is now a bustling district that is home to dozens of restaurants and multiple theaters, while other districts throughout the city are gaining reputations for the culinary and artistic businesses that have set up shop.

Despite having two movie studios and several television production facilities within the city limits, the only public tour is at Sony Studios, which offers a tour rather than a theme park attraction like Universal City. In addition, a handful of museums are scattered throughout the city, each one small and focused on a particular subject - those looking for large museums geared towards a general audience might want to take the Expo line to Exposition Park, but those with special interests will find Culver City's offerings to be excellent. Two highlights include the Wende Museum, which is highly regarded for its Cold War collection, and the Museum of Jurassic Technology, which has somewhat of a cult following for its general weirdness and for its willingness to mix truth and fiction.

This museum is a truly unique experience, as it is an artistic mixture of fact and fiction, featuring weird and wonderful displays of things that never happened, next to strange but true practices of bygone years; it can be hard to distinguish between the two, and it's best not to try. Exhibits include micro-sculptures that fit within the eye of a needle, portraits of the canine astronauts of the early Soviet space program, and artwork made from the scales of butterfly wings that can be viewed under microscopes. An enjoyable afternoon's visit and a tribute to the weirdness of the world.

The bike path runs along Ballona Creek from the back of the sports fields in Syd Kronenthal Park on McManus Street in Culver City all the way to the ocean, where it then joins the Coast Bike Path along the beach. While some wildlife and plant life is present along the route, the creek itself was lined with concrete by the Army Corps of Engineers after the Flood of 1938. In addition to the access from either end of the path, the bike path can also be accessed at most major intersections where the road passes over the creek. During heavy rains access points will be locked as the area can quickly become unsafe, with the creek rising and submerging portions of the path under fast-moving water.

34.00359-118.408518 Pho Show, 4349 Sepulveda Blvd, ☏ +1-310-398-5200. M-Sa 11AM–3PM, 5PM-2AM. Su 11AM-3PM, 5PM-10PM. Founded by three techies who wanted to be able to eat pho at a local restaurant, Pho Show serves the Vietnamese rice noodle soup to a crowded house. The soup that gives the restaurant its name is delicious, with a particularly aromatic broth that is different from other pho restaurants, and portions are generous. For those who chose this restaurant but for some reason decided against the soup, there are numerous rice, noodle and curry dishes on the menu. Beer and wine is available for dine-in customers. $7-15. 
34.02318-118.394949 Tender Greens, 9523 Culver Blvd (downtown), ☏ +1-310-842-8300. Su-Th 11:30AM-9PM, F-Sa 11:30AM-10PM. As you might guess, the emphasis here is on the fresh salads of all types, but you can get them small, meal-sized or pair them with steak, chicken or fish. This popular chain uses local, organic produce to assemble fresh and healthy salads and soups, as well as delectable hot dishes from the grill, such as free-range chicken, Angus flatiron steak, and line-caught tuna. This eco-conscious restaurant also uses biodegradable to-go containers, reclaimed timber, and non-toxic cleaners. The atmosphere is relaxed and beautiful, with a spacious patio for outdoor dining. Portions are large, and a wide array of boutique wines and microbrews will please any palate. Friendly service. $10 and up. (updated Feb 2016)
34.02458-118.3958410 Ugo, 3865 Cardiff Ave (downtown Culver City across the street from the movie theatre), ☏ +1-310-204-1222. M-Th 11AM-11PM, F 11AM-midnight, Sa 10AM-midnight, Su 10AM-11PM. A cozy Italian cafe with extensive outdoor seating and a reasonably-authentic Italian menu. This establishment specializes in Italian cafe food, so expect sandwiches, carpacchio, insalata, pasta, and gelato rather than the standard "spaghetti and steaks" fare common at most Italian restaurants. $10-30. (updated Mar 2015)
Splurge[edit]
34.02314-118.3948911 Akasha Restaurant, 9543 Culver Blvd (Corner of Culver and Watseka), ☏ +1-310-845-1700. Opened in 2008, Akasha features New American food, meaning that everything is delicious, organic, seasonal and local. You'll never feel trendier but welcomed. Good for dates and business meetings. There is also a well-stocked bar. Happy hour is daily from 2:30-7PM and features significant discounts on drinks and appetizers. Bonus trivia: the owner, Akasha Richmond, has been the personal chef to pop star Michael Jackson and actors Barbara Streisand and Billy Bob Thorton. $15-35. (updated Mar 2015)
34.02517-118.3931412 K-Zo, 9240 Culver Blvd (downtown), ☏ +1-310-202-8890. Lunch: M-F 11:45AM-2:30PM; Dinner: M-Th 5:30PM-10:30PM, F-Sa 5:30PM-11PM, Su 5PM-10PM. Another restaurant born of Culver City's downtown renaissance, K-Zo is a sushi bar and "Japanese tapas" restaurant, offering various hot and cold bites in addition to the more standard Japanese fare.

For those seeking to maximize their eating dollar, happy hour is daily from 5:30-7PM. $6-15 for most sushi rolls and tapas items. (updated Jan 2016)
34.024204-118.3816613 Vespertine, 3599 Hayden Ave, ☏ +1 323-320-4023. Named one of Time Magazine's "100 Greatest Places" in 2018 and given two stars by the Michelin Guide in 2020, this establishment bills itself as an experimental restaurant that aims to surprise visitors with a truly unique eating experience. Guests will first notice the building's unique architecture and artistic decor, with meals starting with a cocktail on the roof before diners are led into the austere dining area for multiple courses that can last for hours. Food is locally sourced, contemporary style dishes that hint of French cooking, and the presentation of each dish is unique to the point of becoming a focal point of the dining experience. Reservations are a must and need to be made well in advance. $75-150. (updated Jun 2020)
Drink[edit]
Bars[edit]
Most of the downtown restaurants also have a lively bar scene. Other bars located throughout the city include:

33.99707-118.426121 The Alibi Room, 12236 W Washington Blvd (1 block east of Centinela), ☏ +1-310-390-9300. Open nightly 5:30PM-2AM. Food served M-Sa 5:30PM-midnight, food truck Sundays 5:30PM-midnight. Happy hour Sa-W 11PM-2AM. This lounge is most famous for chef Roy Choi's Kogi Korean barbecue tacos ($7 for three), but also offers a unique selection of cocktails including the Cuban Mistress (rum, hibiscus, strawberry, rhubarb bitters, lemon, ginger beer) or the Breaking Bad (tequila, Del Maguey Vida Mezcal, pear, fresh lemon, serrano chile infused agave). All food is ordered directly from the bar and brought to you based on the oversized playing card you'll receive after paying. The vibe is upscale hipster, with a younger, affluent crowd. It gets extremely full and very noisy as the evening goes on, so consider an early arrival if you want a cushy lounge seat and the chance to talk to your dining companions without yelling. (updated May 2015)
34.01633-118.400262 Backstage, 10400 Culver Blvd (near Culver and Overland at the intersection with Motor), ☏ +1-310-839-3892. Proudly advertising itself as "the best dive bar in the world" Backstage offers a high-energy atmosphere with a really fun crowd. Expect a packed house on weekends and call ahead to reserve a table if you don't want to be standing. Drinks are reasonably priced ($4 for a draft beer), the staff is extraordinarily friendly, and there is karaoke (Thursday - Saturday), pool, darts, and decent bar food to help keep the evening entertaining. 
34.01544-118.407083 Blind Barber, 10797 W Washington Blvd (behind Best Buy), ☏ +1-310-841-6679. Bar: M-Sa 6PM-2AM, Su closed; Barbershop: M-Sa noon-9PM, Su noon-6PM. If you didn't know it was here, you'd never find this great hangout. The front is a working barbershop with a nondescript door in the middle of the back wall. Walk through that door and you're in a bar with a roaring-twenties theme. The cigarette dispenser by the bathroom sells hair product, the fans are operated on pulley systems, and a free drink is offered with every barber service. Cocktails are fancy and made by bar tenders who double as waitstaff. Snacks include numerous varieties of grilled cheese and upscale bar munchies like sloppy joe sliders or imported olives. Cocktails $10+, Beers $5+. 
33.997-118.43074 Corner Door, 12477 W Washington Blvd, ☏ +1-310-313-5810. Su-Th 5PM-midnight, F Sa 5PM-2AM. When it first opened in 2012 Corner Door made fried brussel sprouts famous, but their other food items are equally well done if a bit on the pricey side. What they are best known for, however, are the upscale cocktails - Beau du Bois, the bartender who has been at Corner Door since its opening, was named "2014 LA Bartender of the Year" by Eater LA and can fashion a drink for any taste. Be warned that the interior gets loud when it fills up, so arrive early or sit on the patio if you want to be able to hear the person next to you. Daily happy hour from 5PM-7PM features $7 cocktails, $3-$5 beers, and $5 wine, as well as $5-$9 snacks. Sunday night is "Burger R&D" night, featuring the weekly burger, fries and beer for $15, and $5 old fashioned cocktails. (updated May 2015)
34.03038-118.384665 Father's Office 2.0, 3229 Helms Ave (in the Helm's Bakery complex). This upscale pub is famous for its burger, just don't try to make any substitutions - they don't allow them, and they really mean it. There are also over 70 beers on tap. 
34.02385-118.394276 Velvet Lounge, 9400 Culver Blvd (in the Culver Hotel downtown), ☏ +1-310-838-7326. Th 7PM-1AM, F-Sa 7PM-2AM. While the hotel's downstairs lobby has a bar and live music most nights, up the stairs on the second floor is a speakeasy that is slightly less crowded and offers views of downtown. Opened in 2014 after a hotel remodel, the bar's ambiance is a cross between 1920s Paris and Hollywood, making for a sophisticated yet comfortable environment. While the cocktail selection and furniture evoke the Prohibition era, sadly prices are on the high side and most definitely reflect 21st century Los Angeles. (updated Nov 2015)
Coffee & tea[edit]
34.02065-118.398847 Conservatory for Coffee, Tea and Cocoa, 10117 W Washington Blvd (across from Sony Studios), ☏ +1-310-558-0436. Family-run coffee shop that roasts their own beans daily and makes one of the best macchiato's this side of the Big Pond. They are known for their "latte art" - you have to order one in a china cup to appreciate it. A local favorite, they also have a huge variety of teas from around the world and make a wonderful Mexican hot chocolate.
