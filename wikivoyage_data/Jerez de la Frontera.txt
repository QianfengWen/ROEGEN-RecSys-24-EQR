Jerez de la Frontera, on the Costa de la Luz, is one of the major cities in Andalusia, Spain, the fifth in terms of size and population (about 213,000 inhabitants in 2019). Jerez has gradually become a major transport hub and the main economic engine in the province of Cádiz.


Understand[edit]
Jerez de la Frontera, the resilient city on the Atlantic coast, has always enjoyed a privileged strategic location. Over centuries as a medieval border town with its castle high up, it has resisted first the Christians attacks and sieges, later the Moors that tried to conquer the city again. After the Catholic Kings took over the Kingdom of Granada and brought peace to the peninsula, the economic and intellectual life returned to the splendour of Moorish times.

Plaza del Arenal, “where Jerez dreams”
There has been an intense rivalry between Jerez and Cádiz for a long time. Since Cádiz became capital of the province, Jerez has had to struggle for its current economic and cultural position without much institutional support. While a certain reluctant brotherhood binds the two cities together today, the rivalry continues, and the traveller is well advised not to conflate the two cities.
Nowadays, few places in Spain can be said to enjoy the international renown of Jerez as, thanks to its sherry wines, the name of the city has crossed international boundaries long ago. But Jerez is not just a city of wines and beautiful buildings, it has much more to offer: it is home of the Carthusian horses, cradle of flamenco, capital of motorcycle racing and home to international sporting events, and a recognised centre of artistic and historical interest.
Despite its relatively small size, Jerez is (and has for centuries been) an ambitious, proud, and dynamic place, aided by supportive municipal institutions. For example, Jerez was the first Spanish city to have street lighting and the Caja de Ahorros de Jerez was the first savings bank in Spain. It was also the first city in the province to ask for a university, though the request was denied by Madrid. Projects like the race track Circuito de Jerez or the National Flamenco Centre (Ciudad del Flamenco) started as local initiatives, and then gained support from the national government.
In the region, Jerez is sometimes known as "señorita" ("Madam") because of the many families from bourgeois or even aristocratic backgrounds who developed the wine business. However, despite these noble roots, Jerez is more urban and diverse than it may seem at first sight.
If you are short on time, the traditional tourist circuit comprises horses, flamenco and wine. This little trilogy could be called the essence of Andalusia and largely explains the financial stability of Jerez, despite not being the provincial capital. But if you have more time, try to go beyond the surface: Enjoy some coffee or tapas in a traditional cafe or an ultra-cool one, walk around the food market, attend a play in the theatre or a concert, stroll through the old town. Sometimes just one block off the main road will take you off the beaten path.
Jerez is a large city where long-standing traditions coexist in perfect harmony with the modern: large shopping centres and wide avenues converge upon the historic, cheerful and bustling city centre, where shopping and tapas go hand in hand. These distinctive features, together with a privileged geographical situation and climate, distinct tourist sights, and modern infrastructures, all make Jerez the perfect place to live in and to visit.

The city is in the western part of Andalusia, near the Guadalete river. Jerez is 15 minutes from the beach, 35 minutes from the Sierra de Grazalema, and 50 min to 1 hour from the Andalusian capital, Sevilla.

Stay safe[edit]
Due to Jerez not being a particularly wealthy or economically dynamic city (at 27%, the city's unemployment rate is one of the highest in Europe), it often ranks among Spain's most dangerous cities, but the areas visited by tourists are safe, like the city centre that is bustling with life at all times. Broadly speaking, the city's southern neighbourhoods should be avoided.
