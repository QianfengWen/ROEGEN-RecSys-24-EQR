The river flowing through Andermatt
Andermatt[dead link] is a town and ski resort in the canton of Uri, Switzerland. It is located at a crossroad in the Alps with great historical importance. Before the opening of the Gotthard car and train tunnels, a big part of the north–south traffic had to pass through here. It has been a rather sleepy town for the last decades but is now slated for the development of a big resort by a foreign investor, so it might be a good time to visit while it is still the quiet place it is now.


Understand[edit]
In 2018, it was home to 1,400 people.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
There are roads in all four cardinal directions to Andermatt, and being a bit off the beaten track, driving there may be an alternative. The town is surrounded by mountain passes, and you need to cross at least one in order to get into the town. The highest of them, Furka to the west is situated at more than 2,400 m, and Andermatt is more than 1400 m (almost one mile) above sea level. Driving through alpine passes is a great experience and the views are fantastic. However remember that the engine heats up when ascending and the brakes when descending.

By train[edit]
Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn (for travel details see Swiss national railways SBB [1][dead link]) operates local trains to Andermatt from Davos Platz, Göschenen and Visp. The Glacier Express from Zermatt to St. Moritz also stops at Andermatt.
During the summer months, a bus connects to Meiringen (roughly 2 hr) via the Susten pass twice daily.

Get around[edit]
Map of Andermatt
See[edit]
There are not actually many museums and monuments and that like in Andermatt. However, the town's alpine-style houses and the nature with the surrounding summits are certainly worth photographing. Do bring a camera.

46.658.591 Devil's bridge (Teufelsbrücke) (On the road between Andermatt and Göschenen.). The Schöllenen Gorge below Andermatt used to be the bottleneck on the important Gotthard route. The first bridge was built here around 1300 and a first stone bridge around 1600. The two bridges which are now present are from 1830 and 1958. A famous Swiss legend tells of how the first bridge was built by the devil in exchange for the soul of the first men to cross the bridge. According to legend, a ploy was then used and a dog sent over the bridge instead. The devil got angry and brought along a boulder large enough to smash the bridge but was convinced on the way not to do so. He dropped the 46.67158.59312 boulder where he was and it is supposedly still there today next to the road. (updated Jan 2017)
