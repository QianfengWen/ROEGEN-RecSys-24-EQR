Do[edit]
Whale watching[edit]
Húsavík is one of the main destinations for whale watching in Iceland. The species that can be seen on the tours include blue whale, humpback whale, minke, fin whale, harbour porpoise, white-beaked dolphin, and rarely orca. Whale watching season is April through October.
Dress warmly for whale watching voyages, especially during colder months and even during warmer months. It generally feels much colder and windier on the water and it can be difficult to take shelter against the weather. Warm socks and gloves are especially helpful. 
Tour companies will typically provide wet-weather gear that can be worn over your outfit, so a rain jacket and pants are not needed, but it's advisable to wear waterproof shoes.
Be careful taking photos on the boat. It is very easy to drop a phone or camera overboard. Use a tether or strap to prevent accidents.
If you are susceptible to motion sickness, consider proactively taking motion sickness medicine and research strategies to manage motion sickness while underway.
