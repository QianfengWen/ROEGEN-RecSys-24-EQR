Map of Lake Louise
Lake Louise is a beautiful mountain lake in the middle of Banff National Park in the Alberta Rockies region of Alberta. The lake is surrounded by snow-capped peaks, and at the far end is a large glacier. The lake is quite isolated, but provides a magnificent setting for a luxury resort, the Châteaux Lake Louise, and a conference wing on the 'inland' side of the hotel.
There is a very small town of the same name at the base of the mountain.


Understand[edit]
The lake, a major tourist attraction, can be crowded during the day as coach tour groups arrive, and parking fills up early in the summer. Before 8AM, you can see the lake with few people around; at dawn, the light shines onto the back wall of the glacier lake. Just before dusk is also reasonably quiet.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Lake Louise is 186 km (120 miles) west of Calgary, and 56 km (36 miles) Northwest of the town of Banff on Highway 1 (Trans-Canada Highway). 
An alternative from Banff is the Bow Valley Parkway (Highway 1A), this is a restricted speed narrower tree lined road, which although does not provide such clear views of the mountain does provide a better chance of seeing wildlife such as bears and deer.
Lake Louise can also be reached by traveling south from Jasper on Highway 93 (Icefields Parkway).

Get around[edit]
Once in Lake Louise, you have access to some of the most beautiful drives in North America.

North: The Icefields Parkway, connects Lake Louise to Jasper.  It is 230 km (142 mi) taking you along the most beautiful drive in North America.  Along the Icefields Parkway you can stop and take a tour on the Columbia Icefield which is a glacier that covers an amazing 325 square km of land.  An information centre there includes an interpretive section and a café.
West The Great Divide denotes the highest ridge-line in the Canadian Rockies and creates a natural border with British Columbia and Yoho National Park 10 km west of town.
East Banff is 60 km (36 miles) south-east of Lake Louise on either Hwy 1 (Trans Canada Highway) or the 1A (Bow Valley Parkway).  Hwy 1 is quicker, but if you have some time to explore and enjoy the scenery the 1A is the way to go.  There tends to be more animals sighted on the 1A and the scenery is breathtaking (not that you're going to get a bad view from any road in Banff National Park).  Leave some time for a walk at Johnston Canyon, it's an easy walk anyone can do to the lower falls (1.1 km) or you can continue on further to the Upper Falls and the Ink Pots.
National Car Rental is located in the village of Lake Louise and there is a Hertz location in the Fairmont Lake Louise hotel. Otherwise the tour buses are an option.
The surest way to get to the lakeshore, other than staying at a nearby hotel, is to take the Parks Canada Shuttle: Lake Louise Lakeshore bus. Book tickets in advance, then park at the Park and Ride, located at the Lake Louise Ski Resort, and take a bus to Lake Louise (every 20 minutes). You can also take the bus (Parks Canada: Lake Connector) to Moraine Lake (no additional fee), so best is to start in the morning and see both lakes.

Do[edit]
As a ski-resort and wilderness area, tourist activity varies according to the season. The primary form of spring and summer recreation in the area is walking around the lake on the lakeside path, hiking on mountain trails leading from the lake, and admiring the scenery.
