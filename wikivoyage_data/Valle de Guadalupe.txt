Valle de Guadalupe (Guadalupe Valley) is in Mexico outside the city of Ensenada and is the premier wine producing region of Mexico. It is a popular tourist destination for wine and Baja Med cuisine, a fusion of Mexican cuisine and Mediterranean cuisine. The region features more than 180 wineries and an ever-growing list of boutique hotels and spas. 


Understand[edit]




Grapes of Baja
These are a few of the varietals you'll experience in Guadalupe:

Cabernet Sauvignon - the world's most favorite red grape (and Guadalupe's top grape), dark color and deep fruit aromas
Nebbiolo - a grape that Italians sometimes believe only they can grow successfully is hugely popular among the smaller vineyards of Guadalupe
Tempranillo - s popular grape in Spain, it's also grown at over half the vineyards in Guadalupe. Winemakers appreciate the dusky leather character it brings to wines.
Mision - Franciscan friars planted this grape in the 18th century throughout California (both Baja and the U.S.) so they could make sacramental wines. It is a niche grape, but appreciated for its history perhaps more than its flavor and aroma.
Chardonnay - is the most widely grown white grape in Guadalupe and is often blended with Chenin Blanc or other varietals

LA Cetto is the largest wine producer in the Guadalupe Valley
The region includes a number of small towns and villages including (from south to north) San Antonio de Las Minas, Francisco Zarco, Porvenir, and San Antonio Necua.
The Valle de Guadalupe is equivalent to two-thirds of the Napa Valley in size and the climatic conditions are very similar to those of the French southwest (Rhone Valley). It has a Mediterranean microclimate that is conducive to winemaking activities. Most Mexican wines are produced in the Valle de Guadalupe, though there are other, smaller wine producing regions in other states, particularly in the Bajio region. 

Climate[edit]
The climate is Mediterranean, a little more extreme due to its distance from the coast (25 km). Mornings are often damp and misty with a layer of fog floating over the vineyards. It has very hot and dry summers, without rain but with a breeze at night from the coast, mild and slightly cold, humid winters, the rainy season is between November and March. Temperatures are generally stable throughout the year, but when the direction of the winds changes from the continent to the sea, temperatures can rise well above normal whatever the time of year. This condición santana phenomenon generally affects northern Baja California and southern California, and generally lasts 2 to 4 days.

Terroir[edit]
Terroir is a term that includes climate, but more broadly, refers to any physical aspect of a region that can affect grapes and ultimately, uniquely local impacts on the flavor. In addition to climate, it is affected by the soil character (especially how it drains or retains water), by nutrients in the soil, by whether a vineyard is located in a place with direct afternoon sun or shade from nearby mountains. It also might be affected by the character of nearby industries, or products of adjacent farms. 
The Guadalupe Valley is often said to have a "Mediterranean climate" because of its warm temperatures and bright sunshine, but there's also factors make Guadalupe Valley different from the Mediterranean, or Napa for that matter (and by extension, its terroir will be different). The Guadalupe Valley is close to the Pacific Ocean and has steady cooling breezes and a propensity for early morning fog that brings moisture to the vineyards. The soil is mostly sandy loam on the valley floor, with more granite in the foothills as you get close to the mountains (where several of Guadalupe Valley's most interesting small vineyards are found). Also be aware that some wines may inherit a terroir that's different from the winery's own grapes because grapes are commonly purchased from other growers, perhaps to satisfy demand when crops don't produce as expected, perhaps to get a different varietal (or old growth grapes). Purchased grapes may come from three other nearby valleys with similar, but slightly different terroirs.

Get in[edit]
Map of the Guadalupe Valley.  Click on the layers icon at the top right, then "Relief map" to see the hills and topography.
The Guadalupe Valley is 20 km (12 mi) north of the City of Ensenada and 113 km (70 mi) southeast of the border crossing from San Diego to Tijuana. From Ensenada, drive north on MEX 1 and then turn onto MEX 3 heading north. From the north, you can follow MEX 1 south of Tijuana, but a better route might be to take the Ruta de Vino, MEX 3, south from Tecate (from San Diego, cross the border at Garita de Otay, then take MEX 2D east towards Tecate before turning south onto MEX 3).
An alternative route that is slower but more scenic and passes by dozens of lesser known vineyards is to take Carratera Francisco Zarco from MEX 1, passing through several towns, ending in Guadalupe (where you can connect to MEX 3). You will pass dozens of wineries and drive through areas surrounded by vineyards.

By bus[edit]
ABC operates one to three buses per day (more on weekends, less during the week) from Ensenada to Valle de Guadalupe. The 45-minute trip costs M$60 on the second-class bus or M$575 on the first-class ABC Plus bus. 
Several tour companies operate private tour buses or Sprinter vans that leave from the San Ysidro border crossing to Valle de Guadalupe. Buses do not go to Guadalupe Valley from the Tijuana bus station, but you could take one to Ensenada then use an Uber or taxi to visit wineries. ABC buses depart Tijuana at least hourly.

By boat[edit]
Many cruise ships from the United States make port calls in nearby Ensenada. The cruise lines always have day tours to the wine country of Guadalupe Valley. This is an easy way for many visitors to experience that flavors of Baja wines and cuisine without worrying about travel logistics. The disadvantage is that the day trips offer a very limited amount of time in the valley.

Get out[edit]
If you're driving your own car from San Diego or Los Angeles, it is far better and faster to go home via the border crossing at Tecate or Garita de Otay than at Tijuana. The U.S. Border Patrol has an app that tells you estimated wait times at border crossings. It is almost always wrong, often under-estimating waits by a factor of 2 or 3. The scenic and lightly traveled MEX 3 is an easy drive, and even though it's a longer distance than MEX 1, you always make up the time difference with shorter waits for the notoriously inefficient U.S. checkpoints.

Get around[edit]
Vineyards in the Guadalupe Valley
Many visitors tour the valley on day trips from cruise ships docked in Ensenada, but that short tour provides only the briefest glimpse in the world of Baja wines. There are a lot of wineries in the area and a great number of upscale restaurants and inns. The Guadalupe Valley is a region that richly rewards the slower traveler who spends at least several days exploring all the region affords. Renting a car in Ensenada is a good way to explore the area on your own schedule, and lets you visit multiple vineyards in the same day. Tour operators in Ensenada also offer daily and overnight packages to visitors not on a pre-packaged cruise ship itinerary.

By car[edit]
Most of the roads are usually well maintained dirt roads that may have potholes, especially after a rain. Small cars with low ground clearance may occasionally have problems. Be courteous of bicyclists and field hands and slow down to avoid kicking up huge dust clouds as you pass.
Uber is available in Valle de Guadalupe and in Ensenada. Arranging a full day with an Uber or taxi driver is an excellent approach because it gives you flexibility in your schedule, a local who knows the roads, and a designated driver so you can drink the wines without worrying about getting pinched in a sobriety checkpoint.

By bike[edit]
The Guadalupe Valley is easy to traverse by bicycle and many of the small dirt backroads are a joy to ride. Finding the wineries is easy: just look for the blue and white winery signs. Signage in the region is excellent. Many of the wineries are close together and often offer lodging. An excellent multi-day bike itinerary could easily be put together. Allow as little as a weekend to explore a small handful of wineries, or several months if you can spare the time and want to experience the myriad sides to Baja hospitality.

Mezcla Bordelega is a French-inspired red blend of Cab Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot that ages 12 months in American and French oak and one to several years in the bottle. The house signature wine, labeled Retorno, is a blend of 90% Grenache and a hint of Syrah, aged 2 years in the barrel and one year in the bottle. 
32.106117-116.623428 Vinos Shimul, Rancho Pet'ay s/n, Valle de Guadalupe, ☏ +52 646 177 2108. Friday and Saturday by appointment only. Shhh! This is a secret for the serious wine cognoscienti. Shimul doesn't shout out their presence: you won't find any blue and white signs guiding you off the freeway, and you won't find posted hours for tastings. No cruise ship tours visit Shimul. You might find some online reviews for Shimul, but only a handful compared to the hundreds, or even thousands for neighboring wineries. The owners like it that way. Since 2000, they have been producing less than 1,500 cases per year. L.A. Cetto might be the biggest winery in the Valley, but Shimul would rather be the best. The winery grows varietals that other growers in the area shun, such as the Mision grape, which is a heritage varietal with a reputation for being labor-intensive to grow. They also age their wines for longer times than neighboring wineries, and using more complex regimens, sometimes involving two or three barrels of different type woods, or using second-use barrels rather than new barrels. 
32.100498-116.57129929 Solar Fortun, ☏ +52 646 116 7235. F-Su 11:30 - 18:00. Founded in 2012, the winery produces 3,000 cases per year. It's located at the end of a canyon, down a long dirt road that ends in the valley's largest grove of old-growth California oak. The wines include a 100% Mourvédre that's aged in French oak and an interesting 50-50 blend of the Mourvédre with Petit Verdot. The winery's flagship wine, labeled "O Positivo", is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. 
31.965764-116.64242630 Vinícola Tres Valles, ☏ +52 646 178 8052. Th-Su 11:00 - 17:00. Founded in 2002, the small winery produces about 3,500 cases per year. It is a quirky place with eclectic sculptures of iron and wood, like the lizard near the entranceway or the spider in the tasting room. The wines are serious business though. Jala is a light white wine that's a blend of Chardonnay and Chenin Blanc. Maat is made with old growth Granache and aged 12 months in French and American oak. The Sangiovese is an Italian varietal with a floral bouquet. 
32.101916-116.61301731 Trevista Vineyards, Parcela # 18, San José de la Zorra, contact@trevistavino.com​. 12:00 - 17:00 Saturday only. The vineyards are actually operating on other days, but are usually booked for events and large tour groups. You can sometimes arrange to get in by calling ahead. The winery is an interesting place because they are very small (producing only about 300 cases per year) and because they focus on the Tempranillo varietal. When you sample their wines you will probably be doing vertical tastings of different years of the Tempranillo. 
32.043245-116.6524432 Vena Cava, Rancho San Marcos Toros Pintos sn, Francisco Zarco, ☏ +52 646 156 8053. Daily 11:00 - 17:00. The folks at Vena Cava are taking sustainability to a new level with their eclectic new winery built largely of reclaimed, errr, junk. Like the ceiling of their tasting room built of abandoned boats from the port of Ensenada. It's definitely a conversation starter. Let's talk wines. They have some straightforward varietals, like a 100% Granache, but quite a few blends, like an 80% Sauvignon Blanc with 20% Chenin Blanc, or a 50-50 blend of Grenache and Syrah. 
32.026662-116.62190833 Viñas de la Erre, Carretera Tecate-Ensenada KM 87.5. F-M 11:00 - 18:00 (closed Tu W Th). The Rocha family had owned the land for more than three decades before deciding to start a vineyard in 2014. It's a charming small winery that produces 1,500 cases per year. Their Mezcla de la Erre is a complex blend of cabernet sauvignon, merlot, tempranillo and zinfandel---it earned the winery a silver medal in San Francisco. It is a wine that draws well outside the lines of traditional French (or even U.S.) conventions. So does their wine Selección de Tintos Reserve, a blend of cabernet franc, petit verdot, merlot and cabernet sauvignon aged 28 months in French oak. 
32.02627-116.61534534 Viñas de Garza, Rancho Mogorcito, México 3 Km 87, ☏ +52 646 175 8883. F-Su 11:00 - 16:30. This family-run vineyard is one of the larger artesanal wineries, producing over 9,000 cases of wine per year. The property is immaculately landscaped with the tasting area atop a hill with soft breezes blowing through the spacious outdoor tasting pavilion. There is no restaurant on site, putting the focus squarely on the wine itself. Three different tasting packages are offered, differing by the quantity and quality of wines you want to sample. Chances are good that your tasting will be guided by one of the owners, who love to share their passion for wine and Baja with visitors. Wines may include a Chardonnay aged 10 months in French oak, a blend of Grenache and Tempranillo, or perhaps the Especial Edition blend of Grenache Syrah and Mourvédre. 
32.098757-116.5746535 Viñedos Malagón, C. C 101, Francisco Zarco, ☏ +52 646 155 2102. W-Su 10:00 - 18:00. This vineyard was once part of the Rancho Malagón where Russian immigrants farmed the land in the 20th century. The winery opened in 2000 marking a new industry for a new millenium. Wineries are the name of the game in the Guadalupe Valley these days. Viñedos Malagón has been quite successful among the wine startups and now produces over 5,000 cases of wine per year. The property includes an upscale boutique bed-and-breakfast with spacious rooms decorated in bright colors with rustic pine furniture. The wines are graced with whimsically named labels, like Whistling Donkey, a 100% Nebbiolo, or Tinto a blend of five varietals. A craft brewery is also on premises under the name Cerveceria El Destino. 
32.011133-116.64430836 Xecue, MEX 3, KM 88.9, ☏ +52 646 175 3830. Tu-Su 11:00 - 19:00. Owners Jose Luis and his wife Alberta split the workload 50-50, he grows the grapes, she makes the wine. Together, they welcome visitors to their modernistic young winery. Opened in 2004, they produce about 4,000 cases of wine per year. The winery includes an elegant restaurant serving regional Baja cuisine and rooms are available for overnight stays. A variety of wines can be sampled including Kumeey, a blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 25% Cab Frac. Kekoo, is a 100% Grenache varietal, Relato is a blend of Cab, Merlot, Tempranillo, and Nebbiolo 
Buy[edit]
There are surprisingly few shops in this area, but they will likely come as merchants realize how fast the area has grown and how many wine enthusiasts and foodies have already discovered it. There are a large number of wine shops selling bottles of the local vintages...if you're looking for a potable souvenir. For now, you will find a wider range of shops in Ensenada.

32.094528-116.5766681 Por un Beso, Calle Principal y Tercera 210 4-5, Delegación Francisco Zarco, ☏ +52 646 977 7167. Daily 09:00 - 18:00. Neat and cozy small boutique shop selling souvenirs, hand-made crafts and typical clothing. Pottery, jewelry, handbags, and even a few T-shirts.

Baja Med is a term conceived by Chef Miguel Ángel Guerrero that refers to a fusion of Mexican cuisine, such as chicharrón and cotija cheese, with those of Mediterranean, such as olives, sun-dried tomatoes, olive oil, and sometimes elements of Asian cuisine, such as lemongrass. Baja Med dishes showcase the fresh produce and seafood of Baja California.
Valle de Guadalupe has a great number of excellent places to eat, most are tucked away within the wineries on bumpy dirt roads. You can get high end farm-to-table food, fresh seafood from the coast, and affordable Mexican food of course.
