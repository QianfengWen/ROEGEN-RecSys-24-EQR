Hartford, along with Beaver Dam and Rosine, are towns in Kentucky's Western Coal Fields. Hartford is the Ohio County seat with a population of about 2000 (plus a few soreheads as signs into the community proclaim). Beaver Dam is the largest town with about 3000. Rosine is widely known as the birthplace of Bill Monroe, the Father of Bluegrass Music.

Map of Hartford (Kentucky)


By car[edit]
Two roads that were originally part of Kentucky's parkway system of toll roads, all of which are now freeways, enter Ohio County, connecting Hartford with the rest of the state. The Western Kentucky Parkway (often locally called the "WK") is the east-west highway that links Paducah and I-24 with Elizabethtown, along with I-65 North and the Bluegrass Parkway (leading to Lexington).
Interstate 165, originally the Green River Parkway and later the William H. Natcher Parkway, is the north-south route that connects Bowling Green and I-65 South with Owensboro and the Audubon Parkway and Henderson. The WK and I-165 intersect southeast of Beaver Dam.

By plane[edit]
37.458556-86.8498331 Ohio County Airport, ☏ +1 270 298-3500. Small aircraft can fly into Hartford by using Fortener Aircraft Services of Ohio County  
Small aircraft service is available in Owensboro (OWB IATA), 30 minutes north.
The nearest major airports are in Nashville, about two hours south, and Louisville, 1½ hours to the northeast. Limited air service is also available in Evansville, one hour to the northwest.
Get around[edit]
US 62 parallels the Western Kentucky Parkway (both the segments signed as such, and the part now signed as Interstate 69) for that road's entire east-west route, including Ohio County. It connects the Hartford-Beaver Dam area with the town of Rosine and further east to Horse Branch and beyond to Grayson County. To the west, US 62 passes McHenry and Rockport before crossing the Green River into Muhlenberg County.
US 231 parallels I-165 for the latter road's entire length from north to south. From the south, it enters from Butler County and passes Cromwell before entering Beaver Dam (where it provides access to the Western Kentucky Parkway at Exit 75). US 231 connects Beaver Dam with Hartford as a four-lane thoroughfare with shops and restaurants, along with Ohio County High School. To the north US 231 passes near Beda and Pleasant Ridge before entering Daviess County.
KY 69 connects Hartford with the northeastern community of Fordsville before heading toward the Ohio River at Hawesville. From Fordsville KY 54 West connects with Whitesville and Owensboro, while KY 54 East connects with Leitchfield. There is an interchange at I-165 with KY 69, providing Hartford with easy access to Owensboro and Bowling Green. KY 69 continues west to Centertown.
KY 505 links Rosine with US 231 near Cromwell to the south and KY 878 in Olaton to the north. There is no interchange with the Western Kentucky Parkway south of Rosine.

 Jerusalem Ridge. Rosine. Jerusalem Ridge refers to the area just a few miles outside of Rosine and is best known as the birthplace and childhood home where the Monroe Family settled and lived in the early 1900s. The Jerusalem Ridge/Monroe farm was almost 1000 acres in size and provided the Monroes with fertile farmland, logging and coal resources with sustained their humble existence. Young Bill was an especially hard and dedicated worker, a trait that he was always proud of and formed his dedicated work ethic and strong personality throughout his life. The Great Depression of the 1920s brought economic devastation and hardship to the region and the Monroe Brothers were forced to migrate north to seek work in the factories and refineries to help support the family back in Kentucky. Despite their best efforts, the family, facing increasing pressure to simply survive, were forced to leave their beloved family home on Jerusalem Ridge and the farm was foreclosed on and sold at public auction, an event that Bill and his brothers bitterly regretted for the remainder of their lives. A local businessman owns the property and its future as a historical landmark remains in question.

Drink[edit]
Ohio County is a dry community. The nearest wet community is its northeast neighbor of Daviess County, home to Owensboro. Owensboro is roughly the same distance from Hartford as another wet community, Central City, but is closer in drive time; also, since all of Daviess County is wet, alcohol sellers can be found well before reaching Owensboro.

Connect[edit]
By phone[edit]
Most telephone numbers in Hartford (and in the rest of Ohio County) consist of +1 270 plus a seven-digit number, but the county is now served by an overlay complex of two area codes, with +1 364 being the second. A local or in-state telephone call now requires all 10 digits of the local number be dialed (omitting just the leading +1 from a local landline call).
Signage on many established businesses may still display the original seven-digit numbers; dial 270 before these if no area code is indicated.
