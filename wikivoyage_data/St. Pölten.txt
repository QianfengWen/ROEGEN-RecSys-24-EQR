St. Pölten is a city with about 55,000 inhabitants (2018) in Lower Austria between the Bohemian Massif and the Türnitz Alps.
Many people consider St. Pölten to be a city of low touristic interest. Anyway its high living standard and the convenient location make it a place worthwhile to hang out some time and relax, e. g. at the lakes or to undertake some day trips.

High altar of the Mariazell Basilica
Go next[edit]
Go to Mariazell using the Mariazeller Bahn[dead link]. The trip of 85km takes about 2.5 hr. This route was one of the first in Austria to become fully electrified (in 1911), and some of the train engines from that time are still in operation (this is a world record). Beside of the impressive scenery, the tracks' arrangement is pretty ingenious because of the vast differences in altitude that have to be overcome.
When buying a ticket check if the train engines are of type "1099", which are the world record ones, so that you know the true promise of the Mariazeller Bahn.
