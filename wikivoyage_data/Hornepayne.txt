Hornepayne is a township of about a thousand people (2021) in the Algoma District of Northern Ontario, Canada. It's the closest settlement to the geographic center of Ontario, a point that lands in a remote bog to the north of the town.


Understand[edit]
Hornepayne serves as a railway divisional point on the main Canadian National Railway line. The forestry industry (by way of Hornepayne Lumber) is the major employer to the local economy. Hunting- and fishing-related tourism in the area (particularly just north of the town in nearby Nagagamisis Provincial Park) is served by several small companies.

History[edit]
The town was established in 1915 as Fitzback when the Canadian Northern Railway's transcontinental line was built through the area. It was renamed Hornepayne in 1920 after British financier Robert Horne-Payne.
