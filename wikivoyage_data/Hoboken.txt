Hoboken Terminal and downtown.
Hoboken (HOH-boh-kən) is a small city on the Hudson River in northeastern New Jersey. Once known only as the birthplace of baseball and crooner Frank Sinatra and the site of Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken has become a party town, rich in bars and clubs, and a bedroom community for young, mostly twenty-something professionals who work across the river in New York City

By plane[edit]
Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR IATA) is the closest of metro New York three major airports. To get to downtown Hoboken take any New Jersey Transit train headed for New York to Secaucus Junction and change there to a train headed for Hoboken Terminal. During rush hour, some trains run directly to Hoboken from Newark Airport Station.

By car[edit]
From New Jersey:  Take Route 3 East (Garden State Parkway exit 153, Turnpike exit 16E) to Route 495 East and exit on the "Last exit in New Jersey", then turn right at the bottom of the hill. Or take the NJ Turnpike to exits 14-14C and stay on I-78, then make a left at the traffic light. The same traffic light can also be reached from the Pulaski Skyway from Newark. Another option is taking the Paterson Plank Road from Route 3  where you would have to take this road all the way to the end. If you choose to take the Paterson Plank Road, you need to keep in mind that when you're on Route 3, the exit to take will be labeled as 'North Bergen'
From New York: Tune into 1010 WINS or WCBS 880 both on the AM (radio) dial to see whether the wait to get into New Jersey is shorter at the Lincoln Tunnel or the Holland Tunnel. If you're in Midtown or the wait is much shorter at the Lincoln Tunnel, take that. Keep right, and follow the signs for Hoboken. If you're downtown or the wait is much shorter at the Holland Tunnel, take that. When you get out of the tunnel, make the first right turn. You will soon find yourself in downtown Hoboken.

Get around[edit]
View of Midtown Manhattan from Frank Sinatra Park. Seeing the great view of Manhattan is part of the draw of a visit to Hoboken.
Walk!  It is incredibly hard to find parking in Hoboken.  Some places to find parking are Sinatra Drive by the Hudson River, or any street named after a president (besides Washington).  The city-run parking garages on Hudson Street and elsewhere are also a good option if you're worried about getting booted. The parking garages generally range from $3-5 an hour and prices jump up if you leave the car overnight. Some of the parking garages are also either for Hoboken residents or available in monthly payments only so, read the signs and ask people at the parking garages to double check.
Besides walking, the Citibike system allows users to ride bikes and between bike stations in Hoboken. It is integrated into New York City and Jersey City's Citibike system, so bikes, accounts, passes, and keys can be used interchangeably. The Frank Sinatra Park and the Hudson River Walkway are examples of nice places to bike. It is important to mention that the previous bike share system that existed in Hoboken, Hudson Bike Share, is no longer in operation as of 2020 and there are no longer docks present anywhere in Hudson County outside of Hoboken or Jersey City.
If you must park, read the signs on the street. Make sure that you are allowed to park where you're leaving your car. Most streets have one side reserved for Hoboken Residents, that are marked clearly with a green background and white letters.  These are Resident Only parking sides and you must have a resident permit to park there. Street cleaning restrictions are in effect as well as a time limit of 4 hours for non-residents - after that, you should move your car.
Finding a parking spot is so hard in Hoboken that they sell parking spaces for up to $40,000.

With a great assortment of prewar buildings, Hoboken is a great place to wander on foot.

Join in holiday celebrations in Hoboken. The city is full of people and celebrations when the holidays come around.

Do[edit]
Walk down Washington Street, there are many shops and restaurants here.
Stop in Tunes and buy some music, a nice little music shop.
Walk/jog/rollerblade along the Hudson River. The running path extends north to Weehawken (nicer, greener), and south through Jersey City to Liberty State Park (with short inland section). In summer/fall, water is available from water fountains.
If you ride skateboards or rollerblades, there is a small skatepark along the Hudson River (with spectacular Manhattan views) about 1 mile north of the PATH station.

40.737012-74.0262221 Pier A Park (Next to Hoboken Train Station). Offers great views of New York City. On a clear day the incredible panorama visible from the end of the pier stretches between the George Washington and Verrazano Narrows Bridges. In the summer months around 5-6PM, one can often see huge cruise ships sailing by on their way out to sea en route to Bermuda and Canada. If you are an early riser (or up very late) the views of sunrise silhouetting the city from Pier A is unforgettable. It is also the perfect place to view the “Tribute in Light” (if they continue to do it) remembering the anniversary of September 11. Hoboken lost more of its residents in September 11th than any city other than New York. A memorial grove and flame shaped memorial is set up on Pier A to remember their sacrifice. There are various parks spanning the waterfront from Pier A, all the way up to 15th Street. Maxwell Park is the newest addition on Sinatra Drive.  (updated Jan 2019)

Drink[edit]
Hoboken has occasionally been called "Bartown" which is a well deserved nickname since it has more liquor licenses per capita than any other town in New Jersey. There is a huge range of lounges and bars in a very compact area. Many Hoboken restaurants do not have liquor licenses, so they allow you to BYO wine and beer with no corkage fee. This can save you a considerable sum since a good bottle of wine can be purchased at nearby bottle shops for less than $10!
There are dozens of bars within a few minutes walk of the PATH station catering to every taste in boozing. Gay, straight, cover bands, pick up, meat market, stuffy, seedy, trendy, you name it. Happy hours at many Hoboken establishments are a good deal. So if you want to get a buzz on the cheap, show up before 7PM or 8PM.

Incredibly, Hoboken has just one major hotel, and it is expensive (starting at $209 per night). Of course if you are hammered from a night of hitting the pubs, sleep on the train!
