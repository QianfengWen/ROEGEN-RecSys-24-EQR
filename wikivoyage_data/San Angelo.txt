San Angelo (pronounced "Snangelo" by locals) is a city in the Northern Edwards Plateau of Texas, on the Concho River.  It is the home of Goodfellow Air Force Base, Angelo State University, and the Producer's Livestock Auction, the country's largest sheep and lamb market.


Understand[edit]
San Angelo is the county seat of Tom Green County, and the largest city in this mostly sparsely-populated part of west Texas.  The military and college communities, along with business opportunities and Mexican immigration, have contributed to the city's growth and change over the years.
The city was founded in the late 1800s outside a new Army post, Fort Concho.  The founder, Bartholomew DeWitt, named it "Santa Angela" after his wife, Carolina Angela.  This was eventually shortened to "San Angela."  The final change came in 1883 when the US Postal Service informed the town that the name was grammatically incorrect (san can only be used before a male name).  Rather than revert to the original name, they changed it to "San Angelo."
The city has benefited economically from agriculture, the oil and gas industry, and after World War II, the US Air Force presence in the form of Goodfellow Air Force Base.  Today, San Angelo's economy is largely supported by its two hospitals, telecommunications, agriculture, the university, and the region's largest employer, the Air Force.
Even though this city has over a 100,000 people, the locals will still notice if you're not from around here.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
A Sign as you enter San Angelo
San Angelo is not on an Interstate highway, so there aren't any completely direct routes from any major cities.
From the Dallas/Fort Worth area, take Interstate 20 to Abilene, and then either US-277 directly to San Angelo, or US-83 to Ballinger and US-67 from there to San Angelo (neither route is substantially faster or slower).
From San Antonio, the best path is probably Interstate 10 to Fredericksburg, US-83 to Eden, then US-87 to San Angelo.
From El Paso one can start on Interstate 10, then get onto Interstate 20 when it splits off from 10, go through Midland and Odessa to Big Spring, and then take US-87 from there to San Angelo.

By plane[edit]
31.355-100.4963891 San Angelo Regional Airport (Mathis Field SJT  IATA). Serves San Angelo as a commercial non-primary hub airport that serves commercial, private and military aircraft. American Eagle provides service to Dallas/Fort Worth. Usually only 4 flights a day arrive here. It is the only commercial airport serving Concho Valley. There is also no ATM at the airport. There is also two places to eat at this airport with vending machines as well. This is a small airport and you have to be there 30 minutes prior to the flight departing if you need to check bags and get a boarding pass, even for e-check-in. The same person who is at the ticket counter is the same person who scans your ticket at the gate-- that's how small the airport is.   
There are taxis that can pick you up at the airport, but usually you have to call them to come pick you up. There are also two rental car companies that serve the airport. Parking: there are 352 public parking places.

By bus[edit]
San Angelo is served by Greyhound. Buses stops at San Angelo Transit Center, 510 N Chadbourne St.

A car is necessary to get around just like in most places in Texas, it's not really recommended to walk as everything is spread out.

Stay safe[edit]
San Angelo does not have a high crime rate just take caution as you would in any other town, they take drunk driving very seriously here in Texas and it is not uncommon to see a DUI checkpoint around so be forewarned, also they are very strict on the speed limit here and will pull you over and ticket you

Water[edit]
Be prepared to buy drinking water, the water is potable but honestly doesn't taste that good. There are water vending machines all over town that you can usually fill a gallon jug for a quarter. Another word of note-- if you ask for water at a restaurant it would be a good idea to ask if its filtered water or not or just buy water in a bottle there.
