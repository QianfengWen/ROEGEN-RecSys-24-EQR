Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Your best option. 
From London, the main road leading towards Hythe is the M20, which runs via Maidstone and Ashford. Exit the M20 at junction 11, and follow the signs for Hythe. From the Brighton direction, take the A259 via Hastings, Winchelsea and Rye along the scenic coast route. Coming from the Dover direction, travel along the A20 and M20, passing by Folkestone and the Channel Tunnel, and exiting junction 11.

By train[edit]
The nearest train station to Hythe is the annoyingly-rural 51.091.0661 Sandling station, which is served by one Southeastern train per hour in each direction on the line from London Charing Cross to Dover Priory. Infrequent buses (Stagecoach routes 10, 10A, and 18) link the station to Hythe; alternatively, your only options are to call a taxi (JJ Taxis, ☏ +44 1303 244 442) or to walk the two-and-a-bit miles along the road into town - fortunately, there is a pavement.

The Romney, Hythe & Dymchurch
51.07021.07983 The Royal Military Canal (RMC), ☏ +44 1797 367 934, mail@rmcp.co.uk. 28-mile (45 km) canal dug between 1804 and 1809 as an extra line of defence against invasion from France by Napoleon's Grande Armée. A towpath runs alongside, making it possible to walk, cycle, or row the entire length. Because motorised boat traffic is forbidden, the RMC is favoured by aquatic wildlife such as glow worms, kingfishers, marsh frogs, and water voles. Hythe is near the eastern end of the canal, and the section within the town was converted into ornamental use in the 1860s. This part is especially beautiful, lined with elm, copper beech and weeping willow trees.   (updated Jun 2020)
