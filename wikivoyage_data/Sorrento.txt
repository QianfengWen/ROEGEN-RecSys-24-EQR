For other places with the same name, see Sorrento (disambiguation).

Sorrento is in Campania. The town features beautiful architecture, many cafes and restaurants, and shops catering to tourists.


Understand[edit]
Sorrento is on the Circumvesuviana rail system, so it is easily reached from Naples and an ideal base for visiting the archaeological sites at Pompeii and Ercolano.
Ferries regularly commute between Sorrento and Capri, Positano and Amalfi, making Sorrento an ideal base for exploring the  other beautiful places in the region.

Get in[edit]
Read about the unified public transport ticket Campania Unico.
By plane[edit]
From Naples Airport ('Capodichino'): You can reach Sorrento by bus, from Capodichino to Sorrento buses depart six times daily.
By train[edit]
The Circumvesuviana goes from Naples (starting at Porta Nolana via Garibaldi) along the coast ending at the 40.6257314.379741 Sorrento train station (€4.90, 1 hr 20 min, as of July 2021). The trains tend to get very crowded until the stop at Pompei during the summer (board at Porta Nolana for a seat) and many of them are outdated and your only air conditioning will be an open window. They run approx. every 30 minutes. Tickets can be bought both at staffed counters as well as over the Unico Campania app. There are very few ticket machines, which are hard to find (one is in the main hall of Porta Nolana to the right of the counters, one at the elevator on the first floor of Sorrento station) and often out of order.
From mid-March to the end of October, the Campania Express runs along the same route as the Circumvesuviana between Naples and Sorrento, but stops at just a few stations and takes about 50 min (30 min less than the commuter trains). These trains have guaranteed seating, air conditioning, and space to store baggage. €15 oneway now in 2024
By bus[edit]
The SITA  buses from Positano and Amalfi end in Sorrento in the plaza in front of the train station.

By car[edit]
From Naples' Tangenziale drive south towards Costiera Sorrentina, and be prepared to spend 1½ hours in the traffic.

By boat[edit]

Get around[edit]
Map of Sorrento
After you arrive by bus or train, you will exit to the modern park 40.6271114.379531 Piazza Lauro. From there, you can:

Walk
Local buses - the local bus service is good enough to visit all interesting places available in the area.
Taxi
Scooter hire companies charge about €20 per day. Helmets are legally required, but regularly not worn by those with nothing to protect.
It is possible to drive around town. Parking is very limited for cars (scooters park practically anywhere). The roads are allegedly one lane either way, but expect traffic in both directions to take that as a suggestion rather than a rule. Scooters and motorcycles are absolutely everywhere, so if you don't like being buzzed whilst trying to navigate narrow, winding roads, maybe skip trying to drive here.
