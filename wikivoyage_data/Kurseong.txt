Kurseong (Bengali: কার্শিয়াং Kārśiẏāṁ) is a town in the Darjeeling Hills‎ of West Bengal.


Understand[edit]
The town is also known as the "Land of Glorious Sunsets" because it faces the western part of the hills, the sunset is visible through a glorious mix of clouds turning crimson, yellow and red.
The Lepcha name literally means the "white orchid of the eastern Himalayas", which was apparently given by a European researcher who was researching an exotic variety of white orchid that could only be found at the height of Kurseong i.e. 4500 feet above sea level. This variety of the white orchid only grows at this height; hence the name the white orchid of the eastern Himalayas.
