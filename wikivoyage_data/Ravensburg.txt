By train and bus[edit]
Being a small city, Ravensburg's public transport network consists solely of an excellent bus network and a regional train (Bodensee Oberschwaben Bahn). The main bus station is next to the train station, however, most bus routes also travel across the main square ("arienplatz).

By foot[edit]
As most of the sites and places to stay are found in the city centre and the public transport network serves the city's suburbs, visitors to the city should be able to see everything without having to use the network.
The centre of the city is mainly pedestrianised. It is easy to explore the narrow streets, as the city centre is fairly compact. Some of the streets are quite steep.
