Get in[edit]
37°52′0″N 127°44′0″EMap of Chuncheon


By plane[edit]
From Incheon or Gimpo International Airport (ICN or GMP)[edit]
Intercity buses from each airport run hourly to Chuncheon Intercity Bus Terminal (춘천시외버스터미널). About half of these are non-stop, while others stop at Gapyeong and Cheongpyeong. Tickets available at the bus booth in the arrivals hall at the airport. An alternative is to take the AREX and then the metro to Chuncheon Station. This option is much more tiresome but also about half the price.

From Wonju Airport (WJU IATA)[edit]
Wonju airport only serves one daily flight from Jeju. The airport terminal is basically a bus station, where you check in and then take the bus across a highway to the military runway 1.6 km away. Intercity buses to and from Chuncheon are usually timed to match the flight schedule.

By bus[edit]
The Express Bus Terminal (춘천고속버스터미널) and Intercity Bus Terminal (춘천시외버스터미널) are next to each other. Only two bus routes operate from the Express Bus Teriminal: Daegu (3½ hr) and Gwangju (4½ hr). From Seoul and most other cities in the country, buses use the Intercity Bus Terminal.

From Seoul[edit]
Dongseoul Bus Terminal (동서울터미널) is the main terminal for buses heading East, and nonstop buses leave regularly every 15 minutes, between 06:00 and 24:00, and charge ₩7,700 with buses departing after 22:00 costing ₩8,500. These buses take around 70 minutes. There are several slower buses in between as well, but it's usually worth the wait to take the nonstop bus.
Seoul Express Bus Terminal (서울고속버스터미널) also has nonstop buses that leave about once every hour for Chuncheon. Although it has a higher fare of ₩9,100 and depart from the express bus terminal, the buses use Chuncheon's Intercity Bus Terminal.
There is also a bus service (number 8000) from Jamsil Station every 40-50 minutes between 07:20 and 21:00. Some buses make an extra stop at Gangchon. Fixed fare at ₩7,700 for adults.

From other cities[edit]
The Intercity Terminal is served by most major cities in the capital region as well as the Southern provinces. Many of these routes also stop at several flag stops en route to the terminal, but they aren't easy to locate especially for foreign travellers. There is no extra fare or requirement to get off at these stops.

By metro[edit]
The heavy rail line from Seoul to Chuncheon was converted to a metro line in 2010. The Gyeongchun Line runs from Cheongnyangni Station in the northeast of Seoul, although most trains depart at Sangbong Station. The trains leave every 15 minutes or so, and take a little more than an hour to reach Chuncheon. There is an express service as well during the weekdays (same fare). About ₩3,000 from Cheongnyangni to Chuncheon.

By train[edit]
There is also a heavy rail service that mostly follows the same line, the ITX-Cheongchun (ITX-청춘). Trains depart hourly from Yongsan Station and make several stops in Seoul (namely Cheongnyangni Station) before heading to Chuncheon. Specific intermediate stops differ by train. ₩8,300 from Yongsan to Chuncheon.

Get around[edit]
By taxi[edit]
Taxis are the most efficient way of getting around Chuncheon. Taxis are plentiful and you can easily find one within a few minutes if you wait on the sidewalk of most busier streets in the city. You may have trouble catching one if you are on the outskirts of Chuncheon or during rush hour when most are in use. The English word "taxi" is used in Korean, so it's easy to ask someone where one might wait to find a taxi.
The taxis are identified by a sign mounted on top of the car, but also have a red LED sign with Hangul lettering inside their windshield. If this sign is lit, it signifies that the taxi is available for hire. They turn this sign off when they are already transporting a customer. Stick your arm out to the street as a taxi approaches and they will stop.
Taxis are the best option for short trips through town and are nice when you need door to door service. They are especially helpful when shopping and you have goods to carry with you as you can put them in the trunk or the back seat (no extra fee). Another benefit is when you have multiple people in your group as the fare is the same no matter how many people ride.
Most taxi drivers speak no English, so it is a good idea to have the address of your destination written in Korean to show the taxi driver.

By bus[edit]
Though bus numbers are clearly marked and always run the same routes, most are not on any kind of schedule and you could wait 5 minutes or over an hour at a bus stop. They can also become very crowded and you may have to wait for people to get off after several stops before you can acquire a seat. Bus stops are placed throughout the city, but may be a little walk from where you are staying or from your destination. However, buses are more economical when traveling alone or going very far outside the city. Bus fare is typically ₩1,100 per person. Most Koreans who ride the bus regularly have a chipped card they scan when they board. As a visitor, you will need to put the exact cash into a slot in the front when boarding.
When you approach the stop you need to get off at, press the red button to the right of the exit door located on the passenger side of the bus half way back. This signals the driver to stop and the side doors will open. Exit quickly as it seems they are often off and running again before you can hit the ground.

By bicycle[edit]
Bicycles can be rented in several shops in town. One is near Namchuncheon station, once you get out from exit 1, keep walking 200 meters under the railway tracks. There is another store at Chuncheon station exit 2. The rental costs ₩3,000 per hour or ₩10,000 per day.
