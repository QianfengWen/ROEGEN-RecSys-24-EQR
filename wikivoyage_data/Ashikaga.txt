Old administration building of the Ashikaga School, Japan's oldest university
Ashikaga (足利) is a city in Tochigi prefecture, Japan, near the prefecture's border with Gunma.
Ashikaga makes an ideal day trip from Tokyo. It's a small city with a lot of history packed into an attractive and easily walkable radius, from the mound tombs (kofun) and mountain-top shrines of pre-Buddhist Japan to dozens of temples built by members of the long-powerful Ashikaga clan, notable patrons of classical Japanese theatre (Noh), art (flower arranging and tea ceremony), and architecture (the Golden and Silver Pavilions in Kyoto). 


Understand[edit]
The Ashikaga clan was an offshoot of the Minamoto clan who conquered Honshu and dominated the Kamakura Shogunate (1185-1333). Ashikaga Takauji overthrew the Kamakura shoguns and installed himself in the Muromachi district of Kyoto. The Ashikaga shoguns did not just help beautify Kamakura and Kyoto, they also built temples, gardens, and retirement villas in their hometown, which has been called a Little Kyoto and calls Kamakura one of its sister cities. The clan also sponsored the Ashikaga Gakkō, the most famous Confucian academy of eastern Japan, and Ashikaga has a friendship city relationship with Jining (Shandong), China, which includes Qufu, the hometown of Confucius.
As the Ashikaga shoguns got weaker, the country fractured into civil war, until it was reunited and pacified under the Tokugawa Shogunate, with its headquarters in Edo (modern Tokyo). Ashikaga and other towns on the edge of the Kanto plain prospered as Edo grew into a bustling metropolis, two of Ashikaga's specialties being soba and silk. Classic, Edo-period merchant stronghouses are still frequent sights along Ashikaga streets. Long prominent in the silk industry, Ashikaga, Kiryu, and nearby towns became important centers of Japan's industrial revolution, with textile manufacturing leading the way. Although the factories have moved overseas, textile handicrafters are still active, and fine woven goods can be found in many local souvenir shops.

Tourist information site[edit]
The local tourist association has a multilingual guide site.

Get in[edit]
Travelers coming from Narita airport should note that bus may be cheaper, faster and more convenient than taking train.

By train[edit]
The nearest Shinkansen (bullet train) stations are Oyama on the Tōhoku Shinkansen and Takasaki on the Jōetsu Shinkansen, both of which are connected to Ashikaga by the JR Ryōmō Line (両毛線), which has about 30 trains daily running in each direction between about 5AM and 11PM. JR Ashikaga station is on the north bank of the Watarase River, in the older, more walkable section of town. JR Ashikaga Flower Park Station, also on the JR Ryōmō Line, is seven minutes away on foot from Ashikaga Flower Park. 
The private Tōbu Asakusa-Isesaki Line (東武伊勢崎線) runs about 60 trains in each direction through Ashikaga-shi station every day between about 05:00 and 00:00. Express trains leaving Asakusa in Tokyo reach Ashikaga-shi in about 75 minutes (60 minutes from Kita-Senju in Tokyo). The local (or "Section Semi-Express", "Section-Express") takes twice as long. Kita-Senju is more convenient than Asakusa as a transfer point in the Tokyo area. Tōbu Ashikaga-shi station is on the south bank of the Watarase River, in the rapidly expanding south side of town, with strip malls, big-box retailers, and ample parking.

By bus[edit]
By car[edit]
Take the Sano-Fujioka exit from the Tōhoku Expressway and follow National Route 50 west toward Ashikaga. The four-lane divided highway is usually busy, and highway buses schedule a half-hour between the Sano Premium Outlets and the Ashikaga train stations. National Route 50 runs along the south edge of Ashikaga.
Take the Ashikaga exit from the Kita-Kanto Expressway and follow National Route 293 south toward Central Ashikaga.
It takes 15 minutes from the Ota-Kiryu exit in the Kita-Kanto Expressway to central Ashikaga. Take the Ota-Kiryu exit and follow National Route 122 & 50 east toward Ashikaga.

Get around[edit]
The Ashikaga City Bus runs 4 times a day each way through Ashikaga on a long route that runs far up the mountain valleys that flank the city. It costs ¥200 each way.
The old downtown of Ashikaga north of the Watarase River is very walkable, while the riverbank is very bikeable (and walkable). A bicycle trail runs along the levees for the full length of Ashikaga city, sometimes along the north levee, sometimes along the south. The levees were raised and flood control measures were improved after severe flooding in the wake of Typhoon Kathleen in 1947.

In any case, by the 1500s, St. Francis Xavier and other foreign missionaries recognized Ashikaga School as the most famous university in eastern Japan. The school was abolished after the Meiji Restoration and then converted into an elementary school when the site passed into city control in 1902. After a decade of preparatory work, the original grounds of Ashikaga School were beautifully restored in 1990 as a National Historic Site, a designation it received in 1921.

Buy[edit]
The principal local specialties of Ashikaga are: textiles, soba noodles, and now Coco Farm wines and a locally made citrus wine.
The most convenient place to shop for textiles is along the flagstone-paved (ishi-datami) streets that lead into Bannaji and Ashikaga Gakko. Natural indigo dyes are a local specialty, but look for some very nice natural brown dyes from walnut and chestnut as well. The less expensive varieties of each fabric are most likely made in China (and sometimes India).
A range of Coco Farm wines can be found in most supermarkets, but you might need to look in larger specialty liquor stores for the best (and more expensive) varieties, or at Coco Farms itself. Their labels range from the basic Coco Farm (¥1100-1200) and Oak Barrel (¥1200-1500) to the less widely available Coco Ima (¥1500-1800), Aubade (¥5000), and Novo sparkling wine (¥9000) lines.
The most convenient shopping for soba noodles and other edible souvenirs can be found in many shops along main street (Tōri 1-chome to 7-chome), running parallel and north of the JR railway tracks, and Grand Avenue (Gurando Tōri), which runs north directly out of the JR Ashikaga station. The gift shop at the Flower Park also offers a large variety of comestible souvenirs.
