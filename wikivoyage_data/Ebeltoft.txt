Ebeltoft with Ebeltoft Marina.
Ebeltoft is a city in Djursland in Denmark. Ebeltoft city, the "Piece de Resistance" of Djursland, restored the 1860 Battle Frigate "Jylland", a world-class maritime showpiece.


Understand[edit]
This city, which gained township rights in 1301, was not always a touristy destination, except for a few hundred people who came from Copenhagen and Aarhus in the summer season, staying in summer houses along the coast. They found the quaint ways of the "Molbos" (Danish equivalent of hayseeds or bumpkins) and the half-timbered houses embellished by hollyhock roses along cobblestoned streets, to their liking. Indeed, it is within living memory, that a town crier went around, bellowing the news of the day. Now people come from afar to see the frigate and the tiny perfect city hall from 1789, now a museum complete with the original dungeon, reached through a trap door in the floor of the reception hall.
Ebeltoft is not only steeped in history, but now also the location of The European Film College, which opened here in 1993 and is housed in the hills just on the outskirts of town. Unique restaurants abound in town, as well as outside, in the hills of "Molboland", now part of the Mols Bjerge National Park since 2008.

56.1991910.67381 Frigate Jylland, S.A. Jensens vej 4. The restored battle frigate is the largest wooden ship in the world. Located in a large marine centre, renovating and displaying historic vessels. The world's longest wooden ship is resting its enormous keel solidly on concrete, within meters of the sea, where it once fought a battle against the Austro-Prussian fleet, on behalf of King Fredrik the 7th in 1864. Otherwise, its 25 year active life as a commissioned battle frigate of the Royal Danish Navy, the "Jylland" was mostly used to ferry royal parties throughout the Kingdom, including Greenland, and European capitals. In 1886 it made its last of 5 cruises across the Atlantic to the Danish West Indian islands of St. Thomas, St. Croix and St. John, at which time it had been rebuilt to become a Royal Vessel and the 15 ton cannon in the royal dining room was removed, having been part of the total complement of 30 cannons on board. From 1925, the once mighty pride of Denmark, had a varied life, serving variously as accommodation for students and barracks for soldiers. By 1974 it had gone through five preservation committees, the last of which, had it towed across Kattegat to Ebeltoft, where it sat rotting further until 1984. After a nationwide fund-raising campaign and a five-year rebuilding, the result is a unique monument to a proud seafaring nation. The multi-million-dollar job practically hand built all woodwork, including righting the warped keel with a technically challenging method. The Jylland now stands in all its 3-masted glory as a part of a major marine complex along the waterfront which is part of Ebeltoft city center, and includes other vessels of historic value. Also historic ship restoration workshops. DKK 125. (updated Jun 2018)
