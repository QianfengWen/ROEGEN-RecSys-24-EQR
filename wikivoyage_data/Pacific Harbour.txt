Understand[edit]
Pacific Harbour
Pacific Harbour is the adventure capital of Fiji. It is the place to head to when you get bored of lying under the tropical sun and palm trees sipping coconut water and instead need an adrenaline rush. The residents of Suva often go to Pacific Harbour as a weekend getaway.

Get in[edit]
