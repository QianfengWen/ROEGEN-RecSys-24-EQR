For the US city, see Warminster (Pennsylvania).
Warminster is a delightful market town with a friendly population of around 18,000 (2011). The town has many interesting buildings, nearly all of which owe their existence to Warminster's great fame as a successful corn market for several centuries. It has for many years been a holiday haunt, providing visitors and tourists with beautiful countryside, ancient archaeological monuments, excellent recreational activities including walking and cycling and horse riding, plus shopping and plenty of enjoyable attractions large and small.


Understand[edit]
Warminster town-centre
The corn market ceased more than a hundred years ago and Warminster is now largely a residential town, with some light industry and military presence.
It is on the edge of Salisbury Plain and at the head of the picturesque Wylye Valley, between the historic cities of Bath (16 miles/26 km away) and Salisbury (20 miles/32 km away). Longleat House and Safari Park, and the Center Parcs resort of Longleat Forest are on its doorstep.
Warminster can be used as a base for visiting around 100 nearby places of interest, including Stonehenge, Avebury, Salisbury Cathedral, Bath Theatre Royal, the Science Museum at Wroughton.  Warminster is surrounded by open countryside. Cley Hill, Arn Hill, Battlesbury and Scratchbury Hills, in the immediate vicinity, boast Iron Age hill forts; Copheap Hill and Middle feature burial mounds and strip lynchets.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Warminster sits at the former crossing of the A36 (Bristol to Southampton) and the A350 (Chippenham to Poole) trunk roads. The A362 (from Midsomer Norton and Frome in Somerset) enters the town from the west, while the B390 (Shrewton to Heytesbury) and B3095 (Longbridge Deverill to Gillingham) roads are east and south of the town respectively. The A303 from Exeter to London (M3) also skirts the area south and east of Warminster. The opening of the Warminster Bypass (1988) has diverted much of the through traffic, particularly the stone lorries from the Mendip quarries. The former A36 through Warminster has been declassified and is now the B3414.
Warminster is 10 miles north-west of the A303 junction with the A36 at the Deptford Interchange. The A303 makes a seamless link to the M3 motorway west of Basingstoke. The M4 motorway, connecting London with South Wales, is approximately 25 mi (40 km) north of Warminster via the A350, intersecting at junction 17. The M5 motorway crosses the M4 at the Almondsbury Interchange, north of Bristol. The M5 northbound can also be reached via the A350, A429, Cirencester and the A417 joining at junction 11A.

Landmarks[edit]
The Obelisk
The Obelisk. A triangular monument of Bath stone, at the junction of Silver Street, Vicarage Street, and Church Street. It was erected in 1873 to commemorate the enclosure of the parish. It stands on the site of the former Emwell Cross Barn. A fountain (now disused), made of gun metal, in the shape of a lion's head, is featured on the east side of this unusual column. Former cattle and horse troughs around the base are now planted with colourful flowers. The Obelisk is flood-lit at night.
The Town Hall. Designed in the Jacobean style by Edward Blore, at the expense of the Marquess of Bath, and built 1830 to 1832. Donated to the town by Longleat in 1904. Once housed the law courts, with cells below, and a ballroom and function room. Sold to a private buyer in the 1970s. It was used a solicitor's offices, with a restaurant in the basement, and then a market. It was restored in 2016. Not open to the public.
War Memorial. At the junction of the Avenue and Portway stands the town's War Memorial, a tall Iona type cross of Box-ground Bath stone, standing 21 feet high and incorporating interwoven rope work and Egyptian art. The names of 115 men who gave up all in the First World War are commemorated. It was designed by Warminster stonemason Egerton Strong whose ancestors had worked with Sir Christopher Wren on the rebuilding of St. Paul's Cathedral after the Great Fire of London. The Warminster War Memorial site was donated by the 5th Marquess of Bath and 2,000 people attended the unveiling of the monument on 29th May 1921. The monument was re-dedicated on 6th November 1949 when the names of 52 townsmen who had paid the supreme sacrifice during the Second World War were added.
Churches[edit]
Parish Church of St. Denys
51.208526-2.1884841 The Parish Church of St. Denys, The Minster, Church St, BA12 8PQ, ☏ +44 1985 215460. Restored between 1887 and 1889. Outside the main door stands a venerable yew tree which is often quoted as being a thousand years old, although a study suggests it dates back to the 14th century.   (updated Feb 2018)
51.200526-2.1662972 St. John's Church, 95 Boreham Rd, BA12 9JY. At Boreham Road, designed by G.E. Street and built in 1865. It glows magnificently in the sunshine. The walls inside are illiustrated with mosaics of scriptural scenes designed by Ponting and made by J. Powell of Whitefriars. They were unveiled in 1912. Another was added to mark the 2000 Millenium. 
51.204739-2.181693 [formerly dead link] The Chapel of St. Lawrence, 2 Market Pl, BA12 9AP. The Chapel of St. Lawrence, at High Street, is a "Peculiar", existing outside direct Church of England control and held in trust by feofees since 1575, when they purchased the chapel for the town for £38 6s. 6d. A clock which has no face is installed in the tower and sounds the hours and the quarters. The chapel is open daily for prayer and evensong is held on the third Sunday of every month. The patronal service is held in August. A flower festival is usually presented inside the Chapel during the Christmas period, with donations being given to charity. The Friends of St. Lawrence Chapel organise many events and concerts at the Chapel. 
Country houses[edit]
Longleat House
There are many country houses surrounding Warminster, but only Longleat House and Stourhead are notable and open to the public.

51.1866-2.277464 Longleat House, BA12 7JS (follow the brown tourist signs once you get close), ☏ +44 1985 844400. "The greatest treasure house in the West Country" is on Warminster's doorstep, and, who knows, while visiting you might bump into the 7th Marquess of Bath, famous for his murals and his memoirs, and known locally, like his late father, for being a generous benefactor to Warminster. On the site of an Augustine priory, work commenced on the building of Longleat House in 1567.   
51.106111-2.3177785 Stourhead, near Mere, BA12 6QF, ☏ +44 1747 841152, stourhead@nationaltrust.org.uk. Stourton. Within easy reach of Warminster is Stourhead, a National Trust property with its magnificent 18th-century pleasure garden landscaped around a lake and complete with temples, grottos, statues and monuments such as the old Bristol High Cross.   
Other[edit]
Alfred's Tower, near Stourton, south west of Warminster. +44 1985 844785. Built in 1772 on the site where King Alfred the Great is said to have gathered his army prior to defeating the invading Danes in 878 AD.
Anzac War Graves. At Baverstock, Codford and Sutton Veny.
Australian Anzac Rising Sun Badge, chalk carving in hillside slope at Lamb Down, Codford. Visible from A36 road.
Beyond Harvest. In the Cornmarket shopping precinct is a bronze statue of a girl sat high on a stack of grain sacks, gazing dreamily towards Copheap, a beech clad hill to the north of the town. It is the work of the renowned sculptor Colin Lambert and was inspired by a conversation Colin had with local historian Danny Howell about Warminster's role as a great corn market for several centuries and the wealth of archaeological remains locally which include Iron Age hill forts (Cley Hill, Arn Hill, Battlesbury and Scratchbury) and Bronze Age remains such as the burial mound on Copheap.
Copheap. Copheap, the hill closest to Warminster, just north of the town, was purchased by the Warminster Urban District Council and soon afterwards it was agreed at a public meeting in 1947 that it should become a war memorial for the town. The purchase price was met by public subscription. Members of the R.A. and Old Comrades associations constructed the Path of Remembrance from Copheap Lane to the base of the hill, with regimental badges being incorporated into the walls at the lower end of the path. A lych gate at the entrance to Copheap is inscribed: "As an everlasting tribute of pride and gratitude to the sons of Warminster who gave their lives in the great World Wars this archway was constructed and Copheap preserved for the perpetual use and enjoyment of all."
Heaven's Gate. Overlooking Longleat Park is Heaven's Gate which can be approached on foot along a grassy pathway between pine trees, rhododendrons and azaleas. It was here that Bishop Ken, while a guest at Longleat House (1689 to his death in 1711), wrote his famous hymn Morning.
51.19-2.2616 Longleat Safari Park, ☏ +44 1985 844400. Vary by season: open daily through the summer and December, weekends in the spring and autumn, generally closed in winter.

Do[edit]
Arn Hill Nature Trail. Arn Hill rises to over 650 ft (200 m) above sea level and its beech woodland was donated to the town by the Marquess of Bath in 1920. The Wiltshire Wildlife Trust have established a Nature Trail around Arn Hill which passes a former lime kiln (now in ruins) and rises above the old-fashioned sheep walks of Kidnapper's Hole (a former chalk quarry which supplied the lime kiln). This two-mile circular footpath allows the enjoyment of the chalkland flora and its fauna. In the summer there are Fritillary and Small Blue butterflies to be seen as well as Burnet moths. The birds include skylarks, meadow pipits, tree-creepers and chiffchaffs. From the woods (which feature beech and some yews, holly and wayfaring trees) the path joins the open Plain area around the West Wilts Golf Course, where views look north and east over the vast expanse of Salisbury Plain, southeast to the Great Ridge Woods, south towards neighbouring Dorset, and west into the wetlands of Somerset. A wooden seat on the part of the down overlooking New Farm and Norridge Wood is a good vantage point for seeing the distant landmarks of Alfred's Tower near Stourhead, and the Mendip television transmitter near Wells on Mendip. Access to Arn Hill can be gained from paths off the Westbury Road or from Elm Hill where there is some car parking space. Admission to Arn Hill is free.
51.2053-2.18231 Athenaeum Theatre and Arts Centre, 18-20 High St, ☏ +44 1985 213891. The Athenaeum on the north side of the High Street was built in 1858 as a lecture hall and among its early speakers was Oscar Wilde who gave a talk on The House Beautiful. The present auditorium was built in 1879 as the Charles Bleeck Memorial Hall. From 1912 to 1964 it was the Palace Cinema and was also the venue for amateur operatics and drama. Eric Sykes, of television fame, was a regular cast member in a touring company which performed here in the 1940s. From 1969 onwards the building was used as an Arts Centre, with many famous names gracing the stage. Following a pause in proceedings in the 1990s, the Athenaeum re-opened in 2000 and is now held in trust as a registered charity by and for the people of Warminster. It is being promoted as a vibrant centre for the community. This fine Victorian theatre (complete with balcony), seating 220 persons, is certainly an intimate venue for all types of entertainment. Users have good backstage facilities, in-house lighting and dressing rooms. The Athenaeum plays host to the Warminster and District Film Society which offer once-a-month screenings. Tickets can be bought in advance or on the day the film is shown. Early booking is advised, as many of the films sell out quickly.   
Bird Watching. The keen ornithologist will not be disappointed with the feathered friends to be seen in the gardens, lanes, fields, woods and hills in and around Warminster. Yellow Hammers, Spotted and Green Woodpeckers, Ravens, Little Egrets, Herons, Barn Owls, Tawny Owls, and Buzzards are common, and if you're lucky you might spot a Red Kite.
 Blue Plaque Trail. Established by Warminster Civic Trust. This reflects Warminster's varied blend of architecture which covers several centuries of development. Plaques giving historical information have been placed on 20 buildings. Brochure, including further information, photographs and map, £2 from Warminster Information Centre, Central Car Park, Warminster. 
 [dead link] Brokerswood Country Park. 
Christmas Lights. Late Nov to early Jan the main streets of Warminster are illuminated by vivid colour by the annual Christmas Lights display. It is considered to be the best of its kind for miles around, surpassing neighbouring towns and cities. Strings of bulbs and decorations above East Street, Market Place, High Street, George Street and Silver Street are complemented by hundreds of illuminated Christmas trees above nearly every shop front. These are put up (and taken down) by a dedicated team of volunteers. The cost of the trees is met by shopkeepers and business people. A Christmas Market is held in the Civic Centre in late Nov with stalls, children's roundabouts, hot food and mulled wine, Santa's grotto, and a stage where local bands and choirs performed for the public. In the evenings in December, members of Warminster Lions Club, tour the town's residential streets with Father Christmas in a motorised "sleigh", handing out sweets to children and playing recorded festive music and carols, at the same time as Santa's helpers go door-to-door collecting small donations of money for local charities.
 [dead link] Civic Trust Garden. Conceived by Warminster Civic Trust. Just inside the main entrance to the Lake Pleasure Gardens at Weymouth Street is the Warminster Civic Trust Garden, where hardy plants, trickling water, a pergola and wooden seats and tables offer an oasis for relaxation. It was opened in 1996. The garden occupies the site of the former Warminster Open-Air Swimming Paths and the cost was met by several kind individuals, businesses and trusts. 
 Clay Pigeon Shooting. The Wylye Valley Shooting Ground, at Fisherton Delamere, off the A36 and the A303, ten miles east of Warminster, is the place for clay pigeon shooting, locally, on a regular basis, with cash prizes when charity events are held. 
Cycling. The Warminster vicinity provides excellent cycling opportunities for individuals, families or groups, along byways and other routes and through terrain as diverse as the Great Ridge Woods or Salisbury Plain. The latter is the chosen course for a challenge competition held at New Year, its route includes the roads in the northern part of Warminster parish. Many locals and visitors turn out to watch and cheer on the mountain bikers and other entrants. For those who prefer a less energetic ride the Wiltshire Cycleway features six circular routes. The Wylye Valley route, from Salisbury to Horningsham (on to Mere) is 41 miles and is indicated by blue background signs with white lettering and a bicycle motif. Welcoming pubs and village shops can be found along the way, and the routes link up with off-roading tracks and national byways. The Warminster Cycling Group run an annual event in the summer, often during National Bike Week, called The Warminster Wobble, which encourages everyone from toddlers upwards to get on their bikes. The Endura Trek Cyclosportive, based around the Longleat Estate, offering a 100-mile challenge (160-km), has now become, it seems, an annual event in the local calendar, each March.

The maximum group size is 20 and visitors are escorted at all times. Car parking and toilet facilities. Free admission. 
Lake Pleasure Grounds. In the heart of Warminster and only a few steps from the Market Place is the Lake Pleasure Grounds (known locally as the Town Park). It was established in 1924 (on the site of what had been the town's rubbish dump) and has always been one of the finest parks in Wiltshire; it is very popular with residents and visitors alike. The Were stream, which partly gives Warminster its name, flows through the Town Park. The main entrance is from Weymouth Street but access can also be gained from all sides including the Ridgeway Slope which was landscaped in 1977 and won an award from the Council for the Protection of Rural England. The Lake Pleasure Grounds feature tennis courts, a refreshments kiosk, and a bandstand where, during the summer months, visiting brass and other bands give free concerts on some Sunday afternoons. Also here is the Warminster Park Community Centre, used by many community groups including the Warminster Camera Club and the Wednesday Evening Bingo players. The boating lake has two islands giving a haven to ducks, swans and herons, who seem to ignore the human users of the pedaloes on the lake. The boathouse includes unisex toilets. There are three play areas in the Park: the King George V Playing Field has slides, swings, roundabouts, climbing frames, rocking horses and a paddling pool. Next to it is the Adventure Playground for the more energetic. The Skate Park is complete with half-pipes for use by skate-boarders, roller-skaters and BMX bikers. For those who want to take life at an easier pace there are seats situated alongside the path which circles the lake. The Morgan Memorial Fountain (now out of use), which stood in the busy Market Place until 1937 is now at the western end of the Lake Pleasure Grounds. It is adjacent the Civic Trust Garden. The Lake Pleasure Grounds are watched by CCTV, making this a safe place, particularly for families, and all is enhanced by the flower beds which provide colour all year round. Free admission.
Noggin, Nosh and Natter. Organised in conjunction with the Commercial Transport In Preservation group. On the last Wednesday evening of every July. An informal gathering of old, vintage, classic, and interesting vehicles, including cars, vans, buses, lorries, military vehicles, and motorcycles. With barbecue and some trade stalls.

Playing Fields. The Frank Moody Playing Field at Fore Street is much used for football and other games. St. George's Field, on the corner of Boreham Road and Woodcock Road, is another grassed open space, used for football, rugby and sports. Open space with football goal posts is adjacent The Heathlands at Bradley Road. There is a small grassed area adjacent the River Wylye, at the site of the former Smallbrook Mill, below Willow Crescent. Portway Lane Playing Field is another large grass area reserved for recreation and it also serves as the location for Jennings Fun Fair when it comes to Warminster every April. The National Trust field, known as Boreham Field, on the south side of Boreham Road is another popular open space for recreation.
Sailing. For those who like messing about in boats, Shearwater, a large man-made lake on the Longleat Estate, near Crockerton, is the venue for dinghy sailing by members of the Shearwater Sailing Club. A clubhouse and mooring area is to the north east of the lake. Regattas provide not only a colourful spectacle but also an exhilerating thrill.
 Smallbrook Meadows Nature Reserve. Maintained by the Wiltshire Wildlife Trust, at Smallbrook. Paths lead out of the eastern end of the Lake Pleasure Grounds into Smalbrook Meadows, a designated Local Nature Reserve managed by Wiltshire Wildlife Trust. It is also within the boundary of a Special Landscape Area (SLA). Situated next to the Were stream, measuring 13 hectares and divided into six small meadows, the reserve also features a large pond and some smaller ones. The diversity of habitat provides suitable conditions for many birds including kingfishers, sandpipers and dippers, and mammals such as the water vole. Avens, marigolds and flags are among the flora and at certain times the air is alive with orange tip butterflies, damsels and dragonflies. A small car park is situated adjacent the Henford Marsh road below Sandy Hollow. From here the path into the reserve has a hard surface and is wheelchair friendly. Free admission. 
Skywatching (UFOs). Strange noises heard over Warminster on Christmas Day 1964, started the 'Warminster Thing' phenomenon, with mass hysteria when people began seeing unidentified objects in the sky over the town, an invitation for the press and television to come and report on a regular basis. Cradle Hill, one mile north of Warminster, and Middle Hill (renamed Star Hill by UFO spotters) became gathering places for "sky watchers" for several years. Local journalist Arthur Shuttlewood wrote many books about flying saucers over Warminster and aliens who came calling on him. Ken Rogers, who formerly worked for the Daily Express, came to live in Warminster and also wrote a book about Warminster UFOs ('The Warminster Triangle'). The town has hosted exhibitions and conferences on the subject which continues to perplex the local community. The singer Robbie Williams visited Cradle Hill, looking for UFOs.
Walking and Rambling. Good walking has been enjoyed in and around Warminster for many years. There are hundreds of footpaths and nearly all are well signposted and adequately provided with stiles. Most landowners in the area are walker-friendly and there is a good choice of routes ranging from short town perambulations to long distance walks such as the Wessex Ridgeway. The Imber Range Perimeter Path which skirts around the military training area of Salisbury Plain is clearly defined with waymarkers and is a circular walk of 30 mi (48 km) that can be joined or left at many places. For those who want to walk as part of a group there are organisations such as the West Wilts Ramblers who arrange walks from advertised starting points on a regular basis.
 Warminster Art Society Exhibition. Warminster Art Society welcomes everyone from beginners to experts. During the winter months they hold workshops and lectures, and in the summer all-day outdoor painting sessions are held. Twice a year, usually in May and November, an exhibition of members' paintings and drawings is held in Warminster Library. Occasional exhibitions are held at the Athenaeum. 
Warminster Carnival. Warminster has been holding regular carnivals since 1896. Now an annual highlight in the town's calendar, the carnival is held on the last Saturday evening in October, a date specially chosen to attract some of the big illuminated floats from the world-famous carnival circuit in the neighbouring county of Somerset. Most of those taking part, though, are local entries comprising the carnival royalty, marching bands, motorised floats, majorettes and walking masqueraders. It is run entirely by a small but very dedicated group of volunteers who spend all year fund-raising to put the show on the road. Warminster Carnival brings out a huge crowd of spectators who line the town's main streets (Boreham Road, East Street, Market Place, High Street, George Street and Silver Street), making it the biggest-attended spectacle in the life of the town. Solicitations of small change from the crowds are counted up afterwards and donated to local charities. The carnival entries are judged en route and the best are awarded cups and prizes. Spectators can also vote for their favourite entry which is awarded the Danny Howell Spectators' Shield. The week preceding the carnival features several events (Fire Station Open Night, Bingo, Quiz Night, Spot the Mistake in the Shop Window Competition, Treasure Trail, etc.) promoting and helping to fund the grand parade. Jennings Fun Fair also visits the town during this time, occupying the Central Car Park. Details from Sandra Major, ☏ +44 1985 217050.
Warminster Festival. Held bi-annually, bringing together various artists and performers from all sections of the arts: readings, poetry workshops, story telling, music groups including classical and pop, arts and crafts and photography exhibitions, guided walks and garden trails.
Warminster in Bloom. The main streets of Warminster are a blaze of colour in the summer months with spectacular displays of hanging baskets, tubs and planters. The Warminster in Bloom competition is judged by local dignatories and nurserymen, and at a special ceremony prizes are awarded for the best displays of premises by shopkeepers, traders, pub landlords, and for the gardens of the residents.

The course is of a links character and gives players of all standards a fair test. 
The Woolstore Theatre. Codford, five miles east of Warminster, is the only village in England to have its own theatre. It is named the Woolstore Country Theatre, after the building's former use as a collection and sorting depot for fleeces. Drama, pantomimes, films and children's activities are all well-supported.
 Wylye Valley Arts Trail. Held bi-annually during the summer, giving locals and visitors the opportunity to visit talented artists, painters, sculptors, furniture makers, potters, glass blowers, gilders and jewellers, in their own homes and studios, as well as schools and barns, in Warminster and the surrounding villages, either to view their creations or commission or purchase works that will inspire, amuse, or prove a worthwhile investment.
