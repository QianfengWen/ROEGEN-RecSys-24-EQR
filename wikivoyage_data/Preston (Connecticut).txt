Preston is a town in Connecticut. It is a small, mostly rural town with multiple historic districts. It is between Montville and Ledyard, giving easy access to both Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Preston is a small town in southeastern Connecticut that originated in the 17th century. Following King Philip's War, the area was granted to colonists by Owaneco, son of the Mohegan sachem Uncas. For much of its history Preston was a farming town, but the decline of farming and the presence of two major tourist centers has caused a slow transition into a town focused on historical tourism.
Because Preston is home to over a dozen old cemetaries, many old buildings and churches, and the ruins of the Norwich State Hospital, it is sometimes alleged to be a haunted place.

Get around[edit]
A car is necessary in Preston. The nearby casinos are walkable and have shuttles to use, but Preston is a rural area with minimal public transportation options. Casino traffic makes walking inadvisable on the main roads. Off the main roads there is much less traffic, making it a nice place to take scenic walks. However, there will likely not be many tourist attractions within walking distance regardless.
