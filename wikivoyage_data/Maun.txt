Maun is an important village (with town status pending) in Botswana, and major gateway to the Okavango Delta.


Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
-19.972523.4311111 Maun Airport (MUB  IATA). Air Botswana operates regular services from Gaborone, Kasane, Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe and the South African city of Johannesburg. Airlink flies to Cape Town and Johannesburg. The airport passenger terminal is right in town, about two blocks from the major shopping centre.   (updated Nov 2023)
By car[edit]
You can get to Maun using the highway from Francistown.  At Nata, take the A3. (It is well sign-posted.)

By bus[edit]
There are daily buses from the bus rank in Gaborone to Maun at 05:30, 07:00, and 11:30 (recommend catching the 05:30 one, if you wish to get to Maun before dark). However, it’s a good idea to double check with the locals if the departure times have changed. As of 2023, the bus fare was P278 per person. Tickets are purchased on board and cannot be purchased in advance. The bus ride takes 9 to 10 hr. Buses from Francistown cost about P167 and take 6 hours, departing Francistown about once an hour from 07:30 to around 15:30.
If you're traveling from Namibia, smaller buses between Maun and Ghanzi cost about P50 and take about 4 hours; in Ghanzi you can connect with another bus from the Namibian border at Charles Hill/Mamuno (P40, 3.5 hours), but there is no organised transport from there towards Windhoek so you will have to resort to (probably paid) hitchhiking. If you get the first (08:30) bus out of Maun you will probably make it through to Windhoek in one day. There are also buses from Maun towards Shakawe and the Caprivi Strip.
If you want to travel from Maun to Kasane, it's best to get a Francistown/Gaborone bus and get off at Nata, where you can catch a northbound bus towards Kasane. The same thing works in the opposite direction; either way you'll need to start out as early as possible to be assured of making the connection.
The buses on major routes are pretty nice compared to many other African countries, but still not exactly luxurious: 5 non-reclining seats in a row, little leg-room and no bathrooms (however, they generally make frequent stops that are long enough to use a bathroom at the bus station). Smaller buses are even less comfortable and more likely to fill up completely. If travelling during the winter (Jun, Jul, and Aug) make sure to dress in layers, since it is freezing cold in the morning and toasty hot in the afternoon.

Get around[edit]
Maun from above
The core of Maun, say from Riley's Hotel to the airport, is walkable, but usually hot.  Further out than that — and a number of popular camps are to the north-east of town — you will want to get a ride.
There is a roundabout just a few hundred metres northeast of Riley's Hotel and the Tourist office. It is a useful reference point. From here, Tesheko Tsheko road runs southwest past Riley's to the bus station and market (at Tsaro St, ~1.5 km). Sekgoma Road runs southeast, crossing the Thamalakane River, past the Maun Education Park, and on to Francistown. Moeti Road runs northwest. And Sir Seretse Khama Road runs north to the Maun airport (~2.5 km), and thence to the popular camps, to Moremi, and to Shorobe.
Taxis and combis have blue licence plates. (Expect to pay P30 for a taxi to the camps north of town.)  In this area, especially on relatively high-speed roads, available taxis will honk gently once to see if you are interested.  To show that you want a taxi, stick your arm out parallel to the ground, perpendicular (and towards) the road, palm-down, and flap your fingers.  (Raising your hand will probably also work, but the finger-flapping is the way the locals do it.)
Note that taxis do not have a central dispatch system. Thus, if you want to call a taxi to fetch you from somewhere a bit remote, you need to have the mobile number of a taxi driver.  Also note that driving after dark is dangerous (due to animals on the road), so there will be fewer taxis running after dark.
Combis (vans) run from the bus station along ten specified routes.

Route 1 north to the airport, and the camps north of town
Route 7 southeast to Maun Educational Park

See[edit]
Maun Education Park is easy walking distance from downtown and well worth 2 to 3 hours either early morning or late afternoon. It is the hidden jewel of Maun, with 10 giraffes, wildebeest, kudu, impala, zebras, lechwe, warthogs and great birding.

Sports Bar is good for a more formal, European style dining experience.
Try local dishes such as papa (maize meal- the staple food), magunya (Fried dough balls- available for around 50 thebe), seswa (shredded meat- usually beef or goat), morogo (green, leafy vegetable similar to spinach). These foods are available ready made at most supermarkets or at local eateries such as "Choice" across from Riley's Garage.

The eating area is well shaded and relaxed, with basic furniture and serene atmosphere.

 Wine and Dine. Great way to try a lot of different local dishes at one time! As well as a Mopane worm if you are up for the challenge! 
Sleep[edit]

A number of campsites and hotels popular with travellers are clustered on the road to Moremi and Shorobe, about 6-10 km north-east of Maun Airport. The landmark for this cluster is a roundabout on the south side of the Thamalakane River, just after the road crosses from the north side.
