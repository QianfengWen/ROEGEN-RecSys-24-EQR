Berwick-upon-Tweed (pronounced "Berrick") is a town in Northumberland, two miles south of the border with Scotland. Berwick is on the north bank of the Tweed and nowadays forms a combined town with Tweedmouth and Spittal on the south bank. The south bank is industrial but the old town centre is well preserved.  It's the main town for nearby villages in the Scottish Borders, and along the Tweed valley inland.


Understand[edit]

Berwick had a population of 13,170 in 2021. In medieval times it frequently changed hands, and was protected with stout walls.

History[edit]
Berewick means the patch of land reserved for growing the lord of the manor's personal barley, to be made into his bread and beer - mess with it at your peril. (Just to spell out his sense of ownership, the term "lord" derives from hlāfweard, the loaf-guardian, while his lady is hlǣfdige, she who digs or kneads the loaf). In Anglo-Saxon times, Northumbria ruled Berwick and all the way to Edinburgh, but this territory was won by Scotland in 1018. For the next 400 years the town was a shuttlecock, changing hands over a dozen times as England and Scotland were back and forth at war, so the town walls were built and the castle strengthened in 1318. The Scots were ousted for the last time in 1482 when Berwick became nominally an independent town, but in reality under the English thumb. The Elizabethans were sufficiently wary of Scotland to rebuild the walls, and render them proof against artillery as well as bows and arrows, in an age when many cities were tearing down their medieval bastions. So, like those of  Londonderry built a few decades later, the walls are about 400 years old and in good condition.
In 1603 came the Union of Crowns of England and Scotland, and in 1707 the Parliaments and executives were combined, though never the legal systems. Berwick formed its own English county north of the Tweed while the south bank was the strange entity of Islandshire, governed from Holy Island or Lindisfarne. Berwick incorporated the south bank in 1835 and became part of the county of Northumberland in 1889. More significantly, the railway spanned the Tweed from 1850, binding the town to the smokestack economy of the south, and (as at Newcastle) demolishing most of the castle to make way for it. In the 20th century Berwick promoted itself as a seaside resort. The painter LS Lowry often visited.

By train[edit]
Berwick is on the East Coast Mainline, with trains once or twice an hour on their way between  Newcastle and Edinburgh. These trains variously start from London King's Cross (3 hr 45 min), Bristol,  Birmingham or Leeds, and some continue to Dundee and Aberdeen. Other trains hurtle through non-stop, change at Newcastle. Locally the trains may also stop in  Morpeth and Alnwick to the south, and Dunbar to the north. 
55.775-2.0111 Berwick railway station  is west side of town overlooking the Royal Border Bridge across the Tweed, which isn't the border at this point. There's a staffed ticket office and machines, cafe and toilets. The two platforms are an island reached by a footbridge with lifts.

By coach[edit]
There is a single National Express coach service to Berwick, number 591 between London and Glasgow, as of July 2023. Journey times are approximately 9 hr from London or 2 hr 30 min from Glasgow. The southbound arrival/departure (from Scotland, to London) is at around lunchtime and the northbound arrival/departure (from London, to Scotland) is in early evening. The coach stop for Berwick is located at Golden Square in the town centre on the north side of the new bridge.

By bus[edit]
Arriva Bus X15 runs from  Newcastle every two hours, taking 2 hr 30 min to Berwick via Morpeth, Alnwick and Scremerston. 
Arriva Bus X18 also runs from Newcastle two or three times per day, taking around 3 hr 50 min to Berwick. This is a slower but more scenic route which operates via the coast and is branded as "Coast and Castles". During the summer months Travelsure also operate journeys on the X18 route between Alnwick and Berwick, resulting in a bus every two hours between the coastal villages around Seahouses and Berwick. 
Borders Bus 253 runs from Edinburgh every two hours, taking 2 hr 15 min to Berwick via Haddington, Dunbar, Eyemouth and Burnmouth. 
From Galashiels, Borders Bus 67 runs hourly to Berwick via  Kelso and Coldstream, while Bus 60 runs every two hours via  Melrose and Duns.
Bus 267 runs six times a day from Wooller via Etal and Duddo, while Bus 464 takes the direct route via Scremerston. 
Bus 235 runs every two hours north along the coast to Eyemouth, Coldingham and St Abbs. Bus 477 occasionally runs to Lindisfarne, times depend on the tides with services running most days (except Sundays) during the peak summer season (July/August) and most Wednesdays and Saturdays at other times of year.
The bus terminus is outside the railway station; all routes except for the 235 and 253 towards Eyemouth additionally serve Golden Square which is closer to the town centre.

By road[edit]
By road from the south follow A1, which is only partly dual north of Newcastle; cyclists may use it. This nowadays bypasses Berwick, so for town centre branch off at Scremerston onto A1167 and follow the historic Great North Road into town. But for the north end (eg Travelodge) use the bypass.

Get around[edit]
Berwick is easy and attractive to walk around, but you need your own wheels for outlying attractions.
Both Scottish and English concessionary bus passes are valid on the local cross-border buses to Eyemouth and Coldstream.
Taxi firms are Station Cabs (+44 7719 640096), Fifes (+44 1289 307188), Woody's (+44 1289 547009), Mack's (+44 1289 303990), A1 Cabs (+44 1289 308524) and Waughy's (+44 7507 399134).

See[edit]
An ideal holiday spot
The old town within the walls has many 18th and 19th century buildings. Look for Holy Trinity Church (Anglican, 1660), Cockburn Tower and Town Hall.
The town walls were built in the early 14th century but fell derelict. They were rebuilt from 1560, to withstand artillery instead of arrows, and are well-preserved. The only substantial medieval fortification to remain is the castle, just outside the walls and next to the railway station. Castle and walls are maintained by English Heritage: they're free to stroll any time.
55.7649-1.98421 The Lighthouse, completed in 1826, is simply a harbour light, a 13.5-m tower. It sits at the end of the 2877-ft (877-m) dog-legged "pier" which is more correctly a breakwater, as it's built over ribs of rock and vessels can't dock alongside. The view east is of grey heaving waters towards Denmark, and west is the Royal Border Bridge that doesn't span the border, for a hat-trick of misnomers.
The riverside is scenic along its north bank, south bank is industrial. Follow it upstream from the pier to the original road bridge of 1610 (now southbound only), the Royal Tweed road bridge (1925, renovated 2000), and under the Royal Border Bridge (1850) the railway viaduct. A large colony of mute swans (Cygnus olor) glide up and down the tidal river. No, they're not Bewick's swans, which visit Britain but prefer tundra.
55.771-2.00112 Berwick Barracks and Main Guard, Parade TD15 1DF, ☏ +44 1289 304493. Mar-Oct: daily 10AM-5PM. These barracks were built 1717-21 against Jacobite incursions. They were used on and off until 1963, latterly by the King's Own Scottish Borderers. They now house a museum, and a selection of art from the Burrell Collection in Glasgow. Adult £6.50, child £3.90, conc £5.90.   (updated Jan 2021)
55.811-2.0343 The Border on the A1 is just a draughty layby with trucks pounding past, don't bother stopping for a photo. But a short walk brings you to the most northerly point of England, on the coast. The railway separates A1 and coast so either access via Marshall Meadows or walk a mile north from Haven Holiday Park. The border is just a stile over a fence. Keep walking north into Scotland for views from the clifftops.
55.842-2.0754 Burnmouth, Eyemouth and St Abbs are attractive fishing villages set into the cliffs north of the border, see separate page. Unlike Gretna Green on the other side of the country, Burnmouth and the border farm of Lamberton never became popular for elopement weddings, as it was easier for 18th-century couples to sail to Edinburgh.
55.7639-2.11655 Paxton House, Paxton TD15 1SZ (Off B6461 one mile west of border), ☏ +44 1289 386291. Apr-Oct: daily 10AM-5PM. This grand Palladian mansion was built 1758-66 by Robert Adam and furnished by Chippendale. In 1780 m'lud came home from his Grand Tour with a vast art collection, but died before it was even unpacked. The East Wing was built in 1812 to house the collection plus the library. The original collection has dispersed but the gallery displays works of the National Galleries of Scotland in 19th century style. The house is set in extensive grounds.   (updated Jan 2021)

55.7822-2.35588 Duns Castle. Just north of that village was built in 15th-16th century, but relentlessly made over in Gothic in the 19th. It's now an events venue with no interior tours, but you can visit the nature reserve on its north side. This is set beside an artificial lake called "Hen Poo" though wildfowl are the main culprits.   (updated May 2022)
55.721824-2.1502879 Norham Castle, Norham TD15 2JY. Substantial ruin of a castle built in 1121 to protect the Bishop of Durham's lands here (until 1844 Norham along with Lindisfarne and the Farne Islands were exclaves of County Durham). It was repeatedly assaulted, wrecked and rebuilt until 1596 when it was left derelict. It's scenically perched on a mound above the river and JMW Turner made several paintings of it in the early 19th century. Free.   (updated Jan 2021)

Watch Scottish football but in England. Berwick Rangers are one of the few soccer teams to play in another country's league system, though they are less visible since being relegated from the Scottish professional leagues in 2019. They now languish in the Lowland League, the fifth tier of Scottish football. Their home ground is Shielfield Park, capacity 4100, on Etal Road half a mile south of the road bridges and definitely in England. The ground is adjacent to that of Tweedmouth Rangers, another cross-border club, playing in the sixth tier East of Scotland League. Revving round and round the Shielfield Park pitch perimeter, preferably not while someone's trying to take a throw-in, are Berwick Bandits Speedway Club.
Rugby union: Berwick RFC play in Scottish National League 2, the amateur game's third tier. They play at Scremerston 3 miles south of town, even more definitely in England.

Make peace with Russia. In 1966 a modern myth got started that Berwick-upon-Tweed was still at war with Russia. Historically as the town changed hands between Scotland and England, legislation and proclamations referred to "England, Scotland and the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed" to avoid ambiguity. It was claimed that the 1853 declaration of the Crimea War specifically included Berwick whilst the 1856 peace treaty did not. (This was tosh, as an Act of 1746 had clarified that the term "England" in legislation always included Berwick and Wales unless otherwise specified.) The story was embellished with a supposed Soviet official visit to sign a peace treaty with the mayor, who declared "Tell the Russians they can sleep easy in their beds". The myth gained credence in a Cold War era of the Cuban Missile Crisis, The Mouse That Roared and From Russia With Love so it's a pity it wasn't filmed, with Peter Sellers in all the main roles.
