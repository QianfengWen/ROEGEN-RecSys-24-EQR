Bolzano (Italian) or Bozen (German),  (Ladin: Balsan, Bulsan) is the capital city of South Tyrol, the German-speaking region in the northern part of Italy. Bolzano is the largest city in the region. Its archaeology museum is famous worldwide as the home of the alpine iceman "Ötzi". It is also known as the Italian Capital of Christmas thanks to its characteristic Christmas market. Bolzano's population is around 100,000 (140,000 including the metropolitan area). 25% of inhabitants speak German as their mother tongue; the population of German-speakers is much higher in the non-urban parts of the province (up to more than 90% in some areas), making the city and province officially bilingual.
Together with Innsbruck, Bolzano is the capital of the Alps because the seat of the Alpine Convention[dead link] is there. The world-famous Museum of Archaeology with the Iceman and the Messner Mountain Museum's main seat make Bolzano a world city of mountaineering history and culture.


Districts[edit]
The city is administratively composed of 5 districts (City Centre - Bozner Boden/Piani di Bolzano-Rentsch/Rencio, Oberau/Oltrisarco-Haslach/Aslago, Europa-Neustift/Novacella, Don Bosco, Gries-St.Quirein/San Quirino). Alternatively, for tourism it can be divided into 6 areas:

City Centre (Historical Centre-Altstadt-Dorf/Villa-Zwölfmalgreien/Dodiciville-Runkelstein Castle) Here there are the most important things to see, museums, theatres, restaurants, hotels and stores. The heart of the City Centre is Walther square.
Rentsch-Rencio (Rentsch-Rencio/St. Magdalena-S. Maddalena/Bozner Boden-Piani di Bolzano) This is the most German part of the city with St. Magdalena on the hills with its vineyard and the nice Rentsch district centre. Behind the rail station isn't the Bozner Boden district. There are a lot of nice hotels, restaurants and guesthouses.
Kohlern-Colle Bozen's/Bolzano's home mountain, is a terrible mountain resort.
Bolzano/Bozen
Gries (Gries historical centre/Fagen-Fago/Guntschna-Guncina/Moritzing-San Maurizio/north-western Bozen's/Bolzano's countryside) Culture, art, nature and wine paradise in a small area. Gries was a "Kurort" (health resort) during the Habsburg's Empire.
New City or West Bolzano (St.Quirein/Europa - Novacella-Neugries/Don Bosco with Kaiserau/Bivio countryside and Sigmundskron/Firmian Castle) The Italian Bolzano is here. A lot of restaurants.
South Bolzano/Bozen (Oberau/Oltrisarco-Haslach/Aslago-Pfarrhof/Maso della Pieve-St Jakob/San Giacomo) Oberau is a nice districts built in 1900s with good restaurants. In Bolzano South area there is the airport and the fair.
Understand[edit]
History[edit]
First inhabited by the Rhaetians, the area was settled by the Romans in 15 BC, by General Nero Claudius Drusus, who gave his name to the first settlement in the area (an army camp with a bridge by the river Eisack-Isarco). The village founded nearby was called Bauzanum. The region of South Tyrol was historically settled by ethnic Germans and Ladins.
Bolzano has been a trading point since its foundation owing to its location between the two major cities of Venice and Augsburg. In 1262 it was elevated to a Stadt (city). In 1363 Bolzano became part of the Habsburg monarchy as part of the county of Tyrol. Four times a year a market was held and traders came from the south and the north. The mercantile magistrate was therefore founded in 1635. Every market season two Italian and two German officers (appointed from the traders who operated there) held this office. The city was a cultural crossroads at that time.
In 1919, after World War I, Bolzano was annexed by Italy against the will of the native population who had chosen to join the new German Republic of Austria.  Starting in 1926, after the rise of fascism, the region's ethnic Germans were subjected to a policy of forced italianization. The fascist dictatorship encouraged the moving of many ethnic Italians to the city from other parts of Italy (primarily from Northern Italy) in an attempt to italianize the whole region. After World War II Bolzano was again assigned to Italy but this time the German-speaking population demanded self-determination and afterwards accepted the autonomy statute, which is ensured internationally. After decades of tension, particularly in the 1950s and the 1980s, which included minor terrorist plots, Bolzano is now a multilingual European city open to the future, hosts students from all over the world and therefore hosts a lot of interesting cultural events. For this reason Bolzano sought to become European Capital of Culture in 2019.

Culture[edit]
Bolzano is constantly among the top-ranked cities in Italy when it comes to quality of life. It has one of Europe's lowest unemployment rates, excellent services and a wonderful landscape. Many Italians say they would like to live in Bolzano. However it is recognized that the city is quite expensive compared to Italian standards.
Bolzano has many special features:  it's an Italian city with Austrian flair. In the city centre you will mostly hear people speak German or Austro-Bavarian. Nowadays, however, Italian- and German-speaking people are living together in bilingual Bolzano. Generally "Bozner" or "Bolzanini" are friendly and helpful. Most German-speaking people can speak Italian but Italian-speaking people are unlikely to be able to speak German. Nevertheless many young people can also speak English and a few can speak French too. In South Tyrolean schools the learning of the second language (Italian for German-speakers and vice-versa) and of English is compulsory.

The coldest month of the year is January (min -6.2°C/20.8°F, max 5.0°C/41.0°F, average 0.0°C/32.0°F), the warmest is July (min 15.1°C/59.2°F, max 29.4°C/84.9°F, average 22.0°C/71.6°F). The annual average is 11.6°C/52.9°F. The maximum and minima are -17°C and +40°C.

By car[edit]




When not to go to Bolzano by car
If you are staying on holiday elsewhere in South Tyrol and there is rainy (or snowy) weather well, you shouldn't decide to go on a trip to Bolzano by car because 90% of the people like you have the same idea. All city access roads get congested already early in the morning and finding a parking space results a forlorn hope.


Highway A22 (Autostrada del Brennero/Brennerautobahn) from south and from north lead to Bolzano, however they get congested during the Christmas market and especially during the ski season. Highway has two exits in Bolzano, normally if you're coming from the north it's better to choose the Bolzano Nord/Bozen Nord (North) exit, while from South it's better the Bolzano Sud/Bozen Süd exit. Follow the direction on the signs in order to reach the city centre or your accommodation. If you're coming from Meran you the better way is taking the MeBo freeway - there are two exits in Bolzano (Eppan/Appiano exit for West Bolzano and Gries, and Bozen Süd/Bolzano final exit for Bolzano South and the city centre). For day trips to Bolzano it's probably better to leave your car in the Parking "Centro BZ Mitte". Normally every hotel has its own parking.

Get around[edit]
46°29′2″N 11°20′24″EMap of Bolzano
The city centre is not big and so it can be discovered on foot. The best way to discover every corner of the city is on foot but in order to reach other areas inside the city using the public system is a good idea - also because the public transport system is efficient and the means of transport run on time and are clean.

By bus, train and cableway[edit]

Within Bolzano, you can get a single trip ticket (including a second trip, if within 45 minutes after the printing) for the bus for €1.50.

The square is surrounded by buildings in Austrian style. At centre of the square is situated the statue of Walther von der Vogelweide. The square was built in 1808 during Bavaro-Napoleon's domination. The square changed name five times: Maximilan square dedicated to the King of Bavaria (1808-1815), Johannes square dedicated to the Kaiser's brother Archduke Johann (1815-1901), finally Walther square (1901-1925). During the Fascist period the name was changed and the square took the name of Victor Emmanuel III of Italy. In 1946 the name changed for the last time (Our Lady square) before becoming Walther square in 1947.  Walther came back to the Walther square only in 1984. In 1985 the first McDonald's in Italy opened on Walther square, in the place of the current Stadtcafé (a more modern McDonald's is now located in South Bolzano/Bozen).

A controversial monument on the other bank of the Talfer river and was built by the Fascist Italy in 1928 as a nationalist symbol and for celebrate the Italian victory during World War I. On the front, written in Latin, is a sentence which affirms the Italic superiority over the Germanic people. During the 1960s and 1970s some South Tyrolean activists attempted to damage the monument but without effects. In 2002 the city administration wanted to reconcile the population of the two ethnic groups changing the name to Peace Square. The majority of the Italians didn't appreciate the gesture and opposed. The Italian right-wing parties (for the name dedicated to the Italian victory during World War I) wanted a referendum which was won by the old name. Now the tables display the name Victory Square (formerly Peace Square). Now the monument is under protection of the Italian state. There is a table on the way from the Talfer Bridge that explains how the City of Bozen feels about the monument. The Italian Ministry for Conservation of Ancient Monuments would not allow the city to post the tables on the grilles in front of the Monument.

Stay safe[edit]
Bolzano is one of the safest cities in Italy and generally tourists don't have problems. Beware of African migrant vendors in the streets: most of the merchandise they sell is imitation luxury goods. You can get a very high fine in Italy for purchasing imitation goods.
Stay away from the area around the central railway station and the surrounding area (Via Garibaldi, Piazza Verdi, Viale Trento) at night. Especially in the Station Park and the Garibaldi Street - drug dealers, homeless people and illegal immigrants are often seen. However, common sense should be enough when you will stay in Bolzano safely. Pickpocketing is not common.
Beware of groups of youths in the areas of South Bolzano and the New City but also in the City Center (especially on Piazza dell'Erba where most of the pubs, bars and clubs are - especially on week-ends, when pub-fights can break out, and young drunks can bother you. People usually will not harm you when they see that you are not from Bolzano.

Respect[edit]
Bilingual road sign
Bolzano is officially a bilingual city - That means there is most likely a German and Italian name for everything! Some tourists could have problems understanding the city's unique character. Guests interested in the (recent) history of South Tyrol are appreciated, but try to stay neutral discussing this with locals and always avoid asking the German-speaking people to explain why German is official language in a region belonging to Italy, and definitely don't say things like 'But this is Italy!' Bolzano/Bozen is an international model of bilingualism and multicultural understanding, and major ethnic tensions are a thing of the past.

Connect[edit]
There are a lot of telephone boxes in which you can use Italian and international phone cards. Call centres also exist, although these are used more by migrants than tourists. Cell phone coverage in the city is excellent. A lot of hotels offer wireless connections. The area code is 0471 (that of Italy is +39) while the postcode is I-39100.
Internet cafes are scarce, with virtually no open Wi-Fi connections in the city centre.

Cope[edit]
Post office[edit]
In Bolzano there is at least one post office in each district. The two main post offices are open from M-F 08:00-18:30 and Sa 08:00-12:00 - on Sunday closed. Other post offices are open from M-F 08:00-13:30 and Sa 08:00-12:30. The post office at Fair Quarter is open from M-F 08:00-14:00.

Post Office, Duca-d'Aosta-Straße/Via Duca d'Aosta, 104 In the new city in front of Hadrianplatz/Piazza Adriano.

There are above 60 bank branch offices. The most important banks in South Tyrol are the Südtiroler Sparkasse (Savings Bank), the Südtiroler Volksbank(People's Bank), the Raiffeisen Bank and the Bank für Trient und Bozen (Bank of Trento and Bolzano). The offices are open normally 08:05–12:55 and 14:45-16:00/16:30. Banks are closed on Saturday and Sunday (a few banks are open on Saturday). At every bank and other places you can find simply an ATM.
