Ponce lies southeast of Arecibo and is a two hour drive through the Cordillera Central, the mountain range that crosses Puerto Rico from east to west. That is not easy driving. An easier drive is 2 hours and 20 minutes long, via the western coast on PR-2 west then South, then east, to avoid driving through the mountain range.
