A local bus firm called Valley Retriever runs a bus service to and from Newport, linking the city to Salem and Portland; this service is linked to the Greyhound network and can be booked through them.  Greyhound also offer a bus link from Eugene.

By car[edit]
There are a few different ways that you can arrive in Newport by road, and here are the three main ones that any tourist should know about.

Coming from the Northern Oregon Coast, just take Hwy 101 until you run right on into it.
Coming from the Southern Oregon Coast, just take Hwy 101 until you run right on into it.
If you are coming from either direction on Interstate 5, take the exit marked ORE 34. It will be accompanied by signs such as "Corvallis" and "Oregon State University". Upon taking this exit, follow Hwy 34 towards Corvallis until you see signs for HWY 20, proceeded by signs such as "Oregon Coast" and "Philomath". Once you get on HWY 20, all you do is follow it right through Philomath and all the way to Newport. It is a beautiful drive and it takes you through a few really quaint little towns such as Blodgett, Eddyville, and even parts of Toledo.
Get around[edit]

When it comes to getting around in Newport, it all depends on the weather. The temperature varies a bit from season to season, but it pretty much stays between 50 and 70 degrees throughout the whole year. When the rain holds off, walking and biking are huge modes of transportation, and they sure do save you some money too. HWY 101 would have to be the easiest way of getting just about anywhere in Newport that you wanted to go. If you take it to the South side of town, it will take you across the bridge to our famous Aquarium and Rogue Brewery. However, if you choose to see the light house or the bayfront, right before you cross the Newport Bridge, HWY 101 will also give you the opportunity to hook to the right and follow the signs that will lead you to the two destinations. All of the grocery stores and convenience stores are mainly located on HWY 101 as well, along with a few pretty good restaurants. A few other streets to look for while you're in Newport are:

Ocean Dr.: This street will take you along the northern part of Newport's Coast. While on it you will located a number of very nice hotels to choose from, along with one of Newport's most famous restaurants, "Georgie's Bar and Grill", towards the northern end of it.
Eads St.: This street you will find yourself passing if you are coming into town from HWY 20. It is a rather short street, but will give you a nice idea of what our neighborhoods are like, along with presenting to you Newport's high school.
Bayfront Dr.: The name of the street says it all, but in case you have never heard of Newport's Bayfront, this road will take you right along it, showing off all of Newport's unique and enjoyable antique and entertainment shops. You will find certain attractions such as "Ripley's Believe It or Not" and "Wax Works" on this street as well.
