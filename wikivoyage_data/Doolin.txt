Doolin (Dúlainn) is a small community in County Clare on the west coast of Ireland. The main attraction is the Cliffs of Moher, and it's also an access point for reaching the Aran Islands and The Burren. Doolin pubs have a lively trad music scene.
There isn't really a village here, but several small collections of buildings: the Harbour, Fisher Street leading up from it, Fitz's Cross 1 km inland, and Roadford another km inland. Another 7 km brings you to the short street that is Lisdoonvarna (Lios Dúin Bhearna, "fort of the gapped keep"), also described on this page.


Get in[edit]
The main road is N67, which branches off M18 at Ennis and loops north through Ennistymon. The turn off to Doolin is 5 km south of Lisdoonvarna while N67 continues through Ballyvaughan and Kinvarra to Galway.
A slow scenic route is along the cliff tops, northwards branching off N67 at Ennistymon for Lahinch, Liscannor and Cliffs of Moher to Doolin, and southwards branching off at Ballyvaughan to arrive via Black Head and Fanore. 
Bus 350 follows that slow route from Galway six times a day via Kinvarra, Ballyvaughan, Fanore, 53.029-9.291 Lisdoonvarna, Doolin village and pier, Cliffs of Moher, Liscannor, Lahinch, Ennistymon, Corofin and Inagh to Ennis.
53.015-9.4052 Doolin Pier has summer ferries to the Aran Islands, for foot passengers only. The islands also have ferries from County Galway so you don't have to return the same way.

Doolin is a straggly but small place. It's 7 km to Lisdoonvarna or to the Cliffs of Moher. 
North Clare can be a great place to cycle and Doolin is the start of 4 cycle routes.

The Paddywagon is a minibus that shuttles between Doolin pier and village, Cliffs of Moher, Kilconnell, Liscannor, Lahinch and Ennistymon. So you can ride one way and hike the other, and avoid bringing a vehicle to the crowded Cliffs car park. It runs every couple of hours, adult €8.

See[edit]
Crab Island is the uninhabited lump 500 m off Doolin pier. Nothing there except the remains of a 19th century police post, showing that Victorian authorities were as concerned with seaborne goings-on as on land.
53.0038-9.38741 Doonagore Castle. Closed. This 16th-century tower house is nowadays a private holiday home and not open to the public, but there are great views from the single-track lane that runs by it. Don't try to park along here.   (updated May 2020)
53.04148-9.345092 Doolin Cave (Poll an Eidhneáin), Craggycoradon East, Doolin, ☏ +353 65 707 5761. Daily 10AM-4PM. Show cave with a remarkable stalactite 7.2 m long, one of the longest in the world. And actually that's all there is, the cave is otherwise undecorated. Tours start on the hour with the last at 3PM. Adult €14, child €7.  (updated May 2020)
52.972-9.4263 Cliffs of Moher (7 km south of Doolin). Daily 08:00-dusk. The cliffs stretch away north and south, but here they reach 214 m above the sea. There are three main viewing areas, free if you can get here without a car (see "Get around"). The charge covers parking, use of the visitor centre (which has a cafe), and viewing from O'Brien's Tower, built in 1835 as an observation tower for tourists. Views take in the Aran Islands, Galway Bay, Maum Turk Mountains and the Twelve Bens to the north in Connemara, and Loop Head to the south. The cliffs were built 320 million years ago by the silt of a river delta, compacted into beds of shale and sandstone. Watch for puffins, hawks, gulls, guillemots, shags, ravens and choughs. Adult €8.  (updated May 2020)
See Lahinch for the cliffs further south to Kilconnell and Liscannor.
53.025-9.2894 Spa Wells, Rathbaun, Lisdoonvarna. May-Aug: daily 10AM-1PM. Lisdoonvarna was a spa in Victorian times thanks to these pungent spring waters. Donation. (updated May 2020)

Do[edit]
Cliffs of Moher
Visit the Aran Islands. April-Oct there are several daily sailings from Doolin pier, for day trips or point-to-point ferry rides, foot passengers only. Boats take about 30 min to Inis Oirr, 75 min to the largest island Inis Mór. Inis Meáin is in between but takes 90 min as the boat calls on its way back from Inis Mór. Adult fares are €20-25.
The main operator is  Doolin Ferry Company, ☏ +353 65 707 5555, info@doolinferry.com. Two other operators' websites redirect you to Doolin Ferry Company. (updated May 2020)
Sail to Cliffs of Moher: Apr-Oct they also have hour-long boat trips beneath the cliffs, adult €15.
Walk along the cliff tops between Doolin, Cliffs of Moher, and Kilconnell near Liscannor. Guided walks led by a local farmer also go as far as the Cliffs visitors centre.
Caving: the real thing, not show-caves. The limestone bedrock is riddled with caves, and Poll na gColm is Ireland's longest, with over 12 km of mapped passages. You need suitable training and equipment; the caves can flood rapidly in wet weather. They continue west beneath the sea, and the Green Holes of Doolin just north of the harbour is one that non-cavers can peer into through a gash in the rock.
 Doolin Folk Festival, The Barn at Hotel Doolin, Teergonean. 3 days in mid-June. €65/day, €156/3-day ticket. (updated May 2024)
Doolin Motorcycle Fest
Matchmaker Festival[dead link] throughout September in Lisdoonvarna continues a tradition from 1831 of trying to fix up the local farm boys once they'd finished the harvest.
