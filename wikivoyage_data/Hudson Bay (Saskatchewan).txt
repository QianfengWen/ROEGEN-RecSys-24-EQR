Hudson Bay is a town of 1,500 people (2011) in East Central Saskatchewan, Canada.


Understand[edit]
Hudson Bay is nestled in the Red Deer Valley, between the Porcupine and Pasquia Hills in northeastern Saskatchewan. European settlement began in the 18th century, with fur trading posts being established east and south of the present-day townsite. The town of Hudson Bay was established when the Canadian Northern Railway, a predecessor to the Canadian National Railway (CN), arrived in 1909.
Hudson Bay's economy is based on forestry, agriculture, processing and eco-tourism, and has claimed the title of "Forestry Capital of Canada" as well as "Moose Capital of the World" due to the abundance of wildlife in the area.
