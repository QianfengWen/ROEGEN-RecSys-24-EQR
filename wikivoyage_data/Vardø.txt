Not to be confused with Vårdö of Åland or neighbouring Vadsø.

Vardø.
Vardø is a town in Finnmark. It is the easternmost point of Norway; as strange as it may seem, it lies east of Istanbul! Vardø is one of the few towns with an Arctic climate within Norway. Annual average temperature is 1.3 °C (34.3 °F), while monthly average for July is 9 °C (48 °F). Because of the rough climate there are no natural trees in Vardø.
