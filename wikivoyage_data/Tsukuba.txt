Tsukuba Center and Mt.Tsukuba
Tsukuba (つくば) is a city in Ibaraki, to the north of Tokyo, Japan.


Understand[edit]
Tsukuba is a modern town built around the University of Tsukuba — one of the most respected public universities in Japan and home to three Nobel Prize winners and a synchrotron. The city is also located at the foot of Mount Tsukuba which offers scenic views, hiking, and lifts. The surrounding area is mostly agricultural.

Tourist information sites[edit]
The city government's official site has a good Japanese-only tourism section with integrated machine translation.
The local tourist association has a Japanese-only guide site, with a downloadable 8-page pamphlet in English.
Get in[edit]
The Tsukuba Express Line (sometimes abbreviated as TX) connects Tsukuba to Akihabara in downtown Tokyo in about 45 minutes. The fare is ¥1,150. No reservation is necessary, despite the flashy name it looks like most other trains.
You can also travel to Tsukuba by highway bus (高速バス) from Tokyo station's Yaesu south exit (八重洲南口). Most of the buses go to University of Tsukuba, but you can get off at Tsukuba Center, a bus hub located near the Tsukuba Express line station. The travel time is approx. 70 minutes at a cost of ¥1150 each way.
If you get to Narita airport by plane, a route by train to Tsukuba is: Narita airport~(Keisei Narita Sky Access)~Shin-Kamagaya~(Tobu Urban Park Line) via Kashiwa)~Nagareyama-Otakanomori~(Tsukuba Express)~Tsukuba. Japan Rail Passes can not be used on this route. Any train route requires at least two train changes. Using Narita Kuko Kotsu Express bus is simpler - direct to Tsukuba station bus terminal, six times a day, at \2400.

Get around[edit]

Tsukuba is extremely accessible and well laid-out. The infrastructure consists of the Higashi-Ōdori (東大通り) on the east and the Nishi-Ōdori (西大通り) on the west, both major roadways running on either side of the university. The campus itself is connected to downtown via a system of bicycle paths and bridges, known as the Pedestrian Way, offering easy transit for university students.
Bicycle rental is available in front of the train station (ask for "rent-a-cycle"). ¥500 per day, half for kids bicycles, open from 09:00 to 18:30. You have to return the bicycles by 18:30, except if you rent for several days.

Tsukuba's main attraction for tourists is Mount Tsukuba, a double-peaked mountain with a lot of history. The Tsukuba-san Shuttle Bus drives from the Tsukuba Express Train Station to Tsukuba Shrine for ¥720 each way, and to its terminus Tsutsujigaoka, closer to the top, for about ¥1,000.

However, the longest trail offers the most cultural sights, such as shrines and a large stone looking like Buddha. The huge trees and rocks make for a fantastic walk. The not-so-fit can take the cable car to the top. The terminus of the cable car features several restaurants, souvenir stores, and snack shops. The true summit of Nantai-san is a short additional hike. The twin summit of Nyotai-san boasts a dramatic granite formation, a small shrine, and the famous toad-shaped rock, Gama-ishi. Walking free, cable car ¥580 one way. (updated Jun 2015)
