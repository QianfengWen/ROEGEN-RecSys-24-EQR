Understand[edit]
Stryn district within the Nordfjord region

The arms of this majestic fjord cuts deep into the mountains where its extensions are seen as green valleys and romantic lakes. While the many lakes in Stryn district are moderately deep (100-200 meters), next door Hornindal lake is one of the deepest in the world (500 meters +) and the deepest lake in Europe. Hornindal lake has such a big volume that rivers takes an average of about 15 years to flow through.
Stryn district is the transition area between the great fjords and high mountains creating the barrier to eastern Norway. Stryn has deep valleys, mountain passes and the northern part of the Jostedalsbreen glacier as well as other glaciers. These glaciers are used for summer skiing. About 15 % of the district is covered by glaciers or permanent snow. About 2/3 of the area is above the treeline.
