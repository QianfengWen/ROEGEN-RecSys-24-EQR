Freeport is on the Emerald Coast of Florida.


Understand[edit]
Freeport began about 1830 when settlers were attracted to the natural harbor of LaGrange Bayou located near the eastern end of Choctawhatchee Bay and the mouth of the Choctawhatchee River. Freeport was first known as Genoa and later Four Mile Landing. During the Civil War, Four Mile Landing began to be referred to as Freeport, literally because there was no charge to dock at the port area at the junction of Four Mile Creek and LaFayette Creek.

Get in[edit]
Freeport is located at the crossroads of two Florida stateroads. US 331 from the South and North, exit 85 on I-10. SR 20 from East and West. Freeport, true to its name, is located on the water. Access via LaGrange Bayou, Four Mile Creek, Black Creek and the Choctawhatchee River is possible.

Get around[edit]
Freeport is literally the crossroads between North and South Walton County. It is advantageously situated and within driving proximity to Tallahassee, Pensacola, Montgomery, Ft. Walton Beach, and Panama City. It is within an hour of the Okaloosa County Regional Airport, the Bay County Regional Airport the Destin Municipal Airport and the DeFuniak Springs Municipal Airport. It is a half-hours drive from the beaches and golf courses of South Walton. Freeport is a proud cooperative neighbor of Eglin Air Force Base which borders the city limits.
