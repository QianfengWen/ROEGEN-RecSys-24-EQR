Wagga Wagga (pronounced Wogga Wogga), the largest inland city in New South Wales, with a population of around 56,000 people (2018), is located on the banks of the Murrumbidgee River. The city is universally referred to as Wagga.


Understand[edit]
What's now Wagga Wagga was originally inhabited by the Wiradjuri people, considered to be the largest Aboriginal cultural grouping in New South Wales. They inhabited much of what is now the Riverina and the Central West.
Early colonists first sighted the land on which the city of Wagga Wagga now stands in December 1829 during an expedition of discovery down the Murrumbidgee and Murray Rivers. Settlement swiftly followed.
Wagga Wagga was proclaimed a town in 1849 and by the 1860s had a population of 700. The train line reached Wagga in the 1870s, and by 1881, the population had increased to 3,975. In 1879 the railway line was extended south of the river.
"Wagga" in the local Wiradjuri Aboriginal dialect means "crow". The repetition of a word is the method of expressing the plural or emphasis; thus, Wagga Wagga means "crows" or "the place where crows assemble in large numbers". The Murrumbidgee River which runs through the city also derived its name from the Wiradjuri language and means "plenty of water" or "big water".
