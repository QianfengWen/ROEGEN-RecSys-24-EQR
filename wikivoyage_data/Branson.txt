Branson is in the Ozarks and the southwest region Missouri. Today it is sometimes referred to as a "family-friendly Las Vegas" because of the many shows and attractions, the flashy building decorations, and the neon lights. The "strip", as it has been named, draws people from far and wide.


Understand[edit]
Downtown
Branson was named for Rueben Branson, postmaster and operator of a general store in the area in the 1880s. The population was almost 13,000 in 2020. 
If shows are not your thing then check out one of the three lakes Branson has to offer. Lake Taneycomo's clear cold waters provide some of the finest trout fishing available anywhere in the world. Table Rock Lake and Bull Shoals Lake offer a variety of recreational activities including hiking, sightseeing, hunting, skin diving, fishing, and water sports such as swimming, boating, and water skiing.
Maybe it is golfing that swings your attention. Branson has an array of golf courses sure to please the newest beginner to the most professional golfer.

Get in[edit]
Map of Branson
By plane[edit]
M. Graham Clark - Taney County Airport, for private plane traffic, is located adjacent to Branson in Point Lookout, Missouri, next to the College of the Ozarks.
Branson Airport, 8 miles (13 km) south of Branson, is Branson's major carrier local airport. Sun Country Airlines is the only scheduled service from this airport as of 1/1/2024, with apparently weekly flights to Minneapolis-St. Paul.
Springfield-Branson Regional Airport is about 50 miles (80 km) from Branson, serving the following air travel providers:

American Eagle[dead link] - nonstop service to Dallas/Fort Worth.
Delta Connection - nonstop service to Atlanta and Memphis.
United Express - nonstop service to Chicago-O'Hare and Denver.
Boone County Regional Airport in Harrison, Arkansas, is closer (31 miles/50 km), but has only one carrier, Southern Airways Express, with service to Memphis and Dallas.
Other options include NW Arkansas Regional Airport in Bentonville, 97 miles (160 km) or about a 2-hour drive away though the Mark Twain National Forest (includes some steep curves over hilly terrain—this is the only airport whose land route is through the forest).  The nearest major airports are Tulsa 216 miles, Kansas City 233 miles, and St. Louis (Lambert) 255 miles.  St. Louis has some international flights, as well as some major tourist attractions of its own to see.

By car[edit]
From most locations, take I-44 to Springfield, then south on US 65 (exit 82A). From the west, use the US 60/160 connector just before entering Springfield (exit 69).

Get around[edit]
In-spite of the mind-numbing number of activities here, and occasional bumper-to-bumper traffic, Branson should not be mistaken for a larger city, as it does not have a regular bus system. With this being said, one who is savvy could get around without their own vehicle.

By car[edit]
During the week, the congestion isn't that bad on Highway 76, and could be especially clear in the afternoons. After all, most shows are in the evening. When driving in weekend or evening traffic, be extra vigilant (lights could be distracting, and thus cause a wreck), consider alternate routes, and allow several minutes of leeway with schedules. Branson has special "colored" routes to make driving easier. Knowledge of these can make driving less stressful, and faster.

By train[edit]
One could ride the Branson Scenic Train around to out-of-town attractions, which runs on an hourly basis.

Table Rock Lake[edit]
Table Rock Lake Shoreline Trail
A beautiful stretch of crystal clear blue water, spanning around 50,000 acres (20,000 ha), Table Rock Lake is a reservoir that winds through the Ozark Mountains of northwestern Arkansas and southwestern Missouri. A favorite vacation spot for outdoor lovers of all types of activities, it has become a major tourist attraction of Branson. People from all over the United States come to the area in order to camp, boat, and fish. You can enjoy all sorts of water sports activities, including jet skiing, tubing, scuba diving, and swimming.
Impounded by the Table Rock Dam, which was constructed on the White River by the U.S. Corps of Engineers in 1954 to 1958, the original purpose of the reservoir was to control flooding on the White River, which also flows through Missouri and Arkansas. It had already been established as a prime ground for fishing and recreation as early as the 1930s. However, flooding from the White River had constantly devastated the area. Following the Flood Control Act of 1943, the dam was constructed and the overflow of water from the White River filled the man-made lake now known as Table Rock Lake. The overflow from this reservoir spills downstream into Lake Taneycomo, the cold water of the reservoir creating a trout fishing environment for the lake.
As Table Rock Lake is a big fishing area, a lot of fishermen are attracted to the place. Moreover, the lake boasts a wide variety of fish in abundant supply. Some of these fish include bass, catfish, white bass, crappie, and bluegill. An aggressive fish management program has also been implemented in the area, seeing a resurgence of smallmouth, Kentucky, and largemouth bass of exceptionally large size. This has led to even more fishermen flocking to this site, both professional and recreational fishermen.
Surrounding the lake are lands for public use, which draw many people who enjoy nature and hunting. The scenery is exquisite, and portions of the Mark Twain National Forest are located on these lands. Table Rock State Park also borders the shoreline of Table Rock Lake.

Do[edit]
The Branson Scenic Railroad operates from the historic Branson Train Depot located downtown.

It also offers nightly dinner trips and a Polar Express tour during November and December.

The number one feature of the park is a giant, sparkling cave that takes hourly tours named Marvel Cave. Quite a lot of money would be spent if one wants to experience the wide variety of food and products at the park, and will most likely need to spend more than one day there to experience everything.   
The Branson Belle is a river boat that was built next to Table Rock Lake and has lunch and dinner cruises with entertainment.
Riding the Ducks is also very popular. They are World War II amphibious vehicles that take you around town and then into the lake for a short cruise.,
