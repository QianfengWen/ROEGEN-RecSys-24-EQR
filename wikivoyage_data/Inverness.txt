Inverness (Scottish Gaelic: Inbhir Nis, "Mouth of the River Ness") is a city in The Great Glen and Strathspey area of the Scottish Highlands, at the point where the River Ness flows out into the Moray Firth. 
Inverness is the only town of any size in the Highlands, and is the region's commercial and administrative centre. It's an agreeable Victorian town that has no stand-out tourist attractions of its own, but has good transport and choice of lodging and eating places. So it's a good base for exploring nearby Loch Ness, Black Isle, Culloden, Spey Valley and Cairngorm National Park.


Understand[edit]
Inverness Castle and the River Ness
Inverness is at the north end of the great fault line and valley through the Highlands, so it controls trade and transport routes. There was a Pictish and early Christian settlement by the 6th century, and it was the abode of that much-maligned 11th-century ruler Macbeth. Town and castle were wrecked by conflicts on many occasions, the last incursion being the Jacobites in 1746. The present castle is from 1835. 
Inverness is nominally a city but feels like a provincial market town. The hinterland is thinly populated, lacks mineral resources and is a long way from major conurbations, so local industry has always been on a small scale. What you see now is mostly Victorian, with an encrustation of modern shop fronts. In 2020 Inverness had a population of 47,790.
VisitScotland iCentre is the tourist office, at 36 High Street (☏ +44 1463 252401), open daily 9AM-5PM.
They'll point you towards Loch Ness a few miles north, but the River Ness through town had the first recorded sighting of the monster, in the 5th century AD. St Columba was in the area to meet the local Pictish king when it raised its slimy head, but he made the Sign of the Cross, which shooed it away.

By plane[edit]
57.5425-4.04751 Inverness Airport (INV  IATA), Ardersier IV2 7JB (5 miles east of city off A96 to Nairn), ☏ +44 1667 464000. Regular direct flights are by KLM from Amsterdam Schiphol (AMS IATA), British Airways from London Heathrow (LHR IATA), Easyjet from Luton and Gatwick, Aurigny from Guernsey, Jet2.com and Ryanair from European hubs and the Mediterranean, and by TUI from the Mediterranean. The airport is small but modern, with cafes, car hire, and ATMs. Stagecoach Bus 11 / 11A ("Jet Bus") runs to Inverness every 30 min taking 25 min, and to Nairn hourly. A taxi between the airport and the city costs around £25. The Inverness-Aberdeen trains stop here but it's a mile to the station on a poor track.   (updated Mar 2024)

By road[edit]
Take your time, the roads north of Perth are in good repair but mostly undivided, with few safe overtaking stretches and plenty of speed cameras. 
From the south travel up A9 via  Perth and Aviemore. Starting from Edinburgh follow M90 over the Forth road bridge to Perth; from Glasgow follow M80 / A9 past Stirling. From the London area you could go either way: via M1 / A1 to Newcastle and Edinburgh, or M1 / M6 / M74 past Carlisle onto M73 then M80. Bleak Drumochter Pass approaching Aviemore is the only stretch that might be blocked by snow, but it's seldom. 
From Aberdeen via the A96 is 110 miles (176 km). The A82 tracks through the Great Glen from the south-west, from Fort William and Loch Ness.
From Thurso and  Wick in the far north follow A9.

By train[edit]

Inverness has trains from Edinburgh and Glasgow (direct every couple of hours or change at Perth, 4 hours), from Aberdeen (every two hours, 2 hr 15 min), from Kyle of Lochalsh for Skye (four per day, 2 hr 40 min) and from Wick and Thurso for Orkney (four per day, 4 hours). Travelling from England usually involves changing in Edinburgh, but there is one direct daytime train from London King's Cross via York and Newcastle, taking 8 hours. 
The Caledonian Highland Sleeper runs Su-F from London Euston, departing around 9:30PM to arrive by 9AM. (Other portions for Aberdeen and Fort William divide at Edinburgh.) The southbound train leaves Inverness around 7PM to reach Euston towards 8AM. No trains on Saturday night. New rolling stock was introduced on all the sleeper routes in 2019. Compartments have two berths and are sold like hotel rooms: you pay extra for single occupancy, and you won't be sharing with a stranger. Tickets can be booked at any UK mainline railway station or online: in 2022 a single sleeper fare is around £200 for one or £250 for two people. You can also just use the sitting saloon, single £75. If you have an existing ticket or rail pass for a daytime train you need to buy a sleeper supplement. Pricing is dynamic: weekends cost more, if indeed there are berths available. Booking is open 12 months ahead and you need to print out your e-ticket to present on boarding.
57.48-4.2232 Inverness railway station is in city centre on Academy Street. It has a staffed ticket office and machines, toilets and a news shop; no cafe but plenty of pubs and eateries on the street outside. There is step-free access to all platforms. Lockers for luggage charge £5 for a small locker, which fits a backpack. Plusbus tickets are available.

By bus[edit]
The first railway from London arrived in 1858: "Donald, where's yer troosers?"
Buses run every hour or so from Edinburgh and Glasgow via Perth and Aviemore. The main operators are Citylink, Parks of Hamilton and Megabus.
Travel from England usually involves changing in Edinburgh, but National Express and Megabus have a few through-services.
Stagecoach Bus 10 runs from Aberdeen via Huntly, Elgin, Forres and Nairn, taking four hours to Inverness. It runs every two hours M-Sa and every three hours on Sunday.
Citylink / Stagecoach Bus 919 runs from Fort William along the A82 via Spean Bridge, Laggan, Fort Augustus, Urquhart Castle and Drumnadrochit. There are four M-Sa and two on Sunday. 
Stagecoach Bus 917 runs twice daily from Portree on Skye along the A82 and A87 via Broadford, Kyle of Lochalsh, Dornie, Invermoriston, Castle Urquhart and Drumnadrochit. Change at Portree for ferries from the Western Isles via Uig. 
Citylink Bus 961 runs from Ullapool, ferry port for Stornoway on Lewis, twice M-Sa and once on Sunday.

Stagecoach Highlands X99 runs twice M-Sa from Thurso and Wick via Tain to Inverness, 4 hours.
57.481-4.2253 Inverness bus station is in Farraline Park, a couple of blocks northwest of the railway station. The bus station has a ticket office with luggage storage, cafe and toilets.

By boat[edit]
Inverness port has freight but no passenger vessels. Cruise ships often dock at Invergordon, 20 miles north. Most visitors will be on package coach trips of the area, but you could also ride into town independently on the train in less than an hour. But with only four trains per day you need to be sure of your connections.
Caledonian Canal links the Beauly Firth through Loch Ness to Fort William and the sea at Loch Linnhe. The latter is usually well-sheltered, so small craft can easily continue to Glencoe, Oban and Mull.

Get around[edit]
Victorian Market
By bus[edit]
Inverness is fairly small and you're unlikely to use the bus. Bus 3 runs to Culloden, and Bus 11 to the airport and the seaside town of Nairn. Bus 16 runs along the east bank of Loch Ness from Inverness to Dores, Inverfarigaig and Foyers, four times M-F and twice on Saturday.

By taxi[edit]
Operators include Inverness Taxis (+44 1463 222222), A2B (+44 1463 807060), Capital (+44 1463 808080) and Inverness Premier Taxis (+44 1463 800223).
They can usually offer minibuses suitable for groups, and pick up from the airport or Invergordon cruiser terminal for day tours. They'll be fully booked when there's a major golf tournament in town.

By bike[edit]
You don't need one in town, but bike is a good way to reach Loch Ness, and the sights around Culloden. Inverness Bike Hire are based at 12A Church Street. Open daily 9AM-11PM.

In town[edit]
Abertarff House
57.4763-4.22551 Inverness Castle, IV2 3EG. Closed. A great defensive position it's not: castles on this site have been serially destroyed, most recently in 1746 when its Jacobite occupiers wrecked the medieval bastion to prevent its use by government forces. The elegant pink sandstone edifice that now stands here was built in 1847. Until 2020 It housed the law courts - they've moved to a modern building on Longman Rd, and the castle is being redeveloped as a visitor attraction. So meanwhile you just admire the exterior.   (updated Jul 2022)
 Inverness Museum & Art Gallery, Castle Wynd IV2 3EB (south flank of castle), ☏ +44 1349 781730, inverness.museum@highlifehighland.com.

57.4801-4.22893 Old High Church, Church Street IV1 1EY. F 2-4PM, Su 11AM-12:30PM. The oldest in Inverness, this Gothic Church of Scotland parish church was mostly built in the 18th century, and there's probably been a church on this site since St Columba's time. The congregation is referred to as "Old High St Stephens" reflecting a merger in 2003 between this and St Stephens, a 19th-century church half a mile south. Both churches remain active but from 2022 all services are in St Stphens.   (updated Jul 2022)
Inverness Cathedral
Chapel Yard Cemetery is just off Chapel Street. Its denizens are mostly 19th-century, but the original Chapel of St Mary, part of a monastery, was 14th-century. Chapel and monastery are long gone as Cromwell carried off the masonry to build a bastion.
57.4746-4.22914 Inverness Cathedral (St Andrew’s), Ardross St IV3 5NN (west riverbank upstream of Ness Bridge). Daily 9AM-4PM. Scottish Episcopal (Anglican) cathedral, built in 1869 in a mix of red sandstone and granite. Look up to the two giant spires... which aren't there, because the money for building ran out.   (updated Jul 2022)
St Mary's 200 yards downstream from St Andrews is the main Roman Catholic church, built in 1837, with fine stained glass windows and altar. It's not a cathedral as the RC diocese is based in Aberdeen.
Balnain House just downstream from Greig St Bridge is a fine mansion of 1726 but only occasionally open.
Knocknagael Boar Stone is Pictish, carved around 600 AD, showing a wild boar amidst spirals and bristles. It's been moved from the farm where it was found to the south side of the Highland Council offices on Glenurquhart Rd.

Further out[edit]
Dochgarroch Locks at the end of Loch Ness
57.477-4.2696 Craig Phadrig is a forested hill of 564 ft (172 m) topped by a vitrified fort, It was built around 4th century AD and occupied to the 7th, and is probably the place where St Columba met King Bridei mac Maelchon. But at some point the fort burned so furiously that its stone was fused into glass. It's an active forestry site so you may have to work around logging.
57.4332-4.30237 Dochgarroch Locks are where Loch Ness drains into the Caledonian Canal towards town. This north tip of Loch Ness is called Loch Dochfour but it's the same body of water.
57.4494-4.19268 Druid Temple is more accurately a neolithic burial cairn and stone circle, rather overgrown. You may be able to access it via Druid Farm and Shop just east. A similar cairn and circle was found at Raigmore when the A9 was re-routed towards Kessock Bridge; it was moved to a nearby site which is now difficult to access amidst hospital and industrial buildings.
Culloden, five miles east, is best known for the 1746 battlefield where Bonny Prince Charlie's Jacobite army was finally shattered. It also has the Bronze Age "Clava Cairns", and Cawdor Castle associated with Shakespeare's Macbeth.
Do[edit]
River Ness and Caledonian Canal stretch for eight miles between Loch Dochfour (the pool at the north end of Loch Ness) and Beauly Firth, the reach of sea just below Inverness. It's a pleasant picturesque stroll, or bike-ride if you're trying to reach the loch. Going upstream from town centre, follow either river bank up to the wooded Ness Islands. Above here, be on the west bank (passing the Botanic Gardens) to come onto the canal towpath, which is the best route upstream.
57.473-4.23081 Eden Court Theatre, Bishops Road, IV3 5SA, ☏ +44 1463 234 234 (box office). A theatre, arts and cinema venue. (updated Jun 2023)

Their home ground Caledonian Stadium (capacity 7500) is off the last A9 exit before Kessock Bridge. In Feb 2000 Caley's shock 3-1 away cup victory over Celtic inspired a legendary headline in The Sun: "Super Caley Go Ballistic, Celtic Are Atrocious".
Rugby : Highland RFC play rugby union in National League One, the amateur game's second tier in Scotland. They play at Canal Park, two miles upriver.
Dolphin-spotting: boat trips run Apr-Oct from Inverness Marina. The main operator is Dolphin Spirit.
