Natchez is a city near the southwest corner of the U.S. state of Mississippi.  This historic town is perched on a high bluff above the Mississippi River 100 miles upriver from New Orleans.  It was an important, wealthy city before the Civil War.  That history gave it the South's grandest collection of antebellum homes.

When the Civil War broke out in 1861, all of the workers (who were from Pennsylvania) returned to the north, leaving the house unfinished. Dr. Haller Nutt, the owner of the house, finished out the basement (6000 sq feet) for his family to live in. Dr. Nutt died of pneumonia in 1864 without ever having finished the house, and the upper floors of the house remain unfinished to this day.
