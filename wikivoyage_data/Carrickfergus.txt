Carrickfergus is a large town 12 miles northeast of Belfast, historically in County Antrim. The counties of Northern Ireland have been abolished so since 2015 the town has been part of Mid and East Antrim District. It's often abbreviated to "Carrick" but that's a common place name in Ireland, so always specify "Carrickfergus" when organising transport. 


Understand[edit]
Carrickfergus Castle
Carraig Fhearghais means "The rock of Fergus" - Fergus the Great (430-501 AD) was King of Dál Riata and it's said his ship hit a rock here. It became a substantial walled town in the Norman period, acquiring the fine castle which today is the main reason to visit. It long pre-dates Belfast, which only outgrew it in the 18th and 19th centuries as metal-bashing industries developed, and ships needed deeper harbours. Until then, Carrickfergus was the place you had to capture to land your troops in Ulster, and the English, Scots and Irish took turns doing so. King William of Orange landed here to campaign against James II / VII, and in 1760 the town was even seized for a few days by French privateers. 
The modern town's fortunes have ebbed and flowed with those of industry and civil stability in Northern Ireland. It's become a commuter town for the city, with a population in 2011 of 27,998.
The TIC is within the Museum & Civic Centre, see below.

54.7133-5.806451 Carrickfergus Castle, Marine Hwy BT38 7BG, ☏ +44 28 9335 1273. Daily 9:30AM-4:30PM. The best-preserved Norman castle in Ireland, built in 1177 when the site was almost surrounded by water. It was besieged and captured several times, including by French privateers in 1760. (They only wanted provisions not possession, and left as soon as the winds were favourable; the Royal Navy destroyed them off Galloway.) The castle remained in military use until 1928: Victorian and other additions were then taken away to restore the Norman appearance.   (updated Feb 2021)

54.757-5.7043 Whitehead is a village at the entrance to Belfast Lough that developed as a seaside resort in the 1890s. Not much has happened here since so it retains its period atmosphere, and it's an access point for The Gobbins and Islandmagee. See Larne.
