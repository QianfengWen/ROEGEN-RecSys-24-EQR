The Eastern suburbs of Monterrey include a number of municipalities, the largest of which are Guadalupe and San Nicolas de los Garza. Monterrey's international airport (MTY) is in the eastern suburb of Apodaca, which has seen tremendous development in the early 21st century, making it one of the fastest growing parts of Monterrey. Escobedo is another large municipality, at least in area, though not in population.

Understand[edit]
Typical view of San Nicolas
Monterrey is known as the industrial engine of Mexico, and many of the factories, warehouses, foreign maquiladoras, and other industrial facilities are in the eastern suburbs. Residential areas are interspersed with industrial zones. Most residential areas serve poorer, working class laborers and these are generally not areas that are friendly to tourists.

Several stations serve San Nicolas along Avenida Adolfo Lopez Mateos: Col. Moderna, Ruiz Cortinas, Los Angeles, and Hospital Metropolitano (terminus of Line 3).
Metrorrey Line 2 has several stops in San Nicolas including: Universidad, Anahuac, and Sendero. The Sendero station is a connecting point for 3 Metrobus routes to nearby neighborhoods. One of these routes serves parts of Apodaca. The San Nicolas station also connects to a Metrobus route.

Get around[edit]
Buses, taxis and ride sharing are the best ways to get around in Guadalupe and San Nicolas. Many neighborhoods in this area are poor choices for exploring as a lone pedestrian. There's metrobus service throughout Guadalupe and San Nicolas.

 Abasolo and El Carmen (From Escobedo, drive northwest (toward Mina) on federal highway MEX-53 for about 10-15 km.). Two adjacent small towns that might be interesting for people who have already seen "everything" in Monterrey. Abasolo is a typical dusty Nuevo Leon town with a pleasant zocalo bordered by an historic church, Parroquia de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, which has an oil painting of the Virgin that was painted in 1760. El Carmen might be just a tad larger than Abasolo and is the site of an abandoned mine referred to as "Minas Viejas". It's not a touristic destination though Monterrey adventurers like to go there with a flashlight and helmet (there are no lights and no tour guides to lead you). A vigorous hike takes you to the mine. 
Buy[edit]
Small, local businesses dominate the commercial spaces of this part of town and there are few places to attract visitors who want to shop. There is typical name-brand shopping in La Fe, but no unique shops in this part of the city. The best part of Monterrey for name-brand shopping is San Pedro Garza Garcia, with its plethora of glitzy, modern malls and shopping centers.

Eat[edit]
Small neighborhood cafes and street food are the most common options in this part of the city. A cluster of new restaurants is available in Apodaca near the airport.

Sleep[edit]
The eastern suburbs are not traditionally magnets for visitors and few hotels are in this part of the city. However, the Centro and Fundidora areas are nearby and offer plentiful options. The eastern suburbs include Apodaca with Monterrey's large international airport and there are a large and growing number of hotels serving the MTY airport area. In San Nicolas, a number of cheaper hotels (of often dubious repute) are also scattered along Av. Miguel Aleman along the route to the airport and in San Nicolas and Escobedo along MEX 85 (Carretera Nacional) heading north toward Laredo.

Stay safe[edit]
Due to the high incidence of femicide violence in the municipality of Guadalupe, the Gender Violence Alert Against Women was declared on November 18, 2016.
Guadalupe, Escobedo, Apodaca, and San Nicolas are mostly working class neighborhoods where tourists are obvious outsiders who wandered off the beaten path. Be vigilant about your surroundings and use common sense about getting in and around the area.
