Achiltibuie is a community straggling along the west coast of Ross and Cromarty, north of Ullapool in the Scottish Highlands. As well as the village, the name (which in Gaelic means "field of the yellow-haired boy") applies to all the coast between Achduart and Reiff, taking in the hamlets of Polglass, Polbain and Altandhu.

Follow A835 north from Ullapool or south from Ledmore (the junction with A837) to the turn-off at Drumrunie, then take the narrow single-track lane west. There's no through road along the coast from Ullapool, though the historic "postman's path" came this way via Ardmair and you can hike the ten miles. You can also drive south from Lochinver along a twisty, hilly, narrow but scenic and well-tarmacked lane. 
KSM Bus 811 runs from Ullapool to Achiltibuie, twice M-F and once on Saturday, taking 80 minutes.
See Ullapool for buses to Inverness and ferries to Stornoway on Lewis.

Get around[edit]
You'll need a car or bike, or be a hard-core hiker.

The long ridge of Ben Mor Coigach
57.986061-5.2256192 Ben Mor Coigach  is the Table Mountain of this area, a six-mile ridge of Torridonian sandstone weathered into striking shapes. The summit is 743 m (2438 feet), very prominent as it rears up from sea level. The simplest approach is to drive to the road's end at Culnacraig and ascend from the southwest. It can also be climbed from the car park at Bleughasary from the southeast. Trying to traverse the ridge, to ascend one way and descend the other, is much harder than it looks, with bogs, fast streams and scrambles; allow at least four hours.
