 Les Correspondances d'Eastman: .  Since 2003, this festival has promoted reading and writing by bringing writing to life, and by celebrating the book and the work of writers. During a few days in mid-August, passersby are invited to come and write letters that are sent free of charge throughout the world. Children and adults can visit inspiring places in "gardens or writing rooms", scattered throughout the village, where they will write a note to a loved one. The mail is then collected by the Correspondence Factors, who crisscross the village on foot or by bike. Writing kits are available to each participant for the purchase of the Passport Pen giving access to all writing locations, exhibitions, screenings, Word Portage and the Letter Trail. There are many other activities related to writing and reading, with authors, animators and comedians also coming to celebrate all the letters. (date needs fixing)
Hiking[edit]
 Parcours Missisquoi Nord. Access to the river, hiking trails and village trails in the Missisquoi Valley North, within four municipalities, is free. However, you must pay access fees for trails that connect with other hiking networks in the area. The hiking trails are open year-round, except for the hunting season. Do not rely on your cell phone because the reception in the valley is intermittent. There is a map here. The trails are reserved for hiking, and are not open to mountain bikes. (updated Dec 2018)
