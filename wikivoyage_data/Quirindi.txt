Quirindi is a town (population 3,444 in 2016) in the southernmost part of the New England region of New South Wales in Australia.


Understand[edit]
Quirindi War Memorial and Terminus Hotel
The name Quirindi comes from the indigenous Kamilaroi language with various meanings, such as 'nest in the hills', 'the place where fish breed', and 'the dead tree on the mountain top'. The local economy is based on agriculture, with broadacre farming on the black soils of the Liverpool Plains to the west, and livestock grazing in the hilly eastern part of the district. Quirindi makes an excellent base for exploring the sunflowers fields out west on the Liverpool Plains during the blooming season.
Quirindi is the main centre of the Liverpool Plains Local Government Area.
