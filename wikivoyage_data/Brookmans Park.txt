Brookmans Park is a village in the English county of Hertfordshire 14 mi (23 km) north of London. 


Understand[edit]
Brookmans Park was named after John Brokeman who had an estate (park) in the 15th century. A second estate, Gobions, was built with a mock medieval gate house 51.712-0.1855271 Folly Arch.   
The current dormitory village was built in this park, after the  railway station was opened in 1926. It was to become a garden city but being in London's Green Belt it was not allowed to grow: the large shopping centre, Bradmore Green, shows this legacy.
