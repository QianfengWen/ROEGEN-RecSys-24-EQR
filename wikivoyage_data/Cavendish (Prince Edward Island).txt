Cavendish is a small community north shore of Prince Edward Island, Canada. Cavendish is the largest seasonal resort area in Prince Edward Island with an average daily population in the months of July and August of approximately 7,500 residents.


Understand[edit]
Cavendish originated as a small farming community throughout the 19th and first half of the 20th centuries, and became famous in 1908 for its place in literature as the home of the Green Gables farmhouse in Lucy Maud Montgomery's Anne of Green Gables books, which describe a town "Avonlea" based on Cavendish, PEI. Prince Edward Island National Park was established in 1937 to protect the homestead and the ecologically-sensitive sandy beaches and dunes along the surrounding coastline. Green Gables Heritage Place and the adjacent golf course are within the park.
Subsequent development between the 1950s-1990s saw motels, campgrounds, amusement parks and other attractions, shopping facilities, and bars and restaurants built. During any given week in July and August, the community's population expands as tens of thousands of tourists flock to the national park and local attractions. Many of these businesses are seasonal and highly tourist-oriented, closing for the winter when the park closes in late September.

Climate[edit]
Cavendish has a mild climate due to the warm waters of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The summer is the best time to visit, with temperatures ranging from 20–34 °C (68–93 °F) and the warmest waters north of the Carolinas. Winters are much colder, with temperatures ranging from −3 – −11 °C (27–12 °F), but cold winds can make it feel more like −25 °C (−13 °F).
