Understand[edit]
Lac la Biche
Lac La Biche was established in 1798 as a trading post on a voyageur route that historically linked the Athabaskan region to Hudson Bay. The area, natively Cree, provided a large supply of whitefish and beaver. Its modern economy relies on the oil patch, logging, forestry, agriculture and commercial fishing; it is home to Portage College, a community college.
