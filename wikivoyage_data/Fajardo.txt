Fajardo is in the Eastern Coast region of Puerto Rico.


Understand[edit]
Known as "the city that guards the sun of the Caribbean" (La Metrópolis del Sol Naciente), Fajardo is on the east coast of Puerto Rico, north of Ceiba and east of Luquillo.
One of the main attractions is the Bio-Luminescent Bay.  A 1.5 hour tour, you will kayak in through a Mangrove forest at night to the bay, where luminescent plankton glow bright blue every time the water is disturbed.  Most tours cost $45, and combo packages with tours of El Yunque Rainforest are available and quite a good full-day trip.

Depending on traffic, it's about a 45 minute drive from the airport in San Juan to get to Fajardo.

By Public Transport[edit]

By Air[edit]
M&N Aviation operates charter flights throughout the Caribbean, to Ceiba's airport.  José Aponte de la Torre also has multiple operations to Vieques and Culebra.

Do[edit]
Tours to bioluminescent bay[edit]
Quite a number of companies offer kayaking tours. Using a kayak is the only way to enter some hard-to-access places, such as the tunnels and channels of the mangroves. You can enjoy a spectacular ecological reserve surrounded by mangroves, coral reefs and most importantly, a breathtaking bay that will make you sparkle with every paddle.
Snorkeling is also popular locally. It is a great sport that does not require expensive equipment. Visiting the local beaches is an excellent way to see some underwater sights.
