Understand[edit]

The island is sparsely-populated, with a small village on the south side of the island, residential areas on the east side, a limestone quarry on the west side, and a State Park on the north side. 
Ferries from the mainland dock at the village several times/day during prime tourist season. This season lasts from late spring to early fall. Visiting in the winter is difficult as the lake freezes over and becomes impassible. Off season travel should only be attempted if you secured lodging in advance and are solely interested in the winter scenes on the island, as nearly any lodging, restaurants, attractions, or businesses in general will be closed.

History[edit]
During the Ice Age, receding glaciers carved glacier grooves across the island. Kelleys Island was first inhabited by the Native Americans, creating Inscription rock on the southern shore sometime during the 1640s.
By the early 1800s, the first white settlers arrived, but were unable to stay due to a variety of mishaps. By the 1820s the first permanent settlers established themselves. By the 1830s the first quarry opened, and by the 1840s the first winery opened on the island. The use of the island stone destroyed most of the vast glacial grooves, outside of a small preserved area.

Stay safe[edit]
The north side of the island is significantly less developed then the south.
Despite its low population and remoteness, Kelleys Island still has a police department and an emergency medical service, however the island lacks a proper hospital. Undeveloped areas of the island get poor or no cellular service, making dialing 911 hard or impossible. Let someone know your travel plans if you go out alone.
When a sidewalk is available use it. Walking on the road is punished by a $100 fine from the island police.
The bedrock on Kelleys Island is very close to the surface, and often bare patches of it are exposed in parks. This rock can be slippery, especially after rain or near the lake. Always pay attention where you're stepping, especially near cliff edges.
Lake Erie is volatile and can be dangerous. Be careful while swimming, especially alone. There is no lifeguard at the public beach, and  riptides do occur, so have a buddy and know how to deal with one should you find yourself caught in one.
Don't enter the abandoned buildings in the woods. Most haven't been maintained since the 1930s, and they are battered often by the temperamental weather of Lake Erie.
It is possible to walk to the island in the winter over frozen waters, but this should never be attempted. The frozen over lake is treacherous, and the ice is often not as thick as it seems. Falling through even once would mean certain death, as there will be nobody to help you warm up, even if you do manage to escape the frigid waters. When elderly locals talk about doing this back in the day, they almost always qualify it by mentioning how stupid and suicidal it was of them to even try this.
