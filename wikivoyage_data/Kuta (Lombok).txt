Not to be confused with Kuta, a major resort town in Bali.

Kuta is a coastal town in the south of the island of Lombok in Indonesia. The scenery is spectacular, with cliffs and mountains reaching the coast to create jagged and awe-inspiring landscapes and views. The beaches are some of the best in Indonesia, with pristine white sand, and transparent blue-greens in the water. Kuta has some of the best surfing in the world, so naturally many visitors are surfers.


Understand[edit]
View of Kuta beach and evirons
Kuta has a wide variety of accommodations and restaurants, ranging from backpacker offerings to a four-star resort for wealthier travellers. Many people come to Kuta just to unwind, lie on the beach, rent a motorcycle to look around or to just relax by reading a book or taking a nap in the afternoon.
Most of Kuta retains its sleepy, natural character as a typical fishing village. The local people live in housing clusters (called kampungs) and are largely unaffected by tourist activity. Travellers can walk along dirt roads and see the villagers going about their normal daily activities.  Food is usually cooked over a wood fire and the children live a carefree life of playing on the beach and climbing trees. Most people are exceptionally friendly to foreigners, although a very small element have growing hostilities.  With the High numbers of surfers coming to Kuta Lombok, some frustrations can lead to aggression and ugly incidents. Should you run into any trouble report it at the local police office on the bypass. Remain cautious and use common sense; particularly at night, around local surfer-dudes who are drinking.
Lombok International Airport is around 20 minutes away, and there has been a huge amount of land speculation in the Kuta area from high-end hotel operators and other investors.
To search in Google Maps, type Kuta Lombok to avoid confusion with Kuta Bali.
This area of Lombok has been designated as a tourist development area in Mandalika Beach, 2.6 km away from Kuta Beach and 300 m from Seger Beach. However, the area has been named "Kuta Mandalika" and has wide road boulevard.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
-8.757322116.2766751 Lombok International Airport (LOP IATA) (18 km north of Kuta close to the city of Praya). Please see the main Lombok article for more details on the new international airport and connecting services to destinations across the island. A journey by metered taxi is about Rp80,000 to Kuta and it takes about 25 minutes.   
From Bali[edit]
There are many shuttle bus companies which have scheduled transport from Bali. Expect to pay around Rp200,000 per person (one way) from main Bali departure centres such as Kuta or Ubud. The price will include the ferry and connecting shuttles. The popular Perama bus company will charge only an additional Rp10,000 per surfboard. The one-way trip by bus and ferry usually requires more than 12 hr of travel to reach Kuta. It is a slow, but inexpensive and comfortable way to travel if that fits your style.

From Lembar[edit]
From Lembar the price to Kuta must be negotiated in advance. Competition is fierce and porters will often place your luggage in a taxi prior to settling the price. If using a taxi you should ensure that the driver uses the meter.  Assertive behavior can ensure you choose the type of transport and price that suits your needs. The taxi fare from Lembar to Kuta should be around Rp250,000. If using a hired car ensure that the price is clearly defined before you enter the vehicle and depart.
Perama will also run this route if there are two of more passengers booked beforehand (Rp125,000 per person). The Perama bus will be waiting for you when you get off the boat in Lembar Harbour.

By shuttle[edit]
Perama shuttle tickets can be booked at the Perama office at Segare Anak Bungalows from 07:00-22:00, They have daily departures to destinations on Lombok and Bali. Transport to Lembar, the port for connecting ferries to Padangbai in Bali, costs Rp125,000 per person. To travel further north, prices to Senggigi and the Gili Islands should be Rp150,000 and Rp180,000 respectively. There are also many other reliable shuttle companies which can be booked through the tourist information booths or through your hotel or homestay.

Get around[edit]
8°53′29″S 116°16′47″EMap of Kuta (Lombok)
In the village of Kuta, all local facilities are within a reasonable walking distance. For local transport in and around Kuta you can use a ojek (motorbike with rider).

By bemo[edit]
An extensive, but complex public transport system runs throughout all of Lombok. The standard mode of public transportation is the bemo, a small, covered pick-up truck with narrow benches.
The bemo is designed to transport local people; tourists may find them confusing and difficult to use. Public transport is not recommended for the uninitiated traveller, especially if traveling with luggage or surfboards and unable to speak Bahasa Indonesia. To reach almost any destination, expect numerous stops en route, bemo changes, and sometimes very crowded conditions. True backpackers wishing to save money by conquering the bemo system should carefully get advice about the route in advance and write down the name of the destination to show the driver. Traveling on a bemo is certainly one way to experience local culture.
Public bemo's are located at the junction and also on the beach road.

Wisata Car[edit]
In Kuta arfatourindo operates transport from Kuta beach to other beaches, e.g. mawun, tanjung aan, mawi, seger, selong belanak where surfing, diving and snorkling could be done. It costs Rp15,000-50,000 for one way. The passengers are at least 4 people. You may reserve this transport via arfatourindo@gmail.com or call +6278739518019.

By car[edit]




Transport from Kuta with driver in an air-conditioned van
Guideline only, will vary with season and demand

Mataram Rp275,000
Senggigi  Rp300,000
Bangsal Harbour Rp350,000
Lembar Harbour Rp300,000
Senaru Rp600,000
Mataram town half day tour Rp350,000

Many visitors consider the most efficient way to get around is by renting a local driver and a comfortable car.  They are readily available at most hotels to  transport you around the island at the rate of Rp350,000 for a half day

By motorcycle[edit]
If you wish to explore the South Lombok area surrounding Kuta, the preferred way by many is to do so by motorcycle. Motorcycles can be rented at rates of about Rp50,000 per day, without petrol. Insist the bike be in as new condition, then carefully inspect and make note of the bike for scratches and any other damage. Ensure the bike is in proper mechanical condition including the lights, brakes and tyres. Ask for a surfboard rack if desired as some rental operators have them available. Never give your passport or drivers licence as security to rent the bike and ensure the current STNK – Surat Tanda Nomor Kendaraan (Certificate of Registration) is with the motorbike.is.
Should you suffer an accident and damage the bike beware that local renters may ask for over the top compensation. It is always safest to rent from your hotel who do not want to have a problem with their reputation and will ask for fair and reasonable compensation. There are no bikes with insurance in Kuta.

By boat[edit]
Local boatman may be available to take you for an outing but be careful to negotiate the price and details to common agreement before boarding or determining a final price. Do not automatically expect the boat to have adaquate or possibly any safety equipment at all.  Ensure you check such equipment for yourself prior to agreeing to the charter. Some traditional perahu boat operators cannot swim so do not expect them to be able to save you should difficulties arise.  Also ensure that the price includes fuel and where you will be travelling and for how long a time. Ensure you will return to shore well before dusk. Do not expect the boat operator to be able to communicate with you fluently in English or even Bahasa Indonesian.

Beaches[edit]
Around Kuta there are some beautiful beaches. Kuta offers you the private white beaches you have seen on travel posters and always dreamed of experiencing. There are six main beaches in and around Kuta:

-8.719219115.1686861 Kuta Beach, Kuta village. This is where most of the accommodations and restaurants are located.  
 Pantai Putri Nyale (Novotel Beach) (about 3 km east of Kuta Beach). This is where the Novotel Lombok is located. It's a beautiful beach, but at low tide it gets almost completely dry and is no longer suited for swimming. 
-8.90711116.301782 Pantai Seger (Seger Beach) (about 3.5 km east of Kuta Beach). Beach suited for surfing, not for swimming because of the very strong currents. There are some drink stalls. Climb the hill here to watch the sunset. 
-8.90907116.328593 Tanjung A'an (about 7 km east of Kuta Beach). Tanjung A'an consists of two white sand bays, A'an to the west and Pedau to the east, separated by a rocky outcrop. Smooth turquoise waters offer safe swimming and snorkelling. There can be a strong current on the eastern bay at times. There are some drink and snack stalls at the center of the beach and at the western end two restaurants with tables and sunbeds on the sand.  
-8.9116.229514 Mawun (about 8 km west of Kuta Beach). Mawun beach is a secluded half-moon bay with crystal clear water and pristine sand. There's one big tree where people congregate in the shade. An awesome place for relaxing, safe swimming and surfing. The only facilities are a few drinks stalls. 
-8.864116.1545 Selong Belanak (about 17 km west of Kuta Beach, about 6 km over the steep hill). Beautiful bay bordered by two rocky promontories. Nearby is a surf beach called Mawi. The sand is very fine, no traces of coral. Lots of people go there to surf.  
Other[edit]
Visitors can make day trips from Kuta to the pottery village of Penunjak and to the weaving village of Sukarare.

-8.895423116.3041826 Mandalika Circuit (Pertamina Mandalika International Street Circuit) (Located 21,5km from Zainuddin Abdul Madjid Lombok International Airport), admin@themandalikagp.com.

Do[edit]
Surfing[edit]
Kuta is a surfers destination, with world class shore, reef and point breaks along the coast. Personal transport is the best way if not the only way to access the surfing spots. Since there have been reports of thefts in Southern Lombok, you should expect to pay a few thousand Rupiah to a local to guard your bike during your time in the water. Board can be hired in Kuta town or at the Gerupuk village.
Surfing can get busy, with locals and boatmen all joining in. Be aware that some locals can become aggressive following any mishaps in the surf, regardless of who is at fault. This is usually to cause intimidation (and demands for money) but can lead to physical threats. Stay respectful, handle any incidents calmly and fairly, and other locals will almost always look out for you.
Popular surf breaks around Kuta:

Seger reef: the closest break to Kuta village, Seger provides a heavy right hander and is excellent under most conditions. It's a popular spot during the afternoon tide shift, and especially after the big rains in the wet season. Ride past the Novotel, then turn right after the small bridge and continue taking right turns until the road becomes unsealed. Entrance to Seger costs Rp5,000 for motorbikes and Rp10,000 for cars. There is a small hill that onlookers can climb for a phenomenal view of the surroundings, especially popular at sunset.
Air Guling: Air Guling is a beach to the West of Kuta village. The break is a fair paddle from shore, and is a strong right hander, which can become very hollow during a large swell. Continue West from Kuta, up the mountain and over the other side. There is a view of the beach when coming down, and don't be deceived when the road swerves away from the coast. Eventually on the left there will be an unsealed dirt road which can be very difficult to handle (unadvisable to ride when wet). Continue the road to the beach, and pay Rp5,000 to watch your bike.
Gerupuk: The most popular break in Kuta. There are two main breaks here, although some others pop up in the right conditions. You need to hire a boatman from the village to access the breaks (Rp80,000 for 1 person, Rp50,000 per person for 2, and Rp30,000 each for more.). The boat will wait while you surf, however the boatmen will often join you out on the surf, which can cause frustrations when crowded. To get here, take a ride east for 7 km (about 10-15 min). There is a common parking area for surfers and tourists, which the locals monitor. Parking is usually free (although the standard fee is Rp1,000 if you are asked to pay).
Inside Gerupuk: in a sheltered bay, it's is good for beginners/intermediate. Absolute beginners (first time on a board) may find this intimidating, during large swell and crowded conditions, and should look for a simple beach break (like Tanjung Aan). The floor is a soft reef bed which doesn't cause much damage. The wave breaks both left and right here, and can get busy. Ocean Bar is located a short paddle away from the break (floating on the sea) and offers cold drinks, fruit and basic food.
Outside Gerupuk: Cannot be seen from the village, it's a short boat ride away. Outsides is generally the most reliable bet for a surf - there is nearly always something to surf here (even in low swell conditions). The wave is a right hander and can be quite heavy.
Tanjung Aan: Beach break in between Kuta and Gerupuk, for absolute beginners. Take the usual route out to Gerupuk, and take a right hand turn into Turtle Warung - before the football field (around 2 km outside Gerupuk). There are a series of Warungs on the beach, which you will need to drive past. You can park at or near the Turtle Warung, and take a short walk over the hill to see the surf behind. Tanjung Aan can get blown out during afternoon wind, so better to hit it in the morning. The hill will give you one of the best views of Kuta's beaches and inlets, and the sunset is particularly good (with beers from the Warungs).

Cope[edit]
Hospitals[edit]
Several hospitals are in the main city of Mataram including the islands main public hospital Rumah Sakit Umun, Rumah Sakit Harapan Keluaga and the Risa Hospital in Cakranegara near Mataram mall.

Please see the Lombok main article for a list of medical facilities available in Mataram.
Clinics[edit]
 Klinik Risa (Risa Centra Medika Hospital), Jl. Pejanggik No.115, Cakranegara (just east of Mataram mall on the right hand (south) side of the road), ☏ +62 370 625560. 24-hr Emergency room. Full hospital facilities available on site, specialist consulting rooms and dentist. 
Emergency service[edit]
Ambulance In emergency  dial - 118
The reality is that unless within the confines of the main city of Mataram/Ampenan/Cakranegara an ambulance is normally too far away to provide prompt transport in the case of a true emergency. Most often a taxi, police vehicle or a private car is used to get someone requiring urgent medical attention to a hospital. The ambulances in Lombok are more often used in the role of assisted patient transport rather than for first responder/paramedic supported emergency assistance and transport.
Go next[edit]
Gili Islands - for more sand, sea and diving (but no surf to speak of).
Mount Rinjani National Park - Lombok's magnificent active volcanic peak.
Bali - next stop to the west in the Indonesian archipelago.
Senggigi - the principal tourism town on the west coast of the island
Mataram - the main city on the island and the provincial capital, not a lot to see there, has a mall, and an interesting museum
