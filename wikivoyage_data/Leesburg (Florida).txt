Understand[edit]
History[edit]
The town was settled by Evander Lee in the 1850s, and his family chose their own last name for the town. When it was incorporated in 1875, it became the Sumter County seat until the county was divided 12 years later; Leesburg became a town of Lake County. Agriculture was important, and the watermelon crop became so successful that a Watermelon Festival was held annually from 1930 until 1957. During the Great Depression, the government built the 28.8043-81.87691 Venetian Park on Lake Harris' northern shore.
In the latter half of the 20th century, Leesburg's economy diversified from agriculture. 28.8249-81.78391 Lake Square Mall opened in 1980, though tragedy struck in 1982 when guitarist Randy Rhoads died in a plane crash in Leesburg. The cold winters of 1983-1984 and 1984-1985 brought an end to the citrus crop. Starting in 1997, the Leesburg Bikefest became important for the town, and it now attracts a quarter of a million people annually. Nearby Orlando and two colleges (Lake–Sumter State College and Beacon College) have become important in the local economy.
