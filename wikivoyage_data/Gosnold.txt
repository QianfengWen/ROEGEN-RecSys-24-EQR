Gosnold is a town in Massachusetts off of Cape Cod encompassing the nine Elizabeth Islands, including Cuttyhunk Island, Naushon Island, Pasque Island, Nashawena Island and some adjacent smaller islands that stretch out from Woods Hole village of Falmouth. Gosnold has the smallest population of any Massachusetts town. Gosnold separates Vineyard Sound from Buzzards Bay. The southernmost island of Cuttyhunk has most of the island chain's population and is the only island that is not entirely private. Less than one hundred people live there year-round.
Many boaters enjoy visiting the cozy harbor on day trips. Gosnold's entertainment is all provided by nature. Deer roam the island almost as if tame, but there are no movie theatres, nightclubs or tennis courts. Watch the sea. Enjoy quiet tranquility.

Cuttyhunk is a fascinating island. This is not the place to go to enjoy night life. Take long relaxing walks to the beach, to the old ship wreck, or the historic war fort (used to fight the British). It is the charm of the houses, the Inn, and the quaint little stores, that keep bringing people back.

Kayak, sail, or swim.
Walk to the historic fort.
