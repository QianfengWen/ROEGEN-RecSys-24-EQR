Understand[edit]
The tower seen from the sea
Torre Vado represents a seaside frazione of the municipality of Morciano di Leuca grew around the namesake watchtower, built in the 16th century as a protection against the Barbary corsairs.
The locality was nothing more than a small hamlet inhabited by fishermen until the mid-20th century, when the very first private houses were built. Since the 1990s the tourism started to grew up and this small Ionian village started to expand, becoming a quite famous place rich of resorts and bed and breakfasts.
Nowadays Torre Vado has less than 90 permanent inhabitants, although it can reach a summer attendance rate of more than 10,000 (Neapolitans and Swiss in particular).

In 1846 it became a simple custom control point by the order of king Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies and in 1930 it was sold to privates, that restored the tower five years later. The structure is now characterized by a cylindrical shape that resembles a sandcastle and it's decorated with battlements and lancet arch windows. The tower is not open to the public.
