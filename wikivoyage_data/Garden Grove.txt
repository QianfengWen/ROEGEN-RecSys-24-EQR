This all-glass church was home to the huge congregation built by the persistently up-beat Rev. Robert Schuller. This towering edifice, designed by noted architect Philip Johnson, was built for Schuller's television ministry. It was purchased by the Catholic Diocese of Orange in 2012. Christ Cathedral was rededicated in the summer of 2019 as the diocese's new mother church. The grounds are open, and tours are conducted Monday through Saturday at 10AM and 1PM. Daily and Sunday Mass is celebrated in the Arboretum.   (updated Oct 2023)
