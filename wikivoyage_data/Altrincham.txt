Altrincham is a town in Greater Manchester in the northwest of England. It was a small market town until the 18th century, then industrialised with the coming of the Bridgewater Canal and later the railway. Altrincham was historically in Cheshire, but in 1974 was re-assigned into the new entity of Greater Manchester, and became a commuter town for the big city. The main reason to visit is the thriving cafe culture centred on the market house together with Dunham Massey Hall, and Tatton Hall a few miles south.

Get in[edit]
Altrincham Town Hall
53.3875-2.34721 Altrincham Interchange. Has the tram, train and bus stations, and the main taxi rank.   (updated Dec 2023)

By plane[edit]
53.353889-2.2752 Manchester Airport (MAN IATA). Is only about 5 miles east of here, so a taxi is often a good option. D & G Bus 288 runs hourly (6:30AM-10:30PM) from the airport station to Altrincham Interchange (20 min), continuing to Timperley and East Didsbury. Otherwise, take the train into Piccadilly then the tram or train as described below; or if you've time on your hands take the tram from the airport and change at Cornbrook for the Altrincham tram, and reckon 90 min.   (updated Dec 2023)

By train[edit]
Long-distance train routes usually mean changing at Manchester Piccadilly, or at Victoria from some northern starting points. But trains from London Euston and the Midlands to Piccadilly also call at Stockport and this can be a quicker connection.
An hourly train runs from Piccadilly via Stockport to 53.3875-2.34723 Altrincham Interchange  (30 min) then continues through Knutsford to Chester.
These trains also call 53.3953-2.34334 Navigation Road at the north end of town, then the Interchange, then 53.378889-2.34755 Hale at the south end before trundling on across Cheshire.

By tram[edit]
Metrolink tram at the Interchange
Metrolink trams (green and purple lines) take 30 min from central Manchester via St Peters Square, Deansgate, Old Trafford, Stretford, Sale and Timperley to the Interchange. Altrincham is in Fare Zone 4 so a single journey is £4.60; trams run every 10 min or so 6AM-midnight. The purple line starts from Piccadilly; the green line starts from Bury and runs via Prestwich and Victoria then through city centre. Change in city centre for the other lines to Wythenshawe and the airport, to Imperial War Museum and Trafford Centre, through Piccadilly to Ashton-under-Lyne, through Victoria to Oldham and Rochdale, and to Salford Quays and Eccles. See TGM website for fare deals, service updates and travel planner; you must tap in and tap out with a card or buy your ticket before boarding.

By bus[edit]
Long-distance coaches don't serve Altrincham, change at Manchester city centre or the airport for local transport.
Arriva North West Bus 263 runs (6AM-11PM) from Manchester Piccadilly via Stretford and Sale to Altrincham Interchange. It takes an hour and runs every 15 min daytime.
Buses also run to Altrincham from Warrington, Lymm, Knutsford and Macclesfield.

By car[edit]
From London and most points south, follow M6 to jcn 19 then A556 / 56 north into town. From the north follow M60 onto A56, from the east follow M62 and M60 onto M56 then A560.
The direct road from central Manchester is A56 through Stretford. It was once the Roman road to Chester (Deva), and if you try it in rush hour you'll lurch along at XVIII thousands-of-paces per hour, slower than their chariots.

The street was demolished in 1960 to make way for flats. There's a blue plaque on the side of Phantong Thai Restaurant on Regent St, just south of the Travelodge.
Bee Bop a Raver is a glam-rock multicoloured, kinda scary bee, outside Myerson Solicitors at the junction of Barrington Road and Woodlands Road.

Walk or boat along the Bridgewater Canal, which passes north of town centre. It stretches 41 miles (66 km) from Wigan to Runcorn and is navigable throughout, with no locks. Opened in 1761, it's one of the earliest "true" canals, not a channeling of a natural river, and its commercial success sparked a frenzy of canal-building across Britain and Ireland. The towpath is in variable condition and in 2020 is only intermittently suitable for cycling. Multiple access points, eg the bridge on A56 Manchester Road, where there's a couple of pubs.
The Trans Pennine Trail meanders from Southport and Liverpool on the Irish Sea coast, right across the Pennines to York, Hull and Hornsea on the North Sea coast. It's suitable for walkers, cyclists and horse riders, and passes north of Altrincham and the Bridgewater canal. Westbound from town, you could join it just north of Oldfield Brow canal bridge: it follows an old railway embankment straight west through Dunham Massey village (but some distance from the Hall) and Lymm. Eastbound from Altrincham, it zigzags north along the edge of the housing towards the Mersey.
