Understand[edit]


“


Men of Harlech on to glory!
This will ever be your story
Keep these burning words before ye
Welshmen will not yield!

”


—Traditional Welsh patriotic song

Harlech is dominated by its castle, which has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Harlech Castle was built between 1283 and 1289 by Master James of St George for the English King Edward I, the conqueror of Wales. Designed on a concentric plan with a small but powerful inner ward dominated by an impressive twin-towered gatehouse and four round corner towers. It has many similarities with the Krak des Chevaliers, Crusader Castle in Syria, over which Harlech has an important advantage: its own water supply.
Harlech was seized by Owain Glyn Dŵr during a rebellion/secessionist war in 1404 and held successfully by him for four years.
The old town centre, where most shops and restaurants are, sits upon the hillside around the castle, with more recent development being on the plain beneath the castle. The only two roads linking the two parts directly are very steep and narrow, and one is one-way (down) only.
