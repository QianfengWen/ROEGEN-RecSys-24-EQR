North Sydney is an important port in Atlantic Canada, serving as the western terminus of the Marine Atlantic ferry service. It acts as the marine link for the Trans-Canada Highway to Newfoundland and is often called "the Gateway to Newfoundland". Marine Atlantic ferries operate from North Sydney's terminal to the ports of Channel-Port aux Basques and Argentia.

History[edit]
North Sydney was settled around 1785 by Europeans and by Loyalists fleeing the American Revolution. It emerged as a major shipbuilding centre in the early 19th century, building many brigs and brigantines for the English market, later moving on to larger barques. Wooden shipbuilding declined in the 1860s, but increasing numbers of steamships began arriving, drawn to North Sydney for bunker coal.
