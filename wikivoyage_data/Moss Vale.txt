If you don't.  The town shopping centre is easily walkable.  But there isn't much there, and it isn't really a tourist attraction in its own right.

There is a limited bus service operated by Berrima Bus Lines.  There is limited service on Saturdays, and no service on Sundays.

Do[edit]
-34.532957150.3922611 Cycle the Bong Bong Cycleway. A 5km cycleway follows the Wingecarribee River past the historic location of the Bong Bong township. Not much of the old township remains, but the cycleway by the side of the river is flat, and pleasant. You can bring a bike from Sydney on the train. The cycleway extends to the station at Burradoo. 
-34.55150.3833332 Leighton Gardens, Argyle St. 24 hours. A pleasant park sandwiched between the train line and the main street, just south of the train station, Leighton Gardens is most interesting on a Monday morning, when you can sit in the park and watch all the hungover people waiting outside the courts for their DUI hearing arising from the weekend's partying.
