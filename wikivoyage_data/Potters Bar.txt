Orientation[edit]
Wylliott's Manor, formerly a manor house and now a pub/restaurant
Potters Bar has 2 main parallel shopping streets: High Street (A1000) with the Bus Garage and Darkes Lane with the Railway Station - which are linked by The Walk.

History[edit]
Its name may refer to the fact that pottery was manufactured here in Roman times. The town, dating from the early 13th century, was small but on the coaching route between Barnet and Hatfield. The 'Bar' may refer to a toll gate on the Great North Road (now the A1000). It began growing when the Great Northern Railway was built through it in 1850.
