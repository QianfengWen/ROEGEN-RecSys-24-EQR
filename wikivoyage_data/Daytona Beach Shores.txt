Daytona Beach Shores is a city in Volusia County, East Central Florida. It's an important part of Daytona Beach's tourism, whether local or not, and offers an alternative to those who prefer the beach to NASCAR and the other activities of Daytona Beach.


Understand[edit]
Daytona Beach Shores was formed in 1960 by a group of moteliers who called themselves "2,000 Cottages." This relatively new city was incorporated in 1967, and stretches for 5½ miles along South Atlantic Ave., (A1A) along the Atlantic Ocean. Continuing south, the scenic community of Ponce Inlet is located at the southern tip of the peninsula.
Because of the similarity in names, Daytona Beach Shores is frequently confused with Daytona Beach, which borders to the north. Daytona Beach Shores is much smaller with fewer hotels and a higher concentration of condominiums instead of hotels.
