Leiden (historically known as Leyden) is easily one of the most enchanting cities in the Netherlands. It's home to the oldest university in the country, the birthplace of Rembrandt and breeding ground for ground-breaking science and Nobel laureates for centuries. It's a charmingly compact fortified city, packed with well-preserved historic heritage but with a young and lively atmosphere due to its large student population.

With a population of nearly 125,000 (2019), and nearly 30,000 of them students, Leiden is one of the Netherlands' few true student towns (along with Groningen, Utrecht and Delft). Leiden University is the Netherlands' oldest university, founded in the 16th century to commemorate the resistance of its townsfolk to the Spanish siege. Its buildings are dotted around town, in and out of the city centre. This gives Leiden a relatively young and internationally diverse population, especially with the university having a particularly strong law and medical faculty. The Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) is right behind central station. Its vibrant student population means Leiden is never short of a great place for a drink. However Leiden's Dutch students are notorious for being dominated by its 'Studentenverenigingen' (fraternities) which means many international students choose to go to nearby Amsterdam, or the Hague for late-night partying.

Map of Leiden


By train[edit]
Leiden is easily reached by train. The journey takes 10–15 minutes from The Hague, and 15 minutes from Schiphol Airport, the principal airport in the Netherlands. The journey from Amsterdam takes between 30 and 40 minutes. Trains run by NS (including all that arrive in Leiden) are now all accessible using your bank card.

52.1661284.4820361 Leiden Centraal. Most of the trains arrive at this station, which is 500 m north-west of the City Center, and 1 km from the City Hall. There are luggage storage lockers at the station.   (updated May 2023)
52.1467174.4928852 Leiden Lammenschans. It is a relatively small station on the line towards Alphen aan den Rijn and Utrecht. It is on the opposite side of the city center, just over 1 km from the City Hall. (updated Jul 2016)
If you do not feel like walking from the station to the centre you can take a bus, just ask which ones go to the Breestraat bus stop (see #By bus below).

By bus[edit]
A square just outside of the Leiden railway station is a central hub for the local bus network, so if you want to go anywhere local your best bet is to go here and ask around.

 Arriva. Provides public bus services in the city. As elsewhere in the country OV-chipkaart is to be used to pay public transport fares here, otherwise a single journey ticket could be bought from the driver. For schedules check this page. Select "met Bus" at Reiswijzde, fill in Leiden at "Plaats", then select a busline from a pulldown list. Single journey ticket €2. (updated Jul 2016)
 EBS. Operates 3 regional bus routes from Leiden towards The Hague/Zoetermeer. (updated Apr 2023)
By car[edit]
In spite of the two highways around Leiden (A4 and A44), the centre of Leiden isn't easy to reach by car. It is best to try and park your car at the transferium (free parking) and continue your journey by bus. For this transferium you have to follow the A44 and then take exit 8 (Katwijk, Leiden Transferium). There are also parking lots on the Morsweg (south-west of the town centre) and on the Langegracht (north of town centre, near the station). These parking lots are crowded though, and there's no guarantee there will be space here, especially during the summer. Otherwise there are parking lots at the Groenoordhallen and Haagweg from where free shuttle buses run to the city center. In the city center the parking fares are expensive. Also outside the old city center (inside the 'Singel' canal) parking is not free in most cases. Only far away from the center will free parking be found. A normal charge is €4.60 per hour. Leiden is perpetually rebuilding main roads and areas around the centre, making it very difficult to drive by car. The never ending rebuilding of main roads also guarantees major daily traffic jams at the rush hours.

Get around[edit]
The large majority of sights are within the old city fortifications. It's a compact area, easy to navigate on foot. The tourist information office right outside the main train station has a number of free and paid maps with main sights and walking routes, but even just strolling around for a while will allow you to see the main historic buildings and museums.
For faster exploring or to visit places further out, renting a bicycle is an excellent idea. Like all Dutch cities, Leiden is very bike-friendly and you'll find it's an extremely widely used means of transport where-ever you go. Some rental agencies offer both traditional and electric bikes.

 Park&Bike, Haagweg 8, ☏ +31 71 763 07 29. This place is a bit out of the main center, and is a good choice for those who arrive by car, as you can leave it there. They offer several arrangements or routes at a charge, but it's also perfectly fine to take only a bike and find your own way. Rates start at €12.50 for a day to €6 a day if you rent a full week. Electric bicycles are available from €20 a day, scooters from €30 a day. Make online reservations in advance to ensure you get the bike of your choice. 
 Fietspoint Oldenburger, Stationsplein 3-S, at the north entrance of the main train station (that's the LUMC side), ☏ +31 71 512 0068. This place has about 20 Batavus bicycles available for rent, and some electrical ones (which are more expensive). Best to phone ahead and ensure you'll have one when arriving. From €7.50 for a day (or part of a day).

Landmarks[edit]
Stadhuis
52.1582834.4908871 Stadhuis (City Hall), Stadhuisplein, 1. The old renaissance façade facing Breestraat is dating from 1597. A newer building lying behind this façade (facing Nieuwe Rijn) was built to replace the older one, destroyed in a fire in 1929.  (updated Jun 2016)
52.1589744.49242 Burcht van Leiden (Fort of Leiden), Burgsteeg 13-16. An old shell keep dated back to 11th century. This elevated borough is freely accessible and right in the heart of Leiden.

52.1570074.4854823 Academiegebouw (Academy Building), Rapenburg 73. The old university building still used for ceremonies and a few studies. (updated Jun 2016)
52.1576244.4878184 Pieterskerk. The Church of St. Peter (the patron saint of the city) is a 16th-century church, in late-Gothic style. A feature which Americans will find interesting is that this church is associated with the Pilgrim Fathers, whose leader John Robinson, lived in the nearby Pieterskerkchoorsteeg (house is marked with a plaque). The church features a small exhibition on the Pilgrims in Leiden. People buried here include the physician Boerhaave, the painter Jan Steen (of Rijksmuseum fame) and the Pilgrim leader Robinson.   
52.1579914.4942195 Hooglandse Kerk. Dedicated to St Pancras and located at the site of an earlier wooden chapel dating from 1314.

Other sites[edit]
52.1595794.4923418 Oude Rijn (Old Rhine Canal). An old branch of the Rhine River is little more than a city canal here. Historically, this waterway is what gave the area its importance, first as a Roman border, then during the Golden Age as a trade route. Nowadays, river traffic doesn't use this branch and the river just serves to fill the city's canals with water. The area between the Oude Rijn and Nieuwe Rijn is one of the most undisturbed bits of Leiden - go here if you like walking along canals without getting run over by shoppers. On the other side of the city centre (Weddesteeg, Galgewater) is the place where the canals recombine - this is one of the most beautiful spots in Leiden, with a windmill, the old city gate, a small park, and a wooden bridge over the river (see also the image at the head of this article). (updated Jun 2016)

Van der Werff Park (c. 1900)
52.1555114.49065120 Van der Werffpark. It is named after the mayor Pieter Adriaanszoon van der Werff, who defended the town against the Spaniards in 1574, 6 years into the Eighty Years' War of Independence (1568-1648) against the Spaniards. The town was beleaguered for months and many died from hunger. According to legend van der Werff was accused by a frantic crowd of secretly hiding food reserves. He denied it vehemently and to prove his sincerity offered to cut off his arm to serve as food. This made people back off, ashamed of their mistrust. The Van der Werff Park is one of the small parks in Leiden's centre and is probably the most interesting one due to its history. There used to be blocks of houses here but during the cold afternoon of January 12, 1807, a disaster occurred. A ship filled with 18 tons of gunpowder blew up, leveling the surrounding blocks of houses on both sides of the canal and killing hundreds in the process. It's claimed the explosion was heard in Groningen, 250 km away. Years later, the area was turned into a park on one side and a laboratory was built on the other; the Kamerlingh Onnes laboratory: famed for at one time being the coldest place on earth, where helium was liquefied for the first time, and superconductivity discovered, which earned Kamerlingh Onnes a Nobel Prize.

Museums[edit]
Leiden is one of the most important museum cities in the Netherlands, in quantity only second to Amsterdam. Four national museums are located in Leiden, among others, that are worth to visit.

Boat hire can be a great way to see Leiden, but you're not allowed to moor just anywhere. For that very reason, boating should mostly be considered a way of sightseeing than a means to get around to different locations. That said, it is an excellent way to see Leiden, whether you're opting for a seat on one of the larger round trip boats, book a private tour or rent your own little boat and make your own route.
Boat tours - Only Amsterdam has more water inside its old center than Leiden, making a boat trip through the canals a lovely pass-time and a great way to see the city from another angle. The beautiful canal-side streets were the domain of the elite in the Dutch Golden Age, and the expensive mansions they built make for lovely monumental canal tours today. You can opt for a guided tour or rent your own boat.
There are a few different boating companies operating small and large vessels with guided tours. Head to the Beestenmarkt, on the way from the train station to the city center, where boat trips leave every hour and pleasant cafés make waiting for the next one a comfortable experience. Large groups can rent boats (including skipper/guide) by the hour and most companies can offer arrangements including food or drinks if you make reservations in advance.

Events[edit]
 Leiden International Film Festival. A small yearly film festival in October encompassing mainstream and smaller art-house films shown at a variety of museums and cinemas throughout town. It gets some Dutch premieres.   
Leidsche bluesweek A yearly festival with performances by mainly (but not exclusively) Dutch performers. The Wednesday night pub-crawl is a blast with many bars hosting live music (for other venues you do have to buy tickets though they're not expensive).
 Werfpop (in Dutch). A small-scale music festival with performances ranging from metal to dance. July. 
 Leidsche lakenfeesten (in Dutch). A week of different activities in the city center and on the canals. There's a culinary festival, and the museum night. June. 
 3 October celebrations (3 Oktober Vereniging). Celebrations commemorating the end of the Spanish siege of Leiden (in 1547). Part of the festivities is a huge fun fair. The festival is overwhelming, noisy and heavily beer drinking. The town hall has strongly increased policing and crowd management of the event to make it reasonably safe to visit. Beware that in evening hours, it still remains more like a mega pub crawl than a family event. 
A comprehensive program of all of the festivals and activities can be found at the VVV site.

Learn[edit]
It is said that Leiden isn't a city with a university in it, but a university with a city around it. Leiden University was founded in 1575. Internationally recognised, Leiden University houses more than 40 national and international research institutes. The university is particularly well known for its law programs, and has a very strong medical faculty, attracting students from all over Europe. The international community is very strong, organising great parties throughout the year. For more information about studying as an international student at Leiden read the leidener[dead link], a blog run by some international students.

On Thursday, shops are open late, till around 21:00 (koopavond).
Historically, all the city's lively markets were situated along the Nieuwe Rijn canal. Some names of the bridges over this canal remain as reminders of the trades that took place there once. There's the "buttermilk's bridge", the covered "grain bridge" and the "chicken bridge", to name a few. Today, there are only two general markets. On Saturdays from 07:00 and on Wednesdays from 12:00, there is an open market along the canal between the Nieuwe Rijn and Vismarkt streets. The one on Saturday is larger, but at both there are stalls with vegetables, fruits, fish, flowers, bread, and meat.

Leiden has a lot of restaurants and bars. Especially in the Pieterswijk (the east side of the Breestraat) are a lot of cosy restaurants.
Some of the restaurants in Leiden:

Delphi, Nieuwe rijn 52, 0715141778. This restaurant serves the best Greek food in Leiden and can get quite busy because of its great value for money.
Donattelo's, Haarlemmerstraat 20,  071 5147938. Good pizza, if you enjoy a student atmosphere!
La Piccola Italia Boommarkt 2, A small restaurant that makes good pizzas and pasta dishes. Good value.
 Olive Garden. Vrouwenkerkhof 1, 071 51.22.529, Italian. Not pizza, but true Italian food. Not cheap, reservations a must on Thursday, Friday and Weekends. (This is not the same restaurant as the popular chain in the United States.) 
Porto Pino, Haven 40, 071 5219505. Serves the same type of delicious Italian foods as 'Olive garden' so no Pizza! It's a bit to the east of the centre at the recreational harbour, near the Zijlpoort.
Sabai Sabai, Noordeinde, 071 51.31.914, Thai. Best Thai in town, visited even by Thai embassy officials.

Tandoori way Indian restaurant next to the Praethuis bar (see under drinking section) opposite the remains of the 'onze lieve vrouwe kerk' and Olive garden

AK-AL At the corner of the Haarlemmerstraat and the Pelikaanstraat (opposite the English pub called Bad Habits) serves delicious Turkish Pizza's on the go and the infamous 'Kapsalon' (French Fries, topped with doner kebab meat, lettuce, onions, cheese, spicy sauce and garlic sauce) which will fill you up for the rest of the week. It's also a bakery offering tasty Turkish and loaf-type breads and great croissants!
Eazy Oriental style wok dishes. Freshly made, delicious and healthy. Breestraat 157, 2311 CN Leiden. +31 (0) 71 5138867
Maoz Vegetarian Falafel and more falafel and pretty good too. Haarlemmerstraat 61, 2312 DL, +31 (0) 5144424‎
Toko-mini Excellent Indonesian food, take-away only. Indonesian food can be very hot and spicy, but you have a choice of ingredients, just ask. Haven 6, 2312 MH, +31 (0) 71 5233066
If you don't find anything of your liking above, there's a plethora of places offering anything from French fries to Shoarma and Pizza and yes; there is a McDonald's (two in fact).

Drink[edit]
The city is full of students, and cafes and bars are clearly by far the most frequented 'faculty'. There is a healthy and lively cafe and night life. You cannot help wondering if the students actually get time to study from time to time between the many festivities and drink parties all over town. If you are out for a drink, you will not be disappointed. Be aware that you can't enter the bars after 01:00 and after 02:00 on Friday and Saturday.

Bars[edit]
Einstein Great for lounging on summertime evenings. Popular on Wednesday evenings (International Student Night).
De Burcht Grand cafe, a mix of 1930s grandeur and 1950s and 60s furniture. Hosts a quiz night every Tuesday for €2 per person (maximum 6 to a team, with usually with wine as the prize).
Haar gangetje Small but cosy cafe.
De Kroeg Fun staff, fun atmosphere, fun times.
The Duke of OZ Great place to follow Football, Cricket and other sports.
Roebels Tiny but usually packed student bar. Famous for its 'Zwevertjes' (shots)

Olo Rosso A bar for most of the week but in the weekends it turns into a club.
In den Oude Maren Poort Larger, and usually packed student bar.
Lemmy's Belgian beer bar. Free peanuts and digital fireplace!
De Twee Spieghels Cozy, friendly, fabulous location (near the Burcht and Hooglandsekerk).
Dranklokaal de WW Hidden in a small back alley opposing the Breestraat entrance of the Stadhuis, this place is hugely popular in the weekends. The place has been cut into 2 equal sections since the smoking ban came into effect and the smoking section is the biggest in Leiden
Praethuis A local haunt with a dark interior coupled with dark brown furnishings and finishings and mainly 1960s and 70s music. It has a great terrace around the remains of the 'onze lieve vrouwenkerk' (of pilgrim fame).

Music and clubs[edit]
 Het Muziekhuis (formely knows as Qbus), Middelstegracht 123. (Dutch) Different types of live music and ranging from local heroes to international names. 
 CityHall (located at the back of the Stadhuis). Billed as a cafe/restaurant, it's really a bit of everything and gets crowded on Friday and Saturday evenings. There is a DJ on these days. 
 Club Next. Three floors. Upstairs smoking area, middle floor is just a bar, and the ground floor has a decent dancing area. Allegedly the club where world number one DJ Armin Van Buuren learnt to ply his trade. Usually no cover. 
Coffeeshops[edit]
Like every other town in the Netherlands Leiden doesn't lack the presence of cannabis selling Coffeeshops. This town definitely has a few nice options if you're interested. They are open between 16:00 and 22:00.

Leidseplein Pieterskerkgracht 28. Probably the most popular coffee shop in all of Leiden. Great atmosphere and classy decor. Next door to the bar Sam Sam.
Bebop A stones throw from Leidseplein, Diefsteeg 3.
Le Palais Friendly personnel, Morsstraat 14.
Sleep[edit]
There are plenty of good mid-range hotels and B&Bs in the city. But there's no youth hostel and sleeping in town for less than €50 per room can be challenging. If your budget is tight, you might consider visiting Leiden on a day trip while staying in hostels in the area or bring your camping gear. There's a hostel in Noordwijk (10 km) and The Hague also has options, with a "fast biking" route to Leiden (<1 hr by bike). Amsterdam is a half-hour trip by train, but calculate that the return ticket will set you back about €17.

 Stochemhoeve Camping, ☏ +31  71 5721141. Cronesteyn 3. A family-managed small camping near a park and recreational area just outside of Leiden. 
 Nieuw Minerva. Boommarkt 23. In six prestigious 16th-century canal houses. Central, close to museums and faculties of Leiden University. 
 De Doelen. Rapenburg 2. Hotel in an ancient Patrician mansion, built in 1638. 
Golden Tulip, Schipholweg 3. In a bland modern building just north of the railway station.
 Huys van Leyden, Oude Singel 212, ☏ +31 71 2 600 700. If you're not on a budget, sleeping in this small 4-star boutique hotel will make your historic experience complete. Housed in a monumental building, all rooms have their own style and while equipped with modern bathrooms and comfortable beds, they have a nice historic feel to them. The hotel has no elevator (due to its monumental status) and there's no AC, but staff is very friendly and will help you with your luggage. There's a small sauna and whirlpool available for guests. From €113 for a double, breakfast €7.50. 
 Fletcher Wellness-Hotel (formerly Hampshire Hotel), Bargelaan 180 (Building on the left when exiting the train station at the north side), ☏ +31 71 870 0260. A new hotel in a large building right outside the north side of the main train station. The surrounding area is still a bit under construction, making it slightly hard to locate, but the rooms are modern and comfortable, there's wellness centre in the building (use at a discounted rate) and a nice bar/restaurant with a view on the top floor. If you're arriving by car you can make use of the parking garage under the building, but note that the entrance is not well-indicated. Ignore the sign of "buses only" when you see the building, and proceed another 25 meters or so to see the parking garage. All rooms are on the 10th or 11th floor; ask for one with a view over the old city. Book through online booking sites for the best deals. From €90 for a double. (updated Jul 2021)
Connect[edit]
Some cafes and fast food places have free WiFi. Ask the cafe staff for advice. Leiden is a student town, free WiFi is highly appreciated there. There are also 'hot spots' e.g. at the station, however, these are run by the previous state monopoly 'KPN'. These are free to use.
Free WiFi is also provided in various places in Leiden by Stichting Wireless Leiden[dead link], you can recognize this by a SSID which start with 'ap-WirelessLeiden-'.

Go next[edit]
Leiden is a city in the Green Heart (Groene Hart) between the largest cities in Holland. It is surrounded by green meadows, little villages, and, in spring time, the world famous flower fields.
From Leiden Central Station a bus (number 54) goes directly to the Keukenhof, a huge park open from the end of March until the end of May, in which more than 7 million flower bulbs bloom. But you can also take your car or rent a bike and find the fields yourself. The route will lead you through lovely villages.
Bordering Leiden is the town of Oegstgeest, where you could visit the CORPUS, an interactive walk-through giant human body installation.
Leiden is also very close to the beach: Katwijk and Noordwijk aan Zee are the closest seaside villages, at 20 minutes by car. Be aware that on beautiful summer days, the car will probably be stuck in traffic. You can also take a bicycle, which will take you approximately 45 minutes.
Cycle routes in the Leiden area (in English):

Keukenhof Cycle Route.
Leiden Lakes Cycle Route.
