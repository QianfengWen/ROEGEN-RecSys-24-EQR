Not to be confused with Clark Airport in the Philippines.

Clark is a city in  Union County, New Jersey. It is a suburban town of around 16,000 (2019) that is 13 miles from  Newark.
The town was founded in 1864 when the residents of the 5th ward of Rahway city decided to break away to establish the city. They named it after Abraham Clark, one of the signatories to the Declaration of Independence. What used to be a predominantly agricultural area till the middle of the twentieth century enjoyed a housing boom after 1949 when the Garden State Parkway cut through this town.
The town is not a tourist attraction by any stretch. If you are visiting, you're probably here on business.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The closest airport is the Newark Liberty International Airport. As this is one of the busiest airports in the country, you should not have any trouble reaching there.

By car[edit]
Clark lies on Exit 135 of the Garden State Parkway.

By bus[edit]
NJ Transit runs a solitary bus service to Clark, the bus number 112 starting from the terminal in  New York.  Of course, transfers are available. Use their trip planner to plan your commute.

By train[edit]
The nearest railroad station is Garwood on the Raritan valley line, which goes both to the Newark Penn station and the New York Penn station.

Get around[edit]
The city may be small, but it is not small enough to be covered on foot. You can rent a car from Rahway. If you plan to walk it, some places away from the shopping areas can be lonely at night.
