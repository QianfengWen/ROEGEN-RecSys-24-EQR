Brindisi (Salentino: Brìnnisi) is a medium-sized city of Apulia, southern Italy. It is the third largest city of Salento Peninsula (the "heel" of the Italian "boot") and one of the busiest ports of the Adriatic Sea.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
The Roman column marking the end of the Via Appia
The city was founded by the Messapians, a population of Illyrian origin, with the name of Brunda, meaning "deer's head". This name is due to the natural harbor which resembles the shape of the animal's antlers. The city assumed the name of Brention and then Brentèsion in Ancient Greek, to be later called Brundisium after the conquest by the Romans in 267 BC.
Brundisium reached a population of 100,000 and became the main commercial port of the Roman Empire, with heavy traffic towards Greece and the Middle East that continues today. The city was connected with Rome by the Via Traiana and the Via Appia, whose terminus is still visible today. Virgil died here on September 21 of 19 BC, after a voyage to Greece, where he caught a fever.
Brindisi's golden age ended in the early Middle Ages with invasions by the Ostrogoths, Lombards and Saracens that destroyed the city several times. It was later rebuilt and annexed by the Normans to the Kingdom of Sicily in 1130 and became one the major ports for the Crusaders headed to Holy Land. The town was dominated by Swabian, Angevin, Aragonese, Venetian, Spanish and Austrian kingdoms, and then ruled by the Bourbons from 1735 to 1860.
After Italian unification — and especially with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 — a new positive period started for Brindisi. Between September 1943 and February 1944 the city functioned as the temporary government seat of Italy, and hosted King Victor Emmanuel III, Pietro Badoglio and a part of the Italian armed forces command in September 1943 after the armistice with Italy.

By car[edit]
Surrounding areas, such as beaches to the north, are best reached by car.

On foot[edit]
As the city center area is not so large, a bit over a kilometer from the train station to the Roman Columns, most of the sights in the city center can be seen in an afternoon on foot. Because of many military facilities in the surroundings of Brindisi, areas north or south of the city center are not easy (or very pleasant) to reach on foot. For most things outside of the center, it is better to take a bus or rent a car.
