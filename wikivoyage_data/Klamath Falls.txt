Klamath Falls (sometimes called Klamath by locals) is a small Southern Oregon city found in the eastern foothills of the Cascade Range. Klamath Falls is at the southern end of Klamath Lake in the large Klamath Basin. Klamath enjoys quite spectacular views. Snow-covered Mount Shasta, one of the most prominent peaks in the United States, can be seen on the southern horizon, and the outlying areas are filled with acres of farmland. Popular with outdoor enthusiasts, birdwatchers, history buffs, and fans of rural America, Klamath is a place many people are glad they didn't miss.


Understand[edit]
Klamath Falls is surrounded by two lakes and two rivers. It was founded as Linkville in 1867 at the mouth of the short Link River, which drains Klamath Lake into Lake Ewauna. In turn, Lake Ewauna is the source of the Klamath River, one of only two rivers that flow across the Cascade Mountains, a distinction shared with the great Columbia River. Linkville changed its name to Klamath Falls in 1893 and was incorporated in 1905.
Locals like to joke about tourists and other outsiders naively asking, "Where are the falls?" The fact is, Klamath Falls got its name from rapids on the Link River. The average person seeing these rapids today might wonder who on earth would call them "falls," especially now that a small hydroelectric dam on the river has dropped the water level, making the whitewater at the rapids less remarkable. Although this is probably what most locals mean when they joke, "Where are the falls?", a few are truly clueless and may just be flaunting their ironically naive understanding of "the truth"—in which case, the joke's on them!
Klamath Falls is on Pacific Time. Standard time is UTC−8, and daylight saving time is UTC−7. This is three hours behind New York, and typically eight hours behind London.

Get around[edit]
By car[edit]
Klamath Falls is fairly easy to navigate by car. Downtown has a small network of one-way streets. Major thoroughfares include Main Street, Klamath Avenue, Oregon Avenue, California Avenue, South 6th Street (one branch of Highway 39), East Main Street, Washburn Way, the Crater Lake Parkway (the other branch of Highway 39), Shasta Way, Homedale Road, and the Southside Bypass (Highway 140).
Some streets have directions (South 6th Street, East Main St, etc.). Numbered streets are divided by Main Street into north and south, but otherwise there is little logic to the system. For example, Main Street extends east to Crater Lake Parkway, but before it gets there, East Main Street branches off and runs southeast, then south, to South 6th Street.

By bus[edit]
Basin Transit Service (BTS) provides bus public transit around Klamath Falls. BTS is in service Monday through Friday from 6:30AM to 7:30PM, and Saturday from 10AM to 4:30PM. Bus fare is $1.50 per trip (75¢ for senior and disabled riders), with transfer slips available. A day pass costs $3; it saves money to get one if you know you will take the bus at least twice in the day (or at least four times if you pay discounted fare).
Two mainline routes (1 and 2) run from the Oregon Institute of Technology at the north end of town to the south end. Four feeder routes (3/5 and 4/6) connect with the mainline routes at two transfer stations downtown (7th and Pine) and at the Klamath County Fairgrounds (South 6th and Altamont).

By foot[edit]
Downtown is walkable, but the whole city is spread out and not very walkable.

By bike[edit]
Numerous bike paths run all over the city, providing a full day's worth of biking. The local buses have bike racks on the front bumper.

Phone numbers
Back when telephone numbers were often given with exchange names, sometimes the fictitious "KLamath 5-xxxx" was used (in addition to "KLondike 5-xxxx") in the media when a fictional phone number was needed. "KL 5" corresponds to "555" in modern-day fake American phone numbers.


Public Internet access, including wifi, is available at the Klamath County Library.
