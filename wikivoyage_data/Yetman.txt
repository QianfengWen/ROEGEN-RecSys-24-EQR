Understand[edit]
Yetman is located on the Macintyre River about 30 km south of the Queensland border. The area was once occupied by the Bigambul people, who used to fish here. The first farm, Yetman Station, was established in 1837 by settlers who followed the trail of the European explorer Allan Cunningham. The town is associated with the beef cattle and horse industries, with sheep, wool, and timber industries developing later. The surrounding farmland was reclaimed from rabbits and prickly pear in the 1920s, with wheat farming being established by the 1950s. Some crops are also grown on the river flats. Yetman is in the Inverell Shire Local Government Area.
