Pevek (Russian: Певек) is a town in Chukotka in the extreme northeast of the country and the northernmost town in Russia.


Understand[edit]
Once an important naval base and port in the Arctic, this town has lost more than half of its population since the fall of Soviet Union in 1991. There are today just 4,700 residents left although the future looks a little brighter with the opening of the Northern Sea Route.

Get in[edit]
There is a small 69.783170.6031 airport, 18 kilometers northeast of Pevek with regular flights by ChukotAVIA from Anadyr and Bilibino and Utair from Moscow-Vnukovo. The usual schedule is two to three flights per month during winter season, slightly more in summer.
Overland travel is limited to an ice road from Bilibino that can be traversed by 4x4 vehicles. Travelling in convoys is strongly recommended.
