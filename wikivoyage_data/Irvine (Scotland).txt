Irvine is a town in Ayrshire on the Clyde coast, with a population of 34,130 in 2020. It's post-industrial and is best-known as one of the postwar "New Towns" built across lowland Scotland. A number of regeneration projects have begun and flopped, and Irvine's main role now is as a commuter town for Glasgow. It's given birth to two First Ministers of Scotland, Jack McConnell (in office 2001-2007) and Nicola Sturgeon (from 2014). 


Understand[edit]
This "new town" has been inhabited since the Stone Age and in the 13th century was capital of Scotland. Backed by fertile farmland and a lowland transport corridor through the hills, it was one of a series of ports along the Clyde coast. The river was shallow and prone to silting, but the Clyde at Glasgow was even worse. Industries such as linen developed, and (at a safe distance) explosives - but eventually after a fashion they blew the harbour away. In the 19th century Nitroglycerin and similar inventions of that clever Alfred Nobel made it possible to blast a deep channel up to Glasgow, which then prospered as the downstream ports declined. 
In the 1960s Scotland's housing was in a poor state, and the response was to build a series of New Towns across the lowland belt. Four of these were greenfield:  Livingstone, East Kilbride, Cumbernauld and Glenrothes. At Irvine the plan was to graft the new onto an existing town, producing an odd mixture of slabby burbs, Victorian provincial town and odd charming Georgian survival. A sixth New Town near Hamilton was never built, and the project was wound up in 1996.

55.6052-4.69422 Pilot House is the gaunt structure at the mouth of the river that looks like a fire station tower. Built in 1906, it housed Boyd's automatic tide signalling apparatus - absolutely unique, since no-one else in their right mind ever sought to construct another. The River Irvine was always prone to silting, compounded by the confluence of the River Garnock, and the sand bar at the mouth could trap shipping in or out for weeks on end. Dredging and channelling had some impact but approaching skippers needed to know the water level. A Heath-Robinson arrangement of pulleys, flags and balls signalled this from the tower. The entire harbour fell into disuse in the 1970s, losing its freight though small fishing and leisure craft still moor here. Schemes to redevelop the derelict tower have come to nothing, have they considered flumes?
Grannie Stane in the river between the shopping centre and Trinity is often made out to be the last survivor of a megalithic stone circle, but it's just a glacial erratic boulder. The Clyde coast is littered with these, and elsewhere (notably in Kilcreggan and  Millport) they've been turned into works of art. But this one is barely keeping its nose above water since a weir was built downstream.

Trinity Church dominates the skyline just east of the shopping centre. It's a Gothic building of 1863, which was the Free Church for a century then closed in the 1960s and degenerated into a huge smelly pigeon-loft. Restoration began in 2009 and is still under way.
Seagate Castle is a picturesque stump on the east river bank. It was built around the 14th century and abandoned in 1746.
Glasgow Vennel off High Street is the charming cobbled road that in the 18th century was the main thoroughfare inland from the harbour.
55.6175-4.66863 Wellwood Burns Centre (Irvine Burns Club), 28 Eglinton St, Irvine KA12 8AS, ☏ +44 1294 274511. By advance booking only, Apr-Sep: W F Sa 2-5PM; Oct-Mar: Sa 2-5PM. Robert Burns worked for a time in a flax mill on Glasgow Vennel, and made copious use of the town pubs. In 1826 Irvine Burns Club was formed to commemorate his life and works, and remains active. It holds several original manuscripts and other memorabilia, which you can see here. Free.   (updated Sep 2022)
Dreghorn two miles east has an unusual octagonal church built in 1780. This village (not to be confused with Dreghorn the army district of Edinburgh) was the birthplace of John Boyd Dunlop, inventor of the pneumatic tyre. It also claims to be the oldest continuously inhabited village in Europe, as when new housing was built in 2003, remains were found dating through medieval times to 3500 BC. These were removed to museums and the houses completed, so there's nothing of ancient Dreghorn to see nowadays.
