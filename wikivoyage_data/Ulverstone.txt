Not to be confused with Ulverston, a market town in Cumbria, United Kingdom.

Ulverstone is a seaside town on the Northwest Coast of Tasmania, at the mouth of the Leven River. It lies roughly halfway along the freeway between Devonport and Burnie, though it's slightly closer to Devonport.



Understand[edit]
Ulverstone is located on the Leven River. It has many nice cafes and boutique shops.

Get in[edit]
Bus services (Metro Tasmania, Mersey Link and Redline) operate in and around Ulverstone and connect to other destinations around the state. However, driving a private car is the easiest and fastest option to travel around Tasmania.

Get around[edit]

Walking is the best way to get around the town as all of the main areas are within a fifteen-minute walking distance.
The Bass Highway forms a freeway ring road around the southern end of town with three eastbound exits and four westbound exits, but these are spaced very close to each other and a 2–3-kilometre (1.2–1.9 mi) drive from the coast, so it's often faster using local roads.
