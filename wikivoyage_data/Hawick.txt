Hawick is a town in the Scottish Borders, midway along the historic route from Carlisle to Edinburgh, with a population of 10,630 in 2020.  The main reason to come is to explore the hills and forests above the town.


Understand[edit]
It's pronounced hoick, one syllable, like the act of kicking a rugby ball high into the air. Several townsfolk have proved adept at doing so but Hawick's best-loved contributor to rugby, Bill McLaren (1923-2010), found fame as a commentator after illness ended his playing career. The town was also the birthplace in 1940 of the yachtsman Chay Blyth. 
"Hawick" in Old English means an enclosed farm. It stands at the confluence of the River Teviot and Slitrig Water, which from the 17th century were harnessed to power textile mills. Its initial business was budget staples such as stockings, then the mills moved into linen and knitware, practical tweeds then high-end cashmere and merino. The term "Tweed" began here as a 19th-century typo: twill was "tweel" in Scots but a London merchant thought it was a trade name for Tweed valley produce, and the name stuck. Hawick survived the 20th-century decline of the UK textile industry, but then the luxury sector also succumbed, and the town lost major employers such as Pringle. Other Border towns have been boosted by the re-opening of the railway, becoming commuter towns for Edinburgh, but Hawick is a little too far out to benefit.
In October 2021 the town was flooded, but all amenities described on this page were back in business in 2022.

Local information[edit]

Get in[edit]
Hawick is on the A7, 43 miles north of Carlisle and 50 miles south of Edinburgh. From eastern and southern England the quickest route is A1 to Newcastle, A696 / A68 to the Scottish border on windy Carter Bar, then A6088 through Bonchester Bridge to Hawick. 
Borders Bus X95 runs every two hours daily from Edinburgh along A7 via Galashiels and Selkirk to Hawick, taking 2 hours. It's quicker to take the train from Edinburgh to Galashiels then change to the X95, which between Galashiels and Hawick runs every 30 min. The two-hourly service continues south along A7 beyond Hawick to Mosspaul, Langholm, Canonbie, Longtown and Carlisle, another 80 min. 
The "Waverley Railway" used to run through Hawick to join the main line at Carlisle but was axed in 1969. The northern part was restored in 2015, linking Edinburgh, Galashiels and Tweedbank; there are no plans to restore the southern part.

Get around[edit]

The town is small and walkable. A7 now runs west of the river, and the historic route along High Street has become a one-way north to south B-road. And A7 is no longer the main route to Edinburgh: from northwest England you follow A74(M) far to the west. This means that Hawick still has plenty of local traffic but no longer suffers from through-traffic.
Taxi operators include Dom's (+44 7807 800078), Teviot Taxis (+44 7743 443775) and A1 (+44 1450 374047).
