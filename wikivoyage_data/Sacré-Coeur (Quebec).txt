Understand[edit]
Geography[edit]
The municipality of Sacré-Coeur comprises the township of Albert which covers the forest territory along the north shore of the Saguenay River. The village of Sacré-Coeur sits in a valley between the mountains.
The municipality is crossed by route 172 which joins to the southeast route 138 in the territory of Tadoussac. More or less parallel to the course of the Saguenay River, the southern part of Route 172 runs through the upper valley of the Moulin à Baude river which drains the village of Sacré-Coeur and empties onto the sandstone on the north shore of the Saint Lawrence River. From the village of Sacré-Coeur, Route 172 heads north-west, first crossing an agricultural and forest plain, surrounded by mountains. Then, this road takes the lower valley of the Sainte-Marguerite Northeast river, then the valley of the Sainte-Marguerite river; then this road branches off towards Sainte-Rose-du-Nord and Saint-Fulgence, in the direction of the Chicoutimi Nord sector. The route of Route 172 offers bucolic panoramas of high mountains and valleys shaped by glaciers.
Route 138 crosses the eastern part of the municipality. This road runs along the north shore of the St. Lawrence River.
From the limit of the municipality of Tadoussac, the north shore of the Saguenay River has high, very steep cliffs and high mountains. This mountain panorama attracts many boaters who go up the course of the river by boat. Others admire this very rugged relief from the air. The main bays on the north coast of the Saguenay River in the Sacré-Coeur territory are: cove à la Barque, cove à Richard, cove à la Boule, cove à la Passe-Pierre, cove Creuse, cove à la Grosse Roche, cove in Pierrot, cove aux Mouches, Baie Sainte-Marguerite (where the Sainte-Marguerite river flows), Îlets Rouge cove, Gagnon cove (opposite Île St-Barthélemy). Each cove or bay has its history or its meaning. The main secondary access roads to the north coast are that of the Sainte-Marguerite river valley and that leading to Anse-à-Pierrot; this last road leads via the top of the cliff to Anse Creuse and to the top of a promontory facing Anse à la Passe-Pierre. Another secondary road leads to Cap de la Boule which delimits the western part of Anse à la Boule.
The Ronde mountain (summit at 183 m) and the Montagne Blanche (summit at 208 m) are the highest peaks in the municipal territory.

Economy[edit]
The main economic activities of the Sacré-Coeur territory are forestry and recreational tourism (vacation, boating, hunting, fishing, observation of flora, fauna and nature). Agriculture is practised in a limited way on plateaus around the village of Sacré-Coeur.
