Skibbereen is a village in the southwest of County Cork, Ireland. An Sciobairín means "the little boat harbour" - it would have to be a small boat to get this far up the River Ilen. Skibbereen was one of the worst affected places during the Famine of 1845-52, and it's reckoned that up to 10,000 victims are buried in the mass grave here, with a similar number fleeing to an unknown fate. The village is nowadays a small resort, with a population of 2900 in 2022.
The Tourist Office is in village centre, open W-F 10AM-2PM.

The Maid of Erin is the statue in village centre expressing heartfelt thanks that rebellions against the British were defeated, in 1798, 1803, 1848 and 1867. Surely it was only for lack of room for further dates that they didn't add 1916 for the Easter Rising.
 Uillinn West Cork Arts Centre, Skibbereen P81 VW98, ☏ +353 28 22090. M-Sa 10AM-4:30PM, closed on public holidays. Exhibitions of modern art, studio space and classes, in a boxy rust-coloured building that some hate. By donation. (updated Jun 2024)

51.552-9.2883 Abbeystrowry Cemetery (on N71, one km west of the village). The mass grave of some 8000-10,000 local famine victims. 
51.5-9.34 Lough Hyne (7 km southwest of the village). A seawater lake. It's almost completely closed off from the sea, so the tides rush in and out through rapids. It's a nature reserve and there's a kayaking centre. You can swim, though there isn't a beach. The islet in the middle has the overgrown remains of a castle. 
51.58-9.1435 Leap. A village on N71 midway between Clonakilty and Skibbereen. It has a few bars and eating places. North side of the main road is a ravine with a stream cascading into it: legend goes that a chieftain escaped the English by leaping across it, hence the village name. In 2013 the stream bank was decorated with models of fairies and their teensy-weensy dwellings, to emetic effect. The stream flows into Glandore Harbour - see Clonakilty for Glandore village and Drombeg Stone Circle on the east bank. 
51.558-9.1386 Union Hall. A small fishing village on the west bank of the Glandore inlet, with a couple of bars and that's about all. You get here by the east bank road from Leap towards Glandore, then cross Poulgorm Bridge. This is very narrow, but if you've driven this far into west Cork without scraping the car you're obviously equal to the challenge.
