History[edit]
The territory of La Tuque was first inhabited by Atikamekw Indigenous people. In the early 1850s, settlers were drawn to the area to exploit the forest resources. The La Tuque Post Office opened in 1887, but the area remained isolated from the rest of the Mauricie until the early 1900s when the National Transcontinental Railway was built, prompting industrial development and the growth of a community on the east bank of the Saint-Maurice River where there was a large set of falls.
In the 1940s, the hydro-electric generating station on the Saint-Maurice River was built, resulting in the partial destruction of the rock formation that gave the town its name.
Founded in 1911, the city occupies a site known to the French since 1651. In 2003, the city merged with the municipalities of La Bostonnais, La Croche, Lac-Édouard, the municipality of the village of Parent, as well as all the non-organized territories within the Haut-Saint-Maurice RCM. La Tuque therefore becomes the second largest municipality in Quebec for its area.
In May 2010, some 120 forest fires broke out around La Tuque, burning until June. Smoke from these fires reached portions of Eastern Ontario and southern Quebec, including the cities of Ottawa and Montreal, as well as the northern US states.
