Chester is a village of 2,300 people (2011) in Nova Scotia. Chester is a holiday and resort destination, with many seasonal and year-round estates and mansions. The nearby waters of Mahone Bay and its numerous islands are well known for yachting and have made the Chester Yacht Club into a cruising destination. 


Understand[edit]

History[edit]
The French had been present in Acadia since the early 1600s, but when the British expanded into the area in the 1700s, Acadian settlements on the South Shore where few and tiny. After the Expulsion of the Acadians, the British wanted to repopulate vacated lands, and offered land grants to colonists from New England, which was experiencing a population explosion. In 1761 New England Planters were granted lands in the Chester area, then called Shoreham.
During the American Revolution, Nova Scotia was invaded regularly by American Revolutionary forces and privateers, including the 1782 Raid on Chester. During this time some of the New England immigrants were not 
loyal in the conflict: village founders Timothy Houghton and John Seccombe  were charged with sedition, and military officer Jonathan Prescott was suspected of being an American sympathizer.
During the 1800s, Chester was an important site for coastal commerce, with economic activities including lumbering, shipbuilding, shipping, and fishing.
