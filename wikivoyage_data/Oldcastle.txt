Oldcastle is a town in County Meath in central Ireland, with a population in 2022 of 1400. The reason to visit is the collection of prehistoric tombs at Loughcrew Cairns, which are as fine as those at better-known Newgrange but even older, and without the tourist hordes.


Get in[edit]

See[edit]
Town centre is clustered around The Square. St Bride's is the Church of Ireland church west side of The Square; St Brigid's east on Church St is Roman Catholic, with a shrine to Saint Oliver Plunkett. There's nothing left of the Workhouse, which from 1916 to 1918 was a detention camp for German and Austrian POWs and interned civilians; the area is now a housing estate just south of town. Also there but not worth seeking out is the site of the castle, a Norman motte-and-bailey, now an overgrown mound.
53.746-7.1211 Loughcrew Cairns, Corstown A82 A6N7 (3 km east of town off R163). Jun-Aug: daily 10AM-5PM. The largest collection of megalithic graves in Ireland, with 30 passage tombs from around 3300 BC, older than Newgrange. They're ranged across four small hills together known as Slieve na Calliagh, "the witch's hills", and the hill you visit is Carnbane East (194 m). Its largest tomb is Cairn T, 35 m in diameter with Neolithic artwork: the sunrise at spring and autumn equinox penetrates its depths. Entry within is by guided tour. (In early 2021 this tomb is closed for conservation, others remain accessible.) "The Hag's Chair" nearby is a large carved kerbstone. The area is steep and rocky, wear stout shoes.  (updated Apr 2021)
Carnbane West (206 m) is 1 km away. Cairns D and L are both 60 m in diameter. They've been damaged so nowadays there's no public entry within.
Carrickbrack "the speckled hill" between Carnbane West and the lane has the grassy Cairn M, which hasn't been excavated.
Patrickstown Hill (276 m), the highest point in the county, is 3 km east of Carnbane East. The stones have been raided to use as masonry so the cairns are in poor condition and you mainly come for the view, along the path from R154.
53.734-7.1442 Loughcrew Estate, Loughcrew A82 X4Y1. Daily 11AM-5PM. Charming gardens with many original 17th century features. The house is now an event venue and can't routinely be visited. It's burnt down three times, with only outbuildings surviving, especially the Orangery. This has been converted into plush self-catering, sleeps 17. The Plunkett family backed the breakaway Irish Confederacy in the 1640s, so their lands were forfeited to the loyal Napers, who still own it. The Napers restored the gardens; they also staged an annual opera festival here but this is no longer held. Adult €7, child €3.50, conc €5. (updated Apr 2021)
Saint Oliver Plunkett’s Memorial Church is within Loughcrew Estate and open daily 10AM-5PM. Plunkett (1625-1681) was born at Loughcrew: there's an annual pilgrimage and mass here on 1 July, the date he was executed at Tyburn. See Drogheda for more of his life and works.
53.724-7.1773 Moylagh Castle is the ruin of a medieval turret, with a few fragments of a church nearby.
53.684-7.2774 Fore Abbey was the mother-house of Moylagh church. It's across the boundary in County Westmeath, see Mullingar.
