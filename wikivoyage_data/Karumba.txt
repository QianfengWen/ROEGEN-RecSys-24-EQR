Karumba is the only place where there is sealed road access to the Gulf of Carpentaria.  It is a prawning and fishing town, where you can watch the sun set over the gulf.
The settlement of Karumba was previously known as Norman Mouth and Kimberley.
The Gulf Savannah is an interesting region to visit all year; however, during the monsoon season, transportation methods must be carefully considered, as some parts of the Gulf Savannah region suffer from a lack of road infrastructure.
Karumba is situated on the mouth of the Norman River and is the centre of the Gulf's prawning industry. Surrounding environ is flat wetlands which extend inland for approximately 30 kilometres. Wetlands are a series of meandering saltwater tidal estuaries, habitat for saltwater crocodiles and vast array of bird species, such as pelicans, cyrus cranes, brolgas and black swans.
