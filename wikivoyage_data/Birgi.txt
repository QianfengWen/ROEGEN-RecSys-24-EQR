Birgi is an attractive village overlooking the Küçükmenderes Valley in the Central Aegean Region of Turkey, with a population of 1832 in 2022. Its name derives from Greek "Pyrgion" (Πυργίον, "little tower") and from the 13th to 15th century it was capital of the Aydınoğulları principality or petty kingdom, one of several formed in the power vacuum between the collapse of the Seljuks and the rise of the Ottomans. Birgi has been little developed since, so its street layout and monuments date back to that time.


Get in[edit]
38°15′14″N 28°3′54″EMap of Birgi
The local hub is Ödemiş, which has highway, bus and rail connections from Izmir the regional capital. Birgi is 9 km northeast of Ödemiş, a short drive or dolmuş ride.

Get around[edit]
Walking is the best plan, on the narrow cobbled streets shaded by mature pines amidst traditional buildings. 
The village is ranged on both sides of a creek, dry for much of the year but a torrent of cold cocoa after rains. There are only two bridges, at the top and bottom of the village.

See[edit]
38.256628.06721 Aydınoğlu Mehmet Bey Mosque (Ulu Cami / Grand Mosque), Uluselvi Sk. Built in 1312 in Seljuk style, this was the central mosque of the Aydınoğulları principality. The exterior is modest but striking features within are the wooden mimbar, the deep blue marble mihrab, and the lion statue a rarity in Islamic buildings.   (updated Dec 2023)
Tombs: Ümmü Sultan tomb is east side of the mosque. It was built in 1310 (710 AH) by Aydınoğlu Mehmet Bey for his sister Hanzade Hatun. His own tomb is south side of the mosque.
Umur Bey Statue stands by Ümmü Sultan tomb, drawing his sword. He was born in Birgi around 1310, the second son of Aydınoğlu Mehmet Bey, and succeeded his father as ruler. He greatly enlarged the principality by land and sea until beaten back by rival powers, and died trying to re-capture Izmir in 1348.
Kerim Ağa Konağı is a compulsory photo stop 100 m southeast of the mosque. It's a traditional Ottoman house with its upper storey projecting over the corner of İsabey Sk. In 2023 it's under restoration and scaffolding spoils the picture.

Go next[edit]
Ödemiş has an archaeology museum but otherwise little reason to linger.
Mt Bozdağ is the mountain looming to the north. Lake Gölcük is near the summit, with campsites and RV parks around it. The scenic road zigzags and hairpins up the mountain then descends even more steeply to the main road near Sart, ancient capital of the Lydians.
