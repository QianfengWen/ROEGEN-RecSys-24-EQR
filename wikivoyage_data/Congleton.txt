Congleton Town Hall

Understand[edit]
The town's tree planting as part of the Trees for Congleton project was entered in the ‘Green Solutions’ category of the digital national RHS Community Awards, being awarded 'Highly Commended'.
Congleton is in the valley of the River Dane. To the south of the town lies an expanse of green space known locally as Priesty Fields which forms a green corridor into the heart of the town, a rare feature in English towns. Legend says that Priesty Fields gained its name as there was no priest performing services within the town. The nearest priest was based at the nearby village Astbury. It is told that the priest would walk along an ancient medieval pathway which ran between the fields at the Parish Church in Astbury and St Peter's Church in Congleton.

History[edit]
The town's name is of unknown origin. The first recorded reference to it was in 1086 in the Domesday Book, where it is listed as Cogeltone: Bigot de Loges. In 1282 it was spelt Congelton. The element Congle might relate to the old Norse kang meaning a bend, followed by the Old English element tun meaning settlement.
Congleton became notorious in the 1620s when bear-baiting and cockfighting were popular sports. When the old bear became ill and died just before the Wakes, the town lacked the money to pay for a new, more aggressive bear. The town used money it had saved to buy a new bible and it replenished the fund with the income from the increased number of spectators. It became legend that Congleton sold its Bible to pay for a new bear, which earned Congleton the nickname 'Beartown'. The chorus of 20th-century folk song "Congleton Bear", by folk artist John Tams, runs:

 Congleton Rare, Congleton Rare
Sold the Bible to buy a bear.
The principal industries in Congleton include the manufacture of airbags and golf balls. There are light engineering factories near the town, and sand extraction occurs on the Cheshire Plain. One of the most prominent industries during the nineteenth century onwards was Berisfords Ribbons, established in 1858. It was founded by Charles Berisford and his brothers Francis and William. The brothers leased part of Victoria Mill, on Foundry Bank, owning the entire factory by 1872. By 1898, the company had offices in London, Manchester, Leeds and Bristol.

Congleton is 7 mi (11 km) east of the M6 motorway, connected by the A534. It is on the A34 trunk road between Stoke-on-Trent and Manchester, and the A54 to Buxton and the Peak District. The A536 links the town with Macclesfield, with the A527 linking the town to Biddulph and providing an alternative route to Stoke-on-Trent.

By rail[edit]
53.15785-2.192581 Congleton Railway Station was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway on 9 October 1848 and is a 15-minute walk from the town centre. The line is part of the Stoke-on-Trent-Manchester Line of the West Coast Main Line, terminating in Manchester to the north and London Euston to the south. However only stopping services between Manchester and Stoke-on-Trent stop here. Its regular rail links make Congleton popular as a commuter belt town for Manchester and surrounding larger towns. 

By boat[edit]
The Macclesfield Canal, completed in 1831, passes through the town. It runs 26 mi (42 km) from Marple Junction at Marple, where it joins the Upper Peak Forest Canal, southwards (through Bollington and Macclesfield), before arriving at Bosley. Having descended the 12 Bosley Locks over the course of about 1 mi (1.6 km), the canal continues through Congleton to a junction with the Hall Green Branch of the Trent & Mersey Canal at Hall Green. The canal is renowned for its elegant roving bridges.

By plane[edit]
The nearest airport to the town is Manchester Airport, 20 miles (32 km) away.

Get around[edit]
Congleton is a relatively small and compact town so most attractions and amenities are within walking distance. The town centre is easily traversable by foot. Buses to suburbs and nearby towns depart from the bus station on Market Street.
Few places in Congleton are completely flat and some parts are rather steep, but every so often you’ll see a view of the hills that makes it all worth while.

The Pearl of the Dane, also known as "The Congleton Steamboat", is a 60-foot steamboat moored and rotting at a specially designed quay near the riverside mill on the River Dane. The boat was a fishing trawler known as Limanda, built in Denmark in 1974, that took part in the Icelandic cod wars from its home port of Grimsby until it was decommissioned in 1994. It was found in a Holyhead boatyard by Cheshire businessman Joe Terry who bought it and had it transported to Congleton with the intention of transforming it into a seafood restaurant. The venture was not a success because of its location, menu and public opinion of Joe Terry, and while changing hands several times the boat has quietly continued to decay.

If you haven't come from there, Manchester, England's second largest city, is a short distance to the north. Perceived by those who've not visited as a dismal post-industrial wasteland, whereas the reasons to visit—clubs, restaurants, shopping, museums—are too numerous for even a short list here to do the place justice.
Off to the east is the Peak District. After taking in the splendid scenery and trekking to your heart's content, either camping out overnight or staying in Buxton, you might want to continue on to Sheffield, another post-industrial Northern city with more to offer than that description suggests.
West of Congleton one eventually gets to Chester, with its quaint medieval architecture and walls. It's an excellent stopover for travellers heading into Wales, a short distance away.
Almost as close to Congleton to the south as Manchester is to the north is Stoke-on-Trent. Once home to a thriving pottery industry it is now a destination with museums and gardens and a thick streak of local pride.
Smaller towns in the area include Macclesfield, Leek, Wilmslow and Knutsford.
