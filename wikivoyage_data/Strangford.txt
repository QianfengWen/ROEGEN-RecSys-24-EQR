Strangford is a village historically in County Down in Northern Ireland, but now part of the Newry, Mourne and Down District. It's on the west bank of the narrow outlet of Strangford Lough, where the tides rip back and forth, hence to the Vikings it was Strangr-fjǫrðr, the strong fjord. Its population (as of 2001) was only 424 yet it has a sumptuous mansion house and a scattering of medieval turrets.
