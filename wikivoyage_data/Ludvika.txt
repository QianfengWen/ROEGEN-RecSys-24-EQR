Gorgeous autumn colours in Säfsen

Understand[edit]
During the 16th century the forest around Dalarna were still unoccupied. Immigrants from northern Finland began to occupy the woods. They survived on hunting, fishing and farming.
In the 1720s, ironworks were established in the villages of Strömsdal, Fredriksberg/Annefors, Ulriksberg and Tyfors. Sebastian Grave came to the district to establish his ironworks. He started the works in Gravendal. In 1830 it became the biggest iron producer together with the other works in Dalarna.
Most of the cottages were built in the 18th century and when the ironworks in the beginning of the 1900s turned into a wood industry. The coal and iron crofter became drivers and woodcutters.
A railway was built during the later part of 19th century to make it easier for the transportation of the iron and later the paperworks. Beginning in the 1940s many of the cottages were demolished or modernised. But some of them were renovated after an old style and can still be visited.
The iron works had finished and instead a paper industry was built in Fredriksberg that became the dominant employer in the parish till 1972. In 1898 a sulphite factory was built in Fredriksberg. Nearby, a sulphate factory started and in 1932 later the paper factory started.
During 1940s and 1950s the town of Fredriksberg blossomed, but eventually they shut down.  The first ski-lift came in 1979 and was the start on the big venture on tourism and conference activity in the region. Säfsen Resort is now the principal reason for visiting the area. Säfsen, in eastern Fredriksberg, is dominated by Säfsen Resort AB, which operates the ski resort and is The major employer in the area, so much so that the whole Fredriksberg area is sometimes referred to as Säfsen.
