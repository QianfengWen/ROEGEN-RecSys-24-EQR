Limerick (Luimneach) is a city in County Limerick in the Shannon Region of Ireland, with a population in 2024 of 60,314. It's a miniature Dublin with its Georgian streets, historic sights, and many visitor amenities, and is a good base for visiting its surrounding county plus County Clare and County Tipperary.


Understand[edit]
The Treaty Stone near Thomond Bridge
Limerick grew up at the limit of tides and navigation of the River Shannon. In the 9th century the Vikings first raided it then settled, calling it Hlymrekr which probably means low-lying and fertile. As elsewhere in Ireland, they were overthrown by the native Irish in the 10th and 11th centuries, who in turn came under the rule of the Anglo-Normans. In 1205 King John ordered the construction of the castle on the river island in the Shannon, and the English settled in this area of King's Island, with their "Englishtown" protected by massive walls. South across the small River Abbey lay "Irishtown", with the natives firmly put in their place. 
Limerick became a prosperous port, so it was worth fighting for. Some of the many conflicts were the proxy war that was part of the medieval England—Scotland wars; a siege as Oliver Cromwell crushed Royalist opposition in Ireland; and the siege which was the last stand of King James II/VII forces against William of Orange, ended by the Treaty of Limerick in 1691. Supposedly this was signed over the "Treaty Stone", which now stands near Thomond Bridge. 
The city benefited from local agriculture and by growing trade with North America, with Irishtown rebuilt on a grid pattern as a Georgian city comparable to Dublin, and fine public buildings. It slumped with the Napoleonic wars, with the draining of political power to England, and with the great Irish famine of 1847. Not until mid-20th century did it redevelop, as transatlantic flights began from Shannon and new industry was attracted in to replace bygone trades.
It's spawned many great writers and poets: Michael Hogan (1828-1899) the satirical Bard of Thomond, Jim Kemmy (1936-1997) author of The Limerick Anthology, Frank McCourt (1930-2009) author of Angela's Ashes, 'Tis and Teacher Man. Other famous local people include the actor Richard Harris, TV presenter Terry Wogan, statesmen Éamon de Valera and Michael D Higgins, and physician William Brooke O'Shaughnessy who pioneered IV therapy and the medical use of cannabis. What the place didn't spawn was limerick verse, which evolved in 18th-century England, presumably from a nonsense lyric that referred to the city or county.
This is Limerick is the tourist office, within the castle.

The Treaty permitted the defeated Jacobite soldiers to leave for France (which most did), or to enlist in William's army, or to go home. It also ensured protection of the defeated Catholic gentry provided they swore allegiance to King William. But few did so, the Pope proclaimed James as the rightful king, the Catholics were oppressed, and the conflict rumbled on for the next 300 years.

Go next[edit]
Drive west past Shannon Airport into County Clare and Ennis and take N68 to Kilrush and Kilkee. This brings you onto the wild Mizzen Head, with the grey Atlantic heaving below.
On the road north towards Galway, stop to admire the  Cliffs of Moher.
Lough Gur, 15 km south of the city along R512, is a remarkable collection of Neolithic sites and artefacts.
Along the south bank of Shannon, Adare is an attractive old town, pity about the traffic and the hordes.
Nearby Foynes is where the transatlantic flying boats used to berth, and the likes of Sinatra and John Wayne stepped out to the pop of flash-guns; see the museum and step aboard a plane.
