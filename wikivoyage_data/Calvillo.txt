Eat[edit]
Guavas are Calvillo's best-known produce
Known for its guavas, it's only natural to find the local fruit worked in to many deserts, confections, and beverages. An agua fresca is commonly available at local taquerias and the fruit is even used to make liquers. They can also be eaten fresh, typically with a shaker of chili and dry lime (Tajin). Calvillo is also famous for its delicious homemade ice creams and for round pastries called chamucos that are made using two types of dough: first a sugary cookie-like center and then an outer ring like shortbread.
