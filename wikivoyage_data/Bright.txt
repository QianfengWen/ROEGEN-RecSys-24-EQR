Map of Bright

Bright is at the end of a decommissioned railway spur from Wangaratta.  V/Line buses still service the town, three times daily on weekdays, but once a day on weekends.  The buses connect with railway services at Seymour to Melbourne.
The old rail right-of-way is now a railtrail, and hiring a bike from Wangaratta and cycling to Bright is a good days cycle.
There are other bus services to Omeo, by Omeo Bus. [1]
