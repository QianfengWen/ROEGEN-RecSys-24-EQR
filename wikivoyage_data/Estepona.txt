Estepona is a seaside resort city of 67,000 people (2018) on the Costa del Sol in Spain. Remnants from prehistory have been excavated in Estepona. The Romans, Phoenicians and Moors left their mark on the city.


Understand[edit]
Estepona lies on the Mediterranean Sea with the Sierra Bermeja mountains over 1000 m high in the background. The beaches are 21 km long.
Estepona is one of the few coastal towns that has succeeded in maintaining its pueblo charm and character, despite the onslaught of tourism. Notwithstanding, all the tourist facilities are here, including hotels, restaurants, leisure and cultural activities, and shops.
The flip side is that the numerous street cafes and tapas bars still serve traditional Spanish delicacies and the steep, cobbled, narrow streets seem more suited to horses than cars. You'll also find unusual shops and bodegas in Estepona, where you'd least expect them, all very inviting, very friendly - and very cheap!
In addition to the old town of Estepona, a lot of urbanizations for vacationers were built in the fifteen years before the real estate bubble burst. Between the old town and the city limits of Marbella, the “New Golden Mile” was created along the Mediterranean Sea in competition with the “Golden Mile” of Marbella. The New Golden Mile includes the districts of Rio Padron, Villacana, Cancelada, El Saladillo, Benamara, Isdabe-Atalaya, El Paraiso. West of the old town towards Algeciras, the districts of Bahia Azul, Valle Romano and Buenas Noches emerged. Overall, the city now offers space for more than 100,000 residents.

You can drive 120 km/h. The A 7, the former N-340, can be used free of charge. In the summer months there are traffic jams caused by accidents on the A 7 almost every day.
