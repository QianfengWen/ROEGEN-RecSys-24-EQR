By train[edit]
Copper Canyon
The Chihuahua al Pacifico Railway[dead link] is one of the world's most spectacular train trips. The trip between Los Mochis and Creel is about 9 hours each way. Trains leave each end point at 8am, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from Los Mochis and on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays from Creel.
The real scenery starts at El Fuerte. Stand on the western side and travel uphill to Creel. Hang out in the few open vestibules with your camera -- the uphill scenery is fairly splendid for at least two of the seven or nine or twelve hours of the journey. On the downhill run, put yourself in the club (bar) car, where you can stretch out in a modicum of comfort.

By bus[edit]
The city does not have a central bus station for the entire bus fleet, rather each line has its own terminal. There are local, regional, national and international transport routes. Bus lines that have national routes have departures to the north, center and south of the country. Bus lines with international routes have departures to the southwestern United States.

By boat[edit]
Ferry boats run between La Paz and the Topolobampo docks. The ferry transports both passengers and vehicles, though there has been talk of restricting RVs. Sleeping cabins are available at extra cost. Fares are about US$80 (salon class). A taxi from Topolobampo to Los Mochis takes about 30 minutes.

Get around[edit]
Taxis are the best way to get around. They are plentiful and economical. You could also rent a car, though driving in Sinaloa can be dangerous.
