Trowbridge is the county town of Wiltshire in the West Country of England.


Understand[edit]
Modern-day Trowbridge is a rather uninspiring mid-sized English town, but one with a surprisingly rich history.
The Kennett and Avon canal runs to the north of Trowbridge and played a large part in the development of the town as it allowed coal to be transported from the Somerset Coalfield. The town was an also a major British centre in the textile industry in south west England in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and was even described in 1820 as "The Manchester of the West".  The textile industry is now mostly all long gone, but evidence remains by way of buildings and a decent little local museum.

The town has few restaurants. The Assam Indian restaurant is good value and is bring-your-own.
The smart cafe La Dolce Vita manages to be sophisticated and homely too, good for families with well behaved children (and adults!).
