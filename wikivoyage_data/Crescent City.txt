Crescent City is a coastal city in Del Norte County in the northwestern corner of California.


Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
From San Francisco or Portland, US Highway 101 makes a scenic but sometimes slow drive along the coast to Crescent City.  Between San Francisco and Crescent City, there are only a few connector roads from the east (Hwy 20, Hwy 299) so if you want to drive along the coast, you can access Hwy 101  near San Francisco and follow it north.
From Grants Pass in Oregon, you can take US Highway 199 southwest to reach Crescent City.  
Grants Pass is also a stop along Interstate 5, which is the major north-south highway on the west coast.  Interstate 5 is known as fast and easy to drive and has good connections to further east, but it's often a boring road.  

 In you are traveling on Interstate 5 and want to travel over to the coast, you can take Hwy 299 west where it intersects I-5 at Redding, Ca.

Hwy 299 west is a beautiful, highly  scenic, curvy/winding route through the rugged mountains of Northern California. This route takes from Redding, through Weaverville and Willow Creek, along the Trinity and Klamath Rivers enroute to its juntion with Hwy 101 at Arcata, CA. 
Depending on your speed and stops along the way, Hwy 299 will take you approximately two and a half to three hours driving time to reach the coast. 
(If you take I-5 north to the Hwy 199 cutoff at Grants Pass, Oregon, and head over to the coast, you are looking at a Five plus hour trip.)
As a word of caution, Hwy 299 is not advisable during winter months due to Ice, snow and ppssibly slides that can cause  long delays and/or road closures.
If you are not prone to motion sickness and enjoy scenic, country roads (mostly two lanes) you might want to give Hwy 299 a try.

Stay safe[edit]
Crescent City is sometimes remembered as the only place in the 48 contiguous American states to have suffered loss of life from a tsunami in recorded history.  Its location is particularly vulnerable to such waves.  An extensive warning system has been installed to ensure the safety of residents and visitors alike and it works well.  When an offshore quake in 2005 triggered the tsunami alert system as a precaution, the city was evacuated in 20 minutes.  However, make sure to keep this concern in perspective; even in Crescent City, many more people die in auto accidents than by tsunamis.
