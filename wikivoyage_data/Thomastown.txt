Thomastown (Irish: Baile Mhic Andáin) is a town in County Kilkenny, with a population of 2445 in 2016. It was originally called Grennan and grew up at a crossing point on the River Nore, 17 km from Kilkenny. It was re-named for Thomas Fitzanthony, who built the castle and town walls in the 13th century; only a few scraps of those survive, but Jerpoint Abbey 3 km southwest is a substantial ruin. Other attractions are Kilfane Glen gardens and Mount Juliet Golf Course.

See[edit]
Grennan Castle
Town centre follows the pattern of its medieval walls, with a clockwise one-way street system. The only remnant of those defences is by the river bridge. Thomastown Church on Pipe St stands by the ruins of the 13th century church of St Mary.

52.5209-7.12712 Grennan Castle is a picturesque ruin by the river. It was built in the 13th century by Thomas FitzAnthony; he gave the name Thomastown to the village formerly called Grennan but this area south of the river retained the earlier name. The castle was abandoned after a siege by Cromwell but left intact, until the 1800s when it was raided for building masonry. Cattle wander in and out to admire the architecture, mind where you tread.
Thomple Church by the castle is the overgrown ruin of a Norman church and graveyard, part of the Priory of Inistioge.

St Nicholas' Church just west of the abbey is now the only remnant of the medieval village of Newton Jerpoint.

52.502-7.1226 Dysart Castle is a dilapidated medieval turret some 3 km south of town; it was part of the Priory of Kells (see Kilkenny}. Or is it? - according to its most famous resident it may not exist at all if nobody is looking at it. Bishop George Berkeley (1685-1753) argued that what we can't or don't experience doesn't exist, unless it's encompassed by the mind of God. He's spoofed as The Red King in Through the Looking Glass: if the king wakes from his dream, Alice and everything else will disappear. He gives his name to Berkeley, California.

Swiss Cottage was a similar folly but the ruins have been reclaimed by the jungle.
