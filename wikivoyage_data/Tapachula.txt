Tapachula de Córdova y Ordóñez or simply Tapachula is a city of 320,000 people (2010) in Chiapas. Tapachula is Mexico's main border city with Guatemala on the Pacific coast area although it is some kilometers away from the border. 


Understand[edit]
City's Old City Hall building in the main plaza
It is one of the most important cities of Chiapas economically as the capital of the agriculturally rich Soconusco region, and a port for trade between Mexico and Central America. 

History[edit]
The first human settlements of the peoples that later developed into the Mayan civilization have been found on the northern Pacific coast of what is now Guatemala.  However, southern Chiapas state in Mexico and Guatemala were a unified region prior to colonization.
One archaeological site of note, Izapa, is 10 km from Tapachula.  In addition, the Museo Archaeologico del Soconusco is located in the center of Tapachula in the same building that houses the tourist information center and the Casa de Cultura.

Climate[edit]
The climate of the city area is hot and humid most of the year. The area is one of the rainiest in the world with annual rainfall in the mountains of about 3,900 millimetres (150 inches).

Get around[edit]
See[edit]
Most of the city's monumental structures in the historic center were built in the first decades of the 20th century, although there are large homes near this same area built in the 1960s in Art Deco style, such as the La Portaviandas building. Outside the city downtown, the structures just about all date from the latter 20th century on due to recent growth.
The historic center is marked by a large, tree-lined plaza called Parque Miguel Hidalgo. The center of this plaza contains an octagon kiosk with Baroque ironwork with some Moorish influence. Parque Miguel Hidalgo is the center of the city. It surrounded by the old and new municipal palaces, the Perez Porta and the Teatro al Aire Libre (Open Air Theater), which often has marimba concerts.
The San Agustín parish church dates from the 18th century, established to honor the patron saint of the city, Augustine. It is a simple construction with a red Spanish tile roof, supported by wood beams. The facade is a simple Neoclassical with six Ionic order columns, three on each side of the entrance, joined by false arches. The top of the facade has two bell towers. This design is based on the Teopisca church. The church became a cathedral in 1958, shortly after the Tapachula diocese was established but that status has since been ceded to the San José Cathedral, consecrated in 2009.
The Casa de Cultura was built in 1929 as the municipal palace when the city was prosperous because of the surrounding coffee plantations. Although the style is Art Deco, the facade is decorated with Oaxacan style fretwork, images of Aztec warriors and stylized serpents along with the Mexican and state coats of arms. Today, the building functions as a cultural center for the city.
14.9101-92.265441 Museo Arqueológico del Soconusco, 8a Av Nte #24, Zona Centro (housed in the old city hall (antiguo palacio municipal) building next to the Parque Central de Miguel Hidalgo in downtown.), ☏ +52 962 626-4173. Tu-Su 09:00-18:00. A small museum that has a collection of Mayan & Olmec artifacts from the region. This building houses a number of pieces from the various archeological sites of the region, especially Izapa and several coastal sites. One special piece is a skull covered in gold and incrusted with turquoise. Another is a stele called Number 25, because of the quality of its engravings. (updated Aug 2020)
14.923406-92.1798222 Zona Arqueologica de Izapa, Km 304 La Ruta de la Costa y Soconusco (Carretera 200) (10 km NE of town on Ruta de la Costa y Soconusco (Carretera 200).), ☏ +52 961 612-83-60. Tu-Su 09:00-17:00. The settlement at Izapa extended over 2 km, making it the largest site in Chiapas. The site reached its apogee between 850 BC and 100 BC; several archaeologists have theorized that Izapa may have been settled as early as 1500 BC, making it as old as the Olmec sites of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán and La Venta. M$85.   (updated May 2024)
The municipal cemetery is notable as a testament to the immigrant past of the area, with gravestones with German names and Chinese characters. The best examples of both date from the late 19th to early 20th century.
Head out of town a little to Calle Miguel Hidalgo (the one out near Calle Semanarista) and check out the crocodile zoo. A quirky little backyard business that houses something like 50 crocodiles and alligators of various species and sizes. the family that runs it is friendly and as much as seeing the crocs themselves it's funny to watch small children chase an even smaller puppy around a backyard literally packed with ferocious reptiles in various cement and chainlink enclosures. Cost is M$25 per person, and a taxi should cost about M$25 each way.
Do[edit]
