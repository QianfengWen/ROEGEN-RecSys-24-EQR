Redland City (colloquially called The Redlands) is the southeasternmost of all localities in the Greater Brisbane with a population of 156,863 (2018). It's the least visited of all the five LGAs of Greater Brisbane, and also perhaps the "most forgotten" of them all. The Redlands do not have many tourist facilities, and the only major tourist draw is North Stradbroke Island.

By train[edit]
The primary station in Redland City is -27.5242153.26621 Cleveland railway station  which has only one line; the Cleveland railway line going to the suburbs of Bowen Hills, Northgate, Doomben, Central and Shorncliffe.

By car[edit]
Redland City is the only city in Greater Brisbane to have no motorways, but rather just an urban road from Brisbane CBD. From the CBD, it's approximately 30 km (19 mi), taking a bit more than half an hour when there is no traffic. 
From BNE CBD, enter onto the M3 Pacific Motorway but try and keep to the leftmost lane as possible as you will need to exit onto Exit 2 to Vulture Street (Route 41), which is less than a few hundred metres from the entry ramp. Once you are on State Route 41, continue on SR 41 until Old Cleveland Road (SR 22). Turn left east onto Old Cleveland Road, and continue on State Route 22 until the end of the route to Cleveland.
From BNE Airport, head south on the tolled M1 Gateway Motorway and take Exit 87 onto State Route 22 Old Cleveland Road. Turn left at the intersection and continue until the end of the route to Cleveland.

-27.583333153.4666671 North Stradbroke Island. The world's second largest sand island, after K'gari, a couple hundred kilometeres north.

-27.510172153.2890783 Cleveland Point Light (Point Cleveland Light, Old Cleveland Lighthouse), 238 Shore St N, Cleveland.
