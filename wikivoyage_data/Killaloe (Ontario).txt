History[edit]
Brennans Creek
The name Killaloe (pronounced "KILL-a-LOO") hails from an Irish community in Ireland of the same name and salutes the Irish heritage of many of the first settlers to this area who came to Canada in the early 19th century seeking a better life. The origin of this little town centred on the lumber trade. Built in 1849, and rebuilt in 1870 after a devastating fire, the mill at Old Killaloe harnessed waterpower to grind grain for area residents up to 1930, and planed lumber until the 1960s. In those days it was known as Fort McDonnell, but it became known as Killaloe Station circa 1868 when the Ottawa, Arnprior, Parry Sound Railway was expanding at a furious pace through the rugged countryside of the Madawaska Valley in response to the demands of the lumber industry.
In 1854 the construction of the Opeongo Line brought settlers and the logging industry to this area which had been occupied by the Algonquins. The Algonquin First Nation in the area still continue an ongoing land claim which covers the entire region. A majority of the settlers were French Canadians and Irish Catholic immigrants but among them were Poles, Kashubians and Germans as well.
With the railway construction essentially finished, and the forestry industry declining many of the people took to farming. Unfortunately the soil was poor. Rocky land and short growing seasons meant that many farms failed. The population went into a steady decline which has only leveled off in the past few decades.
The lumber industry is still important to the livelihood of many in the surrounding communities. Large and small logging operations and sawmills still support the local economy even though the railway no longer runs through the village. Killaloe maintains a flavour of the turn of the century in many of the commercial buildings which are more than 100 years old.
In May 2014, the founders of BeaverTails Grant and Pam Hooker officially named Killaloe as the birthplace of the BeaverTails. This popular Canadian snack has named one of its signature versions after this town.

See and do[edit]

45.67-77.692 Bonnechere River Provincial Park. A waterway park that follows the Bonnechere River from the Algonquin Park boundary to the Round Lake. The park is about 23 km (14 mi) in length, and includes a small amount of land along the river banks in most areas. The river's banks are easily accessed from roads and trails along both sides. Canoeing (with some short portages), hiking, swimming, and fishing are permitted. A small number of crown (public) lands permit back country camping. There are no fees or reservations, but it is wise to stop at the Bonnechere Provincial Park office for a detailed map of the waterway that shows access points and locations of legal (and suitable) campsites. The waterway is wilderness; despite being so close to a developed park, there are no staff or facilities inside the park. Be prepared to practice leave-no-trace camping.   (updated Mar 2023)
