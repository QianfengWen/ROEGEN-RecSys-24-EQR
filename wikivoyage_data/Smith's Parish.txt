Smith's Parish is one of the nine parishes of Bermuda. It is in the northeast of the main island, at the southern end of Harrington Sound, the large lagoon close to the main island's northeastern tip. It is joined to Devonshire Parish in the southwest and Hamilton Parish in the northeast.  It had a population of almost 6,000 people in 2016.


Understand[edit]

Natural features in Smith's include Spittal Pond, John Smith's Beach, Devil's Hole, Gibbet Island, and Spanish Rock.
Like all of parishes of Bermuda, Smith's was named after one of the nine chief investors of the Somers Isles (Bermuda) Company. In this case, it was named for the Company's first governor, Sir Thomas Smith, who also acted as a governor for the East India Company and treasurer of the Virginia Company. Smith invested £60,000 into Bermuda (only £20,000 less than what he invested in the much larger Virginia). Despite this, his contribution to his stake in the colony was minimal, and the area was briefly known as "Harris' Bay".
