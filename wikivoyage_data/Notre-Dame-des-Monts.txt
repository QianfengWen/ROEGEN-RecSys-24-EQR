Notre-Dame-des-Monts is a municipality in the Quebec Region, on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River, in Quebec.
The economy of this locality in the hinterland of Charlevoix is centred on forestry, agriculture and recreational tourism activities (hiking, vacationing, snowmobiling, and all terrains vehicles). Visitors want to know the legend of La Noyée and admire the mountain setting formed by the rim of the crater of the Astroblème de Charlevoix.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Mountain setting
Going up the valley of the Rivière du Gouffre, from the limit of Saint-Urbain and Baie-Saint-Paul, the panorama of a mountain setting hugs the northern edge of the famous crater of the Astroblème de Charlevoix. A bucolic road trip from Baie Saint-Urbain is to take successively (heading east):

Rang Saint-Jean-Baptiste (first in Saint-Urbain, then in Notre-Dame-des-Monts) along the foot of the cliff and the course of the Gouffre river;
Rang St-Antoine, the 7th & 8th row road, the Chicago row, the Ste-Philomène row, and the 5th & 6th row road, to the village of Notre-Dame-des-Monts.
Clockwise (from the village of Saint-Urbain), the mountain range forming an arc of a circle, i.e. the northern fringe of the gigantic crater, is formed successively by the Mont des Ilets, the Mont Blanc du Grand Lac, the Mont Gros Ruisseau, Mont du Lac à Moïse, Mont du Lac des Cygnes, Mont du Lac à L'Empêche, Mont du Four (at the border of the lands of the Séminaire and the zec des Martres) and the mountain of la Noyée, to the course of the Malbaie river.
In the village of Notre-Dame-des-Monts, in the hinterland, the view of this mountain setting is superb; at the top of the mountain at Joseph-à-Johnny (located southeast of the village), the panorama is even more splendid. This mountain setting has inspired many painters who have immortalized it as a backdrop.

Drowned woman legend
The legend of the drowned woman is transmitted in the history of Saint-Aimé-des-Lacs and Notre-Dame-des-Monts. This legend, which originates from the depths of the Amerindian ages, refers to the La Noyée mountain whose summit (at 883 m) is located 215 m north of the boundary of the townships of Lacoste and De Sales. This summit is 1.75 km southwest of Lac du Tonnerre, in the canton of Lacoste in the unorganized territory of Mont-Élie, of the MRC of Charlevoix-Est; about 7 km south of the Hautes-Gorges-de-la-Rivière-Malbaie National Park; and 13.1 km north of the center of the village of Notre-Dame-des-Monts. The south cliff of this mountain displays a vertical drop of 571 m (between the summit and the level of the lake of the chalet); the latter flows into Lac du Pied des Monts and the stream of the same name which becomes a tributary of the Malbaie River.
The mountainous relief of the southern part of Lacoste Township suggests the profile of a pregnant woman lying on her back, half-submerged, face and hair in the water. This mountain of La Noyée would represent the maternal womb according to legend. She would be associated with two other mountains (representing the mother's breasts) on the east side, which would presumably be:

a 698 m peak on the east side of Lac du Tonnerre;
a 501m peak on the east side of the Lac du Tonnerre outlet.
In addition, at this height, a peninsula in the course of the Malbaie River stretches 2.3 km (1.4 mi) to the east, forcing the current to bypass the head of the drowned woman according to legend. In short, in this position, the drowned woman would have her head to the east with her hair touching the Malbaie River; and the legs to the west, touching the Gouffre river. Curiously, the shortest distance between the course of the du Gouffre river and the Malbaie river, that is 8.8 km (5.5 mi), is obtained by drawing a straight line connecting the two rivers, at the foot of these mountains which is the rim of this ancient crater.
Her saddened lover, symbolized by another mountain, would keep watch on the other side of the Gouffre River. Locals and authors romanticize this local legend each in their own way.

Geography[edit]
The dwellings are mainly concentrated on the eastern part near Lake Nairne of Saint-Aimé-des-Lacs, where the village is located. The northern part of the municipality, north of the Lac au Brochet outlet, is mostly wooded. Thus, the territory of Notre-Dame-des-Monts is conducive to recreational tourism activities related to forestry.

Geology[edit]
The centre of the village of Notre-Dame-des-Monts is 16 km (9.9 mi) from the north side of the summit of Mont Les Éboulements. The entire municipal territory is located in the heart of the crater of the Astroblème of Charlevoix.
Nearly 400 million years ago, the fall of a meteorite significantly modified the relief of Charlevoix, creating a crater 54 km in diameter; it is the eleventh largest identified impact site on earth. The impact zone would be located along the St. Lawrence River; 60% of the astroblème covers the north shore of the river and 40% is under the water of the river. The astrobleme begins on the southwest side a few kilometers west of Baie-Saint-Paul, up to Cap-à-l'Aigle, located on the east bank of the Malbaie River, in La Malbaie. The centre of the astrobleme would be the Mont des Éboulements (summit at 768 m), formed by the effect of the raising of the bottom of the crater following the impact. Since this impact, the crater has been strongly metamorphosed under the effect of various erosion agents, making it more difficult to recognize its outline, particularly the part immersed in the St. Lawrence River. Consequently, experts define this ancient impact structure as the astrobleme. Inaugurated in 2014, an interpretation centre dedicated to the Charlevoix astrobleme is open to the public; it is housed in the former Club House of the Manoir Richelieu in La Malbaie.
