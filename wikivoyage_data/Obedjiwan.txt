Geography[edit]
Enclosed in the agglomeration of La Tuque, this reserve is the most isolated of the Attikamek reserves in Quebec.
This 9.27 km2 (3.58 sq mi) reserve is located on a peninsula attached to the north shore of Gouin reservoir, extending southward between the lake Kamitcikamak (to the west) and Wapisiw Bay (to the east). Apart from the outfitters, this native village is the only community to live on the edge of the Gouin reservoir.
The highest mountain peak in the reserve is 532 m (1,745 ft); it is located in the center of the peninsula, ie 3.5 km (2.2 mi) from the centre of Obedjiwan village. Three other vertices amount to 520 m (1,710 ft), 510 m (1,670 ft) and 490 m (1,610 ft). The access road from the north passes on the east side of this mountain, along the coast of the Gouin reservoir.
The many bays and islands around the village are refuges for sailors in the event of high winds on the Gouin reservoir. In summer, because of the intensive activity of outfitters, boating and seaplanes are popular on the Gouin reservoir.
The main road exit from the village of Obedjiwan is the forest road RO212 leading to the northeast in order to bypass the Gouin reservoir, either passing near Lake Mathieu, Baie Natcickweciw, Lac du Principal, Lac Dubois and the Obatogamau lake, to join route 167 (connecting Chibougamau to Saint-Félicien). Option B is to bypass the Gouin reservoir from the west, either by road R2046, in order to go south to the village of Saint-Michel-des-Saint].
The locality of Seskatciwan is located off reserve at the mouth of the Toussaint river (on the east bank), that is to 6.1 km (3.8 mi) north of the center from the village of Obedjiwan.
The outfitter Ganipi 2006 inc. turns out to be closest to the village of Obedjiwan; it 13.4 km (8.3 mi) further south, on the edge of Ganipi bay which is part of a large peninsula attached to the south shore of Gouin reservoir.

History[edit]
During its history, the spelling of the toponym has changed several times depending on the sources or the authors. The name atikamekw "Opitciwon" means "the river that rises the current of the strait". Opitciwan is the name of Obedjiwan in the standardized Atikamekw spelling. The spelling "Obedjiwan" was formalized in 1968 by the Commission de toponymie du Québec.
The Hudson's Bay Company established a trading post there in 1825; it was an outpost of Mégiscane, established further north-west and Kikendatch, located further downstream on the Saint-Maurice.
At the end of the construction in 1948 of the Gouin dam, the impoundment of the reservoir engulfed the old village of the community of Obedjiwan, located 130 km northwest of the dam. Thus, the village of Objedjiwan has been relocated to the current site.
