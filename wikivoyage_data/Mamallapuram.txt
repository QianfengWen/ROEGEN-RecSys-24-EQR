Mamallapuram (மாமல்லபுரம் Māmallapuram), also known as Mahabalipuram, is a tourist town 60 km south of Chennai on the east coast of India, famous for its stone carvings.


Understand[edit]
Panorama of Shore Temple
Mamallapuram dates back to the Tamil Pallava dynasty in the 7th-9th century. The structures here, mostly carved straight out of granite, are among the oldest existing examples of Dravidian (South Indian) architecture.
Today's Mamallapuram is purely a tourist town and one of the major attractions around Chennai.  The East Coast Road has made it easily accessible - just about an hour from the city. Unfortunately, the entire strip is now a mess of restaurants, resorts, amusement parks, people, discarded plastic and chaotic traffic. At one time you could see the Bay of Bengal almost all the way to M'puram, but now there is so much development that the ocean is glimpsed only as you get close to M'puram.
Mamallapuram itself was getting run down over the last decade with very patchy efforts at keeping the monuments preserved. This has changed in the last few years with the Shore Temple being included in the UNESCO heritage project. The surroundings have been made much nicer, but, there has been a lot of wind and water erosion on the temple carvings with many of them having undergone loss of detail over the years. Sort of too little, too late, but still, better than nothing.
Be prepared to fight your way through clutches of beggars, guides, snakes charmers and so on, all of which are an essential part of the experience and not to be frowned upon. The whole thing would be bland without them. A nuisance, but harmless.

Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
Buses arrive in the centre of town from CMBT and Tiruvanmiyur in Chennai and from Kanchipuram. There are direct buses from CMBT, but you can take any bus that has ECR written on the front. The ECR bus, which can be picked up at Tiruvanmiur, is the most economical way of getting to Mamallapuram from Chennai, costing less than ₹40 (1 hour). The ECR bus will drop you about 2 kilometres outside of town, and rickshaws will be outside waiting (can be bargained down to ₹30). You can also catch the ECR bus from Pondicherry for ₹65 (2 hours).
To get to the ECR from Triplicane, walk to Kamarajar Promenade running parallel with the beach. Walk to the beach side of the road and head to the nearest bus stop. Take bus SP19 or SP19x to Tiruvanmiyur (₹15). The ECR bus stop is 30 meters before the Tiruvanmiur stop.

By taxi[edit]
A taxi from Chennai will cost ₹600-₹800 one-way ($15–20) though the rates are likely to be higher based on the season, cab operator. Visitors outside Chennai, even Indian nationals and most definitely from Overseas are likely to be asked for higher rates. To or from the airport will cost ₹800-₹1,200 and will take one hour off peak and 1 1/2 hours peak time. Please negotiate the cab fares at the beginning of the journey and remain firm if the operator asks for more.

By car[edit]
The drive from Chennai on the East Coast Road is, by Indian standards, a wonderful experience: it is one of the few toll roads in India and maintained well.  That said, it's still only one lane per direction with no divider, so overtaking tends to be hair-raising and high-speed head-on collisions are all too common.  The road runs parallel to the coast of Bay of Bengal making it a scenic driveway, although you will not see the sea until the last few miles.  The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami wreaked havoc around here, so you will see shanty-towns built for affected fishermen and much of the greenery has been swept away.

Get around[edit]
Map of Mamallapuram
It is easy to get around the town on foot, though bike rental is also available. It is relatively a small city and all points of interest are close to each other.  Paid parking areas are available near the Shore Temple and the Five Rathas.
You can also hire a cab (non-a/c) for about ₹150 for 2 1/2 hours, during which you will be taken to all the major tourists spots in Mamallapuram.

The ticket counter closes at 5:30PM and entry to the attractions ends at 6PM. A combined entrance ticket to the Shore Temple and the Five Rathas costs ₹600 for foreigners and ₹35 for Indian citizens. Local guides, who speak multiple languages, are available for around ₹600 for a tour of all main attractions.

Rath Temples[edit]
These temples are carved out of a rock rather than carved into a rock (Cave temples). 

12.6089380.189511 Five Rathas (Pancha Pandava Rathas). This site contains five rathas, literally chariots, dating from the 7th century. The sculptures are complemented by some enormous stone animals, including a large elephant. The Pandavas were five (panch in Sanskrit) brothers who led one side in the great war described in the ancient and sacred epic the Mahabharata. There are raths or chariots for Judisthir (known as Dharmaraj), Bhim and Arjun. Draupadi the common wife of the five brothers also has a chariot. The chariots of Arjun and Draupadi stand on the same platform. The twin brothers of Nakul and Sahadev share the fifth chariot. Apart from the chariot of Nakul and Sahadev the other four are in a linear alignment and have entrances on the western side. The chariot of Nakul and Sahadev is located west of the other four chariot and faces south, The complex also has an elephant and tiger statue.

Structural temples[edit]
The structural (free-standing) temples at Mamallapuram have been built with cut stones as building blocks, rather than carved into a rock (cave temples) or out of a rock (ratha temples).

12.6164480.1992315 Shore Temple. The oldest structure in the area, built c. 700 AD. A Shiva lingam is enshrined in the central building. Unlike Mamallapuram's other monuments, the Shore Temple is a building (not carved from rock) and the bulk of the current structure is a reconstruction after it was struck by a cyclone. It's not particularly large, and the carvings have been badly eroded by the wind and the sea, but this adds to the sense of antiquity. The area around the temple is now a landscaped park, with guards keeping the hordes of souvenir hawkers at bay; despite that, the site can get very crowded on weekends. 
12.62713780.19488316 Mukunda Nayanar Temple. 
12.61512380.19150517 Olakkanesvara temple. Known as the 'Old Light House'" this structural temple stands atop the Mahishasuramardini Cave. (updated Sep 2021)
Other rock monuments[edit]
12.6191480.1924118 Krishna's Butterball. This is a giant natural rock perched on a hillside, seemingly in defiance of all laws of physics—it's a common sight to see visitors placing hands under the stone posing for pics, which looks as though they are holding it! The rock provides welcome shade if you dare to sit underneath it, and local kids have discovered that the slippery nearby hillside also makes a great natural slide. 
Rock reliefs[edit]
Reliefs are carved on rocks or boulders.

12.6177480.1926419 Arjuna's Penance (Descent of the Ganges). A giant bas-relief filled with detailed carvings, including a family of elephants and monkeys. Archaeologists still squabble over what, exactly, the bas relief depicts; the central figure may actually depict Bhagiratha, not Arjuna. 
Museums[edit]
12.6158580.1936520 Sculpture Museum (Meganath Sculptures), No. 32, Five Rathas Road, East Raja Street. This museum has hundreds of sculptures in stone, wood etc. It is well worth a visit. ₹2 entrance fee.

Lighthouse[edit]
12.61542880.1918223 Light House and museum. 10AM-5:30PM. The lighthouse dates back to 1887 and is open to the public. A spiral stair leads to the top offering a birds-eye view of land and sea including the ruined temples and caves. The complex also houses a lighthouse museum. The operation of the lighthouse is explained with several models. On display is a series of old lighthouse lamps. Prior to the construction of the lighthouse the nearby Olakkanesvara temple served as a lighthouse with lights fitted on its top. Those lights and equipment are on display in the museum. The museum also has a short light and sound show operating several times a day. (updated Sep 2021)
Note: Old and new light houses provide views across the area to the sea. There are several unfinished temples nearby, and the December 2004 tsunami exposed more previously submerged temples.

Learn[edit]
Local sculptors in the main street leading to the sea (after the Tina Shell View Lodge) teach stone carving. You will learn how to sculpt a simple locket, and the longer you stay, the more complicated things you'll be able to do. For a simple locket at least 5 hours are needed. For ₹100 a day you can learn/work as long as you like everyday (the result is yours of course).

Buy[edit]
Stone sculptures made by local artists. You can see them on their work (and also learn it yourself, see #Learn). You can save a lot of money if you buy sculptures in small side roads and not in the main road.

Eat[edit]

There are lots of food stands in the centre serving large portions for next-to-nothing prices. Look specifically at the road leading down the Shore Temple from the bus stop, early in the morning at breakfast time.
Mamallapuram is famous for its coconuts, which are available from hawkers around all major sites.

Stay safe[edit]
India's first nuclear reactor and much of its nuclear research program is just down the beach in Kalpakkam.  Don't wander into restricted areas.
Most restaurants close by 11PM and the town is basically dead after that. Loitering around very late at night is not too safe.
Be careful when getting into the sea. There can be sudden dips and the sea often gets very rough and unsafe.

Nearby[edit]
The Eagle Temple — a short bus ride from Mamallupuram brings you to the spectacular Eagle Temple.  Take it easy on the climb up, as it's a long way, but the views are worth it.
