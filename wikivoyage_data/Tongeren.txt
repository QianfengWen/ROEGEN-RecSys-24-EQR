History[edit]
Archaeologists have found objects in the region dating from between 5300 and 4800 BC, and the oldest remains of buildings are from a Roman camp standing there from 30 BC, which was abandoned after a decade or so to be occupied by the Tungri tribe. It's unclear who the Tungri were; local tribes, Germans coming across the Rhine, or an alliance of these (tungri in Celtic means "companions"). The Romans then named the place Atuatuca Tungrorum - the fortress of the Tungri. In 69-70 AD, local tribes revolted against the Roman rule in an event known as the Revolt of the Batavi. The Romans put down the revolt and burned down the fortress.
With Romans controlling the region, the fortress and town was rebuilt. A road to Cassel (near Paris), an aqueduct, a temple and many commerces were constructed to make it the capital of civitas Tungrorum . Later ramparts and walls were built to protect the prospering city from attacks by Franks and Vandals. In the 4th century also Christianity arrived, and Saint Materne of Cologne set up a diocese seat in the town and converted the population. The diocese would soon be moved to Maastricht and finally to Liège which became the main city of the region and the capital of the Prince-Bishopric of Liège, part of the Holy Roman Empire. Tongeren still remained the second city of the principality, as officially declared in the 1316 Peace of Feixhe, a kind of Magna Carta. A few decades earlier, between 1241 and 1290 a new city wall with six gates and twelve fortified towers had been built.
In the 15th and 16th centuries, the region saw many wars between the states in the region despite the neutrality of Liège. The 17th century was marked by peace until the Franco-Dutch War when the French burned most of the city to the ground in 1677. This definitely meant the end of the grand days, and today Tongeren is definitely nothing like the second city in a country. In 1795 Tongeren became part of France, and its status was reduced to a locality in the department of Meuse-Inférieure. After the defeat of Napoleon, in 1815, the parts of France that make up present-day Belgium became part of the Limburg province of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Then, in 1839, the southern part of Limburg including Tongeren became part of the new Belgian kingdom and a local administration was set up here.
During the 20th century, Tongeren was occupied by Germans for several years during both world wars and was bombed with V1 bombs in 1944 after being liberated. After the war the city was developed into commercial centre, and with the merger of surrounding municipalities in the 1970s, the city grew both in population and size.
