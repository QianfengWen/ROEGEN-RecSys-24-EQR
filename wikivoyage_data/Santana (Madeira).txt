Santana is a town and municipality on the northeastern coast of Madeira.


Understand[edit]

Santana (suhn-TUH-nuh, /sɐ̃.ˈtɐ.nɐ/) is on a high plateau above the sea of the north coast of Madeira, which can be described as extensive by Madeiran standards. The mountains retreat so far here that agriculture can be practised in the immediate vicinity. The name goes back to a chapel built here in 1572, which was dedicated to Santa Ana (Sant-ana).
The city is the administrative seat of the district of the same name, which extends to Pico Ruivo.
The district has been classified as a World Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO.

Get in[edit]
Map of Santana (Madeira)


By car[edit]
Via the coastal highway ER-101, Santana can be reached from the island's capital Funchal in approx. 40 minutes, from Santa Cruz airport in approx. 20 minutes.
To the west is the only area of the coastal motorway that has not yet been tunneled under by expressways (apart from the west coast). As far as Ponta Delgada, the very narrow and winding old coastal road follows every valley cut and is more to be seen as a tourist adventure than a traffic route.

By bus[edit]
The operators  SAM and Horarios do Funchal (line 56,129) often connect Santana to the airport and to the capital via the east coast or the eastern hill country.
There are also connections westwards to Arco de São Jorge. From there, Rodoeste operates lines to Sao Vicente, Ribeira Brava and Porto Moniz (the latter with a rather complicated change in São Vicente).

Madeira houses in Santana
Casas de Colmo. Santana was known for decades for this traditional form of living, also known as Madeira houses or Santana huts. These are thatched wooden houses that crouch under a triangular gable roof that extends almost to the ground. Painted in different colors and decorated with flowers, they look cute; in fact, the families are crammed together under them. Almost all of the original houses have now fallen into disrepair or, as can be seen on the outskirts, are used as makeshift storage sheds. At the so-called Núcleo de Casas Típicas at the town hall or in the Parque tematico, the huts can also be explored from the inside to get a feel for former living conditions. Otherwise it is more like folkloric replicas.
Parish church Iglesia matriz. Built in 1638, with baroque carvings and azulejo tiles in the chancel.
Miradouros (viewpoints):
Fortim do Faial: View to the mountains.
Cabanas: View over São Jorge and Arco de São Jorge.
