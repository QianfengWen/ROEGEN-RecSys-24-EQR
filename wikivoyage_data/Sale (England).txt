Sale is a small town in Greater Manchester, five miles southwest of city centre. It was a market town in Cheshire which became industrial in the 18th century, and in 1974 became part of the Borough of Trafford, along with nearby Altrincham and Stretford. It's nowadays a commuter town for Manchester.


Get in[edit]
Sale Water Park
By plane[edit]
From Manchester Airport you can take any train to Piccadilly then change, though it's a big station with a long walk between some platforms. But two trains an hour (for Blackpool and for Liverpool) run via Manchester Deansgate on the tram route: the fare is the same but it might save 20 min. You could even take the tram all the way from the airport, a slow journey for not much cheaper.

By tram[edit]
Metrolink trams (green and purple lines) take 25 min from central Manchester via St Peters Square, Deansgate, Old Trafford and Stretford to Sale, continuing via Timperley to Altrincham. Sale is in Fare Zone 3 so a single journey from city centre is £3.80; trams run every 10-15 min 6AM-midnight. The purple line starts from Piccadilly, and the green line starts from Bury and runs via Prestwich and Victoria then through city centre. Change in city centre for the other lines to Sale Water Park, Wythenshawe and the airport, to Imperial War Museum and Trafford Centre (this line opened in 2020), through Piccadilly to Ashton-under-Lyne, through Victoria to Oldham and Rochdale, and to Salford Quays and Eccles. See TGM website for fare deals, service updates and travel planner; you must buy your ticket before boarding.

By car[edit]
Sale stretches along A56, which connects Altrincham to Manchester. From M60 take jcn 6 for the water park and eastern parts such as Barlow Moor, jcn 7 for main drag along A56, and jcn 8 for western parts such as Ashton-upon-Mersey.

By bus[edit]
Arriva Northwest Bus 263 runs every 15 min from Manchester Piccadilly via Old Trafford and Stretford to Sale (35 min), continuing to Altrincham.

Get around[edit]

The town straggles along A56, often busy with traffic. It's a pleasanter walk along the towpath, west bank of the canal. The tram line runs along the east bank, with stops (coming south from city centre) at Dane Road, 53.424-2.3191 Sale and Brooklands, then continuing to Altrincham. 
The water park is one mile east of Dane Road tram stop. It has its own stop but on a different line, to Wythenshawe and the airport, so from Sale you'd have to backtrack via city centre.

See[edit]
Bridgewater Canal through Sale
53.42414-2.309191 Worthington Park is a pleasant green space half a mile east of the centre, with a skate ramp. There's a statue to James Joule (1818-1889), the physicist, mathematician and brewer. Running the family brewery in Salford, he was looking for the most efficient way of raising heat to drive processes, and this led him into fundamental insights into the very nature of heat, energy such as electricity, and their equivalent in work. The SI derived unit the joule is named for him. He's buried in nearby Brooklands cemetery. Joule's Brewery transferred to the Midlands and went out of business in the 1970s, but has re-started as a micro-brewery in Market Drayton, Shropshire.
In 53.418-2.3122 Walkden Gardens the dovecote is a remnant of Sale Old Hall, built in 1603 but demolished in 1920. The other remnant is the lodge, now occupied by the golf club. The gardens are open daily from 9AM, to 4:30PM in winter and 7PM in summer.
Eyebrow Cottage on Cross St is Sale's oldest building, a farmhouse built around 1670. It's named for the decorative brick pattern above the window. It's privately owned and you can't look inside.
Do[edit]
53.432-2.2991 Sale Water Park is a mile northeast of town centre, between M60 and the River Mersey. It was created in the 1970s when gravel was scooped out for the motorway embankment, and the pit became a lake. It's good for strolling, bird-watching, angling and water activities such as kayaking, jet skis and windsurfing. The park is open dawn till dusk and has free parking, plus a couple of pub restaurants close by. It's on the navy blue tram line from Manchester city centre to Wythenshawe and the airport, but this doesn't run through Sale centre.
Walk, cycle or boat along the Bridgewater Canal, which runs through town east of and parallel to A56, with multiple access points. It's navigable throughout, though the towpath is in variable condition. It forms part of the  Cheshire Ring, a 97-mile canal circuit that takes a week to putter round. Though the Bridgewater is broad, the Ring canals edging the Pennines to the east have only 7-foot beam maximum, so you need a narrowboat and a sharp intake of breath to squeeze through these.
53.41534-2.329792 Walton Park by the canal southside of town has playing fields, bowling greens and pleasant open space. A miniature railway offers rides on Sundays.
Watch rugby - both versions - but for the top games you have to go four miles north. Sale Sharks play rugby union (15-a-side) in the Premiership, England's top tier, but they nowadays play at AJ Bell Stadium in Eccles, Salford, and share it with rugby league (13-a-side) team Salford Red Devils.
Sale FC Rugby Club play rugby union in town, at Heywood Road, Brooklands. They play in National League 1, the third tier.
Swinton Lions play rugby league at Heywood Road. They play in the Championship, RL's second tier; the playing season is Mar-Oct.
Football: Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium is only four miles northeast, three stops on the tram route towards city centre.

Head for one of Sale's many namesakes around the world. Many towns share names, but few can offer such contrasts as the cattle-drove Sale in Victoria Australia, ancient Sale in Grecian Thrace, the Berber centre and sometime pirate republic of Salé in Morocco, cold uninhabited Sale off Baffin Island in Canada, the safari area of Sale in Ngorongoro Tanzania, Sale or Shali east of Kazan in Russia's Tartarstan, and the Buddhist monastic centre of Sale in Myanmar.
