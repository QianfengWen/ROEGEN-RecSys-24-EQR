For other places with the same name, see Fukushima (disambiguation).


Fukushima (福島) is the capital city of Fukushima Prefecture in Honshu, Japan in the Fukushima Basin and its surrounding parts. Known for its fruit production, Fukushima is particularly proud of their peaches, but pears and apples and persimmons are also grown.
Fukushima was hit by high magnitude earthquake on 11 March 2011. A nuclear plant Fukushima Dai-ichi, located some 60 km to the south-east at the Pacific coast, was damaged in the quake and an evacuation zone was established. Fukushima city is well outside the evacuation zone, which occupies 2.4% (as of 2024) of the prefecture's land area. Elevated radiation levels have been detected (though still quite low), and while debate rages on about the long-term effects of these levels, a short stay in Fukushima is not likely to do you any harm.

Taxis are abundant around the station, though may be harder to find elsewhere.
Buses and trains are convenient for heading out of the city, including the surrounding hot spring areas.
Momorin Share Cycles are a good way to explore Fukushima City, at just \50/30 minutes, though you need to install and use a Japanese-only app on your device. 18 unmanned bicycle ports are located within the city. There is one on either side of JR Fukushima Station. Bicycles are motor-assisted and have large basket, bell, key/lock, and automatic light. They can be borrowed 24 hours everyday.
Walking is sufficient around the station, central shopping arcade, and the evening bar and restaurant area. Fukushima downtown is compact with few changes in elevation. There are also paths along rivers 15–20 minutes away which make longer walks or jogs an enjoyable activity.
Do note there are many underground pedestrian walkways in the city. Access is via stairs or escalators, and elevators, but you may have to hunt around for them. Besides the necessary and very long underground walkway beneath JR Fukushima Station, most are just optional shortcuts.
