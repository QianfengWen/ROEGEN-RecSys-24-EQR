Puerto del Carmen is a large tourist resort on the south coast of Lanzarote, a few km west of Arrecife the capital and airport. It has long sandy beaches (unusual on this island) which are more sheltered than the exposed north and west-facing coasts. It's part of the municipality of Tías but has far outgrown that small town, and in 2022 it had a population of 11,319. 


Understand[edit]
This settlement first appears on maps as Tiñosa in the 16th century. It had the best natural harbour on this craggy coast, and became a port trading with mainland Spain and inter-island. When the Spanish ports were systematised in 1900 it was declared a "Puerto de Interés General", meaning it had international shipping and strategic value beyond the oversight of a single autonomous community. But modern shipping outgrew it and better docks were built at Arrecife, so from 1928 that became the island's chief port. In 1957 Tiñosa was re-named Puerto del Carmen in honour of Nuestra Señora del Carmen, the Virgin Mary in her role as patron of the Carmelite monks. The place was clearly destined to remain a quiet fishing village where everyone went to church on Sunday and crossed themselves rather than yield to temptation.
Then from the 1970s mass tourism grew as Lanzarote came within easy flying range of north Europe. The town acquired a 6 km resort strip east from the harbour along sandy beaches to the airport perimeter fence, with Av de las Playas lined by hotels, bars and restaurants. It doesn't stretch inland very far as the land rises steeply - anyone with restricted mobility needs to check the gradient to their intended accommodation. Within 1 km the buildings give way to the arid black hills of the interior.
