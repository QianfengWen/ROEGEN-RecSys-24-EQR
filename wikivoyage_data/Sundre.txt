Map of Sundre
Sundre is a town of about 2,700 people (2016) in the Rocky Mountain foothills of Foothills region of Alberta, Canada.


Understand[edit]
Sundre is an emerging resort town on the Red Deer River. It was established by cowboys, rangers and a Norwegian postman. In the summer its small population of 2,700 is joined by a constant stream of campers, hikers, "just-out-of-college" back-packers, cowboys, golfers, art lovers, and international tourists. Its commercial centre is the 2nd largest in the region and it is just possible that there are more stores, coffee shops and services than residents.

Stay safe[edit]
Bears & cougars: The mountains and foothills are bear country and home to the cougar. Understanding wildlife and how they interact with people is key to remaining safe. Bear Smart information is available from Alberta Sustainable Resource Development, which also recommends walking in groups of 3 or more, sealing food and removing all trash from any site you visit.

Moose large wild animals that can cause injury by charging. They are common throughout the region and can be seen on the roadways and even walking down the centre of towns or in parks.
Driving and wildlife Deer and moose frequently cross roads and highways, presenting dangers to drivers. If you see wildlife from any distance, near or on a road way, slow down and be prepared to stop suddenly. They are most difficult to spot at night.
