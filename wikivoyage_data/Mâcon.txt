Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
From A6 coming from Paris or Lyon, get off at Mâcon Nord or Mâcon Sud.

By train[edit]
There are two train stations: Mâcon-Ville in the centre for local trains (and slow trains from farther away) and Mâcon-Loché about 10 km outside of town for the TGV from Lyon and Paris.

Get around[edit]
There are a couple of bus lines, but the small size of the central area makes it easier to get around on foot.
For cars, traffic is a problem on the main roads out of town only when people are getting off of work. Parking in town can be a problem as all lots are metered and often full.

See[edit]
 Old Saint-Vincent. 
Do[edit]
Drive outside of town and visit one of the many wineries that make burgundy wine or drive about 20 min south and visit the Beaujolais wineries which make much more (and much better) wines than just Beaujolais Nouveau.

Buy[edit]
In the pedestrian area in the centre there are many shops, mostly clothing, but also toys, food, home decor, etc.

Eat[edit]
You can pretty much find pretty anything you want despite the town small size: classic French cuisine (at any price range), Chinese or Indian, fast food or day-long meals.

Budget[edit]
 Er Bleimor, 12 rue Gambetta, 71000 Mâcon, ☏ +33 3 85 39 02 22. Very good crèpes with a wide variety toppings (sweat or savoury). Great for a quick meal before hitting the movies across the street but be sure to make reservations as it is tiny and almost always packed. €5-15. 
 La Taverna, 95 Quai Lamartine, 71000 Mâcon, ☏ +33 3 85 50 30 93. Italian buffet or pizzas, not bad for the price with a nice choice on the buffet €10-20. 
Any of the numerous kebab places serving up gyros and various other sandwiches for around €5.

Mid-range[edit]
 Restaurant L'Ambroisie, 39 Rue de la République, 71000 Macon, ☏ +33 3 85 38 12 21. It maybe be on the outskirts of the industrial park, but this restaurant serves good typical "brasserie" type dishes and the staff is always helpful. €20–40. 
 Quai 119, 119 Quai Bouchacourt, 01750 Saint-Laurent-sur-Saône, ☏ +33 3 85 39 46 10. If you're looking for traditional "Bresse" cuisine, then hop over the river (easily done on foot if you're in the city centre) to Saint Laurent and the Quai 119. Even the most basic menu (a little less than €20) gets you things like salmon tartare and "poulet à la crème". €20–40. 
Splurge[edit]
Drink[edit]
Choose from any of the bars on the quais (along the river) as they are almost the same: medium prices, hip atmosphere, and the main road only a couple feet away.
For something different, try the Traboule(back in an alley on the pedestrian street), somewhat like a British pub. Nice selection of beers on tap and a grungy atmosphere to go with them.
You can also try the Maison de Bois, a café/restaurant in an old wooden building on the pedestrian street.
In the summer go for the little hut like bar on the paved "Esplande Lamartine" along the river, no table service and plastic cups, but one of the cheapest in town and nothing beats sipping a nice drink on a chaise longue in the summer heat as the river slowly moves along.
Of course you can also head out of town during the day and hit up one of the many local wine producers for some white or red Burgundy or Beaujolais.

Sleep[edit]
There are a couple of hotels in town, or you can try further out for cheap lodgings like Formula One.
