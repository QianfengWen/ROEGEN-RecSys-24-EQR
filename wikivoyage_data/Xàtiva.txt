Xàtiva (Spanish: Játiva) is a city of 29,000 people (2018) in Valencia (province). The town is notable for its large, dramatically-situated fortress as well as its atmospheric, well-preserved city centre.


Understand[edit]
Xàtiva has been inhabited continuously since Iberian times, and is one of the few Spanish cities which has preserved its pre-Roman name (Iberian: Saiti‎). During the Roman period the city was known for textiles; later the Moors introduced paper in Europe by establishing a paper manufacturing centre here. Xàtiva was also the hometown of the notorious Borgia (Borja) family and the birthplace of one of its more infamous members, Pope Alexander VI.

Castle and environs[edit]
Església Collegiata Basílica de Santa Maria
Castell de Xàtiva
38.98289-0.518851 Castell de Xàtiva (Castillo de Játiva / Castle of Xàtiva), ☏ +34 962 274 274. Winter Tu-Su 10:00-18:00, summer Tu-Su 10:00-19:00; last admission ½ hr before closing. This large hilltop fortification was first established by the Iberians, with the oldest section being the eastern side of the castle (Castell Menor, or 'Lower Castle'). After the Roman conquest, the original eastern section was expanded and a second fortress (Castell Major, or 'Upper Castle') was built to the west. Both castles were reinforced by the Moors, who also built the walls connecting the fort with the town below. After the Christian Reconquista further renovations were carried out, and the Upper Castle was used for a time as a jail for political prisoners. In the 18th century the castle suffered serious damage first during the Spanish War of Succession, and later from an earthquake in 1748, after which it fell into disuse. In the early 20th century a wealthy local businessman built, as a residence, a new section between the two castles, in the neo-Gothic style. This set of buildings now house a restaurant, exhibition hall, and visitor center.Each castle affords great views of the city below, and of the mirroring castle. The walk up the (small) mountain is most scenic via the footpaths which pass by the Ermita de Sant Feliu and La Nevera (listed below). For those who don't want to walk there is also a tourist train which departs twice a day from the tourist office (summer: 12:30 and 17:30, winter: 12:30 and 16:30; €4.20), which winds its way through the town and uphill to the castle. Alternatively, a one-way taxi ride from the tourist office will cost about €11. Castle admission €2.40 (adults), €1.20 (children); free Tu afternoons.   (updated Sep 2017)
38.98416-0.515772 Torre del Sol (Tower of the Sun / Almohad Tower).

The interior is generally not open to the public, but can be appreciated through the windows. Free. (updated Nov 2015)
