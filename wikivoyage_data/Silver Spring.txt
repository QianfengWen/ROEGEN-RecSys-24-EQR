Silver Spring is an unincorporated community in Montgomery County, Maryland. It is considered to be an "edge city". It sits next door to Washington, DC, and had about 82,000 residents in 2018. It has redeveloped its downtown district with an outdoor shopping plaza called "Downtown Silver Spring", and is criss-crossed by four creeks that are the basis for parks offering hiking trails, playgrounds, picnic areas, and tennis courts.

38°59′38″N 77°1′37″WMap of Silver Spring

Silver Spring is just across the northeast border of Washington D.C. at Eastern Ave.
As the story goes, Silver Spring was named after a spring with flecks of mica that was discovered in 1840. Francis Preston Blair, one of the organizers of the Republican Party, discovered the spring and owned most of the land that now comprises Silver Spring. He named his mansion Silver Spring after the spring. The spring is said to have been located in what is now 38.989622-77.0311981 Acorn Park on East-West Highway.

See[edit]
39.010945-77.0566492 National Park Seminary, 2791 Linden Ln (Georgia Avenue north, left on Seminary Road, keep left onto Linden Lane). Dating back to 1187, this site, formerly a finishing school for girls and resort community, is odd. Inspired by the 1893 World Fair in Chicago, the Seminary owner decided to build 10 buildings of styles around the world including a Greek theater, a Japanese pagoda, and a Dutch windmill. Following the Great Depression and World War II, the Seminary could barely make ends meet, and the entire property was commandeered by the U.S. Army's Walter Reed Medical Hospital in 1942. The military demolished historic property and generally neglected the beautiful exotic and Victorian buildings. Gaining official historic status saved many of the buildings from demolition, but the neglect continued, allowing the elements and vandals to take their toll. In the 1980s, the "Save Our Seminary" group formed to protect what was left, and did an admirable job. The Army returned the historic Seminary properties to private hands and they were restored. 2-hour guided tours on the 4th Saturday of each month at 1PM: $5.
