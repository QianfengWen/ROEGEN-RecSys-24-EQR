Map of Te Kuiti
You can easily walk from one end of the town to the other, though during the hot summertime you'll probably want to take a break now and then.
The train station is located in the centre of town. Exiting the station, to your left there is an Information Centre and public lavatories. Rora Street, which runs parallel to the station, has places to eat and shop.
The Information Centre can give you a map of town which points out different things to see as you walk around the town.
