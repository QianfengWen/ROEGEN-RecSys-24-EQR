Marijampolė is the administrative centre of the Sūduva region of southern Lithuania. It's industrial and in 2022 had a population of 36,234.


Understand[edit]
After an earlier town burnt down in 1765, a new settlement grew up around the monastery of the Marian Fathers, hence "Maryam-pol". It burned again in 1868 and was rebuilt in stone. It was wrecked yet again during the Second World War, when most of its substantial Jewish population were massacred, then the conquering Soviets deported thousands of local people to Siberian gulags. Post-war Marijampolė was rebuilt on a grid pattern and has light industry and a university but few antiquities.
