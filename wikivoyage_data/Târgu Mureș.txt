Târgu Mureș, sometimes abbreviated Tg. Mureș and known as Marosvásárhely among its Hungarian-speaking population, is a city in Transylvania, Romania.


Understand[edit]
Famous for its Art Nouveau buildings, Târgu Mureș is the cultural and economical centre of the Székely Land. First mentioned as Forum Siculorum in a document dating to 1300, market rights were bestowed in 1482. Both the Romanian name Târgu Mureș and Hungarian Marosvásárhely mean "market (place) on the river Mureș/Maros". The town prospered especially during the late-19th and early-20th century, the population quadrupled between 1869 and 1966. 
Before World War I, Marosvásárhely belonged to the Kindom of Hungary and 90% of inhabitants were ethnic Hungarians and Hungarian-speaking Jews. Since 1919, when the town was awarded to Romania, the share of ethnic Romanians grew steadily, but Magyars (ethnic Hungarians) still were the majority population until the 1990s. Nowadays, ethnic Romanians make up just over half of the population, with 45% Magyars and more than 2% Romanies. There is a religious diversity as well: 47% profess Romanian Orthodoxy, 30% belong to the Reformed (Protestant) Church, 13.5% are Roman Catholic, 2.6% each are Eastern Catholic or Unitarian.
