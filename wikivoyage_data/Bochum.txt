Landmark of Bochum - the headframe at the German Mining Museum
Bochum is a city in the Ruhr area of the state North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany. This former mining town of 363,000 people (2021) is known for its university, which is one of the largest in Germany.


Understand[edit]
Bochum is part of the Ruhr Area (Ruhrgebiet), the centre of heavy industry in Germany. Its history is linked closely to that of the region. In 1850, Bochum was a small town of about 4500 inhabitants, its population increased in 1900 to 100 000, and in 1935 to 300 000. During World War II, its centre was nearly completely destroyed, which gave city planners an opportunity to test out their theory of the "automotive city" and build what were then considered to be modern buildings. With the end of the coal boom in the 1960s, a structural transformation began. Bochum got the first university of the Ruhr Area, which was opened in 1965. Today it is one of the largest universities of the country with about 35 000 students and excellent reputation. Also in the 1960s, the Opel car production plant became productive and offered jobs for miners who had lost their jobs in mining. Mining and steel production came to an end in the 1980s.
Today Bochum is a modern city with a job focus in the service sector.
Bochum is on the border between the flat Münsterland in the north and the highlands of Bergisches Land in the south. Therefore, the northern part of Bochum is quite flat, the highest hill is the Tippelsberg. The southern limits of Bochum touch the Ruhr valley with lake Kemnade.
In the 19th century, industrialization began in the valley of Ruhr and moved in the following years northwards.  The valley of Ruhr is a recreation area for the population. The Ruhr is the water reservoir for the region, therefore the rules for keeping the water clean are quite strict. Swimming is forbidden in the Kemnade, while swimming in the Ruhr is permitted but not recommended because of the strong flow. Pleasure boats are allowed everywhere.
Like most cities in the Ruhr Area, the southern quarters are of high standard and are quite expansive while factories will be found mainly in the northern quarters.

By car[edit]
Bochum is at the intersection of highway A40 (east/west) and A43 (north/south), with A448 (east/west) branching off A40 west of the city centre, forming the southern part of the highway loop around central Bochum, intersecting with A43 before continuing eastwards to A45 at Dortmund. The entire Ruhr Area is sprawling and decentralised and thus quite car-oriented, which also explains the heavily congested rush hour traffic. "Avoid the peak times at all costs" is not just some obvious hint, A40 is jokingly known locally as Ruhrschleichweg or Ruhr crawling way. Additionally, Bochum is covered extensively by a low-emission zone (Umweltzone), requiring many vehicles, including foreign ones, to have an appropriate sticker. This does not apply to through-traffic on the Autobahn.

Get around[edit]
Bogestra Tram Network Bochum
Public transport is arranged by "Bochum-Gelsenkirchener Straßenbahn AG" (BOGESTRA). It is a member of the transport association Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr VRR, which cares for fares and adequate connections between its members and S-Bahn and regional trains. So with the same ticket, you may use the bus, underground, tram, S-Bahn and regional Express within Bochum and within the rest of the Ruhr Area, depending on the price category (A, B, C or D) you have selected. Since 2019, only accessible low-floor vehicles operate, although at many stops wheelchair users will need the fold-out ramps operated by the driver to board, as many stops are merely signs on the side of the street. Stops are announced and shown on digital screens.  
You will find customer service offices in the main subway station, and in the Bogestra Administration Building at Universitätsstraße 58.

Tickets[edit]
There are 4 price levels: for travelling within one city you need level A, for a ride to the next neighbour city pricing level B is needed, if you transit 3 tickets use level C and level D is for rides to any location within the area of VRR.
You can obtain tickets from the customer offices of Bogestra, from the ticket-machines at underground stations and major interchange stops, from bus drivers and tram drivers (only outside the tunnel sections) and from designated kiosks, as well from the official Mutti routeplanning and ticketing app available for download for free.

Buildings, production halls, monuments[edit]
Administration, residential buildings, monuments[edit]

Built in 1902 for the trade-fair in Düsseldorfer and later used as a machinery hall of the steel-plant Bochumer Vereins. Notable is the filigree construction of the bearing.

Miner's Settlement, Dahlhauser Heide
 Dahlhauser Heide Miners' settlement (from Bochum Hbf by bus 368 to "Hordeler Heide"). Built in the beginning of the 20th century for the workers of the Hannover mine. It was reconstructed and the outfit brought to today's standard. A walk there is recommended. Between 1850 and 1900 the population of Bochum increased from about 4500 to 100,000 by immigration. In order to avoid slums, companies began to erect settlements, supermarkets and hospitals for their employees aside their grounds. This social act by companies prevented ghettos and poverty. The living conditions in those settlements was above the standard of that times. Often built in the style of a garden city they are preferred quarters today. Within Bochum, the best known settlement is "Dahlhauser Heide". (updated Mar 2017)
Beside the Am Rübenkamp settlement, there are 3 houses in original outfit. They show daily life of miners. They are under control of the Mine Hannover industrial museum.
In the district of Wattenscheid at Alter Markt square, there are still some houses left from times before industrialisation. They give an impression how most towns at the Ruhr looked like 100 years ago.
Houses of worship[edit]
51.48227.220568 Propsteikirche St. Peter und Paul, Untere Marktstraße. The oldest church in Bochum. Its root is a wooden chapel probably donated by Charlemagne. In the eleventh century, the chapel was replaced by a stone church. It burned down during the big fire in the city in 1517, and was rebuilt as a hall church in a late Gothic style, except the Romanic chancel, which had resisted the fire. The arch was implemented in 1536, the steeple was finished after 1547. The Romanic chancel was replaced by a chancel in neo-Gothic stype between 1872 and 1874. Today, the church houses some artworks like the Romanic font, the neo-Gothic graved altar, the "Bladenhorst crux" in the high altar, the Ittenbach-Madonna, the feretory of St. Perpetua and Felicitas and, last not least, the oak crying group dated from 1420.  (updated Mar 2017)
 Pauluskirche, Pariser Str. 4-6. The oldest Protestant church in Bochum. After the Reformation, Protestants and Catholics used the same church, but not always in harmony. Therefore the Protestant community built in 1655 a separate house of worship, a Renaissance hall church with wooden roof. During the following centuries several refurbishments were executed: in 1902/1903 the church got neo-Gothic windows. After an air raid in 1943 the church burned down to ground. In 1949/1950 it was rebuilt in style of a medieval village church. Beside the church stands the “Mourning Mother”, a memorial by sculptor Gerhard Marcks to the victims of war. She is waiting for someone, obviously in vain. (updated Mar 2017)
 Christuskirche, Platz des europäischen Versprechens. When this Protestent church was completed in 1879, it was considered among the prettiest churches in Europe. In 1931 the entry hall inside the steeple was extended to a cenotaph for those killed in action during World War I. In 1943 the church was demolished by bombs nearly completely: only the steeple survived. After the war they built a new, modern church nave and combined it with the new-Gothic steeple as a memorial. Now in front of the steeple is the "Place of the European Promise". Between 2007 and 2015 stone plaques were installed with the names of citizens willing to give a promise to Europe's future. The plaques are intended to contrast to the cenotaph to the entrance hall, which underlines the hostility towards the former rivals of Germany. (updated Mar 2017)
 Propsteikirche St. Gertrud von Brabant (Gertrudis-Church), Auf der Kirchenburg 2 (in the old center of Wattenscheid). Today's building, a new-Gothic church, was built between 1868 and 1872. During the times of the Carolingian Dynasty (8th-9th century), there was there an armed church, which was followed by several sacral buildings. The baptistry inside the Gertrudis-Churchis dated from times about the year 1000. It is borne by four lions. It is considered to be one of the oldest baptistries in Germany. According to legends, the devil should have taken up a huge rock to throw it against the monastery of Werden, which was a thorn in his flesh since long. On his way he met a monk who traveled from Wattenscheid to this monastery. Thinking quickly, the monk raised his crucifix. The devil threw away the rock and disappeared blaspheming. Ludgerus, the abbott of Werden monastery, was ordered to bring the devil's rock into the monastery and form it into a baptistry, with images and 4 bearing lions. Full of gratitude for the saving of the monastery, he donated the baptistry to the church of Wattenscheid - and there it is still standing inside the Gertrudis-Church. (updated Mar 2017)
 Chapel Bochum-Stiepel, Brockhauser Straße 72a, ☏ +49 234 791337. A first hall-type church is dated to 1008. Between 1130 and 1170 it was replaced by a Romanesque basilica and extended in the 15th century. Worth seeing are the wall paintings inside and the historic graveyard.

51.485277.226710 Synagogue, Erich-Mendel-Platz 1, ☏ +49 234 4175600. 69 years after the Pogrom Night of 9 November 1938, when nearly all Jewish synagogues were destroyed in Germany, Bochum got a new synagogue. It was realised according to plans of the Cologne architect Peter Schmitz. He offered a clear and plain concept. Schmitz designed an ensemble of three separated structures which are linked together by a common bodyshell. (updated Mar 2017)

While the musical only enjoyed moderate success in its native Anglosphere and it is by far not the best known work by Andrew Lloyd Webber among English-speakers, Germans have somehow taken a liking to it, which is even odder considering that Musical is not generally a well-regarded or popular art form in Germany compared to opera or theater. The Bochum production alone has amassed 16 million admissions during its three decade run. The venue was purpose built in the 1980s for this musical. €55-141.   (updated Feb 2017)

Cycling and jogging[edit]
The "Erzbahnschwinge", a suspension bridge of the Ore-RouteThe Ore-Route (Erzbahntrasse) is a 10-km walking, jogging and cycle trail starting at West-Park and ending at canal-harbour Grimberg in Gelsenkirchen with connection to the Emscher-Trail. It has no street-crossing (except one with a small farm-track), highways, roads, rivers and railways are crossed by bridges, some of them quite impressive. It is one of the best routes within the Ruhr Area. Many sections of the route are situated on a 15-meter-high ridge, so you have a fine view onto settlements, pithead-towers, industry grounds, rock-dumps but also onto parks, fields, forests - for short onto the typical surroundings of the Ruhr.
The Kray-Wanner-Route deverges from the Ore-Route about 6 km behind the starting point and leads westwards to world heritage site Zollverein. Unfortunately, it has 4 street crossings. It passes rock-dump Rhein-Elbe which is between the district of Wattenscheid and the city of Gelsenkirchen. You should climb up, it is quite easy on well constructed paths and the view from top is excellent.
 Ruhr-Trail. The Ruhrtal-Radweg, a cycle route, leads from the river's source to its mouth into river Rhine at Duisburg. Its total length is 230 km. 
 Emscher-Trail. Emscher Radweg, is a cycle-route beside river Emscher or Rhein-Herne-canal. It leads across the region with most heavy industry, so you pass by factories and harbours, many of them closed down. It makes a strange but interesting ambiance.

Eat[edit]
Cuisine[edit]
The cuisine of Bochum is the cuisine of the Ruhr. That was a Westphalian cuisine with strong East-Prussian and Rhenish impact. That means good and solid meals with much fat. Eaten was much cabbage, meat of rabbit, goat, pork and sometimes pigeons. The cuisine has changed and is still changing. On one hand, people do not have to labour so hard any more, but, on the other hand, people have more money to spend. Also are the immigrants. They brought their own cuisine with them. Today there is Turkish, Polish, sometimes Russian and most of all Mediterranean influence.

To Bochum belongs "The Original" of butcher "Dönnighaus". That is a light sausage. It is well known even outside Bochum's limits and is the basis of a real good curried Sausage. Every visitor should taste it. You can get it all over the city at snack bars.
One long weekend in summer there is Bochum kulinarisch. Chefs from and around Bochum conjure up delicacies of their cuisine for low budget to taste. It takes place at Massenberg Boulevard, ask at the tourist office for the exact date.
September to February, blue mussels will be offered which are treated as a delicacy.
During May, there are Dutch "Matjes". These are salted herrings but with gentle taste.
Also during May is the period of asparagus. It exists as white and green one, mainly from France (first) and Germany. The German white asparagus is the best one.
Many Turkish and Arabic shops offer little sweets made from puff pastry, almonds, coconut flakes, honey and a lot of sugar (the Turkish name is tatle´). The Turkish ones are extremely sweet. The Arabic ones are similar to the European taste. They are both worth a try.

Drink[edit]
The Ruhr people drink beer. Of course, every restaurant has a wine card, but in pubs and during relaxed getting-together, they prefer beer. All beer in Germany and at the Ruhr as well is brewed according to the German purity law: only water, hop and malt. If you visit Bochum, you should taste one (or more) of the local products!

Stay safe[edit]
The cities within the Ruhr area are among the safest in Germany. Since the Ruhr is until now not a tourist region, it is not in the focus of pickpockets. But it is a good idea to take the usual precautions. Don't leave you camera unattended, don't flash around a fat wallet. Since many citizens have a migration background, the acceptance of strangers is high and the possibility of encountering racism or other prejudices is low.

Cope[edit]
Self-Service Laundromat, Nordring 71. Open M-Sa 06:00-23:00, at northern end of Kortumstraße, within walking distance to Bochum Rathaus. 5 kg from €4.50.
