Laurel is a town in southern Montana. About 7,200 people lived there in 2020. Though some refer to it as a suburb of Billings, the town is a uniquely different place.  


Understand[edit]
Laurel is home to a Cenex Harvest States oil refinery as well as one of Montana's major freight rail yards. The railroad formed Laurel and remains a part of the town's fabric. High school sports are a major event. Go Locomotives! A large outdoor arena is used for regional competitions. The stadium lights are the tallest structure in town.
While the number of businesses started increasing with the addition of a Walmart Supercenter, many of the residents still commute to Billings.
