Johor Bahru
Johor Bahru (Jawi: جوهر بهرو, Chinese: 新山) (also Johor Baru or Johore Baharu, informally called JB) is a city and the state capital of Johor in Malaysia. It is the second largest city of the country and the financial centre of the state of Johor. The city is surrounded by suburbs, industrial parks and long waterfront areas, in the southern part of Peninsular Malaysia. Johor Bahru together with Iskandar Puteri and Pasir Gudang cities and Kukup, Kulai, Pekan Nanas and Senai towns form the megaregion Iskandar Malaysia.


Areas[edit]
Johor Bahru's metropolitan area can be easily divided into four parts - North, South, East and West.

North - Its main centres are Taman Daya, Taman Mount Austin, Taman Desa Tebrau and Ulu Tiram, which can be accessed via the trunk road, Jalan Tebrau. There can be a relatively frequent peak hour jam along this road. The area is a very popular place for the local to patronise due to the latest development of AEON Tebrau, Lotus's Tebrau, IKEA Tebrau, Toppen Shopping Centre and Mount Austin's bustling socialising and entertainment district.
South - It is the main city centre (IIBD) where most of the city government agencies are located. This area is also where many of the old town areas are located, including its Chinatown, Little India and Stulang Laut waterfront areas. It is an area with housing estates which have been around for more than three decades. Important estates include Taman Pelangi, Taman Century and Taman Sentosa.
East - The main suburbs here are Plentong and Permas Jaya, a housing suburb; other part is industrial areas and the Sultan Iskandar Reservoir.
West - The main centres is Danga Bay area, an integrated waterfront development. The main suburbs here are Bandar Baru UDA, Tampoi and Kempas.
Understand[edit]
Johor Bahru is a fast-growing city. The city has about 860,000 inhabitants (2020), and its district has about 1.7 million. Johor Bahru is mostly suburban and lacks a condensed metropolitan environment. Given its relatively large land space, the city is not as dense as many other cities in the country. Many of the world's top electronics manufacturers have at least one plant in Johor Bahru.
Due to its proximity to Singapore, Johor Bahru is frequently visited by tourists from Singapore particularly on weekends, in order to benefit from lower comparable restaurant and accommodation prices of at least 50%. Congestion at the border checkpoints is particularly heavy during long weekends or extended public holidays. Shopping and eating in the city can be a real adventure, with many shopping complexes, restaurants, cafes and a wide variety of local, Asian and Western food establishments offering from street food to fine dining. There are also plenty of spas, massage parlours, resort hotels, karaoke, night markets, pubs and nightclubs in the city. The city also houses many establishments for arts, sports, games and outdoor activities.
Johor Bahru has a good mix of Malay, Chinese and Indian cultures, with racial and religious harmony actively promoted by the Sultan of Johor. The city has been receiving large investments, particular from Chinese property developers, as part of the Iskandar Malaysia project. As result, there is massive construction all over the city. While mostly residential properties are being built, some are aiming to create man-made tourist attractions such as Danga Bay (Country Garden, Greenland) and Princess Cove (R&F). Johor Bahru is a sprawling city; its city centre is rather small for a metropolis of its size, and many of the city's best shopping areas and restaurants are in the suburbs rather than in the city centre. While the public transportation leaves much to be desired and may be too complex or inadequate for tourists in general, local inexpensive ride-hailing apps such as Grab makes the task of exploring the city much easier.

History[edit]
The city was founded in 1855 as Tanjung Puteri during the rule of Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim of the Johor Sultanate. In 1862, it was renamed as Johore Bahru when the Sultanate moved its capital there from Telok Blangah. After the independence of Malaya in 1957, Johor Bahru became the capital of Johor State and continued as such after the formation of Malaysia in 1963. Johor Bahru was declared a town in 1977, and then a city in 1994. Subsequently, with the establishment of Nusajaya, many of the state administration offices were moved to the new town. In 2020, the new city hall of Johor Bahru was established in Bukit Senyum.

Like the rest of other areas in Malaysia, Johor Bahru has an equatorial climate with consistent temperature throughout the year. It has a considerable amount of rain and high humidity. Daily average temperature ranges from 26.4 °C (79.5 °F) to 27.8 °C (82.0 °F). Although the climate is relatively uniform, it does show some seasonal variation due to the effects of monsoons. Day time can be a bit hot, thus bringing a hat, cap or umbrella may always be a good idea, because sometimes rain will also pour down unexpectedly.

Tourist offices[edit]
Johor Tourist Information Centre
The official 1.4568103.75981 Johor Tourist Information Centre at Jalan Ayer Molek (about 1 km southwest of JB Sentral) is a tiny office on the 3rd level in a sprawling white building of the same name, a 10-min walk from JB Sentral station; M-F 8AM-5PM. There are two other tourist offices located at:

Johor Bahru CIQ ('Tourist Information Centre' open daily 9AM-1PM and 2-6PM). 50 m from Sultan Iskandar Building.
JB Sentral ('Tourist Information Centre', next to the passenger waiting area on level 2 daily 9AM-6PM). You can get free brochures and maps on various destinations in West Malaysia, including free maps of JB.
Talk[edit]
Malay is the official language of the state and Malaysia, and spoken by virtually all locals. English, however, is widely used as a second language in public and for business, commercial and tourism purposes. Teochew is the main language spoken by the Chinese community, with many of them able to speak Mandarin as well, while Tamil is the main language spoken by the Indian community. Other languages from East, Southeast and South Asian countries can also be found in the city due to the significant presence of migrant workers from those countries.
Generally, most of the public commercial signs are bilingual in Malay and English. Many private establishments will also include Chinese or Tamil signs. However, road signs are mostly written in Malay only. Road names are mostly written in both the Rumi and Jawi scripts.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The most practical way for most international visitors to enter is through Singapore Changi Airport (see below).

Senai International Airport[edit]
Senai International Airport
1.642778103.6686111 Senai International Airport  (JHB  IATA) is the main airport serving Johor Bahru, located in the neighbouring town of Senai. It has several international flights from other Southeast Asian countries, and it has also domestic flights from major airports around Malaysia, including connecting flights from Malaysia's main airport Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) in Selangor, which is served by flights from major destinations around the globe.

Domestic flights are provided by:
 AirAsia, ☏ +60 85 9999. 7AM-7PM. Direct flights from Alor Setar, Bintulu, Ipoh, Kota Bharu, Kota Kinabalu, Kuala Lumpur-KLIA, Kuching, Langkawi, Miri, Penang, Sibu and Tawau.   
 Batik Air. Direct flights from Kuala Lumpur-Subang Airport.   (updated Jan 2023)
 Firefly, ☏ +60378454543, customer_care@fireflyz.com.my. 8:30AM-9:30PM. Direct flights from Kuala Lumpur-Subang Airport and Penang.   
 Malaysia Airlines. Direct flights from Kuala Lumpur-KLIA and Kuching.   
From/to Johor Bahru:
Causeway Link[dead link] operates airport express shuttle buses between the airport and JB Sentral with 12 return journeys per day. First departure from either side is at 9AM and last departure is at 8:30PM. Tickets cost RM8 one-way and the journey time is about 45 min.
There are also non-express buses from and to the airport. JB Central Line's A1 bus (Larkin Sentral: 7AM-8:30PM) and Causeway Link's 333 (Larkin Sentral: 6AM-8PM about every 1½-2 hr, one-way fare RM3.50) go between Larkin Sentral terminal and the airport. The A1 bus terminates at Senai Airport and Permas Jaya, so you can board or disembark from the bus at various points.
Taxis are available and the ride takes about 30 min. Taxis leaving from the airport operate on a voucher system; buy your voucher from the taxi desk inside the terminal (next to the car rental desks). A trip to the city centre is RM45 for up to 4 passengers.
From/to Singapore:
If you are planning to go to Senai Airport from Singapore, the cheapest option is to travel to JB Sentral (see By bus below) and then transfer to a Causeway Link Airport[dead link] (CWA) shuttle bus, or to Larkin Sentral terminal by express or non-express bus and transfer to an airport-bound bus. If you're in a hurry, you can take an ordinary Malaysian taxi for an official rate of RM45 from the taxi rank at JB Sentral, after clearing Malaysian immigration and customs. From JB to Senai takes around 30 min off peak. Buy your coupon from the counter before boarding the taxi.
Singapore Changi Airport[edit]
Singapore Changi Airport (SIN IATA) across the border in Singapore is commonly used by locals due to its better connections. The downside is that you will have to pass through customs and immigration twice, and getting to/from your destination can be a bit of a hassle as normal Singaporean taxis are not allowed to cross the border into Johor Bahru and vice versa. Transtar Travel's "cross border" coach service operates between Changi Airport Terminals 1 and 4, and JB CIQ, from which you can catch a taxi or public transport to anywhere in Johor Bahru.

By road[edit]
From other parts of Malaysia[edit]
Due to the separation of East Malaysia from Peninsular Malaysia by sea, Johor Bahru can only be accessed by road from the peninsula. JB is at the southern end of the North South Expressway, the toll highway which runs the length of Peninsular Malaysia along the West Coast. Those accessing or leaving the city can exit or enter at Jalan Skudai, Jalan Adda Utama, the Pasir Gudang Highway or Jalan Tebrau.
JB is also at the southern extremity of the Federal Route One, the main trunk roads which runs the length of Peninsular Malaysia's West Coast states. Federal Route Three or the East Coast Road links JB with the East Coast cities of Kuantan, Kuala Terengganu and Kota Bharu via Kota Tinggi and Mersing. The West Coast's coastal road can be accessed from Pontian.

From Singapore[edit]
Sultan Iskandar CIQ
Most visitors to JB arrive from Singapore via the 1.453354103.7690132 Causeway linking the two countries. By some measures the busiest border crossing in the world, the Causeway is a very popular and thus often congested entry point connecting directly into the heart of JB. The most crowded times tend to be on Fridays (especially from 9AM to noon and 3PM to 10PM) when many Singaporeans travel across the border to Malaysia for a weekend getaway and Malaysian residents travel back after the workweek.  Saturday mornings and the eve of bank holidays (or bank holiday weekends) can see the checkpoint packed too.  Sunday afternoons and evenings, as well as the last day of bank holiday weekends see the Causeway crowded in the opposite direction. The Causeway can be crossed by bus, train, taxi or car. This website provides more advice on when the best time to travel across the causeway would be.
To drive a car from Singapore to Malaysia, one must prepare the stored-value card (NETS CashCard or CEPAS Card) with sufficient funds to pay for tolls before leaving Singapore and the Touch 'n Go card when entering Johor Bahru to pay the RM20 VEP toll fee. Drivers of Singapore-registered cars must also ensure that their fuel tank is filled with ¾ of the vehicle's fuel tank when leaving Singapore. Offenders may be fined up to S$500 by Singaporean authorities, and will not be permitted to leave Singapore.
Rental agencies will frequently prohibit their cars crossing the border or may charge extra in both directions.
'Cycling across the Causeway from Singapore is possible. To do so, take the motorcycle lanes and have your exit and entry processed at the manual motorcycle counters.

By bus[edit]
Larkin Sentral Terminal, the main bus terminal for long-haul bus travel within Peninsular Malaysia.
1.4957103.74243 Larkin Sentral Terminal serves as the major long-haul bus terminal in the whole of Johor Bahru. Buses between JB and other Malaysian or Thai cities, and those between JB and Singapore will usually start and terminate here or at JB CIQ.

West Malaysia and Thailand[edit]
Direct buses between Johor Bahru and many cities and towns in West Malaysia as well as Hat Yai in Thailand arrive at Larkin Sentral Terminal. This L-shaped terminal has coach and bus ticket booths, shops, about a dozen food and beverage outlets, a market, and a left luggage office (RM2 per bag per day, 7AM-10PM).
There is a big, open-air car park in front of the bus terminal - enter from Jalan Garuda.  Several dozen bus companies run direct bus services between Larkin Sentral and various destinations in West Malaysia with services to Kuala Lumpur typically starting from just after sunrise and ending at slightly past midnight. Except during public holidays (when you should buy the ticket in advance), you can usually purchase your ticket on the day of departure or even less than an hour before the scheduled departure time. You may have to pay a hefty surcharge on top of the normal ticket price for departures on public holidays.
There are shared taxis departing from Larkin Sentral terminal to various destinations (only as far as Genting Highlands) in West Malaysia. The fare per person for the shared taxis is at least three times the coach fare per person for the further destinations. The shared taxis, unlike the intercity buses, do not depart at set times. They only depart when the shared taxi has reached a maximum of four passengers or if the passengers are willing to pay for the remaining seats. Shared taxi fares per person in RM: Genting Highlands 120, Kuala Lumpur 95, Kuala Lumpur International Airport 95, Malacca 65, Mersing 40, Senai International Airport 10, Kota Tinggi 10.
There are local buses connecting Larkin Sentral terminal with various parts of the city. To go from JB Sentral to Larkin Sentral, you can take the Maju bus or Transit Link's orange-red 'City Bus' (all of these do not have bus numbers - they have the word 'Larkin' prominently displayed on the front of the bus; the one-way bus fare is RM1.70 and average frequency of the Maju bus is 5-10 min). These buses stop at the bus stop opposite City Square in Jalan Wong Ah Fook and at the JB Sentral's bus bays facing Jalan Jim Quee.
To go to JB Sentral from Larkin Sentral terminal, you can take the Maju bus number 208, 224 and 227 (one-way fare RM1.70) or Transit Link's orange-red 'City Bus' (one-way fare RM1.70). Maju bus number 208, 224 and 227 go from Larkin Sentral terminal to JB Sentral en route to Masai, Pasir Gudang and Kota Tinggi respectively.

From Singapore[edit]
There are three main types of bus transport between JB and Singapore: private buses, Causeway Link[dead link] buses and SBS Transit/SMRT public buses. All buses except CW3, CW3S, CW4 and CW6 use the Causeway. Other than the immigration checkpoints, all Johor Bahru bound buses can only stop at one or two destinations in Johor Bahru, while Singapore-bound Causeway Link and Singapore-Johore Express buses can only stop at one destination in Singapore. Terminals aside, all buses make one stop each at Singapore immigration checkpoint and at Malaysian immigration checkpoint, which may mean boarding (esp. on those line buses where you can pay with an EZ-link card) a different bus. At both immigration points, you must disembark with all your luggage and pass through passport control and customs, then board the same or next bus by showing your ticket or using your EZ-link card.

The Transtar Cross Border Service TS1 minibus (24 passengers) plies between Changi Airport and Johor Bahru. The service calls at coach stands at Terminals 1, 2 and 3, and terminates at Johor Bahru CIQ. The first bus leaves Changi Airport for Johor Bahru at 8:15AM, Johor Bahru for Changi Airport at 5AM with the last departures at Changi Airport and Larkin Sentral scheduled at 11:15PM and 9PM respectively. Frequency is set at every 60 min. The bus calls at 5 stops along its route in Singapore (excluding Woodlands Checkpoint) and uses the Tampines and Seletar Expressways.
The Transtar Cross Border Service TS8 double-decker bus plies between Resorts World at Sentosa (RWS) and Johor Bahru. The bus calls at 6 stops along its route. The service terminates at Larkin Sentral, with drop off at JB CIQ. Passengers can choose to pay using their EZ-link cards or with cash. From RWS, the first bus will leave at 8AM (weekdays) or 9AM (weekends and holidays) with the last one at 12:15AM. From Larkin Sentral, the first bus departs M-F 6AM; Sa Su and public holidays 7AM. Last bus at 9:30PM. Service TS8 runs every hour.
The Advance Coach AC7 bus service runs between Yishun bus interchange in Singapore and Larkin Sentral Terminal. It makes numerous stops en route between Yishun bus interchange and the Woodlands checkpoint. The frequency is 20 to 30 minutes, 5:45AM-11:30PM (Singapore to Johor Bahru) and 5AM–11:50PM (Johor Bahru to Singapore).
The Singapore-Johore Express (SJE) runs a non-stop service between Queen Street Terminal in Singapore and Larkin Sentral Terminal from 6:30AM–1AM. At the terminals, buy tickets from the ticket counter. At Woodlands or JB checkpoints, get the ticket from the driver or the ticket seller standing beside the bus. Change will be given.
SBS Transit and SMRT public (non-express) buses provide non-express services which charge based on distance travelled, and can be paid in cash or by EZ-link card. Exact fare is required without the EZ-Link card; you will not get any change back from the driver.

Bus 160 from Jurong East Interchange (next to Jurong East MRT Station)
Bus 170 from Queen Street Terminal to Larkin Sentral Terminal
Bus 170X at Kranji MRT station
Bus 950 from Woodlands Bus Interchange to Larkin Sentral Terminal
Causeway Link[dead link] buses are bright yellow and hard to miss. Buy tickets from the ticket counter at the terminals. Boarding anywhere else will require payment to the driver with no change given. These are by far the cheapest option to cross the Johor Straits but it also causes mad rushes and queues at the checkpoints. The main CW buses are:

CW1 from Larkin Sentral to Kranji MRT station
CW2 from Larkin Sentral to Queen Street Terminal
CW5 from Johor Bahru CIQ to Newton Circus
The restriction of Malaysian-operated buses not stopping anywhere within Singapore and conversely, Singapore ones in Johor Bahru could be used to your advantage. 30 min could easily be shaved off the journey time within Singapore alone by boarding express buses CW2, CW5 or SJE when leaving Singapore from the Queen Street terminal or Newton Food Centre's car park. A little more time could be saved on the Johor Bahru side by hopping on to a Singapore-registered non-express bus (e.g. SBS 160/170, SMRT 950) once you clear Malaysian customs and immigration at the Johor Bahru CIQ, but you will have to pay a new fare as you did not start your journey in Singapore on a Singapore-registered non-express bus.
It is possible but more expensive to use the EZ-link card compared to paying in cash in Malaysian ringgit when boarding SBS 160, SBS 170 or SMRT 950 at Larkin Sentral/Johor Bahru CIQ to go anywhere in Singapore. The percentage price difference becomes greater the further you go into Singapore. For example, it costs S$1.90 using the EZ-link card to go from Larkin Sentral terminal to Queen Street terminal by SBS 170. This is slightly more than 100% more expensive than by paying in cash (RM2.20). It is also cheaper to pay in ringgit when travelling from the Woodlands Checkpoint to the Johor Bahru CIQ by the Singapore-Johore Express bus. Conversely, it can be cheaper using the EZ-link card for both the bus and MRT train if one has the intention to connect to the MRT train at Kranji, Marsiling or Woodlands MRT stations, due to Singapore's Distance Fare pricing policy.

By taxi[edit]
From other parts of Malaysia[edit]
Johor Bahru can be easily accessed from other parts of Johor Bahru District, such as the neighboring Iskandar Puteri or Pasir Gudang with a relatively cheap price due to its extensive highway networks. If coming from other states in Peninsular Malaysia, it is still usually acceptable although the price will be much more expensive. Taking a taxi from Kuala Lumpur International Airport to the city is also generally still acceptable.

From Singapore[edit]
For any transportation between Johor Bahru and Singapore, only specially licensed taxis are allowed to operate across the border. The rules seem baffling at first, but boil down to this: Malaysian taxis are only allowed to go to the designated terminal in Singapore, and Singaporean taxis are only allowed to go to their terminal in Johor Bahru.
The "basic" direct taxi service from the Singapore Taxi Terminal at Queen Street (in Bugis) to the Larkin Sentral Terminal costs S$15 per person or S$60 per car departing from Singapore, and RM15/60 from Johor Bahru. The main advantage of a taxi is that you don't need to lug your stuff (or yourself) through customs at both ends; you can just sit in the car. This service is also available 24 hours a day.
If you want to take a taxi from Queen Street to somewhere other than the terminal in Johor Bahru, you have to use a Malaysian (yellow) taxi, and the price will be at least S$80 (depending on distance). Likewise, if you want to take a taxi from Larkin Sentral to anywhere in Singapore, you need to use a Singaporean taxi and pay at least RM120 for the service.
Taxis can also be booked to bring you from anywhere in Singapore to Larkin Sentral, or from anywhere in Johor Bahru to Queen Street ☏ +65 6296 7054 (Singapore) or ☏ +60 7 224-6986 (Johor Bahru), and be sure to get the taxi's number, driver's name and his phone number.
Private limousine car services offer point-to-point services from anywhere in Singapore to anywhere in Johor Bahru, but these exist in a legal grey zone. The standard fare is start from $100 for Singapore to Johor Bahru with 7 seater Mpv Car (Toyota Innova / Toyota Alphard). Unlike normal cabs, they can also use the Second Link, which makes them by far the fastest way of getting to western parts of Johor.
Alternatively, you can arrange a 2-taxi ride through the call centre, whereby once across the Causeway, you swap taxis.

By train[edit]
Johor Bahru Sentral Railway Station
Kempas Baru Railway Station
Entering Johor Bahru by train, you can stop at either the 1.4629103.76454 JB Sentral or 1.53567103.7217275 Kempas Baru Station, the two railway stations of the city.
JB Sentral station is the southern most railway station in Malaysia. It is located along Jalan Tun Abdul Razak and Jalan Jim Quee. It is connected to the CIQ, Johor Bahru City Square, KOMTAR JBCC and R&F Mall by pedestrian overhead bridges. There are retail outlets (including a 24-hr 7-Eleven store), food and beverage outlets. There are coin-operated (2 x 50 sen), small left luggage lockers, a Muslim prayer room, toilets, a police post and a tourist information booth in here as well.
Kempas Baru station is located along Jalan Permatang Utama. It has some limited shops and car parks. For those who wish to explore the northern part of Johor Bahru, this railway station is located closer to the region.
There are three pairs of shuttle trains a day from Gemas to connect to the ETS network north of Gemas all the way to Padang Besar in Perlis. Tickets for each train are sold separately; for example, when going to Kuala Lumpur from Johor Bahru, tickets are sold as JB Sentral-Gemas on the shuttle and Gemas-KL Sentral on the ETS. There is also a nightly express train that runs through the East Coast Jungle Line to Tumpat.

From Singapore[edit]
Given the long queues for road travellers, crossing the border by train can be a more convenient and less time-consuming alternative. The Johor Bahru-Singapore stretch is served by the Shuttle Tebrau shuttle train. The train station in Singapore is at Woodlands Train Checkpoint, which is 700 m from the start of the causeway. There are 14 departures per day from Woodlands and 17 per day from JB Sentral. Shuttle trains will leave Woodlands for JB Sentral at 7:20AM, 8:30AM, 9:40AM, 10:50AM, 12:20PM, 1:50PM, 3:20PM, 4:30PM, 5:40PM, 6:50PM, 8PM, 9:10PM, 10:20PM, 11:30PM and leave JB Sentral for Woodlands at 5AM, 5:25AM, 5:55AM, 6:20AM, 7:30AM, 8:40AM, 9:50AM, 11:20AM, 12:50PM, 2:20PM, 3:30PM, 4:40PM, 5:50PM, 7PM, 8:10PM, 9:20PM, 10:30PM. When you depart from Singapore by train, you get stamped out by Singapore immigration first inside the Woodlands Train Checkpoint, and just across the hallway, Malaysian immigration stamps you in before you board the KTM train. In the reverse direction, Malaysia immigration stamps you out before boarding the train at JB Sentral, and upon the train reaching Woodlands Train Checkpoint, you disembark and Singapore immigration stamps you in. Gate opens 30 minutes before departure and closes 10 minutes before departure.
Tickets from JB to Singapore are RM5 and tickets from Singapore to JB are S$5. While this is several times more expensive than the bus (though much cheaper still than taxi or rental car), the trains are the only way to completely avoid traffic jams, meaning that at popular times tickets can sell out days in advance. It's thus wise to use KTM's website or Easybook.com to buy tickets in advance, with a purchase window of up to several months to 15 minutes before departure if still available. If there are any spare seats, you can also buy tickets at the station counters but don't count on this always being available.
For JB Sentral-Woodlands, at JB Sentral there are turnstiles installed at the departure gate (Gate A); scan the barcode or QR code on your ticket (can be one stored on a mobile device) to activate the turnstile. For Woodlands-JB Sentral, tickets bought online must be exchanged at the KTMB ticket counter before departure.
The nearest MRT station (1.5 km or 15 min walk) to the KTM Woodlands Train Checkpoint is Marsiling MRT station on the North-South Line. SMRT bus number 856 goes from Marsiling MRT station to Woodlands Train Checkpoint, while SMRT bus number 950 serves the reverse direction. The last full-service southbound train leaves Marsiling MRT station for Marina Bay at 11:12PM, though there are later MRT services that end at Toa Payoh or Ang Mo Kio. In the other direction, the last train leaves for Jurong East MRT station at 12:38AM. Although Marsiling MRT station is the nearest, more buses go between Woodlands MRT station and Woodlands Train Checkpoint. From Woodlands MRT station, take SMRT buses 911, 912 (longer route), 913 or 856 to Woodlands Train Checkpoint. In the reverse direction, take SMRT buses 911, 912 (longer route), 913, 903 (longer route) or 178.

By taxi[edit]
Taxi stand in Johor Bahru.
Taxi prices in Johor Bahru are fairly affordable. However, always either use taxis only with meters or ask for a price estimate before proceeding with your journey; there remains a possibility of being fleeced by some unscrupulous taxi driver touts. The starting fare is RM3 for the first 2 km and the fare increases by 10 cent for every subsequent 115 m. You will only be charged for waiting time in excess of 3 min during the journey - the rate is 10 cent for every 21 seconds. Additional charges include: actual road toll charges; RM2 for telephone bookings; a 50% surcharge is levied between midnight and 6AM. There are no additional charges for a 3rd adult passenger or baggage kept in the trunk. Almost all of major shopping malls and high-star hotels in Johor Bahru feature taxi stands in front or around them.

By bus[edit]
Public buses in Johor Bahru.
If you wish to explore Johor Bahru by bus, the main bus terminals of the city are Larkin Sentral, 1.4629103.76457 JB Sentral, 1.543222103.798758 Taman Johor Jaya and 1.598103.8225569 Ulu Tiram. From these terminals, buses going to almost major suburbs of Johor Bahru as well as Iskandar Puteri and Pasir Gudang can be found. The destination also serves up until Pontian Kechil, Ayer Hitam and Kota Tinggi in the neighboring districts of Johor Bahru. The last buses leave JB Sentral for their respective destinations at about 11PM or earlier; the last buses returning to JB Sentral leave their starting points at about 10PM or earlier. Before boarding any bus, look at the destination boards on the bus and do not hesitate to ask the bus driver directly. The frequency of the buses is inconsistent and are not regularly scheduled (especially for the buses that do not leave from the bus terminals), as buses often wait either for a sufficient number of passengers boarding at the terminal before beginning their outward journey, or are forced to drive off because of overcrowding and frequent honking at the bus terminal. There are generally more buses in the morning and there are fewer buses as it gets later into the day. Pay more attention to the people waiting at the bus stops rather than the buses on the road, as buses (particularly publicly-owned buses such as the white and yellow-roofed “MyBAS”/Causeway Link or red-white and blue-roofed “PAJ”/Maju Holding buses) may not pick-up passengers from designated bus stops. However, the privately-owned white-grey and orange-roofed “City Bus” is more receptive at picking up and dropping off passengers at both designated bus stops and undesignated parts of the road, as their drivers do not collect a salary but instead have to generate income from fare collection after paying a daily lease to the bus owner.

JB Sentral to Larkin Sentral[edit]
If you are planning to go from JB Sentral bus terminal to Larkin Sentral terminal or vice versa, you may take any of the frequent, non-stop buses that terminate at Larkin Sentral. For those who recently cleared Malaysian immigration, they may walk straight to the post-immigration bus bays downstairs at the JB CIQ Complex. These bus bays are also accessible by walking along the slip road that links the CIQ with Jalan Lingkaran Dalam. Fares from JB Sentral to Larkin Sentral: CW1, CW2 and CWL RM1.20, SBS 170 RM1.50 (payable by EZ-link card - S$1.11), Singapore-Johore Express RM1.00. These fares are payable only under the following circumstances - a. You fail to board the SBS 170 bus within 45 minutes of alighting from the SBS 160, SBS 170 or SMRT 950 bus. b. You did not buy a valid, through ticket to Larkin Sentral while in Singapore. c. You had travelled on a bus of a different bus company from Singapore to Johor Bahru CIQ (e.g. Woodland Checkpoint to JB CIQ by CW1 or CW2, then JB CIQ to Larkin Sentral by Singapore-Johore Express or SBS 170, or vice versa). The trip should take about 8-10 min in the absence of heavy traffic.
However, if you have left the JB CIQ complex and proceeded to walk towards the city centre area, you can consider taking the local buses such as MyBAS, PAJ or ‘City Bus’ at the JB Sentral bus bays (facing Jalan Jim Quee), which is located downstairs and separated outside from the main concourse area by a roadway. Buses heading there would usually have the word 'Larkin' displayed on the front of the bus; the one-way bus fare is RM1.70) to Larkin Sentral terminal.

By ride hailing services[edit]
Local ride hailing service app Grab is affordable and very popular in JB, and is likely the most hassle-free way for visitors to get around without a car, if they have a mobile Internet connection. Many commercial establishments have also dedicated waiting areas for e-hailing vehicles. Nevertheless, due to the recent more stringent laws pertaining ride-sharing apps, do allocate more time before you make any vehicle booking because it might take slightly longer time to get one, especially in less-crowded places. Most people in Johor Bahru speak or understand English, communication would be less of a problem.

Sleep[edit]
There is plenty of accommodation in Johor Bahru to suit all budgets. The cost of a double room in a budget hotel right in the city centre (i.e. around Jalan Meldrum, between Jalan Tun Abdul Razak and Jalan Wong Ah Fook near City Square) starts from RM50 net per room per night. In general, the budget hotels outside the city centre are cheaper and most of them are located within shop lots areas. Backpacker hostels with dormitories (dorms) are not as commonly found in Johor Bahru as in Malacca, Kuala Lumpur and George Town. For short term stay, the city offers many choices of accommodation from Airbnb's platform. For non-Malaysians, rooms are generally quoted without the tourism taxes, in which you still need to pay upon check-in, which costs RM10 per room per night.

Stay safe[edit]
Johor Bahru has somewhat developed a reputation for crime, due in part to sensationalised reports by some foreign media of crimes committed against their citizens; the proximity to super safe Singapore doesn't help perceptions. Although Johor Bahru's crime rate is generally higher than elsewhere in Malaysia, by taking appropriate safety precautions, you can ensure your stay, like those of the vast majority of visitors, will be an incident-free one.

Do not carry a handbag when walking around town. Snatch thieves have been known to snatch handbags away while their victims are walking on the street, using a motorcycle. If they do manage to grab your handbag, let them have it as some snatch thieves are known to drag their victims along the road with their motorbikes until they release their grip, almost certainly resulting in severe injuries.
Keep your passport safe and close to you because it is a highly prized valuable to robbers.
Lock the car door immediately or as soon as you get into the car.
Avoid walking around the city alone. You should walk around the city in groups of preferably 3 or more for safety.
Only go to areas with good security such as malls and private clubs at night.
If you are robbed, you are advised to give up most, if not all, of your valuables to avoid putting your personal safety in jeopardy.
As a rule of thumb, the general hawker food scene in Johor Bahru is hygienic though certain areas are less so. So keep an eye out for those dirty hawkers who pay very little attention to hygiene.

Cope[edit]
Water[edit]
Tap water should be boiled before drinking. Nevertheless, bottled water is widely available at a cheap price in almost all eateries, shops, and convenience stores.

Connect[edit]
Internet[edit]
Generally many of the eating establishments in the city will have free Wi-Fi connection for Internet access and almost all of accommodations will have one.
