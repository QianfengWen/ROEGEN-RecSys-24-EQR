Majuro is the largest city and capital of the Marshall Islands. The downtown area is north of the airport on the eastern side of the main island. It consists of the smaller towns Delap, Uliga and Darrit which are reside on islands linked by small stretches of land.


Understand[edit]
Founded as a trading post by the Germans in 1884, when the Marshall Islands became an independent country about a century later, Majuro became the national capital. The Majuro atoll is sometimes referred to as D-U-D, after the villages of Delap, Uliga, and Djarrit that are the major population centers.
With its port and airport, it is an important entrance point to the Marshall Islands. Don't expect a too many attractions in Majuro city itself; buildings are generally residential, industrial or commercial, though there are beaches and other islands nearby.

Get in[edit]
Map of Majuro
By boat[edit]
A 7.1062171.37241 boat dock is on the lagoon side of Uliga.

By plane[edit]
7.06498171.272032 Amata Kabua International Airport (MAJ  IATA), Lagoon Rd (on the south side of the Majuro atoll). United Airlines has thrice-weekly service from Honolulu as the first stop on its "island hopper" route which also serves the Federated States of Micronesia and Guam. Flights from Guam via FSM and Kwajalein are available on the remaining weekdays. The island hopper flight stops at various atolls on the way to/from Guam makes for a scenic way to the destination.   
Hotel transfers are usually available for free upon reservation. Taxis from the airport to town are cheap as well (around US$5) and it is customary to pick up additional passengers on the way.

Get around[edit]
There is only one road in Majuro. If you are on a walk far away from the city center, police and other people will often give you a ride if they are going in the same direction.

By foot[edit]
The island can be explored by foot. The only exception to this is Laura Beach. Packs of feral dogs roaming inhabited parts of Majuro remain an occasional danger. If you are walking or running, be alert as these dogs attack without provocation. Walkers and runners should always carry a stout rod or similar and several rocks for use in thwarting marauding dogs.

By taxi[edit]
Taxis are cheap as long you stay east of the airport. To further reduce costs cab sharing is common.

By bus[edit]
Getting to Laura Beach by taxi is expensive, but buses make the round trip to Laura 6 days a week (not on Sundays) for $2, departing from the RRE parking lot.

By thumb[edit]
Hitchhiking is widely practiced and quite safe.

By car[edit]
Road system on the atoll
Rental cars cost $60 per day. None of the large commercial rental agencies operate on the island. Hotel Robert Reimers has about a dozen cars available. The island has four gas stations. Ace's One Stop and Riwut Corner in town, another is just before the bridge dividing Delap from Long Island, and the fourth is just past the airport heading toward Laura.

Eat[edit]
Restaurants tend to go through phases in Majuro. No place is consistent for more than a few months. If a restaurant is really good one week, it may be completely awful the next. An always changing workforce contributes greatly to this phenomenon as does the availability of ingredients. Asking around about which places are good to eat can help greatly.
