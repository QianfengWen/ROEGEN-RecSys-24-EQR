Edgewater is a town in southeastern Volusia County, adjacent to New Smyrna Beach.


Understand[edit]
Edgewater City Hall
Edgewater is primarily residential, with access to the Intracoastal Waterway. There are a number of stores along US-1, which is the main road in the town. It is immediately south of New Smyrna, and there is no physical boundary between mainland NSB and Edgewater.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
US-1 enters from the north and south, entering from New Smyrna Beach to the north, curving past the quarry and the New Smyrna Beach library and entering Edgewater with no discontinuity in development. From the west, FL-442 connects I-95 to US-1 and meets in the commercial part of Edgewater. Oak Hill can be accessed by traveling south on US-1 from Edgewater.
There is no bridge from the coast to the mainland at this point, as the waterway and coexisting wetlands are wide. It is necessary to follow A1A from the beach to the South Causeway, and then approach Edgewater from the north. The New Smyrna junction between A1A and US-1 is incomplete, so it's best to go via a surface street to navigate from A1A to US-1 in order to head south from NSB to Edgewater.

By public transit[edit]
According to VoTran's website, Route 41 (the "Edgewater" Route) follows US-1 south from New Smyrna Beach through Edgewater to Oak Hill, and passes some residential areas of Edgewater as well, making it one of the more comprehensive public transit networks in the region.

Get around[edit]

US-1, in addition to being a route via which you enter the area, is also the main artery through it, and many businesses are alongside the Edgewater portion. The southern side of US-1, toward the Canaveral area, is more rural with higher speed. US-1 is a few hundred yards inland from the Intracoastal Waterway and a number of surface streets lead from US-1 to the waterway. FL-442 goes inland from US-1 to I-95, a north-south route that runs parallel to US-1 a few miles to the west. I-95 is just outside of Edgewater, and is well outside the Oak Hill settlement.
