Map of Kiuruvesi

Understand[edit]
In 1865, Kiuruvesi became an independent parish, and a year later, the first church in the town was built. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Kiuruvesi developed as a regional center for trade and commerce, with several new businesses and factories being established in the area.
In the early 20th century, Kiuruvesi experienced significant growth and development, as new transportation links and infrastructure were built. The electrification of the area in the 1920s paved the way for new industries and businesses to be established.
After the war, the town continued to grow and modernize, with the establishment of several new industries, including agriculture, forestry, and manufacturing.
