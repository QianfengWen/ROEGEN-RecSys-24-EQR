Understand[edit]
Peenemünde was the birthplace of the infamous V-1 flying bomb and V-2 rocket during World War II in Europe. The V stands for Vergeltungswaffe (retaliation weapon) the propaganda-term the Nazis used for their technological last ditch efforts at turning the tide in the waning moments of the lost war. They were developed, tested and launched from here during WW2 and the site was heavily bombed by Allied forces. Not much is left of the factories, but the power plant, some rockets and a bunker remain for visitors. After the war Peenemünde was used as an East German military base; consequently there is also a lot of East German military equipment on exhibit.
