Denbigh and Denbigh Lake
Addington Highlands is a township of about 2,500 people (2021) in Quinte-Northumberland.


Understand[edit]
This article covers a broad, sparsely-populated rural area in the "Land O Lakes" region of southeastern Ontario.
Addington Highlands includes the tiny villages Denbigh, Flinton, Kaladar, and Northbrook and part of the village of Cloyne. The remainder of Cloyne is in North Frontenac (pop 2000), which is just as rural (with a few tiny villages such as Plevna and Ompah).
This area was first settled by Europeans following the construction of the Addington Road in 1857. 

Get in[edit]
Highway 7 travels east-west through Kaladar.  This portion of Highway 7 is part of a branch of the Trans-Canada Highway that passes through the area, traveling between Sudbury and Kanata (near Ottawa) on Highway 69 and 400, then Highway 12, then Highway 7, then Highway 417.
Highway 41, running north to south between Pembroke and Napanee, is the main road to and from the township.

Get around[edit]
Driving is easiest and only way to get around. Roads in the area during the winter can be treacherous.

Astronomy is a popular reason to stay out after dark in the highlands. The township's rural landscape and distance from cities and major development provide some of the darkest skies in southern Ontario, and the adjacent township, North Frontenac, was the first municipality in Canada to be declared a "dark sky preserve". Two viewing areas are open to the public:
