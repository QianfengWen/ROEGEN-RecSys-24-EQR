Stein, also referred to as "Stein bei Nürnberg", is a city in Franconia in the county of Fürth. It borders Nuremberg to the south. Stein had about 14,000 inhabitants in 2019.


Understand[edit]
Stein's high street
Stein is home to world-famous pencils. Since Medieval times, several pencil mills have given rise to the current pencil industry. Faber Castell has its company headquarters in Stein, though most of the manufacturing is now done in Brazil.

Get in[edit]
While an extension of Nuremberg U2 (metro) towards downtown Stein was a part of the original 1960s and 70s plans for the U-Bahn and repeatedly talked about since, empty municipal coffers and fears on the part of the city of Stein about running costs outstripping the yearly budget have kept those a pipe dream for the last decades. As such you will have to change to a bus for public transit access to most points of interest.

By public transit[edit]
Buses and local trains are part of the VGN[dead link] Verkehrsverbund. The train station 49.4255511.0180641 Nürnberg-Stein is not really close to downtown (in fact it is not even inside the municipal boundaries). The easiest way to get in from Nürnberg is to take U-Bahn U2 to Röthenbach and change to the busses from there.

By plane[edit]
From Nuremberg Airport (NUE IATA) take the U-Bahn U2 to 49.42083311.0316672 Röthenbach and bus number 63 or 64 from there.
