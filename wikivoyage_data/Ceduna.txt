Totem One obelisk, a monument to the Emu Field nuclear weapons tests.
Ceduna is one of the closest settlements to -28.69826132.371621 Emu Field , an extremely remote RAAF nuclear weapons test site where the British government conducted a pair of test explosions in 1953. There is a concrete obelisk at the location, ca. 500 km northeast of Ceduna, which can be visited with RAAF permission. Visitors may find souvenirs in the form of vitrified sand, and the concentric blast rings are still visible. The only way to reach the site is by private transport (car, taxi) which takes circa 15 hours.
