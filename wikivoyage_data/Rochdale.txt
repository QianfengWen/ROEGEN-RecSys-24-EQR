Rochdale is a town in Greater Manchester in the North West of England. Its Victorian era town hall is widely recognized as being one of the finest municipal buildings in the country.


Understand[edit]
Rochdale Town Centre
Richdale sits 12 miles north of Manchester city centre. In 2021 it had a population of 111,000, with a similar number in the nearby small towns of Middleton, Milnrow, Wardle, Littleborough and Heywood that with it comprise Rochdale Metropolitan Borough.

History[edit]
Rochdale grew up from the 18th century as a textile town and transport hub: the Rochdale canal, completed in 1807, was the surest way to transport goods across the Pennines, a huge improvement on pack horses struggling over rough tracks. The textile trade collapsed in the 20th century and Rochdale, historically part of Lancashire, became part of Greater Manchester during the 1974 reorganisation. Rochdale is best known as the birthplace of the Co-operative Movement in 1844, of the singer Gracie Fields (1898-1979) and (infamously it must now be said) of the politician Sir Cyril Smith (1928-2010). The poet Byron's title was Lord Byron of Rochdale but he had no link to the town.

Locsl information[edit]

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Manchester Airport (MAN IATA) has frequent trains to central Manchester. Pick a train that continues beyond Piccadilly to Victoria, where you change for the train or tram to Rochdale as below. You can ride the tram all the way from the airport and change trams at Deansgate, but that's much slower for scant fare saving.

By train[edit]
53.61-2.1541 Rochdale railway station, half a mile south of town centre, has trains from Manchester Victoria every 5-10 min, taking 15-20 min. These trains are part of longer mainline routes:

- from Blackburn via Accrington, Burnley, Todmorden, Littleborough, Rochdale, Victoria, Salford and Atherton to Wigan.
- from Leeds via Bradford, Halifax, Hebden Bridge, Todmorden and Rochdale to Victoria; also from Leeds to Wigan, and to Warrington and Chester.
- from Clitheroe via Whalley, Blackburn, Darwen, Bolton, Salford and Victoria to Rochdale.
Metrolink trams (pink line) take 30 min from Manchester Victoria via Newton Heath, South Chadderton, Oldham, Shaw and Milnrow to Rochdale railway station and the 53.617-2.1552 Interchange. Rochdale is in Fare Zone 4 so a single journey from city centre is £4.60; trams run every 15 min 6AM-midnight. (The grey line only runs as far as Oldham.) Westbound, the line runs through Victoria to St Peters Square, Deansgate, Chorlton and East Didsbury. Change in city centre for the other lines to Bury, to Piccadilly station, Etihad stadium and Ashton-under-Lyne, to Wythenshawe and the airport, to Imperial War Museum and Trafford Centre, to Old Trafford, Stretford, Sale and Altrincham, and to Salford Quays and Eccles.

By bus[edit]
National Express Bus NX 540 runs twice a day from London Victoria to Rochdale Interchange, taking 7 hours. This bus also calls at the airport, Manchester city centre and Oldham but you can't use it for the short ride from there to Rochdale.
Local buses run to the Interchange every ten min on route 17 from Manchester Shudehill via Middleton and Castleton, taking 70 min. They also run here from:

- Ashton-under-Lyne (Bus 409 every 15 min) via Waterloo, Hathershaw, Oldham, Royton, Balderstone and Stoneyfield.
- Bolton (Bus 471 every 10 min) via Breightmet, Bradley Fold, Seddon's Farm Estate, Bury and Heywood.
- Halifax (Bus X58 every 70 min) via Sowerby Bridge, Ripponden and Littleborough.
- Todmorden (Bus 589 hourly) via Walsden, Littleborough, Dearnsley and Haworth Cross. Change in Todmorden for Burnley.
By car[edit]
The usual approach is along A627(M), the motorway spur from M62. To the south this leads into Oldham, where you can use A663 through Chadderton to short-cut to M60.

53.630618-2.0964156 Hollingworth Lake is 3 miles northeast of town, near Smithybridge. It's got walks, water activities, and a couple of lakeside pubs. It was built in 1800 as a feeder reservoir for the Rochdale Canal, using high embankments on three sides as the site was not a natural hollow. In the 1840s when the railway arrived it became a tourist resort, dubbed the Weighver's Seaport, with hotels, pubs, pleasure steamers, more pubs, and scandalous dancing. Captain Webb trained in the lake waters before making the first cross-Channel swim in 1875. Both tourism and canal traffic declined in the 20th century but the lake remains in use as a reservoir for the canal.
Smithy Bridge, Littleborough and Summit are three small villages along the valley, with public transport and access to the canal towpath. After Summit the canal descends towards Todmorden. Alongside, the Leeds-Manchester railway plunges into the 53.683889-2.0919447 Summit Tunnel. When opened in 1841, it was the world's longest railway tunnel, at 2885 yards (2638 m). In Dec 1984 a trainload of petrol derailed in the tunnel and caused a fire that raged for days and vitrified the walls, but no lives were lost.

Rochdale Canal runs for 32 miles from Manchester via Rochdale and over the hills to Sowerby Bridge in the Calder valley. This is a broad canal, handling vessels up to 14 ft (4.3 m) width, and during the early 19th century it was the main cargo route between Lancashire and Yorkshire. It closed in 1952 but was fully re-opened in 2002, with a firm towpath. There are no long tunnels, hence it could be wider and handle more traffic than the narrow canal further south above Oldham, but it had to climb higher to surmount the Pennines, with more locks and demand for water. A6033 runs alongside from Littleborough to Todmorden, then A646 down past Sowerby Bridge, so there are multiple access points.
The Pennine Way follows the crest of the ridge bordering Yorkshire. From the south the route approaches over Saddleworth and Wessenden Head Moors, then follows 53.65-2.0333332 Blackstone Edge  with road access from A627 next to jcn 22 of M62, and from A58 above Littleborough. West is the scarp rising steeply from Rochdale, east is a lonely "dip" or plateau expanse of heath and bog.
