Tullow is a small market town in County Carlow where N81 crosses the River Slaney. This was the main road between Dublin and Wexford until M11 was built along the coast. But Tullow (An Tulach, "The Mound") held little strategic value, with no castles, town walls or battlefields, though it was on the fringes of the 1798 rebellion of United Irishmen. It remains a quiet place, with a population in about 5100, and is within commuting range of Dublin. The oil and gas exploration company Tullow Oil was founded here in 1985.

Father John Murphy (1753-1798) is commemorated by a statue in the Square. He was a middling sort of parish priest until in the 1798 rebellion of United Irishmen, he displayed an unexpected talent for military leadership. The rebellion was strongest in County Wexford: see that page for more of the story. Murphy was among those who escaped from the last stand on Vinegar Hill, Enniscorthy through a gap in the encircling forces. His little band tried to fight on, but Murphy was captured near Tullow, tortured and put to death. He's buried at Ferns near Enniscorthy.

The mansion may be 16th century but was made-over in the 1840s; it's not open to tour. You come for the extensive riverside gardens, described as "Robinsonian": William Robinson (1838-1935) opposed the stiff formal Victorian look, and championed cottage and "wild" gardens with native species in natural places. He'd have to avert his eyes from the masses of rhododendron and the Giant Redwood planted after the victory at Waterloo. Free, €2 car parking.  (updated Jul 2021)

A 19th century turbine down by the river supplied the house with electricity. The basement has become the global headquarters of "The Fellowship of Isis", founded in 1976 at the dawning of the Age of Aquarius, the Age of Aquarius, A-quar-i-us! It aims to, um, "help the Goddess actively in the manifestation of Her divine plan" and apparently this is coming along nicely. Adult €12, conc €11, child €6.  (updated Jul 2021)

52.9389-6.71216 Baltinglass  has a striking ruined abbey, and the Rathcoran passage grave and hill fort. It's 10 km north along N81 in County Wicklow, but the south end of that county is short of accommodation and other visitor facilities so Tullow makes a better base.

The Wicklow Way is a 131-km hiking trail that reaches its south terminus at Clonegal. It's usually done from Dublin southwards over 5-7 days, but please yourself. The last 40 km from Moyne to Clonegal is through lowland fields and doesn't have the upland scenery, yet feels more away-from-it-all as it's further from the city and the big-name tourist areas.
