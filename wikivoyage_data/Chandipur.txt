By road[edit]
If you want to drive down to Chandipur from Kolkata (Calcutta) - the directions are as follows:

Take the Second Hooghly Bridge
Follow Kona Expressway (4-Lane road)
At the Bombay Road crossing - take a left.
Follow Bombay Road (4-Lane road)
You may break at the A1 Plaza inside the Reliance petrol station. It would be to your left - a 30-40 minute ride from the Kona Expressway - Bombay Road junction (Avoid the Azad Hind Dhaba - it is no longer up to the mark)
Keep straight until you cross the Rupnarayan river (the bridge is one way and the river is wide)
After you cross the river you will see the Kolaghat Thermal Power Station to your left
Immediately after the Power Station is a junction (Haldia junction)– go straight. (left goes to Haldia)
Kharagpur Junction. Go straight towards NH 60 (4-lane concrete road - careful of the turn you take)
NH 60 after Kharagpur is peaceful compared to NH 5. Very few buses and trucks and road is bordered by paddy fields stretching to the horizon. This is an amazing road - but careful they are constructing speedbreakers on the road now.
A toll is charged at Jaleswar border (₹40 for cars), but no entry tax (as of 2011)
Before reaching Jaleswar town, you'll find that the new 4-lane NH-60 stretch is under construction.
Basleshwar (Balasore) town. Traffic congestion. Take a left turn under overhead bridge.
Go straight. You'll reach the bus stand. Cross the flyover after it and take a right turn immediately after crossing the flyover.
Take a right turn in the next junction
Go straight till you reach a Police point. There is a Cinema hall just behind it. Take right turn and go straight till the road meets another road.
Take left turn and go straight.
Around 10 km off, you'll see some signboards of various hotels in Chandipur-on-sea. Take left turn and go straight. This is easy to miss - try not to go into the Integrated Test Launch Zone.  You're there!
From the flyover mentioned above, we do not agree with the route : the flyover lands into a roundabout. Take a left from there and you will be guided to Chandipur. We travelled on 19th Sep 2009 and found the road nearing Balasore is still under construction. Also, roads within Balasore are narrow and has a lot of rush.

You can also get an OTDC tour bus from Chandipur, that goes to the nearby temples in the area.

See[edit]
Movement of the sea – it recedes 5 km with low tide and comes back all the way with high tide.
Do[edit]
If you are tired of the sea, move around. Go to Balasore and nearby places.

Buy[edit]
There is always something to buy. Nothing special here. But
you can buy delicious sweets here. Items of clothing are cheap compared to other cities nearby.

Eat[edit]
Prawns are very cheap. You can have a delicious prawn item at Anandamayee Hotel or Panthanibas or elsewhere. However, as sea prawns sometimes cause allergic reactions, be careful.

Drink[edit]
Green coconuts recommended. However, if one is fussy about hard drinks, it is safer to carry it.
While going from Chandipur towards Balasore, just where the road to ITR splits off, there is a small shack with some of the best sweets in that area. The Road distance between Chandipur to Balasore is 12 kilometres and it will take 23 minutes to reach there.

 Panthanibas, ☏ +91 6782 270 051, otdc@ortelm.net.in. Run by the Odisha Tourism Development Corporation Ltd. The location is its biggest selling point.
