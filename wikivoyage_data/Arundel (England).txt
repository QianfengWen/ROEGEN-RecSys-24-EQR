Arundel is a town in West Sussex in southeast England, with a population in 2021 of about 3500. Its main attraction is the medieval castle. 


Understand[edit]
Arundel Castle
Harhunedell is Old English for "valley of the horehound", the common mint plant. (The "hore" refers to its hoar-frosted appearance, not its breeding habits.) But this became garbled with arondelle the old French word for a swallow (nowadays hirondelle), and these appear on the town crest. The large bird on the town hall originally perched on the Swallow Brewery, long closed. According to the Domesday Book of 1086, the town had four burgesses, a mill and fishery, and the whole lot was worth £27. 
Arundel is at the foot of the South Downs where the River Arun flows out, and until 1908 it had the lowest bridge on the river. The valley also created a route north through the Downs. So it was an obvious defensive position and there was already a castle by the early 11th century, which the Normans strengthened. The river is tidal for 25 miles and Arundel was a port until superseded by Littlehampton on the coast in the 19th century. Victorian industry largely passed the town by so its old centre was preserved, while the castle was re-fashioned into what the Middle Ages ought to have created if only they'd had makeover specialists and interior design consultants. It's nowadays the town's chief attraction.

An Arundel Tomb
This poem by Philip Larkin (1922-85) describes a tomb in Chichester cathedral where recumbent effigies clasp hands, probably the 10th Earl of Arundel and his second wife. "The stone fidelity they hardly meant has come to be their final blazon . . " It's often cited as showing the enduring power of love, but as Larkin wrote on the manuscript, "Love isn't stronger than death just because statues hold hands for six hundred years".
