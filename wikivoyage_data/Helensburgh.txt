Helensburgh is a town in Argyll and Bute, on the north bank of the River Clyde 30 miles west of Glasgow, at the opening of Gare Loch. It developed from the 19th century once ferries and the railway connected it to Glasgow: wealthy business people built their villas here, and made sure to keep heavy industry away from their bosky avenues. The star attraction is Hill House built in 1902. In 2021 the population of Helensburgh and associated small towns was 13,320. 
Rhu is further west along the coast of Gare Loch. Faslane five miles up the loch is dominated by HMNB Clyde, base for the UK's submarine fleet, so it's a major part of the local economy but doesn't do much for the scenery. Garelochead a little further north was a resort but has become blighted by industry.

Lamp in The Hill House

Understand[edit]
Helensburgh was small until the 19th century because its harbour was shallow and exposed to westerly winds. Then Henry Bell developed a steam paddle boat of shallow draught that could sail against the wind, and Helensburgh developed as a seaside resort: Glasgow folk came “doon the watter” to enjoy the sea air and throng the pubs. This was further boosted by the arrival of the railway in 1858. In the 20th century people found better places to take their holidays, but Helensburgh became a commuter town. Charles Rennie Mackintosh designed the stylish Hill House here which is nowadays the main reason to visit. John Logie Baird (1888-1946) one of the main inventors of television was born and grew up here, and prime minister Andrew Bonar Law (1858-1923) spent his teens here.

By train[edit]
56.0039-4.73161 Helensburgh Central has trains every 30 min from Glasgow Queen Street (Low Level), taking 45 min via Dumbarton. These trains come from Edinburgh, along a slow and far-from-scenic route across industrial central Scotland; from Edinburgh use the fast trains and change at Queen Street. Central Station has a staffed ticket office and machines, toilets and a waiting room. There is step-free access to the terminus platform. 
56.0125-4.73062 Helensburgh Upper is on the West Highland Line from Glasgow Queen Street to Crianlarich, where trains divide for Oban, Fort William and Mallaig, for ferries to the Hebrides. Trains run every couple of hours M-Sa but only three times on Sunday. Another late night / early morning train Su-F is the Caledonian Highland Sleeper between London Euston and Fort William, but you're probably better taking the Lowland Sleeper from Euston to Glasgow Central, then a daytime train. Upper Station is just a platform halt with no facilities. There is a steep ramp to the single platform.

By bus[edit]
First Bus 1B runs from Glasgow Osborne Street to Helensburgh every 30 min, taking 1 hr 45 min via Scotstoun, Clydebank and Dumbarton. There isn't a bus station, the 1B stops by the railway station then along King St as far as Glasgow St. Don't take the 1A, which branches north to Balloch.

The captain beached her and the crew got off safely but the ship overturned. No-one could be found responsible for removing the wreck, so there she lies.

Drink[edit]




The Battle of Garelochhead
In the 19th century steamers brought day-trippers to resorts such as Helensburgh and Garelochhead. The owner of the pier at Garelochhead, Sir James Colquhoun, objected to such trips on the Sabbath, and in 1853 even got up a mob to prevent the steamer landing. Throughout that summer, there were rowdy scenes as the pier was picketed or barricaded against landings, and townsmen and trippers hurled bottles and potatoes at each other and came to blows. Sir James also raised a legal action, which wound its way through the courts for six years before being resolved in his favour. He raised no objection to the brawling on the Sabbath, nor to the town pubs being open, the main draw for the visitors. 


Royal Bar facing the pier is open M-Th 11AM-midnight, F-Su 11AM-1AM.
