Numbinbah Valley is in the Gold Coast hinterland of South East Queensland, Australia.


Understand[edit]
The word Numbinbah comes from the Aboriginal word "nyummin", meaning 'hold-tight country'.  Natives believed the mountains were held together by the narrow valley.
During World War II, Australian airmen were trained in the area to prepare for jungle combat in Papua New Guinea.
The area includes the settlements of Numinbah, Chillingham and Crystal Creek
