Port Talbot Centre
In the past Port Talbot was not a tourist destination but that is changing rapidly as it now has one of the most popular visitor attractions in Wales: the world-renowned Afan Forest Park which is one of the top centres for mountain biking in the world. Port Talbot town itself is a major industrial centre, and the few historic buildings of interest were obliterated in the 1960s and 70s to make way for the motorway and other road networks. However, the sea front offers a long beautiful sandy beach (Aberavon) offering views over Swansea Bay.  It has been awarded the coveted Blue Flag for cleanliness and water quality.  Just outside the town is the beautiful Margam country park, the former home of the Talbot Family, the family who introduced the steel-making industry to the town and built the harbour to allow import of iron ore. It is now a popular tourist attraction with weddings and functions held at the Orangery.  Behind the town is the picturesque pine-clad Afan valley which is home to the second most popular visitor attraction in Wales: the Afan Forest Mountain Bike centre.
