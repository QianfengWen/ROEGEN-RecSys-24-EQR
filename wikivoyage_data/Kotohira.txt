Tourist Information Site[edit]

Get in[edit]
The Nanpu is the main train service connecting Kotohira with the Japanese mainland.
Kotohira is on the JR Dosan Line. From Takamatsu, rapid trains depart hourly between 10:00 and 20:00, reaching Kotohira in 49 minutes (¥830). Buses also run from Takamatsu Airport (50 minutes, ¥1500). The private Kotoden Kotohira Line (琴電琴平線) departs from Takamatsu-Chikko station on the hour and half-past (one hour, ¥610).
From Okayama, Kotohira can be reached in one hour by taking the hourly Nanpu limited express (¥3160), or occasional local trains (105 minutes). Another option is the Marine Liner rapid train, which leaves at approx. 44 minutes past the hour, to Sakaide and then a change for the local to Kotohira (80-90 minutes, ¥1300).

Get around[edit]
The shrine entrance is an easily walked few hundred meters south from the train stations. True to its name, the shrine is built on a hill and it's a fairly steep climb all the way to the top.
For a taste of medieval luxury, porters can carry you up the hill in a palanquin for even steeper prices (¥6000 and up).

Kompira-san[edit]
The sights below are listed in order as you ascend the steps.

 Great Gate (大門 Daimon). The Great Gate, halfway up the hill, marks your entry into the shrine complex. 
 Treasure Hall (宝物館) (On the right after the Great Gate.). ¥500. 
 Asahi Shrine (旭社 Asahi sha). This shrine, which dates back to 1837, is the largest, oldest, and most impressive of Kompira's many shrine halls, in ornately decorated unpainted wood. 
 Main Shrine (本宮 Hon-gū). The centerpiece of the temple complex, with a large square in front and many buildings packed in a cluster. 
 Izutama Shrine (厳魂神社 Izutama-jinja) (583 steps up from the Main Shrine.). Far fewer visitors make it all the way up here, and you'll be rewarded with nice views over the city.  Also known as the Inner Shrine.

Do[edit]
34.184633133.8180281 Konpira Grand Theatre (金毘羅大芝居 (金丸座) - Konpira Ōshibai (Kanamaru-za)), 241 Otsu, Kotohira-cho, ☏ +81 877-73-3846. Tours W-M 09:00-17:00, performances by schedule. Built in 1835, this kabuki playhouse is the oldest remaining in Japan. It was designated an Important Cultural National Property in 1970.

Buy[edit]
From the moment you step off the train, you'll be bombarded by shrieking yellow advertisements for magical Konpira amulets at ¥800 a pop, available throughout the shrine.

Eat[edit]
Kagawa prefecture is famed for its Sanuki udon wheat noodles, and you'll find no shortage of shops hawking them on the road and stairway to the shrine. Kotohira's very own style is less than innovatively composed by pouring soy and bonito flakes on top of your noodles.
