The parish consists of the towns of Frinton-on-Sea and Walton-on-the-Naze, and the villages of Kirby-le-Soken, Kirby Cross and Great Holland.

Understand[edit]
The town has a claim on the world's first wireless telegraph school, which was established in 1901 with the opening of a residential school for training engineers for Marconi's International Marine Communication Co.
In 1934 an estate of Art Deco houses was planned designed by Oliver Hill but was never completed and in 1936 building work stopped. Several of the original Art Deco properties remain.

51.881.242 Hamford Water is a wetland nature reserve in the estuary a mile or so north of Walton. It has grasslands, creeks, mud and sand flats, salt marshes and tidal islands such as Horsey. It has many resident and migratory birds. The reserve's most lurid denizens are the bright orange seals, both Atlantic / Grey and Harbour / Common seals. The mud flats contain iron ore, which the seal coats absorb to resemble an orange fake suntan, which lasts until the next moult. These seals are distinctive when they show up on shores many miles away, to be mocked as "Essex Girls".
