Zawoja is a straggling village in Małopolskie Province in southern Poland. It's known as the longest village in Poland.


Get in[edit]
Zawoja can easiest be reached by bus from Krakow. There are several bus companies of which only Merc-Bus seems to have a schedule published online (only on the Polish website version). The transit costs around 15 zł and takes about 2 hours. Buses leave hourly from 6:00 to 22:00 from the Krakow central bus terminal next to the railway station.

Get around[edit]
Zawoja stretches on about 18 km. To travel between the parts of the town, any bus can be stopped at the bus stops. Travel in Zawoja is 2 zł.

See[edit]
Wooden church in Zawoja
Zawoja's main attraction is Babiogórski National Park [dead link], with the 1725 m peak of Babia Góra and wildlife including bears, wolves and lynxes.
A beautiful wooden church dating from 1888 can be visited in the town part known as Zawoja Centrum.
Do[edit]
Hiking is definitely the most rewarding activity for visitors. There are several paths going through the National Park as well as the bordering forest. Maps are available in any bigger book store in Poland.

Buy[edit]
A lot of small stores with irregular opening hours offer the most necessary food and other items. They can be found in every part of the town. A more expensive, but very complete supermarket can be found in Zawoja Centrum.

Eat[edit]
There are restaurants scattered around all parts of the town.

Drink[edit]
