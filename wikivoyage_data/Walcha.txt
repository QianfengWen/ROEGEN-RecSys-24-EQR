Walcha is a town on the Northern Tablelands of the New England (New South Wales) region, 425 kilometres north of Sydney via Thunderbolts Way and 184 km west of Port Macquarie. The area is the southern gateway to the Oxley Wild Rivers National Park which can be accessed at the Apsley Falls, 20 km east of Walcha and 1 km off the Oxley Highway via a sealed road.


Understand[edit]
Walcha is a great place to enjoy fishing, four-wheel-drive trips and bushwalks into wilderness areas with gorges, rainforests and waterfalls. The town is recognized for its unique Open Air Gallery, historic buildings, cafes, restaurants and quality accommodation.

Climate[edit]
Walcha has a cool climate with some snow falls and frosty nights, producing extremely low temperatures, during the winter months. However, frosts are usually followed by clear sunny days. In autumn, the town has the changing colours of the trees which make for great photographs. But summer is a great time to visit Walcha, although even on warm sunny days the temperature can suddenly drop. Due to its altitude, the town is rarely humid, and even days where the temperature reaches 33°C are tolerable. Be prepared for a sudden drop in temperature at anytime of the year by bringing adequate warm clothing.
During a very cold night untreated (summer) diesel fuel can "gel" (turn from a liquid to a semi-solid). At temperatures below freezing, diesel engines may experience starting problems and warm-up slowly. As the morning warms (usually before 9AM), the vehicle will operate normally without intervention.

Get in[edit]
30°59′7″S 151°35′36″EMap of Walcha
By car[edit]
Walcha is located at the junction of the scenic Thunderbolts Way and the Oxley Highway. When travelling from the south (Sydney) on the Pacific Highway past Raymond Terrace you will see an exit sign pointing to Bucketts Way and Gloucester on the left hand side of the road. Take this exit, and turn left at the round-a-bout in Gloucester and follow this road (Thunderbolts Way) all the way into Walcha. This route is about 70 km shorter than the alternative trip on the New England Highway through the Hunter Valley and Tamworth and mostly has a 110 km/h limit except in the Hunter. When travelling on the New England Highway, after crossing the Macdonald River at Bendemeer, turn right onto the Oxley Highway which takes you into Walcha.  Motorcycle rides from Gloucester and Port Macquarie are also very popular scenic trips for riders. Do not speed through the town. The boys in blue have some new play toys that they are trying out.

By train[edit]
Walcha does not have a railway station, however it is serviced by the station at Walcha Road, which is located approximately 20 km west of Walcha. Trains arriving or departing Walcha Road are connected to Walcha by bus, which must be booked at the same time as booking your rail ticket. This rail service connects Sydney with Armidale where the service terminates.

Get around[edit]
There are not any public transport services in the town and you will need a vehicle to visit the many out of town sightseeing locations. A 4WD with low range is needed if trips are planned into the wilderness areas of Riverside Camping Area and Youdale’s Hut. Trips to the spectacular Apsley and Tia Falls in the Oxley Wild Rivers National Park are easily accessed using a regular vehicle.

See[edit]
Visit Walcha’s Open Air Gallery where local, national and international artists have combined to create a unique streetscape with about 35 sculptures and artworks, plus 30 sculptured verandah posts in front of local businesses. Obtain a brochure on these works from the visitor centre before taking a walk or self-drive tour around them.
At the Pioneer Cottage museum and complex view a genuine 1860s shingle roofed and slab sided cottage. See the Tiger Moth plane that was used to drop the first superphosphate in Australia. The wool hall here gives a good insight into the history of the sheep and wool industry.
Walcha has four churches representing the Catholic, Anglican and Presbyterian denominations. The old Anglican church was built in the 1861 from stone taken from the demolished homestead, 'Villa Walcha', erected on the Wolka run in the 1840s.
Visit the grave of Nathaniel Buchanan, who is buried in the Walcha Cemetery. Nat was a highly skilled drover and bushman who opened up droving routes through central Queensland, the Northern Territory and the Kimberley regions.
There are some interesting buildings scattered through the town including the Court House, churches, banks and the Post Office. Langford is a stately home, situated about 1 km south of Walcha on Thunderbolts Way, which can be viewed from the road.
Research Walcha history or your Walcha relatives at the local history archives and library.

Youdale’s Hut is another low range 4WD vehicle destination that is also possible to access after paying a fee and obtaining a key at Apsley Motors.
Werrikimbe National Park, 60 km east of Walcha is a pristine wilderness. It's a World Heritage park, wrapped within the dramatic fold of the Great Dividing Range where two rivers, the Forbes and Hastings, begin their journey to the coast. Racecourse Trail runs for 20 km across the top section of Werrikimbe and gives access to the park's highlights. Here you'll see subalpine swamp, heath, snow gums and the soft grey-greens of the cool climate eucalypt forests. In spring, the high country wildflowers alone make this a spectacular drive. There are many other National Parks and Nature Reserves in or near the district, including: Mummel Gulf National Park.
Other tourist attractions include scenic 4WD trips, hiking, visiting the State Forests, fishing (mainly for trout) and fossicking opportunities.
