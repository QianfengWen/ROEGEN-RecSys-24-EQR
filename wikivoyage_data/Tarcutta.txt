Tarcutta is a city in the Riverina region of New South Wales.


Understand[edit]
Tarcutta is the half-way point on the Hume Highway between Sydney and Melbourne.  One of the last towns to be bypassed on this busy dual-carriageway route, its main street long had a constant stream of cars and rumble of trucks, but is now wide and quiet. It is unclear how or if Tarcutta will adapt to its new role of quiet country town.  The immediate effect has been prounced, with the service station and several take-away places now boarded up, and town's pub for sale.
The neighbouring town of Holbrook is the competition as a stopping point.  Also bypassed, Holbrook has the submarine, the park, and a few nice cafes to make the stop a little more worthwhile.

Get in[edit]
