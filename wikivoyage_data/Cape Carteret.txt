Cape Carteret is a town of 1,214 people (as of 2000) in the Crystal Coast region of North Carolina. Like Newport, it's mainly a residential community, even though it's right on the water and boasts some very nice views of the sound. Basically, you're not likely to stay here or to eat here, or really even to do very much here, but there's a good chance you might be passing through.


Get in[edit]
Cape Carteret is at the junction of NC-58, which runs from Maysville across Bogue Banks to Morehead City, and NC-24, which runs between Fayetteville and Morehead City. It's also a short drive from US-70, the main road in the region, and US-17, which connects Wilmington to New Bern.

Get around[edit]
As with the rest of the area, you should really have a car if you want to get anywhere.
