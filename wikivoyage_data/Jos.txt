Jos is a city of about 810,000 people (2015). It is the state capital of Plateau State in North Central Nigeria. Before the unrest that has shaken the region, the city's cool climate, scenic plateau location and colonial importance made it a popular tourist destination.


Understand[edit]

Jos is inhabited by various ethnic groups and chiefs, of whom are indigenous Afizere, Berom, Anaguta, Bugi, Mwagwavul, Angas, Tarok and many more from other areas of Nigeria, such as Yoruba and Igbo, Hausa and many southerners displaced from other northern cities in the aftermath of religious violence. The most widely spoken language is Hausa, and because of the high literacy rate in Jos, almost everyone also speaks English. 

Jos, looking south from Anglo-Jos
Jos is an old city, one of the first built in Nigeria during colonial rule. Jos has always been the home of many cultures. Because of its old structure, Jos has been a very hard place for the government to renovate. Although places like Rayfield and other new settlements have the feeling of living in a developed city, its oldest sites and tourist locations most certainly are very outdated.
The Berom are one of the three largest groups in the city and environs. According to the locals, the prominent people in the Lamingo district are the Afizere also called by the Hausa exonym, Jarawa. The language of the Berom is Berom (the largest Plateau language spoken in Nigeria) and that of the Afizere is called Izere, with the third group being the Irigwe who speak Rigwe; however, the dominant language spoken across the city is Hausa. Some of the common names you hear around the Berom speaking areas are Jang, Pam, Dung, Dalyop; names you would hear in the Izere speaking areas are Azi, Izang, Arin, Itse, Aware for males and Adar, Agyer, Atong, Kushim for females. Lamingo occupies an expanse of land - high lands and lowlands inclusive. Flat terrain of rocks seen in isolation and in groups bound this area.

Get in[edit]
Old Airport Road Roundabout, Jos
Terminus Roundabout
Jos is served by many bus lines, chiefly Cross Country that runs air-conditioned mini-van services from Lagos and Abuja. The state government-owned Plateau Line runs station wagon services, but these are mostly uncomfortably crowded trips. Many other state governments operate transport services with termini in various Jos motor-parks from surrounding state capitals: Gombe, Lafia, Kaduna, Damaturu and even Yola. Other mini-bus or car services are private arrangements where you sit and wait for the vehicle to fill up, but are best avoided because the drivers tend to have dubious driving skills. You can also get into Jos by having a private driver in a private vehicle; because of terrorist acts, you may pass through a lot of security check points.

By plane[edit]
9.63648.8711 Yakubu Gowon Airport (JOS  IATA). Arik Air runs a once a day domestic flight from Lagos to Jos. The airport is about 30 km from the town so it is best to have some money for a taxi fare to town (generally about ₦2,500) if there will be nobody waiting for you.   (updated Jan 2023)
By train[edit]

Get around[edit]
Map of Jos
There are many taxi cabs, and other transport vehicles all over Jos, such as motorcycles, tricycles and buses. But they have to be shared with other passengers over defined routes. it is also possible to get a private taxi where you share with no one at all, but it is much safer to bear the inconvenience of travelling with others, to avoid getting robbed. Some mini-bus routes are also defined but these are difficult to understand. The taxis and buses almost always tend to be rickety. Motorcycle taxis, commonly known as 'okada' are also a choice but these can be very dangerous as the road network is filled with a lot of potholes and there is a general lack of safe practices. The "okada" rides also tend to be more expensive than the 'Tricycle'  or bus rides but are very flexible. 
Various roads lead to Lamingo depending on where one is coming from. From the University of Jos (main campus/permanent site), you could get a small bus, a motor cycle or a tricycle to Lamingo. Generally speaking, you can get to Lamingo from any destination within Jos with an average of about ₦10,000. You will always find a bus, a tricycle or a bike.
