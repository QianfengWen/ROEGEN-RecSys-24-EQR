Dalkeith is a town in  Midlothian, six miles southeast of Edinburgh in the Central Belt of Scotland. It's a commuter town for the city and had a population of 13,400 in 2016. The main attractions are the country park around the 18th century Dalkeith Palace, and Scotland's National Mining Museum a couple of miles south at Newtongrange. 


Understand[edit]
Watchtower in the town cemetery
The languages of ancient Britain were P-Celtic, akin to Welsh, so the town name may resemble ddôl coed, "meadow wood". The later Gaelic language was Q-Celtic, brought from Ireland, but in these lowland parts it was supplanted by Scots-English in early modern times. The area was industrial even in the Norman era, with monks hewing coal and bashing metal. The big growth was with 19th-century industry, with deep coal mines, and the railway arrived in 1831. Dalkeith became the administrative centre for the county of Midlothian and remains so. It also became part of Edinburgh's commuter belt, but has not been absorbed as a suburb - it's just far enough out to have retained its identity as a separate town, beyond the palisade of the city bypass.

Get in[edit]
From the airport, follow ring-road A720 to congested Sheriffhall roundabout (a flyover is long overdue) then A6106 for the last mile into Dalkeith. You can also take Skylink Bus 400 to Fort Kinnaird on the southern edge of the city, then change to the buses below.
From Edinburgh, use Lothian Bus 3 (and night bus N3), 29, X29, 33 or X33. These start from various points in the western or northern burbs, then run via central Edinburgh, southside and Fort Kinnaird / Royal Infirmary to Dalkeith. From here they continue to Newtongrange, Gorebridge or Mayfield.
Dalkeith used to stand astride the A68 Edinburgh - Jedburgh - Northumberland road, and just east of the A7 Edinburgh - Galashiels - Hawick - Carlisle road. Both roads now bypass town but some buses still call at Dalkeith. The most useful of these is the 51 / 52 from Melrose, Jedburgh and Kelso. Borders Bus X95 stops at Eskbank en route between Edinburgh, Galashiels, Selkirk, Hawick and Carlisle. Long distance coaches (eg from Newcastle and London) don't call here.
East Coast Bus 140 runs from Musselburgh (with buses to North Berwick, Haddington and Dunbar) to Dalkeith and onward to Roslin (for Rosslyn Chapel) and Penicuik.
Eskbank railway station is a mile southwest of Dalkeith, less convenient than the bus for Edinburgh. But the train is a good option for Galashiels and Tweedbank (for Abbotsford House and Melrose Abbey), running hourly and taking 40 min.

Get around[edit]
