Groningen is a lively student city in the Northern Netherlands. It is the capital of a province with the same name and home to about 217,000 inhabitants (2023), making it the largest city in the north. A university town with some 50,000 students gives the city its famous vibe; a pleasant youthful atmosphere, some fine historic heritage and with plenty of things to do.
This article includes the former municipality of Haren, with which Groningen merged in 2019.


Understand[edit]
Hoge der A, Groningen
Archaeologists have found traces of habitation from the Neolithic and the later Iron Age. The city appeared in writing in the year 1040 as "Villa Cruoninga", apparently already a place of some significance. The city has a rich history, which can be seen clearly from the Medieval buildings in the downtown area.
In the 13th century, when the city was an important trade centre, its inhabitants built a city wall to underline its authority. The city had a strong influence on the surrounding lands and made its dialect a common tongue. The most influential period of the city was the end of the 15th century, when the nearby province of Friesland was administered from Groningen. During those years, the Martini Tower was built, which loomed over the city at (then) 127 m tall, making it the highest building in Europe at the time. The city's independence came to an end when it chose to join forces with the Spanish during the Eighty Years' War in 1594. It was later reconquered, and joined the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands.
In 1614, the University of Groningen was founded for religious education. In the same period the city expanded rapidly and a new city wall was built. That city wall was tested during the Third Anglo-Dutch War in 1672, when the city was attacked fiercely by the Bishop of Münster, Bernhard von Galen. The city walls resisted, an event which is celebrated with music and fireworks on 28 August (as "Groningens Ontzet" or "Bommen Berend").
The city did not escape the devastation of World War II. In particular, the main square, Grote Markt, was largely destroyed in April 1945, during the Battle of Groningen, which lasted several days. However, the Martinitoren, its church, the Goudkantoor, and the city hall were not substantially damaged.
Nowadays the city of Groningen is nationally renowned for the university, the museum and its vibrant atmosphere. 50% of the citizens are below the age of 30, making this the youngest city in the country. For decades, the bicycle has played a central role in the lives of people in the city, and today accounts for no less than 60% of all traffic movement with more bikes than citizens.

Climate[edit]
The temperate climate is pleasant in Groningen, without extremes due to its coastal climate. Due to its location in the north of the Netherlands, during winter the average temperatures of this city are slightly lower than the average of the rest of the Netherlands. Snow and freezing temperatures are common in the winter but rarely last more than a few days. 30°C in the summer is not exceptional. Most average daytime highs in summer are around 22°C. Daylight hours run from 05:15 - 22:00 in the summer months to 08:45 - 16:15 in the winter.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Groningen is served by 53.129236.586651 Groningen Airport Eelde, (GRQ  IATA), Machlaan 14a Eelde, ☏ +31 50 3097070. The airport of Groningen offers two flights per week from Gdansk (Wizz Air), and various other scheduled flights from selected cities and holiday destinations in Greece, Portugal, Spain, Canary Islands and Turkey. The Brussels, Munich and Copenhagen flights are operated by Nordica, in cooperation with Star Alliance members such as SAS, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines. Therefore, many destinations are reachable from Groningen with a transfer at Copenhagen Airport, Munich Airport or Brussels Airport.   
Groningen is also easily reached by direct train (2.5 hr) from Schiphol Airport, which has far more direct connections than Groningen Airport.
To travel between the airport and the city:

Bus 9 runs twice per hour between the airport and city. The journey to the centre takes approximately 40 minutes. €5 one way, tickets can be purchased from the driver, or use the OV-chipkaart. Not all line 9 buses go to the airport, but this is clearly stated on the digital rollsigns. You can no longer buy bus tickets with cash. Make sure you have a card valid in the Netherlands (Maestro is best) or be ready to negotiate with the driver.
Bus 100 is a special shuttle bus to and from the airport starting at the Central Station, but only around the Copenhagen, Brussels, Munich, London and Gdansk flights. Besides Central Station, bus 100 also stops at the main down town places and hotels (including Hampshire Plaza Hotel in the southern part of the city), and the academic UMCG Hospital. This bus trip takes about 20 minutes from the Central Station and costs €5 one way, tickets at the driver.
Taxis are not always available at the airport. If you wish to travel by taxi, book in advance. A taxi to the city will cost you €25-30.
By train[edit]
Groningen Central Station
By Dutch standards, it's a fairly long way from the major destinations in the western Netherlands. Getting here, however, is not hard. Groningen has three train stations, the central station (53.2105566.5647222 Station Groningen, often called 'Hoofdstation'), 53.2056.5844443 Groningen Europapark and 53.236.5563894 Groningen Noord. All trains eventually arrive at the central station; only a few trains stop at the smaller stations. Tickets for all train journeys can be purchased at the train station or online at NS.nl.
There are two trains departing from Groningen Station to southern destinations like Amsterdam and Rotterdam every hour. One train terminates in The Hague and the other train terminates in Rotterdam. The train towards The Hague also calls at Amsterdam South Station and Amsterdam Schiphol Airport Station. Amsterdam Central Station can be reached with one change at Almere. Brussels and Paris can be reached with one change at Schiphol Airport Station. A regional line operated by Arriva runs west to Leeuwarden three times per hour. Some popular destinations include:

Train service between Leer (Germany) and Groningen is replaced by a bus service until around 2020 due to a ship crashing into a bridge on the rail line in 2016. You can either take a direct bus (55 min, every 2 hours), or take a bus to Weener then a train to Groningen (1 hr 30 min, every hour).
Commuter trains, all operated by Arriva twice per hour, run towards Uithuizen/Roodeschool, Appingedam/Delfzijl, Winschoten and Veendam.

By bus[edit]
Flixbus intercity busline
Groningen 'Hoofdstation'
The main bus station is right next to the central train station. At the bus station you can find a wide range of city buses and lines to virtually all large and small destinations in the region, and direct buses to Emmeloord, via Heerenveen and Lemmer.
Flixbus operates a couple of domestic intercity bus lines from Groningen. Line 821 runs to Hengelo and Enschede and line 822 runs to Apeldoorn, Arnhem, Nijmegen and Eindhoven. These bus lines leave at P+R Haren (near Postillion Hotel) and opposite the central train station, at the other side of the road. Booking in advance is cheaper. The buses are in most cases cheaper and faster than making the same journey by train.

International buses[edit]
There are several direct buslinks to Germany and Belgium operated by German carriers. For example to Bremen, Oldenburg, Hamburg, Berlin, Antwerp, Brussels and Leuven (starting at €9, one-way) by Flixbus.
Destinations in Belgium, France and England are reachable with one transit in Amsterdam. Destinations in Sweden require a change in Copenhagen. It is not possible to book a domestic journey. Ecolines operates a bus line towards Warsaw and stops en route to Poland in some German cities like Bremen and Berlin.
All international bus lines leave opposite the train station. Book a day in advance to get the lowest fare.

By car[edit]
A myriad of roads lead to Groningen, making the city well reachable by car. The major highways are the A7 (west-east) and the A28 coming from the south. Several fine N-roads connect to the city from nearby destinations, and are the way to go further north. The most notable ones are the N360 from Appingedam and Delfzijl, and the N361 north, direction of Winsum.
Driving in the old city, particularly within the central canal ring, is not the best option. Parts of town are car-free, there are many one way roads, parking is not always easy to find, and none of it is free. You can, however, park for free overnight at IKEA (a 5 minute cycle from downtown).
There are several Park & Ride facilities around Groningen. At these facilities you can park your car for free and take a fast and frequent bus to Downtown for a small amount. One of the biggest facilities is on Sontweg, to the east of the city and near Ikea. It is clearly marked when driving on the ring road. Parking there is free, and for €2 (one way) or €5 return for 5 people, a regular bus service takes you right to Downtown. If you come from the direction of Assen (south), the Park & Ride facility Haren is your best option. From the west, from direction Drachten, P+R Hoogkerk is on your route. If you are coming from Germany you can park at "Kardinge". Follow the road to "Eemshaven" and take the exit "Kardinge". All P+R facilities are clearly marked on the motorways.

Get around[edit]
53°13′4″N 6°33′59″EMap of Groningen

Like most cities in the Netherlands, Groningen's historic city center is surrounded by a canal, the diepenring.  Most of the sights are within this area, and the Central Station is 50 m outside it, and the museum built in it.
Within the diepenring, traffic is very restricted; Groningen's centre is designed to be as traffic-free as possible, and it is very difficult to drive and park within this area.  Even resident parking permits are strictly rationed.  However, the central area is compact and can be easily crossed on foot or with a bicycle.
Further out, Groningen has a loosely connected ring road, consisting of several N-roads forming a rather square ring shape around the centre.  The city sprawls somewhat and crosses this ring in places, but most of the population live within this area.

By bike[edit]
Cycling is the best way to travel around. Getting from any place in Groningen to the centre will take at most 20 minutes. This makes the bike a fast, cheap and easy way to travel in Groningen. Don't get scared by the overwhelming number of bicycles. The city houses tens of thousands of students, whose primary means of transportation is the bike. Bicycle theft is pretty high. Most bikes have one lock, but it is best to use a good second lock (preferably a strong chain lock for least €30).

By bus[edit]
If you don't have a bike, the bus is the best option for distances you don't want to walk. All buses run through (or end on) Central station. Most buses have a stop at the Grote Markt square (central downtown). The major bus lines are listed below. Tickets are available from the driver (during off-peak periods you can buy a Eurokaartje, cost €2.50) or use the OV-chipkaart for payment. The Central Station is listed as bus stop "Hoofdstation" in and on buses and on bus stops. As mentioned earlier, buses no longer accept cash. Bring a card that works in the Netherlands (Maestro is best) or be ready for disappointment.

Q-Link[edit]
Q-Link is a group of 5 bus services which are air conditioned, have a WiFi connection, and run from city destinations to places just outside the region. One exception for line 15 which is a student express line to Zernike.

Line 1 runs from the Central Station to the Zernike/Zuidhorn, via Grote Markt, Noorderplantsoen and Paddepoel.
Line 3 runs from Lewenborg to Leek via Kardinge, Grote Markt, Central Station and P+R Hoogkerk.
Line 4 runs from Beijum to Roden via Kardinge, Grote Markt, Central Station and P+R Hoogkerk.
Line 5 runs from station Europapark to Annen via UMCG Hospital, Grote Markt, Central Station, P+R Haren and Zuidlaren. Sometimes this bus terminates at P+R Haren, so make sure Zuidlaren and Annen are mentioned if you travel this way.
Line 6 runs from P+R Haren to Ten Boer/Delfzijl via Central Station, Zuiderdiep, UMCG Hospital and Ruischerbrug.
Line 15 is a student express service from Central Station to college campus Zernike. It is just north of Paddepoel and line 15 runs via Rembrandt van Rijnstraat and Paddepoel. These buses are very crowded in the morning to Zernike, and in the afternoon back to the Central Station. This route does not run in weekends.
See[edit]
The Martinikerk tower has been the city's main landmark for centuries
Downtown Groningen is pleasant and interesting. The city centre provides plenty of cultural heritage and a laid-back atmosphere. Together with the excellent Groninger Museum, it forms the main attraction for visitors.
Like many cities in the Netherlands, the centre is surrounded by a canal. Several historic canals have been "gedempt", or filled, however, and turned into streets. This is reflected in their names, and you'll likely find yourself strolling along the Gedempte Zuiderdiep. The heart of the city is formed around the two adjoining market squares, The Grote Markt (or Great Market) and the Vismarkt (or Fish Market). Standing tall on the edge of the Grote Markt is the Martini Tower, a true landmark for Groningen and one of its main attractions.

Architecture[edit]
Modern architecture: Kempkensberg
Groninger Museum
Building in the Chinese Garden, the Hidden Empire Ming in the Hortus Haren
Warfare left hundreds of buildings in ruins in 1945, but a good number of monuments remain. Strolling through the city centre you'll encounter former canal warehouses, the city hall, several churches, the former Gold Office and many other historic buildings. The city has, with success, attempted to find a balance between modern architecture and historic grandeur. The latest initiative is a major renewal of the eastern side of the Grote Markt.
Typical Dutch architecture is the Amsterdamse School, a style of architecture that arose from 1910 through about 1930 in Amsterdam. The Amsterdam School movement is part of international Expressionist architecture, sometimes linked to German Brick Expressionism. While Amsterdam has the most buildings in this style, Groningen also has some wonderful edifices, and sometimes called the northern capital of Amsterdamse School. 53.206786.559331 Vensterschool Stadspark at Parkweg in the lovely Grunobuurt district and 53.214296.565372 Bureau Gemeentewerken at Gedempte Zuiderdiep 96 are worth walking along.
There are a number of special architectural skyscrapers. The Kempkensberg is a 25-storey high-rise building in the south of the city and is commonly called 'The Cruiseship' by locals. The Gasunie Building is considered to be a great example of an ‘organic building’, situated on the edge of the Stadspark.

53.224956.567413 Dot, Vrydemalaan 2. Originally known as Infoversum, this remarkable structure was built as the only full-dome 3D theatre in the Netherlands, before it was turned in a modern restaurant and cultural center. Located near the city beach. In winter, the building is decorated with thousands of lights, turning it into the largest Christmas decoration in the world. 
53.183196.553394 Wall House II. Open during exhibitions Sa Su 13:00-17:00. The Wall House II is a building in the south of the city located on the banks of Hoornsemeer lake. The building is one of the few realised designs to which the renowned American architect John Hejduk owes his fame. The building is a structure of reinforced concrete for the wall and columns, with a steel-framed corridor, wood stud walls, and a stucco exterior. Organised around a central axis of horizontal and vertical planes.   
53.23676.5245 Reitdiep colourful houses. You may know these Scandinavian looking colourful terraced houses from Pinterest or Instagram. Built at the waterside they create a wonderful composition. Take Q-Link 11 to bus stop P+R Reitdiep.

Historic heritage[edit]
Most of the historic heritage can be found within the ring of canals. The most visited tourist attraction is without doubt the Martini Tower, but there is much more to see in Groningen: old canal warehouses, guesthouses, typical Dutch gables and beautiful gardens. Probably the most characteristic streets of the city are the 53.21786.5591714 Hoge and Lage der A streets. These two streets run along the A canal and are known for the dozens of national heritage sites, in particular the outstanding warehouses from the Middle Ages and a 17th century brewery named 'Batavia'.
Scattered through the city centre are several late-medieval Guest Houses (Gasthuizen). During daylight hours these picturesque courtyards can be visited for free. The houses are not open to the public: the people living in them enjoy their quiet and privacy. Access is through gated doorways that will be unlocked during daylight hours and locked during the evening/night. The largest and oldest one is the courtyard of the 53.215566.56715 Pelstergasthuis, located in the Pelsterstraat, next to the Pelstergasthuis church. The Guest House consists of several courtyards connected through archways. In the Peperstraat, near the end on the left when viewed from the Poelestraat, is the 53.217416.5713916 Pepergasthuis. The Peper Guest House was founded in 1405. Part of the medieval city wall is still visible from the courtyard. At the tourist information is a city walk available through many courtyards.

Old warehouses along the Hoge der Aa canal. In the background, the tower of the Aa-Kerk can be seen.
Houses in the Pepergasthuis.
Other important heritage listings are:

53.216486.56185817 Der Aa-Kerk, Akerkhof. This beautiful medieval church with its remarkable yellow-painted tower stands tall above the neighbouring Korenbeurs. Established between 1425 and 1492, the church's tower was repeatedly destroyed and replaced, with the current one originating in 1711. The building is no longer used for religious services but is open for visitors and regularly houses expositions.   
53.219216.5630718 Academiegebouw (University of Groningen), Broerstraat 5. The Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, the University of Groningen, is the second-oldest university in the Netherlands and one of three State Universities of the Netherlands. It was established in 1614. While the university has its share of modern buildings in town and out, the Academiegebouw is an old and attractive building with a tower and worth strolling past. Although it is not intended, the building is accessible for the public. The interior of the building is magnificent, especially the stained glass, the entrance hall and the murals in the Aula and Senaatskamer (Senate room). 
53.218516.5663619 Gold Office (Goudkantoor), Waagplein 1 (More or less between the two market squares). This beautifully decorated building on the edge of the Grote Markt is hard to miss. It was built in 1635 as the office for the city receiver. The words Date Caesari quae sunt Caesaris, Latin for "render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's", still remind of this early function of the building. Later, between 1814 and 1887, it served as a gold office in the sense that this was the place where gold and silver works were authenticated and marked as real. Today, it's a café.   
The Academiegebouw is the main building of the University of Groningen, the third largest university of the Netherlands.
Historic houses at the Martinikerkhof.
The Prinsentuin is a lovely Renaissance-style garden and an excellent place in which to sit down and relax for half an hour.
53.220196.5691220 Martinikerkhof (Martini cemetery). The Martinikerkhof used to be a cemetery, but since 1828 it is no longer in use. The cemetery has been transformed into a beautiful square, an oasis of peace. Prominent on the Martinikerkhof is the Martini Church. On the east side of the square stands the 'Provinciehuis', the seat of the provincial government. The front of this beautiful building was built in the end of the 20th century, while the rear of the building dates back to the Middle Ages. At that time the building was used as a Latin School. The north side of the square is marked by nice old houses and the Prinsenhof. At the square stands the Saint George and the Dragon Memorial (Sint Joris en de Draak Monument), the official provincial Second World War memorial. The memorial has been made in remembrance of the whole loss and suffering in the city of Groningen. 
53.219356.5681621 Martini Tower and Church (Martinitoren), Grote Markt. 12:00-16:00 (11:00-17:00 in summer). One of the most important hotspots in Groningen refers to Saint Martin of Tours, the patron saint of the Bishopric of Utrecht. Locals call the tower d' Olle Grieze which means 'the old grey one' and is related to its colour. Tickets are available in the VVV (tourist information) shop just over the road. There is a wide view over the city from the top of the tower. It was built as a cruciform church in the 13th century, and was extended in the 15th and 16th centuries. Much of the wall and roof paintwork has been preserved. Of particular note is a 16th-century depiction of the life of Jesus Christ. €3.   
53.197116.5809622 Oude RKZ, Old Roman Catholic Hospital, ☏ +31 505257601. This is an old Roman Catholic hospital outside the city centre, now housing an art house cinema and commune. It's located just south of the city centre, in Helpman. The hospital itself was abandoned in 1978, after which it was squatted. Until 1986, the Oude RKZ was the largest squat in the Netherlands and possibly in the whole of Europe. In 1986 the government allowed the squat to be legalized. Nowadays it is a vibrant place where 250 people from all ages find a place to live and to share what is important. The former squat has cheap folk kitchens on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays. There are also 2 bars, a cinema, yoga and capoeira sessions and many other things. Being a motor for the Dutch alternative and artist scene, the Oude RKZ is a well known place to many people from all over Europe. If you want to eat at the folk kitchen it's best to call on the same day to reserve a meal. Meals are served at 18:30.

The city features the highest cycling rate for anywhere on the planet; almost 60% of journeys are by bike. Groningen is arguably the world's best cycling city. 40 years ago the local government made a radical choice to ban the car from the centre of the city to increase liveability in the city. Since then, cycling has evolved into the new normal. Some cycling features:

Cycling facilities at central station
Windmill 'The Helper' at Paterswoldsemeer lake
Paalkoepel
Excalibur wall at Bjoeks
Bikes everywhere
A bunch of guarded bike stalls across the city
Free way for cyclist with the many cycling lanes
Priority on roundabouts
Shared space with pedestrians in quieter and narrower streets
Traffic lights with rain sensors to give quicker priority to cyclists on wet days

Bikes are also available at the Central Station with the OV-Chipkaart. Many hotels offer bike rental to their guests, usually for fees of roughly €10 or less per day.

Drink[edit]
De Drie Gezusters
Groningen's reputation as university town is borne out in its nightlife, which is comprehensive, with numerous options for drinking and clubbing. There are also several places to play pool/billiards. Most bars have the standard Dutch beers, but more and more international, especially Belgian, beers are beginning to have a presence. Bars in the down town area do not have fixed closing hours. Theoretically they can stay open for 24 hours a day, which a few bars do.
The largest nightlife area in Groningen is the Poelestraat area, located southeast of the Grote Markt. Here you'll find a lot of clubs and bars. The busiest nights are Thursday to Friday (studentnight) and Saturday to Sunday.

As it is a fairly popular city trip destination among the Dutch, Groningen has plenty of choices for places to stay.

Travellers minding their budgets will find that accommodation here is relatively cheap.
