San Simeon is a small town (population 445 at the 2020 U.S. census) in San Luis Obispo County in the Central Coast region of California. It is half way between Los Angeles and San Francisco, about 250 miles and a 4.5 to 5 hours drive from each. The southernmost point of the scenic Big Sur stretch of California coast terminates just north of town. San Simeon is most famous for the palatial Hearst Castle, which overlooks the town and surrounding ocean on a neighboring hill.

35.6852-121.1671 Hearst Castle, 750 Hearst Castle Rd (3 miles north of town), toll-free: +1-800-444-4445 (reservations). This palatial estate built by newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst is one of the most visited attractions in California. See the amazing European architecture including the Spanish cathedral-like facade, the Neptune Pool, and the Roman Baths. Think of it as a museum where many of the centuries-old pieces are built into the structure of the building. It is located at the top of a hill overlooking the Pacific Ocean. A 40-minute movie about the history of the castle shows every 45 minutes from 8:15AM to 6:45PM in the five-story theater in the Visitor Center off Highway 1. There are three different daytime guided tours, each lasting 45 minutes and each costing $30 for adults. There is an additional 30 minutes of travel time from the Visitor Center and back by bus – it is no longer necessary to make the bus trip for every tour, if doing multiple tours. Reservations recommended – book online where you can see how many of the up to 52 seats are still available for each time, and be wary of seats filling quickly close to the time. $30 adults, $15 children, more for longer tours.

35.6633-121.25782 Piedras Blancas State Marine Reserve, Highway One (north of San Simeon). In 1990 approximately two dozen elephant seals showed up at the beach at Piedras Blancas; in 2014 that number was over 20,000 and nearly 5,000 pups were born. Large males measure 14-16 feet long and weigh 3,000-5,000 pounds. Adult females measure 9-12 feet long and weigh 900-1,800 pounds. Pups are 3-4 feet long and weigh 60-80 pounds when born. Big males arrive to stake out territory in late-November, females arrive in mid-December, and most pups are born between mid-December and early February. By March the adult seals will return to the ocean, leaving the pups to teach themselves to swim. From April through August molting seals can be seen on the shore, while in September and October only a handful of resting seals visit the beach. A viewpoint along the highway provides parking, an overlook, and information about the seals. Docents may be on hand to provide additional information. (updated Oct 2015)
