The city of Yeosu consists of the Yeosu peninsula and 317 islands (49 inhabited, 268 uninhabited) with population of 300,000. Yeosu is a city of history and loyalty where the headquarters of South Jeolla Province Navy Base was located, and the Great Admiral Yi Sun Shin invented the Geobukseon or "a turtle ship" to save the country while serving as the Navy Commander when Japan invaded Korea in 16th century.
Lying about midway along the southern coast of South Korea, Yeosu has cool summers and mild winters thanks to the sea wind and warm current. Its blessed ocean climate also brings Yeosu relatively longer springs and autumns than other regions.

Orientation[edit]
Yeosu is fairly spread out with many districts each segregated by mountains or ocean. The main CBD centered around Jungang-dong and the harbor overlooking Dolsan Bridge is quite compact, however.
West of the harbor and through a mountain tunnel is Yeoseo-dong, a roughly circular neighborhood nestled in between mountains with a small downtown district in the center. A great deal further west lies Ssangbong-dong, home to Yeosu City Hall, a second smaller port and a bunch of fancy tourist hotels.
South of the harbor and across Dolsan Bridge are the many islands and islets that make up the Yeosu chain. Most of the larger ones are connected in a rough circle by a road well covered by public transportation. The vast majority of tourist attractions lie on this ring road.
East of the harbor and tucked on another little stretch of coastline is the site for the Yeosu 2012 World Expo. Yeosu's Korail train station is located here.
To finish off the compass points, to the north is the land access to Yeosu, and all the industrial areas (lit up nicely at night).
Finally, there is an additional urban corridor tucked between the harbour, Yeoseodong and the northern region. This thin stretch contains mostly residential housing, but also an E-mart and Yeosu's Intercity Bus Terminal.
Yeosu is developing like most of Korea, but retains a small-town charm that is vanishing from the country.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
34.842328127.6166671 Yeosu Airport (여수공항, 麗水空港, RSU  IATA). Korean Air and Asiana Airlines fly between Yeosu Airport and Gimpo Airport (Seoul) up to 8 times a day. Korean Air also has flight between Yeosu and Jeju on Friday and Sunday. The airport has an information desk, convenience store, cafes and car rental. There are buses and cheap taxis. It can take up to one hour to the downtown (shinae) of Yeosu by car.   
By bus[edit]
The express bus terminal (고속버스터미널) is connected to most bus routes across Korea. From Yeosu, it takes 5½ hours to Seoul (Central City terminal) and 2 hours to Gwangju, former capital of South Jeolla. There are two main terminals- one in the middle of the city and one in the Yeocheon neighborhood on the west end of the city. There is a minor terminal in Deogyang neighborhood in the north.

By train[edit]
Yeosu has two train stations. The main station is called Yeosu Expo Station yeosuexpoyeok (여수엑스포역) which is the southernmost station of Honam line and one stop before that there is smaller Yeocheon Station yeocheonyeok (여천역). Check Korail website for schedule, to check fare or to book tickets.
The high-speed train KTX began service to Yeosu October 1, 2011. A trip from Seoul to Yeosu takes about 3 hours 20 minutes.

Get around[edit]
The best way around the CBD is by taxi as the city is fairly small and taxi fare is quite cheap. Taxis are highly recommended against if crossing the bridge as Yeosu has some of the worst traffic jams in Korea at this bottleneck, despite its tiny size. Even by bus, it could be optimal to get off, walk the bridge and hop back on the previous bus at the other end. Ridiculous.

By bus[edit]
The bus system is very convenient, but a little difficult to utilize. Each bus stop should have a posting of the buses that will arrive and their respective stops but most have been inexplicably vandalised. Those that do still exist are strictly in Korean.
Once south of the main bridge, most buses take a similar route so it can be easy to hop on and off in whichever direction to wish to head. The one exception to this is a branch where half the buses turn south-east to stop at the hermitage whereas the rest continue south around the island chain.
The "magic number" bus, if you can call it that, is the 111. This bus travels a zig-zagging route from the Intercity bus Terminal to Hyangiram Hermitage via Jinnamgwan and the harbour, crossing the Dolsan Bridge and passing many of the tourism attractions on the southern islands.

A beautiful temple-like hermitage with views of the sea and the scattered islands that make up Yeosu Peninsula. The hermitage itself is located up the sides of a cliff and the entire complex is connected by a series of very thin trails winding their way through tight caves and under twisted evergreen foliage. Rather claustrophobic, but unique making it one of Yeosu's must-see attractions. The symbol of the hermitage is the turtle, after the distinctive natural hexagonal pattern on the rocks resembling a turtle's shell. In accordance with this, the monks have crafted a veritable army of adorable little stone turtles large enough to perhaps take down Yeosu, should they so desire.
