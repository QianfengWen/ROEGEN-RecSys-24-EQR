Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
-8.70932121.055561 Turelelo Soa Airport (BJW  IATA). This small airport is served by NAM Air and TransNusa operate flights to and from the provincial capital Kupang, while Wings Air operates flights to and from Labuan Bajo. Susi Air flies with small planes between Bajawa and Waingapu on the island of Sumba.   
By bus[edit]
All buses from Labuan Bajo stop here for the night before leaving the next morning, but you might as well stay an extra day and make a tour of it. The cheapest option from Labuan Bajo appears to be the Gemini bus (Rp150,000), which leaves at around 05:30 from the ferry jetty — free hotel pick-up can be arranged. Expect a long and bumpy ride with little comfort. However, the incredible scenery and friendly passengers and passers-by compensate a lot.
Gunung Mas offers the ride from Labuan Bajo for Rp200,000, or Rp110,000 from Ruteng in a quite luxury 12 to 15-seat busses (as of Nov 2018).
Public buses stop at the junction from where bemos wait to take you the 2 km into town. Expect to be asked to pay Rp10,000 although less should suffice. Bus to Ende is Rp50,000.

By car[edit]
Shared taxi or travel will take about seven hours by road from Labuan Bajo, 260 km (160 mi) to the west; or four hours from Ruteng, from Ende to the east, 120km (3h 13 min).

There are many "tourist guides" in Bajawa. None of them are in any way trained, and their primary skills are speaking English and overcharging. The best you can do is stay clear of them and just hire a motorbike (Rp100,000) or charter a bemo for the day (Rp300,000) and see the villages at your own pace.
There is an official, and very helpful, tourist information service in the mayor's office. There are also many touts that have shops with "Tourist Information" signs printed on them. Don't be fooled by them: the real tourist information will not try to sell you anything.

 Traditional villages. The most famous villages are: Bena, Gurusina, and Tololela. Although clearly a tourist destination, the villages house regular people, doing everyday things. Some are weaving ikat, others are simply tending to their livestock. It is okay to be photograph the villagers, but of course ask first. Bring around Rp1,000,000 if you would like to get woven cloth. There is no ATM nearby. Rp20,000-Rp25,000, depending on the village (as of Nov 2018).. (updated Nov 2018)
 Traditional fighting or dancing (not at the same time). This is not a show put on for tourists. However, it is a show. People from the villages gather to fight. The rules seem to be that there are no rules, and so it is difficult to determine a winner. A fight continues for as long as the audience is entertained and the fighters are willing to continue. Ask at your hotel if there is something scheduled. This traditional fight called "sagi" is similar to boxing. The game happens only once or twice in a year in So'a village. 
 Inerie volcano. The Mt Inerie volcano is an impressive volcano located close to Bajawa. There is a nice viewpoint from the radio-station. It is possible to climb the volcano with a guide but this should not be taken lightly. 
 Oggi Waterfalls. Based around Oggi village. It is possible to walk from the main road along the rice-fields till you get to the waterfall. There are also steps on the side of the waterfall that allows climbing up. 
-8.708835121.0868341 Mangeruda Hot Spring. After a long day of traditional culture, it feels nice to plummet into the hot springs. There are 2 pools (as in man-made pools) with hot springs, and one that flows into a river mixing the water to a comfortable warm temperature. There is an overpriced shop there, so it's better to stop along the way for some ice cold Bintang to enjoy in the pools. The place is poorly maintained, but the spring is still hot. Rp10,000. (updated Oct 2016)
-8.883956121.0034152 Malanage Hot Spring. The hot volcanic water flows in a river and mixes with cold mountain water creating a natural hot spring. By careful positioning yourself in the river it is possible to regulate the temperature. There are no tourist facilities apart from a changing-room/toilet pavilion. Snacks and beverages can be purchased from the small Warung besides the river. Rp14,000 (as of Nov 2018). (updated Nov 2018)
-8.740653120.9770033 Wawomudha ("Mini Kelimutu"). After an easy one hour hike up with some nice views, you get to see two small volcanic ponds which apparently change color just like the Kelimutu lakes. This is in no way comparable to Kelimutu and can be disappointing in the dry season. Rp10,000. (updated Oct 2016)
-8.835339120.9795744 Wolobobo Viewpoint. 9 km away from town center, this viewpoint overlooks Mt Inerie and the surrounding mountainous area. You can see the crater from the previous eruption long ago. No food & beverage facility (or anything of that sort). Rp10,000 (as of Nov 2018). (updated Nov 2018)

Also, just like the cold area Ruteng, arak is popular drink (also called moke here).
