Lurgan is a town historically in County Armagh in Northern Ireland - those counties have been abolished as units of government so it's now part of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon District. In Irish An Lorgain means "the shin", indicating a long low ridge, which affords drier ground for travel and settlement. The town stands near the shore of Lough Neagh, 18 miles southwest of Belfast and is industrial. In 2011 its population was about 25,000.


Understand[edit]
A fair Town, consisting of 42 Houses, all of which are inhabited with English Families, and the streets all paved clean through also to water Mills, and a Wind Mill, all for corn
- William Brownlow, who laid out the town from 1610
The transport route from Belfast to Dublin swings southwest to avoid the Mourne Mountains, so the strip through Moira, Lurgan and Portadown became built-up and industrial from the 17th century. Lurgan was laid out by Brownlow as a "Plantation" settlement from 1610, with characteristic wide streets, and a market and linen trade. The settlers were Protestants, but employment also drew in Catholics moving off the land, especially during the famine years, so Lurgan became an "interface area". It also became part of the commuter-belt for Belfast when the railway arrived. In the late 20th century Lurgan was roiled by "The Troubles", driven as much by collapse of the textile trade as by sectarian differences. A nearby New Town of Craigavon never entirely got built but several of its modern features (such as bicycle paths) infiltrated Lurgan, and Ulster's first motorway arrived.
