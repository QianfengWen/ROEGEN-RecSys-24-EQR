Magome (馬籠宿, Magome-juku) is a post town in Gifu. One of the most visited places in the Kiso Valley, Magome has been beautifully restored as an Edo Era post town and stone walkways line the town. Magome served as an important stop on the Nakasendo, a route that connected Tokyo and Kyoto.


Understand[edit]
Nakasendo running through Magome
Magome, the 43rd post town of the Nakasendo long flourished as a stop for travellers and merchants traveling between Tokyo and Kyoto on the Nakasendo. Travelers were usually forced to walk the Nakasendo by the shogunate during the Edo Period and Magome along with other post towns served as rest points for said travellers. Since then much of the town has been restored to help retain its appearance as an Edo post town though some will argue that it is over embellished and inferior to neighbouring Tsumago which is much more rugged and authentic. Visitors can still walk the Nakasendo and the most popular option is the Magome-Tsumago trail which is still preserved with cobblestone. One of the most important figures in Magome's history is Shimazaki Toson, a Meiji era author whose book "Before the Dawn" describes life in Magome during the Meiji period. Along with Tsumago, Magome is the most visited post town on the Nakasendo and one should expect to see other tourists even during the off-season, however they will mostly be domestic tourists.

Get in[edit]
By public transport[edit]
The only way to access Magome by Public Transport is by bus. Both long and short distance buses service Magome. The most common way to access Magome is by taking a train to Nakatsugawa station (75 min from Nagoya by rapid train, ¥1,340) and then taking the Kitaena Bus M line from Nakatsugawa to Magome (Every 1-2 hrs, 30 min, ¥570). Buses run to the 35.52466137.565351 Main Bus Stop at the southern side of the preserved area. One can also take a taxi from Nakatsugawa Station for ¥3,000. Nakatsugawa Station is located on the JR Chuo Main Line, with direct train services to Nagoya, Nagano and Matsumoto.
Highway buses operating through the area stop at the Chūōdō Magome (中央道馬籠) bus stop on the Chūō Expressway, located at the Misaka Parking Area rest stop (a 15-minute walk to the center of town). Hourly buses from Nagoya to Iida stop here (1 hr 45 min, ¥2,000). JR bus offers a few daily buses from Tokyo Station and Shinjuku Station, taking 5–6 hours (¥4,710 from Tokyo Station by day bus, ¥5,800 by night bus). Keio Bus and Meitetsu Bus operate two daily trips from Shinjuku, taking around 4 hours (fares starting at ¥4,900).
On some weekends and holidays, Meitetsu Bus runs one round-trip bus from Nagoya to the center of town. The approximately 2-hour trip leaves Nagoya at 9:20, with the return trip leaving Magome at 15:45 (The bus also continues to nearby Tsumago). The fare is ¥2,500 each way.

By car[edit]
The only highway that runs through Magome is Route 19 which connects Nagoya with Nagano.  Many other highways run through nearby Nakatsugawa and one will transfer there if coming from any other major city; the nearest car rentals are also in Nakatsugawa.

By plane[edit]
The nearest airport to Magome is Chubu Centrair International Airport in Nagoya. There is no direct connection between Nagoya's airport and Magome, so one will have to transfer in Nagoya and travel by either public transport or car to finally arrive at the post town.

By foot[edit]
Because Magome flourished as a post town where travellers would stop while walking from Tokyo to Kyoto, the town is very walkable, much of the towns walking path have been preserved with cobblestone.

You could travel around the city by car, but it's not necessary as most sites are near the Nakasendo, a walking street with no parking spots on it and the short distances encourage walking.
