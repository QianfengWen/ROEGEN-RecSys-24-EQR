Fossa Carolina is a former 3 km long channel between Altmühl and the Rezat built in 793 near Treuchtlingen. It effectively connected the river systems of the Rhein heading to the North sea with the Danubian river system going to the Black Sea. This was the first of three attempts to connect the two rivers (a later one in the 19th century failed due to competition from railways, the current one dates to 1992).
