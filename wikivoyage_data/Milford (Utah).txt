Understand[edit]
Name[edit]
"Milford" is an abbreviated form of "mill" and "ford."

History[edit]
Settlers established ranches in the area in the 1870s, but the construction of the San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad in 1880 brought about development in Milford. A road was constructed from Milford to Beaver, Utah by works from a nearby CCC camp during the Great Depression.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Although Milford is not a very large town, those who enter it from the sparsely populated region to the west via State Route 21 will see it as a great, thriving city compared to the lack of development in the surrounding regions. It is also notable for being a farming region in the Great Basin.
