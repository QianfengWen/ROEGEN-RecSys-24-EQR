The Mayflower II in Plymouth Harbor, which usually is flying the flag of Great Britian, and England.
Plymouth is on the South Shore of Massachusetts. Known as "America's Hometown," Plymouth is most famous for being the final landing place of the Pilgrims who arrived on board the Mayflower in 1620, after storms lead them away from their desired settlement, the Hudson River. The settlement they established, Plimoth Colony, was one of the earliest successful settlements of Europeans in North America.
In addition to its obvious historical draws, modern-day Plymouth is a picturesque seaside town with a bustling summer resident population who come back year after year to enjoy its beaches, ponds, and forests. Although summer is Plymouth's peak tourist season, spring (before Memorial Day) and fall (after Labor Day) can be excellent times to visit. These bumper seasons are less crowded and certainly more comfortable temperature-wise. Spring has mild temperatures and flowers in bloom, and fall has beautiful New England foliage, warm days with cool nights, and different events to explore, such as observing a cranberry harvest.


Understand[edit]
Plymouth is the largest town in the state of Massachusetts, by both area and population. It had a population of about 61,200 in 2020. Because of this, the town is often divided into neighborhoods, which all have different characteristics. The center of tourist activity is in Plymouth's historic downtown and waterfront neighborhoods, and other villages include Manomet, North Plymouth, and West Plymouth. Although somewhat homogeneous on the surface, each village has its own unique characteristics which makes it worth venturing outside the harbor-side to visit. 

North Plymouth was once home to the Cordage Company, the largest rope-maker in the world. Cordage employed many Italian and Portuguese immigrants who settled in company housing in this part of town, which many of their descendants still proudly call home. The Holy Ghost Festa, a major holiday for Portuguese of Azorean descent, is still widely celebrated in North Plymouth each summer.
Manomet is home to White Horse Beach, and a small downtown area of its own, including its own post office, fire station and many businesses.
West Plymouth is home to many strip malls and the larger Colony Place area, and is arguably the most commercialized section of town.
Chiltonville is home to the Plimoth Patuxet Museum and is almost exclusively residential.
Plymouth Beach and Wellingsley are located between Manomet and the downtown area, and include some hotels and businesses, but are still mostly residential and quiet
Plymouth still has many residents who can trace their ancestry to the original Mayflower passengers and/or Native American tribes. Plymouth receives many visitors who are interested in researching their own colonial ancestry, and provides several key resources for doing so. The General Society of Mayflower Descendants Library[dead link] is the recognized authority on Pilgrim ancestry and has plenty of resources to assist you. Plymouth Public Library also maintains a large room dedicated to genealogy.

The Pilgrim Mother
It should go without saying that Plymouth residents feel Thanksgiving Day belongs to them; after all, the holiday commemorates a feast shared by the surviving Mayflower passengers and local Native Americans following the Pilgrims' first harvest in 1621. Thanksgiving in Plymouth isn't celebrated that much differently than in most places, however: local activities include a morning parade through town and a local high school football game between cross-town rivals Plymouth North and Plymouth South. For tourists, Plimouth Plantation offers a Thanksgiving Dinner on location at their site with the opportunity to learn more about the facts and fictions surrounding the historical event. Since 1970, the United American Indians of New England (UAINE) have observed the National Day of Mourning on Thanksgiving Day. Observance takes place annually at noon on Cole's Hill, acknowledging European settlement as the beginning of the genocide and forcible relocation of millions of Native Americans.
As a final note, "Plimoth", the old English spelling, is sometimes used to denote a historic site (e.g. Plimoth Plantation), while town sites will be spelled with the modern spelling, "Plymouth" (e.g. Plymouth Town Hall). Keep this in mind to avoid confusion if you notice signage such as the exit marker on Route 3 that helpfully reads, "Plymouth / Plimoth Plantation."

Get in[edit]
Plymouth makes an excellent day trip (or several days' trip) when exploring the Boston, Providence, or Cape Cod areas.

By car[edit]
Plymouth covers four exits along Route 3, extending from Exit 12 (serving Manomet) to Exit 16 (serving the Route 44 expressway). Downtown Plymouth is accessed via Exit 15A, and the strip malls and hotels of West Plymouth are accessible via US-44 west. Metered parking is available downtown at both public lots and on street. The lots often have ticketing machines while street spots have individual meters. All parking fills up quickly during summer tourist season and during events such as festivals and parades. Get an early start or plan to do a lot of circling to find a spot.
From Boston and points north: Plymouth is about an hour south of Boston, Massachusetts via Interstate 93 South to Route 3 South. Traffic is notorious during weekday rush hours, especially in the summer months where Route 3 is congested with vacationers heading south past Plymouth towards Cape Cod. Travel in off-peak hours is strongly advised for an enjoyable and timely trip. Route 3A, a two-lane back road which runs parallel to Route 3 from Boston down through the  South Shore and directly through Plymouth, was the original road from Plymouth to Boston prior to the national highway system being built in the 1950s. Although quite scenic, it is a lengthy drive and not typically worth traveling the entire route.
From Providence, Rhode Island and points west: Plymouth is connected to the west via Route 44, which runs into the western part of Plymouth through Carver. Major interstates to the west such as Interstate 95 connect somewhat haphazardly with Plymouth via I93/Route 3 on the more northern part of I95, and I495/Route 44 on the more southern end.
From Cape Cod and points south: Plymouth connects to the Cape via Route 6 over the Sagamore Bridge, which turns into Route 3 North. It is also accessible via Route 28 on the Cape, which goes over the Bourne Bridge. From Bourne, you can take Route 6 to connect to Route 3 North, or continue north on I495 to Route 44.

By plane[edit]
41.9089-70.72891 Plymouth Municipal Airport (PYM  IATA), 246 South Meadow Road. This airport is home to over 170 aircraft, most of which are one to ten seat, single or twin engine planes. Although the airport mainly serves pilot hobbyists and Cessna-style aircraft, Boston Med Flight, the State Police Air Wing, and the Plymouth County Fire Plane are also based there.   
For those who don't wish to pilot themselves into town, travelers arriving by plane usually land at Boston's Logan International Airport (BOS IATA). Coach bus and MBTA rail connections can be made from Boston Logan to the Plymouth area. Other travelers may elect to arrive at Rhode Island's T.F. Green Airport (PVD IATA) as flights are often cheaper, but there are no direct public transit options to Plymouth from  Warwick.

By train[edit]
There is no train service to Plymouth. The nearest station is Kingston station on the Kingston Commuter Rail line. It's about 5 mi (8.0 km) from Plymouth Rock, roughly a 15-min drive or 30-min bike ride.

By bus[edit]
Motor coach service from Boston's South Station and Logan Airport to the exit 5 service plaza on Route 3 is available via the Plymouth and Brockton Street Railway Co. The bus service continues south after the Plymouth stop to Cape Cod, and is used often by residents commuting into the city. Parking for the bus at the exit 5 plaza is free, and there is a McDonald's located at the exit 5 area, as well as an ATM and pay phones. The plaza is not a walkable distance to any particular location, however, so it is advisable to plan to take a GATRA bus or a taxi to your final destination.

By boat[edit]
Ferry service to Plymouth from Provincetown on Cape Cod is available via the Plymouth-Provincetown Fast Ferry. Seasonal ferry service runs June through September, seven days a week. The ferry departs and arrives in Plymouth at the state pier on Water Street in the heart of downtown Plymouth, and all downtown attractions and hotels are within walkable distance.

Get around[edit]

The main tourism areas are all very walkable, especially if you are staying at one of the downtown or waterfront area hotels. The "Pilgrim Path" is similar in design to the Freedom Trail in Boston, taking you on a self-guided walking tour past most of the major historical sights downtown. The trail is designated by painted little Pilgrim hats along the sidewalk. You can pick up a pamphlet guide, Pilgrim Path, A Walk Through History at the Visitor Center[dead link] on Water St. There you can also speak with helpful staff, pick up local maps, and purchase postcards, cameras, and tour tickets.
The downtown area also has a few, but not extensive, public transit options:

 GATRA Buses. Best way to access different points in town, including the villages outside the downtown area via multiple routes. Wheelchair accessible. Runs daily; times vary based upon day of the week and the route. 
 America's Hometown Trolley. Daily 10AM-5PM. Runs only during the summer tourist season. Offers an all-day hop on/hop off fare or one way trips. Route begins and ends at Plymouth Rock and loop includes Plimoth Plantation and Plymouth Beach, which are not easy to walk to. Loop also includes the John Carver Inn and the Best Western Cold Spring, which is convenient for visitors staying at those locations. 
Outside of downtown, a car remains the easiest way to travel between points of interest. Most visitors arrive in Plymouth via car, so this is not an issue, but if you are without a ride renting a car for the day is your best bet. Several car rental agencies are located in the downtown area.

There are many historical sites in the downtown area within walking distance; the most popular are listed below.

A historical farm and educational site renowned among academic historians and history-recreation buffs alike. Includes a 1627 living history reenactment of early colonial life where visitors can roam the village, enter the homes, and interact with colonists who stay in character. If visiting in summer, find a Plantation employee to describe the various home garden plants and what they were used for - the explanations are fascinating! There is also a recreation of a Wampanoag homesite of the period staffed with interpreters who trace their ancestry to Native tribes, although they will speak with visitors as themselves rather than as characters. You can also visit a 17th century craft center and observe various clothing, candles, pottery, and other items being made by hand using traditional techniques.

Created in the early 1920s, the park covers the original garden plot that was granted to Elser William Brewster in 1620. Located in the park are several historical monuments, as well as a pretty nature walk along Town Brook, which originally supplied water to the colony. Events are held here often, including a rubber ducky race down the brook. Free. 
Burial Hill
41.956-70.66612 Burial Hill Cemetery, Behind First Church at the top of Leyden St (climb steps to right of First Church; there is another entrance next to the John Carver Inn), ☏ +1 508 830-4078. One of the oldest cemeteries in America containing graves of several Mayflower passengers, many early settlers, and some interesting epitaphs. High spot with nice views of downtown and the harbor.

41.96-70.67611113 National Monument to the Forefathers, Allerton St (off Court Street). Always open. Thought to be the world's largest solid granite monument, it stands over 80 ft (24 m) tall and was erected in 1889. The monument faces northeast towards Plymouth Harbor (and, roughly, towards Plymouth, England). Free.   
41.9585-70.66214 Plymouth Rock and Pilgrim Memorial State Park, Water St, ☏ +1 508 747-5360. Always available. Pilgrim Memorial State Park commemorates the landing site of the Pilgrims in 1620 and contains several historical monuments, a craft shop run by Plimoth Plantation, and the portico enshrining Plymouth Rock. Locals will roll their eyes if you express disappointment with the fact that Plymouth Rock is, in fact, just a rock. "What did you expect?" is the reaction you are likely to receive. To be fair, the rock is small, with the year "1620" engraved on it as its only decoration. The rock was once much larger, weighing over 20,000 lb (9,100 kg). It was displayed at several different locations in town over several hundred years, but was broken in half by transport and several large pieces of it were taken or sold. A 40-lb. piece resides in the Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims in Brooklyn Heights, New York. Smaller pieces were reportedly chipped off and stolen as "souvenirs." The surviving Plymouth Rock is only 1/3 of the upper half of the original stone, so keep that in mind before passing judgement.

Cultural activities[edit]
41.95985-70.668611 Plymouth Philharmonic Orchestra, 16 Court St, ☏ +1 508 746-8008. Concert season runs from Sept-May with performances at Memorial Hall. The off season includes a July Fourth free concert on the waterfront, annual gala, and other events.

41.93106-70.557585 Bonfire Night. Manomet village's annual July 3rd festival, celebrated by setting giant bonfires ablaze on Priscilla, White Horse, and Manomet beaches and amateur fireworks displays so numerous one might be convinced fireworks aren't illegal in Massachusetts (they are). This tradition dates back to the 1700s, and is not organized or sanctioned by the town past emergency services setting some limits in the 1990s: permits are now needed for the larger fires, attempts are made to confiscate fireworks, the beaches are patrolled by police on foot, by boat, and by helicopter, and White Horse Beach is cleared by police at 11PM. Despite earning a somewhat bad reputation after trouble-causing out-of-towners overran the parties in the 1990s, today's Bonfire Nights are relatively family-friendly and the town makes every effort to restrict the festivities to residents-only. The majority of the beaches are private and access to them is restricted anyway, and roads leading to and parking anywhere near the beach access points is blocked by police the day of the festival.  If you want the chance to experience this unique local tradition, make friends with a local who lives in the area or secure a rental property with access to one of these beaches during this period. 
41.96929-70.692936 Holy Ghost Festa, 12 S Cherry Street.

Parks and beaches[edit]
Plymouth is an excellent choice for a Cape Cod-style beach or camping/hiking vacation without the hassle of traveling down the Cape or to the western part of the state. Although many people visit Plymouth once for its history, those that come back summer after summer do so for its "get outside, get wet, get sandy, and have a blast" attitude during its short warm weather season.
Most beaches in Plymouth are private with access allowed only to shoreline residents or neighborhood associations. The best way to access these beaches is by staying at a B&B or a cottage rental that comes with private beach access privileges. However, the public beaches are no worse in quality and only come with the relatively minor inconveniences of finding parking or sharing the beach with strangers. Ocean beaches are not the only option; it's said Plymouth has 365 ponds - "One for every day of the year!" as locals like to say - where swimmers can enjoy water temperatures that are a little kinder than the often frigid Northern Atlantic.

Outdoor sport[edit]
Fishing and boating[edit]
Saltwater fishing for bluefish and striped bass is excellent just off the coast of Plymouth in late summer and early fall. Cod, haddock, pollock, tuna, mackerel, flounder, tautog and smelt are also caught in the area. Many people simply cast off the jetty in the harbor or from local beaches, but boat rentals and bait are available at Town Wharf for fishing in the harbor area. Freshwater fishing is available in Plymouth's many ponds; Long Pond is stocked with trout, as well as smallmouth and largemouth bass. Great Herring Pond has bass and pickerel. A concrete boat ramp is maintained at Long Pond. Some boats can also be launched at the very shallow south end of Great Herring Pond. Fishing is also possible throughout the Myles Standish State Forest in West Plymouth.
Fishing permits are required for recreational saltwater fishing and lobstering for those 16 years old and older. Several New England state permits also are valid in Massachusetts for saltwater fishing. Shellfishing is regulated by the town of Plymouth rather than the state; check the town's website for up-to-date requirements. If you want the experience without the hassle, several boating companies will take you out for deep sea fishing with no licenses required.
Fishing licenses are required for freshwater fishing for those 15 years old and older.

Stay safe[edit]
In Plymouth dial 911 if there is an emergency. This free call will summon police, medical, and fire services to assist you.
Crime is relatively low for a town of Plymouth's size, but take the normal precautions and don't leave your belongings unattended in public spaces, such as public beaches. Plymouth has been a part of the region's larger opiate epidemic, but you are unlikely to encounter many drug-related problems in any of the major tourist areas. However, keep an eye out for spent hypodermic needles which can be found alongside roads or on beaches.
Most beaches in Plymouth do not have lifeguards and many experience drastic tidal differences as sandbars are numerous. Follow the advice of locals and check tidal calendars before venturing off too far onto mudflats or long walks around bluffs - you may find yourself having to swim back when the beach disappears without much warning! Also take care when boating in the area; unexpected mudflats or large glacial rocks can be closer to the surface at certain tidal points, causing unassuming craft to run aground.
Plymouth has, along with Cape Cod, experienced a drastic rise in great white sharks as the harbor seal population, which is their main source of food, has exploded. Sharks can appear close to shore along Plymouth beaches and have made encounters with some kayakers, though despite knocking them into the water no injuries have been reported. The best defense is to stay alert and understand that the sharks are much more interested in finding seals than hurting you. To avoid being confused for their food, avoid swimming in murky water or anywhere near where seals can be spotted jumping, swimming, or sunbathing. Often times you can hear the seals barking before seeing them. If you spot a shark, exit the water immediately. If at a public beach, follow any warnings given by lifeguards or warning flags which may be posted along the shore.

Stay healthy[edit]
Plymouth has its own fully-equipped hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital, which is the largest facility on the Cape end of the South Shore. Note that this facility was called the Jordan Hospital for over 100 years from its opening in 1901 until 2014. It is very common for locals to still refer to the hospital as "Jordan"; i.e. "They're taking him to Jordan," when referring to the Beth Israel facility.

Connect[edit]
Mail services[edit]
Plymouth is a large town with multiple post offices, and as such has multiple zip codes depending on the post office being used:

The main zip code for Plymouth is 02360, and refers to mail being directed to or from the town's central post office at 100 Long Pond Rd.
02345 is the zip code used for P.O. boxes at the main village post office for Manomet, located at 12 Manomet Point Rd.
02381 is the zip code used for P.O. boxes at Manomet's even smaller post office at 119 White Horse Rd on White Horse Beach.
02362 is the zip code used for the village post office in North Plymouth, located at 283 Court St.
Computing and internet access[edit]
Computer, internet use, and wireless printing services are available via the Plymouth Public Library system with day passes available for non-card holders. The main branch is located at 132 South Street and the Manomet branch is located at 12 Strand Avenue.

Local news[edit]
The local newspaper is the Old Colony Memorial, published every Wednesday and Saturday. You can find a copy at most convenience stores, and it is also often available at local hotels.

Go next[edit]
Boston is only about 45 minutes away by car or 30 minutes by commuter rail. Massachusetts' capital city has plenty of attractions for history buffs, such as the Freedom Trail and the USS Constitution. It is also a mecca for sports fans, and no trip is complete without a visit to Fenway Park. There are plenty of cultural attractions such as the Museum of Fine Arts and Museum of Science, and on a beautiful day a stroll through Boston Public Garden and a ride on the Swan Boats is a must. Boston is also a major transport hub, and you can access both its international airport and train and bus connections to other major cities along the East Coast.
Cape Cod, including the towns of  Sandwich, Hyannis, and Provincetown are all a relatively easy drive south from Plymouth, especially in off-peak travel hours. Provincetown can also be accessed from Plymouth by a daily ferry running seasonally from the harbor. The Cape is known for its beaches, and a visit to the Cape Cod National Seashore is highly recommended.
Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, Cape Cod's main islands, can both be accessed via ferry from Hyannis.
Providence, Rhode Island is about 40 minutes away via car. Roger Williams Park and Zoo is a great place to visit and holds many annual events. An evening trip during one of its Waterfire celebrations is also worth experiencing; check out Waterfire.org for their annual schedule and to plan ahead.
From Plymouth to Hampton Roads is a 600-mile historical route through the colonial and antebellum United States.
