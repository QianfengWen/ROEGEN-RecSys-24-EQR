Lake Macquarie is a satellite city of Newcastle with the largest permanent saltwater lake in the Southern Hemisphere.


Understand[edit]

Lake Macquarie is often considered part of its immediate neighbour, Newcastle, but is in fact a separate city with a much larger area and a population of 190,000. It has a number of suburbs including:

Belmont is largely centred around the lake foreshore and the Pacific Highway. The southern suburbs (Belmont South, Marks Point) are rather flat and only a few metres above sea level. The northern suburbs (Belmont North, Floraville, Jewels) are very hilly and are a challenging bicycle ride.
Charlestown is the self-proclaimed CBD of Lake Macquarie with the region's largest shopping centre, Charlestown Square.
Morisset is a small suburb. A few thousand people turn up each week to see the wild kangaroos from the grounds of a local hospital – but these are wild animals and, if disturbed, may inflict injury by scratching or kicking with their large hind legs. Look and see, but do not feed or disturb the wildlife.
Swansea is located on a peninsula. It has two waterfronts – one on Lake Macquarie and one on the Pacific Ocean, with a population of around 5,000.
Warners Bay is at the north eastern end of Lake Macquarie and is home to a sizeable population and many decent cafes on The Esplanade.
Toronto is the main centre of the western side of the lake.
Get in[edit]
It is easiest to get to Lake Macquarie by car. Take the Pacific Motorway (M1) from Sydney or the Central Coast.
The closest airfield is Lake Macquarie Airfield.
The closest airport is Newcastle Airport, which is itself half an hour north from Newcastle, meaning a one-hour drive from the airport.

By train[edit]
Lake Macquarie is not directly connected to the main train line running parallel to it on the other side of the actual Lake itself. Wyee train station is closest in proximity to the Morisset area, whilst Fassifern is popular amongst those travelling into Toronto. There is no track on the eastern side. However, there used to be a line between Belmont and Adamstown, which is now a popular rail trail (Fernleigh Track).
