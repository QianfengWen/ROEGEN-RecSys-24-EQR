Danville was part of the settlement area around Harrod's Fort (now Harrodsburg) which was the first English permanent settlement in Kentucky. Walker Daniel, Kentucky's first District Attorney, bought land on the Wilderness Road and had it surveyed for a town in 1783-1784. The Virginia legislature established Danville on December 4, 1787.
