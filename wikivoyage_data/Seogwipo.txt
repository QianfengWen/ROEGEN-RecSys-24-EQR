Seogwipo (서귀포시, 西歸浦市) is a city in the southern district of Jeju island. The main city consists of a rather small urban center and port on the coast, directly south of Jeju's most prominent landmark, Hallasan mountain. However, urban sprawl has seen it extend in a thin strip along the coast westwards up to the township of Jungmun and some of the coastal villages beyond.


Understand[edit]
Seogwipo Waterfall
Seogwipo harbour, as seen from downtown.
Covering the entire southern half of Jeju island, Seogwipo, the island's second-biggest city, claims the Jeju International Convention Centre and the Jungmun Tourist Resort Complex with Jeju's fanciest accommodation. Furthermore as one of the many co-hosts of the 2002 FIFA World Cup, it holds the island's only stadium.
Being spread out along a coastline made out of columnar basalt cliffs and beaches interchangeably makes it a somewhat unusual visit. A coastal wander may see you strolling across a busy summer beach one moment and sheepishly striding through incredibly swank hotel grounds the next. Yet equally likely, one could end up traversing rocks alongside sheer cliffs, dark caves and beautiful waterfalls. It is the second-largest city on Jeju Island, with a population of 155,000 in 2011.
Other destinations
Smaller villages dot the coastline and eastern and western interior. Roughly clockwise from Jeju City:
33.384126.87721 Seongsan – village in the east of the island, close for Udo Island and Seongsan Ilchulbong, a volcanic crater. The village has a number of interesting seafood restaurants and can make for a pleasant overnight stay, but there are no nightlife options (apart from a disproportionate number of marts for the size of the village).
33.2262126.47322 Gangjeong – small coastal village just west out of central Seogwipo. Unnoteworthy if not for the fact that it is the proposed site and thus ground zero for the battle over keeping naval bases off Jeju.

Get in[edit]
33°18′46″N 126°34′17″EMap of Seogwipo
By bus[edit]
Buses run from Jeju city on the other side of the island. Seogwipo is a main hub for buses for the southern side of Jeju island and therefore the majority of buses running on this side of the island pass through Seogwipo.
From Jeju beach/downtown area, get bus 100 to the bus terminal. From there, buses leave every 10 minutes to Seogwipo. ₩3,000 takes about an hour

The Airport Limousine (route #600) bus runs from Jeju International Airport to Seogwipo every 15 to 20 minutes. Journey time is about an hour and 20 minutes. Cost is ₩5000 per person (July 2009). The bus makes stops at about 10 locations, including all the five-star hotels in the Jungmun Resort Area. The final destination is at the Sun Motel in Downtown Seogwipo.
Get around[edit]
Downtown Seogwipo to Jungmun.
Seogwipo is spread out in a thin line along the coast from Seogwipo downtown to the east and Jungmun to the west along the main arterial road, Ilju-ro (Highway #1132).

By bus[edit]
Like it's northern counterpart, Jeju City, Seogwipo has its own inner-city (shinnae) bus system. Almost all of the buses take the same route along the highway between downtown and Jungmun, but tend to branch out at either end, servicing even a few of the smaller villages such as Daeepyeong-ri in the south-west of the island. In the downtown district there are a pair of bus "terminals" located around a main traffic roundabout from which most depart downtown, else just make your way to the highway. Inner-city buses cost ₩1000.
Long distance inter-city buses mostly follow the same route along the highway as inner-city ones and can also be used to get around. The cost is a little higher but they are faster, only stopping at major locations before zipping out of town to Jeju City. These long distance buses look more like tour buses than the city buses and go pretty much anyhere on Jeju. Seogwipo has two inter-city terminals. The main inter-city terminal is in the south-east of downtown, near the Jeongbang Waterfall. The second is to the right of the E-mart in front of the World Cup Stadium (tucked in the back of a rather nondescript building). In practicality however, you can get just get on from one of the larger bus stops on either side of the highway around the stadium or Jungmun, and or at the traffic roundabout in downtown.

By taxi[edit]
Taxis are also an option – most places are happy to call one for you. However, if you're planning to travel the full 25 km from Jungmun to downtown, you may find the bill a bit steep.

By motorcycyle[edit]
There are one or two places that rent scooters in Seogwipo.

On foot[edit]
The main city area of Seogwipo, World Cup Stadium and Jungmun all lie in a 25- to 30-km-long thin strip along the coast. Whilst it is downright easy to wander each of the three key areas individually, walking between them would be inconvenient. Having said that, the Jeju Olle hiking trails do run along the coast in this region.
Most places can be comfortably walked to from the nearest highway stop.

The strange rock cliffs surrounded like a folding screen and the clear water flowing leisurely from the flat bedrock create a stylish atmosphere.

At first glance, Seogwipo's answer to the infamous Loveland, this attraction actually lives up to its title: a museum. A museum that has amassed genuine erotic works of art from the world over and put them on display next to a pile of cheaply Photoshopped "flowers" and some Japanese pornography playing in a traditional house-front with holes poked in the paper screens... but a museum nonetheless. As no information at all is in English a fun game to play is to guess the country of origin of a piece based on how violent the acts depicted are (Hint: the spectrum runs from Chinese at one extreme to Japanese at the other, use clothing styles to check answers.) Probably not a place for children. Check out the 12 vases of the animal-love zodiac. ₩7000.

Track and Field activities[edit]
Hiking. 33.1978126.29193 Songaksan Mountain (송악산). It is a good path to walk while looking at the scenery as the mountains and the sea are harmonized. You can see "Brothers Island, Gapado Island, and Marado Island" the closest, and it is a great place to walk along the promenade while enjoying rape flowers in spring and reeds in autumn.

Climbing. 33.4581126.94254 Seongsan Ilchulbong (성산 일출봉). is one of the most famous tourist attractions in Jeju Island and is a good place to climb. It also gives a similar feeling to Hallasan Baeknokdam. It lies at the end of Seongsan Peninsula, which protrudes to the east of Jeju. Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak is a water-based volcano created by magma erupting from the water, unlike other oreum on Jeju Island. As the hot magma emitted during volcanic activity met with cold seawater, volcanic ash contained a lot of moisture and became sticky, and Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak was piled up in layers.

Buy[edit]
Jeju Hallabong

Jeju hallabong (citrus fruit akin to an oversized tangerine) are grown predominantly on the southern side of the island so they are both most abundant and cheap from roadside stalls around Seogwipo.
Eat[edit]
Being a coastal city on an island, expect the hoe (회, sashimi) to be excellent.
Downtown Seogwipo contains mostly Korean-style restaurants. To illustrate, even the E-mart food court is strictly Korean fare. In the main circle in town there is a coffee shop/restaurant that has some western dishes prepared in a Korean way on the second floor. It has pictures of famous westerners lining the restaurant.
A great more upmarket restaurants, catering to foreign tastes, can be found in and around the Jungmun Tourist Resort Complex.
An interesting culinary option around Seogwipo is sea cucumber.

 Red Marin. Across the water from Milano in downtown Seogwipo, towards the harbor, is a small waterfront bar called Red Marin. The exterior of the bar looks like an old ship, complete with lights hung over an old mast. Inside, a small store serves as the restaurant, where you can choose from a large selection of Korean alcohols. Grab a table by the water if you can, and enjoy the view. 
 Gecko's Terrace, 2156-3 Seakdal-dong, Jungmun (about a 10-minute walk west of the information booth and inner-city bus stop outside Jungmun Tourist Resort Complex; buses finish well before midnight and taxis back to downtown Seogwipo are costly so plan ahead), ☏ +82 64-739-0845, fax: +82 64-738-7903.

Go next[edit]
Jeju City, the capital of the province, is easily accessible by bus. But you already know this, because you must have come through Jeju City to get to Seogwipo. Until the Seogwipo airport gets built (if ever), the only places to go next are elsewhere in Jeju.
