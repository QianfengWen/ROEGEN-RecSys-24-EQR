For the mining village in Northern Ontario, see Geraldton (Ontario).
Geraldton is the chief city of the  Mid-West region of Western Australia. It's a busy port and coastal resort, and in 2018 had a population of 37,648.


Understand[edit]
People have lived in this area for 40,000 years, those since the time of European contact being the Yamatji or Wajarri Aboriginals. In 1848 lead ore was discovered a little way north and the town grew up, being named for Charles Fitzgerald (1791-1887) the State governor. Crucially, Geraldton had a harbour - these are few and far between on this hazardous coastline.
Its industries were metal ore mining along with livestock and fishing, and these remain.
Geraldton was transformed in the 1960s when the Brand Highway was sealed (tarmacked) all the way from Perth, so that bumpy dusty 420 km (260 miles) became one day's easy drive. The city's main interest to travellers is therefore as an overnight stopover, but it has a range of tourist attractions in its own right, especially water sports.
Geraldton Visitor Centre is in the Bill Sewell Complex, central in town on Chapman Road. It's open M-F 9AM-4PM, Sa Su 9:30AM-1:30PM.

Get in[edit]

That tarmac highway spelt the end of passenger rail services to Geraldton, and of the coastal passenger steamers.

By plane[edit]
-28.7961114.70751 Geraldton Airport (GET  IATA), Mount Magnet Rd (10 km east of town), ☏ +61 8 9956 6600. Qantas fly twice a day from Perth, taking an hour, so a day-trip either way is possible; in 2022 you might pay $230 each way. Virgin no longer fly here. The terminal has a small cafe. Car hire is available but must be pre-booked. It's a pity they didn't name this airport for its locality, Moonyoonooka; imagine the flight announcements. There's no public transport to downtown, reckon $30 for a taxi. Taxi transfers are also available to outlying towns such as Greenough and Dongara.   (updated Apr 2022)

By car[edit]
Indian Ocean Drive / Highway 60 (423 km from Perth to Geraldton) was upgraded in 2010 and for light vehicles is the shorter, pleasanter route; but fill up on fuel as it can be hard to find along the way. Freeway 2 northbound from Perth leads straight into State Route 60, passing by  Pinnacles (Nambung) National Park, Cervantes, Jurien Bay and Lesueur National Park, to join Brand Highway just south of Dongara.
Brand Highway 1 (440 km) is the fastest, most direct route. So it has filling stations and is the trucking route, and these huge Road Trains will require your full attention. Much of the highway is only one lane each way, so overtaking these juggernauts or being overtaken by them is hazardous, especially at night.
A historic route follows the former Midland Railway, travelling through the small towns of Moora, Three Springs and Watheroo.
Driving from the north-west, follow Highway 1, and from inland approach via Mullewa.
By bus[edit]
TransWA buses ply 2 or 3 times a day between Perth and Geraldton, taking 6 hours, for a single fare of $70. They run along Hwy 1 past Dongara and Greenough, or via coastal Hwy 60 through Lancelin, Cervantes and Jurien Bay to rejoin Hwy 1 at Dongara. Slower routes swing inland via New Norcia and Moora, or via Northam and Wubin. One bus a day continues from Geraldton to Northampton and Kalbarri. Twice a week a bus runs inland to Mount Magnet and Meekathara on the Great Northern Highway. 
Integrity Coaches run three days a week via the coast towns to Geraldton, and continue to Carnarvon, Coral Bay,  Exmouth, Port Hedland and Broome. 
-28.77114.61322 Geraldton Railway Station hasn't seen a train since 1975, but it's where the buses bring you.

Get around[edit]
Memorial to HMAS Sydney
The main sights of Geraldton are fairly central, and easy to reach on foot, especially once the sea breeze gets up to offset the heat.
There are eight local bus routes, which you might take for the outlying beaches. Bus 800 circles downtown every 30 min, the others run roughly hourly daytime:

Buses 850 and 851 go north up Chapman Rd to Spalding and Sunset Beach.
Bus 853 goes east to the racecourse.
Buses 854 and 855 go south to Tarcoola Beach and Wandina.
Bus 856 goes to the West End, Beachlands and Lighthouse.
Local buses don't reach nearby towns such as Greenough, Dongara or Northampton; for these take the TransWA coach.
Car hire is available from Avis, Hertz, Budget, Thrifty and others. You need wheels to explore Kalbarri or get up to Shark Bay / Monkey Mia.
Geraldton Associated Taxis are on +61 131008.
Bike hire is available from Revolutions at 268 Marine Terrace. Geraldton Bikes at 164 Chapman Rd don't hire but are excellent for spares and repairs.

-28.7827114.5796 Point Moore Lighthouse was built from 1877, though the first attempt was bungled and they had to start over. It's a 35 m candy-stripe metal tower, made in Birmingham, England and shipped out in sections for local assembly. It was automated in 1975 and remains in use, with a range of 42.6 km. No public access, but lighthouse and keepers' artefacts are in the museum.

Kalbarri National Park, turn off at Northampton or Ajana.
Shark Bay and Monkey Mia for water sports and dolphins.
Carnarvon, a good stopover on the way further north towards Coral Bay and  Exmouth.
East on Highway 123 snakes inland through Mullewa and Mount Magnet to join the Great Northern Highway, for Port Hedland and Broome. 
South on Brand Highway 1 goes through Greenough, a preserved 19th century settlement, and with trees bent at right angles by the winds. Continue south to Dongara, then towards Perth by either the Brand or NW Coastal Highway.
