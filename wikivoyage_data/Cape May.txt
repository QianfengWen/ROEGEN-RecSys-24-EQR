Cape May is in the state of New Jersey, in the United States. It lies at the southernmost point in New Jersey, on the Cape May Peninsula, on the Atlantic Coast. "Cape May" may refer to the small city at the tip of the peninsula, the peninsula itself, or the county which extends about 33 miles northeast of Cape May city to Ocean City. On the other side of the Delaware Bay lies the state of Delaware.

Understand[edit]
Cape May, located at the very southern tip of New Jersey, is a Victorian resort town.  It was the country's first seaside resort and much of the original flavor still exists in the properties and other sites within the city.  Settled by whalers and fishermen in colonial times, the town suffered a devastating fire in 1878 and was rebuilt during the Victorian period.  As a result, Cape May is known for its concentration of Victorian era architecture. It was declared a national historic landmark in 1976.
A canal, dug from a natural shallow creek, runs from Cape May's harbor to the Delaware Bay, which makes Cape May an island. In fact, historically, it's known as Cape Island.
The two main industries within Cape May are tourism and fishing.  Cape May is second to Atlantic City for tourism in the state of New Jersey.  Being at the confluence of the Delaware Bay and the Atlantic Ocean allows Cape May full access to many types of fishing opportunities.
Cape May is also home to the Coast Guard Training Station.
