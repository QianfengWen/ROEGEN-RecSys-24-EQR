Wanning (万宁, Wànníng) is a city on the east coast of China's Hainan Island.


Understand[edit]
The city has been substantially influenced by a wave of Overseas Chinese who immigrated to Wanning from Southeast Asia during the mid-20th century. This is particularly evident in the Xinglong area where most of them originally settled. Xinglong is one of the main tourist areas in Wanning. It is especially famous for its coffee.
Wanning's coastal areas are also quite well-known and compete with Lingshui and Sanya. One specific coastal area, namely Riyue Bay (or Sun and Moon Bay) has emerged as the surfing capital of China and hosts regular surfing events and competitions.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The closest airport is the Qionghai-Bo'ao Airport in the city of Qionghai. From there, you can take a bus or taxi to Qionghai Railway Station and then transfer to a train heading to Wanning. Qionghai-Bo'ao Airport is a small airport, however. Generally speaking, it's easier to get a flight to Haikou or Sanya. The airports in both Haikou and Sanya have their own railway stations with direct train services to Wanning.

By train[edit]
There are two railway stations in Wanning:

18.809271110.3770021 Wanning Railway Station (万宁站), Jianshe North Road (建设北路). Wanning's main railway station. Unusually for Hainan, the station is very close to the city center. (updated Aug 2020)
18.726378110.303722 Shenzhou Railway Station (神州站), National Highway 98, Liji Town (礼纪镇98国道). This station is closer to Xinglong and the coastal resort areas. Train services, however, are less frequent compared with Wanning Station. (updated Aug 2020)
By bus[edit]

18.747115110.2110774 Xinglong Bus Station (兴隆车站), 24 Xinchezhan Road (新车站路24号), ☏ +86 898 62555598. Mainly has bus services to Haikou and Sanya. (updated Aug 2020)
Bus services also link Sanya to Wanning's coastal resort areas, including Riyue Bay and Shimei Bay. However, these places have no formal bus stations, so if you want to go back the same way, you will need to hail a bus from the side of the road.

Get around[edit]
Pratically all tourist destinations in the city can be reached by public bus. Being a small city, however, the buses don't run as often as they do in Haikou or Sanya. Some bus services only run once every 40 to 60 minutes and some only operate a few times a day.
Taxis and motorized pedicabs are also available.
