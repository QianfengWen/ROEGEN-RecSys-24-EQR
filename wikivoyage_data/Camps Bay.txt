Camps Bay is a suburb in Cape Town on the Cape Peninsula of South Africa. Founded as Kamps Baai it was once considered to become Cape Town's harbour. It has become a tourism hot spot because it offers a great combination of restaurants, bars, amenities, accommodation and a fantastic beach, all very close to each other.


Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Follow the coastal road from the Cape Town CBD westwards around Table Mountain or use the beautiful panoramic Chapmans Peak Drive to get there.

By public transport[edit]
There is no public transport yet, so your only choice would be sightseeing tourist buses that stop from time to time to give you the chance to hop off and later on again.

Get around[edit]
Camps Bay can easily be experienced by foot. However if you are staying in at the top of Camps Bay, it can take up to an hour to walk back from the beach. There are plenty of taxis available though, and it is one of the few places in Cape Town where a tourist will not need their own transport.

See[edit]

Buy[edit]
A granadilla lolly on the beach on a sweltering hot summers day! As the ice cream men on the beach will tell you: "a lolly for your dolly!"

Eat[edit]
Camps Bay has a number of restaurants and cafes. In total there are probably about thirty, the majority of which are opposite the beach, stretched along Victoria Road, which is the main road of Camps Bay (runs parallel to the beach front). Some well known restaurants are Theos, Codfather (for seafood) and Summerville.

 Blues. An institution with a very well known brand. The restaurant has been around for a long time. 
 Primi Piatti (on the Llandudno side of Camps Bay). Excellent value and huge portions. 
 The 41, 41 Victoria Road, Camps Bay, ☏ +27 21 437 0558. Beachside restaurant with great seafood and cocktails. 
Drink[edit]
Besides these three bars, just about every restaurant in Camps Bay offers great views, and is a super spot for a drink (or a sundowner as local Capetonians like to call it).

 Cafe Caprice. Very popular with the local trendy crowd, especially on a Sunday night. 


 Karma. An upmarket bar, that is very popular. Wednesdays and Fridays are especially popular. 
 Sapphire (next door to Blues restaurant). A popular sundowner spot that is less pretentious than Caprice.

Camps Bay offers a wide range of accommodation. There is only one large hotel, but there are a proliferation of B&Bs, guesthouses and self-catering villas and apartments. Most tend to be in the higher end of the market; either four-star or five-star, although the guesthouses and self-catering options generally offer far better value than equivalent hotels.
