Scarborough  is a large resort on the North Yorkshire coast in the north of England; it had a population of almost 62,000 in 2011. It has two broad, sandy bays divided by a headland, with confident Victorian hotels ranged above.  


Understand[edit]
A castle was established on the headland in the Norman era, and the town first grew up along the more sheltered South Bay. There was fishing and sea trade, but it wasn't much of a harbour, and Scarborough mostly owes its existence to the strange course of the River Derwent. This arises nearby, but instead of flowing to the coast it turns inland, carving a broad valley between the North York Moors and the Yorkshire Wolds. So this was a natural transport route: for traders heading to Scarborough Fair, for marauding armies including the Normans, Scots and Royalists alternating with Parliamentarians, and above all for holiday-makers. In 1626 one of the springs that bubbled out of the cliffs, staining the rocks with its mineral content, was claimed to have medicinal properties. People flocked for spa cures, from the springs and from sea-bathing. The railway arrived in 1845 and there was a spate of building grand hotels, expanding into North Bay and creating the townscape you see today. Leisure fashions have evolved but Scarborough remains a popular resort because of its ease of access from the industrial cities.

By road[edit]
All routes to Scarborough get very congested on summer weekends. The main approach is along A64, which forks off A1(M) to pass York and Malton. Expect to hit tailbacks just east of York where the dual carriageway narrows to single. 
Other routes are to leave A64 at York for A166 via Stamford Bridge and Bridlington; along A170 (for light vehicles only) from Thirsk and Pickering; from eastern England either via M18 then A614 or via Humber Bridge, Hull and A165; and from the north use A19 past Middlesbrough onto A171 then along the coast through Whitby.
Tune in to This is the Coast on DAB radio for travel reports to confirm that what you are stuck in is indeed a traffic jam. 
Parking in town centre is ample much of the year but fills up quickly in summer. For day trips use the Park and Rides, both south side: on A64 Seamer Road and on A165 Filey Road.

Scarborough Castle
54.2877-0.3842181 Scarborough Castle, Castle Road YO11 1HY, ☏ +44 1723 372451. Daily 10AM-5PM. It's well smashed up, but it's scenically perched on the headland dividing the two bays, and has been a fort since prehistoric times. Much of the ruin is medieval, but it was in use into modern times, and shelled by German warships in 1914. Adult £8.70, child £5.20, conc £7.90.   (updated Jul 2020)
 St Mary's Church, Parish House, 158 Castle Rd YO11 1TH, ☏ +44 1723 500541. This Anglican church is next to the castle, which meant that the Norman / medieval building was wrecked during the Civil War assault on the castle. It was rebuilt in the 17th century and reduced in size during the 19th. In that era, Anne Brontë worked as governess to the Robinson family of Thorp Green near York, and accompanied them on annual holidays to Scarborough. She used its settings in Agnes Grey, and for the fictional village of "Linden-Car" in The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. When her health failed in 1849, she returned to Scarborough in hopes of a cure but died aged 29 and was buried here. Her grave is in the northern end of the churchyard. Free.   (updated Jul 2020)
54.283-0.392 The Harbour is at the north end of South Bay, sheltered by the castle headland from nor'easterly weather. There's a small lighthouse, really just a harbour light, and Luna Park funfair at the east pier end.
54.275-0.4023 St Martin-on-the-Hill, completed in 1863, is the attractive High Anglican church on Albion Road. Panels around the pulpit are by the Pre-Raphaelites.
54.29-0.4114 Peasholm Park is in a glen opening onto North Bay; always open, free, dogs on leads welcome. It has Japanese-themed gardens, a pagoda and a boating lake. A mock naval battle is staged on the lake June Sa, July Th Sa, Aug M Th Sa; adult £4.50, child £2.50.
The Italian Gardens and Rose Garden by the Esplanade overlook South Bay. Some 300 yards south, the grassy bank was the site of the Holbeck Hall Hotel. Many places along this eroded coast have fallen into the sea but this hotel spectacularly did so live on TV news in 1993. The cause was not coastal erosion, but heavy rain liquidising the subsoil, which landslipped. The spot is marked by an information board plus a poignant caption on Google Map: "add a missing place".
54.279-0.4015 Scarborough Art Gallery is in an Italianate villa on The Crescent. Rotating art exhibits, there isn't a permanent collection. It's open Tu-Su 10AM-5PM, adult £3 includes The Rotunda.
The Rotunda 100 yards east on Vernon Road was built in 1829 to display the geology collection of William Smith, who realised one could correlate geological strata by the fossils they contain.  open Tu-Su 10AM-5PM, adult £3 includes the Art Gallery.
54.263-0.4056 Oliver's Mount. This ridge at the south edge of town is a peaceful strolling spot for views over the town, except on race days. It's a motorbike race track of 2.41 miles (3.88 km), with events staged July-Sept.   (updated Jul 2020)
54.299-0.4437 Scalby Beck or The Sea Cut is a partly artificial channel to manage the flow of the River Derwent. This arises in the North York Moors close to the North Sea, but its direct course was blocked by Ice Age mud deposits, so for the last 11,000 years or so it's flowed inland — the River Niger of Yorkshire, with Malton as its Timbuktu. The Derwent has 70 miles (110 km) to flow to reach the tidal Humber with only 135 ft (41 m) to fall, so it's flood-prone. A channel was completed in 1804 to divert water from its upper reaches into the natural Scalby Beck. There are paths along its length.
54.27-0.498 Forge Valley Woods are in the Derwent Valley below the Sea Cut intake. Some of the woodland is 6000 years old. The woods were formerly used for charcoal to fire forges, hence the name, but are now protected as a National Nature Reserve.
Robin Hood's Bay: see Whitby for this picturesque harbour, and for the oddity of Ravenscar, a Victorian attempt to create a beach resort out of a disused alum factory that lacked a beach.

Beaches: South Bay has amusement arcades, a funfair, the harbour, the Spa complex, donkey rides, and all the trappings of a traditional English seaside resort. North Bay, the other side of the castle headland, is quieter and less developed. Both are sandy, and almost completely covered at high tide.

The Cinder Track is the old railway between Scarborough and Whitby. It's suitable for walking, cycling and horse-riding. It winds along the contours a mile or two inland so it has limited sea views but is level going.
Cricket: the cricket ground is on North Marine Road near Peasholm Park. Scarborough CC play in the Yorkshire Premier League North, and Yorkshire CCC occasionally play here.

Scarborough Fair 
"Tell her to make me a cambric shirt / without a seam or needlework...." — the lyric of "Scarborough Fair" probably dates to 17th century. The singer is setting his ex-lover a series of impossible tasks, so there's bitterness and estrangement at the core of it. Its best-known recording was in 1965 by Simon & Garfunkel, interwoven with the anti-war song "Canticle". The real Scarborough Fair was held 1253-1788 from mid-August through September, an unusually extended event, which as well as markets involved amusements and amenities, and time enough to kindle a love affair then bitterly fall out. From time to time there are attempts to revive the Fair, at least in name, but to date they've been defeated by the realities of modern retail and leisure patterns.

"A somewhat eccentric national treasure"
That was the received wisdom about Jimmy Savile when he died in 2011, ripe in years and garlanded with fame and honours. He was buried in Woodland Cemetery in Scarborough with the coffin inclined at 45 degrees "to see the sea". He'd been a miner, wrestler, DJ, marathon runner, indefatigable fundraiser for charity, and all-round larger-than-life character. "Don't you know who I am?" — that was one phrase that had silenced his victims, and those who had sought to raise concern. The story first broke some months after his death, when the BBC suppressed an investigative report on his behaviour. ITV then broadcast claims of abuse by 10 women, very young girls at the time, which led to a deluge of cases, with over 200 proven victims. Savile had preyed on young girls throughout his stage and TV career, and used his charity work to access vulnerable girls at Stoke Mandeville Hospital and elsewhere. In 2014 he was denounced in Parliament as "a callous, opportunistic, wicked predator".
