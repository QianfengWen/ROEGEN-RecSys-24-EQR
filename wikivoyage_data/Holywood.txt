Not to be confused with the Los Angeles district of Hollywood.

Holywood is a town five miles northeast of Belfast in Northern Ireland. It's historically in County Down, but since 2015 has been part of Ards and North Down District, along with Bangor and Newtownards. 


Understand[edit]
Frequent trains run from Belfast
The town's name is pronounced "holly" but means "holy" — the monastery of St Laiseran was established early in the 7th century. An Augustinian priory was built in the 12th century, and these are the ruins you see today. In the early 17th century Holywood was rebuilt as a Plantation market town. Its developers and settlers didn't make much money, until the railway arrived in 1848. It became a commuter town, trippers came out from the city for a day at the seaside, and wealthy industrialists and merchants built their mansions here. Traditional industry slumped in the 20th century and fuelled "The Troubles", but Holywood is not an interface between communities and was only lightly afflicted. It has even managed to attract a textile industry in an era when so many Ulster towns have lost theirs. 
Holywood had a population of 11,257 in 2011. The main attractions are the Folk and Transport Museums two miles east of town at Cultra.

Get in[edit]
For long-distance transport options see Belfast; the city centre is 5 miles southwest of Holywood.
Trains run every 30 min from Portadown and central Belfast stations to Titanic Quarter, Sydenham (for 54.615486-5.8712331 City Airport ), 54.6411-5.83952 Holywood , Marino and Cultra (for Folk and Transport Museums), continuing east to Seahill, Helen's Bay, Carnalea, Bangor West and Bangor.
Ulsterbus 502 runs from Belfast Laganside via Lanyon Place (above the main railway station), Holywood (20 min), Cultra, and on eastwards to Bangor. It runs hourly M-Sa, rarely on Sunday, and doesn't serve Europa bus station except late evening and Sunday.
From City Airport it might be simplest to take a taxi. Bus 3a / 3b runs to Sydenham from central Belfast but then only as far as Knocknagoney retail park, a mile short of Holywood.

Get around[edit]

54.643-5.8311 Holywood Priory is the ruin of a 12th-century Anglo-Norman Augustinian Priory, built over the 7th century monastery at the core of Holy Wood. It affiliated to the Franciscans in the 14th century, was dissolved in 1541 but became the parish church, with the tower added in 1806.
The Martello Tower is 200 yards southeast of the Priory, one of dozens erected around Ireland to watch out for Napoleonic invasion.
The Motte southeast of the Priory is a hummock that in Norman times was fortified by a palisade; there doesn't appear to have been a stone castle here.
