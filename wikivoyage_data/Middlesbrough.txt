Middlesbrough is a port on the River Tees at the north edge of North Yorkshire. It's industrial and in 2021 had a population of 143,900.


Understand[edit]


“

This remarkable place, the youngest child of England’s enterprise, is an infant, but if an infant, an infant Hercules.

”


—William Gladstone in 1862 – he was then Chancellor of the Exchequer, and later four times Prime Minister

In 1801 the population of Middlesbrough was just 25, a farm hamlet. But from 1829 the region's coalfields and iron ores were exploited, and a new port was needed to ship them. The port area also developed a metal-bashing industry such as shipbuilding and steel production, with a line of smoke-stack works along the coast as far as Redcar. The town burgeoned, only to languish from the 1950s and 1960s as those industries lost out to the foreign competition.
The Tees was the traditional northern boundary of Yorkshire, but in 1974 Middlesbrough and other industrial towns on both sides of the river passed to the new entity of Cleveland. This proved unpopular and was abolished in 1996, and Middlesbrough was re-assigned to North Yorkshire. The change was nominal since the town is a unitary authority, effectively a metropolis, not governed by a County Council.

Parking gets busy on Saturdays, especially whenever Boro have a home match. The NCP car park below Dundas Mall is large and usually has spaces, but charges are high.
