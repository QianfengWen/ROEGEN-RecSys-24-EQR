Bandırma is a city in Southern Marmara Region of Turkey. It's a large freight and ferry port, with a population of 149,469 in 2016, and most visitors are just passing through. The main attraction is the bird life on the lake to the south. 


Understand[edit]
Bandırma has a short sea crossing from Istanbul and a low coastline, easy to traverse by road, so it's long been a transit hub. It was founded around the 9th century BC and has been held by the Persians, the Byzantine Romans and the Ottomans, but almost nothing remains of all that. The town was wrecked in the fighting between Greece and Turkey that followed the First World War, so its buildings are modern, though some are in retro-Ottoman style. The closing shots of that conflict rang out here, then an Armistice was signed at Mudanya, followed by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. 
Bandırma was also the name of the freighter in which Mustafa Kemal sailed to Samsun, under orders to disband the Ottoman army after Turkey's 1918 defeat. Instead he organised the fightback that escalated into the War of Independence, and led to his sobriquet of "Atatürk".

There's no airport nearby. International travellers can fly into Istanbul then take the bus or ferry. 
İDO[dead link] ferries sail daily from Istanbul Kadıköy (Asia-side) and Yenikapı (Europe-side, near Sultanahmet) and take 2 hr 30 min, for a single fare of 150 TL. BUDO ferries don't sail this route, but ply from Istanbul to Mudanya near Bursa. 
Marmara RoRo sail twice a day from Tekirdağ Ceyport on the far mainland coast.  
A daily train runs from Izmir Basmane, taking almost six hours via Manisa and Balıkesir. It leaves Izmir around 09:00 and is called 6 Eylül Ekspresi, "6th of September Express", returning south from Bandırma at 16:00 when it's called 17 Eylül Ekspresi. 
A high speed line from Ankara and Istanbul has been under construction for years, and its supposed completion date of 2023 looks implausible. 
40.350427.96011 Bandırma railway station is by the harbour, within 200 m of the ferry piers.
Buses run hourly from Istanbul Anadolu station, taking 4 hours for a fare of 180 TL. Bus lines competing on this route are Metro Turizm, Pamukkale and Flixbus. From Ankara or Konya it's quickest to take the YHT high speed train  to Eskişehir, which connects with a bus to Bursa. Frequent buses between Bursa and Bandırma take two hours for a fare of 60 TL - many of these continue west to Çanakkale, for Troy and Gallipoli.
40.317728.00842 Bandırma bus station is 5 km south of town on D200 the highway from Bursa.

The port has a strip of over a dozen places, including Villa Marina, Panderma Port, Eken (two branches), Ture, Sahil, Vera, Bandirma Palas and Grand Serenay. These were decent places in 2018 but the slump in travel since means a lack of more recent customer reviews.
