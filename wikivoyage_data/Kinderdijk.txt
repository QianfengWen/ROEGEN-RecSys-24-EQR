Kinderdijk
Kinderdijk is a village in the Alblasserwaard polder of the Netherlands. It's a popular, yet authentic, tourist destination for its large network of windmills. These received recognition as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Kinderdijk lies in the Alblasserwaard, at the confluence of the Lek and Noord rivers. In Alblasserwaard, problems with water became more and more apparent in the 13th century. Large canals, called "weteringen", were dug to get rid of the excess water in the polders. However, the drained soil started setting, while the level of the river rose due to the river's sand deposits.
After a few centuries, an additional way to keep the polders dry was required. It was decided to build a series of windmills, with a limited capacity to bridge water level differences, but just able to pump water into a reservoir at an intermediate level between the soil in the polder and the river; the reservoir could be pumped out into the river by other windmills whenever the river level was low enough; the river level has both seasonal and tidal variations. Although some of the windmills are still used, the main water works are provided by two diesel pumping stations near one of the entrances of the windmills site.

The name[edit]


“

When she could no longer hide him, she took a papyrus basket for him, and coated it with tar and with pitch. She put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the river’s bank.

”


—Exodus 2:3, World English Bible (WEB)

Detail of the St Elizabeth’s Day Flood, 18–19 November 1421, altar piece by Master of the St Elizabeth Panels, c.1490
Kinderdijk means "Child's Dyke". The educational film covers the topic of Kinderdijk's name with several theories:

The low height of the dyke itself
The mills were built by child labour
The name is reportedly from the The Cat and the Cradle story. The St. Elizabeth's Day flood in November 1421 severely flooded the area, though the survivor Beatrix de Rijke's cradle floated with her inside while a cat balanced it leaving her unharmed.
Regardless of the story's authenticity (the story heavily resembles baby Moses floating down the River Nile in Exodus 2:3), Kinderdijk has a floating sculpture called Beautrice's Cradle commemorating this folklore beside the pumping station.

The best way to see the windmills is on foot or by bicycle.

See[edit]
 Mill Network at Kinderdijk-Elshout, ☏ +31 6 520-834-86. The largest concentration of old windmills in the Netherlands. In total, there are 19 windmills that were built in 1740 to drain the Albasserwaard. The mills are not always in operation; this depends on the weather. The Kinderdijk site, being a part of the general landscape, is free to visit, and you can walk or cycle through it. For many, that might well be enough. 
 Museum sites. Mid-Mar to Oct: daily 09:00-17:30; Nov to mid-Mar: 11:00-16:00. Two of the windmills can be visited inside. One is an older design than the other windmills on the site, with more that would rotate, but you are limited to the ground floor and a fire in 1997 means that much of what you see of the building is a modern reconstruction. The other allows access to all but the very top, and you can see the whole mechanism, from gears driven by the sails to the curved blades that lift the water up a few metres. On busy days, you will have to wait to have the space to do so: there is not much, and part of the attraction is wondering how a large family - one per windmill - is managed.The first windmill has a barge outside (as of 2022) with three very short films on the system. It also has a very low roof and several low beams, so be prepared to duck when moving about.If you have mobility issues, none of these are likely to be accessible.At the visitor centre end, paying visitors can access the roof, which gives a slightly better view of the landscape (drones are specifically banned from the site). Another building has a six-screen film in Dutch, sometimes subtitled in English, on the area. Sit in the middle and be prepared to look at both of the larger screens at opposite ends of the room at once, as the other four can be ignored most of the time.There are two short boat trip routes: one stops at the open windmills allowing you to hop on and off, the other just goes to the end of the line of them and back without stopping. Both run about every 30 minutes. A day pass to the Windmill site, the two Museum Mills and the Multiscreen film at visitor centre 'Wisboom' €16 during the week, more at weekends; tickets can be bought at the parking lot, at the Museummolen, at the Wisboomgemaal and online (with 10% discount). Whether it is worth it is perhaps questionable.. (updated Apr 2022)
51.8881014.6390251 Wisboom (pumping station). There is also the pumping station Wisboomgemaal (steam from 1868; electric from 1924 to 1996) which has the two electric motors from its second incarnation, a couple of games (the best is for 1-6 players on making sure windmills point in the right direction and aren't spinning too much because of a storm or draining too much water), wall displays (some curiously high up given the age group they seem to be aimed at), and a small shop.
