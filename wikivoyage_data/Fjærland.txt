Fjærland.
Fjærland is a tiny town at the end of the Fjærlandsfjord, an arm of the Sognefjord. In Sogn og Fjordane county.  It is a particularly enjoyable gateway to the Jostedalsbreen National Park, and is close to two glacial tongues.


Understand[edit]
If you want a close-up view of a glacier without actually climbing on it, then Fjærland is the place to go. In addition to this, Fjærland is Norway's  bokbyen - book town. Almost every shop in the town sells a range of new and used books, and there is even an "honesty book shop", not far from the ferry stop, where books are sold from a stand without any staff.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The closest option is Sogndal airport (SOG IATA). Alternatively Førde airport (FDE IATA).

By car[edit]
Fjærland is 38 km northwest of Sogndal on route 5 on the way to Skei, which is on E39.

By boat[edit]
In summer, Fjærland can be reached by ferry from Balestrand, a trip that gives ample photo opportunities - there's an amazing view of the Josteldalsbreen glacier behind the fjord as you approach the town.

By bus[edit]
There are buses each day to nearby towns, including Sogndal and Skei, both five times daily. The bus stop is 2 km out of the town centre, just across the road from the Norwegian glacier museum. It's a bit of a walk, so leave ample time to avoid missing what might be your only bus out of there.

Get around[edit]
A bus leaves from the ferry port once a day in May and September, twice a day in June–August, taking passengers firstly to the Glacier Museum and then to the glacier. Alternatively, catch a taxi, hire a bike at the tourist office, or use your own car.
