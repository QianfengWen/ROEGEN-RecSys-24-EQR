Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The closest major airports to Ōtsu are Kansai Airport and Itami Airport in Osaka.
From Kansai Airport (KIX IATA), take the JR Haruka Limited Express to Kyoto and change to a local train to Ōtsu (approx. 1 hr 45 min, ¥3130 for unreserved seats).
From Itami Airport (ITM IATA), take an airport limousine bus to Shin-Osaka (25 min, ¥500) then take a JR train to Ōtsu (35 min, ¥840). Alternatively, take a bus to Kyoto (1 hr, ¥1310) then a JR train to Ōtsu (10 min, ¥200).
You can change elsewhere for the Keihan trams (see below).

By train[edit]
The JR Biwako Line runs from Osaka and Kyoto to Ōtsu station.
A convenient alternative to travel around the area is on the two Keihan tram lines: the Keishin Line and the Ishiyama-Sakamoto Line. Both lines converge at Biwako-Hamaōtsu (びわ湖浜大津), close to Lake Biwa. You can change between the JR and Keihan lines at three stations: Yamashina, Zeze and Ishiyama. Yamashina is just one stop from Kyoto Station on the JR.

By subway[edit]
Kyoto's Tōzai Line subway conveniently runs through to the Keihan Keishin Line from stations in central Kyoto. This is also a convenient option if connecting from the Keihan Main Line at Sanjō station.
