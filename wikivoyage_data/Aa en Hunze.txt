Aa en Hunze is a municipality in the north of the province of Drenthe, in the Netherlands. The name of the municipality refers to two small rivers, Drentsche Aa and Hunze. There are 35 villages in the municipality, which has a total population of about 25,000 (2019). The largest villages include Gieten, Annen, and Rolde.


Understand[edit]
The landscape of the region is characterised by the Hondsrug sand ridge in the western part, and peatlands in the eastern half. The western part of the municipality has a long history, with many old so-called brinkdorpen (villages centred around a village green) and a landscape similar to neighbouring Tynaarlo and to Noordenveld. The settlement history of the eastern part of the municipality is much more recent. Starting in the 16th and 17th centuries, the peatlands of eastern Groningen and northern Drenthe were exploited. The landscape and history in this area is therefore similar to that of the Peat District of Groningen.
