Glengarriff (Gleann Garbh, "rough glen") is a village at the base of the Beara Peninsula of County Cork in southwest Ireland. It's in an inlet of Bantry Bay, and became a tourist resort in the late 19th century. In those days tourists arrived by paddle steamer, and there was no road across the hills to Kerry until a tunnel was hand-hewn through. The resident population in 2016 was 138.  


Get in[edit]
Bus Éireann 236 runs from Cork bus station via Bandon, Enniskeane, Dunmanway, Drimoleague and Bantry, taking 2 hr 20 min to Glengarriff. There are four M-F, three Sa and two on Sunday; two buses per day continue to Castletownbere. The service as far as Bantry is every 90 min or so, so at a pinch you could take the bus there then a taxi for the last 17 km.
In July and Aug, Bus 282 runs a triangle across the hills from Kenmare in County Kerry. It runs in the morning from Kenmare to Glengarriff (45 min) and Castletownbere, then via Ardgroom, Laragh and Dawros back to Kenmare; then the reverse triangle in the afternoon. Kenmare also has buses to Killarney; but the 282 doesn't run Sept-June.
By road follow N71, which runs from Bantry to Glengarriff then to Kenmare in County Kerry. R572 winds along the coast to Castletownbere.
With your own boat, Glengarriff harbour has safe anchorage.

Get around[edit]

The gardens and forest reserve can be reached on foot. It would be a very long hike to Barley Lake, but a firm trail for a mountain bike.
Harbour Queen Ferries sail from Glengarriff Harbour to Garinish Island gardens. They sail Apr-Oct daily, every 30 min from 09:45 to 15:45, with the last return from the island at 17:30. The crossing takes 10-15 min, the boats sometimes meander round islets where seals are hauled out. No booking; the fare, adult return €10, does not include admission to the gardens. Dogs and wheelchairs can be carried. 
Blue Pool Ferry and Lady Ellen Ferry have similar schedules and fares.
You need a car to explore the Beara peninsula on both the Cork and Kerry sides. Local taxi firms are Billy Downey +353 87 297 1837 and Donal Harrington +353 27 63 564 / 86 105 0828.

See[edit]
Italian Garden, Garinish
51.748-9.5491 Blue Pool is the inlet where the Glengarriff River flows into the bay, and the adjacent wooded parkland south side of the village. Like the Danube, it's only blue by reflected light, and the water is usually dark brown from moorland run-off into the river if it's been raining, which is often. Some boats to Garinish Island sail from here, others from the harbour.
Church of the Sacred Heart (RC) is at the west end of the village.
51.736-9.542 Ilnacullin Gardens, Garinish Island, ☏ +353 27 63040. Apr-Oct daily 10:00-17:30. Reached by a short ferry ride, the island was originally a military outpost, with a barracks and Martello Tower built against Napoleonic invasion. In 1910 it was sold to Annan Bryce, who commissioned English architect Harold Peto to design a house and garden. Thousands of tons of topsoil were imported to this bare, rocky island and shelter belts were planted, creating a micro-climate in which a number of tender plants thrive. The house was never built, and the Casita and Italian garden remain the centrepiece. There are also fine herbaceous borders. The ferry fare doesn't include admission fee. Adult €5, conc €4, child €3, cash only. (updated Nov 2020)
51.752-9.5363 Bamboo Park has semi-tropical plants similar to Ilnacullin. It's open daily all year 09:15-19:00, adult / child €5, dogs permitted.
51.754-9.5644 Glengarriff Nature Reserve is 1000 acres of sessile oak and birch forest. The glen was first systematically planted in the 18th century; in the 20th it was planted with conifers for logging, but since the 1970s was restored with oak. The main entrance is 2 km from the village on N71 towards Kenmare, but there are multiple access points. There are way-marked trails but no vending or toilets, and barbecues are not permitted. The forest is free to access 24 hours.

51.75-9.6276 Barley Lake is a corrie lake west of the forest. A steep winding lane leads to the corrie rim: you don't need 4WD in dry conditions, but don't bring a bulky vehicle. Otherwise hike.
51.785-9.5877 Turner's Rock Tunnel, 180 m long, takes N71 under the crest of the hills into County Kerry, framing the view as you emerge. It's only 3.65 m high so large vehicles can't pass through. See Kenmare for sights on the Kerry side.
