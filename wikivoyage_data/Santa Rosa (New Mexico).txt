Santa Rosa[dead link] , the "City of Natural Lakes", is a town (pop. about 3000) in northeastern New Mexico.  The nickname sounds improbable for a town in the middle of some very dry country, but it's appropriate because of the presence of the Blue Hole and several other lakes based on springs.  Santa Rosa is on historic Route 66.
