Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Santa Maria del Oro was founded on August 14, 1758, when Don Pedro Manuel de Acosta granted lands for the establishment of a mission for the Mercedarian friars to be named Our Lady of the Mercies (Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes). Gold was discovered soon after, and by the end of the 18th century, the town's population had burgeoned and the former mission was elevated in status to parish church (parroquia).

25.949894-105.3672791 Iglesia de la Mercedes (Church of the Mercies), Av Juarez 70, Centro. Main parish church of the town, built from 1758 to 1770. 19th century renovations changed the interior style from baroque to neoclassic. The church contains a number of significant religious artifacts and important works of art, including a 17th century sculpture by Juan de Sepulvede, which was brought to Mexico in 1625. A side niche contains an enormous wood altarpiece (the largest in the diocese) dating from the 18th century: it includes a painting of Our Lady of Mercy. The altarpiece is dedicated to the founding saints of the church. Depicted in it are St. Peter, St. Anthony of Padua, the Virgin Mary, who is flanked by a number of other saints. The church is a beautiful sacred place, but sadly in need of repairs, maintenance, and love. (updated Mar 2023)
