Mainz is the capital city of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany. Mainz is notable as a transport hub, for wine production, and for its many rebuilt historic buildings. In 2019, it was home to about 219,000 people.


Understand[edit]
The Mainzer Dom, Symbol of the City
Once the episcopal seat of the influential Prince-Electors, the "civilized" origins of Mainz date back to around 38 BC, when the Romans built a citadel here, named Mogontiacum. It was founded by the Roman general Drusus, brother of emperor Tiberius and father of emperor Claudius, at the strategic confluence of the Rhine and the Main; it shortly became the provincial capital of Germania Superior. Drusus died while campaigning beyond the Rhine, in the summer of 9 BC; his body was brought here to be mourned, and a massive funeral monument dedicated to him was built. The so-called 49.9922228.2741671 Drususstein still stands (although unclad of its marble) inside the citadel of Mainz.
The city's location at the confluence of the Rhine and the Main rivers is ideal for trade, something reflected by the artifacts kept in the Landesmuseum, that show there have been settlements here since 300,000 BC.
The most logical starting point is the Dom, the Cathedral of St Martin and St Stephan, especially on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, when the farmers' market is open.  Although the cathedral was actually started in 975, most of what is seen today was built from the 11th to the 13th centuries. At the Dom und Diözesanmuseum in the cathedral cloisters, you can truly witness the opulence and wealth controlled by the Church in Mainz.
Mainz is also the home of the man identified by Time Magazine as the most important individual in the last millennium, Johannes Gutenberg, who most Westerners regard to be the inventor of the moveable type printing press (though the Chinese had actually preceded him by centuries).
Mainz is also the home of the music publisher Schott Music.

Tourist information[edit]
Mainz tourism website
Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
From Frankfurt International Airport (FRA IATA), the local train S8 towards Wiesbaden stops at Mainz Hauptbahnhof (or optionally Mainz Römisches Theater).  The train runs at least every 30 minutes daily, and takes around 30 minutes to get the Mainz. Also regional trains towards Koblenz and Saarbrücken stop in Mainz. Both options share the same local tariff, regional trains are faster and somewhat more convenient. Cologne/Bonn Airport  (CGN IATA) is served by a direct ICE connection and from low cost hub Frankfurt-Hahn Airport (HHN IATA) there is a direct shuttle bus connection.

By train[edit]
Mainz has several train stations. The biggest and the only one in which InterCity and InterCityExpress trains stop is 50.0014368.2591191 Mainz Hauptbahnhof (main station), it is on the western edge of the city centre and works as a general hub for local traffic. Flixtrain serves the city from Berlin via Hanover and Frankfurt.
Nightjet, the Austrian Railways' sleeper train, runs three times each week between Brussels and Vienna via Munich and Salzburg, Berlin and Brussels via Frankfurt, and Amsterdam and Zurich. Note that Mainz is a few hours away from these terminal stations, so sleeper trains stop here after midnight or before 05:00. 

Another noteworthy station is 49.9937268.2777662 Mainz Römisches Theater (Roman theatre), south of the centre, but it is only served by regional and commuter trains.  Both are served from Frankfurt, about 45 minutes away, by S-Bahn line S8. Central station As of 2024, the cost of a single ticket on the Regional train (S-Bahn line S8) to Mainz Hauptbahnhof from the Frankfurt International Airport was €6.30.
Behind the Rhine bridge there is the station Mainz-Kastel with S-Bahn line S1, S9 and Stadt-Express SE10 from Frankfurt to Wiesbaden.

By car[edit]
Mainz is ringed by the A60 from Bingen / Rüsselsheim and the A643 and A671 from Wiesbaden, at the northern end of the A63 from Kaiserslautern.

50.0004358.2585043 Mainz intercity bus station
A number of long range buses (including Flixbus) serve Mainz, usually halting at Hauptbahnhof. The station is also a hub for local bus traffic, serving the surrounding countryside and Wiesbaden.
From Frankfurt Hahn Airport for those arriving with Ryanair, there is a direct bus service to Mainz roughly every 90 minutes. The ORN bus stop which services this route is just outside the main train station's police department. The service takes approx. 60-70 min.

By boat[edit]
A number of companies offer river cruises, typically leaving from Cologne or Koblenz and terminating in Mainz (and vice versa). The KD Rhine River Cruise Pass[dead link] offers a cruise of the Rhine river around all the way to Cologne with the possibility of stops along the way.

Like almost all other German Rhine bridges, the former bridge had been destroyed in World War II. The bridge was rebuilt in the early 1950s and named after the first president of the Federal Republic of Germany, Theodor Heuss. Kastel, a former Mainz suburb and several other villages on the right side of the Rhine, has been separated from the city after the war, as the Rhine was the border between the French and American occupation sectors. Even today, Kastel, Kostheim, Amöneburg, Ginsheim, Gustavsburg and the other former suburbs consider themselves part of Mainz, although they are administered by Wiesbaden and Hesse.

If you want to bring some wine or food from the region, your best bet is the farmers' market on the squares next to the Dome. It is held Tu F Sa from 09:00 to 14:00.

Eat[edit]
Mainz has two culinary specialities, both types of cheese. Spundekäse is local cream cheese whipped with cream into a soft paste, served with chopped raw onion and pretzels — the taste is mild and it goes great with beer.
Handkäse is a sour milk cheese with a pungent aroma, most often served mit Musik, or marinated in vinegar and oil, then sprinkled with caraway seeds, resulting in a bizarre, firm, gelatinous mass that most people find to be a bit of an acquired taste — and the "music" refers to the flatulence it tends to cause!
