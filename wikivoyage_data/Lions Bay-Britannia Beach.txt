Stretching along the eastern shore of Howe Sound, Lions Bay to Britannia Beach is a series of small communities and parks offering some gorgeous views, outdoor recreation and 30 km of some of the most spectacular driving in Canada. For many travellers, the area is quickly passed through on the way to Whistler, but if you have the time, there are some options if you want to stop and explore.


Understand[edit]
Beginning north of West Vancouver and extending northwards along the coast to Shannon Falls Provincial Park, the area is dominated by Howe Sound and the Coast Mountains. The mountains are steep so there is very little area for settlement, so it makes for dramatic scenery but just a handful of communities and parks — Lions Bay, Porteau Cove, Furry Creek and Britannia Beach.
Historically, the area was important for its logging and mineral resources. These industries have declined so the focus has shifted to tourism and accommodating the spillover growth from Vancouver, Whistler and Squamish.

See Vancouver for options to get in the Vancouver area by plane, by bus, and by train, and by boat.

By car[edit]
The only road in and out of the area is the Sea-to-Sky Highway (Hwy 99), which connects the communities to West Vancouver and Vancouver to the south and Squamish and Whistler to the north. It is roughly a 30-45 minute drive from Vancouver.

Get around[edit]
A car is the main way of getting around. You can cycle, but Highway 99 is hilly and windy, and the traffic moves fast.

Hiking the Howe Sound Crest[edit]
Running along the ridge of the Coast Mountains from Porteau Cove south to the Cypress Bowl ski area in West Vancouver, is the Howe Sound Crest Trail. This 29-km hike passes over or by some thirteen peaks and many lakes, tarns and alpine meadows, including the Lions, the distinctive two bumps seen on the Vancouver skyline. Tackling the entire 29-km hike should be planned carefully as campsites and sources of freshwater are limited. However, if you don't mind walking up a mountain, access points from Lions Bay and Porteau Cove make for popular dayhikes that offer some tremendous views and ample exercise. These hikes access high mountain terrain and are often under snow cover from November through June (and sometimes longer, depending on weather conditions). Trailheads near Highway 99 are:

49.54515-123.240284 Deeks Lake Trailhead, Porteau Rd exit (1 km south of Porteau Cove). This is the northern terminus of the Howe Sound Crest Trail. The hike leads to Deeks Lake and the start of it provides some nice views of Howe Sound. It is roughly 14-km round-trip to the lake and back, with 1000-m of elevation gain. 
49.47082-123.234735 Lions Bay - Sunset Dr Trailhead, end of Sunset Dr, Lions Bay (take the Lions Bay Ave exit to Bayview Dr and make a left on to Sunset Dr). This is the trailhead for three hikes that access different points -- The Lions, Mount Harvey and Brunswick Mountain -- on the Howe Sound Crest Trail. These are very steep hikes (1300-1600 m of elevation gain) and fairly lengthy, coming in between 13 - 15 km round-trip. The trail to the Lions is also referred to as the Blinkert Trail. 
49.45627-123.230526 Lions Bay - Mt Unnecessary Trailhead, end of Oceanview Rd (take the Lions Bay Ave exit and turn right onto Oceanview Rd). Trailhead for the hike to Mt Unnecessary. Round-trip is about 9.5 km and 1300 m of elevation gain. As with other the other hikes listed here, there are some pretty good views from the top. 
Buy[edit]
There is a general store in Lions Bay next to the cafe.
There is a souvenir shop at the entrance to the Britannia Mine Museum in Britannia Beach.

Connect[edit]
Cell phone coverage exists along the highway, although it can get weak at times. If you go hiking, cell signal will be variable. Expect to encounter blind spots.

Cope[edit]
From Lions Bay, the nearest hospitals are in North Vancouver and Squamish, and take roughly the same amount of time to reach.  If you are north of Lions Bay, the hospital in Squamish will be closer.

Go next[edit]
The Sea-to-Sky Highway continues on through Squamish to Whistler and Pemberton. There's excellent hiking and camping at Garibaldi Provincial Park, 30-40 minutes north.
