The Township of Langley and the City of Langley are nestled together in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia. It includes the historical village and National Historic site of Fort Langley on the south bank of the Fraser River.  We cover both Langleys in this article.


Understand[edit]
Fort Langley Community Hall
The Township of Langley runs from the bank of the Fraser River to the US border in the south. To the west is Surrey, to the east is Abbotsford. To the north of the river are Pitt Meadows and Maple Ridge. Langley is considered the "Birthplace of British Columbia" because Fort Langley (founded 1827 about 3 km from the present fort) was the first capital and first significant non-native settlement in the mainland BC colony.
The two jurisdictions are seamless and few locals even understand the political boundaries between the city and the township.
