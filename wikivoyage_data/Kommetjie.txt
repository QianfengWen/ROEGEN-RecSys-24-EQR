Kommetjie is  on the west coast of the Cape Peninsula, south-west of Noordhoek and north of Scarborough. The area is a popular spot for surfing, since powerful waves from the Atlantic Ocean rise up over rocky reefs formed by hard sandstones of the Table Mountain Group. Wherever the bottom is rocky, the shallower waters are thick with giant kelp forests.


Understand[edit]
Slangkop lighthouse
Kommetjie is Afrikaans for "small basin," approximately pronounced cawma-key.
Kommetjie is famous for its excellent crayfishing although changes in fishing quotas which have drastically reduced the daily catch allowed. The southwesterly swell produces attractive waves for surfing on the local coastal reefs, and the area is popular for fishing as there is a beach launching area for small craft. It is a quiet and relaxing town suitable for camping and getaways. Not far from Kommetjie, along Long Beach near Noordhoek, lies The Kakapo shipwreck, which ran aground in 1900.
