Hemel Hempstead is a town in Hertfordshire with a population of almost 100,000 (2011).


Understand[edit]
Old Town High Street
Developed after World War II as a new town, the town has existed as a settlement since the 8th century and has a picturesque old town and a fine Norman church. The new town centre is a planned shopping area with an indoor Mall called Marlowes Centre and an outdoor market. There is extensive, though not free, town centre parking. The town has the only real snow indoor ski centre in the south east.

"Magic Roundabout"[edit]
Magic Roundabout layout
Magic Roundabout in Hemel Hempstead
Officially named 51.7463-0.47331 The Plough and sometimes known as "Moor End Roundabout", a road roundabout made up of  6 small roundabouts arranged in a circle around a single large roundabout. Drivers either love or hate navigating it - in 2005 it was voted second worst roundabout in the UK (the "worst" being its sister roundabout in Swindon); yet by 2011 it was voted the best (in a different poll). Probably not something learner drivers look forward to at rush-hour!

Get in[edit]

The town is served by the M1 and M25 motorways and the A41 and A414 trunk roads.

Check the National Rail website before you go, as sometimes (especially on weekends) there is engineering work and trains are replaced by buses. Travelling is cheaper on weekdays after 9:30AM. The cheapest ticket for a single person is a Day Travelcard, which is around £14, and gets you into London and is valid for all Underground lines all day.

There are coaches to and from London and other towns as well as various airports. National Express coaches go direct to Luton, Heathrow and Stansted airports.
To go to/from Gatwick Airport, best go by train; you will have to change once, in Watford. For London City Airport, you will have to go to London by train, then take the Underground.

There are local buses from the station to town centre and to the Jarman Park leisure complex; apart from that, everything in town is in walking distance.
Hertfordshire buses offer an 'Explorer' ticket which permits a maximum of 2 adults, 2 adults and 2 children or 1 adult with 3 children to unlimited travel for £7. It is often worth doing as it can save money even if you are on your own.
