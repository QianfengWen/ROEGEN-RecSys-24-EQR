For other places with the same name, see Monrovia (disambiguation).


Monrovia is the capital, and with a population of around 1.6 million (2021), also the largest city in Liberia.
The city center is the image of a tropical capital, melting in the hot sun. Monrovia is a low-rise capital on the sea, lined with palm trees and paint-chipped buildings of no more than three stories.  The city has a vibrant vibe on the street.


Understand[edit]
Liberian Capitol Building
From the harbor city's establishment in 1822 to Liberia's 1847 declaration of independence, the American Colonization Society resettled approximately 3200 former African-American and Caribbean slaves and their descendants. The city was named Monrovia in 1824 after US president James Monroe, then a prominent supporter of the colony. Approximately 29% of the Liberian population live in the 5-square-mile (13 km²) capital city.
There are a number of merchants lining the streets of downtown, selling used clothes, household wares, and an interesting selection of DVDs. Waterside market is the largest local indoor/outdoor market, with narrow walkways between busy stalls. There are two large, well-stocked supermarkets in the city center to offer a surprising selection of Western foods.
Despite its woes, Liberia has the feeling of a country on the ascent. Billboards line the streets, inviting citizens to pay their taxes to make their country stronger and to take pride in their success.  It is not cliché to say that Liberians are extremely friendly, so the streets are vibrant.

Eat[edit]
Dining options in Monrovia are reasonable, although anything other than Lebanese and Liberian tends to be expensive, but there are a few reasonable places.
There are hundreds of "cook shops" serving Liberian fare, but if you're yearning for something other than spicy sauces and rice, consider the following (in no particular order):

6.3162-10.806841 Diana, ☏ +231 777-563-333. Great lunch spot. Great Lebanese sandwiches and falafel. (updated May 2024)
 The Living Room Sushi Restaurant, Tubman Boulevard (Royal Hotel, Sinkor, between 14th and 15th Streets). Expensive, especially for the mediocre sushi. Very nice, sleek atmosphere, and one could almost be in New York. The Royal Hotel also has another Western/Lebanese restaurant, where the chicken burger is pretty good. Pirate (seafood) soup also not bad. (updated May 2024)
 The Barracuda Seafood and Sushi Bar (Mamba Point Hotel), ☏ +231 77 555 4444. The city's second sushi restaurant. Food is comparable to sushi at the Royal.

Self-catering[edit]
The best produce (salad, vegetables, herbs, fruit, squash, etc.) can be found on Benson St., around Newport St. Raw honey is available outside the mosque (you'll need to strain it).
There is an excellent strip of butchers on Somalia Drive, near the port, where they slaughter and sell fresh cow, goat, and sheep meet. A butcher shop on Benson St. in town sells meat from these butchers (freshest W Sa).
Fresh fish is available in Sinkor just past the Vavoma building (where Sinkor becomes Congo Town), on the beach side of Tubman Blvd. Or call Moses at 06368158.
There are several supermarkets that sell imported (usually American, Lebanese, and some Western European) goods.

6.31624-10.808726 Monoprix, Benson Street (is conveniently located right by the good outdoor produce market in town). (updated May 2024)
6.29458-10.787697 Greenland, Tubman Boulevard. Small and a bit dark, but it's the only one open on Sundays (from about 8AM to noon). Overpriced but convenient produce stands in front. (updated May 2024)
 Exclusive Supermarket (Two locations). (updated May 2024)
6.26513-10.701568 Exclusive Supermarket, Tubman Boulevard (at 19th Street in Sinkor). A well-stocked supermarket with many imported goods of international standards.

There is a small bakery offering sandwiches and Indian foods for take-away. (updated May 2024)
6.31541-10.80399 Exclusive Supermarket (Second location in town on Center St. at Carey St.). Not as large as its Sinkor cousin, but large housewares section and reasonable prices. (updated May 2024)

Single rooms advertised at US$65 + tax at airport, actual price usually at least US$90. Small, dark, old rooms and minimal breakfast are not great value for money at that price. Sam's BBQ in front of the hotel serves as its main restaurant. Diners beware however. When the bill arrives, the total for ex-pats at least is often higher than indicated on the menu. Check the prices and math first or risk paying more than necessary due to an honest "mistake". The beer however, is the coldest available in Monrovia.
