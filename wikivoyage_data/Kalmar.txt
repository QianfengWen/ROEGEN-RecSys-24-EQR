Kalmar is a city in the Småland province in southeastern Sweden, with 38,000 inhabitants. It is the seat of the municipality, Kalmar kommun which has 67,000 citizens, and the county Kalmar län with some 233,000 inhabitants.


Understand[edit]
Kalmar is one of the oldest Swedish cities, dating back to the year 1027, and the foundation of the Kalmar Union, which ruled all the Nordic Countries during the 14th and 15th centuries. The Kalmar Union unraveled in the late 16th century but the city was still important to Sweden. After the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658, the strategic importance of Kalmar gradually diminished as the borders of Sweden were redrawn further south causing Kalmar to lose its status as one of Sweden's main military outposts. Kalmar Castle then fell into disuse. Serious renovation efforts on the castle began before WWII, but was put on pause during it. Renovations resumed later in the 20th century, and has restored the castle to its current state.
In Kalmar, the Öland Bridge connects Öland to mainland Sweden.

Get around[edit]
You can walk to all interesting locations. The city center is relatively small, with two main squares. On one you find the cathedral (Domkyrkan) and the other is called Larmtorget. From the second one, you can walk to the Baronen shopping centre. You can also rent canoes at the low cost hotel Svanen, and you can paddle your way around the centre, which is an island.
Driving in the city center is a challenge as there are many one way streets, and the street signs have many caveats which are written out in Swedish only. Free parking is virtually non-existent, and paid parking requires an app to be installed on your phone in many cases. Some paid parking lots may have an automated machine where you can pay for parking, but getting US credit cards accepted is a matter of luck. If you are travelling into Kalmar from another city, take the train!
