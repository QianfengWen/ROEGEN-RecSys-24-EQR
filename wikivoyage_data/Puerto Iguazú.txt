By ferry[edit]
From Paraguay[edit]
There is a ferry (balsa) between Puerto Iguazú and Presidente Franco, Paraguay (just outside Ciudad del Este). You can get there from Ciudad del Este by bus for PYG2,500 (as of October 2016): take the red Matiauda which says "3 Fronteras" and ask the driver to let you know when get out. It's about half an hour in bus, and then you have a 500-m walk downhill. The ferry costs PYG10,000 per person if you're on foot.

Get around[edit]
A bus leaves every 20 minutes on the quarter hour from the bus terminal to the entrance on the Argentine side of the falls. Most hotels have the timetable. Tell the bus driver if you want to stop along the way.
Frequent buses cross the border to Foz do Iguaçu where you can change to a bus to the Brazilian side of the falls
There is an hourly bus to the Brazilian side of the falls operated by Rio Uruguay at the bus terminal.
Some buses cross to Ciudad del Este without stopping in Brazil (hence, no need for Brazilian border control)
There is a ferry crossing directly to Paraguay (look for the sign on the corner Av. Missiones and Brasil). About hourly during daylight. As of October 2023, the ferry is operating. On the Paraguayan side walk up to the main street and take any bus going to the right (don't believe "Taxi" drivers telling you there is no bus, they are just up to overcharging you). You can pay the ride in pesos. When you arrive at the roundabout about half an hour later you are in the centre of Ciudad del Este, for the bus terminal you have to get off earlier.
Taxis operate with fixed prices which makes the distance to both parks from your hotel irrelevant. Round trips are advertised as double but most taxi drivers will do the trip for a discount if asked. Do not be amazed if the very same driver waits for you for hours. Taxi drivers will store your luggage in their taxi while waiting.
