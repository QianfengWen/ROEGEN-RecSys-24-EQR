Not to be confused with Foča in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Foça is a town in the Central Aegean region of Turkey, 60 km north of Izmir. It's a beach resort easily within a day-trip of the city and in 2019 it had a population of 32,264. 
A second town grew up 20 km north, called Yeni ("New") Foça as it was only established 800 years ago. The original town is therefore sometimes distinguished as Eski ("Old") Foça, and to avoid ambiguity this page does so. So too should you when organising transport and accommodation. 


Understand[edit]
Eski Foça waterfront
Foça may have been settled as early as the 11th century BC, and developed as a Hellenistic city known as "Phocaea" for its seals. It became a mighty sea-power, establishing colonies across the Med as far away as Corsica, Spain and Marseille. Around 550 BC the city came under the sway of King Croesus of Lydia, who exemplified the Golden Rule: he had the gold, so he made the rules. But he and his dominion were in turn conquered by Persia, and much of Phocaea's population fled to its colonies. The city endured but was never as important again, variously coming under Athenian, Roman and Genoese rule. Yeni Foça was established in the 12th century, and briefly outgrew the old town with gypsum mining. From late medieval times the area was Ottoman-controlled, but still with a large Greek population. The Greeks suffered a massacre in June 1914, when much of the old town was destroyed, and after the treaty of 1923 they were resettled in Greece. Some of their architecture survives in the centre of Eski Foça. 
Foça morphed into a beach resort as Izmir grew to the south, and better roads brought it within a day-trip. And that, as elewhere in the Med, was the downfall of the seals, the Mediterranean monk seal Monachus monachus. They had long been hunted and harried by fishermen, or were accidentally snarled in nets. But now they faced enormous habitat loss, and total numbers shrank to some 700, in colonies almost as widely separated as those of ancient Phocaea. Belated protection has stabilised their numbers, with about 20 living around the islands off Foça, and they are therefore classed as "endangered" dropping the word "critically". But their position is precarious, and their cousins the Caribbean monk seals became extinct in the 1960s.

IZBAN the Izmir suburban railway blue line runs north from Izmir Airport via city centre to Hatundere (for Eski Foça), Biçerova (for Yeni Foça) and Aliağa (for Bergama and  Çandarli). They run every 10-15 min from 06:00 to midnight. You need an Izmirim card, local transport doesn't take cash.

The beach strip is 5 km long, dolmuşes and taxis ply along it. There's no bus along the coast between Eski Foça and Yeni Foça.

See[edit]
38.669426.75971 Three windmills stand on the hill at the east edge of town, one restored, a second dilapidated and the third forlorn. A Roman amphitheatre was cut into the hillside just north but there's next-to-nothing left of that.
Old town centres on the pedstrianised street north from the bus station.
 Five Gates Castle (Beş Kapılar Kalesi), Aşıklar Cd 11, Eski Foça (50 m north of Bülbül Yuvasi Hotel). Closed. 13th century Genoese castle, repaired by the Ottomans and again in modern times. The interior is closed, but the ramparts line the shore road round the headland, with multiple viewpoints. (updated Aug 2022)
Maritime Museum (Foça Denizcilik Müzesi) by the castle is a small display open Tu-Su 10:00-16:00, free.
38.673326.72752 Incir Island is the closest of the Foça Islands, 400 m off the headland. They're all just uninhabited scrub, but boat trips come by for snorkelling, picnics and wild-life spotting. Fener Island is another 500 m west, Orak the largest is 500 m north (the name means "sickle" from its long hooked spit), and Metelik and Hayirsiz islets are further north. If you hear an unearthly, haunting singing, block up your ears real quick and tie down the boat skipper so he can't turn towards the sound. These isles are supposedly the abode of the Sirens, half-woman half-bird, who in legend tried to lure Ulysses to destruction. The same legend attaches to a dozen other islands across the Med, so they obviously toured their act.
38.660526.82253 Persian Tomb (Pers Mezarı Anıtı) stands by the roadside 7 km east of town. It's about 4.5 m tall and from 4th century BC, the time of Persian rule, but the noble buried there is not known.
