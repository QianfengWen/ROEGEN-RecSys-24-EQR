Mildura is a mid-sized regional city in Sunraysia, Victoria with a population of 56,972 (2021). 


Understand[edit]





Note: Mildura is in the fruit fly-free zone, so you are not allowed to carry fruit and vegetables from outside this zone into Mildura (this can attract fines of up to $100,000). Also, any fruit taken outside of this zone must not be brought back into the zone. You should also not take fruit over interstate borders into South Australia or New South Wales (fines may also apply).





Mildura is on the Murray River in the northwest corner of Victoria. The region's population of 52,000 (2018) is growing at around 1.5% annually.
Mildura and the surrounding area is a large fruit growing region. Local produce includes most varieties of citrus, grapes, avocados and almonds. The quality of local produce and the growing wine industry have helped Mildura develop a reputation for great food and wine.  Mildura has become popular with backpackers drawn by the availability of farm work.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
-34.229167142.0855561 Mildura Airport (MQL  IATA). One of the largest in regional Australia. The airport services regular flights from Melbourne and Sydney.   
By train[edit]
The Mildura train station is on the corner of Langtree Avenue and 7th St. No passenger trains arrive or depart from Mildura, and the railway line form Melbourne only carries freight traffic.

By bus[edit]
The bus station is next to the train station. Buses to and from Melbourne depart daily and also run direct to Swan Hill (2½ hours) or Bendigo (6 hours) to connect with train services. The entire journey from Melbourne takes 7½ hours via Swan Hill, 8 hours via Bendigo or 10 hours direct from Melbourne. 
Mildura is on the daily bus route from Adelaide to Sydney (via Canberra). Local buses also connect Mildura with surrounding smaller towns.

By car[edit]
From Melbourne the journey time is 6-7 hours along the Calder Highway. Journey time from Adelaide is 4.5-5 hours.  From Sydney you will be travelling via Wagga Wagga and Hay, and be prepared for a long straight drive through the Murray Outback for the best part of 12 hours (not allowing for breaks).  Best to allow at least two days. The roads in and out of Mildura are generally uninteresting, and dotted with small towns with little to see or do. Be prepared for a long and potentially boring drive.

Get around[edit]

Local buses connect Mildura with surrounding smaller towns. Buses run on weekdays during business hours between Ransoms (Deakin Avenue & Eighth Street) and Centro (Deakin Avenue & Fifteenth Street) every half hour. For most attractions a car is necessary - major rental companies operate from the airport. Mildura is largely flat, making it ideal for cycling - several trails run around the city and along the river. Bicycle Hire is available from a local bike shop.
Driving to Wentworth takes around 30 minutes, but by bus it can take 1.5 hours.

Do[edit]
Visit wineries including Trentham Estate, Oak Valley Estate and Lindemans or one of the growing number of boutique producers.
Cruise the Murray River on the Paddlesteamer Melbourne or a chartered houseboat.
Watch the Speedway races.  Oval, flat track motorbike racing.
Time your visit to coincide with the annual jazz, country music or arts festivals.
Go camping! Free camping is still available almost anywhere on the banks of the picturesque Murray River.  It is easy to find a private campsite with good river access for swimming, water skiing, fishing, or just looking. Birdlife on the Murray is abundant (you will likely be woken up by the kookaburras) and you may spot the odd goanna or kangaroo.
Local bands at gigs around town. Check out Thursday's Sunraysia Daily (local newspaper) for the gig guide. Usual venues include the Sandbar and The Sett's.
Visit the tourist information centre at 180-190 Deakin Avenue (corner of Twelfth Street). If calling within Australia, it can be contacted on the following toll-free number 1800 039 043. It hosts a small museum containing quick information about the region. The complex includes the local library, which has free wifi and computer terminals. Also within the complex is a gym, and pools (Mildura Waves) with one out-door full sized lap-pool, an outdoor diving pool (up to 20 m), an indoor lap-pool, an in-door pool with wave generators (locally known as the "wave pool"), showers, a children's pool, spa and sauna. The main lobby area has a cafeteria and plenty of seating.
The Mungo National Park is about 2 hours away and can be seen in a day trip.
Buy[edit]
Some superb Murray pink salt from the visitor centre. These salts also help farmers who have lost their fertile soil to salinity problems.
Local dried fruit produce from the Australian Dried Fruits Association on Deakin Avenue.
Locally grown fruit and veggies such as oranges, grapes, avocados, mandarins, rockmelon, watermelon, tomatoes, mulberries, and onions from the roadside stalls. All stalls have an 'honesty box' system and charge very reasonable rates well below local supermarkets. Local Coles & Woolworths supermarkets may buy their produce locally, but they are not permitted by company policy to negotiate their own price with growers. The supermarkets also end up having to buy their fruit from local growers at wholesale markets in Adelaide or Melbourne, meaning the carbon footprint is massive after two approx. 5-hour trips in B Double trucks, and fruit at supermarkets is not as fresh as you would expect.
 Merbein Street Market, Commercial St, ☏ +61 427 888 708, merbeininfo@gmail.com. Third Sunday of every month 8AM-1PM. (updated Mar 2018)
