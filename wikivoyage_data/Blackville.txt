Understand[edit]
Map of Blackville
The parish of Blackville, for which the town is named, was named in honour of William Black, the acting governor of the colony of New Brunswick from 1829 to 1831.
Blackville's economy was once tied to the forest industry. A large sawmill that employed 200 workers had been operated in the village, but it closed in 2007 as a result of economic pressures.
Blackville was founded before 1801 by United Empire Loyalists from the lower St. John River valley and by people from Miramichi, especially the Scots.
In 1825, Blackville was affected by the Great Miramichi Fire, which devastated 10,000-20,000 km² in the centre and northeast of the province and killed more than 280 people.

Do[edit]
Fishing: Blackville boasts plenty of excellent fishing pools, and New Brunswick yields tens of thousands of fish every year for anglers. Atlantic salmon fishing in North America is restricted to fly fishing only and there are strict seasons, catch limits and other restrictions. Non-residents of New Brunswick are required to hire a licensed guide to fish for Atlantic salmon. Guides are available locally and one can be hired to guide up to three anglers. The Main Southwest Miramichi is also one of only a few remaining rivers in which the fishing rights are still privately owned in North America and fishing access can be difficult unless arranged through a commercial sporting camp or outfitter. The Miramichi River produces nearly fifty percent of all the rod-caught salmon in North America.
