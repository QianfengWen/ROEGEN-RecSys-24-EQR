Lerwick (Norwegian: Leirvik, "clay bay") is the largest town and capital of the Shetland Islands, with a population of 6880 in 2016. It's the obvious base for touring them.


Understand[edit]
The town dates back at least 3000 years, initially centred a little to the west by the freshwater Clickimin Loch. A wooden town grew up but was burned down by the inhabitants of Scalloway in the 17th century, ostensibly because they objected to the drunken immorality of the Lerwick sailors. Their real motive was fear that Lerwick would supplant Scalloway as capital of Shetland, as indeed it did in 1708. Stone buildings came to predominate in the 18th and 19th centuries and Lerwick became a busy fishing and shipping port. It still is.

Visitor information[edit]
Lerwick visitor information webpage
The tourist information centre is the VisitScotland iCentre on Market Cross, south end of the harbour. It's open Apr-Sep: M-Sa 9AM-5PM, Su 10AM-4PM; and Oct-Mar: M-Sa 10AM-4PM.
Get in[edit]
View of Lerwick from Fort Charlotte
By plane[edit]
Sumburgh Airport  (LSI IATA) is Shetlands' main airport, 25 miles (40 km) south of Lerwick. This airport has flights by Loganair from Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Inverness, Kirkwall and Bergen. One flight a day is local, to Lerwick-Tingwall. Bus 6 runs between Sumburgh and Lerwick (every hour or two; 60 min), and there is car hire at the airport.
Flights between the Shetland Islands fly from 60.191944-1.2436111 Lerwick-Tingwall Airport  (LWK  IATA) 4 miles north of Lerwick. These serve Fair Isle, Foula and Sumburgh; the flight to Papa Stour was axed. Day-trips either way are often possible. Flights are operated by Airtask on behalf of Shetland Islands Council, using a couple of BNF Islanders, so they're small and not infrequently grounded by the weather. Bus 21 / 23 (Lerwick to Brae, Hillswick or Toft) and Bus 9 (Lerwick to Walls) pass near the airport, but better take a taxi. By car follow A970 north, turn left onto A971; parking here is free.

By boat[edit]
Northlink Ferries sail overnight from Aberdeen. These carry vehicles and sail every afternoon: on 4 days direct, the other 3 days via Kirkwall in Orkney. See  Shetland page for practical info. Ferries no longer sail to Scandinavia, Faeroes or Iceland. 
60.163-1.1592 Holmsgarth Terminal is the ferry pier, on A970 main road about 2 miles north of Lerwick centre, opposite the Shetland Hotel. Bus 4 (Lerwick to Scalloway) runs past the terminal every hour or so and there are taxis. Cruise ships often visit Shetland in summer and may dock here, or anchor up and bring passengers into Kirkwall by tender.

Get around[edit]

By car[edit]
Most visitors either fly into Sumburgh and hire from the airport, or bring their own car on the ferry: for a family the extra fare is more than offset by the convenience and saving of self-driving to Aberdeen. This means that Lerwick has only a small hire fleet, which is also serving the airport, so you need to book. As of 2021 the car hire firms in Lerwick are Europcar, Grantfield Garage, and Bolts who are agents for Avis. They're all open M-Sa 9AM-5PM and closed on Sunday.

By bus[edit]
You're unlikely to use the bus within town, but for Holmsgarth Terminal use Bus 4 hourly towards Scalloway. Bus 1 circles town hourly and runs north near the terminal and south by Broch of Clickimin. Bus 6 hourly to Sumburgh also passes the Broch. For timetables see Zetrans
60.157-1.1463 Viking Bus Station is north end of the centre, just beyond Fort Charlotte.

By boat[edit]
The only inter-island ferry from Lerwick is the hourly ten-minute crossing to Bressay. It's a little roll-on, roll-off ferry sailing from the harbour in town centre, not Holmsgarth. 
The other inter-island ferries ply from different points around Mainland, but their sailing status is shown on a big display board at the harbour, worth checking if the day looks doubtful. Those ferry piers are sometimes altered in rough weather, and Lerwick is a "port of refuge" for the Out Skerries ferry — don't go visiting in such conditions.

By taxi[edit]
Taxi firms in Lerwick include Sinclair's +44 1595 696060, Allied Taxis +44 1595 690069, and Ace +44 1595 693030.
There's a taxi rank by Victoria Pier in town centre, and taxis await the ferry from Aberdeen.

See[edit]
Fort Charlotte
Lerwick is mostly a modern industrial town, with quays and marine industries sprawling along the shoreline. Scenically the best of it is one block back from the quay, along pedestrianised Commercial Street. Follow this past various Victorian buildings south out of town, onto Twageos Road, then out to the breezy headland of The Knab.

60.1557-1.14521 Fort Charlotte, Harbour Street ZE1 0JL. Keys available from staff on site Monday to Friday. A five-sided artillery fort that was built in 1665 against the Dutch. Then it was demolished, rebuilt, demolished, then burnt by the Dutch just to make sure. The present structure dates from 1780, raised against American revolutionaries, but never saw action. It's no longer in a commanding position, as it's become hemmed in by modern buildings behind, and reclaimed land has extended the shoreline in front.   (updated Jun 2018)
60.14925-1.165482 Clickimin Broch, in Loch of Clickimin (1 km SW of Lerwick, just after the roundabout on South Road), ☏ +44 1856 841815. Always open. A broch (stone and turf fortified dwelling) occupied between 700 BC and 600 AD. It was built on an island in the freshwater loch; the water-level was lowered in the 19th century, so it's now connected to shore by a broad spit and pathway. No parking on the road here, use side streets or buy something at nearby Tesco. Free.   (updated Jun 2018)

Every February the "guizer" volunteers start building a Viking longship in this shed. By midsummer the work in progress is on display, along with "Jarl Squad" regalia and film & photos of previous events. Then in late January there's a grand torchlight costumed procession and the ship is ceremonially burned. The ritual goes back to the 1880s when earlier yule torchlight revels were stamped out because of drunkenness and fire-raising. Adult £3, concessions £1.   (updated Jun 2018)
60.1459-1.13864 The Knab, South of the town at the end of Knab Road. A small park at the end of a peninsula with a scenic viewpoint out towards the sea, and plaques explaining the historical events that occurred here. A coastal hiking trail heads off in both directions. There is also a cemetery maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. (updated Sep 2022)
Do[edit]
The longship burns at Up Helly Aa
Up Helly Aa events are held around New Year in several locations in Shetland, but by far the biggest and most spectacular is in Lerwick. The name means "end of holidays" but it's slipped back in the calendar to attract more visitors, and is nowadays on the last Tuesday in January. The programme starts with a morning procession at 9AM, followed by a civic reception before the "guizers" embark on a series of visits to schools, care homes and the hospital. The evening torchlight costume procession starts at 7:30PM (by which hour it's black night in Shetland), culminating in burning the Viking longship. The guizers are then entertained at a series of "Halls": private receptions to thank volunteers for their work over the year.

Go next[edit]
Most of Shetland can be visited on a day-trip from Lerwick. Highlights include:

Jarlshof, the prehistoric settlement at Sumburgh, next to the main airport 30 miles south.
Scalloway, Shetland's second largest town and home to Scalloway castle, is a 6-mile drive.
Trondra, Burra and East Burra are three small isles on the west coast, connected to Scalloway by road.
Noss is a small island nature reserve with spectacular sea-cliffs, reached via the island of Bressay, a short ferry-ride from Lerwick.
Yell and Unst are the two islands north of Mainland, linked by short ferry crossings; here you reach the north tip of the British Isles and UK.
Further out, Foula and Fair Isle vie with each other for the title of "Britain's most remote habitation". So they need a longer stay; nevertheless by air a day-trip may be possible.
Otherwise, return south (perhaps via the Orkney Islands) to the Scottish mainland. You have to return there to reach other island groups such as the Hebrides.
