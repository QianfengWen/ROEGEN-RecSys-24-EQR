Magdeburg is the capital city of the Bundesland of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, with a population of 240,000 (2018). Magdeburg has become a modern city with numerous interesting sights of high importance and uniqueness, as well as many parks, which make Magdeburg the third greenest city in Germany. New shopping malls and other attractions have changed the cityscape enormously. Today Magdeburg has the largest retail area in relation to its overall area of whole Germany.


Understand[edit]

Magdeburg was one of the most important medieval cities in Europe. It served as a more or less de facto "eastern capital" of the Ottonian dynasty in the 10th and 11th century and stayed one of Germany's most important cities until the early modern era. As a centre of the reformation and a town that refused to bow to the emperor's authority in the Thirty Years War, Magdeburg became a target of one of the most horrific battles of this war with more than 25,000 dead at the hand of the Catholic forces under Tilly and Pappenheim in the employ of the imperial forces. Tilly christened the event "Magdeburger Hochzeit" or Magdeburg marriage, based on the fact that the "maiden" Magdeburg (Magd is an old German word that can be translated as maid, Magdeburg also has a woman in its coat of arms) had defied the emperor for over a hundred years and was to be "married" and thus made to obey again. While the whole ordeal was seen as a horrible breach of the laws of military conduct even back then, and most buildings were destroyed by the flames, Magdeburg was soon rebuilt, but never gained the strength and importance it once had. In 1631 — the year of the battle — the permanent population temporarily dropped to barely a few hundred. During that time the mayor of Magdeburg was one Otto Gericke who is known even to this day for scientific experiments about vacuums, that some German schoolchildren read about in their textbooks. Thus and because of the Ottonian dynasty, Magdeburg is sometimes called the "city of Ottos". During the Cold War, Magdeburg's population increased rapidly and the city became a socially and economically important centre of East Germany.
After the German reunification, however, most of the city's economy was shut down. Although Magdeburg is in a continuous modernization process and its cityscape changed rapidly, it has to face the same problems like almost all mid-sized cities in eastern Germany: a decline of population due to more attractive jobs in western Germany or in Berlin. The division of Germany is still visible in some ways.
Magdeburg is home of two of Germany's top ranking universities, which make it attractive to college students from all over Europe. Other scientific institutions, like the Max-Planck-Institute, and one of the largest sites of the Fraunhofer Institut, make Magdeburg an important city for international research.
Today's industry includes traditional and also new branches. The company "Röstfein" is one of the best coffee brands in eastern Germany, and the company "Abtshof" is known for its traditional and unique vodka production. The world's first artificial sweetener was produced in Magdeburg and is still in production. The production of wind energy is one of the newer industry branches.

By plane[edit]
51.85592811.4180082 Magdeburg–Cochstedt Airport (CSO  IATA). Magdeburg does have a local airport. It does not see regular passenger service though since 2013, when Ryanair, the last airline serving it, cancelled all routes.   
If you travel by plane, you can use one of the following airports:

51.4201212.221383 Leipzig/Halle (LEJ IATA) (This is the closest airport, directly located at the freeway. If you rent a car, take the freeway A14 heading towards Magdeburg (about 50 minutes)). The airport also has an integrated train station, from where you can use an hourly IC-train connection directly to Magdeburg (about €21, 1 hour). You can buy train tickets on the platform, at the counter, or online at www.bahn.com (search for a connection from "Leipzig/Halle Flughafen" to "Magdeburg Hbf.") (updated Aug 2019)
Berlin Brandenburg Airport (BER IATA): This international airport replaced Berlin-Schönefeld and Berlin-Tegel airports in 2020. By train, search online for a connection from "Berlin-Brandenburg Flughafen" to "Magdeburg Hbf." (about 2 hours, €30)

Magdeburg is situated in central Germany. It is best accessible by car or train. The east-west freeway (motorway) A2 passes just to the north of Magdeburg, and the A14 passes just to the west, with exits leading into several parts of the city.

By bus[edit]
There are several  domestic bus lines going to Magdeburg.

Get around[edit]
There are S-Bahn trains, trams, buses and ferries in Magdeburg. Since they are all unified in a linked transport system called Marego they all use the same tickets. Within the Marego area Magdeburg makes up 1 zone. For getting around in Magdeburg you need to buy a ticket for Zone 010 (Magdeburg). There are several types of tickets you can use in this zone, depending on how often you want to use public transportation.
You can purchase tickets from MVB (Magdeburger Verkehrsbetriebe), the operator of trams and buses in Magdeburg. They have box offices throughout the city, as well as vending machines outside and inside all trams and buses (in the front part of the vehicle). Most box offices are closed on weekends. Outside vending machines will only take coins, whereas the vending machines inside the vehicles will take notes up to €10. You can also purchase your ticket at vending machines of Deutsche Bahn, which operates the S-Bahn in Magdeburg. No matter where you buy your ticket all tickets are valid for S-Bahn, buses, trams, and ferry services throughout the city.
Here are the types of Marego tickets that you most likely want to use within Magdeburg (Zone 010):

Single ticket: Ticket for 60 min: adults €2.00 (Einzelkarte), children €1.50 (Ermäßigte Einzelkarte)
One day ticket: Ticket valid until 04:00 the following day: adults €4.60 (Tageskarte), children €3.50 (Ermäßigte Tageskarte), probably the cheapest option
Ticket strips: Four 60-minute tickets: €7.60 for adults (4er-Karte), €5.70 for children (Ermäßigte 4er-Karte)
Short trip ticket (Kurzstrecke): Valid for 3 stops in one direction: €1.40 (can only be bought inside the tram/bus!)
Weekly ticket (Wochenkarte): €17.30 for one person, valid until 04:00 on the 8th day from the time of purchase.
If you buy your ticket outside a vehicle you need to punch your ticket inside the vehicle to make it valid. Tickets sold inside the vehicle are valid immediately.
You can search online to find specific connections within the city.

By tram[edit]
Using the tram is probably the easiest way for tourists to get around, since most stops are located near busy places or main attractions. Magdeburg has 10 tram lines plus the additional line number 15, which is used in times of heavy traffic, or for special events. Waiting times vary widely and depend on location, time, and day. Within the centre, you will rarely wait more than 5 min (even on Sundays), but at stops that serve only one or two lines, you may have to wait 10-20 min. You will find timetables at every stop. Within the city center electronic timetables are used. Night schedules are different.

By bus[edit]
Buses serve all areas of the city. Busses usually run every 20 min.
The 11 bus line numbers are 51, 52, 54, 55, 56, 57, 59, 61, 69, 71 and 73. Buses 41-44 operate only in times of heavy traffic or for special events. You will find timetables are every stop. Night schedules are different.

By ferry[edit]
There are two ferry services that cross the river Elbe. One is the Fähre Westerhüsen and the other one is the Fähre Buckau. Ferry services are offered from March to October, Tuesdays-Sundays 10:00 to 18:00. Other river services are listed in the freetime section.

By taxi[edit]
Most taxis are operated by the Taxi-Genossenschaft Magdeburg eG. 
When you are in town call 737373 (0049-391-737373 on a mobile phone) to request a taxi at any time.

By S-Bahn[edit]
There is one S-Bahn line that crosses Magdeburg from south to north. S-Bahn train stations are shown as a white S on a green filled circle. Trains are running every 30 Minutes. Night schedules are different. If you need to cross the city from south to north or north to south this might probably be the fastest option rather than taking buses and trams. S-Bahn stations are also often connected to DB train stations.

Public transportation at night[edit]
Night schedules for trams and buses apply from 21:00 and go until 04:45 Monday-Friday, 06:30 on Saturdays, and 09:00 on Sundays. Only three tram lines and three bus lines are in service during this time. The night trams are 92, 94 and 95. The night bus lines are 91, 93 and 96. If you plan to go downtown at night, you should check schedules before you go, since not all outer parts are served at night. S-Bahn service at night is limited. Trains usually run every hour.

On the street[edit]
The Magdeburger Ring (road B71) crosses Magdeburg and is the most important road. It is like an "innercity highway". In order to get into another part of the town quickly, you may use the B71 and get off at the exit you want. Using the B71 might be better if you want to avoid traffic lights and long ways through the city.

Bike[edit]
Magdeburg is one of the greenest cities in Europe and the second greenest city in Germany.
Riding your bike in Magdeburg is a perfect freetime activity. Since most of the streets have cycle tracks on the sides you will not have any problems with taking your bike into the city. Streetcars, busses, ferries and S-Bahn trains allow you to take your bike with you, however, you may have to purchase an extra ticket for your bike.
A very nice way to explore the idyllic nature in and around Magdeburg is using the Elberadweg. This cycle path leads you all the way along the river Elbe and invites you to explore the unique biosphere reserve around Magdeburg. The cycle path's symbol is a white "e" on a blue ground. Signs guide you along the path and show you directions and distances to other towns, villages, and attractions.
Many restaurants and beer gardens are right next to the river, as well as some nice hotels, playgrounds and parks. The web site for the Elberadweg is www.elberadweg.de (partly in English).

Buy[edit]
There are numerous shopping malls all over the city. In the centre you have Karstadt, which used to be a mall during the Cold War. It is the oldest of the city, and its building represents socialist architecture. After the reunification the city centre got several new shopping malls. The biggest of them is called Allee Center and has 3 floors. Also in the city centre are the Ulrichshaus and the City Carré. You will also find many stores (as well as bars and cafés) along the road Breiter Weg, which used to be one of the largest shopping streets in Europe before World War II and has now regained most of its popularity with modern architecture.
Some malls were also established in the suburbs of Magdeburg like the Elbe-Park, Flora-Park, Börde-Park and Pfahlberg. You will find pretty much all kinds of goods at any of the named places.
For the most part stores are open from 08:00 to 20:00 (22:00 in some cases) from Monday to Friday. On Saturdays only the large malls open until 20:00, smaller stores are open until 12:00 or 18:00. On Sundays stores are usually closed apart from stations and petrol stations.
