Enköping is a city in western Uppland in Sweden with about 20,000 inhabitants, branding itself "Sweden's nearest city". It is the seat of Enköping municipality with about 40,000 inhabitants.


Understand[edit]
Enköping is located along Enköping stream (Enköpingsån) near its outlet in Lake Mälaren. It is the second largest city in Uppsala County. It is known for its many beautiful parks.
Some of the best preserved Bronze Age rock carvings in Svealand have been found in the Enköping region. During the Viking era the site where Enköping stands today was an important market place. The city was founded in the 13th century and soon became an important trade centre, connecting mining products from the north with Lake Mälaren and Stockholm. In the early 17th century Enköping lost its position as a centre of trade many burgers took to farming instead.
Enköping remained a rather small city of about 1000 inhabitants until the construction of Mälarbanan, a railway which connects Västerås with Stockholm and passes by Enköping, was constructed in 1876. By the end of the 19th century Enköping became a major producer of horseradish. Notable industries which emerged in the city were Bahco, manufacturer of hand tools, and Nordströms linbanor, producers of aerial lifts.
Since 1943 it has been an important military garrison for the Swedish army.
