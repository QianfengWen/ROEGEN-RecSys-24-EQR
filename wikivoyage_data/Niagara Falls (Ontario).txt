See Niagara Falls (New York) for information about the American side of the falls
The Horseshoe Falls. That's the United States on the left, and Canada on the right and in the background, in case you can't see the difference.
Niagara Falls, Ontario, is the self-proclaimed "Honeymoon Capital of the World". For over a century the grandeur of the waterfalls of the Niagara River have attracted tourists to this destination.


Understand[edit]
Niagara Falls was incorporated on June 12, 1903. Its population was 94,000 in 2021.
Mainly a tourist destination, the main attraction has always been Niagara Falls, which brings hundreds of thousands of tourists to the city. Tourism plays a major part in the economy of the region. Increasingly, visitors seeking more natural settings are finding the Niagara River to a great place to hike and visit downstream from the Falls where the majority of visitors go.

Average max. and min. temperatures in °F
Precipitation+Snow totals in inches



Spring: Temperatures range from 5° to 19°C (41°-66°F). Nightly temperatures range from -3° to 8° C (26° to 46°F). As temperature changes are sudden outdoor camping before mid-May is not advisable.
Summer: In June, July & August the weather is generally bright and sunny with sporadic rainfall. Storms are caused by Lake Erie and Lake Ontario and are seldom severe.
Fall: In the fall, it is unlikely to snow prior to the end of October. First killing frost and/or snowfall be expected by late October or early November. Mixed weather patterns prevail. Rain and cloudy skies are common.
Winter: The days are generally cold and clear. Snow is moderate. Snow storms are infrequent. Lake effect snowfalls are mainly localized to areas near Buffalo and southward. Lake Erie, during extended cold weather will freeze over completely. Some of the activities associated with the falls (e.g. Maid of the Mist and Marineland) do not run during winter due to the frozen conditions, but most attractions now remain open year-round, dealing with mist-related ice near Niagara Falls.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The closest airports to the Falls are across the border in the U.S. Buffalo-Niagara International Airport (BUF IATA) just outside of Buffalo, New York is about a 20-30 minute drive from the Falls and is served by most major American carriers. Niagara Falls International Airport (IAG IATA) is the closest airport to the Falls, but only a few scheduled flights serve it.
On the Canadian side, Hamilton International Airport (YHM IATA) in Hamilton is about 70 km (43 mi) from Niagara Falls, and is served by WestJet.  Toronto Pearson International Airport (YYZ IATA) in Mississauga is about a 1 1/2 hour drive from the Falls and is served by most major domestic and international carriers. There is also St. Catharines/Niagara District Airport (YCM IATA) in Niagara-on-the-Lake for general aviation.
Buffalo Airport Shuttle, +1 716 685-2550, offers service from the Buffalo-Niagara airport to the Canadian side of the Falls.  A family of 4 can expect to pay less than $25 per person and the drivers often have great tips on where to go and what to avoid.

By car[edit]
Niagara Falls is about 2 hours from Toronto (assuming ideal traffic conditions), and 30 minutes from Buffalo.

From New York, Boston, and the East Coast:  Take I-90 west towards Buffalo to the 290 west.  Exit onto the 190 north towards Grand Island and Niagara Falls.

The train ride from there to downtown Toronto is another 60 minutes. However, during the summer, on Fridays (or Thursday if Friday is a holiday) evenings and weekends/holidays there are express bus services that run directly to/from Burlington station. These buses take around 65 minutes to reach Niagara Falls from Burlington. A one-way standard ticket is $21.15 to/from Toronto (as of 2019). The buses have coach style seating but seating is not reserved and there are no washrooms, wi-fi services, or any on-board amenities. Buses run every 60 minutes on weekends/holidays and 60-90 minutes on weekdays.
Taxi service to the Falls and main tourist area from the bus depot will run $10-15, If you fancy a walk the route is simple and easy, although nearly 5 km (3 mi), and has the advantage of seeing the Falls come slowly into view.

 Niagara Region Transit (intercity), ☏ +1 833-678-5463. Operates regional bus service connecting Niagara Falls (Ontario), Fort Erie, St. Catharines, Port Colborne, and Welland.

GO Transit, the regional rail and bus service in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton area offers two train services between Toronto and Niagara Falls. The most useful service for visitors is the Niagara Weekend GO Train Service which runs year-round on weekends and most statutory holidays, more often in summer, less so during off season. Less useful for visitors is the GO Transit workday commuter service running one train to Toronto in the early morning, returning in the evening to Niagara Falls.

Maple Leaf, GO weekend Niagara Train, and GO Bus services bypass the city. The train can accommodate bicycles.
Get around[edit]

The Niagara River whirlpool basin
On foot[edit]
Many of the main attractions are within walking distance depending on where you walk from, and the rest are easily accessible by transit. Some roads are steep so it may be preferable to drop elderly family members off near the Falls before parking.
During the busiest tourist season (May - October), the Niagara Parkway and Queen Victoria Park along the Canadian side of the Falls, can become very crowded and finding a "picture perfect" view of the Falls is difficult. Walking to the attractions can be slow during peak tourist season with thousands of people bustling by.
If you want to park your car and walk around the city, consider parking at the Niagara Casino (near the Hilton Hotel). It is a flat $5 every time you leave the garage; there is no limit on how long you can leave your car inside the garage.

Niagara-on-the-Lake is a pretty, historic town located about 20 minutes north of Niagara Falls. Each summer it hosts the Shaw Festival, featuring the works of George Bernard Shaw and his contemporaries. There are also a number of wineries in the area that you can visit.  WEGO Transit runs a shuttle service to Niagara-on-the-Lake from the Floral Clock seasonally (approximately May to October). Worth a day trip, if only for the stroll and quaint shops.
A short trip over the Niagara River via the Rainbow Bridge, Niagara Falls, New York is a more low-key affair. The centrepiece of the American side is Niagara Falls State Park, a quiet patch of well-manicured greenery where you'll find the Cave of the Winds, which takes you behind the falls down a series of wooden staircases. There are also hiking trails and an observation deck.
