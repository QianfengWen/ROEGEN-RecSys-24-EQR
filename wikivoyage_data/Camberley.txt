St Michael's, Camberley
Camberley is a town in Surrey. Camberley is an up-and-coming and expanding town, which is known for being close to the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. The main part of the town is north of the M3 with the older villages of Frimley, Frimley Green, Deepcut and Mytchett that have merged into the town south of the Motorway.


Understand[edit]
The settlement which grew up adjacent to the Staff College, was first named Cambridge Town after a local hotel, but this name proved unfortunate for officials of the Royal Mail. They were concerned that much of the Cambridge Town's post might end up in an ancient university city on the edge of the Fens in eastern England. Thus, the name of the Victorian upstart was quickly changed to Camberley, to match older local place names such as Frimley, Hawley and Yateley.

Get in[edit]
Camberley is 30 miles (50 km) away from central London and quite convenient to reach the M3/M25 corridor and Heathrow airport.

By bus[edit]
Camberley is served by many bus routes from Woking, Farnborough, Aldershot and Farnham.

By plane[edit]
Camberley is well served by London's collection of airports. For travellers coming directly to Camberley, the most convenient (in reducing order of convenience) are:

Heathrow Airport is about 25 minutes drive along the M25 motorway and the M3.
Gatwick Airport is about an hour's drive away via the M23 (northbound), M25 (anti-clockwise) and M3 (southbound) roads.
By train[edit]
51.336-0.7451 Camberley station is not on a main line and services to London operate via Ascot station. Services run from London Waterloo via Ascot (change trains at Ascot) but run quite slowly, with journey times taking at least an hour. Direct services run to Guildford every 30 minutes and take about 45 minutes to reach the centre. There are also direct services that run to Reading and Gatwick Airport via Blackwater station (about every 30 minutes, with a journey time of about 20 minutes) which is roughly 1½ miles south west of the town centre heading in a straight line along the London Road.

By car[edit]
Travelling from central London, Heathrow or Gatwick airports, Camberley can be reached via the M25 at Junction 12 heading on the M3 in the direction of Southampton and the South West. Leave the motorway at Junction 4.

Camberley's White Elephant
Travelling by car is by far the best option for getting around Camberley and the surrounding area. Richmond, Hammersmith and Chiswick and most other parts of West London can be easily accessed via the M3 and the journey will take 30 - 45 mins. Camberley is also very convenient for reaching Southampton and the south west coast, with journey times of 45 minutes very achievable.
If entering Camberley from the west on the A30, look out for the concrete elephant on your right, which has guarded the entrance to Surrey from Hampshire and Berkshire since 1963.
