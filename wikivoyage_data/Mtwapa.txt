Mtwapa is in Coastal Kenya. It is a dusty place, about 15 km north of Mombasa and one of the fastest growing communities in Kenya with about 91,000 inhabitants in 2019.
Mtwapa is particularly popular with guests who want to spend a longer time on Kenya's coast without wanting to afford the expensive luxury beach resorts. It therefore attracts many long-term visitors, especially retirees, who appreciate the affordable rental prices and enjoy the warm sun here during their winter holidays. Mtwapa is not a tourist resort, but a typical Kenyan small town. Mtwapa is known as the "village that never sleeps". Even long after midnight, the streets and pubs are full and even street vendors are out and about.


Understand[edit]
Mtwapa Creek
People who want to spent their holidays at the wonderful beaches of Kenya and to go on a safari tour have to decide whether to go to South Coast or North Coast, which simply means south or north of Mombasa. While the South Coast has the nicer beaches and more primordial nature the North Coast around Mombasa and Mtwapa offer much more action and activities.
There exists a lack of modern public transport (tram, metro) in combination with chaotic traffic in Mombasa and associated development of urban suburbs to new centres. On the other hand many Europeans settle there and bring development. Mtwapa is known as “the village that never sleeps”. Even long after midnight the pubs are busy, even sellers are in the streets, and a lot of people walk around. It is the centre of night life and prostitution in the area of Mombasa. Also boosted by the many Europeans who are building homes for retirement or just spending the winter there, the place is now trending for Kenyans as well and property prices and construction activity are growing steadily. Mtwapa is not a tourist resort, but a typical Kenyan town with noise, dust and chaotic traffic.

Climate[edit]
Climate in Mtwapa
The climate in Mtwapa is tropical wet and warm. The best travel time is from late November to mid-March. After that it gets uncomfortably hot with increased humidity. The worst travel time is in the main rainy season from April to June. Due to lack of sewerage in no time the roads are flooded and muddy and it is difficult to make any excursions. Mostly it rains only briefly and then the sun is shining again, but also continuous rain for days may ocour. In the resulting puddles, the mosquitoes multiply abruptly and the malaria and dengue fever risk increases. Also in the 2nd rainy season, October-November, you have to reckon with inconveniences. There are almost no museums or other attractions that you can visit even in the rain, only some temples and shopping malls in Mombasa.

Most people come to Mtwapa via Mombasa airport. After leaving the airport in Mombasa, many eager young men want to carry your luggage to the waiting vehicle. Do not accept these offers. Some of these luggage carriers require up to Ksh 1000 for services rendered. It is just a few metres away, and you can take a free luggage van with your luggage.
The cheapest way to reach Mtwapa from Mombasa is by minibuses (matatus) at about Ksh 100 (2017). Mtwapa is the terminal station for Matatus going from Mombasa centre (Post Office) via Nyali direction north coast. By taxi you will need Ksh 2500-3000 from Mombasa airport to Mtwapa. With Uber about Ksh 1500-2000.
If you are coming from Diani Beach or Watamu then booking the Hakuna Matatu Bus [dead link] is an easy way to reach Mtwapa (you can get off at the Nyali stop or ask the driver to drop you after the Mtwapa bridge).  The shuttle will cost around US$10-12

Get around[edit]
Motorbike taxis are used by most people within the village at about Ksh 25/km. The bicycle taxis (once common there) are not operating anymore. Normal taxis are Ksh 50-100/km and tricycles (Tuktuks) about Ksh 50-75/km (depending on road condition). A much cheaper alternative to regular taxis are the shuttle services Uber, Taxify, Little [formerly dead link] , Mondo Ride[dead link], MaraMoja.

Do[edit]
Most tourists visit Mtwapa because of its unique night and day life. Mtwapa is known as the "village that never sleeps" with all kind of entertainment that tourists expect to find, like discos, bars, restaurants, and also prostitution. Mombasa and especially Mtwapa are known for sex tourism. You will find contact with Kenyan women and men on the beach or in the beach bars, who try to bind themselves to a tourist in search of a better life. Money, not sympathy, is what they are looking for. Take the usual precautions against HIV infections if you decide to have sex in Mtwapa.
Boat trips into the creek (~Ksh 5000), hire a sailing boat or deep sea fishing. All start in the immediate vicinity of Moorings Restaurant.
Watersports: at Kanamai and Shandzu Beach, diving, snorkelling, surfing, etc.
Glass bottom boat tour plus snorkelling at Mombasa Marine Park. Park entrance fee: USD 17, tour costs Ksh 1500-2000.
Mountain bike tours around the creek.
Karting: 5 km south of Mtwapa at Bamburi Beach
Paint Ball: Information at the kart track in Bamburi
Children's playgrounds: There is a place right next to the bridge over the creek, opposite the Mtwapa Police. A larger Lunapark is located towards Mombasa at the entrance of Mamba Village (Left Rd., At the Nyali Golf Club). The Wildwater Adventure Bath nearby is also popular with children.
Walking: Mtwapa town is too noisy to enjoy walking. The 4-km walk along the beach starting at the Maridadi Restaurant near Kanamai to the Sand Castle Beach Bar at the end of the beach near Kikambala is a real pleasure, as the beach is only frequented by locals and very few tourists. Therefore you can enjoy quiet walking without being bothered by beach boys or souvenir sellers.
Safaris: There are good travel offices in Mtwapa but it might be good to also check the offers of the big companies situated in Mombasa or Diani Beach. Most common safari destinations from Mtwapa are Maasai Mara, Tsavo East National Park, Tsavo West National Park and Shimba Hills National Reserve. The Tsavo National Parks are easy to reach from the coast by car and you will find here basically all the animals. Tsavo East is more open, with many animals. Tsavo West is rocky with many shrubs and relatively few animals in interesting landscape. Amboseli is quite flat, often dusty, with a large swamp area and spectacular views of the Kilimanjaro, many elephants. This park is more recommended in combination with the Tsavos, but you should then plan several nights. Masai Mara are mostly flight safaris, with short distances, all animals to find, usually even better than in the other parks. You can also drive in each park with your own car or a rental car. This is cheaper than guided safaris, but you also have less wildlife sightings. But there is also the possibility hire a guide. At the park entrances or at the park hotel you can ask for guides. The main routes in the parks are mostly well signposted, but on the small slopes you can quickly lose your bearings if you do not know the area.
Beaches[edit]
Mtwapa also has nice beaches with beach hotels or beach bars which are not crowded and perfect for relaxing:

-3.950239.76891 Jumba Ruins Beach. a small but very nice and lonely beach (updated Nov 2018)

-3.9651639.760264 Shanzu Beach. It is a very scenic beach and less frequented than Bambouri Beach. Day and night life is there but less than at Bamburi beach. reachable even with motorbike taxi (updated Nov 2018)
-3.999139.73145 Bamburi Beach. The most lively beach near Mombasa, good day and night live, often crowded by locals, many hotels, pubs, beach bars, beach boys and beach girls, sellers, reachable by Matatu. At Big Tree Beach Bar you can hire a locker to enjoy the beach without your belongings getting stolen while you are in the water. At low tide you can go at the northern end of the beach around two rocks to Shanzu Beach. The tidal range between low tide and high tide is very pronounced on the Mtwapa coast! If you want to go for a walk along the beach, you should inform yourself in advance about the tides, because it can happen that the way back is cut off through the returning tide (updated Nov 2018)
-3.939739.77626 Kanamai Beach. A scenic beach with typical palms and white sand. Once a centre of tourism is now only frequented by locals. To reach there is best by taxi as the road is quite rough (updated Nov 2018)
-3.801139.83437 Vipingo Beach. A number of beautiful and almost natural beaches line up in this area, about 20km north of Mtwapa. They are best reached by car. In the area around Vipingo there are still remnants of the coastal forest, which used to stretch all along the coast, which is an important refuge for the now rare flora and fauna of the coastal forest. In and between this forest there are ancient tombs and mosques and other sites of the former culture of the coastal inhabitants. If you're in the area, visit the  Vipingo Ridge , a modern and stylish hotel complex that includes an 18-hole golf course and residential buildings. (updated Nov 2018)
-3.833439.82558 Kuruwitu Beach. It is very quiet and almost natural beach with remnants of coastal forest and palm trees lining the beach. Kuruwitu Beach is part of a marine reserve and conservation area. Therefore the coral reef is in good condition and an impressive, colorful diversity of flora and fauna can be seen while snorkeling, diving or from a glass bottom boat. Also dolphins and sea turtles can be spotted here as well. Boat trips to the reef are offered. But you can also take part in a guided hike to the reef instead at low tide. (updated Nov 2018)
Buy[edit]
Street market
Money: At the ATMs in Mtwapa all popular international cards work fine and at all banks cash can be exchanged. A good place for banks and ATMs is the Mtwapa Mall.  The exchange course at the banks is better than in hotels where you can also exchange money. When banks are closed there are some shops with good rates next to the Cheers Restaurant in Bamburi along the main road to Mombasa. In larger shops and hotels you can usually pay with credit cards.
Like in all of Africa, haggling is common in small shops. Especially if you are an obvious foreigner, the initial price is usually higher than what is normally paid for the merchandise.

Souvenirs: At the beaches, sellers will offer you things whose trade and export are prohibited under the Washington Convention on Species Protection, like claws of lions, certain sea animals, butterflies, shells, and starfish. Even if one finds mussels, starfish or snails on the beach, they can be protected species. In case of doubt, leave it. The penalties are very high. Woodworking, clothing, handicrafts, etc. can be purchased without hesitation. In all hotels, along the streets and at the beach of Bamburi and Shanzu, there are stands where crafts and country-style clothes are offered. The prices and the choice of these articles are by far better at the places described under "Buy" in Mombasa.
Food: The best shopping, especially for international food, is the Quick Mart & Carrefour Supermarkets  in Bamburi or Mtwapa and the Naivas  supermarkets. German bread and good rolls are available in the "Wellfit Bakery" where you can also enjoy a delicious coffee with a Northern European cake. The café or bakery lies diagonally opposite the "Catholic Church" in Mtwapa. The largest supermarkets in Mtwapa are the Quick Mart with a large assortment. The small one is on the main road in the centre of Mtwapa, the big one in the Mtwapa Mall at the northern end of the village. For the purchase of vegetables and fruits there is a small market and many stands along the main street. However, the prices are quite high and for bigger purchases of fruit and vegetables the way to the Kongowea market (just before the bridge to Mombasa) is worth it.
Pharmacies you can find along the main street called Chemist, also hardware shops and a fruit market.
If you are looking for things to buy and cannot find a shop just ask one of the Tuktuk or motorbike taxi drivers.

Eat[edit]

Restaurant at midtown
Most restaurants on the coast are a combination of beach bar and restaurant. You can either just order drinks or eat there too. You should allow plenty of time in many restaurants, as it can take an hour from ordering to eating, as everything is always freshly prepared. A starter is recommended if you are very hungry. About 10 per cent of the invoice amount is common as a tip, but only if the food tasted good and service was good.

Those wishing to eat on a low budget should bear in mind the old adage for all tropical areas: "Cook it, peel it or forget it".

Sleep[edit]
For normal beach tourism, Mombasa-Bamburi/Shandzu Beach (5 km to the south) and the Kanamai-Kikamballa Beach (7 km to the north) are more pleasant places to stay than in Mtwapa town. It's a party place for people that prefer night life over beach life and for many often retired Europeans that want to spent several months to escape from the winter cold in their countries and need cheaper accommodation than the luxury beach hotels.
Prices for housing start at €20/month for huts without any comfort outside the centre to about €300/month for comfortable flats in a nice environment. Flats are usually mediated by real estate brokers. Prices for hotels and guest houses are listed in the well known Internet booking sites or airbnb. Cheap simple rooms with cooking facility and private bathroom start from Ksh 1000 per night.
In all accommodations, things of value and cash should never be left in the room, but only in the hotel safe!

The large all-inclusive hotels do not allow any local guests at the hotel. If you are looking for a place to stay where guests are allowed, then you have to go to smaller "girl-friendly hotels" without a "joiner fee", in which companions can spend the night without additional costs. Such hotels are referred to as "girl-friendly" or "guest-friendly" in Kenya.

Work[edit]
Volunteer service: Many young people want to work in social institutions for a certain time in Kenya, preferably on the coast. It should be clear that it is not a question of making better work than the local people or of "developing aid", but of learning from each other. Most of the reputable organizations do not take anyone under one year, because especially when working with children attachment and relationship is important, and in short-term stays, only work for the local people is caused without giving anything. As Mtwapa is a relative safe place and many foreigners live here its a popular place for volunteers too. Be aware that there are many fake organizations that are only after the money of the volunteers! It is hopeless to look for any payment as young unskilled volunteer.
Connect[edit]
Internet and telephone: In most hotels there is Wifi, often however only at the front desk. There is a shop with the Kenyan network provider Safaricom above the Quick Mart supermarket in Bamburi. Safaricom offer Internet bundles and also SIM cards for openline mobile phones.
Power adapter: In Kenya, the British three-pin plugs are used (220 V). It is advisable to buy an adapter with voltage protection at your home country. Voltage fluctuations are common in Kenya, and so mobile phones or computers are protected against it. At Quick Mart you can get the appropriate adapters in Mtwapa, but without the voltage protection.
The power supply is not always guaranteed in Mtwapa and it comes again and again to power outages. Therefore, you should definitely have a powerful (solar) power bank for your mobile and a flash light in your luggage.
Stay safe[edit]
Photos: To take photos of people, ask for permission, also at night in the pubs. Prohibited are photos of military and public facilities such as police stations, banks, and ferries.  Be careful! In Mtwapa some of the well known pubs are next to banks. Taking pictures in front of the pub might be risky.
Beach boys:  Along the beaches of Bamburi or Shanzu, there are always quite a number of them who want to sell something. Even if the majority is very friendly, you might feel very annoyed after some time. Best is to ignore them totally. Just do not answer to them, not even "no thanks" or anything else. This is, of course, impolite, but they will stop molesting you. On the beaches of Coba Cabana, Beach Africa or Kikambala are almost no beach boys and there you have your peace and can walk around or lie in the sand unencumbered.
Bathing: Depending on the tide the sea can sometimes have high dangerous waves and currents and undercurrents should not be underestimated. Especially when the water runs out, one should not swim too far. Even though there is a lot of prostitution at the beaches in Mtwapa, nudism or going topless is prohibited, as is sex at the beach at night. The police understand little fun here, and takes firm action.
Beach shoes: At low tide you can undertake wonderful hikes on the coral reef, especially at Kikambala Beach. Since the coral rock is quite sharp-edged, shoes are advantageous. Simple beach shoes made of soft plastic are, however, completely unsuitable, because on the coral reef also live sea urchins, whose long and pointed spines can easily pierce the plastic soles. Old sandals with thick solid soles are more suitable.
Invitations: Going as a white guy with Kenyans to a pub in Mtwapa or a restaurant it is expected that you pay. If you invite a Kenyan out to a restaurant, you are also expected to pay their transport costs, especially if you are a man inviting a woman. If you do not want to do that, then first check it out! If you are invited home to locals, the guest gift should be according to the occasion. To bring nothing is offensive! Better generous than greedy! This is, of course, only for family visits. Visiting "beach boys" or "beach girls" is another matter.
Diarrhea: Hardly anyone is spared from diarrhea during a tropical journey. Rarely it is at the foreign food, but mostly at the enjoyment of too cold beverages.  In almost every pharmacy in Kenya "Dia Stop" is available. These tablets help immediately and reliably.
Sun protection and mosquito repellent: Sun cream is very expensive in Kenya, so it is better to bring it with you. Its very important to use due to the strong tropical sunshine. Mosquito sprays, on the other hand, are cheap and good in Kenya. Except in the rainy season, there are very few to no mosquitoes in Mtwapa and at the hotels at Bamburi or Shanzu Beach or even on safari. Especially the legs should be protected.
Safety: Frequently, employees of the tour operators warn guests not to leave the hotel on their own. It is completely unfounded, and you often get the suspicion that these warnings only serve to ensure that the travellers book the overpriced tour offers, accept bad exchange rates, and shop in the usually only modest but always far too expensive offers of the hotel shops. It is not dangerous to walk around during the day as long as you stay in the tourist areas and don’t enter slums. Mtwapa is a safer place than many other towns in Kenya. The more valuable things you carry around visibly, the greater the danger of arousing desires of thieves. At night always use a taxi to go to the bars or restaurants and back (not motorbike taxi or tuktuk). This is the best way to avoid any problems.
Passport: You are required to carry identification in Kenya. But you don’t have to carry your passport all time, a copy does well too. Therefore its good to make a copy of the passport on the first day of arrival in the hotel. Important is the first page and the page with the visa, which you get at the entry.
Visa: If you intend to spend the winter in Kenya, the normal visa, which is valid for 90 days, must be lengthened. This can usually be obtained on-site without any problems by an additional 90 days at an "immigration office"[dead link]. In Mombasa, the office is located at the old harbour in the old town.
