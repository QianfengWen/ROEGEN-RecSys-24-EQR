Uddevalla is a city of 35,000 people (2015), with a total of 57,000 in Uddevalla Municipality (2021), in Bohuslän, on the west coast of Sweden.
Uddevalla is a nice little town, with a river cutting through the city center. The town burnt down more than a few times in the 18th and 19th centuries, so there are but a few old wooden buildings left. Most older buildings date from the beginning of the 20th century.
