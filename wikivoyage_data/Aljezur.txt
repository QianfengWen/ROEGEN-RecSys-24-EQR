Understand[edit]

Aljezur (ahl-zh(ih)-ZOOR, /aɫ.ʒɨ.ˈzuɾ/) has about 6,200 residents (2021).
Aljezur Castle, located at the top of the hill in the bend of Ribeira de Aljezur, was built by the Moors in the 10th century and spread throughout the following centuries. After the conquest of D. Paio Peres Correia, in 1249, the castle was given to the order of Santiago, as it lost its military importance and was abandoned in the 15th century. The port established below the castle was an important trading point, because the Ribeira de Aljezur was navigable until the 16th century and its entrance was the only safe access to the sea along the surrounding jagged coast. And for this reason, in 1280, King D. Dinis gave the “Foral Charter” to the city of Aljezur.
After the devastation of the earthquake in 1755, the Bishop of Faro, Francisco Gomes de Avelar, began a new establishment on the eastern coast of the stream around the church, the Igreja Nova.

Beaches: The beaches on this part of the Algarve coast, the Costa Vicentina, are less frequented, even during high season, because it is still an area almost untouched by mass tourism. Heavy seas caused by strong westerly winds in autumn, winter and early spring attract surfers and other extreme sportsmen from around the world.
Hiking: The high plateau of the natural park offers ideal conditions for hiking all year round. The abundant flora of this region is especially beautiful in spring, starting in February. There are several scenic spots above the steep cliffs that offer us a wonderful panoramic view of the jagged rocks and sandy beaches of the western coast and the rough waves of the Atlantic.
Bird watching: The southern part of the natural park between Sagres and Vila do Bispo is the ideal region to observe different species of birds that live here or that simply stop their migration to and from Africa. The best time of year to learn more about the lives and habits of these birds is in October. There are many places in the municipality of Vila do Bispo to observe the birds that rest well protected on the cliffs and rocky walls. The birdwatching festival offers an excellent opportunity for visitors interested in participating in expert-guided tours.
Menhirs: Traces of prehistoric notes can be found near Vila do Bispo and Raposeira. The walking route (Megalitic route) takes you through the menhir field in Montes dos Amantes between Sagres and Vila do Bispo.
