For other places with the same name, see Southampton (disambiguation).

Southampton is the largest city in Hampshire, on the south coast of England. A busy cruise ship and container port, Southampton is the European end of the last Transatlantic ocean liner route, the Queen Mary II to New York, and in 1912 was the point of departure for the Titanic.


Understand[edit]
Southampton has been a settlement since Roman and Saxon times. In Saxon times the town was known as Hamwic. The Roman ruins are situated in a suburb called Bitterne Manor - which was known as Clausentum in Roman times. Its privileged position on England's south coast made it Britain's premier trading post. The town became walled in the medieval era, and some remnants of these defences remain throughout the city, most notably the Bargate in the middle of the city centre. Southampton was devastated by bombing during the Second World War, meaning that much of the city and its heritage was destroyed. As such the town and its architecture has quite a modern feel to it.
Southampton has grown rapidly and is the largest city in Hampshire. The two universities (Solent University and the University of Southampton) mean that there is a large student population.

By plane[edit]
50.9503-1.35671 Southampton Airport (SOU  IATA), a short distance to the north in Eastleigh, receives regular services from many airports across the British Isles, including Belfast City, Dublin, Edinburgh, Manchester, and the three main Channel Islands. KLM operate a year-round feeder service from their hub at Amsterdam Schiphol, but other services from continental Europe are seasonal. A railway station adjacent to the airport is served by regular trains into Southampton Central; the journey takes about 8 min. National rail connections include Bournemouth (45 min), Reading (45 min), London Waterloo (1 hr 15 min), Birmingham New Street (2 hr 30 min) and Manchester Piccadilly (4 hr).
Much bigger airports are within easy reach of Southampton by rail, car or bus. The most convenient are:

London Heathrow Airport (LHR IATA) is the UK's largest airport, and Europe's primary international hub. It is about 60 mi (97 km) drive from Southampton via the M4 (westbound), M25 (anti-clockwise) and the M3 (southbound). There is a RailAir coach service to Woking station, where mainline trains to Southampton can be boarded. National Express offers scheduled bus service from the Central Bus Station at Heathrow, between Terminals 2 and 3, to Southampton Coach Station.
London Gatwick Airport (LGW IATA) is the UK's third largest airport. It is about 80 mi (130 km) drive from Southampton via the M23 (northbound), M25 (clockwise) and M3 (southbound) motorways. Monday to Saturday there is an hourly direct train service to Southampton from a rail station in the airport terminal complex, taking just under 2 hours; on Sundays at least one transfer is necessary resulting in travel times between 2 and 2½ hours.
Stansted (STN IATA) and Luton (LTN IATA), both north of London, have a good range of budget flights but are harder to reach from Southampton: you either have to crawl around on the congested M25, or take a train into London then out again.
Bournemouth Airport (BOH IATA) is 30 mi (48 km) west of Southampton along the M27 and A31. It only has a few holiday flights to the Med.

There are no international ferry services: these call in Portsmouth about 20 mi (32 km) to the east. However, regular vehicle and passenger ferries operate to Southampton from Cowes on the nearby Isle of Wight and the village of Hythe in the New Forest. 
Southampton is also Cunard's main port, being the eastern end of Queen Mary 2’s transatlantic liner service to and from New York City. Cunard also serves other destinations.

By bike[edit]
Southampton has a few dedicated cycle routes; they are not particularly well linked but cyclists should not have a problem navigating the city centre.  The city centre is mostly flat; Hampshire tends to undulate.

Buy[edit]
Westquay South with L'Osteria
Southampton sells itself as the shopping capital of the South Coast and the Westquay Shopping Centre does nothing to dispel you of that opinion.

50.9033-1.4071 Westquay Shopping Centre, Harbour Parade, SO15 1QF. M-F 9AM-8PM, Sa 9AM-7PM, Su 11AM-5PM. John Lewis and Marks & Spencer are the major draws, but there are 97 other shops happy to separate you from your hard-earned cash. An extension to this popular shopping centre, Westquay South, includes a 10-screen 4k cinema, up to 20 extra restaurants and a public square.   (updated Jul 2018)
50.906-1.40742 The Marlands, Civic Centre Rd, Hants, SO14 7SJ. M-W F 9AM-5:30PM, Th 9AM-7PM, Sa 9AM-6PM, Su 11AM-5PM. A smaller shopping centre constructed to a PostModern design in 1991. The rent is lower than West Quay and hence the retailers are less salubrious. Retailers include Route One, CEX and The Disney Store.   (updated Jul 2018)
Above Bar Street is the main pedestrian thoroughfare joining the shopping centres to each other with even more retailers, large and small. You won't be surprised to find that the same stores as are on most British high streets such as TK Maxx, HMV, Topshop and Primark have made this their home. Above Bar Street is also the home of special shopping events. The German Market runs in December, and the area around the Bargate has the Farmer's Market on the second Saturday of each month.
A short walk to the north of Southampton's main city centre are Bedford Place and London Road. By day and night, the bars, coffee shops, pubs and restaurants are a hive of activity.
Southeast of the city centre, Oxford Street hosts independent boutiques, salons, bars and restaurants and maintains a more historic feel.

Eat[edit]
There are two main areas for eating out in Southampton; the first is Oxford Street (towards Ocean Village) and the second is around Bedford Place (just north of the city).
The choice in Bedford Place is rather more varied; ranging from Moroccan and Mexican at the southern end of the road through student style curry houses and a Chinese to some late night kebab and chip shops. In terms of value for money the Pride of India is one of best Indians in the city, but most of the restaurants are good value, if not exactly awe-inspiring taste-wise.
Walking distance from Bedford Place is the area of town that used to be known as Hungry Hill; Commercial Road where the existence of the Mayflower Theatre has meant a thriving trade for various restaurants in pre- and post-theatre eating. Again the choice is varied although generally the quality to cost ratio is not as high as it might otherwise be; although Buon Gusto (Italian) and Cafe Pattaya (Thai) are particularly recommended.

Budget[edit]
There is the usual range of fast food chains spread throughout the city. In the city centre you find the chain restaurants of Tortilla, Greggs (bakery), Franco Manca and the IKEA restaurant. 
Formerly Burger King and McDonalds faced each other across the Bargate like petulant children with the gate acting like a peace-making mother, but McDonalds gave up the fight and fled to the Westquay shopping centre in which you can also find a large selection of 'sit-down' restaurants like Pizza Hut, Nando's, Pizza Express, Yo Sushi!, Wagamama and Cafe Rouge.
Furthermore, there are many takeaways in Southampton that do delivery and allow you to pick up the food yourself. Typical meals range from £7-15. Check with your hotel/hostel if they allow food orders.

Spanish tapas restaurant in a Georgian-style building directly adjoined to the 14th-century walls, is a good choice and has views overlooking the historic Harbour House, the ferry terminal and Hythe. (updated Feb 2023)
Splurge[edit]
Oxford Street has a selection of higher class (and therefore more expensive) restaurants.

50.8982-1.398213 White Star, 28 Oxford St, SO14 3DJ. English/traditional (updated Feb 2023)
Drink[edit]
As is to be expected of a large port with two universities, there are a lot of places to drink in Southampton. The city centre features two pubs dating from Tudor times, the Red Lion in High Street in particular is steeped in history.
Portswood is the drinking area of choice for students at the university, so keep away from places like The Hobbit, 50.91824-1.395231 Clowns and Jesters ("Jesters"), 50.92351-1.395172 The Gordon Arms and 
50.92674-1.390843 The Mitre if you want to avoid students. While The 
50.91878-1.395184 Hobbit.    can be studenty, it is definitely worth a look as it is a quirky pub with a massive beer garden and live music every night of the week. The Shooting Star (previously known as Kolebka) is a relaxed jazz bar with live music every Friday night. Further up on Porstwood Road, The Brook is a dedicated venue for bands.
The Polygon (also referred to as "Bedford Place") is where most of the clubs and bars in the city lie, such as 50.91238-1.40495 "Orange Rooms" (a club/bar with a wider variety of music) and 50.91243-1.405376 "Pop World" (a retro-themed nightclub).
The Marina area has a good (albeit expensive) selection of seafront bars.
The 50.89895-1.403587 Red Lion, 55 High St, SO14 2NS (in High Street), ☏ +44 23 8033 3595. dates back to Tudor times and is a must-see. It's usually fairly quiet as well.   (updated Jul 2023)
For those looking for something more lively, The 50.89633-1.403478 Platform Tavern nearby on the waterfront is an excellent bet as it features live jazz and blues music and a superb selection of local real ales.
50.90604-1.400979 The Angel, next to one of the central parks, is an excellent 'local' type pub in the city centre featuring a free drinks quiz and friendly landlord.
The city centre also has the usual spattering of chain pubs, including 50.90626-1.4048210 Slug & Lettuce and four Wetherspoon's. For those looking for a more alternative atmosphere, there is also 50.90479-1.4033411 The Firehouse Nightclub, with cheap drinks, friendly staff and customers with a varied spectrum of music from metal/industrial, indie and general rock music.
Outside of the city centre are the usual local pubs, some of which are excellent and others which are best avoided. The 50.92355-1.4370312 Park Inn in Shirley and the 50.91242-1.4235713 Wellington Arms and 50.91242-1.4235714 Waterloo Arms in Freemantle all have an excellent range of real ales. Nearby and next to St Denys railway station are two more excellent pubs, the 50.92063-1.3882915 Junction Inn and 50.92167-1.3876116 South Western Arms. The 50.91514-1.3976117 Rockstone in Bevois Valley is brilliant: it has a great selection of beers, whiskys and rums, and the selection of food is vast, including plenty of vegan options, ever-changing and of impeccable quality.

50.92049-1.3956418 The Bookshop Alehouse, 21 Portswood Rd, SO17 2ES. One of a number of micropubs in Southampton. Formerly a bookshop, a full bookshelf remains from its previous existence, tba is small and friendly. The beers are changed regularly. Apart from bar snacks there is no food available, however customers can bring in their own food from a nearby takeaway. Staff will most likely give you a napkin and possibly cutlery. St Denys train station is a short walk away and buses to the city centre go right by this pub. There are several bike stands outside too. (updated Sep 2018)
50.92564-1.3924819 Muse Coffee Co., 14 Broadway, Portswood Road, SO17 2WE, portswood@musecoffeeco.co.uk. 7AM-7PM. Sells sandwiches, patisseries and cakes. They do not sell alcohol. (updated Apr 2021)
Sleep[edit]
The Hilton Southampton provides 4-star luxury in a pleasant environment, you can expect comfortable and stylish guestrooms.
3-star hotels are much easier to come by, the 50.91075-1.401221 Leonardo Hotel sits in the middle of a city centre roundabout, the 50.90555-1.415132 Novotel, 50.919-1.40333 Travelodge, Holiday Inn and 50.90571-1.414394 Hotel Ibis are all perfectly adequate for providing a night's sleep.
If you feel the need for a less generic hotel experience, 50.90015-1.403545 The Dolphin Mercure hotel and 50.9008-1.403816 The Star are both on the High Street in traditional coaching inn buildings and will make you feel less like you're just a commodity.
If you're on the cheap, or feel like a more personal stay, then there are plenty of bed and breakfasts; most cluster around the bottom end of Hill Lane which is close to the train station. Wander out from the station's main exit (if you see Toys 'R' Us opposite you're on the wrong exit) and take the path by the left side of the HSBC office block. Hill Lane leads up the small hill from the traffic lights. Keep going up the hill until you find one worth staying at; don't forget to check the side streets too.
Tourist Information will almost certainly be able to find you somewhere to stay if you're stuck (☏ +44 23 8083 3333).

Levels of crime in Southampton are fairly similar to other UK cities; serious crimes are uncommon, but alcohol-related crimes and muggings can happen. There is a strong police presence in the city centre at night time, especially around the clubs and pubs. A night bus service is available to allow people to get home safely. Pollution levels can get rather high particularly when one of the larger cruise ships is in harbor.
