The waterfall
52.376981-3.8499151 Devils Bridge Waterfall (located adjacent to the three bridges). Welsh folklore says that one of the bridges was built by the Devil for an old lady. Take care on the steep steps as they can be slippery due to the spray and moss. Long decent and climb, walking shoes recommended, but well worth it for the spectacular falls in the tree-lined ravine.

52.346959-3.8103472 Hafod Estate (Hafod Uchtryd) (parking with information board just past Hafod Church). Remains of landscaped estate in the wooded Ystwyth valley, with some excellent walks. Map and guide at the parking spot with honesty box for purchase or return at end of the walk. Church is also worth a visit for local history information.   (updated Sep 2016)
