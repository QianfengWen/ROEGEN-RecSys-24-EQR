Trần Phú Street and the beach
Nha Trang, sometimes spelt Nhatrang, is Vietnam's most famous seaside resort town, and the scuba diving centre of Vietnam. It's more lively and urban in character than other beach destinations such as Mui Ne and Phu Quoc.


Understand[edit]
Traces of human settlement in Nha Trang date back to the Cham Empire, though in times of Vietnamese rule, there wasn't much more here than small fishing villages. The French recognised that this beautiful bay, with its islands and white sand beaches, made for a perfect bathing spot, and began the transformation into a resort town. American soldiers agreed, and Nha Trang became a favourite R&R stop during the war.
After the end of Vietnam war, the Soviet military became increasingly more present in the Cam Ranh Bay, just south of Nha Trang. After retiring, many Russian military personnel settled down in Nha Trang and opened tourism businesses, leading to an increasing influx of Russian tourists to the city, who form nowadays the bulk of foreign tourists - in the main tourism area of Nha Trang, signs in Russian are even more common than in English. In the 21st century, Chinese tourists have become quite common as well, as in the rest of Southeast Asia.
However, Nha Trang is definitely not a Westernized resort town like Kuta in Bali - it is hugely popular among Vietnamese tourists, who go to the beach mainly on early morning and late afternoon, and spend the rest of the day enjoying other attractions including mud baths or Vinpearl Land - dubbed Vietnam's Disneyland, although it's probably more akin to Singapore's Sentosa.

Climate[edit]
The monsoon season is from Oct to mid-Dec. Sea winds can be heavy, and sometimes the weather can get pretty chilly. Summer, naturally, brings many vacation goers into town and hotel rooms get somewhat more difficult to find.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
11.999109.221 Cam Ranh International Airport (CXR  IATA) (30 km south at Cam Ranh). The 4th busiest airport in Vietnam. Opened as a commercial airport in 2004 on the grounds of a former American military airbase, replacing Nha Trang Airport. A new international terminal is less than 5 minutes' walk from the older domestic terminal.   (updated Feb 2016)
There are lots of domestic flights from Ho Chi Minh City, Vinh, Da Nang, Hanoi, Haiphong, with prices starting at 250,000 dong.
International flights to KL Malaysia (Airasia), Bangkok (BangkokAir, AirAsia),  Seoul, South Korea and to cities in China including Hong Kong (via HK Express).
Getting there and away:

By taxi – The fixed rate from the airport to downtown locations is 250,000 dong. If going by the meter, it will be about 100,000 dong more expensive.
By bus – The airport bus goes directly to the city center; 65,000 dong, 50-min ride. There are a few companies operating on this route, their buses such as the yellow Đất Mới airport buses (no.18) with 16 seats, can be found just outside opposite front entrance of the airport. They stop at certain major hotels — within the traditional tourist center the usual drop off point is hotel Liberty Central. 12.2495109.192842 Đất Mới airport bus terminal is start and end point for this airport bus route number 18. Online maps have this location called Land Transport Corp New. This bus could be used also as an economical way to visit Bai Dai beach.
By shuttle bus – Some mid-range and upscale hotels organise airport transfers, often for free.
By train[edit]
12.2483109.18433 Railway Station. 1 km north from the city centre. (updated Feb 2016)
Nha Trang is a stop on the main railway line connecting Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. The journey to Nha Trang from Ho Chi Minh City takes 6-8 hr on SE trains (often delayed), so a sleeper is not really necessary. The scenery on this journey is not that great compared to further north, so you are not missing out too much by travelling overnight.
The distance from HCMC is quite expensive, so better have a stop in Mui Ne (going there by bus) on the way.

By bus[edit]
12.258361109.1348774 Central Bus station (Bến xe phía Nam Nha Trang) (7 km west of the city center on the road Hai Mươi Ba Tháng Mười, next to the MM Mega Market. To get to the center, you can take a taxi or motocycle from here or catch the #2 city bus going East on Hai Mươi Ba Tháng Mười road. If you travelled with Phuong Trang (FUTA Bus Lines) you may catch a free shuttle bus which is operated by FUTA to your hotel and if not do not take a taxi parked beside the bus or inside the bus station (there is a gate at the front) and if in doubt ask 1) the FUTA ticket sellers inside the main hall or 2) several completely unrelated people.). (updated Aug 2017)
Nearly all long distance sleeper buses stop in Nha Trang. They come from Ho Chi Minh City (10-12 hours, both morning and overnight buses available, both are sleeper buses), Hoi An (12 hours). Besides, there are hourly buses from Da Lat (3-4 hr, hourly between 07:00-15:00) and a couple ones from Qui Nhon (6 hr, 115,000 dong, at 07:30, 08:30, 13:00 and 15:30), Mui Ne (6 hr).
However, tourist (open tour) buses may drop off passengers near the tourist areas.

By car[edit]
Private car rental with a driver are usually modern air-con cars and can be rented for about 1,000,000 dong per day. Car rental prices (as mostly anything in Vietnam) usually increase during holiday seasons especially around Tet (Vietnamese New Year). Make sure to avoid high prices by booking it beforehand with the car rental services.

Get around[edit]

Orientation[edit]
Nha Trang has two main beaches: a larger one south of the Cai river, and a smaller one on the north. The southern beach, lined by the Trần Phú avenue, is by far the most popular among the visitors. Tourism infrastructure catering to foreign tourists, including diving schools, tour agencies, western-style bars and international restaurants and cafes, is mostly concentrated in the southern part of the beach, between Nguyễn Thị Minh Khai and the old airport. In the central part of the beach, lie the upmarket international chain hotels such as Sheraton, Novotel and InterContinental. The rest of the beachfront, as well as the northern beach, has infrastructure mostly aimed at Vietnamese tourists. A few blocks far from the beach, Nha Trang is a normal, bustling Vietnamese city.

By motorbike[edit]
In Nha Trang, as in the rest of Vietnam, motorbikes are the least safe but most convenient way of going around, especially to go to the beaches and sightseeing spots outside of the city. See the general advice: Vietnam by motorcycle.

By bus[edit]
Nha Trang's city bus system is surprisingly useful for travellers that have more time than money. And they can also be used to reach the more further away sights and interesting destination outside of Nha Trang.
Buses are white and blue in color, have air conditioning, Vietnamese music, and are very cheap, typically costing around 10,000 dong. While there is very few information available, online or otherwise, about city buses, there are not many bus routes such that it is relatively easy to understand them. Also, check OpenStreetMap (which is used by this travel guide and apps like OsmAnd, Mapy.cz, Organic Maps and Maps.Me) for bus stops around and in Nha Trang, which often have the bus number in their name and can give you a clue on where the bus route goes along.
In addition, buses are rarely crowded except on peak hours. On the negative side, buses are often infrequent and with limited working hours, drivers and fare collectors seldom speak English, and bus stops are often quite far from each other. Therefore, make sure that you have enough time and patience before going somewhere by bus.
Buses are always paid with cash. Fare collectors can provide you change, but avoid using large bills. As in other cities in Vietnam, buses often do not completely stop to allow people to board, and even when they stop, they will often start moving as soon as the first person climbs the stairs of the bus. Therefore, do not stop or try to pay the fare as soon as you board the bus; instead, find a place to sit or stay and the bus fare collector will walk towards you.
Buses:

Bus #5 goes mostly along the coast, between Vinpearl cable car in the south and Hòn Xện in the north, good for reaching the Núi Cô Tiên mountain trail.
Bus #4 is probably the most useful for visitors, as it passes through the main tourist area (between Nguyễn Thị Minh Khai and the old airport) as well as many points of interest, including the Vinpearl cable car entrance, the Hòn Chồng promontory, the Po Nagar towers and Nha Trang Cathedral, as well as nearby the Cho Dam Market. Visitors staying in the main tourist area can take the bus at Nguyễn Thiện Thuật.
Bus #3 also passes through the main tourist area, and can be used to go to Doc Let beach. While this would take at least 90 minutes, it is one of the few ways to go to Doc Let for travellers which do not have their own transportation. If you find a bus stop for the #3 try asking the locals where the bus will stop, since the locations are sometimes merged and aren't where you thought they were.
On foot[edit]
Although not as treacherous as in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City, walking in Nha Trang is certainly no walk in the park. Zebra crossings are almost meaningless as no vehicle will ever stop for pedestrians crossing the street, and the few traffic lights in the city are systematically ignored. Pavements are often unusable for walking, as they are almost entirely occupied with parked motorcycles, kiosks and restaurant tables, such that pedestrians are expected to walk mostly in the road. See the general advice for crossing the road in Vietnam.
One of the few pleasant places to walk in Nha Trang is the walking path along the beach, which is quite well-maintained and lined with nice gardens, monuments and public places, although sometimes interrupted by motorcycle parking lots.

By taxi[edit]
The drivers of Mai Linh (preferably) or Vinasun taxis usually use the meter and do not attempt to cheat on tourists. A ride inside the city of Nha Trang should never cost more than a few dozen thousand dong. On the other hand, going to places outside of Nha Trang by taxi can cost hundreds of thousand dong, and possibly much more if you would like the driver to wait for you to bring you back to the city. See full list taxi Nha Trang
Grab now operates in Nha Trang for car and motorbike taxis via their smart phone app.

By cyclo[edit]
A wonderful option for seeing the sites is to hire a cyclo-driver for the day. This runs about US$15 plus tip. All the in-town highlights, the post office, and a choice of restaurants from 08:00-19:00. English skills may be basic. The driver will keep the touts away--a real bonus! It seems all cyclos are electric assist powered now with colourful LED lights at night. More expensive than using taxi cars for short trips.

By bicycle[edit]
Nha Trang is quite flat and bicycles can be rented for typically 30,000 to 50,000 dong for one day for a basic no-gears bike if you lucky to find somewhere. Locals on bicycles are more commonly seen at night when its cooler and no sun to burn their skin. However, if you have no experience with Vietnamese traffic, you should think twice about using a bicycle as your main means of transport in Nha Trang. Electric bikes (ebikes) are a common sight in Nha Trang.

Temples[edit]
Po Nagar Cham Towers
Nha Tho Nui Cathedral
Buddha statue of Long Sơn
12.2656109.19541 Po Nagar Cham Towers, 2 Thang 4 St. 07:30-17:00. These four brick towers were built by the Cham civilization between the 7th and 12th centuries to honour Yang Ino Po Ngar, mother of the kingdom, and the aroma of incense emanating from within makes it clear that this remains a religious site for the local Buddhists of Nha Trang today. The longevity of these last vestiges of a once-dominant SE Asian civilisation should impress temple enthusiasts even if the insensitive restoration and surrounding mass of tourists don't. The small complex sits on a hill which enjoys views across Nha Trang's fishing village. It is a 20- to 25-min walk (or short motorbike ride) from the main beach strip, however be prepared to wander through the real Nha Trang, quite an abrupt change from the showy built-up beach side resort. Public Bus 4 stops near the Cham Towers. 30,000 dong. (updated Mar 2023)
12.25217109.180922 Long Son Pagoda, 23/10 street. 08:00-17:00. At this pagoda, you will see a 24-m-tall white Buddha. The pagoda was established in 1963 to honour the monks and nuns who died demonstrating against the Diem government. Beware of scammers claiming they are students studying in the temple, demanding that you offer a donation to the school before going up the pagoda. These students have no affiliation with the school and entry to the pagoda is free. Free. (updated Feb 2016)
12.2468109.1883 Nha Tho Nui Cathedral, Thái Nguyên (Taxi, Bike, Grab). On a hill overlooking the city, the cathedral shows the influence of French Catholicism. The Nha Trang area still has a strong Catholic population. There are Catholic shops around the cathedral. (updated Feb 2016)

This is like an aquarium with popular and rare species of the sea. A good place to bring kids as they will get to see sharks, turtles, coral reefs, lion fish, sea horses, and many other creatures. 40,000 dong. 
12.21845109.192097 Impressions Museum, Buu Doa - 10, ☏ +84 165 232 3028. 09:00-20:00. Not really a museum. 3D art paintings to interact with. Great for selfie addicts, but don't go alone! Ideally go as group of 3 or more. Two is OK, but it will be difficult to take photos of the two of you together. Not easy to find, it's on the other side of the old airport from the main tourist area. Receives mixed reviews, many consider it over-priced. 150,000 dong. (updated Feb 2016)
Further afield[edit]
Dien Khanh front gate
12.255598109.0952118 Diên Khánh Citadel, Diên Khánh Townlet (12 km W of city). Citadel was built by French officer Olivier de Puymanel for Nguyễn Ánh in 1793. It housed royal palace, private houses, warehouses and jail. It was fenced by walls of 3.5 m height, surrounded by moats of 4-5 m deep and 10 m wide. It was built with 6 gates, but only 4 of them remain. (updated Feb 2016)
12.167109.0549 Fairy Spring waterfalls (Suối Tiên) (about 20 km SW of Nha Trang. Go 10 km W of Nha Trang to Diên Khánh, go 5 km through the old Diên Khánh citadel to Diên Phước village, turn left 4 km to Suoi Tien village, then right 1 km to the stream). Fairy Spring is a small, cool stream and swimming hole much visited by local kids on weekends. The swimming hole is at the end of a short jungle walk. It is a pleasant place to visit in summer. In winter the water is too cold to swim. The stream's source is the area of Hồn Bà, the highest peak in the province. Bottled and canned drinks are available, but no food is sold here yet. The area is slowly being developed and will eventually become a resort with a hotel, bungalows, and restaurant. 10,000 dong per person, 3,000 dong per motorbike. 
12.382483109.132910 Ba Ho Waterfalls (near Ba Ho village, approximately 20 km N of Nha Trang). A series of three waterfalls and a fast flowing river tucked away in the forest. There are limited amenities, although you can buy food like rice, chicken, beers and soft drinks. Taxis are available in Nha Trang to take you there, but its not too difficult to find yourself and with good weather it's a pleasant drive, if you are confident on a motorbike. Its a good one hour trip from Nha Trang by motorbike through some rough, off-road tracks (especially in the wet season). The turn off from the main highway north of Nha Trang can be easy to miss (a stone pillar), but most locals along the road should be able to point it out. From the turn off it's a straight track to the river. You may want to bring some sturdy shoes to climb across the rocks and swimming gear for a dip when you get there. It will take about 45 minutes from the entrance of the tourist area to the lakes. There is an orphanage very close to the lakes (take a right turn when you get to a T-junction in the rice fields) that would really benefit from any gifts of vegetarian food (take milk, tofu, yogourt, etc.). Call Dieu An, the nun at +84 90 5823807. She speaks only Vietnamese. Entrance fee 20 000 dong. (updated Feb 2016)

Performance of the water puppet theatre
12.2393109.1961 Water Puppet Theater, ☏ +84 58 3527 828. Water puppetry is a Vietnamese original folk art that dates back as far as the 11th century when it began in the villages of the Red River Delta area of northern Vietnam.

Beaches[edit]
Nha Trang's beach
12.2472109.19683 Nha Trang Beach. The city's main beach, south of the Cai river, is about 6 km long and lined with a beautiful, well-maintained promenade containing walking paths, gardens, monuments and leisure spaces. The beach itself has a broad strip of sand, and the calm waters are extremely inviting for swimming - but care is needed, as the waters get deep very quickly. While Nha Trang's beach is hardly one of the most beautiful beaches of Southeast Asia, it can still provide one of the best urban beach experiences in the region. You will see many female vendors walking along the beach selling fruit and hot, steamed seafood. Vietnamese typically come to the beach during sunrise and sunset, with the Russians occupying the beach en masse during the peak sunshine hours. Make sure that you visit in the right season. The beach can be disappointing when the weather is grey and the waves choppy. The experience is then one of murky sandy waters, a strip of standard brown sand with a multitude of empty beach chairs and no one to be seen. 
12.2751109.20244 Bai Duong Beach (1.5 km N on Tran Phu St over the main bridge). North of the Cai river, Bai Duong beach is smaller than in the main tourist area. It is a beautiful beach, but the sewage channels make it somewhat less appealing. The beach is mostly popular among Vietnamese visitors, and hence quite empty during peak sunshine hours. Near the beach there are several seafood restaurants catering to Vietnamese tourists. It can be reached using bus #4. 
12.2729109.20655 Hon Chong (1.5 km N on Tran Phu St over the main bridge). Scenic rock formations in the sea. The disposition of the rocks, as well as the sculpture of a giant fist mark in one of them, is mysterious and a source of several folk tales. You can climb the rocks and get some nice views of Bai Doung Beach and the nearby islands. It can be reached using bus #4. Entrance 22,000 dong, including dance performance. (updated Feb 2016)
12.2111109.28096 Hòn Tre island. Has several nice beaches, but almost of all them are of exclusive access to guests of the Vinpearl resorts. The exception is the small beach in front of the Vinpearl Land's waterpark, which is accessible for those who bought a ticket to Vinpearl Land. The beach offers waterports and contains a Russian restaurant. (updated May 2019)
12.5571109.23027 Doc Let Beach (around 50 km N of Nha Trang). Located in the Ninh Hòa district north of Nha Trang, Doc Let is a beautiful, long beach with shallow, crystal-clear waters. The water has weak waves, but it is still excellent for swimming. Local fisher families sell and prepare seafood they will cook for you on the beach for a very reasonable price. The southern part of the beach contains the Ninh Hòa fishing village, where the north of the beach contains some relatively inexpensive resorts or it still underdeveloped. The best parts of the beach are the ones in front of the resorts, with the rest unfortunately with a lot of rubbish thrown by locals. You can pay a fee to rent a chair and use the showers/restrooms of White Sand Doclet resort or Paradise resort. Doc Let beach can be reached from Nha Trang using bus #3, by motorbike, and by some day tous generally aimed at Russian visitors. If you are staying in a resort there, the resort may offer you transfer services for a surcharge. 
12.109874109.1921858 Long Beach (Bai Dai beach) (on the road to Cam Ranh airport). It's in the Cam Lâm and Cam Ranh districts, 20 km south of Nha Trang. Bai Dai is in the middle of a frenetic process of development, with upscale resorts being built nonstop in the beachfront. Even so, the beach is very long and it is still possible to find yourself alone if you walk enough. It has beautiful blue waters, soft sand and it is pleasant to walk upon as it is less steep than the beach in Nha Trang, but rubbish can also be a problem in areas which are not in the front of resorts. Seafood is served at many shacks with deckchairs right on the beach. Probably best to go by motorcycle. The airport bus number 18 might be another option. Get off by road entrance leading to The Shack Vietnam. 
There are several other beaches in the vicinity of Nha Trang. About 30 km north of Nha Trang, just when past the village of Ninh Hoa, a peninsula juts out into the South China Sea, and on its northern coast is its tinier brother, Hon Khoi. Several resorts are on the eastern beach of Hon Khoi, where you find palm trees, white sand, and turquoise waters. To get there, follow the highway north past the turnoff to Dac Lac Province/Buon Ma Thuot. Then look out for a sign reading "Doc Let-Resort", close to a filling station. A taxi will take 2 people for about 200,000 dong, while a xe om should not be more expensive than 100,000 dong. Or catch a through bus travelling Hwy 1 and get off at the turn off. There will always be some motorbike drivers waiting to take you. Whatever place you choose to go, be sure to reserve a bungalow in advance.
Amusement and mud bath parks[edit]

A VIP spa package will cost you US$100 or more. If you carry on a further 500 m past the mud baths you arrive at a railway bridge across the river that connects to a tunnel. It's a very scenic spot that's popular for wedding photo shoots. US$4 mineral pool, US$12.50 mudbath. 
12.191576108.91174113 Yang Bay tourist park (40 km west of Nha Trang), ☏ +84-3739-58-387. 07:30 - 17:00. At the Yang Bay waterfalls the Vietnamese have built up a concrete beach, and sort of eco park with a zoo. It used to be a lot nicer before they built it, but it is still a very nice place to visit. You can swim there, and walk around in the area. Just to mention, tourist park receives a lot of negative reviews. adult 100 000 dong, child 70 000 dong. (updated Feb 2016)
 Hòn Tằm (Hon Tam Nha Trang), Hon Tam island - Vinh Nguyen ward (By cano every 2 hours.), ☏ +84 2586280222, contact@hontam.com.vn. 08:00 - 16:20. The only mudbath services on island in Vietnam. It takes about 6 minutes from Tam pier to the Hon Tam island by cano. The entrance fee is from 350,000 vnd (15$) for full-package service. 350000. (updated May 2022)
Diving & snorkeling[edit]
Close off-shore from Nha Trang sit a series of islands that offer decent diving and snorkelling, easily accessible by day trip. The city has about two dozen dive shops, making for fierce competition and great value. PADI open water courses with equipment rental are available for US$250. A two-dive boat trip with equipment rental and modest lunch can be had for US$45.
Coastal and undersea construction has stirred up a lot of sediment in the area, so underwater visibility is sometimes not great. The area is heavily fished, so fish life is also limited. You wouldn't cross the world just to dive at Nha Trang. But if you always dreamed of getting a scuba certification, Nha Trang is a good place to do it. The shops generally offer good quality equipment and experienced, certified dive masters. Diving goes on year round, but in the Oct-Dec windy season, the boat ride can be a bit rough and diving is limited to a few sites in the lee of the islands.
Organisation of the Nha Trang dive industry is sometimes complex. If you sign up for a trip with shop A, you might find yourself joined with a group and divemaster from shop B, which shares a boat with another group and divemaster from shop C, the boat itself being independently owned. Consolidation is especially active in the off-season, when few if any shops can fill a boat on their own. It's a good illustration of Vietnamese culture, which does not stand on ceremony, and loves a bargain, and is very skilled at making maximum use of resources. The local divemasters are mostly great, friendly guys with lots of stories to tell.

Resorts outside of town[edit]
Doc Let Beach
About 60km north of Nha Trang is a stretch of coastline about 20 km long that contains some of the best beaches in Vietnam. Soft power like white sand beaches with clear blue sea and gentle gradients, these beaches are more beautiful and easier for swimming than in Nha Trang. This is an ideal area to explore by motorbike, perhaps taking a night or two side trip from Nha Trang city. The turn off for Jungle Beach gets you off the busy highway for a more relaxing 20 km stretch of road to Jungle Beach Resort. Just after this turn off for Jungle Beach is the turn off for Doc Let Beach, which is another 13 km away and a similarly more relaxing and scenic road. There is an interconnecting road between Jungle and Doc Let so no need to go all the way back to the highway to get from one to the other.

Stay safe[edit]





Note: While quite safe during the day. At night Nha Trang is extremely rampant for theft and pick pocketing of tourists leaving the bars or just walking around late at night. Travelers should leave all valuables at their hotel room, including cell phones and cameras which are targeted the most. Unless you are willing to lose it, you shouldn't bring it out to the bars.





The risk of petty crime in Nha Trang, especially late at night, is high compared to most other places in Asia. The most common crime is pick pocketing after midnight near the Sailing Club. During the day, it is relatively safe though bag snatching on the beach is not uncommon, so don't take any valuables to the beach. Staying cautious at all times is best. Do not wear too much jewellery, and keep an eye on your belongings. It would be smart to travel in groups when you are out roaming the streets at night. Also, people coming home from the clubs should take a taxi and not a motorbike taxi. Single males walking back to their hotels in the early hours from clubs and bars such as the Sailing Club and Why Not Bar, especially if a little drunk, should beware of ladies approaching, typically in twos or threes, but often with a couple of guys on motorbikes watching closely from a distance ready to be get-away drivers or to get involved if things get nasty. They come over all friendly and touchy-feely, first checking to see what valuables you have and where, then relieve you of them. Often the victim doesn't even know he's been robbed until he gets back to his room or after he wakes up. This is almost becoming a tourist attraction in the sense you can watch this spectacle almost nightly, perhaps helping out a fellow drunken tourist being robbed. Unbelievably, no police are seen, and no hotel or bar security gets involved.
Do not keep money in your passport. If you want your hotel to lock up your money, they will usually be happy to do so in their hotel safe and have procedures for doing that. Passports are kept separate from other valuables as they need access to these for reporting each day your stay to the government. Better than giving the passport to the hotel is handing over a photocopy (personal data page and visa). It is never a good idea to give your passport to anyone other than officials. Never store money in your passport. Keep some money in a different pocket to your wallet/money belt. No point in displaying it when paying for small purchases.
Drive-by motorcycle theft is fairly common in Nha Trang. Banknotes and wallets have been snatched from tourists' hands.
If hiring a motorbike, check what coverage your insurance company gives for riding motorbikes in Asia, and it is frequently none.
Do not argue with locals who try to hustle money from you. This includes tourist touts, moto taxis, etc. They can become violent and aggressive easily, often resorting to the use of rocks or even concealed weapons. Although they can be a bit harder to get rid of than in other places, it is best to avoid these people altogether.
There was one negative report about TM Brothers buses. It's claimed, that they have a bad reputation, and some of the seats are broken and you can find cockroaches on the bus. However, their buses are usually a few dollars cheaper than other companies.
