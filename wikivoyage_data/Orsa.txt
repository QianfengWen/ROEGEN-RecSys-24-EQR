By train[edit]
Orsa is only served by Inlandsbanan, which offers daily services from Mora during the summer months as well as limited services during winter holidays. Nearest city with regular all-year traffic is Mora which has several daily direct connections from Stockholm with SJ[dead link] as well as regional passenger traffic from Borlänge and other cities in Dalarna.
Up to four bikes can be brought onto regional trains, but are not allowed of SJ intercity trains. Notice that space for bikes can not be reserved, so during high season it might be a hit-and-miss, depending on how full the train is, if you may be allowed onboard with a bike.

By bus[edit]
Orsa is connected by bus through the company Dalatrafik to regional transport. There is also a bus to and from Östersund twice a day. The central bus stop is called Orsa busstation.
On SJ[dead link] you can search combined train and Dalatrafik bus.

By car[edit]
The European route E 45 (old name: Riksväg 45) passes by Orsa. It continues south towards Mora and Gothenburg, and north towards Karesuando.

Get around[edit]
By bicycle[edit]
In Orsa proper there are only a few bike paths. Nevertheless, Orsa and its surroundings can be easily explored by bicycle. One popular bike route is the 45 km (28 mi) circuit around Orsasjö, but other destinations in Orsa are also easy to reach by bike. If you bike south towards Mora, it might be better to choose the bike path Lisselhedsvägen and not the busy E45. Local bike trips can be planned by using Siljansleden.
Dalatrafik buses can carry up to two bicycles (on a bicycle mount at the back of the buses)
