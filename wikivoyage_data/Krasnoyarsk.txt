Krasnoyarsk (Russian: Красноя́рск kruhz-nah-YAHRSK) is a city in Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russia. It is known for its beautiful nature nearby. However, the city sits in a mountainous basin and, when the wind isn't blowing, dangerous benzopyrene emissions from its aluminum smelter and power station result in black smog over the city.


Understand[edit]
Krasnoyarsk, view from a paraplane
Krasnoyarsk has a population of over 1 million people.
The Kacha River flows through the city before joining the Yenisey at the Strelka - the historical center of the city. The Krasnoyarsk hydroelectric dam, 20 km upstream, significantly influences the local climate; normally the river would freeze over in the bitterly-cold Siberian winter, but because the dam releases unfrozen water year-round, the river never freezes in the 200 km (120 mi) to 300 km (190 mi) stretch of river immediately downstream.
The city was founded in 1628 as a fort on the confluence of the two rivers. It was founded as Krasny Yar, meaning "Red Steep Bank".
Many political exiles, including 8 Decembrists, were banished to Krasnoyarsk. The city was also an administrative center for the gulags.
Krasnoyarsk grew significantly during World War II, since industrial facilities were moved eastward to escape the war. After the fall of the Soviet Union, ownership of these facilities was transferred to oligarchs, and unemployment rose significantly.
The economy of the city is dependent upon its aluminum production facilities.
The famous 2005 Russian war film The 9th Company, directed by Fedor Bondarchuk and set during the Soviet War in Afghanistan, reputedly a favorite of president Vladimir Putin, has its story beginning at Krasnoyarsk.

By public transport[edit]
There are many public buses, costing 26 руб per trip. You may use the 2GIS app in order to know which bus to take, or simply ask a local. In large buses, the conductor walks among the passengers and asks for money from the new passengers. In a minibus, the conductor sits near the driver and gets paid before passengers exit (because of this the rear door is rarely opened).

After Novosibirsk and Tomsk, Krasnoyarsk is the most prominent scientific and educational center of Siberia with more than 30 higher education facilities, many of which are the branches of the Russian Academy of Science, and about 200 high schools. The most notable higher education institutes are:

Siberian Federal University (Russian abbreviation is SibFU), founded on November 4, 2006. The institution integrated four large higher education institutions (Krasnoyarsk State University, Krasnoyarsk State Academy of Architecture and Civil Construction, Krasnoyarsk State Technical University, State University of Non-Ferrous Metals and Gold)
Krasnoyarsk State University of Education (Russian abbreviation is KGPU), founded in 1932
Siberian State Technological University (Russian abbreviation is SibGTU), the oldest in the city, founded in 1930 as the Siberian Institute of the Forest
Siberian State Aerospace University (Russian abbreviation is SibGAU), founded in 1960
Krasnoyarsk State Medical Academy (Russian abbreviation is KrasGMA), founded in 1942
Similarly to Novosibirsk and Tomsk, Krasnoyarsk has a special city district called Akademgorodok (Academic Town in Russian) where many of the institutes are located. There, in the Institute of Biophysics, the experiment on ecological isolation of human beings called "Bios", similar to the US experiment Biosphere 2, has been successfully held in 1973-1985.

Work[edit]
Like any industrial center, Krasnoyarsk has a large number of employment opportunities. However, salaries are low (up to 500 USD/month is 'good', more than  USD1000/month is 'very good'; higher salaries are available for top-managers or business owners only). Salaries net of taxes.

Buy[edit]
If you want to buy Siberian souvenirs or paintings of the Krasnoyarsk artists you can visit the Diana (Диана) art salon at Mira St. (ул. Мира) 51. You may try to speak English with merchants here. Another place to look for paintings of the local artists is the Khingan (Хинган) galleries at Mira St. (ул. Мира) 3, Vzlyotnaya St. (ул. Взлётная) 2 and Totmina St. (ул. Тотмина) 6. Siberian souvenirs are also sold in the Sibir-Etno (Сибирь-этно) galleries, the first of them is in the Krasnoyarsk railway station, the second is at Aviatorov St. (ул. Авиаторов) 19.
The one unique thing you're advised to buy is cedar nuts, because the Siberian region is the only region where the authentic variety of this delicacy can be purchased. Throughout the rest of the world cedar nuts are extremely expensive.
Other goods are the same as all over Russia. Chinese clothes could be slightly cheaper on the Chinese market.

Entertainment centers and shopping malls[edit]
Krasnoyarsk has a lot of huge trade-and-entertainment centers, similar to shopping malls, where you can find cinema theaters, restaurants, cafeterias and numerous large and small shops. The major centers are: Torgovyy Kvartal (Торговый Квартал, Russian for Trade Block) at Televizornaya Str. 1, Planeta (Планета, Russian for Planet) at Dyevyatogo Maya Str. 77 and Luch (Луч, Russian for Ray) at Karla Marksa Str. 149. Other large trading centers are Kvant (Квант, Russian for Quant) at Krasnoy Armii Str. 10, Yevraziya (Евразия, Russian for Eurasia) at Karla Marksa Str. 95-1 and Krasnoyarye (Красноярье, Russian for Places of Krasnoyarsk) at Krasnoyarskiy Rabochiy Str. 120.

Stay safe[edit]
Though generally safe for the experienced traveler, Krasnoyarsk can be a tricky destination for someone not familiar with the region and culture. The downtown areas are pretty much safe all night, but in the suburbs don't walk alone after dark. If you are 15–30 years old, the neighborhood of student dormitories (living blocks without balconies, usually 9-story), the inside of living districts and street cafes can be dangerous for you even at the day time due to the chances to meet drunk bullies who can be easily provoked, for example, by your unusual or not athletic look. Other places of higher risk are large market places and the railway station: be sure to keep your cash out of view and out of pickpockets' reach.
Avoid asking the police for help unless it is really necessary. If possible, communicate with the hotel staff and security first, because communication with local policemen may be unpleasant due to both the language barrier and their usual rudeness, or even dangerous, especially for non-European-looking foreigners (although police in Krasnoyarsk is far from being as dangerous as in Moscow and Saint Petersburg). Sadly, this is a national problem in Russia: there is not much difference between police and criminals.

Go next[edit]
The easiest way to travel from the city is to fly to Moscow first, and then to wherever necessary. However, there are some flights from the local airport Emelianovo to China and the nearest ex-USSR countries, or through Novosibirsk and Irkutsk which can be easily reached by train.
The neighboring region of Khakassia with its major city Abakan is 400 km South, reachable by car (M-54 road) and everyday train from the railway station.
The next stops of note on the Trans-Siberian Railway are Achinsk to the west towards Novosibirsk and Kansk to the east towards Irkutsk
During the summer there are 1-2 week cruises to the Northern part of the Krasnoyarsk Krai to the mouth of the Yenisey. Everyday connections exist only for the city of Divnogorsk, located 40 km west, near the Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Power Station.
