Caherciveen (with several spellings) is a village on the Iveragh Peninsula in County Kerry in southwest Ireland. It has a population (as of 2016) of 1041, but it's on the popular Ring of Kerry tourist circuit and gets very busy in summer. Cathair Saidhbhín in Irish means "Little Sadhbh's stone ringfort" and there are two well-restored ringforts just across the river.

See[edit]
Monuments at Carhan Bridge as you enter the village on N70 commemmorate St Brendan the Navigator and the birthplace of Daniel O'Connell.
 Daniel O'Connell Church, Church Street. O'Connell (1775-1847) "The Great Liberator" was born at Carhan and grew up at Derrynane House. In 1791 he joined the Jesuit college at Douai, but fled from revolutionary violence back to Britain. It gave him a lifelong determination to overturn the repression of Ireland and especially of its Catholics solely by legal and constitutional means. The church, built 1888-1902 of granite from County Down, is a mix of neo-gothic and cod-medieval, and still in use as the parish church. The marble foundation stone was a gift from Pope Leo XIII, sourced from the catacombs in Rome. (updated May 2021)
Old Abbey of the Holy Cross is a ruin 100 m west of the church. O'Connell's parents are buried in the graveyard of the former church, a humble affair since it dates from the Penal era which curbed RC worship.
 The Old Barracks, Bridge St. Daily. "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair - Jaysuz it's the cops!" This police barracks was built in schloss or baronial style in 1870-75: the authorities were anxious about Fenian attacks on the new transatlantic telegraph cable, which came ashore at Valentia Island. It was torched in 1922 during the Irish civil war but rebuilt from 1992 and refurbished in 2013. It's now a heritage centre with museum exhibitions on Daniel O'Connell, local history and the Royal Irish Constabulary. (updated May 2021)
51.949-10.2591 Ballycarbery Castle, Ballycarberry East. Closed. Dilapidated remains of a 16th century castle, blasted by Cromwell in 1652. The masonry was recycled into a house, but this was demolished in the 20th century. Until 2017 you could walk around it, but the landowner then blocked public access, mindful no doubt of the legal repercussions if someone stubbed their toe. So you can admire it from the car park 200 m away, from where it looks more like prize topiary than a castle.  (updated May 2021)
Cahergall north of Ballycarbery is a stone ringfort from the 7th century, with 25 m internal diameter.
Leacanabuaile another 400 m north is similar but 9th century, more fully restored and with 30 m internal diameter. Findings on site indicate that both structures were more like fortified farmsteads than warrior castles. They're free to access 24 hours.
The old police barracks
Whitestrand is the fine beach southwest of the ringforts. Church Island 200 m off the point has the remains of a monastic settlement.
51.933-10.32 Beginish Island further west has no permanent inhabitants but has holiday homes. There's the remains of a Viking settlement.
51.955-10.3053 Killelan is the 275 m hill on the peninsula that ends at Doulus Head. The usual hike is a circuit rather than an ascent.
51.993-10.1754 Knocknadobar (Cnoc na dTobar, "hill of the wells") is the top of the coastal ridge northeast of the village. It's a place of pilgrimage, where the copious rainfall emerges from the mountain in a series of springs and holy wells. At 690 m / 2260 ft and rising prominently from the coast it's a "Marilyn". The hiking route and pilgrimage trail is from St Fursey's Holy Well on the lane to Coonanna, ascending east past "Stations of the Cross" markers; 9 km there and back.

Hikes: see Knocknadobar and Killelan above. A trail also ascends Bentee, the 376 m hill overlooking the village.
Ring of Kerry is the 214 km tourist itinerary around the Iveragh Peninsula. Tour buses always go anti-clockwise: if you start from Killarney as most of them do, it's probably best to buck the trend and go clockwise. But if you start from Caherciveen, tour anti-clockwise as you've a few hours start on them.
The Wild Atlantic Way is a driving itinerary from Donegal all the way down the west coast to Kinsale in County Cork. On this section it's identical to the Ring of Kerry.
Cahersiveen Festival[dead link] is held just before the August Bank Holiday: that's the first Monday in August with the Festival on the preceding Friday-Sunday. So the next is probably 29 - 31 July 2022, tbc.
