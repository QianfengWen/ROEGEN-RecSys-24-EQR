Utö is also an island in the Stockholm archipelago in Sweden, and one in Finby, Salo.
Utö is an island far out in the Archipelago Sea, with its lighthouse welcoming ships arriving to south-western Finland from the Baltic Sea. It lacks wood or farmland, the village ducking into the little shelter given by the rocks. The permanent population is a few dozen people.


Understand[edit]

Utö is the southernmost inhabited island in Finland, 80 km (50 mi) from the mainland, by the main fairway from the Baltic Sea to Turku and Naantali. As such it was important early on, with maritime pilots inhabiting the island since the 18th century and the first lighthouse built in 1753. The current lighthouse was built in 1814 and its current outfit is from 1935. The island was shared between the four pilot families. 
The island was first mentioned in a letter by king Gustav Vasa in 1550 saying that there is a stone cairn on the island. A Dutch nautical guide from 1592 knows that the island called Wttoy has a mast with a barrel and one must circumnavigate the island from west. A pilot station was established in 1697.
The island got heavy coastal artillery during World War I. The garrison was turned into a hotel in 2005. The island had long been a popular destination, but this made the island much more accessible. Even though the military personnel left the island, there are still some equipment and the cannons are ready to use.
Due to the pilot station, lighthouse and military there is some infrastructure on the island, such as a small primary school and a library, making the island ideal for people wishing to stay or live far from everything. There are a few dozens year-round inhabitants but many more people in summertime.
The island belonged to the municipality of Korpo, which now has merged with the rest of the south-western archipelago.
As an island far out it has been involved in several tragic accidents, notably the shipwreck of Draken av Nystad in 1929, the loss of coastal defence ship Ilmarinen, which was sunk by a mine in World War II, the shipwreck of the US freighter m/s Park Victory on nearby rocks in 1947 and the sinking of cruise ferry m/s Estonia in the open sea in 1994.
The climate is relatively mild because of the sea, but wind and moisture make the temperature feel colder.
Like on many of the islands in the Archipelago Sea, the population is traditionally Swedish-speaking; to the extent that the island does not even have a Finnish name. Of those moving here, though, many are Finnish.
