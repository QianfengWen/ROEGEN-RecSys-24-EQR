Go next[edit]
Chur - Chur is 30 minutes away from Lenzerheide by bus. The old part of Chur is very nice to walk through and to go shopping. There are a lot of places to go out in the evening, from restaurants to bars. There is also the cable car Brambrüesch, which takes you up the mountain. From there, you can go hiking, biking or skiing.
Churwalden - This village lies halfway between Lenzerheide and Chur. Churwalden has the longest toboggan run of the world and the highest rope park of Switzerland. In winter, Churwalden has a practice lift for beginners as well as two chairlifts for more advanced skiers.
Malix - Malix is very special because it is built on a slope on one side of the valley. It is very nice for walking and if you plan a longer walk, you can go up the Brambrüesch, eat in the restaurant and then take the cable car down to Chur. Malix also has a small castle, which now is a renovated ruin.
Parpan - A quiet little village with walking trails through beautiful scenery. 7 minutes away from Lenzerheide by bus. In summer, there is the Sunday market where you can find antique accessories. You can also watch how cheese or the traditional dried meat is made. In winter, you can go skiing; there are 36 ski lifts which are connected throughout the whole valley. In the winter, the walking trails turn into cross-country skiing tracks.
Valbella - The neighbour village is next to the Heidsee, so a short walk away from Lenzerheide itself. You can go swimming in the lake or just walk around it and have a picnic.
