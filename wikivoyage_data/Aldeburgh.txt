Aldeburgh (pronounced /ˈɔ:lbrə/ (ALL-bre)) is a coastal town in east Suffolk, England. It has a long pebble beach, fresh seafood, several curious landmarks and an interesting history of survival against being swept away by the North Sea.


Understand[edit]
Aldeburgh
The town is best known for being the home of composer Benjamin Britten, who was founder of the annual Aldeburgh Festival in 1948. A lot of properties in the town are second homes. Many visit for the Blue Flag shingle beach.

52.1821.611 House in the Clouds is a fantastical 1910 creation. The neighbourhood was being made over into an "olde worlde" holiday village, but it needed modern amenities like running water, and a couple of ugly towers and tanks to boost the water pressure. One became a standard stone tower, but the other was disguised as a house perched atop an apartment block. The water tank was removed in 1979 and the entire tower has been converted into accommodation, sleeps 10+1. Lots of stairs, no lift.

Martello Tower
52.13751.59789 Martello Tower, Slaughden Rd IP15 5NA. The unique Martello Tower (knows as tower CC) is 4 towers joined together and the largest and northernmost of 103 defensive towers built between 1808 and 1812 to resist a Napoleonic invasion. Suffolk at one time had 18 towers. Many have been destroyed (e.g. pulled down for their masonry) whilst others converted into homes or put to other uses. This tower is now used as holiday apartments. The Martello Tower is the only surviving building of the fishing village of Slaughden, which had been washed away by the North Sea by 1936. 
Do[edit]
Walk through and around the marshes along River Alde near the marina and Martello tower.
See the site and read the plaques describing the history of the nearby fishing village of Slaughden, which was washed away by the North Sea by 1936. Near the Martello Tower at Slaughden Quay are the barely visible remains of the fishing smack Ionia. It had become stuck in the treacherous mud of the River Alde, and was then used as a houseboat. In 1974 it was burnt, as it had become too unsafe.
