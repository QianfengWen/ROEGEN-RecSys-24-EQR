Connect[edit]
By phone[edit]
Most telephone numbers in Glasgow consist of +1 270 plus a seven-digit number, but the city and its surrounding region are now served by an overlay complex of two area codes, with +1 364 being the second. A local or in-state telephone call now requires all 10 digits of the local number be dialed (omitting just the leading +1 from a local landline call).
Signage on many established businesses may still display the original seven-digit numbers; dial 270 before these if no area code is indicated.
