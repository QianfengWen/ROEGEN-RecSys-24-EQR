Understand[edit]

Kandahār or Qandahār (Pashto: کندهار; Persian: قندهار) is one of the largest of Afghanistan's thirty-four provinces and is located in the southern region of the country. The province connects with Pakistan's Balochistan province through the Spin Boldak-Chaman border crossing. The city of Kandahar was the capital of Afghanistan prior to 1776. It is an economic and political hub of Afghanistan and has always played a major role in the nation's history.

Pashtuns are multilingual. They make up the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan.

Kandahar's residents are Pashtuns (Pashto: پښتون Paṣ̌tun, Pax̌tun) of various tribes, with small communities of Tajiks, Turkmens, Uzbeks, Hazaras, Baloch and others scattered in and around the city. They have lived in harmony each other throughout history. The people of Kandahar enjoy humor and laughter, and they often talk about sports, history and geopolitics. Many influential Afghan rulers, such as Mirwais Khan Hotak, Ahmad Shah Durrani, Abdur Rahman Khan, Amanullah Khan, and Hamid Karzai, originate from Kandahar. The city has also produced a number of prominent Afghan poets, singers, scholars, intellectuals, academics and businessmen.
Kandahār is located at about 1,005 m (3,297 feet) above sea level. The Arghandab and Tarnak rivers run along the city. These major rivers turn into numerous smaller rivers, lakes, ponds, creeks, streams and canals in and around the city. They create lush green gardens and enhance the natural beauty of the city.
Kandahar province has a population of around 2 million people, with over one million residing in its capital city. The majority of Kandahār people are engaged in agriculture, import and export, real estate, small businesses, and government services. Kandahār is a major exporting center of fresh and dried fruits. It has a small but growing industrial park.
Like other Afghan cities, Kandahār is slowly developing. It has a very large international airport. The city is linked by main roads to nearby cities such as Tareen Kot in the north, Ghazni in the northeast, Quetta in Pakistan in the south, and Lashkar Gah in the west.

The A01 highway links Kandahar with Kabul. It is one of the busiest in Afghanistan. The highways in Afghanistan are sometimes dangerous due to militant activities but the militants do not necessarily target tourists. Total drive between Kandahar and Kabul is approximately 6 hours. The highway from Kandahar to Herat is sometimes dangerous, especially where it passes in Helmand and Farah provinces. Highway A75 runs southeast towards Spin Boldak, which is the last town in Afghanistan before the start of a Pakistani highway.

By bus[edit]
There is a large national bus station called "Kabul Adda" (meaning Kabul Junction) and is located a block north of Durahi Circle in the affluent Aino Mina section of the city. The buses take passengers to Kabul, Lashkar Gah, Zaranj, Herat, and Spin Boldak. Smaller vehicles are also available at this station to take passengers to other destinations within the province and beyond.

Get around[edit]
To get around the city visitors can use taxis or rent a vehicle, which usually comes with a reliable driver but special arrangements can be made to exclude the driver. The basic requirement for such special rental is insurance for the vehicle.

Stay safe[edit]
See the warning on the Afghanistan article for information on the security situation.
Kandahar has been one of the safer cities in southern Afghanistan, especially its Aino Mina section located in the east and closer to the main airport. The most advanced hospital is in Aino Mina, which opened in April 2019. Blending with the locals is a good way to prevent unnecessary attention. Residents of Kandahar are friendly and hospitable, but some of those from other places who are staying in the city may not be. Kandahar residents treat foreign tourists as special diplomats. Many residents of Kandahar also have family and friends who are citizens of countries in Europe, Oceania and North America.
