By public transport[edit]
From the central bus station (rutebilstation) there are buses run to Dybbøl, Kær, Stenbjergparken, Kløvermarken, Skovparken, Sønderborg Sygehus (Hospital) twice at every hour. One way ticket is 17 kr and payable onboard, only cash. There is also 10 clip card for 120 kr, if you plan to travel more frequent. Because it is a small town, buses take off twice an hour (mostly).

Sønderborg is a very bike friendly city. Almost all roads have separated bike lanes. Hop up on your bike or buy a second hand one and do not suffer in the buses.
