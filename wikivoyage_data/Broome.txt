Not to be confused with Broome County in New York.

Broome is the largest town in the  Kimberley region of Western Australia, with 14,660 residents in 2021. Established through the pearling industry of the late 19th century, it became a beach resort in the 1980s. 


Understand[edit]
The Yawuru (pronounced Ya-roo) Aboriginal people of this area lived by the coast and fished in the sea and creeks, naming their seasons for the changing catch patterns. Only in 1988 was the first dictionary of their language compiled, and a grammar in 2011. Europeans probed the coast from the 17th century but saw no reason to linger, with the lack of natural harbours, and long distance from their existing settlements. But in the 19th century they realised the fortune to be made here from pearls, and the place the Yawuru called Rubibi became Broome, named for Sir Frederick Napier Broome (1842-96) the 1880s governor of Western Australia. 
The modern pearl industry started in Shark Bay and soon spread around Australia's north coast. Aboriginals had long gathered pearls from oysters within wading depth, but demand from a growing western prosperous middle-class soon exhausted those, and fishermen and women were forced into deeper water using breath-holding or primitive air hoses. Then deeper still using pumped air, suffering high mortality from little-understood diving diseases. Bluntly these people were expendable, and replaced by equally expendable Japanese and Malay fishers recruited by "blackbirding" - kidnapping into slavery. Hundreds now lie in Broome's cemeteries. 
Pearls were not just for jewellery, they had practical value as buttons, until the 1950s when polyester buttons replaced them. However pearl farming then developed, so they could be produced inexpensively without the human toll, and this industry continues. Broome morphed into a tourist resort from the 1980s, when Lord Alistair McAlpine invested in the town and built Cable Beach Club Resort. 
In a straight flying line, Broome is 1680 km from Perth, twice as far as from Denpasar in Bali - it suffered Japanese air raids in World War 2, the most deadly on 3 March 1942. At about 18°S it's on the edge of the tropical cyclone belt, with a hot (30-40°C) wet season December to April. Occasional cyclones make landfall, travel is unpleasant on sealed roads and impractical on dirt tracks, and many businesses close. The tourist season is May to October when almost no rain falls and the temperature is 25°C.

By boat[edit]
Broome is on the cruise circuit, with passengers tendered in to Gantheaume Point (see below).
With your own boat, this is an awkward yet essential port, as there is nowhere else for fuel and supplies for a very long way. There's no marina and you use the commercial jetty at Gantheaume Point, 7 km from downtown. The moorings here are all booked out so you anchor in less-than-firm sand, and pick high tide to avoid lugging stuff way across the sands.

Get around[edit]
Broome is spread out: from downtown on Roebuck Bay to Cable Beach is 7 km. You could do it on foot in an hour, but it's damned hot, and you won't be much use for anything once you get there.
Broome Explorer Bus shuttles between downtown, Chinatown, Courthouse (for airport) and Cable Beach, a 20 minute run. May to mid-Oct it runs daily 7:30AM to 6:30PM every 30 min, mid-Oct to April it's daily 9AM to 6PM hourly but with an 11AM start on Sunday.
There are half a dozen national car hire companies at the airport, and several downtown hiring campers. 
Cycling around town is easy, main roads have cycleways, but there's no shade.

Rides cost more at sunset
Cable Beach is what Broome is famous for, a 22 km stretch of white sand on the west coast facing the Indian Ocean. The waves are usually gentle May-Oct so it's suitable for kiddy-bathing, and has a bus service. The name is because the telegraph cable to Java was laid from here in 1889. Java was already connected to mainland Asia, Europe, Britain and North America, so this filled the missing link, a cable that winched Australia closer to the rest of world.

Town Beach is the small east-facing sandy beach a block from the museum, sheltered by the breakwater of Croc Jetty.
Staircase to the moon is an optical effect where the rising full moon coincides with low tide, so its beams reflect in water trapped in the beach ripples. It can be seen during the unclouded dry season from any sandy beach with an unobstructed view to the east horizon: in Broome the favourite viewing spot is Town Beach. The visitor centre posts viewing dates and moonrise times.
Flying-boat wrecks can be seen and reached at very low tide beyond Croc Jetty. Shot up during the Japanese air raid, they'd been evacuating civilians from Java, and sixty people still aboard were killed. Another ten aircraft lie in deeper water. Wear stout footwear, there are plenty of sharp or stinging things in the mudflats.
-17.9589122.23883 SSJG Heritage Centre, 9 Barker St, ☏ +61 428 692993. Feb-Nov M-F 9AM-noon.

The "dinosaur prints" signposted are concrete replicas, the real ones are beyond the jetty and only uncovered at the lowest tides. These were made by three-toed therapods 130 million years ago. Wear sturdy shoes for the sharp rocks.

Reddell Beach is the southwest-facing sandy beach between Gantheaume Point and Kabbarli Lookout. It's 10 km from town so it's very quiet.
-18.0077122.20916 Kabbarli Lookout is at the tip of the peninsula, with more scenic red rocks.

Camel rides: Dromedaries - one humped camels - were imported in large numbers in the mid 19th century to serve as heavy haulage in the outback, with great paniers dangling at their sides. They remained in use until the 1920s when they and their handlers were made redundant by motor trucks. Many camels were turned loose and went feral, breeding and eating busily, till they became a pest in spite of culls. The camels on Cable Beach plod sedately up and down: sunset is a popular (and more expensive) time to ride them. Operators are Broome Camel Safaris, Red Sun Camels and Cable Beach Camels.
