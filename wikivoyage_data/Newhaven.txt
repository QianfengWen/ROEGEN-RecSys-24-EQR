Newhaven is a small coastal town in East Sussex. The main landmark in the town is the Newhaven Fort.  The parish includes part of the Brighton to Newhaven Cliffs Site of Special Scientific Interest. The cliffs are mainly of geological interest, containing many Santonian and Campanian fossils. The open land surrounding Newhaven to the west, north and east is part of the South Downs National Park.


Understand[edit]
Newhaven lies at the mouth of the River Ouse, in the valley the river has cut through the South Downs. Over the centuries the river has migrated between Newhaven and Seaford in response to the growth and decay of a shingle spit (shoal) at its mouth.

Get in[edit]
Map showing trains and roads into Newhaven.
By train[edit]
There are two train stations in Newhaven; 50.7950.0551 Newhaven Town and 50.790.0552 Newhaven Harbour. Counterintuitively, you should get off at the Newhaven Town station for the port - not Newhaven Harbour. There is only about a two-minute journey between the two stations and they're both on the same line, so there's no problem if you miss the station you were meant to get off at. You can get to Newhaven easily with direct trains from Lewes and Brighton. You can also, with changes, get there from Eastbourne via Lewes, Gatwick Airport via Brighton, Portsmouth and Southsea station via Brighton and London Victoria via Lewes as well.

By boat[edit]

If you are in Europe, you can take a ferry from Dieppe to Newhaven. The journey's about four hours, but there is a great restaurant on the ship serving cooked food with a nice, sea view. The price of one adult travelling with a small car is about £50-£70 one way, and travelling just on foot is about £30 one way.

Newhaven Port[edit]
50.789610.054371 Newhaven Port, ☏ +44 844 576 8836, +44 1235 845138, toll-free: +44 800 917 1201, mail@newhavenferryport.co.uk.   
The port was built in the mid-19th century and has a passenger terminal. There is also a car park at the terminal, which costs £4.50 per 24 hour period (however, this can only be paid for at the terminal and can't be pre-booked). More car parks are available in the town, most on the other side of the river though (see below). There isn't anything else really at the terminal, so long waits there won't be fun. If you want to buy anything like a newspaper or magazine, the Sainsbury's just along the A259 to the east about 10 minutes walk away will be the best option.

By car[edit]
From Brighton, take the A259 east to Newhaven and from Eastbourne, take the A259 west to Newhaven. From Lewes, take the A26 south, then the A27 east briefly, before taking the A26 southbound again. From Gatwick Airport (and Crawley), take the M23 southbound, then the A23 southbound. Just before you reach Brighton, take the A27 east, then take the A26 southbound from near Lewes.
