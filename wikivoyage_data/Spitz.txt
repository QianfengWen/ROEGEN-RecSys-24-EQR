Ruine Hinterhaus
Spitz is a small town in the Wachau, on the river Danube. Together with the neighbouring villages of Gut am Steg, Schwallenbach, and Vießling it is a major wine-producing centre of the region.


Understand[edit]
Named after the Knights of Spitz, who maintained the castle looming over the town, evidence of human settlement here dates back 4000 years. From 812 to 1504 CE it was owned by the Niederaltaich Abbey, and was a Bavarian enclave within Austria. Today its primary economic activity is wine production and tourism.
