Santa Ana is the second largest city of El Salvador and a very important one in terms of agriculture and coffee production (coffee plantations - called fincas - cover much of the land outside town and up the hills). Its historic center offers some of the best preserved architecture in El Salvador, including the Cathedral of Santa Ana, a marvel of neo-gothic architecture, the Teatro de Santa Ana, a beautifully decorated theatre of the early 1900s; and the Palacio Municipal in front of the main plaza with giant palm trees shooting out from its courtyard.


Get in[edit]
Santa Ana lies 64 km northwest of the capital San Salvador, just off the Panamerica (Highway 1), from where several exits lead into town. Being close to the border, it's also a convinient stop if coming from Guatemala.

By bus[edit]
from Guatemala City's 14.61487-90.521481 international terminal (aka Pezzarossi) at 3 Ave y 1 Calle in Zona 9 (one block south of the infamous Zona 4 terminal), buses leave at 05:30, 07:30, 09:30, 11:30, 13:30, and 15:30 towards San Salvador, passing through Santa Ana after 4-4½ hr, US$16/120 Quetzales (same fare as for San Salvador), Tel +502 2331 0874.Some buses go via the San Cristobal border where immigration procedures are straightforward and hassle-free, while others use the busy border at Valle Nuevo (aka Las Chinamas on the salvadorian side) where aggressive money changers await you. Be very careful here and don't hand out the immigration's paper slip to anyone. First stop is Guatemalan immigration where you get an exit stamp and a paper slip. After crossing the bridge over the Rio Paz you don't need to visit the Salvadorian immigration (the officer boards the bus to check your documents), and no entry stamp is provided as your still in the CA-4 area. When arriving Santa Ana, the only stop will be at the office's new location at 13.97335-89.585742 La Ceiba. Take a taxi or local bus into downtown (Route R-A will drop you just behind the Teatro).Buses of the following companies pass by on their way from Guatemala City to San Salvador, but do not enter Santa Ana and might drop you at the intersection of Highway 1 (Panamericana) and Highway 12 a few kilometres south (locally known as La Ceiba). Catch a taxi for US$5 or one of the frequent urbanos (local bus) for $0.20-0.25 into town.

Transportation from the international airport at Comalapa SAL IATA [2][dead link] w:El_Salvador_International_Airport costs at least $65 for a minibus (no matter how many persons), 2 hr, organize the day before your flight (ask at your hotel).The small airstrip known as Pista Singuil about 18 km northwest of town (right off Panamericana Highway 1) is closed and now used for car racing.
By train[edit]
All train services were suspended in 1990, but parts of the station (a wooden shack) still exist 17a Ave Sur at the end of 7a Calle Oriente. Be careful here as locals consider this part of town as unsafe. Railway enthusiasts might check the web sites [3][dead link] and [4][dead link]

Get around[edit]
13°59′24″N 89°33′36″WMap of Santa Ana (El Salvador)
Most places within the historic center can be reached within a few minutes walk, there's no need to take a taxi or board local buses. The Tourist Office outside the 13.99481-89.557313 Palacio Municipal (just across from the Theater) has city maps and other information.
Most touristic sights are located at the center of town around the 13.99471-89.556674 Parque Libertad. 4 blocks west of it is 13.99553-89.560645 Parque Menendez, and again roughly 6 blocks further south 13.99047-89.563296 Parque Colon.
From central Parque Libertad Avenida Independencia runs north-south, while Calle Libertad runs east-west. Calles (streets) north of Libertad have even numbers (2-4-6), while Calles south of Libertad have odd numbers (1-3-5). So don't be confused! Avenidas west of Independencia have even numbers (2-4-6), the ones east of Independencia have odd numbers (1-3-5).





What's in an address?
25a Calle Poniente Entre 10a y 12a Ave Sur #6 translates into 25th Street West (of Ave Independencia) between 10th and 12th Avenue South (of Libertad Avenue) House Number 6. (Short version 25C Pte Ere 10 y 12Av Sur #6)


When asking for directions remember that house numbers are often out of sequence and might repeat in other blocks. Similar, street numbers are not well established (although well signed), and locals - including taxi and bus driver - usually navigate by these landmarks:

 Parque (Central Park). Parque Libertad. 
 Centro (Downtown area). Buses are not allowed to pass Parque Libertad and usually drop passengers 1 or 2 blocks from the Parque. 
13.97722-89.561827 Metrocentro. Shopping mall (roundabout) at south entrance of town. Often shorten to Metro to avoid confusion with Centro (Downtown). 
13.98771-89.563398 Terminal. Bus station south of Mercado Colon. Local buses stop at the roundabout at Ave Fray Felipe Moraga y 15a Calle Poniente. 
13.99211-89.55739 Pollo Campero. Fast food restaurant at Ave Independencia y 5a Calle, 3 blocks south of Parque Libertad. 
13.992-89.5512610 Hospital (Public hospital). Calle Libertad Oriente y 17a Ave Sur. 
13.97615-89.567111 ISSS (Regional hospital). Ave Santa Ana California Sur, next to the stadium.

 DUI (Center issuing the Documento Único de Identidad). 25a Calle Poniente Entre 18a Ave Sur y Calle Internacional. 
By bus[edit]
Local buses (called Urbanos) serve almost every part of Santa Ana and its colonias and operate roughly between 05:00 and 21:00. They can be very crowded especially during rush hour. Routes are complicated, difficulte to follow, and no route map is published. Flat fare is $0.20 for the bigger buses, $0.25 for micro buses, and $0.35 for a/c buses on selected routes; board in front and pay the driver. Some useful lines are:

 R-8. Metrocentro to downtown, via Bulevar Los 44 (commonly known as bypass), Universidad Catolica, then along 7a Calle and 5a Calle Oriente (get off at Pollo Campero and walk 3 blocks to Parque Libertad). 
 R-9. Metrocentro to downtown, follows Ave Independencia (get off at Pollo Campero and then walk 3 blocks to Parque Libertad). 
 51-E. Downtown (Scotiabank behind the Palacio Municipal) via INSA to UES (Universidad de El Salvador). In opposite direction 51-E goes from UES via INSA to Parque Colon. 
 51-F. Downtown (Scotiabank behind the Palacio Municipal) via INSA to Metrocentro. Don't take 51-F back to downtown unless you're ready for a 45-min ride or want to go to Parque Colon (but if you do, ask the driver if he's going via IVU as two different 51-F routes exist!) 
By taxi[edit]
Unmetered yellow taxis charge $3 for short distances, but $4 (bargain hard) should bring you pretty much everywhere in town. Most drivers have difficultes to find specific streets, better use hotel names, landmarks (see above), or the name of the Colonia (town district) of your destination.

See[edit]
Most visitors of course come to see the Cathedral and the Theatre, but Santa Ana has more to offer. According to La Secretaria de Cultura, its historic center (roughly within the limits of 4a Calle, 7a Ave, 9a Calle, Ave Jose Matias Delgado) counts 210 buildings in neoclassical style, 5 Gothic, 64 neocolonial and 102 in traditional style. The most intact ensemble of colonial houses can be found east of Parque Libertad, although most houses are privately owned and therefore inaccessible.

Santa Ana has a classical colonial town layout with 4 churches forming the Christian cross:

13.99492-89.555937 Catedral de Santa Ana (at Parque Libertad). Build in gothic style 1906 and with its splendid facade now completely restored (almost, the lower parts are still crumbling), this is one of the most impressive cathedrals in Central America. Don't miss it! 
13.99564-89.561248 Iglesia El Calvario (at Parque Menendez). This church was badly damaged during the 2001 earthquake but is now completely restored. 
13.99103-89.556979 Iglesia Catolica El Carmen, 7a Calle Oriente y 1a Ave Sur (4 blocks south of Parque Libertad).

Do[edit]
Santa Ana makes an excellent base for discovering western El Salvador's archaeological and natural spots. FUNDAR (Fundación Nacional de Arqueología de El Salvador) maintains the excellent and highly recommended website [5][dead link] with tons of information, although its participation ended in 2009.

Tazumal Maya pyramid in the town of Chalchuapa
13.9797-89.674291 Tazumal (Parque Arqueológico [6]), 15 km west of Santa Ana (take bus 218 passing along 31a Calle Poniente, 4a Ave Sur, 11a Calle Poniente, Ave Fray Felipe Sur, to Chalchuapa town.

13.8494-89.6297 Santa Ana Volcano (next to Cerro Verde). Is noteworthy for the turquoise lake in its crater. A guided and police escorted tour (they don't let you do the hike without a guide) leaves Cerro Verde at 11am to the vulcano. The hike up takes 2 hr and 1.5 hr down, and is moderately difficult. Trekking boots recommended. The weather is chilly at the high altitude (2381m, 7812ft) so long pants, a jacket, and a windbreaker are also recommended. Bring at least 1 liter of drinking water with you! Best time for climbing is during dry season (between Nov and April) when perfect sky is the rule, but even in rain season (between May and October) good weather is not uncommon.

 Ruta de las Flores. A beautyful route across the mountains south of Santa Ana, with several lakes and waterfalls along the road. To get there, take bus 210 (very frequently) from terminal to 13.9246-89.84341 Ahuachapan, $0.50 1h.

All towns offer plenty of accommodation.The Rutas de las Flores can be done as a day trip (although you might miss a lot of its beauty), but it's best to travel the opposite way around: Take bus 238 from terminal to Juayua at 06:40, 09:40, 12:30, and 17:00, $0.80. In Juayua change to bus 249 (ask driver to make sure you're on the right bus!) towards Apaneca, Concepción de Ataco, and finally Ahuachapan. In Ahuachapan you can transfer to the 210 bus back to Santa Ana. As always, times are approximate. It is better to arrive 15min early and safe your seat.

While not part of the Ruta de las Flores per se, this tiny village located 23 km southeast of town at an altitude of 1450m (4754ft) is the closest place if you seek relief from Santa Ana's heat. Several hostels, hotels, and fincas in the area offer accommodation (eg 13.87541-89.671352 Paso Alaska Resort, from $75, [10], or 13.8755-89.672723 Hostal Casa Blanca, $22-$40). As everywhere in the region, ask locals for security advise (and guide, or even police escort) before setting out in the surrounding countryside. You cannot climb Santa Ana vulcano from here!

Stay safe[edit]
Most parts of the city are completely deserted after 7pm. The Metrocentro area, the Parque Libertad, and the pedestrian street Villa Morena (2a Calle Poniente) are considered safe at night as police and security guards are present. Avoid Parque Colon and surroundings after dark, as many homeless and drunken individuals hang around the area.
Be very careful when walking on sidewalks because many manhole covers are missing (stolen for their value as scrap metal) and openings can be several feet deep. Especially after dark it's recommended to walk on the street (if traffic permits).
Do not climb the hills surrounding the city without local security advice and/or police escort, as robberies have occurred.

Cope[edit]
Banks[edit]
Most banks have several branches in town, and ATMs are fairly common. Expect your bags checked by security staff when entering the bank. Try to avoid  payment days (around 15th and 30th of each month) as long queues occur; the only ATM not affected by this phenomena is at Banco G&T Continental (opposite Banco Cuscatlan) which accepts Visa and Master/Maestro cards.

13.99477-89.5579521 Scotiabank, 2a Ave Entre Ave Libertad y 2a Calle Poniente (downtown, just behind Palacio Municipal). Has ATM (which strangly does not accept 6 digit PIN). Other locations are Ave Jose Matias Delgado Entre 1a y 3a Calle Poniente, and in Metrocentro Shopping Mall.

If you don't trust them, better visit one of the many shops, or the carrier's customer center (bring identification document).

Go next[edit]
 San Salvador. 2 bus companies provide services to the capital's Terminal del Occidente: 
 TUDO. Bus 201 travels via the Panamericana. Regular service $0.85, frequent stops. The more comfortable special service (mostly aircon) does not stop along the highway (first stop is in Santa Tecla) $1.35. Departs every 15 min (first at 04:15) from 13.9845-89.586881 bus depot on Antigua Carretera Panamericana (4km southwest of downtown), at least 1h depending on the traffic situation. Take a taxi or local bus marked Paraiso (9, 15, R-3SA, R-4SA, R55-B, or regional bus 210, 218, 236) to get to the bus depot. More convenient boarding points are 31a Calle Poniente y Ave Fray Felipe Moraga Sur, INSA at 31a Calle Poniente y Ave Santa Ana California, or Metrocentro. 
 Seisabus. Bus 201 follows the old Carretera via Coatepeque and Ciudad Arce, frequent stops, up to 2 hr, regular service $1, special service $1.50. Departs every 5 min, first at 03:10 (from 13.97292-89.584142 bus depot at La Ceiba), last at 18:10. Boarding points along 25a Calle and also at Universidad Catolica (UNICAES). 
 Guatemala City (direct bus, only stop is at the border), ☏ +503 2415-0069. Departs 05:00 (except Su), 06:00, 07:00, 08:39, 10:00, 12:00,  13:30, 15:00, 4-4½ hr, $16 (same fare as from San Salvador). 13.97302-89.584833 Puerto Bus Route 415 (joint operations of Pezzarossi, Vencedora, Taca) leaves from new office location at La Ceiba (next to Seisabus depot; behind Puma gas station, take a taxi or local bus R-A from downtown to get there). If possible book a day in advance (bring your passport) so they can put you on the immigration list and you can stay aboard the bus, otherwise you have to visit the salvadorian immigration counter when departing the country.A cheaper but less convenient option is Bus 236 (ordinario) or 236A (especial) from terminal to San Cristobal Frontera, then visit both immigration offices, and catch ongoing bus to Jutiapa and Guatemala City. The shaky Mendez Express bus 402 also departs from terminal at 11:30 (unreliable, check in advance) to Jutiapa and Jalapa, where you can transfer to a Guatemala City bus. 
 Central North of El Salvador (Chalatenango, Suchitoto, border with Honduras at El Poy, avoiding San Salvador). Take bus 276 from terminal via Coatepeque and Quetzaltepeque to Apopa (2½ hr, $0.80). Get off at final stop (at Puma gas station) and transfer to one of the buses going north along the main highway: Bus 125 for Chalatenago, 141 for Nueva Conception, 119 for San Igancio & Border. For Suchitoto take any bus to Aguilares and change there. Be aware that Apopa has the reputation of being the 'gang capital' of El Salvador, so be careful here. 
 Metapán (for Parque National Montecristo). Bus 235 does not leave from terminal but from the 13.98558-89.569194 bus depot at Calle Aldea San Antonio at the western end of 25a Calle Poniente (across the street from Texaco gas station). A more convenient boarding point along Calle Aldea San Antonio is 1/2 block southwest from Parque Colon, or one of the stops along 6a Calle, $0.90. 13.97665-89.559425 Bus 201-A coming from San Salvador also goes to Metapán, board at Boulevard Los 44 (Metrocentro roundabout).From Metapán you can also cross into Guatemala at the border of Anguiatú (bus every 30 min, very convenient if going to Rio Dulce, Puerto Barrios, or Copán Ruinas via Chiquimula), and into Honduras at the border of El Poy (take bus 463 from Metapán terminal, at 05:00 and 12:00, 3 hr). 
 Sonsonate (and on to the pacific coast). Bus 209 (directo) every 25 min from bus station 13.99136-89.564596 Transportes Vencedora at Ave Fray Felipe Moraga Sur y 11a Calle Poniente, via El Congo, travels along the rim high above Lago Coatepeque with occasional views on the lake, 2 hr $0.90. Also bus 216 from terminal via Los Naranjos (1¾ hr $0.70), a very scenic ride over the mountains.
