Tourist information[edit]
Talk[edit]
Greek is the native language of the people of Karpathos. However, most people also speak passable English and many speak German or other European languages.

Get in[edit]
By boat[edit]
Karpathos is accessible via ferry from Athens (Piraeus), Kasos, Crete, and Rhodes.

By plane[edit]
Karpathos airport connects the island with Athens, Rhodes and Crete and many other European cities.

Get around[edit]
By bus[edit]
Public buses operate throughout the islands.

By taxi[edit]
There are taxis available until 2AM, then only one or two.

By car[edit]
You can rent a car or a motor scooter. Asphalt roads run across the west coast of the island. Roads in the interior turn out to be little more than dirt paths.

By motorcycle[edit]
Motorbikes and mopeds are popular alternatives to cars. Especially mopeds are frequently used by local youths and can go to many places that cars cannot go - for example the twisted narrow streets of Karpathos City. An additional advantage is that they are cheap to rent - €10-15 a day is the usual price.
If you start a day-trip with a moped, make you sure you do so on a full tank, as gas stations are sometimes hard to find. An extra stop at a gas station can save a lot of nerves. When renting a moped, check if the profile of the tyres is ok and if the brakes work properly. If it is the last vehicle in store, be suspicious - it could be the one that needs a repair badly. Though helmets are not required on the streets, it might be a good idea to ask your rent-a-bike for one, especially if you intend to drive on streets with more traffic.
Be careful when driving to places like Olympos, it can be very windy in open spaces/roads.
