Monroe is a small city in North Carolina. It is in Union County, on U.S. Highway 74. It has a close association with Charlotte, which is about 30 minutes away by car.  Monroe's population is slightly under 27,000. It used to be populated mostly by White and African-Americans; however, the city's Hispanic population has spiked dramatically.


Get in[edit]
Though Monroe has a small airport, the vast majority of visitors will arrive there by car.  The primary artery through the city is US-74, though there are smaller roads connecting it to other nearby towns.

Get around[edit]
Cars are the only practical form of transportation in Monroe. There is no public transit.  Biking or walking is possible in some areas -- especially in the Historic Downtown -- but not recommended for visitors limiting themselves to the businesses and shopping found along the 74 corridor.

See[edit]
Monroe maintains its historic downtown, though it has seen better days.  The Union County Courthouse has an impressive bell tower, and is in a picturesque downtown district.  The stores along Main St. bear the feeling of a 1940s town, and are reasonably well preserved. Also, the original Belk's Department Store can be found there.
There is a movie theater near the Monroe Mall on Highway 74.

Do[edit]
Monroe is not a tourist center, and there is relatively little for a visitor to do there besides shop.  The Monroe Mall and Union County Farmers' Market are probably your best bet aside from strolling through the downtown area.  High-school football games are also an event of interest for those looking for exposure to Southern culture.

Buy[edit]
The historic downtown of the city has some shopping, and is worth visiting for a casual afternoon. Of particular interest are independently owned boutiques, antique stores, and day spas that populate the Historic Downtown.
Monroe's other shopping district can be found along the US-74 corridor.  The Monroe Mall offers some department store retail, and has a few interesting stores. Other bog box and chain retail stores can be found at Poplin Place.

Eat[edit]
The strip along US-74 has many chain restaurants. If you are looking for chain food, there is no need to plan ahead; just drive down 74 and look for what you want.
For more personal dining, try exploring the historic downtown area. There are a few good cafes to be found there and on surrounding streets.

Go next[edit]
Almost all visitors will leave town via either US-74 or the Old Charlotte Highway (which, obviously, goes to Charlotte and becomes Monroe Rd. in Mecklenburg County).  Driving west on US-74 will also bring you to Charlotte; heading east will eventually take you toward Wilmington and the coast.  The next nearest town to the east is Wadesboro.
