São Sebastião island, Ilhabela.
Ilhabela is an archipelago and a municipality in the North Coast of São Paulo.


Understand[edit]
Ilhabela is considered one of the natural paradises of the São Paulo coast, along with Ubatuba (Ilhabela means literally "beautiful island" in Portuguese). It is known for its forest-covered mountains, its amazing beaches, its savage trails - and difficult not to mention, also its vicious sand flies.
In pre-colonial times, the largest island of the archipelago, São Sebastião, was called Maembipe by Native Brazilians, who used the island for trade and prisoner exchange. The island was discovered in 1502 by the Portuguese, and although settlement began shortly thereafter, the village of the island was officially founded only in 1806, with the name of Vila Bela da Princesa ("Beautiful Village of the Princess"). The municipality would finally be named "Ilhabela" in 1945. In 1977, the majority of the archipelago's area was declared a state park and a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.

Get in[edit]
To get to Ilhabela it is necessary first to go to São Sebastião (the city on the coast, not the island), where a ferry boat, located at the end of Al. São Sebastião (downtown) departs. The bus from São Paulo is about R$70, and ride sharing about R$35-40. There are buses from São Paulo that stop at the ferry boat point, if you are not up to walk 1 km from the São Sebastião intercity bus terminal.

-23.809318-45.3987091 São Sebastião - Ilhabella Ferryboat terminal (Travessia São Sebastião - Ilhabella), Av. Antônio Januário do Nascimento, s/n - Centro, São Sebastião, toll-free: 0800 773 3711. Open 24 hr. From here you can catch a ferryboat to/from Ilhabela. Ferry boats depart every 30 min. between 06:00-00:00, and every 1 hour between 00:00-06:00. The duration of the crossing is 15 min. In high season, a queue of up to 1 hour for vehicles is not uncommon. Pedestrians and cyclists free; cars R$11-17; motorbikes R$6-9. (updated Dec 2017)
Get around[edit]

Since construction in Ilhabela is mostly restricted to the West coast of the São Sebastião island, there is really just one avenue and getting around, by bus or by car, should be simple. The coast has many slopes, making cycling not a very attractive option. Walking is fine, as there are plenty of sidewalks and other infrastructure for pedestrians, but the occasionally long distance between towns can be a problem.
Additionally, the municipality operates several bus services that run the length of the island (one-way R$4 without / $R2.50 with IC card). While not as comfortable as traveling by car, the bus provides a cheaper alternative for those looking to get around the island.
There are also a couple of non-pavimented roads that give access to remote points of the island, like the Castelhanos beach in the East coast. To reach the other side of the coast, you do not necessarily need a 4WD—the road is a proper but unpaved track. Note that only in the morning you are allowed to go west to east, and in the afternoon to go east to west on the Ilhabela-Castelhanos road, which is controlled by the national park staff at the entrance.
The rest of Ilhabela can only be reached by boat or by trails in the rainforest.

Do[edit]

 Scuba diving. There are a good number of places indicated for scuba diving. (updated Dec 2017)
 Boat rides. For those who want a more relaxed time, an option are the boat rides to remote beaches, fishing spots and the smaller islands. (updated Dec 2017)

You might be able to skip the last 16 km across the hills by taking one of the many 4WD that bring tourists back to Cambaquara in the afternoon.). If you need a break from the constant Brazilian hassle and concern for your life, this is where you need to head. You can see monkeys, all kinds of birds, lush jungle forests, beautiful beaches, picturesque waterfalls, and take a dip in one of the many river pools.

Stay healthy[edit]
Ilhabela is, without doubt, a natural paradise,  which can also mean hell for humans. The rainforest in the archipelago is well known for the borrachudos, a sand-fly-like insect whose bites will give you an excruciatingly itchy experience. Use a good quality repellent all the time, in every exposed part of your body including the bottom of your feet, in case you are wearing sandals or flip-flops. Or just wear long clothes to cover your body, instead of using all those chemicals.
Beach pollution problems have started to appear in the west coast of Ilhabela, and at some times of the year, some beaches may not be suitable for swimming. The water quality is weekly monitored by the state water agency (CETESB), so if you see a red flag of CETESB in the beach, don't go swimming. Before you go, you can also check the map of the latest weekly beach quality bulletin (in Portuguese, boletim de qualidade das praias) of the state's Environment Department (CETESB).

Some bus stations in the center provide free WiFi. But just walking around will reveal other open and free WiFi spots.
