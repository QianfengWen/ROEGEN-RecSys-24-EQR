Brooks House on Main Street, built in 1871 as an 80-room luxury hotel
Brattleboro is a town of 12,000 people in southern Vermont.  From points south, it will most likely be the place for travelers to begin their exploration of Vermont.


Understand[edit]
As a Connecticut River town in southern Vermont, Brattleboro benefited greatly from the easy availability of water and water power, and thus has been a prosperous town since the 18th and 19th centuries, as shown by the extraordinary collection of beautiful buildings in various styles that survive from those days and the first few decades of the 20th century. Only a very small selection of them are shown in this article.

Get around[edit]
For getting around the center of town, all you should need are your feet. Amble around the streets, stop at some shops, and just take your time. For getting out the town, a car would be the best way to go.  Be aware that traffic in downtown Brattleboro can resemble that found in cities orders of magnitude larger, in part due to a long term construction project on I-91 that causes people to leave the highway, but more due to all the major streets feeding into Main St in the center of town.  Driving within the center should be avoided and parking all day is quite cheap (under $10). If you are in the mood, though, rent a bike at the Brattleboro Bicycle Shop located downtown at 165 Main St.

See[edit]

A vintage 1938 Worcester diner. Decor and food speak of times gone by with Daily Blue Plate Specials, generous portions and extremely friendly pricing.

Opens at 2PM on the weekends, open until it's closed. A full service drinking establishment located in downtown Brattleboro on Elliot Street in an old firehouse that is across the street from the actual firehouse.

Kipling's has standard pub food and a decent selection of beer. A nice place to stop and get a beer, hang out with friends, etc. Kipling's isn't as trendy as Flat Street Brew Pub and lacks the character and charm of McNeill's, but Kipling's make up for that by being the warmest, friendliest, and most "down-to-earth" bar in Brattleboro.
