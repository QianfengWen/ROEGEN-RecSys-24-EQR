Long Stratton is a small working town in Norfolk catering mainly for the local population. It is 12 miles south of Norwich. The surrounding countryside is ideal for exploring on foot or by bicycle, with quiet rural country lanes without many hills.


Understand[edit]
Most travellers will be visiting the town on their way through (maybe on their way to/from Norwich) as the town lies on the main A140 route to/from Norwich from the S).  There has been much talk over the years of constructing a bypass and considerable pressure from local residents all of which has so far come to nothing. But in 2013 another Planning Consultation started and in 2016 the District Council decided it did want a bypass subject to the development of an additional 1,800 homes.

Get in[edit]
The town lies on the A140 main road south of Norwich. Several bus services between Diss and Norwich (some rural services can be slow).

Cycling[edit]
The surrounding countryside has many small rural quiet roads without many hills ideally suited to cycling.
