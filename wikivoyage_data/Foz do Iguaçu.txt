Foz do Iguaçu is a major city in the Cascavel region, Brazil. It is a gateway to Paraguay and Argentina, and home of the famous Iguaçu Falls. Together with the cities of Ciudad del Este (Paraguay) and Puerto Iguazu (Argentina), it forms part of one of the largest cultural tourism areas in South America.


Understand[edit]
Itaipu dam
Iguaçu Falls near Foz do Iguaçu
Foz do Iguaçu sits at the mouth of the Iguaçu river, discharging into Paraná river, near the borders of Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina. The word Iguaçu means "large water", in Tupi-Guarani. Despite hosting one of Brazil's major tourist attractions, the city has a rather un-touristy feel, and other than the large number of hotels and occasional tri-lingual signs, it looks like any other medium-sized Brazilian city - there are practically no "tourist shopping streets" and like. There is however a large shopping mall being constructed at Avenida das Cataratas, to provide additional convenience to visitors in terms of night-time shopping and gastronomy.
In the past, Foz do Iguaçu formed with a tourism pole together with the nearby city of Guaíra, which hosted the Guaíra Falls (Sete Quedas). After the construction of the gigantic Itaipu Dam in the early 1980s, the Guaíra Falls were inundated, leaving Foz do Iguaçu as the only major traveller destination in the southwestern border of the Paraná state.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]

There are frequent flights from Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Santiago, etc. ATMs are available on the ground level next to Arrivals. Internet terminals and WiFi are available in the upstairs restaurant area but the WiFi can only be purchased in a 24 hour package for R$25 which is quite expensive.When flying out of Foz do Iguaçu, if you're going to Rio de Janeiro, request a window seat on the right side of the plane—don't miss the views!

By bus[edit]
-25.5205-54.56352 International Bus Station (Rodoviária Internacional) (northeast of the center). Most connections and bus companies go from/to this bus station. (updated Jun 2018)

By freight bus company[edit]
The two companies below transport goods and passengers to São Paulo for merchants buying in Ciudad del Este, what makes them so cheap but a little chaotic and different at the same time. They take a while with the boarding, which is also why there is always a restaurant nearby, which they probably own. Also, the journey includes a 30-min stop at a restaurant just 4 hr after leaving Foz do Iguaçu. Furthermore, the bus might be checked a little closer by police, but as a regular tourist that is nothing of your concern, because you do not carry any taxable goods. You and your luggage will also be checked by the bus company for any tradable goods. So, if you have anything still packaged and in uncommon amounts, this might be a problem. As of May 2018, the journey time is 15½ hr, of which 2½ hr are being stuck in São Paulo traffic. Entry and exit points are their local offices. The buses seats are semi-cama. It is probably a good idea to call ahead for reservation or availability of seats, or ask your ho(s)tel.

As with all bus companies, always keep an eye on your luggage—drug smuggling is not unheard of in Brazil. Some people say these buses are smuggler buses, because some people do not pay import taxes on their goods, but this is none of your concern.

By tour company[edit]
In Iguaçu you can find many tour companies that make the trip from/to Paraguay, Argentina or any other point of interest.

Get around[edit]
Map of Foz do Iguaçu
You can cross the international borders to Paraguay and Argentina by public bus, taxi, car, tour car, moto-taxi, or foot. Non-car options are better because you can skip a large part of the line at immigration on both sides. Waits of 1-2 hours are common for cars.

By bus[edit]
FozTrans operates most local buses. Schedules are here, but expect delays. The cash fare is R$5 each ride. Links to route maps are at the bottom of each schedule PDF. Fare is free for those ages 60 and over: show your ID to the bus driver then board through the rear. The official website is not very functional when it is offline so the best alternative is to check the bus route and schedule on the website.
Bus 120 is the most convenient connection, running from the TTU (city center urban transport bus station), through the city center, to the airport, the bird park, and finally the national park.
The airport is 15 km south of the city center and 3 km northwest of the national park.
The airport bus stop is a short 20 m outside the main entrance (to your left when exiting the terminal).
At the airport, be sure to ask the driver so you know which direction the 120 bus is going, as it stops two times at the airport - one time on its route to the bird park and then visitor's center in the park, and then again while returning back from the park to the city center.
By bus, the park visitor's center is 10 minutes from the airport, while the city center is 40-60 min, depending on traffic.
Ciudad del Este, Paraguay is across the western Paraná River via the Friendship Bridge.
Puerto Iguazu, Argentina is across the southern Rio Iguaçu.
Rio Uruguay (officially Transporte Três Fronteiras SA) departs from a stop on the northwest corner on the street immediately north of the TTU on the Brazilian side. Google Maps
Don’t forget your passport or Mercosul ID.
The fare is 700 Argentinian pesos or R$15 Brazilian reais each way as of January 2023.
Paying in pesos is usually better; ask around and lots of commercial folk around the borders like the bus driver or news stands will exchange (“câmbio”) currency or point you to an exchange.
First departure 6:30am, last departure 6:30pm, 45 minute ride.
Buses depart the TTU every hour on the half hour to the “Terminal [de Buses de] Puerto Iguazú” (Google Maps) on the Argentinian side, where you can take another paid bus transfer to the falls.
The bus will stop multiple times, including an optional stop at Brazilian immigration (you can skip it if you will return and don’t feel strongly about an outgoing stamp) and a mandatory stop at the Argentinian immigration (“migraciónes”).
Buses return from Terminal Puerto Iguazú also every hour on the half hour. First return 7:30am, last return 6:30pm.
Always check with the driver for seasonal changes to schedule.
By rideshare[edit]
Prices vary. As of January 2023, expect:

R$10–15 for 10 minute rides within the city center
R$45–65 for 45 minute rides between the city center and the airport or parks. These rides can be hard to find because local companies discourage ride share drivers from waiting near these destinations.
To get the best price and maximize your chances of getting a ride, use multiple apps:

Uber is available but is not the most popular or cheapest app. Drivers may message you asking to pay out-of-app in cash; this is normal. Say “Combinado” to accept. Say “Não dá” to reject. Either way, say “Favor cancelar no app” to ask them to cancel the ride so you can stop or continue your ride search without Uber cancellation fees.
Rápidocar (iOS, Android) is the most popular local rideshare app. It is best for travel within the city center. You may have to change your App Store region to Brazil to download it.
99 (iOS, Android) [pronounced no-VEIN-ta EE no-VEE] is a national rideshare app that is also popular locally.
By taxi[edit]
Coopertáxi Cataratas taxi stands are widely available at most tourist destinations. You can also hail them using their Android app. Ask if they accept credit cards ("Aceita cartão?").
As of April 2022, fares are at most R$5.10 + R$4.62/kilometer. Expect around R$75 between the city center and the airport or Brazilian falls. Trips exiting the city have different rates.

If you are keen to save some money, head over to the Paraguayan side of the dam. They offer the same tours for free, some requiring registration one week ahead, but some days might work as well if it is not high season. Take the border bus (R$5.50) to Ciudad del Este center and the nearby -25.5098-54.61645 Terminal bus urbano, from where the bus to Hernandarias and Itaipu is going. You will probably need to change some money into guaranis for the bus to and from the dam. Use the exchange opportunities explained for Ciudad del Este. Also, read more on how to get to the dam under the Ciudad del Este article.
-25.5925-54.5930564 Three Borders Landmark (Argentina–Brazil–Paraguay tripoint) (Bus 110). 13:30-21:00 (Tuesday - Sunday). The place where Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay meet.

Bus line 110 leaving from the Downtown Terminal whose final destination is the landmark. There is a new visitor center and a museum on the Brazilian side. It has a wall around it, so you cannot see the Brazilian border mark without paying. It's now a tourist attraction with live shows in the evening.Argentinian border mark is easily accessible even by walk from the center, or by bus. Paraguayan mark is quite far from the city, accessible by buses from the centre (Av. General Bernardino Caballero), take a bus labelled Tres Fronteras (destination, not the company name) and ask for La Balsa (the ferry), ask to get out in front of the huge gate. Argentina: Free, Brazil: R$49, Paraguay: free.   (updated Jan 2024)
-25.5102-54.61165 Paraguay Border Market (take the border bus for R$5.50). The border markets close very early at around 16:00 in local winter and 17:00 in local summer, right before sunset. Shopping is the main business of the visitors. The main shopping streets are San Blas and Camilo Recalde, where you can buy almost anything. Many people come for electronics. Otherwise, get some Paraguayan Chipa and/or exchange your dollars here. You probably do not need to get your passport stamped if you return to Brazil afterwards, as long as you have a valid visa for Brazil. (updated Mar 2019)
Do[edit]
 Salto do Macuco (Tinamou Drop) (Macuco Safári) (Inside Iguaçu Park). 9AM-5PM. On this tour, the visitor takes trails in an open, electric vehicle, accompanied by trilingual guides over 3 km of jungle. The vehicle stops at the beginning of a 600-m trail that leads to the Salto do Macuco – with its crystal clear waters that fall from a height of 20 m over rocks, forming a tiny lake. Those who do not want to descend on foot can take the same electric car to where they embark on the inflatable boat. It is an exciting adventure as the boat navigates over a canyon’s waters and gets very near the huge Garganta do Diabo falls and then receives the “wet blessing” from the Three Musketeers Falls. To get there take the Cataratas Highway to km 23, already inside the Iguaçu National Park. A hint: if you don’t want to get soaked, take a raincoat. R$362 + park entrance. (updated Jan 2023)
 Helicopter Tour. 09:00-17:00. This 10-minute tour provides a beautiful aerial view of Iguaçu National Park. It is the best way to understand the real dimensions of the Falls. Another option is to fly over the Itaipu Hydroelectric Plant. For the flight over the Iguacu falls, you need a minimum of 3 people (the helicopter can take 7 people + the pilot), but you can wait around and will usually find another group of one or two people. R$435. (updated Apr 2017)
 Poço Preto (Black Well). This excursion is made in a special vehicle – over a rustic 18 km trail - through the exuberant vegetation of the National Park. It lasts up to 5 hours. Specialized guides accompany the visitors who can photograph or watch birds. It is located on km 18 of BR 469 – the Cataratas Highway. 
Buy[edit]
Foz do Iguaçu is not a shopping destination. Brazilians generally go to the neighbouring cities of Ciudad del Este in Paraguay for cheaper imported goods, or to Puerto Iguazu in Argentina for Argentinean wines and alfajor.

 Downtown. Downtown shopping is mostly found at Av. Brasil (between Av. Jorge Schimmelpfeng and Av. República Argentina) and its surroundings. Shops there are mostly aimed at locals, not tourists, and do not open on evenings or Sundays. 
 Cataratas JL Shopping, Av. Costa e Silva, 185 - Pólo Centro. 11:00-23:00. A typical Brazilian-style shopping mall which offers the conveniences of late evening shopping and a decent food court. Contains a branch of the Brazilian department store Havan. The mall is definitely not tourist-oriented, but has trilingual signs. 113 shops. 
Money[edit]
Changing money in Ciudad del Este is considerably cheaper than in Foz, even when getting Brazilian Real. The bus ticket to Ciudad del Este is just R$5.50 one-way. See article: Ciudad del Este#Money.

Stay safe[edit]
Crimes have happened to pedestrians walking across the Friendship Bridge. Tourists with cash and shopping products attracts criminals, and an attack is particularly easy because the walkway on both sides is narrow and enclosed by metal fencing on both sides, making escape impossible. One common attack is a group of 2-4 men with pistols who encircle groups of walkers, stealing all wallets, phones, and merchandise. Generally, the criminals throw their booty into bags and then leave towards the Paraguayan side (supposedly they bribe the Paraguayan police to allow them to pass unobstructed). Moto-taxis also participated in the attacks in 2018. Although there are border agents and police on both sides of the bridge, the bridge has no security, which further exacerbates the risk. Attacks in September 2018 were featured on TV news because of the severity. Despite the risk, many people, particularly daily commuters who work on both sides, still prefer to walk across the bridge in order to avoid the traffic jams and the expense of the bus. Realistically, the odds of being attacked if you walk across during the day are low, but it's important to be very cautious because attacks can and do happen every month. If you're at all concerned, hide your valuables, do not walk in groups but with locals, or simply take the bus.

Go next[edit]
Iguaçu Falls – Obviously the most important attraction nearby Foz do Iguaçu. The world-famous falls.
Puerto Iguazu – On the Argentinian side of the border, offers access to the Argentinian side of the falls and a number of casinos and shopping. Buses go from behind of Local Bus Terminal every 30-60 minutes and costs R$4. If you are staying for longer than a day you need to get off at each border and pass through immigration. Bus will not wait for you, so you will have to wait for the next bus, that you can board with the original ticket. As it is not far and buses do not go often, walking may be faster.
Ciudad del Este – On the Paraguay side of the border, it is a rather chaotic mid-size town that serves as a shopping destination for Brazilians and Argentinians looking for low-tax imported goods.
Some taxis will take you to Puerto Iguazu and wait for you to pass through the two customs but are quite expensive. For example, taking the taxi only to the Argentinian border from Foz de Iguacu costs around R$40. You need to agree with the driver on a price before boarding as they don't want to use the meter for these sort of trips.
