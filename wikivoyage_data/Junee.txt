By train[edit]
Junee is at the crossroads of the old NSW train network - and is still a significant stop on the line between Sydney and Melbourne, and Sydney and Griffith.  It seems 2 services each way most days, and the Griffith train goes down from Sydney on Saturdays and returns on Sunday.

Get around[edit]
By bike[edit]
Junee has a very well developed cycle path network for a country town, and being in town with a bike for a few days is a practical way to get around.  The federation pathway leads out to the showground, and the Licorice Factory.  You can cycle through the wetlands.

See[edit]
-34.8834147.57911 Roundhouse Museum, 92 Harold St, ☏ +61 2 6924 2909. Junee has a great history as a railway junction town. The roundhouse was the largest in the Southern Hemisphere, and still houses a good collection of engines and carriages - may of which are open to explore. (updated Jun 2018)
 Monte Cristo Homestead, 1 Homestead Ln, ☏ +61 409 945 204. This is billed as a Haunted House, but it's all marketing fluff. The house itself hasn't been maintained in many years, and most of what passes for exhibits are covered in dust. The garden is run down, and many parts of the house are closed off. You'll either feel ripped off, or if you're really into kitsch you may get into it. (updated Jun 2018)
