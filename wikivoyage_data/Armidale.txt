Armidale is a small city (population 24,500 in 2018) in the New England region of the Australian state of New South Wales and is Australia's highest city in terms of altitude. The picturesque city is noted for its colonial-era architecture, centres of education and culture and the nearby wilderness and gorge country.


Understand[edit]
Armidale is a place of four seasons. The winters are very cold, with snow sometimes falling in the winter months and overnight temperatures below freezing. The old English-style gardens in the area blossom in Spring, as the firs, willows and oaks in town and in the University of New England grounds sprout new leaves. In autumn, the town celebrates the changing colours of the trees with an Autumn Festival, which includes a street parade down the main boulevards. But it is summer that is arguably the best time to visit Armidale. Due to its altitude, the town is rarely humid, and even days where the temperature reaches 35°C are tolerable.

Armidale is 485 km from Sydney via the scenic Thunderbolts Way through Gloucester and Walcha.
Armidale is also located at the start of the Waterfall Way to Raleigh, near Coffs Harbour on the coast. This scenic route passes through the gorge country as the tablelands drop to the coastal region. Located along the way are three national parks, which are listed as World Heritage Areas by UNESCO and form part of the Gondwana Rainforest of Australia. Dorrigo National Park encompasses the waterfalls that give the route its name. Driving time to the coast is 2½ hours.

Get around[edit]
Map of Armidale
The historic centre of Armidale is small enough to be easily covered on foot. However, some attractions (the University and the New England Regional Art Museum) are on the outskirts of town, making access difficult for the less-mobile traveller.
A bus service (Edwards) does run frequently between the town centre and the University, but the best way to explore the town and surrounding countryside is by car. Car hire is available on arrival at the airport. Taxi services are also widely available.
Getting between the town and the university is an easy cycle, with bicycle lanes on the roads and quiet traffic.

Drink[edit]
Armidale perhaps enjoys a livelier nightlife than many towns of its size, due to the large university student population from UNE. It has a selection of nearly 10 pubs to choose from. Each one has a nickname with the locals and students, and knowing the name on the door of the pub won't help you in conversation. Moving between two or three pubs in a night is not uncommon, and running into the same people at another pub later on happens.
