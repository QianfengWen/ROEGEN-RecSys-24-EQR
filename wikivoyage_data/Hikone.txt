See[edit]
View from the teahouse at Genkyuen
35.27639136.251671 Hikone Castle (彦根城 Hikone-jō). Hikone Castle is an original Japanese castle dating back to 1604, instead of the usual 1960s-era concrete reconstruction. The castle tower is an official National Treasure and a number of the turrets have been classified as Important Cultural Properties. Even the sound of the bell every three hours is preserved as a nationally important soundscape. Admission ¥800, including entry to Genkyu-en.   (updated Nov 2023)
35.27639136.251672 Genkyū-en Garden (玄宮園). Hikone's number two attraction is the garden at the foot of the castle. The park contains a sprawling villa built in the Chinese Tang Dynasty style in 1677 for Naooki Ii, the fourth lord of Hikone. The best thing to do here is to pause at the teahouse for a cup of matcha (ceremonial green tea), a Japanese sweet and some quiet contemplation for ¥500. (updated May 2016)

Do[edit]
Buy[edit]
Hiko-nyan
Taking the JR regular (non-express) train to the next stop, along the Biwako-sen, you will stop at Minami-Hikone. Get off at this stop and there is VivaCity, a large shopping complex that is the only mall in Hikone. There are many shops, some restaurants, karaoke, and a movie theatre here. On many Sundays at 13:00 and 15:00 there are live performances in the central atrium.
Fans of traditional Japan will enjoy the Yume-Kyobashi Castle Road running from the southwest side of the castle park, with a number of souvenir shops and craft shops located in traditional-style wooden buildings.
Fans of modern Japanese craziness, on the other hand, may enjoy all sorts of souvenirs plastered with the mug of Hiko-nyan (ひこにゃん), Hikone City's official samurai-helmeted cat mascot. Although many cities, as well as some attractions, have their own mascots, Hikonyan has gained fame well beyond his hometown, making him an iconic symbol of the samurai days and perhaps even the nation itself. Hiko-nyan paraphernalia of all sorts can be purchased on Castle Road, at Viva City, and most anywhere else in Hikone.

Eat[edit]
The road from the station to the castle is lined with an array of restaurants and souvenir shops. The Yume-Kyobashi Castle Road also has a number of restaurants.

 Sennari-tei (千成亭). Local Omi beef specialist. 
 Unagiya Gennai (うなぎや源内). An unagi (eel) restaurant. (updated Apr 2024)
