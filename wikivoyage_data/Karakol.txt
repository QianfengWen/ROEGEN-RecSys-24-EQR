Karakol (Каракол) is a city in Kyrgyzstan on the east of Lake Issyk Kul.


Understand[edit]
Karakol is at the far end of the Issyk Kul, nestled in the Tian Shan mountains, and is the capital of the Issyk Kul Oblast (region). One of the most visited destinations in Kyrgyztan, it functions as a base for year-round trekking, mountaineering, skiing, and spa opportunities.
This town was called Przhevalsk (Пржевалск) during the Tsarist and Soviet eras. It was constructed by Tsarist troops as a military outpost, and it is the resting place of Nikolai Przewalski, the famed Russian explorer and naturalist after whom this town was named. It is a city of traditional Russian houses, and contains one of the few Slavic populations remaining in Central Asia.
There are a number of tour companies, hostels and cafes, but most of the action is outside of town.

Serving destination along the northern shore of Issyk Kul, including Cholpon-Ata and Balykchy, but also a few marshrutkas to Bishkek. Note, if you come from the north, do not get off at this remote bus station if the other people remain in the marshrutka. Instead it will often continue into the center. The bus driver is just trying to get off the tourist, which will then be flagged down by overpricing taxi drivers at this station. (updated Mar 2019)
42.48728578.3873692 South Bus Station. Serves all destinations along the southern shore of Issyk Kul, including Bokonbayev, Balykchy, Kochkor, but also Bishkek. For the current schedules see the timetable in to picture to the right. (updated Mar 2019)

All around the Big Bazaar you will find buses serving close by destinations (see bus numbers below), including Jeti-Ögüz village (Жети-Өгүз (Курорт)) (on the southern end of the bazaar), and Ak-Suu village (Ак-Суу (Курорт)) for Altyn Arashan (southeast of the bazaar). (updated Mar 2019)
Specific destinations:

Balykchy – Regular buses, 200 som.
Cholpon-Ata – All transport between Bishkek and Karakol along the northern shore, goes by it. But there is also the one or other direct marshrutka or shared taxi. Head to the Main/Northern Bus Station.
Bishkek – Regular bus, marshrutka and (shared) taxi services leave Bishkek in the morning for the 5–6 hr drive. The bus/marshrutka fare is about 350 som (June 2018). A seat in a shared taxi is 500–600 som (July 2016), but it is fast, 3-4 hr. It seems most routes go along the northern side of the lake. You can also transfer in Balykchy, from where routes go north or south along the lake. Many marshrutkas will make a stopover here.
Kazakhstan – Regular buses and (shared) taxis leave for the Kazakh border to Kegen. The Kegen border crossing is open during summer (May–September/October). Kazakh customs seems to be open 07:30-17:00 (May 2024).
By plane[edit]
42.58833376.7133334 Tamchy Airport (IKU IATA, Issyk Kul Airport), Tamchy (approximately 2½–3 hr away). Tamchy has limited air service during the summer travel season from/to the nearby cities of Kyrgyzstan (Bishkek), Kazakhstan (Almaty), Uzbekistan (Tashkent), and even Russia (Novosibirsk). The aforementioned buses and shared taxis would be the way into Karakol.   (updated Nov 2018)
In addition, Manas International Airport (FRU IATA) serving the capital Bishkek is further away but has many more flights including ones from Moscow, Dubai, Delhi and Istanbul with further connections from all over the world.

By taxi[edit]
A taxi from nearby Bokonbayevo with sightseeing stops along the way can be arranged for 3,000 som. But this is far beyond any reasonable price you should pay in this country. You are better off hitchhiking (autostop) or using a marshrutka, for a more authentic way of travel.
