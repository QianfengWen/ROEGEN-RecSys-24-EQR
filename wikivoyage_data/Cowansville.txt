Cowansville is a town of over 15,000 people (2021) surrounding Lake Davignon, in Brome-Missisquoi, in the Eastern Townships region of Quebec, in Canada. It is close to the many ski resorts of the Eastern Townships.


Understand[edit]
Place Nelsonville
Cowansville' economy is based on the industrial sector, in particular textiles. There is also a hospital, Brome-Missisquoi-Perkins, a municipal court, a federal penitentiary, and a Nature Centre close to Davignon Lake.
Cowansville's commercial activity has blossomed mainly because of its proximity to a major freeway, Autoroute 10, and the Eastern Townships ski resort region.

History[edit]
Résidence George-Knight-Nesbitt, 215 rue du Sud
Jacob Ruiter was the first person to settle on the current site of Cowansville. In 1800 he built a flour mill, and then a saw mill. In 1805, Ruiter named the small town Nelsonville, in honour of British admiral, Lord Horatio Nelson, who was killed in the naval Battle of Trafalgar.
Peter Cowan, a merchant from Montreal, settled in the area in 1836 and become postmaster in 1841. In order to avoid the mail being sent inadvertently to another city named Nelsonville, close to Hamilton in Upper Canada, he decided to change its name.
During the 1870s, the construction of the South Eastern Railway linking Montreal to Cowansville and the opening of the first bank, the Eastern Townships Bank, contributed to the expansion of the small city, which allowed many businesses settle in the area.
