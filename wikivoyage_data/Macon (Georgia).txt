Macon is a city in Georgia's Classic Heartland.

Downtown Macon seen from the Ocmulgee National Monument.

Understand[edit]
Macon is the center of a metropolitan area that contains around 400,000 people and encompasses the nearby city of Warner Robins. The downtown area of Macon has antebellum homes, cathedrals, and other historic buildings that were built in the past by Macon's elite, including the Woodruff House, the Hay House, and the Cannonball House.
Macon is one of several cities to hold a cherry blossom celebration in springtime, although Macon stands out because it has a particularly large number of trees throughout the city. With over 275,000 Yoshino cherry trees, Macon calls itself the "Cherry Blossom Capital of the World."

Get around[edit]
Map of Macon (Georgia)
By foot[edit]
The downtown area is reasonably compact, and most travelers can probably explore this area on foot. However, traveling to other sites outside the downtown area will require an automobile.

By bus[edit]
The Macon Transit Authority (☏ +1 478 803-2505 (M-Sa 5AM-10PM)) operates a bus service throughout the city. The routes map will show you which bus route to take, and the bus schedule [dead link] will explain when to arrive at the bus stop. In general, a bus arrives at each stop every 30-40 minutes. You must pay the bus fare when you board the bus; the regular fare is $1.25. If you will be transferring to a second bus route in order to reach your final destination, notify the bus driver when you pay your $1.25 fare; each transfer costs $0.50. When the bus is within one or two blocks of your destination, pull the yellow cord inside the bus to signal to the driver that you want to stop.

By car[edit]
Touring Macon by car is perhaps the best way to see the city, especially if you plan to visit sites far from the main downtown area, such as the Ocmulgee Indian Mounds or the Museum of Arts and Sciences.
