Get in[edit]
Knaresborough railway viaduct
See also Harrogate, as many transport routes come that way.

By train[edit]
54.009-1.47031 Knaresborough railway station  is on a loop of lines connecting Leeds (45 minutes, two per hour) and York (30 minutes, hourly); Northern Rail runs this service. Anywhere else will involve a change at Leeds or York. York is the better connection for London Kings Cross, with a journey time of under 2 hours.
At York station, the loop train via Knaresborough is shown as going to Burley Park, in the Headingley/University area of Leeds, to avoid sending travellers to Leeds a long way round. Conversely, the loop train at Leeds station may be shown as going to Poppleton, a small halt just outside York.
On trains arriving in Knaresborough from Leeds or Harrogate, keep your eyes open when you pass over the viaduct for picturesque views of the town and the River Nidd before you pull into the station.

By bus[edit]
Between Harrogate and Knaresborough, use the frequent Bus 1, see "Get around" below.
Bus 780 runs between Knaresborough and Wetherby, M-Sa every two hours, taking 30 min. It runs along B6164 via Little Ribston, and doesn't take the main road through Spofforth.

Knaresborough Castle
54.0069-1.4691 Knaresborough Castle, Castle Yard HG5 8AS. Daily 11AM-4PM. This is where you flee to if you've just assassinated Archbishop Thomas Becket. The castle was built by the Normans circa 1100, but its royal heyday was 1200-1400. In 1648 it was "slighted" by the Parliamentarians, i.e., partly demolished to prevent rebels using it in future, as were many other castles across the British Isles. The citizens promptly looted the ruins (an early form of recycling) to build their own mansions with "castle stone". Admire what's left in this pleasant park overlooking the river. Free.

54.0086-1.47472 Mother Shipton's Cave and the Petrifying Well, Prophecy Lodge, High Bridge, HG5 8DD, ☏ +44 1423 864600, info@mothershipton.co.uk. Apr-Oct: M-F 10AM-4:30PM, Sa Su 10AM-5:30PM. Ursula Southeil or "Mother Shipton" (1488-1561) is supposed to have been born here, and to have made various scary prophecies. Much of what's attributed to her is later invention, especially the famous prophecy "The world to an end shall come, in eighteen hundred and eighty-one." This was written in 1862, and later amended to "1981" when cosmic events failed to oblige; there's probably a 2024 version coming soon.Her supposed birthplace, the cave of the Petrifying Well, is a mix of creepy and tacky. Reachable by a riverside walk of about 20 minutes through the woods, it's a rock overhang with a continual drip of lime-rich water from above. The limestone solidifies, as if building a stalagmite, so any object left here for a few months gradually turns to stone. A whole tourist trade has built up around this: teddy bears and similar soft toys are popular sacrificial objects, what's that really all about? £8/£10 per pedestrian weekdays/weekend; £25 for up to five people arriving by car including parking.

What is believed to be the 54.0081-1.46693 oldest chemist's shop in England, 16 Market Place, Knaresborough, North Yorkshire HG5 8AG. In a 17th-century timber-framed Grade II building marked with a blue plaque. But it ceased to be a chemist in 1997 and is now the Lavender Tea Rooms.   Boots is just round the corner.
54.0084-1.471514 Knaresborough Viaduct. Dating back to the mid-19th century, the railway viaduct over the River Nidd is attractive and of some historic interest. When it was nearing completion in 1848, the viaduct collapsed due to poor construction, causing the river to flood and killing the fish. It was rebuilt in 1851, apparently with more care the second time around because it's still standing today, carrying trains between Harrogate and York.   (updated Jul 2021)
Harrogate is worth a day to explore, and has better eating & drinking options.
