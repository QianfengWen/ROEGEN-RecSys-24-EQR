Riverside is a city in Riverside County in California. With a population of over 300,000, the city plays host to a diverse cross-section of people and has a rich history. Riverside is approximately 55 miles east of downtown Los Angeles. It is a center for higher education, with one community college, a large state university, and two private universities. A hub of regional commerce and transportation, it is a city with an intriguing past and a promising future, and is worth a visit.


Understand[edit]
While Riverside might be perceived as a "suburb" of Los Angeles, its population of over 300,000 would make it a substantial city in its own right pretty much everywhere else and the twelfth largest in California. It is one of the centers of the Inland Empire and host to UC Riverside.

Get in[edit]
Mt. Rubidoux
By plane[edit]
Riverside is part of the Inland Empire of Southern California. It is about a 17-mile drive from Ontario International Airport. This medium-sized airport has direct flights to many American cities (and Mexico), an uncrowded terminal, and generally easy freeway access. Travelers interested in flying into Ontario should probably look into Southwest Airlines which generally has reasonable prices. Flying into the other Los Angeles-area airports to reach Riverside is certainly possible, but not recommended. LAX, Burbank Airport, Long Beach Airport, and Orange County's John Wayne Airport are all about an hour's drive away; and that's without congestion, which isn't likely. If you have your own aircraft, Riverside Municipal Airport is centrally located and offers easy access to the city. No commercial passenger flights serve this airport.
After arriving at Ontario Airport, you can use Southern California's infamous freeway system to get to Riverside. Follow the signs for Interstate 10 East, then get on the I-15 South, and get on the CA-60 East. You will spend only about 2 miles on the I-15, so stay in the two right-hand lanes. After that interchange, you're only about 15 miles outside of the city.
It is possible to take public transport from Ontario International to Riverside. However, it is most certainly difficult. For non-drivers or frugal travelers, here's the information: Take the airport shuttle around to the Omnitrans bus stop on Airport Dr, and wait for the Omnitrans 61 bound for Ontario/Fontana. This will cost you $1.15, exact change only. If it is during commute hours on weekdays, get off at the Ontario Mills transit center, near the mall. Board a red Riverside Transit Agency route 204 bus headed towards "Riverside". It will cost you $2.25 and take about half an hour. If it is not during commute hours on the weekdays, buy an Omnitrans day pass ($3.50) on the #61 and ride it to Fontana Metrolink. From there, board either the #10 or #14 to San Bernardino, and get off downtown. Cross the street and board the #200 to Riverside. Either will eventually drop you off at the Downtown Riverside Bus Terminal.

By car[edit]
Riverside is located at the junction of CA-60, 91 and I-215, approximately 55 mi east of Los Angeles (1hr 13 min via Ca-60), 12 mi (11 min) south of San Bernardino on I-215, 55 mi (1hr 10 min on CA-60 and I-10) west of Palm Springs, and 114 mi (2hr 14min) northeast of San Diego (via Interstate 15 & 215):

Get around[edit]
Map of Riverside


By car[edit]
Riverside is in Southern California and Southern Californians are slaves to the automobile. Most of the time, getting around in Riverside will involve some form of car, and traffic congestion can ruin your day, and the poor driving habits of some other drivers may make you want to pull your hair out.
The CA-60/I-215 runs along the north side of the city. (Confusingly, the two freeways merge at the Riverside 60/91/215 interchange and then split again at the Moreno Valley Interchange, which is still actually within the city limits.) The Market Street exit provides access to Downtown, the 3rd/Blaine and University exits allow easy entry into the University neighborhood, and the Martin Luther King exit will allow you run of the mostly-residential Canyon Crest area. If you proceed on the CA-60 just past the interchange, get off at Day Street and you'll arrive at one of two area malls, the Moreno Valley Mall. It isn't in Riverside proper, but many people shop there rather than brave city traffic to go to the Galleria at Tyler.
The CA-91 runs from its origins at the 60/215/91 interchange in the north of the city, and runs the length of Riverside, eventually extending into Corona, Orange County and terminating in Long Beach. Notable exits include University Ave., which borders Downtown, Central Ave., which is near the new, upscale Riverside Plaza, Tyler St., immediately next to the Galleria at Tyler mall, and La Sierra Ave., which is near the city's second Metrolink station, and Castle Park.
The major crosstown arteries are Arlington and Magnolia Avenues. Congestion on these streets is interminable, and travelers would be well-advised to use  other routes. Jurupa Ave. largely parallels Arlington, and Indiana and Victoria avenues parallel Magnolia. Victoria avenue is lightly-used, and is quite scenic. If you're willing to drive slightly out of your way, it's well worth the extra distance to cruise among the city's old orange groves.

Public transport[edit]
While the vast majority in the city do use automobiles, there is public transit available in Riverside. The Riverside Transit Agency provides fixed-route bus service on around 15 routes in the city, as well as three express commuter services and a few new community-based trolley-bus routes. Trips up and down Magnolia Ave. on route 1, on University Ave on route 16, and on route 15 along Arlington Ave are relatively frequent, with 20, 30, and 40 minute headways, respectively. Weekends and other routes can cause more delay. The entire Riverside city bus service essentially stops running at 8PM; with a few routes running through 10PM. There is no service at night. 
The Riverside bus system has two main hubs – the Downtown Terminal, and the Galleria at Tyler in the south of the city. Chances are you will have to travel to one of these transfer points to get anywhere in the city. Commuter express routes 204 and 216 stop at the Downtown Terminal with destinations of Montclair/Ontario and Orange County, and 216 and OCTA 794 stop at the Galleria, both headed towards Orange County. Local routes serve all surrounding areas.
Taxis have been known to congregate on Fairmount Ave. between the Greyhound and city bus terminals. This is helpful if you end up caught by the sudden unavailability of public transport at night.
Trip planning is available on the web site, on Google Maps, and by calling +1-800-800-7821 M-F between 7AM and 7PM, and Sa Su 8AM and 5PM.

Taxis[edit]
Taxi services are available in the city at the following telephone numbers:

For a panoramic view of the city, try climbing Mt. Rubidoux! Well... to say climb is a bit strong. The route up Mt. Rubidoux is a steady, sometimes-paved but mostly sandy incline lined with tall, prickly pear cactus and humongous rocks. A steady gait makes for about an hour round trip. Don’t forget to bring a camera. If it’s a clear day, one can see clear into nearby Corona to the West and Moreno Valley to the East. The sunsets from this vantage are beautiful, too! Be sure you are able to make it down before the sky gets too dark though as there are no lights lining the path.Also, bringing a bottle of water is a good idea as there are no fountains or vending machines anywhere on or around the mountain. The entrance to the park is in a residential area. The park entrance is at the west end of 9th street, under a large iron gate. Parking is extremely limited in the surrounding neighbourhoods. Free!.

This park provides a look back to the time when orange groves dominated what is now the city of Riverside, and reminds us where Orange County got its name. A small museum resides at the center of this park, surrounded by a working citrus orchard. If you go, be sure to pick up a sack of fresh oranges, which should run you around $4–5. Riverside is the birthplace of the navel orange, and we still do it best. free, $8 parking.   
 The Original Navel Orange Tree, Traffic Island, corner of Magnolia & Arlington Avenues (#1, 13 or 15 bus). Open 24 Hours. Speaking of that "birthplace of the navel orange" stuff, the original navel orange tree, to which all other navel orange trees trace their lineage, is still growing. It's on a traffic island on the corner of Magnolia and Arlington. There's a bench and a marker, and you can pick oranges off it- if any are ripe. Just don't take them all, it's rude. Free. 
Do[edit]
Riverside has many activities to occupy your time. Local concerts are often held in various venues around the city. The college's independent FM radio station, KUCR 88.3, has a reasonably good listing of cultural events in the area.

Trailheads are accessible at the end of Big Springs St. and Blaine St. (an easy walk from the terminus of the #10 bus) as well as off of Central Ave and Chicago Ave (accessible from the #20 and #22 bus).

What they do while at said location is their own business. 
 Van Buren Cinema 3, Van Buren Blvd (just off of the 91 freeway in the south of the city). Double features are common. $6 for adults, with children 9 and under free. 
 Rubidoux Drive-In. The second of Riverside's drive-ins is just outside of the city limits off the 60 at Valley Way. In addition to holding Swap Meets every weekend, the Rubidoux Drive-In shows double features nightly. $7 for adults, and $1 for children 9 and under. 
33.9839-117.3753 The Fox Performing Arts Center (in the historic Fox Theater building downtown). Hosts plays, concerts and musicals.

 Southern California Air Show (formerly The Riverside Airshow). generally in April at March Air Force Base. 
Buy[edit]
The city has a few major shopping venues.
The Downtown area, centered around the Downtown Pedestrian Mall, consists mainly of upscale and specialty shops. It is an entertaining walk, but in most cases serious shopping is better left to one of the local malls. This area is just a short walk from the Downtown bus terminal (routes 1, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 22, 29, 49, Omni 215, CommuterLink 204, 208, 210, 212, 215), and can be accessed via the Market exit off of the 60 freeway, and the University exit off of the 91. It is also served by the Red line trolley, route 50, running around the downtown area for only $0.25.
The  Riverside Plaza is a small collection of mostly upscale shops and restaurants just off the 91 freeway at Central Ave. It is anchored by Forever 21, Vons, Borders and a 16-screen cinema. It is served by bus routes 1, 10, 12, 13, 14 and 20.
The Galleria at Tyler is the largest shopping center in the area, a two-story mall with nearly every store one can think of, as well as large commercial developments for three blocks in all directions. Parking is free, but crowded. It's just off the 91 freeway at Tyler street, and served by bus routes 1, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 21, 27, 216 and OCTA 794. Be aware that on Friday nights and weekends this area will be extremely congested with both vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
While it's not in the city of Riverside, the Moreno Valley Mall and its surrounding development has provided an attractive alternative to the residents of the city's northern areas, especially those attending the University of California. This two-story mall is equipped with all the usual amenities, and is usually significantly less crowded than the Galleria. It is accessible via the 60 freeway off the Day Street and Frederick exits, and is served from Riverside by bus route 16 and CommuterLink 208 and 210. (Bus routes 11, 18, 19, and 36 also serve the mall, but travel from neighboring Moreno Valley.)

Eat[edit]
Riverside has the major chain-restaurant fare around major establishments. Applebee's is near the train station, TGI Fridays at the Galleria, and Denny's, IHOP, and CoCo's share a corner at Iowa and University near UCR.
However, there is some local fare to be proud of as well. 

33.956777-117.3952531 The Lucky Greek, Magnolia and Merrill (close to the 91 at Central and short walk from the #1 and #10 buses), ☏ +1 951-686-2621. No trip to Riverside ought to be complete without a greasy hamburger here. The Lucky Greek has been serving up their signature greaseballs and pastrami for over 20 years. Expect to pay around $5.50 for a burger, fries and a coke. The decor hasn't been updated since they opened, but the food will make you forget about it shortly. 
33.975942-117.3416152 Templo Del Sol (routes 1, 14, 16, and 51). A run-down looking establishment on University between Iowa and Cranford. The service is friendly but excruciatingly slow, but the food is inexpensive, authentic and excellent. Happy hour specials Monday through Thursday include $2 beer and $1 tacos. $5–7/plate. 
Downtown, Canyon Crest, Mission Grove and Riverside Plaza each have restaurants which are worth visiting.

Drink[edit]
There are a few night clubs around the city.

Riverside is about an hour's drive away from the ocean, the mountains, and the desert. The Los Angeles County and Orange County beaches are accessible on the 60 and 91 freeways, respectively, with modest day use fees. Taking the 91 north to the I-215, then following signs for CA-30 and mountain resorts, will have you in the San Bernardino mountains in no time. Big Bear and its surroundings are a winter playground unparalleled in much of the Southwest. For summer fun, continue up the I-215 all the way until it hits CA-138, head west, and then turn left at CA-2 to go up into the Angeles National Forest. Multitudes of picnic areas and campgrounds dot this winding road between the high desert and Los Angeles. If you turn east at CA-138, you'll run into Silverwood Lake, a large reservoir with swimming and boating facilities.
