Caledon is a town of 76,600 people (2021), large in size and mostly rural, in the Peel region of the Greater Toronto Area of Ontario.  The Niagara Escarpment and the Credit River run through the town, and there are many areas of natural beauty. Within Caledon is found the village of Bolton, whose historic centre stretches a few blocks on King Road and Queen Street. The village of Belfountain is quite pretty, with older-style wood buildings all around.


Understand[edit]
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park
Caledon is the rural, northern part of Peel Region, consisting of an amalgamation of small urban areas, villages, and hamlets. Its major suburban centre is Bolton on its eastern side adjacent to York Region. These areas were settled in the early 1800s to take advantage of the area's two rivers (The Credit and the Humber) and fertile farming land. Today, while Bolton experiences some development pressure similar to the newer parts of Brampton, most of the land in Caledon is protected as either provincial greenbelt, conservation land, parkland, river valley or escarpment, and so it maintains much of the same character as it did a century ago - rolling countryside, with farms, fields, small waterfalls, and tiny villages. 

History[edit]
By 1869, Belfountain was a village with a population of 100 in the Township of Caledon County Peel. It was established on the Credit River. There were stagecoaches to Erin and Georgetown.
Caledon was likely named by settlers who came from the area around Caledon, County Tyrone in Northern Ireland.
