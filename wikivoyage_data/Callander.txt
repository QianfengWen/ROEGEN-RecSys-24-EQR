Callander is a small town in Stirlingshire in the Central Belt of Scotland. Tourist publicity calls it "The Gateway to the Highlands" and for once that over-used term is correct: the town sits right on the lowland-highland fault line, with crags looming just north of town, and streams racing out of the mountains to form the River Teith. Gaelic was spoken here until about 1900. The main reason to come is to see The Trossachs, the eastern part of Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park.
Callander had a population of 3080 in 2020. To older visitors, it will always be "Tannochbrae": it was the location for the 1962-71 BBC series Dr Finlay's Casebook, with the theme music dancing over the view of the River Teith bridge.
Visit Callander  is the tourist office, mid-town at 55 Main St, open daily 9:30AM-4PM.


Get in[edit]
Inchmahome Priory
By car: the usual approach is M9 past Stirling, exit at Jcn 10 for A84 west through Doune.
By bus: First Scotland East Bus 59 runs from Stirling hourly M-Sa (every 2 hours Su) via Blair Drummond and Doune to Callander, taking 45 min. 
Bus 978 runs daily from Edinburgh, taking just under two hours via the airport, Grangemouth, Stirling and Doune. It continues to Crianlarich, Tyndrum, Dalmally, Taynuilt and Oban. 
On the first and third Saturday of the month, two buses 160 & S60 run between Stirling, Callander, Crianlarich and Tyndrum.
By train: the railway closed in 1965, so get off at Stirling and take Bus 59. Dunblane station is closer if you have a bike, but there's no onward public transport. Some of the torn-up track was recycled into the transit system for Mexico City's 1968 Summer Olympics. 
By bike: Callander is on National Cycle Network Route 7 Glasgow-Inverness. The cycle track northbound follows the disused railway towards Kilmahog and Strathyre.

Get around[edit]

You need a car or bike to reach the Trossachs or Lake of Menteith.
As of Dec 2022, no taxi firm operates here. You probably have to hire from Dunblane or Stirling.

See[edit]
56.249346-4.1880561 Bracklinn Falls  are where the Keltie Water tumbles over the Highland Boundary Fault: Breac Linn is Gaelic for "speckled pool". A circular walk from the village is 3 miles, but in 2022 the bridge has again been damaged so you have to come back the same way.
56.243-4.21162 Hamilton Toy Museum, 111 Main St FK17 8BQ, ☏ +44 1877 330004. Apr-Oct: M-Sa 10:30AM-5PM, Su noon-5PM. 5-room museum of traditional children's toys (cars, model soldiers, dolls, etc.) and shop. Adult £3, child £1. (updated Dec 2022)
56.1821-4.28523 Lake of Menteith, Port of Menteith FK8 3RA (five miles south of Callander), ☏ +44 1877 385294. Priory closed. This is one of the few bodies of water in Scotland called a "lake" rather than a "loch." (By no means the only one, in spite of the tourist office blurb.) The name is probably a 16th century map-maker's misreading of laich meaning "low place". A little ferry boat takes you to the island with the ruins of Inchmahome Priory. Built in the 13th century, its royal visitors included the 4-year old Mary Queen of Scots, hidden away here after the Scots' defeat in battle in 1547. In 2022 the island is closed for masonry repairs.  (updated Dec 2022)
 The Trossachs are the main reason to come here: follow A84 then A821 west. It's a longer drive to reach the shores of Loch Lomond, either via Drymen to Balmaha, or via Aberfoyle east on B829 to Inversnaid.
Do[edit]
Climb Ben Ledi 4 miles west above Kilmahog. It's 879 m (2884 ft) high, so it's a Corbett. Just south of Loch Lubnaig, turn off A84 onto the track signed "Strathyre Forest Cabins" to reach the car park (which fills up on fine summer weekends). The path is obvious enough. Near the top are two grassy false summits; the rocky true summit is marked by a cross for Sgt Harry Lawrie of the Mountain Rescue Team, killed nearby in a helicopter crash in 1987.
