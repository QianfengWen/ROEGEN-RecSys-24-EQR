Manado is the largest and capital city in, and main gateway to Northern Sulawesi (Sulawesi Utara), Indonesia.


Understand[edit]
Bird's eye view of Manado and the bay.
The capital of the province, the former stronghold of the Dutch (called Menado during Dutch colonial times), and the cultural centre of the Minahasa people, for a long time Manado prospered through trade with the nearby Philippines, and the spice trade with the rest of the world. Alas, the bombings of World War II, and the suppression of a local insurgency in the 1950s flattened most of Manado's older buildings. While by Indonesian standards still relatively prosperous, most visitors will be rather less impressed and head straight to the islands and reefs of nearby Bunaken. Unlike much of the rest of predominantly-Muslim Indonesia, Protestant Christianity is the dominant religion in Manado.

Weather[edit]
Mostly sunny throughout the year, the wet season usually starts from September until March or April.  During its hottest days, it can reach up to 32 degrees Celsius (90 degrees Fahrenheit). In the highlands of Tomohon, Tondano, Kawangkoan, it is cooler but sunny nonetheless.

Get in[edit]
Manado is quite far from the rest of Indonesia, and most visitors arrive by plane.

The main ways of getting around are ojek/ompreng, moped taxis that can be a bit scary, or with Mikrolets (mikros), the blue minibuses that you jump on just standing by the street.  They all have a certain route, and within a day one should figure out how it works.

Angkot is a minibus of 8-10 passengers.  The cost is charged on per trip basis, which is Rp 4,000 (as of October 2018).
Compared to angkots in other cities in Indonesia that have side-facing seats, the ones in Manado are fitted with all front-facing seats.  Manadonese are known for being picky, and would only take the good-looking and full music angkots.

By transportation-sharing app[edit]

Eat[edit]
A yummy-looking bowl of tinutuan (it doesn't taste that bad, honest)
Manadonese food is famous throughout Indonesia for two things: the Minahasa eat absolutely anything, and the flavour of choice is very spicy.  Sugar is used little if at all, with flavour added through lemon and herbs.  Being Christian, the Minahasa also often marinate meat in alcohol and favour pork.  More exotic protein options include cats, forest rats, fruit bats, and dogs, the last of which is the obligatory centrepiece of any wedding ceremony or Christmas feast.  Classic dishes include:

ikan mas bakar rica, grilled spicy fish cooked in traditional style, using a piece of coconut shell as a way of cooking. Grilled together with chilli, that poured in the fish while cooking.
ikan mas goreng, fish fried till the soft bone is crunchy.
ayam rica-rica, grilled chicken topped with a fiery red chilli-and-onion paste
ikan mas woku balanga, fish simmered in herbs
babi tore, fried pork until crunched with a lot of chilli
perkedel milu, corn fritters
tinutuan (or bubur manado), a goopy porridge of rice, pumpkin, noodles and random vegetables; doesn't look very attractive, but it can be tasty and, for once, not spicy.
miedal, very similar to tinutuan (same sauce), but using noodles instead of rice.
biapong, a Chinese-style bun dumpling, what is called 'bao' in Chinese, is called biapong here.  Different fillings are available.
Dutch settlement here has also brought in a few surprising influences, notably:

brenebon (bruine bonesoep), a rich red kidney bean soup, comes in two versions, savoury (as a side dish) and sweet (for desserts).
klappertaart, a western-style coconut cake.
