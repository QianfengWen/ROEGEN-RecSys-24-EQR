Daman is a district of the union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu. It is on the west coast of India, next to the state of Gujarat, which is perhaps a more well-known tourist destination. It was under the control of Portugal from 1539 to 1961 - and as a result of this, Portuguese influence is still palpable today, particularly in the architectural and cultural spheres.
It may not have all the facilities that a tourist destination should have but it does have peace, relaxation, friendly locals and beautiful places to see. Local resorts and hotels are easily available and can be easily booked from Gujarat.


Understand[edit]
Portuguese established themselves in Goa in 16th century. For trade, they expanded their trade in Gujarat and established themselves in Daman. In 1531, the Sultan of Gujarat agreed to hand over Daman to Portuguese in exchange of a share in revenues. The port expanded and proved more important that Diu to Portuguese in terms of trade. It competed with Surat. The Daman became part of the Union of India only in 1961. The long history with Portuguese left lasting impression on the city.
Daman has a beautiful landscape and, partly due to being relatively close to Mumbai and some of the other majors cities of Gujarat and Maharashtra, it experiences a lot of tourist traffic every year. The city is worth of day's trip. It is also popular drinking enclave for locals from surrounding districts.
