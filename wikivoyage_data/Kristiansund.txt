Not to be confused with Kristiansand in Southern Norway, the difference is one letter, spelled with an a instead of u. 
Kristiansund is a city and municipality on the mid-western coast of Norway, in Møre og Romsdal county. It has among the most special and interesting architecture of Norway, which originates from the aftermath of World War II, when nearly 80% of the city was demolished by bombs. It sits on five islands slightly off the shore of mainland Norway. The natural harbour formed by the islands is considered to be unique and particularly beautiful, protecting the city centre from winds and weather outside in the Atlantic Ocean. The city is sometimes called Kristiansund N, where N stands for North, to distinguish it from Kristiansand in southern Norway, a name introduced by the postal service.

The Atlantic Road A unique stretch of road which takes you right out to the ocean’s edge. In 2005, the road was voted Norway’s "Engineering Feat of the Century", and is also known to be the world's most beautiful drive. It connects Averøy with the mainland via a series of small islands and islets spanned by a total of eight bridges over 8274 m. The road was opened in 1989 and is toll-free.
The Atlantic Road has National Tourist Route status and the entire stretch between Bud and Kristiansund is one continuous experience packed with coastal scenery, culture and history. The contrasts between a trip on a sun-soaked and tranquil summer day and a foam-sprayed journey in a storm from the northwest are amazing. Take your time and open all of your senses. The Atlantic Road experience will give you memories for life. Park your car at designated stopping places, climb a hillock and enjoy the salty air and the magnificent view. Whether the ocean is flat calm or a storm is brewing; there are great nature experiences in store.

Aure is a typical coastal municipality of Møre og Romsdal with many beautiful small islands. Most people live near the shore. Aure merged with Tustna in 2006 and the new municipality is called Aure. Population 3 600.

Great hunting for red deer in the large forest and mountain areas. Excellent fishing for freshwater trout and sea trout. The scenery on Tustna is dominated by the coastal mountains. These over 900-metre-tall mountains, which rise straight up from the shore, form a chain in a north-south direction. Great walking, with several paths ascending to the summits, which offer fantastic views of the ocean and the fjords.

Grip is an archipelago southwest of Kristiansund, and was until 1964 the smallest municipality of Norway.
