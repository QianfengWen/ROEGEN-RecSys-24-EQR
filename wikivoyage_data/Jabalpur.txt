Jabalpur is a major city in Madhya Pradesh. Jabalpur is an ancient city in central India on the shores of the holy river Narmada and on the tributary plains of the Hiran, Gour, Ken and Sone rivers. This article also covers the small neighbouring villages of Bagri and Dumna.


Understand[edit]
Boat ride through Marble Rocks
The Narmada River valley is famous for its Marble Rocks, a unique formation where the whole river flows for nearly 2 kilometers between varied coloured and tinted marble rocks with a deep water fall.
Pleasure resort and capital of the Gond Kings during the 12th century, Jabalpur was later the seat of the Kalchuri dynasty. The Marathas held sway over Jabalpur until 1817, when the British wrested it from them and left their impression on the spacious cantonment with its colonial residences and barracks. Today Jabalpur is an important administrative, industrial and business center of MP and India. Population wise ranks 27th in the country.
Jabalpur is an industrial city with a large component of defence industry and a lot of smaller cottage industry. It is a great education centre as well, with two universities, Rani Durgavati University and Jawaharlal Nehru Agricultural University, and with about 30 colleges with a range of faculties. It also has several engineering and medical colleges.
Vinoba Bhave, the modern saint philosopher of India, christened this city as Sanskar Dhani- the capital of various cultural influences. He was impressed by its cosmopolitan character and communal harmony. The city has a sizeable population of people from Bengal, Gujarat, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and South India who live in total harmony and peace and add richness to the life in the city. One can also see the fusion of cultures in this city. The culture here is also reminiscent of British and Gond Tribes, which is now shaped by local businessman and engineers and doctors. Similar to some Mexican cities, families are very close-knit and often get together for ceremonies and festivals.
The best time to visit is September to March. Summers should be avoided. Rains are beautiful too if you live in a better location (July to September).

City life[edit]
The people in this city are very artistic and culture-oriented. It is considered very friendly to sing songs for no reason at all. Unlike other cities in India, most educated people here are only good with Hindi and local variants of the language. English speaking population is generally employed in government institutes and their English could be old Shakespearean. Hence this city is the perfect place to dip into the central culture of India. People here generally listen to local radio as a part of their life. 
You can eat pizza with youngsters at Domino's. However most people are likely not to eat it regularly as it is very unhealthy. 
City life is very moderate and relaxed. Most of the residents will wake up early and go for work and come back in evening to have a hearty dinner with family.

Talk[edit]
The native language of the Jabalpur area is Hindi, which also happens to be the main official language of the Union Government. Almost everybody in Jabalpur speaks Hindi, maybe with different accents. Educated people speak English and taxi and auto drivers, shopkeepers and other men attached to the tourism industry speak and understand functional English. Road signage is usually in English and Hindi, though some signage is in Hindi only.

Soaring in glittering splendour, the marble rocks at Bhedaghat rise to a hundred feet on either side of the Narmada. The serene loveliness of the scene is one of cool quiet, the sunlight sparkling on the marble-white pinnacles and casting dappled shadows on the pellucid waters. Sunlight, now glancing from a pinnacle of snow-white marble reared against the deep blue of the sky as from a point of silver ; touching here and there with bright lights the prominences of the middle heights; and again losing itself in the soft bluish grays of their recesses. Here and there the white saccharine limestone is seamed by veins of dark green or black volcanic rock; a contrast which only enhances, like a setting of jet, the purity of the surrounding marble.The Marble Rocks are best explored by boat. There are shared (₹100 per head) and charted boat (₹800 for a six-seater boat. services. The boatman doubles up as a guide narrating the story in Hindi, in a poetic and comical way.
