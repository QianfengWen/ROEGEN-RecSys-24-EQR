Venice is a city in Sarasota County, in Southwest Florida. It was voted as one of the top ten Happiest Seaside Towns by Coastal Living.


Understand[edit]
Venice Avenue
With a population of 20,000, Venice is known for its large "snowbird" population. Snowbirds are older people who spend their winters in Florida to escape the cold winters in Northern states including New York and Pennsylvania.
The city was incorporated in 1927 and has since become the location of several structures and areas on the National Register of Historic Places. It's also known for the Venice Theatre, the largest per-capita community theater in the United States with an operating budget of almost three million dollars, and its reputation as the "Shark's Tooth Capital of the World" due to the annual Shark's Tooth Festival.
