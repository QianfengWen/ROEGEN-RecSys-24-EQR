Adams is a small town in the Berkshires region of Massachusetts. It features the summit of Mt. Greylock, the highest point in Massachusetts at 3,491 ft (1064 m), which is on the Appalachian Trail.


Get in[edit]
Map of Adams (Massachusetts)
Adams is on State Route 8. State Route 8 can be accessed from Dalton Avenue in northeast Pittsfield, from which you need to drive north to reach Adams.

Get around[edit]
The downtown area is small, but if you are anywhere outside that immediate area, it is best to have at least a bicycle to get around. Route 8 is not pleasant to walk on, while the cars speed past you.
Most non-hikers will probably prefer to drive to the summit of Mt. Greylock, though it is also possible to cycle up the winding roads.
