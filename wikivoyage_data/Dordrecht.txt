Dordrecht is a historic city in South Holland, Netherlands that was, at the end of the Middle Ages, one of the six important trade cities of the County of Holland. Its centre still shows off the rich history of the city.


Understand[edit]
Dordrecht is a really old city that grew wealthy on its position at a river confluence with important commercial, military and private boat building. It held significant regional and international importance, hosting the 'Synod of Dordrecht' and other important religious meetings.
Thankfully, it escaped much of the widespread destruction of the Second World War. Consequently, it is brimming with interesting old architecture and displays an old-time sense of wealth that belies the peaceful and laid-back character of its modern-day economic relaxation. The locals are educated and generally proud of their city, which is the sort of place to wander around and explore leisurely, rather than rushing in and out.

Get in[edit]
51°48′57″N 4°39′49″EMap of Dordrecht


By rail[edit]
51.80754.6677781 Dordrecht railway station. A direct rail service from Rotterdam Centraal and Rotterdam Blaak takes about 15 minutes. There is a direct service from Amsterdam Centraal via The Hague and Rotterdam Centraal with the terminus in Dordrecht. There is also a direct service from Gorinchem, Roosendaal and Breda.   (updated Mar 2024)
By boat[edit]
There is a fast ferry (waterbus) from Rotterdam, which is part of the public transport system and costs the same as the train.

By car[edit]
Two important highways go to and through Dordrecht. A16 from Rotterdam to Belgium border and N3 from Papendrecht to the A16 in Dordrecht.

Get around[edit]
While the city is small enough to walk around, if you are in a hurry or have a lot of bags, consider the frequent buses which serve the city and nearby areas. Also, bicycles can be rented from a bike shop next to the train station (€50 deposit).
Qbuzz has timetables and maps of buses in the region.

See[edit]
Park Merwestein in 1901, with the original villa still standing.
There are nearly 900 listed buildings in the city. There are also a few other museums about town, plus some interesting shops, parks, an old windmill, and a few boat harbours (havens in Dutch). There's a huge supply of ancient architecture which you will see everywhere with years and Dutch language explanations. (If interested in specifics, get a local to translate for you.)

Highlights[edit]
51.8141674.661 Grote Kerk (Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk), Lange Geldersekade 2. Apr-Oct Tu-Sa 10:30-16:30, Su 12:00-16:00; Nov-Dec: Tu Th Sa 14:00-16:00. A church in the Brabantine Gothic style with an unfinished tower. Also known as the Onze-Lieve-Vrouwe-Kerk ('Our Dear Lady Church') or the Grote Kerk ('Great Church') was built between 1285 and 1470. The 65-m tower contains a carillon with 67 bells including one weighing 9.83 tonnes, making it the heaviest bell in the Netherlands. Be sure you're in shape to climb the tower and not afraid of close spaces. The steps are steep and there is only one way up, or down. You can see the medieval clock in operation. In the church, see the brilliant stained glass windows and especially the modern window dedicated to the guilds of Dordrecht. Church: Admission to church and tower: €4.   (updated Jul 2023)
51.8163694.6665292 Grote Markt, Northeastern end of Varkenmarkt. The larger synagogue of the city used to stand here, which presumably formed the centre of the local Jewish population (apparently over 300 people prior to the war), but it was heavily damaged by the Nazis, sold in 1947 and razed in 1965. Nothing remains except new buildings, which are out of character from the surrounding old architecture.

51.815564.669445 Augustijnenkerk (Church of the Augustins). Built around 1293, it is owned by the Dutch Reformed Church. The church was part of the Augustinian Monastery Het Hof (see above).  (updated Jun 2016)

Parks[edit]
51.81194.6780417 Park Merwestein (Merwesteinpark). 19th-century park in which a building stood until its eventual destruction by Allied bombardment in 1944. The bombing was due to the Nazis developing a significant bunker system throughout the park (apparently using Jewish slaves) which they then used as an important regional military communications hub during the war. Many local citizens lost their lives in the bombing, which also killed children when an adjacent school was accidentally bombed. This history can be explored in more detail at the 1944-1945 museum: nothing of significance is displayed in the park, which today features many large trees, some sculptures (including a tall column at the former location of the building pictured), a children's play area, significant stock of waterbirds, and a reindeer enclosure.  (updated Feb 2020)
51.8134774.69522818 Wantijpark. Park and summertime music venue slightly out of town. Worth a wander.

The Dordtse Biesbosch has several recreational areas that are used for walking, rowing and swimming.

Buy[edit]
Shopping in the centre of Dordrecht is centred around the Voorstraat, the Sarisgang and the Statenplein (Staten Square). The Voorstraat is 1,200 m (3,900 ft) long, making it the longest shopping street in the Netherlands. Markets are held every Friday and Saturday on the Statenplein and in the Sarisgang and on Tuesday in the Dubbeldam quarter.

Eat[edit]
You can find a lot of foreign food, albeit with varying levels of authenticity, spread about the town: Chinese, Greek, Italian, Macedonian, Thai, Turkish and Vietnamese, at least.

Many nice restaurants are around the Statenplein and outdoor tables abound in good weather.
Scheffersplein off Wijnstraat (Wine Street) is also ringed with many restaurants and outdoor tables.

Drink[edit]
Other than a range of restaurants serving alcohol, and a few other bars apparently chiefly peopled by older local alcoholics, nightlife seems to be mainly centered around the Scheffersplein bridge/square.

 The Hide Away. A charismatic bar run by a Dutch/Scottish traveller couple with a dedicated band of regular customers. Stylistically informed by the British Isles, the proprietors wish the location to remain unpublished. (updated Mar 2024)
Sleep[edit]
In town[edit]
There is a relative shortage of hotels in the city. Judging from old maps of the town, there used to be more, but they have faded with the regional economy.
There are no real budget options in Dordrecht proper. There are two bed and breakfasts near the central bridge over the harbour behind the big church that is potentially cheaper than the hotels. One reported budget option, unconfirmed, is a Luthier's shop around the corner to the southeast of the Bellevue Hotel.

 [formerly dead link] Innercity Hotel, Johan de Wittstraat 35-37 (Walk a few hundred metres down the road that runs from directly outside the train station, and it's on the left.), ☏ +31 78 611-9933, info@innercityhotel.nl. Modern. The biggest drawback of this hotel is relative expense and lack of audio privacy. With only 17 rooms, the architects evidently decided to "pack 'em in", and it shows. Still, probably the best option for those minding the budget a little bit but unwilling to sleep out of town. All floors are lift-accessible. Free Wi-Fi. €100 (single room). 
 Villa Augustus, Oranjelaan, ☏ +31 78 639 3111, info@villa-augustus.nl. Slightly outside of town, this designer hotel is something of an icon for the city. A sort of walled garden complex with a thoroughly post-modern castle tower, visitors are rewarded with views, an excellent garden restaurant, and a quaint theme of dancing rabbits presumably inspired by the neighbouring Energiehaus theatre. Accessible by city bus. From €165/night. 
Outside town[edit]
51.8103194.7513541 Stayokay Dordrecht, Baanhoekweg 25 (Located at the edge of the national park 'De Hollandse Biesbosch'), ☏ +31 78 621 2167. Better than standard hostel fare. Clean and modern. Conexxion bus 4 from the central station. About 8 km (5.0 mi). From €20 a night in a dorm room. 
51.8086754.7203052 Natuurvriendenhuis De Kleine Rug (NIVON huis De kleine rug), Loswalweg 1, 3315 LB, Dordrecht (from railway station Dordrecht Stadhouderspolder 10min walk.  Navigate to Loswalweg 3, 3315 LB, Dordrecht and then phone the house; a boat will come and get you.), ☏ +3188 0990962, kleinerug@nivon.nl. Check-in: 14:00, check-out: 11:00. The house provides a bed living room, kitchen where you can cook and outdoor space. NIVON houses are run by volunteers. Nivon is part of Friends of Nature (international abbreviation: NFI, for German: Naturfreunde International) an international movement with a background in the social democratic movement, which aims to make the enjoyment of nature accessible to the wider community by providing appropriate recreational and travel facilities. €28.70 a night for non members and €19.10 for members. Sheets are €6 and a towel €1.50. (updated Aug 2021)
