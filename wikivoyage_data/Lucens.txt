Lucens is a city in the Jura region of Western Switzerland. It has its place in Swiss history as the location of an experimental nuclear reactor which was destroyed in a partial meltdown in 1969, Switzerland's most serious nuclear accident to date. The site was however underground and no radiation has escaped, so it's a perfectly safe place to visit.
