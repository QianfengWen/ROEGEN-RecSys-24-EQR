-7.32110.0241 Posong, Jl Parakan-Wonosobo Km 09, Tlahab village, Kledung district, (Off the north side of the Kledung Pass between Sindoro and Sumbing volcanoes). This is a viewpoint on the southern slopes of Mount Sumbing, facing south. In clear weather, it should be possible to see across a good swathe of Central Java - Mount Slamet in the west, past Mount Sumbing, the twin peaks of Merapi and Merbabu to the southeast, and Ungaran to the northeast. If lucky, maybe across to Mount Lawu on the border with East Java. Getting up early to be there for the sunrise will probably be the safest bet for a clear view. (updated Nov 2017)
