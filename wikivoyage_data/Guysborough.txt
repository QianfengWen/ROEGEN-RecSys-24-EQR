Understand[edit]
Guysborough Harbour
The community is named after Sir Guy Carleton (Guy's borough).

History[edit]
The Mi'kmaq (Aboriginal) name for the village of Guysborough was Chedabuctou.
The village of Guysborough was settled by Europeans in 1634. Isaac de Razilly built a fort named Fort St François à Canso at the entrance to the harbour. In 1655, Nicolas Denys, governor of the new St Lawrence Bay Province, built Fort Chedabuctou on Fort Point to serve as his capital. The fort was replaced and renamed Fort St Louis in 1682 by the Company of Acadia to protect the fishery.
In 1682, a permanent settlement was started by Clerbaud Bergier. A group cleared land and planted crops in 1683. The Acadians in this region left in the Acadian Exodus of 1749–1755,cand those that remained were expelled by the British.

St Ann's Catholic Church
British settlers renamed the town Guysborough after Sir Guy Carleton, commander of the British forces and Governor General of Canada in the 1780s. After the American Revolution, Guysborough was settled by Black Loyalists and soldiers of the disbanded Duke of Cumberland's Regiment and King's Carolina Rangers.
The town's fine natural harbour led to its establishment as the administrative centre for the county, and despite the diminishing role of the harbour for transport links, forestry, fishing and agriculture remain of great importance to the area.

The building’s simple classic style and prominent site were chosen to reinforce its importance as the centre for justice and “to express the dignity and solemnity appropriate for the courts of law.” Numerous artefacts provide a glimpse of how people lived and made a living in the past. The museum has a large quantity of tools and handcrafts collected from the Acadian and Black settlements in the area and other items on exhibit that emphasize Guysborough County’s long marine, agricultural and lumbering history. Highlights include a diorama of the three French forts built on nearby Fort Point peninsula between 1634 and 1684, small exhibits of local historical interest and displays of photographs and maps of early Guysborough.
