Chestermere is a city of about 20,000 people (2016) in the Calgary Region. It is largely a commuter town of Calgary and surrounds Chestermere Lake, a small reservoir that was constructed for irrigation and now used for recreation.


Understand[edit]
Map of Chestermere
Chestermere Lake was established in 1907 when a dam and canal system was built on a natural wetland as an irrigation reservoir for area settlers. Following the irrigation development, the lake began to be used for recreation with people building cabins and staying along the lake during the summer months, with a slow increase of permanent residents. In 1992, Chestermere was incorporated as a town just over 1000 permanent residents, but by 2014 the population has grown to 17,200, and was incorporated into a city the following year.
