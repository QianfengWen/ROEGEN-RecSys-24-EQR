Bethany Beach is served by Delaware Route 1 and Delaware Route 26. Delaware Route 1 (Coastal Highway) heads north along the coast to Dewey Beach, Rehoboth Beach, and Lewes and south along the coast to Fenwick Island and Ocean City, Maryland. Delaware Route 26 (Garfield Highway) provides access to Bethany Beach from inland points to the west.
From northern Delaware, follow Delaware Route 1 south to Milford and take the exit to U.S. Route 113 south. Follow U.S. Route 113 south and turn left onto Delaware Route 20 east in Dagsboro.

While you may use Delaware Route 1 south all the way to Bethany Beach, there is a lot of traffic lights and congestion in the Rehoboth Beach area, and therefore using U.S. Route 113 bypasses a lot of the congestion.

Continue along Maryland Route 404 east to the Delaware border, where the road becomes Delaware Route 404. Follow Delaware Route 404 east to Georgetown and turn right onto U.S. Route 113 south. Follow U.S. Route 113 south and turn left onto Delaware Route 20 east in Dagsboro. Delaware Route 20 leads into Delaware Route 26 east, which heads into Bethany Beach.

Bethany Beach is generally fairly safe, but there are a few things to keep in mind. Rip currents sometimes occur in the water. Make sure to stay in view of lifeguards, and if you're caught in a rip current, swim following the curve of the shoreline rather than tiring yourself out fighting to get back to shore immediately. Sharks are occasionally spotted off the coast, but attacks are very rare.
