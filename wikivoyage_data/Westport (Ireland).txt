Westport is an attractive town in County Mayo on the west coast of Ireland, with a population of 6198 in 2016. It was originally Cathair na Mart, "town of the beef cattle", a cattle-mart and trading port in an era when it was much easier to get around by sea than overland. That settlement was swept aside in 1780 to make way for Westport House and its grounds. A new planned town was laid out along the banks of the Carrowbeg River, and has been well-preserved since that time.  
The town has grown into a tourist resort - the TIC is on Bridge St. Westport is the main base for exploring southwest Mayo and the islands of Clew Bay (141 of them at the latest count). Their attractions are therefore described on this page. The area is mobbed on "Reek Sunday" at the end of July, when thousands of pilgrims ascend the mountain of Croagh Patrick. 


Get in[edit]
Matt Molloy's pub
Knock (NOC IATA) is the nearest airport but has few flights, see below for the occasional Bus 440. Consider flying into Dublin or Shannon then hiring a car, which you're going to need to tour the county.
Trains from Dublin Heuston take about 3 hr 30 min to Westport. On the morning service you usually take the train for Galway and change at Athlone, later in the day three direct trains run via Portarlington, Tullamore, Clara, Athlone, Roscommon, Castlerea, Ballyhaunis, Claremorris, Manulla Junction and Castlebar. A walk-up single from Dublin is €23, see Irish Rail for timetables, fares and online tickets. 
There are also three connections per day between Westport and  Ballina, changing at Manulla Junction for a journey of around an hour.
The 53.796-9.511 railway station is 500 m southwest of town on R330 Altamount St. Ticket office hours are erratic but there are ticket machines and toilets. 
There is no direct bus from Dublin. Bus 456 runs five times a day from Galway, inland via Headford, Shrule and Ballinrobe, taking 1 hr 40 min to Westport and continuing to Castlebar. There isn't a bus station in Westport, the main bus stop is on Mill St.

Walk in town: from the centre to the Point of the Quay is 2 km. But you need wheels for most outlying sights.
Bus 450 follows the coast, from Dooagh near the west tip of Achill island, via Doogort and Achill Sound to the mainland, then Mulrany, Newport and Westport, then onward to Murrisk and Louisburgh; it doesn't continue to Roonagh pier. It runs M-Sa every 2-3 hours, with only three on Sunday.
Westport Bike Hire on James St is open daily 09:00-18:00.
Ferries to Clare Island sail from Roonagh 7 km west of Louisburgh. They sail daily year-round, and frequently in summer. The crossing takes 25 min, foot passengers only, adult return €17 return. The operators are O'Malley Ferries, and Clare Island (aka O'Grady's) Ferry who have a bus connection from Westport for their first and last sailing. You must book this the day before on +353 98 23737 or +353 87 900 4115.

See[edit]
53.8006-9.53551 Westport House, Quay Rd, ☏ +353 98 27766, info@westporthouse.ie. Apr-Sept. This fine Georgian mansion was designed by Richard Cassels and James Wyatt in the 18th century, It's set in parkland overlooking Clew Bay. It also contains a pirate-theme play park, separately ticketed. Adult House €13, theme park €25. (updated Feb 2021)
Clew Bay Heritage Centre is a tiny museum on Roman Island, open Mar-Oct, in a building once used for holding live pigs before transport. The island, now a promontory of the Quay, was a busy industrial port during the boom years, but now has forlorn industrial remnants. The Point of the promontory is a good spot for seeing birdlife and otters.
Clew Bay is a beautiful bay dotted with small islands - there are 141 named islands and outcrops, which you see more of further north towards Newport. They're drumlins, mounds of gravel deposited by glaciers. (There's a swathe of them right across Ireland where the last glaciation halted: on land, eg in County Cavan, they create a "basket-of-eggs" landscape.) Most are uninhabited, several have private dwellings; boat trips go out from Westport harbour. To view from the mainland either take the south shore road towards Louisburgh and Roonagh, or the north shore road towards Achill Island.
53.78-9.6392 Murrisk is a village 8 km west of Westport. It's at the foot of the trail up Croagh Patrick, with a large car park for walkers. A spectral sculpture evokes the "famine ships" of the 1840s. The Augustinian abbey, founded 1457, is a scrappy ruin on the shore.
53.76-9.6583 Croagh Patrick is a peak of 764m / 2507 ft, rising abruptly from a U-shaped glaciated valley. Croagh means "stack" and it's a place of pilgrimage, as in legend St Patrick fasted for forty days on the summit in 441 AD, and from there sent greetings to the newly appointed Pope Leo I. Certainly there's been a chapel dubbed "Teampall Phádraig" at the summit since that century; there may have been pagan rites before then. The present summit chapel was built in 1905. The path from Murrisk is a well-worn 7 km trail up steep scree, reckon 2 hr 30 min up and 90 min back. On the last Sunday in July, Reek Sunday, some 15-30,000 pilgrims climb the peak, at a genteel pace as they're led by the Archbishop of Tuam, he always knew that long crook stick would come in handy. Some pilgrims begin as far away as Balintubber Abbey, following a 30 km trail, and may come barefoot. At least they don't risk snakebite as it's from this mountain that St Patrick is supposed to have banished snakes from Ireland when they slithered across his devotions. (He picked a good country to banish them from, as post-glacial Ireland never did have snakes.) Gold was discovered in the mountain in the 1980s, in commercially workable veins, but mining was not permitted.
Grace O'Malley meets Queen Elizabeth I
53.762-9.8094 Louisburgh, 20 km west of Westport, has long sandy beaches and B&Bs. It's a planned town, built in 1795 by the Marquess of Sligo to house Catholics fleeing sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland, and named for the Battle of Louisburg on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia. The Grace O'Malley Museum is occasionally open. Just south of the village, turn off R378 to Roonagh pier, for ferries to Clare Island and Inishturk. Or follow R335 into the hills, a scenic route to Delphi and Leenane.
And see Leenane for the south end of the county, such as Delphi Valley. Mweelrea however is easier to reach by the coast lane south of Louisburgh.
53.808-9.9875 Clare Island at the entrance to Clew Bay is some 5 km long by 3 km wide. It's inhabited and reached by ferry from Roonagh, see Get Around. The medieval tower house, now just a teetering shell, was the abode of Grace or Gráinne O'Malley (1530-1603), mythologised as a "Pirate Queen". (That just meant she was an independent landowner beyond London authority, and got around by sea - imagine the roads in Mayo in the 16th century? When she visited Queen Elizabeth I, she was richly gowned, and they conversed in Latin.) She's probably among the many O'Malleys buried at the island's abbey, St Brigid's, built 12th / 13th century. It's Cistercian and has ceiling and wall paintings. The lighthouse on the north tip of the island is now a guesthouse, and there's also a hostel, and self-catering by the landing pier.
53.704-10.1146 Inishturk: beware, there are three hereabouts. This one is inhabited and is reached by ferry from Roonagh, or less often from Cleggan. There's an Napoleon-era signal tower, accommodation, and a lane which soon circles you back to your starting point. Inis Toirc means "wild boar island": Inishturk Beg is a privately-owned islet in Clew Bay, while Inishturk South is uninhabited and is just off the Galway coast near Clifden.
53.722-10.0237 Caher Island near Inishturk is uninhabited and doesn't have a ferry service. Boat trips sometimes visit for the ancient monastery, and there's a pilgrimage on 15 Aug, the Feast of the Assumption.
53.618-10.2138 Inishbofin Island seen to the southwest is in County Galway and is reached by ferry from Cleggan northwest of Clifden. It was historically in County Mayo, but re-assigned to Galway in the famine years the better to organise relief. A place too poor to be in Mayo, imagine.
