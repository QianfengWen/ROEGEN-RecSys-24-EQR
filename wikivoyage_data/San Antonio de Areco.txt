Founded in 1730, the town is proud of its gaucho (Argentine cowboy) tradition, and visitors can explore the surrounding villages and ranches. It was declared "The National Capital of Tradition" on January 29th, 2015.
The origin of the name of the city has two versions, some historians say that it takes its name from a soldier, named Areco, who fought against the aboriginal people on those shores. The version of a local historian affirms that the name of that river is due to the fact that on its shores grew the "areca", which was a kind of palm tree.

Important dates[edit]
Tradition and history joined in this site, and Tradition Day was established in 1939. Nowadays this day is celebrated on November 10th, date of birth of the Argentinian poet José Hernández.

The folkloric events are the reason for meetings at any place and time of the year.
