Cimei (七美 Qīměi in Mandarin, Chhit-bí in Minnan; also rendered as Qimei) is a rural township in the Penghu Islands of Taiwan.


Understand[edit]
Archaeological evidence of prehistoric cultures dating back 4500 years before present was found in Nangang Village in 1983. The island was named "Cimei" in 1949 to commemorate a legend (七美人塚) from the Ming dynasty in which seven women committed suicide when pirates raided the island. The name also connotes seven beautiful things as the island's tourist attractions: the scenery, the seawater, local products, people's hearts, the geology, the architecture, and the history.
