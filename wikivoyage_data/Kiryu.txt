Understand[edit]
Fine old wooden house in Kiryu
Kiryū lies about 90 km northwest of Tokyo (as the crow flies), and just across the Tochigi prefectural boundary from Ashikaga. During the Edo Era, Kiryū was known for its fine silks, an eastern match for Kyoto in western Japan. The lord of Kiryū supplied over 2,400 silk banners for the troops of Tokugawa Ieyasu in the battle of Sekigahara in 1600, and thereafter continued to pay the same tribute to the victorious Tokugawa Shogunate every year. It later became an important center for textile manufacturing during Japan's industrial revolution, and now is a manufacturing center for automotive parts and pachinko machines.
Kiryū's international sister cities are also textile and manufacturing towns: Biella, Piemonte, Italy, and Columbus, Georgia, USA. Kiryū's Columbus Street features pink and white dogwood trees and azalea bushes reminiscent of its sister city Columbus, Georgia.
The Kiryū School of Textiles, founded in 1915, has grown into Gunma University's School of Science and Technology, one of the largest in the country. Its website contains much useful information in English about the city and its history, and its many international engineering students lend Kiryū a more cosmopolitan flavor than many cities its size.
In 2005, Kiryū doubled its size by incorporating a largely rural region across the upper Watarase River valley. But the most scenic gorges and valleys of the upper Watarase fall within the bounds of Midori, a separate jurisdiction, while the headwaters and the infamous Ashio copper mine fall within the bounds of Nikko city.

Eat[edit]
Kiryu is famous for its udon (thick noodles made with wheat flour). There are many forms of udon from extremely wide, flat noodles known as "himokawa noodles" to rather thin flat noodles vaguely reminiscent of fettuccine in shape. Udon is eaten hot or cold. There are many udon shops around the city of Kiryu, ranging in price from very cheap to gourmet-range. In addition to udon noodles, Kiryu is also the home of "sauce katsudon" - a fried pork cutlet seasoned with a secret sauce and served on a bed of hot rice. There are several restaurants serving this tasty dish, while Shitamiya is generally recognised as the originator. No trip to Kiryu would be complete without sampling udon and sauce katsudon.
