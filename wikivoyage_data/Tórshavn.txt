Tórshavn  (lit. Thor's Haven) is the capital of the Faroe Islands. At the foot of a mountain range, the archipelago's largest city has a long history dating back as far as 850 AD.


Understand[edit]
Tórshavn Cathedral
The city was founded in the 10th century and named after Thor, the god of thunder and lightning in Norse mythology. In the early history of the Faroes, Tórshavn became the political centre of the Faroes, and it still is today. The first settlers established their own parliament called "ting" around 800 AD. The main ting was established on Tinganes in Tórshavn and local tings were established in different parts of the islands. Tinganes drew people to trade, to attend court meetings, etc. In 2023, the city had a population of around 14,000, with about 21,000 in the metro area.

Get in[edit]
For most visitors Tórshavn will be the point of entry to the Faroe Islands. Practically everything in that article's Get in section also applies to Tórshavn.

By plane[edit]
62.063611-7.2772221 Vágar Airport (FAE IATA) (on the neighboring island of Vágar). Atlantic Airways flies there on a regular basis from Copenhagen and operates flights from other Scandinavian and Western European cities as well. There is a bus connection to Tórshavn from the airport.   
By ferry[edit]
Smyril Line sails from Hirtshals in Denmark and Seyðisfjörður on Iceland to Tórshavn. If you are travelling with a car from Iceland to Denmark or vice versa, it is in principle possible to take off your car during the several hours long stopover in Tórshavn for a little island ride. It is, however, necessary to consider this option in advance when getting your car on board and have it parked in the correct queue.

By car[edit]
You can take the car with you on the ferry mentioned above. It is also possible to rent a car at the airport.

By bus[edit]
From elsewhere on the Faroe Islands.
