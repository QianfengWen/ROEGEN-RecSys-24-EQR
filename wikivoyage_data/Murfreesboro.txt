Since the 1990s, Murfreesboro has been Tennessee's fastest growing major city and one of the fastest growing cities in the country.

Understand[edit]
The city is home to the center of population of Tennessee and the geographic center of Tennessee.

History[edit]
The new county seat for Rutherford County was founded in 1811, and named after Revolutionary War hero Colonel Hardy Murfree. As Tennessee settlement expanded to the west, the location of the state capital in Knoxville became inconvenient for most newcomers. In 1818, Murfreesboro was designated as the capital of Tennessee and its population boomed. Eight years later, however, it was replaced by Nashville.
During the American Civil War, at the very end of 1862, the Battle of Stones River, also called the Battle of Murfreesboro, was fought near the city. This was a major engagement between December 31 and January 2, 1863, the rival armies suffered 23,515 casualties. It was one of the bloodiest battles of the war. The Stones River National Battlefield is now a national historical site.
Union General William Rosecrans chose Murfreesboro to become his supply depot. Fortress Rosecrans, 2 miles (3.2 km) northwest of the town, had fortifications covered about 225 acres (0.91 km²). They were the largest built during the war. The fort's interior was a huge logistical resource center, including sawmills, warehouses, quartermaster maintenance depots, ammunition magazines, and living quarters for the 2,000 men who handled the operations and defended the post. The fortress was completed in June 1863. Major portions of the earthworks still exist and have been incorporated into the battlefield site.
After the war, Murfreesboro, which had been a mainly agricultural community, became home to several colleges and academies, gaining it the nickname the "Athens of Tennessee". World War II resulted in Murfreesboro diversifying into industry, manufacturing, and education. Growth has been steady since that time, creating a stable economy.
Murfreesboro has enjoyed substantial residential and commercial growth, with its population more than doubling between 1990 and 2010. The city has been a destination for many immigrants leaving areas affected by warfare; since 1990 numerous Somalis and Kurds from Iraq have settled here. 

Climate[edit]
Being in the Sun Belt, Murfreesboro's climate is humid subtropical, with mild winters and hot, humid summers. 
Murfreesboro has been in the path of destructive tornados several times. IN 2009, an EF4 tornado struck the fringes of Murfreesboro. As a result, two people were killed and 41 others injured. 117 homes were totally destroyed, and 292 had major damage.
