Understand[edit]
Historical Toburn headframe
Kirkland Lake was founded as a mining town, and there is still a gold mine in town with the rest of the town supporting the mine.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Highway 66 passes going west and east through Kirkland Lake. The section of Highway 66 from Highway 11 (14 km west Kirkland Lake) and continuing on within Quebec as Highway 117 through to Montreal is a branch of the Trans-Canada Highway.  The following are some routes to reach Kirkland Lake:

From the west, take the Highway 11 (another branch of the Trans-Canada Highway), then turn east on Highway 66 (just south of Kenogami Lake). You'll drive through Swastika before reaching downtown Kirkland Lake. (Yes, Swastika is a real town, it had the name before World War II, and jokes about the name are not appreciated.)
From the south, take the Highway 11, then turn north on Highway 112. That highway ends at Highway 66; turn east to get to downtown Kirkland Lake.
From the east, Quebec Highway 117 from Rouyn-Noranda becomes Ontario Highway 66 at the provincial border - keep driving west for a bit over a half-hour after crossing the border to reach Kirkland Lake.  Although Highway 117 starts in Montreal, it is faster to start the trip on Autoroute 15, a freeway, which combines into Highway 117.
