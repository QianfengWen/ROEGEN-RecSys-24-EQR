Vrin[edit]
Vrin is the last village of the valley. The town underwent a special conservation effort, trying to use its old charm to an advantage and to prevent the common problem of depopulation. The old town centre has been carefully maintained and complemented with modern buildings by a local architect. Thanks to these efforts the town has a lot of old wooden buildings which are well preserved.
