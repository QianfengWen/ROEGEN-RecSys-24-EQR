Glenwood Springs is located in the western half of Colorado, United States of America, right where the south central, Front Range, and northwestern regions meet.  It is in Garfield County roughly halfway between Vail and Aspen.  Resting at about the same elevation as Denver, Glenwood Springs is famous for its hot springs pool.


Understand[edit]
Glenwood Springs is located at the confluence of the Colorado River and the Roaring Fork River, in the Roaring Fork Valley. The two rivers shape the town. They provide world-class fly-fishing, whitewater rafting, and now kayaking.
Originally named Defiance, in the late 1800s, the name was changed by settlers from an Iowa town called Glenwood.  Many of the nearby towns (Aspen and Leadville) had their booms while Glenwood Springs was yet in its infancy.  Glenwood Springs was difficult to reach due to the canyons to the east and west; it was also located on Ute land. The town grew in part thanks to its location on the railroad and the Colorado River.
The local area is surrounded by public lands, especially the White River National Forest, which attracts hunters and campers from great distance. The Grand Mesa is to the west and the Flattops Wilderness area dominate to the North.  The  Flattops is a very large area offering unlimited high-country exploring.  The Four Mile recreation area (to the South-west)offers easier day mountain access favored by locals. Glenwood Springs is a truly great place to access all the Rocky Mountains have to offer.
In terms of culture (and ski-appeal) it is hard to overestimate the role of Aspen.  Glenwood Springians may not want to actually live in Aspen, but they do appreciate being able to commute to a cultural mecca.
Up the valley are Carbondale, Basalt, Snowmass and Aspen.  To the west are New Castle, Silt and Rifle.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
There is city airport in Glenwood Springs, but it only accommodates small private planes. The Garfield County Airport, between Silt and Rifle is about 40 minutes away. It accommodates larger planes, but does not offer commercial flights.

Aspen (45 minutes, tough in traffic and common weather issues) paid parking and not much of it.
Grand Junction (80 minutes by car)- this is convenient for travelers heading south and west.
