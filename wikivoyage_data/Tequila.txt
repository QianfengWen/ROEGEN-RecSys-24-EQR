Tequila is a municipality in Jalisco, Mexico, near Guadalajara. It is famous for being the birthplace of the eponymous tequila liquor. Its distilleries offer tours of the fabrication process and into the fields where the agave plant, from which it is made, is grown. 


Understand[edit]
Tequila landscape
The beverage called tequila is really a variety of mezcal, made wholly or mostly from the blue agave plant. This plant is native to the Tequila area so this version of mescal was named after the town. 
Tequila is made from the blue agave plant, native to this area. The heart of the plant contains sugars and had been used by native peoples here to make a fermented drink. After the Spanish arrived, they took this fermented beverage and distilled it, producing the tequila known today. The "Agave Landscape and Ancient Industrial Facilities of Tequila" has been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list.


A surprising tradition is the nightly blessing of the town by the parish priest. At 21:00 every night, the priest offers blessings by ringing a bell three times, and directing the holy of holyest cross with the sacraments towards all 4 cardinal points. At this moment, everyone in the town stops what they are doing, including turning off things like the television or radio and stands for the blessing.
The city was home to 29,000 people in 2010.
