Port Hedland is an industrial port in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, with a population of 15,471 (2020). It exports iron ore from the mines inland, with huge freight trains bringing the ore to the docks. It has accommodation and you might stop over on the way to Broome, or in the secondary town of South Hedland 13 km south. You're unlikely to linger unless you're in the mining or shipping business. 


Understand[edit]
The iron ore trains are almost 3 km (1.9 mi) long
In the dreaming, a huge blind snake dwelt in a freshwater lagoon, but carved a sinuous channel through to the sea. The Kariyarra and Nyamal people call this place Marapikurrinya, which may refer to its hand-like pattern of freshwater creeks, or to the peninsula on which the town now stands, literally a headland. European settlement of the Pilbara was held back by the lack of good harbours along this coast but they persevered, and in 1896 the town was established and laid out on a grid. At some point the snake took umbrage at the disturbance and departed, to who knows where.
There was a gold rush in the 1890s at Marble Bar, but Port Hedland remained small until the 1960s, when vast deposits of iron ore were found inland. The company city of Newman was founded, an astonishing network of private railways replicated the windings of the blind snake, converging on Port Hedland which burgeoned into a major industrial port. And so it remains. The industry is south side of the town peninsula, on Finucane Island across the channel, and all around the estuary. Dust blows everywhere; the mines are far inland but with half a billion tonnes exported through town annually, some of it is destined to get under your contact lenses. The ore is shipped out to make steel, and there are also large salt pans, and other minerals such as lithium, so Port Hedland plays an important part in Australia's economy. BHP is the company running the mines and the port, while their spin-off BlueScope makes the steel. 
May to August is the best time to visit: it's not exactly cool, but it's less torrid. October to March is very hot, the town slumbers, and from December it's the cyclone season. In 2021 Pilbara quailed before the approach of Cyclone Seroja, but a fluke collision with another cyclone diverted the storm south, and the Gascoyne coast was wrecked instead.
-20.3123118.57641 Port Hedland Visitor Centre is where the bus will drop you, on 13 Wedge St near the tip of the peninsula. It's open M-F 9AM-5PM, Sa Su 9AM-3PM.

Get in[edit]
Port Hedland has several direct flights a day from Perth with Qantas, Virgin and Alliance. They take two hours and you might pay $600 return. Local flights by Aviair and Nexus Airlines are from Karratha, Newman, Geraldton and Broome.  
-20.3778118.62641 Port Hedland Airport (PHE  IATA) is 11 km southeast of Port Hedland and 11 km northeast of South Hedland. The cafe and bar is only open around flights; smoking is permitted on the terminal forecourt. The airport has car rental from Thrifty, Enterprise and Poshly. A taxi to either town takes ten minutes and might cost $40.
Integrity Coaches run 3 nights a week from Perth, taking 29 hours along the coast via Dongara, Geraldton, Carnarvon, Exmouth and Karratha. One bus a week runs inland on the Great Northern Highway via Mount Magnet and Newman, taking 22 hours. The bus stop is at Port Hedland Visitor Centre, and the adult fare in 2022 is $600 return. These buses continue east from Port Hedland to Broome, another 7 hours.  
By road you have the same choice as the bus routes: 1750 km by the North West Coastal Highway or 1628 km inland by the Great Northern Highway, both taking 18 hours.
Don't come by rail unless you're a train driver or a lump of iron ore. Company railways haul the ore 426 km from Newman to the port, and the trains are almost 3 km long. Could it hurt to tack a coach or two on the end? The sea port is likewise busy with ore freighters but has no ferry or cruise ships.

You really need your own vehicle hereabouts, not least for the air-con.

See[edit]
-20.3134118.57681 Dalgety House Museum, Lot 462 Anderson St (corner of Wedge St, by visitor centre), ☏ +61 8 9173 4300. May-Oct M-F 10AM–2PM, Sa Su 11AM–1PM. This exhibits the development of the region from scrub to livestock ranges to large-scale mining. A workers' cottage was relocated here and houses an exhibition on SS Koombana, a small passenger and cargo ship which disappeared in a cyclone of 1912, with the loss of all 150 aboard. The wreck has not been found. Adult $3, child $1.50. (updated Feb 2022)
Courthouse Gallery (aka The Junction) exhibits work by local artists, which is for sale. It's on Edgar St by the Visitor Centre. Hours roughly Tu-Sa 9AM-4PM but may vary, free admission.
Marapikurrinya Park at the north end of Wedge Street gives a close-up view of the freighters.
Street art is dotted here and there. Most is around Wedge St and the Visitor Centre, check with them for outlying examples worth seeking out, such as the big water tanks east on Wilson St.
-20.3073118.59292 Spoil Bank is the lyrical name of the sand spit north side of downtown, made of harbour dredgings. Its beaches are safe for swimming. The shore stretching east is Cemetery Beach, which shades into Koombana.
Sea turtles: several species are common, but the town's signature beast is the Flatback, Natator depressus. It's 80-90 cm long with an olive-green to grey carapace which is less domed than other species and upturned at the edges. It nests Nov-Jan and the hatchlings emerge Dec-March, with Cemetery Beach a major rookery. These areas may be cordoned off in season and in any case you must stay clear of nests: volunteers patrol each morning and log the turtle tracks and nests. Hatchlings head out to sea but don't go far, dwelling in the 60 m depth zone. Males never return to land, while the females return to lay clutches every 2 or 3 years.
Koombana is the main beach north side of town. Multiple access points, for instance by the Hedland Hotel (see Sleep) where there's a viewpoint over beach and town. There's also a small park here and the Gratwick Aquatic and Fitness Centre.
Rock of Ages is the rugged shore east of Koombana. Don't swim here.
-20.3092118.63963 Cooke Point is a good place to watch the ships queuing to come into port. But the big attraction is the staircase to the moon, a natural effect seen on the Pilbara coast March-Oct on the full moon spring tides. Water caught between the ripples on the sand flats exposed at low tide creates the image of a golden staircase towards the rising moon. Viewing times are published locally, eg by the Visitor Centre. They may forget to mention that you also can see the moon in broad daylight, by swivelling your binoculars south to the beach beyond the creek, where clothing is optional.
-20.3251118.66664 Six Mile Creek is the most easterly beach access, then the highway swings inland. It's a popular edge-of-town spot for strolling and fishing.
-20.3445118.6315 Redbank Bridge is a lookout on the road into town where you can view the salt-extraction lagoons and the massive freight trains trundling to the port.

-20.3739118.98197 Fish Rock is a striking rock formation 50 km east of town, on the highway to Broome at the turn-off for Hwy 138 to Marble Bar. It resembles a gaping mouth and is also called Turtle Rock or more correctly Mikurrunya Hills. In the dreaming, the rock is Mikurri's estranged wife.
