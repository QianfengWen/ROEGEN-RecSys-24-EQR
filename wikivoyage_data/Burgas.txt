Understand[edit]
Three lakes surround Burgas – Vaya (also known as the Burgas lake), Atanaskovsko lake and Mandrensko lake.
There is historical evidence that the lands that today Burgas occupies have been inhabited since ancient times. However at that period most of the lands that today Burgas covers were small fisherman villages and fortifications. It was hard to flourish under the pressure of the better developed at that period trade centers Nesebar and Sozopol. At the end of the 19th century the city had fewer than 3000 inhabitants.
The Burgas Bay turned out to be very favorable for the navy and the Port of Burgas developed in the beginning of 20th century. The trade and the industry are the driving force of the city even today. The oil refinery was constructed in mid 20th century, and produces many plastic and oil products, as well as gas. More than 300,000 inhabitants live in Burgas today.
The tourism is not particularly developed in Burgas but the city is a stop for the picturesque century-old towns Nesebar and Sozopol. Many large luxury holiday resorts were constructed in the Bay of Burgas. For the lovers of nature there are many camp-sites.

Burgas lakes[edit]
Three lakes surround Burgas:

Vaya (the Burgas) lake – the largest natural lake in Bulgaria. It is located to the west of Burgas. The water is 4-11% salty. Fresh water comes from 3 rivers and the neighboring  Mandrensko lake that is turned to dam. The lake waters are dirty and it is not recommended to swim there. A lot of people go fishing there. Via Pontica – one of the largest bird migration ‘highways’ passes over the lake and more than 250 bird species can be seen there. Carp fishing is popular in the lake.
Atanasovsko lake – It is located to the North of Burgas. The water is 20–27.5% salty and this makes it very favorable for salt-production. Its northern side is connected to the Black Sea. The Burgas – Nesebar – Varna road passes through the lake. Due to the specific salt flora in the region more than 70% of all birds that can be seen in Bulgaria can be seen in the Atanasovo lake zone especially during the autumn migration. Part of the lake is natural reserve and are under restricted access.
Mandrensko lake – It is south of Burgas. Until 1934 it was salty lake but later its structure was changed and a dam was constructed here. Today it is not a salty lake. Four rivers get into the lake. Via Pontica – one of the largest bird migration ‘highways’ passes over the lake. On the side of the Mandrensko lake is located the Poda bird and sparrow watching zone.

Stay safe[edit]
Burgas is generally safe city. However some common sense guidelines should be kept in mind when you travel especially in summer.
In summer the pickpocketing is more common because a lot of pickpockets from the country come to get advantage of the tourists. Keep your money and purse. Do not leave your property unattended.
Often beggars approach foreigners and ask for money. The best will be to pretend that you do not get what they want and walk away. If they keep on following you – get into a shop or sit inside a café to have a drink until they leave you alone. Alternatively if they still don't go, try to speak to a security guard in the shop, café or bank.
There are a number of scam-taxi drivers in summer. Double check the tariff when you get into a taxi.
When you exchange money, double check the rates, ask if there are any taxes and basically the best will be to ask a few times how much Bulgarian leva you will get for your foreign currency. The normal exchange rate for €1 is 1.94 лв. You should be very desperate to exchange under that level, but never allow exchange rate under 1.85 лв.
Be aware of people approaching you on the street offering good exchange rates or anything else.
At night avoid speaking too loudly and avoid too dark areas especially in the Sea Garden.
Avoid conflicts with drunken people. In summer the Sea Garden and the beach are full of cafes and bars and people who drink sometimes way too much and are easy confronted. Stay away from cases like this.
Be aware of people offering you to taste cherries or other fruits in the street. It is not free and if you taste you will be physically pushed to buy an entire bucket, usually at a very high price. Ignore them and say no firmly.
