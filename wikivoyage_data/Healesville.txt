Healesville is a small town at the eastern end of Victoria's Yarra Valley near Melbourne.


Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The town is only about half an hour from the outer eastern suburbs by the Maroondah Highway.  Because of its proximity to the city, many people live in the area and drive into the suburbs for work, this makes the road very busy during rush hours, and there is a bottleneck around Lilydale. Outside of peak hours, it's an easy drive from the city to the peaceful bushland setting of the town.

By bus[edit]
If you don't want to drive, you can take a train from the centre of Melbourne to Lilydale, and then there is a regular (McKenzies) bus service which runs to Healesville via Yarra Glen. Although it is not directly connected to Melbourne, for public transport purposes Healesville is considered part of 'Zone Two' formerly Zone Three until zone reorganization, the outer-eastern transport zone, and it only costs around $10 for an all-day zone 1 and 2 rail and bus ticket.

Get around[edit]
By car[edit]
While theoretically you can take the car, often the distances are very short, and you wouldn't really need to take your car out.

By walking[edit]
It is possible to walk within the town if you don't mind small hills.
