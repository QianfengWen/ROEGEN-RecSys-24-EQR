Hirosaki (弘前) is a city in Aomori prefecture, in the northern Tohoku region of the main Japanese island Honshu.


Understand[edit]
Hirosaki was the capital of the Tsugaru clan that once ruled over much of Tohoku's northern parts.  Occasionally called "the Kyoto of the North", this hyperbole is backed up mostly by an abundance of temples, a castle's remains, and a famous version of the Nebuta Festival, called the Neputa Festival in Hirosaki.

Tourist information site[edit]
The local tourist association has a multilingual guide site.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The closest airport is in Aomori (AOJ IATA).

By train[edit]
Hirosaki is on the JR Ōu Main Line (奥羽本線) connecting Aomori, Akita and Fukushima.
From Tokyo Station, take the Tohoku Shinkansen Hayate or Hayabusa train to Shin-Aomori, then change to the Tsugaru Limited Express train or a Local Ou Main Line train bound for Akita/Odate. The trip takes 4 hours 15 minutes at a cost of ¥16,700. There is also a seasonal "Resort Shirakami" train connecting Akita and Aomori via the Gono line that makes a stop here. If you are coming in from Akita, unless you are taking the Resort Shirakami train for the view, it is far quicker to take the Tsugaru train. For foreign tourists heading from Tokyo, the better deal is to purchase a JR East Rail Pass or the national Japan Rail Pass.
Local trains from Aomori depart once per hour and take about 45 minutes (¥650). There are also additional Rapid trains at the same price during rush hour.

Get around[edit]
Hirosaki is fairly spread out and you will need to figure out the bus system to get around affordably.  Most lines radiate from JR Hirosaki station.

Hirosaki Castle was completed in 1611 and housed several generations of the Tsugaru Clan. The large 49.2-hectare grounds include three concentric moats and earthen fortifications that surround the remains of the inner castle area: five castle gates, three corner keeps and a castle tower. After the original five-story tower was struck by lightning and burned down, the current three-storied Tenshukaku tower was built to replace it. The castle grounds are now a public park famous nationwide for its cherry blossoms. The castle tower houses a museum featuring samurai-era swords, suits of armor, helmets and other items related to the castle's history. See also Japanese castles. Adults ¥300; children ¥100 (including admission to Tenshukaku Castle Tower Museum).   
40.611325140.4697482 Neputa Village (ねぷた村; Neputa-mura). Located at the park's northerneastern corner, this is where the festival's floats and memorabilia are held outside the Neputa festival season (see Do).  The Village showcases a particularly large 8x10m specimen, and sheepishly notes that it's now too big to fit under the electric wires that crisscross Japanese streets.  There are also several workshops preparing traditional Hirosaki handicrafts, which can be purchased by visitors. ¥500. 
40.603096140.4653353 Hirosaki Tourist Center. On the other side of the park, Oteman Square contains Hirosaki's tourist information center and showcases more beautiful Neputa stuff including Japan's largest drum, diameter 4.5m wide and big enough for 50 people to bang on at once. Free.

40.613099140.4646947 Former Ito Residence (旧伊東家住宅). The Ito family were a doctor family for generations during the feudal era.

Nevertheless, the architecture closely resembles that of a samurai residence. (updated Feb 2024)

Do[edit]
 Neputa Festival (ねぷた祭り). Hirosaki's biggest event is this yearly festival, held in the first week of August and quite similar to Aomori's Nebuta Matsuri (note slight difference in spelling).  The festival is famous for its extravagant and colorful illuminated floats and accompanying dancers, and accommodation in the area is booked tight in season.  In contrast with Aomori's huge Nebuta festival, Hirosaki's Neputa is known for being more low-key and accessible.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that a visitor's opportunities for interaction with the parade activities and local participants is greater at Hirosaki's festival than at Aomori's. 
The local cherry blossom festival is also a sight to see. With over 5,000 cherry trees in the park around the castle. The locals and tourists find it an enjoyable festival of laughing, singing, dancing and drinking.
The snow lantern festival is held during early February every year. During the festival, Hirosaki Castle Park is filled with snow lanterns and sculptures which are illuminated during the evenings.
