Yulee is a town in the First Coast region of Florida near the Georgia border.


Understand[edit]
Yulee is north of Jacksonville and west of Amelia Island providing a gateway between the two cities. It sits in the center of Florida's northernmost county on the Atlantic Coast, Nassau County, on the Georgia border.
The town of Yulee shares some overlap with Fernandina Beach, a town which is centered on Amelia Island. However, Yulee and the mainland part of Fernandina Beach are separated from Amelia Island by the Intracoastal Waterway.
