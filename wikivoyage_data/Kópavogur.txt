Kópavogur is one of the youngest towns in Iceland so there is not much there of historical significance. It was a suburb of Reykjavík with the first houses built during World War II. Explosive growth in business and housing building doubled the town in size since 1990, giving it large shopping centres and an office/commercial building that is the tallest building in Iceland, the 64.102528-21.8806111 Smáratorg Tower   . The things to see are primarily in the older part of the town, particularly the Kársnes peninsula with trees in the gardens and treelined streets and the picturesque church 64.1123-21.9132 Kópavogskirkja    on top of the Borgarholt.
