Manilla is a small town (population 2,550 in 2016) in the New England region in New South Wales, Australia.


Understand[edit]
Manilla Street, the main street
Manilla, on the junction of the Manilla River and the Namoi River, was a camping ground for the indigenous Kamilaroi people. During the 1850s, bullock teams supplying the outlying farms and the settlements of Bingara, Barraba and Bundarra were often delayed here when either or both of the rivers were in flood, and in 1853 an entrepreneur, George Verness, set up a store and wine shop to supply the teamsters. 
Wheat, sheep, and cattle farms are the main industries in the district. Manilla is a good base for fishing and paragliding.
