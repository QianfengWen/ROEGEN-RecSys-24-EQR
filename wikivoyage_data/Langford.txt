The City of Langford is a city of over 35,000 people (2016), and is the business hub of "Westshore", a group of municipalities to the west of Victoria. Visitors would primarily enjoy the lakes and trails which are less busy than similar offerings closer to Victoria downtown core.


Understand[edit]
Esquimalt & Nanaimo Train Station
Langford's history of European settlement dates to 1851, when Captain Edward Langford established one of the four Hudson's Bay Company farms in the Victoria area. In the early 1860s, the region of Langford experienced a short-lived gold rush in what is now Goldstream Provincial Park. The area was a favourite recreation destination for thousands of Victorians in the late 1800s: day-trippers travelled via railway to the popular country resort Goldstream House Hotel; hunters built their lodges on the shores of the lakes near the mountains; and a summer colony of the well-to-do city folk relaxed and socialized at Langford Lake.
The region has become the fastest growing little city on Vancouver Island, with big retail stores and new residential developments, and the expanding suburban town of Langford became a city in 2003.

Get in[edit]

Going west the trail is great with kids as it goes through active farms (horses, sheep, cows, chickens, ducks), there are also birds and deer wildlife in abundance.  The trail is wide.  The fall colours and the section near Hatley Memorial Gardens (cemetery) is especially nice; that section is great to grab blackberries in the Summer and the branches from mature trees on each side of the trail form a tunnel.
Good road options are going to Happy Valley Road, to Metchosin Road, (shortcut at Latoria Rd), further through to the Coburg Peninsula, then to Sooke Rd and back on Goldstream road (15-25 km).
