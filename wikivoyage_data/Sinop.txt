Sinop is a city in the Western Karadeniz region, on the Turkish Black Sea coast. In 2022 it had a population of 57,404. 


Understand[edit]
The earliest known settlers were Hellenistic people from the 7th or 8th century BC. (The Hittites may have arrived sooner, but historians think not, and that their artefacts here indicate trade goods not settlement.) It was a port for coast-hugging small vessels but, backed by mountains, has poor inland access, so Samsun further east grew into the major port. Sinop was still worth ransacking or raiding, the last incursion being in 1853 when Russia made a surprise seaborne attack: the coast hereabouts has the shortest crossing north to Crimea.
Sinop is nowadays a beach resort for the townsfolk of Istanbul and Ankara, and accommodation gets very full June-September. Few westerners ever come this way.

42.007135.0862 Sinop Otogarı the bus station is 6 km west of town centre. It's modern but filthy inside.

Get around[edit]
Sinop is easily navigable by foot. Parking is difficult in summer.

See[edit]
City walls are best preserved crossing the isthmus west of town centre, with bastions at each end, then along the harbour shore south.
Hacı Ömer Mosque just west of Otel 117 was built in 1903 for the harbour workers. The fountain between it and the hotel is a memorial to casualties of the 1853 Russian surprise attack.
42.024435.14331 Sinop Fortress, Bülent Ecevit Cd 13, ☏ +90 368 261 30 23. Daily 08:30-23:00. Bastion overlooking the harbour, first built in the 8th century BC by Hellenistic immigrants from Miletus, but extended and repaired several times, for instance in the 14th century when the Genoese fortified the entire city. From 1887 to 1997 it housed a high security prison, so it features in the works of a dozen Turkish writers whose seditious publications got them slammed in here. You can look around and climb to the rooftop cafe for views. Otherwise not much here, plans for a cultural centre have come to nothing; perhaps it could be an escape room?  (updated Feb 2024)
Sinop Harbour is just south of the fortress. The 200 m east wharf is quieter and used for fishing, the 500 m west wharf is a busy commercial dock.
42.025335.14142 Statue of Diogenes on Fatih Cd celebrates the smelly dingbat philosopher who preached Cynicism. Diogenes was a banker, born in Sinop in 412 or 404 BC, who had to flee because as mint-master he trashed the city currency. (This part of the legend is backed up by debased coins of that period, smashed to take them out of circulation.) It's said he was captured by pirates, anyhow he ended up in Corinth. There he cut a cantankerous squalid figure, raging against corruption all around, and rough-sleeping in a wine jar. His statue shows him holding a lantern, which he carried by day saying he was "looking for a man" - this is nowadays glossed as "looking for an honest man" but given his sexual habits it was maybe just as he said. He's accompanied by a dog as he thought they were nobler simpler creatures, crapping in public as he did, and κυνικός (kynikos, "dog-like") became the word "cynic". His name lives on in "Diogenes Syndrome" where someone lives in squalid conditions, seemingly through personal choice, as depicted in the 2015 film "The Lady in the Van".
42.02638935.1483333 Alaaddin Mosque, Sakarya Cd 35. Built in 1267 AD in Seljuk style after its predecessor was destroyed, and named after its endower Sultan Alaaddin Kayqubad I (1188–1237). It's been restored several times, the latest in 2008.   (updated Feb 2024)
The main shopping street
Pervane Medrese is across Görgün Sk just north of Alaaddin Mosque. It was a religious school founded in 1262, named for Mu'in al-Din Parwana who ousted Trebizond (a Byzantine rump state) from Sinop. It closed in 1923 when Turkish education was secularised, and became a depot for various archaeological and ethnographic items; it was a museum 1941 to 1970 when the city museum moved to its present site. It nowadays hosts souvenir and craft shops.
42.027535.1516674 Archaeological Museum, Okullar Cd 2, ☏ +90 368 261 1975. Daily 08:00-17:00. This exhibits artefacts found in the area, plus a Seljuk sultana's tomb of 1395 and a temple to Serapis, presumably Roman. Adult 70 TL.   (updated Feb 2024)
42.026335.15315 Ethnographic Museum, Kemalettin Sami Cd 7. Daily 08:00-17:00. Displays of local culture in the former Aslan Torun mansion. (updated Feb 2024)
Kef Evi Mosque is on Derviş Sarabil Cd a block north of the ethnography museum. It was built in 1581 AD.
42.026135.15726 Balatlar Church, Kaynak Sk 7. Scrappy ruin of a Byzantine church, though the chapel vault is still roofed and has frescoes.   (updated Feb 2024)
42.025435.16157 Seyid İbrahim Bilal Mosque at Okullar Cd 99 is a small mosque and shrine built in 1297 AD. Bilal was the grandson of Huseyin, in turn the grandson of the Islamic prophet Mohammed; sufficient reason for the Byzantines to chop his head off when he strayed this way in the 7th century.
42.016935.17948 Pasha Bastion (Paşa Tabyası) is a half-moon artillery position. It was built to protect the town against sea-borne attack from Russia, too late as town and fleet were bombarded in 1853. This escalated into the Crimean War, as France, Britain and Sardinia-Piedmont (the proto-Italy) weighed in to prop up Turkey against Russian expansion. Enter from Yakamoz Sk on the north side. The area is neglected and overgrown, with only a few grazing beasts left on guard against further Russian advance.

42.09758134.94449410 İnceburun 23 km northwest of town is a breezy peninsula with an 1863-built lighthouse. It's nearly the northernmost point in Turkey but the area against the Bulgarian border edges it.
