Goondiwindi is a town in the Darling Downs region of Queensland, Australia. It is the gateway to Queensland as it is right on the Queensland / New South Wales border.


Understand[edit]
The name Goondiwindi derives from the Aboriginal word "resting place of the birds".

Get in[edit]
The best way to come is through the A39, either from NSW or Queensland. Be aware that during times where Qld has shut its borders to a jurisdiction, passing here may be taking its toll on wait times. But regardless, from Toowoomba, it's a quick short drive from T.
Crisps Coaches runs bus services to Goondiwindi on Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays.  Buses start in Moree from the south, and Brisbane and Toowoomba (both via Warwick) from the east.
The nearest airport to Goondiwindi is Moree Regional Airport.
