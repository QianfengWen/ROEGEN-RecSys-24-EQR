Thames Street in Ingersoll, Ontario
Ingersoll is a town of about 13,700 in Southwestern Ontario, southwest of Toronto between Woodstock and London.  


Understand[edit]
The town is named after its first European settler Thomas Ingersoll, who was the father of Laura Secord, a Canadian war hero of the War of 1812. Ingersoll arrived in 1795. The Town of Ingersoll was a destination for runaway slaves on the Underground Railroad.

History[edit]
Ingersoll’s founder, Thomas Ingersoll (1751–1812), was a native of Massachusetts who moved to the Niagara District of Upper Canada in 1795. In 1793 he received a grant 1200 acres, which became the site of the community of Ingersoll. He established a farm for his family and settled other families nearby. Thomas's eldest child, Laura Secord, was a heroine of the War of 1812.
Ingersoll became Oxford County’s principal industrial centre with the Noxon Brothers and the Eastwood foundry, both manufacturers of agricultural implements. By the 1860s, dairying was an emerging industry, sparked farm-wife production of cheese and butter, and then by the introduction of the factory system of cheese production in 1864. In 1866, to promote Ingersoll cheese as a high-quality, standardized brand, a cheese producer, James Harris, and local businessmen produced a 7,300-pound mammoth cheese, exhibited it at the New York State Fair in Saratoga, and then exported it to England.
