Understand[edit]
History[edit]
The municipality of the parish of Saint-Paulin was erected in 1847 by detachment from the municipality of Saint-Léon-le-Grand. The first wooden chapel was erected in 1848, and the stone parish church in 1887.
The heart of the village was built around the intersection of rue Laflèche (north-south direction) which is parallel to provincial road 349, and rue Lottinville which is partly provincial roads 349 and 350. The Centre Multiservice Réal-U.-Guimond was erected in 1994 and was inaugurated in March 1995. The locality celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2000.

Geography[edit]
The Rivière du Loup forms a north-facing semicircle, the radius of which varies between 3.5 km (2.2 mi) and 4.0 km (2.5 mi) around the centre of the village of Saint-Paulin. After heading north (in the northeastern part of the municipality), the course of the river branches off to the southeast (i.e. in the northeastern part of the municipal territory). Then, the Loup River successively crosses the Trembles Falls, the Chaudières Falls and the Magnan Falls. These falls are attractions for visitors. Upstream from the Hunterstown Rapids, a hamlet in the northern part of Saint-Paulin territory, the river surface is 150 m (490 ft) above sea level; after this series of falls and rapids, the surface is at 66 m (217 ft) at the foot of the fall in Magnan (located south of route 350), i.e., a drop of 84 m (276 ft).
The village of Saint-Paulin is crossed from west to east by the Saint-Louis River. The rivière du Roi (King's River) flows in the northern part of the municipality; before its mouth, its course bypasses Juneau Island (length: 1.9 km (1.2 mi)).

Economy[edit]
Economic activities in Saint-Paulin have mainly been: agriculture, forestry, small industries (e.g., sawmill), local businesses and local services (e.g., municipality, elementary school education). Recreational and tourist activities have intensified, particularly with Le baluchon Éco-villégiature and various other accommodations.
