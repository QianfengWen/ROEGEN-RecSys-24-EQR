Barrington is a scenic town of 17,000 (2020) in Bristol County, Rhode Island with many great waterfront properties and activities. 


Understand[edit]
Barrington was established as its own town back in 1717 and is named after Barrington, Somerset where many of the original English settlers came from. Barrington is not a very large town as it spans only 15.4 square miles. However, of the 15.4 square miles, 8.4 of it is land and 7.0 of it is water. Much of Barrington's history comes from the brick industry and small businesses clustered along the main street, which helps it maintain its friendly and comfortable atmosphere.
Bordered on three sides by water, this small town on Narragansett Bay retains the leisurely feel of its days as an early 20th-century summer resort, and its proximity to Providence and Newport allows easy access to both city and beaches.  Entering from either side of Barrington, either from Seekonk, Massachusetts, or from Warren, Rhode Island, you will run across or next to the Barrington River. In the summer, many people enjoy days of waterskiing, fishing, and sailing on the river. Other main attractions during the summer are the Barrington Beach and Rhode Island Country Club.
Due to its coastal New England climate, Barrington experiences all four seasons, with a long summer, blooming spring, scenic autumn, and snowy winter.  In the summer, it offers quick getaways to the beaches in Newport, the Cape, and the Islands, and in the winter, ski trips to New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont are just a few hours north. Barrington offers the best parts of New England living, while offering a quiet haven with easy access to the nearby action.

Get around[edit]
Barrington is easily navigated either by car or by public transportation. The RIPTA (Rhode Island Public Transit Authority) has eight stops within the town. Barrington is also home to a bike path that runs through some of its more scenic locations such as Brickyard Pond, the YMCA softball field, and through the center of town. This makes it easy to get around Barrington either by bike, walking, running, or driving. Travel by boat along the Barrington River by way of the Yacht Club. Barrington's waterside location also makes the town easily accessible to Narragansett Bay boaters looking to dock up and grab a bite to eat.

41.7417-71.30831 Barrington Civic Center Historic District (Barrington Town Hall), 283 County Rd. Built in 1887 by Stone, Carpenter and Wilson, architects of Providence. It was renovated in 2009 due to the deterioration of the outside stonework. The old style of this building offers a medieval feel through its unique masonry, towers and gables.   
41.7222-71.30892 Barrington Town Beach, Bay Road. Four acres of beachfront overlooking Narragansett Bay. Lifeguards on duty from June to September. The cost of a resident parking sticker is $15 for the season (June–August). Unfortunately this beautiful spot cannot be enjoyed all throughout the year: due to high levels of bacteria, the beach is often closed since it is not safe for swimming. Despite this and the fact that it's not known for large waves or surfing, it is still noteworthy as a small, quiet beach.   
 Haines Memorial Park, Narragansett Avenue. Include 75 acres of athletic fields, picnic sites, dog park, boat dock and launching ramp.

The rationale behind building this lighthouse was to mark the narrow channel between Nayatt Point and the reef off Conimicut Point. As a result of poor a poor design, the lighthouse deteriorated rapidly and was not tall enough. With only a height of 25 feet, the Nayatt Point Lighthouse was permanently deactivated in 1868.
