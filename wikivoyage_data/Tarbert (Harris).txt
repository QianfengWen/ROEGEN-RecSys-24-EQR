Tarbert is a village on Harris in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. With a population of 550, it's the main town and ferry terminal for Harris. It's the ideal base for touring the whole of Harris: you can also tour Lewis (which of course is the same island) but that's quite a drive from here.


Get in[edit]

57.8972-6.79961 Tarbert pier has Calmac ferries year-round daily from Uig on Skye, taking 1 hour 40 min. Until end of March 2025, return fares are £73.60 per car, £14.90 per adult including driver, and £7.60 per child aged 5-15. Buses from Glasgow connect with the ferries at Uig.
Other routes are from Ullapool on the mainland to Stornoway on Lewis then south by road, or to North or South Uist then by ferry to Leverburgh on Harris and go north by road.
By bus: Five buses run M-Sa between Tarbert and Stornoway, taking 75 min. A bus / ferry service runs up the Western Isles through Barra, the Uists and Harris and across Lewis to Stornoway, so M-Sa it's possible to go the whole route within a day. To do so northbound you need to set off from Castlebay on Barra at 6:20AM, but for Harris you could leave it till 10:20AM, reaching Lochboisedale on South Uist at 1:20PM, Benbecula at 3PM, Lochmaddy on North Uist at 3:30PM and Leverburgh on Harris at 17:00 then Tarbert at 5:30PM. Going south, you need to leave Stornoway at 9:30AM to go the whole route, and leave Tarbert at 10:45AM, Lochmaddy at 1:45PM, Benbecula at 2:25PM and Lochboisdale at 3:25PM reaching Castlebay at 5:35PM.

Get around[edit]
Tarbert can easily be explored on foot, but you needs wheels to get anywhere in rugged Harris.
Car Hire Hebrides are based at the filling station opposite Harris Hotel, tel +44 1851 706500. 
No Sunday buses; M-Sa Bus W10 runs along A859 six times, Bus W11 runs 2-3 times between Tarbert and Rhenigidale. Bus W12 runs 3-4 times between Tarbert, Amhuinnsuidhe and Huishinish. Bus W14 runs 3-4 times between Tarbert and Scalpay.

See[edit]
The Clisham is a "Corbett"
57.9321-6.84851 Bun Abhainn Eadarra or Bunavoneader along B887 west of Tarbert is the remains of a whaling station, active from 1904 to 1929. Its three ships worked in the North Atlantic, seeking oil from whale blubber. Thereafter oil was derived from other sources and whaling became uneconomic, though the station had a brief revival in the 1950s. It's a unique survival in Britain of a shore station.
Amhuinnsuidhe Castle (see Sleep) is one you can't help visiting, since the public road grazes its front doorstep. But no tours or stopping on the road here, it's for guest shooting-parties only.
57.9735-6.90612 Eagle Observatory is a cabin in the hills near Loch Scourst. Park on B887 at Meavaig and hike two miles up the track. Most visitors see no eagles but read in the sightings book that the place was besieged by them the previous day and a Fiat 500 was carried off.
Beehive shielings are Hebridean igloos - lacking wood or ice, shepherds make these little shelters out of stone covered with turf. There's a collection on the hillside above the track to the observatory.
57.9956-7.09153 Huishnish may have Scotland's most scenic loo at "The Gateway" shelter where B887 ends. Look out for wildlife along the coast, and you might hike the two miles northeast to Crabhadail glen and beach.
Scarp is the island half a mile west of Huishnish, uninhabited since the 1970s. The channel is narrow but tricky to navigate, so in 1934 Scarp was the target of dingbat experiments to send mail by rocket. The positive point to take from this endeavour is that the rockets did hit the island.
57.8779-6.75014 Sgeotasaigh or Scotasay is an island uninhabited since the early 20th century, near the ferry route into Tarbert. The lighthouse is a stubby navigation light on a separate islet.
57.8736-6.69195 Scalpay is an island ten miles east of Tarbert, connected by bridge since 1997. Sgalpaigh may mean ship island or scallop island, and this is specifically Scalpay of Harris to distinguish it from Scalpay off Skye. The village is west near the bridge, with a pub bistro and couple of B&Bs. The lane southeast peters out at Kenavaig, from where you can hike a couple of miles to Eilean Glas lighthouse, built 1789 and now automated and still in use.
57.899-6.3646 Shiant Islands are a group in The Minch five miles east, uninhabited since the early 20th century and now grazing land and a wildlife reserve. Geologically they're an extension of  Trotternish peninsula on Skye, with rocks much younger than the Lewis gneiss.
See Leverburgh for access to Luskentyre beach.
Do[edit]
Amhuinnsuidhe Castle
57.964-6.8141 Clisham at 799 metres (2621 ft) is the highest mountain and only "Corbett" in the Outer Hebrides. The simplest ascent is from the crest of the A859 between Tarbert and Ardvourlie (Aird a' Mhulaidh), and head up the southern shoulder.
57.995-6.76192 Scaladale Centre, Aird a' Mhulaidh HS3 3AB, ☏ +44 1859 502502. M-Sa 9AM-5PM. This is a residential outdoor activity centre for young people, open all year, on A859 near the boundary between Harris and Lewis. It's often block-booked by groups, but may have availability for bunks and for activities such as mountain biking or sailing on the loch. It's not routinely staffed, so you need to arrange access in advance. Dorm £25 ppn. (updated Sep 2023)
Rhenigidale (Rèinigeadal - see Hostel below) was only connected by road in 1990. Until then, the land route was the "Postman's Path" - a steep but firm hiking trail, not recommended for bikes. The way leads by the abandoned villages of Gearraidh Lotaigear (abandoned in the 1970s) and Molingeanais (abandoned 1964). Eventually the trail reaches the Tarbert-Scalpay road.
Drive or cycle the Golden Road, the switchback lane along the east coast from Tarbert to Rodel at the south tip of Harris.
Hebridean Way is a way-marked hiking and cycling trail the length of the Outer Hebrides. Stage 11 northbound for hikers crosses the hills from Scaladal to Balallan, 21 km (13 miles), 6 hours. The final Stage 12 takes the road to Laxay, crosses the moor to Achmore, then follows the lane into Stornoway. At 30 km (18.25 miles) it's the longest stage, but with much of it on paved roads can be done in 8 hours. Woodlands Centre west side of town is the ceremonial finishing point. However cyclists simply stay on the main road all the way from Tarbert to Langabhat then branch west towards the Butt of Lewis.
