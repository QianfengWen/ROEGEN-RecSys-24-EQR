Belturbet is a small town on the River Erne in County Cavan, with a population in 2016 of 1369. In Irish it's Béal Tairbirt, "mouth of the isthmus", and it grew up at a ford on the river. Boating and angling are the main reasons to visit.  


Get in[edit]
Belturbet Main Street
Expressway Bus 30 runs every 2-3 hours from Dublin Busáras and Airport via  Virginia,  Cavan and Butlersbridge, taking 2 hr 30 min to Belturbet, and continuing northeast to Enniskillen, Ballyshannon and Donegal Town. X30 from Dublin is nonstop between Cavan and Enniskillen, bypassing Belturbet, but you could change for Leydon's Coach, which runs twice M-Sa between Cavan, Belturbet and Enniskillen. The section between Belturbet and Enniskillen is joint-operated as Ulsterbus 58.
Belturbet is 123 km northeast of Dublin: follow M3 / N3 via Kells, Virginia and Cavan. 
4 km north of Belturbet is the border with Northern Ireland in the UK, and N3 becomes A509 to Enniskillen, for routes to Sligo and Derry. The border is unpatrolled but you must ensure that your personal and vehicle documents are valid - the rules changed in 2021.  
From Belfast follow A3 via Armagh and Monaghan towards Cavan, branching west on R197 at Gannon's Cross.
By boat, Belturbet is at the head of the navigable River Erne. This flows north into Lough Erne, which is connected by the Shannon-Erne Waterway to Carrick-on-Shannon and the entire Irish network, all the way to Limerick, Dublin and Waterford. See Waterways Ireland for current status of locks, moorings and so on, and see below for boat rentals.

See[edit]
54.1-7.4451 The Diamond or Market Square in village centre has pleasant 19th century buildings. Church of the Immaculate Conception (RC) just west is from 1868.
Belturbet island is a park west bank of the river. The grassy mound is all that's left of the Norman motte-and-bailey castle.
Belturbet railway station closed in 1959 and fell derelict. It's been restored as a museum, with the stationmaster's cottage converted into self-catering accommodation. These are all closed in early 2021.
Upper Lough Erne a few km north is in County Fermanagh but (with a bit of winding along the back lanes) Belturbet is a good base for visiting Crom Estate, Castle Balfour and Belle Isle Castle, with Marble Arch caves a bit further on.
54.058-7.4792 Drumlane Abbey is a medieval ruin with the 11.6 m stump of a Round Tower. After the dissolution the church was used by the C of I until 1820, and the cemetery is still in use.
54.116667-7.5833333 Ballyconnell is a small village on Woodford River, which is part of the Shannon-Erne Waterway. You might visit for boating or angling.
54.117-7.6834 Bawnboy further along N87 has a Workhouse Museum. This grim institution opened in 1852 and had 70 inmates, with separate accommodation blocks for men, women and children. The workhouse closed in 1921 and the building was variously a school, dance hall, sports hall and bakery. It's derelict but a museum-cum-preservation society is still there, hours erratic. A "bawn" is a protective wall for livestock and "boy" means yellow, but there's nothing left of that.
54.108-7.7025 Jampa Ling Buddhist Centre south of Bawnboy offers meditation classes. If you're quiet you can look around.
