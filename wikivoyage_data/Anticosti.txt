Baie de la Tour (Tower Bay)
Anticosti is a large but sparsely-populated island in Minganie in northeastern Quebec, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. While the island is over 160 km long, the only settlement of note on Anticosti is tiny Port-Menier (pop. 250) on the western coast. Much of the island is devoted to parkland or nature conservation.
Visitors to Anticosti come to fish for salmon on the Jupiter River or hunt white-tail deer. Anticosti Provincial Park straddles most of the island.
In 2018, it was submitted to UNESCO's tentative list, and became a natural  UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2023.


Understand[edit]
Aboriginal peoples visited the island for fishing and hunting. Jacques Cartier 'discovered' it for Europeans in 1534, although it remained without any permanent population until Louis IV gave it to the Jolliet family in 1680, who retained it until 1753. Since then it was used for only for timber harvesting until it was sold to French chocolatier Henri Menier in the late 19th century. He built Port Menier and introduced a deer population, who without natural predators expanded exponentially. Today there are more than 100,000 deer on the island, for a density of approximately 14 deer/km².

Stay safe[edit]
Anticosti is off the beaten path. There is no hospital on the island and just one small clinic in Port Menier, so in some areas the nearest help of any kind is over 160 km (100 miles) away. The island has also been the site of hundreds of shipwrecks over the years.
Watch for wildlife when driving. Deer are plentiful even in the village and can do substantial damage in a collision, while hitting a moose can be deadly.

Connect[edit]
There is no mobile telephone infrastructure on the island. There are a few Telus and Bell (4G LTE/5G) base stations on the mainland in Havre-Saint-Pierre while Rogers has almost no coverage at all.
