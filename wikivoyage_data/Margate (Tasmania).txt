Margate is a town of 4,239 (2021) in the Greater Hobart region in southern Tasmania, and is one of the northernmost towns along the D'Entrecasteux Channel. The town is eight kilometers southwest of Kingston and 20 km from Hobart, the state capital.
The town is home to the Channel Museum, which is one of the few remnants of Margate's historic past as much of the town was burned in the 1967 bushfires. Another historical remnant is the Margate Train (depicted in banner), which is a train that contains various retail businesses within its carriages.
