Downtown Vermillion
Vermillion is a city in South Dakota with about 11,500 people in 2023, known for being the home of University of South Dakota.


Understand[edit]
Vermillion was founded in 1859. The name refers to the Lakota name: wa sa wak pa'la (red stream). Vermillion has a mixed academic and rural character: the university is a major academic institution for the state, with its only law and medical schools and its only AACSB-accredited business school. Major farm products include corn, soybeans, and alfalfa.

History[edit]
Lewis and Clark camped at the mouth of the Vermillion River near the present-day town on August 24, 1804. The previous day, they had killed their first bison; the following day, they climbed Spirit Mound. In May 1843, John James Audubon visited the Vermillion ravine to view the bird life. 
The original town was entirely below the bluffs on the banks of the Missouri River, and three-quarters of it washed away in the Great Flood of 1881.
William Jennings Bryan and William Howard Taft—candidates for the U.S. Presidency in the 1908 election—spoke in Vermillion on September 28 and 29, 1908, respectively. Along with Eugene Chafin, they toured South Dakota by train, including stops in Mitchell, Tripp, Yankton, and Elk Point.
