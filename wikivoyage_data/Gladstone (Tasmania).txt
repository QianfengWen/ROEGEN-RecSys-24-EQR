 Walking. There are a few old churches and miners' cottages in Gladstone. The town cemetery contains graves of pioneering families and Chinese miners from the 1880s. There are pleasant walks through the bush at the bottom of Chaffey Street, also numerous trails in the area between Fly By Night Creek (off Waterhouse Road) and the Mt Cameron Fire Trail (off Gladstone Road).
