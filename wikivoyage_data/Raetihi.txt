Raetihi is a small town 11 km from the neighbouring town of Ohakune in the Ruapehu District of the central North Island of New Zealand. Near the beautiful Tongariro National Park, it boasts amazing views of the three sacred volcanoes of Ruapehu, Tongariro and Ngauruhoe, and is a base for skiing and hiking in the park.


Understand[edit]
A clubhouse in Raetihi
Formerly a forestry milling town, tourists now flock to the region to explore the outdoors in all seasons. Accommodation in ski season is usually a little cheaper than in the ski centres. Differing from neighbouring towns, Raetihi has many activities outside of the ski season, including the infamous Raetihi Gutbuster bike/run/walk.

Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
Intercity has a daily service from Auckland and from Palmerston North. You can use this for the ten-minute trip from Ohakune.
