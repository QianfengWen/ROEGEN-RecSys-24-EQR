Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Burnie Airport (BWT) is located in Wynyard, around 2 minutes from the village centre. Rex Airlines flies four times a day in and out of Wynyard. The fares are usually for around $160 per person, each way but can get up to $350 if you get caught out with a full plane. Plane services also operate to and from King Island with Sharp Airlines.

By car[edit]
Wynyard is around a 15-minute drive from Burnie and around a 50 minute drive from Smithton. Cars can also be hired from Wynyard Airport.

Get around[edit]
Wynyard has one of the four interstate airports for Tasmania. Also at the airport are hire cars and scenic flights.
Metro Tasmania busses and Redline busses operate in and around Wynyard. These busses connect to other towns such as Somerset and Burnie but also larger towns such as Launceston and Hobart (this is on the Redline service). However, like most of Tasmania, travelling by car is the fastest, easiest and most convenient form of transport.
