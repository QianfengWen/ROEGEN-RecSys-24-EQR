Cikampek is a town and district in the North Coast region of Western Java, Indonesia.


Understand[edit]
Cikampek is a district in the east of Karawang regency, about 20 km east of the regency capital Karawang. Cikampek is well known, because it is at the junction of three major toll roads: the Jakarta-Cikampek toll road to Jakarta in the west, the Cipularang toll road to Bandung in the south, and the Cipali toll road to Cirebon in the east. Similarly, Cikampek is also on a junction of railroads. While Cikampek is in the flat lands of West Java's northern coast region, it is a point of entrance into the mountainous area to the south.

Get in[edit]
Being at a junction of motorways and railroads, Cikampek is very well connected.

By car[edit]
The Jakarta-Cikampek toll road, just west of Cikampek.
The town of Cikampek is just north of the Cikampek interchange. The Jakarta-Cikampek toll road to the west leads to Karawang (15 km), Bekasi (53 km), and Jakarta (65 km). The same toll road continues east, then named Cipali and later Palikanci toll road, to Subang (37 km), Cirebon (130 km), and Central Java (164 km to the provincial border). The Cipularang toll road (also called Purbaleunyi) leads in southern direction to Purwakarta (18 km), Cimahi (65 km) and Bandung (72 km). In addition to the toll roads, the major "North Coast Route" (Jalur Pantura) trunk road leads in northeastern direction from Cikampek to Pamanukan (40 km) and Indramayu (108 km).

The -6.40721107.456711 Cikampek railway station is on the eastern side of the town. There are six daily economy class trains to Jakarta, of which one continues to the port of Merak. In the other directions, these trains go to either Purwakarta, or as a long-distance train to Central and/or East Java. In addition, there are three daily business/executive class trains to Bandung, and in the other direction to Cirebon (one per day continues to Semarang and Surabaya).
The smaller Dawuan railway station on the western side of the town is served a few times per day by economy class trains between Jakarta and Purwakarta.

There is no bus terminal in Cikampek, but many bus companies pick up and drop passengers at the toll road exit -6.44043107.478632 Cikampek toll gate (East Cikampek / Cikopo). There are very frequent buses to and from Leuwi Panjang bus terminal in Bandung and several bus terminals in Jakarta, and also regular buses to other cities including Bekasi, Tasikmalaya, Bogor, Cirebon, and Sumedang. There are also elf minivans to smaller nearby towns such as Pamanukan and Purwakarta.
