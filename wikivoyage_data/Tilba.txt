Tilba is in the Eurobodalla region of New South Wales.  There are two villages named Tilba: the picturesque village of Central Tilba, which is what "Tilba" usually refers to, and the even smaller Tilba Tilba, 2 km away by the river of the same name.


Understand[edit]
Colourful shops in Central Tilba
Tilba's pipsqueak population is under 400, but on a good day this beautifully preserved rural village, nestled on a hill surrounded by lush green fields, draws more than that many visitors who come to gawk at its colourful houses and browse its boutiques.

Map of Tilba
Both Tilbas are just off the Princes Highway, around 10 km south of Narooma, 10 km north of Bermagui and 60 km north of Bega.

Get around[edit]
Tilba is easily covered on foot.  The hardest part is really finding a place to park, since the car parks are small and often at capacity, particularly around lunchtime.
