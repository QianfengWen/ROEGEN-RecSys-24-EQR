Understand[edit]
Once on the frontier between the Anglo-Saxons and Danes, it has a charter dating back more than 900 years. It is an important shopping centre, and there are also many pubs and bars. There good ethnic restaurants, reflecting the town's substantial Italian, Indian, Pakistani, and Polish communities. Bedford has also been heralded for having a wide range of ethnic diversity. The Embankment along the River Ouse running through the centre of town is an attractive place for a walk, and once a year is given over to a traditional Regatta. On the picturesque town bridge is a memorial to John Bunyan, who wrote The Pilgrim's Progress here, and who was imprisoned there. Bunyan lived in Bedford for most of his life, and his life can be seen at the John Bunyan Museum in the town, which also has a statue dedicated to him. There is a large and attractive park with tennis courts, and other niceties north of the town centre (Bedford Park).

Visit Bedford
Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
52.136389-0.4794441 Bedford station is served by East Midlands Railway, London Northwestern Railway, and Thameslink. Travel from London St. Pancras International takes about 40 minutes by East Midlands Railway and just over an hour if you take the Thameslink. Thameslink trains are slower as they are primarily commuter services. East Midlands Railway services only stop at a couple of stations between Bedford and London.
There is also a minor railway line going west to Bletchley (near Milton Keynes). Bedford's second train station (Bedford St. John's) is only used by Bletchley trains, whereas all trains arriving in Bedford end up in the main Bedford station sooner or later.
East Midlands Railway go north to Nottingham and beyond.

By bus[edit]
Bedford has a reasonably large 52.137506-0.4713282 bus station located in the centre of town, however there are few long-distance services. The bus station and Midland train station are about 800 m apart, so it's a maximum 10-min walk if you need to make a change here.
Bedford is on the X5 bus route between Oxford, Milton Keynes and Cambridge. Buses generally leave every half hour.

By road[edit]
Bedford lies directly between the M1 and A1 motorways. Park and Ride facilities are available see, National Park and Ride Directory

Get around[edit]

The local bus services around Bedford are terrible, being both infrequent and expensive. Just about everything you'd want to see is within easy walking distance of the high street, however (at most 30 minutes if you're slow), so there's little need for anything more than your feet in good weather.
There's a reasonable but underused shuttle bus leaving the central train station, and the bus service to surrounding villages is excellent.
There are very few provisions for cyclists, though the town centre is pedestrianised. The one way system and endless traffic lights around the centre make for fun riding until you get to know the roads. Reasonably wide roads mean you don't get squeezed off too often.
Taxis are relatively expensive in Bedford and you may expect to queue for some time at town centre taxi ranks. It is usually faster and cheaper to call for a licenced minicab rather than waiting in line.

Buy[edit]
In shopping terms, Bedford is quite typical for a town of its size. The centre of town has the normal chain stores. There is a small indoor shopping centre, the Harpur Centre, and one dingy end of it is called the Howard Centre. The central spiral walkway between the two levels of the centre is named The Hub and is, apparently, "the place to be seen".
Having been the region's market town, Bedford has a market every Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday with various tradespeople and stalls. Bargains of all kinds can be found here, along with local produce. The market is split between Harpur Square and St. Paul's square.
