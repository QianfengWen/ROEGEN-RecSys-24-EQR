Puerto Princesa is the capital of the island province of Palawan. The city has been acclaimed several times as the cleanest and greenest city in the Philippines. With a wide range of attractions ranging from beaches to wildlife reserves, Puerto Princesa is a nature lover's paradise.


Understand[edit]
There is a tourist information office at the airport next to the arrival hall, but it's not that useful. They will try to sell you tours, but they do not have any maps (Feb 2018) and they do not give any information about current events in the city. They do not book accommodation, either.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
9.742222118.7586111 Puerto Princesa International Airport (PPS  IATA), National Highway, San Miguel.   
The airport has undergone a makeover, which involves the construction of a new modern terminal, which can handle domestic and international flights. The new terminal opened in 2017, while the older terminal is closed indefinitely for renovation. Boarding and alighting is still done on the ground.
The airlines with flights to Puerto Princesa are:

Philippine Airlines, Cebu Pacific, Air Asia all have daily flights from Manila, Cebu, and Clark to Puerto Princesa.
Cebu Pacific also operate flights to and from Iloilo.
Tiger Air Taiwan operate flights to and from Taipei.
Air Juan flies to Busuanga, Cuyo, Sipalay, San Vicente.
Eastar Jet operate flights to and from Seoul.
The airport is not far from downtown, so you can ignore the overpriced tricycles waiting in front of the airport terminal and catch a tricycle on the highway for a fare of ₱50. Jeepneys also go along the highway in front of the airport to town or to the bus terminal for ₱10.

By ferry[edit]
2GO Travel has two weekly ferries to Puerto Princesa from Manila. The ferry trip is about 22 hours long. Additionally, Milagrosa Shipping has a weekly ferry that sails between Puerto Princesa - Cuyo Islands - Iloilo City. It departs Iloilo at 7PM on Thursday, arrives at the Cuyo Islands at 8AM Friday, departs Cuyo Islands 3PM Friday and arrives in Puerto Princesa at 8AM on Saturday.
Ferries docks at 9.742476118.7287372 Puerto Princesa port, at the far western end of Rizal Ave.

By bus or van[edit]
9.78407118.744973 Puerto Princesa Grand Terminal (San Jose Terminal), Tagburos. A bustling large terminal complex serving buses, vans, and jeepneys coming from most points of Palawan. Buses depart from a large shelter near the San Jose public market, and vans (UV Express) depart from scattered terminals nearby. The surrounding area has small shops, a small supermarket, and a public market. (updated Feb 2020)
Bus service to Puerto Princesa is provided by two major operators, Cherry and RORO Bus, but there are also operators which use smaller vehicles (often rebuilt from old trucks) and are cramped and not air-conditioned.

Bus companies[edit]
 Cherry Transport. Has trips every two hours between Puerto Princesa and El Nido from 4AM to 10PM. They operate a fully air-conditioned fleet, and a one-way trip costs ₱500. (updated Jan 2024)
 RORO Bus. Has four hourly trips from 5-8AM between Puerto Princesa and El Nido. They operate a mix of ordinary and air-conditioned buses with a yellow-green livery. One-way trip from El Nido costs ₱395 (₱445 on ordinary). (updated Feb 2020)
According to locals the San Jose terminal has stopped operating a couple of weeks ago. Instead, take a local bus on the main road to Irawan terminal (₱30 per perdon as of Jan 2023) and you will be able to take buses to places all over Palawan from there - there’s a bus to Port Barton at around 8:45AM (₱300 as of 0Han 2023)

Get around[edit]
9°45′0″N 118°45′0″EMap of Puerto Princesa
Jeepneys, multicabs and tricycles are the most common means to get around Puerto Princesa. As in Manila, jeepneys usually have standard routes which they ply. Tricycles on the other hand are fairly limited to certain areas and would not be able to go very long distances. Standard jeepney and tricycle fare around the city is ₱10 per person.
The bus terminal is a few kilometers outside the city centre. A jeepney from the bus terminal to downtown should cost ₱10.
For touring, it could be a good idea to arrange special transport whether it be a jeepney or, for more comfort, air-conditioned vans or AUVs. This way, you will not be subject to the hassles of public transport availability.
Although "clean and green" Puerto Princesa City has a bold plan for introducing electric vehicles, the city has no published or announced plan that addresses the urgent needs of pedestrians and bicycle riders. There are few pedestrian  crossings in the city and most Puerto Princesa drivers do not yield to pedestrians, leaving them stranded dangerously in the middle of the street. If, in order to protect yourself from the vehicles and smoke, you can take an air-con van, but you only add to the overall traffic and pollution problem. Tourist vans and other vehicles are often parked along Rizal Avenue and other main streets blocking where pedestrians and bicycles could once safely move, but no longer can. If you wish to walk or bike in a clean, green, and safe environment in the downtown area, you should ask at the tourist office (at the airport) where such an area exists, and see what they say.

See[edit]
Sabang Beach
A trip to the subterranean river
10.166667118.9166671 Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park (Underground River). At over 8 km in length, it is claimed to be the longest underground river in the world. With its crystalline waters and spectacular cave formations, the Underground River is possibly Puerto Princesa's most popular attraction. The site was also declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1999. The winding path of the river is navigable via small pumpboats that depart from Sabang Beach. Travel time from the city proper to Sabang is about 1.5 hours (This can take closer to 3.5 if you choose to ride in a Jeepney, since you have to wait while they deliver goods along the journey.) A permit is now necessary to visit the underground river and only available in Puerto Princesa, though an online system is in construction. As of 2018, you can purchase the tickets in Sabang pier: if you do it yourself it will cost you around ₱600, if you do it through your accommodation they might overcharge you up to ₱1200. You can also ask if you can make the return trip trekking the park and the jungle: you will need to get a guide to do that but the experience is worth your time and money. 600PHP.   (updated Jul 2018)
The beautiful island of Luli in Honda Bay
9.9118.7833332 Honda Bay. Consisting of several islets with beautiful beaches, Honda Bay is the place to go to for swimming, snorkeling as well as beach and island hopping. Accessible via the Sta.

Arrive before 11AM to go island hopping if you require a small boat (1-5 people) and before 2:30PM if you require a larger boat.   (updated Jul 2018)
9.744722118.6609833 Iwahig Penal Colony. A good example of a true correctional institute, the Iwahig Penal Colony is more of a farming community rather than a prison. Inmates often live with their families and are allowed to toil their farms to earn a living. Carving out handicrafts is also a common preoccupation and mahogany handcarvings are a good buy for tourists. The colony is about 35 minutes from the city center.  (updated Jul 2018)
9.799673118.6931574NOT EXISTING LISTING IMAGE Palawan Wildlife Rescue and Conservation Center. Formerly the Crocodile Farming Institute, and still referred to by locals as the "Crocodile Farm," is a tourist attraction and a national research institute devoted to crocodiles. About 30 to 40 minutes from the city center, the Croc Farm also has a mini-zoo, which features some of Palawan's endemic species of wildlife. The place is open from about 8:30AM to about 4:30PM. From Rizal Avenue you can take an 8-person covered pickup truck (labeled "Irawan") for ₱20 and the Croc Farm is the last stop; a tricycle carrying only one or two people will cost ₱100-150. Croc Farm Tickets cost ₱40 for adults and ₱20 for kids. You start with a guided tour of the crocs which last about 15 minutes. After that you wonder around by yourself in the endemic species area, where you have to be careful not to fall through a few rotton and crumbling wooden bridges. Although this is not the best managed wildlife area, the endemic species are nonetheless worth seeing and deserve your support. (updated Jul 2018)
