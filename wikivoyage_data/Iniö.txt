Iniö[dead link] is a former municipality, in the Archipelago Sea in south-west Finland. It consists of a group of four main islands and over one thousand minor ones. Ten islands have permanent residents, most people living on Iniölandet. Before the merger, Iniö was the smallest municipality in Finland excluding Åland, with just 250 inhabitants. Now this title belongs to Luhanka in Central Finland.


Understand[edit]
Iniö archipelago
Iniö is located in the Archipelago Sea and people have traditionally lived from fishing, agriculture, sea fowl hunting and seafaring. It belongs to the Pargas municipality, with its centre in Pargas.
Most people live on the main island, Iniölandet. Another important island is Jumo, as Kannvik ferry harbour is located there. These two islands are connected by a road ferry and the main road runs through them. Minor inhabited islands, some with just a few families, are connected to the mainland with regular ferry services.
There are some archaeological findings from the bronze age. First permanent inhabitants have probably been Swedish speaking fishermen during the early medieval period. The name Iniö appears first in 1554 as a chapel under Taivassalo parish.
Iniö is traditionally Swedish speaking and still has a Swedish speaking majority. Service is usually available in both Swedish and Finnish, as well as in English.

Get in[edit]
See also: Archipelago Trail
The Ring Road ferry M/S Aurora runs only during the summer season.
Iniö is on the Archipelago Trail from Turku via Houtskär to Iniö and back to Turku via Kustavi. This is a tourist route mostly targeted at bikers and motorists, but possible to complete by bus and foot.
Iniö can be reached only by boat or ferry. It is connected to other parts of the municipality only during the summer months, except some sparse and convoluted connections. The year-round ferry operates between Iniö and Kustavi in the north. The main village, Norrby, is on the east coast of Iniölandet, some 7 km from the Kannvik ferry jetty and 4 km from the Dalen ferry jetty. The road is paved and is in good condition to both directions.

From Kustavi[edit]
Kustavi is north-east of Iniö.
Road ferry M/S Aura[dead link] operates year-round between Heponiemi in Kustavi and 60.439221.39571 Kannvik in Iniö. See the timetables. The ferry is free of charge and has a café. There is a café in Kannvik but no services but dry toilets in Heponiemi.
There are coaches from Turku to Heponiemi in Kustavi twice a day (about €14, children 4–11 half price). Check the timetables at Matkahuolto. Use Laupunen laituri Heponiemi as your destination in the Matkahuolto search. The bus is operated by Taivassalon Auto. M/S Aura takes you to Kannvik in Iniö.

From Houtskär[edit]
Houtskär is south of Iniö, reachable by the Skärgårdsvägen road across several of the main islands in the Archipelago Sea, with several ferry passages. Korpo on this route has a ferry connection also from Åland.
The Ring Road (Archipelago Trail) ferry M/S Antonia operates four to five times daily during the summer season (in 2022: 13 May to 4 September) between Mossala in Houtskär and 60.381621.37172 Dalen in Iniö (see the timetables). Transport fees: adult €10, children (4–11) €5, bicycles €12, MC/moped €25, car €40, and campervan or caravan €75. The fees for vehicles include all passengers. The ferry has a small café. There is a restaurant in Mossala but no services in Dalen.
There is a coach from Turku to Houtskär (about €23). The coach from Turku leaves you in the Galtby ferry harbour and another coach is waiting in Kittuis ferry harbour in Houtskär. Changing coaches actually means a 30 min ferry trip here! In Houtskär the terminus is usually Näsby, but some services extend all the way to the Mossala village. From the Mossala village there is 3 km left to Mossala ferry jetty (12 km from Näsby). The coach connection is operated by TLO using the Skärgårdsbuss brand with white-green livery. Use Mossala (Parainen) as your destination in Matkahuolto search. M/S Antonia takes you to Dalen in Iniö.
There is a good bike route from Turku to Pargas. Some kilometres after the Pargas centre it gets narrow and starts going up and down any hill, but  it continues to Lillmälö. In Nagu, Korpo, and Houtskär you mostly have to cope with the road traffic. It is a good strategy to get off when the batch of cars from a ferry is approaching. Otherwise there is very little traffic on these roads. Stay to the right as the local drivers really don't expect a bicyclist after the next turn...

From Brändö[edit]
Brändö in north-eastern Åland is west of Iniö, across Skiftet. It has ferry connections to the mainland of Åland. It is also connected by a ferry to Kustavi.
The route Mariehamn–Brändö–Kustavi–Iniö is straight forward, although there are several ferry passages and the timetable has to be planned to match. Bikers need to check the road leg in Brändö. See Brändö.
It is also possible to come directly from Torsholma in Brändö, with the sparse-schedule ferry M/S Satava, serving many islands. See Brändö and Get around below.

The Skagen road ferry between the islands Iniölandet and Jumo runs when needed.
The nearby island Keistiö is connected by scheduled road ferry from Dalen. See the timetables here. From Kannvik there is also a small road ferry to some of the minor islands including Åselholm.
Many smaller islands are served by the ship-like ferry M/S Kivimo, departing from Norrby/Kannvik harbour with timetables and routes differing depending on day of week. The complete route takes several hours. This vessel goes all the way to Torsholma in Brändö, Åland. The timetable' is fairly complex, and in most cases the ferry must be ordered at least one day in advance. Contact the vessel by phone (☏ +358 40-849-5140) and ask. The similar Houtskär route (timetable May–December 2022) reaches Iniö and can likewise be used both to get in and to reach some remote islands.
