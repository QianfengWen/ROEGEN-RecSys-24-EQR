Stow is in Summit County, Northeast Ohio. It is rather disorganized, but you're probably going to pass through it is you're going from Akron to Cleveland or vice-versa, and you won't get lost if you're just passing through.


Understand[edit]
Residents of Stow are sometimes known as "stowbillies" by neighboring communities, especially rival Hudson. However, while not as upper-class as Hudson, Stow is an affluent suburban community.
