South Paterson is home to one of the nation's largest Arab communities.


Understand[edit]
Paterson was the nation's first planned industrial city. It was established in 1791. The Paterson falls were a key element in the success of Paterson as the industrial leader of the nation during this time. The 77-foot falls' power was harnessed and provided power for the many industries in Paterson. Paterson was a rich city and enjoyed success throughout the late 1700s, 1800s and early 1900s (up until the 1950s). Paterson was nicknamed the silk city for its dominant role in the production in silk during the mid 1800s.
The city began to decline during the 1960s and 1970s was due to several factors. Many industries during this time began moving to the Midwest, and at the same time, many African Americans were moving into the city from the south. Factories were closing at the same time African Americans moved in looking for employment. Many white residents began leaving the city due to the declining economy. The opening of malls in nearby Paramus and Wayne also took away significant business from the city's downtown shopping district.
With a crippled economy and high unemployment rate, Paterson was becoming a ghetto. During the 1980s, crime increased significantly in the city. Crime rates dropped in the 1990s, but still remain high. There are many efforts underway to help revive the city. Despite the city's bad reputation, high crime rates, and poverty, there are a lot of places to go and things to do in this city. The city is very diverse and contains a very high population of Hispanics of all nationalities, African Americans, Italian Americans, South Asians and Arabs. There are numerous parks, ethnic places to eat, shop, hang out, and see.

The tallest waterfall in New Jersey and the second largest by volume east of the Mississippi River (behind Niagara Falls). These falls were what helped Paterson grow as the first planned industrial city in the U.S. The falls provided power for the city at one time. The Great Falls today are part of a state park, but the feel is of a municipal park, with people of all hues enjoying the views, picnicking in good weather, and vendors selling items like good Latino ices. You can easily walk a half mile or more within the park, and it's worth doing so to see views of different parts of the falls and experience their immensity. Beware that parking can be scarce, so if you plan to arrive by car, allow extra time. Free admission, free parking.   (updated Jan 2021)

Stay safe[edit]
Though Paterson has a reputation of being a crime-ridden city, it is not all doom and gloom as many suburbanites would suggest. In fact, Paterson's crime rate is comparable to that of mid-sized Midwestern cities, such as Grand Rapids, Michigan.  That said, one should exercise ordinary caution when visiting the city. Most of the crime in Paterson is in certain sections: Wrigley Park (4th Ward), Northside, and parts of Riverside, Totowa Section and Sandy Hill. It is best to avoid drug areas such as the 4th Ward or Northside. Most crime in Paterson is said to be drug related. Areas such as Downtown, Eastside Park, the Manor Section, and the Falls District have little to no crime, but it is still wise to keep a watchful eye and call the police if you feel threatened.
