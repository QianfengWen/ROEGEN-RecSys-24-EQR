Arcata is a city in the North Coast of California. Arcata is a small university town on the north end of Humboldt Bay. It is well known for its hippie counter culture, progressive politics, and vegetarian restaurants. Arcata is the perfect place to relax while enjoying fresh air, the ocean, and the tallest trees on Earth. The pace of things is quite calm here, with usually as many bicyclists or people on foot as cars go by. 


Understand[edit]
Sometimes referred to as being "behind the Redwood Curtain", Arcata has a unique culture that prides itself on all things alternative, and on localism and self-reliance above most everything else.
Due to its tolerant residents, Arcata attracts a large transient population. Most of these people are harmless "dharma bums". Expect to be asked for change every so often, but don't feel pressured to give any.

Walk a little further to visit Cal Poly Humboldt, the Arcata Community Forest, or the Arcata Marsh. A remarkable walking experience would be walking in the Community Forest alongside The Jolly Giant stream. Remember respecting Nature, it's precious here!

See[edit]
Every Saturday morning in the spring, summer, and fall there is a farmers market on the central plaza.
People-watching on the Plaza is always a popular choice. Feel free to kick back on the grass and view a cross-section of the people who make Arcata Arcata!
Arcata is filled with vintage Victorian homes that are well cared for. Drive through the streets of Arcata for a tour.
Right behind the university is the Arcata Community Forest.  If you see one thing in Arcata, this should be it.  The transition from the university housing to a rainforest filled with ferns, rare birds and other animals, and crisscrossing footpaths along and over wooded streams coursing around older-than-ancient redwood trees, is truly awe-inspiring.

Drink[edit]
Night life[edit]
Arcata's nightlife is condensed into a few square blocks, which is great because you can bar hop without ever having to drive your car; the police like this as well.
