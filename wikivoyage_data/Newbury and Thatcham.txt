River Kennet at Newbury
Thatcham High Street
Newbury and Thatcham are adjoining towns in the county of Berkshire, in the South East of England.
Newbury is the principal town in the west of the county, and is a historic market town. Thatcham is a dormitory town some three miles to the east, with little obvious boundary between the two towns.


Understand[edit]
Newbury has a population of about 42,000 (2018) and is something of a booming company town as it houses the world headquarters of Vodafone, a major mobile phone operator with operations in many countries.
Newbury also attracted a lot of national and international coverage in the 1980s when it was the scene of the Greenham Common Peace camp in protest at the stationing of nuclear armed cruise missiles at a nearby air base, and in the 1990s when it hosted perhaps the most famous road protest against the Newbury bypass. The vast majority of the population probably did not appreciate either campaign.
Thatcham is best known as England's fastest growing town, with large housing areas being built to house a population which largely commutes to work in Newbury, Reading or London.
Visitors may hear both the terms 'Newbury District' and 'West Berkshire' in use; these are effectively synonymous and refer to the town of Newbury and its surrounding rural area. They are also the old and new names for the local government which runs the area that includes Newbury and Thatcham.
Newbury is the birthplace of Michael Bond, the author who was best known for creating the beloved children's character Paddington Bear.

By train[edit]
Newbury and Thatcham have rail stations on the main line from London to Exeter, Plymouth and Penzance.

Local trains stop at both stations and run from Reading approximately every half hour taking some 20 to 30 minutes for the journey; some local trains start their journeys in London. From London, travel from London Paddington Station and, if necessary, change at Reading.

By foot[edit]
The central area of Newbury is easily walkable.

By bus[edit]
There are several town routes within Newbury and Thatcham, with hourly (or better) services during the day, and infrequent service in the evenings and on Sundays. Beyond that distance, bus routes are much less frequent, with often only a handful of buses per day and no evening or Sunday service.

Traveline, ☏ 0876 082 608 (domestic), provide an impartial online travel planner and telephone query service for local bus services.
51.399-1.32341 Newbury Bus Station, Market St, Newbury RG14 5DP. Newbury Buses run services throughout the Newbury, Thatcham and surrounding rural areas. A regular service to Reading is also operated. There is one National Express bus a day from here to London. All buses leave or terminate from the Market Street Bus Station which can be found on the south side of the canal, adjacent to the Kennet Shopping Centre. (updated May 2017)
By car[edit]
Newbury's roads can be congested at peak periods, but in general are less congested than London or even Reading. A car is one (possibly along with cycling) of the only really practical ways of seeing a lot of the local countryside and villages.

By map[edit]
If you are planning to do any visiting or exploring beyond central Newbury, you will probably want to obtain a decent map of the area. You should ensure that any map you buy clearly shows the national grid reference lines, and explains how to use them, as grid references are frequently used to indicate out of town locations. The best maps for this purpose are those published by the Ordnance Survey (Britain's national mapping agency) and both the following maps cover all the locations mentioned below:

Ordnance Survey Explorer 158. This map covers the area around Newbury and Thatcham at a scale of 1:25000 and is best for walking or local touring by car or cycle.
Ordnance Survey Landranger 174. This map covers the area around and between Newbury and Thatcham at a scale of 1:50000 and is best for longer range exploration by car or cycle.
These maps can be found in any good bookshop, or can be bought online from the Ordnance Survey's web site.
