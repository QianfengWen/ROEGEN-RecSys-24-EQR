St. Michael Church remains, Brant
Brockton is a municipality of about 9800 people (2021) in Bruce County, Southwestern Ontario. It includes Walkerton and the villages in the former Brant and Greenock Townships (Bradley, Cargill, Chepstow, Dunkeld, Eden Grove, Glammis, Greenock, Little Egypt, Malcolm, Maple Hill, Narva, Marle Lake, Lake Rosalind, Pearl Lake, Pinkerton, Portal, Riversdale and Solway).


Understand[edit]
The municipality was formed in 1999, by amalgamating the former township of Brant, former township of Greenock and the town of Walkerton. Brockton's name was formed as a portmanteau of the names of three merged municipalities (Brant Greenock Walkerton).
Many Canadians have heard of Walkerton because in May 2000, the water system in Walkerton became contaminated with the highly dangerous E. coli bacteria strain. Nearly half the population fell ill, and seven people died as a result.

Beaches[edit]
Beaches at Port Elgin, Kincardine, Southampton or Sauble Beach offer miles of beautiful sand on the shores of Lake Huron.
Port Elgin features a sand beach and harbour just five blocks west of "downtown" on the warm waters of Lake Huron. At the beach you will find landscaped boardwalks, regular band shell concerts, fishing charter boats and a swimming beach for all ages. There is a flea market every Wednesday during the summer, and a miniature 24-gauge steam train that chugs along the harbour and into the picturesque North Shore Park. Play equipment for the youngsters can be found on the main beach as well as North Shore Park. Several beach shelters offer protection from the sun's bright rays for those who love the beach, but prefer to lounge in the shade. There are also benches facing the lake to watch the sunset.
Kincardine Beach is bisected by the river and marina. The southern beach or Station Beach as it is called features a landscaped boardwalk with benches and a gazebo. Giant beach chairs make a great photo opportunity. From the north side of the Pier to Saugeen Street, this small stretch of beach is great for children. Tiny Tot Park, the Snack Bar, washrooms, a covered picnic area (at Dunsmoor Park), lots of shade trees, the Rock Gardens, the Pavilion and Lovers Lane add to the ambiance of this part of the beach.
Southampton Beach features Family Fun Nights each Friday in the sheltered picnic area. Swing sets dot the beach and, of course, kids (large and small) have to stop and try out each one! Benches line the "boardwalk" for sunset viewing and star gazing.
Sauble Beach's over 11 km of pure, golden sands embrace the clean, warm waters of Lake Huron.

Canoe and kayaking[edit]
The Saugeen River is one of the best canoe routes in Southern Ontario. Winding 102 km through the scenic countryside and pretty "small-town Ontario", the Saugeen River stretches from Hanover to Southampton, where it empties into Lake Huron.
Local outfitters include Thorncrest Outfitters.

Sailing, power boating and lake fishing[edit]
Nearby Port Elgin and Kincardine have deep water harbours and marinas with launch ramps and slips available for transient boaters.
In Port Elgin, the harbour is situated next to the large sand beach, 5 blocks from downtown. The harbour-beach area features landscaped boardwalks, regular band shell concerts, a flea market every Wednesday during the summer, and a miniature 24-gauge steam train that chugs along the harbour and into the picturesque North Shore Park. Then, around the last week of July and first week of August, fisherman from all over come to enter the "CFPS Chantry Chinook Fishing Classic" fishing derby.
Kincardine's harbour stands in the shadow of the lighthouse, famous for the tranquil sounds of the Phantom Piper, which can be heard during July and August, as the sun is serenaded to sleep from atop the lighthouse. The marina is  3 blocks from downtown, and next the beach and boardwalks. During the summer, there is a Pipe Band Parade down the main street, each Saturday evening, followed by a free concert in the park. Around mid May, you can enter the Kincardine fishing derby.
