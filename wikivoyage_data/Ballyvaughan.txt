Get in[edit]
The main road is N67, which branches off M18 at Ennis and loops north through Ennistymon and  Lisdoonvarna to 53.118-9.1491 Ballyvaughan then via Kinvarra to Galway.
A slow scenic route is along the cliff tops, northwards branching off N67 at Ennistymon for Lahinch, Liscannor, Cliffs of Moher, Doolin and Fanore to Ballyvaughan. 
Bus 350 follows that slow route from Galway six times a day via Kinvarra, Ballyvaughan, Fanore, Lisdoonvarna, Doolin village and pier, Cliffs of Moher, Liscannor, Lahinch, Ennistymon, Corofin and Inagh to Ennis. This means that by bus or train from Dublin, it's quicker to head for Galway then take the 350 south, than to come via Limerick and Ennis and take the bus north.

See[edit]
Ballyvaughan village and harbour are picturesque.
53.104-9.1691 Burren College of Art puts on occasional exhibitions of student work. They're 2 km south of the village at Newtown Castle.
53.127-9.0542 Corcomroe Abbey is the ruin of an early 13th century Cistercian monastery. The Romanesque church is roofless but otherwise in good condition, with fine carvings. There is the tomb of Conor O'Brien, King of Thomond, plus a neoclassical tomb of 18th or 19th century.
Oughtmama is a quiet lane heading into the hills southeast of the abbey, on the boundary with County Galway. There are three ruined early medieval churches, various cairns and cahirs, and the scraps of Turlough and Finvarra castles. Walk up Turlough Hill for views and the remains of a hill fort.
53.142-8.9263 Dunguaire Castle, just across the boundary in County Galway, is a 16th century tower house. It's primarily an upscale events venue but is sometimes open to tour.
53.049-8.8884 Kilmacduagh, also in County Galway, is a monastery with one of the finest round towers in Ireland, 34.5 m tall.
53.089-9.1445 Aillwee Caves, Ballycahill (On R480). Daily 10AM-5:30PM. Show caves, visit only by guided tour. The caves were used by animals rather than humans, the cave mascot being a young brown bear from 10,000 BC that may have died while hibernating. That date would make it one of the last bears in Ireland before they became extinct. Aillwee also has a Birds of Prey Centre, visit separately or on combi-ticket, with flying displays Oct-Apr at noon and 3PM, May-Sep at noon, 2PM and 4PM. Cave €15, birds of prey €15, combi €22. (updated May 2020)
53.065-9.156 Gleninsheen Wedge Tomb was built circa 2000-3000 BC. A fabulous gold torque was found here, dated to 700 BC; it's now in the National Museum in Dublin.
Poulnabrone dolmen
53.049-9.147 Poulnabrone dolmen is one of the most impressive in Ireland. Three portal stones support a massive capstone - originally they would all have been covered by an earth mound. The remains of 33 adults were found here, dating to 3200-3800 BC. Burial objects (now in Ennis museum) suggest they were high-ranking but their bones indicate a life of hard toil and death before age 40. Open 24 hours, free.
53.042-9.1378 Caherconnell Stone Fort, Caherconnell V95 YK31. Mid-Mar to Oct: daily 10AM-5:30PM. Sturdy limestone ring-fort occupied from 10th-13th century AD, remarkably late for something that looks prehistoric. The centre runs a residential archaeology summer school to teach techniques, and there's also a sheepdog centre with regular demos. Fort €6, sheepdogs €6, combi €10. (updated May 2020)
53.037-9.0769 Carran (An Carn) is a tiny settlement in the wilds of the Burren, best known for its perfumery. The area is dotted with dolmens. 3 km south is the stone fort of Cahercommaun, inhabited in the 8th and 9th centuries.
52.988-9.1410 Leamaneh Castle is a gaunt ruin along R476 the lane between Corofin and Kilfenora. It's unsafe to enter and on private land, so just admire the facade from the lane.
53.154-9.26511 Black Head has a lighthouse amidst the fractured limestone ground. You'll need a map, compass and stout boots to make your way uphill to Cathair Dhun Iorais Iron Age ring fort. You can continue 1.5 km to the summit of Dobhach Bhrainin (318 m), but beware that the sea mist can roll in at any moment, there's no clear trail on the rocky ground, and there are some sheer edges below you.
53.118-9.28612 Fanore is a sandy beach with Atlantic surf.
