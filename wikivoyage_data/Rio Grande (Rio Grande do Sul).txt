Rio Grande is the oldest city in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, the most important port city in the state and has one of the most important maritime ports in Brazil. It's also the former state capital from 1835 to 1845.


Understand[edit]
Rio Grande is situated on the banks of the Lagoa dos Patos, a large lagoon that extends along the coast. The city's strategic location has made it an important port throughout history, playing a significant role in the development of Brazil's maritime trade.
With a population of approximately 200,000, Rio Grande is a relatively smaller city (especially when compared to neighboring Pelotas). This allows visitors to enjoy a more relaxed and authentic Brazilian experience. The city's atmosphere is friendly and welcoming, making it an ideal destination for anyone looking to immerse themselves in the local culture.
