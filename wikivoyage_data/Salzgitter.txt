Salzgitter is a large town in the east of Lower Saxony, about 50 km from Hannover, the capital. It was founded in 1942 by the Nazi government, to serve as a new industrial center for steel production during the war, and stands out as one of only a few German cities to be founded in the 20th century, along with Eisenhüttenstadt and Wolfsburg. The town is made up of some 31 boroughs, spread over 25 km north to south and 19 km east to west.  The population has stood at over 100,000 since gaining its status as a major town in Germany in the 1950s.  Founded on its large deposits of iron ore, it continued producing steel up to the end of the 1980s.  One of the shafts, Konrad, is now a major storage of low level radioactive waste.
