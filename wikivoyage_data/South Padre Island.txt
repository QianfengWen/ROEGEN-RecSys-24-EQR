South Padre Island is a small resort town on the southern tip of Padre Island off the coast of Texas, close to the border with Mexico. It is a popular spring break destination for college students.


Understand[edit]
Incorporated in 1973, it lies just across Laguna Madre from Port Isabel, the bay separating island from mainland. The east side of the island is referred to as the "gulf side" by locals, and the west side, the "bay side".
