Alta Floresta is a city in the Brazilian state Mato Grosso. It's located at the southern edge of the Amazon rain forest and is a popular eco-tourism destination.


Understand[edit]
During the 1980s gold rush, Alta Floresta became a mining ground and quickly grew to over 100.000 inhabitants. As the economic profit of gold mining declined, so did the number of people living here. The current population is estimated under 50.000 (2010). Today, Alta Floresta is diverging economic activities, and ecotourism is one of the focal points for development.

Get in[edit]
Alta Floresta has a rather large airport of its own. From Aeroporto de Alta Floresta, several airlines operate daily flights to many Brazilian cities.
Highway MT-208 connects Alta Floresta to Nova Monte Verde and Nova Bandeirantes.
