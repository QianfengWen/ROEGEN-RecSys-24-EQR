By car[edit]
Somerset is accessible from two Interstate Highways; I-75 to the east and I-65 to the west.

I-75 northbound (from Tennessee and points south): Take the second London exit (exit 41) and head west on Kentucky Route 80 for about 25 miles. The highway runs right into Somerset.
I-75 southbound (from Lexington, Cincinnati, and points north): Take the Mount Vernon/Renfro Valley exit (exit 62) and head south on US 25. Slightly less than a mile from I-75, take Kentucky Route 461; stay on that road for about 18 miles until it dead-ends into Kentucky 80, and turn right. You'll reach the outskirts of Somerset about 6 miles later.
I-65 northbound (from Bowling Green, Nashville, and points south): Take the Cumberland Parkway exit (exit 43) and head east on the Cumberland Parkway for about 100 miles. The parkway, a four-lane controlled-access highway that was built as a toll road but is now free, ends in Somerset.
I-65 southbound (from points north of Louisville): Several routes are available, depending on your tolerance for rural roads. Probably the fastest, though not the shortest in mileage, is to take I-64 east out of Louisville, and then stay on I-75 after the 64/75 split in Lexington. Exit at Mount Vernon as above.
US 27 passes through Somerset, allowing easy access from Lexington, KY and Knoxville, TN (although most travelers from Lexington choose instead to take the I-75/KY 461 route).

By plane[edit]
The closest regional airport is located at Lexington and the closest international airport is located at Louisville.

By boat[edit]
Somerset's primary tourist attraction is Lake Cumblerland, the largest man-made lake by volume east of the Mississippi River. The lake is very popular among boaters, especially houseboat enthusiasts. Several rental services are offered in the area including speedboat, pontoon, jetski, and houseboat rentals. There are several private and public boat docks located throughout the area. These include:

Get around[edit]
Automobiles are the primary method of transportation in Somerset. Many of the businesses are located along US 27, which can lead to congestion, especially during rush hour. If you need to travel from the north side of the city to the south side and wish to avoid the traffic, the KY 914 bypass provides a much faster route. The downtown business district lies a few miles off US 27. It is easily accessible from Highway 80 and Monticello Street. US 27 is only road that connects Somerset and Burnside (Burnside is located on the lake and is home to many marinas, boat docks, etc.
