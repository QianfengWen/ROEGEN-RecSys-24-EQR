Map of Puerto Limón
See[edit]
Puerto Limon hosts a wide range of awesome Caribbean buildings and several national heritage monuments like the first Baptist church from 1880s and the Black Star Line Building.  

9.99209-83.025931 United Fruit Headquarters (Almacenes y oficinas centrales de Compañía Bananera de Costa Rica). Relic of bygone days, the two-story building was completed in 1904 with a steel roof. It stands at the NW corner of Calle Tomás Guardia and Avenida Federico Fernández Oreamuno (Ruta 32). It typifies new Anglo-Caribbean designs to cope with the tropical climate by maximizing ventilation with multiple doors and roof lanterns while providing protection from the hot sun with deep eaves and wrap-around verandahs. Until 1986 the building also housed the harbormaster's office, the provincial government and the governor's residence. The building was designated historic heritage status in 1999.
