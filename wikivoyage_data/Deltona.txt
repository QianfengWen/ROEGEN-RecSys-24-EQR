Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Originally a planned residential community called "Deltona Lakes," the city has since grown to become larger than many of its Volusia County neighbors, and is in fact the county's largest city by population. Many people who work in Orlando or Daytona Beach live in Deltona.
The city continued to grow during the 2010s, and during this decade a movie theater, a satellite Bethune-Cookman University campus, and a Halifax Health emergency department facility were opened in Deltona.

Climate[edit]
Deltona has a semi-tropical climate, with precipitation highest during the summer, as is common for cities in Central Florida.

Get around[edit]

28.8627-81.24771 Green Springs, 994 Enterprise/Osteen Rd. The springs are just north of Lake Monroe, which is nearly within view. The springs are a component of the underground marine cave below the Florida Peninsula's surface. The springs are green and stink of sulfur, but the manner in which the trees reach above the spring is an interesting sight. The lake is well below the viewing points surrounding it, and it is fenced off. Signs warn against diving into the spring. Free. (updated Oct 2021)
