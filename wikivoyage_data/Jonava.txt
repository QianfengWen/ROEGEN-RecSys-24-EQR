Jonava is a city in the Aukštaitija region of Lithuania, 30 km northeast of Kaunas. In 2023 it had a population of 27,134. 


Understand[edit]
The settlement grew up at a ford in the river Neris; south of the river was the manor house of Skarulių, enlarged into a palace in 1740. The landowner named the settlement Jonas for his son, and this morphed into Jonava. The town was industrial and 80-90% of its population were Jewish, until 1941 when they were wiped out by the Nazis and Lithuanian collaborator police forces.
The modern town is mostly north of the river. The south bank has a huge chemical plant run by Achema AB, who mostly make ammonia fertiliser. In March 1989 the site suffered a leak of 7500 tonnes of ammonia from a ruptured tank, followed by fires, to create a toxic cloud 7 km wide by 50 km long; seven people died. But production continues and the site is a heavy user of gas for energy, accounting for half of Lithuania's consumption. The gas was traditionally from Russia but this supply was lost in 2022, and production was curtailed. In 2023 gas supplies were secured from North Sea countries and full production resumed.
