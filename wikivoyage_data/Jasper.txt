History[edit]
Jasper from Whistler's Mountain.
Jasper National Park Information Centre.
Jasper House was a North West Company fur trade outpost established in 1813 on the York Factory Express trade route to what was then called "New Caledonia" (now British Columbia), and Fort Vancouver in Columbia District on the lower Columbia River. It was later taken oven by the Hudson's Bay Company.
Jasper National Park was established in 1907. The railway siding at the location of the future townsite was established by Grand Trunk Pacific Railway in 1911 and called named Fitzhugh after a Grand Trunk vice president (along the Grand Trunk's "alphabet" line). The Canadian Northern Railway began service to Fitzhugh in 1912. The townsite was surveyed in 1913 by H. Matheson. It was renamed Jasper after the former fur trade post. An internment camp was set up at Dominion Park in Jasper from February 1916 to August 1916.
By 1931, Jasper was accessible by road from Edmonton, and in 1940 the scenic Icefields Parkway opened, connecting Lake Louise and Jasper.

Summers in Jasper are pleasant, with daily highs usually around 21 °C (70 °F) and lows around 7 °C (45 °F). Winters are cold, though may be considered mild by Canadian standards, with daily highs around -2 °C (28 °F) and lows around -12 °C (11 °F), with some nights dipping below zero.
