Understand[edit]
One of several prison units in Huntsville
Huntsville is most famous for its prison facilitiesː the most hard-core criminals in Texas get sent to Huntsville. Huntsville is very much a "company town", with several prison facilities within the city limits (including the Huntsville Unit, home of Texas's "Death Row"), as well as headquarters for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (the only state agency not headquartered in Austin). More than 12% of Huntsville's population is directly employed in the field of criminal corrections. 
Sam Houston State University is the town's second biggest employer. The university is home to about 20,000 students. According to US News, the most popular fields of study are Homeland Security and Law Enforcement.
