Saint-Maurice is a cosy small town in Valais, Switzerland. It looks back on a long history, with the first mention in the year 200 as a Roman outpost. It is famous for its abbey. Its location where the Rhone valley narrows down into a canyon made it an important defence post throughout the history of the town and fortifications from the period of the Second World War and the infamous National Redoubt can still be visited today. 


Get in[edit]
Saint-Maurice
Direct trains with stops at major stations from Geneva and Brig arrive at Saint-Maurice hourly. Regional trains leave half hourly in direction Martigny and Monthey.
Saint-Maurice lies directly on the A9 motorway as well as on the regular main road. As the valley narrows down to below 100 metres, all the roads converge here and you are unlikely to miss the town.
