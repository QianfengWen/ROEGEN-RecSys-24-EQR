Francois (generally pronounced "Franceway", sometimes written François) is a small coastal village in Southern Newfoundland, at the end of a 2-km-long fiord. It is accessible by ferry. In 2016, it had a population of 89. 


Understand[edit]
There is a general store, a post office and a small museum, accessed by concrete pathways and boardwalks.
There is no road to the village, which can only be accessed by boat and helicopter, and snowmobile in the winter.

History[edit]
The community was first settled around 1780, and resisted the government resettlement programs of the mid-20th century. It considered and rejected resettlement again in 2013. 
During the Second World War, some handsome young strangers turned up at the community hall to dance with the local women. The next morning people asked around about the fun-loving strangers and assumed they were Basque fishermen, because their English was rather broken. It turns out they were sailors off a German submarine that had crept into the long fiord to stock up on fresh water from the waterfall.

Get in[edit]
Access to Francois is only by passenger ferry. If the winds are strong, you may end up staying in Francois a day or two longer than you planned. When the ferry is cancelled by weather or malfunction, a helicopter connects Francois to Burgeo.
