Southwold Lighthouse
Southwold is an unspoilt seaside town in Suffolk.


Understand[edit]
Described in the Doomsday Book as a fishing port, over time a shingle bar built-up across the harbour entrance preventing the town becoming a major port. A fire in 1659 severely damaged the town and even today the town has many village greens where some destroyed areas were never rebuilt.
Today the town is well known for the Adnams Brewery which is the town's largest employer.
