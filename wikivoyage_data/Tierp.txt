Tierp developed as a railway town after the 1874 construction of Tierp Train Station along the Uppsala–Gävle railway, and quickly became the main settlement of northern Uppsala County. In the early 17h century northern Uppland was settled by skilled Walloon immigrants, who helped develop the area into a mining and industrial centre, sometimes considered part of Bergslagen. Tierp has remained an industrial centre until this day, and major industries in the settlement include the industrial tools manufacturer Atlas Copco, and Tierps Järnbruk, most famous for producing manhole covers.

60.345217.51391 Tierp Train Station. Tierp's main traveling hub, and really the city's main raison d'etre. (updated May 2019)
Tierp is connected to Uppsala and Gävle by commuter train "Malartag" in partnership with UL. Commuter trains depart from Uppsala every 30 minutes during day time. The journey lasts some 36 minutes and costs 86kr if bought with a travel fund, 96 kr if bought in advance, and cannot be purchased on the train as of Oct 2023. 
Tierp is also a station along Ostkustbanan, run by Sweden's national train operator SJ[dead link], connecting Stockholm in the south with Sundsvall in the north. As a result, travellers who are going north from Uppsala or Stockholm (or south towards them) by train or road are almost certainly passing through Tierp anyway. Some trains from SJ stop at the station, check the SJ timetable for details.

Get around[edit]
Buses to Söderfors take about 20 minutes.
