Padstow
Padstow (Cornish: Lannwedhenek)  is small historic fishing village on the north coast of North Cornwall, famous (and perhaps spoilt) for being the residence of TV celebrity chef Rick Stein.  The town has expanded greatly, become very up market and expensive, and lost its old-fashioned fishing village character, due the crowds who come because of the fame it has gained by featuring on television.  Do not let this put you off, it is still a beautiful town to visit (although many now describe it as Cornish London).


Get in[edit]
By road[edit]

The nearest airport is 50.440833-4.9952781 Newquay Airport (NQY IATA), which has daily flights to London Stansted, London Gatwick and London Luton. When departing from Newquay Airport be prepared to pay £5 extra tax, which will go towards the extension of the terminal building. There are international flights only from Ireland and Germany, so you might have to change planes.

Take a train to Bodmin Parkway (you may have to change trains at Plymouth), there are several of these a day.  There are bus connections from Bodmin to Padstow.  The timetables of these buses are designed to fit around the big trains arriving.
