View of Lido's Piazzale S.M. Elisabetta
If you are staying in Venice and wish to avoid the more touristy and expensive areas, along with the accompanying noise, Lido is an under-appreciated gem.  Trendier and more residential than traditional Venice, it still offers small canals, a variety of dining and impressive views of the city from across the Lagoon. At times it feels reminiscent of Palm Beach, Florida, with its upscale homes, historic architecture and its easy, island feel.
Around 17:00 the atmosphere is decidedly local as professionally dressed Lido residents funnel back home from work across the lagoon. Many of the local bars and eateries have that "where everybody knows your name" family feel, lending an insider's view to life on Lido. Residents embrace, chat enthusiastically and watch each other's children.
Lido is the beach of Venice. This island shelters the lagoon from the Adriatic Sea, and is famous for its Movie Festival which is held every year between the end of August and the first week of September. In 1920 it was the most important beach in Italy, due to its aristocratic atmosphere (still present today). Here Thomas Mann wrote A Death in Venice and it was shot in Visconti's 1972 movie (inspired by the book). Some of the scenes of The English Patient were shot here as well (inside The Hotel Des Bains, one of the most important buildings, erected in Liberty Style). A scene from Casino Royale (Daniel Craig, 2006) was shot here as well. The British travel writer Robin Saikia's book, The Venice Lido, gives a lively overview of the Lido's literary and social history from ancient times to the present day.


Get in[edit]

After arriving in Venice via the Aeroporto Marco Polo, find the Alilaguna waterbus station, a short walk after exiting the airport and turning left. Follow the signs. The boat will take you over to Lido with just a few stops, but does take at least 30 minutes to navigate the airport channels.
If already in Venice, take an ACTV waterbus/vaporetto, which takes about 10 minutes. Venice travel cards are valid to/from Venice, but not to/from the airport as it is run by a different company. If staying on Lido a travel card is worth the investment. Avoid "rush hour" times of day such as early morning and late afternoon when many residents and children are crowding the platform. Also, be careful to avoid local vaporetti which are designated "for residents only."

Get around[edit]
Map of Venice/Lido
There are three main bus lines (A, B, C) and a night bus (N). On Openstreetmap all bus stops are visible. But they are not shown in the actv timetables. Busline A goes towards south. Busline B towards north. Always coming from SME. So if you are there the first time its the best to ask the bus driver where to leave and give him the hotel name.

Do[edit]
 Venice International Film Festival. Attend the annual film festival, the oldest of its kind. It is organized by La Biennale di Venezia and usually takes place around late August or early September. Make your reservations early as the island is small and hotels fill up. Many celebrities attend this annual event, so have your camera ready. (updated Nov 2017)
Enjoy the beach and the sea. Most of the beach is privately owned by the various hotels, so if you are staying at a hotel that does not offer beach access, you'll have to use the public beach (at the end of the Gran Viale, most central), which is very nice but a bit crowded. A cabin in first line costs about €95 per day.
Rent a bike from one of the numerous shops at the Gran Viale and explore the island.
Partake in golf and tennis, as Lido is more about relaxed leisure than frantic tourist activities.
Stroll along the quiet, shaded streets, people watch and window shop.

Buy[edit]
