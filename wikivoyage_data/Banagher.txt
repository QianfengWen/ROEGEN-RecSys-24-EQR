Banagher is a town at the western edge of County Offaly on the banks of the River Shannon. In Irish it's Beannchar na Sionna, "the place of the pointed rocks on the Shannon" - the river is shallow so it can be forded and is less flood-prone, but it's a block to navigation. An ancient settlement at the ford grew in the 19th century when the Grand Canal linked cross-country all the way from Dublin, and the shallows were bypassed by a lock system. Banagher was then an important inland port, but it and the waterways declined with the advent of the railways. In the late 20th century the waterways were refurbished for pleasure craft, and this is the main reason to visit.
Banagher in 2022 had a population of 1900, so it's the largest of a scattering of villages east of the river. These include Shannon Harbour, Cloghan, Ferbane and Shannonbridge, all described on this page. 
Clonmacnoise is the must-see monastic complex north of Shannonbridge, but this extensive site is described separately.

Banagher, Shannon Harbour and Shannonbridge are on the river, which is navigable throughout from Limerick to Athlone and Carrick-on-Shannon, and linked by canals to Dublin, Carlow, Waterford and Enniskillen. Check Waterways Ireland for current status of locks, moorings and so on.

Get around[edit]

You need your own wheels to get around this scattered district. A bike would do.
Bear in mind that the only bridges across the Shannon hereabouts are at Portumna, Banagher, Shannonbridge, then away north at Athlone.

See[edit]
53.217-7.951 Shannon Harbour is where the Grand Canal meets the Shannon, with scenic old bridges, wharves and locks.
53.236-7.9232 Clononey Castle is a sturdy tower house built in the 1490s. Henry VIII awarded it to Thomas Boleyn, and in return got to marry his daughter Anne - it was this that led to Henry's break with the Roman Catholic church. Two ladies of the Boleyn family are buried here. The castle is open summer weekends noon-5PM, donation.
53.28-8.053 Shannonbridge: the main sight is the bridge itself, built in 1757. It's narrow, with one-way traffic signal-controlled. On the west bank in County Roscommon is the Napoleonic-era Fort, just in case Boney tried to invade by riverboat. A little further west is the Romanian Orthodox Monastery of the Life-Giving Spring, in cabins that look like Butlins; you can attend services.
53.241-8.0584 Clonfert Cathedral. 12th-century church on the site of a monastery founded in 563 AD, reputedly by St Brendan the Navigator. (Or as the Ulster Annals would have you believe: "and on this day Cluain Ferta Brénainn was founded at the order of an angel.") It's still in occasional use as a Church of Ireland (Anglican) church. The interior is richly, indeed wackily, decorated. (updated Jul 2021)
Our Lady of Clonfert Roman Catholic Church, a mile south of the cathedral, has a 14th-century wooden Madonna and Child. By the church is a 16th-century tower house.
53.174-8.0865 Meelick on the west (Galway) bank has the oldest active RC church in Ireland, from 1414 and originally part of a Franciscan abbey. Burke Castle just north remains only as an earthwork. On the Offaly bank, Victoria Locks lift boats 2.4 m past the river shallows. A Martello tower stands guard on a river island.
53.264-7.8266 Gallen Abbey in Ferbane is the crumbling remnant of a 12th-century Augustinian priory. It's now within the grounds of a nursing home.
53.255-7.87 Coole Castle is a tower house built in 1575 which in no way resembles the fine mansion of that name in Enniskillen.
53.29-7.7578 Lemanaghan is the northern terminus of the Offaly Way, see below. The remains of the medieval monastery are free to stroll, 24 hours.
53.324-7.9919 Clonmacnoise is the area's star attraction, a medieval monastery complex. See separate page, but that village is short of accommodation and you're more likely to stay in the Banagher area.
Do[edit]
Clonfert Cathedral interior
Boating on the Shannon and canal: you can hire for extended trips or day excursions. Shannonbridge is the main base, where operators and agencies include Cruise Ireland, Silver Line Cruisers and Locaboat. There are limits on how far a rented boat may be taken, so save Graignamanagh for another trip.
Golf: Birr Golf Club is the closest, on R439 south of Banagher.
The Clonmacnoise and West Offaly Railway was scrapped in 2008. It was a 3-foot (914 mm) gauge railway for hauling peat, with a fan of tracks across the bog converging on Shannonbridge power station. Later it morphed into a tourist ride, with peat-burning depicted as part of the mystical Celtic yah-di-yah. As a cottage fuel maybe, but peat-burning on an industrial scale was horribly polluting, and the extraction of this non-renewable resource ruined the bog eco-system. There are no plans to restore the railway.

- attributed to St Manchan (d 664), who found this area short of accommodation.
 Charlotte's Way, Birr Rd, Banagher R42 RY82, ☏ +353 57 915 3864. As in Charlotte Brontë, who came to Banagher in 1854 on honeymoon with Arthur Bell Nicholls. She soon became pregnant and died in Haworth of what was stated as TB but was probably extreme morning sickness, hyperemesis gravidarum. Nicholls eventually returned to live here in Banagher. The B&B, in a carefully refurbished Georgian rectory, gets great reviews. B&B double €90. (updated Apr 2021)
