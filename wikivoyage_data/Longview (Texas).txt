Longview is a city in the Piney Woods region of Texas. At one time a major headquarters of the vast East Texas Oil Field, petroleum remains a large part of the city's economy. Founded in 1871, the city earned its name when surveyors for the Southern Pacific Railroad noted what a "long view" they could see from a hill near the center of the new town. Longview is now home to more than 75,000 residents and has grown to be an important center of commerce and industry for the Piney Woods region of Texas.


Get in[edit]
Longview is easily accessed by auto, lying just north of Interstate 20 and along US Highway 80, and Texas Highway 31. There is a bus station downtown, which is serviced by Greyhound Lines. The city does have a small airport, Longview East Texas Regional, which is mainly a private airfield. However, American Airlines' commuter line, American Eagle, operates daily flights to and from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.

Get around[edit]
Longview has a bus system called COLT (City of Longview Transportation). The COLT buses have stops throughout the city making it relatively easy to get around if you are not in a hurry and know where you need to go.
Several major highways traverse the city; Historic US Route 80 bisects Longview and serves as its "main drag". Longview also has an outer beltway, Texas State Highway Loop 281,  which forms a three-quarter loop around the city.
