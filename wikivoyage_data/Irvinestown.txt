Irvinestown is a small town in the historical County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland. In 2021 it had a population of 2300, so it's the largest settlement along the north shore of Lower Lough Erne.  It is home to Necarne Castle and Castle Archdale.


Understand[edit]
It used to be called Necarne — take your pick from Na Caorthann, the rowans, or Na Cairn the heap of stones. In 1618 during the Plantations it passed to a fellow called Lowther, who called it Lowtherstown. In 1667 it was sold to the Irvine family, but not until early 19th century did the village adopt their name.
The historic counties of Northern Ireland have been abolished,  so it's now within Fermanagh and Omagh District

Get in[edit]
Irvinestown is on A32 ten miles north of Enniskillen and 17 miles southwest of Omagh.
From Belfast or Dublin take the bus to Enniskillen and change. Ulsterbus 194 (a-j) runs every hour or so from Enniskillen to South West Hospital, Ballinamallard and Irvinestown (30 min), continuing to Lisnarick and Kesh. One bus a day extends to Pettigo on the border.

See[edit]
54.472-7.6411 Garden of the Celtic Saints is a collection of religious outdoor sculptures opposite Devenish Parish Church.
54.464-7.6352 Necarne Castle (Castle Irvine), Irvinestown BT94 1GG. 24 hrs. This 19th-century hall is long derelict, leaving only a facade. You can stroll the grounds, dogs on leads welcome. Events such as show-jumping are sometimes held here. Free.   (updated Apr 2021)
54.4778-7.732223 Castle Archdale, Enniskillen BT94 1PP. Lakeside country park. The outbuildings are all that survive of the 18th century mansion, with scraps of the earlier castle northeast. There's a tearoom and information centre. During World War II this was an RAF base for Flying Boats patrolling the Atlantic. The concrete maintenance areas have been turned into a caravan park and campsite, see Sleep.   (updated Apr 2021)
54.49-7.7354 White Island has the remains of a 12th-century monastery church, with stone figures that were originally free-standing but that have been set into the walls. Boat trips visit from Archdale, and they may also call at Abbey Davey's Island hugging the shore which likewise has a 12th-century church ruin. The lower lough has some 154 islands to fossick around.
54.506-7.8695 Caldragh graveyard on Boa Island has three stone figures of pagan deities from around 500 AD. Two are by their original location, and the Lustymore figure has been moved from that islet. Caldragh is reached off A47 which traverses Boa Island, thereby avoiding crossing in and out of the Republic for a few yards — the border touches the lough at the outlet of Termon River. The island is named for Badhbh a Celtic war goddess, not boas which St Patrick supposedly banished along with the Irish cobras, mambas and kraits. A couple of miles further east is the ferry to Lusty Beg island resort, see Sleep.
54.557-7.7426 Drummoney Falls only cascade a few feet, but it's a pleasant woodland setting with glorious autumn colours.
54.585-7.6947 Drumskinny Stone Circle is from 2000 BC. It's by the junction of Montaighroe Rd and Drumskinny Rd.
