Sonoma is a city in the Sonoma Valley within Sonoma County, in the north part of the Bay Area of California. With its central location in wine country, the city of Sonoma, with little over 10,000 residents, attracts thousands of visitors from around the world for wine tastings.


Understand[edit]

The city is based around the Sonoma Plaza (locals call it "The Square" or "The Plaza") which is a historic landmark. Restaurants, bars, boutiques and local businesses cluster around the Plaza, with historic houses and residential neighborhoods surrounding it on the southwest and southeast sides, and hills and parkland on its northern end.
Besides being the center of the modern wine-making industry in Sonoma County, the city of Sonoma has a rich history dating back to the early 19th century. Spanish colonial settlers established one of their northernmost missions in 1823 when the Mission San Francisco Solano was founded by a Spanish priest, Father Joseph Altimira. The Mission was the first, last, and only California mission established under newly-independent Mexican rule. For a brief period in 1846, from June 14 to July 9, Sonoma was the capital of the short-lived California Republic. There is a monument to the Bear Flag Movement is on the Plaza.
The personality of Sonoma is different than its better-known and more ritzy neighbor Napa. "Sonoma Casual" is the fashion for fundraiser invitations, and wealthy retirees mix with wine industry celebrities and a thriving Latino population. Sonoma is also home to a large Nepalese immigrant community. It's an eccentric town that had a mayor who wore Birkenstock sandals and had long hippie hair; anti-war protesters can occasionally be seen in protests at the Plaza; and you never know when you might see a man riding a bike with a parrot on his shoulder. Sonoma, a small town where everyone knows everyone, is friendly, welcoming, and more affordable than Napa. And yes, particularly in the summer, there are lots of tourists.

Get in[edit]
There are no major freeways that go through or even close to Sonoma. The best way to get in is from California State Route 12 which goes directly through the city. Route 12 intersects with Highway 101 in Santa Rosa and I-80 east of Napa near Fairfield. Additionally, State Route 116 connects the city to neighboring Petaluma, to the west, and also connects to Highway 101.
Those traveling from downtown San Francisco or SFO should take Highway 37 to Sears Point in southern Sonoma, then take State Route 121 north, into the valley.
Sonoma County is served by direct flights to Charles M. Schulz Sonoma County Airport (STS IATA) from Seattle/Tacoma; Portland, Oregon; Denver; San Francisco;  Los Angeles; Orange County; Las Vegas (seasonal); Phoenix; and Minneapolis (seasonal). From that airport, it's about a 45-minute drive to Sonoma, except during commute hours.
You can also fly into Sacramento (SMF IATA) or Oakland (OAK IATA) Airport as well as San Francisco International Airport. From any of those airports, it's much faster to take a car than public transportation, which is limited to buses.

Groceries, gourmet and take-out[edit]

38.295001-122.45407816 Vella Cheese Company, 315 2nd St E, ☏ +1 707-938-3232, vella@vellacheese.com. 9:30AM-6PM. Vella Cheese has been making their products since 1931. The building is a former brewery, built in 1904. A historic building, the site has seen it all, from earthquakes to Prohibition.

Drink[edit]
People come to Sonoma usually for one thing: to drink. There are few very bars in Sonoma the town, as most establishments are tasting rooms or restaurants with bars. The few local bars in town bring out primarily local color, but live music and special events can frequently be found by checking local free papers and websites.

38.2929-122.455911 Murphy's Irish Pub & Restaurant, 464 1st St E (on the east side of Sonoma Plaza), ☏ +1 707 935-0660. The Irish pub of Sonoma. Full menu, live music, beers, and a fun, family-friendly environment. They also have Trivia night on Wednesdays where the locals compete for first, second, and last place. Prizes usually include wine, so bone up on your current events! (updated Jul 2019)
38.29298-122.458852 Steiners Tavern, 465 1st St W (on the west side of Sonoma Plaza), ☏ +1 707 996-3812, info@steinerstavern.com. 6AM-2AM. Founded in 1927, described by a local as "the only real bar in Sonoma". All the classics of a bar: live music, jukebox, pool, TV's, and heavy pours. Lots of locals and it can get pretty rowdy sometimes. It opens at 6AM if that tells you anything. 
38.288668-122.458753 HopMonk Tavern, 691 Broadway (about a 10-minute walk south of the Plaza), ☏ +1 707 935-9100, info@hopmonk.com. 11:30AM-late. A contemporary beer garden that is part of a local chain (two other locations exist) that was started by Gordon Biersch. Food is just mediocre but the beer is adequate and features HopMonk's own beer (if you like Biersch's beers...) and other regional and international brews. Service is often slow and not always the most attentive but a lot of younger "hip" locals hang out here and they have live music most nights of the week. $10-20. 
38.292179-122.4565224 Town Square, 482 1st St E. (on the Plaza), ☏ +1 707-996-2922. 6:30AM-2AM. The only bar in Sonoma open for business on Christmas. Yup, the Town Square is that kind of place. A tiny dive bar located opposite the other dive bar (Steiner's) - you're either a fan of this bar or the other. Cheap booze, heavy pours, local flavor and a laid back tiny bar vibe. It's 5 o'clock somewhere.

Specials are frequent and you can also buy wine here to go. They serve Italian food from their parent restaurant, Della Santina's. $15-30. 
38.258479-122.4413166 Prohibition Spirits, 21877 Eighth St E, ☏ +1 707-721-6390, info@hellosonoma.com. Appointment only. The only spirits producer in Sonoma Valley. Prohibition went on the map with their HelloCello limoncello. Now they produce bourbon, rye, whiskey, rum and other treats. Sometimes they are open on the weekends on a whim, but call ahead for a tour and tasting. They make a bourbon called "Hooker's House," while the sexy label says one thing, it's actually named after General Hooker (no, the term "hooker" did not come from his name!). Varies.
