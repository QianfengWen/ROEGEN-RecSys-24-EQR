Welkenraedt (Dutch: Welkenraat, German: Welkenrath) is a town and municipality in Liège, Belgium.


Understand[edit]
1837 border stone depicting the border between Prussia and Belgium, nowadays denoting the border between Welkenraedt and Lontzen, both in Belgium.
Historically a part of the Dutch of Limburg, Welkenraedt became a part of the Department of the Ourthe under Napoleon. After his defeat, the town was split between the Dutch and Prussians, with the modern-day town of Herbesthal being ceded to Prussia. After Belgian independence (1830), the town counted just over 400 Flemish-speaking citizens, and a large amount of Luxembourgish migrant workers that moved in around the time of harvest. In 1843, the railway between Liège and Aachen was put into service, on which Welkenraedt functioned as a border post, which brought industrial and demographic influxes to the town. After the end of the First World War and Treaty of Versailles, the Prussian region of Eupen-Malmedy was ceded to Belgium as a compensation for war damages, ending Welkenraedt's function as a border town.
The municipality consists of the towns of Welkenraedt, Henri-Chapelle and several hamlets. Additionally, Welkenraedt borders Herbesthal, which lies within the German-speaking municipality of Lontzen. Herbesthal was historically a part of Welkenraedt, though after the Dutch-Prussian split following Napoleon's defeat, the two got separated. Though Welkenraedt largely speaks Low Dietsch (a German dialect), it is officially French-speaking. 

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Welkenraedt lies close to the A3 / E40 highway, connecting Aachen and Liège and shares its exit with Eupen, which lies to the south of the highway. From the highway exit, the remaining 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) are signposted, and consist of following the N67 northwest. After crossing the train tracks, the first road to the left connects to the train station and Place des Combattants, Welkenraedt's city centre.

By public transit[edit]

50.659655.97551 Welkenraedt  is a railway interchange for railways along railway 37 (Liège - Aachen), with two branches connecting to Eupen and Montzen respectively, though the latter is only for cargo. Welkenraedt station has a ticket office with limited availability times and assistance services for mobility-impaired travellers, which require booking via SNCB at least 24 hours in advance. The train services connecting to this station, specifically the Intercity services, connect to a lot of major cities in Flanders:

IC 01 (Eupen — Brussels — Ostend): The connection to Eupen takes no more than seven minutes.
IC 12 ((Ostend —) Kortrijk — Welkenraedt): Only on workdays.
Both of these Intercity services connect to Liège-Guillemins, Brussels-South and Ghent-Sint-Pieters. IC 01 also connects to Bruges. Other regional trains consist of:

S41 / RE 29 (Aachen — Verviers — Liège): Stylised as euregioAIXpress, this service provides a 15-minute connection to Aachen. Until the timetable change on 10 December 2023 it ran to Spa-Géronstère station in Spa from Verviers onwards. Travelling from here to Spa, now requires a transfer to another service in Verviers. 
Peak trains, listed as L-service, may run in addition as well, check SNCB timetables.

Get around[edit]
For all practical purposes of getting around the wider municipality, renting a car or bike is recommended, as bus service may be scarce from time to time. Nonetheless, the town of Welkenraedt itself is perfectly navigable by foot as well.

By bus[edit]
Welkenraedt's train station is the region's main bus hub. Buses are operated by TEC, who operates services to nearby cities and towns. The town of Henri-Chapelle is reached through lines 710 (to Kelmis), 712 (to Clermont) and 717 (to Viviers). Lines 710 (to Eupen) and 715 (to Kelmis) connect to the town of Herbesthal.
