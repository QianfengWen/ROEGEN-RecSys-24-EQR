Muğla (pronounced moo-lah) is a city in the Southern Aegean region of Turkey, with a population of about 120,000 in 2022, including the outlying villages. Yet for all its size, it has a remarkably well-preserved and scenic old town centre. 


Understand[edit]
Muğla stands inland on the road between Izmir and the coastal towns (once trading ports and nowadays beach resorts), near the point where the Aegean Sea turns the corner into the Mediterranean. In antiquity it was Mobolla, which morphed through several spellings to become Muğla, but next-to-nothing remains of its earliest days. It has always been a quiet market town, set in an agricultural region though its immediate vicinity is rather barren. It stands at 670 m altitude on a mountainside, so it's pleasantly cool on summer days when the coast is hot and humid.
The city is the provincial capital, so if your bag is stolen or you prang your rented motor-scooter in Bodrum, Marmaris, Dalaman or Fethiye, then Muğla is where the police report will locate the mishap – local government and other bureaucracy is a major employer here. Most travellers zip past on the D550 bypass and hardly notice the place. But it's remarkable how, amidst so much Turkish urban mediocrity, Muğla has somehow retained so many charming 18th–19th century buildings. Visit it quick before the developers get there.

See[edit]
Theatre masque in the museum
37.219128.36521 Great Mosque of Muğla (Ulu Camii), Fabrika Sk 6. Large mosque built in 1344 by the Beys of Menteşe, but what you see now is a restoration of 1838. Further restoration in 2008 kept the later appearance.  (updated Sep 2023)
37.217928.36562 Saat Kulesi the clocktower was built in 1895. It's hemmed in by dreary modern buildings and doesn't serve as a landmark as other cities' clocktowers do. Below is an Ottoman bazaar or Arasta.
Şeyh Camii or Sheikh Mosque is north flank of the clocktower. It was built in 1565 by Sheikh Bedrettin and the minaret was added in the early 19th century.
37.216728.36473 Kurşunlu Cami, Fark Aksoy Sk 3. This large mosque was built in 1495, which you might not guess from the atrium extension to its front added in 1900. The interior behind that is more traditional and the dome is leaded, hence Kurşunlu in Turkish. It was refurbished in 2022.  (updated Sep 2023)

Do[edit]
Hamams or Turkish baths / saunas: historic examples are Vakıflar Hamam (built 1258) at Mustafa Muğlalı Cd 5 by the museum, Sekibaşı Hamamı (15th century) 500 m further west, Han Hamam east and Rum Hamamı in the old quarter. Good luck finding any of them open.
Football: Muğlaspor pay soccer away down in the amateur leagues. The stadium is next to Demircioğlu Park Hotel.
Le Tunnel de l'Amour near the clocktower purports to be a marriage agency, bedecked with pix of cute Ukrainian girls. Best stick to watching football.
