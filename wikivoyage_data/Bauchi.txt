Stay safe[edit]
Bauchi is a safe state, but in any case, be careful with arrangements or organizations that sound unrealistic (particularly messages mostly via e-mail requesting your assistance), and don't transparently display your assets, particularly in broad daylight places.
It is rare for a tourist to be a victim of a violent crime, it is still wise to stay safe and be alert, especially during late-night outings. Stick to crowded streets and make sure to go out in groups as against going out alone.
Furthermore, you should stick to places and people you know and avoid going anywhere without a trusted guide if it is your first visit.
