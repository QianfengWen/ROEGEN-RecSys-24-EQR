See[edit]
 St Connell's Museum, Mill Rd, Glenties F94 V258, ☏ +353 74 95 7880. M-F 11:00-15:00. The sort of museum that should be put in a museum. The Courthouse next door, built in 1843, is still in use. (updated Aug 2021)
St Connell's Church (RC) on Mill Rd is a striking building of 1974. The roof slants almost to the ground, is it meant to be a pyramid, tent, dolmen, skateboard ramp or mountain? It won an architecture award, which is not necessarily good news for its users. The C of I church a block west of Main St is a sober affair of 1825.
54.818-8.4331 Kilclooney More is a small village with a collection of prehistoric megaliths. The three best are Portal Tomb Dg 68 west side of R261, Court Tomb Dg 69 to its north, and the large Portal Tomb Dg 70 on the moor east of the road.
54.829-8.4642 Lough Doon Fort is a stone ringfort, age unknown, on an islet in Lough Doon. In 2021 the fort has been closed for conservation work but you can admire it from the shore.
54.828-8.5233 Dawros Head can be reached along the lane through Magheragallon. The old signal station is just rubble, but a little way east are the remains of a medieval settlement, with a well-preserved corn-drying kiln.
54.763-8.5274 Maghera Beach is 12 km from Ardara. It's a long sandy beach and the cliffs are riddled with sea caves: some you can reach on foot from the beach, others you need a kayak. 500 m before the beach car park is Assaranca waterfall. The lane continues up into the hills and after 2 km is Owenree River waterfalls. All these falls are cascades rather than sheer. The lane eventually joins R230 to Glencolmcille.
54.868-8.125 Fintown Railway, Fintown F94 FR90, ☏ +353 74 954 6280. Jun-Sept Th F 11:00-14:00, Su 12:30-16:00. This is a station-yard and rolling stock of a 3 ft (914 mm) gauge railway, which once wound up hill down dale across Donegal, hauled by An Mhuc Dhubh or The Black Pig. Trains set off towards Glenties every 30 min or so, but actually don't get very far. Every heritage railway society has ambitions of extension, but this ingenious lot do so with a twist: here's your pickaxe, get navvying, and experience life as your Irish ancestors did, in a muddy trench on the outskirts of Glasgow! Adult £2, child £1. (updated Aug 2021)
