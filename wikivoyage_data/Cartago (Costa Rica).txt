For other places with the same name, see Cartago (disambiguation).
Cartago is a city in Costa Rica's Central Valley. It used to be the national capital before that honor went to San José and is one of the few places in the country where more than a handful colonial era buildings have survived to the present day.


Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
Take the Lumaca buses in San José. There are many buses running between San Jose and Cartago.  For ₡750 (colones) and up, you will be able to catch a bus in San José downtown along Avenida 2.  They run every 15 minutes, and take 45 minutes.  "Indirect" buses from San Isidro de El General to San Jose stop on the outskirts of Cartago next to a stop for local buses.

By car[edit]
From San José (and the rest of the Central Valley) to Cartago through Ruta Nacional 1 (Interamericana).
From the south (Pérez Zeledón, Panamá, etc.) also take Ruta Nacional 1 (Interamericana).
From the Caribbean, go through Turrialba.
By train[edit]
There's a commuter train[dead link] from San José. The train has a handful of stops between its Terminus at Estacion Atlantica in San José and Cartago and a few trains continue on to a place called Los Àngeles. Unfortunately there is no train in either direction between 10:00 and 15:00 and the last train leaves Cartago at 18:30 so if you want to take the train, you'll have to arrange your visit to fit the train schedule. The service doesn't get affected by rush hour traffic but it is far slower than taking a bus or driving a car.

Get around[edit]
Map of Cartago (Costa Rica)
Cartago downtown is perhaps the smallest of the main cities in the Central Valley, it is possible to walk all around the city in short time.

By bike[edit]
There is an effort by the local city government to make Cartago a bicycle-friendly city, because of that and thanks to a donation, the city constructed a bicycle-only loop track around the city.
