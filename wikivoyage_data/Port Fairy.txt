Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The easiest way to get into Port Fairy by car and is about a 30 km (19 mi) drive west of Warrnambool via the A1 Princes Highway west and takes about a 20-minute drive from Warrnambool and 3.5 hours from Melbourne.

By bus[edit]
Port Fairy is served by two buses, both coming from Warrnambool, one continues to Mount Gambier in South Australia - If you are coming from Melbourne, take a V/Line train to Warrnambool and switch to either:

The 8 Bus, which departs from the BP Service Station on Princes Freeway (16min walk from Warrnambool Station, 5 buses per day)
V/Line Coach to Mount Gambier, departs from just outside the railway station, 4 buses per day
By bike[edit]
If you like cycling, you can try cycling the whole Port Fairy-Warrnambool Rail Trail by either driving or taking the train to Warrnambool, then cycling along the trail the rest of the way - the trail is along the alignment of a now disused railway between Port Fairy and Warrnambool. Takes 2-3 hours depending on fitness level.

Get around[edit]
Map of Port Fairy
Port Fairy is not very large, and therefore most of the town can be easily traversed by foot. The route 8 bus comes from Warrnambool and has many stops around the town, although frequency is very poor at only 5 buses per day, so this cannot be used as a viable transit option.
