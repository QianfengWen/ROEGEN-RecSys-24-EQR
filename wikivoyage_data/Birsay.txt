Get in[edit]

By road[edit]
From Kirkwall, take the A965 towards Stromness. The direct route is to turn right at Stenness onto A986, which at Twatt becomes A967, keep following it north to the junction of A966. You're now at Birsay, with the palace just left. 
A slow scenic route is to turn off A965 earlier at Finstown onto A966, and follow this round the north coast past Tingwall and Broch of Gurness to meet A967 at Birsay.
From Stromness, take the A965 out of town, and after a mile fork left onto A967. Branch left onto either B-road if you want to visit Skara Brae, otherwise continue north. A987 is joined by A986 around Twatt, continue north to Birsay.

By bus[edit]
Henry Hudson, Cook, Frobisher: so many ill-fated expeditions have passed through the Orkneys. And then there’s the bus service to Birsay and Skara Brae.
There’s nothing on Sunday. The options Monday-Saturday are:
Bus 6 from Kirkwall at 7AM and 5:10PM to Birsay, 45 min, back 7:50AM and 6PM. This runs along the north coast via Tingwall (for Rousay ferry) and Evie (for Broch of Gurness) but doesn’t serve Skara Brae.
Bus 7 from Kirkwall at 1:40PM and 5:30PM to Birsay, with the earlier bus heading back to Kirkwall at 2:10PM while the later bus continues at 6:10PM to Stromness. It doesn’t pass Skara Brae, but you can get off at Sandwick 2 miles away. The reverse service from Stromness only runs at 6:30AM and 7:30AM.
Bus 8S from Kirkwall at 9:15AM via Stenness to Skara Brae (1 hr) then into Stromness, from there at 10:30AM to Skara Brae, at 10:50AM on to Birsay, and return to Kirkwall by noon. It also runs from Kirkwall at 1:15PM and 4:45PM via Stromness to Skara Brae (50 min), Birsay and back to Kirkwall.
A tour bus T11 is advertised but didn't run in 2021.

Get around[edit]
Earl's Palace, Birsay
Birsay itself is small and easy to walk, but check the tide times before crossing to the Brough. You need wheels to reach outlying sites such as Broch of Gurness and Click Mill, cycling is ideal.
