El Puig, formally known as El Puig de Santa María, is an agricultural village of 8,600 people (2018) in the province of Valencia, 15 km north of the city of Valencia.


Understand[edit]
Pronounced 'el pooch' (from the Valencian word for 'hill', of which there are two in the village), the village was first settled by the Iberians, later occupied by the Moors, and finally conquered by Jaime I from Aragon in 1237. It is best known for its orange groves and Gothic monastery, and is easily visited as a day trip from Valencia.
