York is a town in the Avon Valley in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia. It's 100 km east of Perth and in 2021 had a population of 2399. It developed in Victorian times and has been little altered since, so its main street is lined with historic buildings. 


Understand[edit]
By 1830 the British colony on Swan River, the future Perth, had room a-plenty for building but had insufficient farmland to feed its population. An expedition probed east of the Darling mountains and found good pastoral country here in the Avon valley, so it was quickly settled by farmsteads. A town appeared by 1836 but there was violent conflict with the Aboriginal people, the Ballardong Noongar, until a military sally killed enough of them to put British occupation beyond doubt. As elsewhere in Western Australia, a shortage of labour was filled by transported convicts, many of them Irish, at a time when the rest of Australia had ceased to use them. They were housed in a Convict Depot, and many settled in the region when their sentence was served rather than return to poverty and oppression in the "old country". The railway arrived in 1885, making York the nearest station to the Yilgarn goldfields another 300 km east, so miners thronged the town before setting off on the long hike. This ceased in 1891, when another line east was routed via Northam and eventually ran out to the goldfields. 
The town has always been agricultural and never drew in heavy industry or a large population. This means its old architecture has been preserved, in a riot of late Victorian styles, and is the main reason to visit.
York Visitor Centre is in the former Town Hall at 81 Avon Terrace, open daily 9:30AM-4PM.

He was pardoned in 1869 but chose to remain in Fremantle, designing several buildings around the region.
Uniting Church (combining the Methodists, Presbyterians and Congregationalists) was opened in 1888, replacing a Methodist chapel of 1854 that was too small from the outset. It's at 109 Centennial Drive a block south of Faversham House (see Sleep).
