Get in[edit]
Norman is less than 30 minutes due south of Oklahoma City, and approximately 3 hours north of Dallas, on I-35. It is easiest to access by car, though there is limited Amtrak service to the area (train does stop in Norman), as well as bus service from Oklahoma City. An Airport Express shuttle will transport you from the Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City directly to your destination in Norman: ☏ +1 405 681-3311.

By bus[edit]
There are multiple daily Greyhound buses from Dallas. The bus stop is located at 506 North Porter Ave.

Amtrak serves Norman with its once-daily Heartland Flyer, running between Oklahoma City and Fort Worth, Texas. The southbound train departs around 9AM while the northbound leaves just before 9PM. 35.219916-97.4428711 Norman Station is located at 200 S Jones Ave, close to Main St.

Get around[edit]
Map of Norman (Oklahoma)
Norman has a small transit system, so it's easier to get around by car. Areas around the OU campus can be accessed on foot. CART, the local bus service with some service to Oklahoma City, is free to OU students and faculty and affordable for others.

Gambling[edit]




If you win...
Chances are that, if you win it big in Norman and you are not a U.S. citizen your winnings will be subject to a 30% withholding tax from the IRS. That $10,000 slot winning can dwindle quite quickly if that is taken off the top. Not to worry though you can reclaim your gambling winnings tax through a 1042-S form. You should get this from the casino so don't lose it... it is your starting ticket to getting your gambling winnings back.
