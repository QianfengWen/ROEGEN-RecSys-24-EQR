Tenby Harbour
Tenby (Welsh: Dinbych-y-Pysgod, "little town of fishes") is a beautiful walled town in South Wales that spills out pastel coloured buildings along cliffs and around sandy bays. Tenby is one of Wales' premier tourist spots, and is located on the south Pembrokeshire coast, about 80 km (50 miles) west of Swansea.


Understand[edit]
The town of Tenby dates back to the Norman conquest, and the town walls were constructed in 1093 in order to defend it from the Welsh. Due to its somewhat remote location, however, the town and its quaint cobble streets and sandy beaches remained off the tourist trail until the Victorian era. Then, with the influx of wealthy merchant families from Swansea, Cardiff and further afield, Tenby was suddenly in a vogue, and the town's appeal as a picturesque spa has remained ever since. Although Tenby is one of Wales' most popular holiday destinations, it has resisted over commercialization and remains a very elegant and pleasant family holiday venue. It was home to about 4,700 people in 2011.
Cars are banned from the historic centre of the town during the summer months, which adds greatly to the appeal of the town as a place to relax and unwind.

51.67692-4.701764 North Beach. North beach looks onto Tenby's old fishing harbour and out onto Camarthen Bay. This beach provides one of the most popular backdrops for portrait pictures and is the focus of most photographers who visit Tenby, providing them with some of the most dramatic sunrises set parallel to a quaint pastel coloured harbour filled with working trawlers. Goscar Rock sits in the centre of this mile long beach providing hours of fun for young and old to sift through the rock pools, shelter from the winds and, for those who dare, a small climbing adventure (although not advised for any novice climber). 
Gumfreston Church of St Lawrence. Outside there is the shaft of a churchyard cross, and three medicinal springs rise in the churchyard, the water of which contains iron and chalybeate. In the wood to the south of the churchyard wall are the ruins of the village that stood beside the quay on the river estuary. This was a transfer point for goods from the road to little coasting vessels. It was also on the pilgrimage route across south Wales to St David's.
51.67629-4.735685 St Lawrence’s Church. Gumfreston's Church of St Lawrence is romantically situated in a wooded dell and dates from the late 12th century although generally of the 14th to 16th centuries. The tower used to be detached, and the church was well restored in 1869, including new roofs and church furnishings. The porch on the western side may be a remnant of an earlier church on the site, which was a “llan” (walled enclosure around a church) in era of Celtic Christianity. On the wall are the faded outlines of what was once a large and dramatic mural depicting Jesus Christ, fishing nets and other implements. This has been interpreted as a message to the congregation to avoid working on the Sabbath. Three holy wells in the churchyard attracted pilgrims in ancient times. People still visit the church to collect a little of the well water, or to pray. The revival of interest in Celtic Christianity has prompted the development of “services of light” every three months in the church, focusing on Celtic spirituality and led by lay members of the congregation. Services of stories and songs about Celtic saints are a popular feature of the Tenby Arts Festival.
