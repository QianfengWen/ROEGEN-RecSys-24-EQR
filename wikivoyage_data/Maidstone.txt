River Medway, Maidstone
Maidstone is the county town in Mid-Kent, in the South East of England on the River Medway.


Understand[edit]
Straddling the river Medway, Maidstone is the economic, administrative and agricultural centre of Kent.
For many years the major employment in the town was provided by the agricultural markets, insurance brokers and the toffee factory to the south of the river. Nowadays, however, many residents use Maidstone as a base to commute into London, or are employed within the retail, administrative or service sectors within the town.
