Not to be confused with Toledo, a city in Spain.

Toledo is a city of almost 273,000 people (2019) in northwestern Ohio's Lucas County, on the Maumee River at the edge of Lake Erie. Although not as important as it once was, Toledo's past as an industrial powerhouse gave it cultural institutions that rival larger cities like Chicago.


Understand[edit]

History[edit]
People had big dreams for Toledo. The location of the city at the end of Lake Erie was an ideal Midwest port, but was in the inhospitable Great Black Swamp. Early settlers spent years digging drainage ditches through the swamp, and lining them with clay tiles, battling disease along the way. Due to a border dispute, Michigan and Ohio briefly went to war over the land containing Toledo in the 1830s. But because of a series of blunders, nobody was killed. By an act of Congress, Ohio was awarded Toledo, while Michigan received the Upper Peninsula. Later settlers came over from Eastern Europe, or up from down south, to work on the  Miami and Erie Canal, and still later to work in local factories that made early automobiles and auto parts. Because of its industrial heritage Toledo became the birthplace of Libbey Glass, modern chewing gum, the modern scale, and Jeep vehicles.

Toledo today[edit]
Skyline of Toledo, Ohio
Today, Toledo is a city with a metro population of 608,000, the fourth largest city in Ohio. Toledo has a big local university, an independent daily newspaper, and historic buildings downtown, some of which have been turned into artists' lofts. The cityscape today provides some good opportunities for photographs of derelict buildings. Toledo is also home to the local favorite Toledo Mud Hens minor league baseball team. They play in the Fifth Third Field in downtown Toledo. Near downtown, the Old West End is a beautiful neighborhood of Victorian mansions, and is where the world-class Toledo Museum of Art and its glass museum can be found. A world-class Toledo Zoo is a few miles to the south. In the north end, there is the  Polish Village where it is common to see storefronts written in Polish. The food in Toledo is worth stopping for. As well as the many diners in the area, many ethnic eateries should not be missed, including Tony Packo's famous  Hungarian hot dogs, Hungarian baked goods, classy Middle Eastern places such as the Beirut, and delicious Indian cuisine from the Tandoor.  True or not, Toledo likes to think that it has the most restaurants per capita in the entire country. Toledo is also one of the most productive ports on the Great Lakes, and its factories boast one of the highest robot per capita rates in the nation.

Toledo has four distinct seasons. The spring in Toledo tends to be quite pleasant, and presents a good opportunity for exploring Toledo's parks and gardens. Summers can range from pleasantly warm to sweltering heat, and it is during this time when Lake Erie becomes hospitable for things like swimming and other water sport. The fall is much like spring, and the trees around the city gain vibrant colors as the leaves begin to fall off, giving the parks a different character entirely. Winters tend to be strong in Toledo due to the Lake Effect, and while there are no mountains for skiing, there are plenty of other opportunities for winter sports such as cross country skiing and ice skating.
