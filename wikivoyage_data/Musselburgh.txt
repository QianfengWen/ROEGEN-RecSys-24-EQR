Musselburgh is the largest town in  East Lothian in central Scotland, six miles east of Edinburgh city centre. It's an old fishing port which is now part of the commuter belt, with a population in 2020 of 21,100. 


Understand[edit]
The Romans were fond of mussels, as good a reason as any to camp here circa 80 AD. They built a bridge over the River Esk that (now in its third incarnation) still stands: the town's High Street was aligned with it but the New Bridge opened in 1806 to carry the Great North Road (the later A1), and the town developed a second spine. In the mid-1980s the A1 was diverted onto a bypass to the south. To the west, Musselburgh adjoins the Edinburgh suburbs of Portobello and Joppa. To the south was the coal-mining district of Newcraighall, now redeveloped, where Inveresk has somehow survived as a charming 17th / 18th century village. The main reason to visit Musselburgh is to go to the races.

It was yet another calamitous defeat for Scotland, but the English failed to capitalise, the child Mary Queen of Scots was spirited away to marry the future king of France, and the realms remained separate until the 1603 Union of the Crowns.

Newhailes House
Mussels served here may be Scottish but won't be local: the burgh's mussel beds were lost by the 20th century to over-harvesting and pollution. For centuries they had provided food, marl for fertiliser and construction, and a habitat for other marine life. There are initiatives to re-establish beds elsewhere in Britain, but it's unlikely to be feasible here so close to city industry.
