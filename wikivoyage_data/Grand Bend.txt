History[edit]
The settlement began in the 1830s when a group of English and Scottish settlers bought lots from the Canada Company, a land development firm.  The villagers were mainly the families of the millhands and fisherman. Their homesteads were built on the south side of the present village.
For 20 years, the settlement, then called Brewster, was an isolated lumbering community. Until the opening of the highway to Goderich in 1850, people and provisions had to travel by water. Once road connections were complete, the village was no longer solely dependent on the forests for its livelihood and opportunities for new businesses emerged.
Early French Canadian settlers in the area referred to the present location of the village as "Aux Croches", 'at the bends'. Grand Bend survived as a name, perhaps because it was the most appropriate—the tight hairpin turn in the original Ausable River where mills were established.
Improved roads and the arrival of the automobile near the turn of the century had the greatest influence on the growth of Grand Bend. Businesses were established to serve visitors and travelers along the highway and with the beach, "The Bend" became a summer destination.
