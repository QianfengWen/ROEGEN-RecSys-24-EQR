Kemah Boardwalk Inn
Kemah is a city on the Gulf Coast of Texas. The boardwalk is a popular destination for people in the Houston area. The best time to come if you want to relax is during the week, but if you have kids and want them to be able to play in the fountains and things, come on the weekends.


Understand[edit]
In the mid-1990s, Landry's Restaurants bought the all the property along the south side of the Clear Creek channel.  It was then rebuilt with a theme-park atmosphere and the energy in Kemah increased dramatically.  All the boardwalk restaurants are chains owned by Landry's, and all the smaller shops lease space.  Limited parking is free.  There are plenty of other independent shops through the town, back off the boardwalk.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Kemah is small enough to travel on foot or bike, but most people get there by car.  From IH-10 in Baytown (east of Houston), turn south on TX-146.  Kemah is just past the second or third very tall bridge.  From Houston or Galveston, go towards the other on IH-45.  Turn east on FM-517.  Continue straight on FM-2004 until it ends in Kemah at TX-146 (if you accidentally "turn right" and stay on FM-517, just keep on going to TX-146 then turn left - you're only a couple of miles down the road).

By boat[edit]
Kemah Boardwalk Marina offers transient docking services for $1 per foot.  Slips up to 30' are almost always available, 30-50' boats should call in advance.

Get around[edit]
Due to the small size of the town there is no public transportation. Taxis are available, and plenty of parking is available.

 The Flying Dutchman, 9 Kemah Waterfront St (on the boardwalk, near the middle, can't miss the sign), ☏ +1 281-334-7575.
