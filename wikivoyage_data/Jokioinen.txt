Jokioinen is in Tavastia Proper. With a population of approximately 5,000 in 2021, the municipality's history can be traced back to the 16th century when the Jokioinen estate was established. The estate was an important contributor to the Finnish economy until the 20th century, when it was split into more than a thousand homes and small farms.
Many of the tourists who visit the region do so due to the Jokioinen Museum Railway.
