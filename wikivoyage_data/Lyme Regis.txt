Excerpt from Persuasion by Jane Austen

The Cobb at Lyme Regis They were come too late in the year for any amusement or variety which Lyme, as a public place, might offer. The rooms were shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family but of the residents left; and, as there is nothing to admire in the buildings themselves, the remarkable situation of the town, the principal street almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the Cobb, skirting round the pleasant little bay, which, in the season, is animated with bathing machines and company; the Cobb itself, its old wonders and new improvements, with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town, are what the stranger’s eye will seek; and a very strange stranger it must be, who does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme, to make him wish to know it better.

Lyme Regis is a seaside town in south-west Dorset in the West Country of England.


Understand[edit]
Lyme Regis is a historic unspoiled seaside resort and fishing port on the world-famous Cobb Harbour. Surrounded by beautiful coastlines and countryside, the area has now been awarded World Heritage Site Status; famous for its geology and fossil finds.
The town is famous for "The Cobb", a large harbour wall, that has been featured in novels by Jane Austen (who was a frequent visitor to Lyme Regis). It was used as a location in Persuasion, a film of Jane Austen's novel, and in the film The French Lieutenant's Woman, starring Meryl Streep, based on the book of the same name by local writer John Fowles.
Lyme Regis was the location for the film Ammonite, based on the life of local 19th-century pioneer fossil-hunter Mary Anning, starring Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan.
The town's name was just "Lyme" until it was granted a Royal Charter in 1284 by King Edward I. This charter is so old that the original Latin word "Regis" is used instead of the usual "Royal" prefix as with Leamington Spa, Tunbridge Wells and Wootton Bassett.

Do[edit]
 Fossil hunting. In front of the cliffs by the beach. There are lots of fossilised ammonites in the sediment layers in the cliffs, and as weathering occurs, the cliffs are eroded and the fossils are left on the beach. The best time to go hunting is in Spring, when the winter's storms have exposed many fossils. Most are small, some are the size of your palm, and one or two are surprisingly large — up to a metre in diameter!
