Pontefract is a market town in West Yorkshire, England. It's one of the townships of the City of Wakefield and a commuter town for Leeds.


Understand[edit]
During the 17th-century English Civil Wars, Pontefract like much of Yorkshire supported the Royalists. They remained resolute even after the execution of Charles I, hence the town motto Post Mortem Patris Pro Filio, Latin for "After the death of the father, support the son".
Pontefract was notable for growing liquorice, inspiring a famous poem by John Betjeman. Liquorice was first used as a medicine, but 18th-century apothecary George Dunhill noticed that the more sugar he added, the more he sold, so his throat lozenges morphed into Pontefract Cakes. What was now a confectionery business thrived, becoming part of Haribo in the 20th century, and a sweet smell often pervades the town. But local liquorice couldn't compete with imports from Turkey so the fields were grubbed out in the 1960s; there have been attempts to re-establish them.

By train[edit]
It's a small town yet it has three railway stations, all just unstaffed platform halts with no facilities. 

53.6988-1.3041 Pontefract Monkhill railway station (Near the castle). The best connected station with trains every 30 min from Leeds, either via Castleford and Glasshoughton (for Xscape), or via  Wakefield Westgate, Wakefield Kirkgate, Featherstone and Pontefract Tanshelf. These trains continue east to Knottingley, and twice M-Sa they extend to Goole. Monkhill has three direct trains M-Sa from London King's Cross run by Grand Central Railway, continuing via Halifax to Bradford. These are not infrequently cancelled, and Grand Central tickets aren't flexible for other train companies, so it's usually safer to travel from London on LNER trains changing at Wakefield Westgate. Monkhill Platform 2 cannot be accessed by wheelchair: that's southbound from Leeds and Wakefield towards Knottingley, Doncaster and London. The workarounds are either to use the town's other stations, or to stay on the train to Knottingley where it reverses and comes back through Platform 1.   (updated Jun 2023)
53.694-1.3192 Pontefract Tanshelf railway station (south side of town near the racecourse). Has only the hourly service from Leeds via Wakefield.   (updated Jun 2023)
53.692-1.3033 Pontefract Baghill railway station (east of town centre). On the line between York and Sheffield, with three trains each way M-Sa and two on Sunday.   (updated Jun 2023)

Arriva Bus 148 / 149 runs every 15 min from Wakefield (40 min) via Featherstone and continues east to Knottingley.

See[edit]
Pontefract Castle ruins
53.695556-1.3038891 Pontefract Castle, Castle Garth Pontefract WF8 1QH (north of centre). M-F 8:30AM-4:30PM, Sa Su 9:30AM-4:30PM. Norman castle where Richard II met a nasty end. In the Civil Wars it withstood Cromwell’s assaults but after surrendering was demolished to prevent future trouble. Free.   (updated Aug 2018)
53.692-1.3122 Pontefract Museum, 5 Salter Row WF8 1BA. M-F 10AM-4:30PM, Sa 10:30AM-4:3030PM price=Free. Local history, from castle to cake. The shoe that Charlie Chaplin ate in The Gold Rush was made of Pontefract liquorice.   (updated Apr 2019)
53.690597-1.3099313 Pontefract Hermitage, Southgate WF8 1AQ. Closed. There were hermits here from the 13th century, but in the 14th century they began tunnelling into the soft underlying sandstone, creating two chambers (the larger being called the "Oratory"). One hermit was convinced that God was underground, so down and down he carved, until he met water. Still, at least he'd made a useful well. The hermitage was forgotten until the 19th century, when the town expanded and a workman tumbled in upon the place. It became overlain by the Victorian redbrick Gothic dispensary of Pontefract General Infirmary, with occasional access by guided tour. In the 21st century PGI moved into modern premises nearby and the dispensary fell into disrepair and became unsafe. This means the Hermitage is closed.   (updated Aug 2018)
All Saints' Church is next to the castle, which is why the 14th-century original church is a ruin, as first the Parliamentarians then the Royalists assaulted it. The present Anglican church was built within the ruin in 1967, and is combined as a benefice with the 18th-century St Giles Church in the market place. Of the former Cluniac Priory of St John the Evangelist, only the name "Monkhill" remains.
See also the 18th-century Buttercross in the market place, and the 14th-century merchant's house in an alley off Cornmarket (known locally as the pub “Counting House”, but long closed and in urgent need of repair).
