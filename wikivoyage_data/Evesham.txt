Evesham is a market town of 28,000 people (2021) in Worcestershire that is roughly equidistant from Worcester, Cheltenham & Stratford-upon-Avon and in the Vale of Evesham.


Understand[edit]
Evesham Abbey Bell Tower
Being located in the flood plain of the River Avon the area is well suited to market gardening and the town is famous for its fruit and veg, particularly its asparagus, known by the locals as 'gras'. However, being in a flood plain and being located in a meander of the River Avon, the town is prone to flooding and those from 2007 were the more severe recorded floods.
The town was founded around an 8th-century abbey which was mostly destroyed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries and today only a bell tower remains.

Evesham Abbey Almonry
52.0913-1.94681 Evesham Abbey. Remains, once home to the 6th largest monastery in England, the Abbey was subject to dissolution during the reign of Henry VIII, resulting in its substantial destruction. The only significant remains that stand today are the 15th-century Bell Tower, the entrance arch to the old Chapter House, and the Almonary. The marked grave of Simon de Montfort, who dies at the Battle of Evesham in 1265, lies close to the Bell Tower. The remains are located within the aptly named Abbey Park, which lies next to the River Avon. During summer, this can be a pleasant spot, and is sometimes host to events such as small funfairs on the neighbouring Crown Meadow ('Party in the Park'), and music at the park's bandstand.
