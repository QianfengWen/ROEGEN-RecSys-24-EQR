Punta Arenas is the regional capital of the Magallanes y Antártica Region, in Chilean Patagonia, one of the southernmost cities in the world. It's the largest city in Chilean Patagonia, and has developed into a tourist center in far southern America rivaling Ushuaia in Argentina. It's an important starting point for trips to Antarctica and the Falkland Islands.


Understand[edit]
City center
Punta Arenas (formerly Punta Arenosa, "Sandy Point") is located on the Brunswick Peninsula and was founded in 1848 by José de los Santos Mardones. With a population of around 125,000 (2015), it is the largest settlement on the Strait of Magellan and is 1418 km from the coast of Antarctica. The history and economic growth of the city is based on maritime commerce, oil extraction, and sheep breeding.
The city has all kinds of facilities, in particular an abundance of banks, shops, supermarkets, pharmacies, hiking gear shops and a duty free zone called "Zona Franca".
Don't trust the weather forecast, usually you can get rain, wind, and sun all in the same day. Snow is always expected to fall in the winter.
Punta Arenas is on the Brunswick Peninsula on the shore of the Magellan Strait connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and separating the South American mainland from Tierra del Fuego. A city of 140,000 inhabitants, it was founded by immigrants both from Europe and Chileans from further north. It boasts many grand buildings from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the golden age of the city.

Geography and climate[edit]
Church of María Auxiliadora
Punta Arenas is in the Magellanic pampa (pampa magallánica), that is, steppe with low hills. As such sheep grazing is the main agricultural business. West and south of the city the terrain gets more forested and mountains higher, this is the southern end of the Andes and where it "sinks" into the ocean with summits forming islands. South of the city is also Cape Froward, the southernmost point in mainland South America.
The climate is Subantarctic: cold and rainy. The cold Humboldt current, as well as chilly, strong winds influence the local climate, so while Punta Arenas is at a comparable latitude to Manchester, it's much colder. The summer from December to March is the best time to visit, it's windy but the average temperature is around 9 °C (48 °F). During winter it's less windy but average temperatures are below freezing, and nighttime lows of −15 °C (5 °F) are common. Rain is spread evenly throughout the year with 425 mm of yearly precipitation. Snow and frost may occur during most of the year.

History[edit]
Fuerte Bulnes, founded in 1843, was the first European permanent settlement in the region
Despite the harsh climate, many Native American peoples including the Selk'nam, Yámana, Aonikenk, and Kawésqar inhabited the region before the arrival of the Europeans. The first Europeans showing up were Ferdinand Magellan's expedition sailing through the strait in 1520. Over the years the strait became an active shipping route, but European settlement in the region didn't take off, aside of an 1584 attempt which later became known as "Puerto del Hambre" (Port of Hunger).
It would remain so until the mid-19th century when Argentina and Chile had border disputes in the region, and the Chilean garrison of Fuerte Bulnes was set up in 1843. In 1848 a civilian town was established a few kilometers north in an area then known as Punta Arenosa.
The city grew quickly with sheep farming, mining and other commercial activities, and in 1879 a gold rush attracted immigrants from Europe, particularly Croatia. But at the same time the region's native Selk'nam people, whose presence farmers and companies regarded as a "problem impairing the region's development", were at best mistreated and in the worst cases deported or killed; hunters were even paid for Selk'nam bodies. Due to this genocide, the number of native people in the region was down from 4,000 to 100 by 1930, and the last Selk'nam died in 1974.
When the Panama canal opened in 1914, the importance of the strait for international shipping declined, but it still remained a notable shipping route, and Punta Arenas one of the most developed cities in Chile. It was also an important base for Antarctic explorers during the early 20th century: Amundsen, Scott and Shackleton all passed through here. Today, tourism is an important part of the economy as the city is at the centre of Patagonia's natural attractions.

Tourist information[edit]
Chile Travel website on Punta Arenas
Get in[edit]
Punta Arenas can be reached by air, land, or sea.

By plane[edit]
-53.0025-70.8544441 Presidente Carlos Ibáñez del Campo International Airport (PUQ  IATA), Presidente Ibanez Apo (20 km north of city), ☏ +56 61 - 219131. Due to its remoteness, plane is the main way for getting to Punta Arenas. The airport, used both by civilian and military aircraft, is about 20 km north of the city and is the main airport of Chilean Patagonia. The airport is served by LATAM Chile, Aerovías DAP, JetSmart and Sky Airline, and there are flights from Santiago de Chile (your best option for coming from the rest of the world), minor airports in southern Chile and Argentina, and the Falkland Islands. There are also charter flights to Antarctica.   (updated Feb 2017)
By car[edit]
Punta Arenas doesn't have a road connection to Chile north of Patagonia (road construction is impossible due to the icefields), so you need to cross through Argentina. From northern and central Chile, the most common route goes via Osorno, turning east into Argentina, to San Carlos de Bariloche from where you continue by Ruta 40 southwards.
Alternatively you can continue along Carretera Austral on the Chilean side and cross the border as far south as near Coyhaique. In Argentina, Ruta 40 follows the Chilean border, and near Puerto Natales you can cross back into Chile. Alternatively you can continue all the way to Río Gallegos on the Atlantic coast.

From Puerto Natales[edit]
View of the road between Punta Arenas and Puerto Natales.
Crossing at Río Turbo near Puerto Natales, you will travel past some of the most impressive parts of Patagonia on both sides of the border; the Perito Moreno Glacier and Torres del Paine National Park. From Puerto Natales, the drive along Ruta 9 takes about three hours; the road is in a good shape and the landscape is pretty flat. A little before Punta Arenas, the road merges with the road from Río Gallegos.

From Río Gallegos[edit]
If you've started your roadtrip in eastern Argentina (e.g. Buenos Aires), followed Ruta 40 to the end, or crossed Argentina to the Atlantic coast and driven south along Ruta 3, you will pass Río Gallegos. From there it's a one-hour drive along the same highway to the Chilean border at Monte Aymond. From the border, Ruta 255 leads to Punta Arenas – this leg will take about two and a half hours.

From Tierra del Fuego[edit]
Starting your drive from Ushuaia and other places on Tierra del Fuego, there's one major road northwest, known as Ruta 3 on the Argentinian side. It's paved to San Sebastian just before the Chilean border, then gravel. The road, now Chilean Ruta 257 goes through steppe landscape to the Bahia Azul/Ponta Delgada ferry crossing. The crossing takes 20 minutes and no reservations are required, but bad weather can cancel the ferry traffic. On the northern side of the strait, the road joins the one from Río Gallegos.
It's also possible to drive along minor roads to Porvenir and cross directly to Punta Arenas (see below).

By bus[edit]
Despite its designation as a regional capital, there is no centralized bus station in Punta Arenas. Bookings should be made at the offices of the bus companies.

-53.16048-70.904352 Terminal Bus-Sur, Av. Cristobal Colón 842, ☏ +56 61 261 4224. Bus station for the regional bus company Bus-Sur. Nearby there are the termini for other major bus companies. 
There are buses from Patagonia's major cities, and some services from further away. There are frequent buses from Puerto Natales, from other places much less frequent. There are also buses from Ushuaia, with a trip time of 15 hours and including a ferry crossing. Important bus companies are Bus Sur, Buses Pacheco[dead link], Buses Fernández and Turibus.

Turibus and Quielen Bus have departures to Punta Arenas from Osorno crossing through Argentina. The trip takes about 36 hours, but it largely depends on how quickly you get through the two border crossings.
By boat[edit]
There's a ferry a few times a week from Porvenir in Tierra del Fuego across the strait (sailing time 2 hr 20 min), operated by Transbordadora Austral Broom. The ferry takes both cars and foot passengers. The same company also sails from Puerto Williams (once or twice a week, sailing time 32 hr) and Magdalena Island.
Cruise ships visit it often, especially in the austral summer from December to March. Mostly they start out of Ushuaia, but there are some cruises from as far away as Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Valparaíso.

Get around[edit]

The city is built around its main square "Plaza de Armas" where the imposing monument of Hernando de Magallanes is located. There is also a monument of a Magellan native, or Ona, that according to local legend if a tourist touches his foot it will return once again to the city. Another local legend to come back to the city is to eat Magellan Barberries (calafate), similar to blueberries.

Plaza Muñoz Gamero
Many of the main public buildings such as the town hall or the Union Club (Club de la Union) are found around Plaza de Armas. In general, Punta Arenas is compact and walkable, but it can get really windy. You will only need transportation for lengthier trips outside of it. For these trips, you can ask for a cab (taxi), a minivan (minibus), or a collective taxi (colectivo).

By bus[edit]
There's a public bus system, Movigas[dead link] with 4 lines. Lines star out from downtown to the suburbs, and therefore not so good for getting around the central parts of the city, where most points of interest are.

By taxi[edit]
Taxis are readily available and fares are affordable. There are also colectivos (route taxis).

By car[edit]
To get to attractions outside the city, consider renting a car. Popular tourist attractions outside the city can also be accessed by tour.
