Cambridge Narrows Regional Library
Cambridge-Narrows is a village of 700 people (2011) in Queens County, south-central New Brunswick, Canada.
It lies on Washademoak Lake, in the centre of and almost equidistant from New Brunswick's 3 largest cities, Saint John, Fredericton and Moncton.
The village straddles Washedemoak Lake, a navigable tributary of the Saint John River.
The village was formed by the amalgamation of two separate settlements on either side of the river, Cambridge and The Narrows, which merged in 1966.
Once a rich farming community, today this area is increasingly becoming primarily a vacation and summer destination, with numerous cottages up and down the shores of the lake.
