Casinos on Main Street, Black Hawk, Colorado
Black Hawk is a city in Gilpin County in Colorado's Front Range. Also known as "The City of Mills". It is a popular destination because casino gambling is legal. Nestled up in the Rocky Mountains with beautiful scenery and a 35-minute drive from Denver, Colorado


Understand[edit]
With a population of 127 in 2020, it is the least populated city in Colorado. It is one of Colorado's oldest cities where prospector John H. Gregory first discovered lode gold. Blackhawk quickly became the milling center for the gold ore mined throughout the county. City leaders banded together with Central City and Cripple Creek on the 1990 Colorado ballot to allow limited stakes gambling in the commercial districts of the towns. The measure passed and gaming began on October 1, 1991. In 2008 additional legislation was introduced to raise the betting limit, introduce new table games and allow casinos to stay open 24 hours.
