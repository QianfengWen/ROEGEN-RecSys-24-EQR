Stay safe[edit]
There are some areas of Yonkers which you should avoid – especially during the nighttime hours. These areas include some neighborhoods in South Yonkers, such as Nodine Hill. These areas suffer from a high level of gang violence and drugs. However, there is little of interest in these areas for the average tourist.
The Yonkers Police Department constantly patrols the city and will be happy to assist you if you need help or have an emergency.
Like in the rest of the United States, you can contact emergency services by dialing 911.
