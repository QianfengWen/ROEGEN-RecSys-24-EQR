Geldrop is a town of 29,000 people (2021) in North Brabant in the Netherlands. It's located at easy biking distance from Eindhoven, but is mostly surrounded by heathlands and forest area. It is this combination of nature and nearby big city facilities that draws in visitors. In fact, with over 280,000 overnight stays a year (both business and tourist), Geldrop hosts far more visitors than you might expect from a town its size. It's a fine base to explore the natural surroundings and a more peaceful alternative to staying in Eindhoven. And the best is, there's even a few sights worth seeing, in particular the charming Geldrop castle right in the town centre.


Understand[edit]
Brigida church
For centuries, textile production was the main economic activity in Geldrop. In the 19th century, it had the second largest wool production centre in the country, second only after Tilburg. The textile production declined rapidly after the 1960s, however, until is was almost entirely gone in the 1970s. Today, the Weaving Museum reminds of those glory days of industry. Local authorities are now trying to stimulate the existing recreation and tourism industry further, hoping to develop it into the area's main source of income.
