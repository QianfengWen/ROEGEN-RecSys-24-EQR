Santa Rosa is the capital of  La Pampa Province.

Plaza San Martín

Understand[edit]
A city of about 100,000 that serves as an important agricultural center for Argentina, Santa Rosa is a rather unassuming mecca that may not be the most exciting place but still has a few attractions. It lies in a transitional geographical area on the western edge of the Pampas, allowing for some breaks and undulating slopes to the west.

Get in[edit]
Santa Rosa Airport affords direct flights to/from Buenos Aires. Otherwise, it can be a rather daunting 7 hour drive along Highway 5 between Santa Rosa and the nation's capital.

While not a swimming locale really due to turbidity (umm, duck pond?), it is a nice place to relax and fish for pejerrey (Neotropical silversides), or observe a bird island sanctuary. There is also a miniature train called El Puelchito (originating from San Martin Square), a system of bike and hiking paths, and the availability of canoe and water bike rentals and even rides aboard a motorized vessel called the Salitrero. Surrounding the lake are some monuments like a cross and lighthouse. (updated Jul 2021)
