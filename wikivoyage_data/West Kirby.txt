West Kirby is on the Wirral Peninsula in Merseyside.
Hoylake is an idyllic seaside town overlooking the Irish Sea with views of Wales, Hilbre Island and Liverpool. International tourism booms during major golf tournaments at the Royal Liverpool Golf Club.


Understand[edit]

Get around[edit]
See[edit]
Hilbre Island
53.38449-3.228691 Hilbre Island (about 40 minutes walk from the noticeboard, adjacent to the Wirral Sailing Centre, at the end of Dee Lane in West Kirby). The island group consists of Hilbre (pronounced HILL-bree) itself, Middle Eye and Little Eye. Walk out to Hilbre or its smaller (and closer) outcrop, Little Eye (be very careful of tides: read guidance on signs near the boathouse, at northern end of the marine lake). A raincoat and wellies or sturdy, waterproof walking boots are recommended for the walk across. To get to the island accepted wisdom is, when the tide is on the ebb to walk from West Kirby from the northern end of the Marine Lake to Little Eye first and then around the "back" of Middle Eye avoiding what can be impassable gullies to the "front" of the islands, and thence to Hilbre itself. Crossing when unsure of the tides can mean, at best, being isolated on the islands until the tide ebbs, or at worst, the risk of being caught between fast flowing tidal gullies. The walker should not be tempted to walk direct to Hilbre from "Red Rocks" at the end of Stanley Rd Hoylake. Free.   (updated Sep 2021)
Canoeing on West Kirby Marine Lake
53.36756-3.1872 West Kirby Marine Lake. The marine lake can be viewed from the lengthy promenade, which has parking, plus benches to enjoy the often busy sailing activity. There is also a walkway around the marine lake, which provides very good views of the summer sunset. Free. 
The Old Village is quite pretty; visit St. Bridget's church, maybe walk through Ashton Park, which straddles the Wirral Way, itself a lengthy stroll along the bed of an old rail branchline, with fine views.

This is now the start of the Wirral Way, at this end, as it was extended from Hadlow Road to make it easier to access by train from Liverpool via the Merseyrail system. The Wirral Way is very popular with pedestrians, dog walkers, horse riders and cyclists.). Wirral Country Park features a 12-mile footpath following the line of the old West Kirby to Hooton railway line, offering superb views over the Dee Estuary to Wales.
