Bridgwater is a town in Somerset. Notable buildings include the Church of St Mary and Blake Museum, which is a largely restored house in Blake Street and was the birthplace of Admiral Blake in 1598. The town has an arts centre and plays host to the annual Bridgwater Guy Fawkes Carnival. 


Understand[edit]
Much like Bridgnorth, it is notable for its lack of 'e' in its first syllable.
