Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Reidsville was established in the early 19th century as an outpost and stop on the stage line that ran between Salisbury, North Carolina, and Danville, Virginia, and was known as Wright's Crossroads. The community grew from a single home and inn owned by the family of Reuben Reid, a local farmer and businessman, into a thriving farming community primarily supporting tobacco production and cigarette manufacturing. Reidsville was incorporated as a town by the North Carolina State Legislature in 1873. It became a key location of the American Tobacco Company which employed many city and county residents. The American Tobacco Company was the mainstay of Reidsville economics until its sale and closure in 1994. Many textile mills were established in Reidsville as well, with Cone Mills and Burlington Industries, located in Burlington North Carolina, consolidating most of them in the mid-20th century, although most have now closed.
