Cobalt is a town of 1,100 people (2016) in Northern Ontario. One of the "Tri-Towns" of the area, Cobalt chose to remain a separate town when Haileybury and New Liskeard to the north merged to become Temiskaming Shores.


Understand[edit]
Main street Cobalt
Cobalt, like so many other mining towns when mining the ores became uneconomical, is a shadow of its former self.
Cobalt ores were found here in 1884, although it wasn't until 1904 when the town was named after the mineral. The boom times started in 1903 when high-grade silver was discovered, leading to the town's nickname "Silver City". By 1908, Cobalt was the single largest producer of silver and cobalt in the world, and the population was over 10,000. However, all booms eventually bust, and mining tapered off in the 1930s as gold was discovered further north (in Kirkland Lake and Timmins). There was a smaller boom in the 1950s, but the last mine closed in the 1980s. 
However, there's still some cobalt in the ground here, and the early-21st-century appetite for the element in lithium-ion batteries might touch off another boom.
