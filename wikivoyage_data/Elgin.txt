Elgin is the county town of Moray in northeast Scotland, best known for its ruined cathedral which made it a "city". Together with nearby Lossiemouth it's the service town for two nearby Royal Air Force bases, with a population in 2016 of 24,760. 


Understand[edit]
Ornithosuchus was one of the beasts that dragged its slithery tail across the Triassic sands that became the bedrock of Elgin: imagine a 2-m-tall crocodile walking on its hind legs. (Towards you, quite rapidly, with a glint in its eye.) This and other strange local reptiles are exhibited in the Elgin museum. But the later value of that sandstone was to provide something to build upon and with, originally on higher ground 5 miles south. A town grew on the present site from the 12th century, under the patronage of Alexander II, and the cathedral foundations were laid. It would become one of the most serially-wrecked cathedrals in the country: sometimes "wyld, wykked Heland-men" were the culprits, but pretty much everyone had a go at it except the walking crocodiles.
The "Elgin Marbles" have only a tenuous connection with the town. It was the 7th Earl of Elgin who in the early 19th century removed (or looted or legally purchased or rescued from destruction, take your pick) many friezes and sculptures from the Acropolis in Athens — they're now in the British Museum in London. But the family residences were in Fife and elsewhere, and none of the Earls of Elgin lived here.
Tourist Information is in the library near the cathedral, open M-F 10AM-8PM, Sa 10:00-16:00.

Elgin is a good base for exploring the many distilleries of Moray and Speyside whisky.
It's also midway between the cities of Inverness and Aberdeen, each around an hour's drive away.
On the Moray Firth coast there are opportunities for dolphin-watching, and you can visit the offbeat  Findhorn Foundation - a 1960s new age community which has become an ecological living centre, with self-built houses, circular meditation room, and wind turbines.
Lossiemouth is a few miles north on the coast.
Forres to the west has a Pictish stone and a monument to Nelson, but the star attraction is Brodie Castle 5 miles west.
