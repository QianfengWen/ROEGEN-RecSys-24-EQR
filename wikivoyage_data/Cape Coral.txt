Cape Coral is a city in Southwest Florida. Visitors are drawn by its beaches, nature trails and sea kayaking opportunities on Black Island in Lovers Key State Park.


Get in[edit]
South Cape Beach
By air[edit]
If you are flying you will likely either fly to Southwest Florida International Airport (RSW IATA). Regional airports further afield include Tampa International Airport (TPA IATA) or Punta Gorda Airport (PGD IATA).

By car[edit]
Cape Coral is directly west of Ft. Myers, in Lee County Florida. Since it is a "cape" two points of entry are by bridge. There are four points of entry into Cape Coral Florida:

Veteran's Memorial Parkway Bridge
Cape Coral Parkway Bridge (both bridges have a toll, the toll is reduced by 50% if you have a LeeWay transponder and are enrolled in the discount program. In fact, with the discount, the toll is as little as 25 cents during off-peak times).
Pine Island Parkway/ Bayshore Dr. from North Ft. Myers which is a free alternative.
Get into the NW Cape via Burnt Store Rd., from Punta Gorda, in Charlotte County.
Get around[edit]
Santa Barbara Boulevard divides the city into east and west, while Hancock Bridge Parkway (east of Santa Barbara) and Embers Parkway (west of Santa Barbara) divide the city into north and south. Thoroughfares going east to west are: Pine Island Parkway, Veterans Memorial Parkway, Cape Coral Parkway, and El Dorado Dr (listed from northernmost to southernmost). The North and South are Del Prado, Santa Barbara, and Chiquita (taken from easternmost to westernmost).  The Cape is large and flat, areas are laid out far from one another; driving is a must. Cape Coral is the 2nd largest city in Florida by square mileage, so expect things to be spread out.   The southernmost tip has the largest concentration of businesses and homes.  A bike lane is provided and can be a handy way to navigate the SE and SW portions if you're inclined to be in those residential only areas.
If travelling by bus, regional operator Leetran provides an acceptable service with departures at least every hour. Fares are $1.50 with day and week passes available.

For an enjoyable shopping experience spend time on Sanibel's Perriwinkle Way or for a mall experience go to the Edison Mall (SW Florida's largest) in Fort Myers.

Eat[edit]
A number of small restaurants may be found anywhere in the Cape. Although chains are also popping up around Cape Coral including Ruby Tuesdays and Jason's Deli off Santa Barbara and Houlihans on Cape Coral Parkway, try to stick to the local hang-outs. Many more dining options can be found along Cleveland Avenue, which is a short drive (15 min) away in Fort Myers.
