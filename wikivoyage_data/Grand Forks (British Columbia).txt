Understand[edit]
Kettle River Railway Bridge
The city is in the traditional territory of the Sinixt people, who lived here for at least 10,000 years. Bounded by tall mountains, they interacted with nearby First Nations, but settlers did not arrive until the early 19th century. Smallpox epidemics in the late 18th and early 20th centuries killed some 80% of the population. The 49th parallel border imposed by US and Britain divided the Sinixt territory in two. Most people ended up living south of the border, in the Colville Indian Reservation. The completion of the Grand Coulee Dam blocked salmon migrations up the Columbia River, ending centuries of salmon culture and removing a food source. In 1956 the Canadian government declared the "Arrow Lakes Band" as extinct. However, Sinixt descendants continue to leave in Vallican.
Small numbers of settlers visited the region early in the 19th century, but in the 1890s the development of copper mining brought about permanent settlement. The present city of Grand Forks was established in 1897. Between 1900-1910, pacifist Russian settlers known as "Doukhobors" settled in the area. The population reached 1500 by 1911.
The city of Grand Forks has a population of some 4,000 people (2016), and 10,000 or so live in the Grand Forks area.
