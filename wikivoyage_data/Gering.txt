Gering, the seat of Scottsbluff county, is a relatively small city south of Scottsbluff. Gering is the oldest of the Scottsbluff/Gering/Terrytown Triplets.


Understand[edit]
Developed in 1887 on the North Platte River with the extension of the Oregon Trail, Gering retains most of it's "old feel" despite much modern building and renovations. As of 2020, Gering was home to about 8500 people.

History[edit]
In 1887, Gering was laid out southeast of the Scottsbluff National Monument when the Oregon Trail crossed the North Platte River, and then the Western Pacific Railroad crossed the area, providing really easy access to the area.
In 1922, the Oregon Trail Days began their annual celebration in Gering, a well known West Nebraska tradition.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The closest available airport is the Western Nebraska Regional Airport that provides local access to Cheyenne and Denver, as well as Casper

By car[edit]
The Scottsbluff micro-politan area is deemed the 5th largest in the Continental United States not to be served by an interstate, behind Fresno, Bakersfield, Palmdale, and Lancaster.

From the south, travel north on Highway 71, take the Gering exit, turn right onto M street
or, from the north-west  use US 26 and turn onto Highway 71, take the Old Highway 92 ramp.
By bus[edit]
The 41.821187-103.6606631 Denver Shuttle goes between Scottsbluff, Cheyenne, and Denver daily, the station is more in Gering than Scottsbluff, making it a walk in the park!

Get around[edit]
For about 2.5 x 2 miles of space that Gering grew up in, everything can be reached by walking except in winter, when the snow can make the city hard to get around in, and driving is preferred. But other than that, walk!

By car[edit]




Remember the Grid!

Numbered Streets increase from east to west.

Take your car for convenience for 1/2 mile drives.

On foot[edit]
Walk to see Downtown; sidewalks are in fair condition.

By public transportation[edit]
Gering is supported by a local bus system, known as the Tri-city roadrunner, which is headquartered in Scottsbluff, but serves the entire area. Two routes run at an hourly basis, so it is a good idea to pick up a schedule and thoroughly plan your route.
There are a few handibus systems available, such as the Panhandle Partnership[dead link].
By taxi[edit]
Taxis have to be called; don't expect to hail them on the street.

By train[edit]
The Western Pacific runs through town. You don't want to hit it at the wrong time, as you will have to wait over 15 minutes for a slow train.
