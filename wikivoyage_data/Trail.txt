Thunderstorms are common during the late-Spring and Summer season, often moving into the valley from the south. The fall months bring dense river fog, especially overnight and in the morning, as a cold air inversion lingers above the relatively warm river surface.

Reaching Canadian viewpoints flags around Trail[edit]
Mountain bikers stop at 2nd Champion Lake outside the Village of Fruitvale near Greater Trail
Each hike offers excellent 1-hour to 2½-hour hikes up to the flag viewpoints, and the trails can be accessed by novice to avid hiking enthusiasts. You can hike to the 49.10619-117.70323 East Trail Canadian flag viewpoint via the McQuarrie Creek trail route. The one-hour hike to the top sees hikers viewing across the Columbia River towards West Trail, Warfield, and Rossland. The flag can be seen waving in the wind above the regional hospital near the viewpoint. Park in the 49.10276-117.698984 J.L. Crowe High School parking area and follow the McQuarrie Creek hiking trail up alongside the creek that comes down to meet the road where it intersects to the J. Lloyd Crowe Secondary School or the Kootenay Boundary Regional Hospital. The McQuarrie Creek hiking is a fairly easy trial if you take your time. Parts of the trail can be steep.

A hiker poses at Canadian Flag Viewpoint above Sunningdale, Trail
An alternative route to the East Trail Flag viewpoint above the hospital is to take the easier trail leading from the upper Miral Heights area of Trail. At the Shavers Bench/Miral Heights traffic lights turn up to Miral heights sub-division and follow McBride Street. to Albert Drive. The trailhead is at the end of Albert Dr. and it is equally enjoyable and scenic route to the flag viewpoint.
Another good hike is the Upper Sunningdale Sandhill viewpoint hiking trail. The trail-head can be reached by driving to the Upper Sunningdale Park on Marianna Crescent where you can safely park your car at the park entrance. Walk west down Marianna Crescent until you reach the Sandspit Road. Walk up past the chain link fence, and look for the trail-head on the right just past the granite rocks which can be seen in the water runoff ditch. This 40 minute, easy level rating hiking trail is clearly marked, and the steepest part of the trail heads up past the pine trees at the start of the trail, and then you follow the trail along the sandhill ridge until you reach the viewpoint just below the Sandhill plateau above the Upper Sunningdale Park.
Another Canadian flag waves above Sunningdale, and can be viewed from most areas of Upper and Lower Sunningdale. If you want to take a longer hike than the Upper Sunningdale Sandhill viewpoint, you can hike further, by taking the trail that heads from the Sandhill viewpoint, towards the rock cliffs. Take the clearly marked trail up past a number of rock cliffs to the Sunningdale Canadian Flag viewpoint to reach the Canadian Flag.

Hiking trail near Trail BC
The hike rating for the Sunningdale Canadian Flag viewpoint on Mount Heinze is an intermediate level, and you can make it up to the viewpoint in approximately 2½ hours, as most of the hiking trail is clearly marked, but sections of the trail up near the swamps below the flag viewpoint on Mount Heinze can be thick with brush. Leave enough time to hike back down, so the best time to make this hike is in the early morning. Be bear and wild animal aware, and make lots of noise if you startle a bear. Always pack enough water, or 1 to 2 litres of your favourite hiking drink, and pack a lunch and your digital camera for this hike, as the views of the local area are spectacular from this viewpoint.
From each of the Sunningdale hiking trail vantage points, you'll get a beautiful view of the sub-division of Sunningdale, Bingay Bay (Sandy Island), the Columbia River as it flows towards Gyro and past downtown Trail, Teck Cominco's lead and zinc smelter property (which is relatively green and clean looking), Tadanac, Rivervale, and up towards Warfield, Rossland, and Red and Granite Mountain ski hills.
