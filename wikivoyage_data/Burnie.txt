Burnie is the fourth largest city in Tasmania, with a population of around 20,000. It is on the northwestern coast of Tasmania.

West Beach
Once renowned as a single-industry town with scant concern for the environment, Burnie has undergone a significant transformation into an attractive coastal city with a diverse economy.  Burnie retains an industrial deep-water port, but also enjoys the luxury of several attractive north-facing beaches upon which pleasant and functional public spaces have been and are being developed. Burnie is a popular tourist location as it is close to many great attractions, like the Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park, the Stanley Nut, the Mole Creek Karst National Park, and the Rocky Cape National Park.

Walls of Jerusalem National Park – a beautiful less visited national park. You'll need to make careful preparations for a true bush experience since there's no direct road access and no visitor facilities. Landscapes are as lyrically beautiful as are some of their Biblical names: The Damascus Gate, Herods Gate, King Davids Peak, Solomons Throne, The Pool of Bethesda, and Lake Salome.
