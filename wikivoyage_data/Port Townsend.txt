Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
 to  From U.S. 101 at the tip of Discovery Bay, SR-20 splits off and runs 30 mi (48 km) into downtown.  Traffic coming from the Seattle area will want to take the Downtown to Bainbridge Island or the Edmonds to Kingston Ferries towards the peninsula.  Driving the land route alone, Port Townsend is roughly a two-hour drive north of Olympia, and one hour east of Port Angeles.
 to  SR-19 comes up from SR-104 west of the Kingston Ferry Terminal and terminates at SR-20 just south of town.

By public transit[edit]
From Seattle, there are two options to reach Port Townsend by Jefferson Transit:
Routes 7 & 390: Take the ferry to Bainbridge Island, then Kitsap Transit 390 bus to North Viking Park and Ride in Poulsbo, and then Jefferson Transit bus route 7 to Haines P&R (south of town) from Poulsbo. If coming from Snohomish County, north of Seattle, one can also take the ferry from Edmonds to Kingston and take Kitsap Transit #307 bus to Poulsbo or the #14 bus directly to Port Townsend. If going to the airport take the Link Light Rail #1 (towards Angle Lake) from downtown Seattle. The connections are timed and it takes about two and a half hours.
Route 14: Take the Kitsap Transit Fast Ferry to Kingston, then transfer to the Jefferson Transit bus route 14.
From Port Angeles and Sequim:
Routes 8 & 30: From Port Angeles take Clallam Transit #30 (101 Commuter) or 123 (Strait Shot) to the Sequim Transit Center and transfer to the #8 bus to Port Townsend (Haines P&R).
From Olympia and Shelton:
Route 1 and Mason Transit #6 & 8: From Olympia take Mason Transit #6 bus from the downtown Transit Center to Shelton and transfer to the #8 bus. Take the #8 bus up to Triton Cove and transfer to Jefferson Transit #1 to Haines P&R. Notify driver of transfer when going towards Olympia as there is a close connection time. Caveat with this option is that they operate twice daily during the week and once on Saturdays. Therefore, a missed connection will ruin your day.
Routes 620 and 594: Alternatively take Intercity #620 bus from Olympia to the SR 512 P&R in Lakewood (south of Tacoma) and transfer to Sound Transit 592 or 594 bus to downtown Seattle (see above). The buses run more frequently between Olympia and Seattle then from Olympia to Port Townsend via Shelton and Triton Cove.

Map of Port Townsend
Port Townsend has a compact, walkable, gridded center, divided into Downtown and Uptown.
