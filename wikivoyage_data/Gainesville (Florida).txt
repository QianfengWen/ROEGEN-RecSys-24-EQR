Drink[edit]
There are bars all over Gainesville. It's traditionally known as a huge drinking town.
The town in general isn't quite as hip and wild as it once was. As admission standards at the university continue to rise, a different crowd has trickled in. But there's still plenty of diversity, and partying, in Gainesville.
The area referred to as mid-town, directly across the street from the school on University Ave., has some of the more traditional Gainesville bars. Grog House, Salty Dog, Balls, XS, and Gator City all share the same building.  Almost any night of the week one can find great specials and large crowds.  Nearby is the restaurant/bar Swamp housed in a former professor's house. It is a can't-miss both for the atmosphere and the decent food.
The downtown area is a combination of clubs and more laid back bars.  Places like the Loosey's, Lillian's (a former music store) and Stubby's, a bar that features hundreds of imported beers, cater to an older crowd. Clubs such as :08 and Sky having dancing and music but are usually most crowded on "ladies' night."  
Bars close at 2AM due to the "Rave Law", passed in the late 1990s when Gainesville became one of Florida's premier rave scenes. Last call can be as early as 1:30AM. After the bars close, roads can be dangerous due to drunk drivers.
