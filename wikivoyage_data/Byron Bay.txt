Clarkes Beach with Cape Byron in the distance
Byron Bay is a coastal town famous (or perhaps infamous) for its enthusiastic wellness movement and celebrities in the Northern Rivers ‘Rainbow Region’ of New South Wales, just off the M1 Pacific Motorway, approximately 800 km north of Sydney and 175 km south of Brisbane. Cape Byron is the easternmost point on the Australian mainland.


Understand[edit]
The traditional owners of the area are the Bundjalung Nation of the Arakwal, Minjungbal and the Widjabul people. Byron Bay is famed worldwide for its surfing beaches, scuba diving, whale watching, rural beauty and laid-back lifestyle. It is a well-known destination for celebrities - international as well as local, as well established and aspiring Intergram Influencers. It is a major tourist centre; the area having experienced a dramatic increase to 1.7 million+ visitors per year. The town and surrounding area have a population of about 30,000.
The community of Suffolk Park lies a five-minute drive south, along Tallow Beach. It's a quieter alternative to the heart of Byron, but for most services you will need to make the trip into Byron. The towns of Bangalow and Nimbin lie inland, less than an hour's drive away. Lennox Head and Ballina are to the south.
There are many thriving "wellness" home-based businesses focused on alternative, holistic, cultural and knowledge industries, with a growing population of artists, writers and filmmakers. Byron Bay is renowned for capturing the hearts of the people that visit and many end up staying; the community spirit in the town and the surrounding area is strong.

By plane[edit]
Ballina/Byron Airport (BNK IATA) is the nearest airport, around 30 minutes drive away at Ballina. There are flights from Sydney and Melbourne. Airport transport options. There are regular shuttle services from the airport and most of them are door to door. Book online to save money. Xcede Airport Transfers[dead link] and Steve's Tours Airport Express[dead link] offer shuttle services direct to your door from $18. Blanchs bus service costs $10, but isn't door to door and travels through other towns on the way.
Gold Coast Airport (OOL IATA) is around 1 hour away at Coolangatta and has domestic flights and international flights from New Zealand, Malaysia, and Japan. It often has cheaper flights and cheaper car hire than Ballina. There are a number of transport operators from the airport to Byron Bay. For example, Byron Bay - Surfers Express do pick-up and drop-off at the airport in their runs between Byron Bay and Surfers Paradise for $27. Xcede Airport Transfers[dead link] offer shuttle services direct to the door.

By bus[edit]
Regular coach services travel between Sydney and Brisbane via Byron Bay.

By car[edit]
Byron is around 7 hours drive from Sydney, a good day's drive, with many possibilities to stop and rest.  Traffic on the Pacific Motorway gets busy during school holiday periods (both Qld and NSW). During summer the Ewingsdale Road route in and out of town from the Pacific Motorway can get crowded and slow. When coming from the south on the highway in holiday periods, avoid traffic delays on Ewingsdale Road by taking the Lennox Head exit from the motorway at Ross Lane and enter Byron from the south.
Byron is only just over an hour from the Gold Coast, and just over two hours from Brisbane via the M1.

By tour[edit]
Many surfing or backpacker tours along the east coast.

By train[edit]
Trains no longer stop next to the Railway Hotel as the rail line is closed except for a 2 km shuttle service to Sunrise Beach.  You can transfer to a coach from the train at Casino.  You can buy a through ticket. Casino is located quite a distance from Byron Bay and it might often be best to get a bus directly to Byron, saving a lot of trouble. Or, if you are lucky enough most of the domestic airlines have sales on pretty consistently from most major cities to the Gold Coast, Brisbane and less frequently Ballina. All of these are closer than Casino and may be cheaper if you find the right sale.

Get around[edit]
There is limited regular public transport within Byron Bay, operated by Blanch's Bus Company - however most destinations within the bay are walkable, including The Lighthouse Walk.
The Byron Shire Council has installed parking ticket machines, with the fee being $2 per hour.

See[edit]
-28.6385153.63621 Cape Byron. European history began in 1770 when Captain James Cook found a safe anchorage and named the cape after John Byron, grandfather of the poet Lord Byron. It is mainland Australia's easternmost point. There is a lighthouse on the cliffs above the ocean (not on the tip of the cape). The walk from town along the walking track up to the lighthouse is amazing. It is about 20 min from the parking at the start of the walk along the beach. Parking at the top is $7, and worth it on a hot day. There's a cafe near the lighthouse. The entire walking track makes a 3.7 km loop around the cape, including the tip.   (updated Sep 2016)
-28.5469153.4972 Mullumbimby (21 km northwest of Byron Bay). Scenic hinterland town situated at the foot of Mount Chincogan beside the banks of the Brunswick River. Mullumbimby is fondly known as "The Biggest Little Town in Australia" and is a hub of counterculture.

Do[edit]
Surfing[edit]
Byron Bay has good surf with a variety of beaches within the town limits. It has occupied the imagination of Australians for many years for its climate, lifestyle and warm water.

 Byron Main. The best-known beach in Byron usually has smaller waves that break close to shore. At the southern end of the beach lies the Pass, which can get very crowded, along with Byron Main, on summer days but is perfect for long boarding with wide rollers that go forever. 
 Wategos Beach. Just around the corner from the Pass and Byron Main. It is somewhat hidden from view, lying on the north side of the Byron point. Wategos has a cult longboarder crowd because its waves generally don't have as much push as other breaks. It generally has smaller surf than the Pass. The surf runs west towards Byron Main and takes a bit more skill to paddle out to than the Pass or the main beach. The Pass is always crowded when the winds or swell are right, and because of the easy paddle it has a lot of beginners which can make it very dangerous with wayward boards. 
 Tallow Beach. The least known and least used Byron beach by those who don't surf. Tallow Beach is on the south side of the Byron headland, is very long and has a variety of breaks along its length. The surf is generally larger as most swells go straight into it. It is uncommon to see tourists along this beach because the only place from which it can be seen in Byron is the top of the Byron headland. 
It is not uncommon to surf among pods of common dolphins as the evening winds down in Byron, especially if you are surfing Wategos or the Pass.
If you visit Byron Bay without a surfboard, you can hire one online in the Bay for US$20 a day and US$120 a week at http://www.rentasurfboard.com

Beachgoing[edit]
 Swimming. Byron Main Beach is patrolled all summer, with other beaches patrolled during the Christmas School Holidays, including Wategoes. Clarkes beach is to the east of the main beach but before the Pass and its sheltered location means it is almost always good for kids. In winter, it can be a bit chilly to consider swimming at Byron with daytime temperatures on average only reaching around 20C. 
 Sunbake. Topless sunbathing is common and accepted in Byron. 
A clothing optional beach called Belongil is situated north of the Byron Beach Club at Tyagarah. Access via Grays Lane and a walking track from the Pacific Highway.

Marine activities[edit]
 Byron Bay Whale Watching. September and October are the best whale watching months.

Sleep[edit]
Byron Bay is a well established destination for backpackers, schoolies, families and couples, and there is a choice of accommodation styles catering to all of them. Most local real estate agents handle holiday house rentals, and there are many in the beach areas, and even further into suburban Byron. Some bed-and-breakfasts have been created by building additions to once suburban Byron houses. Camping on the beach is illegal and council rangers will issue fines if you camp for free. Camp at Belongil fields or Byron tourist village if you need somewhere cheap to camp and it never gets full. You can set up camp at night and pay the next morning.

Respect[edit]
Residents of this area are well known for embracing alternative lifestyles, and you can encounter beliefs around health, nutrition, medicine and other aspects that are very different from the considered 'mainstream' of Australian society. Byron Bay area has a relatively high number of people who are strongly anti-vaccination for example. Some of these views may prove difficult for you to understand, but it should go without saying that you should be respectful of the people who hold them.

Stay safe[edit]
Be careful of drink spiking - always keep your drink in view and don't accept drinks from strangers.
Swimming- as in anywhere on the coast in Australia, always swim between the flags. Avoid swimming at night especially on your own. Follow all instructions from lifeguards.
 North Coast Medical Centre, 24 Shirley St, ☏ +61 2 6685 8666, reception@northcoastmedicalcentre.com.au. M-F 9AM-6PM. Need a doctor? You'll find both traditional and alternative ones at this medical centre. 

Go next[edit]
Go and explore the southerly parts of Tourist Drive 30.
Explore the 'Rainbow Region' - rural towns and sleepy villages, set in lush and particularly scenic countryside.  The area is famed as a haven for alternative culture. Nimbin, Mullumbimby and the Channon are the favourite towns to visit in this region. There is a popular market in the Channon once a month, well on the tourist trail.  Bangalow features a nice relaxed old-town main street.
There are many scenic wonders in the area. Byron area has many rainforests & parks. The volcanic plug of Mount Warning is a favourite tour. It can be reached by driving into Murwillumbah and following the roads to the small village of Uki. There are many waterfalls like Minyon Falls (direction Federal-Rosebank), Protester Falls (the Channon area) and Wanganui Falls (Wilsons Creek). The drive to these falls is very scenic as it follows the creek and a narrow valley and some nice rainforest.
Brunswick Heads is a nice day trip. The pub is a good place to relax for a meal by the river and it has some quieter beaches. Between Byron Bay and Ballina there is a nice coastal drive which passes through the quiet coastal town of Lennox Head. If you stick to the coastal roads, you will see many more beaches and coastal scenery than the highway.
