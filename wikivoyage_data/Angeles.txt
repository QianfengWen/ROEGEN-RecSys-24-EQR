Angeles is a city in Pampanga province. The city is rich in history and heritage, with old and historical significant buildings dotting its landscape, but these days it is best known for its high concentration of casinos and sometimes questionable nightlife (though that's changing; see "Drink" below). Aside from these, it is also famous for its extreme sports adventures in the lahar flows of Mt. Pinatubo.


Understand[edit]
15°9′53″N 120°35′7″EMap of Angeles
Angeles is a thriving regional city partly due to its long history of western influence: its Clark Freeport Zone was the massive American Clark Airbase (previously named Fort Stotsenberg) from 1898 until 1991. In 1899, it became the seat of the Philippine government under General Emilio Aguinaldo and the site of the first anniversary celebration of Philippine independence. After World War II, it had the highest concentration of American expatriates as well as Filipino mestizos, some of whom chose to settle here permanently. Today Angeles is known for its booming nightlife and is becoming increasingly popular as a tourist destination, particularly from South Korea. Its center, Balibago, is especially known for its fine restaurants, hotels and shopping malls. Within Balibago is the neon-lit Fields Avenue, known for its bars, nightclubs and what could be one of the world's largest concentration of go-go bars. Adjoining Clark Freeport Zone is the site of world-class resorts, casinos, duty-free shops and beautifully landscaped golf courses. The city, and the rest of the Pampanga region, is known as the culinary center of the Philippines.
While Angeles is administratively separate from Pampanga, Wikivoyage treats it as part of Pampanga. This page also covers Mabalacat, while a city on its own, is more of a suburb of Angeles; it houses the Clark Freeport Zone that has the airport.

Get in[edit]
Angeles is well connected by road to any place on Luzon and it has a busy international airport.

By plane[edit]
15.185833120.5597221 Clark International Airport (CRK  IATA) (in Clark Freeport Zone, approximately 5 km from Angeles). Also called Diosdado Macapagal International Airport (DMIA)   (updated Sep 2023)
Many budget airlines fly to Clark because it is reasonably close to Metro Manila and has lower landing fees than Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport. For travelers, Clark is often more convenient than heavily-congested Manila, especially if your final destination is in the northern Philippines. If you are headed further south, to the Visayas or Mindanao, then Cebu Airport is another alternative.
Flights arrive at a newer and larger terminal built to the north and opened 2022; it will also connect to the future airport rail link to Manila. The older and smaller terminal has been permanently closed.
The airport has adequate travel facilities such as currency exchange, duty free shopping center, souvenir shops, free wireless internet, a tourist information center, hotel and travel agency representatives, and car rental services. The roadways around the airport are fairly rural, making transport between the airport and the city quick and hassle-free.





Onward ticket required
As anywhere in the Philippines, tourist visa requirements include having an onward ticket; if you do not have a return ticket then you must have another ticket out of the country or they will not let you in. Most airlines check this when you go to check in for a flight to the Philippines, and will not let you board without it.


Flights include:

Scoot Air - Singapore.
Jin Air - Seoul and Busan.
Cebu Pacific -Singapore, Hong Kong, Macau.
Asiana Airlines. - Seoul.
Qatar Airways. - Doha.
Emirates. - Dubai.
Jetstar Asia. - Singapore.
China Eastern Airlines. - Shanghai
Domestic flights are offered by Cebu Pacific and Air Asia to Cebu. Davao, and Kalibo which gives access to Boracay.

Ground transportation[edit]
Don't worry about finding transport as taxi drivers will heavily solicit you for patronage as you exit the airport. However, the taxi fares are steep compared to other modes of transportation, so for example, the fare from the airport to Fields is ₱500 for a 15-minute ride.
Some possible alternatives to avoid this rip-off are:

Use the Grab app, and hail your own taxi online just as you exit the terminal. The price varies with demand, but is generally ₱200 to ₱300 from or to the airport, as of 2020.
To get to the airport from Dau Bus Terminal the "cheap way": take a jeepney to the main gate (₱8). At the main gate ask for the jeepneys to the airport. These drop you at the entrance of the airport parking (₱10). You must then walk less than 5 minutes to the terminal building. Count 15–30 minutes in total. At maingate, some jeepney drivers will also offer to bring you to the terminal building for about ₱250, just insist that you want to go the cheap way.
Construction of an airport rail link with Manila began in 2021, which will terminate at a station outside the North Terminal. This is planned to open by 2024. This will be served by limited express trains to Manila, as well as regular commuter trains that will stop at Angeles proper before continuing down to Manila.

By bus[edit]
15.179120.58922 Dau Bus Terminal, MacArthur Highway, Dau, Mabalacat. Open 24 hours. Angeles' central bus terminal, it serve buses headed for the city and also those headed toward Northern Luzon. There is one shelter, which has some shops and food stands. Nearby is a CityMall shopping mall, fast-food chains, and a Hotel Sogo location. (updated Sep 2023)
This is the most common and economical way to get to Angeles from Metro Manila. It normally takes 1½ hours to get to Angeles by bus, however, travelers must consider the unpredictable effect heavy traffic and downpours will have on the trip. In short, give yourself plenty of time to travel by bus.
Most provincial buses bound for the Ilocos region will have a short stopover at Dau, before heading onward. However, from the opposite direction, you need to get down at Tarlac City and transfer to an uncomfortable ordinary class minibus headed for Angeles.

Bus companies[edit]
 Five Star. Has trips from their terminals in Pasay and Cubao. ₱135 one-way. (updated Dec 2019)
 Philippine Rabbit. Plies the Santa Cruz, Manila-Dau route. (updated Dec 2019)
By car[edit]
The best way from Manila to Angeles via car is taking the North Luzon Expressway (NLEx) which extends until Santa Ines in Mabalacat. You may take either the Angeles exit or Dau exit to get there. Another highway, though narrow, is the MacArthur Highway (Rte 2). Both routes pass through Bulacan, and it usually takes about 1 hour to travel but it is twice the travel time if you plan to take the MacArthur route as it take you through heavily urbanized areas. Rental car companies can be found all over Manila and Angeles. If you don't know the routes, you can hire drivers by asking the attendant of the rent-a-car shop.
From the north, the best route is on the Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway (SCTEx) or MacArthur. From Subic or Bataan, SCTEx is preferred, but there is also an old highway on the same corridor, Rte 217.

Get around[edit]
By jeepney[edit]
To hop on a colorful jeepney is certainly the most affordable way to get around downtown. It is available 24 hours a day and it is the most famous mode of transportation in the country, which connects towns and cities together.  Since jeepneys tend to be overcrowded with passengers, tourists carrying bulky luggage should consider traveling by taxi.

By taxi[edit]
Though more convenient for tourists, taxis are less common in Angeles and not normally used for travel outside the city.  Rather, they are primarily used to tour around the Clark Freeport Zone and for transport to and from the airport. Simson's taxicab terminal can be found particularly next to Clark's main gate (opposite Jollibee) and SM City Clark in Balibago.
Grab ride-hailing service is available in Angeles since 2016.

By trike[edit]
Trikes (or tricycles) are motorcycles with a small attached passenger cabin.  They are restricted to low-speed roads and not permitted to enter the area surrounding the airport.  Passengers of larger physical stature may find riding in them uncomfortable.  Nevertheless, because of their slower speeds, trikes are generally a safe mode of transport. Groups of two can take a trike if one is comfortable riding behind the driver in the style of a moto-taxi.
Fares are negotiable if you hail a trike on the street, but are notoriously high in Angeles if you do it this way, with foreigners asked flat ₱100 even for a short (up to 1-1,5 km) trip, more for longer ones (or even if you just have lots of baggage), and not much chance to bargain. This is both clearly illegal (the updated fare chart published in 2019 starts from ₱25) and easily twice the metered air-conditioned taxi fare in Manila. Hailing a Grab (see above in By taxi section) car from the phone is often cheaper, not to mention the GrabTrike service available in the same app.

By bus[edit]
Clark Freeport operates a bus rapid transit (BRT) system, the Clark Loop, with two lines from SM Clark. Buses leave every 20 minutes; some stops are on the median of the Manuel A. Roxas Hwy, otherwise, they operate like regular city buses. Rides are free.

Eat[edit]
Angeles is known for being the Culinary Center of the Philippines. This reputation reportedly goes back to the Spanish colonial times where it is said that the Kapampangan cook learned very quickly to improvise on Spanish dishes using local ingredients.
The culinary adventure in Angeles is sure to be an experience of a lifetime. A must-eat dish is sisig.m, which Angeles is famous for. From its humble beginnings in Aling Lucing's Eatery along Angeles' railway to its present top-of-the-menu ranking in Manila's bars and nightclubs, sisig has come to conquer the Filipino drinkers' palate. It has become the quintessential pulutan fare — the default order that comes with every round of beer.
Other not-to-be-missed local mouth-watering cuisines are Dencio's kare-kare (another Kapampangan menu, which is a Philippine stew made from peanut sauce with a variety of vegetables, stewed oxtail, beef and occasionally offal or tripe), fresh papaya lumpia, tilapia in tausi sauce, adobong pugo, morcon, tortang bangus (milkfish stuffed with ground pork), Everybody's Cafe's camaru (fried cricket adobo), kilayin baboy (pork meat and lungs pickled in a marinade of vinegar or calamansi juice, usually along with garlic, onions and hot/sweet peppers), bringhe (local Spanish paella), bulanglang (meat or fish broth soured with guava fruit), Aling Luring's batute (a frog stuffed with ground and seasoned pork, then deep fried to a crisp), burong isda (fermented rice with fish or small shrimps), pork and carabao tocino, Bale Dutung's burong talangka (the fat of salted little crabs, very rich and laden with cholesterol but hard to resist), Filipinized pizza in a bilao at Armando's Pizza, brazo de mercedes, halo-halo from Razon's and Corazon's (a popular dessert that is a mixture of shaved ice and milk, added with various boiled sweet beans and fruits, and served cold in a glass or bowl), Susie's Cuisine's famous pancit luglog (palabok), tibuk tibok (made from carabao's milk and also known as "maja blanca"), tocino del cielo (a richer version of leche flan) and turron de casoy.
If you like drinking beer and eating barbecue, then Frank & Jim, Ikabud, Whythaus Grill, Wishing Well, Marisol Steakhouses and the eateries along Angeles railroad crossing  are certainly the spots for you. Street foods, such as fishballs and kikiams on sticks, are a must-try at Nepo Compound vendor stands.
If local cuisine is not your type, no need to worry as the city has a wide range of pretty decent restaurants to choose from with American, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Mexican and Korean cuisines.
A number of coffee shops are also to be seen even in the outskirts of the city that serve drip regular coffee, decaff, brewed coffee, espresso-based hot drinks, other hot and cold drinks, and snacks.

The infamous nightlife scene on Fields Avenue sprang up to service American military men stationed at the nearby Clark Air Force Base. But now, the adjoining Balibago district is home to many decent bars and karaoke joints. It has a number of clubs which fit any budget and personality. There are traditional clubs with DJs and live band clubs. For an endless evening of dancing and pulsating music, head for the bright lights of Balibago.

Sleep[edit]
There are many nice hotels around the city, furnished with the luxury of modern day living with upgraded facilities to accommodate your needs. Some can be found along the Clark Perimeter Road while others within the Clark Freeport Zone. Lower-cost accommodation in the main entertainment area near Fields Ave., however, tends to be expensive by Asian standards, with prices starting around ₱800-1000, and the cheapest places are often fully booked. If you look for the budget options, while still in the bar area and walking distance from Fields Ave. proper, head along the Fields Ave. to the west, where it is no more traffic-free and continues along the Clark Freeport Zone fence as the Perimeter Road (Don Juico Ave.). Numerous cheap (₱400-700) rooms can be found here, and more upmarket hotels (ABC Hotel, for example, which is also a well-known landmark in the area). The Perimeter Road is quite busy even at night, and so is relatively safe to walk home late, compared to the other streets around. Another option is to accept tricycle driver's "cheap hotel" tout - but, as everywhere, this may mean overpricing due to the driver's commission, more concerns about hotel security, and a ₱50 or more for a trike ride every time you go in and out (or a long walk, which may be not safe in the night time also).

Internet cafes have become a common sight along university roads, at the malls, hotels and different establishments. You will have no trouble finding cheap and fast internet access. Usual rate ranges between ₱12 and ₱30 an hour. You will also find cheap gaming stations aside from internet access.
Prepaid SIM cards of local GSM operators (Globe, Smart, Sun) are widely available and cheap (₱50-100). International calls, however, are not particularly cheap (though still much cheaper than roaming rates) and usually cost around US$0.40 per minute ($0.30 for Sun, but at the expense of network coverage quality). However, often they have promotions with lower call/SMS rates to the chosen countries - just ask the dealer about that.

Stay safe[edit]
The tourist and entertainment areas are generally safe as it is filled with pedestrians and police around-the-clock.  If you're male, you will likely get heavily solicited by street vendors pitching cigarettes and trike rides.  However, they are usually nothing more than minor nuisances.  They aren't persistent as long as you show disinterest.  It’s the same with the begging population, which is small but visible.
However, venturing into the Clark Perimeter bar areas (around the ABC Hotel) after dark is not recommended or along Santos Street south of Wild Orchid Resort.  The rule of thumb is, if it's not well-lit and populated at night, don't go there.
Furthermore, be extremely vigilant of street strangers pretending to know you.  These scammers, often middle-aged male trike drivers, usually target solo tourists.  With an extended hand, they would say something like "Hi, my friend, I met you at the hotel last night" or "Hey, remember me?  I was your driver."   Their initial goal is simply to get you talking and drawing down your guard.  But their ultimate goal is to transport you to an illegal gambling den, brothel, or to set you up for theft or mugging.  They will try to entice you by offering a free ride or to show you a new or secret bar.  Ignoring random street strangers is essential advice.  It's best not to confront them but to walk past saying "sorry, I'm late!"   And definitely never go anywhere with them or show your wallet.  Filipinos are known for their hospitality, but they're not that friendly to the point where they'd appear out of nowhere just to befriend you!
Lastly, do not engage with street prostitutes, some of whom are underaged or have criminal intent.  There are countless stories of male patrons bringing a street prostitute to his hotel room only to be startled minutes later by police knocking on the door.  The girl may claim rape and the police may demand a bribe to "settle" matters.
