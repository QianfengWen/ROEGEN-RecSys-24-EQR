Litchfield is a city of about 6,600 people (2018) in Southern Minnesota. Litchfield is among the largest of a series of "whistle stop" towns built along a railroad extending west from Minneapolis in the 19th century. U.S. Route 12 follows the rail route, which is still active.


Understand[edit]
Litchfield is the county seat of Meeker County, Minnesota.  It is one of the few small towns in Minnesota to never have stopped growing throughout its existence along with Mora and Pine City.
