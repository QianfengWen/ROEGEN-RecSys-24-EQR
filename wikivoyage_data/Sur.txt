Tim Severin, The Sindbad Voyage. In 1980 Severin and a crew of Omanis – including several from Sur – sailed in a traditional dhow from Muscat to Guangzhou, China, in an effort to recreate the legendary voyages of Sindbad. The dhow was built in Sur by Omani and Indian shipwrights using completely traditional materials and techniques, described at length by the author.

22.56178759.5368691 Dhow shipyard (near the suspension bridge to Al Ayjah). Sur is where authentic dhows are still built in the traditional fashion. NOTE: the locals don't call them "dhows" but rather safeena (ship) or suh-fin (ships). If you say "dhow," they'll be perplexed. 
22.56117859.5311992 Fatih Al-Khair (Dhow Museum). If you are an enthusiast of hand-made wooden boats and ships, this is definitely worth a visit. Several old dhows are on display, the largest of which is the Fatih Al-Khair, built in Sur 150 years ago and now beautifully restored.

If the "natour" (guardian) isn't there, just walk up to the fort itself and he'll see you, come sell you a ticket and then sit in the entrance hall while you look around the displays. It is possible to climb all four towers which offer great views of the town. Don't expect much in the way of history or signs. 500 Bzs. 
22.5539359.4887664 Bilad Sur Fort (Bilad Sur Castle) (off of Hwy 23 near Roundabout 1). Built 200 years ago, the fortress is closed for renovation.

Do[edit]
Buy[edit]
22.56970859.5239141 Souq. Visitors may find the souq disappointing, as it is filled with everyday Chinese-made goods and Indian-made khangars (daggers). 
 Dhow models (in a shed at the shipyard). Erratic opening hours. Dhow models of various sizes, made by the shipwrights, are for sale. 
Eat[edit]
Sur has several decent restaurants but no five-star menus. 

 Bawadi Al Ayga (in the souq, near Nadi Sur Sports Club). Indian restaurant. A lot of the locals know it but everyone knows where Nadi Sur is so just take a taxi there. Prices are low. about RO 1-1.5 for a vegetarian dish with rice while anything with meat, depending on the type, runs from RO 1.3-1.8. They also have "Chinese" food. Friendly staff, largely English speaking from Kerala, very non-intrusive. Male and family sections available. 
22.57601959.521431 Zaki Restaurant, Hwy 23 (near the desalination plant), ☏ +968 9946 2367. Indian restaurant, with food about the same quality as Bawadi but slightly more expensive. They also have "Chinese" food. The ambiance is extremely noisy. Staff are friendly, and a couple of them speak English. Many Omanis come here with their families, there is a family section in the back of the restaurant. 
22.59517759.4939432 Sur Beach Hotel Restaurant, Al Murtefeh (near the beach). Food is okay, not great and a touch more expensive than Spicy Village.
