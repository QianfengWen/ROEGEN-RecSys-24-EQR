Understand[edit]
History[edit]
This toponym is of Algonquin origin, meaning "misshapen pike". The pike, designated Maskinongé, is widespread in the Maskinongé River and Lake Saint-Pierre.

Geography[edit]
Located along the northwest shore of Lake Saint-Pierre, the village of Maskinongé is crossed by the course of the Maskinongé river, the Bois Blanc river and La Petite Rivière.
The northwest shore of lac Saint-Pierre includes Île aux Grues (bounded by the Maskinongé River, La Petite Rivière and the North Channel), the Cove of the Petite Rivière and the Bay of Maskinongé which is a vast shallow area where aquatic plants grow abundantly. This shoal zone, which extends over the entire north shore of Lake Saint-Pierre, that is to say as far as Pointe-du-lac, is suitable for migratory birds and aquatic fauna. The Petite Baie des Deux Montagnes separates the Île aux Grues (in Maskinongé) and the Iles de la Girodeau (in Saint-Ignace-de-Loyola).

Economy[edit]
The village is also crossed by the Quebec-Gatineau rail section of the Canadian Pacific. Maskinongé station was a vector of economic development thanks to the transport of passengers and goods.
Municipality bordering Lake Saint-Pierre, Maskinongé has a great agricultural economic vocation, certain public services (e.g., schools, municipality, residences for seniors) and recreational tourism activities (vacationing, swimming, hunting, fishing, boating, marinas). Throughout its history, recreational, commercial and fishing boating has been an economic vector. Boating is possible on the Maskinongé River. The area bordering the Maskinongé River is densified by vacationing and permanent residences, especially between the village of Maskinongé and the confluence with the St. Lawrence River. And each side of the river has an access road to serve residents and vacationers. The hamlet "Langue-de-Terre" is located at the confluence of the Maskinongé river and the Saint-Laurent river.
