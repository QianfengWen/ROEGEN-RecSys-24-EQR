Bo'ness is an industrial town in  West Lothian in central Scotland, with a population of 14,840 in 2020. The main reason to visit is to ride the Bo'ness and Kinneil steam railway.


Understand[edit]
The town's full name is Borrowstounness, meaning "the headland near Beornweard's farmstead", but it's never called that. From medieval times coal-mining was its main industry, along with pottery, metal-working and ship-breaking; but the harbour became blighted as much by silting as by the decline of those industries. It's nowadays effectively a suburb of the oil and gas town of Grangemouth, and a commuter town for Edinburgh and Glasgow.

Bo'ness is 15 miles (25 km) west of Edinburgh, from M9 exit at junction 3 onto A904 / A993.
Bus C19 runs from Edinburgh past the airport every 3 hours, taking an hour to Bo'ness. Bus 909 follows a similar route every couple of hours and continues via Grangemouth to Stirling.
It's often more convenient to travel to Falkirk then take Bus 2, which runs every 30 min via Grangemouth and takes 40 min. Otherwise travel to Linlithgow and take Bus 45 / 46, which orbits the area hourly.
The nearest railway stations are Falkirk and Linlithgow, on the line between Edinburgh and Glasgow Queen Street. The branch line to Bo'ness is only used for heritage train excursions.
