Iskandar Puteri, formerly known as Nusajaya, is a city in the state of Johor, Malaysia.  The southernmost city in Malaysia, the city was created essentially from scratch since the 1990s to capitalize on the nearby Second Link to Singapore and the North-South Expressway to Kuala Lumpur.  Largely residential and administrative, the main tourist draw is Legoland Malaysia, the only Lego theme park in Southeast Asia.


Areas[edit]
Iskandar Puteri
Iskandar Puteri can be roughly divided in to three areas, which are:

North - This part of the city has mostly been fully developed into residential areas, such as Taman Universiti, Skudai, Bukit Indah, and Taman Sutera. The older part of the city can be found here.
Central - The most developed commercial area of the city, containing the government's administrative center at Kota Iskandar, the flashy seaside enclave of Puteri Harbour, the Legoland theme park at Medini and more. Gelang Patah is the old part of this city area.
South - With the exception of Forest City and Port of Tanjung Pelepas, most of the part of this city area are yet to be developed. Along Pulai River bank, many parts are still covered in green and forest.
Understand[edit]
Iskandar Puteri City Council
Iskandar Puteri is the administrative center for the state of Johor, which houses the office of the Chief Minister and the legislative council. It is a planned city envisioned by the 24th Sultan of Johor, Sultan Iskandar, and continued by his son, current Sultan Ibrahim Ismail. The city is administered under the Iskandar Puteri City Council. The central and southern part of the city is undergoing huge development where construction is happening around the places, with many administrative buildings, condominiums, shopping malls and leisure areas still being built. The developments planned for the city are rather impressive. Administratively, Iskandar Puteri is part of Johor Bahru District, the others are Johor Bahru City and Pasir Gudang Town, which are on the eastern side of Iskandar Puteri.

History[edit]
The Port of Tanjung Pelepas was completed in 2000 as one of the pet projects of then prime minister Mahathir Mohamad. Positioning itself as a much cheaper alternative to the long-dominant port of Singapore, it was hugely successful in its early years, attracting the world's two largest shipping lines, Maersk and Evergreen, to move their operations from Singapore. Today, it remains the second busiest port in Malaysia (after Port Klang), and serves as a complement to the port in Pasir Gudang in serving the Johor Bahru metropolitan area. Plans have been mooted to demolish the Causeway to allow ships to sail directly from Tanjung Pelepas to Pasir Gudang, though little to no progress has been made in bringing the plan to fruition.
Iskandar Puteri was established as a town with the name Nusajaya. In January 2016, it was renamed "Iskandar Puteri" by Sultan of Johor. In November 2017, it was upgraded to a city. The city's development remains patchy: while parts are busy and lively, the skyscraper-heavy areas of Puteri Harbour and particularly Forest City have largely failed to attract wealthy foreign investors, resulting in half-built developments rotting in the jungle.

Talk[edit]
Malay language is the official language of Johor. However, English is widely used as the second language by basically everyone in day-to-day trading and business activities, except in the very rural village areas. Most of the public places areas are written bilingually in Malay and English, with other places with additional Chinese or Tamil languages. The influx of expatriates and foreign workers from South and Southeast Asia has added to the mix of the languages used in the city, and also increased the importance of English language as the lingua franca.

Climate[edit]
Iskandar Puteri has an equatorial climate that's humid and hot all year round. The northeast monsoon from November to January can bring prolonged heavy rains and slightly cooler temperatures.

By plane[edit]
The city does not have its own airport. The nearest airport is the Senai International Airport (JHB IATA) serving Johor Bahru with destinations to cities in Malaysia and countries within Southeast and East Asia. It has many connecting flights to Malaysia's main airport Kuala Lumpur International Airport  which serves long haul international flights globally. To reach Iskandar Puteri, take public bus (A1, 207, 333) from the airport to Larkin Sentral Terminal in Johor Bahru and change bus towards Gelang Patah (666, LM1) or towards Puteri Harbour International Ferry Terminal (IP) in Iskandar Puteri.
Due to the limited long-haul connections of Senai airport, many locals choose to fly from Singapore Changi Airport (SIN IATA)  across the border in Singapore instead. The downside is that you will have to pass through customs and immigration twice, and there are no direct public transportation connections between Changi Airport and Iskandar Puteri. This means that unless you want to spend a very long time on public transport and make multiple transfers, you will have to arrange for your own transportation in advance.

By train[edit]
The city doesn't have any train station. However, the nearest train stations are Kempas Baru and JB Sentral stations in the neighboring Johor Bahru.

By car[edit]
From other cities or towns in Johor[edit]
If coming from Johor Bahru city, take Pasir Gudang Highway westward and follow to Second Link Expressway westward for paid road. For non-paid road, take Sultan Iskandar Highway westward, Skudai-Gelang Patah Road southwestward or Sutera Danga Road southwestward. If coming from Pontian District, take Tanjung Kupang Road southeastward.

From other states in Peninsular Malaysia[edit]
If coming from other states on the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia, take the North–South Expressway Southern Route southward and change to Second Link Expressway southward. If you're coming from the East Coast, you'll have to drive down to Johor Bahru and continue from there. Iskandar Puteri is not connected by land to East Malaysia, thus if you are coming from the area, please take flight first to Kuala Lumpur International Airport or Senai International Airport and continue the journey by land.

From Singapore[edit]
The Second Link (Linkedua) connects Tuas in Singapore with the Kompleks Sultan Abu Bakar in Tanjung Kupang. Tolls are charged on both the Malaysian and Singaporean side for crossing the border. No visa-on-arrival is available at the border crossing, so if required for your nationality, make sure your Malaysian visa is in order before doing so.

By bus[edit]
From Johor Bahru[edit]
Iskandar Puteri Free Shuttle Service IP1 from Larkin bus terminal in Johor Bahru. Passes through points of interest in Iskandar Puteri.
LW1 between Larkin bus terminal and Gelang Patah. Passes through Legoland Malaysia and Puteri Harbour

From Singapore[edit]
Going to Iskandar Puteri from Singapore uses the 1.354664103.6279851 Malaysia–Singapore Second Link. Going from Singapore to Iskandar Puteri by public transportation, without resorting to taxi or e-hailing on at least part of the trip, may take a few hours considering the traffic in the 2nd Link and the time to commute inside Singapore to Jurong East or Boon Lay.
Buses CW3 and CW4 from Jurong East Bus Interchange, as well as bus CW6 from Boon Lay MRT, pass through the CIQ 2nd Link (immigration facilities) in Malaysia. From the CIQ 2nd Link, you can take the CW7L bus to Legoland Malaysia, or alternatively, the JPO2 bus that goes to Legoland and Puteri Harbour. From Puteri Harbour you can walk or take a taxi to Kota Iskandar. The JPO2 bus is very infrequent (it only runs 4 times per day in each direction), so you should familiarise yourself with the schedule if planning to go anywhere in Iskandar Puteri outside of Legoland Malaysia) or use taxi or e-hailing as an alternative to move between Iskandar Puteri and the CIQ 2nd Link.
However, if you are staying in the northern part of Singapore, it is probably more convenient to go to Iskandar Puteri via Johor Bahru.

Most of the areas of Iskandar Puteri are flat plains with no major steep hills, making it relatively easy to cycle.

Theme parks[edit]
The Legoland Malaysia complex, consisting of three separate parks, is by far the top attraction in the region. (Especially since Sanrio Hello Kitty Town closed in 2020.)  Most hotels in the area operate shuttles to the park, and from Johor Bahru it is also possible to use the LM1 and SL1 public buses.  One day-tickets start from RM189/149 adult/child for the Theme Park, although discounted tickets are often available from third-party booking sites and combo tickets covering multiple parks can be good value.

It can get very hot on a sunny day, so arrive early, aim to complete the outdoor parts like Miniland early in the day, and nip into the main air-conditioned areas like the movie theatre or the many Lego building zones to cool off.
