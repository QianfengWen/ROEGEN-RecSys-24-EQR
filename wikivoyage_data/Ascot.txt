Ascot - new stand
51.4161-0.6769441 Ascot Racecourse, High St, Ascot SL5 7JX, ☏ +44 344 346 3000, enquiries@ascot.com. This hosts some two dozen race meetings a year. The majority are flat races in summer, the big event being Royal Ascot in mid-June, which is usually attended by the monarch. This is royalty's local track, just down the road from Windsor Castle, so they like to be here. There are also jumps races at least monthly through the winter. The fancy grandstand, opened in 2006, goes big on restaurants, bars and hospitality suites, but doesn't do any favours to those who actually want to watch the races. The track is on the triangle of land north of Ascot High St and London Rd. If you plan to attend Royal Ascot, this is one of the few remaining events around the world that require attendees to be in traditional morning dress.   (updated Dec 2022)
