Stansbury is on the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia.
Located on the Yorke Peninsula, Stansbury is on the eastern side and is a two-and-a-half hour drive from Adelaide which makes it an ideal base to explore the region. Stansbury is centrally located for access to Dhilba Guuranda–Innes National Park, 110 km to the south and the Copper Coast 110 km to the north.


Understand[edit]
The first settler in the district was Alfred Weaver, who brought 7,000 sheep with him. Weaver built a shearing shed in 1846 where Stansbury now stands. Due to the abundance of oysters found in the bay, Stansbury was originally known as Oyster Bay and had a reputation for the best oysters in South Australia. For a number of years, there were between 15 and 20 oyster dredges working the bay, until eventually it was fished out.
The name Stansbury came into being when Governor Sir Anthony Musgrave renamed it in 1873, after his friend Mr Stansbury.
Stansbury is also the location of Adelaide Brighton Cement's Klein Point quarry, shipping limestone to Adelaide regularly on the Accolade 2..

Connect[edit]
Cellular (mobile) telephone network reception may not be available in many areas especially those distant from cellular network repeater towers normally located along the major highways and near larger townships. Hilly terrain will also effect reception. In an emergency seek higher ground. Some networks provide a poor coverage in regional and rural areas. It is generally considered that the best reception is available from either Telstra or Optus when in areas such as Yorke Peninsula.
For emergency services including police, fire services and ambulance call 000 from any telephone and ask the operator to connect you. Such calls are placed without charge to the calling party.
