Dartmouth is a town in the English Riviera and South Devon region of Devon. A historic port location, Dartmouth's geography and seaside location combined with its traditional architecture make it an idyllic settlement popular with tourists from around Britain and the near continent.


Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Dartmouth is on the A379 coastroad from Kingbridge to Torbay; if coming from the East it is easier to drive to Torbay and then follow the signposts, from the West, drive to Plymouth (or the Devon Expressway) and follow the signposts to Dartmouth.

Bus or rail[edit]
There are direct national coach (National Express) and rail links to Totnes and Paignton from London, Birmingham and even as far as Scotland. Taxis are usually available from  both stations, otherwise local bus stops are just a few minutes walk away. During the main holiday periods, at certain times, it is possible to get off a modern train at Paignton and cross to the Steam Railway. You can then travel the last few miles through breathtaking scenery to Kingswear before crossing the Dart on one of the ferries.

Boat[edit]
Dartmouth has strong connection with the sea and arriving by boat is a perfectly feasible and enjoyable way to enter into the town and the surrounding area,  Dartmouth Directory has more information about services people travelling by boat

See[edit]
 Foss Street. A delightful pedestrianised street dating from the 1200s. It was built as a dam to hold the Mill Pool. As the water ran out it drove two mill wheels. If you stand about halfway along Foss Street and look towards St Saviour's Church, it is still almost possible to imagine how things might have looked. 
 Browns Hill. This used to be the main road into Dartmouth. Today it is typical of the many small streets ablaze with colour during the summer months and well worth exploring. 
50.342-3.566331 Dartmouth Castle, Castle Road, TQ6 0JN, ☏ +44 1803 833588. Strictly speaking, two castles. The Medieval fortress dates back 600 years while the more recent building was still in use during the Second World War. It is under the care of English Heritage. adults £5.00, children £3.00, concessions £4.50.   
50.3519-3.57862 Dartmouth Museum, The Butterwalk, Duke St, Dartmouth TQ6 9PZ. Apr-Oct: Tu-Sa 10AM-4PM, Su M 1-4PM; Nov-Mar: daily 1-3PM. Occupying the first floor of an old merchant's house.

50.351128-3.5789573 St Saviour's Church, Anzac St, TQ6 9DL, ☏ +44 1803 414767. Consecrated in 1372 on the site of an earlier chapel and rebuilt during the 1630s. The church contains a fine wooden screen and an exceptional 14th-century door. It contains the famous Hawley Brass. 
50.342237-3.5660914 St Petrox Church, TQ6 0JN (next to Dartmouth Castle). Has some of the most stunning views in the country! Probably a monk's cell when first recorded in 1192 (it has been rebuilt - in the 17th century.) This church has an interesting collection of brasses and family memorials. Well worth a visit - perhaps by river taxi. 
50.35224-3.578465 The Newcomen Engine (Coventry Canal Engine). One of the town's star attractions. It is well worth visiting Thomas Newcomen's famous engine if only to feel very small standing beside this huge machine!   
50.3481-3.577226 Bayards Cove, Bayards Cove, TQ6 9AX. The Pilgrim Fathers set sail from here in 1620 in the Mayflower and Speedwell (but hit problems and had to go to Plymouth until they could continue their journey). Bayards Cove Fort was the last line of defence against foreign intruders. During the 1970s this area found fame as a setting for TV's The Onedin Line.
