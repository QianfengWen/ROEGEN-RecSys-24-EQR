Hamilton is a town on Clydeside in central Scotland. With a population of 54,480 in 2020, it's the fourth-largest town in Scotland and lies 12 miles southeast of Glasgow, at the confluence of the River Clyde with the Avon Water. 


Understand[edit]
This town was called Cadzow (pronounced "Cadju") until the 15th century when it became the seat of the Dukes of Hamilton, who over the following centuries often enlivened the place and sometimes improved it. Their embellishments, especially the palace facade and mausoleum, are today the reason to visit. Coal-mining was the main local industry: Hamilton was the county town of Lanarkshire and is now the base for South Lanarkshire Council, employing 16,000. It's separated by the Clyde and the M74 from nearby Motherwell, a former steel town.
This placename Hamilton is not directly related to the other Hamiltons in Ontario, Bermuda or New Zealand. Still less are the Dukes of Hamilton, now embodied by the 16th Duke Alexander Douglas Douglas-Hamilton (born 1978), to be confused with the unsuccessful Ontario hockey team of that name who became "Guelph Storm".

Hamilton Mausoleum
55.7766-4.0371 Hamilton Old Parish Church, Leechlee Road, Hamilton ML3 6AQ, ☏ +44 1698 281905, office@hamiltonold.co.uk. M-F 8AM-18:00, Su only for 10:45AM service. This is a Church of Scotland parish church with an Italianate design, the architect being William Adam. It was built in 1734 when the 5th Duke of Hamilton demolished its predecessor to expand his park. The central cupola was added in 1841: this meant changing the seating plan, whereupon the 11th Duke fell out with the Burgh Magistrates over who got to sit where. The feud went all the way to the House of Lords, the UK's supreme court; the Magistrates won.   (updated Nov 2019)
55.7793-4.03462 Low Parks Museum (Cameronians Scottish Rifles Collection), 129 Muir Street, Hamilton ML3 6BJ, ☏ +44 1698 328232, lowparksmuseum@southlanarkshire.gov.uk. M-Sa 10AM-5PM, Su noon-5PM. This traces the local history of South Lanarkshire, with displays relating to Hamilton Palace; early settlement; working life, including agriculture, weaving, and coalmining; and also the history of the local regiment, the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles). Free.   (updated Jan 2023)
55.7823-4.02973 Hamilton Mausoleum, 129 Muir Street, Hamilton ML3 6BJ, ☏ +44 1698 452382, lowparksmuseum@southlanarkshireleisure.co.uk. 24 hours. If colossal tombs can buy glory on earth and in the afterlife, then Alexander 10th Duke of Hamilton (1767-1852) is even now hobnobbing with the pharoahs, and especially with Ozymandias. He built a humongous new palace, plus this massive family vault where he and his ancestors came to lie. It was only completed in 1858, five years after his death. In 1921 the area suffered flooding and subsidence from the River Clyde so the coffins were transferred to Bent Cemetery, leaving empty niches, while the palace collapsed. The chapel has a 36 metre-high dome with an oculus, like the Pantheon in Rome; there are magnificent bronze doors and a floor made of different marbles from around the world. Two huge lions guard the entrance to the burial crypt. Until 2014 this building held the world record for the longest reverberating echo, at 15 secs (ie how long it persists, not how long it takes to come back to you). But that's now surpassed by the 112 secs of some disused oil tanks in Invergordon: sic transit gloria mundi. Free.   (updated Nov 2019)
55.773-4.0534 Bent Cemetery is along Bent Road half a mile west of Hamilton Central station. As well as the Dukes, here lies the entertainer Sir Harry Lauder (1870-1950), who for ten years worked down the local coal mine - he was once pinned under a roof-fall, while his work mates were horribly crushed.




An unexpected visitor
Towards midnight on 10 May 1941 a German officer parachuted into the fields some miles west of Hamilton and said he had an important message for the Duke. Douglas the 14th Duke was serving with the RAF in Edinburgh: when he came to interview the man, it turned out to be Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess. They'd never met but Hess admired the Duke as an aviator, and thought he might help negotiate a peace-deal. The astonished Duke responded in the same terms as an equally astonished Churchill (dripping in his bathrobe as he was told the news): that there could be no peace with Hitler, and that Britain would fight him to the end. It was clearly a dingbat solo mission with no mandate to negotiate, but Hess confirmed the Allies' belief that Hitler was about to do the very thing that he'd consistently declared Germany must never do: attack Russia and become embroiled on a war on two fronts. And that changed the tide of the war, even before the USA joined in.
The 1946 Military Tribunal sentenced Hess to life imprisonment for his part in Nazism to 1941, and it proved to be a long life. He was held in Spandau prison, from 1966 the last remaining prisoner there, until in 1987 aged 93 he hung himself. The prison was quickly demolished to prevent it becoming a shrine, and a supermarket was built there, popular with British military families who called it "Hesco".


55.7573-4.00785 Chatelherault Country Park, Ferniegair ML3 7UE (footpath from Ferniegair, or turn off A72 half a mile south, or train to Chatelherault), ☏ +44 1698 426213, chatelheraultcountrypark@southlanarkshireleisure.co.uk. 24 hours. Extensive park ranged around the 1734 "hunting lodge" by William Adam, basically a huge folly to prettify the landscape. There are great views across to the Campsie Hills and Ben Lomond, improved from 2017 as some of the woodland has been felled. The park has almost a square mile of open country and woods, ten miles of routed pathways and a playground, visitor centre and cafe. A grand arched bridge crosses the Avon Water gorge to 16th century Cadzow Castle, an unsafe ruin, so just admire it from the bridge. The name Chatelherault was from a duchy awarded to a 16th-century Hamilton who got Mary Queen of Scots married off (age 16) to the heir to the French throne (age 14). Within months the boy became King Francis II but died, another of history's "what if?" moments. As to the palace, the 19th-century 10th Duke's fortune couldn't match his building ambitions, so to raise money he leased more and more of the land to coal-mining. Harry Lauder and his successors burrowed away like socialist sappers till the palace was undermined and fell down. Free.   (updated Nov 2019)
 David Livingstone Centre, 165 Station Rd, Blantyre G72 9BY (4 miles north of Hamilton, take train to Blantyre). Closed for rebuilding, gardens remain open. Blantyre was the birthplace of the explorer and missionary David Livingstone (1813-1873). In youth he grubbed a living in the cotton mills to support his family, but was able to study & qualify in medicine. He intended to go to China as a missionary, but the Opium Wars made travel there unfeasible, and he turned to Africa hoping to combat the slave trade. Legitimate trade would help overturn it, to which end he sought the source of the Nile. This museum tells his story but is closed for rebuilding, re-opening date not yet announced. In Hamilton there are plaques to his memory in St James' Church and at 117 Burnbank Road, where he lived in 1862; that house still stands. (updated Nov 2019)
