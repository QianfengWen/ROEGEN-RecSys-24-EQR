Akyaka is a beach resort in the Southern Aegean region of Turkey, at the head of the Gulf of Gökova.
Gökova is a larger, older village 2 km inland, on the site of the ancient city of Idyma. 
Tourist agencies and travellers often use the two town names interchangeably. In 2022 Akyaka, Gökova and surrounding area of Ula had a population of 26,613.


Get in[edit]

Highway D550 runs between the towns just before it forks (as D400) either south to Marmaris or southeast to Dalaman. So buses from Istanbul and Izmir pass through every couple of hours round the clock, and the pick-up / drop-off point is the filling station just north of the fork. The Dalaman airport bus also stops here; it's shown as "Gökova" on timetables. 
Muğla 30 km north on D550 is the provincial capital, with local buses and dolmuşes to all parts including Akyaka and Gökova.
From Bodrum and Ören, a scenic minor road twists and turns along the north shore of the Gulf of Gökova.

Get around[edit]
From the bus stop on D550 to accommodation near the seafront is about 2 km, so look for a taxi or dolmuş.
