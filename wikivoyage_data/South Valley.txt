South Valley is an area of the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles. It is made up of the neighborhoods of the southwestern portion of the valley: Canoga Park, Encino, Reseda, Tarzana, West Hills, Winnetka and Woodland Hills.


Understand[edit]
Reseda grew into a prominent town after World War II when many of the existing ranches and orange groves were converted to housing for the returning soldiers.  Today the population hovers around 80,000. The town has been featured in several movies and songs, most notably 1984's Karate Kid as the home of the title character.  Tom Petty's hit Free Fallin also features the town in the lyric "It's a long day livin' in Reseda.  There's a freeway runnin' through the yard".

Mulholland Park Gate, Tarzana
Tarzana was named after the Tarzana Ranch, which was owned in the early 1900s by Edgar Rice Burroughs, author of the Tarzan stories.  The land was later subdivided and sold, and in the late 1920s the residents named the town Tarzana.
Woodland Hills is an average middle class Los Angeles neighborhood, remarkable for the numerous Persian restaurants along Ventura Blvd in the south as well as the medium-density new city development known as Warner Center. Topanga Canyon Blvd provides the most scenic road from Los Angeles to the beach, with a small hippie community called Topanga along the way. However, Woodland Hills is not generally acknowledged as a tourist destination.
