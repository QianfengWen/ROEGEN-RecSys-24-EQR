St Arnaud is a settlement in the Nelson Bays region in the north of the South Island of New Zealand.  It is the gateway to the Nelson Lakes National Park.  The locality is also known as Lake Rotoiti, which better describes this lakeside community.  However, the town's official name remains St Arnaud as Lake Rotoiti (meaning "small lake" in Maori) is the name of a locality in the North Island.


Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
State Highway 63 leads from Marlborough on the east coast to the West Coast.  Traveling east, Picton (1 3/4 hours), Blenheim (1 hour 20 minutes), Renwick (70 minutes) and Wairau Valley township (35 minutes).  Traveling west Kawatiri Junction (15 minutes), Murchison (40 minutes) and Westport (2 hours 10 minutes).  There are two main ways to get to St Arnaud from Nelson.  The quickest is traveling through Richmond and Wakefield on State Highway 6.  The turnoff is 10 minutes past Wakefield and St Arnaud is signposted through to the village.  The road intersects with State Highway 63 two minutes east of the village.  Otherwise, State Highway 6 continues to Kawatiri Junction which is the end of State Highway 63.

By bus[edit]
Nelson Lakes Shuttles run both scheduled and unscheduled services to St Arnaud from Picton, Blenheim, Nelson and other destinations. Specialising in transport for hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts, they can pick you up from the end of walking tracks as well as offering a conventional bus service. During the ski season, daily shuttles run from Blenheim, Nelson and Motueka to the Rainbow Ski Field, the turn-off for which is 5 minutes drive from St Arnaud township.
