Not to be confused with Fethard-on-Sea in County Wexford.

Fethard (Fiodh Ard, meaning "high wood") is a small town in County Tipperary, with a population in 2022 of 1700. It was settled by the Normans from 1201, and ringed by defensive walls from the 13th century. The town's medieval buildings are the main reason to visit. 


Get in[edit]
Fethard Town Wall and Holy Trinity Church
Kavanagh's Bus 393 / 396 runs thrice M-Sa from Clonmel to Fethard, 20 min. It continues north for another 75 min through the back lanes to Thurles, which is on the Dublin-Cork main railway line. 
And that's all; there's no bus from nearby Cashel or Cahir. You need your own wheels.

Drink[edit]
Fethard's 17th century Town Hall
 McCarthy's Pub, Restaurant and Undertaker (not necessarily in that order), 17 Main St, Fethard, ☏ +353 52 613 1149. Su-Th noon-11PM,  Sa noon-12:30AM. This legendary all-purpose institution was founded in the 1850s. It's handy for wakes but you don't have to be deceased to enjoy eating and drinking here. But they've focused a bit and no longer operate as a hotel, draper, grocer, spirit merchant, glass & porcelain shop and hackney horse hire. Pubs-cum-undertakers became common in Ireland at the Famine, when the law required bodies to be brought to the nearest pub until an inquest could be held: the pub had cold storage, and premises for a wake. That law was only repealed in 1962, and acting as a mortician was also a fast-track to gaining a publican's licence. The combination declined as separate funeral directors developed. It's reckoned some 80 pubs across Ireland still act as undertakers, but none are as cheek-by-jowl as McCarthy's (updated Feb 2021)
Bridge Bar, Butler's, Village Inn and Lonergans are the other pubs along Main St. Castle Inn on Watergate has closed down.
