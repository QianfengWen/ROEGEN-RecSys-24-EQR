Dolisie is a city in the Niari Valley of the Republic of the Congo It was named after Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza's lieutenant Albert Dolisie. In 1975, its name was changed to Loubomo, however in 1991, the old name was restored. Dolisie was nicknamed "green gold".


Understand[edit]
City view
Dolisie is vibrant, though there are only paved roads in the center of the city. The economy revolves mostly around the logging industry, which is mainly run by Chinese and Malaysian companies. The drop in electric output and frequent power cuts have become a fact of life for residents of Dolisie. There are few travellers in the city. Most of the foreigners are in private vehicles, therefore walking on the street or taking public transport will draw a lot of attention from curious locals.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Dolisie's Ngot Nzoungou airport can be reached from Brazzaville's Maya Maya airport twice a day or from Pointe-Noire by Air Congo or Trans Air Congo[dead link] (TAC), +242 811046.

By train[edit]
The Congo-Ocean Railway (COR; French: Chemin de fer Congo-Océan, CFCO), built in the 1920s, is the government-owned rail authority of the Republic of Congo.  It links the Atlantic port of Pointe-Noire with Brazzaville, a distance of 502 kilometres.

By car[edit]
From Pointe-Noire, the city can be reached via a dirt road (National Road 1) 140 km in length. The journey will take at least 6 hours long and four wheel drive is necessary. Many roadblocks will be encountered along the way, with police asking for "jus" (a juice), which is basically a bribe. You may want to say that you will buy them one on the way back.

Get around[edit]
Map of Dolisie
You may use local taxis. Unlike the green taxis in Brazzaville, or blue taxis in Pointe-Noire, they can identified by their red color.  One trip anywhere in town is 700 FCFA (~US$1.50). However, Dolisie is a relatively small city and most destinations can be reached by foot (take caution at night).
