Storlien[dead link] is a Swedish ski resort in western Jämtland, just 2 km (1.2 mi) east of the border with Norway.


Understand[edit]
Inauguration of the railway in 1882, Storlien
Storlien railway station, in the centre of the village and the highest station in Sweden
Storlien is a saddle point in the Scandinavian mountains, and the highest point on Saint Olaf's Way, a pilgrim route in use since the 12th century.
In Swedish history, it is infamous for a failed military campaign in the Great Northern War. After the death of king Charles XII, Lieutenant Carl Gustaf Armfeldt led thousands of men back from Norway in the winter of 1718–1719, into a blizzard where most of them froze to death.
As the railway was built in the 1880s, Storlien emerged as a prestigious resort. The Royal Family has a house here. During the late 20th century, it has been in the shade of the more developed resort in Åre. As living costs in Norway have become the world's highest, Storlien has a retail trade out of all proportion to its small size.

Get in[edit]
Storlien is at the Swedish-Norwegian border. Both countries are part of the Schengen area, normally without any passport checks. But Norway is not a member of the EU Customs Union, so you need to declare certain goods and you can be stopped for a customs inspection. 

By train[edit]
The Storlien railway station is higher above sea level than any other in Sweden.
SJ (formerly part of Statens Järnvägar) has night trains from Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö.
Norrtåg has day trains from Sundsvall and Östersund, Sweden.
NSB has day trains from Trondheim in Norway.

By plane[edit]
Vaernes airport (TRD IATA): outside Trondheim is the closest airport, just 73km from Storlien. There are international flights from London and Amsterdam.
At the airport you take the local train to Hell and get off just 3 minutes later (or walk). In Hell, you take the NSB train direct to Storlien railway station; it's worth checking the time of departures from Hell as the train only runs twice a day (in both directions). Generally there is a morning train at around 08:00 and an evening train at around 17:00. Avoid arriving at Hell station too far in advance as it is far less comfortable than waiting a few hours in a café at Vaernes airport. There is also a shopping centre between the airport and Hell.
Åre Östersund airport (OSD IATA): There are domestic flights operating daily from Stockholm to Åre Östersund Airport There are also charter flights from London, Moscow, Helsinki and Copenhagen in winter time.

By helicopter[edit]
You can charter a helicopter to pick you up at Vaernes Airport in Trondheim, Norway or at Åre-Östersund Airport on Frösön. The largest operator in Östersund is Jämtlands Flyg which has helicopters for 3-6 passengers.

By car[edit]
You will easily reach Storlien by taking the E14 that passes right through the village.
