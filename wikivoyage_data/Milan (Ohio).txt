Thomas A. Edison birthplace.
Milan is a city in Ohio Erie shore west. It is located in the south part of Erie County and the area known as  The Firelands. Today it is best known as the birthplace of inventor Thomas Edison, who lived there until age seven. The Milan Canal, built in the mid-1800s led to Milan being the 2nd largest grain export port in the world during the 1800s, shipping grain from Ohio farms to the Huron River, into Sandusky Bay, Lake Erie, on to the Erie Canal, to its destination in New York City. Milan was also a ship building community, building over 60 schooners that graced the Lake's and made it a center of commerce in northern Ohio. When the railroads laid track in Ohio, that was the demise of the Milan Canal. Milan survives today as a beautiful village in Northwest Ohio.

Being a small village, walking is very easy and most likely the easiest way to see the town, parks and museums. There is no public transportation. Since the Milan Canal dried up in the 1800s, no boat traffic is present. Much of the village is very flat with few hills.
