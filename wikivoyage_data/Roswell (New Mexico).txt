Roswell is a city in the southeastern region of the state of New Mexico, United States of America.  It has attained a quirky sort of fame/notoriety as the result of an alleged UFO crash (!) in 1947.

By plane[edit]
33.301556-104.5305561 Roswell International Air Center (ROW  IATA), 1 Jerry Smith Circle, ☏ +1-575-347-5703. American Eagle from Dallas/Fort Worth and Phoenix/Sky Harbor   (updated Nov 2019)
Roswell is served by American Eagle, the regional affiliate of American Airlines, with daily flights to Dallas/Fort Worth and Phoenix. If you fly in, you may be amazed to see some big planes (including widebodies) at the airport or flying near town at low altitude, but they aren't there for passenger service: the Roswell air park is a former US Air Force base that has been used from time to time by major airlines as a training site for aircrews and to check out new aircraft.

By car[edit]
Road access is via US 285 from north or south and US 70 or 380 from east or west. You go through a lot of emptiness getting there, particularly from the north; don't set out for the city from I-40 with a near-empty fuel tank. Limited bus service is available.
