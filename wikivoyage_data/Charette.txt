Understand[edit]
History[edit]
The toponym Charette evokes the memory of Édouard de Charette for his dedication to the public cause of development of the locality of Charette. He was personally involved in bringing the railway to Charette. A section linking Trois-Rivières and Shawinigan has been erected, with a train station in Charette.
The immaculate wooden and painted white church was erected in Charette in 1909. The first mayor, Joseph De Charette, led the municipality from 1918 to 1927. The municipality's motto is "Proudly and always better". This motto is affixed to the bottom of the municipal coat of arms.

Geography[edit]
The village of Charette is built on an elevation, at the foot of the lofty Laurentian range. The course of the Yamachiche river is very meandering upstream from the village; it crosses the village in a northeast direction.
Besides the main village, the main hamlets are Domaine-Samson and Domaine-Marchand, located around a small lake. Residences are denser along Route 351 leading north to Saint-Élie-de-Caxton, as well as along Chemin de la Grande-Ligne.

Economy[edit]
Economic activities in Charette have mainly been: agriculture, forestry, small industries (e.g., sawmill), local businesses and local services (e.g., municipality, primary education).
The territory to the east of the village (therefore to the east of the railway) has an entirely agricultural vocation. While the western part of the territory is mostly wooded.
