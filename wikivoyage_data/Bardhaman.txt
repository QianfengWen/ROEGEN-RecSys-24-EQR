Curzon Gate (Bijoy Toran) at night
Bardhaman (BAWR-dhoh-mahn), the administrative headquarters of Purba Bardhaman district, is the fifth largest city in West Bengal and growing fast. Since independence, it has emerged as a higher education hub. Bardhaman gets its name from Vardhamana Mahavira, the last Jain tirthankara in 6th century BC, who is said to have traversed this region.
Located in the fertile plains of Bengal, it has been the target of many an invader and witnessed many battles, the most touching being the battle between Sher Afgan and Qutubuddin Aibak in 1610, to determine the fate of Meherunissa, wife of Sher Afgan, who emerged as Noor Jehan. Sher Afgan and Qutubuddin Aibak lay buried in Bardhaman.
The Badhaman Raj family has played a more dynamic role in shaping the destiny of Bardhaman. Curzon Gate is an important landmark in Bardhaman and the Rajbati now houses the University of Burdwan.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The nearest airport is Kazi Nazrul Islam Airport (RDP IATA) at Durgapur, roughly 75 km (47 mi) from Bardhaman. However, only a few flights serve the airport. Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport (CCU IATA) at Kolkata (roughly 90 km (56 mi) from Bardhaman) is the nearest airport to get to Bardhaman smoothly. In either case, one may have to change to other modes of transport to reach one's destination.

Map of Bardhaman
Cycle rickshaws and electric rickshaws (locally known as totos) are available for travel within the city. As all the tourist attractions are near the major roads, walking is also a good option. There is no need of booking a rickshaw. They are widely available and a combination of rickshaws and walking is the best way to explore the city.
However, due to restrictions imposed on totos in Bardhaman, crossing the Grand Trunk Road (GT Road) in the city with such vehicles can be problematic or even prohibited. You should either take other modes of transport or simply walk to cross the road.
