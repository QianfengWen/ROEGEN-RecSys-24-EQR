Kilbirnie is the largest of a cluster of small towns in Ayrshire, at the head of the Garnock Valley 20 miles (30 km) southwest of Glasgow. 


Understand[edit]
Kikbirnie was the cell or abode of the 6th century St Brendan, Cill Bhraonaigh. It grew up around the flax and weaving industries, using the freshwater loch to rot the tough flax fibres so they could be milled into linen. Iron and steelmaking developed in the 19th and early 20th centuries then subsided, leaving Kilbirnie a commuter town for Glasgow and Irvine. In 2020 the population was 7170. It also gave its name to the suburb of Kilbirnie in Wellington, New Zealand.
Beith probably means birch trees - the area was wooded and the town made furniture as well as flax. Iron- and steel-making collapsed in the 20th century especially with the loss of the main local customer, the Linwood car factory which closed in 1981. However there's a large industrial estate west by the loch. Beith in 2020 had a population of 5940.
These towns are on the natural valley route from Glasgow towards the Ayrshire coast, and have almost merged into a single conurbation. But not quite, as the decision was taken in the 1960s to concentrate urban growth at Irvine further south.
Lochwinnoch (population 2810 in 2020) further down the valley is across the county boundary in Renfrewshire, now part of Clydeside, but might be easier to explore from Kilbirnie.

See[edit]
55.7467-4.68671 Kilbirnie Auld Kirk, Dalry Road KA25 6HY. July-Aug Tu-Th 14:00-16:00. This is probably on the site of the 6th-century "cell of St Brendan", but the oldest part of the present building is the nave from 1470, with the bell tower added in 1490.  Aisles were added in 1597 for the Cunninghames of Glengarnock and in 1642 for the Crawfords.The transept and new entrance front were added in 1903-05. The Kirk continues for the time being as an active Church of Scotland parish church, with Sunday services at 11AM, but is being considered for closure.   (updated Sep 2022)
55.753-4.6622 Kilbirnie Loch is about 1 mile long by half a mile wide and 20 ft deep. It was once part of a much larger freshwater lake, reduced by silting and early modern drainage to Kilbirnie, Barr and Castle Semple lochs, draining northeast towards the Clyde. There are several access points - from Kilbirnie the easiest is the lane to the southwest tip, but the shore near Beith is industrial. Activities include angling, bird watching and water skiing.
Kilbirnie Auld Kirk
55.7799-4.695833 Glengarnock Castle  is a medieval stump teetering on a knoll above the Lugton Water. It's unclear when it was built, maybe 13th century, but certainly pre-gunpowder as it lacks gun ports. It was abandoned by the 18th century. Reach it by the farm track along the east riverbank.
55.753-4.6324 Beith is on the old road from Glasgow but now bypassed by A737. The Auld Kirk dates from 1593 but only the bell tower remains. Beith High Church (Church of Scotland) was built in 1807 and Trinity Church (also C of S) in 1883; their congregations have combined. Our Lady of Perpetual Succour (Roman Catholic) was rebuilt in 1910. The Town House (built 1817) was the lock-up, courthouse and council chamber.
55.793-4.6295 Lochwinnoch is a village next to the strip of land separating Barr and Castle Semple lochs, a wetland RSPB reserve. Only a gable end and graveyard remains of the 1729 Church of St John. Barr Castle is a ruined turret to the south, while northeast is the Castle Semple estate, with a crumbling grotto and collegiate church. The original Castle Semple was replaced by a Gothic mansion in 1735. This burned down in 1924 and its outbuildings have been converted to private dwelings.
55.6761-4.71046 Museum of Ayrshire Country Life is in a 17th-century watermill six miles south of Kilbirnie, see Kilwinning.
