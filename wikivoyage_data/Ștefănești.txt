At the end of the 19th century, Ștefănești was a rural commune in the Argeșelul plasa of Muscel county, being formed by the villages Ștefănești and Izvorani, with 1628 inhabitants. There were three churches and a school in the commune in 1866. At that time, the communes of Golești (the residence of the Podgoria plasa) and Valea Mare (in the Râurile network) also functioned on the current territory of the commune. Golești commune consisted of the villages of Golești, Uderu and Valea Boierească, with a total of 800 inhabitants. In the commune there were the houses of the Golescu family, a church and a school with 63 students. Valea Mare commune, with the villages of Câmpul, Valea Mare, Enculești and Ploscariu, had 1172 inhabitants; there were also 3 churches and a school here. 
The Socec yearbook records the three communes in the Golești network of the same county. Ștefănești commune was the residence of the plasa, having 2420 inhabitants in the villages of Florica, Izvorani, Ștefănești and Târgu Dealului; Golești commune was composed of Golești and Valea Boierească villages, with 1063 inhabitants; and Valea Mare commune had 1460 inhabitants. inhabitants, being made up of the villages of Enculești, Ploscari and Valea Mare. In 1931, in order to be distinguished from Valea Mare-Pravăț commune, Valea Mare commune took its name from Valea Mare-Podgoria.
In 1950, the communes were transferred to the regional city of Pitești, the residence of the Argeș region. During that period, political refugees from Greece, driven out of the Greek Civil War, were brought to Florica, in the house confiscated from the Brătianu family.Therefore, the village of Florica was called Partizanii at that time. However, this name lasted only until 1964, when it was changed again to Ștefăneștii Noi. In 1968, the communes were transferred to Argeș county, at the same time the communes of Golești and Valea Mare-Podgoria were abolished, their villages moving to Ștefănești commune, organized as a suburban commune of Pitești municipality. In 1989, the concept of suburban commune disappeared from the legislation, and Ștefănești commune was directly subordinated to Argeș county.
