Understand[edit]
Its population of 1.7 million (2017) makes it the fourth most populous municipality in Mexico.
It is considered one of the most environmentally friendly cities in Mexico and has a high number of cyclists, in part because of integrating a network of bike lanes into the SIT system.
León's strong leather industry makes shoes, boots, belts, jackets, and other leather accessories for national and international markets. The leather industry earned its inhabitants the nickname of "green belly" (panzaverde in Spanish) because of the green tainting in the workers' bodies resulting from treating leather.

Get around[edit]
By e-hailing[edit]
Uber and Didi are available.

By bus[edit]
For finding a connection, Moovit is somewhat better than Google Maps, because Moovit shows you the frequency of the buses. You can pay every bus ride with the bus card or in cash. It costs M$12 (Dec 2021).
The buses only stop at bus stops. The non-express buses must be flagged down, and in order to exit the bus, the stop button must be pushed.
The Sistema Integrado de Transporte (SIT) operates a bus rapid transit (BRT) system named “Optibús”. The route system is divided into four categories:

Trunk routes: eight main lines that cross the city from end to end. The buses are known as Orugas (caterpillars in Spanish) due to their articulated midsections. The Optibús transit system consists of 52 stations located in the central area of the main avenues of the city.
Feeder and Auxiliary Routes: urban bus routes that have one or more transfer stations. Are identified by the letter A (Feeder route/yellow decals) or X (Auxiliary route/blue decals).
Conventional Routes circulate through most of the city and are distinguished by having the corporative colors from its owners: orange, red, pink, purple and green.
Suburban Routes: routes are circulating outside or on the city edge communities as Comanjilla, Duarte, Loza de los Padres, La Hacienda.
There are three permanent transfer stations (San Jeronimo, Delta de Jerez and San Juan Bosco), two micro-stations (Santa Rita - Parque Juarez), which are the endpoints for trunk routes, feeder routes and auxiliary routes. Passengers at these stations are allowed to transfer without cost from any of these lines.

By bicycle[edit]
The city's bicycle paths are extensive. Leon is one of the most bicycle-friendly large cities in Latin America and has an extraordinary track record in active transport, keeping the biking and walking share above 39% of the total trips, one of the highest values in Latin American cities.
