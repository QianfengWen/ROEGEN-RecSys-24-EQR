Princeton is a city of 6,347 people (as of 2000) in West Virginia. It was established in 1838 and named for Princeton, New Jersey, where General Hugh Mercer — an apothecary from Fredericksburg, Virginia, for whom Mercer County was named — was killed in a Revolutionary War battle.

Nearby[edit]
Lake Shawnee[edit]
A small unincorporated community located along US Route 19, 3.5 miles (5.6 km) northwest of Princeton.

37.4078-81.14069 Lake Shawnee Amusement Park. An abandoned amusement park (1920s-1966) occupies a desecrated native burial ground which was the site of the 1783 Mitchell Clay settler farm. Three of the Clay children (Bartley, Tabitha, Ezekial) were killed by a band of natives; Mitchell Clay led a group of settlers in bloody retaliation, causing several fatalities. In the 1920s, businessman Conley T. Snidow purchased the site of the Clay farm for development as an amusement park; the park was abandoned in 1966 after two children were killed (a girl on a circling swing was hit by a truck and a boy drowned in the amusement park’s swimming pond). The park structures and rides stand in abandoned and deteriorating condition; tours of the "cursed" site are offered in the days leading up to Hallow'een.
