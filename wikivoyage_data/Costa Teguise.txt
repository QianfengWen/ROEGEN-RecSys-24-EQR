Costa Teguise is a beach resort on the east coast of Lanzarote in the Canary Islands. It's about 7 km east of the capital Arrecife and 15 km from the island's airport. In 2022 the resident population was 8949, but this is greatly swelled by visitors, as it's a popular spot for budget package holidays. It was built as a planned resort in the 1970s, which must have been exciting times here, as the bedrock is tough lava and the developer was Rio Tinto Explosives.

Arrecife Airport (ACE IATA) is 15 km (9.3 mi) southwest: most visitors are on package flights and are bussed straight to their hotels. By public bus, you need to ride into Arrecife and change. A family group will find it simpler to grab a taxi.

By bus[edit]
 Bus 3. Runs from Arrecife to Costa Teguise taking 20 min, every 20 minutes in the daytime and hourly at night. Westbound it continues past the city to Playa Honda and Puerto del Carmen, another 40 min. (updated Dec 2023)
 Bus 11. Takes 30 min from Costa Teguise to Teguise Market, with five runs on Sunday morning, returning early afternoon. (updated Dec 2023)
 Bus 31. Takes 45 min from Caleta de Famara on the north coast, daily every 90 min. (updated Dec 2023)
29.0017-13.48541 Hotel Salinas is how the bus turnaround in Costa Teguise is shown on timetables. It's just a turning loop with no facilities, by the entrance to Paradisus Salinas.

Get around[edit]
The village is spread out but level going and walkable. Buses from Arrecife and elsewhere pass through to the Salinas turnaround. The minimum fare in 2023 is €1.40. 
Costa Teguise, Arrecife, Puerto del Carmen and Playa Honda are covered by Superpedestrian Link Scooters and can be used with their app. You can take and leave one e-scooter anywhere. Some beach promenade areas excluded them. In 2023 one ride costs €1 to unlock and €0.30 per minute.
Over a dozen car rental firms cluster along the main hotel strips of Av del Jablillo, Av de las Islas Canarias and C las Acacias. There's no need to hire from the airport for a full week if you only plan 2 or 3 days sightseeing round the island.

See[edit]
Town is a modern sprawl, with no real centre to it.
28.9958-13.48581 Goleta Jetty is the best of the town jetties and breakwaters, as it has a broad paved surface - several others are rough rocks. The view is better in morning light, and of course this coast doesn't get the sunset. Two weird towers stand at its end, as if Max Ernst had designed receiver masts for FM Radio from Uranus.
29.0038-13.48722 Aquarium Lanzarote, C Las Acacias (Centro Comercial El Treból), ☏ +34 928 590069. Daily 10:00-18:00. Well-stocked aquarium with walk-through tunnel. Adult €15, conc €12, child €10. (updated Oct 2023)
28.9878-13.50483 Residencia Real de La Mareta is a closely-guarded luxury mansion, so you'll have to make do with a distant view. It was built for King Hussein of Jordan in the 1970s, taking its name from a nearby mareta, a water cistern. Hussein never stayed here himself and in 1989 he gave it to King Juan Carlos I who in turn gave it to Patrimonio Nacional, the body that looks after Spanish heritage buildings. It's still occasionally used by Spanish royalty and other VIPs.
29.0082-13.5374 Tahiche Cave, C Bravo Murillo, Tahiche. 24 hours. A lava tube cave set in volcanic scenery. You need a flashlight to go any distance inside, and it's trash-strewn. A 15 min hike brings you to the rim of the caldera. Free. (updated Oct 2023)
29.0019-13.54715 Fundación César Manrique, C Jorge Luis Borges, Tahiche, ☏ +34 928 843138. Daily 10:00-18:00. César Manrique (1919-1992) was an artist, sculptor and nature activist. His later home was burrowed out of the volcanic rock here, and turned into a museum of his life, art and times. He campaigned for sustainable tourism and against samey high-rise hotels. Adult €10. (updated Oct 2023)
