Taradale is a suburb of Napier, in the Hawke's Bay region on the east coast of New Zealand's North Island. It's 10 km southwest of the Napier city centre and is also known as the Taradale and Greenmeadows area. It's the home of some of Hawke's Bay's finest vineyards.


Understand[edit]
Taradale had a population of 16,599 in the 2006 Census. It was a separate town until it merged with Napier in 1968, and is only a 10-minute drive from the CBD of that tourist destination. It has more than a third of Napier district’s population and is one of the most important areas in the region, with one of the highest socio-economic demographic profiles in Hawke's Bay. Many of its residents commute to the Napier or Hastings CBD and prefer rural or suburban life rather than the city life of central Napier.
It's a prosperous, established community nestled against the Taradale hills in an area rich in wine heritage dating back to the 1850s. Two of Hawke's Bay's most famous vineyards, Mission Estate and Church Road, are in the area and together attract over 300,000 tourists a year.
