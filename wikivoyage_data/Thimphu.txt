Thimphu (ཐིམ་ཕུག།) is the capital of the Kingdom of Bhutan, and with a population of around 115,000 (2017), it is the nation's largest city.


Understand[edit]
Although the Thimphu Valley has supported small settlements for many centuries and a dzong has existed there since 1216, the city didn't really develop until the king declared Thimphu the new capital in 1961. Vehicles first appeared on the streets a year later, and slowly the city began to adapt to its role as the nation's capital. Since then, the town has undergone massive development. Tree-lined streets have been laid and the clock tower area in the center of the city is now a park-cum-open air theater where fairs and live cultural performances take place. In 2008, the national stadium and a new river-side park were completed. The area around the dzong and government buildings is a particularly green and an attractive district.

Norzin Lam is the city's main thoroughfare and is lined with small hotels and shopping complexes.

Climate[edit]
The winter season in Thimphu is very cold but dry, while the summers are wet and humid. The best times to visit are from mid September to the end of October and from March to May.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
27.40888989.4205561 Paro Airport (PBH IATA).    is the country's sole international airport and a 45-minute to 1-hour drive from the capital. Bhutan has four domestic airports and two domestic and international carriers.
To avoid the hefty airfare rates charged to foreigners flying into Bhutan, many overseas nationals opt to fly to Bagdogra Airport in Siliguri and then travel overland to Bhutan. The journey from Siliguri to Thimphu takes 9-10 hours. There is no direct bus, and passengers will need to change transportation in Phuentsholing. Indian taxis will travel as far as the border town of Jaigaon and will not enter Bhutan.

By bus[edit]
All inter-district buses arrive and depart from the city's bus station across the river from the city centre. It is a 5 hour drive (mostly through Chukha (district) from the border town of Phuentsholing.
Various private operators like Dhug, Meto and Sernya run Toyota Coaster bus services from Phuentsholing to Thimphu.  These buses can seat 22 and are very comfortable. Advance reservation can be made at Phuentsholing bus station or online: https://www.drukride.com/

Get around[edit]
27°28′23″N 89°38′19″EMap of Central Thimphu
The city center is small enough to negotiate on foot.

By bus[edit]
The city operates an efficient public bus service connecting the downtown with outer suburbs. The station for local buses, known locally as 'Bus Parking' is located just east of Changlimithang  Stadium.

By taxi[edit]
There is a set rate for taxis plying city routes — within the core area the rate is Nu 120 (Bhutanese ngultrum), while it costs around Nu150-160 to nearby suburbs. There are taxi ranks on Norzin Lam (near the cinema hall and Punjab Bank). Taxis also cruise and can be hailed at any point. There are shared taxis from the city bus station ('Bus Parking), and the rate is around Nu35-40 to suburbs within a 20- to 30-min drive.

See[edit]
Although lacking the charm and culture associated with ancient capitals, Thimphu has several attractions of note. A hefty entry fee is charged to all foreign nationals (including those with work permits or who are paying the daily tariff of US$100 to the government sustainable fund) at religious structures and buildings of national significance.  

Religious structures[edit]
Monasteries are referred to by their Dzongkha title of lhakhang or gompa.

Constructed in the 15th century, this is one of the oldest temples in the Thimphu Valley, and is dedicated to Avalokiteshvara, the Buddhist emanation of compassion.

Later it was enlarged to accommodate both the monastic and civil bodies. Three times suffering severe damage from fire and once from an earthquake in 1897, much of the historic building dates from the rebuilding in 1902. To accommodate the national government and the central monastic body, the dzong was totally refurbished and enlarged in 1962, a year after Thimphu was designated the nation's capital. The main structure of the whitewashed building is two-storeyed with three-storeyed towers at each of the four corners topped by triple-tiered golden roofs.

Buy[edit]
Norzin Lam, the main street
Bhutan's small population means demand for new and innovative goods is limited. Thimphu has three kinds of stores: clothing, handicraft and hardware. Between these, there is a small assortment of stationery, bookshops, and supermarkets. Almost all shops stock the same goods, so if you cannot find the required items in the first couple of stores it is generally useless to persist.
Haggling at tourist-oriented shops is expected, but the margin for discount is small (unless you make a bulk purchase). However, shop owners are generally honest and there is little possibility to be cheated or offered an inflated price.
Most handicrafts sold in Thimphu are made in Nepal or other Himalayan areas. Exceptions are cloth items, some thankas, goods made of lemon grass oil, incense, and Bhutanese coffee.

Cope[edit]
Clocktower Square
Getting work done in Thimphu is relatively straight forward. All offices are computerized and the staff are generally helpful. However, it is often said that Bhutan has one of the world's highest rates of meetings and workshops per working hours. This cannot be substantiated, but certainly meetings are very much part of the civil service culture here. In fact, it is often joked that the last place you should begin a search for a civil servant is at his or her desk! As a result, you should  be prepared to make several visits to an office in order to get a task complete as there is a very high possibility that the  person dealing with your case will be out of the office.

ATM. Bhutan operates an international ATM service, though as it is sometimes out of order, it is advisable to bring sufficient cash to at least cover basics.
Banks. The three main banks in Thimphu are 'Bank of Bhutan', 'Bhutan National Bank' and 'Punjab National Bank'. The first two are both located on the upper part of Norzin Lam, while the Punjab National Bank is on the lower part of the street, near the Clock Tower.
Money Exchange. All banks offer money exchange facilities for common convertible currencies. Druk Currency Exchange, !F, Gaaphel Shopping Complex (below Le Meridien Hotel) exchanges a number of foreign currencies at more convenient hours and at better rates than banks.
Post Office. The central PO is in the lower part of town on Chang Lam. It is a large and well organized facility that includes a philatelic department. Mailing letters or packages in Bhutan is usually very safe though, like elsewhere, anything of value should be registered. The post office also offers a custom made stamp and packing service.
Visa extensions and route permits are available at the Immigration Office, Kawajangsa (above the golf course). Route permits should be applied for at least one full working day before the intended date of travel. A photocopy of passport (pages containing personal information and Bhutanese visa) is required.
Western Union, Thimphu Post Office. This facility can receive transfer of funds from overseas, but cannot make outward payments.

Go next[edit]
Buses depart the inter-district bus station (known locally as 'Bus Booking') throughout the day, though most, especially those heading to the east and Jakar/Bumthang leave between 06:30 and 07:30. As the inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance, either at the bus station or online: https://www.drukride.com/. Buses to Phuentsholing depart every half hour until 4PM. Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable means to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 250) and Punakha (Nu 350) or even to Phuentsholing (Nu1,000) (as of February 2024). Shared taxis depart from the inter-district bus station, with drivers approaching potential passengers. They depart once full.
Monastic complexes are referred to by their Bhutanese title of 'gompa', not 'monastery'.

Cheri Gompa — It is the first Drukpa Kagyu Monastery established in Bhutan and is at the site where Shabdrong Rinpoche gained enlightenment. Consequently, Cheri is one of the most important monasteries in Bhutan. The structure is cut into the steep mountainside and has a very atmospheric stone stairway connecting its various levels. Located about an hour's drive north of Thimphu, the trek begins from a prayer flag covered bridge and takes about one hour.  Tango and Cheri are about a one hour hike apart, and so are usually visited on the same trip.
Dochula Pass — The highest point on the journey between Thimphu and Punakha, it has a very good view of a lot of Himalayan peaks, including the Gangkhar Phuensum, which is claimed to be the highest unclimbed mountain in the world. Also has a cafe which serves good coffee and decent parathas.
Jakar — A town at the heart of a sacred and beautiful valley. The journey from Thimphu takes between 9 and 11 hours. A minimum of three days are needed to do justice to a visit.
Phajoding Gompa — Founded in the 13th century by Togen Pajo, a yogi from Tibet, this  monastic complex is a three-hour hike from Thimphu (start from Motithang or BBS Tower). At a height of 3,640 m, it commands excellent views over Thimphu. There is space for camping. Otherwise, the small Thujidrag Gompa (a 40-minute walk from Phajoding) offers simple accommodation (often full at weekends) and cooking facilities - offer donation directly to monk in charge. Even if you do not plan to stay at Thujidrag,  this cliff hanging monastery is still definitely worth a visit. Locally, it is famous for its sacred spring water. There are several sacred lakes in the area, though these are a full day's circular hike from Thujidrag.
Paro — The location of the international airport and center of a sacred valley. Paro is a 45-minute to one-hour drive from the capital - an easy day trip.
Punakha — The former capital; a 90-minute journey.
Tango Gompa — About an hour's drive from Thimphu down town followed by a one hour hike, this is one of Bhutan's historical monasteries in the Kagyu tradition. It was founded by the grandson of the Divine Madman, Drukpa Kinley, and houses some of his relics. The monastery offers spectacular views over the Thimphu Valley.
