Goseong (고성, 固城) is in South Gyeongsang province in South Korea.
Goseong-gun can be traced back to the history of dinosaurs. The history of dinosaurs in Goseong Dinosaur Museum, Korea's first museum specializing in dinosaurs, as well as dinosaur footprints remaining on coastal rocks near Sangjokam Rock, are indispensable. Hakdong Village, which has a nice old stone wall, is good for walking lightly.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Gyeongnam's Goseong is named after 'a hard castle made of iron'. Since iron is stronger than stone in terms of hardness, the so-called impregnable fortress is also compared to iron fortification. Since the original name of Goseong was also called Cheolseong, it is a hard iron castle equivalent to Cheolongseong. In the poem, Yi Cheom said, 'Goeul's castle has been newly built with iron gates, and the drumbeat on top of it is round. When I checked the people, it reached the old level, and the end of the war is in March, so spring change is unfolded.' This is an expression of the solidity of the fortress made of iron gates and a fortress that encourages military activities. Therefore, the name of the land of Goseong, which is continuously used from King Gyeongdeok to today, has the same context as steel in terms of solidity.

A famous point[edit]
Goseong-gun is famous as a tourist destination related to dinosaurs. Until the early 1990s, it was a place where there were no symbols to put forward. However, since the discovery of dinosaur footprints due to an academic survey in 1982, the name Goseong has become known as it has attracted domestic and international attention. Among them, Sangjokam County Park was a swamp of lakes 150 million years ago, and more than 2,000 of the world's largest dinosaur footprints have been found, making it one of the world's top three dinosaur sites along with Colorado in the U.S. and the western coast of Argentina.
In addition, the Dinosaur Expo is held, and the dinosaur footprint of the Mesozoic Era is a major tourist item. It is said to be quite helpful in the tourism income of Goseong.
Danghangpo in Hwagwa-myeon, famous for Admiral Yi Sun-shin's Battle of Danghangpo, is also famous. It is a wonderful place to see the cool sea and coast. In addition, Danghangpo is the place where the dinosaur expo mentioned above is held. In particular, Danghangpo is a camping site that has recently attracted attention in the camping world. Facilities such as toilets and showers are rated the best among camping sites in the country.

Since it is located in the middle of major cities in Gyeongsangnam-do, roads have been developed a lot from early on. Sacheon, Jinju, and Changwon are directly attached to each other.
There are many traffic exchanges with major cities in Gyeongsangnam-do such as Geoje and Tongyeong.
It connects Jinju and Tongyeong by penetrating Goseong southeast-northwest through the Tongyong Daejeon Expressway.

Jinju: Jinju is a central city among the regions in the south of Korea. The town is cut in half by the Nam River (Namgang)
Changwon: Changwon is the capital city of South Gyeongsang in South Korea, and incorporates the known harbor town of Masan. Changwon is the first of South Korea's few planned cities.
Geoje: Dubbing itself the "Blue City", Geoje is more of an island than a city. It is in fact Korea's second largest island (only Jeju is larger) with a loose collection of villages and settlements scattered in coves around the coastline.
Tongyeong: Tongyeong is a historical port city in South Gyeongsang. It is known throughout Korea for its picturesque harbor, a coastal city consisting of 192 islands that is full of exotic things to enjoy.
