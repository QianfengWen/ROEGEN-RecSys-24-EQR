Sinsheim is a city in Baden-Württemberg, a state of Germany.


Understand[edit]
The town would probably be of little note if it weren't for the Auto&Technik Museum, which houses two of the few surviving passenger supersonic planes, and TSG Hoffenheim, a soccer club that mostly rose to the top in the 21st century on the strength of sponsorship money. Sinsheim is also birth place of '48er and American Civil War major general (for the Union) Franz Sigel, the highest ranking German American during the conflict.
