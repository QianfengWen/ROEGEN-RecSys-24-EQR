Bad Hersfeld is a town in North Hesse that Hersfeld is known across Germany for the Bad Hersfelder Festspiele (festival). The festival has taken place each year since 1951 at the ruins of a monastery which are said to be Europe's biggest Romanesque church ruin.


Understand[edit]
Bad Hersfeld is a rather old, mid-sized town with roughly 30,000 inhabitants (2018) that was around during the times of Charlemagne. The word "Bad" in the name means that it is an officially acknowledged spa and has been since 1949. As Bad Hersfeld is roughly in the centre of the reunified Germany several companies like Amazon have decided to have delivery centres here.
