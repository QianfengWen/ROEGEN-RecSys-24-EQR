Panaca is a city of a thousand people (2010) in Southern Nevada. It is one of only two cities in Nevada that prohibits gambling, the other being Boulder City.


Understand[edit]
It was founded as a Mormon settlement in 1864, making it the oldest settlement in Southern Nevada. The town has not changed much since.

History[edit]
Coke ovens here once produced charcoal for the smelters in nearby Bullionville (now a ghost town), but the town's economy is predominantly agricultural.
The name "Panaca" comes from the Southern Paiute word Pan-nuk-ker, which means "metal, money, wealth". William Hamblin, a Mormon missionary to the Paiutes, established the Panacker Ledge (Panaca Claim) silver mine there in 1864.
