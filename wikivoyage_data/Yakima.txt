Stay healthy[edit]
Air stagnation[edit]
Sometimes there will be an advisory issued for poor air quality due to stagnation. Because of Yakima's location within a mountain valley, air sometimes settles and becomes stagnant for an extended period of time. During this phenomenon, pollutants often accumulate and subsequently the air quality becomes poorer than usual, and can affect those individuals who have existing respiratory conditions.
You can refer to the National Weather Service website on air quality to see if any such advisories have been issued for the Yakima Valley region.

Disease[edit]
There have been confirmed cases of hantaviral pulmonary syndrome in the Yakima Valley; the most recent of which occurred during the summer of 2011.
Although this disease is a very rare, it is important to always take precautions when entering confined spaces, or places that are dusty and underexposed to sunlight, where conditions may be ideal for the presence of a rodent population.
For more information on prevention and transmission, visit the CDC website [1] on hantaviruses.

Heat exhaustion[edit]
During the summer months, the temperature in Yakima and the greater Yakima Valley often exceeds 100 °F (38 °C).
If you are to be outside for long periods of time, be sure to drink plenty of water and limit the intake of alcohol and caffeine to prevent dehydration and heat stroke. Should you be planning on venturing off into the surrounding landscape, follow desert survival guidelines. Make sure you know where you are going, tell someone where your destination will be, and take an ample water supply with you.

Stay safe[edit]
Crime[edit]
Yakima has experienced a significant increase in gang activity throughout the past decade due to its population growth. This has resulted in a rise of violent crime within the city limits, although incidents of violence are mostly isolated to particular neighborhoods (mostly on the east side).
Yakima is very nice place to visit and the surrounding scenery is just as wonderful as its sun abundant climate. The problems it does have are typical in most mid-size cities and rarely effect the average person.
The best way to stay safe is to just be smart. Be vigilant! Most often, when people find themselves in a bad situation, it is because they put themselves in that situation. If you need help, there is an often visible police presence in the more troubled locales.
