Drumheller is a town in the Southern Alberta region of Alberta, famous for the rich deposits of fossils found in the area. It is an important centre for Palaeontology in Canada. Set in a characteristic "badlands" valley carved in the plains by the Red Deer River, Drumheller rose through coal mines — now abandoned — early in the 20th century. Now this town of 8,000 (2016) gets hundreds of thousands of visitors between May and September, making it the hub for tourism in the area.


Understand[edit]
Drumheller's tourism is strongly seasonal. Many attractions are closed or open limited hours from October through April.
The town is nestled in the Red Deer River valley. Near the bridge where the highways cross the river stands an 86-foot (26 m) tall sculpture of a Tyrannosaurus Rex and the Visitor's information centre, so this makes a good reference point. Downtown Drumheller is just south and east of this bridge.
Drumheller tourist information is broadcast on FM 94.5.
The weather is usually very hot in the summer (above 30°C, 85°F). Remember to carry mosquito repellent — there are lots of mosquitoes around!

Get in[edit]
Map of Drumheller
Drumheller is located at the convergence of provincial highways 9, 10, 56, 575, and 576.
Drumheller is 140 km (87 mi) northeast of Calgary, about 1 hour 45 minutes by car. Drive east along the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1) to Highway 9, which travels north and east to Drumheller. An alternate route is to drive north along Highway 2, then east along Highway 72 (exit 295), which connects with Highway 9 in the small town of Beiseker. Travelers can approach from the east by taking Highway 9 (Saskatchewan Highway 7) from Saskatoon or taking the Trans-Canada Highway from Regina and then go north on Highway 56.
Tour companies offer day trips to the Royal Tyrrell Museum and the Drumheller Valley. Call the Royal Tyrrell Museum for more information.
Independent travelers staying in Calgary, but wishing to see sights in the Drumheller area without renting a car, may wish to consider the Canadian Badlands Day Trip from Calgary. Sights include the Royal Tyrrell Museum, Horseshoe Canyon, the Atlas Coal Mine museum and the hoodoo rock formations. Serious dinosaur fans may find the visit to the Royal Tyrrell Museum somewhat hurried due to time constraints.

Get around[edit]
Drumheller is a small, rural town. The downtown is compact and easily walkable.  Beyond that, you will need an automobile. A bicycle would also do, but during tourist season it is hot, and the roads don't have good bike lanes.

See[edit]
Hoodoos
Atlas Coal Mine
The badlands landscape is visible all around the town, as it is set in the valley. Although the Horseshoe and Horsethief canyons are good viewpoints to look over town, the best introduction to the landscape is probably on the trails leading from the Tyrrell Museum. The trails there have good views through the canyon, and information signs to give and introduction to the geology. They are all free to access, and it's probably around 2 hours to wander around outside there on clearly marked and graded trails. There are considerable steps, though - so access still requires some moderate fitness.
