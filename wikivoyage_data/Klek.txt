See[edit]
View to the sea
There is a beautiful beach with white pebbles with people watching and paddle boats. Private beaches are a ten-minute walk away, or you can walk along the beach until you reach an uninhabited area. There are tennis courts and a few waterfront cafes. The ancient Konoba Kula was once a famous :"discoteka," or nightclub. Now a crumbling tower, it is worth a look.

Do[edit]
Above Klek, there is a mountain, Smrdelj, where one can climb up and see an excellent view of Klek and neighboring villages. Take a swim in the clear waters and try your luck at fishing! Snorkeling is a fun activity; you can find sea urchins, sea cucumbers, crabs, and various fish. There is a great outdoor pizzeria, with a marble facade with a great view of the beach, that hosts live music.

Buy[edit]
There are various souvenirs, a great buy is Croatian lavender oil, which smells fantastic and wards off bugs. Ston, a nearby town, has a sea salt refinery, where you can buy the local sea salt.

Eat[edit]
There are lots of great pizzerias and fast food places, but if a sit-down dinner is what you're after, Škoj is a seaside restaurant with excellent lignje, or squid. The Hotel Plaza restaurant has an excellent restaurant on the beach with a great selection of fresh seafood and an attentive staff.
Breakfast should always start off with a trip to either of the bakeries, either one just 20 meters from the beach. Bakeries have savoury breakfast specialties, such as slance (delicious rolls with a salt topping), pretzels, or pite- phyllo dough stuffed with anything from cheese to meat or potatoes. For a sweet breakfast treat, Krofne, or doughnuts, are the way to go.

Drink[edit]
There are plenty of cafes with local Croatian beers, such as karlovacko. Bars also serve stronger drinks, including a Croatian specialty, orahnjaca, a walnut liqueur which is sweet and a great digestive; there is the bitter pelinkovac, and rakija as well.

Sleep[edit]
There are many local apartments. Local people rent out their apartments for tourists and you typically have your own balcony, kitchen, bathroom, and multiple bedrooms.
There are also rooms rented out and a hotel.
