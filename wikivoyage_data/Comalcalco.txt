Zocalo in Comalcalco
Comalcalco is a small city in the Gulf coast area of Tabasco, Mexico. It is a very old Maya community known as the westernmost city-state of the Yucatán Maya civilization. The archaeological site is the town's biggest draw, but a nearby biosphere reserve provides plenty of nature-watching opportunities and Comalcalco can be a great base from which to explore nearby scenic colonial churches in outlying villages.


Understand[edit]
The area around Comalcalco was sparsely populated up until about 500 AD when the first structures were built by the Maya. The town continued to grow until it was abandoned around 1000 AD. The modern town dates from 1820 when it was built on an area of the Mezcalapa River that had dried up. Today, it is small city with about 43,000 residents (2020).
The city's main economic activity is agriculture, particularly cacao, which has been grown in the area for at least 2,000 years. Comalcalco and its nearby villages account for 20% of the total cacao production in the state.

Bus lines include AU (an ADO company) and Transportadora Turística del Caribe. Tickets from both companies start at M$40.

Various tours are offered as well as classes and workshops for those who just can never learn enough about chocolate. 
Santuario La Asunción de María  (Ascension of the Virgin Church), Cupilco - In a country full of spectacular historic churches, it's hard to get "Wowed", but this church will do it. Spectacularly colorful and full of natural themes and indigenous patterns, the church feels very Mayan. The baroque architecture and the Christian crosses testify to its roots in Spanish colonialism, but the feel is very un-Spanish. The church is in a small village, about a 10-15 minute taxi ride from the center of Comalcalco, but an absolutely "worth it" side trip.
Reserva Ecologica Rio Playa, Ignacio Zaragoza (3rd and 4th sections) - large protected natural area with dense forests and criss-crossed by swamps and mangrove swamps. Great place for birdwatching, with more than 200 species of resident and migratory avians. Interesting place that is ejido land protected by the local indigenous community; it is not a government-operated reserve.
Comalcalco archaeological site[edit]
Comalcalco archaeological site
The first signs of significant human settlement in Comalcalco appear around 500 AD (late Classic period). The site includes nine major temples (pyramids) that are architecturally similar to the construction of Palenque, but with one huge difference: the people in Comalcalco used bricks and all other Maya cities were built using limestone. The bricks are similar to those used by modern masons in that they're fired clay, but they're flatter in shape, and the Spanish referred to them as comals, the typical flat iron pan used to heat up tortillas or roast chiles. Comalcalco thus earned its name due to the flat shape of its bricks, not to any ancient Mayan moniker.

Relief sculpture and brickwork of a structure at Comalcalco
The bricks are even more unusual in that many of them have carvings of animals or human figures. Who does that? Ancient Maya masons, that's who.

Bricks with animal figures
Comalcalco was home to a number of sculptors who crafted ceramic figurines from the same type of clay used to make bricks. Archaeologists have found sculptures made in Comalcalco at archaeological sites as far as 200 km from Comalcalco. Archaeologists also suggest that Comalcalco was an important producer of cacao, which was also traded inland and along the Gulf coast due to Comalcalco's strategic position on the Mezcalapa River.
The site is located on the north side of the modern town of Comalcalco. It is a well-maintained site, managed by INAH (Instito Nacional de Antropologia y Historia). A site museum contains several relics from the site and has interpretive exhibits that explain some of the site's historical significance.

18.280669-93.2073892 Zona Arqueológica Comalcalco, Nte 1ra Secc.. 09:00 - 16:00. Beautiful site but many signs are faded and others are Spanish only, so hiring one of the site guardians as a guide is a good idea because they'll be able to explain the history as well as local Maya folklore. English speaking guides are not always available, so Spanish skills help. Bring mosquito spray and sunscreen (after all, this is a tropical jungle area and the afternoon sun is usually brutal). M$85.
