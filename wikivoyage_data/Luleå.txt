Luleå, also called Lule, is the seat of Norrbotten County in northern Sweden. The city lies at the mouth of the Lule River, in the north-west corner of the Gulf of Bothnia. It has about 70,000 inhabitants, a technical university, and a steel mill.


Understand[edit]
Luleå city centre
Luleå cathedral
When Luleå was mentioned in documents for the first time in 1327, it was located on the site of today's Gammelstad. It developed into a market place and centre of a parish, which at that time included almost all Norrbotten. Due to the post-glacial land rebound, it became increasingly difficult to use the harbour, and in the mid-17th century the town relocated to where it is now, with the old town changing its name to Gammelstad. The major employers in the area are the steel industry and Facebook (which operates some data centres there). The city is located about 110 km south of the Arctic Circle.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
65.54361122.1219441 Luleå airport (LLA  IATA). Both SAS and Norwegian have several flights per day scheduled from Stockholm Arlanda airport to LLA (fewer during weekends), and with a flight time of about 1 hour 10 minutes, it may be preferred over the 14-hour night train.   
The airport is in Kallax (and thus is commonly called Kallax airport), about 5 km from Luleå city centre, which is accessible by shuttle bus[dead link] or taxi. The shuttle bus to the centre costs 50 kr each way, and it's departures are based on the flight schedule.
There are scheduled flights from Kiruna and Tromsø (Nordkalottflyg), Pajala (Nordkalottflyg), Umeå and Östersund (Nordic Regional), Gothenburg (City Airline), Sundsvall and Borlänge (Direktflyg), London (one flight every Saturday, SAS) and Riga (AirBaltic).

By train[edit]
Map of Malmbanan
Luleå is connected to Stockholm by the over 100-year-old Norra Stambanan (Northern Trunk Line), which travels way into the inner parts of northern Sweden before meeting the coast again at Umeå. Thus, it can be a good price option between Luleå and the southern parts (from Sundsvall and south) of the country, but not between Luleå and some of the other larger cities along the coastline in the northern half of the country, such as Umeå and Skelleftea). All along the northern coast, bus is the way to travel.
Vy has a few sleeper trains scheduled each night between Luleå and Stockholm, about a 14-hr ride; consider paying extra for a bed while booking.
The Malmbanan railway leads from Narvik in Norway to Luleå via the towns of Kiruna, Gällivare and Boden. The railway is not connected to the rest of the Norwegian rail network. The line was mostly intended to deliver the products of Swedish mining to Norway's northernmost ice-free port and was thus of tremendous strategical importance, but it is also an important link for passenger travel in this remote corner. It also reaches the northernmost points connected to the mainline standard gauge rail network in Europe.
There are also regional trains from Haparanda, at the border with Finland via Kalix and Boden.

By bus[edit]
Tapanis Buss has a line going from Stockholm to Tornio, Finland, with a stop in Luleå. Ticket from Stockholm are 870 kr, from Tornio 200 kr.
As there was no passenger rail traffic to Haparanda (at the Finnish border) 1992–2021, the gap got covered by buses, which are free with most rail passes. The journey to the Finnish border at Tornio/Haparanda takes 2½ hr, and onward to Kemi (with trains all year) another half an hour. Note the timezone difference between Sweden and Finland. Local and regional buses are run by Länstrafiken Norrbotten.

Gammelstad, literally "old town", is the old parish village. It is a part of the Swedish national heritage, inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list and was originally the site of Luleå. At its centre is an early 15th-century stone church surrounded by 408 cottages. The town was built to house church visitors from the surrounding countryside, who lived too far away to get back home before nightfall. Due to the land rising (recovery from the last Ice Age) its harbour got unusable and a new city was established closer to where the sea is now. The church was built in 1492, the year when Columbus arrived in America. (updated Jan 2020)
