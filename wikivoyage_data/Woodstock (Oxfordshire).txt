Blenheim Palace
Woodstock is an attractive small town 8 mi (13 km) north of Oxford, England. It is the nearest town to the popular stately home Blenheim Palace, Winston Churchill's birthplace, and is therefore popular with travellers looking for food and accommodation.


Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
Stagecoach Gold runs a frequent service, bus 7 or S3, from Oxford city centre. Bus 7 leaves from Magdalen Street (stop C3), and bus S3 can be taken from George Street (stop B2). The journey is about half an hour long, and costs £3.20 one way (£4.80 return) (Sept 2017).

By car[edit]
Woodstock is about 15 minutes' drive north of Oxford on the A44. Traffic can be heavy, particularly in summer and at weekends, and there are limited parking opportunities.
