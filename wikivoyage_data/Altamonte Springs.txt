 Altamonte Springs is a northern suburb of Orlando in Seminole County, Florida.


Understand[edit]
The city's name is believed to come from the Spanish term for "high mountain." The population was about 42,000 and rising as of 2013.
The city began its rise in growth and status in Metro Orlando in the early 1970s with the construction of the Altamonte Mall which was originally anchored by Sears, Burdines, Jordan Marsh and Robinson's of Florida. It was the metropolitan areas first two level shopping mall. The Interstate Mall across the highway also opened anchored by Montgomery Wards department store and AMC Interstate Six Theaters. Luxury modern apartment complexes were soon lining Wymore Rd., Lake Orienta and Palm Springs Dr.  Many new homes subdivisions began sprouting up along Montgomery Rd., Maitland Ave and Palm Springs Dr. and the beautiful wooded areas surrounding Sanlando Springs, Wekiva Springs and the Wekiva River. Growth boomed through the 1970s and 1980s into the 1990s before leveling off around the new Millennium.  Growth picked up again at a steady pace in the mid-2010s as the city became more established and considered a more "close in" location to Downtown Orlando and the booming offices of Maitland Center.
