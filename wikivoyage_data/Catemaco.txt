Check out the beaches of the gulf with coves and small bays awaiting your discovery.


Get in[edit]
Catemaco is located on Highway 180, also known as The Gulf Coast Highway, about 3-3½ hours south of Veracruz city by car.

Get around[edit]
Taxis are numerous and cheap, starting at around M$15 (pesos).
Local buses run in the town during the day and connect with San Andres Tuxla and other small towns.
Bike rental: You can rent a bike for some hours and ride around a little. The streets are not too bad for that.
rural taxis (or 'mixtos') are pickup trucks which operate like collective taxis and can be flagged down at any point. These are good for getting to places not serviced by bus. They are not the most comfortable option but are good value at M$10.
