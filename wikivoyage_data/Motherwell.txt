Motherwell is an industrial town in the Clydeside region of central Scotland, with a population of 32,840 in 2020. It's 16 miles southeast of Glasgow, and divided by the motorway and River Clyde from neighbouring  Hamilton. 


Understand[edit]
The town name derives from an ancient "Lady Well" or holy well. It was a tiny hamlet until the railway arrived in 1848, when it rapidly grew into an iron and steel-making centre supplying the heavy industries of Glasgow and elsewhere. This growth continued in the 20th century, and the huge Ravenscraig steel-making complex was built on a greenfield site east of town. But by the 1980s other nations were undercutting British Steel, there was a damaging strike, major customers such as car manufacturers were lost, and the industry collapsed. Ravenscraig became a wasteland which is only now being rehabilitated for housing. Steel production continues at Dalzell and Clydebridge, and the town's other employments are public services (such as the council and police bases), call centres and light industry.

By air[edit]
From Glasgow airport (GLA IATA) take Bus 500 to Buchanan station then bus or train as below. From Edinburgh airport (EDI IATA) there's likewise a direct bus to Buchanan station.

By rail[edit]
Motherwell is on the West Coast mainline and has trains from Glasgow Central every 15 minutes or so, taking 20-40 min. The fast trains continue to Carlisle, Preston, Manchester Piccadilly and airport; to Edinburgh, Newcastle upon Tyne, York, Leeds and down through the Midlands to Penzance; and to Warrington,  Birmingham New Street and London Euston. The London services include the Caledonian Lowland Sleeper, which leaves Euston Su-F near midnight to reach Motherwell for 7AM; southbound times are similar. But for long-distance routes to town it's often quicker to travel into Glasgow for a non-stop train.
Slow trains from Glasgow Central to Motherwell also call at Rutherglen, Cambuslang, Blantyre,  Hamilton and Airbles. Some continue via Wishaw and Carluke to Lanark, or via Coatbridge to Cumbernauld.
55.792-3.9941 Motherwell railway station is central in town. It's being rebuilt, not a moment too soon, so expect some upheaval and temporary facilities until it is complete, maybe late in 2023. 
Airbles station only has the slow trains but may be more convenient for the south side of town.
