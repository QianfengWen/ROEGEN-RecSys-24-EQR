Mexican-American border separating Nogales, Arizona from Nogales, Sonora
Nogales is a city divided by the US-México border, which runs through the middle of town on what was International Street. The city is one of the most important border crossings between Mexico and the USA by all measures.
This portion of the city is in South Central Arizona; see Nogales (Sonora) for the portion in Sonora, Mexico.


Understand[edit]
31°21′14″N 110°56′21″WMap of Nogales (Arizona)
The origin of the name Nogales is Spanish and derives from the word walnut, since walnut trees used to grow here. International Street, which separates Arizona and México, was once a wide main street much like any other. This changed on August 27, 1918 when American authorities opened fire on a Mexican civilian attempting to return to Sonora, igniting an international gun battle (the Battle of Ambos Nogales) which raged for days and ended with the construction of the first permanent border fence right down the centre of the village. The honorific "Heroica Nogales" was conferred on the Mexican portion of the community in recognition of this history.

Stay safe[edit]
America's appetite for various contraband street drugs has ensured a steady stream of US dollars and US weapons southward to dangerous organised gangs on the Mexican side at all major crossings, in return for drugs which transit Mexico on their way north.
This has created dangers for travellers continuing westward into Mexico from the Nogales area; see the current travel warning issued by the US State Department. If you intend to cross at Nogales, it may be best to stay on the main toll road (México 15), travel by day and avoid display of jewels or valuables in order to keep a low profile.
