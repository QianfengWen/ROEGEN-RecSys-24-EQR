By train[edit]
Amtrak provides connecting bus service through Santa Maria (bus stop is located at the IHOP near 101/Main St). The bus connects with the Pacific Surfliner train in Santa Barbara. There is a train station in the nearby town of Guadalupe served by the Pacific Surfliner Amtrak train (one southbound train from San Luis Obispo stops there in the morning, northbound train from San Diego stops there at night).

By bus[edit]
There is a Greyhound station at 755 W Cypress Street, and the Greyhound bus also stops at the same IHOP as the Amtrak bus.

By car[edit]
Santa Maria is home to one of the first and one of the few still-operating drive-in movie theaters, and is definitely a car town. Highway 101 runs through Santa Maria, as well as California highways 1, 135 and 166. North on 101 takes you through Pismo Beach, San Luis Obispo, and on to San Francisco . South takes you to Los Alamos, Buellton, Solvang, Santa Barbara, and Los Angeles. Highway 1 is a scenic drive; taken northward it leads you through several small towns eventually connecting with 101 just past Pismo Beach. Taken south on Highway 1 after the split with 1 and 135 leads to Lompoc and Vandenberg Air Force Base and 135 leads to Los Alamos (which is 8 miles after the intersection with Harris Grade Road (the old California 1 south to Lompoc)). Highway 166 west takes you to Guadalupe and the coast, and east takes you to the great central valley of California. Highway 135 south takes you to Los Alamos (if the left exit at the gore point is used) or Vandenberg Air Force Base (if the right exit is used) and eventually connect with 101 at Los Alamos. North will also take you to the 101 near the northern city limits.

Go next[edit]
Guadalupe - This small town is 9 miles west of Santa Maria and is primarily focused on agriculture and oil production.  Travelers will enjoy visiting the neighboring Guadaulpe-Nipomo Dunes, an 18-mile stretch of beach that is one of the largest remaining natural dune areas in California.  The Ten Commandments was filmed in the dunes and the sets were buried after production, but today blowing winds repeatedly reveal and then re-cover these reproductions of ancient Egypt.
