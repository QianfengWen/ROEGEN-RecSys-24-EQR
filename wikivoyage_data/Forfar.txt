Forfar is the county town of Angus, 13 miles north of Dundee. It had a linen and jute industry in the 18th and 19th centuries but those have gone, so Forfar is now a commuter town for Dundee, with a population in 2020 of 14,000. The main reasons to visit are Glamis Castle, and the fine Pictish carved stones here and at Meigle and Aberlemno.

East and Old Church (Church of Scotland) on High St was built in 1789/90, with the clock tower added in 1815.
Lowson Memorial Church (Church of Scotland) at the foot of Montrose Road was built in 1914 in Scots Gothic style.
56.645-2.92 Forfar Loch west side of town is a shallow freshwater lake, about a mile long east-west. There's a park and paths for strolling. St Margaret's Inch, the gravel projection on the north bank, had a crannog and monk's cell but nothing remains of them.
56.669-33 Kirriemuir is a village 7 miles northwest of Forfar which in the 16th century was the scene of witch hunts. But it's best known as the birthplace of JM Barrie (1860-1937), author of Peter Pan, and his house is a museum run by NTS. The Tayside Police Museum is on Reform St, open Th-Su 11AM-3PM. Other local artifacts such as Pictish stones have been taken to Meigle or other museums. The actor David Niven (1910-1983) claimed to have been born in Kirriemuir, in fact it was London.
56.638-2.9784 St Orland's Stone stands in fields at Crossan 4 miles west of Forfar. It's a Pictish cross-slab and depicts a boat: Forfar Loch and wetlands may once have extended this far. In 2020 it's covered over for conservation work.
56.6203-3.00245 Glamis Castle, Glamis DD8 1RJ, ☏ +44 1307 840393. Closed until 16 March 2024. Glamis (say glamz) Castle has been the home of the Lyon family since the 14th century, though the present building, a turreted chateau, is from the 17th century. It was the childhood home of Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, who married King George VI, and was later known as Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. Her second daughter Princess Margaret was born here and the castle remains the home of the Earl and Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne. Naturally they big-up this aristocratic roll-call but it was a coal-mining fortune in the 18th century that paid for the present splendour. Highlights are the grand Drawing Room, the Kitchens, and Duncan's Hall where, according to Shakespeare, Macbeth murdered King Duncan. (Actually it was at Inverness, and never happened, see Birnam and Cawdor.) There are impressive extensive gardens. Castle/gardens: adult £17.50/8.50, senior or student £15/8.50, child 5-16 £11/6, family £60/25.   (updated Nov 2020)

Aberlemno #2 Pictish Stone
56.653-2.8468 Restenneth Priory is a ruin two miles northeast of Forfar, follow B9113. There was a church here from Pictish times, but what you see now is from the 12th century when it became an Augustinian outpost of Jedburgh Abbey. You're free to stroll round it any time.
56.689306-2.7813069 Aberlemno Sculptured Stones, Aberlemno. These are richly carved standing stones with Pictish symbols from early medieval times, perhaps 9th century. Four are in or near Aberlemno village churchyard: they're in their original outdoor positions but in winter are boxed in to prevent frost damage. The stone in the churchyard (#2) has a Celtic Cross and a battle scene, which might involve Picts, Danes, Northumbrians or modern archaeologists arguing over its interpretation. Stone #4 is in the McManus Gallery in Dundee.   (updated Nov 2020)
56.697-2.82610 Finavon Castle refers both to the 19th C mansion, and the ruined 17th-century L-plan tower house in the woods behind. It's privately owned and you'll have to be content with a glimpse as the A90 sweeps past, though they rent out an apartment within the mansion and have game-fishing on the River South Esk. The 16th-century Doocot has 2400 pigeonholes and is managed by NTS but seldom open to visit. On the hill to the southeast towards Aberlemno was an Iron Age fort, but there's just shrubs to see now.

Eat[edit]
A Forfar bridie
Forfar bridies are savoury meat pastries. They're triangular shortcrust pastries with crimped edges filled with minced steak, but not potato, so they're more substantial than (for instance) Cornish pasties. Two holes punched in the crust means it also contains minced onion, one hole means it's without. Elsewhere in Scotland the pastry may be flaky but Forfar always bakes with shortcrust pastry.

Distilleries: Glamis has two. Gin Bothy in the village offers tours Th-Su 11AM-5PM. Ogilvy Spirits a couple of miles south makes potato vodka, no tours.
Cows drink free: The pawky legend goes that a townsman left a tub of beer at his doorway, and a passing cow drank it. He tried to bill the cow's owner, but the magistrate ruled that a drink taken standing at the doorway was deoch an doras, a stirrup cup or farewell drink, a gesture of hospitality for which no Scot would ever expect payment. The ruling is not binding upon other courts so don't push your luck at pub closing time.
