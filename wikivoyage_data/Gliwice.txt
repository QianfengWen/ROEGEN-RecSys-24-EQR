Gliwice is a city in the Silesian Voivodeship of southern Poland, with a population of 175,102 in 2021. It's part of Metropolis GZM centred on Katowice and is industrial. Nevertheless it has a well-restored old town and many historical sights.  


Understand[edit]
The Slav particle gliw indicates a soggy bog, and the medieval town channeled its river to form a defensive moat. But the terrain can't have been too quaggy, as Gliwice lay on a trading route. Early industries were brewing and textiles, but the boom came in the 19th century with mining, steel-making and metal-bashing trades. The town was in a borderland and changed nationalities several times - for much of the last 200 years it was Gleiwitz in Prussia or Germany, and in a post-World War I referendum it voted to remain in Germany along with Zabrze and Bytom, while Katowice joined Poland. Community tensions festered, and Germany had ambitions to seize further territory. In August 1939 came the spark that ignited World War II, when Germany faked a Polish attack on the radio station as a pretext for invading. Being already in Germany in no way spared Gliwice from the horrors unleashed on invaded territories. Post-war Silesia was handed back to Poland; the town no longer makes steel but has large automobile and machine engineering sectors.

By plane[edit]
Katowice Airport (KTW IATA) is usually the most convenient, with budget flights across Europe. Bus M14 runs hourly direct from the airport to Gliwice, otherwise take the bus into Katowice and change.
Kraków John Paul II Airport (KRK IATA) has more flights but involves a longer transfer, changing in Kraków city centre and Katowice. 

By train[edit]
Trains from Katowice run every 20 minutes and take 30 min via Chorzów and Zabrze. These may start from Częstochowa, Dąbrowa Górnicza, or all the way from Przemyśl on the Ukraine border via Kraków. 
Trains from Wrocław run hourly and take two hours via Opole; one per day is direct from Berlin. Change at Katowice for Warsaw and other long-distance destinations.
50.300618.67661 Gliwice Railway Station is at the northwest edge of city centre. It's clean and modern.

By bus[edit]
Flixbus runs four times a day from Berlin, taking 7 hours via Berlin Airport (BER IATA), Wrocław, Brzeg and Opole, and heading for Katowice and Kraków.
They run one or twice a day from Vienna and Brno via Olomouc and Ostrava, and once from Prague, heading for Katowice and Kraków.
Gliwice bus station is Centrum Przesiadkowe just north of the railway station, and it too is clean and modern. The old site south of the railway station is still shown on some maps but has been demolished.

Get around[edit]
The central area is compact; further out, buses ply all the main streets. ZTM Metropolia run almost all buses and trams across the 40-some cities of Upper Silesian Metropolis, which straddles the Czech border. They have a unified ticket system: see Katowice#Get around for ticket options and where to buy them.

Erected in 1934, it was the target of the "false flag" attack of 31 Aug 1939, the pretext for Germany to invade Poland. The SS dressed in Polish uniforms, stormed the transmitter and broadcast an anti-German message. Next morning German radio barked that Poland was invading but Seit 5 Uhr 45 wird jetzt zurückgeschossen! - "Since 05:45 we are returning fire!".
