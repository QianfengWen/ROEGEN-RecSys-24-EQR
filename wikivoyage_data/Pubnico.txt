Pubnico was founded in 1653 by Philippe Mius d’Entremont. It is the oldest Acadian community still inhabited mainly by Acadians; most of today's residents are descendants of the founder. The name is derived from the Mi'kmaq (Aboriginal) pogomkook of uncertain meaning.  
Pubnico comprises three sections: 

West Pubnico, whose people are almost all French-speaking,
Pubnico, better known as Pubnico Head, whose people are mostly all English-speaking, and
East Pubnico, the part where the barony is believed to have been located, being occupied by English-speaking people
The rest, up to the Shelburne county line, is occupied mostly by French-speaking people.
Pubnico Point Wind Farm, the first wind farm in Nova Scotia, has 17 1.8-MW Vestas V-80 turbines with a generating capacity of 30.6 MW. Commissioned in 2005 and purchased by NextEra Energy Canada in 2008, the wind farm has one of the largest in generating capacities in the province.
