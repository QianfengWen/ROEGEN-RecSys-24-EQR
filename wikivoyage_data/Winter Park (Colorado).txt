Winter Park, Colorado, is a ski resort in the Front Range.  It has many pastimes for both summer and winter visitors.  There are several places that close during the spring and fall, however.


Get in[edit]
Winter Park is a little over 65 miles from Denver, and is one of the closest ski resorts from Denver. The route is I-70 West most of the way, with the remainder on U.S. Route 40 West, which goes over Berthoud Pass. Be sure to check [1] for current conditions on Berthoud Pass, as it's common for it to be snowing (sometimes heavily) on the pass with no snow in Denver or on the way up I-70.
Powderhound Transportation provides shuttle service from Denver International Airport to Winter Park, and the town has an adequate free shuttle between Winter Park Resort, the town of Winter Park, and the town of Fraser.

By train[edit]
39.887558-105.7630391 Winter Park Resort Station. For over sixty years, the train going from Denver Union Station to Winter Park was an institution and something of a rite of passage for skiers in the area. It was cancelled in 2009, but will be back for the 2017 winter season. Departures are once every Saturday and Sunday morning with the return in the evening. See Amtrak's page on this service [formerly dead link]  for more information. As Denver international airport is connected to Union station by light rail, you can fly into Denver, take the train to the ski area and never once have to use a car. 
By bus[edit]
