It is in an old building, some parts with exposed wooden beams and plasterwork, others more recent and probably dating from the 19th-century parts. The rooms are embedded in this old building as best as possible but fitting in the modern amenities has sometimes been difficult. It is well appointed but the quality of the fittings is variable. Considering the price, the rooms are pleasant but not large. There are few amenities other than the rooms and the breakfast room. There is free wireless broadband. The breakfast arrangements are a little eccentric with wobbly tables supporting a vat of boiling water in which you can freshly boil your own eggs or on which you can squeeze your own fresh orange juice using a (noisy) electric juicing machine as you prepare to enjoy the boiled eggs, continental breakfast or cereals. €145-170.
