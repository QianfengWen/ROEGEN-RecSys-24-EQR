Established in 1884, Jacksonville Beach has developed for over a century. The unique culture, history and traditions make this destination more than just your average beach stay. Celebrations like the Opening of the Beaches are deeply rooted in the city at large. Composed of an assortment of architectural styles giving the community a strong sense of place and an identity all its own.


Understand[edit]
The founding of what is now Jacksonville Beach took place in the 1880s in the lead-up to the tourist boom Florida would experience going into the 20th century. Permanent settlement began around 1885 and a highway was begun in 1892. A railway was built in the area around the time of the Spanish-American War, during which William J. Bryan used the beach for training of Nebraska's Third Regiment. The town was known as Pablo Beach from incorporation in 1907 until 1925, when it became Jacksonville Beach. During the early 20th century it was an important amusement park destination, with Little Coney Island being in operation during the early part of the century and a roller coaster in the mid-century.
The cities in its immediate (coastal) vicinity — including Ponte Vedra Beach and Neptune Beach — are part of the broader Jacksonville area, and Jacksonville Beach residents vote in elections for the mayor of Jacksonville. The beach town's population was 21,000 in 2010.

Get in[edit]
