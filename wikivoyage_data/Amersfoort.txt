Amersfoort is a medieval city to the east of Amsterdam and Utrecht. It is at the edge of their commuting area. The city centre (the medieval city) is full of historic buildings and streets, and there is accessible forest into the west and south. The city of Amersfoort (municipality) has about 148,000 inhabitants, the urban region about 285,000.
Amersfoort is located in the province of Utrecht in the Netherlands, bordering on the province of Gelderland.

The old town of Amersfoort
Geography and history[edit]
Amersfoort takes its name from a ford (voorde) in the Eem river, which was once called the 'Emer' or 'Amer', at the edge of higher ground, the Utrecht ridge. The ford is on the shortest route across low marshy ground, from the ridge to the nearest higher ground on the east. As a result, Amersfoort was, and still is, on the main road from the western Netherlands to northern Germany, and the later Amsterdam - Berlin railway followed this route. The low-lying area between the Utrecht and Veluwe ridges is called the Valley of Gelderland, Gelderse Vallei, and it is now a zone of intensive farming.
The first written record of the settlement was in 1028. In the 12th century the Bishopric of Utrecht fortified it (because of its strategic location), and in 1259 granted it city rights. The first city wall of stone was built in the late 13th century.
Around 1380 a new wall was built: some of the city gates still survive. The city was a late medieval pilgrimage centre, and in 1444 began the construction of a cathedral. Most of it was destroyed in an explosion in 1787, but the tower survives, one of the highest church towers in the Netherlands. The 98 meter late-medieval eye-catcher is called Onze Lieve Vrouwentoren. Because of its visibility, it was the starting point for the accurate triangulation of the country, and it is still the true origin of the Dutch national grid (coordinates 463.000, 155.000).
Amersfoort's medieval industries were cloth and beer: in the 18th century it prospered due to the locally-grown tobacco. The railway began the modern expansion. Growth has accelerated, with suburban expansion mainly to the north. During its medieval heyday Amersfoort was a popular place of pilgrimage and an important city in the brewing industry. The oldest of Amersfoorts bars, In Den Grooten Slock, still stands today. The historic brewery, De Drie Ringen, brews excellent beers and is open to the public (from F-Su 13:00-17:00).
The central location allowed Amersfoort to become a major railway hub in the late 19th century. This also increased its strategic importance and up until 1980 it was one of the biggest garrison towns of the Netherlands. The military presence is still visible in the army bases (the Bernhardkazerne is still active and housing the Cavalry museum), nearby training grounds, and former airforce base Soesterberg.

A 17th-century nobleman and poet persuaded 400 inhabitants to drag the 7156 kg stone to Amersfoort, for beer, just to show they would do something useless. The incident made the city the butt of jokes, and it buried the stone for centuries, out of shame. In 1903 the city felt sufficiently rehabilitated to dig it up again, and it became its symbol. In fact, the city started to collect boulders, gifts from other cities: they are displayed on the inner ring road, along the line of the old city wall. 
52.1566675.3902789 Sint Joriskerk (Church of Saint George). The largest church, on the main square, Hof, with the old Town Hall. In 2011 a complete restoration of the interior of the St Joris church was finished.

Cycling around Amersfoort[edit]
There are several signposted cycle routes around Amersfoort. Shorter circular routes are signposted in one direction, taking several hours: follow the route signs (usually hexagonal). The Eemland Route starts in Amersfoort. The Nieuwe Vuursche Route passes the western edge of the city. The much longer Eneco Veluwe Route passes the eastern edge, and the nearby village of Hoevelaken. The route is 265 km long, not counting three short-cuts and two diversions. Another long route, Rondje Utrecht, a circle around the Province of Utrecht, passes the city centre.
The LF9 is a long cross-country route, signposted in both directions. It starts in Breda, near the Belgian border, and follows approximately the 0 metre contour. In principle, everything west of this line would disappear under sea water, if there were no artificial barriers. It runs through Utrecht, and after Amersfoort follows the old coastline to Zwolle, and goes through Groningen to the German border (325 km).
However, you don't need to follow a route: most of the surrounding region is suitable for cycling. The most interesting routes are east and north-east to the Veluwe forests about 20 km away, east and south to the forest at the edge of the city, north along the river Eem and toward the former coastline, and south-east along the Gelderse Vallei toward Wageningen.
