Sagunto (Valencian: Sagunt) is a city of 66,000 people (2018) in Valencia (province). It is best known for the remains of the ancient Iberian and Roman city of Saguntum, which played a significant part in the Second Punic War between the Carthaginians and the Romans.


Understand[edit]
Portalet de la Sang, the main entrance to the Jueria
Modern Sagunto is divided into two sections: the modern port with good beaches, and the historic centre, near the original Iberian hilltop fortifications.
The original town was established in the 5th century BCE by the Celtiberians, and eventually developed strong trade relations with nearby Greek and Phoenician colonies. In 219 BCE the city sided with the Roman Empire against the Carthaginians and was subjected to the eight-month 'Siege of Saguntum', resulting in Hannibal's capture of the town and becoming Rome's casus belli for the Second Punic War. Later the city fell under Roman, then Visigothic, and later Moorish control before finally being conquered by Jaime I of Aragon in the early 13th century. Modern visitors can appreciate remains from each of these periods.
In the early 20th century the port area saw a large population growth due to manufacturing and the steel industry. For visitors the draw here is the excellent beaches.
