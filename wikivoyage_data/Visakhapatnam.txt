Rock-cut Buddha Statue at Bojjannakonda near Anakapalle
Visakhapatnam, popularly known as Vizag, is the largest city in Andhra Pradesh. It is primarily an industrial city, but also attracts tourists due to its unspoilt sandy beaches, well built and maintained parks, Buddhist Remnant sites and nearby scenic areas, such as Araku Valley. The city has a population of about 2 million.


Understand[edit]
VMRDA Park
Vizag is sometimes called The Goa of the East. Just like its west coast counterpart, it has beautiful virgin beaches, laterite hillocks, smooth roads and stunning landscape. Health-tourism is a fast developing industry. Visakhapatnam is variously called Jewel on the Coromandel Coast, Steel City, and the City of Destiny.

Talk[edit]
The local language is Telugu. There is considerable concentration of Marwaris, Odias, Bengalis, Punjabis, Tamils and Malayalis. In addition, there is a large population of  migrant workers from other parts of India who have been drawn to the area by the abundance of work at locally based companies, such as Vizag Steel Plant and Hindustan Shipyard.

By bus[edit]
Visakhapatnam has no commuter rail service. However, APSRTC operates a lit of buses from 6 principal bus complexes in the city. They are:

Simhachalam
Gajuwaka
Maddilapalem
Visakha Steel City
Waltair
Madhurawada
Dwarka Bus Station or RTC Complex depot is the largest bus station and complex in the city.
There are mainly two types of buses operated for suburban travel in Visakhapatnam.

City Ordinary: can be identified by its orange or red colour. It is operated on almost all suburban routes. Some of the main routes include RTC Complex- Gajuwaka(via NAD), Maddilapalem- Railway Station, RTC Complex- Gajuwaka ( via Scindia), Railway Station- Madhurawada, etc. These buses stop at almost every bus stop. The frequency is more than that of Metro Express buses. These buses sometimes become overcrowded during peak hours on weekdays. Some popular route numbers include 222, 400, 99, 25, 900, 60C, 300, 6A, 28, 38 and 12D.
Metro Express: can be identified by their blue and white colour. These buses run in most important routes such as 400, 211, 500, 99, 28, 38 etc. These buses don't stop at all bus stops and the fare for these buses is also a bit higher than that for city ordinary buses.Many of these buses are JNNURM funded and sport digital display boards which display route number and route details in both English and Telugu. Also most of these have cushioned seats which are comfortable and many of them also have air-suspension which makes the journey more comfortable. These buses don't get as crowded as City Ordinary buses.
The junction and Maddilapalem joins the Asilametta-Ramatalkies road to the National Highway 5. Buses from Madilapalem ply to the extreme ends of the city, including Anakapalle and Thagarapuvalasa.

Visakha Museum the Maritime Wing
Fares[edit]
The bus fare to get to Madilapalem from the railway station is only ₹8. Buses operate within a 5 minute frequency in routes with high demand. The minimum frequency in which buses operate is 40 minutes, i.e., every route is covered by an APSRTC bus once in every 40 minutes. The current list of destinations covered by the buses and their route numbers are available at Wikipedia.
Apart from buying tickets on the bus, you may also avail an RTC-Pass, which is a special type of pass that can be renewed once in a month. With the pass, you can board any APSRTC bus and travel anywhere within the city limits. An ordinary RTC-Pass costs just ₹750 which is around 13 dollars and in USD. The RTC complex is to the southeast of Asilametta. RTC complex is generally referred to as complex and is connected to every other region in the city. Apart from the bus, taxi/autorikshaw can also be hired. The autorikshaw is a mini taxi which is much more cheaper, but less convenient.

Buddhist sites[edit]
Bavikonda Stupas
Maha Stupa at Thotlakonda Monastic Complex
Bojjannakonda, Thotlakonda and Bhavikonda in and around Visakhapatnam were centres of Buddhism during the second century CE. Several Buddhist monuments such as stupas and chaityas were erected at these places. It is said that some of the corporal relics of the Buddha were preserved at these places. Hence all these places became sacred places.

17.7183.01613 Bojjannakonda. It offers architectural remnants of the Buddhist period, one of the earliest of its class in Southern India. It constitutes one of the most remarkable groups of Buddhist monuments dated from 200 BCE to 700 CE, found during excavations in 1906. On the eastern hill, there are a series of rock-cut caves, numerous groups of monolithic dagobas, standing on rock platform in tiers above each other and, crowning all, a rock-cut stupa with extensive structural remains. On the western side of the eastern hill is a stairway, partly rock-cut and partly structural, which leads up to a large double-storied cave. The cave is entered by a doorway and is flanked on each side by huge dwarapalas. The cave chamber is rectangular in shape and is divided into 20 compartments by four cross rocks of 16 massive pillars. In the centre is the rock-cut stupa standing on a square platform..

Ropeway car at Kailasagiri
Kambalakonda Sanctuary

There is a park atop the hill, with a beautiful view of the city, the sea and Eastern Ghats merging into the sea. Sagarnagar Beach and Rushikonda Beach are on the right and left hand sides. There is a huge sculpture of Shiva and Parvati. One can take a ropeway directly facing sea and city. On the hill top there is a beautiful toy train offering a tour of nature. Several view points give a pleasant look of the nature, especially in the evening, when the city is lit up. This is less commercial than other hill stations and there is less hassle by tourist guides. After descending from Kailasagiri one should visit Tenneti Beach Park. Its beauty and luxuriant carpet grass intertwined with concrete pathways makes it ideal for romantic couples. There are several points from which the beautiful rocky beach down beneath can be seen. This provides spectacular views of sunrise, sunset and the pristine waters. Many movies were shot here. Hillocks in the park which are about 50 ft (15 m) in elevation give a beautiful view of the sea, beach road and the beach park.

Beach View from Tenneti Park, Vizag
Rushikonda beach view
More than anything else, Vizag is known for its beaches. It boasts a number of beaches that are scenic and uncrowded. A few virgin beaches span along the eastern side of the city and stretch for miles. A spectacular beach only the locals are aware of is called the "Yarada" beach. Except for the occasional RTC bus, there is no public transport available. Still, the adventurous mind finds it rewarding if they can make an effort to get there. It's a private beach coming under Agrigold plantations therefore you need to pay a fee of ₹30/- to get onto the beach, but it's worth it.
The beaches are lovely, but, there are water sporting activities which started out initially like marine rafting and scuba diving, there are few beach cafes and restaurants. A water sports centre was started in Rushikonda. Vizagites are traditionally quite conservative and though the beaches and the hills are beautiful, but there is much here to interest the average tourist.
Must want is the sunrise or a moonrise on a full moon day at Tennati Park(near foot of Rope way) on the Vizag-Bhimili Beach Road it's truly a feast to the nature lovers. The sea looks orange in colour and is a wonderful sight.

17.8904683.455461 Bhimili (Bheemili Beach). About 25 km from the city and is what used to be a small village also called Bheemunipatnam. Apart from the beach, the village has the remains of a Portuguese church, Dutch cemeteries and a Buddhist Monastery (Pavurallakonda) .
17.7141683.323662 Ramakrishna Beach. R.K.Beach is the most popular beach in the sense that, you can find the locals hanging out during the hot summers, and relatively less hot winters. On weekends and holidays, one can see that the entire beach comes alive, but not in a western sense where people take a plunge in the water, or surf. You can see people dressed in their best clothes, just sitting on the benches, or walking along. Caution: a lot of people have died while swimming due to the presence of dangerous "Rip currents". Take an evening stroll at RK Beach; it offers good pedestrian tracks, beautiful parks, museums, beaches and some wonderful open air restaurants. (updated Oct 2021)
17.7825783.383673 Rushikonda (Rushikonda Beach). 11 km away from the city, this has become a popular tourist spot that even the locals frequent. A lot safer to wade into than the R.K. Beach, cradled among hills, this used to be an excellent beach away from the madding crowds. AP Tourism Development Corporation has a beach resort (Punnami) on the hillside overlooking the beach. Caution: A lot of people have died while swimming/playing at this beach due to rip currents. This beach gained "Blue Flag" certification status in 2020.   
17.6541383.26714 Yarada Beach. It is perceived as a private beach but actually it is not. Tourists can visit the beach directly or through the Yarada village. Yarada is the village behind the dolphin nose. To go to this beach, bus facility is available from Scindia junction. Also you can hire a cab to go there. The view of the beach and Vizag city from the top of the Dolphin's nose is memorable. The drive from Scindia to the top of dolphin nose, dolphin nose to Yarada is really enjoyable. (updated Oct 2021)
