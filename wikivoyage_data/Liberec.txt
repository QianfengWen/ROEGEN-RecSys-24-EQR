Go next[edit]
Jizera Mountains
Jizera Mountains (Jizerské hory) are a true island of Scandinavian nature in central Europe. The central plateau with endless forests is ideal for hiking and cycling in summer or cross-country skiing in winter. Crowds of tourists head there and the nature park authority issues too many car entry permits, but you can find a lot of quiet, deserted places where only spruces, beeches and long grass whisper between rocks and boulders. Good start points to Jizera mountains are:
Bedřichov, easily reached by bus from Liberec, but also full of tourists
Josefův Důl and Kořenov train stations
Harrachov train station, ideal for exploring the Polish part of Jizera mountains
Lusatian Mountains (Lužické hory) are lower than Jizera mountains but also less touristy and surely worth to visit. Military enthusiasts will be interested in remnants of interwar Czechoslovak fortification system with a lot of deserted concrete bunkers. Good start points are Rynoltice, Lvová and Jablonné v Podještědí (train stops) or Jitrava (bus stop).
Ralsko is a center of former military area, formed by vast plains with pine forests, quiet ponds, sandstone rocks and mysterious dilapidated military structures. Take a bus to Stráž pod Ralskem and get off in Osečná or Hamr na Jezeře.
