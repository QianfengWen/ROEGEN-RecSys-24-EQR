Bishop's Palace on Városháza square
Székesfehérvár is the largest city and the county seat of Fejér county, Hungary. It's roughly 60 km southwest of Budapest, and is considered Hungary's first, as this was the royal seat of King Szent István (also known as Saint Stephan). Though most of the medieval city was destroyed by the Turks, it was rebuilt to glory under Maria Theresa Habsburg. The city is between Lake Velence and Lake Balaton, making it an ideal stop-off between the two.
Places outside of the city that are in the district of the same namexare listed in the and Székesfehérvár district article.


Understand[edit]
Székesfehérvár (Latin Alba Regia) is one of the most ancient towns in Hungary.
During his principality (972 - 997) Géza, the Grand Duke, established Székesfehérvár as his princely dwelling on the hills surrounded by swamps and therefore considered safe. His palace was fortified by ditches and ramparts, and the Byzantine-style, quatrefoil church, which was one of the first Hungarian stone built churches and later served as his resting-place.
During the reign of King St Stephen (1001 -1038) it was a populous and extended settlement, surrounded by palings and walls built of soil. King Stephen's basilica was built in this time. It was one of the most monumental buildings in Europe at that time.
In the 12th century there were great building operations in Székesfehérvár. The monks settling in the city and the inhabitants enriched Alba Regia by building pompous churches, monasteries, and dwelling houses. The construction of Saint Peter's cathedral - next to Saint Peter's church, built under the principality of Géza - was started in the 13th century. King Béla IV was crowned in this cathedral. The city was fenced with walls in the 14th century.
The Turks occupied the strategically important town in 1543 and kept it under their rule for 145 years.
In 1703 the city regained its title as a free royal city. In the 1720s major construction were started: first the Franciscans then the Carmelites built churches, and under the rule of Maria Theresa there were Baroque-, rococo-, and so called copf-style town-houses built.
In 1800s the first Hungarian and German primary school opened its gates, the education was started at the Jesuits' secondary school, and this town was the first to embrace the cause of the Hungarian theatrical art.
In 2014, it was home to 98,000 people.

(the ruins can be seen in the middle of Székesfehérvár), ☏ +36 22 315583. A national memorial on Koronázó tér, just east of the main square. In the middle ages this was the site of Hungary's most important church and had it not been for the Turks blowing it up. Here is the ruins of the main church of the medieval Hungary, Here stand the basilica dedicated to the Virgin Mary, it would be to Hungary what Westminster Abbey is to England. The church was begun in 1016 under Hungary's first Christian king, Szent István. At the time, Székesfehérvár was the capital of the kingdom, and this church was the site of numerous coronations. In addition, from 1038 to 1543 fifteen Hungarian kings were put to eternal rest here (starting with Szent István himself and ending with Szapolyai János). As already mentioned, the church was destroyed by the Turks in 1601 and in 1800 the remains were used to build the Bishops Palace on nearby Városház square. Today all that remains of the once great basilica are stone walls outlining its form. The big draw, however, is to visit the mausoleum containing Szent István's sarchaphogus. This was discovered in 1803 during the building of the Bishop's Palace. The cherubic forms on the outside and royal relics contained within clearly identified this as the tomb of Szent István. The sarchaphogus originally was taken to the National Museum in Budapest, but was brought back to Székesfehérvár in 1936, and since then has remained in the attractive mausoleum at the entrance of the garden.
