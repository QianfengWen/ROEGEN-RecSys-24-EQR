Vashon Island or Vashon-Maury Island is an island near Seattle in the Puget Sound region, the largest island in Puget Sound south of Admiralty Inlet. There are no bridges to connect the island with the mainland, a big factor contributing to the island's relative isolation and rural character.

Get around[edit]
By car[edit]
Most people experience the island by car with the Vashon Hwy SW being the main north south travel route through the island, however don't be afraid to get off this road and experience the less traveled side roads, especially roads that offer views of the water.
Vashon Island's street designation is a continuation of King County's street designation system from West Seattle (SW), beginning at 1st Ave S & Yesler in downtown Seattle. The major roads are somewhat in a grid, with north-south roads called Avenues that suffix the directional and east-west roads being Streets that prefix the directional. There are occasional irregularities: Ways are long roads that don't always conform to the grid, Drives are long, circuitous routes, and there are the very short Place or Court that dead ends on one end of the road. Most roads are numbered with a few that are named. The "downtown core" for banking, shopping, eating and for bars on Vashon Island is clustered around the intersection of SW Bank Rd & Vashon Hwy SW (main north-south thoroughfare through the island).
Vashon Island lies approximately between SW 108th St (10800 block) and SW 307th St (30700 block, next to Tahlequah Ferry Terminal) southwest of downtown Seattle (Yesler), which run east and west. The east shores of the island are approximately 8700 block (87th Ave SW) west of 1st Ave S while the west shores of the island are approximately at the 14700 block (147th SW) from 1st Ave S. Vashon Hwy SW goes north and south as a major thoroughfare or main street through the island. Therefore, the house numbers increase from east to west and from north to south.

By bike[edit]
Although Vashon is popular with bicyclists, the hills can be intimidating for inexperienced riders and the sometimes tight roads make sharing the road a challenge.  The Vashon Highway has ample space for bikers along its shoulder however due to the large amounts of car traffic this might be less desirable for some bikers.
