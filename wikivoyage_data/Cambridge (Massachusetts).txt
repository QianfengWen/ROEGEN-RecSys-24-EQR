Not to be confused with Cambridge, England.

Cambridge is a city in Massachusetts, across the Charles River from Boston. It is renowned as the home of Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), both widely considered to be among the best universities in the world. The city's population was 118,000 in 2020; the fourth largest in the state.


Understand[edit]
Tourists, new residents and students may see Cambridge as part of Boston, but in fact, it is a separate city with many neighborhoods (called “squares”).
It is closely connected with nearby Somerville –  you may hear the phrase "Camberville" used by locals –  although each has its own distinct personality.

History[edit]
Early October foliage begins to change color in Harvard Yard
The first European settlers were English Puritans in 1630. Cambridge developed as an agricultural town and was not really convenient to Boston until bridges were built over the Charles River in 1793 and 1809. The latter of these opened up East Cambridge for industrial development led by furniture and glass factories. A major influx of penniless Irish immigrants fleeing the potato blight in 1845 increased the Irish population to 22 percent in the next ten years. Toward the end of that century they were followed by immigrants from Italy, Poland, Portugal, and Germany. French Canadians and Russian Jews also came at this time. A small African American population had been growing from colonial times, attracted by the integrated schools. Harvard University, the oldest university in the United States, and one of the most prestigious universities in the world, was founded during the colonial era in 1636.
The result today is a highly diverse population augmented and further diversified by brilliant men and women drawn to Cambridge over the years by Harvard, Radcliffe and MIT, and later by the local high technology companies. "Cantabrigians" (from the city's Latin name, Cantabrigia) are regarded as progressive and tolerant. Decline of the industrial base in the early 1900s led Cambridge to become an intellectual center. Universities are the major employers, but cutting edge companies in information technology and biotechnology such as Akamai Technologies, Google, Genzyme, Biogen Idec, and Novartis are located adjacent to the MIT campus in the Kendall Square area.
Cambridge now advertises itself as "a city where counter-culture still lives, classic culture thrives, and multicultural is a way of life." "Boston's Left Bank: A little funkier, a little spunkier and definitely spicier than Boston."

By train[edit]
Popping up into the hustle and bustle from Central Square station
Amtrak train service is available to nearby Boston from many east coast cities as well as Chicago and upstate New York.
Mass Bay Transportation Authority - MBTA or "the T":

Subway: The Red Line stops from Kendall/MIT station to Alewife station (except Davis Square, in Somerville) are in Cambridge. The Green Line has a terminus at Lechmere station, near Lechmere Square in East Cambridge.
Commuter rail: The Fitchburg line has a stop at Porter Square. This line serves the northwestern suburbs and ends in Boston's North Station, where you can connect to other northbound commuter rail lines.
By car[edit]
Interstate 90 to Exit 18, or Interstate 93 to Exit 27, "Storrow Drive" to Monsignor O'Brien Highway (Rt. 28) to Cambridge.
Route 2 comes into Cambridge from Interstate 95 to the northwest.
Cambridge has a great many one-way streets and most streets and roads are not on a grid system. Drivers unfamiliar with the area are well advised to have a GPS device as one wrong turn can easily result in getting lost.

By bus[edit]
The MBTA has local regional bus service. For intercity buses, see Boston.

By public transportation[edit]
See also: Boston#By public transit
Public transportation is provided by the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority ("MBTA"), which  serves the entire Boston Metro area (including Cambridge.) The local subway system is called the "T" and can take you to most points of interest. The T's Red Line has Cambridge stations in Kendall Square, Central Square, Harvard Square, and Porter Square. The Green Line has one station in Cambridge: Lechmere.
Directions are often marked "inbound" and "outbound", with reference to downtown Boston, where all four lines converge at four stops: State (Blue and Orange), Park Street (Red and Green), Government Center (Blue and Green), and Downtown Crossing (Orange and Red).
The MBTA does not operate 24-hour service.  Service begins for the day after 5:30AM and ends before 12:15AM on weekdays.  Weekend schedules are slightly different and do not open until 6:30AM on Sundays.  Transport still runs for a short time after this — stated times are "first train leaves the station" or "last train leaves the station" — and thus, to complete the route, will actually be in service for as much as an hour longer or an hour before, but it is imperative to find out when last service is scheduled to the stations you need, and allot time for early or late arrivals.
MBTA employees can offer information on scheduling, but are not always available at all stations.  Communication between stations is complex and while significant changes will be announced, often T employees themselves are not informed of delays or minor changes.  Bus stations that are not also subway stations are unstaffed.
Subway fare is $2.40 and includes transfers between all four subway lines (Red, Green, Orange and Blue) and bus fare varies between $1.70 (local bus) and $5.25 (outer express bus; none in Cambridge) and also includes transfers.  Fares are paid via a stored value ticket (called a CharlieTicket) available in vending machines at subway stations.  Fare is $2.40 subway, if using the freely available reusable plastic pass (the CharlieCard), which can be obtained at Harvard Square station, 7-11 convenience stores or Star supermarkets.
Information on fares, routes, delays and schedule changes is available at the MBTA's web site.

Parking at the Alewife station on the Red line is ample and costs $8 per 24 hour period.
MBTA Commuter Rail (color-coded purple) leaves from Porter Square, serving one of the twelve commuter rail lines. This should not be confused with
Amtrak, the US national rail service, departs from South Station, Back Bay Station, and North Station, all of which are in Boston.
By taxi[edit]
A taxi trip of a mile or less costs $5, excluding tip.  Most of the major tourist areas will be a $10–25 fare.  A trip to Logan Airport can cost up to $55, including tip, tolls and any waiting time.  Flat rates are set for trips to Logan Airport from each hotel in Cambridge, which include all but luggage handling and gratuity.
Taxis are abundant in Harvard Square and Central Square, with many being queued up waiting for fares.  The places that they will queue are designated as cab stands by street signs.  Taxis are less abundant in Porter Square and rare near Alewife and Lechmere.
It is possible to signal a taxi from the sidewalk by waving an arm or a hand — a taxi cruising for fares is watching the crowds for this — and have it stop for you; however, taxi drivers from towns and cities other than Cambridge are heavily penalised if they accept passengers flagging them down on the street.  This rule is not always rigorously followed, but taxi drivers from Boston, Brookline, Somerville and other towns will be wary of street pick-ups.
Taxis are regulated by the Cambridge License Commission, which sets fares and handles complaints.
The two primary taxi companies in Cambridge are:

 Brattle Taxi, ☏ +1 617 492-1100. 
 Checker Cab, ☏ +1 617 497-1500. 
By bicycle[edit]
Cambridge is perhaps the most bicycle-friendly city in the Greater Boston area and probably has the most people who use bikes to commute and just to get around. While there are few bike routes, most major streets have bike lanes, and many minor streets do too. Car drivers tend to be aware of bike riders and generally respect bike riders' right of way. All of these features make Cambridge the safest place to ride a bike in Greater Boston.
Lock your bike when you park it! Bike thieves are skilled and quick. Be sure to lock your front wheel in addition to your frame, and your back wheel too if it is a quick-release.

42.37044-71.103522 Broadway Bicycle School, 351 Broadway, ☏ +1 617 868-3392. You can get your bike fixed, fix it yourself, or be taught how to repair it.

Washington made his headquarters here during the siege of Boston from July 1775 through April 1776. From 1837 until 1882, it was the home of poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow while he taught at Harvard. The site's collections deal mainly with Longfellow, but there are some Washington letters as well.   
42.370556-71.1458333 Mount Auburn Cemetery, 580 Mount Auburn St., ☏ +1 617 547-7105. Yes, it's a cemetery. It just happens to be the first landscaped cemetery and in fact the first large-scale designed landscape in the U.S. The tower provides visitors with a breathtaking panoramic view of the cities of Boston and Cambridge, as well as the surrounding countryside to the north. The fact that it's the final resting place of some of the area's most influential figures (Sumner, Gardner, Eddy, and Longfellow) cements its status as a National Historic Landmark. Free.   (updated Jun 2017)
42.3766-71.12224 Washington Elm (Cambridge Common at Mason St). 24 hours daily. On July 3, 1775, George Washington officially took command of the Continental Army at ceremonies taking place beneath this Elm tree, which stood at the edge of the training grounds used by the troops. While this tale may be a myth, clearly the tree has remained a symbol of patriotism in Cambridge for generations. The tree finally succumbed to old age and disease in 1923, and today a small bronze plaque marks this historical spot. Free.   (updated Dec 2016)

John Harvard Statue. Make sure to rub his foot for good luck!
42.37445-71.117246 Harvard Yard. The center and oldest part of the Harvard campus. An enclosed grassy yard including picturesque buildings dating as far back as 1720. The freshman undergraduate dorms are located in Harvard Yard, which means that a long list of famous intellectual and political figures have lived here. Near the center is a statue of John Harvard, for whom the university is named. Tour guides will tell you that students rub the statue's left foot for good luck before exams, and the foot is indeed rubbed shiny. But in reality, most of the rubbing is probably done by tourists rather than students.   
42.37163-71.117417 Harvard Lampoon building. Home of the Harvard Lampoon, a student humor publication. The west end of the building, fittingly, resembles a cartoonish face wearing a spiked helmet. The building was finished in 1909.   
42.35977-71.092238 MIT Great Dome. A monumental dome with an oculus at its center, similar to the Pantheon in Rome. Located in MIT Building 10 (most MIT buildings are referred to by numbers rather than names, as befits the university's technical orientation).

42.35698-71.0925410 Harvard Bridge. The bridge connecting Cambridge to Boston across the Charles river. Located at the edge of MIT, not Harvard University. It's well known in the nerdy folklore of MIT: the distance across the bridge is marked in "smoots" (1 smoot = 5 ft (1.5 m) 7 in (180 mm)) after Oliver Smoot, an MIT student who allowed himself to be laid end-to-end to measure the distance across the bridge, as part of a fraternity prank.

With a dizzying array of options, and slightly less stringent liquor laws, Cambridge is every bit as much a dining destination as Boston. Sometimes more so. Many restaurants cluster around Harvard and Central Squares, and finding standbys like Anna's Taqueria and Clover Food Lab is a piece of cake. If you're willing to stray a bit beyond the subway stops (and you should be), you'll quickly discover many less-travelled neighborhood gems. Consider this simply a brief overview of current trends and old standbys. By all means follow your instincts, just don't make any rash decisions due to an empty stomach!

Stay safe[edit]
The official Cambridge graffiti wall in a Central Square alley
Cambridge is generally very safe, though it is a city and the standard precautions should be observed. The neighborhood of East Cambridge, which is near the Charlestown border and on the Charles River, usually has the city's highest crime rate (of course, this observation is relative to the Cambridge's low crime rate overall).
As a rule, most crime in Cambridge that might affect a traveller is property crime.  Parked vehicles with electronic equipment visible — laptops, mobile phones, GPS units, iPods, and the like — are the most likely to be targeted.
Pepper spray is considered a weapon in Massachusetts, and is sold only by licensed dealers to persons who have obtained a firearms identification card.  Massachusetts does not honor firearms licenses from other states.
