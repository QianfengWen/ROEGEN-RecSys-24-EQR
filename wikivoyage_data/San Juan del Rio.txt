Puente de la Historia (History Bridge)
San Juan del Rio is a mid-size city in the southern part of Querétaro (state). It is the oldest colonial city in the state, positioned at a strategic river crossing that was part of the silver mining route, Camino Real de Tierra Adentro. The city is a ̪ UNESCO World Heritage Site and has been designated by the Mexican government as a Pueblo Magico in recognition of its touristic value. 


Understand[edit]
In pre-hispanic times, southern Queretaro was the domain of the Otomi people. The town of San Juan del Rio was established in 1531. The Franciscans soon built the first church, and in 1561, a bridge was built over the San Juan River, enabling the town's reputation as an important stop along the route between Mexico City and the northern interior lands. The bridge was rebuilt and expanded in 1621 and again in 1722. You can cross that bridge today by crossing the river on Avenida Benito Juarez. 
During the 17th and 18th centuries, the city expanded and a number of important churches, convents, schools, and hospitals were established (many by the Franciscans).
