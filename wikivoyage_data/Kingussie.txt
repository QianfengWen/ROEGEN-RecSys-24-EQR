Kingussie (pronounced "King-YOO-see") is a town in Speyside in the central Scottish Highlands, with a population of 1470 in 2020. The Spey valley here broadens into a "strath" as it emerges from the hills, and turns north. Its name is from Gaelic Ceann a' Ghiuthsaich, "head of the pine forest", as with an elevation of 817 ft (249 m) it's on the tree line. The main road and railway from the south here descend from Drumochter Pass into Spey valley.
Newtonmore is a smaller town (population 1120) two miles further upstream, also described here.

By road[edit]

Stagecoach Highland Bus 39 runs from Carrbridge via Aviemore to Kingussie and Newtonmore every two hours M-Sa. A couple continue to Dalwhinnie.

Get around[edit]
The town and Ruthven Barracks can easily be explored on foot, but you need wheels to visit the surrounding countryside.
The local taxi firm has folded, see Aviemore#Get around for cars based there.

See[edit]
Ruthven Barracks
57.081-4.05241 St Columba's Friary is just a grassy space along Mill St with some old grave markers. Founded before 1501, it was likely abandoned at the Dissolution but became the village church and graveyard some time in the late 18th or early 19th century, those moved to their present site further along High St. The modern cemetery is east of the interchange with A9 bypass, and holds 14 Commonwealth War Graves.
57.0721-4.03952 Ruthven Barracks, Kingussie PH21 1NS (off B970). 24 hours. This was built in 1719 over earlier castle ruins to quell any repetition of the Jacobite rebellion of 1715. But back they came in 1745: a first siege (the first set-to after the arrival of Bonnie Prince Charlie in Scotland) was easily rebuffed. They returned in 1746 in their retreat towards Culloden, this time with heavy artillery so the garrison surrendered. After their defeat at Culloden the Jacobites tried to re-group here, but the Prince ordered his troops to disperse and save themselves, so they wrecked the place and scarpered. The Hanoverian government reinforced other forts in the aftermath but abandoned this one, so it remains a ruin. Free.   (updated Aug 2023)
