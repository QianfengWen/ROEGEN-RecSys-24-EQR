Alamosa is a small town in south central Colorado, USA.  It is noteworthy as the nearest significant town to Great Sand Dunes National Park, a similarly near neighbor of the eastern hub of a superb scenic railroad, and also because during the winter, it frequently records the lowest temperature of the day of any place in the contiguous United States.
