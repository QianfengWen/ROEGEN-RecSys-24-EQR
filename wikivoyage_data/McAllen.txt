McAllen, the City of Palms, is in the southern plains of Texas, USA.  It is the largest city in Hidalgo County and the second largest city in the Rio Grande Valley after Brownsville. It is near the Rio Grande River on the border with Mexico.


Understand[edit]
McAllen has grown rapidly over the past century. In 1910 the population was about 150. The city now has a population exceeding 130,000. Over 85% of the city's population is Hispanic or Latino; almost everyone is bilingual to some degree. The first real development in the area that would later become McAllen occurred in the 1850s.  That development was led by John McAllen.  In 1904, he established a town site then known as West McAllen.  In 1907, a separate group of developers established a town known as East McAllen.  Eventually, the two towns merged and the City of McAllen was incorporated in 1911.
McAllen has warm winter weather and a low cost of living. In the winter months, large numbers of retirees live in the McAllen area. Affectionately called Winter Texans, they come predominantly from the Midwestern United States and Canada and stay in RV parks, apartments, second homes and extended-stay hotels. Winter is the "season" for McAllen, and the time with most of the social activities, many planned especially for Winter Texans.
McAllen is a popular birders destination. There are dozens of birding spots in the McAllen area, including the World Birding Center, a complex of 9 sites dedicated to wildlife watching. 528 bird species and over 300 butterfly species have been recorded in the area.
McAllen is surrounded by several medium size towns and cities.  These cities are interconnected and sometimes appear to be one larger city.  For census purposes the federal government includes all these areas under the heading McAllen–Edinburg–Mission Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA).
