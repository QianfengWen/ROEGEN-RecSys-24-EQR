Methlick is a village in Aberdeenshire about 20 miles north of Aberdeen; its main attraction is Haddo House. Methlick derives from Gaelic Maothulach, which may mean "vale of honey". It's not a census district but its population is probably little changed from the 1851 count, of 1737.
Methlick is of one a handful of similarly-sized villages in a triangle of farmland between the coast and the cross-country route to Moray and Inverness, so they're all off the main track. These villages include Turriff, Fyvie, Tarves, Pitmedden and Oldmeldrum. The area lacks public transport, but has visitor facilities and a scattering of historic and prehistoric sights. The south tip of the triangle is commuterland for Aberdeen, where once-small villages grew in the late 20th century into the dormitory towns of Ellon and Inverurie.


Get in[edit]
Gight Castle: Byron's mother sold it to pay off Mad Jack's gambling debts
The facilities of communication are pretty good: there are commutation roads leading to New Deer, Fyvie, Ellon, Meldrum, and Tarves; and a mail-gig runs daily between Methlick and Aberdeen. - Topographical Dictionary of Scotland, 1851
The village is at the junction of B9005 from Ellon to Fyvie and B9170 from Inverurie to New Deer.
Stagecoach North Scotland Bus 290 / 291 runs from Aberdeen Union Square via Udny to Methlick, M-Sa every couple of hours, four buses Sunday, 75 min. A few of these continue, as Bus 292 to Ellon or as Bus 293 to Fyvie.
Bus 35 runs from Aberdeen via Dyce to Oldmeldrum, Fyvie, Turiff, Macduff,  Banff, Portsoy, Buckie, Cullen and Elgin. They're every 30 min M-Sa and hourly Sunday from Aberdeen to Banff, where alternate buses turn back. 
The nearest railway station is Inverurie, with trains every couple of hours on the Aberdeen-Inverness line, so bike-on-train would work.

In Georgian times it was owned by Catherine Gordon Byron, the mother of Lord Byron the poet, but she sold it in 1787 the year before his birth. She had to sell to pay off the gambling debts of Byron's father "Mad Jack", while she and her infant went to live in meagre lodgings in Aberdeen. Jack died aged 34 in Spain so the title "Lord Byron" bypassed him and went to the son. Gight's new owner was the 3rd Earl of Aberdeen then his son Lord Haddo who died aged 27 in 1791, whereupon the castle fell derelict.
