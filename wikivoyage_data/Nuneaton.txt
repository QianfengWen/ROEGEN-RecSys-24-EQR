Nuneaton is the largest town in Warwickshire, with a population in 2021 of 89,000. It was heavily bombed in the Second World War and rebuilt in typically unsympathetic post-war style. Its best-known landmark is Mount Judd (aka the "Nuneaton Nipple"), a 518-foot spoil heap.


Understand[edit]

"Eaton" means a settlement next to water, and the "nun" was added when a Benedictine nunnery was founded in the 12th century. In the 17th century, Nuneaton manufactured silk ribbons, and in the 19th century, it became a coal-mining town. That era was captured by George Eliot (penname of Mary Ann Evans, 1819 – 1880); born locally, her novels depict rural provincial life as it becomes challenged by the march of industry, and they refer to the town as "Milby".
