Mussoorie is a hill station in the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand.


Understand[edit]
View of the hills in Mussoorie towards sunset
With its green hills and varied flora and fauna, Mussoorie is a fascinating hill resort and a fabulous honeymoon spot. Commanding a wonderful view of extensive Himalayan snow ranges to the northeast and glittering views of the Doon Valley, Roorkee, Saharanpur and Haridwar to the South, the town presents a fairyland atmosphere to tourists. Its history dates back to 1827 when Captain Young, an adventurous military officer, explored the site and laid the foundation of this holiday resort. Mussoorie is famous for its scenic beauty and hectic social life.

Climate[edit]
At an altitude of over 2,000 m (6,600 ft), Mussoorie is a popular retreat from the heat of the plains. Be prepared for the cold if you come in the winter (Dec-Feb), when you can expect freezing weather and snow. The monsoon arrives in July and stays through to mid-September.

Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
Buses leave from Dehradun train station.  There are two buses which go to opposite ends of the Mussoorie Mall, Library and Picture Palace.  It is quite a hike from one to the other, so make sure you catch the right one.
To reach Kempty Falls directly from Dehra Dun catch a bus from the Dehra Dun Railway station Hill Bus Services Section or take a taxi. You should look for buses heading for destinations like Barkot, Nainbagh, Yamunotri, and Purola (Caution:sometimes Purola buses go via Vikas nagar which may take you off the route completely so be careful).
You can also take a bus to the Library end of Mussoorie and walk to the Kempty Bus stop and take a bus or taxi or a milkvan or even hitch a ride with a tourist going in that direction!! Bus fee for Library end or Kulri end (from Dehradun) is ₹47.
Toll Tax is payable on entering Kempty Village per bus/taxi/car/scooter. Bus fare from library end to Kempty is around ₹15.

By taxi[edit]
It is possible to hire a taxi for the trip up to Mussoorie.  Rates are ₹610 per taxi and ₹50 extra for the night charges but you can pay per seat as well in a shared taxi which normally accommodates up to five passengers. Shared or chartered taxis too are available near the same Hill Section Bus terminal and the rates are controlled by the taxi union. These rates are generally displayed on a board outside their office.
Mussoorie is just 38 km from Dehradun and you can reach here by taxis and buses. It takes approximately one and a half hour and ₹47 for the regular buses to reach Mussoorie. From the Dehradun railway station, taxis charge around ₹610. Shared taxis charging a little over ₹100 per person are also available.

Get around[edit]

Tourist enjoy a rickshaw ride on Mall Road
Once in Mussoorie, the affordable and effective way to get around the city is to opt for bus system or cycle rickshaws. Cycle rickshaws for traveling within city may cost approximately ₹20. However, it may get crowded, especially during peak hours. For most part you will want to get around on foot.  The Mall is closed to most vehicles.

By rickshaw[edit]
A relatively flat section of the Mall allows a fleet of rickshaws to ply their trade.  You can catch a ride from the Library end of the Mall to about the midpoint.
A full day of Mussoorie sightseeing by rickshaw is less costly compared to private cabs or taxis. But it is time consuming. So taxis are preferable if you are in a hurry and are prepared to pay the extra money.

By taxi[edit]
Taxis are not a useful form of transport within Mussoorie. If you are heading up to Landour with your luggage, it would be wise to catch a ride. They can also be hired for outings to places such as Kempty Falls or Happy Valley. There are taxi stands at both ends of the Mall. Many locals offer 'taxi' services, and if you are staying longer you will likely find these (slightly cheaper) alternatives. But all the taxis are under a union, so the rates will not vary and one has to hire them through the union office at library end, mall road, kempty bus stand etc.
You can also rent a private car which will be a little costly but less time-consuming. A complete day of sightseeing around the city by taxi including Dhanoltri and Kempty Falls costs more than ₹1800.
