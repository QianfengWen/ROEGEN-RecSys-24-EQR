Augusta Raurica is probably the best preserved Roman city North of the Alps. It is nestled inside the greater Basel urban area, in Switzerland and has been transformed into an open-air museum. In summer each year it houses Römerfest (the Roman festival), an educational and entertainment event which can be fun both for kids and grown-ups. It is located next (and partially within) the towns of Augst and Kaiseraugst.


Understand[edit]
Its extraordinary state of preservation is because, unlike most other town sites, once the Romans abandoned this site, no others built upon it - neither in the "Dark Ages", nor subsequently.

Get in[edit]
The nearby village of Kaiseraugst, which takes its name from the site, has a train station. Take S1 from Basel. The museum and the main sights are around 15 minutes walk away from the railway station.
