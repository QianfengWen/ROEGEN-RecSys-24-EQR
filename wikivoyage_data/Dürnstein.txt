Burgruine Dürnstein
Dürnstein is a small town in the Wachau in Austria, on the river Danube. Together with the neighbouring villages of Oberloiben and Unterloiben it is one of the main wine-producing centres of the region, and attracts nearly 1.7 million visitors annually.


Understand[edit]
Dürnstein derives its name from the ruined castle overlooking the town. The earliest historic records of the settlement date to the late 12th century, when Richard I of England was imprisoned in the castle by Leopold V, Duke of Austria, following the Third Crusade. Today the town is known primarily for its wine production and, along with the Wachau, as a popular tourist destination.
