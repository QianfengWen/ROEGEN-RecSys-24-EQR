Stroud is at the heart of the Five Valleys in the Cotswolds. It is in Gloucestershire, England. There's many fine, beautiful and interesting things to see but it's not "pretty" in the way that similar sized towns in the Cotswolds or Gloucestershire are. It's a fairly "alternative" place with organic/biodynamic food and a long history of campaigning to save local facilities and landmarks. 


Understand[edit]
Stroud High Street
Nailsworth Town Clock
market square, Minchinhampton
The area around the town is known as the Five Valleys consisting of the valleys of Chalford, Nailsworth, Ruscombe, Slad and Painswick. There are a number of small towns and villages in the area, such as Minchinhampton and Stonehouse.

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
Trains from London Paddington run hourly via  Reading, Didcot and Swindon to Stroud (90 min), continuing to  Gloucester and Cheltenham. Change at Cheltenham for trains from Birmingham and the north.

51.746-2.282 Stonehouse station (3 mi (4.8 km) west of Stroud). Trains towards Gloucester also stop at Stonehouse.   (updated Jul 2022)
By bus[edit]
Stagecoach Bus 66 runs hourly from Cheltenham to Stroud, taking just under an hour, and continuing to Stonehouse.

By car[edit]
From the M5 take exit 13 and follow A419 through Stonehouse. From  Bath follow A46. There are several surface-level carparks in the town run by the local council.  Use the MiPermit App (or cash) to pay their modest fees. The multi-storey accessed via the London Road is similarly cheap and even free after 3PM. The Five Valleys Car Park is also multi-storey and accessed from near the A46. It's privately run and its enforcement practices are often the subject of comment in local social media.

Get around[edit]

The town is small, and much of the shopping district has been pleasantly pedestrianised. (mind the steep hills!)
There are buses every half-hour from Stroud to Stonehouse on weekdays, or it's about an hour's walk.

See[edit]
The town and nearby has been an industrial area for hundreds of years so there are many fine old stone mills, weavers cottages, a canal. Little of this has been given serious "heritage" treatment but it doesn't spoil the often beautiful setting in wooded valleys.
