Çankırı is a city in Central Anatolia, about 140 km north of Ankara. It's industrial and modern, but lying on a trade route across the Anatolian plateau, has several old buildings of interest. You might break a journey to the Black Sea here. In 2020 the city population was 87,589, with another 10,000 or so living in the surrounding province. 


Understand[edit]
Old town near the castle
It's only 90 min drive from the Turkish capital but feels much further, a conservative provincial backwater, though it does have a university. The Byzantines used to exile people here, to the place then known as Gangra, meaning "goats". At some point mid-4th century, 21 bishops convened here ("The Synod of Gangra") to fulminate against Eustathius of Sebaste and his disciples, who were being ultra-holy in quite the wrong way.
One who left the area in the 19th century in search of a better life was Hacı Ahmet Rıza Effendi, from Kalfat a village west of Çankırı; he moved to Istanbul where he had a son Ali Kemal (1869–1922). Kemal was a journalist, anglophile and liberal and briefly the last interior minister of the Ottoman empire, but lynched by the "Young Turk" radicals. He was the great-grandfather of Boris Johnson, British prime minister 2019–22, whose contributions to Anglo-Turkish friendship included winning a magazine prize for the most scurrilous limerick about President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
