Separated from England's capital city by Epping Forest - almost 6,000 acres of ancient woodland - Epping is a historic market town in Essex. Despite being in London's Travelcard Zone 6, the town is surrounded by forest to the north and south, and green fields to the west and east. Epping is built on the ridge between the Roding and Lee Valleys, and its countryside walks offer glimpses of the skyscrapers in Central London and Canary Wharf. The town's own High Street is lined with shops, cafes, pubs and - on Mondays - market stalls.Hill Hall

Understand[edit]
Along with its ancient forest, Epping also lends its name to the surrounding local government district - Epping Forest. The nearby villages Epping Green and Epping Upland also share the town's name.
The town of Epping may have roots as far back as 7500 BC, according to the town council. Roman coins have been found in the town, dating back to between 81 and 96 AD. Legend says Celtic queen Boudicca died in battle at Ambresbury Banks, in the forest. Epping Forest District Museum says that sadly, there is no evidence[dead link] to support this claim.
King Henry III signed Epping's first market charter in 1253 - which permitted the Abbott of Waltham Abbey to hold a market on Mondays. Queen Elizabeth I (1575), King Charles II (1683) and King George V (1930) have also signed more recent Epping Market charters.
Today, the town is in the London commuter belt, with its own tube station at the eastern terminus of the Central line.
