Universal Orlando Resort is a theme park resort in Orlando, Florida, containing two action packed theme parks, an entertainment district with non-stop nightlife and extraordinary restaurants, a waterpark, and four world-class Loews hotels. Many visitors describe it as a place of fun, action, magic, excitement, humor, wonder, fantasy and attention to detail.
When guests exit the parking garage, they are first welcomed into the Universal CityWalk Orlando entertainment district. Then guests can see the two theme parks Universal Studios Florida and Islands of Adventure. Universal Orlando's waterpark, nearby, is Volcano Bay.


Understand[edit]
Universal CityWalk Orlando opened in 1999. Guests arriving at the resort park in one of two multi-story parking structures, then travel via covered moving sidewalks over Universal Boulevard and into CityWalk. From there, guests can proceed into either of the theme parks, Universal Studios Florida or Islands of Adventure. CityWalk features shopping, nightclubs, and dining venues, and a movie theater. Universal Store has all the merchandise from both parks and Margaritaville has a gift shop. There are many night clubs at CityWalk most popular is the Groove. Bob Marley-A Tribute to Freedom is both a night club and dining, Live Reggae & Jamaican Cuisine. CityWalk also features a Blue Man Group show at the Sharp Aquos Theater.
Universal Studios Florida is a movie and TV based theme park where there are an array of rides, shows, movie sets and attractions. Visitors also enjoy themed dining and shopping, a variety of special events throughout the year, and you might even catch a real film crew at work on the backlot. Universal Studios Florida, opened on June 7, 1990, is a theme park that lets visitors "Ride the Movies." The themes of Universal Studio's are targeted at making guests feel like they are in a movie set with rides, shows, and attractions that are inspired by popular film, television, and music productions. The park consists of eight themed areas – Hollywood, Production Central, New York, San Francisco, World Expo, Springfield, Woody Woodpecker's Kidzone and The Wizarding World of Harry Potter - Diagon Alley.
Islands of Adventure, opened May 28, 1999, is a theme park composed of seven distinct "islands" that are themed to various forms of adventures. Visitors start off in the Port of Entry and make their way through the various islands – Marvel Super Hero Island, Toon Lagoon, Jurassic Park, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, The Lost Continent, and Seuss Landing. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, based on the popular Harry Potter franchise, is the only island added after the park opened; it opened to the public on June 18, 2010
Volcano Bay is a water-park opened in May 2017 as a replacement for Wet 'n Wild (itself founded in 1977 by SeaWorld founder George Millay). The park is themed around a 200-foot-tall (61m) volcano named "Krakatau" (see Krakatoa for information on the real Krakatau). Volcano Bay's attractions are located in four themed areas, each inspired by various Polynesian islands and cultures
Universal Orlando's on-site hotels include: Loews Portofino Bay Hotel & Spa, Hard Rock Hotel, Loews Royal Pacific Hotel, and Cabana Bay Beach Resort. All four hotels are located in close proximity to the Universal Orlando theme parks. The hotels offer guests free water taxi or shuttle bus service to the Universal Orlando theme parks. Another benefit is that for all hotels but the Cabana Bay Beach Resort, the guest room can get you "Express Pass" at a kiosk near the ticket desk in the hotels. Theme park guests who are not staying at the Universal official hotels are able to purchase "Express Passes" at an additional cost.

Climate[edit]








Check the weather forecast for Universal Orlando at NOAA.



Like all of Central Florida, the climate at Universal Orlando is humid and subtropical.  Summer (May–October) is hot and sticky and winter (November–April) is mild and drier.  Visitors from higher latitudes are often surprised by the sheer intensity of the summer sun in Florida, which can rise to within a few degrees of straight overhead in June and July.  In June through September, late afternoon thundershowers are very common; plan accordingly.
Inclement weather can often lead to the temporary closure of outdoor rides and live performances. In the case of rides, they will re-open after the weather improves. Live performances may be either delayed or canceled outright. On the other hand, inclement weather could work to your advantage, as it drives some visitors away from outdoor areas, or out of the parks entirely.

When to visit[edit]
There used to be some times of year when the parks were relatively deserted, but not so much anymore.  Now they just vary from "moderately busy" to "completely insane".  Still, deciding when to go remains a game of trade-offs: you must decide whether to favor lower crowds or longer park hours, and decide whether you prefer scorching days or chilly nights.
The peak periods for attendance are late December, mid-June to mid-August, and mid-February to mid-April.  Why?  That's when kids are on break from school.  If you have kids, you may have no choice but to go during these peak times.  The bad news is that you'll be packed like sardines next to 50,000 of your new closest friends, you'll wait two hours to go on rides like Forbidden Journey, Rip Ride Rockit, and Transformers, and you'll be paying a premium for the privilege.  In the summer, you also get to listen to the kids complain about the heat.  On the bright side, you'll have plenty of company, the parks are guaranteed to be open late, and almost every ride will be up and running.
If your schedule allows any flexibility at all, you should avoid these peak periods.  Attendance is lowest in October, November (pre-Thanksgiving), December (pre-Christmas), and January.  These can be very good times to go; crowds are low and prices are too, but keep in mind that you may find that several rides are shut down for maintenance, and the parks have shorter operating hours.  In the winter, it's often too cold to go to the water parks, and you'll need a jacket at night.
Be aware, however, during the periods of mid-December to February, mid-June to July, during the first 2-3 weeks of October, and on Thanksgiving Day (in some cases), tour groups from South American countries, mainly from Brazil and Argentina, will invade Universal Orlando and other Orlando theme parks (including Disney). Many guests have complained of rudeness and improper supervision. There may be some groups that may not be as problematic as everyone could think, but still, if you see or hear a group of teens behind one or more 20- to 30-year-old adult(s) with a flag, your best bet is to go in the opposite direction.

The weeks between Easter and Memorial Day are another slow period, as well as the months of August and September; both periods provide a good balance of price, crowds, temperature, and operating hours, but you may need to take the kids out of school if you're bringing them along.
Of course, you may want to coordinate your trip with a special event such as Halloween Horror Nights.

Which day of the week[edit]
If your vacation dates are flexible, plan to arrive to the Orlando area on Thursday. Both Friday and Saturday are transition days for park visitors and less crowded, especially in the summer months. Saturdays do draw in more Annual Pass holders to the park, but that is the major day that people either arrive or leave the area. This causes attendance figures to be down, making it a perfect day to visit the parks.  If you are planning to have a day of rest in your vacation, by arriving on Thursday you can enjoy two days of parks with reduced crowds and then use Sunday to rest.
To fill this unused capacity, Universal Orlando holds crowd-drawing special events on some weekends (F-Su).  The above advice is not good for these event weekends.  Consult a crowd calendar for your planning.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Most visitors fly into Orlando International Airport (MCO IATA), +1 407-825-2001. It's served by every major US airline and a wide variety of international carriers. Once there, you can rent a car, take a taxi, or order a limo or town car. If you're staying at an on-site Universal hotel, another option is Universal's Superstar Shuttle, a free bus service from the airport to all six resort hotels. Prior reservations are required. If driving yourself, Florida State Road 528 links the airport with Interstate 4, and heading northbound on that highway leads directly to Universal.
Orlando-Sanford International Airport (SFB IATA is a bit farther from Universal than Orlando International. Aside from domestic flights on Allegiant Air, the airport primarily handles flights from the United Kingdom and Iceland, and Universal's Superstar Shuttle is not available here. Florida State Road 417 connects the airport to Interstate 4.

By car[edit]
Interstate 4 is the most direct driving route to Universal Orlando, passing just south of the resort. Depending on your point of origin, Florida's Turnpike can be quite useful, particularly if you're driving north from the Miami area. If you're coming from a cruise at Port Canaveral, Florida State Road 528 gets you to I-4, with Orlando International Airport and the Turnpike en route.

By train[edit]
Amtrak's Silver Service Miami–New York City routes serve Orlando four times daily, with two trains in either direction. Northbound trains from Miami arrive at the Orlando station at 1:43PM and 7:08PM; southbound trains from NYC arrive at 10:17AM and 12:55PM. The Auto Train, which can carry both passengers and automobiles, serves nearby Sanford non-stop from Lorton, Virginia (near Washington, D.C.).
If you are coming from Volusia, Seminole, or northern Osceola counties on a weekday and want to avoid I-4 traffic, your best option is SunRail, which runs between DeBary and Poinciana. There is no service on weekends and some federal holidays (for example, Thanksgiving and Christmas Day), and the trains run every 30 minutes during rush hour periods, and every 2 hours during off peak periods. The closest station to Universal is at Sand Lake Road in Orlando, however, a taxi or ridesharing service will be needed to complete the journey. For convenience, take the train to Lynx Central Station in downtown Orlando and take Lynx bus routes 21, 38, or 40 to Universal. You may also disembark at the Orlando Health/Orlando Amtrak station and board Lynx bus route 40 from there.

By bus[edit]
Universal's Superstar Shuttle is a very popular option for guests staying at Universal resort hotels; it provides transportation to and from the airport. Be sure to book service ahead of time! It costs about $39 per adult, each way.
If you're not staying at a Universal resort, or aren't coming in via Orlando International, you do have some other choices. Mears Transportation is the main player in the region; they have a fleet of shuttle buses and town cars that can take you to any of the local attractions or hotels.
Long-distance bus company Greyhound serves Orlando at their Orlando Terminal, ☏ +1 407-292-3424.
LYNX is the public bus service of the Central Florida Regional Transportation Authority. Four LYNX routes provide service between Universal Orlando and the surrounding area. All pick-up and drop-off from the Universal Orlando Parking Garage bus stop, next to the guest drop-off loop on the walkway between the parking garages and CityWalk.

Regular routes:
Route 21, from Universal inbound to Lynx Central Station in downtown Orlando and outbound to Sand Lake Commons. This is the one of four connectors to SunRail at Lynx Central Station.
Route 37, from Universal northbound to Park Promenade Plaza near and southbound to the Florida Mall.
Route 38, from Universal southbound to International Drive and Destination Parkway, and Northbound non-stop express to Lynx Central Station in downtown Orlando.
Route 40, from Universal inbound to Lynx Central Station. This is the other connector to SunRail. (The outbound route for this line only goes one stop further, to the Universal Employee Center; make sure you don't go to this stop!)
Route 303, is a commuter route with very limited service, running from Universal to different locations throughout Orlando and Walt Disney World, specifically servicing Disney Springs.
Tickets[edit]
A Universal vacation is an expensive proposition, but with some planning you can determine just how expensive. Tickets are sold in options ranging from one to five days. While single-day tickets are very costly, buying multiple-day tickets makes for a much lower price per-day.





En route to Hogwarts
The Hogwarts Express is an immersive train ride that connects the Hogsmeade section of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Islands of Adventure with the Diagon Alley section in Universal Studios Florida. As it links both theme parks, a 2-Park ticket is required to ride the train, and guests with just a single-park ticket will be turned away!


Two kinds of tickets are offered: One Park tickets and Park-to-Park tickets. Park-to-Park tickets are split further into two different kinds: the 2-Park option, covering Universal Studios Florida and Island of Adventure, and the 3-Park option, which adds in the Volcano Bay water park. Make note that the 3-Park option is only available with the 2-day tickets or more. To visit Volcano Bay with a One Park ticket, you'll need to buy 3 days or more.
As the two theme parks at Universal are so close (within easy walking distance!), the Park-to-Park tickets are a great deal if you're interested in, for example, spending a morning in one park and then having dinner in the other, and then going back to the first to check out a nighttime show. If you're interested in riding the Hogwarts Express train ride, you'll also need a Park-to-Park ticket.
Buying online through the Universal Orlando website can save you $20 off the price of tickets bought at the gate.
Another add-on option for your tickets is the My Universal Photos package, which allows unlimited downloads of all photos and videos taken at participating locations in both theme parks and the water park as well as one 4x6 and one 5x7 photo print. Also included is a themed lanyard and a card that enables photographers to group your photos together in the online system. Exclusive pricing at on select in-park photo prints rounds out the amenities. One and three-day packages are offered, at $70 or $90 per card. If you're just visiting Volcano Bay, a separate water park-only package is sold for $40 per card.
The CityWalk Party Pass ticket enables unlimited club-to-club access on one night, and runs $12 per pass, or $15 if you want to include a movie at the AMC Cineplex. 
Multiple-day tickets do not have to be used on consecutive days, however, these tickets will expire 6 days after they are first used (7 days total), so be sure to use all the days purchased prior to that. Unused tickets expire 12 months from the order date.
Children under age three are admitted for free. The prices below were accurate as of July 2018 (6.5% Florida sales tax not included):

Florida residents who provide proof of residence get discounts of varying degrees with some blockout dates, and they can't purchase beyond a 4-day ticket. Annual passes are also available for frequent visitors or residents.

Universal Express[edit]
Universal Studios Florida allow guests to utilize the "Universal Express Plus" Pass on selected attractions. This pass admits users to a separate line for the attraction, which is given priority status when boarding. Guests of Universal's three on-site resorts may show their room keys for unlimited uses of the faster line for each ride.
Universal Express is not included in park admission. There are a limited number of passes available each day and they are often sold out in advance. The cost of the pass varies based on what parks are selected and even what day is selected, with higher prices charged on peak operating days during the year.
If staying at Portofino Bay, Royal Pacific Resort or the Hard Rock Hotel then free Universal Express is available at kiosk in the lobby with your room key.

Get around[edit]
While everything at Universal Orlando is within a fairly short walking distance from any point in the resort, there are some additional options for getting to and from the on-site resort hotels.  You can take a free water taxi boat or a rickshaw to get to all resorts except for the Cabana Bay Beach Resort; for the latter you can take one of their specially-themed buses that run between CityWalk and the hotel.

Talk[edit]
As in most places in the United States, English is the default language throughout the Universal Orlando Resort.  However, many team members throughout the property are bi- or tri-lingual, and they can be identified by language signs on their name tags, representing the languages they speak. Spanish is very common in Florida, and the US as a whole. Spanish speakers will not have any problems navigating the resort.
Guest Services locations are near the entrance of all the theme parks, water parks, and resort hotels. Team members, who usually are multilingual, will also be available there to answer any questions you may have.
For hearing-impaired guests, assistive listening devices and captioning (handheld, reflective, or video) are available for selected attractions. Cast Members with knowledge of American Sign Language can be identified by the appropriate symbol on their name tags, and interpreters are available by appointment.

Do[edit]
A charming feature of Universal Orlando's rides is that they entertain you even while you're waiting to get into the ride. You can watch clips from The Simpsons when in line for its namesake ride, peruse magical curiosities on your way into Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, and watch live singing performances while waiting for the Race Through New York Starring Jimmy Fallon. Of course waiting in line is still waiting in line, but that time doesn't feel as wasted here as it does at some amusement parks.

Universal Studios Florida[edit]
The archway entrance to the theme park.
Universal Studios Florida features seven themed areas, all situated around a large lagoon. Clockwise from the entrance, they are Production Central, New York, San Francisco, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter – Diagon Alley, World Expo, Springfield: Home of the Simpsons, Woody Woodpecker's Kidzone and Hollywood. Each area features a combination of rides, shows, attractions, character appearances, dining outlets and merchandise stores.

28.47455-81.4664222 Universal Studios Globe. Its popularity as a selfie spot means that you might have to wait in line for a photo. To avoid the wait, try taking your photo from across the water with the globe in the background. Then the globe may look less prominent, but you'll capture other parts of CityWalk in the photo too.

 Ollivanders Wand Shop. Not just a wand shop but an interactive show as well – you'll be allowed in with a group of other visitors, and Ollivander chooses one member of the crowd for a wand selection ceremony. (This little performance is well worth watching, but if you want to skip it, you can go into the shop from the other side without meeting Ollivander.) And the wands for sale are not just souvenirs: they can be used at various locations in Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade to do magic. Each wand's box comes with a map of these sections of the park and instructions for how to cast spells. Not a joke – the wand motions really make things happen! Some of the spells can be a bit tricky so they may take several tries, but don't give up. (updated Apr 2023)

Drink[edit]
When creating the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, the folks at Universal had to turn the fictional drink of butterbeer into something real. Fortunately, they did an excellent job, and the butterbeer sold in the park is a unique and deliciously sweet non-alcoholic drink. It's available in regular, hot, and frozen varieties; regular is a soda while frozen is something like a slushee. The drink's creamy topping is made from dairy, but the regular and frozen kinds can be made dairy-free and vegan by leaving off the topping, and butterbeer with a non-dairy, vegan topping is available at the Leaky Cauldron and the Three Broomsticks. (The hot version has dairy in its base and can't be veganized.)

Sleep[edit]
One of the best perks to staying on site is that shuttles and ferries to and from Universal Studios, Islands of Adventures, and Universal's CityWalk are available free of charge! And another great perk of staying on the grounds is that you get admission one hour early to one of the parks (either Universal Studios or Islands of Adventure depending on the day), so you can get on the rides when the lines are short before the parks open to the rest of the public.
Universal Orlando Resort offers five on site hotels, with three more opening over the next three years. They are split into categories ranging from Value to Premier.
The three "Premier" hotels (Loews Royal Pacific Resort, Hard Rock Hotel, and Loews Portofino Bay Hotel) also include free Universal Express Unlimited for shorter lines in the parks.

Budget[edit]
Universal classifies these hotels as Prime Value resorts. All fairly new and lightly themed, these options are great for families and guests who want less of a full resort atmosphere and more of a convenient place to relax and sleep after a long day in the theme parks. Though less expensive than the other on-site hotels, these are still well-equipped and have some resort-style facilities.

28.465047-81.4711541 Universal's Aventura Hotel, 6725 Adventure Way, ☏ +1-407-503-6000. Check-in: 4PM, check-out: 11AM.  (updated Jun 2020)
28.46547-81.4734572 Universal's Cabana Bay Beach Resort, 6550 Adventure Way, ☏ +1 407-503-4000, toll-free: +1-888-273-1311. Check-in: 4PM, check-out: 11AM. The Cabana Bay Beach Resort, opened in 2014, is a 2,200-room retro-themed resort offering both motel-style family suites and standard interior-entrance rooms. Despite the low price point, it offers some unique elements like a bowling alley, an arcade, and a special Jack LaLanne fitness center. The resort features two large zero-entry pools, both offering the namesake cabanas, and a lazy river. The main building also has a large cafeteria-style restaurant named Bayliner Diner, as well as a Starbucks, the Swizzle Lounge bar, and a Universal Studios Store. Each pool also has a bar. $116 and up.  (updated Apr 2023)
A third budget resort, consisting of two unique hotels in a new lower category termed Value, is under construction across Interstate 4 from the main Universal Orlando Resort property. Connected by shuttle, this resort will be named Universal's Endless Summer Resort. The first phase to open, the Surfside Inn and Suites hotel, will begin accepting guests in the summer of 2019. The second, the Dockside Inn and Suites hotel, will open in 2020.

Mid-range[edit]
Universal's mid-range hotels are called Preferred resorts. Providing more extensive amenities and dining options, these resorts are ideal for those looking to kick back and unwind after enjoying the parks.

28.466983-81.4706833 Loews Sapphire Falls Resort, 6601 Adventure Way, ☏ +1 407-503-5000, toll-free: +1-888-884-7922. Check-in: 4PM, check-out: 11AM.  (updated Nov 2021)
28.468381-81.4672234 Loews Royal Pacific Resort, 6300 Hollywood Way, toll-free: +1-888-430-4999. Check-in: 4Pm, check-out: 11AM. The Royal Pacific Resort is another dynamite resort on the Universal Studios grounds. One thing to not miss out on while staying at The Royal Pacific offers is the chance to experience authentic Polynesian cuisine and entertainment at Wantilan Luau. Unlike the Portofino Bay, the Royal Pacific Resort only offers one pool, but as an on-site guest you can travel to any of the other on-site hotels and are allowed pool access. The fan favorite pool... the one located at the Hard Rock Resort (it plays music under water!). $220 and up.  (updated Jul 2018)
Splurge[edit]
Universal's highest level of hotels are termed Premier resorts. These large hotels offer a wide range of amenities, including high-end dining, massive pools, extensive theming and luxurious rooms.

28.476654-81.4645915 Hard Rock Hotel, 5800 Universal Blvd, toll-free: +1-888-430-4999. The Hard Rock Hotel is the third of Universal Orlando's upscale resorts, featuring theming that makes it resemble a sprawling mansion of a rock star in Hollywood. There is a hip, music-oriented theme inside; at the pool, you can actually listen to music underwater.  (updated Nov 2021)
28.4808-81.46086 Loews Portofino Bay Hotel, 5601 Universal Blvd, toll-free: +1-888-430-4999. Portofino Bay is a beautiful Italian style-hotel, however it can be a bit pricey, depending on the season. Out of the places to eat at this hotel, a particularly good option is Mama Della's Ristorante. The eatery offers great food and great service; however beware of the dim lighting, so you may need your reading glasses to get a look at the delicious menu. Don't fret about getting there before check-in, they allow guests to pre-register as soon as they arrive, and will even activate the Universal Express feature before you check-in so you can get the most out of your vacation.   (updated Jul 2018)
