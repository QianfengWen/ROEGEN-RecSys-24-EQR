Peterborough is a city in Cambridgeshire in East Anglia, with a population of 202,259 in 2019. It's industrial and ringed by bland "New Town" residential districts, yet has an attractive historic centre around its cathedral, where two British monarchs were buried. 


Understand[edit]
Peterborough Cathedral
In Jurassic times this area was covered by a tropical sea, depositing thick layers of clay, limestone and decomposing dinosaurs. The last Ice Age (the "Devensian") didn't quite reach here but its melt-off left beds of gravel. These are just what you need for pottery, bricks and road construction, and even in Roman times there were brick works here. The land is low-lying but not too low - it's just west of the Fens, so it's fertile, and a natural route for roads and later railways. An important medieval city grew up and the cathedral was built from the 12th century. In early modern times the Fens were drained, and the 19th / 20th century saw a growth in engineering, such as Perkins the diesel manufacturers. Brickmakers continued to scoop out the local clay, and their spent pits flooded to dot the landscape with lagoons.
London is only an hour away and in the mid-20th century Peterborough grew from "overspill", as industry and workforces moved north to escape city congestion and high property prices. This was formalised in 1967 when Peterborough was designated a "New Town", one of several in that era. The old centre was left largely intact while three greenfield villages were added: Bretton, Orton and Paston; a fourth was left unbuilt. It's fair to say that these were not the sort of bucolic heart-of-England villages that Constable or Turner might have painted. But there was good employment as service industries took over from manufacturing, the architecture was bland rather than brutal, and they've fared better than some of the other "New Towns".

See[edit]
Cathedral Square is the fine plaza fronting the cathedral, but what you see first is St John the Baptist, the Anglican parish church built in 1407. This was where the townsfolk prayed, while the monks descanted in the cathedral. It's a striking building in Perpendicular style but most of the interior is 19th century. Guildhall on its east side was built in 1671, an open arcaded building with a market space on the ground floor.

Highlights within are the original 13th century painted nave ceiling, the graves of Katharine of Aragon (first wife of Henry VIII) and of Mary Queen of Scots (re-interred in 1612 in Westminster Abbey), the fan vaulting of the New Building Ceiling, the Hedda Stone (an 8th century carving from the predecessor Saxon church) and St Oswald's Chapel with its original 12th century watchtower. It's an active church so you need to work around services. Donation £5.   (updated May 2022)
