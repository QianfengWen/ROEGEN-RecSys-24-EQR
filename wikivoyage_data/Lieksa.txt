Neitijärvi ("Lady Lake") in the Ruunaa hiking area
Lieksa is a town in North Karelia, at the eastern shore of Lake Pielinen. The municipality reaches from the lake to the Russian border.


Understand[edit]
One of the main draws of Lieksa is its proximity to the vast Wild Taiga region, which stretches along the Russian border and is home to some of Europe's last remaining primeval forests. This unspoiled landscape provides ample opportunities for outdoor activities like hiking, berry picking, mushroom hunting, and wildlife watching.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Lieksa is 90 km from the nearest major city Joensuu, and you can drive from there in a little over an hour.

By public transit[edit]
Lieksa is connected to Joensuu and Nurmes by local train and bus.

By ferry[edit]
The ferry across Pielinen was suspended in 2020.
