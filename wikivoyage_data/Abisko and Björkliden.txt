Abisko is a popular outdoor destination due to its proximity to nature and relatively easy accessibility. Abisko is near many great national parks and hosts a trailhead on the spectacular Kungsleden hiking trail; at the same time, it is on the malmbanan railway between Narvik in Norway and Luleå, which means it can be reached by an overnight train from Stockholm quite easily. Abisko village is around the train station "Abisko Östra". The large and well equipped hostel/hotel "Abisko turiststation" lies at the train station of the same name, 2 km further west.
Torneträsk, on the shore of which Abisko is located, is the sixth largest and second deepest lake of Sweden, and the largest fell lake in Scandinavia.

Do[edit]

The tourist station organises various activities throughout the year, but the real attraction is hiking on the many trails, out in the spectacular wilderness of the national parks of the area. Winter offers cross country skiing and even some alpine skiing. There is a chair lift on Nuolja and two more alpine areas nearby at Björkliden and Riksgränsen.
There are three (partly coinciding) long distance hiking trails from or passing Abisko. They can be used also for shorter hikes, especially Kungsleden has good infrastructure.

Kungsleden (440 km), probably the best-known hiking trail is Sweden, to the south.
Nordkalottleden (800 km), the southern part of which partly coincides with Kungsleden and Padjelantaleden but also meanders among the Norwegian fells. To the north the trail continues via Norway, northernmost Sweden, the tripoint Sweden/Norway/Finland and Kilpisjärvi (190 km) to Kautokeino in Norwegian Finnmark (190 km more).
European long distance path E1 from Italy, north of Abisko mostly coinciding with Nordkalottleden.
Kebnekaise, the highest mountain in Sweden, can be reached from Abisko by Kungsleden, although Nikkaluokta is closer (see Kebnekaise and Nikkaluokta). Kebnekaise fjällstation at the root of the mountain is the most common base for expeditions (also guided tours in season). The Singi mountain cabins (Singistugorna) at Kungsleden are another option for independent expeditions.
There are also other mountains in the 2,000 m (6,000 feet) range in the area.

The Storstugan pub inside the tourist station is the friendliest place in town to go for a drink. Rather fortunate, since it's also the only place.

Sleep[edit]
There's a bed and breakfast in Abisko village, as well as some summer cottages. The tourist station has hostel, hotel and cottage accommodation available. It is run by STF, Svenska Turistföreningen; as accommodation is considerably cheaper for members it may be advisable to sign up for membership before booking. Membership is also available at the reception. There is also a camping ground – although the right to roam basically entitles you to sleep anywhere except in the Abisko national park or by private houses, as there are not really any cultivated lands. In the national park camping is allowed at the tourist station, at Nissonjohka and at the Abiskojaure cabins.
