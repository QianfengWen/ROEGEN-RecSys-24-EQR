Renton is a city in King County, Washington south of Bellevue and north of Kent. It is a quiet suburb of Seattle at the base of Lake Washington. Its relatively inexpensive property prices make it a solid choice of stay while visiting Seattle, and the downtown area has many quiet charms of its own that make a visit worthwhile.


Understand[edit]
Renton was named for Captain William Renton, the financial backer of the Renton Coal Company which was founded by one of Renton's first white settlers, Erasmus Smithers. Built on Duwamish land, Renton gained settlers looking for jobs in the coal mines until Boeing began to open plants for aircraft construction in World War II, resulting in a population boom. Today, Renton is primarily known as the site of the Boeing 737 plant, where the popular commercial jetliner is built. Renton is also notable for being the resting place of rock legend Jimi Hendrix.
As of the 2010 census, Renton had a population of 90,927.
This article covers more than the City of Renton as it includes three potential annexation zones that are typically considered part of Renton (though some have addresses in Seattle and Issaquah). (The Renton School District has different borders than the city and unincorporated parts of King County are given Renton addresses.)

Get in[edit]
Map of Renton
By car[edit]
Access to Renton from Bellevue and Seattle is via Interstate 405. From south King County, via State Route 167, and from the southeast part of the county, via State Route 169.

By plane[edit]
The city is also served by King County International Airport (BFI IATA), also known as Boeing Field. The main hub scheduled commercial flights is, of course, SeaTac International Airport, accessible by public transit.

47.492629-122.2149161 Renton Municipal Airport (RNT  IATA). You can fly in right next door to the Boeing 737 Plant, although you would need your own plane to do so.   
Get around[edit]
By car[edit]
As with many American suburbs, Renton is difficult to navigate without a car. If you're trying to use public transit to go anywhere that's not the Landing or downtown core, you should expect that you will probably have to walk at least a mile out of your way to get to your destination.
There are several car rental agencies with locations in Renton, including Avis, Enterprise, and Hertz.

By bike[edit]
Renton does not have bike lanes like Seattle does, but many trails exist throughout the city that are exclusively available to cyclists and pedestrians that can make biking a great option for getting around.
