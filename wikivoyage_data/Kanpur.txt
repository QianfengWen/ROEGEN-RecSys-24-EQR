As of May 2024, the Kanpur Metro consists of one line with 9 stations, stretching from the prestigious academic institution IIT Kanpur in the west to Motijheel (Pearl lake) in the east. 

By bus[edit]
There are city buses run by UPSRTC under JNNURM. These buses offer cheaper rates than auto rickshaws. AC low floor city buses that are very comfortable cost the most to ride. Some other types of buses are non-AC low floor, minibuses and low floors which also offer low rates.

By auto rickshaw[edit]
You can travel using an auto rickshaw or the tempo called Vikram. Vikram is the cheapest mode of transport but a pain to travel. However, Vikram drivers have a fixed rate for point-to-point travels and it's an experience in itself when 10 people (and driver) travel in one Vikram. The quality of auto rickshaws in Kanpur is also pathetic and there is not fixed rate or meter system. You have to bargain with the driver.

By cycle rickshaw[edit]
There is no standard or norm for the price of cycle rickshaws. They can be found on the main road and smaller roads.

By taxi[edit]
Private taxis like vans and other cars are available from Canal Road Taxi Stand and from various hotels and travel agencies.
