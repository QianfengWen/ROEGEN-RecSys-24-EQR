Leeds-Grenville courthouse
Brockville is a city of about 32,000 people (2021) on the St. Lawrence River in Eastern Ontario.


Understand[edit]
Southeastern Ontario is United Empire Loyalist country, colonised primarily by loyal British subjects fleeing the newly established United States of America at the end of the American Revolution (1776-1783). Because of the region's proximity to the US border (Morristown, New York, directly across the St. Lawrence River, is easily visible from Brockville's waterfront) this area was one of the front lines in the War of 1812. The town's name refers to General Isaac Brock, leader of British-Canadian soldiers in the Niagara region during that war.
Brockville bills itself as the "City of the Thousand Islands", in reference to a group of islands directly upriver on the Ontario-New York border.

Get in[edit]

Brockville is part of major transportation corridors between Toronto and Montréal, Canada's two largest cities. Transportation infrastructure includes the St. Lawrence Seaway, the CN Rail mainline (Toronto-Ottawa and Toronto-Montréal VIA passenger services follow the same path east to Brockville, then diverge) and roads such as Ontario Highways 2 and 401. The scenic Thousand Islands Parkway ends just west of the city.
The closest major airport is Ottawa-Uplands (YOW IATA), some 100 km distant. Montréal-Dorval (YUL IATA), while more distant, may also be a viable option as it offers relatively easy air-to-rail connections.
There is no scheduled bus or rail service to southeastern Ontario from Watertown or Syracuse.

By car[edit]
Brockville is located on Highway 401 about 50 minutes east of Kingston and two hours west of Montreal.
There is no active international crossing within Brockville, despite its close proximity to Morristown NY. A ferry once joined the two towns, but was abandoned after an international bridge opened at Prescott-Ogdensburg (1960); there's another bridge upriver in the Thousand Islands (1938).
From Ottawa, access to the region is normally by Highway 416 to Prescott, the next major town downriver. Travel time from Bayshore (in Ottawa's west end) to Brockville is nominally an hour (100 km, 60 miles). From Smiths Falls, the Brockville Road (old Highway 29) is a half-hour of driving on two-lane road.
