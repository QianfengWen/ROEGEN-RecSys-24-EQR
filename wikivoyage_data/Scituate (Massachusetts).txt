Get around[edit]

Much of the shopping and dining are within the compact Scituate Harbor area. The action goes down along Front Street from the Satuit Brook bridge to Beverdam road. A municipal parking can be found just behind the main drag. Likely one of the best views from a parking lot you'll ever see. The beaches are a longer walk, maybe 10-15 minutes to Sand Hills or Peggoty beaches.
Near the harbor, bikes can speed you between locations. There's not much cycling infrastructure to speak of, but most roads are quiet and calm enough for even children to bike safely on. There is a scenic bike path along most of the Drift Way. Locals are used to seeing bikes, this is a beach community after all.
If you are leaving the harbor area, you'll need a car to get any real exploring done.
