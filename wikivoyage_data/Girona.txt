Catalan Way of St James
Girona is the chief city of Província de Girona in Catalonia, northeast Spain. In Castilian Spanish it's called Gerona, but this page uses Catalan spellings. In 2023 the city had a population of 104,320, with about another 50,000 in the adjoining town of Salt.
The city is astride trade and pilgrimage routes from France into Spain, and pilgrimage traffic is as strong as ever: "But we're nowhere near Barcelona!" is the plaintive cry of sun-seekers who boarded a flight to a place that Ryanair called Barcelona-Girona. It's actually less than 100 km, the transfer bus will be along any minute, and for beach resorts along the Costa Brava, Girona is the closest airport. But it would be a mistake to rush away to those places and fail to explore this fascinating ancient city, with its cathedral, walls and higgledy-piggledy medieval streets ranged upon the hillside.

Girona is at the confluence of the Ter, Onyar, Galligants and Güell rivers, so transport routes across Catalonia are focussed here. It was the Roman city of Gerunda, astride their cross-country road to Cádiz. It was captured by the Moors in 715 AD but reconquered by the Holy Roman Empire in 785, though it suffered a century of destructive further attacks. So like other northern towns, Girona doesn't have the Moorish heritage seen in Andalucia, which they held for another 700 years. It did however acquire a large Jewish population, until they were expelled from Spain in 1492. From the 17th to 19th centuries it was repeatedly assaulted from France, but this ended with the defeat of Napoleon. Its city walls were then taken down on the west side, but have been retained on the east side around Old Town (Barri Vell) and the university.
Town centre is along the Onyar river, with Old Town on the east bank; the Onyar then joins the larger Ter, swinging north towards the coast. C de Calderers is the main thoroughfare on this bank. New Town is west and south, a 19th-century grid with the majority of shops, hotels and restaurants, plus the railway and bus stations.
Girona is an all-year destination but in winter can suffer cold winds from the mountains, with temperatures sometimes below −5 °C (23 °F), and frequent rain. In summer temperatures often soar to 30–40 °C (86–104 °F), and citizens escape to the coast whenever they can.

41.8980772.7660011 Girona Airport (GRO  IATA), ☏ +34 913 211000. Ryanair are the main operator, with year-round flights to/from some regional airports in the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Poland, as well as London Stansted and Marrakesh.

Further out[edit]
41.9936112.83166713 Castell de Montjuïc is the crumbling remnants of a fortress, built from 1653 to keep the French at bay but no match for Napoleon, and abandoned after 1814. As in Barcelona, "Montjuïc" means "Hill of the Jews" and was their cemetery; their homes and businesses were on "The Call", C de la Força near the cathedral. After they were expelled in 1492 most of the tombstones were pilfered for masonry but several survive in museums. The cemetery was forgotten until the railway drilled through in 1862 and there's nothing to see of it now. The hill was declared a "green zone" in 1955 but became a squatters' shanty town, until 1971 when the squatters also were expelled and the area turned into residential suburbs. You'd only come up here for the view, take Bus L1.
