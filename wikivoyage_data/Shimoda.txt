Shimoda view from Mount Nesugata
Bust of Commodore Matthew Perry
Shimoda (下田) is a city on the Izu Peninsula in Japan. It is famous as the place where Commodore Matthew Perry of the U.S. Navy arrived with his "black ships" in 1853. This led to the signing of the Convention of Kanagawa, effectively ending Japan's 200-year era of isolation from the outside world.
This city of 21,000 people (2019) has some of Japan's best surfing beaches and has consequently become an emerging hipster destination, with a few crafty bars and restaurants popping up.


Tourist information site[edit]
The local tourist association has a Japanese-only guide site and an English-language guide site.

Map of Shimoda
By train[edit]
Shimoda is as far south as you can go by train on the Izu Peninsula. The train station is the terminal of the Izukyu Railway, and is officially known as Izukyu-Shimoda (伊豆急下田) station.
Odoriko (踊り子) trains make multiple daily runs from Tokyo station via the JR Tokaido Main Line. A one-way trip will generally take 2 hr 45 min at a cost of ¥5890. Holders of the national Japan Rail Pass will have to pay ¥2070 each way to travel over the Izu Kyuko Line, but if you have a JR East Rail Pass, the entire journey is fully covered. Some Odoriko trains also leave Tokyo from Shinjuku and Ikebukuro. The name of these trains may have different variants; the Saphir Odoriko (サフィール踊り子), for example, has wider windows and makes fewer stops.
Local trains take slightly longer, with at least one change of trains required at Atami or Ito, but the cost is much cheaper (¥3780).

Get around[edit]
Across the street from the station is Shimoda Tourist Association, where you can get help with orientation. ☏ +81 558 22-1531. Central Shimoda is small enough to be explored on foot. To reach the beaches and some of the sights it's more comfortable to take a bus. Platforms are outside the railway station.

See[edit]
A cable car ("Shimoda Ropeway") takes you to the top of Mount Nesugata, 200 m above sea level. From there you get a great view of Shimoda and you can also explore a small park with a temple. The price for a return ticket is ¥1200, including admission to the park. A printable 10% discount ticket is available on the cable car's official site.
Shimoda Park is near the port, a 20-minute walk from the station. You can also take a bus headed for the Shimoda Aquarium which is next to the park. The park features a 1957 monument of the opening of US-Japan diplomatic relations, and plenty of flowers including thousands of hydrangeas that bloom in June.
The temple of Ryosen-ji is a 25-minute walk south from the station. A supplementary treaty to the Kanagawa Treaty was signed here by Commodore Perry and representatives of the shogunate. Next to the temple is a museum with exhibitions about the arrival of foreigners in Japan, and even a collection of erotic Buddhist art. Admission to the museum is ¥500. Another temple, Choraku-ji, is close to Ryosen-ji and also worth a visit. It is the site of a trade treaty between Japan and Russia, signed in 1854.

Beaches[edit]
Some of Izu's best beaches are near Shimoda.

The white sand beach of Shirahama (白浜), not to be confused with the town in the Wakayama prefecture, is 4 km north-east of central Shimoda. Buses from Shimoda Station depart about twice per hour and the trip takes ten minutes. The beach has great sand, and when the waves are high enough it is a good place for surfing.
Irita-hama (入田浜), 15 min west of Shimoda, has much gentler waves.  One of the prettiest beaches in Izu, it's a great place for a swim.  To get there, take any bus bound for Irozaki (石廊崎) and get off at Nyuta (入田).
