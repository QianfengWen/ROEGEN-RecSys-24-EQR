Waterfront of Orillia
Orillia is a city of about 31,000 people (2016) in Ontario, 35 km northeast of Barrie.


Understand[edit]
Known as the "Sunshine City", the city's large waterfront attracts many tourists to the area every year, as do a number of annual festivals and other cultural attractions. While the area's largest employer is Casino Rama, overall economic activity in Orillia is a mixture of many different industries including manufacturing, government services, customer service and tourism.
Orillia sits on the shores of two connected lakes: Lake Simcoe and Lake Couchiching. Both lakes are part of the Trent-Severn Waterway. Travel north on Lake Couchiching, then through three locks and the only marine railway in North America leads to Georgian Bay on Lake Huron. Travel south-east across Lake Simcoe, through many locks (including two of the highest hydraulic lift locks in the world) eventually leads to Lake Ontario. From either of these Great Lakes one can connect to the St. Lawrence and thence to the Atlantic Ocean.
Orillia draws visitors as a gateway to Lake Country, cottage country in Muskoka, Algonquin Provincial Park, the Trent–Severn Waterway and other natural attractions.

History[edit]
The history of the area dates back at least several thousand years. Archaeologists have uncovered evidence of fishing by the Huron and Iroquois peoples in the area over 4,000 years ago, and of sites used by First Nations peoples for hundreds of years for trading, hunting, and fishing.
The French explorer Samuel de Champlain visited the area in the summer of 1615. He travelled over a trail used by the Hurons, Ojibways, French and British used as a fur-trading route. It would become the Coldwater Road centuries later. Champlain spent the winter with the Hurons in their chief village of Cahiague (near the current Warminster). A monument to Samuel de Champlain can also be found in Couchiching Beach Park and is a National Historic Site of Canada.
The government made treaties with the Hurons in 1798, 1815 and 1818 to gain land to the north and west of Lake Simcoe and then made grants to military veterans. In 1840, the government bought extra land from the First Nations and laid out the settlement of Orillia.
Transportation links with Toronto and Georgian Bay stimulated Orillia's development as a commercial centre and summer resort.
In Stephen Leacock's 1912 book Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town, Orillia was used as the basis for the fictional town known as "Mariposa". The book was based on Leacock's experiences in the town and since the book's release, the city has attempted to mimic the fictional location in as many ways as possible.
Orillia was the first municipality in North America to introduce daylight saving time and had the first municipal hydroelectric transmission plant in North America.
