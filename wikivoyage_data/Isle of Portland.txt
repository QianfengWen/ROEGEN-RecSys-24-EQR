Portland Castle
View of Portland from Weymouth
Portland is a town in Dorset, a county on the south coast of the West Country, in England.  Portland is actually an island, even though it is linked to the mainland by Chesil Beach, as Chesil Beach is a shoal beach (not a tombolo).
Many attractions and facilities are available in the nearby town of Weymouth, a short bus ride away.  The area is rapidly improving after the closure of the Naval Base in 1995.  The London 2012 Olympic sailing events were staged in Portland Harbour.


Understand[edit]
Portland has been a place of human settlement since the Stone Age.
The island is known for its stone that has been taken from the island's seven quarries and has been used to build notable structures such as the Cenotaph memorial, Buckingham Palace and St. Paul's Cathedral. In addition to being exported abroad. The island's castles, Portland Castle, Pennsylvania Castle and Rufus Castle use this local grey stone too.
Despite the island's small size, Portland has been home to three prisons: HMP Portland, HMP Verne and HMP Weare. HMP Portland is still active as a young offenders' institute.
There is a strange superstition where rabbits are considered bad luck. Use of the name may still be taboo, so the creatures are often euphemistically referred to as "underground mutton", "long-eared furry things" or just "bunnies".
