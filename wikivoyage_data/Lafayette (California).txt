Lafayette is a city of 25,000 (2020) in the East Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area in California.  It is primarily a residential town located in the hills between Berkeley and Walnut Creek, although it does offer shopping and dining, and the Lafayette Reservoir is popular with hikers.
Lafayette is home to the wealthy set. The median age is 45, and the singles scene is non-existent. Nevertheless, Lafayette attracts a variety of people for a variety of reasons. Most people come for the quiet, private atmosphere.

37.8844-122.1391 Lafayette Reservoir, 3849 Mt. Diablo Blvd. This is an awesome little park, with plenty of outdoor activities. You can walk the three mile paved trail that closely follows the shore of the lake, or you can brave the six mile dirt trail that climbs up and down the hills which form a bowl around the reservoir. Although swimming is not permitted, there is a place to rent paddleboats, which can hold four people, and are a great way to chase the ducks around! The reservoir is also a great place to spend a nice afternoon fishing or having a picnic -- there are plenty of tables, and even some great little secluded ones! Be aware, however, that at times it feels like everyone in the East Bay has decided to get their nature fix at the same time. Parking is metered and closely monitored, so bring quarters.

Orinda - A mostly residential city, Orinda does offer a movie theater that is a throwback to the golden years of cinema.
