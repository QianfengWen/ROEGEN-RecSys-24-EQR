See[edit]
Lake Powell is a destination "hot-spot" with its breathtaking scenery and welcoming environment. The lake caters to every traveler with secluded spots for relaxation and camping and deeper waters for boating, tubing, and jet-skiing. Lake Powell is also a gateway to many world-famous attractions such as Rainbow Bridge in Utah.
Antelope Canyon and Lake Powell Navajo Tribal Park[edit]
Antelope Canyon
Antelope Canyon is a "slot canyon", a narrow chasm in erosions in sandstone. Years of water and sand have rounded the edges to form curves and flowing shapes in the rock. Photographers love the beauty and unique shapes and lighting conditions of the canyons. Flash flooding still occurs in the canyon and may, at times, result in up to several months of closing. Since 1997 the area has been accessible only by permit as it is now a Navajo Tribal Park.

Entrance station hours, Coppermine Rd. (Navajo Route 20). Summer (March-Oct) 8AM-5PM. Station is closed Nov - Feb, but Lower and Upper Antelope Canyon are both open. Office Hours M-F 8AM-5PM. Entry fees: adults $8; under 8: free. No camping is allowed in the park. Access is by guided tour only.

The Horseshoe Bend[edit]
Horseshoe Bend is the name for a horseshoe-shaped meander of the Colorado River near the town of Page. The bend is locally known as "King Bend." It is slightly downstream from the Glen Canyon Dam and Lake Powell within Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, about four miles or 6 km south of Page. Accessible via a ¾-mile (1.2 km) hike from U.S. Route 89, it can be viewed from the steep cliff above. According to Google terrain maps, the overlook is 4,200 ft (1,300 m) above sea level and the Colorado River is at 3,200 ft (980 m) above sea level making it a breathtaking 1,000 ft (300 m) drop.

Glen Canyon Dam[edit]
Glen Canyon Dam is the second highest dam in the country, at 710 ft (220 m). The visitor's center, with several exhibits and interesting views, is right off of road right next to the bridge over the river. There is a guided tour of the dam, unlike most other dams. You enter the tour by descending to the top of the dam. You then descend through the dam and see the Colorado River and finally the generator room.
