Bacharach (pop 1877) is a town in the Middle Rhine Valley in the Rhineland-Palatinate region of Germany.


Understand[edit]
It is a small ancient town on the west bank of the Rhine. It existed before the Romans as a Celtic settlement. Its name Baccaracum came from the God of Bacchus as it supplied wine to the ancient territories. The medieval town is extremely well-preserved and can easily be called a hidden gem. Stahleck
Castle, which was built in the 11th Century, was initially the seat of the Archbishop of Cologne's reeves. Nowadays, it is a youth hostel overlooking the town. In the 19th century, Victor Hugo described Bacharach as one of the "world's prettiest towns".
