Thale is a town in the Harz Mountains in central Germany.


Understand[edit]
It is believed that Thale emerged at the beginning of the 10th century and was first mentioned in 936 in connection with Wendhausen abbey, however the abbey was later destroyed in 1525 due to the Peasant’s war.
Records have shown that from 1445 there was a working ironworks which was rebuilt in 1648 and it was partially destroyed during the Thirty Years War, it was completely destroyed in 1670. However it was later rebuilt in a small hammer mill due to the close proximity of the ore deposits and availability of wood, this lasted until 1714.  Thale has always had a connection with the iron industry which shows in the number of workers it had, it went from 350 in 1872 to 4,400 in 1905.  From 1916 Thale produced steel helmets and during the Second World War Thale had the monopoly on the product.
Tourism only started to flourish from the 19th century onwards this was due to the Hubertus spring which opened in 1836.
