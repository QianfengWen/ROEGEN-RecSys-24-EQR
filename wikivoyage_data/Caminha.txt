Understand[edit]
Caminha - Rua Direita, main street of the medieval old town

The population of Caminha (kuh-MEE-nyuh, /kɐ.ˈmi.ɲɐ/) in 2021 was about 15,828. The Vilar de Mouros parish is well known for the oldest rock festival in Portugal. 
Caminha is 2 km from the Atlantic Ocean, on the southern side of the Minho estuary, where this river is met by the smaller and meandering Coura. Here the Minho reaches its widest point (about 2 km) and marks the border between Portugal and Spain (Galicia). It is a scenic area, with the wide estuary marked by low-tide sandbars, a pastoral and green rural landscape, and pine forests on the slopes of the granitic mountains.

The marshes along the Coura are protected and good for bird watching.
The Atlantic beaches in the area are wide and have good sand but tend to be windy for part of the day; the Moledo beach (4 km south) attracts surfers. River and sea excursions can be arranged with local fishermen.
South of the Coura, the small granitic range ("Serra") of Arga (823 m) provides ample opportunities for hiking, cyclocrossing and canyoning. 
In the wooded northern slopes is the small monastery of S. João de Arga (popular place for picnics, camping and exploring peaks and streams; also venue for a religious festival) and the village of Castanheira (scenic terraced fields and natural pools).
