Didcot is a town in South Oxfordshire, England. If you are a rail enthusiast, you may be interested  in Didcot because it is the home of the Didcot Rail Centre (see 'See' below).


Understand[edit]
Didcot Power Station
North of the Goring Gap and south of Oxford, Oxfordshire opens out into a broad plain, overlooked from the south and east by the Berkshire Downs and the Chiltern Hills. In the midst of this plain, Didcot once stood out because of its huge coal-fired electricity generating plant, which dominated the skyline. However, it was closed in 2016 and demolished over the next few years. A natural gad-fired plant remains.
Didcot was founded because it lies at the point where the Great Western Railway's line north to Oxford and Birmingham branches off from the main line from London to Bristol and Cardiff. Since then a large military depot, now replaced by a business park, and the power station, have added to the economy.
If the above makes you think that Didcot sounds like an inappropriate destination for a tourist, you would probably be right. However, if you need to stay in Didcot because of business or personal commitments, don't despair, there are plenty of interesting places nearby (see 'Go next' below).
