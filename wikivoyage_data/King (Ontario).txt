Tourist information
History[edit]
The lands now part of the township of King were acquired by the British from the Mississauga First Nation in 1787 and 1805.
United Empire Loyalists fleeing the American Revolution settled in the area 1802, drawn by the abundant, fertile land being apportioned relatively cheaply to newcomers. 
Early settlements in the area developed primarily around gristmills and sawmills. These were important economic engines in the region during the 19th century, which resulted in the establishment of other communities and businesses nearby. By 1842, there were eight grist mills and 12 saw mills in King.

Get around[edit]
Map of King (Ontario)
King is a relatively large township, however, it is mostly rural. Getting around is usually best with a car, however, you may cycle. Bus coverage of King is limited.

Bus[edit]
York Region Transit is the main local transit agency. It operates in King, as well as neighbouring Aurora, Vaughan, and the rest of York Region. Click the link for an overview of bus service in York Region.
York Region Transit operates from 5AM to 1AM. It does depend on the route, however. It is best to check a schedule to reduce unnecessary waiting time.
The primary fare media used on the YRT is the Presto Card, which is also usable on many surrounding transit systems, on UP Express between Pearson Airport and downtown, and on GO Transit which provides regional rail and bus service (including service to Niagara Falls). Presto cards may be purchased at many local outlets, and at any staffed GO Transit station, The card costs $6.00, and can be loaded with any desired amount of money. To use the card, tap it on the green reader when entering a bus. A green light and a beep will confirm acceptance. If multiple YRT/VIVA vehicles are used to complete a one-way journey under two hours from your initial tap-on, only a single fare will be charged. Separate fares apply on other transit systems.
In King, there are few routes and one of them is dial-a-ride during off-peak hours. This means a private bus will take you along the route to your destination stop. It is necessary to pre-book such a trip 3 hours in advance.

GO Transit[edit]
There is a GO Station at 43.92-79.5271 King City GO , which is part of the Barrie Line. Going north goes to Barrie, going south goes to Union Station in Toronto. Go bus and local transit also service the station.

Taxi[edit]
Taxis are generally not found on the roads; therefore they cannot be hailed from the street. In order to acquire a taxi, it is best to pre-book a trip using a phone or using the internet.

By bicycle[edit]
It is legal to cycle on sidewalks. Due to this, it is very safe to cycle as you are separated from the vehicles. If there is no sidewalk, you may cycle on the road or on the shoulder if applicable. In addition, some roads also have bike lanes on the side of the road.
It is a provincial law that cyclists under 18 must wear a helmet, and all riders must have a bike with reflectors and a bell. This is almost never enforced due to the small number of cyclists.
All YRT/VIVA buses have easy to use bike racks, and bicycles are allowed onto the TTC subway during off-peak hours. 
Beware of right-turning vehicles when you enter an intersection. Drivers usually do not expect cyclists or pedestrians due to the low number of peds and cyclists. Therefore they may not look before they turn, as they only look for other cars.

Driving[edit]
As a rural community, driving is the easiest, fastest, and most convenient way to get around. Arterial roads are in a grid format and are 2 km apart.
Highway 400 goes north/south and is situated in between Jane Street and Weston Road. Highway 400 heads to Barrie and Sudbury north, and to Toronto's Black Creek neighbourhood south. It ends at Highway 401 on the southern end.

Stay safe[edit]
King is a very safe township. There is very little crime at all.

Pedestrians and cyclists[edit]
Beware of vehicles making right turns.

Weather[edit]
Avoid river and creek banks or bridge underpasses during periods of excessive rain, during and after heavy thundershowers or melting snow. Recent flooding can soften the soil and cause it to suddenly collapse into the water under any weight.
Occasionally, King will be hit with a severe winter storm accompanied by significant snowfall (quite often mixed with freezing rain, ice, or sleet). Avoid driving during and immediately after the storms if at all possible. This is especially true for those unfamiliar with winter driving and controlling a car in a skid. Take public transit, walk, or stay inside.

Connect[edit]
For an emergency, dial 911 (you can dial it at the payphone without inserting any coins).
King has three overlapping area codes, 905, 365 and 289. However, area codes from Toronto (416, 437, 647) are common in King. As a result, King has 10-digit local dialling. You must always dial the area code as part of the number you are trying to reach.

Internet[edit]
Internet is available at King Township Public Library.

Newspapers[edit]
The King Weekly Sentinel is the local newspaper. However, it is beaten in popularity by news coming from Toronto.
