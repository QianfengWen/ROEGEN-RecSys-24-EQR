Great Cumbrae is an island in the Firth of Clyde off the coast of Ayrshire, with Millport as its only settlement, and a population of 1376 in 2011. The island is about 3 miles long by 1½ miles wide, roughly tooth-shaped, with a broad bay indenting its south coast. It's low-lying and agricultural; Millport is a traditional "Glasgow Riviera" resort but is quiet and little developed compared to Ayrshire's other coastal towns.
Little Cumbrae a mile south across the channel of "The Tan" is rocky and barren. It's nowadays a private yoga retreat.
Cumbrae or Cumaradh means "place of the Cymric people" - so they spoke a P-Celtic language similar to Old Welsh, until this was replaced by the Q-Celtic of Gaelic.
