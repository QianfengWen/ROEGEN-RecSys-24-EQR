The main beach at Padang Bai
Padang Bai (also Padangbai and Padang Bay) is a small port town in East Bali.


Understand[edit]
Most visitors to Padang Bai are there to catch a boat to Lombok. However, it is a charming little place in its own right and many people cancel their trip in order to spend more time in this lovely village. Spending a night or two here will certainly not be time wasted.
There is good diving and snorkeling in the immediate area, and a number of operators are present to cater for those activities.  This is also a fairly convenient base from which to explore some of the wider attractions of East Bali. Accommodation tends to be quite basic and aimed at the backpacker market, although 3 stars villa is also available. The serenity of Padang Bai is suitable for old citizens or who want quiet place, no nightlife here.

Get in[edit]
Map of Padang Bai
By car[edit]
If you don't want to go to Lombok, rental car maybe is the best option. Rental car can be reserved online and picked up and returned at Ngurah Rai International Airport. Many rental cars now use Low Cost Green Car for Rp 150,000-175,000 per day with capacity maximum for 4 passengers including driver seats. The car Daihatsu Ayla and Toyota Agya is suitable for 2 persons with maximum 170 cm height and 2 children. Indonesia fuel price is relatively cheap and the cars run 15 to 20 km/L.

By taxi[edit]
Padang Bai is about 90 minutes by taxi from Ngurah Rai International Airport and a pre-paid coupon costs Rp 400,000.
Padang Bai is 54 km east from Denpasar and takes about 1 hour to 90 minutes to drive from the southern tourist areas of Kuta and Legian.

By bus[edit]
 Perama (The Perama office in Padang Bai is at Dona Restaurant, Jl Pelabuhan, near the jetty), ☏ +62 363 41419. The national tour bus company has Padang Bai in its network. They will pick you up from your accommodation in many areas of Bali and take you to your destination. Perama shuttle buses to Padang Bai leave from Kuta, Sanur, Ubud, Candidasa and Lovina. Reserve one day in advance as it seems only on-demand, minimum 2 persons. Padang Bai-Sanur/Kuta Rp 125,000 (13:30). (updated Jun 2024)
By bemo[edit]
Bemos may ply the main east coast route between Klungkung, Padang Bai and Candidasa. Bemos routed through Padang Bai leave from Batubulan terminal in Denpasar.
Bemos and minibuses arrive at, and depart from, the port entrance; orange bemos from Amlapura (25 km, Rp 30,000) via Candidasa, blue or white bemos from Klungkung and pale-brown minibuses for Amlapura or Batubulan terminal in Denpasar.
As of June 2024, it is more difficult to get one. If you try, be patient and have a fallback (hitchhike - lots of traffic on the main road, mostly trucks and tourist cars, or taxi/grab/gojek).

By boat[edit]
There are slow public ferries from Lembar (Lombok) every hour, 24 hours a day.  The trip normally takes four hours (but it can be considerably longer in poor weather) and costs Rp 36,000. Ferry staff often offer their private room to tourists for an extra Rp 50,000. The room is clean and comfortable with 2 or 3 beds. It should be understood that this ferry has a poor safety record. There is a ticket office, waiting area and small cafe adjacent to the pier.
There are fast boat services from the Gili Islands via Teluk Kode (Lombok) to Padang Bai. Operators have been coming and going, but one constant has been the Gili Cat service for Rp 660,000 one way. Travel time is 2 hours. Gili Cat leaves Padang Bai daily at 09:00 and arrives at Teluk Kode (Lombok) at 10:00 and at Gili Trawangan Harbour at 10:30. In high season there's also a departure at 14:00.
There is another boat service from Sampalan at Nusa Penida to Padang Bai. Travel time is about one hour.

Get around[edit]
Everything in town is within walking distance (1-2 km). If you want to explore the surrounding area, motorbike rental and car rental are widely available. You can go on a one day tour to Candidasa, Tirta Gangga, Taman Ujung (Edge Sukasada Park), and see sunset at Lempuyang Temple.

Go next[edit]
Padang Bai functions as the gateway to Lombok and the Gilis for those traveling by boat.

Public ferry[edit]
Slow ferries go to Lembar on Lombok (Rp 40,000) and Nusa Penida (Rp 36,000). Book at the larger pier inside the harbor.

Fast boat[edit]
Virtually everyone in town will try and sell you fast boat tickets. During low season (Oct 2014) pricing appears to be extremely flexible. Posted prices can be up to Rp 660,000 for a one-way trip to the Gilis, but you may be able to negotiate open-ended return trip tickets for Rp 333,333. Prices during high season are likely much less negotiable.

Combined bus & boat tickets[edit]
Many operators offer combined tickets including both the slow ferry to Lembar and a follow up bus transfer on Lombok, e.g. to Senggigi (Rp 100,000) or Kuta Lombok (Rp 200,000). Such combined Tickets are also a cheap alternative to the fast but expensive speed boats to Gili (ferry to Lembar, bus transfer to Bangsal, ferry to Gili Air/Meno/Trawangan; Rp 150,000).

See[edit]
Bias Tegul beach at Padang Bai
Beaches[edit]
The main beach is generally awash with colorful double outrigger fishing boats in the shape of a marlin. The front of the boat is shaped with the point of its mouth open wide and large eyes looking to the heavens. Either side of the main beach are two other hidden coves with nice, quiet white sand beaches.

-8.53016115.513491 Blue Lagoon Beach (Facing to the sea (south) turn to the left until end of Silayukti street, head east on foot over the prominent headland at the eastern end of the main bay. Follow the signs that say Blue Lagoon Beach (not resort).). A great beach for snorkeling, despite the narrow one hundred meters length. The beach is unique in color; the sandy beach is not always white, but sometimes changes to rather black. If the current comes from the west, the beach will be white, but if the current comes from the east, it will be black and white. The coral reef goes right up to the shore and is very pretty with clown fishes and small sepia. Enter on the far left side, where there is a coral-less canal leading to the snorkeling site. There are two restaurants with reasonable food (fried rice, fried noodle, omelette, sandwiches and spirits), showers (only for restaurant guests), chairs, sunbeds, and snorkeling gear. (updated Aug 2017)
-8.5364115.50912 Bias Tugal Beach (White Sand Beach) (From the police station, walk 100 m up the hill. Directly after Bamboo Paradise turn left (there's a sign that says Bias Tegul) and climb the steep hill along a construction road for about 5 minutes and then descend.). A beautiful white sandy beach and the best beach in Padang Bai. It's wider than Blue Lagoon Beach and good for swimming, though the currents can be strong. There are about five warungs, serving simple Indonesian dishes, juices and beer. From the path to the beach, you should be able to see the largest mountain on Bali, Mount Agung — a powerful sight. (updated Aug 2017)
Temples[edit]
Ceremony at Silayukti Temple
Silayukti Temple
If you need a break from the beaches, there are some temples to discover. Although not particularly famous, these temples are nevertheless worth a visit. Padang Bai has five major temples: Pura Dalem, downtown, Pura Segara, next to the beach in between town and the main beach, Pura Telagamas, Pura Silayukti and Pura Tanjungsari in the eastern end of Padang Bai. Don't forget to bring a sarong and a sash.

-8.532287115.5128913 Pura Silayukti (Walk along the beach road to the end and up around the headland.). Once the home of the great Hindu sage Empu Kuturan and dating back to the 11th century, making it one of the oldest extant temples on the island. (updated Jul 2017)
Do[edit]
Ocean activities are the way to go.  There is good snorkeling in the bay, though the snorkeling at the Blue Lagoon is even better. Many of the local dive operators organize trips to this spot but you can easily walk to your destination. If the waves are large, don't bother snorkeling as the visibility will be minimal. On a calm day, expect great visibility and lots of fish. Buoys mark the farthest point snorkelers should go. For even better snorkeling you can charter a boat.
