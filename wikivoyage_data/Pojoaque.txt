Pojoaque (pronounced poh-WAH-kay) is a small town in north central New Mexico, USA, not far from Santa Fe.  While of limited interest itself to the traveler, it is a good jumping-off point for many northern New Mexico attractions.


Get in[edit]
Map of Pojoaque
Pojoaque is about 15 miles north of Santa Fe on US highway 285.  The nearest major commercial air service is via Albuquerque, while Santa Fe has limited air service.

Get around[edit]
Once you've been there, you've gotten around.  A car is useful for reaching outlying attractions.

See[edit]
Pojoaque Pueblo is one of the smaller of the American Indian pueblos of New Mexico, but does have a casino (see under "Drink") and a moderately interesting tribal museum.
The Poeh Cultural Center is on US 285 and appears to be open during daylight hours (probably 9-5), with exhibits by local artisans.  The museum's position on historic interactions between Native Americans and European settlers, it is fair to say, is opinionated.  Occasional special events.
Do[edit]
Buy[edit]
Pojoaque Pueblo is less significant as an arts/crafts center than nearby San Ildefonso and Santa Clara Pueblos, but interesting pueblo art can sometimes be found at the museum.

The guacamole appetizer is fantastic, as are the fajitas. Dinner with guacamole and sangria will cost $25 or so. The art gallery across the parking lot is worth a look too, when you're done with your meal. 
Drink[edit]
35.891034-106.0206631 Cities of Gold Casino, Cities of Gold Road (frontage road off US 285), ☏ +1 505 455-3313. The creation of casinos at Native American pueblos and reservations during the 1990s was controversial, and many locals resent the fact that operations like this one exist, citing serious problems with gambling addictions in the community — while others point with pride to the revenue it has created for the town and pueblo. Like it or not, it's there, and you can find a drink, some entertainment, and a chance to lose your earnings on site. Alcohol is served and the bartenders will sure likely to get you real drunk.

Go next[edit]
Pojoaque is about equidistant from Santa Fe and Los Alamos with nearby Bandelier National Monument.  Los Alamos and Bandelier are both interesting and worth a day trip; Santa Fe is one of the world's great travel destinations, and a traveler who comes to Pojoaque but doesn't spend time in Santa Fe is missing something.
Pojoaque is also a reasonable jumping-off point for the American Indian (incidentally, the term is preferred locally to "Native American") pueblos of the region; check the Santa Fe (New Mexico) and North Central New Mexico articles for details.
The High Road to Taos is one of the classic scenic drives in northern New Mexico and takes off from Pojoaque via SR 503 on the north side of town.  For route details, see the North Central New Mexico article.
