Playa Zicatela
Puerto Escondido is a town in Oaxaca on the Oaxaca-Pacific coastline. It's known for its big waves and excellent surfing conditions. "Escondido" means "hidden", but in a well-connected world that's no longer true. Once considered a well-kept secret, "Puerto" has grown into a sometimes-awkward mix of small industrial city, beach destination, backpacker party mecca, and French expat community. 
In early 2024, a new high-speed highway opened between Oaxaca and Puerto Escondido, cutting travel times between the two to just three hours, and causing an explosion of visitors to Puerto Escondido, with the Semana Santa holidays overwhelming the town's infrastructure and, sadly, its beach cleanup volunteers. Due to the rapidly changing situation, be aware that a lot of this article might be out-of-date!
Though less walkable than beach towns like Mazunte or Zipolite, Puerto Escondido retains some appeal for its newfound nearness to Oaxaca city by bus or car, its good surfing, its party scene, and its slightly more scenic beaches, which are surrounded by green vegetation year-round, compared to drier areas Mazunte and Huatulco where the forest loses most of its leaves in the dry season.


Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
15.876667-97.0888891 Puerto Escondido International Airport (PXM  IATA) (is very close to town), ☏ +52 951 516 4982. Four daily flights from Benito Juárez International Airport (MEX IATA) in Mexico City.   (updated May 2022)
Another alternative is flying into Huatulco (HUX IATA) and taking a taxi to Puerto Escondido (~90-min drive, US$50-60 if you negotiate in advance).
Shared taxis (called colectivos) from the Puerto Escondido airport are cheap - about M$35 per person- and reasonably quick. The airport is close to town, but you may have to wait a few minutes as the colectivo driver waits to get a few more passengers, or drops one or two off ahead of you.

By bus[edit]
TuriStar and Estrella Blanca [formerly dead link]  from Mexico City are the most comfortable and most expensive way to get here (M$500-900, 12 hours), traveling via Acapulco. These buses only leave from the South (Taxqueña) bus terminal. Other first class buses leave from both the North and South terminals, traveling via Puebla and/or Oaxaca City, and taking several hours longer than the buses via Acapulco.
More comfortable but longer are the buses leaving from the 2nd class bus station. Do not take a 1st class bus because the trip is over 15 hours – it takes the longest route. 2nd class buses take around 7-8 hours. There are also many buses from Acapulco. For example, the AltaMar bus line leaves from the Ejido terminal 7 times a day and takes 7-8 hours.

By shuttle van[edit]
A less expensive and faster alternative to the bus, two shuttle van companies do multiple daily runs between Puerto Escondido and Oaxaca (city). The very scenic route winds directly through the mountains with hairpin curves and takes about 6-7 hours depending on road conditions. Passengers who are inclined to get car sick should definitely take motion sickness tablets. There is a toilet and snack break about midway.

15.86362-97.068832 Servicio Express (Express Service), Av 1a Norte s/n (ground floor of Hotel Luz del Ángel, on the corner of Av Oaxaca), ☏ +52 951-516-40-59. Hourly from 04:00-23:00. Offers daily service in 15-seat vans. M$209. 
15.86315-97.07073 Transporte Villa del Pacifico, Av. Hidalgo No.5 (between 2a Poniente and Tercera Ponienta, next to Cuff Minimart), ☏ +52 954 103 3134, lauren.zarate@hotmail.com. Hourly from 03:30-23:30. Offers daily service in 15-seat vans. M$170. (updated Apr 2023)
By car[edit]
Highway 200 between Puerto Escondido and Acapulco is in fair-to-good condition and can be confidently driven with reasonable care - but watch for speed bumps. Highway 131, the direct road to Oaxaca, is in mediocre-to-poor condition, especially west of the mountains where the rains often wash away the highway. Do not attempt this road after nightfall, as there are sudden craters where the surface has slid away down the hillside, and it will be a serious accident if you tumble down after. Reckon 6 or 7 hours, do not hurry even though local traffic often overtakes you - they know where the booby-traps are.

Get around[edit]

Bus[edit]
Frequent local buses (urbanos) ply the main roads. There is no route map, but all buses have their destination painted on the windscreen and pass through the 15.86181-97.067251 crucero (at the intersection of Carr. Costera and Av. Oaxaca). The fare is M$5 (Sep 2014) for a single ride, no transfers.

Taxi[edit]
The fixed price for a taxi in town is M$30-50 (Sep 2014) for the airport and Bacocho beach. Night rates are M$35 (Sep 2014). Some taxis will charge more than the going rate if you do not specify M$30 before the ride. A taxi from the airport to Punta Zicatela should cost you M$200 (Nov 2021), although this very much depends upon your Spanish negotiating skills and will often cost significantly more. You may be able to hire a cab driver for the day for about M$800 (Jan 2008).
Shared taxis (colectivos) travel along fixed routes that can be difficult to decipher, but all tend to travel through the crucero in El Centro and can be easily caught along the main road by giving a wave. The fixed price is M$10 (Nov 2021) within town.

Car[edit]
There are lots of great spots to visit if you have a vehicle, such as the nearby lagoon of Chacahua, the nudist beach of Zipolite, beach towns like Puerto Angel and Huatulco, all within two hours of Puerto Escondido.

Budget Rent-A-Car, charge hefty rental fees for their fleet of subcompact manual transmission cars. They may also have some minivans available.
See[edit]
The sunset above La Punta
Watch the sunset above La Punta - walk to the southern end of La Punta beach and walk around the cliff to a small rocky beach. From here you will see a lighthouse on the left and a small rocky hill on the right. Walk to the rocky hill and make the simple climb to the grassy top. From the top you will have a great view of the sunset and both beaches to your right and left. If the tide is high, you will not be able to walk around the cliff however there is a small path above it which you can follow. Be sure to bring some beers with you.
Do[edit]
Surf[edit]
Surfing at Punta Zicatela
You can take lessons if you're a beginner – try one of the friendly surf instructors on any beach or at one of the surf shops. Female instructors are available for those who may find the roaming hands of some of the male instructors a bit more than just being friendly.

15.8432-97.05091 Playa Zicatela. This is the location of the famous Mexican Pipeline, with several international surfing competitions being held here annually. This beach is only for expert surfers and very strong swimmers; even experienced surfers have been injured here, and many people have drowned. The southern end of the beach near Punta Zicatela has consistently good waves. If you don't surf, you should at least make it over to the beach restaurant Los Tios and have a beer on the beach while you watch people surfing in the sunset. This is also a good place from which to watch over breakfast when there's a surf competition on. 
Swim[edit]
Playa Carrizalillo
Playa Principal
15.85959-97.078642 Playa Carrizalillo. The most scenic and safest beach for swimming is Playa Carrizalillo. Take a taxi unless you want a half-hour walk. Carrizalillo is small, gorgeous, and not too crowded, 167 steps from street level down to the beach (then back up again). There are some surfers and some boats, but mainly swimmers enjoying the waves. This is a good beach for swimming or learning surfing with few restaurants. (updated Jan 2022)
15.8581-97.07313 Playa Manzanillo. A good, pleasant beach for swimming, with a few beachside restaurants with loungers. Visitors can use the loungers for free provided they purchase a drink or food from the restaurant. The rocky area between this beach and neighboring Playa Puerto Angelito is probably the best place in town for snorkeling - sea turtles and stingrays can often be seen here. 
15.8597-97.0614 Playa Principal. This beach is good for swimming and boogie boarding, and very popular with locals. 
Scuba dive[edit]
You're in the Pacific for heaven's sake. If you don't try scuba-diving here then where? And Pacific Mexico is an example of a place where diving really scores over just snorkeling. That said, do check on day-to-day conditions - sometimes the Pacific really isn't terrific, as storms far out to sea can kick up the visibility. But when it's good, it's great.

 Deep Blue (dive shack is within Hotel Ines on Playa Zicatela beach strip). Two-tank dive US$70, single dive $40. 
Other activities[edit]
Cascada de la reforma
 Temazcal. Try an indigenous type of steam-bath known as a temazcal. Sit in a small building with heats that go up to 49°C and then either be covered in towels or dunked into cold water. 
 Boat trip. One of the most exhilarating experiences for non-surfers is the boat trip into the ocean to catch a glimpse of the wildlife; in particular, the turtles and dolphins. A few tour operators run similar trips out into the Pacific in search of the animals. More often than not, you get a glimpse of the turtles and, if you're lucky enough, the tour guide sometimes jumps in and catches hold of one! Unperturbed, the creatures come onto the boat for some photos and free food courtesy of the tour guide. It's kind of surreal, but incredible. Less often, you will get to see the packs of dolphins arching over the surface. Again, it is an amazing experience and well worth the money. About M$300 on average. 
 Fishing. Another good ocean-based activity is the regular fishing trips you can go on. For the keen fisherman, this is a dream activity. The waters host vast amounts of species of fish including tuna, marlin and red snapper. It isn't the cheapest (some operators can charge around M$1,000) but you can sometimes get a deal that your catch gets cooked at a local restaurant for your eating pleasure in with the cost. 
 Skydiving. During the high seasons you can do a sky dive at the Zicatela beach for M$2600. It's one of the nicest places in the world to do this. They're just left of Café Babylon. 
 Cascada de la reforma. Cool down from the heat in Puerto Escondido in a waterfall located about one hour outside Puerto Escondido. There are tours which will take you all the way but it's a bit inaccessible due to quality of the road. The waterfall offers basins in which it's possible to swim and a simple restaurant which serves local food. 
 Turtle sanctuary. From July to September thousands upon thousands of olive ridley sea turtles wade ashore to lay their eggs at Playa Escobilla, between Puerto Escondido and Mazunte. Prices vary, and you can shop around, but from Puerto Escondido day trips normally cost around M$500. Regardless of your tour operator, you will be escorted by a friendly but watchful local guide. 
 Lagunas de Chacahua National Park (about 45 miles west of Puerto Escondido). Coastal area with 5 lagoons, sandy Pacific beaches, dense mangrove swamps, a Mixteco archaeological site, a crocodile nursery, and more. Small hotels and waterfront restaurants are in the area. To get there from Puerto Escondido, use a colectivo going toward Rio Grande. Tell the driver you going to Chacahua National Park and need to exit at El Zapotalito. (updated May 2023)

Sleep[edit]
Beachside accommodation near Punta Zicatela
As of April 2024, a basic hotel room in the city center (not at the beach) starts from about 400 without air conditioning, 600 with air conditioning, and 800 with air conditioning and a pool (not all hotels appear on online hotel aggregators, though hostels do, and all are generally a bit cheaper if booked in person). Nicer accommodations and beach hotels will obviously cost more, though there are also rustic, non-AC cabañas right on the beach starting from around 300 pesos, and similarly basic hostels near the beach for around 200 pesos per dorm bed. Farther from the beach, 200 pesos can get you can get a hostel bed with nighttime air conditioning and a pool (likely both needed during the hotter months). Most areas of town are no more than a short drive or taxi ride (40-100 pesos) from the beaches, but that can mean up to 30-60 minutes by foot.

Stay safe[edit]
Due to assaults and knife-point robberies, the beaches should be avoided from dusk until dawn; this especially applies to Playa Principal and Playa Bachoco. If you do not have a companion with you, it is best to not carry valuables on some of the more isolated stretches of beach even during the daytime. As of 2024, police are also known to stop tourists on the beach late at night and "confiscate" valuables.
And of course, be aware of water safety if swimming at the beaches. The surf can be pretty rough (hence the good surfing), and currents have been reported from some areas.

Connect[edit]
Connectivity in Puerto Escondido is surprisingly poor for a city of its size and growing popularity. As general rule, internet service gets worse the farther you are from El Centro. For example, in Punta Zicatela connections can be quite spotty, particularly on weekends during the high season when demand often exceeds capacity. Locations nearer to the center are not exempt from poor service, however, and even the city’s mobile data network has been known to fail for hours at a time. Should you find yourself in dire internet straits, usually your best bet is to change locations within the city. There are several internet cafes and coworking spaces available, including:

15.86337-97.072462 Casa Losodeli & Coworking, Prolongación 2a. norte s/n, ☏ +52 954 177 5430. A popular cafe, coworking space and hostel in El Centro. (updated Nov 2021)
15.85746-97.058033 Selina Puerto Escondido, Av. Del Morro 4, Playa Zicatela, ☏ +52 954 137 7020. A hostel on Playa Zicatela with a cafe and coworking space. (updated Nov 2021)
Telcel has the best mobile coverage in the area, although it drops off quickly as you leave the central city. Expect one or two bars at best in Punta Zicatela. You can buy a SIM card at various locations around town. Typically the most convenient for tourists (as opposed to locals and businesses) is the Telcel store located on Av. Oaxaca across from the Chedraui supermarket.
As of April 2024, some hostels have Starlink internet, which is generally faster but still not perfectly reliable.

Go next[edit]
Mazunte - A nearby town with less tourism than Puerto Escondido and quiet beaches, on the Pacific Coast Backpacker Route. Famous for its National Sea Turtle Museum.
Zipolite Mexico's only "official" nude beach. Popular since the 1960s and still has its hippy vibe. A beach where you loose track of time.
Lagunas de Chacahua National Park - Good for surfing and for bird watching, as well as exploring the mangroves with a guide by canoe. It's best to spend the night there so that you can take the canoe trip at sunset.
