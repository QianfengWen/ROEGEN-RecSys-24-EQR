Chelsea is a municipality of 7,500 people (2016) in Outaouais. From Ottawa, it is just beyond Gatineau and many Chelsea residents commute to one of those cities for work.


Understand[edit]
While 60% of the area is in Gatineau Park, much of the rest of Chelsea is residential with mostly large lots, and tracts of undeveloped land. It has a distinctly rural feel. The population of Chelsea is almost evenly divided between anglophones and francophones and both English and French languages are in common use throughout the town.
The municipality has a reputation for being environmentally responsible and was one of the first in Canada to ban the use of pesticides. 
Chelsea is named after the Vermont town of its first settler, Thomas Brigham. The name has been in use since the early 19th century.

Get in[edit]
From Hull, take Highway 5 north (to exit 12 or 13) or head north on St. Joseph Blvd (Highway 105) past the Alonzo Wright Bridge.
Chelsea is also accessible via Notch Road, from Mountain Road North (chemin de la Montagne Nord).
A taxi from Ottawa would cost $30-45 (Dec 2018).
STO city buses #27, 33 and 35 leave Ottawa from the corner of Wellington and Bank Streets and travel through Gatineau to the de la Cité-des-Jeunes/du Plein-Air stop frequently ($4, 40 min). From there a taxi will take you to Chelsea for $14-18 (Dec 2018).
