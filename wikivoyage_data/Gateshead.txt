Gateshead is a town in Tyne and Wear in the northeast of England. It stands on the south bank of the River Tyne looking across to Newcastle upon Tyne on the north bank. It's industrial and in 2011 had a population of 120,046. It was historically in County Durham, but in 1974 became part of the metropolis of Tyne and Wear. 


Understand[edit]
The view across the Tyne to Gateshead


“

No true civilisation could have produced such a town…, it was designed "by an enemy of the human race"

”


—JB Priestly, English Journey 1934

Gateshead stands on a hill on the south bank of the River Tyne and was industrial from the 14th century through coal mining. This was sufficiently lucrative for the north bank city of Newcastle to attempt a takeover; but the coal was from shallow bell-pits that soon became unworkable, where upon Newcastle's interest waned. The main deep-mining belt was south towards Durham, and those pit owners became stinking rich, while Gateshead developed metal-bashing and other traditional smokestack industries. It never had much architectural heritage, and that little was blown away by the great fire and explosion of 1854 when a burning worsted mill set off sulphur and other combustibles in a nearby warehouse. So great were the devastation, the deaths and the mutilation of survivors, that special trains had to be laid on for all the thousands of trippers thronging to enjoy the spectacle.
Gateshead was further assaulted in the 20th century by industrial decline and by modern "brutalist" architecture. However, in the 21st century, it was revived, along with Newcastle, by attractive developments. Sage and the Baltic Gallery are on the riverfront near the Millennium Bridge, and The Angel of the North stands guard by the motorway from the south.

Map of the Tyne and Wear Metro
Gateshead is on both lines of the Tyne and Wear Metro:

The Green Line runs from the airport via Jesmond, Newcastle city centre and Central Station to Gateshead, then heads south to Sunderland.
The Yellow Line makes a grand loop from the city centre around the north bank towns and burbs, circles back to Jesmond, the city centre, Central Station, Gateshead and Heworth, then follows the south riverbank to Jarrow and South Shields.
Trains run every 10–15 min between 5:30AM and 11:30PM. Gateshead is in Fare Zone A, so in 2022, an adult single from the city centre is £2.30. The airport is in Zone C so that's £3.90.
