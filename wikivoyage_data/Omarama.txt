Omarama is a small town in the Mackenzie Country of New Zealand's South Island that has more gliders parked in hangars than families tucked up safe at home. That's because it's one of the best places on the planet for setting sailplane records.
Its world famous gliding centre, where scenic glider flights into the Southern Alps are available, as well as a pilot training school, is 30 km south of Twizel and 100 km south of Mount Cook.
