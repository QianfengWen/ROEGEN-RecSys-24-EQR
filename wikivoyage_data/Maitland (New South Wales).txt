Heritage Mall, Maitland
Maitland (population 90,226 in 2021) is a city in the Lower Hunter Valley region of New South Wales. It's sometimes considered a part of Greater Newcastle, or even a northwestern suburb of Newcastle. Nevertheless, the state's fifth largest city is a destination of its own, and a very different destination from Newcastle.


Understand[edit]
Maitland sits on the banks of the Hunter River, a 30-minute train ride or 30-km drive from Newcastle. Since its foundation as a village at the tidal limit of the Hunter River, its use for the shipping of goods along the river has dwindled. Nonetheless, as is evident in Morpeth and the CBD, the Hunter River has maintained its connection to Maitland ever since West Maitland was founded in 1820.
Being a city built upon the river, Maitland is frequently inundated with destructive flooding. The flood of 1955 is one of the worst in Maitland's history, and flash flooding occurred again in 2007 and 2015.
