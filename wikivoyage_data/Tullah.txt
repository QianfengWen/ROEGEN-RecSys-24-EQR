Tullah Tavern
Tullah is a small town of 202 (2021) in West Coast Tasmania, surrounded by Lake Roseberry and Lake Mackintosh and impressive mountains that form a part of the West Coast Range.
From an outsider's perspective, Tullah might seem small – and while it certainly is small, it's one of the four major settlements on West Coast Tasmania (with Zeehan, Strahan, and Queenstown being the other three – Roseberry is too insignificant to be considered one). It's very laidback, even more so compared to Strahan or Queenstown, but it has become more of a quick stopover point for those travelling on the A10. 


Understand[edit]
Get in[edit]
Tullah is on the Murchison Highway (A10), and is only accessible via road. Before the 1960s, Tullah was only accessible by rail, but today, it's only accessible by road.
It's 52 km southwest of Cradle Mountain (via C132), 14 km northeast of Roseberry, 43 km from Zeehan and 84 km from Strahan (via B27). Assume that you're averaging 60 km/h – meaning it'll take you roughly 40–45 minutes from Zeehan, per se. Although the speed limit is 100 km/h (62 mph), the windy nature of the road means that you won't be able to travel that speed.
