Suwon[dead link] (수원, 水原) is a city in the southern central part of Gyeonggi-do. As the provincial capital, it is the political, economic and administration center of Gyeonggi-do. Major subway lines and expressways connect to Suwon, making it a transportation hub. Additionally, despite its population exceeding one million since 2002, Suwon had been subject to the same administrative regulations as other local districts, facing difficulties in providing various services. Therefore, it has recently been granted the status of Suwon special case city, enabling it to enjoy a broader range of services.
Major attractions are Suwon Hwaseong, a UNESCO World Heritage site, and the headquarters of Samsung Electronics.
