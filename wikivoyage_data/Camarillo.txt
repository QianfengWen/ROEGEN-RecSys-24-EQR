Camarillo is served by frequent Amtrak California and Metrolink Commuter Rail service from San Diego, Orange County, Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley to the south and San Luis Obispo to the north. The station is at the intersection of Lewis Road and Ventura Road at one end of Old Town.  It is near many restaurants, a wonderful Saturday morning farmer's market and approximately 1.4 miles (2.2 km) from the famous Camarillo Premium Outlets. Most visitors however arrive by car as the US 101 Freeway runs directly through the center of Camarillo. Camarillo Airport FAA LID: CMA is a big general aviation hub.

Get around[edit]
Camarillo has the CAT (Camarillo Area Transit) bus service. The fixed routes are limited, but they have a dial-a-ride service that will pick you up and take you anywhere in the city for $2. A car or bicycle are the only practical ways to get around, however.  Walking Camarillo's wide boulevards is nice if you want to experience the city that was rated number 2 in the world for weather, the clean air and numerous parks but you won't get very far in the spread-out city.

Drink[edit]
Camarillo is generally a suburban bedroom community and what bar scene there is generally dominated by locals.  Chuy's Restaurant is probably your best bet with The Clubhouse also an option.  Don't bother with the lone nightclub in Camarillo which has gone through multiple name changes and is still unpopular with anyone over 22.
