Gibsons is a coastal community of 4,600 (2016) on the lower Sunshine Coast in British Columbia, Canada. It is the main marine gateway to the Sunshine Coast.


Understand[edit]
Gibsons Harbour
Although Gibsons is on the British Columbia mainland, the Sunshine Coast is not accessible by road. Vehicle access is by BC Ferries from Horseshoe Bay in West Vancouver, a 40-minute crossing or a ferry from Vancouver Island. Gibsons is best known in Canada as the setting of the popular and long running CBC Television series The Beachcombers, which aired from 1972 to 1990. The storefront "Molly's Reach", now a cafe, the restored tug Persephone, and a display about the series at the Sunshine Coast Museum and Archives are popular Gibsons attractions. Gibsons is a popular retirement destination, and has also attracted many artists and musicians.

The town was established in 1886 by George Gibson and his sons. It was incorporated in 1929 as "Gibson's Landing", and in 1947 the name was changed to "Gibsons" at the request of the residents. The town is now split between the seaside area known as "Lower Gibsons" and "Upper Gibsons. "Lower Gibsons" is mostly residential, but also has shops and restaurants that cater mostly to vacationers. "Upper Gibsons", which is clustered along Highway 101, contains the commercial areas of town, including Sunnycrest Mall, the town's two major supermarkets, and a variety of fast food restaurants.
