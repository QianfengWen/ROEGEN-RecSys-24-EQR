Battambang (Khmer: ក្រុងបាត់ដំបង) with about 150,000 people (2016), is Cambodia's second most populous city, and a popular tourist destination due to the nearby ancient temples, the circus and the bamboo railway. It is the capital of Battambang Province.


Understand[edit]
Despite being Cambodia's second largest city, Battambang is often overlooked in favor of the more popular Siem Reap and Phnom Penh. Battambang is quieter, less commercial and cheaper, and provides an opportunity to see a slightly less Westernized Cambodian city. Remnants of French colonial architecture can be spotted around the city, and there are food and lodging options that will cater to most budgets and tastes.

By train[edit]
13.097868103.1945391 Battambang (Royal Railway) Station, ☏ +855 99457626. There is one daily rail connection between Phnom Penh and Battambang (and back). Cost is around 8 USD. Reports of a bumpy ride are exaggerated. Lack of aircon may be a problem at midday in the hot season, but there are fans and a constant breeze from the wide-open windows. Otherwise, the train has far better views than the bus, is safer, greener, possibly cheaper and probably faster. It is the best way to travel between the capital and Battambang.   (updated Dec 2023)

The return journey starts at 15:00.

By boat[edit]
One boat a day travels from Siem Reap (for Angkor) to Battambang, departing Siem Reap at 07:00 and costs US$20. An interesting and very scenic journey along small rivers, the boat threads its way through numerous charming floating villages and past dozens of towering cantilevered fishing net installations. It can take between 6–12 hours, depending on the time of year (and hence the water level), however the time can be fairly accurately predicted by checking the time that the same boat arrived yesterday.
During the dry season, when the water level gets very low, the boats cannot get all the way to Battambang, and the journey is completed by minibus or pick-up truck.

Get around[edit]
On foot[edit]
The city center is pretty compact and can be mostly explored by foot. Unhappily, the locals have named the main cross-street 'Pub Street', after that in Siem Reap it doesn't resemble at all.

By bicycle or motorbike[edit]
Bicycles can be rented from most hotels or private companies for US$1-2 per day. Motorbikes can be rented from US$5 a day. The driving habits of locals are hazardous. Police may try to fine tourists on motorbikes. If pulled over, stay calm, smile, take the key out of the ignition (to prevent the police trying to ransom it), and pay a small fine of US$1–2.

By taxi[edit]
Tuk-tuks and motorbike drivers hang around popular tourist areas. As most of the interesting and useful destinations are quite close to each other, most rides should only cost you US$2–4. More distant trips like Phnom Sampouv (the "killing caves") will cost around US$10, and can be combined with other destinations for a total of US$12–15.
Don't be too stingy with tips. Tuk tuk and motorcycle taxi guys make barely enough to live, especially in the low season.

By boats[edit]
Small boats serve as ferries (500 riel) and cross the river from in front of the market.

See[edit]
13.11192103.185571 Battambang Circus, Phare Ponleu Selpak (10 min journey by tuk-tuk from the centre of Battambang), ☏ +855 77554413, +855 93554413, reservations@phareps.org. Probably the most interesting thing happening in Battambang. You can check their website for the schedule or find the calendar printed on flyers around town. The shows are fun, energetic and exciting and include a range of circus disciplines. The ticket price helps support the NGO school which works with disadvantaged children and teenagers. US$16. (updated Jan 2024)Phnom Sampeou
13.01885103.0976312 Phnom Sampeu. A hill with the killing caves of the Khmer Rouge, a few others caves adorned with Buddhist statues, and a monastery with two Buddhist stupas on the hilltop. The admission charge also includes Wat Banan. It takes about 1 hr to climb the circuit to the monastery on top, with a short-cut leading back down to the shops and restaurants which line the approach road. US$3.  
 Statues. Battambang is known for its statues, which seemingly decorate every public place. Most are of animals (mythical and real) and divinities. The most famous of these statues is on the main road in from Phnom Penh and is of an ancient Khmer King holding a stick which he used to quell rebellions in the Battambang area. The name of the town and province derives from this legend. 
12.951092103.1397773 Wat Banan. The so-called mini-Angkor Wat, an impressive flight of stairs lead up to a dilapidated Angkor-style temple which is still in use as a Buddhist shrine.   
 Wat Baydamram. A temple where hundreds of fruit bats live in trees under the protection of the Buddhist monks. Wat Ek Phnom
13.162745103.1882184 Wat Ek Phnom (about 10 km northwest of Battambang). Angkor-type temple ruin. The road runs along lovely small rivers flanked by trees and small villages making it a generally nice area. Approaching Wat Ek Phnom, you suddenly encounter a giant Buddha statue in the wat, which is certainly picture-worthy. The grounds of the wat also have an Angkorian-era temple which is in relatively good shape and with some interesting carvings.   
 Wat Samraong Knong. Roughly translates as "wat in the forest". An extremely old pagoda on the east side of the Sangker River. The eerie old wat was used as a Khmer Rouge prison, and there were many executions on the premises. A new pagoda is now being built, and there is a memorial to the victims of the Khmer Rouge regime, with graphic illustrations, just to the north.

Established in 1963, the Battambang Provincial Museum houses a small but impressive collection of Khmer artifacts. The core of the collection is statutes and temple pieces dating from the advent of Hindu and Buddhist religion in Cambodia all the way through the Angkor period. There is also a notable collection of neolithic artifacts from the Laang Spean site. The museum has been renovated, and all artifacts have English-Khmer signage. US$1. (updated Feb 2020)

The bamboo train near Battambang
Head to The Real Place Hostel for competitive priced tours. They have full and half day tours of sights and activities in the region and their price depends on the number of people, but since everyone is heading here, it often ends up in the cheapest deal — still compare though!

13.068996103.2171731 Bamboo Train. The term "train" is here used loosely: a large bamboo platform mounted on train axles powered by a small go-kart engine.

It is regulated by Battambang's Tourist Police, with a standard rate of US$5 per person, minimum 2 people or US$10 for one person, with discounts for larger groups. Ask the driver to pause at scenic places. The old Bamboo Train service was terminated as the tracks were rehabilitated for the reopening of the line to Poipet and Phnom Penh. The current Bamboo Train runs on a new purpose-built track: it takes about 10 minutes to get to a stop where you can buy drinks and t-shirts; it then returns along the same route.

Battambang's central market

Eat[edit]
Battambang's culinary traditions and reputation for producing high quality fruit, vegetables and rice led to it being designated in October 2023 as a UNESCO Creative City in the gastronomy category.
There are plenty of places to eat, but after 19:00 some places close and lots of streets become dark, so eating early (around 18:00) is recommended.
You can get some great French-style bread (by French standards) for 1,000 riel a medium-size baguette up north, between the French cultural centre and the giant statue marking the entry in Battambang from the main inter-provincial road. The bread that street sellers have elsewhere in town is of a much lower standard for the same price, similar to that found in Phnom Penh, baguette-shapes, but sprinkled with sugar. Some people do not notice any difference between the bread sold in the north and elsewhere in Battambang. It is generally of decent quality all across the city.

 Pomme Hostel, Bar & Restaurant, St 2.5, #63, ☏ +855 96 212 6544. 07:00-22:00. Khmer cuisine with a French twist, sophisticated and creative with pleasant staff. Wine list.

13.09352103.191222 Por Chey (southwest of the train station). Spacious place and decent dorms, but the high walls in the rooms and washroom invite for a lot of mosquitos.

Stay safe[edit]
Battambang is very hot during Feb–May, when air conditioning (which adds perhaps US$5 to room cost) is hard to do without. For those with vulnerable stomachs, the hot season is also the least safe, food-wise. Like all Cambodian cities, Battambang is dusty, and eye problems can result. Wear your largest sunglasses when moving around on foot or by tuk tuk.
Street dogs (including those fed by stallholders in the main market, Psar Nath) occasionally attack non-locals, so carrying a stick or stones is a good precaution if out walking.
A general rule if you want to help out the kids begging on the streets is to buy them food but don't give them money. Adults with 'charity ID' collecting money 'for the children', generally near the river, are scammers. Sometimes they'll ask you to volunteer to teach local kids English: this generally ends in an attempt to get money from you.
If you are sick or injured, see a Western-trained doctor not one trained in Cambodia; there is often at least one of these at the Handa Medical Centre. (No appointment needed: just show up.)
