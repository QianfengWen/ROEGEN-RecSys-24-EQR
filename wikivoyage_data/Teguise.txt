Teguise is a town in the north of Lanzarote, with a population of 1776 in 2018. It was the island's capital until 1852 and is the seat of a municipality spanning the two coasts. Other villages in the municipality are also described here except for Costa Teguise, which since the 1970s has grown into a much larger resort with its own identity.

The main bus stop in Teguise is by the windmill next to the marketplace, and on Sunday market days there are special bus runs from Arrecife, Costa Teguise and Puerto del Carmen.

Get around[edit]

See[edit]
Windmill by the market square
29.0604-13.5581 Molina de Teguise. The small windmill that acts as the town landmark. Buses stop here and on Sunday disgorge tourists for the market. The market square is quiet and bare at other times. (updated Dec 2023)
Centers of Art, Culture and Tourism (CACT)[edit]
Jardín de Cactus
The Centers of Art, Culture and Tourism (CACT) (Centros de Arte, Cultura y Turismo) has the Jardí de Cactus (Cactus Garden) included in a combi-ticket:

29.0804-13.4762812 Jardín de Cactus, Av Garafía, Guatiza, ☏ +34 901 200300. Daily 10:00-17:00. Extensive collection of cacti, beautifully presented against black volcanic gravel. The garden (designed by César Manrique, who else) is in a former quarry and sometimes feels crowded. Most is wheelchair-accessible. Adult €6.50, child €3.25.   (updated Nov 2023)
Churches and chapels[edit]
 Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe (West side of the market square). The parish church is 15th century and at the heart of Teguise's old town. (updated Dec 2023)
 Ermita del Santísimo Cristo de la Vera Cruz. A simple but striking 17th-century chapel on C Norte, 100 m (330 ft) north of the market square. (updated Dec 2023)
29.0645-13.56713 Ermita de San Rafael. A picturesque little chapel by Av de las Amepolelas. (updated Jan 2024)
Museums[edit]
29.0449-13.55524 Lagomar (House of Omar Sharif), C los Loros 2, Nazaret, ☏ +34 672 461555. Daily 10:00-18:00. Modern art museum, dramatically set in a quarry and designed (inevitably) by César Manrique. The legend goes that it was owned for one day by the actor Omar Sharif (1932-2015), who immediately lost it at cards to the developer who'd just sold it to him. Sharif was here in the 1970s for a role in The Mysterious Isle, a film adaptation of Jules Verne's sequel to 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea which drew rotten tomatoes from all the film critics. Sharif denied the legend, but he was a renowned bridge player with a serious gambling habit so the story is plausible. Adult €10. (updated Nov 2023)
29.0019-13.54715 Fundación César Manrique. See Costa Teguise for this art studio and wacky residence carved out of a lava tube at Tahiche. Another nearby tube is trash-strewn and not worth seeking out. (updated Jan 2024)
Other attractions[edit]
 Casa del Timple, C Plaza de la Constitución 1, Teguise (200 m southwest of market square). Closed. This museum of island music and culture is temporarily closed. (updated Nov 2023)
29.0579-13.55026 Santa Bárbara Castle (Museum of Piracy), C Herrera y Rojas, Teguise. Closed. A 14th-century fortified lookout perched on the rim of the crater of Montaña Guanapay. Since 2011 it's contained a tacky, puerile exhibition on pirates in these islands, but this has been closed since 2020. You can drive up for the crater view, but some visitors have then found the access barrier locked against their exit. (updated Nov 2023)
29.0681-13.56727 Caleras de Teguise are old lime kilns. Limestone was roasted to make quicklime, for whitewash and cement.
29.0571-13.50438 Stratified City (Ciudad Estratificada) are rock formations eroded and hollowed to look like weird houses. Free parking by the roadside.
29.0556-13.48619 Inverse Pyramids (Canteras de Tinamala) are abandoned quarries that hewed red sandstone for masonry, some in a stepped or ziggurat pattern. A dirt track leads off LZ-1 at Guatiza filling station. You may encounter signs saying it's closed, but no barriers to access.
29.119-13.56610 Famara is a small beach resort with good waves for beginner and intermediate surfers. The main village Caleta de Famara has the harbour, accommodation and bus turnaround. The road continues west to a dead-end at Playa de San Juan, which is breezy but quiet. The main beach Playa de Famara stretches east of Caleta to Urb. Famara (short for urbanización, just housing). A dirt track suitable for 2WD continues northeast along the coast for another 2 km then the cliffs close in.
Risco de Famara are the gaunt black slopes louring over the coast: a hiking trail course midway up. However, the viewpoints from the top are better reached by driving north from Teguise on LZ-10 towards Haría.
29.1402-13.525511 Casa del Agua is reached by hiking another 1.5 km beyond the end of the drivable beach track from Famara. It's a derelict house with water bubbling out of it, and a splash of vegetation all the brighter for its arid backdrop. There's a similar house another 500 m further on, and caves and tunnels in the cliffs. You may encounter squatters in the houses or caves.
Do[edit]
