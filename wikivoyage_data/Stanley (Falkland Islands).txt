Stanley, formerly known as Port Stanley, is the capital of the Falkland Islands.  This city was founded in 1843, and as of 2016 the town had about 2,500 inhabitants, about three-quarters of the archipelago's inhabitants.


Understand[edit]
Prior to the construction of the Panama Canal, Stanley was a major repair stop for boats travelling through the Straits of Magellan.  The rough waters and intense storms found at the tip of the continent forced many ships to Stanley Harbour, and the ship repair industry helped to drive the island economy.  Later, support for the Antarctic sealing and whaling boats became a major industry.  Today, the vast majority of the town's residents are employed by the government, with tourism also being a major source of employment; on days when two or more large cruise ships discharge their passengers by tender, the tourists may outnumber the local residents.
In 2022 Stanley received official city status, as part of the celebration of the Platinum Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth.

Climate[edit]
It's rainy and cool around the year with strong westerlies, so pack warm and weatherproof clothes. Located in the Southern Hemisphere, seasons are inverted from Europe or North America, however hot summer days or double-digit negative temperatures during the winter are practically unheard of. Also, monthly amounts of precipitation are pretty much the same with 11 to 17 rainy days each month.

Respect[edit]
Due to lingering tensions from the 1982 war with Argentina, Spanish-speakers should avoid using Spanish names for places (for example "Puerto Argentino" or "Islas Malvinas"), as doing so will undoubtedly be offensive to the locals.
