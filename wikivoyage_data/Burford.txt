Burford is a picturesque town known as the "gateway to the Cotswolds", a predominantly rural landscape with stone-built villages, historical towns and stately homes and gardens.


Understand[edit]
St John the Baptist Church
Being 18 miles west of Oxford, 2 miles from the Oxfordshire border, and on the southern bank of the River Windrush. the town dates back to the middle Saxon period and is recorded in the Doomsday Book as being an "agricultural village". However, around 1100 the town was granted its charter meaning that today, despite having a population of only 1,400 people (2012), it is classified as a "town".
The decision that the railway be routed through Charlbury undoubtedly affected the town's prosperity but also allowed it to maintain its character.
The town church was instrumental in the formation of Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. In 1874, designer William Morris visited Burford Church and was appalled by the "restoration" works being carried out. Much "restoration"  then seemed to involve destroying (or significantly altering) the genuine old features to replace them with "sham" modern imitations. On his visit to Burford Church, he witnessed the ongoing destruction of the medieval wall paintings and was prompted to start the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. Not all of the wall paintings were destroyed, and many can still be seen today.
