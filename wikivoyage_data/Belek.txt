Belek is a beach resort in Pamphylia on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey, about 40 km east of Antalya. Its big selling point is golf - some dozen courses line the coast, and Turkey's principal tournament is held here as part of the European Tour. 
The nearby ruined cities of Aspendos and Perge indicate the ancient civilisations of this area, but Belek lacks a harbour or defensible redoubt, so it was unimportant until modern times. It's governed as part of Serik town within Antalya Province, and in 2022 had a population of 9102. It includes the neighbourhoods of Kadriye and Boğazkent. 


Get in[edit]
36°51′18″N 31°3′0″EMap of Belek
See Antalya for long-distance travel routes. International visitors mostly arrive at the airport (AYT IATA) and are bussed the 40 km direct to their hotels. Independent travellers might hire a car there or take a taxi, since the airport is east of the city and you can avoid backtracking via downtown. 
Bus BA22 runs from Antalya Meydan to Belek and Boğazkent every 20 min from 06:20 to 21:30. You need the Antalyakart public transport card to use this or any other city bus, see Antalya#Get around for details. Or look for a dolmuş.
Buses between Antalya, Manavgat (for Side) and Alanya scoot past on D400 inland and don't come in to Belek. You could get off at Serik and find a taxi or dolmuş.

Get around[edit]
Belek is designed to deter any thought of stepping beyond your package resort. And it's not the sort of place where you stroll along the prom enjoying the sunset and the aroma of oxidised fish from the harbour cafes. Hotels run shuttles to their golf courses and other amusements such as the theme park. Bus BA22 connects Belek town and Boğazkent but runs along Turizm Cd 1 km inland from the beach hotels.

See[edit]
36.863231.05771 Town centre is all modern, an extended retail plaza selling overpriced tat. The clocktower would be the focus if it had one, with fake archways alongside. The mosque adjacent is also modern but built and decorated in traditional style.
Boğazkent 10 km east at the end of the resort strip is a dull modern grid.
36.938931.17222 Aspendos is a must-see, a well-preserved Graeco-Roman city with a large amphitheatre. See Antalya for details, but it's closer to Belek, about 15 km north. You pass the historic and decidedly wonky Aspendos bridge on the way.
Perge ancient city is likewise described under Antalya.
Do[edit]
Fake arches welcome you to town
Beaches are sandy, but some patches have shingle intermixed.
Boat trips and activities such as sea-fishing are based in the creek east end of the strip towards Boğazkent. They may pick up from jetties along the strip.
Golf courses and clubs west to east are Cullinan Links, National[dead link], Antalya, Carya[dead link], Sueno Pines and Dunes, Cornelia Prince and Queen, Montgomerie Maxx Royal, Gloria and Robinson Nobilis.
Turkish Airlines Open is the country's professional golf tournament, part of the European Tour. It's usually played in November on one of the Belek courses.

Football: there isn't a town team, but there's a football academy for youngsters to try out. Once they're done losing 3-1 to a line of traffic cones, you can watch Süper Lig top-tier games at Antalya or Alanya.
Buy[edit]
Belek town centre is wall-to-wall retail.
Eat[edit]
Golf course at Robinson Nobilis
Those staying on the beach strip eat at their hotels, probably with full board included in their package, so there are no free-standing restaurants there.
Belek town has a dozen budget places within shouting distance of the clocktower. No stand-out, and you wouldn't venture into town just to sample them, but they're open into the small hours for late travellers.

Drink[edit]
Same story as restaurants: the beach strip hotels have bars but there are no free-standing pubs. Belek town has a dozen or so cafes selling alcohol.
Look out for local wines: you'll see vineyards on the hills as your plane comes into land, and Doluca is next to the airport.
