Pitlochry is a town in Perth and Kinross with a population in 2021 of 2950. It's 27 miles north of Perth in the valley of the River Tummel, long a major route between the Lowlands and the central Highlands. It grew up as a tourist resort in the Victorian era, especially after the coming of the railway in 1863. Later developments largely passed it by, so it retains its Victorian centre, which is all the more pleasant since the main road A9 was diverted onto a bypass in 1981.

Sunnybrae Cottage on the main road through town was built in the 1700s, a traditional Highland "black house" with its folk living in its west side and their cattle in its east. It used to have turf walls, and no proper windows or chimney; it nowadays has a corrugated metal roof. You can only view the exterior.

56.6886-3.7222 Dunfallandy Stone is a carved Pictish cross-slab from the 8th century. It's been put in a glass box for protection, which makes the inscriptions harder to see. It's a mile south of town up the lane across the Tummel Bridge - there's no access from A9 rushing overhead. Several Victorian graves are nearby, the most imposing being that of Lieutenant-General Archibald Fergusson (1755-1834), who distinguished himself in Bengal.
56.7099-3.72153 Black Castle is just a few crumbling walls along A924 towards Edradour Distillery. It was built in 1326 on an islet in a loch which has since been drained. The design was enceinte — a rectangular curtain wall and four corner towers but no central keep. It was abandoned in the 16th century and torched, as it was feared it harboured plague or Black Death, hence the castle name.

Edradour, founded in 1825, produces a range of single malt Scotch whiskies: expert tasters use descriptions like rum, caramel, fruity, sweet. It's said to be the smallest legal whisky distillery in Scotland. The minimum used to be 1800 litres still capacity — anything smaller was likely to be producing moonshine — but a 2009 legal case threw out the minimum and opened the way to micro-, craft, or boutique distilleries. The distillery is closed for tours in 2024. (updated Mar 2024)
