See[edit]
53.7975-6.2221 Port Oriel is the harbour, with the shrine "Queen of the Sea" by its entrance. It's a working fishing port so it's authentic rather than picturesque. Use the big free car park and don't clutter up the quays.
53.796-6.2192 Clogherhead Cliff is the rocky headland that gave its name to the entire village.
53.788-6.2353 Clogherhead Beach is sandy. Thatched cottages stand by the shore. Free parking, dogs welcome. The sands stretch all the way south to the Boyne estuary below Drogheda.
53.801-6.2664 Old Mayne Church is the scenic ruin of a late medieval church. It's along R166, 500 m northeast of St Michael's which was built in 1856.
53.81-6.265 Port Beach is the long sandy beach stretching north of the village. It's flanked by a road so access is simple.
53.765-6.276 Termonfeckin is the village 4 km south of Clochermore along R166 to Drogheda. There's a beach, the ruin of a 15th- or 16th-century tower house, and St Fechin's church with a decorated 16th-century High Cross. The village has a few B&Bs.
Do[edit]
You can shore-dive from the harbour slipway. Turn right (east) and remain within the harbour walls, maybe 6-7 m at high tide. Try not to stir up the silty bottom, and beware boats overhead.

The Civility of Albert Cashier
That was the title of the 2017 musical about Clogherhead's most remarkable son. Cashier (1843-1915) stowed away on a boat to America, worked as a farmhand then joined the Union army. He saw many battles and was captured at Vicksburg but escaped; he survived to go back to farm work. It was only when he became mentally frail in his last year that Cashier was outed: she was Jennie Irene Hodges but had always adopted a male identity. He / she was buried with military honours in Saunemin, Illinois.


Mace is the convenience store south end of the village, open M-Sa 7AM-10PM, Su 8:30AM-8PM.
Fisherman's Catch on the harbour is as fresh as fish can be. It's open daily 9AM-6PM.
Ireland's Only Potato-Vending Machine was set up in 2018 along a lane off R166: go past Old Mayne Church then next right marked "Coast Road". Farmer Finnegan set it up as a protest at the pittance the supermarkets were paying for his produce. It's open 24 hours, put €5 in the big blue machine and out comes a 10-kilo bag of spuds, varieties are seasonal.
