Pasir Gudang is a city in Johor, Malaysia. Generally industrial in nature, Pasir Gudang holds a colourful kite festival in February, and the local track circuit is a favourite spot for gearheads in Johor. The Tanjung Puteri golf course is also one of the largest courses in the state.


Understand[edit]
Aqabah Tower
The name Pasir Gudang originated from the existence of a sand mine at Kampung Ulu. Sand or 'pasir' in Malay was stocked in sand pits or 'gudang', to be exported to Singapore, hence the name 'Pasir Gudang'.
Other than sand, the areas surrounding Pasir Gudang were mainly used by plantation owners to grow catechu and black pepper, along with pineapples. Upon the introduction of rubber to Malaysia, large estates around Plentong were opened by British and Singaporean cultivators. During the 1970s, the state government took over former plantation estates, converting them into industrial and housing areas and cementing Pasir Gudang as a hub for heavy industry. The mass of chemical factories means that the air quality sometimes worsens noticeably, taking on a hint of burning plastic. It is also an important port city serving Johor Bahru, together with Tanjung Pelepas to the west.
It was home to 47,000 people in 2010.

Get in[edit]
Pasir Gudang Bus and Taxi Terminal
By plane[edit]
The city does not have its own airport. The nearest airport is the Senai International Airport (JHB IATA) in Senai.

By car[edit]
From JB, follow the signs north towards Kota Tinggi and make a right turn off to Pasir Gudang where signposted, then you can't go much wrong following the major Lebuhraya Pasir Gudang (Federal Route 17). Alternatively, take the JB East Coast Highway, which will pass by Permas Jaya.

By bus[edit]
Bus fees should cost about RM3-5 from Johor Bahru city centre. Ask for 'Bandaraya Johor Bahru' should there be any difficulty in getting back to the main city.

Pasir Gudang: Maju bus 224 travels between Larkin Bus Terminal and Pasir Gudang, passing by Plaza Pelangi, Tebrau City and Johor Jaya.
Masai: Maju buses 39, 200 and 208 run from Larkin to JB city centre to Masai. Transit Link 133 and 133A start from Masai, making a loop to JB then returning to Masai. Causeway Link 9B from JB also stops at Masai Bus Terminal.
