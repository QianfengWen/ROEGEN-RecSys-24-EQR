Mountrath is a town in County Laois, with a population in 2022 of about 2100. In the 18th and 19th century it was industrial, with weaving and metal-working from local iron ores. It was also on the main Dublin to Limerick road, a traffic bottleneck until bypassed by M7 in 2010. Its name derives from Maighean Rátha, "the homestead of the ringfort", of which no trace remains.


Get in[edit]
Slieve Bloom Mountains
Local Link Bus 834 runs 3 or 4 times a day from Portlaoise to 53.004-7.4751 Mountrath (30 min) and continues to Castletown, Borris-in-Ossory and Roscrea. 
Local Link Bus 839 runs once M-F in the morning from Borris to Castletown, Mountrath, Portlaoise and Mountmellick, returning late afternoon. 
Slieve Bloom Bus 831 runs once M-F early morning from Portlaoise to Mountrath then orbits through Castletown, Borris, Rathdowney, Ballycolla, Durrow, Balnakill, Abbeyleix and back to Portlaoise. The complete return run is late afternoon; two other runs terminate at Borris and don't reach Castletown or Mountrath.
Portlaoise is the nearest transport hub, with trains from Dublin Heuston to Cork, Athlone and Galway, and direct buses from Dublin Airport and city centre.  
By road from Dublin follow N7 / M7 to Portlaoise, where you need to take Exit 16 onto R445, otherwise you'll discover why folk say it's a long way to Tipperary. Until 2010 the main Dublin to Limerick road N7 was via Portlaoise, Mountrath and Borris, and horribly congested. Once M7 was extended this was down-classed to R445, becoming the longest regional road in Ireland, almost coast-to-coast. Odd that it hasn't been touted as a "heritage highway", an Irish Route 66 of Harley-Davidsons and TV travelogues.

You need wheels to reach the mountain trailheads, which are the main reason to be here.

The tree regrew, but don't hammer in coins
53.009-7.4261 Clonenagh along R445 was once an important abbey founded by St Fintan (526-603). It may have hosted the Synod of Ráth Breasail of  1111 AD, which aligned the early Irish church more closely with Rome, and organised it by parishes instead of monasteries. The main remnant is the series of cross slabs in the old graveyard. There was a holy well, but when it was filled in and closed to curb superstition, folk marvelled that the copious rainfall still collected in the fork of a nearby sycamore, and transferred their venerations and imprecations to that. For the next 200 years pilgrims hammered coins into the "money-tree", to show how wonderfully resistant it was, but it wasn't. However the age of miracles is not gone: in the 21st century the tree re-grew. And much of west Europe adopted the same money as Ireland, calling it the "Eire-oh".

53.005-7.5923 Poet's Cottage in Camross is named for Patrick Ryan, an 18th / 19th century poet, but it's a modern replica.
53.068-7.6654 Carroll's Hill at 482 m / 1581 ft and 53.077-7.6115 Stillbrook Hill at 514 m / 1686 ft are nearby peaks of the Slieve Bloom Mountains on R440 towards Kinnitty.
52.94-7.6316 Borris-in-Ossory recalls in its name the ancient kingdom of Osraighe. This formed a narrow strip between Leinster and Munster, with its heyday as a Viking domain in the 9th century. Not much has happened since: St Mark's church with its stubby "Round Tower" is a piece of Victorian whimsy. Don't confuse this place with Borris in County Carlow.
52.958-7.70717 Ballaghmore Castle: see Roscrea for this medieval turret.
