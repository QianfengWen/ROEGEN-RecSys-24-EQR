By plane[edit]
In practice, arriving in Franklinville by plane usually means flying into Buffalo Niagara International Airport. However, a closer alternative is Bradford Regional Airport (BFD IATA) in Bradford, Pennsylvania, which is served with daily commuter flights from Pittsburgh via Southern Airways Express: four on weekdays, two on Saturdays, and three on Sundays.

42.42584-78.48731 Cattaraugus County Historical Museum, 9824 Route 16, Machias (about 7.5 miles north of downtown Franklinville), ☏ +1 716 353-8200. M-Th 9AM-4PM, also third Sa of each month May-Oct and first Sa of Jul & Aug, 10AM-2PM. Located on the first floor of the Old Stone House in Machias, this museum contains a wealth of historic photographs and artifacts covering daily life in pioneer days, the contributions of local residents to the Civil War and the two World Wars, and the history of the Cattaraugus County Fair. A range of special events and temporary exhibits appear frequently on the programming schedule, and there's an onsite research library for those who want to dig a bit deeper. Free. (updated Dec 2017)
42.320278-78.4659182 [formerly dead link] Howe-Prescott Pioneer House, 3031 Route 98 South, ☏ +1 716 676-2590. Su Jun-Aug by appointment. The Howe-Prescott House is one of the oldest extant buildings in the area: it was erected circa 1814 by a family of prominent abolitionists (a movement that was extraordinarily strong in the hamlet of Cadiz, just a short distance south of Franklinville village center) and served as a station on the Underground Railroad in the years before the Civil War. Under the ownership of the Ischua Valley Historical Society, nowadays it's done up as a pioneer homestead, with exhibits and demonstrations illustrating life in the very earliest days of white settlement in Western New York.

Romanesque Revival architecture in the Park Square Historic District
42.337982-78.4561663 [formerly dead link] Miner's Cabin, 9 Pine St., ☏ +1 716 676-2590. Open during Maple Festival and special Open House events, as well as Sundays Jun-Aug by appointment. Quite the misnomer: no hardscrabble log dwelling, this turreted, three-story Queen Anne beauty was built in 1895 for Simeon Robbins, a local resident who struck it rich during the Klondike Gold Rush in the Yukon, hence its name. It's been restored by the Ischua Valley Historical Society to its original appearance — the first floor is fully furnished with antique furniture, while the upper floors are given over to historical exhibits concerning the history of the local high school, Ten Broeck Academy; the Ontario Knife Company (the oldest extant one in the country, headquartered in Franklinville since 1889), and archived newspaper articles and other historic documents.   (updated Dec 2017)
42.337381-78.4575434 Park Square Historic District. This beautifully-preserved nucleus of downtown Franklinville was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Around a quaint, brick-paved central square, where Main, Chestnut, Pine, and Elm Streets meet, you'll see an arrangement of historic commercial and municipal buildings in a variety of 19th- and early 20th-century architectural styles such as Queen Anne, Italianate, and Neoclassical. In the middle of it all is the verdant village green, where events are frequently held.   (updated Dec 2017)

42.358323-78.4544251 Ischua Valley Country Club, 8093 Route 16, Farmersville (about 1½ miles north of downtown Franklinville), ☏ +1 716 676-3630. Golf course daily 7AM-sunset, everything else M-Th 11AM-9PM, F-Sa 11AM-10PM, Su 11AM-8PM. Far from the hoity-toity, members-only affair you usually think of when you hear "country club", at Ischua Valley everything's friendly, down-to-earth, and open to the public. Bisected by the lovely Ischua Creek, the club's 9-hole, par-36 golf course becomes 18 holes and par 72 when you realize that each hole has two different sets of tees — play through twice for a different scenario each time! If golf isn't your game, Ischua Valley has also got a bowling alley, and if you're hungry, the fish fry at the onsite restaurant is renowned. (updated Jan 2018)
42.330227-78.4596152 Skateland of Franklinville, 70 S. Main St., ☏ +1 716 676-2655. Skating F-Sa 7PM-10:30PM, Su 2PM-4:30PM, also Sa 2PM-4:30PM Oct-May only; Passions Dance Club F 8PM-10PM & Sa 10PM-midnight. To call Skateland an old-fashioned roller rink would be to sell it short: this Franklinville perennial on the cusp of its fourth decade of existence is a youth hangout of a multifaceted bent. Not only roller skating but also laser tag, a video arcade, inline hockey, and (in the summer) outdoor batting cages and a go-kart track are on offer. And on Friday and Saturday nights, the skating hall becomes Passions, Cattaraugus County's only teen dance club. (updated Dec 2017)
 Western New York Maple Festival, ☏ +1 716 557-2498. Held annually during the last weekend of April each year since 1962, the festival attracts tens of thousands of visitors to the village each year. It showcases local area maple producers and their maple syrup and maple products. The event is highlighted by a pageant, a parade, pancake breakfast, ham and leek dinner, trade show, craft fair and dozens of vendors. (updated Dec 2017)

42.328125-78.4606521 Frankeez, 100 S. Main St., ☏ +1 716 676-2333. Daily 11AM-9PM. Frankeez is open all year round, but the menu says "SUMMER" in big bold capital letters: served at this casual walk-up snack bar (with limited indoor seating) is a modest but delicious range of simple fare from off the grill and out of the deep fryer. The order of the day is burgers, hot dogs, chicken wings and fingers, fries and onion rings, and — above all — delicious hard and soft-serve ice cream that's the perfect way to cool down on a hot day. The loaded chili cheese fries are a must. $5-15. (updated Jan 2018)
42.337289-78.4587962 Jackie's Village Restaurant, 9 Elm St., ☏ +1 716 676-9973. Just a stone's throw from Park Square is where you'll find this "where everybody knows your name" type of place, where good old-fashioned homestyle American comfort food (think meatloaf, mac & cheese, and scratch-made soup of the day) is served by "the kind [of people] that know everybody's normal order". Don't worry, though: even if you're not from around these parts, the service is friendly, the prices are reasonable, and the food is tasty — especially the home fries served at breakfast! Cash only. $15-30. (updated Jan 2018)
Groceries[edit]
42.345007-78.4548183 Family Dollar, 99 N. Main St., ☏ +1 716 676-5951. Daily 9AM-8PM. You know the drill. A limited range of groceries and miscellaneous other stuff sold cheap. (updated Jan 2018)
42.336031-78.459164 Franklinville Fresh Market (Shur-Fine), 17 S. Main St., ☏ +1 716 676-3697. M-Sa 7AM-9PM, Su 8AM-9PM. That's no mere convenience store tucked behind the Sunoco gas station in the middle of downtown Franklinville: it's a full-service grocery store, with fresh produce, meats, dairy — the whole nine yards. (updated Jan 2018)
Farmers markets[edit]
 Franklinville Farmers Market, Main St. at Pine St., ☏ +1 716 676-9181. W 3PM-6PM, Jun-Oct. Locavores take note: Park Square is the venue for this weekly event where folks can buy fresh, seasonal, New York State-sourced goodies — fruits and vegetables, eggs, maple syrup, honey, prepared foods, and the like — direct from the grower. The folks who sell here know their product and know their customer, so if you're a foodie with a burning question about a particular product or you're keeping your ears to the ground for any cooking tips — either for this week's Recipe of the Week or in general — the Franklinville Farmers Market is the place to inquire. (updated Jan 2018)
Drink[edit]
42.337068-78.4576331 Legends Bar & Grill, 5 Park Square, ☏ +1 716 676-7013. Tu-Th 3PM-midnight, F-Sa noon-2AM, Su noon-10PM. Nestled snugly into one of the historic brick Italianates on Park Square, Legends is a place that walks a fine line: it manages a rollicking good-time atmosphere (with a pair of pool tables, frequent live rock and country concerts featuring local talent, and a lively bar well stocked with whiskey and bourbon) without being off-putting for young families with kids or other more mild-mannered travellers. There's also a limited food menu of pub grub, pizza and wings. (updated Jan 2018)
Sleep[edit]
Campgrounds[edit]
42.287064-78.3871631 Camp Emerald Acres, 6629 Abbotts Rd., Lyndon (about 6 miles southeast of downtown Franklinville via County Route 24), ☏ +1 716 676-3225. Check-in: noon, check-out: 11AM. "Our goal is to promote camping as [not only] affordable lodging but a recreational adventure", proclaims Camp Emerald Acres' website — and true to the spirit of that statement, there's quite a bit more to this expansive campground than just several hundred serviced and unserviced campsites, RV sites, and cabins. In fact, with amenities like a horseshoe pit, volleyball court, 30-foot (9m) above-ground pool, fishing pond, extensive hiking trails, kids' playground, and frequent theme nights and special events — not to mention a camp store with all the snacks and supplies you might need during your stay — you might call Emerald Acres a destination unto itself. Open May 1-Oct 10. Primitive sites $22/night or $132/week, serviced sites (with water and electricity) $34/night or $204/week or $510/month; cabins and RVs $75/night.. (updated Jan 2018)
42.298384-78.5230342 Shamrock Pines Campground, 3900 Jarecki Rd., ☏ +1 716 676-2776. Check-in: between 2PM and 8PM, check-out: noon. 380 acres (155 ha) of summer fun in the shade of a statuesque pine forest (hence the name) in the foothills of the picturesque Allegheny Mountains. Shamrock Pines counts 110 tent campsites, of which 89 include electrical hookups, as well as a number of RV sites — not to mention a pool, a network of trails open to hikers, bikers, and horseback riders, and a large lake in the center of it all with a boat launch, fishing, and a rustic cabin on the shore that sleeps four (available for weekend or weekly rentals only). Downsides: customer service is a weak link, and woe be to those who contravene camp rules. Open Apr 15-Oct 15. Contact campground for rates. (updated Jan 2018)
42.361125-78.503733 The Woods at Bear Creek, 3510 Bear Creek Rd., Machias (about 4 miles northwest of downtown Franklinville via County Route 17 and Bakerstand Rd.), ☏ +1 716 676-2327. Check-in: 3PM, check-out: 11AM. The Woods at Bear Creek is for those who want an experience that approximates camping but can't bear to part with their creature comforts: located on 750 acres (300ha) of forested hills and meadows, this upscale "glamping" resort features 16 two-bedroom, climate-controlled guest cabins with either two queen beds or one queen and two sets of bunk beds, each with a flat-screen satellite TV with Internet access, swanky leather furniture, an outdoor campfire area, and a private golf cart for guest use. As well, the property is brimming with things to do: hiking trails, kayaks, canoes and paddleboats beckon the active outdoorsy folks, there are tennis and basketball courts for sports fans, a 1,400-foot (425m) zipline for adventurers — or just chill out poolside or while casting your line into the 20-acre (8ha) fishing pond. $235/nt in high season for double occupancy, plus $50 for each additional person; $185/nt in high season for "non-inclusive" double-occupancy accommodation (i.e. cabin only, no breakfast and no access to onsite amenities), plus $30 for each additional person. Rates are lower offseason, see website for details. (updated Jan 2018)
Bed and breakfasts[edit]
42.337323-78.4656874 Daily Bread Bed & Breakfast, 3024 Bakerstand Rd., ☏ +1 716 449-2814. If you're big on privacy, Daily Bread may be the bed-and-breakfast experience for you: rather than being divvied up into multiple units, the entire downstairs apartment of this picture-perfect brick Victorian Gothic cottage just outside the center of Franklinville is, in the words of its Facebook page, "exclusively yours during your stay... your home away from home". Your air-conditioned bedroom contains a private ensuite bath, mini-fridge and microwave, and there's also a living room with a TV and Internet access, and even a game room with a dartboard and a pool table. Plus the owner is a retired chef, so naturally breakfast is a real crowd-pleaser. First-time guests require a $50 advance deposit on the room rate, but it's money well spent. With full breakfast: $85/nt for up to two people, $20 per additional guest; no breakfast: $65/nt for up to two people, $10 per additional guest. (updated Jan 2018)
