Seminyak is a beach town in South Bali north of Legian and Kuta. The next town north of Legian, Seminyak is more upmarket with mostly luxury accommodation and  fashionable high-end restaurants and bars. The atmosphere is much more sophisticated and laid-back than Kuta, and the beach in particular is quieter during the day. Seminyak is also the high end spa and boutique shopping capital of Bali. Nowhere is the upscaling of Bali more obvious than here.

Seminyak Beach

Understand[edit]
Seminyak was once a distinctly separate village, and something of a backwater. Development occurred at an astonishing pace, and has absorbed all green space that separated Seminyak from Legian, it is now almost impossible to determine where Seminyak ends and the nearby villages of Petitenget, Umalas and Kerobokan begin. The district has become very congested.

 Tourist Information Office, Jalan Raya Seminyak Gang Baik-Baik, ☏ +62 85253 000066, baliagustour@gmail.com. 08:00-18:00. A source of information for current events in the city and for picking up a free map. 
Get in[edit]

By car[edit]
Seminyak is part of the main west coast conurbation in South Bali and it can get very congested with traffic. There are two main routes in. From Kuta and Legian, Jalan Legian runs parallel with the beach and at its western limit, becomes Jalan Seminyak. If at all possible try to avoid this road though, and take instead the eastern bypass called Jalan Sunset. This is almost invariably the quicker route from Kuta and Legian into Seminyak, although it is actually further in distance.
A prepaid taxi from the airport to Seminyak costs a fixed Rp 60,000. Trips to or from Kuta cost around Rp 30,000 and from Legian about Rp 15,000.

Get around[edit]
The streets of Seminyak are increasingly jammed, with Jalan Laksmana being a particular black-spot.  Your best options here are to walk or rent a motorcycle/bicycle.
A number of roads in Seminyak have alternative names. Whilst this issue is not exclusive to Seminyak, it does seem to happen here more than anywhere else in Bali. There follows a list of road names with the most popular given first and the alternatives afterwards in brackets.

Jalan Arjuna (Jalan Double Six, Jalan 66)
Jalan Raya Seminyak (Jalan Raya Basangkasa)
Jalan Dhyana Pura (Jalan Caplak Tanduk)
Jalan Laksmana (Jalan Oberoi, Jalan Kayu Aya)
Jalan Pantai Legian (Jalan Blue Ocean)
Jalan Mertanadi (Jalan Penjara)
See[edit]
Pura Petitenget
Seminyak Beach and Petitenget Beach is a continuous expanse of grey sand stretching in both directions as far as the eye can see. To the south it becomes Legian Beach and then Kuta Beach, but is noticeably quieter than both. The sunsets here are famous, and opportunites abound to mix with the glitterati who frequent the high end beach front establishments such as Ku De Ta. Easy access points to the beach are at the end of Jalan Dhyana Pura, and from the large public car park (Rp 2,000) between Petitenget Temple and La Luciola restaurant.

-8.68184115.152431 Pura Petitenget (at the beachside off Jl Petitenget). This is a compact, pretty Balinese temple, which is known for particularly spectacular beach-side ceremonies. There has been a temple here since at least the 16th century, and although this is not one of the key nine directional temples of Bali, it is an important link in the series of west coast temples between Pura Uluwatu and Pura Tanah Lot.

Others[edit]

If you are looking for Indonesian antiques (genuine or reproductions), or just enjoy browsing for eclectic homewares,  try Jalan Kerobokan between the junction with Jalan Seminyak and the next set of traffic lights to the north. This is a very busy road and moving around is not easy, but both sides of the street are lined with numerous furniture, antique and homeware stores. A quieter, but just as rewarding option for similar products, is Jalan Mertanadi which runs parallel to Jalan Kerobokan just to the east.
Two traditional fresh produce markets remain in Seminyak. The most convenient is on the west side of the last bend at the very northern end of Jalan Raya Seminyak, and is widely known as Seminyak Market. A little more out of the way is a similar market in Kerobokan, called Taman Sari. Take Jalan Raya Kerobokan north from Jalan Raya Seminyak until you reach the first set of lights. Turn right and Taman Sari market is almost immediately on your righthand side. Both are best in the mornings from 07:00-11:00, and provide visitors with the opportunity to examine and purchase traditional, fresh local fruit and vegetables.


Eat[edit]
Seminyak has developed a world-class dining scene. If you want to splurge on one very special dinner while you are in Bali, look no further than the higher end options in Seminyak. Prices are high by Bali standards but on an international scale still good value for the highest quality of food and eating environment. The clientele is demanding here and the turnover of restaurants quite high, so those that make it and stick around are invariably very good.

Budget[edit]
Although they have become hard to find, there are still some excellent budget options available in the area.

 Baku Dapa, Jl Dhyana Pura. This great value warung is something of a legend in Seminyak. Stays open very late and is popular with the partying crowd. Serves Manado style Indonesian food at very keen prices. Highly recommended as a real taste of Indonesia. 
 Café Tahu (Tofu Cafe), Jl Petitenget 20. Popular with locals, this restaurant has raised seating around a central courtyard and offers up a menu of tofu, tofu and more tofu, cooked Indonesian style for about Rp 10,000 per dish.

 Kolega, Jl Petitenget, ☏ +62 852 37949778. About 11:00-15:00, sometimes open in the early evening also. This simple, unassuming Javanese warung is an absolute institution amongst locals and expats alike. When it first gained the attention of travel guides there was a collective groan, but it has remained remarkably free from attention of the tourist hoardes. Choose your rice (options of plain, yellow and sometimes red) and the dishes to go with it. The various beef, chicken and fish dishes are fabulous, and the vegetables always fresh and fiery. Go easy on the sambal until you understand your heat tolerance. It is hard to think of a better, more authentic introduction to Indonesian food anywhere in Bali. Packed every day, and especially at lunch time. around Rp 20,000.

True to the name, this is a simple but stylish blue building by the beach, offering all sorts of drinks for around Rp 10,000 as well as sandwiches and pasta for around Rp 30,000 — not to mention cool breezes and great sunsets. 
 Warung Batavia, Jl Kunti Utara (turn north off Jl Sunset at the Jl Kunti lights and it is on the first bend you reach), ☏ +62 361 7316411. 11:00-19:00. After years on Jl Kerobokan this long-established warung which serves excellent Javanese food has opened at a location with better parking. Always busy, but lunchtimes especially.

All day long, this very busy cafe serves breakfasts with French croissants, baguettes and a big English breakfast with beans and sausage. The only downside here is that it is an outdoor cafe right beside a very busy and noisy road. 
 Gourmet Cafe (Bali Catering Co Cafe), Jl Petitenget, ☏ +62 361 8475115. 07:00-21:00 daily. This is the cafe outlet of Bali's most gourmet catering company.

Gay bars[edit]
There are numerous gay bars on Jalan Dhyana Pura, the most popular of which is Mixwell.

Sleep[edit]
There is virtually no backpacker accommodation in Seminyak. Budget travellers will generally do better to stay in nearby Kuta or Legian. However, there are some (fairly uninspiring) losmen type places in Gang Bima which runs south off the northern end of Jalan Dhyana Pura, right in the heart of Seminyak.
The main choices are villas and higher end hotels. There are some good bargains to be had in the mid-range though in low season, so shop around.
Beware of false advertising. Only the most expensive "villas" are completely private and self-contained, while many share at least some facilities, and the cheaper ones are just clusters of bungalows.
It is difficult to differentiate between budget and mid-range hotels based on stars, so a usual 4- or 3-star mid-range hotel may be a budget hotel.
The prices are stated below are normal, except if stated as discount prices.
