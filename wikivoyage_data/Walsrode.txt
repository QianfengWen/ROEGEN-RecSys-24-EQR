Understand[edit]
The Heath Museum in Walsrode
Walsrode was first mentioned in 986, the same year that Count Walo founded a monastery in the area. By 1383, it had been given city rights by the Dukes of Brunswick and Lüneburg.  The Sculptor Hans Brüggemann, most famous for the cathdral's Bordesholmer altar, was born in Walsrode at the end of the 15th century.
The city was largely destroyed in 1626 by Tilly's troops in the Thirty Year War. The war began because of a religious conflict between Protestants and Catholics. Walsrode was largely a Protestant town and was thus destroyed by Johann t’Serclaes von Tilly. Things did not get any better for Walsrode in 1757, when the majority of houses were destroyed by the "Great Fire".
Walsrode was connected to the railway network in 1890.  It was joined to the railway line that went to Bremervörde, and eventually connected to the line between Hannover and Schwarmstedt.
The local poet Hermann Löns used his beloved heath around Walsrode for his novels and poems celebrating the people and landscape. You can still feel the magic of this vast landscape, with its splashes of colour from purple flowering heather, dark green junipers and bright yellow gorse bushes, surrounded by colourful forests, fertile fields and rolling river valleys.  Hermann Löns was buried in 1935 in Tietlingen grove.
In 1957 Walsrode became the site of the Federal Border Police where they also have a training and education centre.
