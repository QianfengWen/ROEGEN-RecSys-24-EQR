Kap Arkona (Cape Arkona) is the northernmost area of Rügen.


Understand[edit]
The area consists of three main locations, Putgarten, Arkona and Vitt and should be seen more like an open air museum than a couple of villages and coastal views.
Putgarten, is the closest public point to the coast you can drive to and although was at one point a village it is now more of a car park and tourist trap with trinkets shops and a few food establishments.
Arkona, the destination for most tourist, has three lighthouses and the Jaromarsburg Slavic hill fort which is no longer accessible due to the risk of landslides.
Vitt was a small fishing village and consists of a number of attractive small thatched cottages in a narrow valley leading to small beach.
