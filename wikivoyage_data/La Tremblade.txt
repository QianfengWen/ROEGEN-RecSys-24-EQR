La Tremblade is a port town and seaside resort on the Arvert peninsula in Charente-Maritime, southwestern France. This small town with about 4,500 inhabitants (about 10,000 when including the surrounding villages), and famous for its flat oysters just like the surrounding Marennes-Oléron region.


Understand[edit]

La Tremblade is in the southwest of Charente-Maritime, covering the western end of the Arvert Peninsula between the Gironde and Seudre estuaries. It's part of the greater Royan area, itself forming a municipality that also includes the villages of Arvert, Étaules and Chaillevette and the surrounds, and faces the town of Marennes. Two sectors dominate the economy: on one hand fishing and oyster farming, and on the other hand beach and ecotourism (during the summer the population more than doubles). 
Part of the Marennes-Oléron oyster basin (bassin ostréicole de Marennes-Oléron), which is one of the biggest in Europe, the nearby Port of La Grève is France's most important oyster port. It's a 2 km long canal next to the Seudre River with small barges (bâtas and plates), and thousands of hectares of clear ripening basins where oysters get their unique colour and flavour. Indeed, they may have the appearance of rice fields when they're sparkling in the sun.
The western part of the municipality, facing the Atlantic, has a different character. Until the early 19th century it consisted of vast sand dunes. Then thousands and thousands of pines were planted, and now much of it comprises the Coubre state forest, 8000 hectares in size and part of a set of coastal pine forests continuing south across the Gironde and northwest. There's a dense network of paths in the forest for walks in the green, the coastline of 20 km which retains the white sand dunes is great for sunbathing and the waves coming in is great for surfing and to some extent swimming (one has to be careful as the currents can be strong).

History[edit]
The baptismal fonts of the ancien priory Notre-Dame de Buze, now in the church of Les Mathes
Unlike some other parts of Charente-Maritime, the peninsula hasn't been inhabited since prehistory. In the Middle Ages the thick forest and wild coast was administratively lands of different monastic communities by the lords of Mornac - Aléard and Gombeau. 
The Clunian community settled in the southwest of the present municipality near a pond connected to the Atlantic by the Barrachois Canal, founding the Notre-Dame de Buze priory with many buildings. Further north, the monks of the Order of Grandmont founded the priories of Notre-Dame de La Garde and Notre-Dame de La Couronne. The religious communities also started cultivating the land, and eventually a small village named Trembledam emerged around the La Garde priory. Named after the French word for aspen (tremble), a common tree around here, this marked the beginning of La Tremblade. Its port became important for exporting wheat, wine, but especially salt and was frequented by merchants from all over Europe.
With relatively strong connections to Northern Europe through sailors and merchants, the Protestant Reformation gained a foothold here during the 16th century. As such, the French Wars of Religion had a major on the region with the aforementioned priories being sacked, burned and abandoned.
With the end of the wars, La Tremblade became a major port. From here, ships departed to the colonies of New France in North America, as well as to Africa, and shipyards were set up. Moreover, the oyster farming which the region is known for today was started around 1650. The green oysters of Isles d'Arvert were prized by the nobility and the French king alike. Nevertheless the counter-reformation struck hard on the region around the 1680s and many Protestants had to flee to England and the Netherlands.
La Tremblade became a parish in the 18th century, the seigneurial house of the barony of Arvert was moved there in 1758 and the city became the cantonal capital during the French Revolution. Now several new buildings were erected, together with infrastructure modern for its time.
The city became a sea resort during the 1860s – first a sea villa was built by a certain Joseph-Édouard Perraudeau, then many more would follow, making La Tremblade a tourist destination which it still is. During WWII, the town became a German stronghold and was bombed by the Allies multiple times and burned by the Germans when they left. After the war, it was rebuilt and continued functioning as a resort town.

Climate[edit]
Ronce-les-Bains, a beach resort a few kilometers north of La Tremblade town. In the background the Seurne River estuary is visible and the westernmost bridge across it
La Tremblade has an oceanic climate of the Aquitaine type, with a microclimate that's more Mediterranean which means maritime pines, green oaks, olive trees, mimosas, eucalyptus, agaves and the like thrive here. There are 2250 hours of sunshine a year. Yearly rain is generally around 750-800 mm, and droughts aren't unheard of especially during the hotter months.
Winds generally come in from the west (the Atlantic), meaning warm breezes in the summer but much stronger winds in the autumn and winter; a few times every century a big storm hits the region such as in January 1924 and December 1999.

D14 comes in from Arvert and Étaules (connecting to Royan) and Saujon, where it connects to the N150 coming in from Saintes and the A10 autoroute between Paris and Bordeaux. D25 is a bypass on the town's western side, and it comes in from Royan going along the coast to La Palmyre and through the State Forest of Coubre. D728e comes in from Marennes-Hiers-Brouage across the Seudre River, and Marennes has roads in from Saintes (D728), Rochefort (D123 and D733) and Île d'Oléron (D26)

La Tremblade's railway station is just served by the tourist train Le train des mouettes. The closest railway stations with scheduled service are in Saujon and Royan are about 20 km away. They're served by the local TER Poitou-Charentes network.

By plane[edit]
There are general aviation fields in Marennes and Royan. The closest passenger airports are in Bordeaux (115 km south) and La Rochelle (55 km north).

By bus[edit]

Getting in and around the town and municipality by car is usually hassle-free around the year. The exception would be the seaside hamlet of Ronce-les-Bains which gets busy in July and August. Parking is free around town and at the beaches, and again, it can be difficult to find a vacant spot during the busier summer months.

See[edit]
Coubre Lighthouse - with a height of 64 m it's the highest in Charente-Maritime
45.69651-1.233171 Coubre lighthouse (Phare de la Coubre), ☏ +33 5 46 06 26 42, pharedelacoubre@latremblade.fr. The red and white lighthouse near the Pointe de la Coubre sits on moving sandbanks watching over the incoming waves of the ocean. Built in 1904, it's not the first lighthouse here, but earlier construction have fallen victim to erosion. When the lighthouse was finished it was almost 2 km from the coastline, now the it is just 150 m away. You can walk 300 steps up to the viewing platform to views of tens of kilometres including the Coubre Forest, the Gironde estuary, Île d'Oléron and the Côte Sauvage. Next to the lighthouse is a museum about the lighthouses that have functioned here and their equipment (admission is included in the ticket to the lighthouse).   (updated Mar 2018)
45.76864-1.14242 Sacred heart church (Église du Sacré-Cœur). Neo-Gothic church from the 1880s, built as the earlier church became too small for the growing number of worshippers. The bell tower was damaged in a storm in 1999 and partially rebuilt.

The sand banks protect swimmers from currents, and the water tends to somewhat warmer here as it moves around less. Starting from the north, Mus-du-Loup beach is near the Seudre bridge and the mouth of the river. This beach is more for sunbathing than swimming because the water is often muddy. Cèpe beach is just west of Ronce-les-Bains, and is accessed by an avenue. It has a beach club and picnic tables. Further west are the less busier beaches of Galon d'Or and L'Embellie. (updated Feb 2018)

45.743611-1.2422226 Côte sauvage beaches (Plages de la Côte sauvage) (Forêt de la Coubre). Making up the western flank of the municipality, the "wild coast" is a stretch of about 20 km of white sand beaches, facing the ocean directly. Five sections have been developed for swimming, but given the currents and waves, swimmers need to be careful, especially with children. The beaches popular with surfers, though. Plage de la pointe Espagnole is the northernmost, is surveilled by lifeguards during the summer months and has a snack bar and a dedicated parking lot. South of it is the naturist beach with the same name. Then comes Plage de la Bouverie which likewise has lifeguards, a snack bar and a parking lot and Plage du Vieux-Phare which has no services. The southernmost, partially in the municipality of Mathes, is Plage du phare de la Coubre near the lighthouse with parking and lifeguards - this is the beach with the strongest currents.

Eat[edit]
Local specialities[edit]
The local, Saintongenaise, cuisine is based on land products, seafood and wine.
The Marennes-Oléron oysters are famous far beyond the region. Oysters are refined or "clarified" in the old salt marshes where they mature to different taste levels; fine de claire with an iodized taste, fine de claire verte with a stronger taste, spéciale de claire which is more fleshy and pousse en claire with a hazelnut-like taste. They're traditionally eaten either raw or hot but without any condiments. However, nowadays it's popular to have sausages, crackers and fresh cream served alongside.

The Marennes-Oléron oysters are the signature food product of the region
Another specialty of La Tremblade is velouté trembladais, fish soup made with fish too small to be sold individually. It includes croutons and butter and is often served with rouille sauce. Chaudrée, the fish soup you can encounter all over Charente-Maritime is made with white wine and potatoes. A specialty of next door île d'Oléron is l'éclade de moules, mussels cooked on a pine needle fire. Mouclade is another mussels dish, made with creme sauce and white wine. Dishes with sardines can be found on many menus and then there are pibales, an eel dish from Mortagne-sur-Gironde south of Royan.
There are local meat dishes as well: grillons (rillettes of meat cooked in its own fat), Saintongenaise rabbit or beef stew (made with cognac and/or Pineau des Charentes), and the cagouilles (little grey snails) served the Charentaise way with white wine and vegetables. On the expensive side, there are caviar de cagouille, i.e. snail eggs.
Local desserts include galette charentaise (a cake with butter and caramellized angelica), les merveilles/beignets (fritters) and millas (a kind of cheese cake).
On the beverage side, the region is known for cognac and Pineau des Charentes (fortified wine drunk as an aperitif). The famous Bordeaux wine region begins across the Garonne river, though there is definitely viticulture in Charente as well.

Spanish churros are very popular in southwestern France too
