Maribo Cathedral

Maribo is a city in Lolland.  This is the main inland town of Lolland with 5,700 inhabitants (2021).  Here you can visit Maribo Cathedral and the beautiful Sønder Lake, which is the primary part of Maribo Lakes National Park.


Understand[edit]
Maribo is the seat of Lolland Municipality. It is a borough and one of the few in Denmark not on the coast.
Maribo dates back to the 15th century. At that time a small village called Skimminge existed here, there is still a street of that name. A convent dedicated to Virgin Mary was established here and the name was changed to Maribo, meaning Mary's home, also Maribo Cathedral was built. The town developed around the convent for the next 100 years or so, but after the reformation the convent was shut down and the town did not see much development for centuries, despite being the seat of Maribo County and of Maribo Diocese. From the middle of the 19th century, an industrial development slowly took off.

Get in[edit]
Maribo is a traffic junction on Lolland.

By plane[edit]
The nearest airport is in Copenhagen 150 km away.

By train[edit]
The local train, Lollandsbanen [formerly dead link] , running between Nakskov and Nykøbing Falster passes through here.  The travel time from either of the two places is around 25 minutes.
Coming from Copenhagen, you will have to change trains in Nykøbing Falster, the total travel time is around 2 hours.  Coming from Rødby, you would also have to travel to Nykøbing Falster and change for Lollandsbanen there, so a local bus is a much faster option.

By bus[edit]
Maribo is a local bus hub with buses from most other places on Lolland.  This includes Rødby Færgehavn (bus 23 or 24, 23 minutes), Sakskøbing (bus 800, 16 minutes), Nykøbing Falster (bus 800, 37 minutes), Bandholm (bus 20, 14 minutes), Knuthenborg (bus 20, 10 minutes), Kragenæs (bus 20, 35 minutes), Nakskov (bus 14 or 800, 35 minutes).  From Nysted you will have to change buses at Toreby.

By car[edit]
Motorway E47 passes just north of Maribo connecting it to Rødby 20 km southwest and in the other direction to Falster, Vordingborg (50 km) and Copenhagen (140 km).  Nakskov is 25 km west.

Get around[edit]
Maribo is small enough to walk around.  There are a few infrequent local buses operated by DOT[dead link].  There are two local taxis reachable at +45 5478 1200 and +45 5478 0500, respectively.  It is possible to rent bikes from Maribo Turistbureau.
