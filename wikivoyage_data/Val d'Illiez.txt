Val d'Illiez is a valley near Monthey in the Swiss region of Valais. Other than the town of Val-d'Illiez (distinguished from the valley by the hyphen in the name), Champéry is the most important town in the valley, being one of the pioneers of early tourism in Switzerland. Furthermore Les Crosets and Champoussin are two smaller ski resorts. Those three stations are part of the Portes du Soleil ski area.


Get in[edit]
The Val d'Illiez has its own train line, the Aigle–Ollon–Monthey–Champéry (AOMC). When coming from Geneva, Lausanne or Sion, most trains will stop in Aigle. From there change to the AOMC which has hourly trains to Val-d'Illiez (45 minutes) and Champéry (1 hour). To get to Les Crosets or Champoussin, change to a bus from Val-d'Illiez. Note however, that there is only a handful of connections every day. Alternatively you can take a taxi which is approximatively Fr. 50 from Val-d'Illiez.
If you are driving, take the exit 18 St-Triphon and follow the signs in direction of Portes du Soleil.
