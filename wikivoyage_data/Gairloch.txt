Not to be confused with Gare Loch, the sea inlet between Helensburgh and the  Rosneath Peninsula
Gairloch is a straggling community along the west coast of Ross and Cromarty in the Scottish Highlands, with a population of 620 in 2020. The land is hilly and farming isn't very productive, but shellfishing remains a traditional occupation.

From 1941 the Allies tried to support the Soviet Union, which had been invaded by Germany. Very few supply routes were open and one was across the Norwegian and Arctic seas to the ports of Murmansk and Archangelsk. Supply ships and their warship escorts assembled in Loch Ewe then sailed in convoy, either direct or via Iceland, across dangerous waters. The loch was fortified against aerial and seaborne attack, and shore facilities were built. This museum tells the convoys' story. Adult £5, child £3. (updated Aug 2022)

Sleep[edit]




Let's camp somewhere else 
If you take the north loop of road past Little Loch Broom, the islands twinkling in the distance are The Summer Isles. But there's another island much closer to shore: the infamous Gruinard. During the Second World War, the British military wanted to test anthrax as a bioweapon - purely for defence of course, no intention of using it themselves. Weaponising anthrax and dispersal is straightforward, but how long would the target area remain unsafe and off-limits? A remote spot was needed, so in 1942 the government purchased Gruinard, put 80 sheep there, and let off a device. The anthrax strain was the highly virulent Vollum 14578, and the sheep soon perished. Forty years later, the island was still unsafe. Activists began demanding a clean-up, and grabbed attention with "Operation Dark Harvest": contaminated soil from the island was left at Porton Down military research facility, and at the Conservative party conference in Blackpool. Decontamination was set in hand, and in 1990 Gruinard was declared safe.
