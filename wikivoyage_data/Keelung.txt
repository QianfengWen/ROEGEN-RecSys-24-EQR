Keelung, also spelled Chilung (基隆; Jīlóng), is a port city in the north of Taiwan, near the capital, Taipei.


Districts[edit]
25°7′27″N 121°43′1″EMap of Keelung
Keelung is divided into 7 administrative districts:


 
Zhongzheng Also written as "Jhongjheng", this district is the city seat of Keelung City. Zhongzheng District includes the nearby Keelung Islet, and the more distant Pengjia Islet, Mianhua Islet and Huaping Islet.



 
Zhongshan As a coastal area, many of the sites are closely related to the sea. This is also where you will find the Baimiweng Fort.



 
Ren-ai At only 4km2 it is the smallest of the districts in Keelung. There are smaller temples dotted around the area and the YM Oceanic Culture and Art Museum.



 
Xinyi An area which contains some of Keelung's parks, and the Gongzi Liao Fort.



 
Anle This district contains Lover's Lake and the Dawulun Fort.



 
Nuannuan Another district peppered with temples to local deities.



 
Qidu The largest district in Keelung, Qidu borders New Taipei City along its western edge.


Get in[edit]
Keelung can be reached from Taipei by either freeway bus or train along the same route, or a longer bus ride along the North coast.
Both means of transport are very frequent, and stops for Keelung bound buses by various companies are located all across Taipei.

By train[edit]
Probably the easiest way to get to Keelung from Taipei is by commuter trains, which ply the route every 15 to 20 minutes and stop at many stations. Travelers heading to Keelung should be aware that although the city lies on the extreme north end of the main Western Line it is not accessible on all trains running north, many of which are bound for the east coast and will not pass through Keelung but branch off at Badu. Only take trains with Keelung clearly shown as their final destination or you may accidentally find yourself on the train to Taitung - a six-hour journey from Keelung! if this happens to you (usually on an express train), get off before the Badu station.

Keelung is a large area which has several stations on the TRA network:

25.1325121.7394441 Keelung station (基隆車站), No. 5, Gangxi Street, Ren’ai District, ☏ +886 2 2426 3743. Built in 1891, this is the main point of access to Keelung city centre.   (updated Jun 2019)
Many of the other districts of Keelung are also connected by the TRA network via the following stations:

25.108338121.7290572 Badu station (八堵車站). Built in 1914, the station has served as an important transfer point between the West Coast line and the Yilan line since 1919.   (updated Jun 2019)
25.0776121.6933 Baifu station (百福車站). The station is mostly used by commuters traveling to and from Keelung and Taipei, and the only trains that stop here are the local trains.   (updated Jun 2019)
25.102331121.7406334 Nuannuan station (暖暖車站), No. 51, Nuannuan Street, Nuannuan District. The station was opened in 1919 and is on the Yilan line.   (updated Jun 2019)

25.1229121.7426 Sankeng station (三坑車站). Only local trains stop at this station.   (updated Jun 2019)
By bus[edit]
The bus from the East-West bus station of the Kuo-Kuang Bus company (the building also serves as the terminal for the Taipei - Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport service) just to the left of Taipei Railway station is the quickest way to get to Keelung.  Buses leave every 10 minutes and go non-stop to Keelung harbor for NT$55 one way, it is best to buy a ticket in advance. Journey time is around 35 minutes under good traffic conditions.  The bus station and ticket booths are clearly marked in English. You can also use the 'Easy Card' that operates with the Taipei Metro and local buses.  Touch on the sensor when you get on and when you get off.
Several companies operate buses between Taipei and Keelung. The journey can range from between 35 minutes to two hours depending upon the route taken and traffic conditions. Because of the large number of bus routes and stops, the high potential for delay, and the limited English ability of most drivers, taking a bus from Taipei to Keelung is probably not a good idea. Unless you are familiar with the greater Taipei geography and can speak some Taiwanese or Mandarin, it is wiser to take a train and transfer to city buses, MRT (Mass Rapid Transit in Taipei) or taxi to reach your final destination.

By boat[edit]
Keelung is one of Taiwan's busiest container ports, second only to Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan thanks to its long deep water harbour. A twice-weekly passenger and goods service to Xiamen is available, operated by the vessel COSCO Star.
A regular domestic ferry to the outlying islands of Matsu is also available, though it is very basic and used mostly by military personnel. The nightly ferry service to Matsu leaves the harbour at 23:00.

Get around[edit]
The downtown area is small enough to cover on foot.
Before you getting around you might visit the Keelung City Tourist Information.  Tel: (02)24287664
Star Cruise also provided a range of cruising line between Keelung and nearby major cities, you might see Keelung as the center of travel hub to plan your holiday.
