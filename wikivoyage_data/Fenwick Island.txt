Understand[edit]
Fenwick Island (pronounced phonetically) is a beach town along the Atlantic Ocean in Sussex County in the southern part of the state of Delaware. The town is located on a barrier island and is home to several beach houses and hotels where visitors stay. Fenwick Island is located just north of Ocean City, Maryland and is a continuation of the development from that town. Fenwick Island, along with Bethany Beach and South Bethany to the north, is along a part of the Delaware coast known as "The Quiet Resorts" as it has a more laid-back atmosphere compared to Rehoboth Beach and Dewey Beach to the north and Ocean City to the south. Many visitors to Fenwick Island come from other parts of Delaware and the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. The peak time for tourists to come to Fenwick Island is between Memorial Day weekend in late May and Labor Day weekend in early September.
