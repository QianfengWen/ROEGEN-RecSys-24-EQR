Nikel (Ни́кель) is a small town in Murmansk Oblast close to the Norwegian border.


Understand[edit]
Nikel is a small industrial town a few kilometres away from the Norwegian border with just over 12,000 souls living and working here, down from 21,000 in Soviet times. As the town's name hint, Nikel owes its existence to the vast quantities of nickel that have been mined nearby since the 1930s. Russian mining giant Norilsk Nickel (cf Norilsk) owns the mines and operates a huge smelter plant just outside the town, where a large part of the population finds employment. The smelter is one of the world's biggest emitters of sulfur dioxide affecting the environment and people living nearby, including those on the other side of the borders. Emissions and the future of the Nikel smelter continues to engage both the Norwegian government and the general population.
Visa requirements have been eased in the last few years in the border area which has led to a large increase of visitors from Norway, mostly interested in cheap gasoline but in the process driving a small boom economy.
