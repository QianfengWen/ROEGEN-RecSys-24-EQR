23.2085587.0844671 Ekteswar Shiva Temple. The temple is dedicated to Shiva, also called Ekteswar. It was built by the Rajas of Bishnupur. The temple was built of laterite but had subsequent additions of sandstone and brick. It is a solid structure, not generally seen in Bengal. The temple was not built in the Bengal style. The top has probably faced damage and so it seems incomplete. Charak Puja is celebrated in the Bengali month of Choitro with great enthusiasm.  (updated Nov 2022)
