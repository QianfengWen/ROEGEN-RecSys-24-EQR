Hamina is a town in Kymenlaakso, in the extreme southeast of Finland.


Understand[edit]
Wooden neighbourhood
Hamina's history dates back to the Swedish rule, when Gustav Vasa gave Hamina Castle and the surrounding land to the merchant town of Hamina in 1653.
Hamina was an important trading town located on the border between Russia and Sweden. Its inhabitants traded with both countries, and trade was very important to the town's economy. Hamina also had an important harbour, from which goods were transported around the world.
In the 19th century, Hamina became even more important as the postal route from Saint Petersburg to Helsinki passed through the town. Along the road there were several inns where travellers could stay and rest.
After the war of 1808–1809, the peace treaty between Russia and Sweden was signed in Hamina Castle, confirming the annexation of Finland to the Russian Empire.
In the 20th century, Hamina's importance as a trading town declined. In 1920, a few years after Finnish independence, Hamina also became an important military town with the establishment of a major garrison - the Reserve Officer School. Their facilities make up the southeastern corner of the old town.

 The circular town plan. The town plan of Hamina is quite unique, with the town hall as the middle point the streets of the city are either encircling it or leading towards it.

60.5684327.192481 Market square (Kauppatori). Food products, flowers, second-hand goods... the selection varies by the day. There's also a small stage with occasional music performances during the summer. (updated May 2023)
60.570727.12512 Disas, Puuropytyntie. The closest thing to a department store or shopping mall in Hamina, this is a fish shop that also has a large range of other food products. Foods other than fish and seafood is packaged or canned (don't expect fresh fruit or bread). It was established to cater to customers from nearby Russia, wherefore it seems rather "under-visited" after COVID and the war in Ukraine with subsequent limitations on allowing in Russians into the EU - it's still open though.
