Spanish River and Domtar mill in Espanola
Espanola is a city in Northern Ontario that founded in the early 1900s for the employees of the Spanish Pulp and Paper Company.  Though still a fine paper town, Espanola is now renowned for its picturesque wilderness, lakes, fishing, camping, hiking and golfing opportunities.


Understand[edit]
Espanola's population has hovered near the 5000-5500 number for the last 30-40 years. It has a beautiful golf course that lies along the Spanish River, several motels, camp grounds and restaurants for visitors, and is the largest shopping area between Sudbury and Sault Ste Marie.

History[edit]
The story of how Espanola got its name dates back to the 18th century where an Ojibwe tribe went out on a raid far away and brought back a Caucasian woman who spoke Spanish.  This woman was said to have married into a First Nations family and taught her children to speak her mother tongue. Later, when French voyageurs would make their way to the mouth of the river they were surprised to hear bits of Spanish spoken by the local natives. Thus giving the town the name “Espagnole” which was later anglicized to “Espanola”.  The river was subsequently then called the Spanish River.
The town of Espanola was founded in the early 1900s for the employees of the Spanish River Pulp and Paper Company.  The town soon populated and housed a hotel, school and theatre.  A couple decades later the mill was closed during the Great Depression and was rendered a ghost town.  During the war Espanola was used as a German prisoner camp and later reopened and produced paper once again.  Throughout the years the pulp and paper mill has become committed to lessening their environmental impact.
The 1969 CBC Television series Adventures in Rainbow Country was filmed near Espanola, close to the small First Nations community of Birch Island and at Whitefish Falls.
