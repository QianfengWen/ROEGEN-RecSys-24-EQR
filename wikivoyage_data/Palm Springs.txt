Joshua Tree National Park – This desert park is a great day trip to take while at Palm Springs. There are two routes to the park, both about an hour drive: north on CA 62 to the north entrance in Joshua Tree Village, or east on I-10 to the south entrance direct off I-10. To loop through the entire park from north to south (or vis-a-versa), plan on a minimum of 4 hours. Camping is allowed as well as rock climbing.
Idyllwild – A mountain resort approximately 45 minutes drive away on the beautiful Palms to Pines highway.  It can also be reached by a scenic 10 mi (16 km) hike from the top of the Palm Springs Tramway.
Salton Sea – Southeast of Palm Springs, California's largest lake formed when an irrigation canal burst in 1905 and flooded the Salton Basin for more than a year.  This unusual area is home to geothermal features, a wildlife refuge, the partially built resort community of Salton City, and the "profoundly strange" artwork of Salvation Mountain in the squatter town of Slab City.
Other nearby desert resort cities include Cathedral City, Desert Hot Springs, Rancho Mirage, Palm Desert, Indian Wells, La Quinta and Indio.
