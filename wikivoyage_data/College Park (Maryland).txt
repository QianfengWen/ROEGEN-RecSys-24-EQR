Get around[edit]
Map of College Park (Maryland)


By car[edit]
The main north-south artery of College Park is Route 1 (also known as Baltimore Ave). Many destinations of interest (including the university) are along this road. An alternative, slightly to the east, is Rhode Island Ave. Major east-west roads include University Boulevard (Route 193) and Campus Drive/Paint Branch Parkway. Route 1 traffic can be horrendous at times. Avoid arriving or leaving College Park during evening rush hours. There is no free parking in College Park, so make sure to check each meter's restrictions and rules.

By bus[edit]
Metrobus J4[dead link] operates service between the University of Maryland and the Metrorail Station.
Shuttle-UM[dead link] operates an extensive bus network, although University of Maryland identification is required to ride for many routes.

By bicycle[edit]
Rhode Island Ave Trolley Trail runs north/south to the east of Route 1 and, north of Route 193, consists of bike lines on Rhode Island Ave. The Paint Branch Trail[dead link] intersects it near Lake Artemesia and runs through campus, up to Cherry Hill Road near the Beltway. College Park has many residential streets that make for easy biking, but some of the major thoroughfares can be dicey.

Stay safe[edit]
Avoid walking alone at night, especially around the College Park Metrorail station. You should be fine along Route 1, but reports of muggings (sometimes violent) on the otherwise upscale-looking side streets are perennials in the student newspaper. Petty theft can also be a problem, especially from vehicles and of bicycles.
