There are many historical sites to see in the Granity area. Up the hill from Granity is Millerton and its Mine Heritage site, and a 90-minute escarpment walk to gorgeous views on a clear day. Down the old road from Millerton you can find the remains of a mining site. Coming down the hill from Millerton, watch for a quick left turn to a stunning waterwall and a dizzying view down its path.
