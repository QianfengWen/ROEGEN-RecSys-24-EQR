Sauteurs (pronounced "Saut-ez") is a fishing village in Grenada, with a population estimated as 1300 in 2016. It's named for the cliff where the last Carib indigenous people leapt to their deaths. 
It's the main settlement of the northern parish of St Patrick, and sights elsewhere in the parish are also described here.

Get around[edit]
Sauteurs itself is small enough to walk round, but you need wheels to explore this spread-out district.

See[edit]
12.2261-61.63951 Leapers Hill is the spot where in 1651 the last three dozen Caribs on Grenada jumped from the cliff rather than be captured or slain by the French. It's nowadays within the town cemetery, with the centre of this straggling settlement just south.
12.22-61.6132 Levera Natural Park centres on a mangrove-festooned crater lake, with a circular trail. The French fortified the hill but the remains of this stand on private property. The nearby beach is a turtle nesting site.
Sugar Loaf is the closest of a chain of three small islands off Levera Beach. It's privately owned and you can't visit.
Green Island the next out is nowadays uninhabited. The beach is on its exposed northeast coast, so swimming may be hazardous.
12.222-61.5863 Sandy Island the last in this chain is the one visited by boat trips, as there's a sandy beach on its sheltered southwest side, and the lagoon has corals. Nearby is the ruin of a mansion. The island is wooded and measures 600 yards north-south by 300 yards east-west, with a boat wreck at its north tip. Don't confuse it with Sandy Island off Carriacou, which is little more than a thin sand bar.
Bird Island is a dot on the horizon seen further east. It's exposed to the full force of the Atlantic and has no safe landing point, so it's best left to the birds.
12.184-61.6114 Lake Antoine is a crater lake surrounded by mangrove. The hiking circuit takes 90 min.
Antoine Bay 500 m east of the crater is black volcanic sand.

Ronde island is the one seen away north of Sauteurs, with Caille Island tucked in besides it. It's privately owned. The island you hope not to see 3 miles further west is "Kick 'em Jenny". This is an active undersea volcano, which in normal circumstances fumes and froths away with no disturbance visible at this distance. The appearance of thick sulphurous clouds, let alone a black ash cone, would mean that the Grenadines are acquiring a new island while experiencing more than a little disruption on all the others.
12.1938-61.64315 Mount Rich Petroglyphs, Belmont, St Patrick, ☏ +1 473 410 9170. The Interpretation Centre displays rock art and other artefacts from the Carib people of the St Patrick River Valley. It remains closed in 2023. (updated Jan 2023)
12.1748-61.62696 Belmont Estate, Belmont, St Patrick, ☏ +1 473 442 9524. Su-F 8AM-4PM. 300 year old plantation. The main produce is cacao beans, made into chocolate, so there's most to see during the harvest. Pods sprout direct from the tree trunk and are hand-picked after six months, with the main harvest Nov-Feb and a smaller one April-June. The pods are rested for three days, then the beans are scooped out and fermented for a week. They turn brown, and are dried on large roller-trays that can be moved between sunlight and shelter. Now they pass to the chocolate manufacturer, where they're roasted, the outer skin discarded, and the inner "nibs" ground up. The pulp becomes liquid and is blended with cocoa butter, milk and sugar to the required taste. Finally the chocolate is shaped into bars or coatings / fillings and packaged. (updated Jan 2023)
