Point Lookout Monument
Lexington Park is a town 60 miles SSE of Washington, D.C. at the mouth of the Patuxent River in Southern Maryland.  The Patuxent River Naval Air Station is adjacent to it.


Understand[edit]
Three Notch Rd is the name for the road commonly known as MD Rt. 235

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Southern Maryland is a peninsula that extends 90 miles to the south of Baltimore and Washington DC.  There are two primary arteries into Southern Maryland, MD Rt. 5 through Charles County, and MD Rt. 4 through Calvert County.

By plane[edit]
Baltimore-Washington International Airport (BWI), 162 Aviation Blvd, Baltimore, Phone: +1 410 859-7027. 86 miles N of Patuxent River, use MD Rt. 4.  While 20 miles further than DCA, BWI is considered by many an easier drive as it avoids Washington DC beltway traffic.
Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA), 1 Aviation Cir, Washington, D.C., Phone: +1 703 417-8000. 64 miles NNW of Patuxent River, use MD Rt. 5.
Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD).  91 miles NW of Patuxent River, use MD Rt. 5.  Dulles is not ideal due to distance and location along the DC Beltway.
