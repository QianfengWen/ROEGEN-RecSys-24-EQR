Portrush (Port Rois, "promontory port") is a resort town on the north coast of Northern Ireland, historically within County Antrim. The council area is Causeway Coast and Glens District. As that name implies, Portrush is a good base for visiting Giant's Causeway and other major attractions along the Antrim coast. It has a population (as of 2011) of 6454, greatly swollen in summer by visitors, when you need to book ahead with accommodation. It also houses many students and staff of the University of Ulster in Coleraine. 
The visitor information centre is in Town Hall by the railway station, open Apr-Sep.
