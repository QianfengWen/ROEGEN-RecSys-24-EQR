Aberdyfi (sometimes spelt Aberdovey) is a village in Gwynedd. It lies at the mouth of the river Dyfi, from which it derives its name. Aberdyfi is a holiday resort, traditionally popular with golfers and sailors but also with more adrenaline-driven sportspeople, and is home to Britain's Best Beach Donkey. The village marks the southern edge of the Snowdonia National Park. It is set by the mouth of the river Dyfi which is a UNESCO world biosphere reserve.

The Bells of Aberdyfi
The Bells of Aberdyfi (Clychau Aberdyfi) is a well-known folk song, popular since the mid-19th century. The bells referred to are not those of the church in Aberdyfi itself, but those of the mythical town of Caer Wyddno, capital of the lost land of Cantre'r Gwaelod (Lowland Hundred) which was lost beneath the waves. There are numerous versions of the story, common to all is that Cantre'r Gwaelod was the most fertile land in Wales, and was protected from the sea by a series of dykes. Sluice Gates were used to allow the rivers to flow out to the sea at low tide, and the gates were shut as the tides rose. The villain of the piece in most versions is named Seithennin, a drunkard. Some versions have him as a visiting nobleman, seducing the lovely Mererid, daughter of King Gwyddno, who was responsible for closing the gates. In other versions, it is Seithennin who was given the job of closing the gates by his father Gwyddno, in the hope that the responsibility would make him grow up. The most obvious "evidence" for the myth is the existence of the Sarnau, long parallel causeways which stretch well out to sea just below the surface, and at some locations are exposed at low tide (local sailors are well aware of them as they can present a hazard). The Sarnau are now thought to have been caused by glacial action, but it's easy to see how they could have been thought to be manmade. The southernmost of these is Sarn Cynfelin, which extends from the coast just south of Borth, on the opposite side of the Dyfi Estuary from Aberdyfi. The town of Caer Wyddno is said to have been located close to this causeway. The petrified forests which can sometimes be seen at Tywyn and Borth beaches, when storms wash the sand away from them, also lend credence to the tales. 


Aberdyfi is easy to get around on foot, though some streets away from the harbour front can be quite steep.

For a more strenuous walk, but one which will reward you with even better views, follow Copperhill St uphill from the village and keep on walking as it turns into a steep country lane. Eventually this leads to the mythical Bearded Lake (Llyn Barfog), scene of a battle between King Arthur and a monster called the Afanc. Arthur's horse left its hoofprint in a nearby rock known as Carn March Arthur. The lake is also the scene of another well-known legend regarding a local farmer and his herd of magic fairy cows. Follow signs to the nearby Echo which is mildly entertaining. If you have a car you can drive up the hill until the tarmac runs out, and leave the car. From here it's only a short walk to the lake.

Beaches and coast[edit]
Due to the fact that is part of a tidal river estuary, the beach at the village itself can be subject to strong and unpredictable currents, so care should be exercised in the water. Better to head half a mile or so north, away from the river mouth. The beach stretches all the way to Tywyn and has a safe reputation due to its gently-shelving nature, though of course sensible precautions should still be taken.
General advice for safe swimming:

A red flag means danger. Do not enter the water if the red flag is flying
Consider bathing at a beach that's under lifeguard protection
Don't swim alone at a deserted beach
Don't use inflatables. They are easily swept away by strong currents
If you see someone in trouble, call 999 and ask for Coastguard
Inquire about swimming conditions at local tourist offices prior to venturing to a beach without lifeguard cover
Read warning notices posted near beach access sites
Mountains[edit]
Snowdonia's mountains claim lives every year. The weather can change very quickly in this part of the World, and this is especially true in the mountains. Make sure you are wearing suitable clothing and footwear, and always carry a suitable map. Ordnance Survey 1:25000 scale Explorer Map OL23 Cadair Idris and Bala Lake is ideal, alternatively the 1:50000 scale Landranger series sheets 124 Dolgellau and Porthmadog and 135 Aberystwyth and Machynlleth.
