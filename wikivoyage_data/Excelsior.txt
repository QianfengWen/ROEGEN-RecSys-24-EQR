Water Street in Excelsior
Excelsior is a city of 2300 people (2018) in the Twin Cities. Excelsior was founded in the 1850s as a destination for vacationers, primarily from the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Excelsior sits on beautiful Lake Minnetonka and offers numerous lake cruises and beaches.


Understand[edit]
Throughout the years, Excelsior's Water Street has been the home to many businesses, including hotels, restaurants, and merchants. Today, Excelsior works hard to maintain its historical identity while renewing various elements of the downtown area.
The Excelsior Commons and Lake Minnetonka are central amenities to the community and are major draws for tourists today. The Minnesota Streetcar Museum, a local transportation museum, maintains a heritage streetcar line in Excelsior and operates three restored streetcars on the line: Twin City Lines No. 1239, Winona Power & Light Co. #10, and Duluth Street Railway No. 78.

History[edit]
Streetcars were used in Excelsior until 1932, when the line was cut back to Hopkins.
A large ballroom called "Danceland" (later "Big Reggie's Danceland") stood across the street from Excelsior Amusement Park from the mid-1920s to 1973. Operated by Ray Colihan, it hosted performances by Lawrence Welk, Fred Waring, and the Andrews Sisters in the 1930s. These acts were followed by the Beach Boys in 1963. In 1964, the Rolling Stones played at Danceland for an audience of 283.
Since 2010, restaurants and eateries have come to dominate the town's commercial landscape. Beyond the downtown district, Excelsior also retains much of its Victorian-era housing stock. Strict building codes are enforced in order to preserve this identity.
