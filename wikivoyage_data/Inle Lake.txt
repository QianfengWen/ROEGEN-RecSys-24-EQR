Traditional stilt homes on Inle Lake

Inle Lake is a shallow lake in the middle of Myanmar, southeast of Mandalay. The lake is 22 km long, and is densely inhabited by many different tribes.

Understand[edit]
Climate[edit]
Due to its higher altitude, temperatures around the lake tend to be cooler than in Mandalay. Winter temperatures often fall below 10°C at night so make sure you are prepared for that.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The closest airport is in Heho, about 45 minutes away by taxi from the main town by Lake Nyaungshwe (walk down the road towards the main highway to negotiate a better rate). Taking a taxi from the airport can be quite expensive, at around 25,000 kyat. Most people share a taxi with 3 people. A good way to save money is to book a taxi in advance with your guesthouse for about 15,000 kyat. 
There are winter and summer rates for flights through all major airlines in the country.

By bus[edit]
Buses depart daily from Yangon and take about 13 hours. Buses take 10 hours from Mandalay. Air conditioned buses from Bagan take 9 hours with JJ express and cost US$11-20 (2 hours from Kalaw) and operate day and night. The journey is a little bumpy although there are frequent stops including for lunch. From Bago 13,000 kyat, 14hr. Bring warmer clothing on the bus as air-con temperatures can get low. If you are looking to sleep, earplugs are a good idea as music will be playing on the video screen in front of the bus.

By pick-up (line-ka)[edit]
A very cheap option from Taunggyi is a pick-up (1 hour and around 600 kyat). Pickup trucks will leave from the main market.

By train[edit]
The next train station is Shwenyaung station, from where Lake Inle can be reached by bus, pick-up or taxi.

Get around[edit]

You can walk around town easily or rent a bicycle for about 1,500 kyat per day, which you also use to tour the surroundings.

See[edit]
20.44535697.1366071 Kakku Pagodas. 2,000 Buddhist pagodas dating back to the 12th century, and an important religious site for the Pa-O ethnic group. South east of the lake in the hills and quite isolated and tricky to get to. Foreigners are required to be accompanied by a local Pa-O guide to access the site, who can be hired at the Tourism Office in Taunggyi. Closes at 17:00. (updated Oct 2017)
20.602996.88152 Kaung Daing village. A small fishermen's village reachable by bicycle. Hot springs & mountain monastery 1 km to the north. There will be boat drivers offering to take you across the lake to Maing Thauk (max 8,000 kyat per boat, 30 minute). (updated Oct 2017)
20.57791296.9601713 Maing Thauk Monastery & Pagoda. 20-30 minutes walk up the hill from Maing Thauk village (updated Oct 2017)
20.45876696.8328734 Shwe Inn Dein Pagoda. A stupa forest. Broken down stupas, some still intact, overgrown with plants, hidden somewhere in the forest around Inle Lake, near Tone Le. You will most likely be the only one there and may feel like you're the first person to ever see them – although there are now shops all along the path. Free entrance, but a 500 kyat camera fee at the bottom. From Nyuang Shwe this is about 90 mins drive. A return taxi will cost in the region of 40,000 kyat. You can also reach it by boat (include it in your daytrip boat tour on the lake, for about 5,000 kyat). Possibly reachable by bicycle as well. (updated Oct 2017)
Do[edit]
Inle lake[edit]

There is a 15,000 Kyat (as of January 2019) entry fee per person to the lake, charged by the government. This fee is often collected at the bus or at the airport when you arrive. The ticket is not checked once you have passed the checkpoint.
A boat trip on the lake is a must do. Most of the trips will visit a few workshops selling local souvenirs, like teak objects, paper, silver and lotus silk fabrics. You can tell your boat driver that you don't want to visit any of them if you are not interested in these shops. However, learning about the local small-scale industries and arts is certainly worth it. Informative guided tours are provided by the shops for free. Bring cash if you consider buying souvenirs.
Upon the canal to the open lake you may see people in traditional clothes standing on one leg in their boat and posing with a fishing basket, presenting then dead caught fish and will finally ask for tips. Full day trip takes about 7 hours and costs 15,000-20,000 kyat, driver will go wherever you tell them to, but remember that he is not a guide nor does he necessarily speak English. Any guesthouse or travel agency can arrange this trip for you. You may have a better experience by chartering a boat directly, clearly agreeing on the planned stops, and starting very early in the morning before most other tour boats, and also allowing you to arrive at market while it's busy. As of 2015, locals claim that the floating market doesn't exist any more due to too many tourists.
For solo travelers in low season, it might be hard to find others to join. So, walk around the jetty and the bridge. Most boats depart between 08:00-11:00.

Please do not photograph people when they are showering or washing plates. Traditional boat in the Floating Gardens
Common stops and things to do:

 Teak and Cheroot. Nan Pan market contains a teak wood workshop and cheroot-making. See and learn how boats are build, and browse through small teak wood souvenirs. See the local cheroots (cigars) being made, but you want to skip buying it here because you get the same stuff at a sixth of the price in the city (normal cheroots can be bought anywhere; but note that the flavoured ones might not be available in Nyaungshwe, but only in some bigger shops in bigger cities). 
 Weaving. In Paw Khae, learn how thread is made and fabric weaved from lotus root string, apart from cotton and silk. The lotus silk fabrics are unique to Inle lake, and can be quite expensive.
 Shan paper. See how Shan paper is made from wood, into colourful lamps and fans. 
 Workshop of long neck people. A few ladies in their traditional clothing as an 'advertisement'. This can be a disturbing sight for some. 
 Gold and silverware. Most tours will include a forge showing how the silver is poured and moulded into rings, 'Shan style earrings' and other jewellery 
 Floating gardens. See how the locals grow tomatoes and other vegetables on the lake (using aquatic plants for support). 
 Floating village and restaurants. A few restaurants sprinkled along the way. Good options for seafood 
20.47450396.8879951 Phaung Daw Oo Pagoda. One of the famous principal shrines in Myanmar. Contains 5 small Buddha statues covered with so much gold leaf that they look like golden snowmen. There are pictures on the walls that show their original appearance. There are also colourful depictions on the walls of tales from Buddha's life, and the story of how the Buddha statues were brought here through an adventurous route. An annual 18-day festival is held, usually in October (sometimes in September), during which four of the Buddhas are carried in a colourful royal barge around 14 villages on the lake. The barge is towed by the boats of leg-rowers and hundreds of boats follow the procession. Large crowds from all the villages nearby gather on the lake's shores to pay homage to the Buddhas and celebrate the occasion. The festival is held on a grand scale with great magnificence and pageantry and is the biggest occasion held on Inle Lake. It is really a splendid sight. Among the dance shows and fun-fairs, the most interesting event of the festival, especially for foreigners, is the traditional Shan boat race – due to their unique leg rowing. It is the only place in the world that one can see such marvelous act.   
20.44624396.8991122 Inthar Heritage House. Also known as "The Burmese Cat House", run by a foundation. Good lunch, and many Burmese cats. 
20.51677596.8955843 Nga Hpe Kyaung (Jumping Cat Monastery). So called because the monks had once trained the cats to jump. But the old monk has died, and so the cats are no longer jumping. However, it is a nice monastery worth the ambience. You can lose yourself merely interpreting the Buddha stories on the walls. 
 Shwe Inn Dein Pagoda. Reachable by boat but you will probably have to pay an extra 5,000 kyat more details in the #See section. 
 Sunset at the lake. When your boatman approaches a fisherman, he will likely do the iconic Inle fisherman pose for you, balancing their net on one leg and leaning over the water. But as you near them, you will find outstretched hands demanding money for the pose. You should to tell your boatman not to wait near the fishermen if you do not wish to pay them. 
 Swimming. The lake temperature is not that cold. The depth is about 2 to 3 metres, ask your boatman to check before if unsure. 
Around the lake[edit]
 Birdwatching. Another worthwhile experience that most tourists miss is to see some of the thousands of waterbirds that use Inle Lake either as a breeding site or on migration. Some are rare species difficult to see anywhere else. December and January are the best times, although some birds, like the spectacular pheasant-tailed Jacana, are best seen in their breeding plumage during the rainy season. The lake is a wildlife sanctuary and the local warden can arrange a knowledgeable guide who knows the English names and can show you where the birds are for a reasonable fee. The fee goes to support the staff of the cash-strapped sanctuary. Bring your own binoculars and get out early when the birds are most active. Ask at your hotel to make arrangements. guide 12,000 kyat, not including boat and boatman. 
 Bicycle rental. Take a day to ride through surrounding villages. Check your rental bike carefully before leaving. $3 to $15 a day. (updated Mar 2023)
 Winery visit. You can reach the Red Mountain Estate (see also #Drink) easily from Nyaungshwe. The bicycle ride to the nearby winery gives a nice view of the sleepy village life, and takes you through some scenic locations. The pamphlets say that the hilly regions near Mandalay and Shan state have been producing robust good quality wine, competing with some of the best from Europe in international wine competitions. At Red mountain estate, you can eat at a restaurant, do a self-tour of the wine press and buy some wine. The ride would be about 40 minutes from NyaungShwe. (updated Oct 2017)
 Short tour (20 km). The most common route: leave Nyaungshwe and head west towards the mountains. Once you reach the T intersection, head south and you'll find the Hot Springs (see below). There's also a small monastery in the mountain opposite. Continue a couple of minutes and you will reach Khaung Daing village. You can cross the lake from there by hiring a boat, the price should not be more than 8,000 kyat for the entire boat. You will be dropped at Maing Thauk village. There's a market a bit south of the village, and a monastery in the mountain to the East. Head back North to Nyaungshwe, you can stop at the winery on your way. The whole loop takes approximately 3 to 4 hours (up to a day if you go slowly, stop for lunch and explore around). (updated Oct 2017)
 Full day tour to Inn Dein (40 km). Start early in Nyaung Shwe and go counterclockwise in direction to the hot springs (sign posts). There is a nice viewpoint just 200 m before the Hot springs (where road bends 90°, look for stairs and climb them). Go south and follow the main road. When you feel like it, branch off and have a look around in the villages. After some time (3-4h, 30 km in total) you will reach a bridge that crosses a canal branching in two (it's the only bridge on the way). Right after the bridge they will ask for a high entrance fee and/or a camera fee of 500 kyat, but Indein is free and the fee might only apply for the tourist shop. Just follow the main asphalt street after the bridge and turn right 50 m after the bridge, cycle up the hill where you can see broken stupas to your right. And straight ahead are the tops of the Indein stupas sticking out between the trees. So continue for about 2 min. When you see the stupas to your right look for a spot where you can pass between the bush. Explore. To go back to Nyaung Shwe go to the bridge again and ask for the jetty. Find a boat to Maing Thauk or Nyaung Shwe (1 or 1.5 h). But beware that prices rise the closer it gets to sunset. People know that you can't make it back cycling and that you depend on the boat service. Prices are around 15,000-18,000 kyat per boat. From Maing Thauk go north (ask for Nyaung Shwe). Nyaung Shwe - Hot Springs: 10 km, Hot Springs - Indein: 20 km, Maing Thauk - Nyaung Shwe: 11 km. Mountain bike not necessary. Sun screen and head cover recommended. (updated Sep 2015)
 Hiking. Day hikes in the surrounding hills, or 3 day hikes to Kalaw are available, and are highly recommended. A typical day hike usually costs about 10,000 kyat per person and starts at 08:00 and ends at 16:00-18:00. The hikes can be very exhausting as they involve a lot of walking (typically 20 km, but you can ask the guide to shorten the trip if you are tired), walking up steep paths and the heat (especially in April) can make it quite tiring too. Bring plenty of water, 2-3 litres per person, as it can be difficult to buy clean water since you won't pass any shops, and good hiking shoes or boots. On a typical trip one will walk through mountains, forests and many villages inhabited by hill tribes, but don't expect to see them dressed in fancy hill tribe outfits as this is real life and for tourists. Even if a hike is tiring, it gives the opportunity to get a glimpse of real life around Inle Lake and see some nice scenery too. It's usually not a tourist trap like the boat trip on the lake often is. 
 Hot Springs. Rent a bike for the day (around US$2) and cycle the bumpy road towards the mountains (West of Nyaungshwe) for 45 minutes to visit the hot springs for a relaxing afternoon. The hot springs are actually 3 swimming pools in a big concrete spa centre, so you do not go there for the natural surroundings. The bike ride to the spa however is very scenic and worthwhile. The private pools have a full bar. US$8 per person for the private pools including a towel. 
 Roller Skate (Yone Gyi Street (main road)). 09:00 - 21:00. Roller skating rink where the youth performs stunning tricks while Western Pop music is playing. Plastic bags for your feet are free. 1,000 kyat per hour, includes rental. (updated Sep 2015)
20.66131496.934861 Aung Puppet Show (Near Nandawunn Hotel), ☏ +95936201984. 19:00 & 20:30, for half an hour. Myanmar traditional dancing by puppets. Aung the pupper master is the 4th generation, and the 5th is coming as he's assisted by his young son. Possible to some of the puppets. 5,000 kyat. (updated May 2018)
Buy[edit]
Remember to bargain, Inle Lake is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Myanmar. Prices will routinely be double what locals would pay. Products that appear old are fake (such as opium weight sets) and many goods being offered by shops are cheap products made for the tourist trade.
