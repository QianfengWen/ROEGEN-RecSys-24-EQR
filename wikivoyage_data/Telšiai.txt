Telšiai is the chief city of Samogitia region in Lithuania, with a population of 22,261 in 2023. It's industrial but has preserved many buildings of its Old Town.


Understand[edit]
The city was named after Telšė the stream flowing into Lake Mastis; the name means "flowing water". Telšiai was first documented around 1450 and became the chief town of Samogitia region, and remains so. During the 1831 and 1863 uprisings against Tsarist rule, Telšiai was a centre for the Polish–Lithuanian insurgents; Russia crushed them and strengthened its grip. In World War I the town was occupied by the Germans then by the Russians, who withdrew to leave Lithuania independent. Telšiai grew and industrialised during the next 20 years then again found itself caught between those ruthless powers. Memorials to the massacres of 1941 stand in several places.
Major industries in Telšiai are the Orlen oil refinery, food, furniture, wood and metal-bashing. These have left the old town centre relatively unscathed.
Visit Telsiai is the Tourist Information Centre, at Turgaus Aikštė 21 in town centre. It's open M-F 08:00-17:00, Sa 10:00-15:00.

The churchyard fountain is dedicated to Kazimieras Simonavičius (c 1600-51), the world's first rocket engineer. He wrote the first textbook "Artis Magnae Artilleriae" and invented the concepts of fin stabilisers, multi-stage propulsion, and packing bio-warheads with the saliva of rabid dogs, much more efficient than launching entire rabid dogs.

55.964222.29477 Rainiai Chapel commemorates the massacre of over 70 political prisoners by the Soviets on 24 / 25 June 1941. They were being held in Telsiai; the Germans were advancing and would likely free them, so they were brought to Rainiai forest. Elaborate tortures were carried out before they were killed. Those responsible were protected by Russia, and it was only possible to build the chapel after independence.
Holocaust memorials stand in several places in the surrounding woods and fields, including one 500 m south of Rainiai Chapel. The Germans found it convenient to blame the Jews for the Rainiai massacre, so first the men were tortured then shot. The women and children were marched to Geruliai 10 km east, along with those from other towns, then at the end of August 1941 most were shot. Some 500 younger women still had a use as labour and sex slaves, so they were kept until December. Of the 2800 Jewish population at the start of the war, only 64 fugitives survived.
