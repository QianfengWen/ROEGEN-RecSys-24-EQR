Hillswick is a small village on the Mainland of the Shetland Islands. It's the main settlement on the Northmavine peninsula, connected to the rest of Mainland by the road along Mavis Grind, the narrow isthmus by the village of Brae - so narrow you can almost hurl a stone from the Atlantic Ocean to the North Sea side. All of Northmavine in 2011 had a population of 741. 


Get in[edit]
Hillswick is 35 miles north of Lerwick along A970, say 50 min by car.

Hillswick is a tiny village, but you need wheels to get around the peninsula.

See[edit]
 Hillswick Wildlife Sanctuary, The Booth, ZE2 9RW (next to shop and hotel), ☏ +44 1806 503348. Cares for injured seals, otters and other wildlife. (updated Jul 2019)
60.507-1.4521 Ronas Voe is the inlet north of Hillswick. In 1674 the Dutch East India ship Wapen van Rotterdam was storm-damaged and took shelter here but was trapped by four British ships. The ensuing one-sided artillery battle was the last act of the Third Anglo-Dutch war, with a treaty already signed. An unknown number of Dutch seamen were killed, perhaps as many as 300, and lie in a mass grave by the shore with a small granite marker. Their ship was taken as a prize: it was later just used as a hulk until scrapped.
Tangwick Haa Museum near Esha Ness didn't open in 2021.
60.4895-1.62632 Esha Ness has cliffs notched by the deep Calder's Geo, and with a Stevenson lighthouse. 1 km north is an Iron Age broch by a freshwater lake, and Holes of Scraada a sea-filled chasm that kayakers can enter.
Hamnavoe is the inlet north of Esha Ness. The Giant's Stones are a pair 20 m apart on the heath: probably aligned with something, as many were, but it's difficult to place two stones 20 m apart without them creating a line.
60.467-1.63 Dore Holm is an islet with a great natural arch that looks like a horse drinking deeply from the water.
Isle of Stenness is the low-lying islet southwest of Stenness beach. It's just grazing land and its main job is to shelter the beach.
60.552-1.3424 Beorgs of Housetter or Giant's Garden is the boulder-littered hillside by the road north to Isbister. The two main stones of 2 m and 2.7 m are indistinct at the foot of the hill.
Aircraft in a garden: look right half a mile north of North Roe village for this unusual garden ornament, a Potez 840. F-BMCY was a 1960s French single-engine 18-seater plane. On 29 March 1981 on approach to Sumburgh, the landing gear jammed and the pilot opted to make a belly-flop wheels-up landing. It slithered to a halt and the two crew and five passengers were unhurt. It was left on the perimeter as a hulk until 2007 then the fuselage was brought here.
60.63-1.325 Fethaland is the most northerly point of Mainland, though the islands of Yell and Unst stretch beyond. The public road ends at Isbister but rough tracks continue. Fethaland is an abandoned fishing station: it was only occupied seasonally. Fishing was by long line from open boats, easily upset or swamped in high seas, and rendered obsolete by 19th century trawlers. There's also remains of a prehistoric house. Near the tip of the peninsula, the lighthouse is a modern metal tower, functional but not photogenic.
Do[edit]
Dore Holm
Walk around. There are some lovely walks just beyond the village.
60.53393-1.446051 Ronas Hill is the highest peak in Shetland at 450 m / 1480 ft, a "Marilyn". There's a Neolithic chambered cairn near the summit. These moors are the only place in the UK with Arctic tundra.

A century-old hotel which was built in Norway then transported for an exhibition to the mainland before being dismantled and then set up here. Decent restaurant and bar. B&B double from £120. (updated Jul 2019)
Almara B&B at Urafirth 2 miles north of Hillswick didn't open in 2021.
