Beverly Minster
Beverley is the county town of East Yorkshire (or "East Riding") in the north of England. The name used to be "Bevreli", beaver clearing, for the beavers in the River Hull that chomped the medieval woodlands. It's escaped heavy industry and remains a pleasant market town, with a population in 2011 of 19,000. It gave its name to Beverly, Massachusetts, which in turn gave its name to Beverly Hills, California. 


Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
53.842-0.4211 Beverley train station, Station Square, HU17 0AS (the east side of town centre). Trains run twice an hour from Hull, taking 15 min to Beverley and continuing to Bridlington, Filey and Scarborough. These trains usually originate from Doncaster or York on the East Coast mainline. The other route is to take the train from York towards Scarborough and change at Seamer for the southbound train to Hull, but it's not the most reliable connection. Within the station is an upmarket restaurant; it's not the place for quick bites while you await the lumbering diesel railcar to Hull.   
By bus[edit]
East Yorkshire Bus X46 / X47 plies between York, Beverley and Hull, M-Sa hourly and Su every two hours.
Bus 121 runs hourly from Hull to Beverley and continues to Driffield and Bridlington; this bus no longer continues to Scarborough. 
Bus 246 ambles from Hull every 30 min to Beverley and continues to Hornsea. 
Long-distance buses don't visit Beverley, change in Hull or York. Beverley 53.844-0.4322 bus station is central on New Walkergate. 

By car[edit]
The main route from the south is A164 from Humber Bridge, continuing towards Bridlington. A1079 runs near town between York and Hull.
