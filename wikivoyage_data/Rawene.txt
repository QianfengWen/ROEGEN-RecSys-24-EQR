Rawene is a town in Hokianga, New Zealand. It is the third-oldest European settlement in New Zealand.


Understand[edit]
It is a picturesque village on a peninsula jutting into the Hokianga Harbour, about half-way up the harbour. It is known as the town where the sun both rises and sets. Dolphins and orca are often seen here, sometimes following the ferry that crosses the harbour to Kohukohu.

Get in[edit]
From the south, approach on SH12, then turn onto Rawene Road and drive 6 km north.
From the north, take the vehicle ferry across the harbour from the terminal near Kohukohu. The ferry is hourly in each direction, except that there are additional services early morning, and at peak periods a shuttle service operates. Timetable.
