Jalpa is a colonial town in the state of Zacatecas in western Mexico. It is a picturesque small town with colonial architecture, narrow cobblestone streets, and some beautiful old churches from the colonial era.


Understand[edit]
The first Spanish conquistadors in the area were scouting the region for possible gold and silver deposits. At the time, the area was populated primarily by the Caxcan indigenous people, a Mexica group related to the Aztec. The Spanish founded their settlement in 1532. An indigenous uprising called the Mixton War resulted in conquistador Diego Fernandez de Proaño being expelled from Jalpa. After the uprising was put down, the first churches were built starting in 1542.
At one point, the town was known as Jalpa Mineral in recognition of its mining industry. Mining was important through the 18th century when gold, silver, and tin were extracted in large quantities. Two local mines were in operation: Mina La Leonra and Mina Monroy. By the early 19th century, the mines in Jalpa were in decline. In 1858, a rare mineral was first discovered in the Leonora mine, it was called jalpaite.
