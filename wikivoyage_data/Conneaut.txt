Buy[edit]
Conneaut has very few shopping options within the city itself. Many residents travel to other nearby cities, such as Ashtabula, Erie, Mentor, and the Youngstown area (all within 90 minutes of Conneaut), for major shopping needs.
The small downtown area does contain several small stores, including Orlando Brothers' Golden Dawn on Main Street near Buffalo Street, a grocery store that has served Conneaut since 1977.

 Conneaut Plaza (located on the city's west side, on Route 20). Contains Family Dollar, Save-A-Lot, and Cheap Tobacco (a small local chain). Although mostly vacant and dilapidated, it is still heavily patronized by local residents. (updated Nov 2018)
Eat[edit]
 White Turkey Drive-In, 386 E Main Road (located on Route 5/20), ☏ +1 440 593-2209. This classic drive-in was established in 1952 and is known for its turkey sandwiches and frosty root beers.  The crowd is likely to consist of equal parts locals, tourists, classic car owners, and motorcycle gangs, making for an interesting people-watching opportunity. $5 for a sandwich and drink.
