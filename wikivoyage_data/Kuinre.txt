Remains of the Kuinderburcht
Kuinre is a village of 930 people (2021) in the Dutch province of Overijssel. In this beautiful old town you can find the ruins of an old castle in the forest "Kuinderbos".


Understand[edit]
Kuinre, believed to have been founded around 1100 AD, was a separate municipality until 1973, when it became a part of IJsselham, which in turn merged into the municipality of Steenwijkerland in 2001.
Kuinre is a former coastal town with a very rich history. Back in the days of the Zuiderzee, Kuinre's harbour was one of the most important ports of the Zuiderzee. After completion of the Noordoostpolder Kuinre became landlocked unlike almost all of the other old coastal towns of the former sea; companies, shops, and fishermen went out of business.
Nowadays you can still see and visit the old harbour completely landlocked.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
From Amsterdam, Almere, Heerenveen and Sneek[edit]
To get to Kuinre by car, use the A6 highway, which connects to the A7 between Heerenveen and Sneek in the north, and the A1 near Naarden in the south. Use exit 15 on the A6 (Emmeloord), to turn onto the N351 driving away from Emmeloord. You'll soon find yourself on a T-intersection, where you should turn left to stay on the N351. Following this road will take you directly to Kuinre.

From Enschede[edit]
To get to Kuinre from Enschede, use the A35 followed by the N35 to head west. Once the N35 meets the A28 in Zwolle, turn right heading for Meppel. Near Meppel, on Knooppunt Lankhorst, head onto the A32. After some driving, use exit 8 and turn left on the roundabout onto the N351. Follow this road through Wolvega until eventually you reach Kuinre.
