Stratford is in Taranaki, New Zealand. Sitting on the banks of the Patea River, Stratford enjoys impressive views of Mount Taranaki/Egmont. The mountain provides a year-round source of recreation, with skiing, hiking, climbing and scenic walks. Trout fishing is popular at the region's rivers and streams, and the town boasts several fine gardens, including Te Popo. South of Stratford, the Taranaki Pioneer Village houses a collection of historic buildings. The Stratford-Taumaranui Heritage Trail also takes in historic sites - a booklet about the trail is available at the visitor centre.
