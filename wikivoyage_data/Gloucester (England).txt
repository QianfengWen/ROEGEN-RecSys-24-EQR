Gloucester Cathedral
Gloucester (pronounced "gloster") is the county town of Gloucestershire in England's West Country. A major attraction of the city is Gloucester Cathedral, which is the burial place of King Edward II. Other features of interest include the museum and school of art and science, the former county jail (on the site of a Saxon and Norman castle), the Shire Hall (now headquarters of the County Council) and the Whitefield memorial church. A park in the south of the city contains a spa, a chalybeate spring having been discovered in 1814.


Understand[edit]
The city of Gloucester is the furthest inland port in the UK, situated beside the River Severn. It inspired the old English nursery rhyme:

"Dr Foster went to Gloucester in a shower of rain.
He stepped in a puddle,
Right up to his middle,
And never went back again."
'Dick Whittington', born around 1350, a well-known character through the pantomime story, has connections with Gloucester. The story is based on the real-life Richard Whittington, who, unlike his pantomime character, was not poor, being the third son of Sir William Whittington of Gloucester. The traditional tale has a 'poor' Dick going to London to seek his fortune, but he eventually becomes Lord Mayor of London.
A traditional rhyme is associated with this episode, as follows:
"Turn again, Whittington,
Once Mayor of London,
Turn again, Whittington,
Twice Mayor of London,
Turn again, Whittington,
Thrice Mayor of London!"
The city is also known for 'The Tailor of Gloucester', a children's novel by Beatrix Potter that was first published in 1903. It is traditionally read to children on Christmas Eve, just before bedtime.
It was a main Roman city, Glevum—Roman tunnels and fortifications exist underneath the city centre and can be visited through the museum.

Language[edit]
As a provincial British town, you will almost certainly need to be able to speak English to get around in Gloucester. There is a sizable immigrant population in Gloucester from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Poland and the Czech Republic so you may have more luck with these people should you speak one of their languages. Gloucester also has a large (for the region) black (mainly of Caribbean origin) community.
The Tourist Information Office has literature in most major languages, including Japanese.
Generally, the Gloucester accent is clear to understand and isn't peppered with dialect terms. However, understandably for the area, there is a West Country 'burr' and tourists whose experience of English accents is limited to either Cockney or Queen's English (Received Pronunciation) may notice this. The 'burr' becomes more pronounced more westerly, in the nearby Forest of Dean.

By car[edit]
Gloucester is well served by the motorway system and can easily be accessed by junctions 11, 11a and 12 on the M5.  It also lies on the A38 and is easily accessible from Wales (Gloucester is the most southerly point on the River Severn with a bridge—apart from the motorway Severn Bridges near Bristol and Newport).  Because Gloucester was a major Roman city, it has very good A road connections throughout Gloucestershire and the Cotswolds.
