Understand[edit]
Super tubes
The Jeffreys Bay region is renowned for its gorgeous beaches, never ending summers, plentiful shells and is best known as “the Surf Mecca of the World”. The beautiful beaches are safe for bathing and provide endless excitement for water sports.
2 km south of JBay is Marina Martinique, a development on 5 km of man-made saltwater canals. 2½ km north, is the beautiful valley of Kabeljousriver with its waterfall. These are good places to stay if you like a bit more peace and quiet than accommodation in town can offer. Aston Bay borders on Marina Martinique and if you cross the causeway over the lagoon of the Seekoi River, you come to Paradise Beach.
Paradise Beach is relatively undeveloped with 6 km of unspoiled beach all the way to the Kromm River which separates it from St Francis. It is not recommended to swim across the river.
Ocean temperatures are around 23°C in summer.
