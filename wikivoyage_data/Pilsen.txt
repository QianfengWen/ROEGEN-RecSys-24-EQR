Pilsen (Czech: Plzeň) is in Bohemia, in the Czech Republic in Central Europe. It is the home and birthplace of the Pilsener (or pilsner) beer variety which is derived from the city's name. It is the 4th largest city in the country and the largest city in West Bohemia, and is a convenient base for exploring this region of the Czech Republic.


Get in[edit]
The city is well connected with both buses and trains leaving hourly from Prague. Travel times for both buses and trains are just over one hour. From Germany, there are direct trains every two hours from Munich taking about 4½ hours. Another possibility is 3 hour travel from Nuremberg via Marktredwitz and Cheb which takes about 3 hours. From south it's also possible to reach the city using railway from direction of Železná Ruda (via Klatovy) where one can enjoy spectacular views of Sumava mountain range along the more than century old railway track. Last option via railway is from direction of Austrian city of Gmund via České Budějovice. The railway connections remain consistent even during the weekend.
Numerous bus companies connect the city with other European cities and stop at the central bus station, however the connections are usually a subject to reservation, meanwhile trains maintain their intervals during whole week including the weekends and don't require a reservation.
Both rail and bus stations are within walking distance from the city centre.

Pilsen is the city where the pilsner beer was invented. Pilsner Urquell is the famous beer brand of Pilsen. In a few pubs (Senk Na Parkanu) and at the brewery, you can get the unfiltered, unpasteurized version of Pilsner Urquell, which tastes even better that the common filtered version.
