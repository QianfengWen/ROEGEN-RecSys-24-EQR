View of Formentor
The 365 Calvari Steps
Pollença is a town in Mallorca, one of Spain's Balearic Islands. Nestled at the feet of the Serra de Tramuntana, the mountain chain along Mallorca's northern coast, it is a very attractive traditional Mallorcan town which is a world away from the package holiday resorts found elsewhere on the island.


Get in[edit]
Pollença is in the north-east of the island. You reach it from the Palma - Alcudia highway, the turn to Pollença is some 40 km from Palma and after that you have 7 km by fair road. From the airport, Pollença is reached by taking the Palma direction, taking the first turn off (el Coll d'en Rebassa) and heading for Inca until you hit the Palma-Inca (and on to Port d'Alcudia) highway. After that, see above.
Driving and parking in Pollença is awful. Try to find a parking spot on the lower part of the city where you enter it, and walk from there. Walking is no problem with strollers and wheelchairs in this small town, although the town rises towards El Calvario.

Get around[edit]

39.869063.022642 Puig de Pollença (Puig de Maria). Climb to the top. It is an easy hike. You will meet goats and cats. The name Puig de Pollença or Puig de Maria refers to the hill as well as to the ancient hermit nun's monastery on its top. Its origins reach back to 1348. Main parts of the complex have been built in the 15th century. After 1564, it was only sporadically used as monastery, while the church had been maintained during all the centuries as a pilgrim church. The last nuns left the convent in 1988. Since then, it is used as a hostel. Its location high over the town of Pollença and the old, venerable but simple buildings together with the view on the coastline, the Serra de Tramuntana and the wide plane give quite a mystical atmosphere. In the outer yard, there are several fireplaces and tables for one-day-visitors and there is a bar and restaurant service provided by the keeper family - prices are moderate. If you sit outside you have a lunch with a spectacular view. Do not miss the nearby viewpoint Mirador del Molí Vell free. (updated Dec 2017)

At the end of the picnic area, you will find the starting point of the path to the Coll de la Creu. There is no sign, just follow the cairns. A few hundred meters later, you will see the Cami Vell del Far winding up to the pass. Try to follow the stone track as much as possible, avoiding shortcuts which destroy the track.

Hotels[edit]

Internet access[edit]
There's a very helpful internet shop on Calle del Mercat which also has color print available.
Pollenca has its share of Wi-Fi access points, and there's even a wlan network over the town - although information on how to access this is hard to come by.
For public, immdiate use, either look around or use the Emilton café on calle Sant Domingo - it's a typical Spanish cafe with locals and nothing to see. Other places are the youth club Club Formentor and the restaurant next to it on calle Joan Mas/Costa i LLobera. Wi-Fi access is free in these places as long as you eat or drink.

For children[edit]
Playgrounds are located in calle Sant Domingo and in the NE part of town. The former is covered in trees providing much-needed shade and has a rather big and modern selection of stuff to do for kids.
Go next[edit]
Port de Pollenca - the nearest beach (it's also a very good beach!)
Cala Sant Vicenc - just as close, it consists of 4 small beaches with some okay restaurants attached to them. Great mountain views in the bay, popular with children.
Formentor - the beach on the Formentor Peninsula is after the first viewpoint, at a large parking lot (the only one to pass on your way to Cap de Formentor) is also very nice, with all amenities. It seems there's a pier here so boat trips from Alcudia might be available in high season.
Alcudia - give the package holiday resort a miss, and head to the Roman ruins around the old town. Or hike the remarkably undeveloped peninsula which has several good trails.
Palma de Mallorca - Mallorca's capital, full of things to do, and places to see (the Banys Arabes are fantastic)
Soller and Port de Soller - don't drive there directly. Go to Palma and catch the Soller train - the best way to see Mallorca!
S'Albufera Natural Park - a fantastic place to come and see the fantastic birdlife that exists on Mallorca.
