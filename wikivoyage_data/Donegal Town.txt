Donegal Town is a town in County Donegal in northwest Ireland. With a population of 2618 in 2016, it's neither the county town - that's tiny Lifford - nor the county's largest - that's Letterkenny. It's a small place clustered around its plaza "The Diamond", with the River Eske flowing out of the Bluestack Mountains into the bay. It makes a good base for touring south County Donegal. 
54.652-8.1121 Donegal Tourist Information Centre is on The Quay, open Tu-Sa 09:00-17:00.

See[edit]
54.6504-8.11521 Donegal Abbey, Glebe, Donegal. 24 hours. This was a Franciscan Priory established in 1474. It was the scene of a battle in 1601 during the Nine Year's War between the English Tudors and the area's Gaelic rulers: a gunpowder keg caught fire and that was the end of the abbey and anyone in the vicinity. So there's just a few shards of masonry and you mostly come for the scenic old graveyard overlooking the estuary. Free.   (updated Aug 2021)
The Diamond is town centre. The obelisk commemorates "The Annals of the Four Masters", a semi-historical catalogue compiled hereabouts in 1632-36. By then the abbey was in small pieces and its friars were making do in a nearby cottage and in a house near Ballyshannon. Only the chief author was a friar, but they became known as na Ceithre Máistrí, anglicised as "Four Masters".
St Patrick's Church of the Four Masters east end of The Diamond is RC, in sort-of-Romanesque with a Round Tower, but it only dates from 1935.
Parish church next to the castle is C of I, built in confident Gothic in 1828.
 Donegal Castle, Castle St F94 P996 (north side of Diamond). Apr-Oct daily 10:00-18:00, Nov-Dec Th-M 09:30-16:30. It wasn't just the Normans who built substantial stone castles - this one was erected in 1474 by Red Hugh O'Donnell at the same time as the abbey. That dynasty held it until they fled Ulster in 1607 after the Nine Years War. They torched it to prevent its use against the local Irish, but it was soon restored and extended by the incomers in Jacobean style. It fell into ruin in the 18th century but was restored from the 1990s and is now an event space. Adult €5, conc €4, child €3.   (updated Aug 2021)
54.6569-8.10822 Donegal Railway Heritage Centre, Old Station House, Tyrconnell St, ☏ +353 74 972 2655. Apr-Sep M-Sa 10:00-17:00, Su 12:00-16:00. Two narrow-gauge railways huffed and puffed across the county from 1863 to 1959, connecting Donegal to Strabane, Derry and Letterkenny - the 36 inch gauge was cheaper to construct than standard Irish gauge of 63 inch. The Centre displays their history and has a steam locomotive and a railcar from that era, though not in working order. Adult €5, conc €4, child €3.   (updated Aug 2021)
St Patrick's Church
The Famine Graveyard is on Upper Main St by the hospital.

Magherabeg Friary is a ruin 3 km south of town off R267: it's on private land and not usually accessible. It was built around 1430 so it pre-dates the main abbey, but its friars were lowly "Third Order Franciscans" - lay brothers not ordained as priests. It was abandoned and handed over to English landowners along with the main abbey around 1607.
54.605-8.1624 Murvagh Beach is a 4.5 km sandy beach backed by dunes and the golf course. Dogs on leash only.
54.55-8.2115 Rossnowlagh Beach is 4 km long. It's exposed to the Atlantic, which funnels into the bay and can generate big surfing waves. At low tide you can walk all the way to Murvagh. Many people park on the beach, but beware the speed of the incoming tide.
54.646389-8.1955566 Mountcharles is a village straggling along N56 six km west of Donegal. The estuary marshes to its south were historically used for salt extraction. The main attraction, near the pier, is Salthill Gardens, open Apr-Sept M-Sa 14:00-18:00.
54.57-8.467 St John's Point is a long rat's-tail peninsula starting ten km west of town. McSwyne's Castle and Ballysaggart Friary are just stumps of masonry. Near the tip is a sheltered sandy beach, and the peninsula ends with the EIRE 70 wartime aviation marker and a lighthouse - this is still active and you can't go in.
Killaghtee Old Church just west of the start of the peninsula is a 12th century ruin with an unusual "Maltese Cross" gravestone from 650 AD.
