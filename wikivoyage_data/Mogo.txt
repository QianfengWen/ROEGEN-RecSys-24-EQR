Get in and around[edit]
Map of Mogo
The town is along the Princes Highway (A1), 9 km (5.6 mi) south from Batemans Bay and 16 km (9.9 mi) north of Moruya. You will need to bring a car with you as there's little public transport in this very car-centric part of NSW. 
While you can use the 700-1 bus route, Mogo's attractions are outside the town centre meaning you will need a car to visit these attractions (unless you're willing to walk at least 2 kilometres on highways without footpaths).

-35.7952150.15851 Mogo Wildlife Park (Mogo Zoo), 222 Tomakin Rd, ☏ +61 2 9622 1644, info@austwp.com.au. Daily 9AM–4PM. The town's main attraction may not be a very large zoo, but it does contain some unusually exotic species such as the red panda (only found in Nepal and Tibet), snow leopard (primarily found in Hemis National Park in Ladakh), or the black-and-white ruffed lemur (only found in pockets in Madagascar). In fact, the zoo is unusually unique among rural Australian zoos in the sense that this zoo's exclusive focus is on exotic, endangered species, not animals in general.   (updated Sep 2022)
-35.7532150.16192 Eurobodalla Regional Botanic Garden, Deep Creek Dam Road, ☏ +61 2 4471 2544, contact@erbg.org.au. W–Su 9AM–4PM (closed M Tu). Located halfway between Mogo town centre and Batemans Bay, this mid-sized regional botanic garden contains many plants from the Eurobodalla and Shoalhaven regions. Much of it was destroyed during the 2019–20 Black Summer bushfires, but some gardens and the visitor's centre remain. (updated Sep 2022)
