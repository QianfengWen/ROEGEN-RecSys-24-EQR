Eat[edit]
There are lots and lots of small cheap restaurants, where they are grilling fish (sardines, etc.), chickens outside. Normally it pays off to frequent the smaller streets. On the waterfront and major squares you will find it much more expensive.
Lots of nice cafés on the Praça Sousa Oliveira. Not cheap but with a good view of the bustling life.

Arriving at the bus station one will normally be "hijacked" by a group of women who offer private rooms. It's quite cheap, normally central and the easiest way to get a place to sleep (follow the woman of your choice to see the quarters, but beware – they're very fast).
