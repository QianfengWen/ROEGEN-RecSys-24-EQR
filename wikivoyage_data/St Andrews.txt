St Andrews is a town on the coast of Fife in northeast Scotland. With a population of 16,930 in 2021, it's an attractive place famous for its ancient university and as the "home of golf".


Understand[edit]
St Andrews Castle
St Andrews in medieval times was the ecclesiastical capital of Scotland, and its cathedral was the most important in the country. But from the 15th century there was religious turbulence: John Knox preached here, two other Lutheran preachers were burned as heretics, the cardinal was lynched as revenge and the cathedral and bishop's castle were wrecked.
The university was founded in 1413, making it the oldest in Scotland, and the third oldest in the English-speaking world. Today the university dominates the town, particularly during term-time. It is often perceived as being elitist: for instance, Prince William studied geography here and met Kate Middleton, who was studying history of art; they are now known as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.
St Andrews proclaims itself as the "home of golf". The game was invented in the Low Countries and adopted in Scotland in the Middle Ages, with the first rulebook written in Edinburgh in the 17th century. That game was played over entirely natural courses of no fixed length. The contribution of the Royal and Ancient here was to create a groomed or maintained course of 18 holes and codify the rules accordingly. The R&A thus co-hosts the game's worldwide ruling body and owns several golf courses, including the renowned Old Course. St Andrews is mobbed when a major tournament is in town, especially during the Dunhill Cup in October, and the Open Championship in July every five years.

Get in[edit]
St Salvator's Quad
By plane[edit]
Edinburgh Airport (EDI IATA) has the best selection of flights. From there take Stagecoach Bus Jet 747 to Inverkeithing in Fife to catch the hourly train to Leuchars and Dundee, or to Halbeath for the hourly bus. Otherwise take the tram or bus from the airport to Edinburgh Haymarket for trains or buses.
Glasgow Airport (GLA IATA) also has a good range of flights, and an hourly direct bus to St Andrews, see below.
Dundee Airport (DND IATA) has flights from London Stansted by Loganair, twice a day M-F and once on Sunday. Apr-Oct they also fly from London City (LCY) and Belfast City (BHD).

By train[edit]
Wikivoyage has a guide to Rail travel in Great Britain
56.375-2.8931 Leuchars railway station is 6 miles west of town. This has two trains an hour from Edinburgh, taking an hour, and continuing to Dundee, Arbroath and Aberdeen. There are two direct daytime trains from London Kings Cross heading for Aberdeen, otherwise change in Edinburgh. The overnight Highland Sleeper from London Euston also calls here, but before 6AM; you might prefer to take the Lowland Sleeper to Edinburgh then a day train.
Stagecoach Bus 99 from Dundee takes 10 min between Leuchars station and St Andrews, see below. A combined train+bus ticket is slightly cheaper than separate fares.
A taxi from Leuchars costs £15 to the centre of St Andrews.

By bus[edit]
St Mary's Quad
Stagecoach Fife Bus 99 runs 5:30AM-11PM from Dundee via Leuchars station to St Andrews; daytime it's every 10 min. There are night buses to 3AM on Friday and Saturday night.
Bus X59 runs hourly from Edinburgh St Andrew Square to St Andrews, taking just over 2 hours via Halbeath and Glenrothes, with the last bus at 5:50PM.
Bus X24 runs hourly from Glasgow Airport via Glasgow Buchanan station, Cumbernauld, Dunfermline, Halbeath and Glenrothes to St Andrews, taking 3 hr 30 min with the last bus at 6:20PM.
Bus 95 follows the coast south from St Andrews through Kingsbarns, Crail, Anstruther, Pittenweem, Elie, Upper Largo and Lower Largo to Leven. It runs hourly, daily.
56.341-2.8032 St Andrews Bus Station is central, on City Road.

By road[edit]
By car from the south follow M90 over the Forth on Queen's Crossing (no toll) then A91 east to town.
National Bike Route 1 crosses the Forth by the old bridge, then meanders via Dunfermline, Kinross, Auchtermuchty, and along the lanes south of A91 into St Andrews. It continues north through Guardbridge and Leuchars to Dundee; then, if you're really up for it, to Aberdeen, Inverness, John O'Groats, Orkney and Shetland.

Get around[edit]
56°20′24″N 2°48′0″WMap of St Andrews
Walk. You might use bus 95 to reach Kingsbarns, or 99 for Guardbridge and Leuchars. The main taxi ranks are at the bus station, and on Bell Street which connects Market Street and South Street.
Moffat & Williamson Bus 64 runs hourly to Cupar (Fife),  Falkland Palace and Glenrothes.
Town centre is designed to deter traffic, with a convoluted one-way system and limited expensive central parking. There are free car parks at Petheram Bridge just north of the bus station, Murray Place off North St, and Woodburn Place just south of the harbour. They're often referred to as "Park & Ride" but the town is too small for that, just walk in.

56.3417-2.794211 St Salvator's Quad, North Street KY16 9AL. Daily. This is the quadrangle of St Salvator's College and several academic departments are based here, though the university has abandoned the collegiate system for all but ceremonial purposes. Originally medieval, it became tumbledown and was rebuilt in Jacobean style in the 19th century. Its notable buildings are the college chapel, tower and tenement, and the Hebdomodar's building; St Salvator's Hall just east is a student residence built in the 1930s. The chapel, dating from 1450, conducts university services every Sunday, with staff and students in traditional garb. (The red gowns are for all undergrads except St Mary's; the slant at which they're worn denotes the student's year and subject.) After chapel, the students parade to the end of the pier to commemorate John Honey, who in 1800 hastened from the chapel to rescue five sailors from the stricken ship Janet. On North Street just outside the quad, the letters PH are set in the cobbles. Here Patrick Hamilton was burned at the stake in 1528 for his Lutheran heresies, such as preaching that Gospel and Law are separate things. It's said to be bad luck to walk on the letters, and that students who do so will flunk - this curse may be expunged by bathing in the sea at dawn on 1st May (the May Dip).   (updated Mar 2020)
56.33869-2.794272 St Mary's Quad, South Street KY16 9JP. Daily. St Mary's College has always been the theology school or Faculty of Divinity, and these undergrads wear black gowns, befitting their sober future as church ministers. Enter through the black iron gates inscribed "In Principio Erat Verbum:" the opening of John's Gospel, "In the beginning was the Word". Left of the gate is Lower Parliament Hall, where the Scottish Parliament relocated from plague-stricken Edinburgh 1645-6; it's now the university Debating Hall. The building on the left of the quad, formerly the library, is now the School of Psychology. The tree on the right side was planted by Mary Queen of Scots; she didn't plant the large oak tree in the centre. Far side of the quad is a ruined gateway, now being restored, into the 20th-century Bute Medical School.   (updated Mar 2020)

56.342-2.791068 St Andrews Castle, The Scores KY16 9AR, ☏ +44 1334 477196. Daily Apr-Sep: 9:30AM-5:30PM, Oct-Mar: 10AM-4PM. There's been a bishop's palace here since the 12th century, which successive armies wrecked; the present building is from 1400. It hosted royalty and also prisoners; in 1478 the unlucky Archbishop Patrick Graham was deemed insane and incarcerated in his own "palace". In 1546 during the Reformation, a Protestant preacher was burnt at the stake here, so his followers got in pretending to be building workers, lynched the cardinal, and barricaded themselves in. In the ensuing siege, a sapper-mine and counter-mine were dug through the underlying solid rock, which you can explore. The castle fell into disuse and in 1656 the burgh council took much of its material to re-build the pier. So it's now a picturesque shell in a great scenic location. Adult £9, child £5.40, conc £7.20; combi with cathedral £12 / £7.20 / £9.60.   (updated Mar 2020)

Built from 1158 to 1318, it was the principal Catholic church in Scotland before the Reformation, then was ransacked and fell derelict. Like the castle much of its masonry was removed in the 17th century for other buildings. St Rule's adjacent was an earlier church: the tower still stands and can be climbed. Another, St Mary on the Rock, was the collegiate church of the Culdees, who enjoyed a century-long feud with the Augustinians - little of this church remains. Adult £6, child £3.60, conc £4.80; combi with castle £12 / £7.20 / £9.60.   (updated Mar 2020)
56.33942-2.78410 Pier and Harbour are small, at the outlet of the Kinness Burn, and the harbour is dry at low tide. It was an important fishing harbour but when the railway bypassed town, trade shifted to Dundee and the Forth ports. It's an agreeable place to stroll, with views from the end of the pier north across the Tay to the hills of Angus. On Sundays after chapel, university staff and students walk to the pier in their traditional academic dress.
Beaches are great for strolling, but only the hardiest souls will plunge into the cold waters of the North Sea. You'll want a wet suit for water sports.
56.347-2.80611 West Sands is the two mile sandy beach that flanks the R&A golf courses, with an access lane. There are various zones to segregate activities such as sand yachts and family paddling. It ends in sand dunes at Out Head by the outflow of the River Eden: the dunes may be closed off to protect bird life and other features. Dogs restricted May-Sept.
56.34188-2.7890212 Castle Sands is a small sandy beach just below the castle. You need high tide to access the sea, at other times there's a long furrowed line of rocks, fine for rock-pooling but a barrier to paddling. This beach is the site of the annual May Dip, where students jump into the sea at daybreak on 1st May as part of a hoary university tradition.
56.336-2.77913 East Sands is a half-mile sandy beach east of the harbour. Dogs welcome.
Further away are sandy beaches at Kingsbarns five miles southeast, and at Tentsmuir Forest north of the River Eden.
Leuchars is the village where you change between train and bus: its main attraction is the well-preserved 12th-century St Athernase Church. The RAF base at Leuchars closed in 2015 and is now an army base and diversionary airfield; its fighter jets transferred to RAF Lossiemouth on the Moray coast.

St Andrews Tours offer various guided tours of town, year-round.
St Andrews EuroWalk - Online self-guided tour of the town visiting key points of interest and exploring their historic and contemporary links with our European neighbours.
Golf originated in Scotland some time in the Middle Ages, and by 1457 it was common enough to be furiously prohibited by law, along with football. But by 1503 even the king was playing, and buying golf clubs and balls. At first golf was played on natural rugged terrain such as "links" ie sandy grass along the coast. The first maintained course was here in St Andrews, playing outward for 11 holes then homeward for a 22-hole course. Some holes were considered too short, so in 1764 these were combined to create a 9+9 course. And since St Andrews codified the rules of the game, the 18-hole course became standard.
The Royal and Ancient Golf Club is the high temple of the game, promulgating its rule book, and hosting major tournaments. The good news is, it's relatively simple although expensive to get a game here, if you come off-season. You're unlikely to get onto the hallowed turf of the Old Course - you need to be taking part in a tournament, or have immense influence, or get lucky in the ballot. Or you might be a spectator for a tournament, or simply stroll by to watch celebs playing and practising. Mind your head! - "celeb" doesn't always mean skilful. Your best chance of a game at R&A is on their six other courses: Castle, New, Jubilee, Eden, Strathtyrum and Balgove (which is 9-hole with no advance booking).
King James IV took up golf
Duke's Golf Course is at Craigtoun, 3 miles southwest of town. It's run by the Old Course Hotel, see "Sleep", and is heathland not links. They're evasive about who the Duke was, but presumably a scoundrel if he couldn't get in at the R&A.
