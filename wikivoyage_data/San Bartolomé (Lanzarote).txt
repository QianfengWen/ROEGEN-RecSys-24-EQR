San Bartolomé (Saint Bartholomew) is a town and municipality on Lanzarote in the Canary Islands. In 2022 the municipality had a population of 18,989, but this includes Playa Honda beach resort and Arrecife Airport, both effectively part of the capital Arrecife. San Bartolomé itself is small. 
This page also describes sights in Tinajo municipality just north. The big attraction there is the northern portion of Timanfaya National Park, but it's convenient to describe that along with its southern portion accessed from Yaiza. 


Understand[edit]
This area was shaken by the eruptions of the 1730s but the ash and lava moved west, so the local soil was not ruined, and farmers could continue to grow vines and potatoes on older volcanic terrain. But the soil was thin and vulnerable to over-use, storms towards the end of that century washed much of it away, and the village was forced to shift west to its present location. It grew into a municipality stretching to the south coast, while north is the municipality of Tinajo, and west are the volcanic badlands unsuitable for agriculture.

Iglesia de San Bartolomé the principal church is 18th century, on Plaza León y Castillo 200 m west of the bus stop. St Bartholomew was one of the Twelve Apostles. He may have travelled to India, but more likely to the Caucasus regions of Armenia and Azerbaijan, where according to the hagiographers in 70 AD he was drowned then crucified upside down then skinned alive then beheaded. This is not the reason he gives his name to several hospitals.
