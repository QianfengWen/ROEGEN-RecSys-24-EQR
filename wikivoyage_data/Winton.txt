Winton is a town in Outback Queensland between Longreach and Mount Isa


Understand[edit]
Winton is a very small outback town in Central Queensland that, despite its small size on the map these days, has a rich history. Alongside Longreach the town has a strong link with Qantas, the Australian national carrier. Despite the common association of Qantas with Longreach, the then Queensland and Northern Territory Ariel Services company was actually first headquartered in Winton.
The legendary Australian folk-song Waltzing Matilda, once National Anthem contender and now generally accepted unofficial national anthem, was written by A. B. 'Banjo' Paterson in 1895, at the nearby Dagworth sheep and cattle station, and first performed at the Gregory Hotel in town later that year. This legend inspired what has been said to be the only museum in the world dedicated to a song: the Waltzing Matilda Centre and Qantilda Museum, one of the town's key attractions. Sadly, the Waltzing Matilda Centre aspect of this museum complex was destroyed by fire in 2015.
Winton is increasingly known as a "palaeontological paradise" for the rich fossil record that lies in the earth in the surrounding area. The Australian Age of Dinosaurs Museum, on the eastern side of town, and the Lake Quarry Dinosaur Stampede Trackways, 110 km southwest of the town, connect visitors to this rich history. The museum attracts students on practical experience and other interested volunteers to the town for extended periods to assist with the processing of finds from regular digs.
As Winton is an outback destination, the climate is particularly harsh in the summer months, with temperatures often reaching 40º C / 100º F during the day. Visitor season runs from April to October. Outside of visitor season, expect tours and experiences offerings to be reduced.

The Combo Waterhole is 132km northwest of Winton off the Landsborough Highway, and is believed by some to be the setting for the story of Waltzing Matilda, or at least part of the inspiration. 'Banjo' Paterson visited the site in 1895 while staying at Dagworth Station and later wrote the words to a song that captured the spirit of Australia – ‘Waltzing Matilda’. Once part of Dagworth Station, the series of waterholes now make up the 49ha Conservation Park.
Bladensburg National Park starts 7km south of Winton.  Access is via dirt roads.
Longreach is a couple of hours drive southeast and Cloncurry is about 3 hours drive northwest.
