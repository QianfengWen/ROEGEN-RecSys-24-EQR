The train depot in downtown Durango from where you can catch the Durango-Silverton train
Durango is a town in the southwestern part of the Rocky Mountains state of Colorado.


Understand[edit]
Durango is perhaps most famous for the historic narrow gauge railroad that connects Durango with Silverton. It is the largest town in southwest Colorado with a population of about 16,000. The people in Durango are very friendly and down to earth. Durango is a short drive from the Four Corners, where New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Colorado meet. The surrounding landscape of Durango is diverse, spanning from red sandstone bluffs of the Animas River Valley to jagged peaks of the San Juan Mountains, a few of which rise to elevations over 14,000 feet. Durango is 6,512 feet above sea level.

History[edit]
Durango has a long, rich history. The city was founded in 1880 by the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad. By July 1882, tracks to Silverton were completed and the train began transporting both freight and passengers. The laborers were paid an average of $2.25/day. The Durango-Silverton Railroad was built to haul silver and gold ore, but passengers soon started to really appreciate the view. The Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad continues to be a favorite attraction on a Colorado sightseeing vacation.
Many of the buildings in historic downtown Durango were constructed with stone and brick due to a city ordinance enacted after a fire in 1889, which damaged several blocks along Main Avenue. The Diamond Belle Saloon at the Strater Hotel opened its doors in 1957, and it has a bullet hole in the far east drawer behind the bar.
Several well-known movies have been made in Durango, including Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, City Slickers, Cliffhanger, National Lampoon’s Vacation, Night Passage, Ticket to Tomahawk, Around the World in Eighty Days, How the West Was Won, and Tracker.
