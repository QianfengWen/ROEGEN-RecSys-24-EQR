Ghazanchetsots Cathedral
Shusha or Shushi is a city in Azerbaijan. This fortified city has long been a cultural center in Karabakh.


Understand[edit]
Shusha was an Azeri-majority city, albeit with a significant Armenian minority, before the 1990s when all of its original Azeri population was expelled or killed following the First Nagorno-Karabakh war. After the war, the city was under the ethnic Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh Republic and was partly rehabilitated. Following the city's recapture by Azerbaijan during the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War in 2020, large scale reconstruction work is ongoing to revive the destroyed city as the capital of Azerbaijani art, poetry, and music as it once was.

Get in[edit]
As of 2021, it is no longer possible to reach Shusha from Armenia or Stepanakert.
As of Aug 2022, visits from the rest of Azerbaijan are reportedly possible only as part of a group with a permit.

Govhar Agha Mosque


Qarqar Canyon under Shusha
39.7587446.746991 Ghazanchetsots Cathedral. Armenian cathedral consisting of a church and a bell tower. It was built in the second half of the 19th century, and used to be the largest Armenian church. It was in use till the Shusha massacre in 1920, and then was used as a barn. It was restored in 1998. Interior decoration is quite modest, which is traditional for Armenian churches. (updated Feb 2015)
39.760246.75242 Govhar Agha Mosque. Construction of the mosque was started in 1768 by Ibrahim Khan and then was frozen for years until Gevhar-aga, the successor of Ibrahim Khan, completed it. The inner space of the mosque is not much different from other places of worship in Karabakh of that period. There is a two-story gallery, separated by high stone pillars, as well as traditional domed ceilings. The mosque was heavily damaged in 1992, but in 2007 and 2011 it was completely reconstructed. You can enjoy the building from outside, but it doesn't function as a mosque anymore. (updated Feb 2015)
39.76171746.7537873 Lower Mosque (around the corner of Govheraga Mosque). Some ruins that still have their towers partly intact and which allow for a great view of the surrounding area. However, they are ruins, so be cautious. (updated Aug 2019)

39.75541746.7583338 Vagif Mausoleum (Vaqif türbəsi). An impressive, 1970s (Soviet)-built monument to Molla Panah Vagif, an 18th-century poet and statesman of the Karabakh Khanate. It was seriously derelict during the almost three decades of Armenian rule, but was restored in 2021, after the Azerbaijani retook the city.   (updated Sep 2022)
39.75264946.7581489 Jidir Plain (Cıdır düzü) (just over Vagif Mausoleum). A plateau where horse races, wrestling tournaments, and Novruz (Persian New Year) celebrations were held during the days of the Karabakh Khanate. This is a famous lookout offering a spectacular view of the scenic, craggy Dashalty (Qarqar) gorge 200 m below, as well as glimpses of the Karabakh capital Stepanakert, Xankəndi ("khan's city") to the Azerbaijanis — it's less than 10 km distant from here as the crow flies, but getting there since the 2020 war entails embarking on a roundabout trip of about a thousand kilometres crossing at least three borders and an unspecified number of checkpoints.
