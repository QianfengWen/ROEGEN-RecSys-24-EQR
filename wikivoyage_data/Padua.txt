On foot[edit]
Discovering the city on foot is very easy. The historic center is not very big, so you can go around in the narrow streets.

By bicycle[edit]
Padua, luckily, is quite a flat city. Apart from the few roman bridges and some -not very steep- streets, you will not find any hills to hike! Especially in the city center, most of the streets are narrow and quiet and the terrain is sometimes made of pavé or cobblestones.  In some areas, the cobbling is such that it would be unsuitable for standard road bicycles. Outside the narrow streets, a bike lane is sometimes available.
In the near Riviera del Brenta you can hire bikes at local shops, with free delivery services at your hotel, for make excursions in Padova region.

By tram[edit]
APS Mobilità[dead link] (ex-ACAP, call center: +39 049 20111) runs the only tramway line of the city, based on the rubber-tired TransLohr vehicle.
The line SIR1, entered service with passengers on March, 24th 2007.
The route is Stazione F.S. (Piazzale Stazione) - Trieste - Eremitani - Ponti Romani - Tito Livio - Santo - Prato della Valle - Cavalletto DX - Diaz - Santa Croce - Cavallotti - Bassanello - Sacchetti/Assunta - Cuoco - Guizza - Capolinea Sud.
This line is very useful for tourists because it stops near various monuments, museums and local landmarks like Santo Basilica, Eremitani Civic Museums, Cappella degli Scrovegni, Prato della Valle, Santa Giustina Basilica, Botanic Garden, central squares. (The stops for each of these are in bold above.)
The line is northbound-southbound, travel time 22 minutes from terminus to terminus. The tram runs every 8 minutes during weekdays daytime, 10 at early evening, 30 at late evening, every 20–15 minutes on Sundays from 7.07 till 0.20.

By bus[edit]
APS Mobilità[dead link] (ex-ACAP, call center: +39 049 20111) runs a network of local transport that covers the main areas of the city as well as some suburbs.

lines with numbers are urban and sub-urban, as well as Minibus (Diretto Piazze-Diretto Duomo-Circolare Antenore) and LIS
lines with letters A-M-T-AM-AT are connecting Padova to the Abano Terme and Montegrotto Terme Spa area.
Many lines run on the two main axes in the centre: North-South and east–west. Many of them terminate at the train station,  which is also the main node of the bus network. Apart from the tramway, the most frequent are lines 10 and 3.


By car[edit]
Getting around by car in the city center can be very difficult. During peak hours traffic jams are frequent. And if you want to see the city center, apart from the narrow streets and pedestrian zones, a traffic limited zone has been established from 8AM till 8PM and cameras on several entrance points control the access: those who are not authorized will get a fine. It is useful to park your car in one of several parking lots or on the park areas on the streets, then take a bus or walk from there. More info can be found (in Italian) on  APSParcheggi website.

The Padua Card allows you to visit most churches and all museums as well as to use the public transport for €16.

Landmarks[edit]
Saint Anthony basilica
45.40136411.8800691 Saint Anthony's cathedral (Basilica di Sant'Antonio), Piazza del Santo (limited traffic area, parking in Prato della Valle+free shuttle bus line n° 3-8-11-12-13-16-18-22-32-43-Minibus Piazze-A-M-T and tramway line 1 stop "Basilica del Santo"-"Santa Giustina"-"Prato della Valle"), ☏ +39 0498789722, infobasilica@santantonio.org. Every day, 6.20 - 19.00 (DST 19.45). Saint Anthony's Basilica is the best-known tourist site in Padova - millions of pilgrims visit every year. Built immediately after "The Saint's" death in the 1200s, it houses his tomb and notable relics. The statues and crucifix on the main altar are by Donatello, as is the statue of horse and rider in the square in front of the church (called "Gattamelata" - "the honeyed cat"). Free entrance.   
45.401111.88032 Oratorio de San Giorgio. A beautiful, frescoed, and generally empty hall on the south side of the piazza next to the Basilica di Sant'Antonio. The paintings were done by two of Giotto's students, and though they are not as magnificent as those in the Capella degli Scrovegni, you can sit down and gaze at them undisturbed for as long as you like. Admission €2.50.   
45.41166711.8794443 Scrovegni Chapel (Cappella degli Scrovegni), Corso Garibaldi (parking near bus station, bus lines n° 3-8-9-10- (stop "Corso Garibaldi") 7-9-4-15 (stop "Piazzale Boschetti")), ☏ +39 0492010020. Every day, 9.00-19.00. The Chapel is in the north of the city center, not far from the bus and train stations. The walls and ceilings are covered in frescos by Giotto, completed in 1303-1305. The chapel has been well preserved and the art is very impressive. Some of the techniques used were well ahead of their time. A must-see for art and art history fans. €14 full price, €5 student price (including Eremitani Civic Museum and Contemporary Art Museum).   
Notice: Reserve your ticket/timeslot in advance or go very early. In the off-season, the wait from purchase to first available timeslot is about 4 hours unless you arrive before the hordes; in summer it's probably even longer. When you are admitted, you will be held for 15 minutes in a antechamber to lower body humidity which would otherwise damage the frescoes. During this time, you'll see a documentary presenting the chapel and its history. Then you will be allowed 15 minutes to see the frescoes before being shepherded out.
At 90.000 square meters, Prato della Valle is the biggest square in Italy, and probably one of the most beautiful in the world. Historically a Roman theater and later a fairground, it was redone in 1775 to the present layout: a large central grassy area, surrounded by a statue-lined canal, then a broad expanse of flagstones before a couple lanes of traffic are allowed to trickle around it in the distance. Saturdays the square hosts a giant market. Other large events occur frequently (concerts, fairs, etc.). The area around the canal is well-used by joggers, bikers, and rollerbladers. The square is also a great place to sit in the evening, relaxing and watching the world go by. The statues appear to have been placed precisely to be good backrests.
Prato della Valle and Saint Giustina Basilica
Santa Giustina Basilica is along one side of Prato della Valle. When you visit, don't miss the Martyr's Hallway off of the right-front corner of the basilica.
Roman ruins, including an Arena. The Arena is smaller and less impressive than those in Verona or Rome, but well-located in a lovely and well-maintained park. About three quarters of the Arena walls remain; the rest were removed to make way for the Scrovegni Chapel and Scrovegni Palace (the latter now long gone). In summertime, open-air movies are shown in the Arena.
45.41056611.8797884 [dead link] Chiesa Eremitani (near Scrovegni's Chapel). The church with an unusual wooden ceiling was badly damaged in WWII, and much of its artwork was destroyed, but what remains is beautiful.   
The Duomo, or cathedral, is smaller than the two basilicas but not by much - don't be misled by the relatively small façade on Piazza del Duomo. Michaelangelo was involved in the cathedral's design. Inside, there are some surprisingly modern touches among the statues and artwork. The duomo is mostly known for its baptistry which is filled with frescoes in late medieval style.
Note: The cathedral closes during lunch, with no visible hours posted beside the doors. If they're closed, try again later.
Next door to the cathedral is the Baptistry, with impressive frescos by Giusto de Menabuoi.
45.40197211.8684155 Astronomic Observatory (La Specola), 5, Vicolo dell'Osservatorio (bus n° 12 or 18, stop "Via P. Paoli", turn to via S. Alberto Magno to reach the Specola tower), ☏ +39 0498759840, museo.laspecola@pd.astro.it. Sa-Su 11.00-16.00 (18.00 May-Oct). Although the observatory was built after Galileo's time in Padua, you'll learn a lot about his significance for the research in Padua. You reach the top of the tower after a lecture of about one hour and can enjoy the view. Tickets at the Oratorio S. Michele, Piazzetta S. Michele, 1: 50 meters from the Specola, through the arcade on the right before the little bridge.   
45.40722211.8752786 Palazzo della Ragione. The large building located between Piazza della Frutta and Piazza delle Erbe. Its ground floor hosts small market shops. The upper floor is a single large hall housing artwork and occasional exhibitions.   
 Jewish Ghetto (between Piazza della Frutta, the Duomo, and via Roma). Characterized by narrow streets and many small art galleries and bars where to enjoy a "spritz". 
45.4068411.877547 Palazzo del Bo', The main university building. Padua's university is the second oldest in Italy (founded 1222). Galileo taught at the university in the late 1500s/early 1600s.   
The entrance to the botanic garden
45.39888911.8805568 Botanic Garden (Orto botanico di Padova). The world's oldest still operating botanic garden, operated by the University of Padua, and on the UNESCO World Heritage list since 1997. It isn't a large garden, but subtly laid out to swallow groups of people and give the impression of solitude. Do not miss the carnivorous plants, or the wooded hill at the southeast corner mounted by a double helix pair of paths. Admission ranges from free (for some university students) to €1 (for other university students) to €4-5 for everyone else.   
Most of the City walls of Padua have been made into the borders of people's back yards, but you can still roughly follow their route. At the northern gates leading towards the train station is a terraced garden leading up to the old water tower.
If you have extra time before your bus or train, visit Tempio Antonio della Pace, the large brick church a few minutes' walk away. The interior is light and airy - very appropriate for a place dedicated to Peace - and the walls are a subtle but moving memorial to the 5401 WWI soldiers and 989 civilian victims of WWII who are buried there.
In 2021, Padua got another entry on the UNESCO World Heritage List; named Padua's fourteenth-century fresco cycles. It's made up of the Scrovegni Chapel Church of the Eremitani, the Palazzo de la Ragione Chapel of the Cararesi Palace Cathedral Baptistery, the Basilica and Monastery of St. Anthony Oratory of St. George and the Oratory of St. Michael, or more specifically, the beautiful frescoes these building house.
Museums[edit]
 [dead link] Belzoni Museo-Laboratorio di Antichi Strumenti Scientifici, Via Speroni Sperone, 39/41, ☏ +37 49 655157, belzoni@provincia.padova.it. school hours (9:30-12:30 weekdays) and certain Saturdays. This is a very peculiar museum, a collection of old scientific instruments assembled by Professor Pietro Paolo Gallo, a teacher of physics at a technical high school, which also houses the museum in a couple of its rooms. No one speaks anything but Italian, and they are not prepared for anything more than a few enthusiasts. Tell the secretary at the school's entrance that you would like to see the scientific instruments, and she will attempt to find Professor Gallo for you. Free admission, but Professor Gallo has a few instruments he cannot identify, and you may be interrogated if you have any knowledge of what they might be. 
45.4109611.880019 Eremitani Civic Museum (Museo Civico Agli Eremitani), Piazza Eremitani 8. The museum is divided into an archeological section and a picture gallery, which has a very important collection with Tizian, Tintoretto, Giotto and Bellini among other important painters.   
Do[edit]
A pleasant local tradition is the spritz or aperitif in one of the central piazzas (Piazza delle Erbe, Piazza della Frutta or Piazza dei Signori), starting between 7 and 8 in the evening.  There are lots of students and young people, which makes for a very pleasant atmosphere.
Many young folk, particularly students, converge on the Prato della Valle to eat their lunch, either on the central grass, or leaning against the statues that line the water.  In fine weather you will generally find people ensconced against these statues for the afternoon.  It is one of the nicest places to rest, write, or watch the world go by in Padova.
Rugby Union: Petraca Rugby play in Serie A Elite, the top domestic tier. Their home ground Stadio Plebiscito (capacity 9000) is in the sports complex 4 km northeast of town centre; the national team also sometimes play here.
Sherwood Festival is between mid-June and mid-July in the outside garden of the main soccer stadium of Padua. It hosts Italian and international bands every weekend. It is easy to reach from the city center by bike in 20 minutes.
Learn[edit]
The Rolling Pin Cooking School - hands-on cooking classes in the center of Padua, about the art of Italian Gastronomy and Cooking.

Buy[edit]
Padua has two major markets.  The older, much larger market fills the Piazza delle Erbe and Piazza della Frutta, lying to the north and south of a grand, arcaded stone building, the Palazzo della Ragione.  The open passages of the Palazzo house the butchers, cheese vendors, fishmongers, and fresh pasta shops.  The Piazza delle Erbe to the south is mostly fruits and vegetables; the Piazza dei Frutti to the north is about half fruits and vegetables and half bric-à-brac and clothing.  These markets are open all day every weekday plus Saturday.
On Saturdays, the Prato della Valle is filled with a giant market selling clothing, household goods, plants, and antiques.  A small fruit and vegetable market has opened weekday mornings as well, though it is incomparably smaller than the offerings at the Palazzo della Ragione.
The old stone streets and piazzas to the southeast of the Piazza delle Erbe are pedestrianized and form the shopping center of the town.

Eat[edit]
 Pizzeria Al Duomo, Via S.G. Barbarigo 18. Great-tasting pizzas that are enormous even by Italian standards. Quality is high, prices are low (pizza and wine €10-15), and the atmosphere is great. For something different, try one of their "green" pizzas.

They have the usual range of pastas, meat/fish dishes, pizzas, etc. If you've overdosed on Italian food and want something lighter, try one of their salads.

 Cucina Chef Chadi, Via S. Francesco 214 (right behind the basilica: keep the building to your right and walk until the corner at the end of the street.). closed 2-4.30PM and after 8PM.

Good service and convenient prices (lunch menu €6-15).

Almost everything is made in-house, including the bread and desserts. Most of the customers are locals. Marco speaks very good English and translates the menu patiently. $$.

Bring your Italian phrasebook and study up - a little Italian goes a long way in Padua, especially in the low season.
The Padova Card offers free entrance to several key attractions, discounts at others, free parking, and free travel on buses.  It's valid for 48 hours from the time you buy it.  At €14, it's worth having even if you only use it for the Scrovegni Chapel and one or two other sites or bus rides.
There are many students that can speak in English in Padua and many foreign students too, so the best way to find particular hints or suggestions is to go to one of the 3 piazzas around the Palazzo della Ragione during "aperitivo" time (19-23 hrs) and ask people there! They are usually really friendly and helpful.
Go next[edit]
The Colli Euganei are low hills to the west of town with some nice trails to hike on, and other equally nice restaurants to eat at after a day of walking.
Abano Terme is a small resort town especially popular with elderly German tourists based on the thermal spas in the area.
Arqua Petrarca is a beautifully preserved medieval town nestled in the hills, which is probably best known for being the final resting place of the Italian poet Francesco Petrarca (Petrarch).
Venice is not far at all.  If you're in Padua, chances are you've already been to Venice or are on your way there.  But if not, it's definitely worth a day trip (or two!).
Villa di Teolo is a town on the Colli Euganei.
