High Prairie is a town of about 2,600 people (2016) in the Peace River Country region of Alberta.


Understand[edit]
High Prairie developed when the railway from Edmonton to the Peace Country was chosen to go through the town as opposed to Grouard, a neighbouring village on the northwestern shore of Lesser Slave Lake. Today, High Prairie's main industries include agriculture, forestry, and oil and gas. 
Due to its proximity to the western shores of Lesser Slave Lake, High Prairie has a thriving tourism industry, particularly in the warmer summer months. There are many attractions at the lake, including events such as the Golden Walleye Classic. Winagami Lake Provincial Park, approximately 33 km to the north of High Prairie, and Kimiwan Lake, approximately 49 km to the northwest, are attractions for bird-watching enthusiasts. Winagami Lake and Kimiwan Lake are within the general area where three major migration paths meet – the Central Flyway, the Mississippi Flyway, and the Pacific Flyway.
