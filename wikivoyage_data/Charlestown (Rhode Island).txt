Get around[edit]
Many attractions in Charlestown are spread out, so travel by car is usually the best option. If you are renting a house in one of the many beach suburbs, then beach access is almost always easier by foot. Bicycle travel is also the method of transport favored by many locals, and offers a great experience to view the flora and fauna. There are no real means of obtaining (renting, buying, etc.) a bicycle in town, so it is recommended that any visitors bring their own for the best method of transport to a beach.
Water Travel is also very popular.  Renting a canoe, or other form of boat is a good way to see the true beauty of Rhode Island.  These are easily rentable at many bait and tackle places listed below.
