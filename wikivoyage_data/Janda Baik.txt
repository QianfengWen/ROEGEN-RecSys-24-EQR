The climate here serves in between 23-28°C during the day and below 22°C in the evenings.  A simple Malay kampong or village with a population of approximately 1000 people. Janda Baik is set amidst a small valley bounded by thick rainforest laced together with picturesque streams and cool rushing brooks of waterfallswith. 
"Janda Baik" means "the good widow" in Malay. As the story is told by local folks, in the old days a path that connects Selangor and Pahang beats its way through the village. It was said that a mercenary, who was returning after fighting in a civil war in Selangor stopped at the village for a rest and to nurse some wounds he had sustained in battle. Upon seeing this ragtag team in the vicinity, a kindly widow immediately offered help and tended to the mercenary's wounds. As a mark of respect for this kind widow, the mercenary would always advise his men to call on the woman whenever they were in the vicinity.
Friends of Janda Baik (FOJB) was set up to promote the awareness and importance of preserving and protecting the its ecological system and  beautiful nature of Janda Baik and its surrounding hills and streams, while keeping and sustaining the original existing concept of Malay 'kampung (village)' environment and development.
Janda Baik had attracted an increasing number of visitors due to its strategic location for weekend escapism. It attracted investors to come here and build up semi-resort type accommodations, commercial facilities and training camps. However, the need for controlled development has to be taken into placed in order not to destroy the tranquility of real village character.
The other challenge faced by Janda Baik citizens is the rape of its surrounding hill, due to illegal hill farming and de-forestration activities. These have resulted in a rise in temperature, pollution of rivers and streams, erosion and landslip, and decreasing stream water level.
Nevertheless, Janda Baik has a wide variety of semi-type resorts that offer motivational courses, obstacle challenges, flying fox and abseiling. Camping grounds are available. Backpackers' chalets, however, are still very limited.
For those who wish to pursue rainforest trekking and 4-wheel drive trails, there is a local-run organisation facilitating such endeavors.

Get around[edit]
See[edit]
Janda Baik is a good place to seek rest and recreation because of its proximity to Kuala Lumpur. The following are the interesting places that one should explore and enjoy these unique experience.

 Pulau Santap. What happens when two rivers meet? A kind of chemistry takes place. The meeting of the Bunus and Ceringging rivers is the birthplace of Janda Baik. In the early days, there was a small islet where Sultan Abu Bakar of Pahang took his meals. Santap is the language of the royal courts which means the Sultan is having his meal. The place was aptly named Pulau Santap. The islet is no more to be seen but the place still entices visitors to have a picnic or take a dip in its shallow water. 
 Ulu Tampit Waterfall. Ulu Tampit waterfall is in Latto Charok. It is recommended to visit the waterfall if you are visiting Janda Baik. Many would find that Ulu Tampit waterfall is the most enjoyable one! There are seven floors of waterfall and 4th, 5th and 7th floor, are the most common floors people go to visit. It only takes about 45 minutes of light trekking and hiking through the jungle to get to the top floor. During raining season it is not advisable to go there because first of all the water is not clear, secondly many ‘pacat’ or leeches and lastly you may fall down during the hiking because of slippery.; At the 5th floor of the waterfall, the panoramic view is so beautiful while at 7th floor is the best to dip into the water! The water is so cold and so deep, yet you will not be carried away by the current. It is one of the safest waterfalls to plunge into the water. Kids enjoy it the most at the 5th floor.; How to get there? Unfortunately, visiting the waterfall will only be allowed if you are accompanied by an experienced guide. The guide is available with an advance booking. Kindly call 019 6152 150 for further assistance.; For those who are looking for something tougher, it is recommended to go hiking to Gunung Nuang through Janda Baik. It takes 10 hours of trekking to go up and down. Good luck! 
 Mount Nuang. Gunung Nuang or Mount Nuang (1493m) is the highest in the state of Selangor, which is in Hulu Langat. Gunung Nuang is among the famous mountain for local and foreign trekkers and it is also a "training centre" for those who plan to challenge the Mount Tahan in Pahang and Mount Kinabalu in Sabah. Trekking up Gunung Nuang in Hulu Langat offers intrepid trekkers endless opportunities to observe exotic and rare tropical flora and fauna. Striding through the forests of this mountain, the lush vegetation displays Malaysia's primeval and largely unexplored rainforests. The hilly terrain makes trekking up to the peak of Gunung Nuang more arduous. The vibrant ecosystem that stretches throughout the trek will expose visitors to nature at its most natural form. It is estimated at about 11 hours of journey from the main entrance. Along the journey, there are 2 campsites, where you can have a rest and refresh your energy before continuing another hard trek to the summit.
