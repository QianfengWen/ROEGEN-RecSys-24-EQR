Carp
History[edit]
By 1866, Carp was a post village with a population of 200 of the Township of Huntley on the Carp river, 32 km (20 mi) from Ottawa. The village contained three stores, workshops, three hotels, and a town hall. 
The village takes its name from the Carp River which runs through the village. The main street used to be a section of the Trans-Canada Highway and carried much of the traffic coming from the west into Ottawa. However the village has been bypassed with the development of the Highway 417.
With the amalgamation of municipal governments in the region in 2001, Carp is now governed as part of the new city of Ottawa.

Built at the height of the Cold War (1959-1961) as the Central Emergency Government Headquarters, this giant four-story underground bunker reinforced to stand a 5-megaton nuclear blast was designed as the site where Canada's leadership could ride out a nuclear holocaust. The name is a play on the name of the Prime Minister at the time, John Diefenbaker. Decommissioned in 1994, the site is now run by a dedicated group of volunteers working to preserve and restore it to its glory days in that paranoid era, complete with period maps showing what parts of Canada (and the US) would have faced nuclear doom in the event of World War III.
