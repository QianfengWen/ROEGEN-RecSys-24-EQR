Sherbrooke is the primary economic, political, cultural and institutional centre of Estrie. There are eight institutions educating 40,000 students and employing 11,000 people.  The proportion of university students is 10.32 students per 100 inhabitants, the highest concentration of students in Quebec.
Since the 19th century, Sherbrooke has been a manufacturing centre, but this sector has declined significantly. The service sector occupies a prominent place in the economy of the city, as well as a growing knowledge-based economy.
The Sherbrooke region is surrounded by mountains, rivers and lakes. There are several ski hills nearby and various tourist attractions in regional flavour. Mont-Bellevue Park, a large park in the city, is used for downhill skiing.

History[edit]
City Hall
The First Nations (Indigenous) people were the first settlers in the region, between 8,000 and 3,000 years ago. Traces of seasonal camps, characterized by arrowheads, scrapers, and other similar tools have been found. Ceramic objects dating from the Woodland period (3000 to 500 years ago) were also found, indicating that the region continued to be occupied by nomadic people during this period.
Upon the arrival of Samuel de Champlain in Quebec in 1608, this region was under the control of the Mohawks. France created an alliance through its missionaries with the Abenaki in Maine and Vermont. The French were driven to the valley of the St. Lawrence River near Trois-Rivières after a Mohawk victory in the war of 1660. The area around present-day Sherbrooke then became a battlefield between the two peoples who had to travel to the region, both of whom sought to obtain control of the territory. During the Seven Years' War between France and Britain, the Abenaki, still allied with the French, travelled along the rivers of the Eastern Townships, frequently near present-day Sherbrooke, during raids against British forts.
After the American Revolution, British Loyalists came from America to the region, and obtained government grants. The first attempts at colonization occurred in 1792 on the banks of the St. Francis River. This settlement was known as Cowan's Clearance. In 1793, loyalist Gilbert Hyatt, a farmer from Schenectady, New York, established his farm not far from the confluence of the Massawippi River and Coaticook River. Over the next two years, 18 families came to live on the site. The Crown acknowledged Hyatt's ownership of the land in 1801. Hyatt built the first dam on the Magog River, in collaboration with another loyalist named Jonathan Ball. Hyatt then built a gristmill in 1802 on the south bank of the river, effectively founding a small village that became known as "Hyatt's Mills". In 1818, the village was renamed after Governor General Sir John Sherbrooke at the time of his retirement and return to Britain.
Manufacturing activities were established that harnessed the Magog River's hydropower. In 1852 a railway line connected the cities of Montreal and Portland. From 1867 to 1892, the manufacturing system was based on hydraulic power. The founding of several important factories near the Gorges helped to attract more and more Francophone workers, coming mainly from the Beauce and elsewhere in Quebec. 
Despite the town's English name and heritage, relatively few traces of the city's English past remain, and the vast majority of the city's residents speak French.

Climate[edit]
Sherbrooke has a humid continental climate, with long, cold, and snowy winters, warm summers, and short but crisp springs and autumns. Highs range from −5.8 °C (21.6 °F) in January to 24.6 °C (76.3 °F) in July. Annual snowfall is large, averaging at 287 centimetres (113 in), sometimes falling in May and October.
