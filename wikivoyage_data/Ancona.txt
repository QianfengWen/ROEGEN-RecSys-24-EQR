Ancona is the capital of the Italian region called the Marches and an important port city on the coast of the Adriatic Sea. 


Understand[edit]
A part of its medieval center was bombed during World War II, but it is still full of ancient monuments and squares. Its medieval cathedral is set on the mountain overlooking at the gulf of Ancona and it is well worth a look. The ancient roman Trajan Arch is on the docks of the port. There is also a loved Memorial of the First World War (built during Fascism) on the waterfront.
The city offers glorious vistas, on a coastline that extends from Pesaro, with mainly flat sandy beaches, to Mount Conero, with its rocky coast. The popular resort of Portonovo is at the Mount's base.
Many ferries link Ancona, and therefore Italy, to Croatia, Greece and Turkey.

Get in[edit]
By boat[edit]
Ferries are cheap and go regularly between various places by the coast.
The instructions for ferry passengers are worth a read. You must first check-in at the ticket office for the international ferries. You must present your ticket or reservation number, the travel documents for each member of your party, and documents for your auto (if you are taking it on the ferry). They will give you instructions for when and where to board. Boarding usually starts 2-3 hours before departure. Take the free bus line 20, which loops to the two ferry docks every 15 to 20 minutes, in the summer season only. Or, walk 15 to 20 minutes.

43.61238413.4998091 Ticket office, Ancona Maritime Terminal (Biglietteria marittima terminal Ancona), Via Enrico Mattei, 6. This building has check-in desks for the various ferry companies, a decent cafe, an overpriced restaurant, and dirty toilets. Check in here first, for international ferries. Then follow instructions to report to your ship. The car park is large, so car drivers may be asked to wait here instead of at the port until the designated time to report for boarding. This location is about 1.4km (1 mile) from the ferry dock. (updated Oct 2019)

Sleep[edit]
Most of the things to see or do are in the city center. Ancona is very hilly, so the surrounding neighborhoods are not always easily connected by bus, so it is better to stay in the center.

Stay safe[edit]
Marche ranked as one of the safest region in Italy. Walking around Ancona even in the night wouldn't be a problem. However, caution has to be exercised moreover in area outside of the centro. Tourist scam is uncommon, as Ancona itself is merely a transit point for the ferry passengers.

Connect[edit]
The city provides limited free wifi in Piazza Roma and in front of Teatro delle Muse. Connect to Free AnkonNet and follow the instruction.

Cope[edit]
Go next[edit]
Go up north to Bologna or Rimini, down the coast to Pescara, or inland to Perugia.
