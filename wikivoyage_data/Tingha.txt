Tingha (population 833 in 2016) is a village in the New England region in New South Wales, Australia.


Understand[edit]
Before non-indigenous settlement the area now known as Tingha was mainly lived upon by people from the Nucoorilma group, which is an associated group of the Murri Aboriginal people. Many of their descendants still live in the surrounding area. The name Tingha is an Aboriginal word for "flat or level (ground)".
Tingha was first settled in 1841 by Sydney Hudson Darby and became a mining town after tin was discovered there in the 1870s. Within 12 months Australia’s first commercial tin mines were operating. Around 5,000 people arrived and about 1,000 of the miners were Chinese.
The village was proclaimed a town in 1885. Initially there were enough readily accessible surface deposits to make a good living without using machinery as Chinese people did. By the early 1900s the mining boom was over and Tingha's population had dwindled to just a few hundred people.
