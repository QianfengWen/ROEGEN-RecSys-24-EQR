Not to be confused with Dubrovnik, historically known as Ragusa.

Ragusa is a city in Sicily, Italy. It's the provincial capital, with some 73,000 inhabitants (as of 2014). Along with 7 other nearby cities, it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Circolo di conversazione

Understand[edit]
Ragusa was part of the Grecian colony of Sicily, and later part of the Roman Byzantine empire. After several raids, in 868 AD it fell to the Muslims, who established the Emirate of Sicily. In 1090 it came under Norman rule. The area was fertile and the city grew up in the area now called Ragusa Ibla. "Hybla" means honey, and was also the name of an ancient deity.
The town was destroyed in the terrible Sicily earthquake of 1693. Most re-building was on higher ground, with Ragusa Superiore being laid out on a grid pattern on a hillside overlooking Ibla. It was constrained to the south by a deep ravine, but eventually this was bridged, and the south bank was also urbanised. Meanwhile, Ibla was largely neglected except as a source of masonry. This meant the medieval street pattern was preserved, while palaces and churches were rebuilt there piecemeal in baroque style. Gradually this area too was re-populated, and the two townships grew into each other, being formally merged in 1927.
So for the visitor, most sights of interest, and the more pleasing ambience in spite of the many tour groups, are found in Ibla. Although it's described as the "lower town", it's actually on a hilltop, with the upper town peering down from a higher hilltop. Exploring Ragusa involves lots and lots of slopes and steps. The church on the saddle of land joining the two hills is dedicated to "the blessed souls in Purgatory": if those souls had limited mobility, it would have sufficed to send them to Ragusa.
The Tourist Information Centre [1][dead link] is close to that church, at Piazza della Repubblica, the foot of Via Aquila Sveva, which is the lane up to Ibla. 36.92631814.737041 
There's another TIC in the piazza below Ragusa Superiore cathedral (St John the Baptist). This is in a 1960s concrete eyesore that defaces the entire square. In early 2018 it was partly fenced off because of falling cladding, so it would be a kindly storm that finished it off.

36.9251614.747822 Portale di San Giorgio, Via Normanni. All that remains of the previous (14th-century) church of San Giorgio is this bricked-up doorway, in Gothic-Catalan style.
