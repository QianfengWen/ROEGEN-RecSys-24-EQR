Ourense (Spanish: Orense) is the capital of the province of Ourense in Galicia. One of the main tourist attractions are the hot springs, as Ourense holds one of the greatest amount of geothermal water in Europe.


Understand[edit]
Roman Bridge
On the banks of the Miño River there are some thermal springs that have been appreciated since ancient times. In Roman times, a city was founded that was called Auriense. During the migration of peoples, the Suevi made it the capital of their empire. Under Moorish rule, the city was almost meaningless. Only in the 19th and 20th centuries did the city regain some of its importance. The connection to the rail and road network made a particular contribution to this.
Its population of 105,000 (2019) accounts for one third of the population of the province and makes it the third largest city of Galicia. One third of the population always speak in Galician, one sixth always speak in Spanish, and the rest use both interchangeably (2018).

On foot[edit]
The Way of St. James from Madrid to Santiago passes through Ourense. La Ruta de la Plata (the silver route) and the Portuguese Way, different routes on the Camino de Santiago, both pass directly through Ourense. La Ruta de la Plata, the longest of all the Camino's routes, begins in Sevilla and moves north through the west of the country. The pilgrims on both routes are important to Ourense's tourism industry, especially in holy years of St. James when traffic on the Camino is especially high.
