Tallangatta is a town near the inflows to Lake Hume in Victoria.


Understand[edit]
Tallangatta is not pronounced like Coolangatta, rather tal-LAN-gadda.  The town itself was rebuilt on the current site, when the old town was flooded by the building of the Hume Dam.  Some remnants of the old town can sometimes be seen in the nearby lake when the water is very low.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The Murray Valley Highway (B400) passes through the town, heading east from Albury-Wodonga.  An interesting variation from the north is get the Wymah ferry across the Murray.  Check running times and water levels before attempting this though, otherwise the deviation is long when you get there.

By bus[edit]
There are daily weekday bus connections between Tallangatta and Albury-Wodonga.

By bike[edit]
The High Country Rail Trail provides a off-road connection from Albury-Wodonga through to Talangatta by bike.  Bikes can be taken on the trains from Sydney and Melbourne to Albury (you must reserve a place on the train).

Get around[edit]
See[edit]
The site of Old Tallangatta.  Most of site of the old town is now covered by water.  Many of the old buildings were demolished or removed prior to being flooded.  Some of the old town in the lake can be seen at very low water levels.  There is a very small settlement by the side of the lack where the old town was.
Do[edit]
 Cycle. The High Country railtrail runs straight through the town and on to Old Tallangatta. In the other direction there is 40km of off-road gravel path cycling next to Lake Hume all the way to Albury-Wodonga. The Sandy Creek bridge (shown as requiring a diversion on many outdated maps) is reopened from October 2012, so a diversion along the busy Murray Valley Highway is no longer required. 
Buy[edit]
Eat[edit]
The town has a few choices of cafes, take-aways, pizza and informal dining restaurants.  It has a nice park in the centre with picnic tables, etc.  The pub bistro is open for dinner 7 nights.
