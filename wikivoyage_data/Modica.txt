Modica is one of the eight "Late Baroque Towns of the Val di Noto" UNESCO world heritage sites. It's in two parts: Modica Alta, higher and older, is perched on top of the southern Ibeli hill. Modica Bassa is built lower down the slopes and in the valley below. Like the other nearby towns, Modica was smashed in the earthquake of 1693, and rebuilt in baroque style. The broad main avenue of the lower town used to be the river, but after a disastrous flood in 1902 it was diverted, and the graceful boulevard was developed.
