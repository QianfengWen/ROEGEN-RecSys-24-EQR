History[edit]

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Buckingham sits on the convergence of the A413 (north-south), A421 and A422 (east-west) roads. The town was by-passed in the early 1980s by creating a new section of the A421 to the south. From the east the A421  connects from the M1 at junction 13, with roads to the north 15 or 15a, with junctions 9,10 and 11 providing access to the M40 in the west. Taxis serve the town and surrounding villages, and can provide connections to Milton Keynes.

By bus[edit]
Buckingham is easily accessible by bus, with direct links to Milton Keynes, Bedford, Bicester and Oxford with the express Stagecoach X5, Aylesbury and Winslow via the 60, and Milton Keynes and Bletchely via the X60.

By train[edit]
Buckingham's train station closed in 1964 and the closest stations are  to the east in Milton Keynes Central for the West Coast Main Line (London Midland, Southern and Virgin services) for fast frequent services from London Euston, Northampton, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow. There are also stations at Wolverton and Bletchley (for local services to London and Northampton), Bicester North (for London Marylebone and Birmingham Snow Hill) and Bicester Town (for Oxford). Winslow railway station is scheduled to re-open in 2019 as part of the new East-West rail project.

By cycle[edit]
Buckingham is on the National Cycle Route 50 that runs from Buckingham to Daventry. A new off-road cycleway connects Buckingham to Winslow via Padbury and Adstock, following the route of the A413. A number of cycle paths run though the town parks.

Get around[edit]
Most of the town is easily accessible by foot, with the majority of the visitor attractions within the town centre and the adjoining historic Prebend End. There are numerous walks that provide gentle perambulations around the town including a town trail (map available from the tourist information centre), the circular walk and the railway walk. A town bus service provides connections between the outlying housing areas, the town centre and Maids Moreton. The town has a number of taxi companies where journeys can be pre-booked by telephone, and some taxis that can be occasionally found in the town centre taxi ranks.
