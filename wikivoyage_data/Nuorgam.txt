The village of Nuorgam.
Nuorgam (Northern Sámi: Njuorggán) is in Finnish Lapland and is situated at the top of Finland and the EU, 510 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle, in the municipality Utsjoki. It is very central while on route to the Arctic Ocean and the Finnmark area in Norway. The close proximity of the Norwegian border crossing gives the village with its 200 inhabitants an international atmosphere, with many tourists visiting during the summer season.


Understand[edit]
Summer in this salmon valley is dominated by the king of fish and sports fishermen from all over Europe come to try their luck. The winter passes slowly, just like the water under the icy cover of the Teno River (Norwegian: Tana, Sámi: Deatnu. This is when Norwegian traders and European snowmobiling tourists arrive. When the sun rises over the horizon the village fills with people on snowmobiles and ice-fishermen and their families here to catch the giant Arctic Char. Nuorgam is also a place to visit during the period of winter twilight (officially November 26th – January 16th). At this time you have the possibility to experience the blue light and peacefulness of midwinter. It is not pitch-dark throughout the day, the snow gives us some light and softens the moment. And you may also experience the Northern Lights already in the early afternoon.
The EU’s northernmost school, Nuorgam lower elementary, had 16 pupils in 2018.

Do[edit]
The vast majority of tourists in Nuorgam are Norwegians coming here to buy cheap booze from the Alko store. 
The rest are mostly fishing enthusiasts as Teno is the most important wild salmon river in the Europe. To protect the river and its stock fishing in Teno is strictly regulated; you need to buy a licence and all your fishing equipment must be disinfected (see fishing in Finland). The arctic char is common in many lakes around and during the winter it is the main catch for ice fishing.
South from Nuorgam there is vast backcountry, the Kaldoaivi Wilderness Area. This makes Nuorgam an awesome place for hiking. The 70 km long, marked hiking trail from lake Pulmanki to Sevettijärvi village in Inari is recommended only for experienced trekkers. Near the lake Ylä-Pulmanki, deep within the wilderness area, there is a wreck of a German Junkers-52 airplane shot down by Russians in 1944. The wreck is relatively well preserved due to successful emergency landing and its extremely remote location, it lies over 20 km off the nearest marked trail.
The Arctic Ocean is just 35 km away. Small town Varangerbotn has a large Sami museum.
