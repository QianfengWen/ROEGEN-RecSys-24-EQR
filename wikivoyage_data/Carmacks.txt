Carmacks seen from the Yukon River bridge
Carmacks is a village of 500 people (2016) in Yukon. It is the home of the Little Salmon/Carmacks First Nation, a Northern Tutchone-speaking Aboriginal people.


Understand[edit]
Some call it "The Hub of the Yukon".  It was a traditional stopover for travellers between Whitehorse and Dawson City.
The area around Carmacks has abundant mineral resources, including coal, copper, and gold. Various mining activities are taking place on mineral sites around Carmacks. There is a small zinc-copper mine in production near Carmacks operated by Western Silver and a gold property northwest of Carmacks which is in the exploration stage operated by Northern Freegold Resources based in Whitehorse.

History[edit]
The name of the settlement comes from George Carmack who, in 1891, found coal nearby. He created a trading post and began by engaging in commerce with local people, before opening a coal mine in the south bank of the Yukon River. The focus of his entrepreneurial energy switched a few years later when he or his wife, Kate Carmack, discovered gold, at what was to become the Discovery Claim, near Dawson City.
