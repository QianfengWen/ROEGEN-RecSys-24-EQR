Albany is a city of 72,000 people (2019) in Dougherty County in Georgia's Plantation Midlands region. It is part of the Black Belt, the extensive area in the Deep South of cotton plantations. During 1961–1962, African Americans in Albany played a prominent role in the Civil Rights Movement, founding the Albany Movement, a desegregation and voters' rights coalition formed in 1961. Ray Charles, the singer, songwriter, pianist, and composer, was born here, and is remembered in a park with a statue.


Understand[edit]
Health care, education and the Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany are the largest employers. Manufacturing, transportation, and retail trade are also important foundations of Albany's economy, and the city acts as a hub for commerce in southwest Georgia.
The intersection of Lonesome and Hardup was ranked as the fourth wackiest street intersection name, according to a 2006 poll by the Car Connection website.
