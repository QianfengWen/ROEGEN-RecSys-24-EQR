Keremeos is a village of about 1,500 people (2016) in the Similkameen region of British Columbia. Fruit stands are also a major component of the local economy, making it the self-titled "fruit stand capital of Canada." All sorts of soft fruits, apples, cherries, peaches, and vegetables are grown in the South Similkameen's dry warm climate, and vineyards and wineries are quickly being added as the valley's wine-growing potential is being recognized.


Understand[edit]
Village of Keremeos
Keremeos is on the western boundary of Canada’s Sonoran Desert and is the western gateway to interior wine country.  According to local legend, Keremeos means "the meeting of the winds".
Nearly one-third of its area is occupied by orchards. The economy of the area has been based on agriculture since the first European settlers arrived in the mid-19th century. Abundant sunshine and a vast, replenishing aquifer make the lower Similkameen Valley one of Canada's most productive farmlands.
Keremeos' main industries are horticulture, agriculture, ranching, and wine making, among others. 

History[edit]
With K Mountain as a backdrop, Keremeos is a community whose "Wild West" looks date back to 1909 when the postmaster of the now-abandoned community of Upper Keremeos, Mr. George Kirby, purchased land alongside the Similkameen River in anticipation of the V.V. & E. Railway passing through the area. Eventually the Great Northern Railway from the US built a branch line up to Hedley and other businesses soon followed. Keremeos was incorporated in 1956.

Climate[edit]
Keremeos has a semi-arid climate with cool but short winters and hot, dry summers.
The area has a mild, dry climate with temperatures in the 30-32 °C range in the summer and 1-7 °C in the winter. More than 2600 annual hours of sunshine, annual rainfall is 268mm, and annual snowfall is 50 cm. Elevation is 416m. Frost free period averages 181 days with last freeze occurring around April 18th, first freeze around October 17th.
