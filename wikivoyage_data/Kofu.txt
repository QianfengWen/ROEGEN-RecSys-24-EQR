This page describes a city in Yamanashi. For the township in Tottori, see Kofu (Tottori) (江府).
Kōfu (甲府市 Kōfu-shi) is the capital of Yamanashi Prefecture.

Shosenkyo Gorge

Understand[edit]
Kofu lies at the center of the bowl-shaped prefecture, with some of Japan's most famous mountains rising along the horizon.  On a clear day, a visitor can see Mt. Fuji to the south, Japan's second highest peak Kitadake and the majestic Minami Alps to the west, and the eight fractured peaks of Yatsugatake to the north.

Tourist information site[edit]
The local tourist association has a bilingual guide site.

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
Coming from Tokyo on the Chuo Line, there are few express trains from Shinjuku to Kofu that continue on to Matsumoto.  It is possible to take the journey by local trains at half the price and an extra hour of traveling.  To do so, transfer at JR Takao.  The Chuo Line takes Suica cards.
The Minobu Line runs from Kofu, through Minobu, to Fuji in Shizuoka. This is a quaint railway line, and it is single tracked in most places.  Take a ticket from the machine when you board the train, and pay the driver when you get off.  The Minobu Line acts as a local line in Kofu and has many stations within the city.

By bus[edit]
There are highway buses between Kofu and Shinjuku which on paper take two hours; this is shorter than the local train and challenges the express. In practice, however, traffic delays can lengthen this journey to over three hours. The advantage of the bus is that it is very cheap, costing only ¥2000 one-way which is around half of the price of the express train.

Get around[edit]
Map of Kofu
Kofu is very much a car driven city. The entire city is designed around the idea that everyone has a car with most shops being out of the city centre, by the side of dual carriageways.
It is possible to rent electric bikes at various hotels near Kofu station if you are only travelling short distances. It is only ¥500 for a full-day rental.

See[edit]
Maizurujo Park
The mountains in the north side of the city contain some beautiful scenery and some wonderful views of the Kofu basin and Mt Fuji. In town, there are several tourist sites.

35.686667138.57751 Takeda Shrine (武田神社), 2611 Kofuchumachi (Three kilometers north of Kofu Station.), ☏ +81 55-252-2609, fax: +81 55-252-2600. A shrine dedicated to Takeda Shingen, considered to be among the most powerful warlords during the Warring States Period. It was built where his own residence once stood.

35.664975138.5704692 Maizuru Castle Park (舞鶴城公園), 1 Marunouchi (Just SE of Kofu Station.), ☏ +81 55-226-6550. Kofu Castle was largely demolished in the 19th century. Now it is more of a pretty park than a castle. The walls however remain impressive. Though it doesn't compare well to the great castles of Japan, it is certainly in better shape than Fukui Castle. Reconstruction works are ongoing, with parts of it being rebuilt according to traditional methods. There now exists a castle tower and a very impressive gatehouse (this being separate from the rest of the castle, north of Kofu Station). There are frequent talks of rebuilding the donjon.

Buy[edit]
Kofu is famous for grapes and wine.

35.66053138.5746551 Inden-Ya (印伝屋). Inden is the ancient Japanese practice of applying lacquer to deer leather. It appears in one of Japan's oldest texts, the Nihon-Shoki. During the Warring States Period, the local samurai warlord Takeda Shingen had his armor made with inden. This was the beginning of Koshu inden (Koshu is an alternative name for Kai Province, the old name of Yamanashi Prefecture). In addition to his armor, he also had Inden bags made, which were known for holding heavy weapons without giving out. Modern Koshu Inden features a variety of bags, purses, belts, and wallets among other things. They use the lacquer to create fashionable patterns but they still maintain the samurai durability.
