Harpers Ferry is a historic town of 285 people (2020) in the northern corner of the Shenandoah Valley just inside West Virginia. It is a natural transportation hub: the Shenandoah River empties into the Potomac there. Three states meet there. East from Harpers Ferry, over the Shenandoah, is Virginia. North, across the Potomac, is Maryland.


Understand[edit]
Harpers Ferry is, for its size, as full of history as any town in the United States, with the possible exception of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. A lot happened in Harper's Ferry (as it was spelled until the 20th century). Nearly half a million people visit the Harpers Ferry National Historical Park each year.

View of Harpers Ferry from the Maryland side of the Potomac
In 1859 Harper's Ferry was the location of the largest episode of guerrilla warfare in American history up to that point. A group of abolitionists led by John Brown attacked an armory in the town, hoping to get weapons for a slave revolt. There was a battle with Brown and his followers on the one side, and federal troops commanded by Robert E. Lee on the other side. While the attack failed and Brown was hanged shortly thereafter, it is said to have contributed greatly to the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861.
Visitors to Harpers Ferry should be aware that the topic of John Brown is a sensitive one. He was not seen as a hero to the pro-slavery white population.
A comic historical novel about Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry is Flashman and the Angel of the Lord.
