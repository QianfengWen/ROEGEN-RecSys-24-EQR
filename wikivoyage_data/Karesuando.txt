Karesuando (Sámi: Gárasavvon, Finnish: Karesuvanto) is the northernmost village in Sweden, in the municipality of Kiruna. Across the Muoniojoki river is the Finnish half of the village, Karesuvanto.


Understand[edit]
This is the northernmost official border crossing between Finland and Sweden. The border is undramatic; if you have a boat or the river is frozen, you normally do not have to use the bridge. The Currency and time zone are different in Finland. 
It is famous as the birthplace of the temperance and pietist Christian revival movement Laestadianism. It was founded by the vicar Lars Levi Laestadius, who served in Karesuando between 1826 and 1849 and spread rapidly among the Sami, eventually growing into the largest Christian revival movement in the Nordic countries.
The Swedish part of Karesuando has about 350 inhabitants, just above the 200 inhabitants needed to qualify as a village (tätort) in Swedish statistics. With 150 on the Finnish side, the combined population is some 500.
The only settlements further north in Sweden are smaller hamlets, single homes, or tourist camps.
There is Swedish, Sami and Finnish heritage.
