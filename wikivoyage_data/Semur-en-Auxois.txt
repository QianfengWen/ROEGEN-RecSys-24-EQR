Semur-en-Auxois is a medieval town in the heart of the Côte-d'Or, Burgundy, on the banks of the Armançon. Semur was once a fortified town, and though the castle has now been mostly dismantled, the tall towers and main wall still remain and surround the inner part of the town. Visitors enjoy walking the quaint cobblestone streets, shopping and dining in the pedestrian area, and taking in the magnificent views from the two medieval bridges across the Armançon — the Pont Joly and the Pont des Minimes.
