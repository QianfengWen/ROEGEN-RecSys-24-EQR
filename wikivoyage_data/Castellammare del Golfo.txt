Castellammare del Golfo is a town in Trapani Province of Sicily.


Understand[edit]
Castellammare del Golfo rises at the foot of Mount Inici and gives the name to the homonymous gulf, stretching from capo Rama (on the east) as far as capo San Vito (on the west). Castellammare began as Emporium Segestanorum (the port of the near Segesta). The word empòrion in the ancient Mediterranean denoted a harbour used for the unloading, storing and selling of goods, and until the Arabs’ arrival its history identifies with that of Segesta.  The naming “castrum ad mare de gulfo” dates back to the early years of the second millennium, when Castellammare became an important fortress, first of the Normans and later of the Swabians.

When to go[edit]
As Castellammare is a sea and tourist resort, the ideal season for having a holiday there is summer. However, thanks to its mild climate, in March you can already profit a vacation under the hot sun of Sicily. Until October you will certainly enjoy beautiful and warm days.

Map of Castellammare del Golfo
You can reach Castellammare through the National Road (S.S.) 187 both from Palermo and Trapani. If you come from Palermo (going through Alcamo Marina and the railway station of Castellammare) you soon enter  the town and meet Largo Petrolo with its wonderful view on the Gulf.  From here  you can go to the centre (on the left) or to the port and the Castle (turning right). If you decide to go to the town centre, it is very easy by going on foot: the Civic Gardens, the Town Hall, the Theatre and Arena delle Rose are at about 500 m. If you come from Trapani,  through the same road, after the junctions for San Vito and Scopello you can enter the town trough via Crispi or via Segesta. The main lines of march are three: corso Garibaldi, (which you can enter from via Crispi or via Segesta) will lead you to the town centre. Via Marconi will lead you outside the town, towards the beaches of Playa and Alcamo Marina, and finally via Petrazzi and via Roma, which starting from the port or the gardens (through via Roma), will lead you to the National Road 187 for all destinations and the A29 Motorway.

The event being recalled happened on July 13, 1718, when Castellammare was in the middle of the war between Philip V of Spain and Amedeo of Savoia for the possession of Sicily. A Spanish ship, chased by 5 English ones, sheltered below the castle, which defended it. The English fleet attacked by setting fire to the town: the people, imploring the Patroness (the Virgin Mary), escaped. But suddenly the Madonna, in a white dress, is said to have appeared with a host of angels from Monte delle Scale. This apparition reportedly caused the English to flee in fear. The show represents these events with lights, sounds, pyrotechnic effects and starts at sunset. The recalling ends with a concert and fireworks.
