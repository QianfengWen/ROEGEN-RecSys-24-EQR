Get in[edit]
Map of Chatham (Massachusetts)


By car[edit]
From Route 6 take Exit 11; go left off the ramp onto Route 137 South; go straight through one set of lights (by car dealership); go straight (actually a right dogleg) at the four way stop at Queen Anne Rd. ( The Corner Store on corner); continue to the Route 28 intersection (the road will end).  Turning right (west) will bring you into the South Chatham neighborhood, while turning left (east) will lead you through Chatham's Main Street (the local name for Route 28).  Driving straight (or more precisely, left and then an immediate right up a driveway) brings you to Chatham's Tourist Information Center, sponsored by the local chamber of commerce.  This is an excellent first stop, as the Center's volunteers can provide local context and suggestions.
