North Main Street in Greeneville
Greeneville is a small town in Tennessee that was the political base of President Andrew Johnson. You can visit two of his homes and his burial place here. The town was the capital of the short-lived State of Franklin in the 18th-century history of the Tennessee region.


Understand[edit]
Greeneville is notable as the town where United States President Andrew Johnson began his political career when elected from his trade as a tailor. He and his family lived there most of his adult years. It was an area of strong abolitionist and Unionist views and yeoman farmers, an environment which influenced Johnson's outlook. Its population in 2010 was 15,000. 

History[edit]
Native Americans were hunting and camping in the Nolichucky Valley as early as the Paleo-Indian period (c. 10,000 BCE). A substantial Woodland period (1000 BCE - 1000 CE) village existed at the Nolichucky's confluence with Big Limestone Creek (now part of Davy Crockett Birthplace State Park). By the time the first Euro-American settlers arrived in the area in the late 18th century, the Cherokee claimed the valley as part of their hunting grounds. The Great Indian Warpath passed just northwest of modern Greeneville.
Permanent European settlement of Greene County began in 1772. The county was named after Nathanael Greene, reflecting the loyalties of the numerous Revolutionary War veterans who settled in the Nolichucky Valley. 
In 1784, North Carolina attempted to resolve its debts by giving the U.S. Congress its lands west of the Appalachian Mountains, including Greene County, abandoning responsibility for the area to the federal government. In response, delegates from Greene and neighboring counties convened at Jonesborough and resolved to break away from North Carolina and establish an independent state. 

Replica of the Capitol of the State of Franklin in Greeneville
A petition for statehood for the proposed State of Franklin (named in honor of Benjamin Franklin) was submitted to Congress in May 1785, but it failed to gain the requisite votes needed for admission to the Union. The first state legislature of Franklin met in a log cabin in December 1785 in a crude log courthouse in Greeneville, which had been named the capital city. However, the Franklin movement began to collapse soon thereafter, and North Carolina reasserted its control of the area the following spring.
Greene County, like much of East Tennessee, was home to a strong abolitionist (anti-slavery) movement in the early 19th century. This movement was likely influenced by the relatively large numbers of Quakers who migrated to the region from Pennsylvania in the 1790s. 
In June 1861, on the eve of the American Civil War, 30 counties of the pro-Union East Tennessee Convention met in Greeneville to discuss strategy after state voters had elected to join the Confederate States of America. The convention sought to create a separate state in East Tennessee that would remain with the United States. The state government rejected the convention's request, however, and East Tennessee was occupied by Confederate forces shortly thereafter. Several conspirators who lived near what is now Mosheim managed to destroy the railroad bridge over Lick Creek in western Greene County on the night of November 8, 1861. Two of the conspirators, Jacob Hensie and Henry Fry, were executed in Greeneville on November 30, 1861.
Andrew Johnson, the 17th President of the United States, spent much of his life in Greeneville. In 1826, Johnson arrived in Greeneville after fleeing an apprenticeship in Raleigh. Johnson purchased a tailor shop, which he moved from Main Street to its present location at the corner of Depot and College streets. He was elected to the Greeneville City Council in 1829, and mayor in 1834. As Johnson rose through the ranks of political office in state and national government, he used his influence to help Greeneville constituents obtain government positions. Whilst Andrew Johnson was away from home during his vice-presidency, both union and confederate armies often used his home as a place to stay and rest during their travel. Soldiers left graffiti on the walls of Johnson's home, and evidence of the graffiti remains. 
The rural community of Camp Creek south of Greeneville was severely affected by an EF-3 tornado in 2011 Super Outbreak. Six people were killed immediately and a seventh died later. Horse Creek, southeast of Greeneville, was also hit by an EF-3 tornado during the same outbreak. One person was killed in that community. A total of eight were killed in Greene County.
