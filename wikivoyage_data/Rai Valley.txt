Rai Valley is a small rural settlement in Marlborough in NZ's South Island.  If the dryness of the rest of Marlborough drives you to drink then Rai Valley will amaze with its lushness.  When it rains it rains!!  But set halfway between Blenheim and Nelson who contest each other for the sunshine record for New Zealand it also receives loads of sunshine.  The result stunning green scenery with fantastic native bush.  Rai Valley is a handy place to explore the Sounds.
