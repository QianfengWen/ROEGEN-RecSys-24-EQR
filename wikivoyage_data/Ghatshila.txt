A small township with mixture of people from communities like Bengalis, Biharis, Gujratis, Marwadis, Punjabis and Muslims, all staying together in harmony participating in each other's festivals. Geographically placed between two mountain ranges with the Subarnarekha river separating them from kissing each other. Aerial view is beautiful from top of any mountain like the Surda pahar.
