Longreach is a visitor-friendly town in Central Outback Queensland. Longreach is a popular outback destination for many travelers, particularly those doing road trips around Australia. The town has focused on the visitor experience and despite its isolation has a number of attractions and experiences to engage visitors. 


Understand[edit]
This small town of 3,000 people (2016) is named after the 'long reach' of the Thomson River upon which it sits. Unlike many other rivers in Outback Queensland this part of the Thomson River tends to retain water year round and doesn't often go dry. The town has a strong connection with Qantas and its airport was one of the first bases of the then 'Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Service' which later became the national carrier Qantas. The nearest large settlement is 687 kilometres away in Rockhampton.
Given the Outback setting the climate is particularly harsh in summer with the daily temperature often in excess of 40°C / 100°F. Visitor season runs in the cooler months from April to October, with Easter often marking the beginning of each season. During off-season the number of experiences available for visitors is reduced with tour offerings and dinner experiences in particular less available.
Along with many other areas of Queensland, Longreach is in the midst of a long standing drought resulting in difficult times for the town and surrounding areas. Tourism is a key contributor to the towns economy while the drought continues.
