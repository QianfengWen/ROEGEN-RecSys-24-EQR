Understand[edit]
Sunrise at Ormond Beach
Ormond Beach is located at the north end of the Daytona Beach area. Ormond Beach was once home to oil industry multi-millionaire, John D. Rockefeller and railroad magnate, Henry Flagler, as well as the early automotive pioneers who tested their inventions on the hard-packed beach.
Today, Ormond Beach is known as the "Birthplace of Speed" and celebrates its racing heritage with annual events that reenact the early days of racing on the beach.  Visitors to the area can enjoy a tour through the Casements, the former winter home of John D. Rockefeller, canoeing, fishing and viewing a vast array of wildlife at the Tomoka State Park. The area also boasts several beachfront and riverfront parks. Visitors seeking a quieter part of the beach can find it in the Ormond Beach area. In fact, beach driving is not allowed at the northern end of Ormond Beach.

Climate[edit]
Ormond Beach offers a humid, subtropical climate that is typical throughout Florida. Winters are dry and mild, marked by a constant series of cold fronts and warm-ups. Temperatures dip into the low 40s and upper 30s on occasion, although freezes are rare. Snowfall is very rare.
Temperatures in spring are famously pleasant with warm afternoons, cool evenings, and far less humidity. The summers are long, hot and humid, with temperatures frequently in the upper 90's in July. Thunderstorms are frequent in summer afternoons. Dangers include hurricanes from June 1 until November 30, although the area has not been threatened since the storms of 2004.
