Östhammar was granted city rights in 1368 by king Albrecht of Mecklenburg, however, by that date the area was already a trading hub. By the end of the 15th century the waterway into Östhammar had become too shallow. Therefore the burghers decided to move to the nearby location Öregrund, taking Östhammars city rights with them. In 1520 Öregrund was destroyed on the orders of king Christian II of Denmark. As a consequence, Östhammar was repopulated, this time somewhat closer to the coast, and regained its city privileges. Östhammar is famous for the iron industry founded by the Walloons in the 17th century. By the end of the 19th century Öregrund became a popular sea-side resort.
Today Östhammar is a seasonal summer city, with plenty of people and activities during the summer months and a much quieter and calmer atmosphere during the winter. There are a lot of summer cottages scattered around the coast and on the nearby islands. The largest and most well-known of these islands is Gräsö, Sweden's 10th largest island.
