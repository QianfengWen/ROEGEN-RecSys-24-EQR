Get in[edit]
Shizuoka is a stop on the Tokaido Main Line and Tokaido Shinkansen Line between Tokyo and Osaka, and on the Tomei Expressway.

By plane[edit]
34.796111138.1894441 Mt. Fuji Shizuoka Airport (FSZ  IATA) (Makinohara and Shimada). Fuji Dream Airlines is based at the airport, operating flights to Sapporo, Fukuoka and Kagoshima. All Nippon Airways operates flights to Sapporo and Okinawa. International flights operate to and from Taiwan and several cities in China.   
Buses run from Mt. Fuji Shizuoka Airport to the Shizuoka train station in about an hour at a cost of ¥1000. While the airport was built right over the Tokaido Shinkansen line, there is no train station serving the airport.
The nearest major airports are Haneda and Narita Airports in Tokyo, and Chubu International Airport in Nagoya. It takes approximately two hours to reach Shizuoka from Haneda or Chubu on the fastest train services, a little longer from Narita.

By train[edit]
The Tokaido Shinkansen runs one Hikari train per hour which stops at Shizuoka (and pauses for about 5 minutes while faster Nozomi trains barrel through the station). It is one hour from Tokyo (¥‎6350), 50 minutes from Nagoya (¥‎6350), 90 minutes from Kyoto (¥‎10240), and 1 hr 45 min from Shin-Osaka (¥‎10880) using this train.
All-stopping Kodama trains take a bit longer, and the same prices are charged for normal reservations. However, you can take advantage of the Puratto (Platt) Kodama Ticket (Japanese), which offers a discount for Kodama services if you purchase at least one day in advance. You get a reserved seat and a coupon for a free drink (including beer) which can be redeemed at a "Kiosk" convenience counter inside the station. With this ticket a trip to Shizuoka costs ¥4600 from Tokyo (90 minutes), ¥4600 from Nagoya (80 minutes), ¥7600 from Kyoto (2 hr 15 min) and ¥8100 from Shin-Osaka (2½ hr). Kodama trains run once an hour from Shin-Osaka and Kyoto; twice per hour from the other cities. All Kodama trains can be used, except for early morning departures.
Standard local trains from Tokyo take about 3 hr 15 min at a cost of ¥‎3350, requiring at least one change of trains at Atami or Numazu.
Wide View Fujikawa limited express trains make several daily round-trips to Shizuoka from Kofu on the Chuo Line. The ride, in train cars with larger windows, costs ¥‎4620 and takes about 2 hr 15 min.
Hamamatsu can be reached by either Shinkansen (30 minutes) or regular JR (1½ hours).
You can ride all of these trains for free with the Japan Rail Pass.

By bus[edit]
From Tokyo, JR/Shizutetsu Sunpu Liner buses run every 1-2 hours from the Shinjuku Highway Bus Terminal (Busta Shinjuku), arriving at the Shizuoka train station in 3 hours (¥‎2930). These buses make a 20-minute rest stop at the Ashigara Service Area on the Tomei Expressway.
Some buses between Tokyo and Nagoya only stop at the Shizuoka interchange of the expressway, on the outskirts of the city. Local buses run frequently to Shizuoka station from another bus stop close to the interchange in 15 minutes.
Overnight buses run from Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka.

Get around[edit]
Map of Shizuoka
The Shizutetsu train line runs from Shin-Shizuoka station in the Cenova shopping mall to Shin-Shimizu station. It is worth noting that none of the stations are integrated into the JR train system. However, Shizutetsu Buses do operate service from Shizuoka station to the Cenova mall. Shizutetsu buses can be used to get anywhere in the city.
