Chicory growing wild in Bluefield
Bluefield is a city of 9,800 people (as of 2018) in Mercer County, West Virginia. Along with Bluefield, Virginia, it forms the micropolitan area of the Bluefields.
Nestled at the foot of the 3,400-foot East River Mountain, Bluefield is the most elevated town in West Virginia, at 2,655 feet above sea level. The town is sometimes called "Summit City", because of its high altitude, and "Nature's Air-Conditioned City" for its pleasant summer temperatures. Since 1941, the Chamber of Commerce's "Lemonade Lassies" have passed out free lemonade on days when the temperature exceeds 90 °F (32 °C). The airport thermometer is used to determine this, which is at the highest point in Bluefield. It can often exceed 90° in downtown Bluefield during the summer.
The area was first settled in the 1780s and incorporated in 1889. Named for the blue chicory fields in the area, Bluefield was a booming Norfolk and Western Railroad hub for the coal industry until the decline of coal in the 1960s. Today the city has an air of faded 1950s glory; some of the lovely homes have seen better days, the downtown is largely deserted, and passenger railways have given way to freight cars. The city is beginning to embark on an aggressive revitalization scheme, by restoring old buildings, attracting specialty shops and restaurants back to downtown, and focusing on tourism as a promising source of revenue. The town still retains its small-town Appalachian charm, with friendly people, beautiful scenery, and very low housing costs.
One of the best-known local residents is John Forbes Nash, winner of the 1994 Nobel Prize in economics and the subject of the 2001 film A Beautiful Mind. The town has yet to capitalize on this connection, however, so if you're a big fan of the man or the movie, you won't find a lot of related activities or sights in the area. Nash's boyhood home is undergoing renovation, and will likely be a listed historic site in the near future.

By car[edit]
Bluefield is just off I-77, between Beckley in the north and Wytheville, Virginia, in the south. Most people will use exit 1, although if you're travelling south to Bluefield, you may see a sign recommending that you get off at exit 9; this, however, is only a needless detour through Princeton. At Bluefield, I-77 becomes the West Virginia Turnpike; if you continue north from Bluefield, you'll encounter toll booths.
The other main roads that pass through the town are US-19, from Abingdon, Virginia in the southwest to Beckley in the north; US-52, from Williamson in the northwest to Wytheville, Virginia, in the south; and US-460, from Grundy, Virginia in the west to Blacksburg, Virginia, in the east.

Get around[edit]
Bring your car! The area is rather mountainous, so if you stray from the main highways, you'll probably end up in some hilly terrain. It can be treacherous, especially in winter; but the upside, of course, is that the scenery is often spectacular.
There are also several streets in town that are very steep (Jefferson and S Mercer being good examples); traversing them in warm weather is nail-biting enough, but when the streets are covered with snow or ice, you definitely don't want to attempt it without four-wheel drive.

Also of note is one of the most passionate high school sports rivalries in the country:

37.251111-81.2441671 Battle of the Bluefields (Bluefield–Graham game), Mitchell Stadium, Stadium Dr. If you're a fan of high school football, this annual rivalry is not to be missed. The Bluefield Beavers and Graham G-Men, respectively representing the public high schools of the West Virginia and Virginia Bluefields, first played in 1911 and have played every year since 1928. While the schools have a strong rivalry in all sports that they sponsor, the football version is by far the most passionate. Mitchell Stadium, located in the West Virginia city's park (though with the state line passing through the parking lot), is the home field for both teams, and the rivalry game sells out every year.
