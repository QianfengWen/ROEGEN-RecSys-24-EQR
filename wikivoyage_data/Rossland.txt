Rossland is a small mountain city in Southern British Columbia, Canada.  Rossland was built in the 1890s as a gold mining town, and has become a lovely city of 3,700 people (2016).  Rossland sits inside the crater of a dormant volcano in the Kootenay Range. It has become well-known for its excellent ski and mountain bike trails.


Understand[edit]
Downtown Rossland
Rossland was named by a miner, Ross Thompson, who staked a claim in 1890. He had tried to call the city Thompson, but he was advised that there was already a town with that name.

Rossland is a small enough place that everything can easily be reached by foot, however be prepared to deal with some steep hills.  Alternatively, traffic is light enough that driving throughout the town is quite painless.  Keep an eye open, however, as the locals jaywalk quite frequently.  Watch out for rogue mountain bikes as well.
