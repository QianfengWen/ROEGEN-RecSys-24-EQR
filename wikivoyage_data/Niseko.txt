Niseko Yumoto Onsen
Niseko (ニセコ) is a town and ski resort on the northern island of Hokkaido, Japan.


Understand[edit]
Niseko is an increasingly popular destination for powder hungry skiers and boarders, and nearly alone among Japan's ski resorts is drawing increasing numbers of overseas visitors year-on-year as well. Niseko is highly favored by Australians, and by Asian tourists.  The resort boasts four ski areas: Hanazono, Hirafu, Niseko Village (formerly Higashiyama) and Annupuri.  Most activity is centered on the village of Hirafu, approximately 20 minutes from the main town and administrative centre in the area, Kutchan.

Tourist information site[edit]
The local tourist association has a bilingual guide site.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The nearest airport to Niseko is Sapporo's New Chitose Airport, which receives flights from all over Japan and from some international destinations.
There are direct international flights from most neighboring countries. If you come from further far away often Nagoya (Chubu) or Seoul are most convenient transfers.

By bus[edit]
During winter months, numerous limousine bus services are provided to various ski resorts in Niseko at a cost of ¥1900-2300 each way.  In addition, two public bus lines run buses from New Chitose Airport (CTS IATA) to Hirafu. Both operate on a regular timetable during the ski season, with the Chuo Bus having 5 trips each way daily while Donan Buses have 4 each way.
Times are subject to change from season to season, but each can be contacted by phone (Chuo-Bus +81 11 231 0500, and Donan-Bus +81 123 465701).  In the 2017/18 season, the cost of a one-way ticket is ¥2600 and a return is ¥4500 (50% less for children).  The trip takes 3½ - 4 hours, depending on the road conditions. This is an excellent way to see the countryside, the snow covered farm lands and the quaint houses.
In the 2011/12 season both bus lines offer a discounted return ticket including a strongly discounted one-day ski pass.

By train[edit]
Reaching Niseko from Sapporo by train is a lengthy affair, requiring a transfer of trains at Otaru, and perhaps a long wait as well; local trains between Otaru and Niseko run about every 1.5 hours. But, if it's between December and March, and you decide to leave Sapporo at around 8:00 or 12:30, you can get to Niseko on a direct train. The limited express train, appropriately named the Niseko Ski-Express, makes the run in 2 hours at a cost of ¥4560. Return Ski-Express trains depart from Niseko at 10:00 and 16:00. There is no charge for this train with the Japan Rail Pass.

If you're staying near Hirafu, the best option is to take trains to Kutchan (with a transfer at Otaru; ¥2100), then ride a local bus to Hirafu (about ¥400, 20 minutes).

Get around[edit]
Annupuri
In winter (Dec - early Apr) the Niseko United Shuttle runs between the four resorts. The route runs in a line from Annupuri to Hanazono, with multiple stops at each of the four resorts. Operates roughly 08:00-16:40, with extended hours until 19:40 in peak season (mid Dec to mid March). Travel time from one end to the other is about 1 hour, with departures every 40-60 minutes. Free with an All-Mountain Day pass or season pass, 1 point with an All-Mountain Point pass, and charges a fee otherwise.
Skiers and snowboarders can move between areas by ascending to the upper lifts and traversing the mountain. Although a little difficult to follow on the map, there are specific paths for traversing between areas. This sometimes requires a little bit of walking uphill, but the distances are short enough that it's not a problem, and it will be much faster than waiting for the shuttle. However, the upper lifts needed to accomplish this may be closed due to weather, and even when open, the winds at the top of the mountain can be fierce.

See[edit]
42.82735140.8082251 Mt. Yotei (羊蹄山). This 1,898-m peak is directly opposite Hirafu at Niseko.  The peak makes for great views in the winter.  In the summer, many people climb it, and it is possible to stay on top of the mountain in the Mountain Hut (山小屋).  This mountain is sometimes called Ezo Fuji (蝦夷富士) due to its strong resemblance to Japan's iconic Mt. Fuji, with Ezo being the former official name for the island of Hokkaido. 
Do[edit]
Winter[edit]
 Skiing. Skiers love the deep, reliable powder, tree runs and relative ease to find untracked snow.  There are no real steeps here (max slope is approx 35 degrees) but there are lots of great runs, serviced by good quality lifts, most of which are gondolas or covered chairs. Niseko is renowned for its huge amount of powder brought from Siberia by northern weather patterns. 
 Snowboarding. Niseko is a snowboarder's snowy-cultural paradise. The area averages 12-16 meters of light snow every season to slide sideways, shred, surf and slash. Niseko United includes the four resorts of Hanazono, Niseko Grand Hirafu, Niseko Village Higashiyama and Annupuri on one all mountain pass (29 lifts, 3 gondolas)  From deep powder runs to your pick of 3 terrain parks, Niseko offers a lot to enjoy. 
Summer[edit]
 Hiking. In the summer, there are several wonderful day hikes. 
 Biking. It's possible to bike around Mount Yotei, by using the surrounding, mostly quiet, roads for a total of 52 kilometers. Bike rental is available from various establishments, including Rhythm Japan, for around ¥4000 per day. Tours are also available.

Eat[edit]
The diversity and quality of Niseko's cuisine scene is part of its appeal as a travel destination. Eating out will definitely be one of the highlights of your visit to Hokkaido. Local specialities include potatoes and seafood. There are also a large number of restaurants that specialize in Italian, Korean, Indonesian, Thai, Nepalese and other ethnic foods. Families on a budget will also be pleased with the variety of outlets offering quality meals at affordable prices.
For smaller restaurants, it's best to reserve in advance (up to 1-2 days before, if you can plan that far ahead). Otherwise, the wait at the door may be 1-2 hours at some places.
