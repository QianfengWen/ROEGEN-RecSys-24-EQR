Dongducheon is a city of 95,000 people (2019) in Gyeonggi province, South Korea.


Understand[edit]
Dongducheon is a satellite city lying to the north of Seoul, within 40 km of its metropolitan area. It is adjacent to Pocheon to the northeast, Yangju to the west and south, and Yeoncheon County to the northwest. It consists of eight dongs (neighborhoods).
The city is strategically important for the defense of the Korean capital. It belongs to a military protection zone and has developed as a base village that grew rapidly since the Korean War. The main camps of the United States Second Infantry Division are in the city, and the division command is at Uijeongbu.
The Dongducheon area is where you can climb a mountain at any point because the entire city is surrounded by mountain ridges. The representative Soyosan mountain is good for hiking because the hiking trails are well maintained. As forests occupy most of them, you can find many valleys everywhere, and Tapdong Valley is considered one of the most beautiful vacation spots in all four seasons.
