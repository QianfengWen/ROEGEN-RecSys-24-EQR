51.34240.75312 Church of All Saints, Murston. An Anglican parish church, which is notable due to its architect, William Burges, and was constructed in 1873–4. The church was built in "an early Gothic Style" and incorporates fragments of the original 12th-century church.  The estimate was £3,000 but the public subscription raised only £2,000. As a consequence, the intended tower was truncated.   (updated Dec 2020)
