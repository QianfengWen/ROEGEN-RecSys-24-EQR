Highway 11 running through Paihia

Paihia is an historic town (population 1,800) in the Bay of Islands in the Northland region of the North Island of New Zealand. It has numerous sights and activities, and stunning views of the bay.


Understand[edit]
An early Christian missionary, Henry Williams, settled in Paihia in 1823 and built New Zealand's first church here. Adjacent Waitangi is where representatives of the English Crown and a number of Maori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi on 6 February 1840. The estate is a must-see for anyone interested in New Zealand's history and culture.
Marsden Road is the main waterfront road. The commercial centre is around the junction of Marsden Road and Williams Road. The wharf from where most of the maritime activities depart is here. The Maritime Building next to the wharf houses two tour companies.
Several cruises that depart from Paihia are approved by the Department of Conservation to seek dolphins and whales in the wild. Some tours allow you to swim in the sheltered bay with common and bottlenose dolphins. Cruises may also see baleen whales, orca, seals, fish, penguins and other sea and bird life.
