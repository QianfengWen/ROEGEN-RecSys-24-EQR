São Bernardo do Campo is a municipality in the metropolitan area of São Paulo. Similarly to Santo André, it is divided into two districts:

The main district, or "the city of São Bernardo do Campo", an urban area with an economy based on industry, and regarded as the birthplace of Brazil's modern labour movement. That is where the Central Única dos Trabalhadores (CUT), which is the largest trade union of Latin America, was founded.
The Riacho Grande district, predominantly covered by the Billings water reservoir and Parque Estaudal Serra do Mar (a preserved rainforest area). The district is the starting point of the Caminhos do Mar walking tour, that descends along the rainforest until the coast, offering breathtaking views and containing historical constructions from Brazil's Imperial era.

Understand[edit]
Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Both districts of São Bernardo are easily accessible from São Paulo by the Anchieta motorway.

By public transport[edit]
From São Paulo, the main district of São Bernardo can be reached by the metropolitan bus operated by EMTU, that departs from the Jabaquara metro and bus station. This bus is reasonably fast since it has a dedicated corridor.

From São Paulo's Far South to Riacho Grande[edit]
The district of Riacho Grande is next to São Paulo's Far South, and it is actually possible to go from one area to another, using either car or public transport. This ride is an adventure in itself, and it is an excellent way to admire the beautiful nature that surrounds the urban area of São Paulo.
The journey begins at Av. Da. Belmira Marin, in Grajaú (that starts from Av. Senador Teotônio Vilela), and involves taking three ferry boats over the Billings Reservoir. The second ferry boat crosses the border between São Paulo and São Bernardo do Campo, and if you are going by bus, you need to go on this ferry boat on foot (although you may take another bus in the other side). The total length of the journey, from Av. Senador Teotônio Vilela to the main village of Riacho Grande, is about 30 km.

São Bernardo do Campo sits in a privileged location, being the city of the metropolitan area of São Paulo closest to the beach. In good traffic conditions, the coastal cities Santos, Praia Grande, Guarujá, Bertioga and São Vicente can all be reached in 45-50 min from the city center of São Bernardo by taking Rodovia Anchieta.
However, only Santos is reachable by the local intercity bus service, provided by Viação Cometa. To get to other coastal cities by bus it is necessary to go first to the Jabaquara intercity bus terminal, in São Paulo, or take another intercity bus in Santos.
