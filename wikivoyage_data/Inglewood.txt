Randy's Donuts, an LA landmark
Inglewood is a city in Los Angeles County in Southern California. Sandwiched between South Central Los Angeles and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), it is a somewhat impoverished area. Though there isn't much for a tourist to see, there are some excellent eats here and a number of chain motels taking advantage of the city's proximity to LAX.


Understand[edit]
Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
While Inglewood is not served by any major Interstate, U.S or California Highway Route, the city is served by auxiliary Interstates. Interstate 405, which is near the LAX, is always busy. Interstate 105 and 110, although less busy, are still pretty clogged with traffic. The California State Highway Route 90, while does not directly go to Inglewood, is near the city. Although it might take a longer time, if the traveler wants less traffic to deal with, they may want to take the California State Highway Route 90, then take West Slauson Avenue, then turning to South La Cienega Boulevard and then turning at West Manchester Boulevard.

By plane[edit]
While Inglewood doesn't have its own airport, there are many major airports that surround Inglewood, giving it the motto "Harbor of the Air". The Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) is the major airport that serves flights to Inglewood. The Hawthorne Municipal Airport is just south of the city. The Compton Woodley, Santa Monica and Long Beach Airports are also nearby.

See[edit]
Until the 2020s, there wasn't much to see in Inglewood. The city is mainly just single-family homes and apartments, although there are a few nice parks and the famous Forum arena. However, that's changed with the development of two major sports venues. The NFL's Los Angeles Rams opened SoFi Stadium in 2020, with the Los Angeles Chargers also moving in. The Los Angeles Clippers of the NBA will leave Crypto.com Arena in downtown L.A., which they have shared with the Lakers since 1999, for the new Intuit Dome in 2024.

33.95821-118.3421 Kia Forum, 3900 West Manchester Blvd, ☏ +1 310 330-7300. The former home of the Los Angeles Lakers, it was overshadowed for many years due to the 1999 opening of the Downtown LA venue now known as Crypto.com Arena. However, a major renovation (completed in 2014) transformed the Forum from a sports arena to a premier concert venue, removing the scoreboards and luxury boxes and focusing heavily on creating a space with great acoustics. Today it is a 17,500-seat arena that regularly hosts major musical acts and awards shows.   (updated Feb 2024)

Budget[edit]

33.95019-118.344012 Lee's Caribbean Restaurant, 1041 S Prairie Ave. Near Toni's, this traditional Caribbean restaurant has some pretty good chicken. The service may be a little slow, but it's worth it.

Stay safe[edit]
Inglewood is not as dangerous as commonly believed. Since the 1992 riots the crime rate has been dropping; however, rates of robbery and assault are much higher than the national average. During the day gang activity is low and police patrol the streets. At night time, be careful of your surroundings and avoid anyone acting suspicious. Avoid large groups of people wearing gang colors, and also be alert for anyone who is on drugs or drunk. Most crime happens in the central part of the city, and the outer areas have a lower crime rate. Be careful when in the central neighborhoods (such as the City Center or the intersection between Crenshaw and Manchester Boulevards), the areas surrounding Lennox Boulevard and Burl Avenue, 104th Street and Crenshaw Boulevard and the area between Van Ness Avenue and the Imperial Freeway. These are the areas that you will most likely encounter trouble.

The following cities and neighborhoods share a border with Inglewood:

Westchester - Inglewood's western neighbor is the home of Los Angeles International Airport  and a number of lodging options.
Hawthorne - Bordering Inglewood to the south, Hawthorne is home to several aerospace companies including SpaceX, and is an option for those needing lodging near Los Angeles International Airport.
South Central LA - Located northeast of Inglewood, South Central has its rough parts but is definitely worth a visit to see the Space Shuttle Endeavour at the California Science Center, as well as the campus of USC and the sights of Exposition Park.
