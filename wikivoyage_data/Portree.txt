Portree (Gaelic: Port Rìgh) is the main village on the Isle of Skye in the Scottish Inner Hebrides. With a population of 2300 in 2022, it's the obvious base for exploring the island. The name means "King's Port", probably a reference to James V. It's not a ferry port but in bygone years was a significant port for emigration, for trade when the roads were just muddy tracks, and for naval patrols against the king's foes - in 1746 Bonnie Prince Charlie snuck through town under their noses. 
57.4119-6.19351 Visit Scotland iCentre (tel +44 1478 612992) is the tourist office, on Bayfield Road IV51 9EL, open Apr-Sep M-Sa 9:30AM-5PM, Oct-Mar M-Sa 10AM-4PM.

See[edit]
57.4114-6.19121 The Harbour has colourful houses and shingle beach, with attractive hills sheltering the bay from the ocean gales.
57.40962-6.191592 The Lump is the headland just south of town; events are often held here. The Apothecary Tower is a folly of 1830, wrecked by a storm of 1978 but rebuilt, and you can ascend the interior steps for fine views. The hills seen east across the channel are the island of Raasay; until the 20th century you could only get from one end of that island to the other by ferry to Skye and out again.
57.4795-6.18023 Bride's Veil Falls are a cascade on the road between Lochs Fada and Leathan. By this point the Old Man of Storr should be in view, unless the clouds are right down and you're not destined to see him today.
57.507-6.17474 The Storr is the contorted landscape created 10,000 years ago when its ice straitjacket melted and there was a 20-mile long landslide along the east coast of Trotternish. This exposed the rugged peak of The Storr (719 m, 2359 ft), with the distinct 50-m pinnacle of The Old Man of Storr. The Old Man can be seen from the road, an anti-clockwise circuit gives the best views. Or hike up for a closer look: Walkhighlands suggest a 3-mile, 3-hour return hike. Signage at the car park indicates a two hour hike, but this is over-optimistic.
 See Uig for points further north in Trotternish, such as Kilt Rock, the Quiraing, and Museum of Island Life.
