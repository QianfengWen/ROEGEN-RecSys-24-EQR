Tarbert is a village in Argyll and Bute on the west coast of Scotland. An Tairbeart is a Gaelic term meaning "carry across", indicating an isthmus where small boats could be portaged from one body of water to another. It's therefore a common place-name in Highland Scotland: this one is specifically Tarbert on Loch Fyne above the Firth of Clyde, a two-mile portage to reach the West Loch opening into the Atlantic. In 2021 it had a population of 1150.

By bus[edit]
Citylink Bus 926 runs daily every 2-3 hours to Tarbert from Glasgow via Dumbarton, Tarbet on Loch Lomond — don't get off by mistake here! — Arrochar, Inveraray and Lochgilphead, taking 3 hours; one bus a day runs via Glasgow airport. They continue south via Kennacraig ferry terminal, Tayinloan (for ferry to Gigha) and Muasdale to Campbeltown, taking another hour.

By boat[edit]
Calmac car ferries sail four routes in this area: 

55.866-5.4031 Tarbert (east pier) to Portavadie on the Cowal peninsula, hourly daily 8AM-6PM, taking 25 min. Until end of March 2025, return fares are £20.30 per car, £6.60 per adult including driver and £3.30 per child aged 5-15. This scenic route cuts off a lot of road distance around Loch Fyne but doesn't save any time, as you first have to reach Bute by ferry from Wemyss Bay, then reach Cowal by ferry from Bute to Colintraive. There are bus links between the various ferries.
55.807-5.4822 Kennacraig (6 miles south of Tarbert) to Islay, either Port Ellen or Port Askaig (for Jura). There are five per day Apr-Oct and two Nov-Mar, taking two hours, see Islay#Get in for fares. Once or twice a week the ferry continues from Port Askaig to Colonsay and Oban then returns.
55.751-5.3883 Claonaig (10 miles south of Tarbert) to Lochranza on the Isle of Arran, April-Oct daily every 75 min, taking 30 min. See Isle of Arran#Get in for fares. In winter Claonaig is too exposed, so there's just one daily ferry to Lochranza sailing from Tarbert east pier, taking 90 min.
Tayinloan (15 miles south of Tarbert) to Gigha daily, hourly, taking 20 min. There's no other transport from that island so you have to come back to the mainland at Tayinloan.
Booking ahead is always wise, and at Kennacraig it's essential for caravans and motorhomes - these are not permitted to join the unbooked stand-by queue. You'd be sent away to make a booking, and if you couldn't sail that day, at least you'd have accommodation. This rule improves space in the queue but is more about capacity to shoehorn cars into odd spaces on the ferry, that couldn't possibly fit a caravan. The policy applies to most Calmac ports, but not Tarbert, Claonaig or Tayinloan which are just "turn up and go" routes. 
Also with a caravan or motorhome, in summer be prepared at check-in to show a pitch reservation at your destination, else you may be turned away. All the Scottish islands have a problem in summer with visitor vehicles camping illegally on the verges and passing places.

Get around[edit]

Go next[edit]
Ferries west take you to Islay, those east bring you to  Cowal.
See Skipness castle then take the ferry from Claonaig to Lochranza on the Isle of Arran. You can return to the mainland from Brodick on the other side of Arran.
A83 south follows the west coast; turn aside at Tayinloan to see Gigha. A scenic minor road follows the east coast from Claonaig to Carradale and Campbeltown, the obvious base for visiting the Mull of Kintyre. Campbeltown has a ferry in summer for foot passengers to Ballycastle in County Antrim, Northern Ireland.
A83 north leads to Lochgilphead, from where you either continue north to Oban, or return east via Inveraray and Loch Lomond to Glasgow.
