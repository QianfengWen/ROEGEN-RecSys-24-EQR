Quadra Island is the largest island in and the gateway to the Discovery Islands off the coast of British Columbia. The waters surrounding here are popular with boaters and kayakers, and viewing/kayaking with orcas has become a popular attraction. On land, there are hiking and biking trails and First Nations history to explore.


Understand[edit]
The Cape Mudge Reserve on the southern tip of the island is home to the We-wai-kai, one of the main bands comprising the Southern Kwakiutl (the other being the We-wai-kum based in Campbell River on Vancouver Island). Together they are known as the Laich-kwil-tach (historically known as the Euclataws or Yucultas, names more familiar to speakers of British Columbia English).
The Southern Kwakiutl (part of the larger Kwakwaka'wakw ethnic grouping) migrated into the northern Georgia Strait from Queen Charlotte Strait over two centuries ago, displacing and absorbing the Comox and Pentlatch peoples who formerly lived there.
