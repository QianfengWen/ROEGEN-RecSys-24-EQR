Understand[edit]
Weeping Rock
The original Magnesia is the Greek region of Thessaly. Its inhabitants moved here in 190 BC and founded the city of Magnesia ad Sipylum, specifying the mountain to distinguish it from their older settlement of Magnesia on the Maeander to the south. It was built over the ruins of the Hittite city of Tantalus, in a defensible position on the mountainside, with a good water supply and fertile plains around. The local soils have mineral ores, hence the name of magnesia or periclase (MgO / Mg(OH)2) and of magnesium the metal extracted from it. They also have natural lodestones, used for early compasses hence "magnet", but these are iron ores and magnesium is only weakly magnetic.
The city's foundation was marked by a nearby battle, when Scipio crushed the Seleucid forces of Antiochus III and brought the region under Roman control. Loyal cities were rewarded, and Magnesia remained important right through the Byzantine period — indeed it was for a time the capital-in-exile. It fell to the Ottomans in 1390: they embellished it and used it as a training ground for their princes to learn the art of imperial administration.
Magnesia sprawled out from its mountainside core onto the plain, and (like Izmir / Smyrna) was a cosmopolitan merchant city until the early 20th century, when inter-ethnic violence grew. After Turkey was defeated in the First World War, Greece invaded, but Turkey countered in what became the War of Independence. In 1922 retreating Greek forces carried out a scorched-earth policy, destroying the town almost completely. It was renamed Manisa in 1927 and is nowadays a modern industrial town, but its mosques have been restored.

Get around[edit]
The central sights are easy to walk around, as are those on the hill (such Weeping Rock) 1 km south of downtown.
Town buses ply the main streets. A dozen lines run out to the inter-city bus station, which on timetables is shown as Yeni (New) Garaj or Terminal.

38.61227.43374 Cumhuriyet Hamamı off Çarşı Bvd are traditional Turkish baths, built in 1574 and fed by mountain springs. They're still in use but dilapidated, and you'd probably feel more in need of a bath after visiting than before.

38.607127.43076 Manisa Castle is the fragmentary remains of the ancient city fortifications, an acropolis on the hillside. They've been wrecked and patched up so many times.
Ulu Cami (old or great mosque) 100 m north of the castle was built in 1367. It's closed for restoration in 2022.
Gülgün Hatun Mosque and Hamam have been restored on Cumludere Cd 100 m north of the viewpoint for Weeping Rock.
38.60527.4247 Weeping Rock (Ağlayan Kaya) is a rock formation south edge of town at the end of Cumludere Cd. It resembles a face, and groundwater seeps from its "eyes". In legend this is Niobe, who got uppity so the gods killed 14 of her children then turned her to stone. One child survived but turned green with the trauma, and was thus named Chloris.
38.56727.4558 Mount Sipylus or Spil (Spil Dağı) is the 1513 m mountain south of town. It's a popular weekend retreat for locals, with forests, wild tulips, herds of wild horses and beautiful scenery.

38.597927.49999 Cybele is the goddess carved into the cliff face along D250. She was an Anatolian deity, variously depicted as a plump earth-mother, a matronly civic protector, or a wild-child arriving in a lion-powered chariot with music and wine spilling out onto her weirdo companions. In the Roman era she was re-imported here as a goddess of Troy, but this particular carving is Hittite, say 1500 BC. She's 8 m tall but crumbling and her head has cleaved: "wow, what a party."
Do[edit]
Sisyphus totes the medicine ball at the gym
Turkish baths are available in several spots. The waters are not geothermal or sulphurous, yet you may need to hold your nose.
Football: Manisaspor were relegated in 2022 and now play soccer in TFF Second League, the country's third tier. Their home ground 19 May Stadium (capacity 16,600) is 2 km northeast of town centre along Akhisar Cd.
Fitness: in legend, Sisyphus was king of Ephyra and often killed guests and travellers to his palace. This earned him poor online reviews, especially from almighty Zeus, but Sisyphus reckoned he could outsmart the gods and on a couple of occasions did so. When he died and came to the underworld, he was assigned forever to roll a boulder up a mountain, whereupon it rolled right back. Scholars long described this as a futile, literally soul-destroying task, but Albert Camus (1913-1960) was the first to see the funny side. Sisyphus had invented fitness centres! Legend does not say which mountain, but this city is associated with Tantalus who was also given a futile punishment, see Drink. Appropriately, Manisa has a couple of dozen gyms: near town centre are Press Box, Best, UltFit Life Kadın, Victoria Gym, Ekol and Onur Park. None mention a pool.
Buy[edit]
Inside Sultan Mosque
Lots of small supermarkets, usually open daily 08:00-22:00. Migros is the main chain.
Banks and ATMs line 8 Eylül Cd, which runs east-west through town centre.
Eat[edit]
Eating places cluster around Konuk Cd, the spine of old town. They include Hatçe Ana Mantı Salonu, Menekşe Kasap Lokantası, Şafak Kebap[dead link], Beyoğlu, Taş Fabrika[dead link], Manisaspor Kebapçısı and Gülcemal.

Drink[edit]
In town centre are Sardes, Dergah and Afitap.
Tantalus is the mythical figure who gives his name to "tantalised": he was punished in the underworld by having water always just out of his reach, and low-hanging fruit that always eluded his grasp. He may have a historical basis as a Hittite ruler of Tantalus, the city which preceded Sipylus on the site of Manisa. The cafe-bar of his punishment was in a ravine beneath Hades. According to Iliad, if you dropped an anvil from heaven, it would take nine days to reach earth then another nine days to plummet into the ravine - imprecise directions, but they help narrow it down.

From the Gymnasium of Sardis
Sardis or Sart was the capital city of Lydia, and has extensive Graeco-Roman ruins. It's 62 km east of Manisa, and best done as a day-trip as it has little accommodation or other visitor amenities.
Izmir is the lively modern city on the coast, third largest in Turkey. It has few antiquities standing but several museums and other attractions.
Istanbul to Izmir is an itinerary across this region, with one branch swinging through Sardis and Manisa.
