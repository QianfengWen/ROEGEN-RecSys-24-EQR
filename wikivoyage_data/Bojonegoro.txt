Bojonegoro is a regency in East Java, about 100 km west of the provincial capital Surabaya. Visitors come mostly to do business related to the petroleum exploration


Understand[edit]
In modern times Bojonegoro has lived in the shadow of its much larger neighbour of Surabaya to the east. The traditional commodities here are tobacco and teak wood. However, the discovery of major new oil fields in 2005 has given Bojonegoro a real economic push and this traditionally poor area is in the midst of a mini-boom.
