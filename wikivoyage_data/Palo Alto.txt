Palo Alto is a bustling suburb in Santa Clara County south of the city of San Francisco. It is adjacent to Stanford University and home to hundreds of Silicon Valley technology companies, ranging from VMware and Hewlett-Packard to tiny startups operating in garages.


Understand[edit]
Palo Alto means tall tree in Spanish, and in this case refers to an aging redwood tree at the north end of the city appropriately named "El Palo Alto".  The 1080-year-old Coast Redwood, which stands 110 feet (34 m) high and has a base diameter of 90 inches (229 cm), marks a campsite for the Portola Expedition Party of 1769.
While Palo Alto is considered one of the more affluent areas of Northern California, East Palo Alto has a less posh reputation. East Palo Alto is known locally as one of the more dangerous cities in the Bay Area; it is not a town for random sightseeing.

Get in[edit]

0°0′0″N 0°0′0″EMap of Palo Alto

Accessible by train, bus or automobile from nearby San Francisco (about 25 miles/40 km) and San Jose (about 20 miles/32 km) airports. US 101 is the primary highway access, although I-280 also passes through the western edge of Palo Alto. Palo Alto Municipal Airport, which is a few miles from the center of the city, serves private aircraft.

By plane[edit]
SFO[edit]
The cheapest way to get to Palo Alto from San Francisco International Airport (SFO) is to take SamTrans bus KX or 292 to Hillsdale Station and transfer to route ECR for $2.25 + $2.25 = $5.50. A potentially quicker alternative is to take BART from SFO to Millbrae, and then take Caltrain from Millbrae to Palo Alto, which will cost $4.40 + $6 = $10.40. This is more of a hassle than it may seem, as Caltrain doesn't run as frequently as you might like. Check the schedules in advance see Bay Area public transit for more information.
UberPOOL pricing is highly variable, but can drop as low as $13-15 if multiple riders are heading in your direction.

SJC[edit]
From the San Jose International Airport (SJC), take the free shuttle bus #10 to get to the Santa Clara Caltrain station. From there take Caltrain to Palo Alto for $6, or VTA bus 522 or 22 to get to Palo Alto for $2.25.

By train[edit]
37.443006-122.1648781 Palo Alto Station on the Bay Area train route known as Caltrain has convenient access to downtown Palo Alto as well as bus connections, including free Marguerite shuttles to the Stanford University campus.
Caltrain also stops at 37.428889-122.1413892 California Avenue Station 2 miles (3 km) away, which is convenient for certain residential areas including some student housing. Service is less frequent than at Palo Alto Station.

By bus[edit]
Bus service runs through some major areas within the city. Routes are concentrated around El Camino Real and University Avenue. The Palo Alto Shuttle is free, and serves the otherwise unserved Embarcadero Road corridor, as well as the VA Hospital.

Get around[edit]
By bus[edit]
Stanford University runs free buses, called the Marguerite Shuttle, that transport passengers around the university and stop at the Palo Alto Caltrain station. It is free and open to the public.

By bike[edit]
Bike lanes are nearly everywhere and make riding convenient and safe. One of the most prominent lanes runs down Bryant Street and takes you from South Palo Alto to the downtown district, in North Palo Alto.

By car[edit]
Palo Alto traffic is not usually very congested, and parking is plentiful everywhere except the downtown area. Municipal parking is free and fairly well dispersed, but usually limited to 2 hours during the business day.

The 1,940-acre Baylands Preserve brings you to the edge of San Francisco Bay and is a component of the critical wetlands needed to preserve wildlife and marine life in the San Francisco region; it is a great place to hike, bike, watch birds and enjoy an afternoon.

37.44303-122.154662 Packard's Garage, 367 Addison Ave. This restored garage is a museum, California Registered and National Historic Landmark -- the site where Hewlett-Packard was founded and the "Birthplace of Silicon Valley." You can only see this from the street.

(updated Aug 2020)
37.41145-122.106725 Shockley's Laboratory, 391 San Antonio Rd. The other birthplace of Silicon Valley. The first transistors were made here. It was later an international grocery store, but is now vacant. William Shockley was a brilliant researcher, but a lousy manager. His team - which included Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce (co-founders of Intel), Eugene Kleiner (founder of Kleiner-Perkins), Jean Hoerni (founder Union Carbide Electronics), Sheldon Roberts, and others - left to start Fairchild Semiconductors, which lead to Intel and many other companies. It was the silicon transistor that created Silicon Valley. 
37.4275-122.16976 Stanford University (just outside Palo Alto). Offers cultural, athletic, natural and educational resources to Palo Alto visitors. For example, Outdoor Sculpture at Stanford University includes a very large collection of large scale works by Rodin in a garden immediately adjoining the Museum of Art, which is also home to a large collection of Rodin sculptures including one of his most famous works, Le Penseur (The Thinker). Look for Andy Goldsworthy's River of Stone a few steps from the museum's front entry. A guided outdoor sculpture tour is conducted the first Sunday of each month at 2PM, rain or shine. The tour lasts about 1½ hours, and begins at the entrance of the Main Quad (where The Oval meets Serra Street). The New Guinea Sculpture Garden, created by New Guinean tribes people, is a beautiful collection of wooden sculptures (next to Roble Dormitory, near the intersection of Lomita Drive and Santa Teresa Street).

"Crazy" Pete was a miner who lived in Coal Creek preserve and built a road -- named Crazy Pete's road -- in the 1800s. Most people don't know how Crazy Pete got his moniker. Free. 
37.44516-122.16263 The Stanford Theater, 221 University Ave. An old theater showing classics from the 1930s through the 1950s (not open year round). Sometimes features an organist playing live before screenings. 
 Stanford University Free Lectures and Events. Unless you are a student at Stanford, you won't get into classes for free at this acclaimed university, but there are some events and lectures open to the public each month. Parking can be hard to come by close to the venues of events, but the university runs a free shuttle bus, called the Marguerite, that picks up passengers at several locations including the Palo Alto Caltrain station and deposits them within easy walking distance of most event sites. The online schedule of lectures and events is updated frequently and usually lists at least five to seven upcoming free happenings. 
37.4083-122.1794 Stanford Cardinal. Stanford University sports, which boast more national team championships than any other NCAA Division I school—partly because it sponsors 42 varsity sports, the largest number of teams of any NCAA Division I member outside of the Ivy League. Most sports compete in the Pac-12 Conference through the 2023–24 school year, though a number of teams compete in other leagues, and a few sports compete outside the NCAA. The Cardinal will move to the Atlantic Coast Conference (despite the geographic oddity) in summer 2024. That said, the most nationally prominent sports are football and basketball (men's and women's), though the vast majority of its titles have come in non-revenue sports. The most notable venues are the football home of 37.434444-122.1611115 Stanford Stadium and 37.4296-122.16056 Maples Pavilion, home to basketball and volleyball. Prices vary by sport.

Stay safe[edit]
Palo Alto enjoys a very low crime rate, although visitors should take basic precautions against petty crime as with any college town or tourist hotspot. Palo Alto's downtown is home to a small number of homeless people and beggars, but they are much less visible than their counterparts in Berkeley.
The city of East Palo Alto and the unincorporated area of North Fair Oaks suffer from high crime rates and should be avoided or traversed quickly. In East Palo Alto, there are many perfectly decent shops and restaurants, but it is best to know where you are going and not to wander aimlessly.

Connect[edit]
Downtown Palo Alto, along University Avenue, has free Wi-Fi.

Apple Store, 451 University Avenue. All the computers are on Wi-Fi and free to use.
Palo Alto Cafe, 2675 Middlefield Road. Has a free Wi-Fi hotspot.
Palo Alto's Downtown Wi-Fi Internet Hotzone
The Stanford Marguerite Shuttle is free to use and has free Wi-Fi on board.

Neighboring destinations
Palo Alto is a good base of operations for visiting both the Silicon Valley and San Francisco, as it is halfway between that city and San Jose.
Trips to San Francisco on Caltrain leave frequently and stop just south of downtown.  The ride lasts about an hour, and Caltrain's rush-hour Baby Bullets travel the distance even faster. Check out Caltrain schedules, and make sure to buy a ticket before boarding.
To the west, the beautiful Coastal Range provides excellent biking, hiking, and other outdoor sports. Taking Page Mill Road due west will get you, eventually, to Highway 1 on the beautiful peninsula coast (although Highways 84 and 92 are preferable, especially the latter). And Santa Cruz is accessible from Highway 17, Skyline Boulevard (Highway 35 to Highway 9), or beautiful Highway 1.
If you're touring universities, the University of California, Berkeley is just across the bay. Take US-101 north through San Francisco and across the Bay Bridge to I-580 north, exiting University Avenue. Or by public transport, take the Stanford Marguerite shuttle to Caltrain and ride to Millbrae. At Millbrae, switch to BART and ride to Downtown Berkeley. (See 511.org for more).
