Noosa is one of the major draws of Queensland's Sunshine Coast.  Low rise resorts, upmarket shopping and dining line the sheltered beaches, waterways and parks.


Understand[edit]
The name Noosa is loosely applied to the following areas:

Noosa Heads is the resort area that contains Hastings Street and the main tourist area behind Hastings Street. The main beach fronts onto Hastings Street. At the end of Hastings Street are the Noosa Woods and Noosa Spit. At the eastern end of Hastings Street is the Noosa National Park.
Noosaville is alongside the river, a bit quieter.
Noosa Junction, the business area.
Sunshine Beach is to the south of Noosa Headlands.
The name Noosa comes from the local Aboriginal Kabi Kabi language for "shadow". It also has a strange claim to fame as the largest Finnish speaking community in the southern hemisphere.

The stunning unspoiled scenery that surrounds Noosa provides opportunities for a number of wildlife and eco tours. Most eco tours use a 4WD and provide a soft adventure that will give wonderful memories of your time in Noosa.
The hinterland behind Noosa has some wonderful villages and scenic spots. Most usually involve a trip to Montville and may continue south to the Glasshouse Mountains. Some of the tours combine the hinterland trip with visits to some of the main attractions that include the Ginger Factory at Yandina or the Big Pineapple. A popular one day tour is to the Australia Zoo which is offered as one tour or maybe in combination with a hinterland tour.

Cruises[edit]
Cruise along Noosa River to the Everglades. Tours travel the full length of the Noosa River taking in Lakes Cooroibah and Cootharaba and the Everglades which are part of the Great Sandy National Park. The dark still waters of the upper Noosa River provide stunning mirrored reflections. Most tours involve a BBQ or tea break at Harry’s Hut. All tours are led by enthusiastic guides who will bring to life all the varied wildlife and birds that will be seen. The tour is best done as a day trip but can be done as a half day tour.

Noosa Cruising Restaurant offers a river cruise with breakfast, lunch, or a sunset dinner on board. The food is cooked on board.
Do[edit]
Walking[edit]
There are some nice walks in the national park at Noosa Heads. Pick up a trail map from the information center in the park. Probably the best is to start along the coastal path (keep your eyes peeled for Koalas) and then cut back along Tanglewood Track. This will take about 2 hours. The National Park has several beaches at which to take a dip, however Alexandra Bay is only for experienced swimmers as there can be dangerous rips. Alexandra Beach is unofficially clothing optional.

The red and yellow flags which mark the safest and patrolled part of the beach, and you can check the beach conditions located on a small blackboard near the surf club.
Don't leave valuables unattended on the beach when swimming.  There are lockers located in front of the police station on Hastings St.
