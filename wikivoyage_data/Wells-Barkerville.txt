Wells (population 217 in 2016) is a small mining and tourist town in the Cariboo region of British Columbia.  Barkerville is a ghost town 8 km (5.0 mi) east of Wells. It was the main centre of Cariboo Gold Rush, and the northern terminus of the Cariboo Wagon Road.  


Understand[edit]
Barkerville was the main town of the Cariboo Gold Rush in and is preserved as a historic town. It is located on the north slope of the Cariboo Plateau near the Cariboo Mountains east of Quesnel. Most visitors to Barkerville stay or camp overnight in Wells, although it is also accessible from Quesnel (1 hr 5 min by car).

History[edit]
Barkerville ghost town
Barkerville is named after Billy Barker, who was among those who first struck gold at the location in 1861. His claim was the richest and the most famous.  Barkerville was built up almost overnight as word of Barker's strike spread, and by the mid-1860s it had a population of approximately 5,000.  By the turn of the century, the town was dying as the gold rush was over.  In 1957, the government of British Columbia decided that the town should be restored and operated as a tourist attraction.  The few remaining residents were either bought out or moved to nearby communities such as New Barkerville or Wells.  Barkerville is a national historic site.
Wells began as a company town, managed by Cariboo Gold Quartz Mine. Fred M. Wells, for whom the town was named, prospected in the area before finding the minerals that built the company.  At its heyday of the 1930s, Wells was home to 4,500 people, and in 1942 it had a greater population than Quesnel or Prince George.  The closure of the gold and other mineral mines in 1967 took its toll on the town, and most of the population moved away.

Climate[edit]
Barkerville is 700 m above Quesnel, so expect considerably colder weather in spring or autumn, and dress accordingly.
