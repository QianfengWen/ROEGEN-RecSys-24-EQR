Panguitch is a city of 1,700 people (2017) in the Canyon Country of Utah in the Western United States. Panguitch is a good jumping-off point for travelers who want to hike in the Grand Circle of U.S. national parks.


Understand[edit]

Panguitch is about 23 miles (37 km) from Bryce Canyon National Park and is within the Grand Circle.
The name Panguitch comes from a Southern Paiute word meaning “Big Fish,” likely named after the plentiful nearby lakes hosting rainbow trout year-round.

Climate[edit]
Panguitch has a cool semi-arid climate with summers featuring hot afternoons and cold mornings, and cold, dry winters. The high altitude and relatively high latitude means that mornings are cold throughout the year and freezing for most of it. Maxima, however, can be expected to top freezing on all but 14 afternoons during an average year, and the winters are so dry that snowfall is light. 
In a manner more akin to Arizona than northern Utah, most of the limited precipitation occurs during the July to October monsoon season, but Garfield County is usually too far north to receive the monsoon's full benefit.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The main road into the town is the north-south U.S. Route 89, which also provides connections in the direction of Zion National Park and Lake Powell to the south. 
When driving from Salt Lake City to Panguitch, take Interstate 15 south through Beaver, then take Route 20 east across a mountain range, and then drive down Route 89 south to Panguitch.

Get around[edit]
By car[edit]
