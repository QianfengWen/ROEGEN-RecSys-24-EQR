Bray is a small harbour town at the north edge of County Wicklow, bordering Dublin. It grew up rapidly from 1854 when the railway arrived, becoming a seaside resort and fashionable suburb of the city. It's now mainly a commuter town, with a population in 2022 of 33,500.


Understand[edit]
Although it's in Wicklow, Bray feels like part of Dublin city, similar to Dún Laoghaire north across the county boundary. The origin of its name is unknown: brí means "hill", like Scots "brae" or Celtic "bree". That origin isn't accepted but might as well stand until someone comes up with a better one.
Nor is this the home of the "Vicar of Bray": he's a fictional character in a 17th-century satirical song, from  Bray in Berkshire, England.

By train[edit]
Dart trains run every 10-20 min from Malahide and Howth through central Dublin (Connolly, Tara St and Pearse stations), the southern suburbs, Dún Laoghaire and Dalkey to Bray; every third train continues south to Greystones. Trains run 6AM-11:30PM taking 50 min from city centre to Bray. The entire line is within the Dublin "short hop zone", see Dublin#Get around for fares.
Five mainline trains per day from Dublin Connolly call at Bray heading for Wicklow Town, Arklow, Gorey, Wexford and Rosslare, which has ferries from Fishguard and Pembroke.
From Belfast, Drogheda or Sligo, change at Connolly for the Dart train. From most other cities (eg Galway, Limerick or Cork) trains run to Dublin Heuston, take the tram to Connolly or Bus 145 to Bray.
53.2045-6.11 Daly is the railway station, at the north end of the Esplanade. It's named for Edward Daly (1891-1916), executed for his part in the Easter Rising. The ticket office is only open for the morning rush M-F 7-10AM but there are machines.

By bus[edit]
Aircoach 702 runs every two hours between Dublin Airport, Bray and Greystones.
Dublin Bus 145 runs between Heuston Station and Bray every 15 min, taking an hour via city centre southside, Donnybrook and Cabinteely. It continues to Ballywaltrim.
Nitelink Bus 84n runs from D'Olier St in central Dublin to Bray and Greystones. It departs at midnight Friday and Saturday then at 2AM and 4AM.
St Kevin's Bus from Dublin picks up from Bray twice a day and goes via Roundwood to Glendalough monastic site, 40 min. At weekends it may run full from Dublin. Although it's designed for day trips (with four hours to explore Glendalough), you can take it as a point-to-point bus. 
Inter-city buses bypass Bray so you have to travel into central Dublin and come out again.

By road[edit]
The main coast highway is M11 / N11, dual carriageway throughout, which runs from the edge of Dublin south to Bray, Wicklow Town, Arklow, Gorey, Enniscorthy, Wexford and Rosslare. No surprise, it gets very busy in rush hour.
By contrast the east-west roads across the mountains are narrow, winding and scenic, and more likely to be congested on fine weekends. From the west eg Cork or Limerick, it's simpler to follow the motorway to M50 outside Dublin then join M11.

Get around[edit]
The Esplanade, looking towards Bray Head
Dublin Bus 84 runs north from Newcastle via Kilcoole, Greystones, Killruddery House, Bray, Bride's Glen (for Luas tram) and Cabinteely to Blackrock Dart station. It runs every 30 mins. You can also use the DART train between Bray and Greystones.
Bus 184 also runs by Killruddery House.
Bus 185 runs every 30 min between Bray, Enniskerry village and Powerscourt, taking 25 min.

See[edit]
53.208-6.11 Bray Harbour is a pleasant little marina at the outlet of the River Dargle. The mute swans, ducks and geese will mob anyone who looks like they have food to donate. The weary Martello Tower just south (nowadays private property) was built to defend the harbour against Napoleon but doesn't look like it could repel the Muppets. It's the only survivor of three such towers built here in 1804/5. One was by the Esplanade Hotel, the other was by Ravenswell Convent, but they both had soft foundations and succumbed to storm and sea circa 1870-80.
The Esplanade or Promenade stretches 1.5 km south from the harbour to Bray Head, lined with Victorian houses and 20th-century amusement arcades. The beach is shingle and sand: you can swim or paddle at the south end, but the north end suffers from erosion and pollution. See "Do" for walks continuing across Bray Head towards Greystones.
Main Street is mostly unremarkable low-rise; Holy Redeemer RC Church is here. At the south end of the street where it forks into Killarney Rd and Vevay Rd is the former Town Hall, a cod-Tudor confection. It was built in 1882/3 as a market hall but became municipal offices in the 1940s. Those have relocated to the Mermaid Civic Centre, and since 1997 the building has been a McDonald's fast food outlet.
Churches in town worth a look are Holy Redeemer (1792, RC) on Main Street, Christ Church on Church St (1863, C of I) and the Methodist church on Eglington Rd (1864). And see below for the Coptic church.
53.2108-6.13052 Festina Lente garden, Old Connaught Ave, Bray A98 F702, ☏ +353 1 272 0704. M-Sa 9AM-5PM, Su 11AM-5PM. This is primarily an equestrian centre, but many visitors come for the two acre restored Victorian walled garden. Wonderful double herbaceous borders and vegetable allotments.. Donation. (updated May 2024)
53.193-6.1153 Oldcourt Castle is the teetering stump of a 15th C tower house. It's becoming unsafe so you may find it fenced off.
53.19-6.0844 Bray Head rises to 241 m (791 ft) at the south end of the Esplanade. There are several paths up, closest being via the steps cut in the rock by the Esplanade, then up through a gully onto the headland. Raheen-a-Cluig on the north slope is the ruin of a 12th- to 13th-century church, partly restored in the 18th, while the concrete cross near the summit was erected in 1950. The Head falls to the sea in slate cliffs, which are rock-climbing routes. Watch for fulmars, rock doves, peregrines and other seabirds, plus if you're lucky the feral goats. These were domestic goats that went wild centuries ago; both males and females have horns and beards. The single-track railway towards Greystones and Wicklow teeters along the seaward slope, with ventilation shafts above its tunnels. Designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the line was costly to build and maintain, but it had to take this precarious route because the Earl of Meath wouldn't allow it to cross his Killruddery estate.
Bray Town Hall is now a McDonald's
53.1819-6.10395 Kilruddery House, Southern Cross Road, Kilruddery A98 W9F2, ☏ +353 1 286 3405, info@killruddery.com. May-Sep Tu-Su 9:30AM-6PM, house tours at noon, 1:30PM, 3PM. This vast pile has been the home of the Brabazons, Earls of Meath, for 350 years. The house was started in 1651 but extensively remodeled in neo-Tudor style in 1820-30, then scaled back in the 1960s. The formal garden (inspired by Versailles) was laid out in 1682, and is one of the few such gardens to survive the fashion for romantic naturalistic landscaping. The twin canals, known as the Long Ponds, are 152 m in length. House and grounds are often used as a film or TV location and may be booked out for weddings.. House & garden adult €15.50, garden alone €10.50.  (updated May 2024)
53.196-6.1416 Fassaroe Cross or St Valery's Cross is a High Cross probably from the 12th-century; similar crosses in the area look to have been carved by the same mason. It's 1.42 m tall, of granite with a "sash" of quartz. It originally stood at Ballyman some 1.6 km north but is now by the Berryfield Lane roundabout west of town just beyond the M11 junction.
53.144-6.0617 Greystones is the smaller resort south of Bray Head. It has a marina and a few pubs and cafes, but little to see: the ruins of Kindlestown Castle 1 km inland aren't worth seeking out. You'd probably only come for the sake of the coast walk from Bray then take the bus back, or vice versa.
53.155-6.158 Great Sugar Loaf is the 501 m (1644 ft) mountain south of Bray towards Kilmacanogue. It looks volcanic but it's Cambrian quartzite. That means firm walking trails: the usual ascent is from the south, starting at the Red Lane car park on L1031.
53.1849-6.186759 Powerscourt House and Gardens: see Enniskerry.

Attend a Coptic Orthodox service at St Mary and St Demiana Church at The Pines, off Herbert Rd. The exterior is nondescript and modern. Ireland's oldest Coptic church was opened in 1994, by the Pope himself. That of course was Pope Shenouda III, who oversaw a worldwide expansion of the Coptic church. It's the interior and the ceremony you come for, on Sunday 8:30-11:30AM. Coptic Orthodox liturgy has changed little in 2000 years and is sung in a language akin to ancient Egyptian that long predates Arabic, though it's transcribed into Greek.
Golf: lots. Bray GC and Greystones GC are in those towns, with Delgany GC west by M11. Druid's Glen is a resort hotel and championship golf course 10 km south of Bray, modelled on the course at Augusta Georgia. Three other courses lie just north of Bray within Dublin city limits.

 Harbour Bar, 1 Strand Road A98 D308 (Bray harbour), ☏ +353 1 286 2274. Daily noon-11:30PM. Famous pub so it's on the tourist circuit, but deservedly so - the Harbour scores highly for drink, food, service and ambiance. It's a knock-through of a row of fishermen's cottages, so it has a series of rooms each with their own character: main bar, snug, live lounge, good room, beer garden, and upstairs. Often has live music, dog-friendly. (updated May 2024)
