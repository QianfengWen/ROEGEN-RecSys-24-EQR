Irkutsk[dead link] (Russian: Ирку́тск; eer-KOOTSK) is capital of the Russian province of Irkutsk Oblast in Eastern Siberia. The historic centre of Irkutsk is included on UNESCO's tentative list of World Heritage Sites.


Understand[edit]
Irkutsk was founded in 1661 as a settlement for trading gold and furs. It was connected to Europe via a road constructed in 1760.
After the Decemberist Revolt of 1825, many Russian artists, officers, and nobles were sent into exile to Siberia for their part in the revolt against Tsar Nicholas I and in the late 1800s, 30% of the population of the city were exiles. Irkutsk became the major centre of intellectual and social life for these exiles, and much of the city's cultural heritage is a result of these exiles. Many of their wooden houses, adorned with ornate, hand-carved decorations, survive today in stark contrast with the surrounding Soviet apartment blocks. Around 1900, the city was nicknamed the "Paris of Siberia" due to its wide streets and ornate, continental architecture, but travellers today will find little resemblance with Paris.
During the civil war that broke out after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917-1922, Irkutsk became the site of many furious, bloody clashes between the "Whites" and the "Reds" (aka Bolsheviks). A number of city landmarks remain from that era. In 1920, Kolchak, the once-feared commander of the largest contingent of anti-Bolshevik forces, was executed in Irkutsk, effectively destroying the anti-Bolshevik resistance.
Today, Irkutsk is the 6th largest city in Siberia, with a growing population of more than 590,000 people. It's home to several universities and a major branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, due to its proximity to Lake Baikal.

Climate[edit]
In July, the average temperature is 18°C (64°F) with a bit of rain, but by January, the temperature plunges in typically Siberian fashion to -19°C (-2°F). Early September finds the local foliage at its finest.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
52.267222104.3947221 International Airport Irkutsk (IKT  IATA) (is 5km east of the city center.). Direct flights operate from Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Ulan Ude, Novosibirsk, Vladivostok, Yakutsk, and several other Russian cities. International flights operate from Ulaanbaatar, Osh, Seoul, Bangkok, Beijing, and Tashkent.   
Buses, trams, and minibuses run frequently between the airport and Kirov Square (near the Angara Hotel) and other points in the historical center. A trip via public transport costs approximately 30 руб. Taxi services are available via mobile application or phone, Yandex and Maxim are the most common. I-Way transfers taxi service may be the choice for business travellers and guests (booking via website or app in advance). Private drivers offer their services at the airport but you must be careful, there is some risk of fraud.

By train[edit]
Irkutsk train station
52.283056104.2597221 [dead link] Irkutsk-Passenger Railway Station (Иркутск-Пассажирский), Ul. Chelnokova, Tereshkovoi (Улицам Челнокова, Терешковой) (Minibuses: № 6, 16, 20, 72, 77, 80, 80к 116; Tram 1, 2, 4а;). Suburban lines to Bajkalsk, Bolshoy Lug, Voennyi Gorodok, Malta, Polovyna, Usolie Siberskoye, Cheremkhovo, Vydrino, Glubokaya, Zyma, Half, Kaya, Podkamennaya, Sludyanka. 
Most travellers arrive in Irkutsk via the Trans-Siberian Railway. Irkutsk is about halfway between Moscow and the two eastern terminus cities, Vladivostok and Beijing, making it a good place to break the trip, if only to stretch your legs and buy provisions. The Baikal-Amur Mainline, connecting with more northerly cities, also runs nearby.
Apart from Moscow there are also direct carriages from most cities in Russia such as Saint Petersburg (86 hours), as well as from Minsk (94 hours) and Warsaw (113 hours).
Other popular destinations include Vladivostok, Beijing, Ulaanbaatar, Novosibirsk, Chelyabinsk, Chita, Khabarovsk, Severobaykalsk, Ulan-Ude, Neryungri, Blagoveshchensk, Ust-Ilimsk, Novokuznetsk, Penza, Kislovodsk and Abakan.
Be wary of the taxi-drivers at the station if arriving on a late-night train. A taxi ride to the centre of town should only cost 200-300 руб. Unlicensed taxis will overcharge you. If there is a disagreement, ask your hostel/hotel owner to come to the taxi and arrange the correct fare.

By car[edit]
Irkutsk is not only on the railway across Russia, but also on the 11,000 km Trans-Siberian Highway from St. Petersburg to Vladivostok.

By foot[edit]
The historical center of Irkutsk is relatively compact and walkable. Traffic congestion is not bad for a city of nearly 600,000 people.

By public transport[edit]
For those who want to save time or travel between one side of the river and the other, the public transit system is a good option. Knowing at least how to read the signs on the buses and bus stops is helpful, and on the minibuses, one must call out to the driver to request a stop.  Oddly enough, the names of major bus stops are posted on kiosk roofs parallel to the road so that the names are not often visible from inside the bus. Bus and minibus ("marshrutka") fare is usually 15 руб. Local etiquette is to pay the driver when exiting the bus and trolley (therefore you can exit it only through the front door). In trams tickets should be purchased from driver, then stamped in the machine on board.
A map of tram lines and a map of trolleybus lines are available.
