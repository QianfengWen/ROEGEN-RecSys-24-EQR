Onitsha is a city of 1.5 million people (2021) in Anambra State in Southeast Nigeria. Onitsha can claim two distinctions. First, it is said to have the largest market in Africa in terms of volume of goods and geographical size. And, secondly, in a more sordid sense, it was ranked number one most polluted city in the world by WHO in 2016.


Understand[edit]
The city has had a somewhat tumultuous past. From the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries, it was developed as a centre of trade and dissemination of Christian mission work by the British. Following Nigerian independence though, Onitsha fared front and centre and lay decimated by collateral damage during the Nigerian-Biafran war of 1967-1971. Since then, oil ventures have brought in a stream of revenue but along with it swaths of people seeking a piece of that prize, resulting in overcrowding, lawlessness, and zoning unsightliness. 
Onitsha is also distinguished by being a centre of Nollywood film distribution and the navigable endpoint for most shipping up the Niger River.

Get in[edit]
Though some 450 km away, it is fairly directly connected to Lagos by road. In fact, the Onitsha Bridge is one of the few bridges linking eastern and western Nigeria. There is also some limited regional transit by air available through 6.20466.66321 Asaba International Airport (ABB IATA), ☏ +234 7039119444. (updated Aug 2020) nearby.

By bus[edit]
Through the Niger Bridge (one of the most popular bridges in Nigeria, linking the Western and the Eastern region), you can get to Onitsha by road. There are different transportation companies that serve Onitsha, including GUO (Mmduabuchukwu), Peace, GIGM (God is Good motors), Ever Green, EZEWATA, The Young Shall Grow and many others. Starting from ₦3000 you can get a vehicle into the city, but that depends on where you are coming from.
