Ross Bridge
Ross is a small historic town in the centre of the Tasmanian Midlands, 120 km north of Hobart and 80 km south of Launceston. Ross was first settled in 1821 as a garrison town for soldiers, as a coaching stop on the Midlands Highway and as a market town. It's especially popular with Japanese travellers, as the bakery was the template for a Japanese comic series ("Kiki's bakery").


Understand[edit]
Founded in 1812, it is one of the oldest towns in Tasmania and still has many buildings from that period. Ross gained importance in the 19th century because of its location on Tasmania's most important road and because of its bridge over the Macquarie River (which has since been bypassed since the late 20th century). However, Ross remained a small town and has been able to preserve its historical setting.

The historic town is 120 km north of Hobart, and 78 km south of Launceston. It's a short detour of the Midland Highway (Hwy 1) via Roseneath Rd (northbound) and Chiswick Road (southbound).
