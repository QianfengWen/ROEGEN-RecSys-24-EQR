Huntsville
Huntsville, a town with a population of about 21,100 (2021), is the largest community in the Muskoka District of Ontario, Canada, making it the hub for many vacations and outdoor adventures in cottage country.
The town, at the junction of Highway 11 and Highway 60, is west of Algonquin Provincial Park. Access to the park is via Highway 60, between Huntsville and Maynooth.


Understand[edit]
Huntsville was named after Captain George Hunt. He arrived in 1869 and settled on the east side of the Muskoka River.
The town plays host to thousands of tourists in the summer season, mostly from Toronto and surrounding cities. Huntsville's numerous lakes and rolling hills make it a beautiful and ideal summer destination.
In 2010, Huntsville hosted the 36th G8 Summit, attracting much international attention.

Climate[edit]
Huntsville has warm, humid summers and cold winters. The city experiences four distinct seasons, with considerable variance in day to day temperature, particularly during the colder weather season. Huntsville is in the snowbelt region of Central Ontario, near the Great Lakes, so experiences snowy winters. The city has comfortable summer temperatures and occasional heatwaves accompanied by high humidity and active thunderstorm weather. Huntsville and the Muskoka region have the highest annual precipitation of any region in Ontario.
