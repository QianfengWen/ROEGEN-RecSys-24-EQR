Eskdale Green is a small village in Cumbria at one end of the Eskdale Valley. The hamlet of Boot has an old corn mill in the heart but wander south away from the mill to find the little old church by the river. The only sounds to be heard are the water, the birds and probably the odd sheep. To the north is Wast Water and the highest lake district peaks of Scarfell and Scarfell Pike.
