Karlovy Vary (also known as Karlsbad, its German name or Carlsbad, its English name) is a historic spa town in West Bohemia, in the western Czech Republic. It's famous for its mineral springs and its gorgeous Belle Epoque architecture.

Karlovy Vary

Understand[edit]
Karlovy Vary, meaning "Charles' Bath", was named after Charles IV, King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor, who founded the city in 1370. It is  famous for its hot springs and its colorful and whimsical architecture.  For these reasons, it was a popular tourist destination starting in the 18th century with guests including Tsar Peter the Great, Emperor Franz Josef I, Beethoven, Goethe, Wagner, Brahms, Leo Tolstoy, and Karl Marx. Tourism ground to a halt during World War I and the city never fully regained its former glory. After World War II, the largely German-speaking city was cleared of its inhabitants and replaced with Czech settlers. Czech remains the major language today but the signs of German culture and heritage are still very evident. The three spa towns in West Bohemia – Karlovy Vary, Mariánské Lázně and Františkovy Lázně – are known as the West Bohemian Spa Triangle, and all three are part of the "Great Spa Towns of Europe" UNESCO world heritage site shared with eight other cities around the continent.
The town, along with Prague, was the filming location of many scenes identified as being in Montenegro in the 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale.

Watch[edit]
 Last Holiday. Last Holiday is a 2006 film starring Queen Latifah, who portrays Georgia Byrd, a New Orleans department store employee. Believing that she is dying, Georgia quits her job and decides to blow her savings. She flies off to Karlovy Vary for Christmas and stays at the Grandhotel Pupp, enjoying the luxurious hotel's presidential suite, gourmet restaurant, and spa. She treats herself to a new designer wardrobe in a fashionable boutique. While in town, Georgia tries snowboarding and BASE jumping.   (updated Mar 2021)

Karlovy Vary is well connected to the regional and long-distance train network. The vast majority of trains in Karlovy Vary Region are modern and very comfortable. Also, some of the railways are quite scenic. When planning your journey, use journey planner IDOS. For more details see Rail travel in the Czech Republic.

Prague: 3 hr 10 min, long-distance Rx trains on line  R5  leave Prague Main Train Station every 2 hours, 7 times a day, trains on this route are slower than buses, however, you can experience the diverse character of the Czech Republic: industrial areas in North Bohemia and scenic sections like Lovosice - Ústí nad Labem or Kadaň - Karlovy Vary. SuperAction ticket costs from 159 Kč, Ordinary ticket costs 331 Kč.
Nuremberg: 2 hr 40 min, 1 change, regional RE trains on line  R29  depart from Nuremberg Main Train Station every 2 hours, in Cheb you have to change to long-distance Rx train on line  R5 , 5 times a day. First Minute Europe ticket costs from 235 Kč, Basic international fare ticket costs 981 Kč.

Also, regional trains operate on railway lines nr. 140 (Klášterec n/O - Karlovy Vary - Cheb), 141 (Merklín - Karlovy Vary), 142 (Johanngeorgenstadt - Karlovy Vary) and 149 (Mariánské Lázně - Karlovy Vary). Railway routes to Johanngeorgenstadt and Mariánské Lázně are pretty scenic as line 142 leads through Ore Mountains and line 149 through Slavkov Forest.
All long-distance and most regional trains arrive at 50.23527812.8669441 Karlovy Vary Station (north of the city centre, bus stop Horní nádraží  1  13 ).  , which offers modern facilities. Although, all trains from Mariánské Lázně and some other regional trains terminate at 50.22972212.8641672 Karlovy Vary Lower Station (Bus stop Dolní nádraží - Terminál  18  or Dolní nádraží  3  6  18  23 ).  This station is on the western edge of the city centre next to the intercity bus station.

By plane[edit]
50.20305612.9153 Karlovy Vary Airport (KLV  IATA). This airport only serves a very few scheduled international connections and due to its closeness to Prague it has no domestic services.   
If you're arriving from a place not connected to KLV, it will likely make more sense to fly into Prague (PRG IATA). Other airports in reasonable geographic proximity include Nuremberg (NUE IATA), Leipzig/Halle (LEJ IATA) and Dresden (DRS IATA). Out of all of these, Prague offers the most comprehensive selection of destinations, and is the hub of Czech flag carrier Czech Airlines. In 2021 Czech Airlines went bankrupt and downsized, so there's a good chance that Czech Airlines won't be the best option for getting into the Czech Republic.

Get around[edit]
