Arroyo is a small seaside town and municipality of Puerto Rico by the Caribbean Sea immediately to the east of Guayama. The small town has beaches, history and seafood to offer to its visitors.


Understand[edit]
Plaza de Recreo
Samuel Morse established the telegraph in the area in 1852, as he had family who lived nearby at Hacienda Concordia in Guayama. The Town of Arroyo, meaning 'creek' in Spanish, was founded in 1855. The telegraph line was inaugurated in 1859 in a ceremony celebrated by an American and Spanish delegation. The town today has a monument dedicated to Samuel Morse who is considered an important figure in the history of the municipality.
The town hosts two popular festivals: Fiesta Negra in March which celebrates the town's African heritage, and Festival del Pescado (Arroyo Fish Festival) celebrating the town's fishing industry and heritage.
