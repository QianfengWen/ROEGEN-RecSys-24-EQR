Understand[edit]
Borjomi from the cable car
Borjomi is a famous resort town, popular for its distinctive mineral water. The water from the well here is several times stronger than the Borjomi water you can buy in the shops. Borjomi has many hotels and was very popular in soviet times, of which you will still find many buildings in the city. Above the centre of the city there lies a plateau with a ferris wheel and further hotels, providing a great view over the region and mountains. Furthermore, the nearby Borjomi Kharagauli National Park is the largest in Georgia and a popular hiking destination.

From 41.84167143.3852562 Borjomi Parki, the main station in the centre of town, trains leave to Tbilisi at 07:05 and 16:45 (2 lari). From Tbilisi, trains to Borjomi leave at 06:40 and 16:15. The journey takes between 4 and 5 hours.
From 41.84774343.4098493 Borjomi Freight, the 2nd station 2.5 km east of the centre, the slow train to Bakuriani leaves at 07:15 and 10:55. The train back leaves Bakuriani at 10:00 and 14:15. The train takes 3 hours, so if you make a day trip it's quicker to take the bus back to Borjomi. The train has been refurbished and all seats are now 2 lari which you pay during the train ride. To reach this station, take a taxi (3 lari) or the city bus (0.20 lari), or any bus (not marshrutka) that goes east to any of the next villages. It is possible to walk: cross the river at Borjomi Parki station, turn right, and then walk about 1.8 km (to Tori Street). Cross the river again, and the station is to your left. There are no facilities at the station, but there is a small supermarket very close.
Get around[edit]

Otherwise, there is a city bus going along the main road through Borjomi for 0.20 lari to accomplish longer distances, e.g. to the Borjomi Freight railway station (see below).
City bus no. 1 goes from Borjomi‘s central square all the way to Likani and back. It doesn’t leave from where the other city busses leave from but from a bus stop on the other side of the road about 100 m north. 
City bus no. 3 goes from Borjomi’s city bus station at the small outdoor market all the way north into Kvibisi and finds it final stop there in its small center. 
City bus no. 4 goes from Borjomi’s city bus station at the small outdoor market towards the south into Atskuri (at least that’s what I could read from its LED destination panel, needs confirmation).

First part of park contains park amusements and cafes. The second part of the park is great for a walk, and reveals a high waterfall including sculpture, great for pictures. 2 lari. 
41.81604543.4037532 Natural Hot Pools (Tsar Sulphur Pools) (about 2.8 km from the central park entrance; if you have a car, you can enter through the road on the plateau to the east; from the road a track leads down to the pools). A set of three natural hot pool that's popular with locals for a picnic. This was one pool before, which was quite hot. Nowadays, it has been converted to three pools, which are semi-warm and unfortunately not hot enough to heat you up sufficiently. Some local business men try to make money off its remote location, and running an expensive "taxi service" to bring you back to the park entrance. Don't give em a reason. 5 lari, but at night there might not be anyone there. 
41.8360743.390543 Borjomi Cable Car. Near the entrance of the central park there is an option to use cable car to get up to plateau, where there's a Ferris wheel. (updated May 2017)
41.8470243.37924 Cross Mount walk. For an excellent view of the city and the plateau. Get in at the 41.8452343.385361 sharp turn in the woods (830 m above sea level) of the eastern extension of Pirosmani Street. From there go in the small road and follow the marker. You should reach the top at 1140 m above sea level after 30-60 minutes with a great view if you are lucky and there is no rain or fog. Afterwards, following the path further and down again, after 30-45 min you will reach the ruins of 41.8413543.376285 Gogia Fortress. From there follow the small track (north)east and exit 41.8430543.3782 near the west end of Pirosmani Street, which is much harder to find, so better walk a proposed, east to west. 
Further Walks around the city – There are nice, excellently sign-posted walks from the centre worth doing. One goes to the natural pools and returns via the plateau. The second part is free from the crowd and the vendors present in the park (~3 hr). The other circular path climbs up to the ruins of a tower and further up to the top of Cross Mountain across from the city park. It is quite a climb, but in pleasant forest and with a great view (~2 hr).
Borjomi Kharagauli National Park[edit]
41.88343.1395 Borjomi Kharagauli National Park.   (updated Jun 2020)
This park is Georgia's largest, covering about 8% of the country's territory. Its diversity of physical, geographical and especially climatic conditions set the stage for a wide variety of flora and fauna. Apart from the largely untouched nature of Borjomi-Kharagauli, there are numerous cultural monuments. In particular, there are two easily accessible churches, built in 9th century. There are 8 tourist trails in the national park. They vary in length, duration and complexity. Open from April until October.
Plan your trip by going to the administration of the office, which is a bit to the west of Borjomi (23 Meskheti st.), and get a free access permission and a map of the area with all the routes and shelters as well. There are well-marked hikes of 1, 2 or 3 days, through forests and meadows.
If you want to take a hike in the national park, get enough supplies, water, and some basic sleeping gear with you, as the cabins are very basic. You can rent sleeping bags for 5 lari a day, but no mattresses, and the shelter beds are wooden planks. You pay a small fee for staying in the shelter (10 lari) or camping (5 lari). The permit to the park is free, but make sure to have it on you since rangers might ask for it.
It is also possible to take a 1-day hike from Borjomi to Qvabiskhevi (or the other way around) and then hitchhike, take a local bus or taxi back to Borjomi. Or do multiple day hikes. That way you can even get to go to the higher parts (up to 2,600 m).
