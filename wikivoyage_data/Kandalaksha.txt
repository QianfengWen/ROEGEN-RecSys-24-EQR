Kandalaksha [dead link] (Russian: Кандала́кша,) is a city in Murmansk Oblast, northern Russia. It is one of the most active and famous tourist locations in the Murmansk region.


Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
The city is along the Murman Railway from Saint Petersburg to Murmansk, with several connections each day in both directions. Trains from Saint Petersburg and Moscow are daily but there is no train connection to Arkhangelsk. On some trains there are carriages coming all the way from Brest, Minsk and Pskov. However be prepared that most long-distance trains arrive in the middle of the night. There are also once a day regional trains from Apatity, Loukhi and the coal mining town of Kovdor. 67.16008832.4188791 Kandalaksha railway station is on Murmanskaya ulitsa 1, a few blocks north of the city centre.

By bus and car[edit]
The Russian federal highway M18, also known as Kola Highway, passes through. A much less used gravel road connects with Salla in Finland (border station Kelloselkä). There is a twice-weekly bus service along this road with departure from Rovaniemi early afternoon. The bus makes a stop-over in Kemijärvi and the border station Salla and then arrives at Kandalaksha at 22:00.
