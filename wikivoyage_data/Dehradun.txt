Dehradun is at an altitude of 2,200 ft in the Doon Valley between two of the most important rivers in India, the Ganges and Yamuna. It offers beautiful scenery and a moderate (but very rainy) climate in summer, and so is an ideal place to relax and escape the heat of the plains below. The town also serves as a convenient base for visiting the area's many tourist sites.

By bus[edit]
30.2874677.997953 ISBT. The bus station is located about 5–6 km from the centre of the town. To arrive from Delhi, trains are more convenient. (updated Aug 2023)
In case you are interchanging in Dehradun during the day, it sometimes makes sense to get off before the bus turn into the station, which is where many buses ply not going into the station or coming out somewhere else, e.g. going to Rishikesh. Ask the driver of your current bus, where to catch the onward bus.
From ISBT, Kashmere Gate in Old Delhi, Delux, Volvo, Semi-deluxe and ordinary Uttarakhand State buses depart hourly. There is also an overnight deluxe A/C service run by Uttarakhand Tourism. It is a 6–7-hr journey from Delhi.

By car[edit]
The trip from Delhi is in principle a five-hour drive, but unless departing very early in the morning, traffic greatly lengthens the journey. The town is on the narrow, two-lane NH 72A (Chhutmalpur to Dehradun). The road has slow vehicles at harvest times and pilgrims walking on the road in late July and early August.
Car rental companies provide cars to Dehradun from New Delhi Airport & New Delhi Railway station.

Get around[edit]
30°18′59″N 78°1′56″EMap of Dehradun
By bus[edit]
Dehradun has a city bus service run by private owners under STA. The destinations are written in Hindi above the windshield. Generally, however, the buses are crowded, so it is better to use other means of transport.

By auto rickshaw[edit]
Auto rickshaws are plentiful in the downtown area. They are not metered, but instead use a fixed rate system. However, as the rate is often not prominently displayed, it is advisable to have some idea of the cost to your destination before taking an auto rickshaw. Otherwise, you are very likely to be charged well over the odds.

By shared (fixed-route) autorickshaws[edit]
The cheapest way to get around town is via the ubiquitous blue three wheelers called Vikrams. These vehicles are often crammed, with capacity for 8 cramped passengers in the back. The Vikrams are numbered according to their routes through the city. Fare is ₹3-₹5.

1 - Rajpur Road: begins at Astley Road and travels North to the Rajpur-Mussoorie Road Fork.
2 - Sahastradhara/Raipur: begins at Survey Chowk, proceeds eastward to Sahastradhara Crossing, before splitting towards the North (Sahastradhara Road) or East  (Raipur Road) depending on the Autorickshaw.
3 - Dharampur, Rispana Bridge: begins at Survey Chowk, proceeds to Haridwar Road and Dharampur, before proceeding through the Nehru Colony to Rispana Bridge.
4 - Doiwala: begins at Rispana Bridge and proceeds to Doiwala.
5 - Majra/ISBT: begins at Astley Hall, proceeds South to Majra and the Interstate Bus Terminus.
6 - Kaulagarh Road: begins at Connaught Place, goes Northwest up Kaulagarh Road.
7 - Chakrata Road: begins at Connaught Place, goes West on Chakrata Road.
8 - Kanwali/Kaonli Road: begins at Astley Hall, proceeds South to Saharanpur Chowk, before going West on Kanwali/Kaonli Road towards Balliwala. The last stop on      this route varies between Seemadwar/Indranagar, Anurag Nursery or Vasant Vihar Chowk.
10 - Premnagar: very infrequent, goes West to Premnagar via Kaonli Road.
On foot[edit]
The best way to explore the town is on foot, since it is surprisingly compact. Finding your way around is not that difficult as it may seem at first glance. Rajpur Road is the main avenue and Chakrata Road is also quite an important street. They both intersect at the Clock Tower Roundabout. Walking across town can take up to 30 minutes.

By car or taxi[edit]
You can easily book a taxi in Dehradun from many local tour & travel agents operating. A car rental from good travel company can be opted for local & outstation journey. You can easily reach Dehradun by hiring online cabs from Uber & Ola app if taxi is available because many times cab is not available on their app.
