Ronda is a town in Malaga in Spain. Set in and around a deep gorge spanned by an impressive bridge, the relaxing atmosphere here is a great break from some of the more tourist-ridden places on the south coast of Spain, however it can still be packed with day-trippers from the Costa del Sol, especially during the peak summer months.


Understand[edit]
Ronda was first settled by the early Celts, and later inhabited by Phoenicians, Greeks, and Romans. The Moors left an indelible imprint in the city, which only fell to the Christian reconquista in 1485. In more modern times, the town has hosted a number of well-known writers, including Ernest Hemingway, Orson Welles, James Joyce, and the German poet Rainer Maria Rilke.
Ronda is divided into three neighbourhoods: the more modern Mercadillo, with the bus and train stations and other services; La Ciudad, the old Moorish quarter which has been largely preserved; and the Barrio de San Francisco. The town makes a good base for outdoor pursuits, including hiking, canoeing and river kayaking, and mountain biking.

At the highest point is a monument to the German poet Rainer Maria Rilke, in the form of a stone memorial with a stylized pen nib.
For a scenic route from Seville, head south on A-376 to Utrera, and then take A-375 to Puerta Serrana, and A-384/374 further on to Ronda.
From Jerez de la Frontera, take A-382 west to Arcos de la Frontera, continue on A-384 past the exit to Puerta Serrana and Seville, and pick up A-374 to Ronda.

Get around[edit]
Ronda is a small town, both easily and best navigated on foot.
While driving in by car may be interesting - once within Ronda - park it!  Ronda is difficult to navigate by car, especially in the older quarters.  In some parts - non-resident cars aren't even allowed to use the streets!  There are two reasonably convenient public car parks in the Mercadillo: an underground garage beneath the 36.74302-5.165762 Plaza del Socorro; and another 36.74504-5.168513 car park on Avenida Poeta Rilke, north of the bull ring.

See[edit]
Puente Nuevo
36.740633-5.1658531 Puente Nuevo. This large and incredible bridge over the Tajo gorge, finished in 1793, is Ronda's principal attraction. The bridge is 70 m long and 98 m high, equivalent to a 30-floor building, and connects the quarter of La Ciudad with the Mercadillo. It was built following the collapse of an earlier bridge from 1735; this bridge had a single arch of 35m but collapsed six years after construction, killing 50 people. There are beautiful views from here of the Sierra de Grazalema to the west. A small museum is inside.   
Mercadillo[edit]

The oldest and one of the most highly regarded of Spain's bull rings, built in 1785 in the neoclassical style. This is considered to be the cradle of modern Spanish bullfighting, where Pedro Romero (1754-1839) developed a new style of fighting bulls on foot (and not from horseback as had been done previously); he also was the first to begin using a red cloth. Romero retired after he had killed 5000 bulls and remained uninjured. His son and grandson carried on the tradition. €6.50, €8 (with audioguide).   
Also located inside is a bullfighting museum.

One of the most popular routes is Route 3 (SL-A 38), which descends to the bottom of the Tajo Gorge passing by several excellent viewpoints of the Puente Nuevo.

Buy[edit]
The pedestrian shopping street Carretera Espinel
Ronda is noted for distinctive white enamelled ceramic, which is used for everyday domestic ware. There are plenty of ATMs dotted about the Mercadillo, or the main commercial district.

 Carretera Espinel (Calle la Bola). The main pedestrian shopping street, stretching from the bullring to Avenida Málaga. Shops here cater not only to tourists but also the town's inhabitants, and you can find everything here to meet your daily needs for reasonable prices. (Trivia: "La bola" means "ball" in Spanish; the street earned its nickname when, after a heavy snowfall, a group of citizens rolled a large snowball down its slope.) 
Eat[edit]
Avoid the restaurants in the tourist area during the day, as they are overpriced and often only full of other tourists! Look for smaller cafes and bars. 
A quick breakfast usually consists of toast (pan tostada) and coffee (cafe con leche – coffee with milk; be sure to add the pack of sugar always served with it for a real treat.) 
Look for bakeries (pastelerias), as Spain has some of the finest pastries around.

Any bar will be able to make you a sandwich (bocadillo) with your choice of ham, cheese, or tomato.
