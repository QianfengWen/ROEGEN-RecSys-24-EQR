N'Djamena (pron. en-jah-may-nah) is the capital of Chad. It is by far the country's largest city, with a population of 1 million people. It lies directly on the border of Cameroon, and is on the confluence of the Chari and Logone rivers. The city has been at the centre of many heated rebellions and revolts, and in February 2008 was entered by rebel troops.


Get in[edit]
There are limited flights from non-African cities such as Paris (by Air France) and Istanbul. Destinations in Africa include Johannesburg, Addis Ababa, Tripoli, Cairo, Cotonou, Bangui, Lagos, Casablanca via Niamey and Khartoum. Historically, the main entry to the city was by boat up the Chari and Logone rivers, but today this is rarely done. The city has no railway links.
The rudimentary 12.12794115.0324291 N'Djamena International Airport is located slightly north of city centre.

Get around[edit]
Taxis[edit]
During the day, taxis charge 3,000 CFA. At night, taxi fares increase to 5,000 CFA. Agree on the price before you step in the car. Pay when you reach the your destination. It's your responsibility to have exact change.

Moto-Taxis[edit]
Fares range from 250 CFA to 1,000 CFA, depending on the distance. Do negotiate. Only take moto-taxis that are from official taxi stations, usually on the corners of major intersections. 12°6′18″N 15°3′22″EMap of N'Djamena

Bridge in Chad
As a Muslim city, there are many mosques to see in the city, as well as a cathedral and the presidential palace. And do not forget the views across the river. Sunset can be quite spectacular.

Do[edit]
Go shopping in the local markets, even if only for an afternoon snack, that are scattered throughout the city. This lets you experience the everyday life and culture of Chad, and also helps contributes to the country's poor economy.

Go next[edit]
Gaoui is a pretty village lying 10 km north east of N'Djamena. It is said to have been the capital of the Sao civilisation and is now known for its traditional architecture and pottery manufacture. It is also home to a museum.
N'Djamena has the only international airport in Chad. Leaving the main city may be dangerous, as high levels of civil unrest are being experienced in the country. Travelling to the Tibesti Mountains is not safe, either, as this is a militarily sensitive zone. As in all third world countries, stay safe and have caution in your actions.
