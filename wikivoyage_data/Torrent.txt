Torre del Castell de Torrent
Torrent[dead link] (Spanish: Torrente) is the second largest city in Valencia province. The city of 81,000 people (2018) is 9 km southwest of the capital city of Valencia.


Understand[edit]
Torrent (from Latin torrens) was established as a settlement by the Romans, although the area has been inhabited since a much earlier period. The street layout of the old city centre, with its narrow and winding alleys, dates from the Arab period, and in the early 13th century the town was taken by the Christian Reconquista. Today it is known primarily as a bedroom community of Valencia.
