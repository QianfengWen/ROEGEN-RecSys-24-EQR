Marina Bay, Miri
Miri[dead link] is a city in Sarawak, Malaysia. It is the second largest city in the state (with a population of about 235,000 in 2010, and 290,000 in its district). It is on its northern coast near the border with Brunei. Known by its nickname "Oil Town", Miri is the birthplace of the Malaysian petroleum industry, as the city was founded in 1910 when the first oil well was drilled by Royal Dutch Shell. Petroleum has continued to drive the city's economy and development ever since.
Miri is the main tourist gateway to various national parks, which makes it a favourite ecotourism destination and can be arguably called the "Resort City".


Understand[edit]
The Sarawak Shell Berhad and Petronas Carigali are headquartered here. As a result, Miri has a cosmopolitan whiff as it hosts expatriates from all over the world, who work in these multinational oil and gas giants.
Visitors stop for transit here to change planes before heading onward to Gunung Mulu National Park or the famous Kelabit Highlands.
Miri boasts a diverse population, which consists of Chinese, Malay, Iban, Bidayuh, Melanau, Kelabit, Lun Bawang and many other ethnic groups. International students from a foreign university campus based here and expatriates from international corporations add much spice to Miri as well.

Visitor information[edit]
The people are quite helpful when it comes to directions or any help needed. A visitor's information centre is available downtown for any further enquiries:

 San Ching Tian Temple. Largest Taoist temple in South East Asia.

Lambir Hills National Park[edit]

4.19826114.0428981 Lambir Hills National Park is some 30 km south of Miri. Enjoy the wonders of nature and take a hike in the park. There are plenty of impressive tall trees, interesting bird songs, and several big and small picturesque waterfalls where you can swim as well. If you have keen eyes you may also spot frogs, lizards, and other wildlife. The park is popular at weekends when people from Miri travel there for a day visit. For longer stays, visitors can book one of several chalets. At the park headquarters there's a shop with snacks, drinks, and simple MYR5 hot meals.
There are several hiking trails for visitors to explore. These range from short and fairly flat walks to the long, challenging, and steep trek to the summit of Bukit Lambir, the tallest point in the park. If heading towards the peak, bring plenty of water, and turn back if it starts to rain, because the streams can flood dangerously.

File-eared tree frog
Cost to enter the park is RM 20/person (RM 7 for children 7–18, free for 6 and under; prices updated 2019). Bring your passport or a photocopy—you need it to enter the park. The trails are open 8AM–4PM, but arrive as close to 8AM as you can to beat the midday heat for a short hike or to have enough time for a long hike—you have to be back at headquarters by 4PM.
Getting to the park takes 30 minutes by car or an hour by bus—buses en route to Bintulu may drop you at the park entrance gate however may charge full fare RM 25. It's also easy enough to take a taxi or a Grab to the park, but getting back can be tricky, as you won't find any taxis hanging around to pick you up. So either arrange a specific time for the taxi to come back and get you, or plan to take a bus back. The buses run once an hour, more or less; you can wait at the bus stop at the side of the road and flag one down to get back to Miri for RM 10. Alternatively you can take the bus the other direction to head to Bintulu or Niah National Park.
Bring more water than you think you'll need. It's humid!
