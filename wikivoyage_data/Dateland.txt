Dateland is a tiny settlement in Yuma County, Arizona, most notable for farming Medjool and other types of dates. The town was once a World War II training outpost and the site of a Japanese internment camp. Today, it is a fun little road stop, the best place to pull off the road between Gila Bend and Yuma.

Do[edit]
Fill up on gas if you're down to a quarter-tank or less. Gasoline in this region of Arizona is scarce, and you don't want to get stranded in the desert. Dateland's gas prices are surprisingly reasonable considering the isolated and remote location.
