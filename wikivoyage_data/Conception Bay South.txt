The town of Conception Bay South (CBS) is the third largest municipality in the province of Newfoundland, with 26,000 people (2016). It is 20 km southwest of the city of St. John's.


Understand[edit]
The town is on the southern shore of Conception Bay on the Avalon Peninsula.  The town is part of the St. John's Metropolitan Area and most residents are employed in the nearby cities of St. John's or Mount Pearl.
Conception Bay provided ample fishing grounds for some time in its history. Lobster trapping is also a common sight.

History[edit]
Conception Bay South was formed in 1973 through the amalgamation of nine communities (Topsail, Chamberlains, Manuels, Long Pond, Foxtrap, Kelligrews, Upper Gullies, Lawrence Pond and Seal Cove) all of which follow the coastline of Conception Bay.
The early residents, mainly English but some Irish, were attracted by good growing land, abundant supplies of firewood and the more temperate climate as compared to other parts of the Avalon Peninsula. Good communication with St. John's was established by road in the 1830s and strengthened in the 1880s with the arrival of the railway. Residents of Conception Bay South grew crops and raised cattle for the St. John's market and St. John's residents established summer homes in Conception Bay South.

Get in[edit]
It is a 27 km drive from the St. John's city centre to CBS with easy access provided by the twinned Pitt's Memorial Drive highway which connects CBS to downtown St. John's.
There is taxi service from nearby St. John's, Mount Pearl and Paradise, but there is no public transit.
The town is 30 km from St. John's International Airport which receives flights from Canada, the United States, the Caribbean and Europe. The town's harbour is in the Long Pond area and hosts many cruise ships over the summer months.
