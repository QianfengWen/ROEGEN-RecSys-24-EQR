Tumby Bay is a town on the Eyre Peninsula around 1 hour drive north of Port Lincoln, South Australia.

The pier and beach

Understand[edit]
Rotunda Art Gallery
Tumby Bay has all the essentials of an Eyre Peninsula coastal town, the beach, the jetty, and the pub facing the water.  Good fishing, and a laid back lifestyle.
The town has a largely sea-change or retired resident population, with some residents even doing the daily commute down the highway to Port Lincoln.

Get in[edit]
First up, the only way you can get here most of the time is by private transport. Either by ferry (to Lucky Bay then car) or by car. By car, you'd have to travel about 6.5 hours from Adelaide, north up to Pt. Augusta and back south towards the Aussie seafood capital - Port Lincoln.

Get around[edit]
There is no public transport within Tumby Bay.  You can walk or use private transport.

Drink[edit]
Tumby Bay Hotel
You can drink at the Tumby Bay Hotel, dating from the late 1800s, or the Seabreeze which is a relative newcomer built in the early 1900s.  Both serve evening meals and have accommodation. The Tumby Bay Hotel has a rather odd collection of old video games machines in a separate room for the kids, but the Pac-Man game may give more amusement to their parents.
