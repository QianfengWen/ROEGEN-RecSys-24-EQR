Understand[edit]
Mesa LDS temple
Mesa was founded in January 1878 by Latter-day Saint or LDS (often nicknamed Mormon) pioneers and its population is still roughly one-tenth Mormon. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints operates one of its oldest temples in Mesa (the Mesa Arizona Temple, opened in 1927), and the city is a hub for Latter-day Saints residing in the Phoenix Metro area.  Mesa is one of the United States' fastest-growing cities and ranks as the 38th-largest. The city has a larger population than better-known United States cities such as Cincinnati, Cleveland, Miami, Minneapolis, New Orleans, Saint Louis and Saint Paul.
Although it has a large population, Mesa is a "bedroom community." Neighborhoods across the city are diverse — some areas have experienced urban blight, while others contain elaborate custom homes.

By car[edit]
 If you happen to be coming from an "easterly" direction (a.k.a. New Mexico), that means you'll probably be taking US-60 (the Superstition Freeway) right through the 17 exits that comprise Mesa, as part of the Greater Phoenix metropolitan area.
 SR-87 connects Tonto National Forest (in the NE) through the Salt River-Pima-Marico Indian Community, Mesa and Chandler, towards I-10 in Sweet Water Village. It goes north-south through Mesa as Country Club Dr.
 State Route (SR) 101 goes north-south between Scottsdale and Chandler. It divides Tempe from Mesa.
 SR-202 loops around the northern and eastern edge of Mesa, from it junction with SR-101 in the NW corner of Mesa to its junction with US Hwy 60 east of Mesa. Going west of SR-101 the 202 goes alongside the Salt River, along the northern edge of Tempe towards Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport
There are various east-west roads (Rio Salado, Apache Blvd/Main St, Broadway Rd, Southern Ave) connecting Tempe to Mesa which are not designated as a state or US Highway except Apache Blvd/Main St which was US Highway 60 before the Superstition Freeway (present US 60) was built.
