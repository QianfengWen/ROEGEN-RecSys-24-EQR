55.596723.20081 Tytuvenai Monastery, Maironio g 2. This Bernadine monastery was mostly complete by 1633, with its courtyard added in the 1770s. The monastery has disbanded but the Church of Our Lady of the Angels (Švč Mergelės Marijos bažnyčia) is still in use. Opening hours are erratic. "Kavanska" church is also within the grounds. (updated Feb 2024)
Christ Stairs Chapel (Kristaus laiptų koplyčia), completed in 1778, is also within the monastery complex. This has "Holy Stairs": each stone step contained a holy relic, and pilgrims ascended on their knees chanting prayers on each step. After suitable circumambulations, genuflections and devotions in the chapel, they descended separate stairs in a comparatively normal gait, gladdened by having gained an "indulgence", time off their future spell in purgatory. The Soviets raged against this flummery in much the same terms as Martin Luther had.
Chapel Mausoleum (Kristaus Gelbėtojo koplyčia) is on Kaštonų g, 100 m north of the bus station. It was built in 1853 and contains various local bigwigs.
Bridvaišis mound at the north end of Bridvaišis lake is about the flattest, most indistinct prehistoric mound you'll find anywhere.
