North Kingstown is in Washington County, Rhode Island in the United States of America. It has 30 mi (48 km) of coastline on Narragansett Bay and covers almost 58 sq mi (150 km2).  As of 2019, the population was approximately 26,000.  The town is 60 miles south of Boston, Massachusetts, 20 miles south of Providence, Rhode Island, and 12 miles northwest of Newport, Rhode Island.  The 143rd Wing of the RI Air National Guard is based at the Quonset airport.
North Kingstown encompasses the villages of Allenton, Hamilton, Davisville, Quidnessett, Lafayette, Slocum, Belleville and Saunderstown.
While Wickford, a quaint touristic village renowned for its history and its festivals, is part of North Kingstown, it is covered in its own separate article.


Understand[edit]
The history of the town dates back to 1637, when theologian Roger Williams established a trading post between two major Native American thoroughfares.  In 1674, “Kings Towne” was founded by the colonial government and included several present-day towns.  Kings Towne was the center of the King Philip's War fought from 1675 to 1676. At the start of the 18th century, settlement increased so quickly that in 1722 the colonial government divided Kings Towne into North and South, with North Kingstown being the area of earliest settlement.  The seaport and colonial fishing village of Wickford was also established in the early 18th century.
The town's population grew during the Second World War, when Quonset Naval Base was in full operation.  During this time, Quonset consisted largely of airplane hangars, barracks and other functional buildings.  After the base ceased to be full-functioning, many of these buildings were converted to house businesses and factories.  The business park has become more developed and has brought industry to North Kingstown from all over the world.  Through use of its port, Quonset receives automobiles from around the world, including Germany and Japan. The Quonset Gateway project has promoted the growth of the area by providing space for local retailers and high-tech industrial and commercial businesses.  To accommodate for these businesses and to improve the area, many of the World War II era-buildings have been destroyed or are being deconstructed.  However, adventurous visitors can still see some of the World War II-era buildings by driving or biking around the area.  Several Quonset Huts (named for the Native-American structure design they were inspired by) can be found near Alan's Harbor.

Smith's Castle is an historic house whose origins date to 1678. The house was "the first English-style house in the wilderness" according to Roger Williams who had established a trading post near the site and sold the land to Smith in 1651. The house was remodeled to its present state in 1740 by Daniel Updike, a descendant of smith and the longest serving Attorney-General in Rhode Island at the time. Updike turned the farm into the northernmost plantation among the "Narragansett Planters" holding up to nineteen slaves on the property. After the Revolutionary War, the family's fortunes declined, and the farm was sold to the Congdon family, then the Babbits before it was inherited by Alice Babbit Fox who had married wealthy New York businessman Austin Fox. The new owners, though advanced in years, transformed the farm into a large dairy concern. They bred their own brand of Ayershire cattle and opened an ice-cream stand at the site of the present Wickford Hardware store. $8 per adult for tour, senior discount.   (updated Sep 2018)

Parks[edit]
 Bellville Pond. Bellville Pond is a 108-acre pond in Ryan Park in North Kingstown. The pond is a favorite spot of NK residents for fishing during the season. The site is for launching boats from trailers. While the boat ramps are in place for boat trailers, it is okay to launch canoes and kayaks into the pond here as well. The pond is best for individuals with small boats, as there are many coves and islands that can be explored here. Bellville Pond has certain restrictions people need to be aware of, most importantly the use of non-motorized powered boats. This law is taken seriously at the pond, and failing to cooperate could result in harsh penalties. 
 Hunt's River, Devil's Foot Rd. This river is home to a local wildlife and fishery hot-spot in North Kingstown. Featuring trails that wind through the dense woods and even a place to launch a canoe, Hunt's River features plenty to see. From birds, turtles, deer and vibrant plant life, this local secret is a nice place to see on a warm day any time of year. Fun to take children of all ages and even adults just looking for a day away from work.

It can be accessed through the Narrow River by canoe or small boat. 
 Signal Rock, 300 Signal Rock Dr. This park is another little league hot-spot that is always full of the town's children and parents during the summer. It features two basketball courts, swings, a slide, jungle-gym, two baseball fields, public parking, concession stand, public restrooms and plenty of room to do any activity you like. Nice to bring the kids to on a nice day or even had some small hills for sledding in the winter. 
Beaches[edit]
 Blue Beach, Quonset Point. The most private of the three public beaches on Quonset Point, Blue Beach is accessed by a crushed stone path through the woods from a small parking lot and offers a nice view of the Jamestown Bridge. Open from dawn to dusk, and free all year round including parking, it is a great place to go for a nice, quiet walk or a picnic, and it is a popular fishing spot. The water is pretty calm for swimming, but there is no lifeguard on duty so swimmers should be cautious. Alcohol and open fires are prohibited, but pets are allowed as long as they are leashed. 
 Compass Rose Beach, Quonset Point. The largest and most popular of the three public beaches on Quonset Point, Compass Rose Beach, like Blue Beach, offers a nice view of the Jamestown Bridge. Featuring a large parking lot directly in front of the beach where visitors can park for free, picnic tables, trash cans, and porta johns, it is a popular spot for family gatherings and picnics. Many locals also come here to watch the fireworks in July as opposed to the town beach, since there is no admission. Open from dawn to dusk, the beach also features fairly calm water for swimming, although it can get deep quickly and there is no lifeguard on duty. As with the other Quonset Point beaches, alcohol and open fires are prohibited, but pets are allowed as long as they are leashed. 
 Spink's Neck Beach, Quonset Point. Near Allen Harbor, Spink's Neck Beach is the smallest of the three public beaches on Quonset Point. Open from dawn to dusk and free year round including parking, it is a nice beach for a walk, picnic, or swim, although like the other beaches there is no lifeguard on duty. The same rules for the other two beaches also apply: alcohol and open fires are prohibited although pets are allowed as long as they are leashed. 
 Rome Point, Boston Neck Rd. Open from sunrise to sunset and free year round, Rome Point features the John H. Chafee Nature Preserve, walking trails, and a small beach with a nice view of the Jamestown Bridge. It is a popular spot for bird watchers and hikers, with free parking available on site. In the winter, it is possible to see seals from the beach, and many people enjoy looking for shells and beach glass there as well. However, the beach is not very good for swimming as the water can become rough and the bottom is very rocky. There is also no lifeguard on duty. 
Do[edit]
As is everywhere else in New England what there is to do in North Kingstown varies by the season, but you will always find something.

 Biomes Marine Biology Center, 6640 Post Rd, ☏ +1 401 295-4690. Daily Noon-5PM. A privately owned education center specializing in hands-on marine biology programs with knowledgeable staff on hand for schools and families.

 Oak Tree Trail, 50 East Ct (Davisville Elementary School). This small but quiet stretch of wildlife trails sits behind Daviville's elementary school.  It consists of about 7 trails that run through a small patch woods that sits next to some marshy wetlands and Davisville Pond.  Featuring a bridge over the pond and a look-out tower that peers of the tree-tops, this quaint set of trails is a great idea for anyone to try on a nice day.  However, after dark the trails become crowded due to a lot of younger kids playing man hunt and such, so if you are bringing younger children it's best to go during the day. 
 Drybridge Quarry. One of the few places in Rhode Island with the necessary ample space for off-roading, Drybridge Quarry has long been a popular dirt bike and ATV area for locals. Being private property and a place of active digging, any riding done is likely to be illegal without official consent. However, given the limited options in the state for off-roading, coupled with the long history of active riders on weekends and holidays, employees generally ignore riders as long as they do not tamper with any equipment. 
 Kingstown Bowl, 6125 Post Rd, ☏ +1 401-884-4450. Winter hours: M-Th 9AM-11PM; F 9AM-midnight; Sa 9AM-1AM; Su 11AM-11PM. Offering weekday specials, child and senior rates, and a special rock and bowl event every Saturday night which includes a dj playing popular music, fun bowling challenges, and cool lighting, Kingstown Bowl provides great in-town entertainment for reasonable prices.  If you don't feel like bowling, there are also pool tables on site.  Food and drinks, including alcoholic beverages, can be purchased from the bar area, which is closed off from the main bowling area but features a window to serve those bowling.  Since Kingstown Bowl is a popular hang-out spot, it does get busy, especially on weekend nights, so make sure you get there early. Kingston Bowl is a local favorite for friends and family of all ages.  Check the website for seasonal hours and special rates. $3.75- shoe rental; lane rental- $20/hr per lane. 
 North Kingstown Free Library, 100 Boone St, ☏ +1 401 294-3306. M-Th 9AM-8:30PM; F Sa 9AM-5PM. This free library in the Wickford area behind Wickford Middle School is a great place to get some reading. Just sign up for a library card and your golden. The library itself offers up and down-stairs areas to get some peace and quiet. They have  tons of seating and have quiet rooms for those studying. The library has many genres of reading and is equipped with book searching computers to help you fond a certain book. The library has much history and being in Wickford brings a lot of traffic. 
Golf[edit]
 North Kingstown Municipal Golf Course, 615 Callahan Rd, ☏ +1 401 294-0684. This public 18-hole golf course is not too demanding but offers a challenge from the blue tees to almost any golfer. Rates are reasonable at about $20 for nine holes, but the best deal in town is after 6 for juniors under 18 when its just $5 for all the golf you can play. It has a putting green, restrooms and restaurant right on the course. The landscape is beautiful, with a few holes that overshoot ponds and an amazing view of the bay on the back 9. It sits right next to Quonset Air Base so don't be surprised if during one of your shots a plan takes off or lands. On the back 9 in particular one gets a great view of the local Air National Guard’s fleet of C-130 transport/cargo planes. Lots of deer roam the course and if you go at right time of day, you just might see a few. If not, you will most certainly come across a marmot or two as they are quite numerous on the course and come complete with their own bits of golfers’ superstition. The one drawback of the course is that it was built over a marsh and drains very poorly. If it has rained heavily within 24 hours, there is a good chance the fairways and bunkers will still be wet. 
 Rolling Greens Golf Course, 1625 Ten Rod Rd, ☏ +1 401 294-9859. This public 9-hole course and driving range is great for beginner golfers. With the only long hole being number 9, it's a nice course to polish your game or just start playing. It is a hilly course and you have any back or leg problems, it is a good idea to get a cart. It offers a putting green, women's, intermediate, and pro tee boxes. The rough is not too dense and fairways normally pretty short so scoring low is a possibility. This course drains very well and is good to go to if it has just rained and you feel the need to golf. $28-30. 
 Kings Crossing Golf Club, 655 Old Baptist Rd, ☏ +1 401 294-2872. This is another 9-hole course but may be the most difficult of the three public welcoming courses in North Kingstown. The fairways are pretty narrow but if you hit the ball straight you should be fine. Weekday rates are $21 for 9 and $28 for 18, while the weekend is just a few dollars higher. This course showcases a banquet that holds retirement parties, birthday parties, bridal showers, weddings and tournaments. Opened in 1964, Woodland is semi-private and has around 200 members. 
 Quidnessett Country Club, 950 N. Quidnessett Rd. This is a beautiful private golf club that had 18 difficult holes that will challenge all but the best in the game. Form its inception in 1960, the course has been one of the finest in North Kingstown. It is pretty expensive to join, but if you have a friend that is a member, it would be best to first play as a guest on their half and then think about joining. The rough is tough, the greens are large and the fairways are narrow. But if there is one course in NK to join, this is the one. Well-respected in the community and sporting great consumer reviews, Quidnessett is really a great golf course. 
Buy[edit]
If you just need to buy something simple, like a forgotten toiletry item or a bag of chips, there are a couple “big” stores in North Kingstown, outside of Wickford, that will help to fulfill your basic needs.

Given the uniquely small size of Rhode Island, any in-state destination is always just a short drive away (usually an hour or less). As such, almost any Rhode Islander will lament over a drive greater than 15 minutes or so. Also keep in mind that, if asking for directions on your way out, Rhode Islanders have a nasty habit of imparting directions based on landmarks that used to be there but no longer are.

Providence – the closest major city and the metropolitan core of the state (to the north; about a 40-minute drive).
Narragansett – home to some of the most visited beaches in the state (to the south; about a 20 minute drive).
Jamestown – a popular destination for the seafaring-type due to its large sailing community (to the southeast, over the Jamestown Bridge; about a 20-minute drive).
Newport – a beautiful seaside town famed for its mansions and festivals (to the southeast, over both the Jamestown and Newport Bridge; about a 25-minute drive).
Block Island – a very popular summer and weekend destination, Block Island offers top-notch beaches and plenty of tourist-friendly activities and facilities (to the far south, via ferry at the ocean coast; about 30 minutes driving, plus ferry ride).
