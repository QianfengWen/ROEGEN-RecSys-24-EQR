Penarth is a Victorian sea-side town 3 miles (5 km) southwest of Cardiff in Wales. It has impressive Victorian architecture and known for its pier and extensive parks. It is becoming a cafe town. Penarth population is mainly made up of people commuting to local city, Cardiff.


Get in[edit]
2 and 4 Plymouth Road
By train[edit]
Trains run from Cardiff to Penarth on the 'Valley Lines' every 15 min M-Sa 7AM to 8PM, hourly until 11PM, and every two hours on Sunday. The travel time is 10 minutes. The rough fare is £3 return.

By bus[edit]
Buses run every 7 min from Cardiff Bus Station to Penarth town centre (services 92-94), with some then continue to Barry via Dinas Powys or Sully. Return to Cardiff is £3 with the added benefit of being a day rover ticket in Cardiff also. Travel time is about 20 minutes.

By car[edit]
There are only three roads into Penarth, of which two are heading into Cardiff. Because of this and lot of the population commuting to work, getting out of Penarth quickly between 7AM and 9:30AM is impossible.

By boat[edit]
But the best way to arrive is to catch the river cat from Cardiff Bay to the Penarth end of the Bay Barrage. Although you will have to walk up the hill to get to the town centre. If the tide is out, it is possible to walk along the coast to Penarth Esplanade.

Get around[edit]
Penarth is roughly divided into the Town Centre, the Esplanade and the Marina. All are within walking distance, with hills.
