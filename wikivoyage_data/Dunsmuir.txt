Dunsmuir is a city in the Shasta Cascades region of California.


Understand[edit]
Dunsmuir has always been tied to the railroad lines that still run through the city. Sitting near the top of a steep grade, the Central Pacific RR chose this location for a service facility and engine house for the helper engines that assisted in moving trains up and down the steep grade. A town grew near the facility, eventually becoming the city of Dunsmuir.
