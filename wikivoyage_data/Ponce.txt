Ponce is a city in the Porta Caribe region of Puerto Rico. Ponce's draw is its rich history and unique architecture.  


Understand[edit]
Ponce is the second largest city in Puerto Rico.  The city was founded by Ponce de Leon's grandson Juan Ponce de León y Loayza in 1692, but not much seems to have happened since then, and it's far less touristy in character than San Juan.  The atmosphere is charmingly laid-back, a stark contrast to the bustling economic and nightlife districts of San Juan. Even as the island's second largest city, tourists may be shocked or refreshed to find that Ponce's downtown is a single quaint city square with no steady nightlife. The beauty and variety of Art Deco buildings in central Ponce is impressive and architecture buffs will not be disappointed. 

Get in[edit]
San Juan: Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport
Aguadilla: Rafael Hernández Airport
Ponce: Mercedita Airport
By plane[edit]
18.008333-66.5630561 Mercedita International Airport (PSE  IATA) (a quick cab ride from downtown). Offers daily flights to the mainland US. JetBlue has direct flights to New York JFK and Orlando airports.   
By car[edit]
Ponce is reachable via the main island expressway. It's about 64 mi (103 km) from San Juan. The drive takes about 1 hour and 15 minutes. The road (highway #52) is modern and convenient and restaurants and shops are readily available throughout the trip.

By público[edit]
Ponce has a large público terminal (787-842-1222) at the intersection of Calle Union and Calle Vives, a few blocks north of Plaza las Delicias.  Públicos to San Juan (2 hr, $20) depart from pier 5A, mostly early in the morning.  Call Chóferes Unidos de Ponce at +1 787-764-0540 to make a reservation; they can also pick you up for a small extra fee.

Get around[edit]
The downtown area is compact and very attractive to explore on foot. Cabs are cheap and plentiful, should you need one, although many museums and restaurants are within a very short distance of the central plaza. The historic center has quality sidewalks. Public transportation in Ponce is pretty much non-existent, although there's a touristy "train" that does a loop of the downtown.  Parking can be quite a challenge at times.
