Anaheim is a city in Orange County, California. It is best known for being the home of Disneyland. Its second claim to fame is hosting the National Hockey League's Anaheim Ducks and Major League Baseball's Los Angeles Angels.


Understand[edit]
Anaheim was founded in 1857, when the ranchero Juan Pacífico Ontiveros sold part of his land to 50 German-American families who had looked for an area to grow grapes. Throughout its early existence, Anaheim was a rural community, and orange groves and other cash crops dominated the landscape. That changed in 1955, with the opening of Disneyland, attracting tourist interest in the area, which was followed by increased population and economic growth.
While the city of Anaheim stretches across 20 mi (32 km) roughly around State Route 91 (the Riverside Freeway), the tourist core centers around the Disneyland Resort property, located in the south-central part of the city. The Angels and Ducks play about 2 mi (3.2 km) east of the Disneyland Resort.

Get in[edit]
The front of the Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center (ARTIC) that opened in late 2014
By car[edit]
The 5 goes directly through Anaheim and can be reached from Los Angeles on the 5 or 91 East. In rush hour, it may be faster to use Route 91 even if it is longer as it is less congested. The 57 Freeway also runs down the Eastern side of Anaheim and is the quickest way to reach that side of the city from the cities just north of Anaheim or from Diamond Bar, Pomona, or Ontario areas. If you are not familiar with Southern California traffic plan on it being congested even outside of peak times and many drivers driving very aggressively. Try to keep your calm even in stressful situations.

By plane[edit]
The closest commercial airports are John Wayne Airport, Santa Ana (SNA IATA) followed by Long Beach Airport (LGB IATA), while the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX IATA) is the largest one in the area. Ontario airport (ONT IATA) is also a popular choice as it is not much further than LAX, often with far less traffic and hassle.
For those who rent a car or take a taxi, travel time from SNA is about 20-30 minutes, depending on traffic. From LAX, the trip takes about 45-60 minutes, depending on traffic. A taxi from SNA costs about $40; from LAX, about $70.
For most people who don't rent a car, shared shuttle van service is an economical option. The shuttle will make multiple stops, but you will be delivered right to the door of your hotel. From LAX, the cost is about $16 per person one way/$32 per person round trip, plus tip. From SNA, the cost is about $10 per person one way/$20 per person roundtrip, plus tip.

The transit connection to Disneyland is actually best at the Fullerton Amtrak/Metrolink station in the city's pleasant downtown area. From there it's just short a ride on OCTA line 43 (towards Costa Mesa) to Disneyland along Harbor Blvd. From the Anaheim Station (ARTIC) OCTA line 430 specifically serves as a shuttle from ARTIC to the Disneyland Resorts as it goes around all sides of the park. The line 50 (towards Long Beach) only passes by Disneyland along the south side on W Katella Ave.
You can also get to Disneyland on Metro bus 460 from Downtown Los Angeles, a semi-express bus that is a fairly slow but direct ride; and RTA bus 200 from San Bernardino and Riverside which travels primarily on Hwy 91.

Stay safe[edit]
Anaheim is considered one of the safest cities in the United States considering its size. Anaheim has a low rape and murder rate, although the rape rate has been growing, along with the national average. By far, the most dangerous crime is aggravated assault. Common sense must be used after dark, and never travel alone. Anaheim was mostly spared during the 1992 Los Angeles riots.

Go next[edit]
