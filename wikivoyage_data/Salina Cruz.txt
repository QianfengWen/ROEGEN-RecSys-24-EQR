Salina Cruz, Oaxaca
Salina Cruz is a port city and transportation hub on the Pacific coast of Oaxaca in southern Mexico. Most visitors to the city are either engaged in the shipping business, or they're heading to nearby beaches for the surfing. Most travelers will find Salina Cruz to be a busy place that offers little charm or cultural value.


Understand[edit]
During the 19th century, the race was on to find the most efficient way to cross the American continent by whatever means possible. Geographically, the port is the Pacific side of the shortest land route across Mexico (the Isthmus of Tehuantepec). It is connected by railroad to Coatzalcocos on the Atlantic side (Gulf of Mexico). In the 19th century, the route was envisioned as a solution to the problem of how to ship goods across between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. A route crossing Nicaragua known as the Ruta de Tránsito became the preferred route in the mid 19th century and the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 made any alternate routes unprofitable. 
The Mexican government has upgraded port facilities and has significantly upgraded the transportation infrastructure between Coatzalcocos and Salina Cruz with new, faster freight trains and new passenger facilities.

By bus[edit]
Several bus lines serve Salina Cruz including ADO, Estrella Blanca, and Sur. OCC operates several daily buses from Oaxaca to Salina Cruz, including some night buses. The 5-hour trip costs about M$350 (Oct 2023). ADO also operates buses to Coatzacoalcos for about M$400 for the 6-hour trip. Buses also serve coastal cities such as Huatulco.  Unfortunately, a central bus station is not available in Salina Cruz so there are several company specific terminals scattered along the main highway into town (MEX-185). 

16.186253-95.2002171 Terminal de Autobuses ADO, Calle Primero de Mayo, Espinal. Modern and clean but small. This is where you catch ADO and OCC buses. 
16.176856-95.1915482 Terminal de Autobuses Sur, Santa Rosa. Smaller bus station with buses departing about every 30 minutes. 
By train[edit]
Salina Cruz is served by the Tren Interoceanico, a north-south passenger train connecting with Coatzacoalcos on the Golf of Mexico. While the line is mainly aimed at freight, a passenger train runs every other day in each direction with a journey time of just over seven hours. Frequency is expected to increase in 2024.

16.1823-95.19573 Salina Cruz railway station (Estación de Salina Cruz), San Diego 287, Las Hormigas. A small station with basic amenities such as toilets, ticket office and vending machines.   (updated Dec 2023)
Get around[edit]
Salina Cruz is a fair sized city and you'll want to use taxis or Uber to get around, especially if you're unfamiliar with the area. A taxi sitio is near the Zocalo, though hotels will happily call a radio taxi for you or Uber generally works fine in town.

Surfing[edit]
The best surfing in town is around Punta Conejo. There are several surfing camps between Punta Conejo and Playa Brazil. Many of these provide surf guides to show you where the best waves and breaks are found and also provide lodging, meals, transportation and other services. They may provide lessons, but most assume you have some experience. The ones below are listed only because they have web sites (there are many more you can find locally).
