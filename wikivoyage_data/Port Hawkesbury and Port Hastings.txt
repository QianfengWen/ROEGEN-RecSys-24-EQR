Port Hawkesbury is a town of 3,200 people (2016) on the southwestern end of  Cape Breton Island, on the north shore of the Strait of Canso. Port Hastings is an unincorporated community about 7 km (4.3 mi) up Highway 104 from Port Hawkesbury.


Understand[edit]
Port Hawkesbury was founded as Ship Harbour (after the harbour upon which it is located) and is largely a service centre for western Cape Breton Island with many of its residents working in large industries in an industrial park in the adjacent community of Point Tupper. The community is named after Admiral Sir Edward Hawke.
Port Hastings is at the east end of the Canso Causeway, the link connecting Cape Breton Island with the mainland. It used to be known as Plaster Cove.

History[edit]
Port Hawkesbury built ships for the timber export trade in the early and mid 19th-century. Schooners and fishing boats were also built for the inshore and banks fishery. The port further developed in the 19th century when railway connections arrived. The construction of the Canso Causeway increased the shelter capacity of the deepwater port leading to further growth in shipping of bulk commodities and the establishment of several heavy industries such as the pulp mill.
The Inverness and Richmond Railway was built from coal mines in Inverness to a loading dock at Point Tupper in 1901. With the opening of the Canso Causeway in 1955, Port Hastings became a railway junction after the Truro-Sydney mainline of Canadian National Railways (CNR) was diverted from the railcar ferry terminals at Mulgrave and Point Tupper. The CNR line to Inverness was abandoned in the 1980s, although the Truro-Sydney mainline continues to operate as the Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway.

Climate[edit]
Precipitation is high, with the fall and winter being the wettest time of year and summer being the driest. Winters are cold, snowy and stormy with frequent snowstorms. Summer is the most pleasant time of year, with significantly less precipitation and warm temperatures.
