Cowell and Lucky Bay are neighbouring towns on the Eyre Peninsula.


Understand[edit]
Cowell is a small coastal town on Lake Franklin, which is a sea lake off the Spencer Gulf.  The town is about 100km south by road from  Whyalla.  
Nearby Lucky Bay, which is the western terminus for the Sea SA ferry service across the Spencer Gulf.  Apart from the ferry terminus, there are only beach houses and beach in Lucky Bay. The ferry service landing there operates the 60 km (32 nm) to Wallaroo on nearby Yorke Peninsula. The nearest facilities are in Cowell around 15 km away, there is not even so much as a general store in Lucky Bay.
Like many of the Spencer Gulf towns, the Cowell area was first sighted by Matthew Flinders, but Flinders didn't enter Lake Franklin, possibly believing it to be a lagoon cut off from the gulf.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Cowell is on the Lincoln Highway, the main route to Port Lincoln.  Lucky Bay is a 15 km diversion off the highway on a quality road totally disproportionate to the size of the town, constructed to be a main highway when the ferry is running.

The Premier Stateliner daily service between Port Lincoln and Adelaide via Port Augusta and Whyalla stops in the town.

Do[edit]
Swim
Lucky Bay has a long beach with white sand and sea grass.  There is no particular point any more suited to swimming than any other.  The calm waters are suited to kayaking and boating also.
Cowell has a tidal pool for swimming, just in from the harbor and pier, with a central swimming pontoon.  You can also swim in the harbor, just over the sandbar.   Perhaps not as nice a swimming location as some of its coastal neighbours, and like other tidal pools it is probably best at high tide (being a bit muddy at the low tide).
