History[edit]
Ancient Sukhothai was the first capital of the Sukhothai Kingdom, a long arc of territory that ran through what is today's Laos and western Thailand as far as the Malay states. The kingdom was established in 1238 by Phokhun Si Intharathit, the founder of the Phra Ruang dynasty. It was the state that eventually had the greatest influence on the later Siamese and Thai kingdoms. Traditional Thai history has it that Ramkhamhaeng the Great, the third ruler of the Phra Ruang dynasty, developed the capital at Sukhothai. He is also venerated as being the inventor of the Thai alphabet and being an all-round role model for Thailand's politics, monarchy, and religion.

Today[edit]
The province's temples and monuments have been restored and the UNESCO-listed Sukhothai Historical Park covers a wide area with numerous sites. Other interesting places include Ramkhamhaeng National Museum, Ramkhamhaeng National Park, Sri Satchanalai National Park, and The Royal Palace and Wat Mahathat.

Climate[edit]
While enjoyable all year, Sukhothai is most comfortable during the cooler weather of Nov-Feb.

Sukhothai only has a small bus station, but the old and new city can be easily reached from all points. The bus station is out of town and should cost you 50-60 baht to get into town by tuk-tuk (40 mototaxi). From the new city bus station it costs 15 baht via the local shuttle to reach the new city center.

17°1′1″N 99°44′43″EMap of Sukhothai
It's an easy 15-minute walk from the 17.01474999.8124941 Bus Station into New Sukothai town along a dirt path in front of the bus station (although the tuk tuk drivers will tell you that it is not possible to walk). To find it, exit the front of the station and walk straight (west) for a few meters until you reach the shops in front of the station. There will be the 17.0142299.8119242 dirt path  leading off to your left (south) that passes by some fields and houses. Follow the path for 350 m and you will hit a concrete road; continue straight along this road for another 320 m, where you will reach "No. 4 Guesthouse". Turn right and after 200 m you will hit Jarodvithi Thong (Charodwithitong), the main street with many guesthouses.
Tuk-tuks will try to get 600 baht out of you for a trip to the Old City (main ruins) some 15 km out of town. The correct price is 300 baht and this is for at least a couple of hours. When you have seen the part you are at and want to move further in the same area, the driver takes you there. 600 baht is a fair price for a full day.
Scooters can be rented from Chopper on Prewet Nahkon Alley, just behind 17.00845799.8161963 Bar 64000 near the bridge of New Sukhothai. The bikes are pretty new and well maintained. Rates are 60 baht for 1 hr, 250 baht for the day (return at 20:30), 300 baht for 24 hr.
Purple #1 songthaews run the length of Charodwithitong Rd and also serve the bus station. Without the shortcut, the trip is 3 km and should cost 10 THB.

Songthaews to Old City[edit]
Large blue songthaews to Old Sukhothai leave from the Bus Station (look for the "Market - Old City" bus stand) and well recognisable roadside 17.00837899.8141974 Bus Stop to Old Sukhothai on Charodwithitong Rd, approximately opposite of a 7-Eleven (there is a bus stop sign), about 200 m west of the bridge.

Sukhothai Historical Park (Thai: อุทยานประวัติศาสตร์สุโขทัย) (14 km to the west of New Sukhothai). This was the capital of the Sukhothai Kingdom from 1238 to 1438 and contains many ruins from that period. Its importance has been internationally recognised and it is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The old city is a popular tourist attraction, and the site has seen much restoration since the 1960s. It is well maintained, exceptionally clean and well furnished with vendors, though with only a minimum of touts. The heavy restoration is worth noting, since with some ruins and Buddha figures it can lead to a feeling that it is a little over-sanitised, especially in the central zone. The other zones are much less "restored" and trips down unmarked tracks can lead to ruins in their untouched state.
The whole site covers an area of approximately 70 km2 (~27 square miles) and contains 193 ruins. The park is divided into 5 zones namely: Central, Eastern, Southern, Western and Northern Zones. The central zone contains the majority of the ruins and a museum. Maps are free at the ticket office. Every zone has an entrance fee of 100 baht each, but the combined ticket for all the zones is not available anymore as of January 2020. Admission to each of the zones is 100 baht for Westerners and 20 baht for Thais. Vehicles cost extra, bicycles 10 baht, motorbikes 30 baht. The park is open daily from 06:30 to 19:30 (21:00 on Saturdays).
It is feasible to walk around the central and northern zones in 6 hours or so. There is also a 60-baht guided tour by electric tram available.
The best way, however, to see the ruins is by bicycle. These can be rented from a shop opposite from the main park entrance.
The best time to see the ruins is mornings when it's a little cooler and before the buses arrive, at noon when they have lunch, or after 16:00.
Also, if photographs are important, remember most Buddhist temples face east designed to be approached from the east so after midday you are more likely to be taking pictures into the sun.
Some review sites have reviews of the different temples where the reviewer has got muddled and is clearly not writing about the same temple the review is for. You would not be aware of this until after visiting the temple or not aware at all if you skip the temple. Use caution with such reviews.

Sukhothai Historical Park (Central Zone)[edit]
The Central Zone of the Sukhothai Historical Park contains about 22 monuments enclosed inside a rectangular walled complex. The north and south walls are 2000 m long while those on east and west measure 1600 m.

The temple was founded by Sri Indraditya, between 1292 and 1347 as the main temple of the city as well as the Sukhothai Kingdom. The design is based on a mandala, representing the universe, with a principal stupa, built in 1345 to enshrine relics of the Buddha, surrounded by smaller stupas in eight directions. The main stupa has the shape of a lotus bud, which characterizes Sukhothai architectural arts. Its base is adorned with 168 stuccoed sculptings of Buddhist disciples walking with their hands clasped together in salutation. The eight smaller stupas, of which the four at the corners are in Mon Haripunchai - Lanna style and the four in between show Khmer influence. At both sides of the main stupa has two nine metre tall standing Buddha images called Phra Attharot (Thai: พระอัฏฐารส).

In the southwest, there are the remains of a 1.5-m-high brick platform on which they found ashes and bones inside, so It can be assumed that it was the royal cremation place.

The lower parts of prangs are apparently Khmer, while the upper have been expanded or renovated by Thais in brick and stucco. The central prang is held in Lawo or Hindu-style. Each prang contains a cella, possibly a podium for lingam and crypt. There are few remaining stucco works on the top of central prang. Later around the 14th century the temple was adapted to the needs of the Buddhist faith: vihara were added to the south of the central prang. Chinese porcelains and Hindu god statues had been found in the area. One of artifacts is the Shiva statue discovered by Vajiravudh in 1907.  (updated Apr 2019)

17.005799.8258853 Phra Mae Ya Shrine (ศาลพระแม่ย่า) (in front of City Hall, Thanon Nikhon Kasem, by the Yom River). The shrine is highly respected by Sukhothai residents. It houses an idol of Phra Mae Ya, a stone figure with a long face, tapered chin, long halo and dressed as an ancient queen. The idol is supposed to have been built during King Ramkhamhaeng the Great's reign as a dedication to his late mother Nang Sueang. In this connection, the word Phra Mae Ya or grandmother in Thai is literally a term of endearment since the local people regarded King Ramkhamhaeng the Great as their father. The statue had been housed in a rock shelter of Phra Mae Ya Mountain. The Sukhothai residents relocated it to the present shrine in front of the City Hall. The shrine is also believed to house the spirit of King Ramkhamhaeng the Great. The Phra Mae Ya Fair is held annually in late February. (updated Feb 2019)

Bangkok Despite two large signs detailing​ explicitly the bus schedule with class and prices, 3 different bus compagnies (WinTour, Transport and another one) explained us that no 2nd class buses are running anymore. Only 1st class and VIP buses. They claimed that the sign was wrong, then that it was old, until finally somebody said that ALL the 2nd class buses are broken down! It seems tourists are now charged first class prices (310 baht) vs economy class (240 bath) - at least I did. Each companies have buses running every hour. The ride takes 7-8h depending on the traffic and stop multiple times until Mo Chit 2 (Chatuchak) in Bangkok. Or minivan to Phitsanulok and train to Bangkok.
