The town grew to prominence during mediaeval times based on local agriculture.  Historically a town whose prosperity came from sheep and wool and thus the town has an unusually large market place (for the population).  Whilst many of the buildings have Georgian and Victorian facades on older mediaeval buildings.

Swaffham is near the crossroads of the west–east (Kings Lynn (15 miles) to Norwich (30 miles)) A47 and the south-north A1065 (London, Cambridge and Newmarket to Fakenham and North Norfolk). These two busy routes provide Swaffham with a large volume of passing trade and travellers, especially at weekends and during the summer months.
