Mayerthorpe is a small town of 1,300 people (2016) in North Central Alberta.


Understand[edit]
Mayerthorpe is approximately 120 km (75 mi) (75 minutes) northwest of Edmonton along Highway 43. It is served by three major highways and is a good pit stop for travellers heading to the Alaska Highway.

History[edit]
Mayerthorpe was incorporated as a village in 1927.
On March 3, 2005, four officers serving with the Mayerthorpe and Whitecourt detachments of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) were killed in the Mayerthorpe tragedy.
On July 29, 2008, the Mayerthorpe Arena was destroyed by a fire. In 2011, after three years of planning and fundraising, the new arena, now called the Mayerthorpe Exhibition Centre, was opened.
In 2016, a string of suspicious fires in the area resulted in the destruction of a CN Railway trestle bridge. The bridge was rebuilt shortly thereafter, in about 20 days.
