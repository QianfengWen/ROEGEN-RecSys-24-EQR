Renwick is a small town in Marlborough.  It is in the heart of the Wairau Valley wine growing district and could be an alternative to Blenheim as a base from which to explore the region. The small town's motto is "The heart of the wine country" and this is evident by the surrounding land being nearly entirely vineyards.


Get in[edit]

Renwick is at the intersection between State Highways 6 and 63.  Blenheim is 10 minutes east on State Highway 6, passing Blenheim Airport at Woodbourne.  Havelock is 20 minutes north again on State Highway 6.  Travelling to the West Coast on State Highway 63 will take travellers past St Arnaud (1 hour).
