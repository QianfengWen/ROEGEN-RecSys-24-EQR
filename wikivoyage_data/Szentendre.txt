By bicycle[edit]
Decorated Shop Windows in Szentendre
Biking to Szentendre makes an enjoyable day trip, at 25 km from downtown Budapest. With a minimum level of traffic, this family-friendly route will take you through a varied mix of environments and terrain, with plenty of interesting stops along the way.
Start your journey by crossing the Szabadság or Chain Bridges, heading north on the Buda-side bike path. This shady path runs nearly the entire length of the river in Budapest, and is a great place for people watching and picture-taking. Keep heading up the river, watching out for sleeping homeless people as you wind through the underpass at Margit Bridge and following the yellow-painted markings of the path. Cruising next to the HÉV tracks, this section takes you past some of the diverse residential areas of Budapest, from cushy and historic uptown Buda to Soviet style housing blocks.
Your first test of navigation will be after going under the Árpád Bridge and suddenly finding the bike path to have disappeared. Take a left, wind through the gates by the bus stop and continue up Tavasz Street, next to the bridge ramp. When you see a giant OTP building, make a right turn onto Polgár Street and cruise through the housing developments until you hit a dead end at Bogdáni Street. Go right, follow the street until you see the graffiti wall on the left, and then continue along the path next to the tracks. Once the graffiti ends you will see a place ahead and to the right to cross the tracks and resume your way along the bike path, which veers away from the tracks and towards the main entranceway of the Sziget Festival Island.
Take a left and ride along the Jégtörő Street path, then a right at the intersection into a few hundred meters of rough but leafy streets, which will spit you out along Keled Street, with the embankment on your left. Follow this for half a click, cut through the car-width tunnel on your left, and continue to the right in the direction of the river. Before you reach it there will be a bridge to cross on your left, which leads to the hottest summer escape within the confines of the city – Római part. Stacked with food stalls, “beaches” and outdoor pubs, this makes an ideal stop for lunch.
Once satiated, return to Nánási Street and continue north. The road name becomes Királyok, and you will follow it for at least 5 km before taking on your next big piece of navigation. Street bikers and families should take a left on Hadrianus Street, which will take you up to a busy road crossing and resume the bike path going north all the way into Szentendre. Off-roaders (in spirit and in equipment) can choose to continue straight along Királyok, turning right at a banked canal and following a lovely and twisting path through wildflower fields and canopied forest before bushwhacking back to the main road. You may have to cross the highway without the benefit of a crosswalk.
Once in Szentendre, grab a lángos and enjoy the town. If you’re too tired to make the return trip you can always load your bike onto the HÉV and ride back to town. The total riding time for this trip is 1.5-2 hours barring no serious stops and the terrain is almost universally level, with mostly smooth concrete. You will need at least a liter of water per person for each direction, a good map, and a good headlight, as many of the sections of bike path are poorly lit at night.

Get around[edit]
The HÉV and bus station are located next to each other, about a ten minute walk from Fő tér, the main square in the middle of town. From there, Szentendre is easily covered on foot. If you're planning on visiting the Skanzen the bus leaves roughly every hour from stop 7. [1] Buy your tickets in advance (Ft 230), or from the driver with an extra fee (Ft 300).

See[edit]
Don't worry too much if you miss the sights listed before: most of the fun of visiting Szentendre is wandering around the streets and visiting the little shops and galleries. Notice the almost intentional lack of straight lines, right angles and spotless surfaces: everything is a bit crooked, slanted, or cracked resulting in an overall warm and cozy feeling. Try to take sneak peeks over fences, through cracks on gates or open doors for a glimpse of hidden treasure.

Walking[edit]
Take a (bike) tour to the Dömör gate
Take a stroll along the winding streets that lead upwards towards the hill overlooking the town. There is small viewing area overlooking the red-slate rooftops and if you look carefully you may even see the strange blue angel perched atop of one of the nearby church roofs.
Try to get lost in the small alleys and stairways.
Biking and Walking tours:

The S-marked hiking trails start in Szentendre suburban railway terminus. Pass the Kő Mountain (366 m) and the Cseresznye Hill (299 m) further takes to the Lajos-source.
The Bükkös creek Valley bike path running to the Dömör gate
From the Open Air Ethnographic Museum a bike path leading to the Pap meadow. then forward to Visegrad.
Other sports[edit]
The city is the ideal destination for water sport fans. The water-skiing and jet skiing is also available for use on the Danube. In the town is located a small boat harbor.
More tennis courts are also available.
Buy[edit]
There is absolutely no way you can leave Szentendre without tasting even the smallest amount of the famed marzipan produced (or at least sold) there. Marzipan creations come in all shapes and sizes, and are perfect both as a dessert to have with coffee on the spot, or as souvenirs.
In winter time, most non-purely touristic shops close as early as 15:00 (at least in Sa).

 [dead link] Belle Epoque - The Family Run Folk Art Shop, 4 Bogdanyi Street. ‘Country style’ interior decoration articles and authentic artisan souvenirs. The shop offers table linen, handwoven kitchen towels, century old crochet hook laces, decorative covers, old Hungarian folk outfits, embroidered pillowcases. A few paces from “Fo ter” (Main Square), Belle Epoque operates in a typical Szentendre Mansion which has been built in 1860 and is now a national monument. The shop is equipped with beautiful, century-old furnishings. 
 Szamos Marcipán Édességbolt, Dumtsa Jenõ u. 14, ☏ +36 26 310-545. 10-18. A marzipan store in the same building with Marzipan Museum. 
 music shop (bit off the beaten path, can be recognized by jazz flowing from windows). Great selection, and host is extremely helpful with recommendations, at least in local music. 
Eat[edit]
Gulyás at Rab Ráby
 [dead link] Rab Ráby, Péter-Pál utca 1/a, ☏ +36 26-310-819. This well-known restaurant is popular with tourists, but for a reason: the attractive interior is decorated like a Hungarian farmhouse and the food is quite good.  Gulyas soup is what the restaurant is most famous for, and it's served in a funky manner (see photo).  Open 12:00-22:00 daily. 
 Új Művész, Dumtsa Jenő u. 7 (near Marcipan Museum), ☏ +36 26 311-484. Located on one of the main street; moderate prices and good cuisine--although nothing really special found so far. 
 Langós (on the way to Szentendre by bike). one of the best langós in the country (so the locals say). This is just a small counter on your left after the first few pubs when you get to the small path going along the river. 
Drink[edit]
In winter, hot wine is extremely cheap.
