Alytus is a city in Dzūkija or Dainava Region of southern Lithuania. It has an old core but is mostly modern and industrial, and you'd probably only visit if you were in the refrigerator business. In 2023 Alytus had a population of 53,514. 


Understand[edit]
The original medieval settlement was east of the River Nemunas around the castle. This town, sometimes called Alytus I, became part of the Tsarist Empire in 1795 with the river as the border. The west bank settlement or Alytus II developed from the 15th century around the site now occupied by the Church of the Guardian Angels; it became part of the Prussian Empire. The two only combined in 1915.
In the 20th century the city spread far beyond its core, mostly on the west bank. Major industries here are machinery and electrical equipment especially refrigerators and freezers, timber products such as furniture and pre-fab housing, and textiles including clothing and sportswear.
The Tourist Information Centre[dead link] is on St Dariaus & St Girėno g 1, corner with Alyvų tak. It's open M-F 09:00-18:00.
