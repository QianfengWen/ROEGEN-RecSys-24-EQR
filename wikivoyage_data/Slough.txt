Understand[edit]




Slough
“Come, friendly bombs, and fall on Slough!
It isn't fit for humans now,
There isn't grass to graze a cow.
Swarm over, Death!”
— The first stanza of Slough by Sir John Betjeman


Slough has something of a negative reputation which can be famously attributed to Sir John Betjeman's poem of the same name.
This could also be a result of Berkshire being a stereotypically posh county thanks to the presence of Windsor, Maidenhead and Bray.
The town has been featured prominently in the police reality show Road Wars and is the setting of the cringe comedy The Office.
Because of Slough not being too far from Pinewood Studios (6.4km) which is in Iver Heath, Bucks; locals often spot celebrities staying in Slough as a centre point to many places around East Berkshire/South Buckinghamshire.
