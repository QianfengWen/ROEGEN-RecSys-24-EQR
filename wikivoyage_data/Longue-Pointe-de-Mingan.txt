Understand[edit]
In 1976, the segment of Route 138 passing through the village was connected to the rest of the province's road network; this connection allowed a significant influx of travellers, especially tourists in summer. From now on, provisions and goods arrive mainly by land rather than by sea. In addition, the village is now served by the bus service from the north shore to Havre-Saint-Pierre.
This atypical municipality has an almost exclusively French-speaking population of 434 inhabitants in 2016. 

Geography[edit]
The Jacques-Cartier Strait, located between Anticosti Island and the North Shore, is well frequented by fishermen, boaters and boaters visiting the rock islands sculpted artistically by the sea in the Réserve de Mingan Archipelago National Park.
La Longue-Pointe, located in the township of Mingan, between Mingan and Magpie, is the shortest distance (34 km) between the continental north shore and Pointe Nord (Cap-de-Rabast) on the Côte de la Discovery (north side) of Anticosti Island. To connect the two points, you have to cross the Chenal de Mingan (near the Côte-Nord coast), the Chenal aux Perroquets, the Îles de Mingan and the Strait of Jacques-Cartier.

History[edit]
The local history is rich in significant events: numerous shipwrecks, storms on the sea, fishing expeditions and caplan fishing, the hordes of tourists visiting the Parc national de l'archipel des Îles de Mingan, the arrival of Route 138 in 1976, the isolation of a remote riverside village, the period of supply ships, the telegraph, the arrival of the first car, the first plane, the snowmobile, electricity, telephone, television, municipal erection, seafood processing, and military airfield.
Thadée Leblanc was the first European to settle in Longue-Pointe-de-Mingan; he came in 1849 with his family from Anse du Cap (Cap-d'Espoir) in Gaspésie. The establishment of a hamlet was based on the economic vocation of cod fishing. This economic activity mainly attracted Gaspesians from around Paspébiac, Grande-Rivière and Port-Daniel.

in the 1942 crash of the US Army PBY Catalina plane
On November 2, 1942 (in the midst of World War II), the PBY Catalina, an amphibious aircraft of the United States Air Force, crashed off the Canadian coast near the village of Longue-Pointe-de-Mingan. This tragedy occurred after the plane hit high waves after taking off from the airfield. The town's fishermen then braved the stormy waters of the Gulf to find four crew members clinging to the fuselage before the plane sank in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Five other Americans, including the pilot, were trapped inside the seaplane and lost their lives.
