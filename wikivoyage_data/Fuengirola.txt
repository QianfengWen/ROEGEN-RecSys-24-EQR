Fuengirola is a city in the Costa del Sol in southern Spain that is popular with tourists for its long sandy beach and malécon.


Understand[edit]
It is one of a number of villages along the Costa del Sol that has grown up with and due to tourism.  Note that Fuengirola encompasses a few of the other small nearby communities like Los Boliches, and Carvajal, and has bus and train line serving that area.

Get in[edit]
The main airport is Malaga International and just about every airline in Europe runs regular flights into it.  The cheapest options from the UK being the usual, Ryanair, Jet2 and EasyJet; Scandinavian Airlines and Norwegian from Scandinavia. Once on the ground you have a few options.

By car[edit]
Fuengirola is a 25-km drive from Malaga airport. Numerous rental car agents operate from within the airport, but you can usually save a few euros by going to cheaper rental companies across the road from the airport, rather than renting from a company inside

By taxi[edit]
Fuengirola is 20 minutes by taxi from Malaga airport, and taxis are available 24 hours a day. Fares are usually €30–35 (depending on time & season). The usual, common sense rules apply when taking a taxi abroad: agree the rate in advance, and if the driver is being vague mention ask to see the rate card "to help him understand your requirement". All taxis are required to have one.
Be aware of the minibuses, as they will often try to charge you €65 or more.
It is always recommended that you use the first in first out policy, commonly.

By train[edit]
This will take you approximately 35 minutes by light rail from Málaga airport. Fuengirola is the last stop. The station is about 2 minutes' walk from the terminal building, just go out of the door at departures and turn to the right. It's well sign posted. The fare is €2.80 (€2.80 weekends and holidays) but make sure you have change as it's self-service and there is almost always a ticket inspector. The first train leaves at 05:34 and then every 20 minutes until the last train at 23:03 and is very punctual indeed.  Be aware the Los Boliches is also part of Fuengirola, and has a train stop, before the end of the line stop.
You can use the Renfe train between Málaga and Fuengirola if you purchase the Season pass card, for 2024 for 1st quarter, as a part of their green initiative to reduce car traffic.

Get around[edit]

Fuengirola is a city, but chances are you will only visit the centre and beach front and it is possible to walk everywhere. The light train is excellent for getting up the coast as is the bus service. Both stations are in the centre of the city, 5 minutes walk from the marina.
By bus, there are two major bus lines in the town, with the Avanza bus (red) station about a block from the end of the train station.  That station sells the longer route tickets along the Costa del Sol coastline, rather than the local (blue) within the city that has 5 routes and an app.  You can buy single tickets or save money if you buy them using their €2 card, which can be refilled at corner stores.  The town bus stops are different than the ones at the main station.  They cost about €2 for out-of-town riders.  You can also buy a 10-stop pass for €10 from the bus driver.

Most merchants are able to accept Credit Cards, and can use contactless tap.  Although tipping is not required, if you want to add a tip to a payment being made with a credit card, you need to tell the merchant before they put the amount into the credit card machine, because there is no option to add the tip in the machine.  Even most bank ATMs are able to do contactless (Apple Pay) withdrawals.  Most ATMs charge €7 foreign transaction fee, but Deutsche Bank only charges €4.
