Bundaberg, colloquially known as Bundy, is a city of 71,000 people (2018) in Queensland, south of Rockhampton and north of Hervey Bay.


Understand[edit]
Aerial view of Bundaberg, showing the Burnett River and Bourbong St
Bundaberg is closely linked to the sugar cane industry.  The area is surrounded by cane fields, and the small railway lines that carry the harvested cane to the mills.  The closeness to the sugar cane mills is the reason for the siting of the rum, ginger beer, and sugar industries associated with Bundaberg.
The town is 10 km from the ocean beaches, such as Bargara and Mon Repos. It is built on both sides of the Burnett River, which is crossed by two road bridges and a railway bridge.  Bourbong street is the oddly named main street (originally named Bourbon Street, but historically misspelled).  Parts are also known as the Isis Highway.
The town of Bargara is essentially the beachside suburb of Bundaberg. It has many modern apartments, accommodation, and resorts with ocean views. Though close to Bundaberg, it has a very different feel to the town centre.  It has a small shopping and restaurant strip, and an esplanade with barbecues and picnic tables.

Duffy's buses[dead link] run mainly school buses, but there are some public routes.  In particular buses run between Bargara and the Bundaberg town centre every hour or so on weekdays and every couple of hours on a Saturday.

Work[edit]
Seasonal work can be obtained picking tomatoes and other fruits and vegetables. Check with the backpacker hostels for more info. To work legally, you require a valid work visa (not a tourist visa) and you should provide the employer with a tax file number if you do not want them to deduct 48% tax from your wages (normal non-residential tax rate 29%). It may be possible to work without a valid visa (cash-in-hand), though occasionally inspectors do checks on farms and at hostels, which could result in severe consequences.

Buy[edit]
Bourbong Street, the main drag through town, is partly a shared pedestrian zone with a variety of shops, banks, travel agents and the main post office.
