Noord-Beveland is a former island in the Dutch province of Zeeland.


Understand[edit]

Noord-Beveland, located on the Walcheren-Beveland peninsula, has been an island for many years. It weren't the regular floods the province had that made it cease to be an island, but instead the Delta Works made it cease to be an island. The Delta Works included the construction of a land bridge between Walcheren and Noord-Beveland. This land bridge would connect directly to the Oosterscheldekering, which connects Noord-Beveland to Schouwen-Duiveland via former work island Neeltje Jans. The Oosterscheldekering also protects the aforementioned islands from getting flooded.
The island consists of six towns, as well as many smaller communities. These towns, of which Colijnsplaat and Kamperland are the biggest, hold a total of 7,500 Noord-Bevelanders.

Follow the signs going to Domburg, which will guide you onto the N255, which will take you almost directly to Kamperland.

Get around[edit]
Like most of Zeeland, the islands can easily be explored by bike. The terrain is flat, which allows any cyclist - recreational or professional - to take the bike to get from point to point. Alternatively, you could use a car or bus. Trains do not service the island, you'll have to do with busses.
