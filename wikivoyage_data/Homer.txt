Homer is a city on the Kenai Peninsula in Southcentral Alaska and is long known as the "Halibut Fishing Capital of the World."  It is also known as the "End of the Road". The most westerly point on the North American contiguous highway system is in nearby Anchor Point. There the road (AK 1) turns southeast and ends at the tip of the Homer Spit, a natural sandbar stretching some four miles into Kachemak Bay, at the End of the Road Park.

Understand[edit]
Homer is named after Homer Pennock, a charismatic con man who led an expedition to the area in 1896 in search of gold. They found coal instead. Pennock left the expedition, supposedly  to secure more funding, and never returned. For much of the history of this area the larger settlements were those on the opposite side of Kachemak Bay. The completion of the Sterling Highway (AK 1) provided road access in 1951, causing Homer to begin expanding and overshadowing its neighbors across the water. The 1964 Good Friday Earthquake severely damaged the Homer Spit, causing portions of it to sink about six feet, destroying the road and the surrounding habitat, now known as "Mud Bay." The US Army Corps of Engineers reconstructed the first few miles of the Spit, giving it its present appearance.
The Spit is the main tourist area and the location of the harbor, but it is not the whole town. If you only visit the Spit, you miss the town where people live and work. There are over 5,800 people in Homer (2018), and only a dozen or so live on the Spit full-time.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The city is served by Ravn Air Group, with daily flights to and from Anchorage. Smokey Bay Air, a local airline, flies to nearby communities. Numerous tour operators have wheeled and float planes based in Homer.

By car[edit]
The drive from Anchorage passes spectacular scenery.
Driving the 4 - 5 hours from Anchorage is well worth it. The route takes you along Turnigain Arm and up into the epic scenery of the Chugach National Forest and Turnigain Pass. Follow the Seward Highway to the Sterling Highway. When you get to the end of the Sterling, you made it. There is also a regularly scheduled van service, the Stage Line, that shuttles travellers between Anchorage and Homer. The scenery is breathtaking and it will give you a chance to visit some of the smaller towns on the Kenai Peninsula.

By ferry[edit]
Homer is also a stop on the 59.6018-151.41131 Alaska Marine Highway, the state-run ferry system.

By cruise ship[edit]
Cruise ships use the terminal at the Deep Water Dock on Freight Dock Road (east of the Small Boat Harbor). It's about 1½-mile walk or shuttle ride from the cruise Dock around the Small Boat Harbor to reach the main area where the shops and attractions begin on the Spit.  To get to the main area of town from the Spit, which is about 5 miles northwest, most cruise lines supply shuttle buses, or you can take a taxi.

Get around[edit]
59°39′0″N 151°27′36″WMap of Homer
There isn't a public transportation system in Homer, so your options come down to walking, riding a bike, hitching a lift, renting a car or taking a taxi.

By foot[edit]
Distances, as with most places in America, are fairly large, but there are good footpaths all around Homer. If you are fit, walking can be a great way to see and get a feel for the town. Homer is laid out rather oddly, in "chunks" of areas with businesses separated by residential areas or wetlands. Old Town, south of the Sterling Highway between Ohlson Lane and Main Street, is where you will find the Homer Chamber of Commerce & Visitor Center, a good place to get a map. Northeast of Old Town is the Business District and the main drag Pioneer Ave, which becomes East End Road after Lake St. Old Town and Pioneer Ave are walkable; further out, biking might be better and easier.
There are paved bike and walking paths on East End Road, on Ocean Drive and the Beluga Slough, and on the Spit. If you are walking, pedaling, or roller-blading in these areas, it is recommended that you stay on the paths and off the roads. It is about 5 miles from the center of town to the harbor area on the Spit, and it can become very windy and cold at any time anywhere in coastal Alaska. Alaskans know that wearing layers that can be added or removed easily is the key to being comfortable outdoors in this highly variable environment.

59.64658-151.53792 Cycle Logical, 302 E Pioneer Ave, ☏ +1 907 226-2925, cyclelogicalhomer@gmail.com. Bike shop with a variety of rental options and tours. Fat tire beach bikes, cruisers, mountain bikes and e-bikes. App-based rental kiosk on the Spit or in-person at the shop. (updated Dec 2021)
59.64025-151.502783 Homer Saw and Cycle, 1532 Ocean Dr (On Ocean Drive near the airport), ☏ +1 907-235-8406, homersaw@xyz.net. M-F 9AM-5:30PM, Sa 11AM-5PM. Bike and power equipment shop, bike rentals available. (updated Dec 2021)
 Loop Eride, 195 E Bunnell, ☏ +1 907-435-7437. E-bike showroom and rentals in Old Town Homer near Bishop's Beach. At low tide you can head straight out of the showroom to the beach and ride for miles. $70. (updated Aug 2023)
By car[edit]
There are two car rental firms in Homer: Hertz and Adventure Alaska. Hertz and Adventure Alaska also have rentals in Anchorage so if you want to rent a car in Anchorage and drive to Homer you can drop your car off and fly back to Anchorage. Anchorage is the main city in Alaska where most flights from outside the state end up. From there you fly or rent a car and drive to the next town.
There are several 24-hour taxi companies in Homer. Short in-town rides are about $5 per car-load, expect to pay about $15 to go between the town and the Spit.

See[edit]
Homer Spit is a much used and much loved 4.5-mile (7.2-km) piece of land that juts out into Kachemak Bay
59.62-151.4551 Homer Spit. Open all year, however shops at the end of the spit generally close around mid September and re-open in April. The Salty Dawg Saloon, Coal Point Seafoods, and Land's End Resort are the among the few exceptions that are open year round. The Spit is a massive landspit jutting some four miles out into the middle of the bay. Although it is a naturally occurring formation, damage from the massive 1964 Good Friday earthquake made the harbor and other facilities inaccessible at high tide, and the Spit was partially rebuilt by the Army Corps of Engineers. The Spit is the center of all fishing-related activity in Homer, and has a host of gift and specialty shops and eateries. Water taxis and ferries provide sea access to smaller settlements on the other side of the bay such as Seldovia and the artists colony of Halibut Cove. Marine and avian wildlife can be seen along the spit, including large numbers of bald eagles. Careful observers may also see sea otters, harbor seals, or even sea lions or whales. The "fishing hole" is a man made lagoon that is stocked with hatchery-bred salmon. These salmon leave the lagoon as they mature and live normal lives at sea, returning to the lagoon some years later due to the salmon's natural instinct to return to the place it was born in order to spawn and die itself. This is one of the most accessible saltwater salmon fishing locations in all of Alaska, and includes a wheelchair ramp. A walk from the start to the end of the spit will take around an hour. A walk along the beach is a beautiful way to see the spit but be careful of the tide as the beach isn't always accessible at high tide. Kachemak Bay experiences tidal variances of up to 30 ft (9.1 m) in a day, so always be aware on any beach in the area that you may need to head to higher ground to get back the way you came.   
 Skyline Drive. Open all year, is a beautiful way to see the spit from above (it's actually where most of the postcard photos come from). Drive up East Hill Road to Skyline Drive and turn left to reach a scenic viewpoint pullout. Walking up the road will take significantly longer but provide you with lots of opportunities to stop and marvel at the surroundings. 
 Homestead Trail. This trail gives visitors a chance to see the backcountry without getting on a boat or a plane first. From the trailhead on Roger's Loop Road hikers have the option to take one of several short hikes, to climb to a lookout for a for spectacular view, to carry on across Diamond Ridge and past a second trailhead and parking area,crossing down into Bridge Creek Valley. The trail then climbs to Crossman Ridge and runs along the old homesteader road on the ridge top, descending at the end to the Homer reservoir. The trail is about 7 miles long. All three access points have parking areas, if you have two vehicles you can leave one at either end, or drop your car off and take a taxi to the other end. Sturdy water resistant footwear is essential as parts of the trail are through muskeg, a bog-type environment common in coastal Alaska. This trail is not recommended for bikes, although the Crossman Ridge section can make a nice but very muddy ride unto itself. Be sure to be "bear aware" on this hike, especially in late summer as the trail passes near numerous berry patches favored by bears. You may also see moose, porcupines, eagles, ravens, owls, snowshoe hares, and possibly coyotes or lynx. 
Pratt Museum on Bartlett Street
59.645-151.5492 Pratt Museum (natural history museum), 3779 Bartlett St (north of Pioneer Ave), ☏ +1 907-235-8635. Summer (May 15 – Sept 14): daily 10AM-6PM; Winter (Sept 15 – May 14): Tu-Sa noon-5PM. This is the only natural history museum in all of Kenai Peninsula, the one place to learn all about it. Indoor exhibits focus on art, natural history, native cultures, homesteading, fishing, and marine ecology. Outdoor exhibits include the historic Harrington cabin, botanical garden and forest nature trail. In addition, there are Alaskan wildlife, salt-water aquaria and a Museum store. Adults $10, seniors $8, youth 6-18 $5, children under 6 free.   (updated Feb 2017)

Fishing:  Homer claims the title of "Halibut fishing capital of the world. There are more than fifty charter operators that can take you deep-sea fishing for these monster flatfish. You can only keep two per day, but since in Homer they throw back fish under 20 pounds that will be more than enough for most. Homer's harbor is a great place to observe commercial fishing boats offloading halibut, salmon, cod, rockfish, and even crab. Saltwater salmon fishing trips can also be booked through many charter operators, or you can go to "the fishing hole" on the Spit and try your luck. Be sure to get a license before doing any fishing for salmon, halibut or steelhead, which can be found in the Anchor River some fifteen miles outside Homer. Up in the hills above Homer is the Homer Reservoir, which has Dolly Varden Trout and is a great place to see wildlife. If you just want to cook it but not catch it, several fish buyers on the Spit feature retail sales of a variety of seafood bought right off the boats that caught it. There is also an outlet for the Kachemak Bay Shellfish Growers which sells fresh oysters and mussels.
Wildlife and adventure tourism If you want to observe shorebirds or seabirds there are beaches on the Spit and below Old Town, as well as the Beluga Slough wetlands which lie between downtown and the Spit. The Calvin and Coyle trails just east of town and the end of FAA road (the airport road) have observation platforms to view wildlife in the wetlands, often browsed by moose. For those looking for a bit more adventure there are numerous kayak guides, whale watching boats, and so forth with offices on the Spit and at the various floatplane docks on Beluga Lake.
Winter sports Homer has an excellent network of ski and snowshoe trails. The Baycrest ski trails have two easy access points near the dump on the Sterling Highway. There are groomed trails suited for Nordic or classic cross country skiing, as well as a heavily forested snowshoe trail system following part of the route of the Homestead Trail. Over on East Skyline Drive is the Carl Wynn Nature Center, which has non-groomed trails for skiing and snowshoeing. Following East Skyline to Ohlson Mountain road, you can find another large series of groomed ski trails, as well as a privately run tow rope used for downhill skiing and tubing. Ohlson Mountain itself is a free option, but you must walk the entire distance to the summit, there is no longer vehicle access at any time to the top unless you have a snow machine (that's what Alaskans call a snowmobile). Speaking of snow machines there is a local club known as the "Snomads" that can provide information and tips on recreational opportunities in the vast area known as the Caribou Hills between Homer and Ninilchick. Their main trailhead is about sixteen miles east of Homer. The Tustemena 200 Sled Dog Race can be observed from the McNeil Canyon area, about 14 miles east of Homer. There is an ice skating rink on the Spit and, if the ice is thick enough on Beluga Lake, a variety of winter sports occur there, including the amusing spectacle of ice racing in customized cars on Sunday afternoons.

Buy[edit]
Unlike many areas of Alaska, Homer has a local sales tax. The Kenai Peninsula Borough taxes sales at 3% and Homer adds an additional 4.5%. Large purchases are only taxed on the first $500.
There are two standard items commonly purchased in Homer: Salty Dawg hoodies and art. The Salty Dawg Saloon is a local landmark and actually makes more income from merchandising than from booze. Anywhere you go in Alaska you will see people wearing hoodies, t-shirts, hats, do rags, and even underpants featuring the image of the iconic building that houses the Dawg. Pioneer Avenue and the Spit have numerous art galleries featuring local artists. You could end up with something as simple as a postcard, a lamp made from beach stones, or a painting or sculpture. Be sure to consider the shipping cost if you are not able to take such large items with you.

Eat[edit]
Homer is a foodie paradise. There is a very wide range of places to eat, and only two franchise fast food places (Subway and McDonald's). Note that the Farmer's Market often has prepared foods and hot food when it is open. 

On the Spit[edit]
Most of these businesses are only open in the spring through the early fall. The Spit is a bit of a ghost town in the winter. Many of the small shops on the board walks on the Spit change businesses from one year to the next, explore and you might find something you really like.

Budget[edit]
59.6767-151.4091 Seaside Farm Hostel, 40904 Seaside Farm Rd. Nice little hostel maybe 5-10 minutes outside of town. It is a working farm and contains a hostel plus rooms and cabins that you can sleep in. Great people who run it. It is about 4 miles from the town and about 9 miles from the harbor, so you will probably need transportation. Cabins from $95. (updated Sep 2015)

Splurge[edit]
One thing Homer does not have is "five-star" hotels. The upper end of the lodging options are more in the vein of remote lodges.

59.6009-151.40978 Land's End Resort, 4786 Homer Spit Rd (located at the very end of the Homer Spit), ☏ +1 907-235-0400. The rooms are really nothing special, but the view on the bay side of the building can't be beat. The Lodges at Land's End are a more upscale option featuring two-story beachfront condos. (updated Sep 2015)
59.473748-151.4840429 Tutka Bay Lodge (on the other side of the bay; access by 25-minute water taxi from Homer). It is remote and very quiet, although it also features a cooking school. Open May 1-Sept 15.
