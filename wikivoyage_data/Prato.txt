Prato [dead link] is a city of about 195,000 inhabitants in Tuscany, immediately to the west of Florence, and also the capital of the Province of Prato. The city is famous in Italy and beyond for textile production and for the biscotto di Prato (biscuit with almonds better known as "cantuccio").
In the last few decades, Prato has enjoyed a significant population boom and increased immigration. It is now the second largest city in Tuscany, third largest in central Italy (after Rome and Florence) and the eighteenth largest in Italy.

The Duomo of Prato

Understand[edit]
Prato is the low-profile cousin of Florence and Pisa in the Central Italy region of Tuscany. Not as mobbed with tourists and without the typical tourist ripoffs it nonetheless has a history and artistic heritage dating back to the Etruscan civilisation and everything since, plus great food. It's a great place to stay and save a few euros while doing day trips to Pisa or Florence.
As regards the area, Prato is a city that is part of the north-east and covers about 100 km². Located at the foot of the mountain of Retaia, it is bisected by the Bisenzio River, a tributary of the Arno.
