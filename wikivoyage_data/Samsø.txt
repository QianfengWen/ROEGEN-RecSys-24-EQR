Samsø is an island in central Denmark, between the big island of Zealand and the mainland Jutland peninsula.


Understand[edit]
Nationally, Samsø's main claim to fame is that the first potatoes of the year hail from the island. It has more garnered international attention because the heat and energy used on the island is exclusively produced from renewable sources.

It has been furnished and decorated as a Danish farmhouse from the 1850s (supposedly wealthy residents) and the garden has several activities going on throughout the summer months, including weaving, spinning and folk music arrangements. A part of the farm house has been dedicated to exhibit Samsø's pre-historic past, from the Stone Age to Medieval times.

The forest labyrinth
Although cars are allowed and public transportation by bus is available, Samsø is ideal for a bike ride. It allows you to take in the nature and countryside much better, do small side trips and get some fresh air in your system.
Samsø is great for surf fishing. The coast is varied and you can change location easily on an island the size of Samsø, so you should have a good chance of catching a nice fish. Trout, mullet and flatfish are common, great for garfish in May-June.
Soak some sun, play or swim at the beach. Nearly everywhere you go, the beaches are good and accessible. Go to the Stavns Fjord laguna on the northwest coast. Besides the beautiful scenery here, the shallow waters and sandy beaches north (Mårup strand) and west (Sælvig strand), makes for a very good and child friendly beach experience in the summer. Go on a seal safari from Langør with the old wooden fishing boat M/S Tunø[dead link] in the summer.
Pick up some fresh produce from the farmers. The groceries are displayed in front of many farms, when they are in season. You just pay for what you pick up and it is good quality. Strawberries, potatoes, onions, leeks, carrots, green peas, you name it. Some sell local honey, pickles or jams as well.

Stay safe[edit]
It is fairly easy for you to stay safe on Samsø, but be aware of your surroundings and take care of the environment and the bird life here. A few areas are closed to human traffic when the birds are breeding and nest their eggs, as many species are nesting on the ground. Keep your dogs on a leash and don't let your pets run wild. Don't start a fire outside of carefully marked fireplaces. If you go by car, drive carefully and be aware of both bikers and hikers, as the roads are often narrow.
