Lochem is a city of 34,000 people (2019) in the Achterhoek, the region in the east of the Dutch province of Gelderland. It is known for its historical city centre and the Lochemerberg, one of the highest points in the area (49.5 metres).


Understand[edit]
Lochem is a historical city located by the Berkel river and the Twentekanaal. Ever since 900 there should have been a church with hamlet, as archaeological revealed, which would make Lochem one of the oldest kerspelen(settlement by a church) of the Achterhoek. Lochem has been a city since 1233. The fortifications of Lochem consisted of two moats and a city wall, of which the outer moat has been removed. The city today offers houses dating back to the 1630s.
