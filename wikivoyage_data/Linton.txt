Linton is a town in the Goldfields region of Victoria, Australia close to Ballarat on the Glenelg Highway (B160).


Understand[edit]
Linton was settled by miners, with the area originally known as the Linton Diggings.  The railway arrived in 1890.  Mining and industry in the town declined after World War II, and the railway line closed in 1976.  Linton is now a rural town of around 400 people.
The main street has seen better days, with many of the shops closed or abandoned.
