Understand[edit]
Main Street in Park City
Long before Park City became a world class mountain resort and venue for the 2002 Olympic Winter Games, it was famous as a silver mining town, and boasts a lively and colorful past.  Founded by prospectors in the late 1860s, Park City continued to mine silver until the early 1970s.
From approximately 1850, when small settlements were forming, until the railroad lines were laid throughout the West in the 1890s, stagecoach travel was the main form of transportation. There was even a stagecoach business in Park City! William Kimball, a Park City resident, started his stagecoach business in 1858 competing with Brigham Young for United States mail contracts. He was sent to England on a Mormon church mission and when he returned, he started the Park City-Salt Lake City Route. The Kimball Brothers Stage Line operated from 1872 until 1890, when the railroad made its way into the West. Moving quicker as well as transporting more people and mail, the railroad easily put the stagecoach out of business.
Between 1880 and 1920 when Park City mines were the most organized, productive and active, they produced more than 20 million tons of ore including lead, zinc, copper, silver, and a small amount of gold. These were the years of Park City's mining renaissance. The mining company, Park City Consolidated Mines, started the ski business in 1963, when they built the first lifts on what was then called Treasure Mountain.  The Park City area now has two world class resorts: Park City Mountain Resort, and the Deer Valley Resort.
In 2002 Park City was a major host site for the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics.  175 city volunteers contributed more than 6000 hours to the Games, or the equivalent of 750 workdays (and this doesn't even count the public safety volunteers).

Budget
Under $100


Mid-range
$100 - $200


Splurge
Over $200

Expect hotel prices to be 2-3 times higher during ski season; shop around for bargains from June through September.  During Sundance expect every hotel within thirty miles of town to be booked, so make plan far in advance.  If visiting in the summer be aware that ski lodges and condo units will be operating with significantly less staff, meaning that you may be picking up your key from a lockbox rather than the front desk and may not be able to quickly resolve any problems with your room; hotels will not have this problem.

Budget[edit]
 Best Western Landmark Inn, 6560 N Landmark Dr, ☏ +1 435-649-7300, fax: +1 435-649-1760. Check-in: 3PM, check-out: 11AM.

Amenities include an indoor pool and hot tub, a tiny exercise room (three pieces of equipment), free cookies, expansive lobby with fireplace, complimentary buffet breakfast, HBO, and wireless internet.  The Best Western is comparable to the nearby Holiday Inn Express, and while not as nice as the pricier resort hotels it is a good value for the money with a comfy lobby and friendly staff. $50-$150. 
 Chateau Apres Lodge, 1299 Norfolk Ave, ☏ +1 435-649-9372. Private rooms start at $100 per night, dorm-style beds start at $35 per night..

The soundproofing leaves a bit to be desired - if you have moderately noisy neighbors you'll hear their every word - but the staff is responsive to complaints.
