For other places with the same name, see Paducah (disambiguation).

Paducah is a small city on the Ohio River about midway between St. Louis, Missouri and Nashville, Tennessee. The county seat of McCracken County and the largest city in the Jackson Purchase area of western Kentucky, Paducah has a booming riverfront restaurant trade and arts scene in part driven by the city's artist relocation program which offers interest-free housing loans and other subsidies for established artists willing to relocate. Paducah is the hometown of humorist Irvin Cobb and former Vice President Alben Barkley (who served under President Harry S. Truman). Fans of contemporary Christian music will know it as the hometown of Steven Curtis Chapman, one of that genre's most iconic artists.

Restaurants and shops line both sides of the old Market House in downtown Paducah

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Most visitors will arrive by car: Interstate Highway 24 describes a semi-circle around Paducah from the northwest where it crosses the Ohio River into Southern Illinois to the southeast where it meets Interstate 69 at Gilbertsville, near Kentucky Lake. You could also reach Paducah from the east or the west using U.S. Highway 60. Travelers coming from the south or southwest on I-69 (the former Purchase Parkway) should take Exit 25 (U.S. Highway 45) on the north side of Mayfield and turn left (north on 45); from there, Paducah is about a half-hour drive along a four-lane highway.

By plane[edit]
37.060278-88.7730561 Barkley Regional Airport (PAH  IATA) (4 miles west of town). There are a few commercial flights per day with United Express from Cape Girardeau and Chicago–O'Hare.   
Most locals however prefer to fly out of Nashville International Airport (BNA).

By bus[edit]
Greyhound offers plenty of bus services, there are daily departures from Memphis, Nashville and St. Louis. 37.056841-88.5758532 Greyhound Bus Station is on 2719 Irvin Cobb Dr, south of the city.

By boat[edit]
Where the Tennessee River meets the Ohio River, just upstream from where the Ohio meets the Mississippi. River boats, like the Delta Queen(no longer in service), often stopped at the riverfront in Paducah.

Get around[edit]
Map of Paducah
Paducah is served by a limited network of buses, Paducah Area Transit System has three lines with departures every hour during daytime.

Districts[edit]
Market District.  Revitalized starting in the early 1990s, Paducah's riverfront downtown boasts a charming restaurants, shops, museums and an active farmer's market.  A particularly unique offering is that of the mural-covered Ohio River flood walls, which are well worth an afternoon of your time and make for a pleasant stroll.
Lowertown Arts District.  The centerpiece of Paducah's Artist Relocation Program, Lowertown plays host to a dozen or so art galleries of varying reputation, one of the most friendly coffee houses ever and a fine-dining fusion style restaurant. How could you go wrong? In general the feel of the neighborhood is reminiscent of New Orleans' Garden District, at least before Hurricane Katrina. If you make art yourself, the city might even be willing to buy you a house here.

Connect[edit]
By phone[edit]
Most telephone numbers in Paducah, as well as the Purchase area, consist of +1 270 plus a seven-digit number, but the entire region is now served by an overlay complex of two area codes, with +1 364 being the second. A local or in-state telephone call now requires all 10 digits of the local number be dialed (omitting just the leading +1 from a local landline call).
Signage on many established businesses may still display the original seven-digit numbers; dial 270 before these if no area code is indicated.
