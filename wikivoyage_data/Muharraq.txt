Muharraq is a metropolitan area in Bahrain, an island connected to the northeast of the capital of Manama.


Understand[edit]
Bahrain's former capital and third largest city, Muharraq has a long history dating back to approximately 3000 BCE. From ancient times until the 1930s the primary economic activity was pearling; today the city is known as a center for the arts and as one of the most religiously conservative districts in Bahrain.
In 2012 parts of Muharraq Island were collectively inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List because of their association with Bahrain's long history of pearling. These sites include seventeen historic buildings, Abu Mahir Fort, and three offshore oyster beds.
