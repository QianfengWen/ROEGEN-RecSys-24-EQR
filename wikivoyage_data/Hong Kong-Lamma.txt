Yung Shue Wan Pier
Lamma Island (南丫島), also known as Pok Liu Chau (博寮洲) or simply Pok Liu (博寮), is the third largest island in Hong Kong.


Understand[edit]
22°12′11″N 114°7′40″EMap of Hong Kong/Lamma
Lamma Island has a very different pace of life to nearby Hong Kong island. There are no cars on the island, and all apartments must be built with a maximum 700 square feet per floor. That being said, the weekend attracts many Hong Kong people and each time the ferry docks the town gets very full quickly.
Note that although there are hoards of westerners living on the island, it is almost opposite of the sterile culture of Discovery Bay (An expatriate community on Lantau Island). People tend to come and live here for an alternative lifestyle rather than modern living, which makes it great for relaxation.
There are three villages on Lamma Island:

View from Ling Kok Shan Peak towards SW
Yung Shue Wan in the north is the main town where most of the island's population lives. It is connected to the central piers.
Sok Kwu Wan in the south is basically a street lined with large seafood restaurants. It is connected by ferry to Aberdeen and the Central Piers.
Mo Tat Wan is a tiny village to the east with a few houses and a couple of restaurants. The ferry between Aberdeen and Sok Kwu Wan actually stops here, so after eating a large lunch you can stroll over here before catching the ferry back.

Get around[edit]
If you don't wish to walk or bike, the only regular motorised transport links on the island are coastal ferries between Yung Shue Wan and Pak Kok and between Sok Kwu Wan and Mo Tat Wan, with both boats continuing onwards to Aberdeen. Speedboats have been known to wait at the Sok Kwu Wan pier, providing a water taxi service to any destination around the island at a higher rate than scheduled ferries, but it is best not to count on one being available.

See[edit]
Lamma island is not a place full of tourist attractions, but rather for peace and relaxation. However, there are plenty of restaurants, beaches and hiking trails.

22.20504114.145631 Mo Tat (Old Village). Located a short walk inland from the coastal village of Mo Tat Wan, across the low ridge, Mo Tat is a rare example of an old Hong Kong village with both its original layout and traditional architecture fully intact, in contrast to many other such villages around the country where the houses have been redeveloped into more modern multi-storey units. The traditional Chinese-style houses are also surrounded by working farm fields.  (updated Dec 2022)
Do[edit]
Scenery of Lamma Island
 Walk between the main towns. The walk between Yung Shue Wan and Sok Kwu Wan is pleasant and not too challenging. Maybe plan 60 to 90 minutes to get across. Mo Tat Wan is another 30 minutes walk. Note in summer you should wear a hat for shade and carry plenty of water. This walk takes about an hour and is well sign posted. It passes a beach which offers swimming facilities within a shark free net and great views of the power station. The walk also provides great views of the island. After the walk, you can dine at the seafood restaurants adjacent to the ferry terminal. Although the walk is not difficult, it has a few steep sections and in summer with high temperature and humidity it can feel strenuous. 
22.2189114.1191 Hung Shing Ye Beach (15 minutes from Yung Shue Wan). This is a nice beach close to Yung Shue Wan. It is somewhat overshadowed by having a coal fired Power Plant in the background.   
22.225632114.1208042 Lamma Winds (南丫風采發電站) (40 minutes from Yung Shue Wan Pier). 7AM-6PM. An experimental wind farm consisting of a single wind turbine. It is the only renewable energy power plant in Hong Kong. Free entry into the exhibition centre.  (updated Apr 2019)
22.201573114.1297753 Kamikaze Caves, Sok Kwu Wan (You will encounter these on the path from Yung Shue Wan). These caves near Sok Kwu Wan were apparently built by the Japanese army to hide speedboats that could attack allied ships by surprise. 
Sea Kayak Tours. Sea Kayak Hong Kong offers sea kayak tours around the coast of Lamma Island. There are 2 distinct tours around Lamma Island, both originating from Sok Kwu Wan in the centre of Lamma Island. Tour 1 - the southern Lamma Island tour which comprises paddling past stark granite hills dropping into the South China Sea with remote, unvisited beaches and Sham Wan (Turtle Beach). In contrast, the northern tour of the island tour takes you up the East Lamma Channel facing Hong Kong harbour. The contrasts between the two coasts are startling, almost surreal with Lamma being uninhabited (small local villages) while just across the channel is south Hong Kong Island with skyrise apartments towering over well-developed beaches. The trip finishes in Yung Shue Wan so kayakers can catch a ferry back to Hong Kong. More details can be found on the Sea Kayak Hong Kong website.
