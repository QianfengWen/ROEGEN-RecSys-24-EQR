Kingston is a small residential town on the South Shore of Massachusetts. There are many historical sites that are associated with the original Plymouth Colony within its borders including the home of Governor Bradford and battle sites of King Phillip's War.


Understand[edit]
Kingston was founded as part of Plymouth, Duxbury, and Pembroke, but was carved out and incorporated as a distinct town in 1726. Kingston is also to the longest continuously run boat yard in North America, now named the Jones River Landing. The USS Independence, a ship used during the Revolutionary War, was built by Kingston shipbuilders on the Jones River and appears on the town's seal. 
The town was also famous for ice harvesting. Silver Lake, a large freshwater pond and the namesake of the region's school district, was so named as a marketing ploy for the ice harvesting industry. Today, Kingston is quite homogeneous and mainly home to families with adults commuting into Boston for work.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Kingston is mainly accessed by car from Route 3 via exits 8, 9, and 10. Other state routes are Routes 3A, 27, 80, and 106.

By plane[edit]
Travelers arriving by plane usually land at Boston's Logan International Airport (BOS IATA). Coach bus and MBTA rail connections can be made from Boston Logan to the Kingston area. Other travelers may elect to arrive at Rhode Island's T.F. Green Airport (PVD IATA) but there are no direct public transit options to Kingston from  Warwick. The Plymouth Municipal Airport (PYM IATA), located in nearby  Plymouth is a small, regional airport for four to ten seat aircraft.

By train[edit]
Commuter Rail service from Boston to Kingston is available every day from South Station[dead link] terminal via the MBTA's Plymouth/Kingston Line. This train line diverges at its final stop, with some runs ending at the  Plymouth terminal, while others end at the Kingston terminal near the Kingston Collection. The Kingston Collection is about a mile away from the commuter rail station, so it is advisable to plan for additional transit such as a taxi prior to departing.

By bus[edit]
Motor coach service from Boston's South Station and Logan Airport to the Big Y Grocery parking lot off of exit 10 on Route 3 is available via the Plymouth and Brockton Street Railway Co. The bus service continues south after the Kingston stop to  Plymouth, and is used often by residents commuting into the city. Parking for the bus at Big Y plaza is free, with bus riders normally parking close to the Rockland Trust part of the lot. The plaza is not a walkable distance to any particular location, however, so it is advisable to plan to take a taxi to your final destination.

Traveling by car is relatively easy here, though be prepared for a bumpy ride on some older back roads. Easy highway access makes trips across town even faster, and most roads aren't overly crowded or backed up with traffic. Some exceptions are: Main Street near Exit 9 at the beginning and end of the elementary school day, the Independence Mall Way/Exit 8 area, Pembroke Street/Route 27 between Lake Street and Wapping Road at the beginning and end of the high school day, and Summer Street/Route 3A between exits 8 and 9.

Parking is convenient to most commercial and residential districts at most times, and is nearly always free.

The town contains plenty to see and do; various historical attractions include Plimoth Plantation and the Mayflower II, and during the summer a visit to Long Beach, a whale watch on the Captain John boats, and taking in a show at the Priscilla Beach Theater are all highly recommended. There are also a variety of restaurants to sample and events run throughout the summer.
Cape Cod, including the towns of Sandwich, Hyannis, and Provincetown are all a relatively easy drive south from Kingston, especially in off-peak travel hours. The Cape is known for its beaches, and a visit to the Cape Cod National Seashore is highly recommended.
Duxbury, Marshfield, and Hingham are all fantastic towns along Route 3 North from Kingston. A visit to Duxbury should include a stop at French Memories bakery and a walk along the Powder Point Bridge. Marshfield has many great beaches and if visiting in August, a stop at the Marshfield Fair is a must. Hingham has excellent spots for hiking, including the World's End Reservation.
Boston is only about 45 minutes away by car or 30 minutes by commuter rail. Massachusetts' capital city has plenty of attractions for history buffs, such as the Freedom Trail and the USS Constitution. It is also a mecca for sports fans, and no trip is complete without a visit to Fenway Park. There are plenty of cultural attractions such as the Museum of Fine Arts and Museum of Science, and on a beautiful day a stroll through Boston Public Garden and a ride on the Swan Boats is a must. Boston is also a major transport hub, and you can access both its international airport and train and bus connections to other major cities along the East Coast.
