Wisemans Ferry is a town in the northern part of Sydney and the southern part of the Central Coast region of New South Wales in Australia.


Understand[edit]
Established by an ex-convict in 1817, and positioned on the Hawkesbury River, one hour north of Sydney, this small town offers an ideal day trip to the countryside with colonial architecture, history, parks and picnics by the river. As the name suggests, there are some car ferries here that will take you across the river.
