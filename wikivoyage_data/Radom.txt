Żeromskiego is one of the main streets in the centre of Radom
Radom is the second-largest city in Mazowieckie that gets little tourist traffic. The city was a centre of light industry, but is now battling high unemployment and eyeing a transition to a knowledge-based economy. There are few tourist sights and due to low demand the tourist infrastructure is lacking. As not many foreigners visit Radom, relatively few in the service industry speak English.


Understand[edit]
Radom is 100 km south from Warsaw. With 220,000 inhabitants, Radom is a mid-sized city. Once a major centre of industry, it has undergone dramatic changes since the end of communism, with many factories being closed down. This has brought many social problems such as high unemployment, even relative to other Polish cities. This has resulted in Radom being one of the most inexpensive cities in the whole country, offering very low prices in the services sector.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
In Radom there are two airports.

51.38916721.2136111 Radom-Sadków Airport (RDO  IATA). A former military airport that got transformed into an airport for passenger flights. Radom airport has achieved doubtful success so far and there are few operations.   
The other airport in the city is the general aviation airport in Piastów[dead link].
For scheduled passenger flights, the closest airport is Warsaw Frederic Chopin Airport (WAW IATA), some 10 km south of the center of Warsaw and 95 km north of Radom. It takes about 1 hour by car to get to Radom from there.

By train[edit]
Numerous trains throughout the day link Radom with other cities in Poland. For more distant connections, change at one of Warsaw's stations may be needed. The main station in Radom is at Prażmowskiego Street, and usually referred to as Dworzec PKP by the locals. The station is south of the city centre and is within a walking distance from the Żeromskiego Street. Public transportation links are very convenient, as many bus lines stop around there; the bus station with connections to other cities is also nearby.
Here are the travel times to some major cities that have a direct train connection with Radom:

Białystok (about 4hr 20min)
Gdańsk (about 7hr 40min to 10hr, due to ongoing construction works)
Kielce (about 1hr 30min)
Kraków (between 3hr to 3hr 30min)
Łódź (about 3hr 20min)
Lublin (about 1hr 30min)
Moscow
Olsztyn
Warsaw (between 1hr 50min to 2hr 30min)
Wrocław (between 6hr 30min to 7hr 20min)
Zakopane
By bus[edit]
PolskiBus runs a frequent shuttle from Warsaw (Metro Wilanowska) to Radom using comfortable intercity coaches. The shuttle runs approximately every 1hr 30 min except for nighttime. Consult the detailed schedule here: [1]. Tickets are around 10 zł if purchased in advance.
The main bus station (Dworzec PKS in Polish) for long-distance connections is located at Prażmowskiego Street, just next to the Main Post Office (Poczta Główna) and the train station (Dworzec PKP). A number of buses also stop at bus stops in the proximity of the train station.

Parking[edit]
There is a paid-parking zone in the centre of the city. This applies M-F 08:00-16:00. Parking costs 0.10 zł for every 3 minutes, with the minimum payment of 0.50 zł for the first 15 minutes. You can pay with coins using the parking meter or with your mobile phone (more details on the parking meter).

Taxis[edit]
Public transport[edit]
Radom is covered by a public transport network of 24 bus lines, numbered from 1 to 26. The full list of these routes can be found here [4] (in Polish).
Two carriers in Radom operate the public buses, but the tickets are issued and controlled by one authority, Miejski Zarząd Dróg i Komunikacji (MZDiK). There are various tickets, but as a visitor you probably don't have to trouble yourself with most of them. A single ticket costs 3.80 zł, and there is a 50% reduction for children from the age of 4 till the end of education (includes university students), so the ticket costs 1.90 zł (in Polish: bilet ulgowy). Children until the age of 4 and seniors above the age of 70 travel for free. Be aware that you need to carry a document confirming your eligibility to the reduced fare. A single ticket is valid for the whole journey on the particular bus line. There is no time limit, but once you get off the bus, the ticket loses its validity. Make sure to validate the ticket in one of the validators by the door immediately after boarding.
Tickets can be purchased in any kiosk or a shop that has the sign bilety. Tickets can be also bought from the driver on-board, subject to availability, but an additional surcharge applies.
You can check the time table of the buses on this website (in Polish).

Stay safe[edit]
Pick-pocketing happens mostly at the train station, public transportation and local market places; it is not frequent though. Exercise the usual caution when walking around the city, especially at night and away from the city centre. At night, try keep to the main streets or use a taxi.
As a foreigner, you are likely to be a target of any crime just as much as if you were local. Crimes targeting solely tourists are unheard of.
Radom was a pioneer of the Bezpieczne Miasto (Safe City) programme, later followed by other cities in Poland, by introducing a full-scale campaign since 1997. There are 61 CCTV cameras around the city, mostly in the centre, that have helped to reduce the number of criminal offences.
