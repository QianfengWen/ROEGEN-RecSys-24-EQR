The city does not have bus service. It is not extensive, and the modern and ancient parts are easy to walk. The medieval part is a little more strenuous to walk through, as it is on a hill dominated by the medieval castle. A tourist train from the tourist office offers a motorized guided tour that lasts 35 minutes and costs 4.50 €.

See[edit]
Roman bridge
Two of the most interesting aspects of the town are its geography and its ruins. The Roman ruins and the modern town are in the valley on the banks of a river which is crossed by an ancient bridge from the 1st century AD.
The medieval town is high on a rocky cliff. The valley floor was safe from attack in Roman and modern times. In the Middle Ages, attacks were frequent, and the town retreated uphill to a more defensible position.
The apse of the Church of St. Quenin, dedicated to Saint Quinidius, seems to date from the eighth century; it is one of the oldest in France. As a whole, the cathedral dates from the 11th century, but the apse and the apsidal chapels are from the Merovingian period.
