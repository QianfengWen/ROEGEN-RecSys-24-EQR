Smithers is an alpine town in the North Coast-Nechako region of British Columbia.  With a population of 5,350 residents (2016), Smithers is the perfect base for exploring the surrounding wilderness.


Understand[edit]
Main Street Smithers (1989)
Smithers has adopted an alpine theme, which is drawn from the geography of the area. A town bylaw requires businesses in the downtown area centred on Main Street to construct their buildings in an alpine style. A fibreglass statue of a man blowing an alpine horn, commonly referred to as the Alpenman or Alpine Al, is located at the entrance to the main street and has become the town symbol. Similarly, the Smithers chamber of commerce displays an Alpine Al costume at community events and in television advertisements for the town's businesses.
Residents of Smithers are called "Smithereens" which remains a more popularly accepted demonym than the sometimes used "Smitherite".

History[edit]
The Bulkley Valley in which Smithers is situated was inhabited by the Wet'suwet'en First Nation. Smithers was founded in 1913 as the regional headquarters for the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. The new community was named after the railway's chairman of the board of directors, Sir Alfred Smithers.
