Port St Mary (Manx: Purt le Moirrey or Purt-noo-Moirrey) is a village near the southwest tip of the Isle of Man. It has a small harbour for leisure and fishing craft, but the main reason to visit is to explore the peninsula beyond, which has a scenic hamlet, gaping chasms, megaliths and clifftop views. In 2021 the population of Port St Mary was 1989. 


Get in[edit]

Port St Mary is 13 miles southwest of  Douglas the capital and ferry port, and 4 miles west of Ronaldsway Airport (IOM IATA). 
Buses 1, 2 and 11 each run hourly from Douglas to the airport, Castletown, Port Erin and Port St Mary, so the combined service is every 20 min. The last bus is around 21:00, with a night bus N1 just after Friday midnight. 
54.081-4.7431 Port St Mary railway station  is on the narrow-gauge IOM Steam Railway, which operates mid-March to end of October. Four trains a day take an hour from Douglas via Castletown to Port St Mary, and continue to Port Erin.

Get around[edit]
"It appears that Port St Mary Commissioners lurch inelegantly from one crisis to another."
- stated in Tynwald the Manx parliament in 2018
Walk or take the bus: Bus 28 runs mid-June - Aug Sa Su hourly from Port Erin to Port St Mary, Cregneash (for village museum) and Calf Sound at the south tip of the island.  
The local taxi operator gets rotten reviews.

See[edit]
54.0797-4.73951 Giant's Quoiting Stone is a megalith or menhir in the field by Beach Rd. It's 3.2 m high and thought to be Bronze Age, 3000-1000 BC. There's no public access to the field but you see enough from the road.
54.0783-4.73632 Chapel Beach, accessed from a walkway, is sandy but completed covered at high tide. A steep bank separates it from the Promenade and "Upper Village", with its wind-scoured cabbage palms and genteel facade. The Chapel of St Mary for which bay and port are named has disappeared.
54.0728-4.73673 The Harbour is the focus of "Lower Village", the older southern settlement, with attractive Victorian low-rise.
54.0693-4.76914 Cregneash, Howe Rd IM9 5PX. Daily Apr-Oct 11:00-15:00. A restored crofting hamlet, picturesque with its white-harled and thatched cottages and often used as a film / TV location. Four-horned Manx Loaghtan sheep peer over the drystone walls.  Cregneash was one of the last redoubts of the Manx language: Irish Taoiseach Éamon de Valera visited in 1947 and conversed (in Irish) with Ned Maddrell (who spoke Manx) and they understood each other.   (updated Apr 2023)
54.0741-4.76875 Meayll Circle is six sets of paired burial chambers from 3500 BC, a unique arrangement. It's atop Mull Hill a quarter mile north of Cregneash and accessible 24 hours, free.
54.0625-4.76376 The Chasms are an area where the sandstone headland has landslipped and cracked. Some are yawning fissures, others are obscure in the vegetation, but all are deep, so keep dogs and children on a tight leash. The gaunt derelict building was once a cafe. By car follow A31 to Cregneash then turn south down the narrow lane (praying you don't meet an oncoming vehicle) to the parking lot. On foot follow Fistard Rd from Port St Mary onto Chasms Rd, which is paved but barely wide enough for two bicycles to pass.
Cowshed at Cregneash
Cronk Karran is a prehistoric stone circle 6 m in diameter, perched on the cliff edge 100 yards southwest of the Chasms building. Whether it was a living space, burial ground or other ritual site is not known.
54.0573-4.77627 Spanish Head is a breezy headland with 300 ft cliffs and views west to the Calf: access by footpath. The name is from Manx speeiney meaning splitting or peeling, like the terrain of the Chasms. Inevitably this has become garbled into "Spanish", with a bogus legend of a Spanish Armada shipwreck. They were never anywhere near: the retreating Armada knew the Irish Sea was bristling with English warships, and instead tried to limp home west of Ireland.
54.0638-4.79268 The Sound is end of the road, the southwest tip of the IOM mainland. Memorials here are to Sir William Percy Cowley (1856-1958) founder of the Manx National Trust, and to the rescue in 1858 of the crew of a stricken schooner - they had abandoned ship but their boats were pinned by stormy seas against the Thousla rocks. But the big draw is the view over the narrow channel (with a fierce tide race) to the Calf of Man. The Sound Cafe is open M-F 10:00-16:00, Sa Su 10:00-17:00 and commands a panoramic view.
Kitterland is the bifurcated islet 100 yards west of The Sound, part of the Calf nature reserve. The convoluted Norse legend of Kitter, and how some bewitched toad skins saved King Olaf's private parts, makes one grateful for modern TV sagas. Thousla Rock lighthouse is further out, almost hidden behind the islet.
54.053-4.829 Calf of Man is an island nature reserve reached by boat trip from Port St Mary or Port Erin.
