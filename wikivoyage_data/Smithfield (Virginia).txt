Smithfield is a historic town in Virginia, northwest to Carrollton. It is home to a bed and breakfast visited by George Washington. It is also the place where Virginia hams originated.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Smithfield was, from its very beginning, a "river town". It's named for the Smith family, who founded Smithfield. Its whole life and growth has been defined by the river. The Warraskoyack tribe were the first known inhabitants.  The first European settler to own land in Isle of Wight County was Arthur Smith. On September 10, 1637, he patented 1,450 acres, described as “a neck of land running southeast along a creek behind the Pagan Shore.” Today a portion of this same land and manor house (dubbed “Windsor Castle” and built by Smith’s descendants) are part of Windsor Castle Park. Settled primarily by British merchants and ships' captains, Smithfield thrived for more than 20 years as a river port town and a British colony before the signing of the Declaration of Independence. It was Arthur Smith IV, who, in 1750, had the land surveyed and laid out as a town. Smithfield derives its name from this Smith family, not from John Smith of Jamestown fame. Within two years after the town was established, and before the Revolutionary War, all of the lots were sold. Each lot sold for four pounds, six shillings. Today the town boasts fifteen houses that are authentically 18th century, ten of which pre-date the Revolutionary War. In the early 19th century, a number of excellent Federal period homes were built, but it was after the Civil War, in about 1876, that the big building boom began. It was in this era of steamboats and the flourishing peanut industry in Smithfield that many of the elaborate Victorian homes were erected. Their ostentatious elegance of turrets, towers, stained glass windows and steamboat Gothic trimmings is easily evident.

Map of Smithfield (Virginia)


By car[edit]
Smithfield has 3 highways that run through it

U.S Route 258, If you are coming from North Carolina, Taking 258 is most likely a better choice because it is generally less crowded as the most major city in the area is still up ahead.
Virginia State Route 10, If you are coming from Central Virginia, State Route 10 is likely your best bet, particularly if you are headed away from a big city.
Virginia State Route 32,  Route 32 is most likely not a viable option to take for most travelers, at least not for the entire way here due to the fact that Virginia Route 32 only exists, in Suffolk, Smithfield, Carrollton, and Newport News and only being 38.89 miles. If you are coming from one of those cities State Route 32 may be your best bet due to it being the least crowded of the 3 highways most of the time.
By plane[edit]
While Smithfield doesn't have its own airport, Smithfield is mainly served by Norfolk International Airport, and to a lesser extent, the Newport News Williamsburg International Airport.

By train[edit]
While Smithfield doesn't have its own train station, Smithfield is served by Newport News Station, Norfolk Station, and Williamsburg Transportation Center

By bus[edit]
Smithfield is served by 3 buses per day (M-F only) from/to Newport News, on Hampton Roads Transit (HRT) Route 964.
