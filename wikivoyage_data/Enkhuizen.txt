The small city of Enkhuizen is an old Dutch harbour town, and one of the most prominent ones of the Dutch Golden Age. It lost its trade position by the late 17th century, due to the wars with England, the silting of its waters and the rise of Amsterdam, but maintained much of its historic grandeur. Today, the town is famous for its herring and a beloved destination for its traditional Dutch feel and water sports facilities.


Understand[edit]
This is an old city with many centuries of maritime tradition. It gained city rights in 1355 and grew to be one of the main trade harbours of the VOC, the Dutch East Indies trade company. The town was one of the first to rally behind the Prince of Orange and in return was granted the exclusive right to produce and place the sea-marks in the Zuiderzee. For that, it was allowed to charge all vessels on that sea, making the whole thing a very lucrative affair. Enkhuizen blossomed in the 17th century, gaining wealth through international trade and herring fishery. Some 25,000 people resided in the city around 1650; substantially more even than today, as some 18,500 people live here (2019). The tide changed at the end of the 17th century, however, as shifting sands made the harbour less accessible, the wars with England took great costs and nearby Amsterdam rose to fame. By 1850, the population had dramatically declined to only 5400 and Enkhuizen became a sleepy fishermen's town.

Get in[edit]
The main road into town is the N302. It connects to Hoorn and the A7 in the west, while running as a causeway to the east, connecting Enkhuizen to Lelystad at the other side of the IJsselmeer water. The smaller 506 provides an additional direct road connection to Hoorn.
Enkhuizen is connected by rail, with all trains running in the direction of Amsterdam. Until Hoorn, trains provide a "stop service", stopping at several smaller stations, while operating as an intercity fast train after that. Direct connections from Enkhuizen (all via Amsterdam) include Amsterdam Sloterdijk, Amsterdam Central Station, Hilversum, Amersfoort, Apeldoorn and Deventer. Amsterdam of course offers a wide range of other transfers.
In summer (May-September, plus more limited services in April and October), a ferry service [dead link] connects Enkhuizen to Stavoren in Friesland. The ferries run 2 or 3 times per day, stopping also at the Zuiderzeemuseum, and their schedules match train times. In this way, the ferry serves as a public transport connection across the IJsselmeer, but also allows for a nice ride or fun day trip to Stavoren. The ferry is operated by Rederij V&O, takes about 80 minutes one way and costs €10.80/14.50 for an adult's single/return ticket. Children up to 12 pay €7/8.40 and bikes can be taken for €5.20/7.30. Departure times in summer are usually 08:30, 12:30 and 16:30 from the Enkhuizen platform, near the train station, but check in advance.

Get around[edit]
The town is small and easy to navigate the harbour area - where all the sights are - on foot. If you're interested in exploring the surroundings, it's possible to rent a bike.

See[edit]
The Drommedaris is the city's most famous landmark.
Enkhuizen boasts a remarkably well preserved historic centre, and no less than 370 of its buildings are listed as national heritage monuments. There's no escaping the monumental architecture, including numerous mansions, warehouses, bridges and parts of the historic defence structures. Among the most notable sites are:

52.704965.293521 Enkhuizer Waag, Kaasmarkt 8. The city's weigh building survived the test of time remarkably well, and even the centuries old weighing mechanism in the main hall is still available. The outside of the building is an excellent example of early Dutch Renaissance architecture. Note also the family weapons captured in the windows: they represent the barber surgeons and doctors who had offices in the weigh building in the 17th century. 
52.700735.293072 Drommedaris, Paktuinen 1. The city's main landmark is this 16th-century gate building, dubbed the "dromedary". This monumental building was nicely restored in 2013 and still has its original 17th-century carillon, which plays every 15 minutes. It's halls are for rent for events, but the building is otherwise not open to public. 
52.7015145.2769353 Koepoort, corner of Westerstraat and Westeinde. The basic structure of this former city gate was built between 1649 and 1654, after which it served as the western entrance gate in the city's defence structure. The little clock tower is an 18th-century addition, however,

Drink[edit]
Nightlife in Enkhuizen consists of drinking beers, chatting and perhaps an odd dance here or there - there's no serious clubbing around. In summer, the outdoor terraces and the harbour views make lingering outside with your drink and some good company a pleasant experience, but if the weather doesn't allow, there are plenty of small cafés where you can sit inside. The best way to go about it at any given night, is to stroll around a bit and see where the crowds are. Some of the larger places are:

 Irish Pub the Dubliner, Dijk 80, ☏ +31 228 755 600. The place to go for Guinness and Murphy's on tap.
