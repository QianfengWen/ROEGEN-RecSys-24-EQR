Whitstable is a town on the north coast of Kent in southeast England. It's famous for its oysters, and grew up in the 18th and 19th centuries as a fishing port, general harbour and seaside resort. It's nowadays governed as part of the city of Canterbury, and in 2011 had a population of 32,100 in its constituent communities. They extend from Seasalter to the west through Herne Bay to the east.

By plane[edit]
All the London airports have similar travel times to Whitstable, as by public transport you have to head into central London then come out again. (It's almost as quick to fly to Paris CDG IATA and take Eurostar.) By hired car, Gatwick (LGW IATA) or London City (LCY IATA) are closer: that's more of a factor on the return, when you have to consider traffic congestion on M25 to reach your flight.

By train[edit]
Trains from London Victoria run every 30-60 min, taking 80 min via  Rochester,  Chatham,  Gillingham, Sittingbourne and Faversham, where the train may divide. You need to be in the portion running along the north coast to Whitstable, Margate and Ramsgate. The other portion heads south to  Canterbury East and  Dover Priory.
Trains from London St Pancras run hourly and take 75 min via  Stratford, Ebbsfleet, Gravesend, Rochester then the same route to Whitstable and Ramsgate. 
51.35761.0334861 Whitstable station  is quarter of a mile east of High St. It has a staffed ticket office and machines, toilets and a coffee machine. There is step-free access to both platforms. 

By bus[edit]
There are no direct buses from London. National Express runs from London Victoria to Canterbury, change there; those buses continue to Ramsgate or Dover. 
The Triangle bus runs every 15 min from  Canterbury to Whitstable (30 min) then Herne Bay then back to Canterbury; and vice versa.
There isn't a bus station in Whitstable. Buses stop along High St then east along Tankerton Rd towards Herne Bay.

By road[edit]
Whitstable Beach
From London get onto M2. From west of the city that will involve cutting across from M25 via M26 to M20, then near Maidstone use A229 to reach M2. At Faversham M2 becomes A299, follow signs into town along Thanet Way. A299 continues east to Ramsgate. 
Parking can be difficult in Whitstable.

Get around[edit]
The Triangle Bus is the best option along the coast between Whitstable, Tankerton, Swalecliffe, Hampton and Herne Bay. It doesn't reach Reculver. 
The eastbound trains run half a mile from the coast, stopping at Chestfield & Swalecliffe and Herne Bay, before heading across the fields to Margate, Broadstairs and Ramsgate.
Abacus Cars are the local taxi firm, +44 1227 277728 or 277745; from Herne Bay call 283666 or 283777. There's also Uber in this area.

Whitstable Castle
Stroll round the harbour and fish market, which is active daily 8AM-5PM.
51.3661.0361 The Street is a shingle spit which at low tide extends half a mile out to sea from Tankerton beach, unusually, at right angles, so you get well away from shore. Keep an eye on what the tide is doing, because it floods behind you and can cut you off.

Wakey-wakey time at Peter Cushing's Seaway Cottage
A blue plaque at Seaway Cottage on the seafront west of High St commemorates the actor Peter Cushing (1913-1994). He lived here with his wife Helen Beck from 1959; she died in 1971. Cushing's roles included Dr Who, Sherlock Holmes, Grand Moff Tarkin in Star Wars, and dozens and dozens of Hammer horror films where according to the critic Robert Ebert he always stood between Vincent Price and Christopher Lee and declared "But good heavens, man! The person you saw has been dead for more than two centuries!"

51.3731.1265 Herne Bay is a small resort five miles east of Whitstable. Little reason to linger, the isolated end of the derelict pier is not an uplifting sight. You come for the sake of the coast walk from Whitstable then return on the bus, or vice versa.
51.3551.1376 Herne Windmill is a smock mill built in 1789. It's undergoing restoration and remains closed in 2021.
51.3791.1987 Reculver Country Park is two miles east of Herne Bay, a length of grassy cliff-top that is an SSSI - Site of Special Scientific Interest. The imposing towers are of the ruined medieval church of St Mary, built besides a Roman fort - they're maintained by English Heritage and free to visit in daylight hours.
See Ramsgate for the Isle of Thanet, sundered from the British mainland by the channels of the River Wantsum (which flows out just east of Reculver) and the River Stour. Or so it was until medieval times, but the Wantsum is now little more than a ditch which passing motorists won't notice.
Do[edit]
Red Sands, a Maunsell fort
Walk along the beach. A pebble beach with groins runs along most of the seafront with a concrete path alongside.
Boat trips sail from the harbour. Depending on conditions and length of trip, they may take in Herne Bay "island" pier, the outlying sandbanks where seals haul out, the offshore wind farms, or the two Maunsell forts built in World War II further out. (Both forts were used in the 1960s as pirate radio stations, Shivering Sands as Radio Sutch and Red Sands as Radio Invicta.) Boat operators include Whitstable Boat Tours, Oyster Coast Watersports and Greta.

Crab & Winkle Way is a 7.6-mile walking and cycle route between Canterbury and Whitstable along the track bed of the C&W Railway. This opened in 1830 to bring coal and minerals to Canterbury, but has a good claim to be the world's first steam-hauled passenger railway. (The Stockton & Darlington Railway steam-hauled passengers for the opening ceremony in 1829, but for the next five years those passenger trains were drawn by horse, slower but less liable to shed wheels or fatally explode.) The C&WR used the wheezing locomotive Invicta, now in the town museum. It couldn't cope with the line's gradients, so static cable engines hauled trains uphill. The route always struggled financially, especially once the direct coastal London-Ramsgate railway arrived in 1860, but "the Crab & Winkle" continued to carry passengers to 1931 and freight to 1953.
