Understand[edit]
Centre-ville d'Amqui
Amqui (pronounced « amkoui ») is located in the Matapedia Valley in the southwest portion of the Gaspé Peninsula. With almost 7000 inhabitants, it is the largest municipality in the valley and the county seat of La Matapédia regional county municipality, located in the Bas-Saint-Laurent administrative region where it is an important administrative and economic centre for the region. The place name "Amqui" comes from the Mi'kmaq language and means "where we have fun".
Amqui is a "village-relais": a municipality whose merchants provide all services normally expected from a service area located along a highway. Amqui, as service centre for the immediate area, has several institutions: a hospital, secondary and collegiate schools, a police station, a courthouse and various government offices.
