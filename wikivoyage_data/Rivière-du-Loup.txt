History[edit]
The city was named after the nearby river, whose name means "Wolf's River" in French. This name may have come from a native tribe known as "Les Loups" or from the many seals, known in French as loups-marin (sea wolves), once found at the river's mouth.
Rivière-du-Loup was established in 1673 as the seigneurie of Sieur Charles-Aubert de la Chesnaye. The community was incorporated as the village of Fraserville, in honour of early Scottish settler Alexandre Fraser, in 1850, and became a city in 1910. The city reverted to its original name, Rivière-du-Loup, in 1919.
Between 1850 and 1919, the city's anglophone population grew dramatically. Most of them left the region by the 1950s. 1% of the population still speaks English as its first language.
In autumn of 1950, Rivière-du-Loup was the site of a nuclear accident. A USAF B-50 was returning a nuclear bomb to the USA. The bomb was released due to engine troubles, and then was destroyed in a non-nuclear detonation before it hit the ground. The explosion scattered nearly 100 pounds (45 kg) of uranium (U-238).
