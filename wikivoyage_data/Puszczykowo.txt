Puszczykowo (pronounced: Pooshtshikhovo) is a town of 9,800 people (2016) in Wielkopolskie Voivodship, 15 km south of Poznan, on the train line to Leszno and Wroclaw, in the northern parts of Wielkopolski National Park.


Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
Most tourists arrive there from Poznan. The best way to do it is to use railways - the town is on busy train line from Poznan to Leszno and Wroclaw, and the number of trains exceeds 30 daily. The town has two stations: Puszczykowo, in the northern part (suitable for tourist planning to walk along the Warta river or to angle in it), and Puszczykowko in the centre of the town, which seems to be a right place for all visitors for the National Park, for the Fiedler Travel Museum. Local train stop - naturally - on both stations, but if you choose an accelerated train, you'll probably be able to get off only on the second station. Travel time: for local train: Puszczykowo 17 min, Puszczykowko 20; for the accelerated trains: only Puszczykowko 18 minutes.
