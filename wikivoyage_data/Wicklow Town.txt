Wicklow Town is the county town of County Wicklow on the east coast of Ireland; in 2022 it had a population of about 13,000. It forms a semicircle around Wicklow harbour, while just north lies 'The Murrough', a grassy walking area beside the sea, and the eastern coastal strip. The main reason to visits are its historic jail, its nearby gardens and parks, and upscale accommodation that makes a great base for exploring the county. 


Understand[edit]
Ruins of the Franciscan friary
The town's English name is simply Wicklow, probably from Wykinglo "Viking meadow", but the same name is also used for the county, so these pages call it "Wicklow Town" wherever ambiguity might arise. The Irish name is unrelated: Cill Mhantáin meaning "church of the toothless one", supposedly because a colleague of St Patrick got his teeth knocked out by hostile locals, but still succeeded in establishing a church here. 
This area is lowland but was slow to urbanise. It was connected by railway from 1855 but the roads were poor until the 1950s, when N11 was improved along the coast between Dublin and Wexford. This has now been upgraded to motorway, promoting industry and commuter and leisure transport.  
The River Vartry, which is dammed to supply water to Dublin near its source above Roundwood, almost reaches the coast 4 km north of Wicklow. But there it's trapped behind a spit and forms a long lagoon before entering the sea through Wicklow harbour.

Black Castle is the scrappy stump of a Norman fortress near the harbour east pier, you just come for the view.
East Pier (or old pier) has the better view over harbour and town, but North or new pier is more popular for swimmers June-August, when "the Wendy" bathing raft is deployed.
The Franciscan Friary at the west end of Main Street was also built in Norman times. After the Dissolution it served as an armoury and court house before falling into picturesque ruin.
52.965-5.9992 Wicklow Head 3 km south of town is the most easterly point on the Republic's mainland: on a clear day you might glimpse Snowdonia. There are two lighthouses: the upper structure built 1781 has a front and rear tower. It was wrecked by lightning in 1831 but left as an unlit day-mark; it's available as a self-catering let. A second lighthouse was built lower down, where it was less likely to be obscured by low cloud. This was automated in 1994 and remains active.

They're now a branch of the National Botanic Gardens in Glasnevin, Dublin, open all year. The Wicklow soil is acidic and suits species that don't thrive at Glasnevin, such as rhododendron and the monkey puzzle tree. Kilmacurragh House was the Acton's Queen Anne-style mansion, but it's derelict and fenced off. Free.   (updated May 2024)
52.9134-6.22255 Avondale Forest Park (Beyond the Trees), Rathdrum A67 P303, ☏ +353 404 46111.

Round Ireland Yacht Race is hosted by Wicklow Sailing Club every two years in June, with several boat classes including multi-hulls. The next will be held 22 June 2024.
Wicklow Regatta: snooty Cowes it's not, it's a family and fun event and even the sailing is likely to be in piratical drag on wacky craft. It's held over 10 days in July and August.
