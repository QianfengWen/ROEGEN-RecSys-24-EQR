Ussuriysk (Russian: Уссури́йск, oo-soo-REESK) is a city on the Trans-Siberian Railway in Primorsky Krai. It is known for its history as part of various Asian empires, including the Korean state of Balhae, and later, the Jurchen Jin Dynasty.


Get in[edit]
The most probable way to get in Ussuriysk is by intercity train either coming from Vladivostok or Khabarovsk, but they're slowest mode of transportation as the train stop at every station along the route. The most impossible opportunity is a trip from North Korea on board of the weekly train crossing Russian border in Khasan. Buses shuttle between Khabarovsk and Vladivostok twice a day to and fro. Almost every hour, a bus departs to Vladivostok and Nakhodka. However, there is no air-condition system, which is vital in summer. Daily buses to China are equipped with this "must". Bus station Tel.: +7 (4234) 32-22-70

Get around[edit]
The railway station and the city are somewhat far from each other, so use a taxi or a bus going "to the center". The downtown is easy to explore by foot.
