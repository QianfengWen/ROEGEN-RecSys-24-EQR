Artworks of public art[edit]
Artistic work by artist Linda Covit, installed on the embankment in the middle of boulevard Clairevue ouest (corner rue Deslières and facing the linear park) in Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville
Work of art installed near the Catholic Church, on rue de Montarville
Artworks installed outside
Saint-Bruno has several thematic public art sculptures or monuments, several of which were erected between 2010 and 2013 at the four entrances to the city:

Avoine (at the corner of boulevard Clairevue and rue Deslières): a stainless steel sculpture representing a cut-out of grass in a cone evoking the Villa Grand Coteau, a farm that left traces in the history of the city;
Éclosion (at the corner of rue Montarville and rang des Ving-Cinq): a granite sculpture representing a flower in full bloom evoking the greenbelt surrounding Saint-Bruno;
Tempus folium (at the corner of Boulevard De Boucherville and Grand Boulevard Est). Structure of stainless steel made of a raw and forbidding material, this work inspires vitality. It is also a continuation of the artist's research on the antagonism between captivity and movement. This work by Claude Millette, which was created in collaboration with Bertrand Jeanson and Tristan Laflamme-Millette, was inaugurated on September 6, 2012 as part of the city's public art program.
L'Orme à Gaston (near the village lake, on Lakeview street side). This work in acien Corten structure, designed by Pierre Leblanc, entitled "Un orme pour Gaston" or "Tribute to Gaston Miron", is a tribute to Gaston Miron. This work refers to the disappearance of elms in Quebec. It was inaugurated as part of the 2007 Culture Days.
Nature, environment… an avowed mission (at the corner of boulevard Seigneurial and rue De Chambly). This work, which measures 7 m high by 2.4 m wide, represents a tree and its roots. It was created as part of the city's public art program and was inaugurated on November 18, 2010.
L'ambuscade d'hermès (at 15, rue des Peupliers): This path is transformed into a work of environmental art that disrupts the normality of the landscape. This seeks to surprise the passer-by in a plant ambush. On the lookout, the latter becomes a walker in the woods, relying on the good auspices of Hermes, god of roads and travellers...
Artworks installed inside
L'Homme Soleil (in the Marcel-Dulude centre): bronze mural, gift of patron and famous businessman Guy Laliberté. The original ceramic work entitled L'Homme Soleil, was designed by the artist Jordi Bonnet between 1973 and 1975;
La ligne d'or (work by André Fournelle installed in the fall of 2016 at the municipal library). The artist designed this piece in connection with his previous work, Méandre de lumière, installed during the construction of the library in 1983, and which can be found in an abridged version, following a restoration by the artist. The work La ligne d’or was officially inaugurated in the presence of the artist during the Mayor’s Luncheon on October 22, 2016.
The works of this public art can be viewed online on the website of the  website of the city of Saint-Bruno.

Eat[edit]
Several restaurants or dining rooms in the Montérégie have transformed the mode of meals at the tables into take-out or delivery service. In general, restaurateurs have demonstrated great resilience by updating their website, integrating interactive and automated applications for remote orders, as well as the display of the menu, opening hours, their mode of operation (e.g. by reservation, drive-thru service), required health measures (e.g., vaccination record, mask, distancing), other services (e.g., caterer, shops, accommodation, access for disabled, wi-fi, take-out, delivery), contact details and often the history of the restaurant or site. It is recommended that customers inquire with each establishment by consulting their respective websites.
