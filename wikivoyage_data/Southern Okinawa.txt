Map of Southern Okinawa
Southern Okinawa covers the cities of Itoman (糸満), Tomigusuku (豊見城), Nanjo (南城), Haebaru (南風原), Yonabaru (与那原) and Yaese (八重瀬).  The capital Naha and the Kerama Islands are also administratively part of the area, but are covered in their own articles.
Throughout its history, the city of Itoman has been an invaluable port city in Okinawa with a thriving fishing industry. Even today, many of the city's biggest festivals revolve around fishing.
The city's trajectory and notability completely changed in early 1945 when it became one of the bloodiest battlefields in the American invasion of Okinawa. Thousands of Japanese, Americans, and native Okinawans died here. The city now contains multiple sites dedicated to World War II, the Battle of Okinawa and its effects on the island and the people, and peace. The museums here are considered must-visit sites by many visitors to Okinawa.
