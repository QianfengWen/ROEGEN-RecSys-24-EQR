Michaelis Kirche (church) in Fuerth; was built in 1100 AD.
Fürth (also Fuerth; especially when the letter "ü" is unavailable) is a city in Bavaria, Germany in the region of Franconia. It is right next to Nuremberg, so close that they are basically attached to each other. Unlike Nuremberg,  Fürth suffered only a few air raids in World War II, so most buildings were untouched.


Understand[edit]
During the Middle Ages Fürth was jointly governed by the city of Nuremberg, the bishop of Bamberg and the count of Ansbach. Therefore Fürth's coat of arms shows a cloverleaf.  Fürth is also older than Nuremberg, dating back to November 1007.
Fürth had a large Jewish population before the Nazis expelled or murdered them (the most famous being Henry Kissinger, who was born in Fürth and fled to the USA when the Nazis came to power).
As is often the case with cities that close to each other Nuremberg and Fürth enjoy a fierce rivalry that is even more pronounced in soccer, with both teams being dominant in Germany for most of the 1920s. While there is not much love lost between the two cities today, attitudes (outside of soccer games) are more relaxed now than they seem at first glance and the rivalry is mostly folklore.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
On the A73 just north of Nuremberg.

By train[edit]
The railway between Nuremberg and Fürth was the first in what would later become Germany. There are direct rail connections to Erlangen and Nuremberg, but for most places farther away it makes more sense to change in either Nuremberg or Erlangen and take the S-Bahn or another regional train from there.  S1  has three stops in Fürth: Vach, Unterfarrnbach ( U1  Klinikum) and Main Station.

By subway[edit]
From Nuremberg, take subway line U1. Alight at 49.470310.99141 Fürth Hauptbahnhof (Main Station) ( S1   U1 ).   or 49.477210.98862 Fürth Rathaus ( U1   S1 ).   .

By plane[edit]
The closest airport is Nuremberg (NUE IATA). From there take the subway (U2) to the main station and then either another subway (U1) or a regional train. There is no regular train service (yet) connecting the airport to the train station, but at 12 minutes (NUE to Nuremberg main station) by subway there is hardly any need for such a connection. Instead of doubling back into central Nuremberg, you can also take bus line number 33 which goes via some outer districts and takes 30 minutes to Fürth main station.
From Frankfurt airport (FRA IATA) take the train to Nuremberg and from there on to Fürth. From Munich airport (MUC IATA) you can take a regional train with the Bayern ticket (€23 per person + €4 per each additional member of your group) that is valid on all regional trains (no ICE or Intercity, but all RE and RB as well as all S-Bahn trains) and also on the Nuremberg-Fürth subway and all VGN buses.

By bus[edit]
Although some  domestic bus lines do stop in Fürth, it might be more practicable to alight in Nuremberg and take the subway to town, as the Nuremberg ZOB (right next to the main station, about 400 meter on foot to the subway) has more connections than Fürth does.

Get around[edit]
49°28′12″N 10°59′27″EMap of Fürth


You can travel to just about anywhere in Fürth by foot or via bus.  If a bus is not available, you can always take a taxi or ride a bike.
Local public transportation is provided by VGN, see here[dead link] for timetables and ticket prices.

By bus and subway[edit]
You can buy tickets at electronic ticket machines located at bigger bus stops, all subway stations, all train stations, and from bus drivers. Tickets can be purchased with cash or card, but the ticketing machines do not accept bills larger than €20 unless your purchase exceeds €30.  A one-way ticket within Fürth costs €2.50.  If you plan on taking more than 2 one-way rides, it will make sense to buy a Day Ticket Solo B for €5.30 or a Day Ticket Plus B for €8.70.  The Day Ticket Plus allows up to 2 adults and up to 4 children under the age of 18 to ride within 2 specified zones as much as they want. Fürth city buses have free WiFi and USB ports to charge a mobile device.
When traveling from Fürth to Nuremberg (or vice-versa) buy a Day Ticket Solo A for €8.10 or Day Ticket Plus A for €12.30. There are also discounts for students, children between the ages of 6-14, and senior citizens. Children 5 and under ride free.
Buses and subways in Fürth are all handicap-accessible.

By bike[edit]
Bikeshare[edit]
Fürth is part of the VAG Rad scheme. Bikes can be rented via the app for €0.10 starting fee plus €0.10 per minute. You can return the bike at any of the fixed stations throughout Fürth, Nuremberg, Erlangen and Schwabach or in the "Flex Zone" in central Fürth, Nuremberg and Erlangen.

Take a walk in the beautiful Stadtpark (city park). Most parts of Stadtpark are still in typical 1950s-style of German city parks.

On your way you will pass "Auferstehungskirche" (resurrection church), a neo-classical church; Uferstadt, former Grundig factory which is now a business and research park with Rundfunk museum; and "Mainau", a little park with medicinal spring ("Gaggerlesquelle" in local dialect).
Take a walk around the old city. You may for example start on Königswarter Straße and then head West towards the city hall and then over Gustavstraße, side streets and St. Michael's church. Fürth Altstadt has typical franconian baroque style buildings. Innenstadt around Schwabacher Str, Hirschenstr. and Friedrichstr. as well as Königswarterstr. is one of only few almost complete city centres in Historism and Art Nouveau in Germany.

Events[edit]
 International Kletzmer Festival: .  Early March. (date needs fixing)
New Orleans Festival
 Michaelis-Kirchweih (The St. Michael’s Festival): October.  Unlike most church festivals which were appointed as official festival sites from the city authorities, has earned its reputation and popularity through the years. As the second oldest but yet mother of the Kirchweih-Church Festivals it was named after the valiant archangel. It is estimated that this simple, rather modest church reflecting the image of "The old Temple on the Hill" was founded in the year 1100. As early as 601 Pope Gregor declared that the Kircheneinweihung-inauguration of the church should be opened with a cultural feast. And not only recognized as a religious ceremony, historians believe that the foundation of the building occurred approximately 900 years ago, just as the first festival had. The residents of the city of Fürth were very proud and initiated this festival as the Michael und aller Engel Tag to be celebrated on the 29 of September or the Sunday thereafter. The popularity grew as did the area in which it is celebrated, the church of St. Michael, Gustavstraße/street and in the city of Fürth. In 2010 it is estimated to have had over 1.6 million visitors. Early-mid October.
June and September: Grafflmarkt (Flohmarkt) in the Gustavstraße, where the streets are filled with young and old. Meeting is the focus, rather than the buying and selling. Since 1975.
July: Fürth Festival Over three days, a variety of musicians perform at eight venues in the city. One event is the "Merciless Grand Prix" on Fürth Freedom, where viewers rate the performances with red and green voting cards.
October: Die Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften[dead link] takes place every two years on a Saturday in October from 18:00 to 01:00. For young scientists from 4 years old, there is a children's program between 14:00 and 17:00. There are more than 300 facilities in Nuremberg, Fürth and Erlangen involved. Visitors are offered tours of the facilities, exhibitions, lectures and experiments. The entrance fee is €12, concessions €8; the ticket can also be used as a ticket in the entire network of the VGN.
December:  'Fürth Christmas Market'  with medieval market on the Fürth Freedom.
Buy[edit]
On the Fußgängerzone (pedestrian zone) you will find department stores and small shops ranging from antiques to groceries. They are scattered around downtown, but since downtown is so small, they are all a short walk away from one another.    Just take a walk from the main train station through a square called Fürther Freiheit and to the Fußgängerzone in the direction to the town-hall; you will come along most shops on this route.
Souvenirs and postcards are not so easy to come by in Fürth.  But, you will find a small selection in the local Tourism Office (across the street from the Main train station).  Otherwise, you will just have to look around in all the little shops for anything you might like.
