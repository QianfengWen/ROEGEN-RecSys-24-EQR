Palm Beach is a well-to-do town on the east coast of Florida, adjacent to the larger city of West Palm Beach. Culturally known in many ways as the playground of the rich and famous; it is indeed a place full of oceanfront luxury resorts, upscale shopping centers, beautiful landscaping and architecture, nightlife opportunities, and dozens of stately mansions housing its wealthiest residents.
