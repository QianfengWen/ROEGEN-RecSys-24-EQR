Downtown Logansport, looking west towards the Sabine River and Texas.
Logansport is a small town on the Louisiana-Texas state line in Northern Louisiana.


Understand[edit]
It is the second largest city in DeSoto Parish and is a center of recreation on the Sabine River. With the village of Joaquin, Texas on the other side of the Sabine, the two towns form a sort of "twin city" relationship, as Joaquin is where local residents go for groceries, extra services, or more restaurant selections.
The town also marks the northern terminus of the Toledo Bend Scenic Byway (Louisiana Highway 191).

By car[edit]
Three highways approach and pass through Logansport.

US Highway 84, which crosses the Sabine River into Texas to the west and to the village of Joaquin. To the east, this highway passes through gentle hills and pine forests to the historic towns of Mansfield and Coushatta.
Louisiana Highway 5 comes from the north and connects travelers with Shreveport, via US 171 and the small communities of Longstreet, Keachi, and Stonewall. Scenery consists of farmland and forests, with oil rigs dotting the landscape in places - a reminder of the oil industry that continues to dominate the Northwest Louisiana economy.
Louisiana Highway 191 has its northern terminus one mile east of Logansport. LA 191, also known as the Toledo Bend Scenic Byway, proceeds south and winds along the eastern banks of the Toledo Bend Reservoir, passing several marinas, RV parks, and other areas to enjoy nature. Two Louisiana State Parks, North Toledo Bend State Park and South Toledo Bend State Park, can both be accessed on this highway.
