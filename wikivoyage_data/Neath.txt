Neath (Welsh: Castell-nedd) is a town in Glamorgan in South Wales.


Understand[edit]
From a small market town, Neath grew into a large manufacturing base for iron, steel and tinplate during the industrial revolution.  As of 2011, the town has a population of around 19,500, with 50,000 in the wider area. Although it lacks any specific tourist attractions, its location near the stunning Swansea and Neath Valleys make it a convenient, if not overly inspiring,  base for touring these places.
