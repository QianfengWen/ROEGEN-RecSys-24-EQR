Ciater is a town in the Parahyangan mountain region of Western Java, Indonesia. The town is known for its volcanic hot springs.


Understand[edit]
The town and district of Ciater is located on the northeastern side of the Tangkuban Perahu volcano. Ciater is part of the regency of Subang, and located about 25 km south of the regency capital Subang. The town of Lembang (a suburb of Bandung) is about 15 km south of Ciater.

Get in[edit]
Ciater is along the north-south trunk road between Subang and Bandung, with smaller roads also available to the west (Purwakarta) and east (Sumedang). Because the area is mountainous, average travel speeds are slow. The drive from Bandung to Ciater is about 30 km and takes slightly less than an hour in optimal traffic conditions, but because of common traffic congestion in Bandung and Lembang, it takes often significantly longer.
Ciater can be reached by public transport from Bandung or from Subang. There are regular elf public minivans between the cities, that pass Ciater on the way. In Bandung, the elf minivans depart from the Ledeng bus terminal along Jl. Setiabudi street, in Northwest Bandung. Another option is to take a ¾ bus (i.e. a bus that is slightly smaller than a regular bus). These buses run on the route from Leuwi Panjang bus terminal in South Bandung, via Ciater and Subang, to Indramayu. There are no fixed bus stops in Ciater, so you need to notify the driver when you want to get off.
