Coombs Old Country Market and goats
Arrowsmith Coombs Country is a rural area southwest of Parksville/Qualicum Beach on Vancouver Island. It is a popular stopping point for travellers on the way to Tofino with the Coombs Old Country Market/Goats on the Roof and the old growth trees in Cathedral Grove.


Understand[edit]
Coombs is a small community provincial highway 4A approximately 10 km (6.2 mi) west of Parksville. Coombs is home to approximately 1,300 people. The history of Coombs goes back many years. The Ford House which is the old log house on the old Island Highway was built in early 1900. The house was completed in 1911. Next to the Ford House is the old General Store which also houses the General Post Office. The Fair Grounds is an active place in the summer when the Fall Fair rolls around. The Rodeo Grounds just up the highway heading towards Port Alberni is a successful and active place during the summer months. The railway is also a huge part of the history of Coombs as is the United Church. Just over the French Creek Bridge is the French Creek School which is now closed as a public school was a huge asset to the community for over 100 years.
