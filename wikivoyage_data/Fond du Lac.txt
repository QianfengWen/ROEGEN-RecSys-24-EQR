Fond du Lac is a city in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin.  It is the seat of Fond du Lac County. The name Fond du Lac translates to Bottom of the Lake, referring to its location at the southern tip of Lake Winnebago.


Understand[edit]
Although Fond du Lac was founded in 1836, the area at the southern end of Lake Winnebago had been a busy place for centuries before.  Native American tribes, including the Potawatomi, the Mascoutin, and the Winnebago shared the area as hunters,  gatherers, and farmers.  The first Europeans in the area were the French missionaries in the 1600s, followed by the French fur traders.
In the 1830s, James Doty, a federal judge for western Michigan Territory, bought the land at the foot of Lake Winnebago and developed it as a city in Wisconsin Territory.  As such, it lay astride the Military Road (now roughly old US 151), which connected forts in Green Bay, Portage, and Prairie du Chien.
As Wisconsin approached statehood in the 1840s, there were plans to make Fond du Lac the capital of the new state.  However, Judge Doty convinced the legislature to seat the capital in the Four Lakes area (present-day Madison) instead.  During the Civil War, Fond du Lac was the site of Camp Hamilton/Camp Wood, a training camp for Union recruits.

By bicycle[edit]
Fond du Lac is at the bed of what used to be Glacial Lake Oshkosh. As such, it is almost entirely flat; making bicycling a very good option. While the city streets have no designated lanes for bikes, most traffic is used to cyclists. Bikes are not allowed to be ridden on sidewalks in the city's downtown.

On foot[edit]
Visitors looking to travel mostly on foot should expect to do a lot of walking. The city is relatively large.
The Fond du Lac Riverwalk is a paved walking and bicycle trail that follows the course of the East Branch of the Fond du Lac River through the downtown area.  It begins on Morris Street near Brush Street and goes north along the river, past the City-County Building and along Macy Street.  Its north end is at Brooke Street along the river.
The Brooke Street Trail is a walking and bicycle trail that follows an old railroad bed along Brooke Street from south to north.  It begins at Dixie Street, just west of Brooke, and extends to Scott Street, near Lake Winnebago.
Neither of these trails have dedicated parking areas at the trailheads, but there is ample street parking.
