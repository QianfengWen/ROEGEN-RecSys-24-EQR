Marion Bay, Yorke Peninsula, South Australia.
On the 'foot' of Yorke Peninsula, Marion Bay is the gateway to Dhilba Guuranda–Innes National Park.


Understand[edit]
Being on the foot of the Yorke Peninsula, Marion Bay experiences high winds of a south-easterly nature during the summer months. The best times to visit are the months of March, April and May, when the winds die down and the seas are calm with a mild temperature. Summer months can become very hot and winters can be bitterly cold. Marion Bay has a moderate rainfall and generally does not receive as much rain as Adelaide or surrounding districts.

Connect[edit]
Cellular (mobile) telephone network reception may not be available in many areas especially those distant from cellular network repeater towers normally located along the major highways and near larger townships. Hilly terrain will also effect reception. In an emergency seek higher ground. Some networks provide a poor coverage in regional and rural areas. It is generally considered that the best reception is available from either Telstra or Optus when in areas such as Yorke Peninsula.
For emergency services, including police, fire services and ambulance, call 000 from any telephone and ask the operator to connect you. Such calls are placed without charge to the calling party.
