Nadi (pronounced as "Nandi") is the airport town on the west coast of Viti Levu, Fiji's largest island. However, there are still enough points of interest and things to do to spend a few days here before you get on board the ferries or helicopters to the smaller islands or head back home.


Understand[edit]
An aerial view of Nadi, approaching Nadi International Airport
Nadi is known as the point of transit for the rest of Fiji. The major airport was built here instead of the capital Suva because of its relatively drier climate. 
The main street of Nadi is Queens Road. It is where all the hustle and bustle is and connects the town with the rest of Viti Levu. As you walk around the town, shopkeepers will occasionally approach you and do their best to make you enter their shop. However, the sales staff are not very persistent nor threatening, so don't worry too much about it.
Often when there is traffic or road work going on at Queens Road, the best road to travel across the town is Nadi Back Road.
You may encounter an underlying air of ethnic tension between the Indian and native Fijian populations, but this rarely comes out in the open.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
-17.755278177.4433331 Nadi International Airport (NAN  IATA). It is the gateway to Fiji and handles almost all of the country's international passenger traffic. The airlines that operate at Nadi International Airport are Fiji Airways, Air New Zealand, Virgin Australia, Air Niugini, Air Kiribati, Nauru Airlines, Jetstar Airways, Korean Air, Aircalin and Solomon Airlines. Domestic flights arrive at the southern part of the terminal building. Several hotels have complimentary shuttles, which arrive and depart at a designated area.   
By bus and car[edit]
Nadi is a 4-hour bus ride or a 3-hour taxi ride from Suva. Buses stop at -17.803529177.4181212 Nadi Bus Station.

Get around[edit]
17°46′12″S 177°25′48″EMap of Nadi
Nadi has reliable local buses that let you explore the town and beyond. Just wave to the driver and you will be able to hop on from anywhere along the route. The comfortable, airy buses cost a fraction of that of a rental car. The bus clearly states where it is travelling from and to but you can also confirm with the driver. To get off, just ring the bell and the driver will stop anywhere along the route even if there is no official bus stop nearby.

Taxis are a convenient way of getting around with reasonable fares. Remember to haggle with the driver before getting in. It is a good idea to ask your tour guide or hotel on the typical prices between two locations. Alternatively, if you are patient and experienced with bargaining, ask multiple taxi drivers what they charge for key locations and haggle down the price.
There are hire cars available within the airport as well as in town. The internationally recognisable brands including Hertz, Thrifty, Avis, Europcar, and Budget are easy to find. There are local brands too though not all of them are reliable. In order to hire a car, you need to possess a valid driver's licence and, either be over 21 or 25 years of age (the precise age will depend on the rental service you use).

Stay safe[edit]
You may hear about some stories of scams and pickpocketing in Nadi. Crime is on the decline however, and whatever crime exists is mostly petty. There is a police station in the centre of Queens Road if you have any problems.
Although Nadi is on the drier, western side of Viti Levu, the climate is still very warm and humid. If you are walking around for a long time during the day in unshaded areas, it is likely that you will sweat profusely. As such it is important to stay hydrated and take regular breaks in shaded areas.
Most of Nadi's roads are well developed and maintained but you should be wary of a few big potholes on the smaller roads around the outskirts of town.

Go next[edit]
Hop on a local bus for $2 to Lautoka and visit a Fijian city away from the tourist eye.  The bus terminates at the local markets, where you can buy tonnes of fresh produce.
Head down south to Sigatoka and begin your journey along Viti Levu's famed Coral Coast.
Air conditioned buses go from Nadi International Airport to the capital Suva two times a day (at 7:30AM and 4PM). You can request the bus to stop at any points of interest along the route.
Many ferries suitable for days trip leave daily from Port Denarau just west of Nadi to the outer island groups such as the Mamanucas and Yasawas. The ferries start from 9AM to 4PM daily.
Venture east into the sparsely populated Nausori Highlands. Experience traditional Fijian village life while being surrounded by spectacular views.
