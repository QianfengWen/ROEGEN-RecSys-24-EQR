Ossining is the name of both a village and a town in Westchester County in the state of New York in the United States of America.


Understand[edit]
The village of Ossining lies within the township of the same name. As one of the smaller towns within Westchester County, Ossining is well known for its humbling diverse character. The variety of cultures, ethnicities, and socioeconomics has created a town that offers a unique glimpse of America’s melting pot. Along the Hudson River (just north of the Tappan Zee Bridge) and 30 miles north of New York City, Ossining is a great destination for those looking for a taste of metropolitan life in a suburban setting.

Traveling by car is the most convenient way to get around the town, as it also makes traveling to nearby locations more efficient. If you don't bring your own car, renting a car during a short-term stay may be helpful.
