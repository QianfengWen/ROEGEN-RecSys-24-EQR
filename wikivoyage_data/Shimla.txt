Shimla (Hindi: शिमला), previously spelt Simla, is the capital of the state of Himachal Pradesh in India. It is a very popular holiday retreat during the summer months and is well known for its Victorian architecture, which is reflected in certain areas of the Mall and the Ridge. It is also a famous holiday spot for honeymoon.

Christ Church on The Ridge

Understand[edit]
Shimla has a population of around 172,000 (which may increase by another 100,000 with the seasonal influx of voyagers). Most residents are from the Pahadi community (the natives of Himachal Pradesh), but there is also a sizable minority from Punjab and Sindh, who moved to Shimla during the partition. As a result, the languages spoken in Shimla include Hindi, Punjabi, Pahadi and English which serves as a lingua franca.
There are quite a few theories regarding the origin of the word Shimla. Locals insist that the name originates from Shyamali Devi, a reincarnation of the fearsome Goddess Kali.

Tourist information[edit]
There are two main official tourist information centres in Shimla, as well as a small office at the train station that isn't always open. The victory point office is less busy and helpful. It's also near where some government buses leave from.

All accommodation arrangements as well as any additional side trips, sightseeing, onward transportation, etc., can easily be arranged without the help of the touts. (Visit the office of the state-run Himachal Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (phone +91 177 265-2561 or 265-8302), located in the central place downtown called "The Scandal Point", before Christ Church on The Ridge (across from the City Hall), for any impartial information or guidance you may require: the staff there are well informed and reasonably professional. There are no alternatives to this office as the source of impartial, reliable information on all aspects of Shimla and on travel.

Orientation[edit]
The location is that of a majestic Himalayan perch above the searing plains. From the 1820s, the British started to build summer cottages on the ridges, and by 1863 Shimla was designated the summer capital of the Raj, from April to October, until 1947 - Mahatma Gandhi and Lord Mountbatten had their last pre-Partition talks here, actually. The higher levels of the town reflect this British connection, comprising mostly buildings in the Victorian style, while the lower slopes are occupied with Indian bazaars and restaurants. Traffic is banned from the historic central area, known as the Mall, which means that the atmosphere is calm and the air pristine.
Cart Road runs south of the Mall and is connected to it via the lifts. The Ridge, north of the Mall, is a good place to view the seven majestic hills of Shimla. Further along the same road is Lakkar Bazaar, which is a good place to buy some handicrafts and other souvenirs.

Climate[edit]
Shimla's cool climate is the precise reason why it is such a popular summer retreat. At an altitude of approximately 2,200 m above sea level, the region has a hilly terrain and is covered by dense evergreen forests. 
A few visitors choose to visit Shimla during spring or autumn, when the place is less crowded and the views are too spectacular for words.

31.1050977.185913 IGMC Bus Station (Indira Gandhi Medical College). This unremarkable bus station is for close destinations (+/-50 km) south (like Chail and Giripur), and east (like Kufri). (updated Aug 2023)
Government and private buses are available from Chandigarh to Shimla within a gap of half an hour. Deluxe and semi-deluxe buses are also frequently available from different places.
The bus from Mandi leaves around 9AM, for about ₹300 (as of Aug 2023).

By train[edit]
The Shimla Mountain Train
The nearest broad gauge station is at Kalka, a four-to-seven hour journey from Delhi. After that, take the mountain train from Kalka to Shimla. This railway track was granted the status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008. The view is stunning, with the line passing through an amazing 102 tunnels. The fastest way to get to Kalka is to catch the Shatabdi Express, which departs early morning from the New Delhi Railway Station, arriving at Kalka four hours later. A detailed list of trains between Delhi, Kalka and Shimla is available here.
You can also choose to get off at Chandigarh (en route to Kalka), and catch a taxi from there.

31.10460577.1734244 Kalka–Shimla Railway. Part of the  UNESCO World Heritage Site Mountain Railways of India.

By road[edit]
Shimla is nicely connected by road to different major cities.

By plane[edit]
31.08166777.0680566 Shimla Airport (SLV  IATA) (Jubbarhatti, 22 km away). Due to the difficulties of the mountainous terrain, poor condition of road surfaces and the increasing traffic congestion the journey by car can take hours. The airport has severe limitations imposed by its elevation, at 1,546 m above sea level, and by the shortness of its single runway (1,230 m) which ends in precipice at either end; it can accommodate only turboprop aircraft.   
After landing at the airport, take a pre-paid taxi to minimize hassle. Chandigarh is a good four-hour drive away, so stop for a bite on the Kalka-Shimla highway.
Jets can all land at the larger Chandigarh (IXC IATA) airport. Chandigarh Airport, 120 km from Shimla along far better roads and at an elevation of only 308 m above sea level, offers far better flight options. Major airlines including Air India and Air Deccan[dead link] operate flights to Delhi, Jammu, and Mumbai. Most of the flights to Mumbai require a stopover in Delhi. Confirm the flights as bad weather often delays flights during the winter fog.

Get around[edit]

Getting around in Shimla is easy as compared to other cities in Himachal Pradesh.

On foot[edit]
Most, especially downtown with the ridge, can be walked but due to the hills Shimla is on, it can sometimes be exhausting.

By bus[edit]
You can get a local bus from 7AM to 9PM for ₹10, and that too for any destination in the city.

By taxi[edit]
In case you choose to travel by taxi, it is affordable and convenient for sightseeing.

By tour[edit]
Apart from this, there are some tourist buses run by HPTDC every day for getting around in Shimla, e.g. from the Rivoli Bus Stop. As Shimla is known for its picturesque location and serene environment, you can also consider traveling some distance on foot. Inquire with HPTDC.

Jakhoo Hill[edit]
Jakhoo Hill is Shimla's highest point and the site of Jakhu Temple. The summit offers spectacular views of the town and its surroundings; on a clear day it is possible to see the snow-capped Western Himalaya about 75 km to the north. However, trees and vegetation somewhat obscure the views, preventing them from being truly panoramic.
The climb up from the Christ Church is a physically demanding 2-kilometre (1.2 mi) walk that takes 30–60 minutes depending on your level of fitness. Taxis are available to take you up the hill or you can drive yourself - 4WD is recommended - however, parking is limited at the top. Another option is the Jakhu Ropeway, an aerial tram located slightly downhill and east of the church.
The hillside and Jakhu Temple are populated with very aggressive and cunning monkeys. Be extremely careful with your camera, glasses, bag and (especially) food. (Sticks for warding off the monkeys can be rented at the entrance to the temple for ₹5).

Do[edit]
View of Cart Road and surrounding hills from The Mall
Take a leisurely walk at the Mall — this 7-km thoroughfare is famous for its Victorian Architecture, and retains much of its Raj-era charm. To get there, take the lifts from Cart Road, an ingenious system designed to save pedestrians from walking. ₹10 per trip. The central area of The Mall is composed of half-timbered buildings and is the place to rub shoulders and clash knives and forks with Shimla's elite. A statue of freedom fighter Lala Lajpat Rai is located at Scandal Point, the highest point on The Mall. Further along is the very pleasant Clarke's Hotel, which is an excellent place to take a break and relax over a coffee.
Ice skating is possible in Shimla from November to March, though Kufri and Chail on the outskirts of town offer better options.
Trek in the local mountains. Walk along the meandering roads to the meadows at Annadale, 5 km out of town. The Glen, further west, is a favorite picnic spot with locals. Head north and visit Wildflower Hall, the former retreat of Lord Kitchner. Furthur on along the Hindustan-Tibet Road lies the quaint village of Mashobra – A gravel-road indicates the entry to the Seog Wildlife Sanctuary. The annual Sipi Fair is held in a little steep pathway off Mashobra.
Tee off at the Naldehra Golf Course, on the northern outskirts of the town, at a distance of about 25 km from Shimla. The 9-hole golf course, set amidst sloping meadows at an elevation of 2,050 m above sea level, was designed by Lord Curzon in the 19th century. The flora is impressive, ranging from alpine grass to pine and deodar. But the tourists are not permitted to enter the golf course and they can only have a distant view of the golf course. There are two separate entries, one for walking and the other for horses, which lead to a vast ground surrounded by pine trees and golf course. It is better go up by own instead of taking horses and enjoy the serenity.
Kinnaur Kailash Parikrma Trek – Kinnaur is one of the most beautiful places but very less known district of Himachal Pradesh. This place is surrounded by Tibet, Garhwal Himalayan, spitti valley and Kullu. Sutlej River also flows from the Kinnaur valley. Tourists can experience a Buddhism life style, due to its proximity to Tibet.
 Paragliding, Junga Village. 9AM-3PM. At a distance of 25 km from center of Shimla, Junga village offers paragliding for adventure enthusiasts. ₹2,800. (updated Dec 2022)
Buy[edit]
Further down the Mall Road is the Lakkar Bazaar, which has quite a few shops selling wooden handicrafts. The Mall is full of shops selling woolens (most of which find their way to Shimla from Ludhiana, Punjab) and Kullu shawls. Other favorites have included wooden toys, walking sticks and Tibetan carpets made in nearby Kinnaur. As the centre of the food-processing industry in Himachal, jams and squashes made from local produce are indeed worth purchasing. The stretch between Combermere Bridge and the Telegraph Office is full of small stores which stock handcrafted Chinese shoes. The more well-known ones include Hopsons, Tatung and Hugh & Co.

 Himachal Emporium, 3 The Mall, ☏ +91 177 280-1234, fax: +91 177 265-3164. M-Fr 10AM-5PM. An excellent place to purchase locally made handicrafts at fixed prices. Run by the Himachal Pradesh Government.

Minerva Book House, Hotel Minerva, +91 177 225-2043. A good selection of novels.
Eat[edit]
Most of the restaurants in Shimla are cheap, comfortable, atmospheric and offer good multi-cuisine food. However, if you are looking for local cuisine, the options are surprisingly limited. Along the highway there are more than thirty restaurants, dhabas and fast food places.

31.104677.174291 Ashiana & Goofa, The Band Stand, The Ridge, Lower Bazaar, ☏ +91 177 545 0359. Daily 10AM-10PM. Whatever little can be had of Himachali cuisine can be found at these twin-restaurants run by Himachal Tourism, the one located above the other. The food is neither cheap nor the best in town, but it is safe and they otherwise do their best. A good spot for people-watching, the location within a circular elevated glass building has attracted comment in guidebooks: it lies in fact on the site of a historical structure, known as the Band Stand, which was a gift to the city made in 1907 by the ruler of one of the innumerable princely states of the pre-independence India (Jabalpur in what is today the state of Madhya Pradesh). Sit-in or takeaway. ₹50-150. 
31.1053877.170872 The Devicos, 5 The Mall (one storey beneath street level, directly below the Café Coffee Day outlet in the vicinity of the BSNL Building), ☏ +91 177 280-6335. 10AM–10PM. Serves good Indian food of every description complemented by some Chinese and Continental dishes; one of the very few restaurants in town with food appealing both to Indian and to Western palates. Good decor with what appears to be original art rather than reproductions. This is one of the most expensive places to eat in town apart from 5-star hotels, but seems worth it as far as Indian dishes are concerned owing to the lack of real competition. Its twin Bar, located upstairs is popular with locals. Adverse comment regarding food poisoning on the Lonely Planet website. ₹50–150. 
 Hotel Pinewood restaurant, Barog, ☏ +91 1792 238-825. Serves cheap Punjabi fare. 
31.1053977.171013 Indian Coffee House, The Mall (On Mall Rd, just down from the post office on the left). Possibly the cheapest food in Shimla, especially during peak season. They serve good south Indian food as well as surprisingly good western breakfasts, including a ₹40 French toast. ₹20–80. 
 Loveena Restaurant, The Ridge. Below rain shelter, restaurant with view. Indian, Chinese & Continental food. 
 The Lutyens Room, Springfields, Chhota Shimla (opposite Tibetan School), ☏ +91 177 222-1297, +91 177 222-1298. 11AM-10:30PM. Continental and Indian food. ₹150 and above.

31.1032577.156264 The Oberoi Cecil Restaurant, Chaura Maidan (in The Oberoi Cecil Hotel), ☏ +91 177 2804848. Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, although closes for breaks in between.. A good selection of European and Asian dishes. Chandeliers and wood-paneling add to the old-world elegance, a perfect setting for a quiet dinner, unless you have the misfortune to be seated next to an extended Punjabi family with unruly children. Disappointing breakfasts. ₹500–1,500. 
31.10527877.1765735 Sher E Punjab (Sher E Punjab), Ridge Sanjauli Rd (take road to Lakkar Bazar, 100 m from Ridge point.). 10AM–10PM. Home-style food at reasonable prices. The mixed vegetable dish with butter chappathi is recommended. ₹30–150. 
 Silver Oak, Circular Rd, ☏ +91 177 225-7588. 7AM–11PM. Serves Mughlai and Chinese. The food is not great, but passable. Nice decor and a comfortable atmosphere. ₹150. 
 Qilaa, The Mall Rd; below Syndicate Bank, near Scandal Point (On the way from Scandal Point to DC Office), ☏ +91 9736691209. 11AM–10PM. A favourite among frequent visitors and the locals. The interiors have been built keeping in mind the cold weather outside. There’s an instant feel of warmth and coziness. The food has a homely flavour. Good mezze platter and banoffee pie. 
Drink[edit]
Himachal is known as the fruit bowl of India. It has a thriving food processing industry that churns out fruit-based drinks, squashes and concentrates. The most famous flavors are plum, litchi, strawberry, mango and guava.

Alcohol[edit]
For alcoholic drinks, try the locally brewed wines such as apricot, plum and apple & ginger cider. In predominantly Tibetan areas, a rice wine known as Chang is popular.

 Lobby Lounge, Chaura Maidan. 24/7. The Lobby Lounge is in the soaring 5-story atrium of the Oberoi. A good place to enjoy tea or a quiet drink in an elegant atmosphere. A roaring fire in the winters adds to the colonial charm. Drinks ₹200-250. 
"Rendezvous" located less than a minute walk from Christ Church on The Mall, across from "Alfa Restaurant". Somewhat hidden, this restaurant/bar plays Bollywood tunes, a nice cozy interior and strong drinks.
Coffee[edit]
 Cafe Coffee Day, 5 The Mall (in The Devicos). 9AM–11PM. Similar to Barista, although not quite as good. Another branch at Mama's Kitchen NH22, Dharampur, Solan District. Cappuccino ₹120. 
 Indian Coffee House, The Mall. 9AM–11PM. Not as trendy as others it retains the charm of bygone era. Cheap coffee and town gossip make it a favourite with locals. 
 Fire Station Cafe, Indian Institute of Advanced Study. IIAS is the erstwhile Viceroy Lodge which is a Victorian era building. Has renovated its old fire station complex. The old structure which housed fire station, post office, squash court, and now swimming pool, besides a garage during British era was converted into a ‘Book shop-cum-souvenir shop’. Once you have completed the conducted tour you can relax over a cup of coffee or tea and soak in the environment.

 Clarke's Hotel (2,150 m above sea level), The Mall (100 metres as the crow flies across a small valley from the Himachal Pradesh High Court complex; 15 minutes' walk eastwards from Scandal Point), ☏ +91 177 265-1010, +91 177 265-1011, +91 177 265-1012, +91 177 265-1013, +91 177 265-1014, +91 177 265-1015, fax: +91 177 281-1321, reservations.clarkes@clarkesshimla.com. Check-in: noon, check-out: noon. Centrally located on The Mall; immaculately maintained heritage building, with guestrooms full of period charm and 'atmosphere' with views from windows over the southern valley of Shimla. The food does not begin to match the quality of the accommodation so if you stay, eat and drink out. From ₹6,500–9,000. (updated Jul 2018)
 Honeymoon Inn (Shimla Hotel), The Mall. This 20 room boutique hotel offers some attractive views. 
 Hotel Ashiana Regency (2,110 m above sea level), Chōṭā Shimla (or 'Little Shimla') (near 'The Secretariat' — the seat of Himachal Pradesh Government; 45 minutes' walk westwards from Scandal Point), ☏ +91 177 262-1572, +91 177 262-2472, +91 177 262-2658, fax: +91 177 262-4872,  +91 177 262-0037. Check-in: noon, check-out: noon. A decent place if you don't mind 45 minutes' walk along the wooded (and mostly pedestrian) Mall to town centre. Facilities include a public terrace with good views over the southern valley of Shimla, a bar, and a spa with a sauna and jacuzzi. The hotel restaurant is a moderate favourite with the locals. The immediate vicinity, in a densely built-up area called 'Chōṭā Shimla', lacks interest and recreational potential. ₹2,500–7,700. 
 Hotel Combermere (2,150 m above sea level at Circular Road level, 2,185 m at the top-floor level), The Mall (10 minutes' walk eastwards from Scandal Point; near The Lift, opposite the Indira Gandhi Sports Complex), ☏ +91 177 225-1246-47-48, fax: +91 177 225-2251,  +91 177 265-7906, hcs@sancharnet.in. Check-in: noon, check-out: Late checkouts on request. Although some of the suites are rather unreasonably priced, this remains a good option, mainly because of its convenient location. Facilities include a bar, good wi-fi in guestrooms (chargeable), a terrace garden, a gym and a spa. This is one of the only two hotels on The Mall equipped with its own private lift to the lower level of Circular Road (Cart Road), the other facility so equipped being the Landmark Hotel. Good food, professionally prepared, especially Italian (recommended). From ₹4,500–9,900; 2 Nights Package with meals ₹7,699. 
 Hotel Landmark (2,100 m above sea level at Circular Road level, 2,115 m at the top-floor level), The Mall (15 minutes' walk westwards from Scandal Point; near Gorton Castle, a historic property used nowadays for the offices of the Accountant-General of Himachal Pradesh and not open to the general public), ☏ +91 177 281-4700, +91 177 281-4701, +91 177 281-4703, fax: +91 177 281-4702, landmark.sml@gmail.com. Check-in: noon; early check-in available at extra charge, check-out: noon; late check-out available at extra charge. A good choice for those wishing to stay west of Scandal Point; decent views from some rooms over the northern valley of Shimla, including the helipad at Annadale, at an elevation of 1,865 m, directly across. New property with clean, modern facilities, marble bathrooms. Both the upper level of The Mall and the lower level of Circular Road (Cart Road) accessible by private in-house lift. Rooftop terrace, accessible directly from The Mall and open to the general public, hence not suitable for lounging. Food nondescript but passable. From ₹3,950–5,400. 
 Hotel Peterhoff (2,117 m above sea level), Chaura Maidan (45 minutes' walk westwards from Scandal Point), ☏ +91 177 221-3335, fax: +91 177 221-3801. Check-in: noon, check-out: noon. Nice, clean rooms with air-con, heaters, mini-bars and the usual mid-range amenities. Indifferent, uncaring staff, a common feature with government establishments. Owned and operated by the Himachal Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation, a state government entity. Not to be confused with the historic wooden property of the same name (Peterhoff) which was once the residence of the British Viceroy of India and which stood in the same spot until 1981, when it burned down: the present structure is not its recreation and, despite the retention of the name, is devoid of all period accents or character. Its large, soulless expanses cast in poured concrete are nowadays a frequent venue for conventions and group meetings. The food is terrible. Convenient location for those wishing to visit the Viceregal Lodge and the Himachal Pradesh Museum, but otherwise considerably out of the way with regard to town centre. Unforgettable views from the front lawn, ending abruptly in a precipice. ₹2,000-7,000. 
31.10460577.1734241 Woodville Palace (2,190 m above sea level), Raj Bhavan Rd (20 to 25 minutes' walk eastwards from Scandal Point), ☏ +91 177 262-3919, +91 177 262-4038, fax: +91 177 262-3098, woodville@woodvillepalacehotel.com. Check-in: noon. This converted palace was built in 1938 by the Maharaja of Jubbal, a descendant of the original owner still lives on the premises, and is addressed by the staff as "maharaja". It has its own private woodlands, which provide an excellent place for a leisurely evening stroll. Immaculately maintained public spaces, full of 'atmosphere'; attentive service; food on the homely side rather than haute cuisine. ₹4,000. 
Splurge[edit]
For travellers requiring luxury accommodation during their stay in Shimla, the advantages offered by The Oberoi Cecil, a luxury hotel of the Oberoi chain, as regards both the location and the in-house amenities, are unbeatable by any establishment in town. Their lesser-grade affiliate, The Oberoi Clarke's, another hotel of the Oberoi chain with a great ambiance and rich history, has the advantage of a more central location on The Mall, but its facilities in general and its cuisine in particular are not a match for The Cecil. A close runner-up to The Cecil in the luxury lineup is The Radisson Hotel Shimla, but its location in a low-lying locality known as Goodwood Estate, on Lower Bharari Road (which is in a state of shocking disrepair and dangerous to walk on), which is difficult of access and too out of the way for virtually all sightseeing to be done in Shimla, makes this otherwise swanky new hotel impossible to recommend except for those wishing to spend all their time within the confines of their hotel proper or who do not mind relying on the hotel's fleet of private cars to get to town and back (a relatively expensive proposition on a daily basis). Those preferring genteel seclusion would be much better served by Woodville Palace Hotel (see "Mid-range", above), accessible on foot from the centre of the town but located in a pleasant quiet woody cove requiring a 20 minutes' walk along The Mall to town, or the 14 km distant Wildflower Hall (see "Accommodation options outside of Shimla", below), a spectacular resort of the expensive Oberoi chain with its own mountain in a forested area outside of town, near the village of Charabra (accessible from Shimla by car only, available, at cost, at the hotel).

31.10905477.1790032 Chapslee Hotel, Elysium Hill, Longwood Rd, Near, Lakkar Bazar (between Lakkar Bazaar and Auckland House high school, just above much-trafficked Circular Road), ☏ +91 177 280-2542, fax: +91 177 265-8663. Check-in: noon, check-out: noon. Formerly the residence of the ruler of Kapurthala, still owns by the family. An attractive place even if the location isn't the greatest for access to town: to get to The Ridge requires making a steep ascent along dusty Lakkar Bazaar. Reminiscent of the days of the British Raj, with croquet lawns and mature gardens. Rooms have no keys and doors are left unlocked at all times. As part of this historic property has now been converted into a primary school the ruckus raised by children on their way to classes early in the morning can be disturbing. ₹9,500-12,500, Winter Surcharge up to ₹1,000. (updated Jun 2017)
31.10316377.1548973 The Oberoi Cecil (2,098 m above sea level), Chaura Maidan (takes a pleasant and easy 20-minute walk from town centre to get there), ☏ +91 177 280-4848, fax: +91 177 281-1024, reservations@oberoi-cecil.com.

Check-in: noon, check-out: noon. One of the best hotels in Shimla, with most of the five-star facilities, located on the outskirts of town, though with great views of The Ridge and the surroundings 800 m across the Shimla valley. You can see the places you want to be in from your window even if you cannot easily get to them. Pleasant public spaces; good value buffet dinners. from ₹7,000. (updated Jun 2017)

Stay safe[edit]
Beware of greedy monkeys which may attack anytime to grab food from your hands. Don’t make any eye contact with them. Try to ignore them while passing by. Any abrupt move from your side may pass the wrong message on these creatures.
Sometimes, temperature goes below freezing level, especially during winter season. So travelers are advised to carry appropriate clothing.
Do not exchange the currency/money in black market. Ask for receipt when exchanging money at any authorized establishment.

Touts[edit]
Avoid touts at all cost, whether locals or outsiders (many are in fact Kashmiri chisellers disguised as locals, and calling themselves euphemistically "guides", who have been working the Shimla beat for years and decades); they scour the railway and bus stations for incautious or vulnerable looking victims among the new arrivals, and foreigners carrying luggage are their prime targets in the streets as well. The experience of being "led" by an unscrupulous but ingratiating manipulator with his own interest in mind rather than yours can be the ruin of one's visit to Shimla. The touts can be extremely importunate and persevering in pursuit of their illegal trade while at the same time feigning "friendship" intended to ensnare the gullible. If you allow them to lead you to your hotel you will be manipulated in manifold ways:

Your daily room rate will surreptitiously be inflated to cover the commission they will receive from the hotel for their unnecessary services (resulting in an increase in hotel price of as much as 200%).
The touts will, unbeknownst to you, steer you away from hotels which do not give commission but which may be better for you.
You will subsequently be pestered by your tout, who will now "own" you during your stay, to buy additional "services" from him.
Give being additional misinformation.
