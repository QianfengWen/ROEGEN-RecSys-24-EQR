Kemer is a tourist resort in Lycia on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey, about 40 km southwest of Antalya. It's the largest of a string of resort villages, with a total population in 2022 of 49,383. 


Understand[edit]
The Lycian coast here is rugged and hemmed in by mountains. In ancient times a string of little ports developed, linked by sea as there was no road access. That limited their value commercially and militarily, so they never grew large. They were also vulnerable to pirate raids, and mostly abandoned in the Byzantine era. 
The area only developed from the 1960s when the coastal highway D400 was blasted and tunnelled through the hills. That put Kemer within an hour of Antalya airport, and larger passenger jets plus promotion of Turkish tourism led to a boom. There is nowadays a well-developed tourist strip, which north to south encompasses Beldibi, Göynük, Kemer itself, Kiriş, Çamyuva and Tekirova. Arslanbucak and Kuzdere are residential districts inland from Kemer. Çıralı the southernmost village is part of this municipality but described on a separate page as  Olympos. 
The Kemer strip has many west European tourists but in the 2020s mostly caters to Russians, to the extent that hotel and restaurant staff are more likely to know Russian than English.
