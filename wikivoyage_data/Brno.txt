Brno (pronounced Burno) (German: Brünn, Štatl in the local dialect) is the major city of Moravia (a historical region in the Czech Republic). It is the largest city in Moravia and the second-largest city in the Czech Republic by population and area. It was founded around the year 1000; and since the 14th century, the city served as the capital of Moravia. Brno is the heart of Moravia and its cultural hub; it's home to many institutions related to Moravian history and culture. At the same time, Brno represents the administrative center of the contemporary South Moravian region. It has a population of around 380,000 people, and it's in a beautiful natural environment between South Moravian vineyards and the Moravian Karst.

The New Town Hall (don't be fooled by its name, in fact it's very old)
The city was founded about 1000 years ago, it received city status in the year 1243, and for centuries it served as the capital city of Moravia, until 1948 when communists abolished Moravia's autonomy. The city flourished mainly during the 19th century. Today's Brno is a mixture of many different architectural styles, there are many beautiful places. But it remains home to significant cultural offerings, and countless beautiful buildings, the city has the third largest historic preservation zone in the country (the biggest one is in Prague, the second in Olomouc). There are three castles, Špilberk (former royal castle, and former seat of rulers of Moravia), Veveří Castle (near the Brno reservoir), and Líšeň Castle.
Brno is not particularly well known by tourists so you can easily avoid crowds and overpriced services.
Brno is the cultural hub of Moravia, it's the home to several notable Moravian institutions, e.g. Moravian Gallery, Moravian Museum, National Theatre Brno, and Brno City Theatre. It's a city with a long tradition of motor racing (on the Masaryk Circuit), huge exhibitions and trade fairs (in the Central European Exhibition Center), and a vibrant university city. There are about 89,000 university students in Brno, a city with 380,000 inhabitants, which makes it the country's largest student city by percentage of population. Since 1998, there has also been an international firework competition held annually at the end of May and beginning of June – Ignis Brunensis, it attracts about 100,000–200,000 visitors every day it's being held.
The most interesting places in Brno include the Brno Underground, a labyrinth of underground cellars which includes the second biggest ossuary in Europe (after the Catacombs of Paris), the two (or three) castles in Brno, the cathedral on the Petrov hill (Pope Benedict XVI visited the cathedral in 2009), the Basilica of the Assumption of Our Lady in the Old Brno District, the St. Jacob's Church, the Moravian Museum (the biggest museum in Moravia and the second biggest in the country), Lužánky Park which is the oldest public park in the country, Denis Gardens, and various historical squares, churches, palaces, and other interesting buildings.
There are also many places worth visiting outside the city centre, such as an old Jewish cemetery in Brno-Židenice (by area, the biggest one in Moravia), or the Marian Valley in Brno-Líšeň, a cascade of lakes between forested hills. From the north, Brno is surrounded by hills and very pleasant countryside, the most notable place is probably the Moravian Karst.
Brno lost its capital city status but still has the feel of a 'cosmopolitan' capital, there is a rich variety of cultural events, clubs, pubs, etc., and several excellent museums and theatres. There are also two interesting things about theatres in Brno, Reduta Theatre is the oldest theatre building in Central Europe, and Mahen Theatre (part of the National Theatre Brno) was the first theatre anywhere in Europe to be illuminated by Thomas Edison's electric light bulbs (at that time, it was only a four-year-old invention). Brno also serves as the capital of judicial authority of the Czech Republic (it's the seat of the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Administrative Court) and many other state authorities, the rest of it is located in Prague.

By car[edit]
Using highways - D1 highway from Prague and Ostrava or using any of the national roads, D2 from Bratislava or D52 from the south (it runs towards Vienna, but ends about 25 km ahead of borders). For the highway, you have to buy a toll sticker.

By bus[edit]
There are coach services from various European destinations including Prague where frequent buses run touting assorted amenities and stops (such as Prague Airport). A timetable of all buses (including international) can be found on IDOS.
Two main bus stations are used. A few hundred meters north of the train station is 49.1934216.614442 Benešova street, at hotel Grand, used e.g. by RegioJet (formerly Student Agency). A much bigger but also much more remote station 49.1858416.616553 Central bus station Zvonařka is used by local and international buses. Usually buses only stop at one of the stations, check your ticket which one it is upfront.

 Student Agency. Offers service with free coffee, newspapers, and movies to everyone. Brno is the main hub and buses travel across Europe, and are known for their high quality. Vienna €8. 
 Tourbus, a.s.. Also based in Brno and serves many destinations and is particularly cheap to some international destinations. Vienna €5. 
 Eurolines CZ/Touring Bohemia, s. r. o.. International and domestic routes. Some services include free newspapers, magazines and bottled water, some even have Wi-Fi. Book ahead for the best price. 
Taxi[edit]
Try to avoid getting a taxi on the street (public transportation is always the better option in Brno) and if you have to, try to negotiate the price in advance. For taxis hailed on the street, the maximum price set by the city council is 30 Kč/km.
It's advisable to call one of the major Brno Taxi services:

Lido Taxi, +420 542 214 221 . (30 Kč/km)

By plane[edit]
49.154816.69264 Brno-Tuřany Airport (BRQ  IATA). Although it has few destinations, it is highly convenient and boasts an extremely impressive structure. Those interested in modern architecture may want to visit even if they are not lucky enough to fly into the airport.

 Student Agency. 9 direct daily coaches from this airport. It is much cheaper to use local public transport in Vienna to Stadion (station of metro line U2) and catch the same coaches from there, for some reason the trip to the airport costs double, so it is much cheaper to take the Austrian public transportation. €16. 
 Tourbus, a.s.. 1–2 direct daily buses from the airport. €8.60. 
By boat[edit]
An unconventional, but beautiful way to get to Brno (well, from just outside town) is to take a boat from the village of Veverská Bitýška, which takes you (in the summer season only) on a trip across Brněnská přehrada (Brno dam lake) to Brno-Bystrc.

Tram near the Main train station
The Integrated Transport System of the Southern Moravia Region (IDS JMK) covers public transport over Brno and the whole Southern Moravia Region; it includes local trains, trams, buses and trolleybuses. Daytime transport ends up at 23:00, the night buses go hourly and have a central transfer node at Main Station. Some night buses have a connection to night buses in the region, so you can get from Brno at night to surrounding villages.

Tickets are available at yellow ticket vending machines at bus and tram stops, and also at railway station counters.

Brno has a system called Beep&Go, where every bus, trolleybus and tram in the city has a terminal for contactless ticket purchases using your credit card, smartphone or smart watch. This has since replaced purchasing tickets from the bus driver. It costs the same and the ticket is then stored virtually on your card/phone. You can also purchase tickets for people travelling with you or tickets for more zones. When a ticket controller comes, you have to use your device on a special reader that they will present to you. You need to use the same device you used to purchase the ticket, because services like Google Pay or Apple Pay create virtual credit cards when paying. 
South Moravia Region is divided into tariff zones. Brno consists of two zones. IDS JMK tickets are valid in all buses and local trains (category Os, Sp and R), the price varies on number of zones you travel over.

Eat[edit]
Czech food is mostly based on pork, dumplings and potatoes. Another Czech favorite is smažený sýr, fried cheese, which is available at many restaurants and fast food stands.

A good option is to visit one of the many pubs or restaurants that usually offer traditional Czech food all day long. You could easily find a restaurant where you get a meal and a drink for around €5, even in the city center. Many of these places also offer cheaper special (limited, pre-prepared) menus at mid-day. Cafés offer a nice selection of rolls and pastries if you're looking for breakfast food. Visit the cukrárna near the House of the Four Idiots on nam. Svobody and try a rakvička ("little coffin", small pastry covered with cream). This is the only place in the Czech Republic to find the chocolate ones.

Drink[edit]
The traditional Brno beer is Starobrno, and a traditional non-alcoholic soft drink is kofola (a very different but captivating kind of cola). Both must be tasted in draught form! Although Czechs are famous for their love of beer that love is mostly focused on pale beer, dark beer (černé pivo) is sweet and not very often drunk here. There's quite a few small breweries in the city, among them a small private brewery named Pegas, a block west from the steeple of St James Church (sv. Jakub). The pub is equipped with modern brewing technology, beer is made right in front of the guests' eyes. For a list of other breweries look at this list.
The go-to bar is the cramped and smoky Charlie's Hat (known to most locals simply as Charlie's), east on Koblizna street from the north end of Freedom Square (50 Kč entry, includes drink voucher). A cluster of more down-tempo bars frequented by students can be found along Dominikánská (Kavárna Trojka - students caffee and bar) and Starobrněnská just west of the Zelný trh (cabbage market square). Around the main square, you can find a lot of clubs, pubs, restaurants, coffee houses and lounge bars.
