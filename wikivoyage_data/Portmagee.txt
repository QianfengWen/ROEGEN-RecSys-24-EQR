Portmagee is a fishing village on the Iveragh Peninsula of County Kerry, with a population in 2016 of 123. In Irish it's An Caladh, "the ferry", because it was the port for Valentia Island, but a bridge now spans the channel. 
The main N70 "Ring of Kerry" road around the peninsula bypasses Portmagee. A side-loop called "Skellig Ring" winds through the village then along the top of Kerry Cliffs to St Finian's Bay and Ballinskelligs, rejoining the N70 at Waterville. All those small places and Valentia Island are described on this page.
Boat trips are the main reason to visit Portmagee. The star attraction is the remote isle of Skellig Michael, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, but you need to be lucky with the weather.


Understand[edit]
Route of the 1858 transatlantic cable
Connect?? Turns out you can't improve the line speed on a narrow-band connection by simply ramping up the voltage along the wire. But the 1850s were pioneering days in long-distance telecoms, so it has to be chalked up as a bold but not-to-be-repeated experiment.
In those days it took two weeks or more to convey a message between Europe and North America - the fastest a mail boat could sail. But the telegraph had been invented and Morse code adopted as a signalling protocol, and cables were laid from England to France and to Ireland, and from the Canadian mainland to Newfoundland. These were technically and financially challenging, but a transatlantic telegraph cable was the obvious next development.
The first attempt started from Ballycarbery Castle near Caherciveen in 1857 but ended in failure, and a second in 1858 almost led to the project being abandoned: the cable kept snapping. But they persevered, with two vessels working outwards from mid-Atlantic, and in early August that year the cable reached Trinity Bay in Newfoundland and Knightstown on Valentia Island. After several days of test messages the line was declared open, and Queen Victoria sent a 98-word congratulation on the project's completion to US President Buchanan. It took 16 hours to send.
William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) devised a mirror galvanometer that could detect very faint telegraph signals, but Whitehouse the pig-headed chief electrician insisted that the answer was more voltage. And more, and more! The cable only lasted a month, with 732 messages passed, before it burned out. It could withstand high voltage if the insulation was intact, but the slighest damage (easily acquired during cable-laying) ensured a terminal bang!
But the concept had been demonstrated, materials and technology had meanwhile improved, and in 1865 the Great Eastern began laying from Valentia Island. 1698 km later, the new cable snapped and was lost. Back home we go. But a further attempt in 1866 not only laid a complete transatlantic cable, but recovered the previous year's lost cable, lost it again, recovered it again, several times over before splicing it and completing it. So Valentia Island and Newfoundland were now linked by two transatlantic cables each capable of eight words per minute - that's how you improve line speed.

Get in[edit]
Portmagee and bridge to Valentia Island
Local Link Bus 287A runs from Caherciveen to 51.886-10.3631 Portmagee then crosses the bridge to Chapeltown and Knightstown on Valentia Island. There are 2-3 on Tu, Th and Friday. Bus 287B runs from Caherciveen to Dromid and Ballinskelligs twice M and W.
Local Link Bus 285 runs from Killorglin to Glenbeigh, Caherciveen, Waterville, Caherdaniel and Cahercove. There are two or three daily on the Caherciveen-Waterville section, but only one or two at the ends of the route. 
By road follow N70, the Ring of Kerry route - usually from Tralee or Killarney (the nearest railway and inter-city bus station) via Killorglin, but you could approach via Kenmare and Caherdaniel.
51.925-10.2872 Valentia Island Ferry sails from Reenard's Point near Caherciveen to Knightstown on the island, a 10 min crossing. It's a small ro-ro sailing Mar-Sept daily 08:00-21:00; it shuttles continuously, no booking. Fares are €5 single per car and passengers, €8 return; cyclist €2 single €3 return, pedestrians €1.50 single €2 return. But from Portmagee you simply reach the island by the bridge.

Get around[edit]
51°50′42″N 10°18′36″WMap of Portmagee
You can get around Portmagee and across the bridge to the Skellig Experience on foot. 
See above for the Local Link bus across Valentia Island. There's no public transport along the Skellig Ring road: you'd have to take the bus into Caherciveen then come out on the bus for Waterville and Ballinskellig, and take all day about it.
Bicycles can be hired in Caherciveen, a pleasant enough ride via road or the ferry.

Anti-clockwise round the Ring of Kerry brings you next into Derrynane, Sneem and Kenmare. From there you can turn north to continue the circuit to Killarney, or go south onto Beara Peninsula and Castletownbere, or head inland to cross the hills towards Macroom and Cork.
Clockwise you soon reach Caherciveen, birthplace of Daniel O'Connell and with two sturdy ringforts. Carry on east for Kerry Bog Village and Killorglin, where the road forks for Killarney or Tralee.
