By plane[edit]
The closest airport to San Carlos is in Guaymas (GYM  IATA), but as of 2024 it serves only private aircraft. The best airport for commercial flights is Hermosillo (HMO IATA) (officially, but never called "General Ignacio Pesqueira García International Airport"). Hermosillo is served by AeroMexico, Delta, and Volaris via Mexico City, Monterrey, and Guadalajara. From the U.S., Hermosillo is served by American Airlines via connections through Phoenix.

After about 5 hours, you'll pass through the city of Hermosillo. There are plenty of hotels, restaurants, and gas stations here if you're planning a highway break. From Hermosillo, continue south on highway MEX-15 another 3 hours and you'll reach San Carlos. There are tolls along the way and tolls must be paid in cash, which means pesos, not dollars or any other foreign currency.
