Bad Bevensen is a spa town in Lower Saxony on the Lüneburg Heath.


Understand[edit]
Bad Bevensen lies in a gently-rolling landscape on the North German Plain. The region is characterized by potato, sugar beet and grain farming, by forests, small heaths, the valley of the Ilmenau and the Elbe Lateral Canal.
The River Ilmenau flows through the town and the Elbe Lateral Canal runs past it to the east.
The town was first mentioned in the records in 1162, but was not given town rights until 1929. It has been officially recognised by the state as a mineral health spa since 1976. There are up to 6 large rehabilitation clinics around Bad Bevensen and many of the town's facilities and businesses are geared up to catering for rehabilitation patients. This tends to give the town a slow, relaxing pace of life.
