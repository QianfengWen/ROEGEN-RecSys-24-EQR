Diekirch is a town of 6,800 people (2018) in Luxembourg, best known for its brewery of the same name and the National Museum of Military History.


Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Diekirch is located along the N7, which is a continuation of the A7 highway which runs from Luxembourg City and Mersch to the north. The N7 connects to Clervaux and Troisvierges in the north, and Ettelbruck (where it becomes the A7) in the south. When travelling from the banks of the Moselle (anywhere between Schengen and Echternach), travel downstream the Moselle and Sauer via the N10, switching to the N19 in Reisdorf.

By public transit[edit]
Diekirch can be reached by train in about 50 minutes from Luxembourg City. There are direct trains every hour (except on Sundays), but usually you'll need to transfer to a shuttle service at Ettelbruck as the 49.86486.1541 Diekirch train station is located at an awkward branch from the main line, with it being the only station on the branch.
Busses connect Diekirch to Beaufort, Colmar-Berg, Echternach, Ettelbruck, Grevenmacher, Larochette and Redange.

Get around[edit]
Diekirch can be easily covered on foot. The town center with the pedestrian zone Grand-Rue (Groussgaass) is about 1 km away from the train station. The Military Museum is in the Bamerdall just up the hill from the central church towards Fridhaff.

49.87096.15931 National Museum of Military History (Musée National d'Histoire Militaire), 10 Bamertal, ☏ +352 80 89 08, reception@mnhm.lu. Tu-Sa 10:00 to 18:00, : closed. The museum was born from the initiative of a small group of collectors and history buffs and opened its doors 1984 in the old brewery of Diekirch. Over the years, the collection has witnessed a constant influx of objects. At first, the museum was mainly meant to cover the Battle of the Bulge, but an additional permanent exhibition on the Luxembourg Army was opened in 1994. With the opening of this new part, the museum got its current name, "Musée National d’Histoire Militaire", or MNHM for short by ministerial decree. Today the museum is run by a non-profit organisation and subsidized by the state. The museum's main attraction are its 1:1 scale dioramas. These are mostly detailed and realistic reproductions of scenes from the daily life of soldiers and civilians during the Battle of the Bulge. The largest diorama (150 m2) shows the crossing of the Sauer river on January 18, 1945 by units of the 5th US Infantry Division, in order to liberate the city of Diekirch. In addition to the dioramas, the museum has a large collection of military equipment and soldier's personal belongings, as well as a selection of Allied and Axis military vehicles and artillery that were used during the Battle of the Bulge. €5, optional audioguide €3.
