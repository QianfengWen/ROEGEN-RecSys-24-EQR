Understand[edit]
Most visitors to Rømø rent a cottage for one or two weeks. But it is also possible to stay in hotels or Bed & Breakfasts for a day or two. And if you are in South Jutland it is worth it to go to Rømø for a day trip.
The attraction of Rømø is the spectacular nature: the heather, the enormous beaches, the Wadden Sea.

Bus No. 285 leaves from Skærbæk train station and stops at Lakolk, Nørre Tvismark (The Havnebyvej/Vesterhavsvej intersection), Kongsmark, and Havneby. It is also the school bus, so it runs 9 times a day on schooldays but only two or three times on weekends and school holidays. On schoolday the bus also stops in Toftum and Juvre.
