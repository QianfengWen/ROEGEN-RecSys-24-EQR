Sidney is a town in Montana.  In 2020, 6,300 people lived there.


Understand[edit]
The area is near large oil reserves and has experienced several boom and bust cycles. These bring in an influx of people to the town, some staying for a short period of time. The town has surges in oil exploration activity. The entire region has had substantial increase in population. This has brought a tremendous increase in the economy, the population and crime.
Sidney is home to a sugar beet refinery. In the fall the refining creates a lingering odor over the entire town. It's not exactly unpleasant, just odd smelling.
