Santa María del Río is a town in San Luis Potosi. It calls itself the cradle of the rebozo, staking a claim to one of Mexico's most well known textile handcrafts. The town is one of Mexico's Pueblos Mágicos and has a charming city center with two large plazas, some beautiful colonial churches, canoeing and kayaking on the river, and some fascinating remains of colonial-era haciendas.


Understand[edit]
The town's populations is about 12,000 people. If you include all the farms and villages of the greater municipality, the population of the whole area is almost 40,000.

History[edit]
Santa María del Río got its name from a Spanish viceroy in 1589, when it was still a small, young town. The area was originally home to the Guachichil, but experienced an influx of Otomi people following the conquest. The first group of Spaniards to make an imprint on the area were the Franciscan missionaries who evangelized the area in the early 16th century. The Franciscan convent was built in 1604. 
During the 18th century, several haciendas developed the area's agricultural industries, as well as the mining industry. The town was known for its cinnabar (mercury ore) deposits.  

Geography[edit]
The town lies along the Santa Maria River in a dry, mountainous area on the western edge of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range. It is a scenic area with waterfalls, slow moving waters, caves, and woodlands. Thermal springs at Balneario de Lourdes are a source for bottled mineral water.
