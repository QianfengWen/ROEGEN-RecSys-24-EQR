Boggabri (population 856 in 2016) is a village in the New England region in New South Wales, Australia.


Understand[edit]
Court house, Boggabri
Boggabri is on the Kamilaroi Highway between Gunnedah to the south and Narrabri to the north. Boggabri was built 20 km to the south in the 1830s, but the settlement was relocated after a flood to its present site in the 1860s. The European explorers John Oxley (in 1818) and Allan Cunningham (in 1827) passed through the area. John Clarke, an escaped convict from the Hunter region, had settled with the local Aboriginal people by 1826. The first farm in the district was established by 1835. The name of the village comes from the Gamilaraay word bagaaybaraay, meaning "having creeks", possibly referring to the nearby Namoi River. Wheat, wool, and cotton are farmed in the district, and there are large reserves of coal nearby. Boggabri is in the Narrabri Shire Local Government Area.
