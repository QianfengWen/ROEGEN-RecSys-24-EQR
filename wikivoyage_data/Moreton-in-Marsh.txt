Understand[edit]
Redesdale Hall
The town and nearby countryside are low lying and flat given how the town is considered to be in "Cotswold Hills Country". The "Moreton" from the town name means "Farmstead on the Moor".
The town's architecture is typical of the area, buildings being constructed of local cotswold stone.

Maintained by the National Trust since 1991, when it was acquired from the last representative of the family who had owned the house since it was first built. It is one of England’s finest and most complete Jacobean houses, filled not only with a mixture of rare and everyday objects, furniture and textiles collected since its completion in 1612, but also with the atmosphere of 400 years of continuous occupation by one family. The gardens have a typical Elizabethan and Jacobean layout with a ring of fascinating topiary at their heart and it was here in 1865 that the rules of modern croquet were codified. Since acquiring the property, the Trust has concentrated on conserving it rather than restoring it to a pristine state.

Adlestrop is one of the more attractive of Cotswolds villages, the more so on account that it is far less frequented by mass tourism than many other neighbouring towns and villages. The novelist Jane Austen was a visitor (her uncle was the church rector) and is thought to have drawn inspiration from the village and its surroundings for Mansfield Park. Also associated with the evocative Edward Thomas poem.
