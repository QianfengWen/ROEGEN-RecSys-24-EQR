Chittorgarh, also spelled Chittaurgarh, is in the southern part of Rajasthan, lies on the Berach River, a tributary of the Banas, and is the administrative headquarters of Chittorgharh District. It is 112 km from Udaipur and 182 km from Ajmer. The city served as a capital to the Sisodia clans of Rajputs of Mewar for a long time. The district is a famous tourist destination for its massive fortress, claimed to be the largest of all Rajput forts, and has witnessed the legendary tale of Queen Padmini's act of jauhar that fascinates many historians and travellers.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Historically, the Chittorgarh fort was built by the Maurayans in 7th century A.D. Some accounts say that the Mori dynasty was in possession of the fort when Bappa Rawal, the founder of the kingdom of Mewar, seized Chittorgarh (Chittor Fort) and made it his capital in 734 AD. Some other accounts say Bappa Rawal received it as a part of the dowry after marriage with the last Solanki princess.
The first attack was by Alauddin Khilji in 1303 A.D., who was enamoured by the beauty of Padmini of which he had only heard. Rani Padmini preferred death to abduction and dishonour and committed Jauhar (an act of self-immolation by leaping into a large fire) along with all the other ladies of the fort. All the men left the fort in saffron robes to fight the enemy unto death. Chittorgarh was captured in 1303 A.D. by Alauddin Khilji, Sultan of Delhi who led a huge army. Elderly people then had the responsibility to raise the children. It was recaptured in 1326 A.D. by the young Hammir Singh, a scion of the same Gehlot clan. The dynasty (and clan) fathered by him came to be known by the name Sisodia after the village where he was born.
By the 16th century, Mewar had become the leading Rajput state. Rana Sanga of Mewar led the combined Rajput forces against the Mughal emperor Babur in 1527 A.D., but was defeated at the Battle of Khanua. In 1535 A.D., Bahadur Shah, the Sultan of Gujarat, besieged the fort, causing immense carnage. It is said that again just like in the case of Jauhar led by Padmini in 1303 A.D., all 32,000 men then living in the fort donned the saffron robes of martyrdom and rode out to face certain death in the war, and their women folk committed Jauhar, led by Rani Karnawati. The ultimate sacrifice for freedom, Jauhar was again performed for the third time after the Mughal Emperor Akbar captured Chittorgarh in 1568 A.D.
Chittorgarh is also famous for its association with two very widely known historical figures of India. The first is Meera Bai, the most famous  Hindu spiritual poetess whose compositions are still popular throughout North India. Her poems follow the Bhakti tradition and she is considered to be most passionate worshipper of lord Krishna. 
Chittorgarh remains replete with historic associations and holds a very special place in the hearts of Rajputs, as it was a bastion of the clan at a time when every other stronghold had succumbed to invasion. The fort and the city of Chittorgarh also host the biggest Rajput festival, "Jauhar Mela". It takes place annually on the anniversary of one of the Jauhars (though not the one by Padmini which is most famous). This festival is to commemorate the bravery of their Rajput ancestors and all three Jauhars which happened at Chittorgarh. A huge number of Rajputs, which include the descendants of most of the princely families, do a procession to celebrate the Jauhar.

Chittorgarh Fort[edit]
View from top
The fort (Admission Fee: ₹40 for Indian nationals, ₹600 for foreign tourists), plainly known as Chittor, was the capital of Mewar and is today situated several kilometres by road south of Bhilwara. Today it's one of the hill forts of Rajasthan inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. It sprawls majestically over a hill 180 m (591 ft) in height spread over an area of 280 ha (692 ac) above the plains of the valley drained by the Berach River. A winding hill road of more than 1 km (0.6 mi) length from the new town leads to the west end main gate, called Ram Pol, of the fort.
Within the fort, a circular road provides access to all the gates and monuments located within the fort walls. The fort that once boasted of 84 water bodies has only 22 now. These water bodies are fed by natural catchment and rainfall and have a combined storage of 4 billion litres that could meet the water needs of an army of 50,000. The supply could last for four years. These water bodies are in the form of ponds, wells and step wells.
The fort has seven gates (in the local language, gate is called "Pol"), namely the Padan Pol, Bhairon Pol, Hanuman Pol, Ganesh Pol, Jodla Pol, Laxman Pol and the main entry gate of Ram Pol (Lord Rama's Gate). All the gateways to the fort have been built as massive stone structures with secure fortifications for military defense. The doors of the gates with pointed arches are reinforced to fend off elephants and cannon shots. The top of the gates have notched parapets for archers to shoot at the enemy army. A circular road within the fort links all the gates and provides access to the numerous monuments (ruined palaces and 130 temples) in the fort.
Chittorgarh Fort is a large space, and visitors may find it useful to compartmentalise the different sections.

The Palace of Queen Padmini. It is widely believed that this glimpse of Padmini's beauty on the water area mesmerised Ala-ud-din Khilji to destroy Chittor which eventually led to Jauhar.
The Chittorgarh Victory Tower
24.89686774.6491481 Kirti Stambha (Tower of Fame). Kirti Stambha ("Fame Tower") is a 22 m (72 ft) high tower built on a 9.1 m (30 ft) base with 4.6 ft (1.4 m) at the top, is adorned with Jain sculptures on the outside and is older (probably 12th century) and smaller than the Victory Tower. Built by a Bagherwal Jain merchant Jijaji Rathod, it is dedicated to Adinath, the first Jain tirthankar (revered Jain teacher). In the lowest floor of the tower, naked figures of the various tirthankars of the Jain pantheon are seen in special niches formed to house them. A narrow stairway with 54 steps leads through the six stories to the top. The top pavilion that was added in the 15th century has 12 columns.

This palace, a white building, a three storied structure (a 19th century reconstruction of the original), is located in the southern part of the fort. Chhatris (pavilions) crown the palace roofs and a water moat surrounds the palace. This style of palace became the forerunner of other palaces built in the state with the concept of Jal Mahal (palace surrounded by water). It is at this Palace where Alauddin was permitted to glimpse at the mirror image of Rani Padmini, wife of Maharana Rattan Singh. It is widely believed that this glimpse of Padmini's beauty besotted him and convinced him to destroy Chittor in order to possess her. Maharana Rattan Singh was killed and Rani Padmini committed Jauhar. Rani Padmini's beauty is compared to that of Cleopatra and her life story is an eternal legend in the history of Chittor, in particular and of the Mewar state in general. Entry Free.

The palace included elephant and horse stables and a temple to Lord Shiva. Maharana Udai Singh, the founder of Udaipur, was born here; the popular folk lore linked to his birth is that his maid Panna Dhay saved him by substituting her son in his place as a decoy, which resulted in her son getting killed by Banbir. The prince was spirited away in a fruit basket. The palace is built with plastered stone. The remarkable feature of the palace is its splendid series of canopied balconies. Entry to the palace is through Suraj Pol that leads into a courtyard. Rani Meera, the famous poetess saint, also lived in this palace. This is also the palace where Rani Padmini, consigned herself to the funeral pyre in one of the underground cellars, as an act of jauhar along with many the other women.

The heat in Chittorgarh can be torturous and one would need sufficient sun protection such as shades and caps.

Wear a strong pair of shoes while climbing the Chittorgarh Fort to avoid getting hurt and spraining your ankles.
The monkeys at the fort generally do not harm anyone but always keep a safe distance as they are unpredictable creatures. Besides be careful while resting under a tree as some monkey sitting above might just drop their excreta on you!
The fort is massive and hiring bicycles would ensure that your exploration of the place is not as tiring. One could get lost in the fort, so make sure that you travel in groups and with local guides.
