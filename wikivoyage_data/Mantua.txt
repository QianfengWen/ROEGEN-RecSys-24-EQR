Palazzo della Ragione
Mantua (Italian: Mantova, Lombard: Mantua) is a world heritage listed city in Lombardy, Italy not far from Emilia-Romagna and Veneto. Because of the power and influence of the Gonzaga family, which used to own the city for over 400 years, Mantua was considered one of the most important cultural cities in the Renaissance and it maintains a lot of the buildings that made it famous during that period. 


Understand[edit]
Mantua was where the composer Claudio Monteverdi premiered his opera L'Orfeo (1607), the earliest opera that is still regularly performed.
Mantua was named "Capital of Italian culture 2016".
In 2022, it had a population of 49,000.

Via Verona you can get to Mantua from Venice, Brescia, Trento, Bolzano and via Modena you can reach Parma, Reggio Emilia, Bologna and all southern cities.
If you want to arrive from Bologna quickly, so you don't want to use the railway line Verona-Modena and change the train, a good idea would be to get the train on the Verona-Bologna line to the Nogara station, 20 minutes away by car from the city centre of Mantua.

Brescia, Sirmione, Peschiera del Garda, Mirandola are also cities served by this company. To know timetables and fares the easiest way is to use Google Maps which, thanks to a collaboration between Apam and Google, it's very accurate in timetables and routes.

By car[edit]
Mantua is crossed by the  motorway (Autostrada del Brennero), that runs from Modena to Brenner. The best choice to reach the centre is the exit of Mantova Nord, just 5 km (3 miles) north of Piazza Sordello.
