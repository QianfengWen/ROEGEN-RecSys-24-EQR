North West River (sometimes spelled Northwest River) is a small town of 560 (in 2021) settled by Europeans in 1743 as a fur trading post in Labrador, about 40 km (25 mi) northeast of Happy Valley-Goose Bay (HVGB). The town sits on the western foreshore of Lake Melville, which is connected to the open ocean via Hamilton Inlet.

History[edit]

What is now a tiny town, founded in 1743 as a French fur trade post, is the oldest community in central Labrador (Cartwright was settled in 1775; Goose Bay and Churchill Falls, founded as a wartime air base and a generating station, are relative newcomers.). Before European settlement, what is now North West River was settled by the Indigenous Innu and the Maritime Archaic peoples for 7,000 years.
When Labrador became a British territory, the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) was established in North West River in 1836, superceding the earlier French fur trading post. HBC had basically maintained a monopoly on fur trade until the Second World War when the industry collapsed. Many trappers then worked for the air force in Goose Bay.
The International Grenfell Association operated a hospital and a boarding school in the community from 1915-1981. There's one local craft shop and a convenience store; local outfitters offer guided tours and scenic walking trails lead through forests, along the waterfront, and up to the top of "Sunday Hill" with a panoramic view of Lake Melville, the Mealy Mountains, Grand Lake and Little Lake.

Geography[edit]
North West River is surrounded by Lake Melville to its east and Little Lake to its west. To the town's south is a small narrow strip of water connecting Little Lake and Lake Melville, leaving the mountainous north as the only direct land passage making NW River a small sandy peninsula. However, due to the mountainous terrain to the north, in addition to the lack of major settlements, the only road that leads to NW River crosses Little Lake towards Sheshatshiu, an Innu reserve. This road then continues southwest to Happy Valley-Goose Bay via a small strip of relatively flat land.

Climate[edit]
North West River generally has cold winters and mild summers with winter temperatures averaging between −10 and −15 °C (14 and 5 °F) (between November and April), while summer temperatures average in the tens (i.e. 10 to 20 °C (50 to 68 °F)), though temperature extremes occasionally happen and can either plummet to −30 °C (−22 °F) or be as high as 30 °C (86 °F). The rainest month is July, with the town averaging 480 mm (19 in) per year, while the snowiest months are between December and March, averaging 400 cm (160 in) a year.

Local information[edit]

Get in[edit]
North West River is approximately 40 km northeast of Goose Bay on Route 520 across the river from Sheshatshiu, an Innu community. It's been the most north-eastern accessible point on North America's main road network since the river was bridged in 1980. Onward travel beyond North West River in winter is by snowmobile trails north to Mulligan and Postville; there's also a seasonal trail from Mulligan to Rigolet. These trails are groomed but include some dangerous ice crossings.
The Labrador Coastal Ferry Service does not stop by North West River, but instead stops at Goose Bay, from where you'll need to take Route 520 northeast to visit North West River.

Get around[edit]
