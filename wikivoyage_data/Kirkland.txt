Not to be confused with Kirkland (Quebec).

Kirkland is a city of 93,000 (2019) in King County, Washington near Seattle.


Understand[edit]
Established in 1888 by Peter Kirk with a vision of being the "Pittsburgh of the West", Kirkland today is a charming town on the east side of Lake Washington across from Seattle. It is the home of Northwest University, one of two summer training camps for the Seattle Seahawks, the other being Eastern Washington University in Cheney.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Like many American suburbs, by far the most convenient approach is by car:

 State Route (SR) 520[dead link] connects Kirkland to Seattle, via the Evergreen Point floating bridge on Lake Washington. The bridge is tolled, hence less busier than Interstate 90. SR-520 serves as the southern border between Kirkland and Bellevue.
 Interstate 405 (I-405) is the outer loop of Interstate 5 that runs from Lynnwood to Tukwila (and the airport), through Bellevue. Keep in mind that rush hour traffic can be very daunting: expect a 45 minute to 1 hour drive from both ends of the freeway to Kirkland.
The more modern and capacious   Interstate 90 (I-90) provides another route from Seattle across Lake Washington, via Mercer Island to reach I-405 in Bellevue.
By bus[edit]
Intercity bus services from beyond the region stop in Seattle.

Get around[edit]
The downtown area is small and very walkable.  A car is helpful for convenient travel, especially after normal working hours, as bus service outside of downtown Seattle is not always frequent.
