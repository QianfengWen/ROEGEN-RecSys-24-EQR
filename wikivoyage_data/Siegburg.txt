It is on the banks of the rivers Sieg and Agger, 10 kilometres away from the former capital Bonn and 26 km away from Cologne. Siegburg is at the base of a "mountain" (St. Michael's Mount, about 40 m elevation), filled with picturesque cobblestone streets and traditional buildings. Although not being a major tourist location, you could enjoy a short visit to the old city center while traveling along.
