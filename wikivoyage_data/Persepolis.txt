Persepolis
Persepolis [dead link] is a historical site 60 km north of Shiraz, in Fars province. It was the ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BC), inscribed in the UNESCO list in 1979.


Understand[edit]
The World Heritage Listed centre of the great Persian Empire, ceremonial capital of the Achaemenians and the showpiece of Achaemenian art, Persepolis (Capital of Persia in Greek) is a historic site in Fars Province, 60 km to the northeast of Shiraz. Iranians call it Takht-e Jamshid (throne of Jamshid), Jamshid being the first, probably mythical, ruler of Iran. This magnificent court was the summer residence of the Achaemenian emperors and their official reception quarters. It must be by some strange accident of history that Persepolis was never mentioned in foreign records, for it was here that representatives of all the varied peoples of the empire gathered to pay homage, and bring tribute, to the King of Kings, probably each spring, at the time of the ancient Nowruz festival. Although set on fire and destroyed by Alexander the Great in a gesture symbolizing the destruction of Persian imperial power, its still impressive ruins permit a fairly complete reconstruction of its original appearance.

There is no public transport going to Persepolis. The closest city reachable by public bus is Marvdasht, 14 km away from Persepolis, from there one needs to charter a taxi to the site. The main highway bypasses Marvdasht and Persepolis and thus all long-distance buses go past them.

By bus[edit]
Minibuses (45000 rials) or a shared taxi (80000 rials) going to Marvdasht  can be found at Ali Ibn Hamze Terminal in Shiraz. Besides, almost all of them make a stop or start their way from the bus stop near Qur'an Gate in Shiraz.
There is an anecdotal information that buses stop going from Marvdasht to Shiraz somewhere in the afternoon.
