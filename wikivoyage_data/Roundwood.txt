Roundwood is a small village in the hills of County Wicklow in Ireland, with a population in 2016 of 948. Its Irish name is An Tóchar, "the causeway" which probably refers to the approaches to the nearby monastic centre of Glendalough; but the main reason to be here is to hike its trails. Roundwood's key role in Irish life is to supply Dublin with water.


Understand[edit]
Vartry Reservoir
"... and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes...." (James Joyce, Ulysses, III Eumeus).
In the 19th century Dublin outgrew its water supply and sewage system, and became filthy, so a scheme was established to bring water from the Wicklow mountains. A first reservoir was completed at Roundwood in 1863, damming the River Vartry, and a second higher-level reservoir was completed in 1923. Their combined capacity is 18 billion litres: water is piped "raw" to Stillorgan in the south of the city, where it's treated and put into supply. The river retains plenty of water and flows to the sea at Wicklow Town. 
James Joyce took a great interest in the works and the political shenanigans involved. (One opposition faction was the backers of the Grand and Royal canals, who'd ruined themselves to build transport routes that could never compete with the railways, but that undeniably brought water into Dublin. Canal water.) In one of several references in Ulysses (set on 16 June 1904) Stephen Dedalus casually asks if there is a decent flow from the tap — Vartry water having a better head of pressure — and in reply he's given a voluminous description of the scheme. In the passage quoted above, Leopold Bloom prefers pure Vartry water to less reputable sources, but since there's none to be had, he and Stephen venture out (none too steadily) in search of other drink, deep into a Dublin dark night of the soul.
Joyce didn't spend much time here and soon emigrated to Trieste, but two Presidents of Ireland had links to Roundwood. Seán Thomas O'Kelly (1882-1966) was second President 1945-1959. He had a country residence in Roundwood, but it burnt down in 1957. Erskine Hamilton Childers (1905-1974) was fourth President from 1973 but died in office after a year, and is buried in the nearby Church of Ireland churchyard at Derralossary. His father Robert Erskine Childers, author of The Riddle of the Sands, was executed by firing squad in 1922 for illegal possession of a pistol.

St Kevin's Bus runs twice a day from St Stephen's Green in Dublin, via Cabinteely,  Bray (for DART trains), Kilmacanogue, Roundwood and Annamoe to Glendalough. The morning run allows a day-trip with four hours to explore Glendalough, or you can take it as a point-to-point bus. 
Local Link Bus 183 runs 4 or 5 times a day from Wicklow Town via Ashford and Rathnew to Roundwood. It continues to Annamoe, Laragh, Glendalough, Blessington, Naas and Sallins railway station. 
By bike, the Dublin suburbs are ratty so take the train as far as Bray. There are two steep hills early on, after that it's level yet scenic.
By car from Dublin follow M11 / N11 past Bray and exit at Kilmacanogue onto R755. Follow signs for Glendalough, which will take you through Roundwood.

See[edit]
The Bullaun is the stone mounted in village centre at the junction of R755 and R765. A bullaun is a stone with a basin worn in it, sometimes naturally, or by use as a mortar for grinding. It collects rainwater which is supposed to have holy or healing powers. Such stones are often within church precincts, and the Roundwood bullaun may have come from a church that has disappeared, but its present setting is misguided - it's been mounted on a pedestal, so it looks like an artsy but modern bird-table.
Church of St Laurence O'Toole is the RC parish church. It's neo-Gothic, completed in 1871.
53.0855-6.21911 Victor's Way, Sally Gap Rd, Mullinaveige A98 F640. May-Sep daily noon-6PM. Indian sculpture garden, which also describes itself as a "pantheist monastery", enjoyable as much for its flapdoodle as its Ganeshes and stupas. It's a contemplative space for adults, okay? Not a fun park for families, no sir! Wear stout shoes, the site gets soggy, and definitely no drones even if they go Ommmm . . . . Adult €10. (updated Jun 2024)
53.1376-6.3122 Sally Gap is the scenic R759 through the mountains into west Wicklow, a popular motoring or cycling route. It branches off R755 two km north of Roundwood to ascend past the corrie lake of Lough Tay, the usual start point for climbing Luggala. Strictly speaking "Sally Gap" means the crest of the ridge at 503 m (1650 ft), the crossroads with the old military road R115, with Kippure looming to the north and Gravale and Duff Hill to the south. R759 then descends west into the valley of the River Liffey, and the landscape becomes pastoral towards Blessington and the reservoir lake of Poulaphouca.
