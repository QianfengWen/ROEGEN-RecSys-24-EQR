Polmont is a village five miles east of Falkirk in Stirlingshire in central Scotland. It's mainly a commuter village for Edinburgh and Stirling. 
Grangemouth just north is a busy port and petrochemical town, also described on this page.


Understand[edit]
Grangemouth Refinery
Polmont had a population of 5040 in 2020. The name derives from Gaelic Poll-Mhonadh, "pool of the hill", and it was a small farming settlement on the coast-to-coast lowland route. The Romans had marching camps here as they campaigned against the Picts, and later built the Antonine Wall. The railway and the road to Stirling and the Highlands also came this way. Not much happened in Polmont until the 1970s, when it was developed as a commuter town and grew to its present size.
Grangemouth had a population of 16,120 in 2020. It began as a tiny port at the outlet of the Grange Burn, expanding from 1768 when the Forth and Clyde Canal established its east terminus here. As well as canal traffic it handled coal and iron exports from central Scotland, and imports of Scandinavian timber. The harbour was poor compared to Leith, but closer to the mines and foundries and charging lower harbour fees. From mid-19th century Grangemouth handled oil and petrochemicals: the shale-oil industry of West Lothian collapsed once cheap imports arrived from Arabia and Persia, but the workforce had relevant skills. This grubby town also produced most of Scotland's soap. Distillers set up in business, to discover that heating oil and petrol were even more lucrative than whisky.
Grangemouth Refinery was created in 1924 to process Arabian crude oil, and the owners Scottish Oils eventually became part of British Petroleum, nowadays BP. In the 1950s a 58-mile pipeline was built to Finnart on the west coast near Garelochhead. Initially this brought in crude oil from a tanker terminal for refining here, and later a reverse pipe was built for refined exports. In the 1970s Britain developed oil and gas fields in the North Sea, and in 1975 a pipeline opened from Forties offshore oil field to Kinneil near Grangemouth. These assets are nowadays owned by Ineos, which in turn is 50% owned by China. The vast industrial complex dominates town, with its metal towers and flares and snaking pipes. It's in gradual decline as vehicles and other processes switch to electric power.

55.9772-3.67355 Almond Castle is a ruin all the more sorry for its surroundings, the brownfield site of a former brickworks. Formerly called Haining Castle, it's an L-plan tower house built in the 1470s; it was extended in the 16th century but those additions have been lost. The owners backed the Jacobites in 1715 so the castle was forfeited to the crown and abandoned. It's been teetering on the edge of collapse ever since so don't get close, one sneeze could dislodge a brick from the barrel-vault roof and bring the entire edifice down on you.

 Polmont rail disaster 
On 30 July 1984 the Edinburgh to Glasgow express hit a stray cow on the line half a mile west of Polmont station. It derailed then concertinaed, killing 13 and injuring 61. The train was a push-pull, so westbound towards Glasgow it was pushed by the rear locomotive. This meant the lead coach with the driver was light and more prone to jump the tracks. Subsequently all similar vehicles were fitted with deflectors - cow-catchers - so that obstructions would be shovelled aside rather than go under the wheels.
