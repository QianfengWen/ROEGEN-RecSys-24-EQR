Pelee Island (pee-lee) is a 42-km² (16-sq mi) island in Lake Erie and the southernmost populated point in Canada (with 235 residents in 2016). Nearby Middle Island is the southernmost point of land in Canada. It sits at the confluence of two bird migration routes – the Atlantic Flyway and the Mississippi flyway. The island is a significant stopover site for many species of birds and insects (like monarch butterflies). Birding is a popular pastime and draw for tourism as well as the annual pheasant hunt on the island.


Understand[edit]
Vineyards
The island has long been used for vineyards and wine making. The wine industry was started here in 1860 and died out in the early 20th century, but was restarted in the 1980s by the Pelee Island Winery. The island is an agriculture-based community which grows about 2,000 hectares (5,000 acres) of soybeans, about 400 hectares of wheat, 200 hectares of grapes, and a few hectares of specialty corn.
Pelee Island is a popular tourist destination, with thousands of visitors each year.

History[edit]

Evidence of occupation by indigenous peoples can be dated back 10,000 years through archaeological evidence of projectiles and ceremonial objects. European settlement of the island began in 1788 when the land was leased to Thomas McKee by the Ojibwa and Odawa tribes. William McCormick bought the island in 1823 and the McCormick family settled permanently in 1834. In addition to subsistence agriculture, the island's lumber, stone quarries, and fishing supported inhabitants. Wine-making on Pelee Island began in the 1860s.
Pelee Island features an original 1833 lighthouse that was once used to guide sailors through the rocky Pelee Passage. Lake Erie is full of shipwrecks; Pelee Passage alone contains the remains of at least 15 shipwrecks. One wreck that is particularly close to the island, JJ Carroll, is just 100 feet (30 m) off the eastern shore of Fish Point.
Pelee was the site of a battle during the Patriot War. The Battle of Pelee Island took place along what is now the Michigan-Ontario border in 1838 involving small groups of men on each side of the border seeking to "liberate" Upper Canada from the British. On February 26, 1838, 300 men captured the island, and on March 3 they were repulsed and either fled the island or were captured.

Climate[edit]
Due to its southerly location and the moderating effect of Lake Erie, it has a slightly milder climate than inland areas. Its climate is one of the mildest in Canada.
Winters are cold with a January average of −5.0 °C (23.0 °F) and the average annual snowfall is 76 cm (29.9 in), which falls mainly from November to April. Summers are warm and humid with a July high of 27.5 °C (81.5 °F) and a low of 18.9 °C (66.0 °F). Temperatures rarely go over 32 °C (89.6 °F), averaging 4 days per year. Pelee Island and Point Pelee receive the fewest days with precipitation in Ontario, averaging 75 days with measurable precipitation, and drought-like conditions occur every 4–5 years. The average annual precipitation is 891 mm (35 in) which is evenly distributed throughout the year with January and February being the driest months
