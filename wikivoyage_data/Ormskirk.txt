Ormskirk is a market town in Lancashire, 13 miles north of Liverpool. With a population of 24,000 in 2011, it's the main town of West Lancashire Borough.
Skelmersdale is a "New Town" 6 mi (9.7 km) east, created in the 1960s. It's larger, with a population of 39,000, but is mostly just residential and industrial. 
The rest of the Borough is a quiltwork of fields and villages extending north to the Ribble estuary, with a total population of 111,000.


Understand[edit]
Both towns are modern yet their names are Old Norse: Ormskirk means "Ormr's church", perhaps a foul-breathed fellow, since Ormr was a serpent or dragon. It stands on a sandstone ridge above soggy fields, reclaimed from wetland in the 18th and 19th century. Skelmersdale (usually just called Skem) means "Skjaldmarr's dale". Skem and Ormskirk grew from the 19th century when the Lancashire coalfield was exploited, and farm smallholdings became market gardens and dairy farms to supply the burgeoning cities, with milk churns clattering away early mornings on a leash of railways.
After the Second World War Britain's housing was in poor condition, and the population was booming. A series of "New Towns" were hurriedly built, sometimes greenfield and sometimes around an existing town core — for practical purposes Skelmersdale was greenfield. The positives were that it re-housed a great many people swiftly and inexpensively, to a far better standard than they'd enjoyed even before the Luftwaffe re-arranged their old abode. The downside was samey, ticky-tacky centreless burbs, with no community feeling, and an in-built assumption that everyone would get around by cars made in Britain.
The area suffered from the late 20th century economic slump. West Lancashire didn't itself have traditional textile or metal-bashing industries, but depended for its prosperity on nearby towns that did. It kept going and continues to eke a livimg from retail, local government and education. In 1974 the Borough of West Lancashire was created, with Ormskirk and Skem its towns. Edge Hill Teacher Training College became a university in 2006, with its main campus in Ormskirk.

53.5692-2.88771 Ormskirk Parish Church (Church of St Peter and St Paul), Church St, Ormskirk L39 3RD, ☏ +44 1695 572143. This Anglican church is from 1170, on the site of a Saxon church; the carving set in its east wall probably originated there. Unusually, it has both a tower and a spire, from 15th century though later rebuilt. The Scarisbrick chapel is also 15th-century and the Derby chapel (resting place of eight Earls of Derby) is 16th, but the nave was re-done in Gothic in the late 19th century. The exterior is Perpendicular Gothic.  (updated Apr 2022)
The Roman Pillar at the entrance to Coronation Park is not a Roman souvenir, but a fancy Doric pillar that was chucked out, along with much else, when the Victorians rebuilt the parish church.

(updated Apr 2022)
