See[edit]
Glockenspiel
 The Mt. Angel Glockenspiel (corner of Charles and Garfield streets). This 49-ft glockenspiel is part of the Edelweiss Village Building. Performs at 11AM, 1PM, 4PM, and 7PM, sometimes stopping traffic. 
 Oktoberfest. Held every September. The festival brings in traditional German Bands for an evening filled with glass clanking camaraderie and energetic, foot-stomping alpine music. Take your pick between 4 Bier Gartens or Wine Garten. Fastastic hot sausages permeate the air, fresh Oregon Ice Cream sundaes, pastries, onion petals with chipotle sauce all are delicious. The largest Glockenspiel in the United States is a real show-stopper.
