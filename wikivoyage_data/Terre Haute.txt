Terre Haute is a city of 61,000 people (2019) in west-central Indiana, about 180 mi (300 km) south of Chicago and 1 hour southwest of Indianapolis. Terre Haute is one of the largest cities in the Wabash Valley and is known as the "Queen City of the Wabash". The city is home to several higher education institutions, including Indiana State University, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, and Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana.


Understand[edit]
Downtown Terre Haute, looking southwest
The name "Terre Haute" is French for "high land" and refers to the area's history from the French colonization of the Americas as well as its geography next to the Wabash River. Though the city limits exclude some of Vigo County, the metropolitan area includes the nearby towns of West Terre Haute and Saint Mary-of-the-Woods.
Terre Haute's history reaches back to the early 1800s with the construction of Fort Harrison as a permanent settlement within the Indiana Territory.  The city grew up primarily around industry and river traffic on the Wabash River.  The growth of the railroads and a short-lived oil boom contributed to the city's prosperity, but the decline of both, along with the Depression, resulted in the city becoming a model of Midwestern urban decay up through 1980s.  Since then, mayors have worked hard to reverse this image, and have begun making gains in turning the city back around.

Get in[edit]
Map of Terre Haute


By plane[edit]
Most people in Terre Haute and the surrounding regions use Indianapolis International Airport[dead link], which is a 1-1½ hour drive east of the city on Interstate 70. Rental car services to Terre Haute are available at the airport.
Terre Haute is served by Terre Haute Regional Airport, but there have not been any commercial flights from there since 1999.

By car[edit]
Vigo County Courthouse
There are three main highways which run through the city: Interstate 70 running east to west through the south of the city (near Honey Creek Mall); U.S. 41 (known locally as Third Street) oriented north-south; and U.S. 40 (also known as Wabash Avenue) as the road which separates the north and south parts of the city. U.S. 40 splits near the central business district. The westbound traffic turns onto Cherry Street, and the eastbound traffic runs into Ohio Street. In the event of an accident on the interstate, traffic is often re-routed through U.S. 41 and 40.

By train[edit]
Catch-A-Train [dead link] provides highway service to the Mattoon Amtrak station for trains to Chicago.

By bus[edit]
Greyhound provides service to Terre Haute, with daily buses departing from Indianapolis and St. Louis.

Get around[edit]
Automobiles are generally the easiest ways of traveling in Terre Haute. Pedestrian travel is the best on the north portion of the city (including Wabash Avenue), but several of the cross-streets on Third Street have short traffic signals. While there is no "rush hour" like those seen in larger cities, during the afternoon and early evening, the south end of town on U.S. 41 can become hectic. Also, many people cannot manage to drive the speed limit.  Bicycling is becoming increasingly popular due to the heightened gas prices, although cyclists should use caution when riding, as bike lanes and paths are still few and far between. Sidewalks are usually the preferred paths for bikes, but some of the sidewalks on secondary roads are in poor condition. This is being improved by the city.

By car[edit]
The general speed limit on the streets is 30 miles per hour (48 km/h). Wabash Avenue and Third Street have a slightly higher speed limit. Terre Haute has several train tracks which run through the city, so becoming "railroaded" is a common occurrence. Construction is ongoing around the central business district.

By public transit[edit]
Terre Haute is served by a public bus system, which runs Monday through Saturday from 6AM to 6PM. Routes run throughout the city, including several shopping centers. There are tenuous plans to have midnight routes which will serve the local bars and universities. Single-trip fares are $1.75, 14 trip passes are $21, and monthly passes are $45.  Although the bus system is growing, the quickest, simplest method of traversing Terre Haute is still by car.

Stay safe[edit]
Terre Haute is generally a safe city, but the same precautions for any other city apply here.  Don't go out alone at night, don't flash money around and avoid the sections of town without streetlights, as crime tends to be higher there.
Although it is on the edge of Tornado Alley, Terre Haute does experience severe thunderstorms and the occasional tornado warning. Most of these occur in the spring and summer but there have been severe weather events in other months. There are sirens near Indiana State University, but they can only be heard within a mile of the campus. It is usually recommended to tune into local television or radio stations if there is a chance of severe weather.
Connect[edit]
By phone[edit]
Most telephone numbers in Terre Haute consist of +1 812 plus a seven-digit number, but the entire 812 area is now served by an overlay complex of two area codes, with 930 being the second. A local or in-state telephone call now requires all 10 digits of the local number be dialed (omitting just the leading +1 from a local landline call).
Signage on many established businesses may still display the original seven-digit numbers; dial 812 before these if no area code is indicated.
