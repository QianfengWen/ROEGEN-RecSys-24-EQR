Kutaisi old town
Downtown Kutaisi
Kutaisi is a city in the Rioni Region of Georgia. The city itself is very cinematographic and charming, and a visit to Kutaisi is almost mandatory to see the Bagrati Cathedral and Gelati Monastery, which are UNESCO World Heritage sites and offer views from the mountain slopes over the city and the Rioni River.


Understand[edit]
Kutaisi is the traditional rival of Tbilisi for capital status. Since the days of the Golden Fleece, Kutaisi has been considered the capital of Western Georgia (then Ancient Colchis). It is Georgia's third largest city (after Tbilisi and Batumi), but, to the irritation of the proud locals, it does not come even close to Tbilisi's present size and wealth. Nevertheless, Kutaisi is more respectful of pedestrians than Tbilisi. Its sidewalks are generally even and flat with very few cars parked on them, whereas in Tbilisi pedestrians are often forced into the streets because of cars sitting on sidewalks. Kutaisi drivers generally stop in front of crosswalks to let pedestrians cross, whereas in Tbilisi pedestrians have to be in the middle of the street to get a car to slow down for them.
Since the Georgian Parliament moved to Kutaisi in 2012, there has been a lot of work on restoring streets, buildings, parks and monuments in the city, and it has become much safer. There seems to be a bit more variety in the materials, facades, and designs of the buildings along Kutaisi's streets. In Kutaisi as in Tbilisi, a look up to the second floor can reveal balconies of elaborate ironwork. Kutaisi's central park is a nice (and safe) place to sit and watch people.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
42.18142142.4656931 King David the Builder International Airport (KUT  IATA), Kopitnari, 14 km west of Kutaisi proper on the main S1 highway. Relatively small airport that has second terminal in construction. It has around 160 flights per month during low-season and 240 during high-season. The airport services domestic flights to Tbilisi and several international flights.There is a space where you can lie down underneath the inclined windows right after the arrival exit inside the terminal. This can be good for spending the hours (sleeping) before or after an early/late flight.There is a money exchange bank counter at the airport, but the ATMs also give small notes down to 5 lari. Bank of Georgia charges a 2 lari fee for some cards without indicating beforehand.   (updated Apr 2019)

Getting there/away[edit]
Marshrutka – Many go by the airport, heading east to Tbilisi (by Kutaisi), or west to Zugdidi, Batumi, Poti, Samtredia, etc. The prices for theses more distant destinations are pretty much like from Kutaisi itself (see prices below). Most marshrutkas will not go into the airport lane, so just head to the highway, 100 m from the airport, and hail them there. From the airport to Kutaisi it is 2 lari, not more!
Those from Kutaisi bus station towards Batumi, Poti, Zugdidi or Samtredia will also drop passengers off at the airport. But it depends on the mood of the driver, whether he is will take any short-distance passenger. Nevertheless, there are always more than enough marshrutkas going this way. Just wait at the 42.2573442.670632 crosswalk, where they come out of the station and go west. Here you will also find the ones that come from the east and do not enter the bus station but directly continue after a short stop. It should not take longer than 10 min to find a ride.
From Tbilisi, a marshrutka from the Didube bus terminal to the airport is 20 lari. It is also possible to walk out of the airport onto the highway and hail a marshrutka if headed to a particular destination.
Having said that, at night the options become more sparse and you might have to resort to the shuttle buses. Ask the tourist information or your hotel or hostel beforehand.
Shuttle Bus – Georgian Bus and Omnibus Express provide bus service between the airport and Kutaisi city center, Tbilisi and Batumi, with bus schedules following flight arrivals. Shuttle buses to Tbilisi (20 lari, 4 hr) terminate at Freedom Square, while shuttle buses to Batumi (18 lari, 3 hr) terminate at the Radisson Blu Hotel. Shuttle buses to Kutaisi city center (5 lari) will stop at any address within the city. Tickets may be purchased online or upon arrival with cash or bank card at the Georgian Bus counter located near the exit, and when returning to the airport, may also be purchased directly from the driver. If you're riding the Georgian Bus service from Kutaisi, you must e-mail them with the name of the hotel from which you will be picked up from.
Train:
(several times per day) Kopitnari railway station is 2 km away. Walk east along the main road. Only regional trains stop here (Direct destinations: Kutaisi, Batumi, Zugdidi). The station has a very friendly countryside climate with staff always positively surprised to see foreigners. Expect to be greeted with local stuff. Tickets are very cheap, 2 lari to Batumi as of March 2019. However, the trains are old Soviet trains and occasionally catch fire (worth the experience but as a rule of thumb they're twice as slow as the road). The new station appears to be up and running.
(several times during the day and 1 overnight) A way via Samtredia train station which is 13 km away (or Rioni, which is 30 km away). Hail marshrutka (couple of lari) or taxi (20 lari) to Samtredia. Overnight train to Tbilisi (departs around 01:00, arrives to Tbilisi 06:30), 20 lari. Besides overnight train, there are daytime trains (around 10:00, 13:00, 20:00 and takes 3-4 hr). Buy train tickets beforehand, because there might be no free beds/seats.
By train[edit]
42.1987742.709693 Rioni station, Kutaisi-Baghdati-Abastumani-Benara road (7.3 km south of Kutaisi, marshrutka #3 connects from the center, plaza and Kutaisi I—the bus stop is up the stairs at the main road, or take a taxi for ~6 lari). 09:00–14:00 and 19:00–22:00 (ticket office). This is the preferred train station to get to/from Kutaisi, because all trains going from West to the East or vice versa always stop at Rioni station. For this reason there are many more trains (day and night) from Rioni than from Kutaisi I (Batumi-Tbilisi, Poti-Tbilisi, etc.). While searching for tickets you should choose Rioni station as destination/departure point. 
42.2614742.71294 Kutaisi I, Tamar the Queen street (თამარ მეფის ქ.) (10-15 min walk from the city center along Tamar the Queen street). This is the main station in the eastern half of the city, but away from the main bus station in the west. It serves Tbilisi and 2 regional destinations: Tkibuli and Sachkhere (for Chiatura). 
Tbilisi – Ticket costs 9 lari (as of Nov 2020), 5 hr, 3 times daily. All trains from and to Tbilisi Station Square (next to the Station Square metro station) leave from and arrive at the Kutaisi I station. The train also stops in Mtskheta (the old capital of Georgia and Orthodox heart of the country), Gori (the birthplace of Stalin and home of the Stalin Museum) and Zestafoni. It is a relatively comfortable journey because passengers can stand and stretch and walk the length of the wagon) but slow due to long, intermediate stops, including one at Rioni, right outside Kutaisi. There are bathrooms on board (but bring tissue, just in case). There is no cafe or dining car, so bring water and snacks, too.
Train 633 – Kutaisi I-Sachkhere – 05:30-08:55, return: Train 634 – Sachkhere-Kutaisi I – 10:10-13:30
Train 635 – Kutaisi I-Sachkhere – 16:05-19:25, return: Train 636 – Sachkhere-Kutaisi I – 20:05-23:25
Train 6323 – Kutaisi I-Tkibuli – 09:25-12:20, return: Train 6324 – Tkibuli-Kutaisi I – 13:05-16:26
Train 6325 – Kutaisi I-Tkibuli – 18:15-21:10, return: Train 6326 – Tkibuli-Kutaisi I – 05:30-08:51
42.2566942.669165 Kutaisi II station (southwest; from this station getting a cab is an option, 4-5 lari to any part of the city). Train from Tskaltubo are running to Kutaisi II station. 
While private drivers and transport from Tbilisi are available (Mtskheta and Gori are day trips from Tbilisi and back), the Tbilisi-Kutaisi train route offers a good backbone for a tour of Georgia (with a look at its snow-capped mountains even in May) with leisurely overnights in Mtskheta, Gori, Kutaisi, and on to Batumi and the Black Sea.

By marshrutka[edit]
42.2568642.670626 Kutaisi central bus station. The official city's website has most correct departure times and prices. 
42.2568642.670627 Kutaisi I (in front of the train station). Serves nearby destination to the east, like Tkibuli, Tuzi and Oni. Timetable for leaving Kutaisi this way see at the end. 
42.27123342.6987248 Red bridge station (adjacent area of Red bridge from city center cross the bridge and stop is on the left). Regional marshrutkas, marshrutkas to Racha. The official city's website has most correct departure times and prices. 
From specific destinations:

Tbilisi – Marshrutkas and full 54-passenger buses depart regularly for Kutaisi from 'Didube Bus Station' located at the Didube metro stop in Tbilisi. Marshrutkas (hourly, 3½ hr, 10 lari); large buses (every 3 hours, 4 hr). While marshrutkas get to Kutaisi quicker than the train, they are not as comfortable. The driver may not leave Didube until the mini-bus is full, which could mean as many 20 people sitting with bags and backpacks in five rows of four seats. There is no guarantee of any stops along the way to smoke or go to the toilet. There is no standing, of course, and, really, very little room to wiggle, especially if there are people sitting on the aisle seats. The best seats in marshrutkas are the ones next to the driver; however, he may, if he chooses, ask you to move to the back of the bus and give your seat to someone else.
Batumi – The marshrutka will get you to the town centre, or drop you off at the airport on the way, for 15 lari. Usually it takes 2-2½ hr, but give yourself about 3 or so. The bus will wait in Batumi until it is full, which could mean waiting on the bus for an extra 45 min. In Batumi, the buses leave from nearby to the entrance to the cable car, but the port. You will see them all parked there.
Borjomi – Several during the day, every hour or so, 8 lari, 2 hr. If you do not find a direct bus, it is said to be easy to change buses in Khashuri—3 lari between Borjomi and Khashuri.
Akhaltsikhe – 10:40, 15:00, and 18:10. 3½ hr. 17 lari. (updated Apr 2022)
Kharagauli – Twice a day, 10 lari, 3½ hr.
Zugdidi – There are hourly (or so) marshrutkas until 16:00. 1½-2 hr, 7 lari.
Get around[edit]
42°16′39″N 42°42′15″E
The interesting parts of the town are walkable. To visit the monasteries in the mountains nearby booking a day-tour may be a time-saving option.

By bus[edit]
No. 1 city bus is a useful circular route (both clockwise and anticlockwise direction) linking the main city square, Kutasi I (main train station), and Kutaisi II (bus station). 0.40-0.50 lari, pay the driver at exit, change given.
From Kutasi II (bus station), clockwise direction (to the left, cross the road from McDonald's) is the faster route to the city centre. Note each direction takes slightly different route on the centre of the city (east side of the river). The clockwise direction does not go in front of Kutasi I but goes south on Tsereteli St. along the river. The anticlockwise direction stops in front of Kutaisi I then goes uphill on Solomon Piveli Street and downhill on 26 Maisi (May) Street towards the main square.
Local marshrutkas ply the city but it can be difficult to find the route for average tourists. Nonetheless, bother enough locals with a map and some broken Russian, and eventually one will take pity and frog march you to the right bus stop.

Ancient church that was built in the 11th century by King Bagrat III, a symbol of a unified Georgia. Foundations of an earlier building have been found. Blown up by marauding Islamic invaders in the 18th century, then carefully restored over the last 100 years; the interior is also almost completed. The difference between original and replacement is clearly obvious. The ongoing reconstruction aimed at returning Bagrati Cathedral back to its original state as a religious space has led ICOMOS to recommend that it should be left as a ruin and added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in danger. The site has since been removed from the World Heritage Sites list. Free admission.

Buy[edit]
What[edit]
The homemade wine in the bazaar in Kutaisi is apparently not that good, because more than often they mix with sugar and other stuff. This is at least what some locals are saying.

Where[edit]
42.2721842.701671 Bazaar (Village Market), off Zakhira Paliashvili (Paliashvili V Aly) St (From Kutsaisi Park (the Central Garden) walk towards the river in the direction of the Bagrati Cathedral and then follow the people). In addition to fruits, vegetables, and whole chickens, natural, homemade red wine is sold in Kutaisi's market, bottled in re-used plastic soda pop containers (from 2 lari a bottle). Look for a row of sellers in the first floor of a shabby building not far from the sellers on the street; the wine seller is on one end of this building in a walk-up stall. 
42.262242.70762 Regular stores, along Tsereteli St.. 
Eat[edit]

The minibus station is located close to Kutaisi II train station behind the McDonald's. Most of the following destinations can be reached from there:

Batumi – The capital of Ajara and Georgia's third largest city is a pleasant Black Sea port with great Ajaruli cuisine
Borjomi-Kharagauli National Park (for details see Borjomi) – The largest national park in Georgia. The diversity of physical, geographical and especially climatical conditions of it has shaped the wealth and variety of its flora and fauna. Apart from the largely untouched nature of Borjom-Kharagauli, there are numerous cultural monuments. In particular, there are two easily accessible churches, built in 9th century. Eight tourist trails are operating in the national park. They vary in length, duration and complexity. Open from Apr until October.
Jvari – A small town with a couple of great attractions nearby, namely Enguri Dam and Silver Lake. The latter is one of the most impressive alpine treks that you can do in Georgia. The marshrutka to Zugdidi leaves from the main marshrutka station behind the central McDonald's. The journey is 133 km. In Zugdidi connect with the Jvari marshrutka just over the bridge and a minute's walk away.
Mestia – The "capital" of Svaneti and a UNESCO World Heritage site.
Tbilisi – The beautiful and interesting capital, Georgia's largest and most cosmopolitan city.
Tskaltubo – A balneological ex-resort that was very popular during Soviet times (8 km away from Kutaisi). Many sanatoria are populated with refugees since war with Abkhazia. Destroyed luxury Soviet-time hotels are very interesting places to see.
