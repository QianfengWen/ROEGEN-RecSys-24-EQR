Understand[edit]
St Helen's Church and the River Thames at Abingdon
Abingdon was the county town of Berkshire until 1870, and became part of Oxfordshire when local government was re-organised in 1974.   It was the home of MG motor cars which used to be built at the MG Works, which is now a business centre. However, Jerome K Jerome in his book Three Men in a Boat described Abingdon as a 'dull market town'.
Each year the centre of the town is closed off (twice) for two fairs.  The Michaelmas Fair takes place early each Oct (legally the last Monday & Tuesday before 11 Oct). Ock Street, High Street and the Market Place are closed off and the fair is thought to be the longest street fair in Europe. In medieval times the fair was intended as a hiring fair for farm workers, these days it's rides, ferris wheels, and more traditional fairground rides and stalls. Then follows the unusual tradition a week or so later of the Runaway Fair.  A smaller fair, the history of the Runaway Fair was that it provided an opportunity for those who were hired by cruel masters or found poor working conditions from the earlier Michaelmas Fair could "runaway" and find better employment before the winter.
The town has a unique historic tradition of Bun Throwing dating back over 400 years. In practice it is a bit of a cross between a ceremony and a "bun fight". Held when the Town Council votes to hold one and generally to celebrate a royal occasion.  One was held to celebrate the 2011 Royal Wedding, and another in 2012 to mark the Royal Jubilee. Councillors in full ceremonial robes chuck around 4000 currant buns from the top of County Hall down at the chanting crowds filling the market place below. The buns are specially baked for the occasion with a crown design on the top. The buns are often fought for and preserved by local families and visitors. If your visit happens to be at the same time as a royal occasion check the Town Council Website in case such a rare ceremony has been scheduled.
