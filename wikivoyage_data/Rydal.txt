Get in[edit]
Rydal is one of the few towns in Australia still centred on its railway, even after the country was bulldozed for the car. -33.4836150.03181 Rydal railway station  reflects the town's modest size. The station is on the Main West railway line, served by NSW Trainlink's Blue Mountains Line (Opal) and Dubbo XPT (booked), albeit the services being woefully infrequent.
While the Blue Mountains Line gets frequent service east of Lithgow, the line west of it is still non-electrified and thus only served by diesel trains. The demand tends to be rather low. There are four westbound trains towards Bathurst, two eastbound towards Sydney and two eastbound towards Lithgow.
On the Dubbo XPT, which tends to be slightly more expensive, you can get off at Rydal, but it is a request stop – you much request to stop here or else the train will not stop here.
If arriving by road, the Old Western Rd connects Rydal to the Great Western Hwy just west of Lithgow.
