Porta Regia: the royal gate of Gniezno's cathedral
Gniezno is a city in Greater Poland in Poland. It is traditionally regarded as having been the first capital of Poland, and has been witness to many important events in early Polish history. Gniezno has become the seat of the second Polish diocese (after Poznań) and the first archbishopric. The coronations of several kings of Poland took place in the Gniezno cathedral.
Gniezno is situated in the northeastern part of the Greater Poland, between three lakes: Jelonek, Swietokrzyskie and Winiary, in what is called the Gniezno Lake District. It is only 50 kilometres away from Poznań and relatively close to Kujawsko-Pomorskie.


Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The nearest airports with scheduled passenger service are in Poznań (50 km) and Bydgoszcz (90 km).

By train[edit]
Gniezno is an important railroad junction, so there are many options to travel to and from the city by rail. The main rail line through Gniezno is Poznań-Gniezno-Inowrocław, where it is forks out to Gdańsk through Bydgoszcz and to Olsztyn through Toruń, with numerous connections:

to Poznań up to 17 daily regional trains and 6-10 (depending on season) fast ones. The travel time to Poznań varies from 40-45 for fast trains to 55 for the local ones (stopping at every station).
to Bydgoszcz and Gdańsk: 4 regional trains and 4-7 fast ones
to Toruń and Olsztyn 2 local trains and 3 fast ones.
Another line runs from Gniezno to Września and Jarocin, with 4 local trains daily (including two coordinated in Jarocin with trains to Wrocław).
An interesting alternative for those traveling to Gniezno from the South-East is a journey by a local narrow-gauge railway. It runs over a 38 km route during spring and summer weekends, and on other days by special request. Details (Polish only) - [1].

Get around[edit]
Church of the Holy Trinity in Gniezno.
On foot[edit]
Most tourists will find it unnecessary to use public transport in Gniezno, as all main tourist attractions are situated in the very centre (6-8 minute walk from both rail and bus station).

By bus[edit]
The network consists of 16 city bus lines and 1 suburban line. Some lines run only few times a day (e.g. in peak hours).
The fee structure is simple - single ride will cost you 2 zloty (€0.45), the fee doubles at night (23-5). If you travel more, you can use 11-ride ticket for 21 zloty. Unfortunately, there're no multiple-day tickets, the only option for those staying in the city for longer are monthly tickets - for one line: 50 zlotys (€12), for two lines: 60, for the whole network: 100 zlotys.
