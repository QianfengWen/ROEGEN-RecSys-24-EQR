Get around[edit]
Map of Schwetzingen
As a tourist, walking is your best bet. The town is small and the 10-minute walk from the train station to the gardens is along one of the main roads, and on some days includes a market.

By bus[edit]
Thompkins Barracks is sort of within walking distance of downtown Schwetzingen.  The walk is easy, but can take quite a bit of time.  For those who would rather not walk, you can take bus 710 from one of the bridges adjacent to Thompkins Barracks.  The ride will cost roughly 50 cents.

 Cantina Mexicana, Schlossplatz 8a, ☏ +49 6202 13616. A centrally located Mexican restaurant only several meters from the castle.  The food is decent and the service is effective.  A cheap happy hour is a major selling point for this bar with cocktails going for as little as €4 a pop. But don't expect much of a Margarita.  The decor elicits of the stereotypical Mexican restaurant with bricked walls and bright neons that advertise beer.
