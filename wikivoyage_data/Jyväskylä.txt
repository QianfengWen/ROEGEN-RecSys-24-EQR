Jyväskylä is a lively university city and the capital of Central Finland. About a third of the city's 148,000 inhabitants (2023) are students. Beautifully set between lakes and ridges, many motorsports fans are familiar with the city as the Neste Oil Rally of the World Rally Championships series takes place around the city each July. The works of the notable Finnish architect Alvar Aalto can be seen throughout the city. 


Understand[edit]
Elias Lönnrot, the compiler of the Finnish national epic, the Kalevala, gave the city the nickname "Athens of Finland". This nickname refers to the major role of Jyväskylä as an educational centre: the "seminar" founded in 1863 was the first institution educating teachers in Finnish. The seminar later developed into a university, inaugurated in 1954. The city is home of the annual Jyväskylä Arts Festival.
There are 328 lakes in the municipality, and lakes and rivers constitute 20% of its total area. 
Most of today's Jyväskylä was built after the Continuation War, when evacuees from territories ceded to the Soviet Union were settled in the city, and housing was badly needed.

Pubs, Bars and Nightclubs[edit]
Nightlife is centred in the downtown part of Kauppakatu and cross streets, some also in the uptown part of Kauppakatu, near the University. As most of the bars are situated on Kauppakatu or very close to it, pub crawls can be easily arranged in Jyväskylä. Start from Yläkaupunki and work your way down to the clubs in Alakaupunki!

Alakaupunki (Downtown)[edit]
A large number of bars, restaurants and nightclubs are located around the pedestrian district. Cheaper places in this area include Bar Explosive and Bar Passion. Suggested establishments:

62.2432725.748141 Bar Bra, Kauppakatu 35. The newest club in town offers the same as the others plus a beach section with hammocks. Open Tu-Su to 04:00, with age limit of 20 on Fridays and 22 on Saturdays. Cover charge €5. 
62.2437225.750042 Giggling Marlin, Kauppakatu 32. This club is easily recognizable by the long queue during weekends. As a part of a night club chain, this venue offers the same blend of danceable music and beautiful people you might have seen in the other SK bars. Cover charge €5.

Yläkaupunki (Uptown)[edit]
If you prefer a more laid-back night scene than euro-disco hell, walk uphill along Kauppakatu until you are past the church. This is where Yläkaupunki begins. Suggested establishments:

62.237925.73836 Sohwi, Vaasankatu 21. This pub has been around for a while and has still managed to stay fresh. Many students come here, maybe because the university is just next door or maybe because of the "rock hours". Food is also served. Open every day and until 02:00 on weekends.

Connect[edit]
The city of Jyväskylä does not offer a free wifi as such. However, e.g. every library in the city has both computers with internet access free, and free wifi. Usually the wifi password is written on a sign somewhere but you can ask any librarian, as they all speak English. Many companies offer free wifi. 

 Forum, Kauppakatu. M-F 09:00-21:00, Sa 09:00-18:00, Su 12:00-18:00. The Forum shopping centre in the centre of the city has a free wifi connection.

Restaurants and bars also have wifi connections for customers, but a password is usually needed and must specifically be asked for.

Stay safe[edit]
The crime rate in Jyväskylä is generally low. However, it's best to avoid obviously drunk people during weekend nights after the bars close. Long queuing for taxis or late night snack sometimes frustrate some partygoers to seek fighting opponents. Sometimes this results to a temporary conversion from a pedestrian district to fighting arena, but the common sight of patrolling police makes the occurrences more rare. Despite this, walking on the streets at night (or any time of day) is safe.
In the winter time the streets might be slippery and that it is mandatory by traffic law to wear a reflector during the dark period.
