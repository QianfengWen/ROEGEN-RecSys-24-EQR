Kano is a city in North West Nigeria and the capital of Kano State. It has a population of around 3.6 million (2016 estimate), giving it a busy atmosphere.  It is an ancient trading city inhabited for well over a thousand years.  Despite the international airport, there is little tourist trade, but there are still surprisingly many attractions to visit and, as with the rest of Nigeria, the joy is in the people and the buzz of the streets.


Understand[edit]
Kano Market
Kano is the largest city in northern Nigeria.  The city is predominantly Muslim with a small percentage of Christians and adherents of traditional religions.  Sharia law was introduced around 2001 but only applies to Muslims and punishments are rare.  There have been sectarian riots, but this is mainly due to political tensions and is not targeted at foreigners.
Foreign currency is not usually accepted so get some Nigerian naira at a bank or an ATM.
Electricity brownouts are a common problem and don't expect the cleanest of streets.
The official language is English, but the language of the street is Hausa.

Get in[edit]
Visitors from outside Nigeria will need a visa.  This costs around US$70 and you should apply to the relevant embassy or high commission at least four weeks in advance.  They will need proof that you can support yourself financially and may ask for a letter from your employer.
You will need vaccinations against yellow fever, cholera, medication for malaria and other diseases.

Splurge[edit]
Drink[edit]
Sharia law means alcohol is hard to find. Most hotels do not serve alcohol on the premises but for a small fee you can easily get a staff member to buy some bottles of beer for consumption in your room (most hotel rooms in Kano have fridges). The area called Sabon Gari has many bars and nightclubs where alcoholic drinks are freely available and many stores where you can buy wine, or other alcoholic drinks.
There are malt drinks in cans with beer branding which are an acquired taste. There are few dairy products in the area but some milk based drinks are available. Western brands such as Coca Cola or Nescafe are common. Do not drink locally made drinks (zobo - sorrel, kunun aya - from tiger nuts) if you did not know the source, as hygiene is not concerned when preparing some of them.

Splurge[edit]
Stay safe[edit]
Kano is a largely safe city and theft or violence to foreigners is rare.  Keep valuables in a zipped pocket and do not wear overly revealing clothes.  When buying outside shops you will probably need to haggle, walk away if you are unsure of the deal.  People may try to swindle you so check your prices before agreeing and if anyone asks for money feel free to walk away.  Do not use internet banking from anything but private computers.

Stay healthy[edit]
HIV prevalence is extremely high in Kano, with medical studies reporting over 30% of the population infected. Prepare accordingly.
