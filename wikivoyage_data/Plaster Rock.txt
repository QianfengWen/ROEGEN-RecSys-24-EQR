Plaster Rock[dead link] is a beautiful village of about 1,000 people (2016) in northwestern  New Brunswick, Canada. It is on the Appalachian Range Scenic Drive, along the banks of the picturesque Tobique River.


Understand[edit]
Plaster Rock’s first European settlers arrived in 1881. They gave Plaster Rock its name based on the hill on the other side of the Tobique River – the rock is made up of gypsum, or plaster.
Primarily English, the town has been a logging and lumbering community. Known as the Gateway to Mount Carleton Provincial Park, the community is the source of business, commerce, banking, grocery shopping, and religious and sport gatherings for the surrounding hamlets and homes of the Tobique River region.
The Tobique First Nations Reserve is found where the Tobique and Saint John Rivers come together.
