Covington's modern skyline with the Historic Roebling Bridge and the Ohio River
Covington[dead link] is a city in Kentucky's Northern Ohio River Region across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, Ohio. It is the largest city in Northern Kentucky.
Covington is pretty much the southern side of Cincinnati, with similar architecture (though far better preserved if not in the best of shape) and a shared history linked by the historic Roebling Suspension Bridge and the Ohio River. Like its eastern neighbor, Newport, it has profited from revitalization.


Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. (Exit 4, State Route 212) Phone: +1 859 767-3151 (info@cvgairport.com).  Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG IATA) is in nearby Hebron, Kentucky.
John Glenn Columbus International Airport (CMH IATA) in Columbus, Dayton International Airport (DAY IATA) in Dayton, and Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport (SDF IATA) in Louisville are also options for travelers.
By car[edit]
Covington is accessible by Interstate 71/75 via Exits 192 (Fifth Street—Covington/Ludlow) and 190 (Twelfth Street—Newport/Covington). Covington's street grid numbers southbound — away from the river — whereas Cincinnati's grid numbers northbound. That causes confusion for some travelers coming in from the interstate.  The first Fifth Street ramp, when traveling northbound (from Kentucky) is Covington.  The next one, labeled "Fifth Street Downtown", is Cincinnati's Fifth Street.

By train[edit]
Amtrak offers passenger train service from key U.S. cities. The nearest station is in Cincinnati, at Union Terminal/Cincinnati Museum Center.

Megabus is a budget bus company offering service to Cincinnati from Chicago, Indianapolis, and Columbus. Fares start at $1.

The Diocese of Covington's home cathedral and inspired by several French cathedrals. The front is a version of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris without the High towers. They could not be accommodated by the soil at that location. Guided tours can be arranged by contacting the cathedral.   
39.0481-84.50822 Railway Museum of Greater Cincinnati (Railway Exposition Museum), 315 W. Southern Avenue, ☏ +1 859 491-RAIL (7245).   
39.08936-84.509573 The Ascent at Roebling's Bridge, 1 Roebling Way (downtown, near the hotels and the Roebling Suspension Bridge). Unique condo tower designed by famous architect Daniel Libeskind who designed the original concept for the replacement for the World Trade Center in New York City. Though it is a private residence, one should see it from the outside as it is one of the most unique buildings in the entire region.   
39.08417-84.517544 Mainstrasse Village, From about 5th St to Pike on Main Street (off I-75 to 5th street). MainStrasse Village is a festival/entertainment district known for numerous bars, historic architecture, its famous Goebel Park Bell Tower and its German heritage. A walking tour is available on its website. 
39.09118-84.506485 Riverside Drive Historic District (East of the Roebling Bridge North of 6th St). One of the oldest neighborhoods remaining in the Cincinnati area, with many charming houses dating from the early to mid 1800s. Because it was built on a bluff and less flood prone than many other places around the river, there are lots of stately old mansions with a blend of Antebellum South and early Mid-Atlantic style architecture. This area is known to house the birthplace of Boy Scouts of America founder Daniel Carter Beard (which there is a small memorial to, though the house is a private residence). Its also great for an afternoon stroll along the river with George Rogers Clark Park being a popular spot for weddings.   
39.079-84.5426 Devou Park, 20 W. Pike Street, ☏ +1 859-292-2151. Absolutely breathtaking park with a view overlooking Covington and Cincinnati - picnic tables, playground, grills, golf, trails, the whole getup. Most notable, though, is the overlook of Covington from atop the park's grassy hill.   (updated Dec 2021)
Do[edit]
Dog Costume Parade (Mainstrasse Village) Held in October, near Halloween. This listing will serve either as an enticement or a warning, depending on your personal philosophies.
Buy[edit]
 Second Sunday Antiques Marketplace (Sixth Street Promenade). Held from 9AM - 3PM on the second Sunday of most months (from May to August and also October), in the MainStrasse Village. 
Eat[edit]
Budget[edit]
39.07848-84.517211 Anchor Grill, 438 Pike St, ☏ +1 859 431-9498. This 24-hour diner is known for its cheap food and unique clientele. The later you go the more interesting it gets. Not much has changed since this greasy spoon opened its doors in 1946. Pick a song on the table-mounted jukebox and see Barbie and her mechanized band perform it live! 
39.08378-84.510612 Old Town Cafe & Catering, 9 West Pike St., Old Town Plaza, ☏ +1 859 291-0664. Proudly bills itself as the cafe where the power brokers of Northern Kentucky eat — when they're in the mood for cheap sandwiches and burgers, that is. There's a Fish Fry on Fridays. 
Mid-range[edit]
Splurge[edit]
39.03666-84.560853 Greyhound Tavern, 2500 Dixie Highway, Fort Mitchell, ☏ +1 859 331-3767, greyhoundtavern@fuse.net. M-Th 11AM-10PM; F Sa 11AM-midnight; Su 10AM-9PM. Established 1921 and located in a beautiful old building, but with very modern prices. 
39.08584-84.521954 Riverview Revolving Restaurant (Eighteen at the Radisson), 668 W 5th St (off I-71/I-75 right before the Brent Spence Bridge), ☏ +1 859 491-5300. 10:30AM-10PM, reservations recommended. Revolving restaurant over a hotel overlooking downtown Cincinnati. Come here for the view more than the food, though the menu does offer some local items such as Cincinnati Chili and Greaters Ice Cream. $25-$50. 
Drink[edit]
Unlike Ohio, for better or for worse, Kentucky still allows smoking in its bars.  Some bars in Ohio complained about bars in Kentucky stealing their business due to this ordinance, though if you don't like smoke be warned that it does exist here.

39.08306-84.511071 Braxton Brewery, 27 W 7th St (Near Madison and Pike - Downtown Covington). Large garage-like lounge that by day brews excellent coffee and by night equally excellent beer.  Come during the day to get work done with high speed wifi or at night to hang out with friends and watch a game while drinking very unique high quality beers which include flavors like "Tropical Stout", or "Hull Melon Hops".   Hopefully this is a catalyst for Covington's downtown whose gorgeous dense old Victorian brick buildings would remind a well traveled person of Boston minus all the people. (updated Oct 2015)
Liquor stores[edit]
People in the Cincinnati area flock to Northern Kentucky for its cheaper and more plentiful alcohol due to its looser liquor laws.  As a result the riverfronts of Covington and Newport have many large liquor stores that cater to Cincinnatians who are looking to stock up for a big party.  Travelers who prefer to drink in their hotel room should check out some of these local stores, particularly for their excellent selection of Kentucky Bourbon.

Sleep[edit]
Covington's hotels draw a lot of visitors from Cincinnati. Many of them identify themselves as Cincinnati hotels in their names, despite their location in Covington.
