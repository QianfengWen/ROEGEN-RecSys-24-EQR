Long Beach Island (LBI), famous Exit 63 off the Garden State Parkway, is an 18-mile-long barrier island in Ocean County, New Jersey. The island has evolved from an important fishing hub to a playground for well-to-do men and women. Nowadays, the numerous tourists attractions and white sandy beaches make LBI a huge tourist spot. The summer months are busiest, "the season" ranging from mid-May through Chowda Fest in October.  The majority of the island shuts down during the winter months.  Although evolved from the 1950s days of full-coverage bathingsuits, LBI is certainly still a playground of sorts.


Understand[edit]
Barnegat Lighthouse on the northern tip of Long Beach Island
The Island derives its name from its white sand beaches that stretch the entirety of the 18 miles. LBI was discovered in 1614 by Captain Cornelius Jacobsen May, a Dutch explorer and tradesman. During its history, the island was rattled by a few major hurricanes, including the largest in 1944. A famous photograph of a home slowly falling victim to this hurricane is hung in many stores, restaurants, and hotels on the island today.

Long Beach Island is packed with restaurants and eateries from Lighthouse to Inlet, with the majority of them centralized in Beach Haven, Surf City, and Harvey Cedars.  Many restaurants do not take reservations and some can have waits as long as 3 hours for a meal, so timing is key when it comes to dining on LBI.  Because rentals change over on Saturdays, avoid going out to eat Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays.
