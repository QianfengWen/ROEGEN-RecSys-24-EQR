Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Front facade of the Maison Savoie, built in 1895 for Gabriel Marchand, prothonotary, deputy for Saint-Jean. He is the son of Félix-Gabriel Marchand, journalist, author, notary and politician.
On March 1, 1695, Governor Frontenac signed a decree granting a fourth seigniory along the Richelieu River to François Hertel de la Fresnière, a soldier. The latter designated the seigneury of Saint-François-Le-Neuf, which would later be designated Saint-Charles-sur-Richelieu.
The first church was blessed in 1740, dedicated to Saint-Charles. In 1800, almost all the lots of land were granted; nevertheless, without any village.
From 1695 to 1877, ten lords succeeded each other as owners of the lordship, because several of them had to give up their rights due to bankruptcy.
After the 1834 election, the Parti Patriote rallied almost the entire French-speaking population. Lord Debartzch disassociated himself from Papineau and sided with the English. The battle of November 1837 took place between the English army and the Patriots.
The 300th anniversary of Saint-Charles-sur-Richelieu was celebrated in 1995.

Geography[edit]
Apart from the dwellings in the strip of riverside land (including the village), rue de l'Union, rang du Côteau, 3rd row (north and south), 4th row (north and south), as well as an area forest (north-south direction), the rest of the territory of Saint-Charles-sur-Richelieu is mainly agricultural.
