Old City Hall (Altes Rathaus)
Bielefeld[dead link] is a city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany with around 300,000 citizens.
According to a German internet meme (which originated as a tongue-in-cheek take on various conspiracy theories), this city does not exist. Incidentally this is the one thing almost all Germans know about the town.


Understand[edit]
While the bizarre conspiracy theory of it not existing is the first thing most Germans will tell you about the city, it actually has a rather long history, dating back to a first mention in the 9th century and it was first called a city in a 1214 document, the 800-year anniversary of which was celebrated - naturally - under the headline "Das gibt's doch gar nicht" which can mean "That's unbelievable" or more literally "That doesn't exist". While a lot of the old town was destroyed in World War II, there are still some nice buildings left.

Where the Stadtbahn doesn't go, there is an extensive bus network. With headways as low as ten minutes.
