Chillicothe
Chillicothe is a city in Ross County in South Central Ohio and is the county seat of Ross County. In the 1800s, it was designated as the capital of the "eastern section" of the Northwest Territory. Later the State Constitutional Convention was held in Chillicothe, and in 1803, Ohio entered the Union, Chillicothe became the first state capital of Ohio. The name of the city was derived from a Shawnee word meaning "principal town". It is located along the Scioto River and Paint Creek.
