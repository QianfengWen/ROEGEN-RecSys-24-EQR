Astoria is a city on the Northern Oregon Coast.  It is a small rainy town on the edge of the Columbia River and the Pacific Ocean. It is famous for being the terminus for the Lewis and Clark Expedition, the setting of the movie The Goonies, and its Victorian-era homes built into the hillside overlooking the Columbia River.

History[edit]
The history of Astoria begins with the Clatsop Indians who lived there for thousands of years. In 1792, Captain Robert Gray located the mouth of the Columbia River and sailed up the river. In 1805, the Lewis and Clark Expedition spent the winter near the current site of Astoria at Fort Clatsop. The city of Astoria itself was not settled until 1811 when John Jacob Astor's Pacific Fur Company established a fur trading post, making it the oldest American settlement west of the Rocky Mountains.
With the start of the War of 1812 between the United States and England, Astor's fur traders sold the post to the British Northwest Company so that from 1813 to 1818, the British owned Astoria and it was known as Fort George. The 1818 treaty with England established the Oregon Country, although the fur trade largely remained in the British control until the mid-1840s.

By car[edit]
 &  U.S. Route 101 runs north-south through the city; the Astoria-Megler Bridge to Washington terminates near downtown (at W Maine Dr).  U.S. Route 30 provides access from the east, including Portland. If you are coming from Longview/Kelso, Woodland or anywhere north (such as the Puget Sound Area) you can also go through take Exit #39 from I-5 in Longview and cross over the Columbia River to get on US Route 30. Astoria is the western terminus to US 30 after spanning 3,073 miles (4,946 km) across the country from Atlantic City. It is the third longest U.S. highway, after US 20 (Florence, OR) and US 6. 
   An alternate route from Portland is to take U.S. Route 26 West and OR-103 North to Jewell. Then take the scenic OR-202 north to Astoria. There are observation points along Highway 202 where it is common to see wild elk relaxing in a meadow. Highway 202 is known as a particularly enjoyable road to take if you happen to be driving a motorcycle or high-performance car. OR-202 enters into the southside of town as Cherry Ave, alongside Youngs River, which ends at US 101 in Smith's Point. Likewise travelers can go north on 7th Ave into town from Cherry.
