They also developed a checklist of birds likely to be seen birds in the area.
The state Audubon Society developed 'The Great Audubon Birding Trail' which includes key migration flyways.  Flyways are major north-south routes of travel for migratory birds and likely areas to see birds along the route extending from Alaska to Patagonia. The Sinclair Inlet north of Port Orchard is one of only a handful of locations in the area along the trail and an excellent area for birdwatching.

Scuba diving[edit]
Puget Sound Wolf Eel

The area offers some of the best diving in the world and many areas are accessible from the Port Orchard via boat. The state offers a guide to parks with launch sites HERE[dead link].

Dive areas[edit]
Watermans Wall is a well-known advanced dive accessible by boat near Port Orchard.  When rounding Point Glover, you will see a very prominent navigational marker on a large concrete foundation on the shore to your left (mistaken for a lighthouse by some). Find the wall with a depth sounder on a straight line between this navigational marker and a little red house on the far shore that sits all by itself. This puts you just south of the marker, with the wall starting in about 75 yards offshore. Anchor in about 40 feet of water on the shelf above the wall, about 10 yards from the wall. The wall starts in about 50 feet of water.
The wall has some shear faces, lengthy ledges, boulders, rock piles, and some large crevices. Here you can find most of the famous marine creatures that make Puget Sound the marine-life Mecca that it is. Lots of little Pink Scallops and some big Rock Scallops, Giant Barnacles, a wide assortment of sea stars including Sunflower Stars. Brown Rockfish and Quillback Rockfish, Lingcod, Buffalo Sculpins and Orange, purple, and yellow sponges are in abundance, as are yellow Sea Lemons nudibranchs. Wolf Eels and Giant Pacific Octopus can be seen here also.  However, the steep terrain and currents make this an advanced dive.

Conservation areas[edit]
Well-known to regional scuba divers, Orchard Rocks Conservation Area is located northeast of Manchester State Park in the waters and bedlands of Rich Passage within a 400-yard radius of Orchard Rocks day marker and accessible by boat from Port Orchard.  The natural bedrock and boulders provide habitats for rock-associated fish and invertebrate species. Copper rockfish and quillback rockfish once were common at this site but now are rare. Brown rockfish are common as are lingcod, red Irish lord, buffalo sculpin, striped seaperch, and pile perch. Kelp greenling, painted greenling, and cabezon are consistently present in the reserve. Dominant invertebrates include red rock crab, spider crabs, red sea cucumber, and orange sea cucumber. Harbor seals frequently visit the site and are often seen hauled out on the exposed rocks at low tide. California sea lions are also commonly observed at the site and may be seen hauled out on nearby navigational buoys.
