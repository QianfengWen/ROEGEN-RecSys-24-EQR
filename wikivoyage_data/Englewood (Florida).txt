Understand[edit]
Palm trees in Englewood
Englewood is enclosed on three sides by the Gulf of Mexico and the larger cities of Venice and Port Charlotte, which both have more shopping and action, but the beaches aren't as nice. Englewood has the necessities including Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Publix, and Bealls.
Folklore has it that in the 1920s, a candidate for mayor promised that if elected, he would guarantee to have the US 41 run through town. Venice and Port Charlotte took off instead.

Get in[edit]
Englewood is a 30-minute drive south from Sarasota/Bradenton Regional Airport (SRQ IATA), a 60-minute drive north from Fort Myers Regional Airport (RSW IATA), and a 75 minute drive south of Tampa International Airport (TPA IATA).
Englewood is accessible from I-75 from exit 191 River Rd and to a lesser extent 193 Jacaranda Blvd.

Get around[edit]
You'll need to get a rental car from the airport as public transportation is nearly non-existent, and is impossible to use from town-to-town.
