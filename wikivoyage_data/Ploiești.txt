Ploiești (Pronounced: Plo-yesht) is the ninth largest city in Romania and the closest to Bucharest. Ploieşti is not a touristy city, and it is mainly visited by foreigners dealing with the various industries and businesses in the city or foreign students studying at the Oil and Gas University (UPG).


Understand[edit]
Map of Ploiești
The city of Ploiești was established in 1596 and claims to have been founded by Michael the Brave, Prince of historic Wallachia. Home to the first large-scale oil refinery in the world, built in 1856, Ploieşti was a major centre of oil extraction and refining across the late 19th and the 20th century.
From the late 19th century until the Second World War, the city was also well known as an important commercial hub. With its vast vineyards dotted on the hills east of the city, its industries, and its location at the intersection of the roads from Bucharest to Moldavia and Transylvania, it was the meeting place for merchants coming from all sides of the country. During this time, the city became known for its drinking and partying culture. At its height, just after the First World War, there was a pub for every 200 citizens living in the city.
During the Second World War, Romania was the largest producer of oil in Europe; the Ploiești oil refineries provided about 30% of all Axis oil production. That lead to the bombing of Ploiești by the US Air Force in 1943.
While the city is still home to 4 oil refineries and is a manufacturing hub, its proximity to Bucharest led to population decline as younger generations moved away to seek better opportunities in the capital or abroad.
It was home to 234,000 people in 2016, and is the seat of Prahova County.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Ploieşti is served by the same airport as Bucharest, the Henri Coandă International Airport that is 45 km away. There is a rail line connecting the airport with the main train station of Bucharest where you can easily hop on a train to Ploiești at any time before 22:50 (€4-5). Taxis can also make the journey from the airport to Ploiești but at a significantly higher cost (€25 to €40).

By train[edit]
Gara de Sud
Ploieşti is the second most important railway hub in Romania and is linked by numerous trains with every major city in the country (there are more than 50 trains daily from Bucharest).
Trains take between 35 and 70 minutes to cover the distance between Bucharest and Ploieşti, depending on the type of train. The train is the fastest way to get to Ploieşti, both from Bucharest and Brașov.

Train stations[edit]
44.924525.99481 Gara de Vest (Western train station). Connections between Bucharest and the whole of Transylvania crossing the Carpathian Mountains into Brasov via Prahova Valley and its famous resorts like Sinaia and Predeal.

Transfer between Gara de Sud and Gara de Vest[edit]
There are quite a few trains that connect the two stations, running every 1.5 to 2 hours. The journey takes 6 minutes. Any train in Gara de Sud with a destination in Transylvania will stop in Gara de Vest and any train in Gara de Vest with a destination in Moldavia or Măneciu will stop in Gara de Sud.
Otherwise, the 2 bus line connects the two train stations within 20 minutes. Taxis take 10-15 minutes at a cost of roughly 10 lei.

By car[edit]
Ploieşti is very well connected with other cities in Romania, being very close to Bucharest and placed almost midway between the capital and Brașov. From Bucharest, in can be reached either through the old DN1 national road or the new A3 motorway.

Get around[edit]
Ploieşti is small and quite walkable. The city is served by a good public transport system, the Transport Călători Express Ploiești (TCE) comprising 38 bus lines, 2 tram lines, and 4 trolleybus lines covering all areas of the city.
Fares cost 2.5 lei and can be paid with contactless inside the transport. Paper tickets can also be bought at main stops in the city.

Ploiești's Statue of Liberty
Most of the beautiful old architecture was destroyed by the US military bombing of 1943 and by the Communist regime that replaced many of the old buildings with the same brutalist architecture that is ubiquitous to South Romania. Quite a bit of the surviving old buildings lay abandoned in a very poor state or have been improperly refurbished not taking the historical design into account.
