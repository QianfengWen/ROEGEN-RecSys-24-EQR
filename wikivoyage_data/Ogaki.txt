Tourist information site[edit]
水都旅 すいとりっぷ is a Japanese-only tourist guide site for the city and surrounding areas.

Get in[edit]
Most travelers will arrive via the Tokaido Main Line. The line runs from Maibara to the west through Ogaki and onward to Gifu, Nagoya, and Toyohashi. Although Gifu-Hashima Station is within Gifu Prefecture, those traveling by Shinkansen can get here faster by transferring at Maibara (from the west) or Nagoya (from the east).
The Yoro Line runs from the northern city of Ibigawa (Ibi Station) to Kuwana down in Mie Prefecture. The Tarumi Line connects Ogaki with Motosu, although if you're in Motosu, you probably already went through Ogaki to get there.
The Sunomata area can be reached by bus from Gifu Station.

Get around[edit]
Ogaki is a city divided into three disconnected areas thanks to city mergers. Most travelers will be coming to Ogaki Station. This area is the city center and original Ogaki. The castle and Matsuo Basho museum can be reached on foot. Akasaka Station is within walking distance of Akasaka-juku, the 56th station of the Nakasendo.
The merged districts are Sunomata and Kamiishizu. Neither of these areas has a train station, so you'll have to take a bus to reach them. Ogaki City Community Bus has lines to the Kamiishizu area. Meishin Kintetsu Bus connects Ogaki with the Sunomata area (buses bound for Shotoku Gakuen Daigaku).

Sunomata Castle
35.361995136.6160751 Ogaki Castle (大垣城), ☏ +81 58-474-7875. 09:00-17:00. Ogaki Castle is an important historic site. The Battle of Sekigahara actually began here before moving west to Sekigahara, where the battle ended. The original castle was destroyed in World War II, so the current castle was reconstructed in 1959. Inside it is a museum with information about the castle and the Battle of Sekigahara. ¥100.   
35.356222136.6118332 Oku no Hosomichi Haiku Journey Museum (奥の細道むすびの地記念館). A museum dedicated to the famous poet Matsuo Basho's journey from Edo (Tokyo) to the Tohoku Region, known as The Narrow Road to the Deep North (Oku no Hosomichi). While Ogaki is obviously not in Tohoku, the museum is here because his journey ended here. There is a 3-D video theater that shows a few different videos throughout the day, and the rest of the museum features exhibits on Basho's travels from the beginning of his journey to the end. There is also a room featuring other historic figures connected to Ogaki. ¥600.  (updated Jan 2018)
35.355744136.6124533 Funamachi Port and Sumiyoshi Lighthouse (船町港跡と住吉燈台). More commonly known as Oku no Hosomichi Musubi no Chi (奥の細道むすびの地), which means the "endpoint of The Narrow Road to the Deep North", it was Ogaki's port along a canal that connected it to Kuwana. Matsuo Basho took a boat from the port after completing his trip through Tohoku, and a statue of him is located along the canal. The lighthouse was built in the Edo Period. The canal area is known as a scenic spot in the city and is especially popular during the cherry blossom season when the blossoms billow out over the water. (updated Oct 2022)

35.367107136.6877185 Sunomata Castle (墨俣城), 1742-1 Sunomata, Sunomata-cho. Nicknamed "Sunomata Ichiya Castle" (墨俣一夜城), the castle is famous for the tale that it was built in just one night (ichiya). It was indeed built very quickly, but took a couple days rather than a single night. It was not actually a castle with a donjon like you see today. The original site was built as a fortress with wall and towers by Toyotomi Hideyoshi as part of the campaign to overtake Gifu Castle (Inabayama Castle). The modern structure was built in the 1990s as a museum with information about the former castle, a diorama depicting what it looked like and information about famous castle battles in other parts of the country. It's a popular place to visit in the spring when the cherry blossoms bloom.   (updated Feb 2018)
