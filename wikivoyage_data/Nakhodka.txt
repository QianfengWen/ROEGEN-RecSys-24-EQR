Nakhodka Harbor
Nakhodka (Russian: Нахо́дка, nah-KHOHT-kuh) is a port city in Primorsky Krai. Its name means 'discovery' in Russian. 


Understand[edit]
Nakhodka Bay was discovered in 1859 by a Russian corvette seeking shelter during a storm. The name is best translated as "lucky find". A small fishing village was founded in 1907, and got city rights in 1950. Unlike Vladivostok, Nakhodka was never a closed city, and the city's economy suffered a downturn when the biggest city was opened to foreign trade. Russia designated the city a "free economic zone," a variation on China's very successful Special Economic Zones, which could attract large-scale foreign investment. It is location of the port Vostochniy, the largest port in Russian Far East, and an oil-terminal for Sakhalin projects.
