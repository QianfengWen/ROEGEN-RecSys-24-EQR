Hualien (花蓮 Huālián) is a city of 100,000 people (2022) in Taiwan near the spectacular Taroko Gorge.


Understand[edit]
Located on a strip of land between the Pacific Ocean and the Central Mountain Range, Hualien is considered one of the most pleasant cities in Taiwan. Many tourists visit the city to enjoy the scenery and fresh air and also to tour the famous Taroko Gorge, which is a few kilometers north of the city.
It has a large population (12,500 in 2022) of indigenous people. Due to this large indigenous population, Hualien has traditionally been a KMT stronghold, though the DPP has made inroads among the younger generation.

Go next[edit]
Taroko Gorge – An impressive 19-km-long canyon, and the name, Taroko, means the "magnificent and splendid" in the language of Truku, the aboriginal tribe residing in the area.
RueiSuei – Famous for its Hot Springs and the Siouguluan River Basin.
Hehuan Mountain – A fantastic journey through the wonders of Taroko Gorge and past, ending in a treeless, absolutely different ecosystem.
River Valleys – The might of typhoons and heavy rains have, over millions of years, carved out of the soft bedrock magnificent river valleys. If you find a river valley (Mugua RIver, for example) and follow it and hike along some tributaries, you are in for a wonderful adventure. No gift shops or 7-Elevens here, just the wonders of Taiwan.
Tongmen – South of Hualien City, between Jian and Liyu Lake, lies Taroko's little brother.
Highway 11 – Rent a scooter and hit the road. The beauty of the coastline in Hualien can be enjoyed from this gorgeous stretch of highway. Although many buses and cars are also drawn here and many cite this as a cause for safety concerns, this is by most accounts false. Take care, drive responsibly, and always be careful when around traffic, but do not let anyone deter you from this drive. Pack a lunch and picnic on the coast with the turquoise ocean lapping at the coastline below. Buses and taxis will take you along this road also. Taxis are more personable (they will stop when you say 'stop') but buses are much cheaper. However, both pale in comparison to the experience of driving yourself.
