Understand[edit]
Sakata is the third most populous city in Yamagata prefecture. It lies at the mouth of the Mogami River. This location allowed it to flourish thanks to a thriving safflower trade with the Kansai region during the Edo Period (1603-1868). During this time the city ranked among the most important port towns in all of Japan. An international port remains in the city, though its national importance has since diminished.
The city has been the shooting location for a number of film productions, most notably in 2008, when the Oscar winning film "Departures" (おくりびと, okuribito) was filmed here.
