By car[edit]
The town is accessible via the Pacific Coast Highway (SR-1; often abbreviated "PCH"), or by traveling along famed Sunset Boulevard, which acts as an east-west pass-through and terminates on the western boundary of the town itself. Temescal Canyon Blvd. originates at PCH and permits a northerly approach into the middle of town.

By bus[edit]
Santa Monica's Big Blue Bus #9 goes along Sunset Blvd. via Chautauqua Blvd., going through the heart of Pacific Palisades, from Santa Monica.
LA Metro bus 2 also travels along Sunset Blvd. all the way to PCH, and then loops back on Temescal Canyon Blvd. traversing much of the town.

By bicycle[edit]
You will be competing for space along the same access routes for vehicular traffic. Unless you are a capable urban cyclist, travel along Sunset Blvd. and PCH is not advised. Temescal Canyon Blvd. presents a long, steep grade, and you would do well to make sure your braking system is in tip-top shape should you double back!

By foot[edit]
Foot traffic from the coastline is common, especially during good weather. Both the west entrance into town via Sunset Blvd. and the uphill north entrance along Temescal Canyon Blvd. have uninterrupted sidewalks. The east entrance does not have clearly-marked walkways for at least 200 yards (180 meters) measured from the east border of town--walking along either side of Sunset Blvd. is very dangerous and ill-advised.

It was constructed in 1949 by husband-and-wife design pioneers Charles and Ray Eames, and commissioned by Arts & Architecture magazine as part of a program challenging architects to design progressive, but modest, homes in Southern California.
