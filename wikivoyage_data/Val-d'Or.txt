Understand[edit]
Val-d'Or city
The city's name is French for "Valley of Gold". Val-d’Or is on the Canadian Shield at an elevation of 1100 feet (330 m) above sea level. Although its name refers to a valley (“Val”), the city is actually on a vast, slightly undulating plain.

History[edit]
Bourlamaque mining village
Val-d'Or was established in 1923 as a gold rush town. Gold, copper, zinc, lead and lithium are still extracted in the region.
Gold was discovered in the area in 1923. The metal ores are usually found in volcanic rocks that were deposited on the sea floor over 2.7 billion years ago. They are referred to as volcanic-hosted (or volcanogenic) massive sulphide deposits (VMS).
Val-d'Or was once home to CFS Val-d'Or, a Canadian Forces Station.
