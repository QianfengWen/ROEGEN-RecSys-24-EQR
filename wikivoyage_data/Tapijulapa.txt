Get in[edit]
Map of Tapijulapa
The best way to get to Tapijulapa from Villahermosa is by taxi. Even though the ride is almost an hour long, the fare is unlikely to be more than about M$80, but always discuss the fare with the driver before setting out. It's possible to do the trip by bus, but generally more expensive and less convenient.

By bus[edit]
From Villahermosa, you will probably not find a direct bus to Tapijulapa, in which case you can take a bus to either Jalapa or Teapa. Both of those towns are served by daily buses on Autobuses TRT. From Jalapa or Teapa, you can take a taxi or combi to Tapijulapa.

Get around[edit]
The town is compact and delightfully walkable with numerous narrow alleys (callejon). Boats leave from the town jetty to take you to Villa Luz.

17.44667-92.7662561 Parque Natural Villa Luz, Villa Luz. The park is a unique environment with sulfurous springs producing chalky blue waters that fill several natural pools and a robust stream that drops 12 meters over the picturesque waterfalls, Cascada de Villa Luz. A karst cave called the Cueva de Villa Luz (or Cueva de Sardinas) is famous for its poisonous hydrogen sulfide atmosphere inside the cave (very hazardous to enter). Local folklore has it that indigenous Zoque shaman would enter the cave and fish for sardines on one day of the year. Access to the park is via a boat or bridge crossing the Oxolotán  River to the park. The park features a swinging bridge, hiking trails, sheer cliffs with climbing and rappeling opportunities, and natural spa-like pools where you can soak your tired bones while you assault your nose with the scent of sulfuric mineral waters.
