Puerto López lies at the Pacific Coast of Ecuador. A fishing village, it is now also becoming a tourism hotspot and is most famous for being the departure point for visits to Isla de la Plata.


Understand[edit]
Malecón of Puerto López
Once a haven for budget travellers going to Isla de la Plata, the town has become much more developed with a beach promenade, a pier for tours to the nearby islands, and lots of restaurants and hotels.

Get in[edit]
Puerto López has a new bus terminal about a mile north of town on the coastal highway. Tuc-tucs (mototaxis) charge $1 to take you to town. Information on bus schedules can be found at AndesTransit.

From Santa Elena buses leave many times a day, passing by Montañita.
From Montañita there are frequent buses ($2.50, 1 hr). Some of the buses don't have storage underneath, be prepared to put your pack in the front of the bus or on your lap.
To Guayaquil buses go via Jipijapa at 07:00, 09:00, 13:00, 16:00 ($4, 4 hr).
From Portoviejo two companies goes to Puerto Lopez, with a stop at Jipijapa and continue to Montanita ($3, 2 hr).
From Quito Reina del Camino and Carlos Aray provide direct service from the Quitumbe Terminal ($13).
Get around[edit]
Everything but the bus terminal is in a walking distance. Taximotos should not cost more than $1 to get around town.

See[edit]
Puerto Lopez beach
Each morning (the time depends of the time of the year) the day's fishing catch is brought in the beach near the pier. A mad rush ensues with best catches being bought and carted away quite quickly. You can see sharks, swordfish, wahoo (from the tuna family), and more. Apart from fish, you will see at least frigate birds and pelicans trying to get their share of the catch.
Do[edit]
Local fishermen attract sea birds as they prepare to load the morning's catch in Puerto López.
-1.2698-81.072341 Isla de la Plata (Poor Man's Galapagos). Several tour agents organise trips (1½-hour boat ride, lunch included). On the island you will be able to see plenty of blue and red footed boobies, frigate birds, colorful fishes, sea turtles, and if you're lucky, sea lions. The tour is combined with snorkeling and whale watching trips, if it's the right season. The humpback whale season is from June to September. Diving is also possible. You'll pay $1 extra for the use of the pier. The trips to the island are heavily regulated by the local authorities so it does not seem to be possible to hire a local fisherman to take you to the island. $30-45. (updated Feb 2017)
 Isla de Salango (Poor Man's Isla de la Plata). Several tour agents organise trips (30-min boat ride). You will be able to see boobies on the way to the island. The boats drop you off at a beach on the island where you will be able to see frigate birds, and if you're lucky, sea lions. The tour is combined with snorkeling trips which are nice but not too spectacular. You'll pay $1 extra for the use of the pier. You can also go to Salango from the town Salango a $0.50 bus ride south, the prices there are however very similar. $10-15. (updated Feb 2017)
 Machalilla Park. The national park has several entrances and "themes". One of them is the Frailes which is free, there is a nice path that goes through miradors and beaches and end in the Frailes beach where you can swim and snorkel. Another is the Agua Blanca ($5pp) where you'll have a guided visit of the (small) archeological museum, a visit of the lands and finally a bath in sulfur water. You can go to either by taking any bus going north for 50¢. free for Frailes, $5 for Agua Blanca. 
 Horseback riding. You can join a horse (or mule) tour in the nature park. Most of the agencies in town should offer these tours when asked. $40 for a full day.
