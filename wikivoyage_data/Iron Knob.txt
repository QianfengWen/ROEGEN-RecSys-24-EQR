Iron Knob is a community of 110 people (2021) on the Eyre Peninsula. The town was named for its proximity to a prominent outcrop from the flat surrounding landscape that  contained a large deposit of iron ore. 


Understand[edit]
Iron Knob, the first town west of Port Augusta on the Eyre Highway, was based around the local mines, which aren't doing much these days.  However, the town soldiers on, proud of its history, through the efforts of the Progress Association.
Iron Knob's iron ore was of such high quality (upwards of 60% purity) that it led to the development of the Australian steel industry. It supplied iron to the Newcastle Steelworks and Port Kembla in the 1910s and 1920s and Whyalla in the 1930s. 21% of the steel required for the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge was quarried at Iron Knob.
