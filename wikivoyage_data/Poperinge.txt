Poperinge is a charming town in the southwest corner of the province of West Flanders, close to the French border. The town of 20,000 inhabitants (2018) is mostly known for its World War I heritage sites and captivating beer culture with many hop fields in the surrounding area. In the last years Poperinge also has developed itself as a regional hub for cycling and hiking. The municipality consists besides Poperinge of six other communities: Haringe, Krombeke, Proven, Reningelst, Roesbrugge and Watou.


Understand[edit]
Hop harvest in Poperinge
During World War I the battleground was only a few kilometres to sometimes just a few hundred metres away from Poperinge. The town was never captured by the Germans, however, and functioned as a posting station for the Allied army forces going to or from the Ypres Salient. English soldiers that recalled the town for its amusement and prostitutes, named the town affectionately as "Pops". The many cemeteries in the region are a somber reminder of the thousands of soldiers that died in the surrounding countryside.

Buses of De Lijn may be way of seeing the countryside around Poperinge, but please keep in mind that some buses only run once every few hours, which can make sightseeing quite challenging. The Belbus is a service which needs to be booked at least 2 hours before travelling.
The most convenient way to get around is by car, or when the weather allows so, by bicycle or on foot. Most WWI sights in the area are well signed, but it may be helpful to have a map (on paper or digital) with you.
