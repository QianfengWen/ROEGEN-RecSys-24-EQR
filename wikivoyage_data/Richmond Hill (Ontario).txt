Richmond Hill is a city in Southern Ontario in the central portion of York Region. It's part of the Greater Toronto Area, about 20 km north of the downtown core of Toronto.


Understand[edit]
Richmond Hill is the third most populous municipality in York Region and the 28th most populous municipality in Canada. Richmond Hill's population has grown from 102,000 in 1996 to over 195,000 in 2016. Richmond Hill used to be a village and had an interurban running to it from Toronto. As the suburban boom in Toronto started after WWII, Richmond Hill eventually grew to become another suburb in the 1970s and 80s. Today, Richmond Hill hosts a significant Chinese population on its east end and a significant Persian population in the north.
The old part of Richmond Hill runs on Yonge Street from Major Mackenzie Drive to Crosby Avenue.
