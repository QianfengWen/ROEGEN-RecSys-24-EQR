Statue of Robin Hood
Nottingham is a city in England, affectionately known as the "Queen of the Midlands". It is famed for its links with the world-renowned legend of Robin Hood.


Understand[edit]
Nottingham is one of three major cities in the East Midlands of England, the others being nearby Leicester and Derby. Its prosperity was historically derived mostly from the lace making and coal-mining industries, little of which remains. Nottingham has moved towards a more service-based economy. In the 1960s it was famed for having a gender imbalance.
The centre of Nottingham lies on the River Leen and its southern boundary follows the course of the River Trent, which flows from Stoke to the Humber. Nottingham has an estimated city population of 320,000 (2021). The urban area has a population of 730,000 (2021). 
The heart of the city is the Old Market Square, which underwent a major redevelopment in 2006. Most of the main shopping streets are around the square. The Council House, whose tall dome can be seen for miles around, is at the top end of the square. The inside of the Council House is the Exchange Arcade, a shopping centre. A bohemian quarter of the city known as Hockley has arisen close to the Lace Market area. Nottingham receives a lot of tourism, mostly because of the legend of Robin Hood, visiting Sherwood Forest and Nottingham Castle.

Drink[edit]
Nottingham has a lot of historic pubs - this is an advert for one of them from 1840

There are at least three pubs in Nottingham which claim to be amongst the oldest in the city (and the country), so there is no shortage of drinking establishments for visitors. The city has a range of pubs and bars serving drinks late into the night.
A good place to start is the trendy Lace Market area east of Market Square where you will also find many good restaurants. Pubs around the Market Square tend to appeal to younger drinkers with a Wetherspoon's and Yates's Wine Lodge, but the area on the canal side around the Canal House pub tends to be a little more discerning. The Hockley area also provides a range of pleasant bars to suit a range of budgets. The Cornerhouse complex (near the Royal Centre tram stop) contains some really nice bars, particularly 52.95607-1.150151 Revolution, and close to this is The Orange Tree on Shakespeare Street. Slightly further out of the centre in the multicultural and vibrant area known as Sneinton is a wonderful pub called the Lord Nelson with a great garden and real ales. The other historic pubs include The Bell Inn, in the Market Square, and the 52.95114-1.15182 Salutation, on Maid Marian Way, both of which can trace a long history and lay claim to having resident ghosts. Ask at a quiet moment for a tour of the Salutation's cellars, dug by hand into the sandstone rock below the pub and used in centuries past as a secure brewing area. The 52.95209-1.151683 Ned Ludd is also located near the Old Market square and serves local ale from 52.95833-1.180374 Nottingham Brewery. Rock City hosts one of the biggest student disco nights in town, with standard dance/pop music, when popular live rock bands aren't playing in town. For a different experience, try The Pitcher and Piano bar, with a slightly more mature crowd. Built as a large Unitarian church it has been stylishly modernised but still contains the church's architectural history with gothic decor and stained glass windows.

Stay safe[edit]
While overall a safe city, Nottingham has been highlighted by the media for gun and knife crime in its suburbs, acquiring the (mostly tongue-in-cheek) nickname 'Shottingham'. It is best to avoid walking late at night through St Ann's (a council estate northeast of the Victoria shopping centre) and The Meadows (between the railway station and the river). Normal precautions for large western European cities should be undertaken by individuals after dark, especially for lone females.

Go next[edit]
For keen walkers, Matlock and the Derbyshire Peak District can be reached in about an hour by car. To get there by public transport, catch the Red Arrow (£6 'zigzag' day ticket, takes 30 min, every 10 min) from the Victoria Bus station to Derby, and change to the TransPeak (£5.90 each way, takes about an hour, hourly). An alternative for the more budget conscious traveller is the 6.1 bus from Derby to Bakewell, which takes longer but is included in the trentbarton 'zigzag' day ticket.
Derby is a neighboring city and is easily accessible by bus (£6 day ticket).
Lincoln is not too far away by rail.
Sheffield, about an hour away from Nottingham by rail or road, is a slightly larger city and a popular cultural and shopping destination.
There are direct trains from Nottingham to the famous seaside resort of Skegness.
