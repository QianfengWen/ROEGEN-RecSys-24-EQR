Dereham is a town in Norfolk, England. Dereham is a busy market town serving local residents and a wide rural area. The town has a market on Tuesdays and Fridays selling a range of food and household items. The town hosts the headquarters of the Mid-Norfolk Railway, which runs trains over an 11.5-mile heritage railway south to Wymondham.


Understand[edit]
St Withburga's Holy Well
Dereham, sometimes knows as East Dereham and not to be confused with West Dereham (around 15 miles away), has a population of around 18,000.  The town is situated 25 miles to the W of Norwich and 40 miles NNE of Ely.
The Town badge is from the arms of the Bishop of Ely with a deer. The three golden crowns are from the princesses and saints, Withburga, Æthelthryth and Saxburga. The town is on the site of a monastery founded by St Withburga (whose body was stolen by the monks of Ely legend being that the Holy Well in St Nicholas' Church started to flow when her body was stolen).  Æthelthryth was a princess, a Fenland queen and Abbess of Ely.  Saxburga was a queen then regent in Kent until her son came of age after which she moved to live at the Abbey of Ely. Dereham's name derives from a deer park that (is thought to have) existed in the area.
The town is twinned with the town of Rüthen in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is also twinned with Caudebec-lès-Elbeuf, France.

Get in[edit]
By road[edit]
The town lies on the A47 King's Lynn, Dereham, Norwich, Great Yarmouth main road, about 27 miles E of King's Lynn and 18 miles W of Norwich.

By rail[edit]
The town does have a railway station but is serves only a preserved heritage Mid-Norfolk Railway linking the town to Wymondham and running between 3 and 6 trains per day (depending on the day and time of year) - so not a useful route into the town for most people.

By bicycle[edit]
 National Cycle Route (NCR) 13. runs to the north connecting to National Cycle Route 1 (to the North Norfolk Coast and beyond eventually to the Shetland Islands). To the south NCR 13 runs to Thetford, Bury St Edmunds and beyond to Colchester where it connects to NCR 1.   (updated Jun 2017)
