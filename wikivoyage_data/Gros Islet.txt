Gros Islet is a town at the far northern end of Saint Lucia. It is the newest town in Saint Lucia, being the most recent to have been promoted from being a village.
There is a small beach at Gros Islet, but there are larger beaches and several large tourists resorts within walking distance to the north. Heading south, past the marina, the main beach on the west coast is Reduit Beach. The beaches on the east coast are exposed to the Atlantic wind, but are still largely untouched.
Rodney Bay Marina is to the south and becomes a hub of activity when the Atlantic Ralley for Cruisers (ARC) finishes there in December.
Beausejour Cricket Stadium is just outside of Gros Islet and was a venue for the 2007 Cricket World Cup.

Beaches[edit]

 Reduit Beach. This is the most popular beach on the west coast, with the best amenities.

 Cas en Bas. On the east cost, this can be reached by following the (occasionally dirt) road that goes past the Cotton Bay Village resort. The beach has a couple of restaurants, but is still largely untouched. Its a popular spot for kite surfing and a kite surfing school operates from here. 
 Anse Lavoutte. This is an almost completely secluded and untouched beach just around the headland to the south of Cas en Bas. It's popular with kite surfers and locals, who tend to drive there in the 4-wheel drive cars. 
 Gros Islet Beach. Narrow beach on the seafront of Gros Islet town. 
 Pigeon Point Beach. About 1 km long, north of Gros Islet town. The first half of the beach is undeveloped. There are usually few people, except on weekends. The second half of the beach is developed with Landings and Sandals Grande resorts.
