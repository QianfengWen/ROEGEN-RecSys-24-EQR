Malacca City (Malay: Bandaraya Melaka, and officially Melaka City) is a city and the capital of the state of Malacca, Malaysia. Malacca is a vibrant old city with a unique historical and cultural background. The city centre is listed as a  UNESCO World Heritage Site, along with George Town, Penang.


Understand[edit]
Malacca was the capital of a powerful Malay kingdom before the colonial era, and was influenced by  subsequent Portuguese, Dutch and British rule.

History[edit]
Before the arrival of the first Sultan, Malacca was a simple fishing village inhabited by local Malays. The Malacca Sultanate was founded by Parameswara, also called Iskandar Shah or Sri Majara, the last Raja of Singapura (the Malay name of Singapore) following a Majapahit attack in 1377. Parameswara found his way to Malacca in 1400 where he found a port, accessible in all seasons and on the strategically located narrowest point of the Malacca Strait. This later became Malacca.
There are some interesting legends surrounding the foundation and naming of Malacca. According to the 16th century Malay Annals, the city was founded by Parameswara. Some believe it more likely that he was a Hindu prince and political fugitive from nearby Java. The legend goes that Parameswara was out on a hunt in the region and had stopped to refresh himself near what is now the Malacca River. Standing near a melaka (Indian gooseberry) tree he was surprised to witness one of his hunting dogs so startled by a mouse deer that it fell into the river. Parameswara took this as a propitious sign of the weak overcoming the powerful and decided to build the capital of his new kingdom where he stood, naming it for the tree under which he had been resting. Another account says Malacca is derived from the Arabic word Malakat, meaning "market". Malacca had a navigable harbour sheltered by nearby Sumatra across the narrow straits. It was supplied with an ample quantity of fresh water, enjoyed a prime location relative to the shifting monsoon winds, and had a central location in regional trade patterns, all of which soon made it a prosperous trading town. Its fortunes increased with its official adoption of Islam in the 14th century. The Sultans of Malacca were soon attracting Arab traders from far afield. However, Malacca continued to trade with merchants of all races and religions.
After the visit of the Chinese Muslim Admiral Cheng Ho in the mid-15th century, contact between China and Malacca intensified. In exchange for protection against Siam, Malacca became a vassal state to Ming China. To ensure Malacca's safety, a new and powerful kingdom was founded by the Sultan of Samudra-Pasai. Cheng Ho's visit also sparked off the first wave of Chinese immigration to Malacca, with many of these Chinese settlers taking on local Malay brides to give rise to the Peranakan community. The result of this is a unique fusion of Chinese and Malay cultures. The men are addressed as Babas and the women Nyonyas by their servants meaning "master" and "mistress".
The power of the Malays began to rise through the 15th century. In the Malay Annals, Sultan Mansur Shah was mentioned as having six wives, and the fifth was stated to be a daughter of the Ming Emperor.  However, in the Chinese chronicles, no such event was recorded.
Things started to change with the arrival of the Portuguese in 1509. They were at first welcomed, but Indian traders soon turned the sultan against the Portuguese and they had to flee. In 1511 the Portuguese returned, and at their second attempt seized the city. During the Portuguese colonial period, many Portuguese men settled in the city and took on local brides, giving rise to the Eurasian community, whose culture is a unique fusion of European and Asian traditions. The Portuguese turned the city into a massive walled fortress complete with a tower bristling with cannon. It was believed that such fortifications could withstand the encroachments of other European powers eager for a slice of the Asian luxury goods trade.
An alliance between the Dutch and the Sultan of Johor saw the loss much of Malacca's power. In 1641 the Dutch navy put a blockade on Malacca and they seized the city after six months. During the siege much of the Portuguese city was destroyed.
Only after 150 years did the Dutch lose their hold on Malacca. In 1795 The Netherlands was conquered by the French, and the British were keen to take over the Dutch holdings in Malacca. By that time, Malacca had lost most of its former importance, although it remained an important part of Asian trade routes.
The A Famosa gate is all that remains of the old Portuguese and Dutch forts. As the Napoleonic Wars wound down the British knew Malacca would be returned to Dutch control. In order to make the city indefensible, the city walls were blown down. A last minute intervention by a British officer, the young Sir Stamford Raffles (founder of British Singapore) saved the gate. Shortly after its return to Dutch rule, the Dutch and British governments swapped colonies - British Bencoolen in Sumatra for Dutch Malacca.

Talk[edit]
Malacca is a culturally diverse city, and this is reflected in the number of languages in use in daily life. As in other parts of Malaysia, Malay is the lingua franca, and English is widely spoken in tourist areas and among upper-class locals. The ethnic Chinese community mainly speaks Hokkien, though many are also able to speak Cantonese and Mandarin. The ethnic Indian community mainly consists of Tamil speakers, though there is also a significant Sikh minority that mainly speaks Punjabi. The Peranakan community speaks a distinctive Malay-based creole with strong Hokkien influences known as Baba Malay, while the Portuguese-Eurasian community speaks a Portuguese-based creole known as Kristang.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
2.265102.2511 Malacca International Airport (MKZ  IATA) (10 km from the city of Malacca). There are no longer any commercial flights to Malacca, so your only option for flying in is general aviation. (updated May 2024)
Ground transportation:
Batang Bus (yellow, cream and red) from Melaka Sentral will go past the airport. Buses stop by the main road about 200 m from the airport building. Tuahbas No. 65 (blue and white) to Taman Merdeka also goes from Melaka Sentral past the airport via Bachang.
Kuala Lumpur International Airport KLIA, (KUL IATA) is the nearest airport with commercial flights and is 1½-2 hr away by car. The bus company Transnasional runs 4 direct buses daily at 09:15, 11:45, 16:15 & 20:15 (RM22/16 adult/child), travelling time 2½ hours, but if you miss them, you'll have to detour via KL or take a taxi with travelling time about 1½ hours (fixed "budget" fare RM159, one-way, counter inside Domestic Arrivals, the guard will happily let you and your trolley of luggage back into this area from outside).

 Malaysia Airlines, Lot 1&2, Block A, Ground floor, Century Mahkota Hotel, J. Merdeka, Melaka, ☏ +60 6 282 9597. It does not fly to Malacca, but it maintains an office here. 
By bus[edit]
Many long-distance express buses connect Malacca with both Kuala Lumpur, Seremban, Johor Bahru, Singapore and other parts of Peninsular Malaysia. All long-distance and local buses operate from the 2.2208102.25012 Melaka Sentral bus terminal, a good 4.5 km from the historic core of the city.
To reach the main historical district take bus number 17 which departs from the domestic bus terminal of Melaka Sentral at the bus bay '17'. This bus goes to Chinatown and Taming Sari. The closest stop to Chinatown is Dutch Square, which you will easily identify from the brick red Christ Church and Stadthuys. Price is RM2/person (July 2017). Bus 17 is a loop line, so when you need to go back to Melaka Sentral you can take it at the same place where you got off, but using bus 17 back to Melaka Sentral does take much longer than the inbound journey (about 40 min). A much faster (and cheaper) way is to walk to the end of Jonker Walk until Jalan Kabu. You will see a Tamil Methodist Church on your right and a bus stop (Perhentian Jalan Kabu) across the street (named Jalan Kabu). From there, the bus costs RM1.5 (July 2017) and takes 15 min to reach Melaka Sentral. Buses 17 run about every 20-40 min depending on the traffic.
From Sentral, if you wish to take a taxi to the center instead then head towards the rear of the building. There's an official taxi stand that will appoint a driver to you. These are typically dirty with rude and aggressive drivers out to cheat both locals and foreigners. They would refuse to use the meter and charge exorbitant prices for short distances (a ride from Melaka Sentral to the main tourist area at Jonker Street would be about RM 25 and above). Locals would typically refer to taxi drivers as "samseng" (Malay for gangsters) and recommend using ride-sharing/e-hailing options such as Uber or the local Malaysian company called Grab as cheaper and more professional alternatives. A ride to Jonker would be about RM8 for a comfortable clean car and friendly local driver. If arriving by bus at Melaka Sentral, head to the main entrance to request a pick up. Do not go to the back entrance where the overpriced taxis wait. You would need to download the apps on your smart phone prior to arriving.

From Kuala Lumpur[edit]
Southbound buses now leave from new bus terminal Bersepadu Selatan (TBS), which is next to LRT station and KTM Komuter station Bandar Tasik Selatan. Easiest way to get there from Chinatown is walk to Kuala Lumpur old railway station (opposite side of canal from LRT Pasar Seni station, use overpass) and take KTM Komuter train for RM1.10 or take LRT from Masjid Jamek station. Buses leave every half hour, price ticket to Melaka Sentral is between RM10 and RM15, and the ride takes 2 hr 15 min.
There are also several daily buses from Kuala Lumpur International Airport (for details see couple of paragraphs above).

From Singapore[edit]
Many bus companies operate from Lavender St. bus terminal directly to Melaka Sentral. Bus schedules vary between companies but some operates have hourly buses. Best show up and buy tickets in advance if you want to travel on Saturday morning and return Sunday afternoon as many Singaporean tourists have the same idea. The fares can vary starting from around SGD14-50 one way depending on class of the bus.
Bus rides often take 3½–5 hours depending on how long it takes to cross the Singapore-Malaysia borders, which during peak periods can cause massive delay. You will have to get your passport stamped at each end of the border and you must bring all your luggage with you when you are making an entrance into each country. Generally, the bus will wait for you at the border but sometimes they will expect you to catch the next bus if you take too long to get through customs. Make sure you remember what your bus looks like (the number plate is quite a handy thing to remember). The buses will also have a 20- to 30-min rest stop along the way where you can purchase food and use the toilet facilities (whose cleanliness can be questionable). The Singapore customs area has decent toilet facilities, if required.
Some of the companies operating to/from Malacca are:

Transnasional, is the largest long-distance bus operator in Malaysia. It links the state with a host of destinations in Peninsular Malaysia like Kuala Lumpur, Seremban, Singapore and further afield. Transnasional buses depart from Malacca City (Melaka Sentral), Alor Gajah, A'Famosa Resort and Masjid Tanah.
Malacca-Kuala Lumpur Express: Hourly buses between Malacca City and Kuala Lumpur from 05:30-19:00.  Tickets cost RM12.50.
Jebat Ekspres: Buses to Kuala Lumpur via Masjid Tanah and Alor Gajah.
Malacca-Singapore Express: Hourly buses between Malacca City and Johor Bahru and Singapore 08:00-19:00. Tickets cost RM19 to/from Johor Baru, and RM22.00 to Singapore. The route from Singapore to Malacca is SGD20
Delima Express: Buses from Singapore to Malacca/ Malacca to Singapore. Tickets cost SGD20.80/RM22 (RM/26 in July 2017). The boarding location at Singapore is City Plaza @ Payar Lebar. Online bookings are available.
Mayang Sari Express: Buses to/from Johor Baru. Tickets cost RM19.
MCW Express: Frequent express services to Muar, Johor
707 Travel: Favourite bus company of Chinese-Singaporeans going to Malacca. Departs 4-5 times to/from Malacca (Melaka Sentral) and Singapore (Queen Street). Does not stop at Yong Peng, so the trip can be as short as 3.5 hours. SGD25 from Singapore; RM25 from Malacca. In monsoon season around New Year's prices are SGD20 from Singapore. There are horror stories coming out of this company but don't be put off.  Their communication may be a bit poor but if you take too long to get through customs, you just need to show the next 707 bus your ticket and you will be on your way. However, it is not fun hanging out on the Malaysian border as there is no air conditioning.
From Johor Bahru[edit]
very regular 1/30-60min, RM 20-21, duration ~2h30.

By train[edit]
Malacca Town is not served by any railway lines. The nearest railway station is at Pulau Sebang/Tampin, ☏ +60 6 341 1034, in the Alor Gajah district about 30 km (19 mi) away. The station is on the main Kuala Lumpur-Johor Bahru line and served by all trains.
Getting there:
By bus:The "Tai Lye" bus goes from the Tampin townsite to Malacca. You'll be looking for bus #26. When you get off the train, walk down the road to the right about 400 m until you reach the main road. You now have two options. 1) Cross the road and wait until bus 26 comes toward you, wave madly at it, and it will stop to pick you up. 2) When you reach the main road, turn left and walk about 600 m into town. You'll come to an intersection that T's the main road, with a road branching left up a hill. Walk up that road about 200 m and the bus station is on your left. This is a less risk but more walk option. If you've got lots of luggage, you can also take a taxi from the train station to the bus station. If you get lost walking, just ask locals for the "bus station". Few speak English here, but they'll understand where you want to get to. The bus fare is RM4.30, and you'll need ringgit cash to pay it with. The trip takes about an hour and a half.
"Salira" bus (light blue and yellow) also goes from Melaka Sentral to Tampin via Ayer Keroh and Durian Tunggal. Get off bus at same spot as Tai Lye.
By taxi: There should be a taxi or two at the train station waiting for someone like you to come along. If there isn't, walk into town with the above directions. You'll see one soon enough. The cost will be somewhere around RM50, but you can try haggling a bit. Either way, get them to take you to your hotel, or if they can only take you to Malacca Sentral, get a cheaper fare (don't wait to discuss this in the taxi!) If you have the cash, and more than just a briefcase, this is the easier option. The cars are air conditioned (another bargaining chip if they aren't), and have trunk space for your gear. Plus, you could share the cost with up to three other people. Or if you are alone, maybe there is a local who's also trying to get to Malacca and would appreciate a free ride? Remember to be safe though. Don't get into your taxi until the driver has, always pay at the destination, and watch your stuff! The trip by taxi takes about 40 minutes.

By car[edit]
Malacca can be accessed from the North South Expressway. When coming from the south, drive along E2 and leave the expressway at the Ayer Keroh exit.  Alternatively, one can leave the highway at the Simpang Empat exit and proceed through normal road to Malacca.  This route will pass through the town of Alor Gajah and now with the new highway (ring road) completed, the trip from Simpang Empat to Malacca will take approximately 20-30 min by car.
Malacca city is on the Coastal Trunk Road (Federal Route 5), and can be accessed from the Main Trunk Road (Federal Route 1) by turning off at Simpang Kendong or Tampin, Negeri Sembilan.
Malacca is 150 km (93 mi) from Kuala Lumpur, 216 km (134 mi) from Johor Bahru, and 90 km (56 mi) from Port Dickson.

Rent a car[edit]
For those who want an easy and direct way out from either Kuala Lumpur's LCCT or KLIA airport to Malacca, an easy way is to rent or hire a car or van. It will take you 1-1½ hr to get there. Prices range from RM150-RM400 depending upon the vehicle type and rental duration.

By taxi[edit]
Chartered taxi services are available from the end of Jalan Kee Ann. They travel within Malacca state and outside Malacca such as to KLIA International Airport and Kuala Lumpur and carry up to 4 passengers at a time. Many taxis will use a set fare rather than a meter for such trips, so you should agree on a price before getting in. If you rather avoid the negotiations, most hotels are able to book these trips for you (although some may take a rather large commission, so check the fare), or you can book online through a range of companies.  Typical fares to KLIA are RM150-200, depending also on the car model. Family-taxis are available from some companies. Car apps are just under RM200 as of Sep 2023, a worthwhile 2-day wage and mini-vacation for some gig workers.

By boat[edit]

Get around[edit]
2°11′44″N 102°14′55″EMap of Malacca
Malacca is by no means a small city, but most of the main sites are within easy walking distance from each other and are best explored on foot.
Be mindful not to hold up traffic while taking pictures of buildings. The locals have generally good driving sense and adhere to traffic laws.

By car[edit]
Streets in the older/historical part of the city are very narrow, so they quickly become clogged during peak hours. This is especially so during the weekends, when cars from other parts of Malaysia and from Singapore flood to the city. Finding a car park lot is also extremely difficult during weekends. Most of the roads are also one-way, so plan your route properly.

By taxi[edit]
Avoid taxis if possible and use e-hailing Uber or Grab rides. Taxis are known to be rude and aggressive, and refuse to use meters and overcharge passengers. Chartered taxis would cost about RM20 to go anywhere in the city whereas an e-hailing ride may be lower than half the price for a much safer and cleaner car and driver.

By bus[edit]
Malacca Town Bus No 17: Melaka Sentral Terminal to the historic core, Mahkota Parade, Melaka Raya and the Portuguese Settlement. The fare from Melaka Sentral to Makhota Parade is RM1.50 to 2.00 (August 2018). The last bus from Melaka Sentral leaves at 20:30, after which you would have to take a taxi which costs RM25 to Mahkota Parade, or Uber/Grab for RM8. To find bus No 17 at Melaka Sentral, either look for a blue sign saying "Domestic Buses" or ask someone where it is. The domestic bus area is located to the rear of the Sentral Terminal. The domestic terminal section is a semi-circle arrangement, with parking bays for buses numbered 1 to 18. For the No 17 buses to the historic core, you need to go the No 17 bus bay. Also just inside the doors where the public buses depart, is a small desk for information. On the way back from Makhota Parade, bus 17 goes along the main road (Jalan Syed Abdul Aziz or Lebuhraya Coastal) to the south of the Makhota Parade shopping centre, across the big bridge over the harbour and then its turns north on the road with the same name and right again to Jalan Kubu before stopping next to the Tamil Church next to Jonkers Walk. From this stop, it takes 10-15 min back to the bus station rather than 1 hour if you take it going the other way. To get to Melaka Sentral from Jonker Street, walk to the north end of Jonkier St, to a bus-stop opposite the Tamil Methodist Church  (Perhentian Julan Kubu) or outside the Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTM) City Campus on Jalan Hang Tuah and take Bus No 17 (RM1, 10 minutes).

Kenderaan Aziz (red and white): Buses from Melaka Sentral to Muar via Padang Temu also go past the historic core, Mahkota Parade and Melaka Raya
The bus system in Malacca has greatly improved over the years. While not being actually good it's close enough to be useful at times. You can find a decent time schedule on Google Maps. There is always the provider website, though you may find it difficult to navigate.

Others[edit]
Trishaws, complete with blaring pop music and fake flowers, are available for short trips between tourist spots or circular tours. The drivers are very cheerful and friendly. The going rate is RM40 per hour, but settle any price in advance.
Bicycle, hire a bicycle or join a cycling tour group, see the Do section for cycling hire and groups. Some of the hostels, homestays and hotels either provide loan or rental bicycles to their guests for local sightseeing. Major local attractions have an extensive internal road or track system often have bicycles available.
River boat : Melaka River Cruise offers a 'hop-on hop-off' service (RM30/day), but during busy times (esp. weekend evenings) don't expect to get a seat anywhere other than near the ticket office landing.

The older part of the city proper has, in addition to the old palace and the large buildings left by the Europeans, many private houses and shops from nearly a century or more ago, put up by Chinese traders. Many of these have beautiful details such as moulded porcelain tiles and painted plaster reliefs on the front. Unfortunately, they tend to be not well preserved and the city government decided to paint all the buildings in the historical district a bright brick red some years ago, as the constant spitting by passers-by was proving a nuisance, which detracts from their aesthetic value.
On Tuesdays, many museums, shops and restaurants are closed, especially in the Jonker Street area. If you have only one day to spend in Malacca, do not go on a Tuesday!

Buy[edit]
Malacca is famed for its antiques, with many a beautiful shophouse interior now filled to the brim with artefacts from all around the Asia Pacific region. Your chances of finding a bargain here are minimal though; prices in many of the tourist-oriented places are absurdly high by any standard, and although many items are touted as being 'more than a hundred years old', most is brand new but 'aged' at the back of the shops.

Shops[edit]
2.196337102.2469631 Beyond Treasures, 57 Jalan Hang Jebat, ☏ +60 62 81 94 66, beyondtreasures@yahoo.com.my. 12:00-20:00. Woodcrafts, including Asian masks, antiques and souvenirs.

 Raz Kashmir (Secrets of Kashmir), No. 12 Jalan Tukang Emas and No. 47 Lorong Hang Jebat Melaka and Lot 75A Mukim 17 Jalan Batu Ferringhi (opposite Batu Ferringhi Police Station). (Jonker Street Malacca and Batu Ferringhi Penang.), ☏ +60 14 328 3131. Specialises in Kashmiri, Indian and Nepali crafts. Handmade textiles where no two items are the same. Good quality items.

Have a leisure stroll along the street, observing the locals' life, catching a free performance and shop for some for antiques and some local souvenirs, make sure you bargain with the vendors. Try some unique stuff to eat, like grapes-dipped in chocolate or caramel encrusted kiwis. Kaya(a spread made from coconut) filled waffles is a must-try. Cheap Chinese electronic playthings are available too if you have an appetite for them. (updated Feb 2017)
Night Market/Pasar Malam - A market held from evening to around 21:00 at night everyday (though at different locations. Tuesday in Kampung Lapan and Friday in Malim).

Shopping malls[edit]

Food and local delicacies[edit]
For restaurants, cafes and dining see the Eat section below.

 Bee Bee (Lian Choo) Homemade Pineapple Tarts, 307-A Jalan Parameswara, Bandar Hilir (a traditional wooden house almost at the end of the street, opposite the Bandar Hilir Jail House), ☏ +60 6-286 9735. When they say 'homemade' here, they really mean it literally. There's no other homemade delicacy in Malacca that can beat this place as both its production and location are authentically traditional. Oven fresh, these are probably the best local Melaka Nyonya pineapple tarts you will find (there are other more touristy ones scattered in Jonker Street). RM14 a box. 
 Baba Charlie Nyonya Cake, 72 Jalan Tengkera Pantai 2 (directly opposite the famous Masjid Tengkera (Tranquerah Mosque), inside a narrow path beside a row shophouses with Wall's signboard), ☏ +60 19-666 2907. Another hidden gem where you can buy all kinds of authentic Nyonya kuihs you can ever imagined under one roof. Too many to choose from, you wish you could camp there and try it all. All are freshly made on the spot. Highly recommended is the ondeh-ondeh (green glutinous rice flour ball with coconut sugar (Gula Melaka) stuffing). 
Eat[edit]
Besides the usual Malaysian fare, you'll be able to sample some rather peculiar Malaccan food. On top of the list is of course Peranakan or Baba-Nyonya food, which used to be totally uncommercialised and confined to the kitchens of old grandmothers. Now, there is a string of restaurants claiming to serve Peranakan food, but most unfortunately seem to be on the tour bus circuit. The dishes are slightly different from those of the Penang Peranakan. Usual ones include babi pongteh (pork belly in bean sauce, or sometimes a halal variant known as ayam pongteh that uses chicken instead), ayam buah keluak (chicken cooked with a bitter nut) and a whole array of desserts. 
Another famous Malacca dish is what is commonly called "chicken rice ball". Although it is called Hainanese chicken rice, it is not from Hainan, China, but invented by the Hainanese immigrants to Malaysia a long time ago. The chicken for this dish is very much the same as the boiled chicken offered throughout Malaysia; what is unique is the rice - it comes in ping-pong sized balls. 
Yet another Malaccan speciality is satay celup. It is like lok-lok found in other parts of the country but instead of dipping your skewered food (fishballs, crabsticks, meat, prawns, etc.) into boiling water, you dip them into a boiling vat of satay sauce. The sight of boiling satay sauce may not appeal to you but the crowds at the satay celup outlets seem to suggest that many have overcome their phobias.
Of course, Malacca is where you'll find Portuguese-Eurasian food. The greatest concentration of outlets is at the Portuguese Settlement. Seafood is popular, as are the fiery "devil curries".
For local Malay delicacies, worth trying:

Asam Pedas ("sour hot"), the signature dish of the state. A very hot and mildly sour fish curry accompanied by white rice. Normally eaten during lunch and dinner. From RM4.50.
Sambal Belacan, very spicy local chilli prawn paste.
Cencaluk, can be found sold along the roads near Klebang Beach. Made of fermented krills. A bit weird tasting for those who are not used to it.
Lemang, glutinous rice cooked in bamboo, sold on the side of the road to Teluk Mas.
Ikan Bakar (baked fish), head to Umbai, Pernu or Serkam for a dinner of fresh caught grilled fish and crustaceans.
Kuih Udang (shrimp cakes), you can find this popular tea time dish in Alor Gajah town. The sauce is nice too.
Kuih-muih, traditional cakes and desserts like dodol, wajik, lempok, inang-inang, gula melaka and many more are sold in shopping malls at Bandar Hilir, Klebang Beach and kampung areas throughout the state.
Other local but not typically Malay food:

Roti John, an invented omelette sandwich, very popular among the Malays. For a good one, look for the restaurant in Tanjung Kling.
Local burger, the street stall vendors, generally local Malay men serve quite tasty and satisfying burgers and hotdogs and it's cheaper than ordinary fast food restaurants too.
The tourism boom has seen many new food and beverage outlets open in Malacca, and especially in the heritage area of Jonker and Heeren Street. However, competition is great and some outlets fail to survive. Places you discover on your first visit may not be around anymore on your second.

Drink[edit]
When in Malacca, don't miss the cendol ("chen-dul"), a sweet dessert of coconut milk, lurid green noodles and gula Melaka (Malacca sugar), made from palm sap. Though it's not a drink, it's the ultimate thirst quencher.

Night clubs and bars[edit]
Melaka Raya is where most of Malacca's relatively limited nightlife is to be found, with many of the city's pubs, discos and KTV located in that area.

Arena Club, R&B Club in Town behind Holiday Inn at the pier which is known as "The Jetty". Nightly live music including 'R&B', 'reggaeton' and 'house' music. This is the place for those who like to go past midnight.
Movida, the new hotspot for younger generation of club/pub-goers. Located centrally on the ground floor of the latest hotel and mall landmark, the Hatten Square (across the famous Dataran Pahlawan Megamall), its music and deejay is at par with those in Kuala Lumpur and some say even in Europe.
Mixx, is yet another new location for some upscale clubbing experience. It's slightly distant from the main road, just behind Mahkota Parade facing the flyover (opposite to Mahkota Hotel), but a gem is always a hidden one. Because of its popularity among the youngsters, it could be crowded at its peak.
