Monaghan is the county town of County Monaghan. It's at the northern edge of the Republic of Ireland, close to the border with Northern Ireland. It's a quiet relaxing place: in 2016 the population was 7678. The name derives from Irish Muineachán, a "brake" or overgrown hillock, probably referring to the local drumlins.  
The TIC is in the Market House, opposite the County Museum. It's open M-F 10:00-13:00.

Rossmore Forest Park is within hiking distance, but you need wheels to get around the district.

Through town they follow the figure-of-8 one-way clockwise loop via the library, hospital, bus station and Monaghan Institute, so they're almost hourly M-Sa, but no buses on Sunday.

Do[edit]




 Nothing to lose but their chains 
In the revolutionary fervour following the Bolshevik coup in Russia, several places elsewhere set up "soviets" - communist governing committees of "workers and peasants". Ireland's soviets were against the backdrop of the war for independence from Britain, and the first, in Feb 1919, was in Monaghan Lunatic Asylum. It was more like a staff lock-in, and they won a reduction of their working week from 93 to 56 hours, a pay rise, and the right to go home when their shift ended.


Rossmore Castle was demolished in 1975
