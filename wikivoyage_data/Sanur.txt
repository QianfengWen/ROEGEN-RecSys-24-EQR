Sanur is a town on the east coast of South Bali. Sanur is Bali's oldest upscale resort area and is a mature beach-side town. Despite the abundance of restaurants and accommodation, it has a quiet and relaxed feel to it. Sanur tends to appeal most to middle-aged and older families, especially Europeans. Most hotels in Sanur are big, with spacious gardens.


Understand[edit]
The Sanur area is sandwiched between the main Jalan Ngurah Rai bypass and the beach. One main route called Jalan Danau Tamblingan runs north to south through the town and it is easy to orient yourself with reference to this road.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Sanur is a 20-30 minute taxi ride from the Ngurah Rai International Airport, and a pre-paid coupon costs Rp150,000. There are plenty of metered taxis all over the island who will be keen to take you to Sanur.
If you are driving yourself, this is one of the more straightforward areas of Bali to find as the main Jalan Bypass Ngurah Rai is the western boundary of Sanur. There are many well signposted exit points from this main road into the heart of Sanur. Allow about 20 minutes driving time from Kuta or Legian, about 30 minutes from Seminyak or Ubud and 10 to 15 minutes from Denpasar.

By bus[edit]
Sanur is well serviced by shuttle buses and bemos from the north and south and also from Denpasar's Tegal terminal.
From Denpasar, Teman bus (Trans Metro Dewata) K3B ends in Matahari Terbit Sanur, Rp 4,400. 
From Kuta or Jimbaran, Teman bus K5B, Rp 4,400.
The bus company Perama has its Sanur office in Jalan Hangtuah, and offers direct transfer here from Candidasa, Kuta, Lovina, Padang Bai and Ubud.
There's also a bus service called Trans Sarbagita that runs the following route Terminal Batu Bulan (Gianyar) - Tohpati (DPS) - Sanur (DPS) - Kuta Central Park (Badung) - Jimbaran (Badung) - Nusa Dua (Badung).
Kura-Kura Bus is another bus company that passes through Sanur and other popular areas in Bali.

By boat[edit]
Boats from Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan and Gili Islands arrive at the Sanur Harbour at the end of Jalan Matahari Terbit, and detailed schedules are given in the Nusa Lembongan article.

Get around[edit]
0°0′0″N 0°0′0″EMap of Sanur
Jalan Danau Tamblingan, the main street in Sanur, has a number of outlets for car, motorbike and bicycle rental. A large number of metered taxis patrol the streets looking for passengers. Local bemos run with some regularity up and down both Jalan Danau Tamblingan and Jalan Danau Poso.
Sanur is also a great place to walk. Distances are not large, the streets are relatively quiet, and there is a splendid, paved beach front path which runs the whole length of the district.

On foot[edit]
Walking in Sanur is pleasant. The pavement is about 2.5 m wide along Sanur Beach, suitable for the senior citizens who frequent this town to avoid the loud nightlife in nearby Kuta. Rental bikes sometimes use the pavement, too, but no motorcycles do.

By bicycle[edit]
Sanur is possibly the most cycle friendly part of mainland Bali. It has some cycle lanes such as along Jalan Danau Tamblingan going south only (returning via the beach pathway north makes a nice loop ride). The long paved beach pathway allows bicycles as well as pedestrians but you need to cycle slowly giving way to pedestrians. There are plenty of places to rent a bicycle for the day. Along the beach it costs typically Rp50,000 per day. If you hire away from the beach area such as on or near Jalan Danau Tamblingan the price is cheaper, typically about Rp30,000 per day.

This is a town with a wealth of cultural, natural and historical attractions, as well as the shopping and beach-related sights.

Do[edit]
The paved beachfront path at the Sanur Hyatt, looking east
Sanur's splendid paved beachfront cycle-path stretches some 5 km from the Jalan Mertasari area in south Sanur, north to the main beach at Jalan Hangtuah. This makes for a lovely scenic bike ride, especially in the early morning. Some bikes are better maintained than others so you might want to test your hire-bike close to home for a while in case the pedals have a tendency to fall off. Bicycles typically cost per day about Rp 30,000 if rented from town, or Rp 50,000 if rented from along the beach.

Diving[edit]
Although the diving available around Sanur is not the best Bali has to offer, nearly all of Bali's most established dive operators are located here. All offer trips further afield.

Festivals[edit]

Traditional Balinese giant kites up to 10 m in length are made and flown competitively by teams from different villages around Bali. The origins of this event are as a festival intended to send a message to the Hindu Gods to create abundant crops and harvests. Aside from the organised festival, from June to August each year, visitors will see many giant kites being flown.
