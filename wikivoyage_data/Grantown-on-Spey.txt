Grantown-on-Spey is a town in  the Spey Valley in the central Scottish Highlands, 20 miles southeast of Inverness. To the west is the "strath" or broad valley of the River Spey, which here narrows to descend east through the Cairngorms towards the coast in Moray. Dulnain Bridge, Nethy Bridge and Cromdale are nearby small villages also described on this page. 


Understand[edit]
Grantown was a planned settlement built on a grid pattern from 1765, and has long been a Highland holiday resort. Brief visitors include Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth II, while future Burmese leader Aung San Suu Kyi lived here with her young family for most of 1975. Its Gaelic name is Baile nan Granndach; in 2020 the population was 2510.

Cairngorms National Park closest section to Grantown is Abernethy Forest, accessed above Nethy Bridge. It's a remnant of the original Caledonian Forest and much is a nature reserve.
Dulnain Bridge is a small village 3 miles from Grantown along A95. At its east entrance are several roche moutonnées. The Ice Age in the Cairngorms was a static affair: ice sat atop the mountains and polished them into rounded bare rock, and seldom moved as glaciers to create distinctive U-shaped valleys. But in this area the ice left behind "erratics" - great boulders that look like sheep from a distance.
57.30405-3.660442 Old farm machinery is displayed at the roadside near the rocks - ploughs and similar implements mostly from the Muckrach estate. There's a picnic table next to the display.
57.265-3.6583 Nethy Bridge is a village five miles south of Grantown. It worked at forestry and sawmills, and was called Abernethy until the railway arrived in the 1860s. There was already an Abernethy on that line so the company simply renamed the village, and it became a tourist resort. The line closed in 1968 thanks to Beeching. The bridge over the River Nethy is by Telford, and there's a scenic dell.
End of the line at Broomhill
57.2836-3.66724 Broomhill station is the north terminus of the Strathspey Railway, a heritage line. The original line ran through the valley from Aviemore to Forres until the Beeching cuts of 1965, when the station was demolished. It was rebuilt in 2002 in period style, serving as "Glenbogle" in the TV drama Monarch of the Glen to 2005. Most visitors start their ride at Aviemore, and the train makes an extended stop at  Boat of Garten for the main collection of locomotives and rolling stock, but you can start your trip at Broomhill. Further restoration of the line towards Grantown is blocked by the A95. As if in denial, the train chuffs on for a short distance beyond Broomhill then comes to a dead-end in the fields; the locomotive changes ends via the passing loop and the train returns south.
57.2772-3.64945 Castle Roy a mile north of Nethy Bridge is the stump of Clan Comyn's 12th century fortress. It's on a drumlin, a mound of glacial rubble, so it has a good view and is a popular picnic spot where Highland cattle roam. Donations welcome.
57.336-3.546 Cromdale is a tiny village further down the Spey valley on A95. It was on the same railway line as Nethy Bridge: the old station has been privately preserved. Note the old stone cheese-press built into the wall of the lane. The ballad Haughs of Cromdale portrays the two-part battle here as a bold Jacobite victory, but it was an abject defeat. King James II of England / VII of Scotland had been ousted in 1688 but his forces continued to resist. In 1690 they marched into the Spey valley hoping to gather support, but instead were weakened by desertion. They got as far as Cromdale and on 30 April were met by government forces, who began to scatter and slay them, but a thick fog came down. Next day the Jacobites regrouped and skirmished again but were routed. Fleeing, they tried to seize the castle of Loch an Eilein near Aviemore, but were repulsed by the stout widow who held it. And so ended James' last stand in Scotland, though his son the "Old Pretender" and grandson the "Young Pretender" (Bonnie Prince Charlie) resumed the cause, until it was crushed at Culloden in 1745.
