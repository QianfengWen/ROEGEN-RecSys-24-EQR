Demre is a town in Lycia on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey, with a population of 27,700 in 2022. It stands over the ruins of ancient Myra, where Saint Nicholas was bishop in the 4th century AD. His legendary generosity gave rise to the tradition of Santa Claus.


Understand[edit]
The city of Myra stood in a valley on the Lycian coast, well established by the 4th century BC and remaining important through Roman and Byzantine times. The Hellenistic people of this coast were early adopters of Christianity: St Nicholas was born in nearby Patara in 270 AD and was bishop of Myra until his death in 343. In later years the valley silted up, so the harbour was lost, and Myra sank into obscurity and river mud. 
Eastern Christendom attached legends to St Nicholas, many describing his generosity, but he was little known in the west until 1078. Then a gang stole most of his bones from Myra and took them home to Bari, where they remain. Bari was a stop-off for Crusaders going to and from the Levant, and so his fame spread, and another gang from Venice stole smaller bones that the Bari raiders hadn’t bothered with. 
17th century Europe had a tradition of giving gifts on 6 Dec, feast-day of St Nicholas, but the Lutherans shifted this to Christmas. In Holland his name was garbled as Sinterklaas, and Dutch settlers took him to the United States. There he was anglicised as Santa Claus, acquired his reindeer and sleigh, put on weight, and was said to live at the North Pole. He often wore green until the 20th century decked him in red. Thus began a new era of pilgrimage, with crowds flocking to the shrines of retail in the weeks before Christmas, and cheap aviation launched package tours to several places in the far north where he and his helpers and reindeer might live. 
In 2005 the township of Demre was created by merging two villages, and the mayor had the bright idea of replacing the statue of St Nicholas with that of Santa. More recognisable, he said. There were howls of protest and in 2008 Santa was ejected, but it was enough to put Demre on the tour bus circuit. Many parents think it well worth the trip to see the ashen looks on their children’s faces, and stifling of expectations of presents, when shown Santa’s tomb.

The church was again rebuilt in the 8th century and in the 11th added a monastery, but the monks were unable to stop the relics being stolen away to Bari in 1087. Under Seljuk Turkish rule the church was disused and filled with mud, until restored and modified in 1862 under the aegis of Tsar Alexander II.
