 Wakefield is a picturesque village Municipality of La Pêche on the Gatineau River in the Gatineau Hills near Ottawa. It is on the Quebec side of the river, but is predominantly English-speaking.


Understand[edit]
Wakefield was founded in 1830 by Irish, Scottish, and English immigrants. It went on to become a lumber town (like so many others near Ottawa), then became a bedroom community suburb of Ottawa/Gatineau. Nowadays, it's best known as the home of the Black Sheep Inn (see below).

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Take any bridge from Ottawa to Gatineau but the Macdonald Cartier bridge from King Edward Street is the most direct.  Take Highway 5 to Maniwaki.  Go north about 15 minutes past the Casino exit.  Take Exit 28 and Wakefield Exit at the immediate roundabout.  The Main Street is just down the hill. Total trip time from Byward Market area is about 20 minutes.

By bus[edit]
Autobus Gatineau offers service from Ottawa and Gatineau, and from Gracefield and Maniwaki.

Fall leaves in the Gatineau Hills are incredible. Usually best in late September and early October, the whole region is a feast for your eyes.
During the spring months, and "break up time", locals place a barrel on the ice of the Gatineau River. Bets are placed as to when this barrel will sink. Nothing spectacular to see, but if you look for it, it will be there.
