Understand[edit]
History[edit]
The Indigenous prehistory of the area is estimated at 9,000 years, following the melting of the great glaciers of the last ice age. Nevertheless, this area was rather deserted, except for the Inuit who were there for hunting and fishing. Since the 16th century, European navigators of Basque and Breton origin came there to practice fishing. In 1534, the explorer Jacques Cartier made a refuelling stop there for his ship.
In 1804, a fish processing factory began its operations, under the aegis of the English merchants Lymburner and Crawford. A first post office was opened there in 1878. In 1880, the Catholic mission of Sacré-Coeur-de-Jésus was established.
The municipality of Bonne-Espérance was incorporated in 1990 by the amalgamation of three villages in the Côte-Nord administrative region: Vieux-Fort (Old-Fort-Bay), Rivière-Saint-Paul and Middle Bay.

By car[edit]
By road, Bonne-Espérance is accessible by:

Trans-Labrador Highway (routes 510 and 500) which crosses southern Labrador for 1141 km (via Forteau, Mary's Harbour, Port Hope Simpson, Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Churchill Falls and Wabush); then Eastern Quebec for 568 km (via Labrador City, Fermont, Mont-Wright, Gagnon, Manic 5) via Route 389 to reach the city of Baie-Comeau. By route 138, the distance between the limit of Labrador and the limit of route 138 in Vieux-Fort is 71 km. The total trip of 1670 km, between Bonne-Espérance and Baie-Comeau takes approximately 23 hours (non-stop);
Route 138: this road runs along the North Shore (in Quebec) towards the east from Baie-Comeau; for now, this road reaches the village of Kegaska; the journey between these two localities is 647 km (i.e. an estimated duration of 7 hr 18 min). Then, a 350- to 400-km stretch of road is missing (depending on the route that will be retained by the government) between Kegaska and the village of Old Port (in the municipality of Bonne-Espérance, Quebec). A ferry shuttles between the small villages of the Lower North Shore (in Quebec) and Blanc-Sablon. Then the 71-km section of Route 138 (Quebec) continues between the Old Port and the Labrador border. The Government of Quebec is gradually extending Route 138 eastward along the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Once Route 138 is completed, to Bonne-Espérance from Baie-Comeau will be a journey of approximately 1,000 km (approximately 11 hours non-stop), or approximately 700 km less (equivalent to a saving of 9 hours nonstop);
