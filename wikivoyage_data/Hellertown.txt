Hellertown is a borough in the Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania. Smaller than the region's main municipalities, Allentown, Bethlehem, and Easton, Hellertown is located south of South Bethlehem. The two municipalities are separated by South Mountain, making Hellertown the perfect place to stay for visitors who want to be slightly removed from the city atmosphere.
Hellertown lies in the center of the highly populated Northeast megalopolis region of the U.S., 13 miles (21 km) west of the Skylands and New Jersey state line, 57 miles (92 km) north of Philadelphia, and 82 miles (132 km) west of New York City.

The borough has many parks to enjoy, the main of which being Dimmick Park. The park entrance is located at Depot & Durham Streets in Hellertown, but the parking lot is just a few feet down Durham Street. This park houses a community pool (open June through September, $2-$5 daily admission), many baseball fields, a pavilion, stage, public restrooms and a playground. Hellertown's other notable park is the Water Street Park on West Water Street, between Front Street and Creek Road. It houses another pavilion, walking trails, a bike park, a playground, and a volleyball sand court area. Other, smaller parks in the borough include Third Avenue Park (basketball courts and playground) and the East High Street Playground.  The "Grist Mill", as it is locally known, also houses a number of baseball fields on West Walnut Street.
Skiing. This is a popular activity in nearby mountains. Most skiing areas are closed seasonally, since snow can usually only be manufactured from about November to April. Bear Creek Mountain Resort and Blue Mountain Ski Area are a short drive away in Macungie and Palmerton, respectively. Larger, world-famous ski resorts, including Jack Frost & Big Boulder, are in the Poconos, about an hour drive north on Route 33 to Interstate 80.
The summer provides a great opportunity to float down the Delaware river through Bucks County River Country.  In Jim Thorpe, River Adventures Inc. will take you white-water rafting down the Lehigh River.  There are numerous lakes, creeks, rivers, ponds, and canals for water sports.
