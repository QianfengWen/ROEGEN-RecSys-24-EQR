Taguig is a city, part of Metro Manila in the Philippines. Taguig contains the Bonifacio Global City (popularly known simply as BGC), Metro Manila's second most important business district and a major tourism, shopping, dining and entertainment destination. Other attractions include the Manila American Cemetery and the affluent neighbourhood of McKinley Hill.


Understand[edit]
Taguig's Fort Bonifacio Global City, is a planned neighborhood built on part of a former military base. It was built upon modern concepts of urbanism, including pedestrian-friendliness and mixed use buildings, which together with the cleanness, safety and unusually rigorous traffic enforcement, makes it sort of a "Singapore"-like city inside Manila. For some people, the area may look sterile, expensive, over-internationalized and lacking Filipino character, while for others, it might offer a welcome respite from the grittiness that characterizes most of Metro Manila outside the air conditioning of a shopping mall. It also symbolizes the craving for modernity and global thinking which perhaps is also part of Filipino culture.
Nonetheless, it is a misconception to think of BGC as a sort of expat or wealthy-only enclave; the area is bustling with locals from all over Metro Manila, working in the area's call centers during the day, and strolling around the Bonifacio High Street or shopping at the lively Market! Market! on evenings and weekends.
South of BGC, the affluent neighborhood of McKinley Hill attempts to replicate the charms of Italy with two large mixed used (residential and shopping) developments, the Tuscany Private Estate and Venice Grand Canal Mall/The Florence, which attract crowds of selfie-snapping Manileños, although as of early 2018 the actual shops are still slow to settle there.
In between the two neighborhoods lies the huge and serene Manila American Cemetery and Memorial, the largest American World War II cemetery in the world, which despite being one of Metro Manila's top attractions, it is still an oasis of peace in the bustling metropolis.
Outside of BGC and McKinley Hill, Taguig is mostly urban sprawl typical of Metro Manila; there is a lot of slums and tenements, interspersed with some residential subdivisions, high-rise condominiums and apartments,  industrial parks and shopping malls.

By taxi or e-hailing[edit]
If you are coming from Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport or from Makati taking a taxi or hailing a car or taxi to Taguig using the Grab app would be a convenient and relatively affordable option. If you want to hail a car but do not have a data plan, you can use the Grab kiosks in the airport and several shopping malls in Makati. Going to Taguig from Manila's city center will be more expensive (around ₱250-400), and you should be prepared to spend a long time in traffic.

By train/bus[edit]
The PNR Southrail passes through the West border of Taguig, which contains the Nichols and FTI stations. However, the BGC area is much closer to the Ayala and Guadalupe MRT-3 stations. If you want to cut through the traffic of Manila, an option is take the MRT-3 to Ayala or Guadalupe, and then take a taxi/Grab or public transportation to BGC. There are buses to the BGC bus terminal at Ayala Station, right across the Shell gas station near the East exit.
There are two routes, the West Route which has stops on the west part of Bonifacio Global City and the East Express which offers a one-way ride to the Market! Market! shopping mall on the eastern portion of the city.

Get around[edit]
If use public transportation try sakay.ph [formerly dead link] , it will show you the right type to your destination.

By bus[edit]
BGC has its own system of comfortable, air-conditioned buses, named BGC Bus. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, information on the bus route posted online are mostly outdated. Price is ₱13 for all routes regardless of destination; As of March 2022; there are three active routes West Route and East Express and Central Route. The buses only accept Beep smart cards as payment which could be reloaded at MRT stations and convenience stores.

On foot[edit]
With wide walkways, plenty of shelter and serious traffic enforcement, BGC is perhaps the best place in Metro Manila to explore by walking. The Bonifacio High Street pedestrian street leading to the Serendra, the Forbestown Road leading to the Burgos Circle, and the Uptown Parade are some places definitely to be explored on foot.

By taxi or e-hailing[edit]
BGC and McKinley Hill are quite compact areas and nearby each other, so taking a taxi or using Grab to hail a car or taxi in-between these areas shouldn't be expensive.

By jeepney or tricycle[edit]
While BGCs uses only regular buses for internal transportation, in the rest of Taguig you can find the usual choice of jeepneys and tricycles.

Bonifacio Global City[edit]
The BGC area, with its modern skyscrapers, exhibits of contemporary architecture, wide walkways, street art, and several mixed used developments containing cafes, restaurants and shops, can be considered as a sight by itself and possibly the most pedestrian-friendly area of Metro Manila. It is an area that deserves a few hours of exploration, both in the day and in the evening where some areas get more alive.
To have panoramic views of the area, go to one of BGC's several rooftop bars and sky lounges. BGC also contains the Metrobank Tower (part of Grand Hyatt Manila), which is 318 m (1,043 ft) high, the tallest building of the Philippines.

BGC and McKinley Hill are gastronomic paradises, with restaurants scattered in the mixed used developments including the Bonifacio High Street, Serendra, The Fort Strip, Forbes Town, Uptown Parade and Tuscany Estate, in the multiple shopping malls and some sitting by themselves in the streets.

Stay safe[edit]
BGC is certainly one of safest areas of Metro Manila, thanks to the ostensive presence of security and heavy-handed traffic enforcement. It is not unusual to see people jogging by themselves in the evening, which wouldn't be recommended in most parts of Manila. However, some care is required at traffic junctions, where discretionary turns are allowed and drivers performing a turn often refuse to yield to pedestrians, despite signs to do otherwise.
Beware of high-value party drugs and laced drinks in bars. The city's high nightlife has invited illegal drug dealers, so watch out for seedy locations where such drugs are sold. Also, don't just accept a drink from strangers or leave your drink alone.
Although BGC and McKinley Hill are quite close to each other, it is better not to walk between the areas as you pass through desolated roads with no people in the streets. Take a taxi or use Grab instead.
Outside BGC or McKinley Hill, Taguig is rather a mix of slums and residential communities. Drugs and violent crimes are common, so beware.
