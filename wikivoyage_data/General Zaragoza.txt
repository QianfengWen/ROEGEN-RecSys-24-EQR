Map of General Zaragoza
By bus[edit]
General Zaragoza is off the beaten path with no regular commercial bus service. The closest town with a bus station is Vallecillos, which is served by Transportes Frontera buses twice daily from Monterrey. The 4-hour trip will cost about M$200. Once you're in Vallecillos, it's 40 km to General Zaragoza on a poorly maintained rural road. The trip will take well over an hour and will likely cost M$500.

By car[edit]
Driving to General Zaragoza from Monterrey is a 320-km to 340-km trip (depending on the route you choose) and will take about 4 to 5 hours. From the southern part of Monterrey, you can drive south on the Carraterra Nacional (MEX-85) to MEX-58 west, then Nuevo Leon state highway 61 south. The other way is to drive to Saltillo, then south from there.
From Saltillo, drive south on federal highway MEX-57 (a modern highway in good condition, but with tolls). When the road ends at Nuevo Leon highway 61, turn north to General Zaragoza.
