Banff from Sulphur mountain
The town of Banff in Banff National Park, in the Canadian Rockies, is the larger of the two populated areas in Banff National Park, about an hour and a half drive west of Calgary and four hours south of Jasper. Banff is part of the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks UNESCO World Heritage Site. Like many mountain towns, Banff has a very different character in winter and summer. There is a decent selection of bars and restaurants but predictably a few too many souvenir shops and boutiques. European travellers will especially welcome the sidewalks that facilitate exploration of the town on foot.


Understand[edit]
Banff is a tourist town full of visitors and seasonal workers from across Canada and around the world. It is a convenient base for seeing some spectacular scenery with little effort. However, with convenience comes crowds. Banff Avenue can be very busy on summer afternoons and evenings, but it is a great place to stay for any length of time. There are a wide variety of restaurants and clubs and plenty of tours and activities to keep you busy. Staying in Banff during the winter gives easy access to the nearby ski areas of Norquay, Sunshine Village, and Lake Louise.
The area was named Banff in 1884 by George Stephen, president of the Canadian Pacific Railway, recalling his birthplace in Banff, Scotland.

Each Roam bus is decorated with images of different animals from the National Park and area. This one is Wolf.

Whimsy[edit]
For a spot of whimsy, you can check out 51.18188-115.5713912 Moose and Squirrel.  Rather, the intersection thereof, about 2 blocks east of the train station, diagonal from the school. Nothing more than the signpost, but good for a chuckle.

Spas[edit]
The Banff Upper Hot Springs
Banff National Park was established to protect and promote the natural hot springs at the Cave & Basin (now Cave & Basin National Historic Site). So there is a century-long tradition of visitors coming to take the waters in a spa-type setting. Today, visitors have many spas to choose from, but only the Upper Hot Springs Pool and Pleiades Spa allows visitors the opportunity to bathe in water from a hot spring.

51.15112-115.560977 Banff Upper Hot Springs and Pleiades Massage & Spa, Upper end of Mountain Avenue, ☏ +1 403-762-1515, toll-free: +1-800-767-1611, hot.springs@pc.gc.ca. 10AM-10PM varies seasonally.

Relax in soothing hot water where travellers have come to "take the waters" for more than a century. For an extra apres ski laugh, guests wishing to amuse can rent a hilarious 'traditional style' bathing costume. The outdoor hot pool is a great place to soak and watch falling snowflakes or the stars. Can be quite busy at times. In late spring, the hot springs flow sometimes drops significantly and must be supplemented with artificially-heated water. The Upper Hot Springs website's "Water" page states whether they are using all hot springs water or are supplementing. $7.30 per adult.

Winter[edit]
Skiing and snowboarding[edit]
Sunshine Village
Banff National Park is home to three ski areas[dead link], all within easy drive of the Banff townsite. Driving to the hill is not strictly required, as ski shuttles have stops convenient to most hotels. They will take you to the mountain of your choice and back again. Shuttle buses are included in the price of some ski passes, or you may have to pay a fare ($15).
Of the three Banff National Park ski areas, only Sunshine Village has ski-in ski-out accommodations. However, access to Sunshine is solely through their gondola. The gondola stops running Sa-Th at 4PM, and F at 10PM. Sunshine is a village in name only; there are very few activities there after the ski lifts shut down for the day. Most skiers stay in the town of Banff or the village of Lake Louise.
The ski season in Banff runs from early November to mid-April. The final day of skiing at Sunshine Village is always on Victoria Day, in late May.

51.203106-115.59829612 Norquay, End of Mount Norquay Scenic Drive, ☏ +1 403-762-4421. The closest mountain to the Banff townsite, and it is much used by the locals. It is unique in the area because you can pay for skiing by the hour, and night skiing is available on Fridays and Saturdays. There is a tube park for non-skiers (and non-boarders.) The ski season is a little shorter at Norquay, because it is at a lower altitude than Sunshine and Lake Louise, and snowfall is less consistent. The trails here lean more towards steep and difficult, although there is still plenty of easy terrain. Giv'er Grandi (formerly Excalibur, accessed via Mystic Express lift) is North America's steepest groomed piste. The lodge is not much good for breakfast; lunch and beer on the deck can't be beat however! $61 for full-day adult ticket. 
51.115416-115.76447513 Sunshine Village, End of Sunshine Road, ☏ +1 403-705-4000, toll-free: +1-877-542-2633. 20 minutes west of the Banff townsite. It also receives more snow than the other two resorts and benefits from a higher elevation and a generally longer ski season. All natural snow, no snow-making. Also fantastic scenery. It is the only resort of the three to have on-hill accommodation. Buffet breakfast served in the lodge at the bottom of the gondola - not much else until lunchtime once you get to the top. $85 full-day adult ticket. 
See also Lake Louise Ski Resort
All the ski hills are busier on the weekends. Lake Louise tends to get icy if it hasn't snowed in a while, but with fresh snow is hard to beat. Sunshine Village has been giving them some competition with their new terrain and improvements however. Especially in the early season, pay attention to how many runs are open and how much recent snow has been received in the snow reports - they are better indications of the conditions than the generic conditions ratings given by the hills (the conditions are always at least 'good' according to their ratings). If you only have a few hours and want to ski where the locals ski check out Ski Norquay, it has nice long open runs with great views of the town.

Lift passes[edit]
If you arrive before December 31 and you intend to ski at least 3 days at Sunshine Village, or a combination of three days at Sunshine and at Marmot Basin in Jasper, consider buying a Sunshine-Marmot card. The card costs about the same price as one lift ticket. The first, fourth and seventh times you use the card you get a free lift ticket, all other times you get $10 off (you are ahead quite a bit by the third day). These cards can be purchased on the hill (either Sunshine or Marmot Basin), or also at Safeway stores in Edmonton and Calgary, and are valid at Sunshine Village in Banff and Marmot Basin ski resort in Jasper. The Sunshine-Marmot cards are available for purchase until December 31 but can be used all season.
Louise Plus cards are very similar to Sunshine Marmot Cards. In addition to Lake Louise, they are also honored at four other ski areas: Castle (near Pincher Creek, Alberta); Revelstoke (Revelstoke, BC); Panorama (Panorama, BC), and Schweitzer (Sandpoint, Idaho, USA).
You can purchase a Tri-Area Pass for Sunshine Village, Lake Louise Mountain Resort and Norquay. This ticket includes the bus transportation and can be used at any of the three hills at any time.

Ski and snowboard rentals[edit]
Nearby Lake Louise is another popular ski resort
There are a number of great places in the Town of Banff that will rent high quality skis, snowboards, and boots. Some will also rent winter coats and pants. All Banff National Park ski areas require skiers & snowboarders under age 18 to wear helmets. Adults will find that not only do helmets protect your head when you fall, but they do a great job of keeping your head warm in cold and windy weather.

51.163536-115.56073214 Chateau Mountain Sports, 405 Spray Ave (Fairmont Banff Springs Convention Centre), ☏ +1 403-762-2500, info@chateaumountainsports.com. 8AM-8PM.

Other winter activities[edit]
Ice skating. There are outdoor skating rinks at the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel (fire, heated shelter) and at Banff Community High School (right next to Banff Avenue). A section of the Bow River is also cleared for skating. However, as always with bodies of natural ice, be careful. There is an indoor rink at Fenlands Banff Recreation Centre. Ice skates can be rented from some of the ski rental business.
 Snowshoeing. Strap on snowshoes and walk through pristine snow like the fur traders did in days gone by, a true winter experience. Guided snowshoe walks are available, or you can rent snowshoes from some ski rental shops. Snowshoeing is subject to the same avalanche risks as cross-country skiing; check the current avalanche risk for your planned route with Parks Canada or at the website of the Canadian Avalanche Centre. In March 2014, four snowshoers were killed when they went into avalanche terrain near Lake Louise without proper training or equipment.

Summer[edit]
Summer in Banff, just like winter, is stunning. There are plenty of hiking trails accessible from the main town, as well as tours for horseback riding, white water rafting, mountain biking and more. Be warned though - some smaller tour companies are not as professional as the larger tour companies. If they are overbooked, they may pass your credit card details along to a third party without your knowledge and book another tour on your behalf (not always at the same price, and not always the same tour!)

Hiking and wildlife viewing[edit]
Bighorn sheep
Banff has the most beautiful trails surrounding it. You can pick up a free trail map at the Visitor Centre, or find many trail maps online, as downloadable pdf files. Please check the trail reports online or with the Parks Canada desk before you go, as high-elevation snow, bear activity, or other factors may close trails or create hazards. Another option is to go with a hiking guide and group, different locations are available.
While in the area, always keep your eyes peeled as there are so many animals to spot in the summer in Banff. It is important to keep your distance, though, as wildlife is wild and they should be kept that way, they can be dangerous too! In the spring, female elk are very protective of their calves, who may lie hidden out of sight; in fall, bull elk are extremely aggressive during the rut. For this reason, you will need a telephoto lens to get good photos of wildlife while staying safe.
How can you tell that you are getting too close to wildlife? If the animal stares at you, moves away from you (even just a few steps), or behaves aggressively toward you, then you should back away until that behavior stops. Also, it is illegal to feed wildlife in a national park.
Visitors often confuse bighorn sheep with mountain goats. Goats are white with black noses and short black horns, and are usually seen high up on rocky ledges. Bighorn sheep are brown, with white rump patches and brown horns. They are usually seen by roadsides and grazing on grasses close to rocky outcrops. You'll never forget the difference after you watch this Parks Canada music video, "GOat Sheep GOat".

The Bow River trail
51.1442-115.574525 Sulphur Mountain Trail. Rather than taking the gondola up Sulphur Mountain, you can hike the trail up to the top of the ridge and catch the gondola down. (It's half price to just take the gondola down, but it's free before 10AM and after 7PM.) The trail is steep but manageable for those with a reasonable level of fitness. Note that there is a little-used road that goes down the side of Sulphur Mountain that is away from the town, which has been mistaken for the hiking trail; the road is much longer than the hiking trail. If you opt to hike down after taking the gondola up, you should be able to see the gondola towers and cables on your way down, as the hiking trail zigzags below the gondola lift. 
51.1754-115.561826 Tunnel Mountain Trail. A hike of 4.3 km, ranked as "easy". It starts from downtown Banff and takes you up the Tunnel Mountain, from where you have a nice view over the surroundings. You won't find any tunnel along the trail; when the Canadian Pacific railway was constructed in the late 19th century a plan was to build a tunnel through this mountain but it never happened. 
51.1813-115.579827 Fenland Trail. A very good spot for birdwatching all year, and you may also see beaver or muskrat in 40 Mile Creek. May be closed in spring due to calving elk. (Cow elk are very protective of calves.) 
51.1709-115.588128 Marsh Loop. An easy walk of 2.4 km through the marshlands near Banff. This is a good place for birdwatching and there are good views of Mount Norquay. 
51.1704-115.563229 Bow River Trail. The Bow River Trail is a riverside trail of 0.9 or 1.4 km, which are paved and according to the home page of the Town of Banff even wheelchair accessible. 
Hoodoos in the winter
51.168-115.557230 Hoodoo Trail. A popular walk to the hoodoos (a kind of rock formations) east of Banff. 
51.1144-115.76731 Sunshine Meadows. An alpine park with trails with varying difficulty levels. There are guided walks too, and the area offers good views of the highest mountains in the Banff National Park. Shuttle bus access from Banff. 
51.2472-115.499132 Lake Minnewanka Loop. Great spot to see bighorn sheep next to the road, especially when you get to Lake Minnewanka and the area around Johnson Lake and Two Jack Lake. 
51.171-115.66133 Bow Valley Parkway. A scenic route from Banff to Lake Louise, running parallel to Highway 1. You have a good chance at seeing different mammals like bighorn sheep, wolves, elk, deer and grizzly bears. There are seasonal travel restrictions. (updated Mar 2023)
51.1671-115.549334 Banff Springs Golf Course. Great place to find elk all year round. They love grazing on the lush grass. 
51.19-115.583735 Mount Norquay Road. Look for bighorn sheep here, and if you are lucky, you may also spot a mountain goat along the cliffs.

Buy[edit]
Enjoy strolling alongside locals and world-travellers as you discover a cosmopolitan collection of galleries, boutiques and cafés. Shops range from internationally recognized clothiers or independently-owned establishments to Canada's oldest department store.  A recommended way to experience the highlights is to start on Banff Avenue at the Cascade Plaza mall, do a quick circuit of the shops there, then head down Banff Avenue towards the Bow River.  This is the retail, cafe, and restaurant heart of Banff.  Once you get near the river, turn around and head back on the other side of Banff Avenue to complete the Banff shopping loop.

Eat[edit]
Banff Avenue
Banff is an exciting place to visit on all fronts, and the palate is not excluded. There are pubs, fast-food, fine dining, steakhouses (this is Alberta, after all!), traditional fare from around the world, and candy shops.
Banff can be an expensive place to dine as it is a tourist destination.
Alcoholic beverages: Visitors to Banff can sometimes be perplexed by Alberta's liquor laws. The legal drinking age in Alberta is 18. A restaurant that does not serve alcohol can admit diners of all ages. However, some restaurants that serve alcohol may be required to bar anyone under 18 from entering — even if they are just going to use the toilet. A second type of liquor licence allows both adults and minors to enter. To further confuse things, the same restaurant may be allowed to accept diners of all ages at certain times, but be open only to ages 18+ at other times of the day (usually evenings). All establishments that serve alcoholic beverages are legally required to have a food menu as well.
In a hotel, guests cannot take their unfinished alcoholic drinks from the hotel restaurant to their hotel room.
These are not rules imposed by management; they are legal requirements, and the business could forfeit their liquor licence if they are caught breaking them. Similarly, younger drinkers may have to show proof of age before they are served. Again, the business could lose their liquor licence if they are found serving under-aged patrons, so they need to be very careful.

This uniquely shaped restaurant downtown has telephones at every table with placemats that serve as a map so you can call tables to chat through your dinner. It is a laid-back, fun atmosphere and the food does not disappoint. A typical meal may consist of a Caesar salad to start, then a cheese fondue served with freshly steamed veggies and mouth-watering bread for dipping. The second course is where things get exciting; opt for the hot-rock style of fondue. Rocks are brought to the table and heated to 300 °F (149 °C). Each rock gets its own pot of garlic butter smeared on, first by your server and then by you; each person receives a customized plate of raw fish, chicken, bison, frog legs, AAA-beef, shark, snake, whatever you wish, or dare, to try. Accompanying the exotic mix of possibilities are dipping sauces like chipotle and teriyaki.

Sleep[edit]
Being a national park, Banff has plenty of accommodation. However, book early, because places fill up quickly in winter and summer. To live in Banff, as opposed to being a perpetual tourist, residents must have a business in town. If you have access to a car, another often cheaper alternative is to stay in Canmore and drive to the ski resorts or into Banff.
Most hotels are along Banff Avenue or on Tunnel Mountain Road.

Stay safe[edit]
You may encounter bears, although the risk is much smaller than it used to be
Banff has a lot of wildlife roaming in and around the town. Be careful of elk and deer when driving in the town. The most dangerous wildlife in Banff National Park are not bears or cougars, but elk. In spring, female (cow) elk are very protective of their offspring and will charge anyone who they consider a threat. In the fall, male (bull) elk are rutting and very aggressive. Cow elk weigh roughly 230 kg (507 lb), while bull elk weigh about 320 kg (705 lbs). Both sexes are capable of seriously injuring a person, and rutting males have also damaged cars.
Thirty years ago, bears used to be quite common within the town but conservation efforts have largely fixed this problem. Garbage and litter within the town must be discarded into bear-proof containers. In Banff National Park it is illegal to feed any wildlife, and both stupid and illegal to feed bears. "A fed bear is a dead bear": bears who learn to associate humans with food engage in behaviours that are threatening to humans and ultimately fatal to the bear.
Avalanches are a risk in winter. This risk is not limited to people engaging in activities like cross-country (Nordic) skiing, skiing off piste, ice climbing, or snowmobiling. The winter of 2013-2014 was particularly tragic in Banff National Park because four people were killed by an avalanche when snowshoeing and two people were killed by an avalanche when sledding. None of them had any avalanche gear with them.
Learn to identify avalanche hazards.  An avalanche slope has enough of a slope to it that you can ski or sled down, but is not so steep that it won't hold snow. If you're not familiar with how to spot avalanche risks and you want to engage in outdoor activities like snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, or even sledding, check with Parks Canada staff or the Canadian Avalanche Centre for more information.
Be alert to your surroundings. Not all cliffs or other unsafe areas are marked with signs or blocked off by railings.  Some travellers disregard railings and warning signs of unsafe terrain, when they exist, because they are keen on getting a closer look or taking photographs. Even if the risk is not obvious to you, it's best to assume that someone put up the barriers and safety messages for a good reason.
