Downtown Zhongshan at night
Zhongshan (中山; Jūngsāan in Cantonese, Zhōng​shān in Mandarin​) is a city in Guangdong Province just north of Zhuhai. Zhongshan is most famous as the birthplace of Chinese national hero Sun Yat-Sen (for whom the city was renamed after his death). It's now something of a manufacturing center, like the rest of the Pearl River Delta, but it's quieter than the other cities in the area and still has lots of farmland and small towns.


Understand[edit]
Zhongshan is in the Pearl River Delta region of Guangdong Province, on the west bank of the Pearl River estuary. It is connected by road and rail to Guangzhou (capital of Guangdong Province) to the north and Zhuhai to the south. Hong Kong can be reached by ferry and Macao via Zhuhai.
Zhongshan covers an area of 1,800 km² and has a permanent population of some 4.4 million in 2020. The city is in a subtropical humid zone with an annual average temperature around 23 °C.
Zhongshan has nurtured numerous prominent historical figures throughout its history. On November 12, 1866, Dr. Sun Yat-Sen (also Sun Zhongshan) the great leader of China's republican revolution, was born at Cuiheng village of Zhongshan. In memory of him, the county of Xiangshan, which was set up in 1152, was renamed after Dr. Sun as Zhongshan in 1925. It's one of very few cities in China named after a person.
Zhongshan was also the location of a strong guerrilla force during World War II, and the villages that hid the guerrillas are a short drive away through wooded lanes.
Zhongshan has a vibrant downtown river area, some beautiful Buddhist temples. It is an affordable place to live and work with housing being about one third that of its bigger sister cities nearby.

Talk[edit]
Zhongshan is a linguistically diverse city, with Cantonese being the lingua franca, and several other closely-related dialects being spoken by residents in different districts. The main dialect in Shiqi District, the historical downtown area, is the Shiqi Dialect, which is similar to Cantonese but differs significantly in pronunciation and tone structure, making it tricky to understand even if you are fluent in standard Cantonese. Several languages from the Min (Fujian) family of Chinese languages are the main languages in some parts of the city, while Hakka is the main language in some other parts of the city, though speakers of these languages are usually able to speak Cantonese as well. As Mandarin is the official language of China, most locals are also able to speak Mandarin, and Zhongshan is also home to many migrants from other parts of China who speak Mandarin but not the local languages. As with elsewhere in China, English is not widely spoken, though some younger people may know some basic English.

天下為公
When you visit the Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Museum, you'll see the big characters 天下為公 (simplified: 天下为公, tiān xià wéi gōng) on the wall outside. This is a quote from Confucius, recorded in the Book of Rites and famously repeated by Sun Yat-Sen. It can be translated as "All under heaven belongs to the people" or "The whole world as one community". It's worth holding this idea in the back of your mind as you walk through the museum learning about Sun's life and what he believed in.

Stay safe[edit]
Zhongshan is a reasonably safe place with a low crime rate, but occasionally trouble may occur, especially, as everywhere, late at night around bars. Caution and common sense are advised at all times. Pickpockets, although not plentiful, are about and the foreign traveler is often a target.
