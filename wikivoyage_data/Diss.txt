Diss is a town in Norfolk, close to the border with Suffolk.


Understand[edit]
The town's name is thought to have come from the Saxon word Dice or Disce meaning a pool of standing water or lake and referring to 52.37541.10751 Diss' Mere.  This 6-acre (2.4-ha) lake is directly adjacent to the main shopping street (Market Pl/Mere St). It is 5½ m deep with a further 16 m of mud at the bottom. Most think it is the result of past glacial action, though some have suggested other theories about its formation.

Diss is 2 miles W from the A140 (Norwich to A14 main road) from which it is well signposted using the A1066 road. The town is well served with cheap and (some) free parking for cars. The town routes into town are relatively cycle-friendly. The town lies on the Regional Cycle Route 30 (Lowestoft to Thetford). Diss is also on the main London Liverpool St – Norwich rail line and hence has frequent trains.

Cycling[edit]
The surrounding countryside has many small rural quiet roads without many hills ideally suited to cycling. The network of small lanes will need a map (or GPS or smartphone with mapping) for those not familiar with the area. Most cyclists avoid the busy A1066 running through the town and tend to use the narrower rural lanes. Running past the southern edge of the town is the 52.37141.09976 Regional Cycle Route 30 (Lowestoft to Thetford) which forms part of the UK National Cycle Network.
