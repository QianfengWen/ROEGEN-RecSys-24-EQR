Zheleznogorsk (Russian: Железного́рск zhyh-leez-nah-GOHRSK) (previously known as Krasnoyarsk-26) is a city of 84,000 (2018) 60 km northeast of Krasnoyarsk. During the Soviet era, it was a major plutonium-producing city, and remains a "closed city", requiring an invitation from an authorized agency in the city, with a government-approved reason for visiting.

The city formerly known as Krasnoyarsk-26

Understand[edit]
This "secret city" of about 94,000 residents did not appear on maps of the Soviet Union.  Situated on the east bank of the Yenisei River, it was constructed after World War II specifically for processing weapons-grade plutonium, and was known during this time as "Krasnoyarsk-26": essentially a post office box address indicating only a location near the city of Krasnoyarsk.  In 1992 Russia's President Yeltsin permitted the secret cities to reveal themselves and use traditional names; Krasnoyarsk-26 came out as the "closed city" of Zheleznogorsk.
Although the nuclear industry is gradually being down-sized due to safety and non-proliferation pressures, in 1996 the residents voted to remain a closed city in an attempt to maintain their town's charming, village-like quality amidst harsher, more environmentally damaged cities. Built on a picturesque artificial lake, the town is said to resemble St. Petersburg. The city is clean and the transportation system efficient, a legacy from the time when Zheleznogorsk was part of the privileged, secret nuclear weapons complex.

Get in[edit]
Although you can now find it on maps of Krasnoyarsk Krai, you cannot just drive there without authorization.  Visitors are only permitted by screened invitation.  Before you will be permitted to visit, your hosts must submit a request to the Ministry of Atomic Energy and to Russian national security agencies for authorization, which can take up to two months.  If approved, you'll receive a letter of invitation, which will be required for your visa application, which can take anywhere from a week to a month.
