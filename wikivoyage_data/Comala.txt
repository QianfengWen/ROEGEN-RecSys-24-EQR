Drink[edit]
In the days of the Spanish empire, the trade routes between Mexico and the Philippines were busy and lucrative. During that time, Filipinos brought over an alcoholic drink called tuba that's made by fermenting palm tree sap. You can still find it in parts of Colima, and Comala is one of the towns where locals still drink it.
Comala is also home to a relatively low-alcohol punch called ponche de Comala. More than a dozen local families produce it in a wide range of flavors including pomegranate, coconut, coffee, tamarind, and plum.
