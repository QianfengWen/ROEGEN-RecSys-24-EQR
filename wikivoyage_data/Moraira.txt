Castell de Moraira
Moraira is an upscale seaside resort on the Costa Blanca, Alicante (province).
The town is very popular with foreign visitors and retirees, and its population balloons in the summer. However, unlike other Costa Blanca settlements – most notably Benidorm – the community has not been marred by high rises and overdevelopment, and steps have been taken to protect the area's native pine groves.


Understand[edit]
Moraira began as a quiet fishing village, and together with nearby Teulada it is often referred to as Teulada-Moraira.
