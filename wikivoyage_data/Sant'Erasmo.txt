Understand[edit]
History[edit]
The first record of the island appears in the first half of the tenth century in the administrative records of Constantine VII of the Byzantine Empire. The island was a port in the Duchy of Venice attached to Murano. At the end of the 16th century it was described as an island full of vegetable gardens and vineyards that supplied to the city vegetables and fruits "in abundance and perfect". It is now known for market gardening. A typical product is castraure, artichokes picked early. 
Ruined fortifications, including the so-called Torre Massimiliana (Tower of Maximilian), ring the isle. Forts existed in the island as early as the 16th century. After the fall of the Republic of Venice, the French built here a stronghold in 1811-1814. After Napoleon's defeat, the Austrian Archduke Maximilian of Austria-Este had a tower built here in 1843-1844, and also found here refuge during a revolt. The tower has a polygonal base of 25 m and is surrounded by a ditch. On the upper floor up to 13 cannons could be housed. It was used by the Italian Army as late as World War I.

The Massimiliana tower
45.4450712.393151 Massimiliana tower. The Massimiliana tower is a circular plan structure built between 1843 and 1844 on the extreme southern tip of the island of Sant'Erasmo, above the foundations of an earlier French fort. Surrounded by a moat and an irregular polygonal bank, it was placed in defense of the port mouth of Lido. It was built on the order the Archduke Maximilian of Austria. It is the only example of this type of tower still existing in Italy. It was used during the Second World War as an anti-aircraft battery, and occupied by German troops in 1943. In April 1945 the retreating Germans seriously damaged it in an attempt to blow it up. It was used in the post-war period as a precarious housing by the displaced, and later used as an agricultural warehouse. In the late 1990s, it fell into a state of total abandonment. It was restored in 2004, and hosts art and photography exhibitions and cultural events.  (updated Jun 2018)
Church of Cristo Re
