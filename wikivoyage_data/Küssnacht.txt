Küssnacht is a small town in the heart of Switzerland.


Understand[edit]
Küssnacht is the last town in canton Schwyz before the border of Lucerne. On the shores of Lake Lucerne and also at the foot of Mount Rigi, it makes a good starting point for hikes up the "queen of the mountains". It is most famous for the yearly Klausjagen, an ancient tradition that attracts around 20,000 visitors each year. The most notable thing about Küssnacht (and indeed the thing many educated German speakers will remember) is the role the "Hohle Gasse" plays in the legend of Wilhelm Tell and the Schiller play, with the line "Durch diese hohle Gasse muss er kommen" - He must come through this hohle Gasse still familiar to many Germans Austrians and Swiss

Get in[edit]
There are trains every half hour that connect Küssnacht with Lucerne, Goldau and St. Gallen.
From Lucerne you have connections to almost every major city in Switzerland. Goldau offers trains to Ticino, the Italian part of Switzerland and also has an hourly direct train to Milan

Get around[edit]
Map of Küssnacht

There are a couple bus lines in town but as the centre is pretty small you probably won't need them to get around. If you're arriving by train take Bus 2 or 22 to "Hauptplatz" as it is the town centre (takes less than 5 minutes).

According to the legend of Wilhelm Tell, the national hero shot the Austrian bailiff Gessler at the Hohle Gasse with his crossbow.
