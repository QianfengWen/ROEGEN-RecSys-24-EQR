Brunswick is a very small town in Frederick County, Maryland, on the Potomac River.


History[edit]
It is located about 124 km south of Savannah. In 1771, the town was deliberately established, and the Georgia Royal Colony Board named it after the house of the Hanover family, a prestigious British family in Germany. Migration began in 1772, and it became a city in 1856.
Today, as a fishing port centered on the seafood industry, food processing of catches is successful, and the pulp and wood industries have developed. The tourism industry near the Naval Exclusive Store and Golden Isles is also popular. There are three islands nearby: St. Simons, Sea, and Jekyll, and there are the state's oldest public schools, Glynn Academy (1778) and Brunswick Elementary University (1961).
