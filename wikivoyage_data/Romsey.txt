Romsey is a picturesque market town of about 15,000 people (2011) in the Test Valley district of Hampshire, England.  It sits on the outskirts of the New Forest, just over 3 miles (4.8 km) northeast of its eastern edge. It lies on the River Test, which is known for fly fishing, predominantly trout.


Understand[edit]
Corn Exchange
Romsey was described by The Guardian newspaper as 'resoundingly, timelessly English' in 2014, remarking on the town's representation of bourgeois provincial life. It is popular among retirees.
Romsey Abbey, the largest parish church in Hampshire, dominates the centre of the town. Other notable buildings include a 13th-century hunting lodge, an 18th-century coaching inn and the 19th-century corn exchange.
Romsey was home to the 17th-century philosopher and economist William Petty and the 19th-century British prime minister, Lord Palmerston, whose statue has stood in the town centre since 1857. The town was also home to the 20th-century naval officer and statesman Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, who lived at Broadlands.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Romsey has very good road links to other parts of the country. The M3 motorway from London and the A34 dual carriageway from the Midlands and the North converge at Winchester. Take the A3090 from Winchester (M3 junction 11) to Romsey. The M27 runs westwards towards the New Forest and Bournemouth, and eastwards towards Portsmouth and Brighton. Junctions 2 and 3 of the M27 are close to Romsey. The A3057 runs north from Romsey to Andover and south to Southampton. The A27 runs north west towards Salisbury. From Bristol and South Wales it is usually quicker to travel via the M4 and A34 than the shorter but much slower A36. Likewise from the South West of England, the route via the A303, B3089, Salisbury and the A27 is often quicker than the A35 and A31.
Parking in Romsey can be difficult on Saturdays, but not any more so than at other market towns. Parking is free after 4PM each day.

By train[edit]
50.9927-1.49331 Romsey railway station (a 5 minute level walk from the town centre). On the route from Portsmouth to Cardiff via Southampton, Salisbury, Bath and Bristol, and direct trains run by First Great Western link Romsey to these places (and some other smaller places along the route) hourly, seven days a week. Occasional through trains also operate, several times daily, to Gloucester, Worcester and Great Malvern, and also along the coast to Chichester and Brighton.   (updated Mar 2022)
Local stopping services operated by South West Trains also serve Romsey frequently throughout the day and evening, providing additional journeys to Southampton and Salisbury and also link Romsey to Chandlers Ford, Eastleigh, Southampton Airport, various suburban stations in Southampton, and the nearby villages of Mottisfont & Dunbridge and Dean.
Trains from London, the Midlands and the North do not operate directly to Romsey. Change trains at Southampton Central or Southampton Airport Parkway stations, or take the bus to Romsey from Winchester station.
From the South West of England, change trains at Westbury or Salisbury.
From Bournemouth change at Southampton Central.
A useful tip when travelling from Southampton Central to Romsey is to take a train whose final destination is shown as Salisbury, Bristol or Cardiff. These reach Romsey much more quickly than those whose final destination is shown as Romsey, but which travel by a more circuitous route.

By bus[edit]
Buses from Winchester (operated by Stagecoach South), Eastleigh (by Wilts & Dorset) and Southampton (by Bluestar) run frequently and stop centrally in the town. Buses from Salisbury run less frequently. Limited services are also available from some nearby villages.
From Eastleigh, Southampton, and Salisbury the train is generally faster, cheaper and more frequent than the equivalent bus routes.

By plane[edit]
The nearest airport is Southampton Airport (SOU IATA), about 10 miles (16 km) away in Eastleigh, with flights to domestic and European destinations. Southampton Airport Parkway railway station is next to the airport terminal - trains run directly to Romsey twice an hour.
From Heathrow (LHR IATA) take the railair coach service to Woking station, then take a train to Winchester, Southampton Airport or Southampton Central for connections to Romsey.
From Gatwick (LGW IATA) take a direct train to Southampton Central, and change there for a train to Romsey.

Get around[edit]

The small and pleasant town centre is easily covered on foot.
Walking around will occupy a pleasant, easygoing half day. A few villages on the outskirts offer (mostly) real old fashioned English pub atmospheres, where a morning walk and a pub lunch plus pints make for a very agreeable start to a weekend. Ampfield and Braishfield are two such villages accessible by local bus (leaving from the bus station to the rear of the high street, adjacent to Bradbeer's) and there is a village to the Northwest that's on the train route direct. Stopping at Mottisfont and Dunbridge there is a pub by the name of the Mill Arms quite literally opposite the platform, which is full of atmosphere, and where on Christmas Day you can turn up and get your first pint of the day for free!
See[edit]
50.9897-1.50141 Romsey Abbey.   
50.9898-1.49962 King John's House & Tudor Cottage. 
50.9806-1.49693 Broadlands. The estate of Lord Mountbatten is open to the public at different times throughout the week/year and more interestingly hosts concerts from, usually, popular music stars, like Earth, Wind & Fire, Phil Collins, Madness etc. When sunny, the estate is fantastic. It has a vast series of almost open fields, with stands of ancient trees and red deer roaming more or less freely. As a venue for an open-air concert it is about as good as they come.   
Walking tour of poetic quips and quotes. Plenty of towns in England have these nowadays, the Romsey version takes you on a particularly scenic meander along the banks of the Test a short way and through the town's modestly interesting historic streets, Bell street and parts of the High street especially still look and feel suitably ancient. Streets around the back of the Abbey are also on the route and they, with the abbey, lend a genuinely impressive air.
