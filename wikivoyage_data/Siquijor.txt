The Spanish named it Isla del Fuego due to the intensity of its fire flies. Legend has it that Siquijor rose from the sea during a tremendous thunder storm and one can still see fossils and shells on Mount Bandila-an, Siquijor's highest point.

Get around[edit]
9°11′28″N 123°35′46″EMap of Siquijor
There is a paved road running around the coast of the island.

Hire a motorbike for ₱250-350 per day (2016). Available at the port in Siquijor town, San Juan town and almost all resorts. However, resorts generally charge higher prices and very often require customers to return bikes before 6PM in order to force guests to have dinner at resort's own restaurant.
Hire a tricycle. For instance, price from Siquijor town to San Juan town is ₱150-250, while a day tour of the island is ₱1000 (2016). If you arrive by boat in Siquijor Town, then on your left as you walk off the pier toward where the tricycles congregate there is a large sign showing prices for various journeys. Drivers may ask for more, but the sign gives you a fine tool for bargaining and a lower limit below which you know the drivers will not go.
Jump on a jeepney; prices are very low, Siquijor town to San Juan - ₱20 (2016). Although they run fairly rarely, mainly departing when full.
San Juan is the main tourist area, though there are lots of other options. Within San Juan you can walk to some places, but the town is spread out along several km of seaside so for many trips you will need a trike or jeepney.

Most hotels and restaurants have WiFi with generally very slow internet. Cliff Side resort near Larena has high-speed 10mbps internet (March 2017).
Mobile coverage is limited to larger towns and villages where a full 3G signal can be acquired. And it's patchy or nonexistent in remote/sparsely populated areas (2016).

Cope[edit]
Many hotels prohibit guests from bringing in outside food, this way trying to increase their own restaurants' income.

Generika Drug Store. National Highway Corner Caridad Street Siquijor town. lower prices.
