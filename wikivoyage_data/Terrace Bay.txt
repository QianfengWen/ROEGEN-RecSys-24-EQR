Terrace Bay, the "Gem of the Northshore", is a township in Northern Ontario with 1,500 residents (2021) that is 150 km² in size.
The Terrace Bay region is known for its incredible beauty, and is on the shores of the magnificent Lake Superior, the largest fresh water lake in the world.


Understand[edit]

Terrace Bay was named after the sand and gravel terraces which were left behind when ice glaciers receded about 20,000 years ago. The area is surrounded by the rugged Northern Ontario wilderness and the forest is the reason for Terrace Bay's existence. Terrace Bay originated as an undeveloped area catering to the needs of the forestry industry. The decision to develop the town was first conceived in the early 1940s by the Longlac Pulp and Paper Company which was taken in conjunction with the Ontario Hydro water division, completed in 1939, to redirect the northward flowing Long Lake south through the Aguasabon River system to Lake Superior.
