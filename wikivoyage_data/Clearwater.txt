Clearwater is  a city in Pinellas County, a region in Florida.
Perhaps most easily recognized as the headquarters city of the Church of Scientology, Clearwater also has miles of beautiful beaches and close proximity to other cities in the Tampa Bay area.


Understand[edit]
Clearwater used to be the home of the Tocobaga American Indian people. Around 1835, the United States Army began construction of Fort Harrison as an outpost during the Seminole Wars. The fort was located on a bluff overlooking Clearwater Harbor, which later became part of an early 20th-century residential development called Harbor Oaks. The name "Clear Water" is thought to have come from a fresh water spring flowing from near where the City Hall building is located today. There were many other freshwater springs that dotted the bluff, many in the bay or harbor.
During the American Civil War, Union gunboats repeatedly raided the community's supplies, as most of the able-bodied men were away fighting for the Confederate Army. The town began developing in the late nineteenth century, prompted by the completion of the first passenger railroad line into the city in 1888. The area's popularity as a vacation destination grew after railroad magnate Henry B. Plant built a sprawling Victorian resort hotel named Belleview Biltmore just south of Clearwater in 1897.
During World War II, Clearwater became a major training base for US troops destined for Europe and the Pacific. Virtually every hotel in the area, including the Belleview Biltmore and the Fort Harrison Hotel, was used as a barracks for new recruits. The remote and isolated Dan's Island, now the highrise-dominated Sand Key, was used as a target by U.S. Army Air Corps fighter-bombers for strafing and bombing practice.
In 1975, the Church of Scientology, which describes itself as a religious organization, established its world headquarters in Clearwater. As of 2017, it has bought at least 22 buildings in the downtown area for offices, temporary housing, teaching facilities, and a library. It has  2,500 employees, and claims to have 10,000 members living permanently in the area. The organization plans to buy most of the remainder of the inner city to establish a retail district managed by the organization.
Clearwater Beach, located on a separate barrier island, is part of the city of Clearwater and fronts the Gulf of Mexico. The connecting road is part of State Road 60 and is called Clearwater Memorial Causeway.
