Shelburne is a town in South Shore region of Nova Scotia.


Understand[edit]
The Cox Warehouse on Dock Street
Many of Shelburne's buildings were built by Loyalists - Americans who were loyal to the British Crown who fled the American colonies after the British lost the American War of Independence. In 1783, waves of Loyalist settlers landed in Shelburne's harbour, expanding the village's population to 17,000, making it the fourth largest city in North America. Many of these settlers were Black Loyalists, slaves who had been promised their freedom and land for aiding the British cause. 
In 1787, government distribution of provisions to the new settlers was terminated. As the settlement was not yet self-supporting, many settlers put their houses up for sale or abandoned them. They left for England, New Brunswick, Upper Canada, and the United States. About half the population of African Americans left, many going to the new colony of Freetown in West Africa (now Sierra Leone). By the 1820s, the population of Shelburne had dwindled to about 300.
Fishing remains a primary industry. Other economic activities include tourism, ship building and repair, aquaculture, logging, fish processing, and the manufacture of barrels, institutional furniture, granite monuments, and marine supplies.
Shelburne has been used as a film set for numerous films, and for the 2014 TV series The Book of Negroes, in which Shelburne portrayed itself.
