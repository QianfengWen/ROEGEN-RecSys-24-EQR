Bridgend  (Welsh: Penybont ar Ogwr) is a town in Glamorgan, South Wales. It is the principal town of the County Borough of Bridgend and has a population of around 40,000 people.
Bridgend has developed from a small, vibrant market town to a major regional industrial and service centre. Bridgend's position roughly equidistant between Cardiff and Swansea has made it a popular dormitory settlement for commuters to both cities.
Bridgend was perhaps most famously home to a Ford Motor Company engine plant (now closed), that was one of the area's biggest employers, but it also used to have a significant presence by Japanese electronics giant Sony.


Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Cardiff Airport (CWL IATA) is some 15 miles (25 km) to the south east of the town. An hourly train service runs from nearby Rhoose to Bridgend and is served by a shuttle bus from the airport terminal. Buses also run to Cardiff where you can make a simple connection to Bridgend either by train or by bus.
Bristol Airport (BRS IATA) which serves a greater number of destinations than Cardiff Airport is a further 30–40 miles east.
You are most likely to fly into the United Kingdom at either Heathrow Airport (LHR IATA) or Gatwick Airport (LGW IATA), both near London. In this case it is probably best to make a public transport connection to Wales at one of the major terminuses in London.

By train[edit]
There is one major train station in the town. 51.506944-3.5751 Bridgend railway station is within a 3-minute walk of the town centre. A taxi rank and a bus stop are outside. The station is fully staffed and has ticket sale facilities, refreshments and toilets. Entry is controlled by ticket barriers so you will require a ticket to enter/exit the platforms.
The footbridge at Bridgend railway station is a listed building and hasn't been upgraded to the statutory requirements for travellers with  disabilities. To access platform 2 for Cardiff and London bound trains, use the other footbridge on platform 1 which has lifts on either end
Bridgend is a scheduled stop on the GWR service from London Paddington to Swansea. This is an hourly service.
All other services are run by TFW . These services connect Bridgend to Cardiff, Barry,  Swansea, Carmarthenshire, Pembrokeshire, Manchester, Birmingham and Western England. There is also an hourly service to the nearby town of Maesteg.
The other station in the town is Wildmill, an unstaffed station serving the districts in the north of the town. It is a scheduled stop on the hourly service between Maesteg and Cheltenham.

By car[edit]
Bridgend is best accessed by car from Junctions 35 and 36 of the M4 motorway running from London to Carmarthenshire.
There are numerous pay-and-display car parks in the town centre and free ample parking at the McArthur Glen Designer Outlet about 2 miles from the town centre at Junction 36 of the M4.

By bus[edit]
Bridgend has a 11-bay Bus Station located in the centre of town. Buses are primarily run by First Group but there are also services by Stagecoach and Veolia. These services mainly serve the towns and villages around Bridgend.
Some services of note however are:

Stay safe[edit]
Bridgend is a relatively safe town by Welsh and UK standards. Care should be taken when in the town centre at night as alcohol related violence is a fairly common sight. Pickpockets have been known to target shoppers, especially the elderly in Bridgend town centre.

Respect[edit]
Bridgend has come under the spotlight of the media due to drama film about a cluster of suicides among young adults in the area between 1996 and 2010. The vast bulk of suicides took place not in the town, but in the county which also shares the name Bridgend and has a population of over 130,000. Although the number of suicides was high, and unusual, the figures didn't vary wildly from the average for an area this size. Many in the town felt that Bridgend had been misrepresented and that media outlets were exacerbating the situation.  It would be rude to bring up the suicides in casual conversation as an outsider.
