Grimshaw a town of about 2,700 people (2016) in the Peace River Country region of Alberta, best known for being mile zero of the Mackenzie Highway.


Understand[edit]
The confluence of the Smoky and Peace rivers in the Peace River Wildland Provincial Park
Grimshaw developed as a community centre for a rich mixed farming district. Its economy has transformed to become a distribution centre for northern Alberta.
By virtue of being the original starting point of Highway 35, which leads to the Northwest Territories, Grimshaw is called Mile Zero of the Mackenzie Highway.

History[edit]
The name of the town was derived from Dr. M.E. Grimshaw, a pioneer doctor from Kingston, Ontario who settled in Peace River (then known as Peace River Crossing) in 1914. He practised in the area for many years and served in the local government at the county and the village levels until he retired from politics as the mayor of Peace River in 1922.

Highway 35 (part of the Mackenzie Highway) comes in from Northwest Territories, terminating 5 km north of Grimshaw, where Highway 35 meets Highway 2.
