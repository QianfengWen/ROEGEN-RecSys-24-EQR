With a population of 9,500 (2018), Buñol is the largest town in La Hoya, the mountainous western area of Valencia province. Every year 40,000 people or more gather in the town to throw over 115,000 kilograms of tomatoes at each other in the yearly Tomatina festival. The festival is a popular sight, and tourists from across Europe flock to the town to join in the fun. 


Understand[edit]
Buñol (from Arabic al-Buniúl) has been inhabited continuously for at least 50,000 years, with archaeological remains from the Paleolithic, Iberian, and Roman eras. After the Christian Reconquista in the 13th century the town became a border post between the kingdoms of Valencia and Castile, and remained populated mostly by Moriscos until their expulsion from Spain in 1602, which brought on a regional economic collapse.
Today agriculture and industry are the primary economic activities. The climate is typical Mediterranean, with mild winters (and occasional snow) and hot summers.

It is believed to have begun in 1945, when some youths threw tomatoes at town authorities in retaliation for being denied permission to participate in a parade. The incident was repeated for several years until 1950, when after an attempt by Franco government to halt the practice, most of the townspeople began participating and it became a regular event. €10.
