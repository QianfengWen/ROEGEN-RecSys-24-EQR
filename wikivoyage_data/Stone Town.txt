The Palace Museum
Stone Town is the main city on Zanzibar. It is a city of prominent historical and artistic importance in East Africa. Its architecture, mostly dating back to the 19th century, reflects the diverse influences underlying the Swahili culture, with a unique mixture of Moorish, Arab, Persian, Indian and European elements. For this reason, the town was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2000.

Probably the most well-known landmarks of Stone Town. It was built in 1883 and restored after the Anglo-Zanzibar War of 1896. A former Sultan's residence, it became the seat of the Afro-Shirazi Party after the revolution. It was the first building in Zanzibar to have electricity and the first building in East Africa to have a lift. Since 2000, its interior has been dedicated to a museum on Swahili and Zanzibar culture.   (updated Dec 2019)

There are a number of historically important (and frankly, just plain beautiful) buildings in Stone Town, like The House of Wonders and The Arab Fort. It is easy to arrange a simple walking tour with a local guide who can teach you some history.
The market in Stone Town is one of the largest, most vibrant open-air markets anywhere. Here, you can find several varieties of bananas, "elephant garlic" unique to the island, the largest avocados you'll probably ever see, and more. Prices are extremely reasonable. Even if you have no intentions of purchasing food, the spectacle alone is worth a visit.
Visit Slave Market, the site of the old Slave Market is quite an experience. Go into the holding chambers to see how this wretched piece of history played itself out in small dark dungeon-type cells. Priced at US$5 (May 2018), it's well worth it.
Do[edit]
Roam around Stone Town appreciating the Historical buildings
Be certain to have dinner on the wharf near Blue's Restaurant in Stone Town.  Every evening, for just a few dollars, you can sample local fish, food, drinks, and hear local music.
Visit Forodhani Gardens If you are not scared of local food, then this place is definitely worth a visit. It is possibly the cheapest food you will find on the island, and value for money too. Ranging from crab claws, calamari steaks to plain old chips done in big woks. You are well advised to try the local sugar cane juice. The curio market can be found next to the food market. Do not buy the first thing you see. First take a walk through the market, and you will see prices get progressively less. You must always haggle and bargain with the vendors or try to set the prices off against each other. This is their way of doing business and it also ensures that you get the best price.

The twilight atmosphere however makes for a nice setting to have a cheap meal.

Sleep[edit]
The cheapest budget hotels start from US$14 for a dorm bed. normal budget hotel prices range TSh 45,000 to 90,000 and that's during the low season, where several hotels actually stay closed due to lack of customers. The quoted prices are after bargaining: low-season is a good time to do so and not having your bags with you when doing so, will also give you a boost.
During high-season, hotels in Stonetown will often offer their rooms on multiple online platforms (Airbnb, booking.com, etc.) and double book rooms. Be aware that your room may be given away to someone else with no apology or care by the hotel owner. One way to avoid this is to ensure you pay in advance, or to book directly with the hotel and contact them confirming your arrival.
