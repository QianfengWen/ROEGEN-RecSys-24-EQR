Newberg is a city in the Willamette Valley region of Oregon. Often referred to as "the gateway to Oregon Wine Country", Newberg is a short drive from Portland and has a small, walkable old-town with retail, bars, restaurants, and wine tasting rooms.


Understand[edit]
With a population of 27,000 in 2019, it is the second largest city in Yamhill County. Anchoring the northern tip of the fertile Willamette Valley, Newberg's cash crops of berries and stone fruits transitioned to hazelnut orchards and now are dominated by the wine business.
