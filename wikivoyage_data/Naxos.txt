Apollon's Gate on Naxos
Naxos (Greek: Νάξος) is the largest in the Cyclades island group in the Aegean Sea and was the centre of ancient Cycladic culture.
The most fertile of the Cyclades islands, Naxos earns much of its income from agriculture. It has a mountainous interior with a great variety of lush green valleys and villages, easily reachable by a well-maintained road system.
The two municipalities of Naxos and Drymalia comprise the island. The largest town and capital is Chora (or Hora) or simply 'Naxos' or 'Naxos Town', with most of the shops and restaurants frequented by visitors.
A number of beach communities extend south along the coast from Chora. The island has stunning Mediterranean beaches with white granite sand.


Understand[edit]
The port at Chora is too small for cruise ships and too close to the more famous Santorini, saving the island from hordes of tourists.  The majority of non-Greek tourists stay in the few beach towns close to Chora, so it is very easy to lose them in the rural centre, or further along the coast.  Many wealthy Athenians own houses in the old villages of Halki and Filoti and use the island as escape from the heat of Athenian summers.

Climate[edit]
The climate of Naxos varies depending on region.  The west side is sheltered and flat, getting up to 30 degrees Celsius in the summer.  Sea breezes help to prevent it feeling too stuffy directly on the coast.  In the centre, the mountains and valleys keep the air temperature cooler.  The mountains are high enough that it is rare to have a completely cloudless day, again helping to keep it cool.  The rain caused by the mountains keeps the land green and fresh, unlike its rather brown Cycladic cousins.  Rain storms are infrequent in the summer, but very heavy, turning marble paths and streets into ice rinks.

Talk[edit]
English and German are very common in Hora; French and Italian are also spoken by many.  Elderly people often only speak Greek, especially in rural central areas.  In the villages, expect to have to order in Greek or by pointing.

Get in[edit]
By boat[edit]
Naxos is a central hub in the sea transport system, and has multiple connections from and to all directions. Naxos is about 5 1/2 hours by regular ferries from Piraeus, 3:25 or 3:55 by fast ferries from Piraeus, and about 2 hours by regular ferry from Santorini.
From the Greek mainland, ferries and highspeed catamaran services run daily all year from Piraeus, and in high season from Rafina and Lavrio. NEL Lines also operates a highspeed link from Lavrio in Attica. This is a pleasant port to travel from if you have the option, as it is relatively near the airport and doesn't have the stress and chaos of Piraeus. There is also the High Speed (Hellenic Seaways) which leaves from Rafina, closer to Athens airport than Piraeus and a pleasant place to have lunch if you have time before you board your ferry. The High Speed takes just under 4 hours and is around €66 in high season.
The length of the trip does not require a cabin. Blue Star Lines is the most common carrier between Piraeus and Naxos. The ferry takes about 6 hours and the high-speed takes half that time and costs twice as much. Usually there are several departures at 7:30AM every day and then a high-speed and ferry at around 5PM and in the summer a ferry that leaves Piraeus at around 10PM. The Hellas Flying Dolphin High-speeds are catamarans and take about 4 hours to get to Naxos from Piraeus.
Various shipping companies sail for Naxos including:

Aegean Speed Lines
Blue Star Ferries
Golden Star Ferries
Hellenic Seaways
Minoan Lines
Sea Jets
Small Cyclades Lines
For online ticket purchases there are also web sites like Ferry Scanner, Ferry Hopper and Direct Ferries. They also have smartphone apps.

Central agencies
Central agencies are the agencies able to offer tickets on behalf of the ferry companies they represent. Sometimes they are offices of the ferry company themselves while in non central locations they are normally companies under license from the ferry company. It is not possible to buy tickets for a particular company in person unless from a central agency. The following are the central agencies in Naxos together with the company or companies that they represent. All can be found in the Chora (main town):

Sailing[edit]
A welcoming port together with a lack of cruise ships make Naxos a popular stopping point on an Aegean sailing cruise.

By plane[edit]
If you're starting from Athens airport, it's much quicker than the ferry, due to the transfer to Piraeus.
Olympic Air operates a daily service from Athens on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday (as of 2013). Flights take ~30 minutes, and planes are comfortable.
Sky Express also operate flights to and from Athens throughout the year.
37.08107225.3681582 Naxos airport (JNX  IATA) (3 km from Chora). A small and basic, but very friendly airport. Two airlines fly propeller planes to Athens. There is a bus to town every half hour. Taxis ask €20 for the ride to Chora.   (updated Apr 2019)

Get around[edit]
Map of Naxos
Walking[edit]
In Chora, many areas are pedestrianised, making it easy to amble from beach to cafe to shop. Outside Chora, there are many footpaths, but they are not always easy to follow. Footpaths up Zas are easy and clearly marked.  Walking on the roads is fine, with caution, as cars are infrequent, but drivers tend to go fast. In rural areas, locals will almost always offer a lift, especially if you can speak a little Greek.

Cycling[edit]
Naxos has started to develop a cycling culture, with more cycling-minded people visiting. Cycle hire is possible. Simpler mountain bikes can be rented from many "rent a car" or "rent a motorbike" shops. Fancier mountain bikes and especially road bikes can be rented from two specialty shops in Chora. If you bring your own bicycle and need repairs/parts/accessories, there is a bike repair shop near the harbour: 37.108125.376053 Giannis bike shop, in the "grota" area; they also rent road bikes. If you plan on doing serious cycling with a rental bike, consider bringing at least your own shoes with cleats. If you plan on bringing your own bike, know that Blue Star ferries transport your bike as luggage without extra charge.
Bike theft is not as prevalent as in big cities, but it is now recommended that you look after your bike or use at least a simple lock in town—though you may still see unlocked older bikes.
Drivers are getting more used to cyclists, but they generally still speed and drive recklessly, so beware. Mountain roads in summer offer a great ride, but stay hydrated and know your limits. In July and August, take advantage of early morning / early evening hours. Some of the best known road cycling routes are the climb to Apeirantho and the "circle of the island" passing by Apollona. Easier and flatter cycling routes are around Chora towards Agia Anna, Plaka, Mikri Vigla, Alyko.

Bus[edit]
There are 10 local bus lines serving Naxos, information: https://naxosbuses.com/bus-lines/
Every village has a bus service, but there may only be 3 buses a day. Find information at the bus kiosk, or ask at the 37.1079125.374374 bus office at the north end of the seafront in Chora, near the ferry building.  Tickets can be bought from the machine outside the bus offices, or from a kiosk in the villages, they cost €2 (Apr 2019). You must have a ticket before you board. Expect the morning bus to be standing-room only, full of little old ladies going shopping.

Cars, scooter and quad bikes[edit]
The roads are very well maintained, with extensive repairs and upgrades carried out within the last 10 years.
The mountain roads are windy, with steep drops, and frequent shrines, normally above a burnt out car that hasn't been recovered.  Tourists are a pain on the roads, because they are not used to Greek-style driving and don't give way, causing long tail backs.  Expect to meet a truck hurtling around a blind bend.  They take no prisoners!
A better option is a quad bike.  They are more stable and safer than scooters, are narrow enough that even if you meet a truck, you don't get run off, and have the advantage of being able to see the amazing scenery as you drive through.  They're also much easier to park in busy villages with narrow streets.
Every village has a petrol station.  The owner normally puts the petrol in for you.  Petrol stations are a social gathering point in more remote areas, so don't expect to get away without stopping to chat. When going to the eastern side of the island (Moutsouna, Panermos), take care to note that the last petrol station is near Filoti, in the center of the island, quite a distance off.

Do[edit]
Beaches[edit]
Naxos is well known for its wonderful beaches, some with advantageous winds for prime windsurfing and kitesurfing. Most of the island's west coast is one long sandy beach with crystal clear azure water. The most popular sandy stretches are Agios Prokopios, Agia Anna, Maragas, Plaka, Orkos, and Mikri Vigla, Kastraki, and Alyko.
Heading north will bring you to the beaches of Kalantos, Panormos, Psili Ammos, Lionas, and Apollonas, below the village of the same name.
Other beaches are Amitis, Kalados, Aliko, and Pyrgaki.
Naxos beaches, like those on many Greek islands, offer clothing options. Generally, nude sunbathing is more frequently encountered in southern beach communities that have sand dunes blocking the view from the access road, such as in Plaka. At the end of Plaka beach nearest to Agia Anna, there is a group of rocks and small coves, and this area is excellent for naturists. It is hidden from the road by trees, yet is an easy (300 m) walk along a flat beach from the bus stop at Paradiso taverna.
To avoid the crowds, head further south to the crystal clear waters of Mikri Vigla.  The locals swim on either side of the causeway to the Portara.  The west side is a sheltered shallow bay, with steps and seating built into the causeway.  The east side is much deeper, and if the sea is calm you can hold your breath and dive down to ancient columns that have fallen in from the temple. Beware of sea urchins!
The tiny harbours of Lionas and Moutsouna on the east coast are very picturesque and quiet even in the summer months. Both have tavernas and a beach. A newly asphalted road from Moutsouna down to Panermos is also well worth exploring, as it passes by several secluded bays.

Archaeology[edit]
Ancient ruins include the Portara gateway, visible from the harbour, and two rather modest half-finished Kouros statues uncovered in a quarry near Melanes (Kouronohori) as well as a larger version near Apollonas on the northern coast. Special attention has been given to the sites of Dimitra's Temple at Sangri, and Dionysus' temple below Glinado village, where the Ministry of Culture organizes full moon concerts in July and August.
The villages in the centre of the island are older than those around the coast, with Bronze Age origins.  They are perched high in the mountainous regions with steep narrow streets to make them defensible against pirates.  Halki village is a good example of Greek neo-classical architecture, with its cluster of red roofs.  The ancient fishing village of Moutsana was the port from which emery and marble were shipped from the islands.

Landscape[edit]
Head 10 km inland and the island changes from the flat brown swampy landscape of Hora to lush green mountain valleys.  Ancient olive and lemon groves surround the small villages, with narrow gorges with terrapin-inhabited streams.  The area is still agricultural, with this being the main source of income to the island.  Above the groves rise two chains of mountains.  The central chain is a moonscape of exposed and weather gneiss, with the village Ano Potamia perched in the middle.  Descending from these hills brings you into the secluded valley of Halki, Damarionas and Filoti.  Above Filoti rises Mt. Zas (Mt Zeus)—at 1004m, it is the highest mountain in the Cyclades.  Its marble slopes rise steeply to an impressive point.  The ascent from the north, via Aghios Marina (a rest point with a beautiful view) is easier, with frequent fountains.  The ascent from the north is much steeper and more rocky.  From the top, it is possible to see Turkey on a very clear day.

Activities[edit]
For those who love adventure, the island offers many opportunities for active sports.
The island offers several hiking trails, you can find overviews on the official Naxos website.
Bluefindivers Naxos Diving Center, located at Agios Prokopios beach, offers beautiful and safe diving/snorkelling trips around the island.
Excellent conditions are formed among meadows of seaweed (Posidonia Oceanica), sand banks, reefs and vertical cuts along with shipwrecks, not only for marine life but also for the divers/snorkellers who explore them.
Naxos Surf Club[dead link] do great value taster sessions for sailing-cats, wind surf and kite surfing, in English, Greek and German.

Trekking with Naxos Tours. Full and half day tours.
Buy[edit]
Every village has at least a small supermarket, so self-catering is easy. Hora, Halki and Glinado have decent sized supermarkets.
Only fish and chicken (both frozen) are easily available ready packaged. For red meat, a trip to a butchers is necessary, and an interesting experience for sheltered Northern Europeans. This can be quite entertaining—expect a baby goat tied up outside as advertisement, and to have to point out which bit of cow you'd like to be chopped off (unless you speak Greek!)
For really fresh eggs and chicken, try hailing the chicken truck. It drives around the island full of crates of live chickens, announcing its presence with loud speakers—it is quite a sight!
Bakeries can be found in most villages, and always worth stopping for, although they often shut at lunch time. Savoury cheese and spinach, spanokopita, baklava, loukoumi (Greek Turkish delight) and amazing sticky syrupy chocolate cake are all worth trying.

Anna's organic Shop and Garden Café. The first shop on the island of Naxos to offer exclusively biological products. Anna John offers delicious, healthy food, and detailed advice in matters of food and nutrition. It's a very nice place to have breakfast or a snack.
 Fish and Olive. In Halki village. Husband and wife Alexander Reichardt and Katarina Boelsch run this gallery in Halki. Katarina produces ceramics with distinctive moulded olive and frog designs (beware of fakes sold in cheap tourist shops), while Alex paints delicate patterns of fish and animals onto tiles and other ceramics, and designs jewelry. Follow a trip by a piece of chocolate brownie in the cafe opposite. 
Vallindras Distillery. Visit the distillery in Halki and buy their produce. The lemon liqueur might be more appreciated than ouzo or retsina, and is certainly more authentically Naxos.
37.10474425.376771 Tereza's Greek Concept Store (Tereza of Naxos), Chora Naxos, Faraggas Area (Next to the Typografio Restaurant on the steps leading to the Naxos Castle), ☏ +30 22850 22210, info@terezaofnaxos.com. 10:00-22:00. Local craft items plus some from other parts of Greece — gifts, chic clothing, and artful jewellery. (updated Jan 2024)
Eat[edit]
Due to its fertile valleys, Naxos has the richest variety of produce of the Cyclades islands (Naxos is famous in Greece for its potatoes), as well as cattle and poultry. Most restaurants serve fresh and wholesome food, but only a few stand out for excellent dishes, especially in local cuisine.
Greek specialties like moussaka, souvlaki and a wonderfully mild feta are available in restaurants. The local olive oils are superior to the 'light virgin' oil commonly available elsewhere, in that the local process leaves much more olive flavor.
Many meals start with meze in the early evening, with main courses not arriving until much later.   Meze is similar to Spanish tapas, with lots of small dishes including hummus, tatziki, olives and small fish.
There are also supermarkets on the outskirts of Hora which offer food and drink at everyday prices. As many rooms come complete with cooking facilities, this offers an excellent way to keep expenses down.

Hora[edit]
Η ΑΞΙΩΤΙΣΣΑ (Axiotissa), popularly known as The Yellow House, on the road from Hora to Pyrgaki at the height of Kastraki. Its menu blends Naxian specialties with the cuisine of Asia Minor. Reservations recommended.
Meze2 on the waterfront serves particularly good fish dishes. Their meze is great too.
 ΤΑΒΕΡΝΑ Ο ΤΖΩΝΝΗΣ (Johnny’s Taverna-Restaurant). Located in Sagri, a traditional village with hospitable residents. It uses local, fresh ingredients. 
Στης Ειρινι (Ιrini's) features Naxian home cooking such as dakos (wheat rusk topped with tomato and fresh Myzithra cheese) or the spicy Shrimp Saganaki. One of the best restaurants on the waterfront, with excellent views. The slow-cooked beef is delicious.
ΦΑΡΟΣ Αλυκού (Faros Aliko beach), famous restaurant with authentic Greek mama's recipes on the road from Hora to Pyrgaki at the height of Aliko beach next to a unique cedar forest.
 Scirocco Cafe & Restaurant (In the court square, at the centre of town), ☏ +30 22850 25931, info@scirocco-naxos.gr.

 Apolafsi, ☏ +30 22850 75483. Beautiful Naxian cuisine made with fresh produce, all homemade by Voula. Great views to enjoy a romantic evening. 
Ano Potamia[edit]
The taverna in Ano Potamia has large terraces, good quality traditional taverna fare (souvlaki, rabbit, goat, meatballs), but the best part is its stunning location, perched on high ground looking over valleys and mountains.
Drink[edit]
Naxos is famous for producing its own liquor called kitron, made from an exotic fruit which can be compared perhaps to lemons, though kitron's taste is pleasantly sweet and citric.
Its production process can be viewed at the old Valindras distillery in the village of Halki, where different varieties can also be tasted. Kitron is also produced by Promponas.
More common with the locals is a drink called raki which in winter is served hot with honey (Rakomelo). Raki is a brandy made from pomace (the pieces of grapes (including the stems and seeds) that were pressed for wine making and is similar to Italian grappa.  One of the places that continuously serves Rakomelo is Cafe Naxos, located in the narrow alleys in the port's old town. Enjoy it with your "parea" (company of friends) by the cosy fireplace or outside in summer.
Naxos On the Rocks Bar is located in the heart of Chora between the seafront (paralia), and the really old town. Have a seat in the early evening for an aperitif or a before-dinner-cocktail and watch people passing by while the sun fades away.

 Sottovento, st. george beach (Located on St. George Beach, just a few steps from the center), ☏ +30 22850 29222. Open from breakfast till night. Pizza etc (updated May 2023)
Sleep[edit]
As on most islands, a phalanx of touts greets each arriving ferry waving placards advertising rooms for rent and (usually) offering free transport. In the months of July and August you should book in advance; but otherwise, these immediately available rooms are often the best value. Bargaining is usually possible. Be sure and establish the location of the accommodations first—as distance can add to expense.

Stay safe[edit]
Naxos is generally a safe island.
Be aware of rental scams, especially with agencies working only with motorbikes and ATVs. Using these types of vehicles is very common on Naxos and there are a lot of rental agencies. Some of them are ready to cheat. They will offer faulty motorbikes or ATVs for a lower price, but in case of accident they will demand that the customer pay for the whole cost of damage. They are offering only basic insurance but will present it like full insurance. Also, there is a big possibility of serious injuries.
It is possible to recognize these rental agencies by observing them aggressively attracting tourists and offering lower prices than others. Employees in front of these type of agencies will be loud and ready to promise everything until the contract is signed. It is necessary to check the vehicle before making any decision. Their vehicles are in most of the cases dusty, dirty and look old.

Word of advice: It is not an uncommon story on Naxos that someone who initially planned to stay for only a few days missed their original ferry out, and liked the island so much that they ended up staying there forever. They are living proof of Ariadne's legend, who was left behind here by Theseus after they escaped from Crete, and remained to become the wife of Dionysus.
