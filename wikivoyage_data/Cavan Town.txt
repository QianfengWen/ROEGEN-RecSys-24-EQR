Cavan is the county town of County Cavan in northwest Ireland. The same name (Irish An Cabhán, the hollow) is used for the county, so on this page it's referred to as Cavan Town wherever ambiguity might arise.


Understand[edit]
Cavan RC Cathedral
Cavan is a provincial market town astride the Dublin-Enniskillen-Donegal road, nowadays the N3. It grew up from the early 17th century as English and Scots "plantations" were established to keep the Irish in check and promote industry and urbanisation. That process swept away the castle and friary, so the town has little to show of its turbulent medieval period, and its core is 19th century. It was a major bottleneck on the N3 until the bypass was completed in 2006. Cavan's main attraction is the "drumlin belt" - the "basket of eggs" landscape and islet-dotted lakes that stretch across Ireland from Clew Bay in County Mayo to Strangford Lough in County Down. In 2016 the town had a population of 10,914. 
Cavan Tourist Office is within the County Council building on Farnham St, open M-F 09:00-17:00.

See[edit]
Town centre: the historic spine with 19th century low-rise is along Church St and the narrow Main St, one-way traffic southbound. It's flanked 100 m west by Farnham St, broad and modern, leading to the bus station.
The Friary on Abbey St was founded in the early 14th century by the Dominicans, but in 1393 they were ejected and replaced by the Franciscans. It was wrecked several times (eg one drunken monk accidentally started a fire) but persisted until the Dissolution. It was then rebuilt as a Protestant church, which in turn was demolished in 1820. The old graveyard remains, with a tower thought to incorporate the friary's tower.
The Water Mill on River St is from 1846. It's been restored to working order as a museum piece, but is closed in 2021.
53.995-7.3621 Cathedral of Saints Patrick and Felim is RC, a neo-classical white granite building of 1938-42. The interior layout is unusual, and the place is disliked by some as a "disappointing sham-Renaissance structure".
53.993-7.4132 St Fethlimidh's Cathedral is C of I. It's at Kilmore, 6 km southwest of town. It was built in 1860 but incorporates features of its predecessors, including a Romanesque doorway from 1170.
54.007-7.4683 Killykeen Forest Park is one of the best places to admire the county's drumlin landscape, here flooded by Lough Oughter to form multiple islets and wetlands. A footbridge west leads through the woods to Gartnanoul, a Neolithic double-court tomb. Cloughoughter Castle to the north is the picturesque ruin of a circular 13th century bastion, perched on an islet. Trinity Island, now a peninsula at the south end of the lough, has the scrappy remains of a medieval friary.
54.015-7.5294 Killeshandra is another good area: it's on the west bank of the lough, with lots of self-catering cottages.
54.058-7.4795 Drumlane Abbey: see Belturbet for this ruin and Round Tower at the north end of the lough.
54.074-7.0816 Cootehill on the boundary with County Monaghan has many well-preserved Georgian buildings. The grandest is Bellamount Castle, built in Palladian style in the 1720s; it's in the forest 1 km northeast of the village. It was sold in 2015 and isn't open for tours, but you can stroll in the forest.
