Marco Island is an island city in Southwest Florida at the edge of the Everglades. Popular with vacationers for its beautiful beaches and small-town appeal, Marco Island doesn't offer many attractions, but those looking for relaxation and recreation will find plenty to enjoy. 


Understand[edit]
Bird life of Marco Island
Home to about 28,000 people in 2029, it is the largest of the Ten Thousand Islands. Marco, once a sleepy, small town, is now a year-round beach and boating resort island. 
The six miles of uncrowded beaches on Marco Island are among the widest in Florida and feature bright white, sugar sand and bountiful shelling opportunities. There are two public beaches (Tigertail and South Beach), a private beach complex for residents (Residents' Beach), and offshore island beaches, such as Keewaydin Island. It is close to the shopping and restaurants of Naples, while preserving a secluded, island atmosphere with limited traffic. With over 100 miles of canals, Marco Island is a boater's paradise.
The residents are preserving the quiet nature of the island with a new, restrictive noise ordinance with hefty fines for renters who make noise after 8PM.

Get in[edit]
From the east coast of South Florida, drivers can take Interstate 75 (Alligator Alley) westbound into the Naples-Marco Island Metropolitan Area. Drivers coming from the north can also take I-75 southbound.

By plane[edit]
The nearest airport is Marco Island Executive Airport, a private general aviation airport 4 miles (6.4 km) northeast of the central business district of Marco Island.  
The nearest airport with commercial service is Southwest Florida International Airport in Fort Myers.  Other nearby airports include Fort Lauderdale, Miami, and Sarasota–Bradenton.  

By ferry[edit]
During the tourist season of the winter months, Key West Express offers connections to Key West twice weekly on their 155-foot catamaran fast ferry. Standard fares are $161 for a roundtrip, with discounts available for children, seniors, and for purchasing in advance.

By bus[edit]
The only public transit connections are local bus routes.  Collier Area Transit's route 21 connects Marco Island with the mainland and line 121 connects Marco Island to Immokalee.  

Get around[edit]
Marco Island is easily navigable by car and bicycle. It is also a great walking town, and pedestrians will appreciate the additional safety measure provided by large flashing signs at designated crosswalks.

Map of Marco Island

The main highlight of Marco Island is the white-sand beach. Depending on the time of year you visit, it is rarely overcrowded (except on occasion outside of the major resorts), and aside from the water you can check out the countless seashells lining the shore. On a clear day, the view of the sunset is spectacular from the 25.9396-81.73831 Marco Island beach.

Do[edit]
Marco Island offers many activities. Within the town, biking or rollerblading along the streets of the island isn't too difficult as many of the secondary routes are designed for slow traffic. Alternatively you can play golf or tennis at your hotel or at one of the city's recreational centers.
For water activities, you can rent a boat and go sailing or fishing on the Gulf, or swim and sunbathe on the beach. The Gulf waters are refreshingly calm and cool. You can go para-sailing on the ocean. The ride is fun and the aerial views are incredible.
