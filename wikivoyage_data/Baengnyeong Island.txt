Baengnyeong Island (Baengnyeongdo, 백령도, 白翎島) is in Gyeonggi province in South Korea.


Understand[edit]
It is part of the five islands in the West Sea and is the largest of the five islands. It is the westernmost part of South Korea and the northernmost part of the West Sea. Baengnyeong Island has beautiful cliffs, and the sunset that turns the cliffs red is very beautiful. Originally, it belonged to Jangyeon-gun, Hwanghae-do, but it was incorporated into Ongjin-gun after Korean liberation. The island was known as Gokdo Island, but it is now called Baengnyeong Island because it looks like an ibis flying in the air with its white wings spread out. Indangsu, one of the backgrounds of Simcheongjeon (The Tale of Sim Chong), a famous traditional fairy tale in Korea, is here. Simcheong is a very filial person, so many tourists learn Simcheong's filial piety here. 

Location of Baengnyeong Island
