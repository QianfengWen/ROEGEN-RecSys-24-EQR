An abandoned fishing village, founded in the early 17th century and fully abandoned in the 1970s with the shift of Qatar's economy to one based on mineral resources.

Arrangements can also be made through Doha-based tour groups.

Al Zubarah Fort
25.97861151.0263898 Al Zubarah Fort. An ancient fort, and a museum. Listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site since 2013 - situated just 100 km west of Doha lies the town of Al Zubarah, an important archaeological site famous for its old fort. This fort-turned-museum was constructed in 1938 during the reign of Sheikh Abdullah Bin Jassim Al-Thani and was erected on the ruins of a neighbouring fort. The fort itself is square-shaped with circular towers in three of its corners and a rectangular tower in the fourth. With high, thick walls, this fort also served as a coast-guard station and, until the mid-1980s, was used by the military. The nearby archaeological site of the town appears to be closed. Free.   (updated Sep 2019)
It is possible to get to the fort solely by public transport. The Route 100 bus ([1]) towards Al Shamal runs return from Al Ghanim Bus Station three times a day. The journey takes about two hours each way. If you are planning on a day trip from Doha, the only option is to take the first departure from Doha at 10:15 and catch the last 16:43 return bus at Zubarah back to the city. It will give you about 4 and a half hours at the fort, which is more than enough time to observe the surroundings. An alternative for those wish to spend more than a day around the Qatari countryside is to catch the 18:12 Route 100 bus at Zubarah onward to one of the nearby towns, such as the northernmost seaside village of Al Ruwais, where you can catch a later Route 101 evening bus back to Doha. Ticketing information is included in the Qatar article.
