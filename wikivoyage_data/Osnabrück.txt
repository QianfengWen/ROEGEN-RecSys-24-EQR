Osnabrück is a city of 165,000 people (2018) in Lower Saxony. It is one of the four largest cities in Lower Saxony, and sits in a valley penned between the Wiehen Hills and the northern tip of the Teutoburg Forest. After over two thirds of the city was destroyed in World War II, the Altstadt (old town) was eventually reconstructed extensively with designs faithful to the original medieval architecture.

Osnabrück is a typical mid-sized Lower Saxon city. Osnabrück has become well known for its industry. There are many companies in the automobile, paper, steel and grocery sectors in the city and its surrounding area.
Osnabrück's modern, urban image is enhanced by the presence of more than 22,000 students studying at the University and the University of Applied Sciences. Surveys have shown its residents to be the most satisfied citizens in Germany.
Although part of the state of Lower Saxony, historically, culturally and linguistically Osnabrück is considered part of the region of Westphalia.

History[edit]
The founding of Osnabrück was linked to its positioning on important European trading routes. Charles the Great founded the Diocese of Osnabrück in 780. The city was also a member of the Hanseatic League. At the end of the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648), the Peace of Westphalia was negotiated in Osnabrück and the nearby city of Münster. In recognition of its role as the site of negotiations, Osnabrück later adopted the title Friedensstadt ("city of peace").
The city is also known as the birthplace of anti-war novelist Erich-Maria Remarque (All Quiet on the Western Front) and painter Felix Nussbaum.
Osnabrück was also the home of the largest British garrison outside the United Kingdom.

Stay safe[edit]
Osnabrück is quite safe. There are break-ins and sometimes drunks getting lagered up, as well as rowdy, trouble making kids. Overall there are still very few violent crimes.
Still, the Neumarkt and the Rosenplatz should be avoided at night.

Cope[edit]
In some parts of Osnabrück, locals resented the British military bases in town and are reluctant to speak English unless you have made an attempt in German. In others, people may automatically recognise that you aren't German and may thus begin a conversation in English. Since the British left Osnabrück in 2008 this may be diminishing.
