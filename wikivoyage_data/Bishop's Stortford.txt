Bishop's Stortford is an historic market town in Hertfordshire. The historic core of Stortford is covered by a Conservation Area, with 105 heritage-listed buildings. Much of the Conservation Area is also an Area of Archaeological Significance. Many of its 41,000 residents (2020) commute to London for work. 


Understand[edit]
United Reformed Church
A market town established during the rule of the Roman Empire, but then abandoned after the Romans withdrew from the UK. Then, during the Saxon era a new settlement developed at the same location known as Steort-ford. Then in 1060, the Bishop of London purchased the manor house, resulting in the name of the town today. The town lies on the River Stort, the river being named after the town (not the town after the river).
