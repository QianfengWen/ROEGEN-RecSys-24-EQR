Syracuse (Italian: Siracusa,  Sicilian: Sarausa or Seragusa) is a city of 122,000 people (2017) on the eastern coast of Sicily. The city has a rich Greek and Roman history, culture, amphitheatres, and architecture. Syracuse is a good base for exploring south-east Sicily, including the Baroque towns of Ragusa and Noto, several archaeological sites, and the lively city of Catania. "Syracuse and the Rocky Necropolis of Pantalica" have been listed on the UNESCO World Heritage list.


Understand[edit]
View of Syracuse and Mount Etna in the background
Syracuse was an important centre in the Grecian period.  Roman writer Cicero described it as "the greatest Greek city and the most beautiful of them all". Master mathematician Archimedes lived and worked here, but was killed during the Roman conquest. There are many places of interest, most of them in two areas: the island of Ortigia (Ortygia) reflects the early modern or baroque period. Neapolis, the "new town", is older by about 2000 years.
The Tourist Information Centre 37.06031815.2944111  is within the Provincial Government building at 31 Via Roma on Ortigia island.

See[edit]
Isola di Ortigia[edit]
Piazza Duomo
Inside the Cathedral
Ortigia island is the oldest part of Syracuse. It's connected to the rest of the city by two bridges. Boat trips leave from the channel here.

37.06388915.2930561 Tempio di Apollo. The first sight you reach after crossing the bridge are these remnants of a temple to Apollo, with two columns and part of the wall. You can't enter, just look over the railings.   (updated Apr 2018)
37.05944415.2936112 Cattedrale della Natività di Maria Santissima (Santa Maria delle Colonne), Piazza Duomo. This was built as a Greek Temple of Athena in the 5th century BC on older foundations. In the 7th century it was converted to a church, incorporating most of its former construction including the Doric columns. In the 9th century, it became a mosque; in the 11th century the Normans converted it back into a church adding a new roof with mosaics in the apses. Then after the 1693 Sicily earthquake it was rebuilt in grand Baroque style. €2.   (updated Oct 2019)
37.05867515.2932023 Chiesa di Santa Lucia alla Badia, Piazza Duomo. In the apse, behind the altar, there was a large painting of the "Burial of Saint Lucy" by Caravaggio which was returned to Chiesa di Santa Lucia al Sepolcro. No admission.   (updated Dec 2021)
The midpoint of Ortigia is Piazza Archimedes, honoring the famous citizen who lived and worked here circa 287-212 BCE. His brilliance lay in combining pure mathematical reasoning (e.g. anticipating calculus, and deriving an accurate estimate of pi) with practical innovative engineering (e.g. the water screw, and compound pulley). Centre of the piazza is an ornate "Fountain of Diana", built in 1907. Classicists don't believe the story that Archimedes leapt from his bath and ran naked crying "Eureka!" - but if, through the suds and steam, he'd beheld this bathful of sea monsters, gigantic buxom women, and wild horses, how else could he have reacted?
37.057315.29294 Antica Fonte Aretusa (Font of Arethusa). It's a pond with a fresh water source surrounded by papyrus reeds, which inspired many of poets and writers. The legend says that Alpheus, son of Oceanus, fell madly in love with the a nymph named Aretusa. The nymph didn't share his feelings. To save her, Artemis turned her into a water source. Zeus also turned Alpheus into a river, allowing him to meet up with Aretusa... but these watery legends are sending a stern strategic message. Ortigia has its own fresh water supply, drawn from the limestone aquifers, so its enemies should think twice about trying to besiege it.   (updated Apr 2018)
37.05361115.2952785 Castello Maniace, ☏ +39 0931 450 8211. M-Sa holidays 08:30-16:30. In the middle ages Syracuse was fortified as a bulwark against Ottoman expansion. The island of Ortigia was guarded by fortresses at each end: the northern Marchetti fortress has long gone. The smaller, later Maniace fortress remains at the southern tip, with Vauban-style bastions and a dry moat cut between fort and city. There are small exhibitions on the history of the fortress, and of Norman ceramics discovered at the site. €7.   (updated Dec 2021)
Neapolis[edit]
Roman amphitheatre near the Greek theatre.
Paradise Quarries in the Parco Archeologico
Syracuse was founded around 734 BC, but there was a second wave of construction from 485 BC in this area: hence its Greek name Νεάπολη - "Neapoli" or "New City". The sights are all contained within the 37.075315.2796 Parco Archeologico della Neapolis (Archaeological Area), Via Francesco Saverio Cavallari, ☏ +39 0931 66206. Daily 08:30-18:30 (last entry 17:00). East side of Via Cavallari are the ticket offices, a large parking lot for buses, toilets & fast food, and a vast display of tourist tat. Buy tickets there or across the road at the complex of ruins and sights on the west side. The order of listings below follows the recommended itinerary, though you're not tied to it, so if one area is congested by tour groups, it's easy to skip and come back to it later. €16.50; combined ticket €21.50 (+ either archaeological museum Paolo Orsi or Palazzo Bellomo Gallery).   (updated Dec 2021)

37.07623615.276257 Latomia del Paradiso. From the entrance, follow the driveway to descend into a great bosky hollow. These are the ancient stone quarries, worked on from the sixth century BC. Two grottos or galleries burrow into the rockface. Largest is Orecchio di Dionisio or "Ear of Dionysius". Some grotto! - its dimensions are worthy of the gothic nave of a city cathedral. The name arises from its acoustics: the legend says that the tyrant Dionysios could stand outside and listen to whispered conversations of those imprisoned therein. Difficult to believe this, once you've savoured the distorted echoing babble of tourists.The second and smaller is Grotto dei Cordari ie the cave of cordwainers or ropemakers. Dark, not particularly straight, far from dry, so it's not obvious why they would work here. At the very north end of the quarries are Necropoli Grotticelle - which supposedly contains Archimedes' tomb, but the site of this is unknown. It's probably easier to view from the street after leaving the park.   (updated Apr 2018)
37.0761115.2758 Teatro Greco. Built circa 470 BC but with reconstruction in the 3rd century BC and Roman period. Further work continues today, so you can look down on it but can't enter: they're rebuilding the stage, and a tier of wooden bleachers. Greek drama is performed here May - July, typically at sunset. These performances are in Italian, without amplification as the natural acoustics are so good. It is the largest remaining Greek theatre on Sicily, but there isn't much left other than the seats.   (updated Oct 2019)
37.07440515.277239 Ara di Ierone II (Altar of Hiero II). This massive piece of rock, 199 m long by 23 m wide, was the foundation block of an altar, the largest known from the ancient world. It was built by King Hiero II (who had Archimedes in his employ) some time before 200 BC. Nothing else remains of the temple here; classicists believe it was probably built to the glory of the deity Zeus, and definitely built to glorify Hiero himself.   (updated Apr 2018)
37.07415315.2789510 Anfiteatro romano (Roman amphitheatre). Built 60-40 BC under Augustus or Julius Caesar, this is mostly carved out of the hillside, with no superstructure surviving. So effectively it's a grassy pit 140 m long by 119 m wide, and you'll have to use your imagination to see the tiered seating and walkways. The pit in the centre held machinery for stage effects.

Also known as Chiesa di Santa Lucia fuori le mura as it was behind the walls (extra moenia) a Byzantine church built, according to tradition, in the same place of the martyrdom of the saint in 303 AD. The current appearance is from the 15th-16th centuries. The most ancient parts still preserved include the portal, the three half-circular apses and the first two orders of the belfry. Next to the church is located the sepolcro (tomb) of the Santa Lucia, at the place where she as regarded was executed. This church hosts "Burial of Saint Lucy" by Caravaggio which was located at the Chiesa di Santa Lucia alla Badia at the Piazza Duomo. Under the church there are catacombs which are not open to the public.  (updated Dec 2021)

This church is a huge concrete cone built from 1966 but only completed in 1994, inspired by a mass-produced Madonna statue that is said to have cried real tears in 1953. The interior is a great circular expanse, with six of the 20-some side spaces dedicated as chapels, with the tower above like some colossal machine part. The lower floor or crypt is an equally large circular space.   (updated Apr 2018)
