Batu Ferringhi is a beach town in Penang, Malaysia. It takes up the northern coast of Penang island along with the nearby beach town of Tanjung Bungah and the local fishing village of Teluk Bahang, which are also covered on this page.


Understand[edit]
Along the sandy strip of Batu Ferringhi
Probably the single most heavily developed stretch of tourist resorts in the entire country, the scenery and the beaches have undeniably suffered under the assault of all that concrete.  Still, while the beaches aren't the best in Malaysia, there are still miles of white sand and palm trees left.  Fierce competition keeps hotel prices low and there's some great food to be found too. Also a notable fact making the decision to visit Batu Ferringhi an easier one is, that the more you approach to the west, the less the touristisation has infected the beaches. Beaches near the famous night-market are very nice, though with less than perfect water quality because of the extensive powered water sports and infestations of jellyfish.

Orientation[edit]
From east to west (that is, moving further 'out' from George Town and the airport), the main beaches are Tanjung Bungah, Batu Ferringhi proper and Teluk Bahang.

Get in[edit]
5°27′50″N 100°14′31″EMap of Batu Ferringhi
From Kuala Lumpur, a 45-minute flight to Penang Airport, or several hours by bus or car.
On Penang Island (and neighbouring Butterworth), Penang's Rapid Transit bus system is very efficient, with a fleet of modern buses (some even have free wi-fi). It's possible to catch a bus #102 all the way to Batu Ferringhi from the airport, or you might have to go to the central transport hub — Komtar in George Town first and then catch a #101 bus. Bus drivers are usually quite helpful.
Taxis are the alternative - they almost never use the meter, so negotiate a price first.


Get around[edit]
Taxis trawl up and down the windy roads of the north coast. Fares are negotiable but tourists will have a hard time getting anywhere for less than RM 15. Most hotels have shuttle services too.
Penang Rapid buses are fairly regular till about 11PM, plying the route from Georgetown through Tanjung Bungah, Batu Ferringhi to Teluk Bahang. One bus route goes down the western coast from Teluk Bahang, but with an average frequency of 2 hours at best, and reputedly can't be relied on. 7-day Rapid Transit Passport cards (RM 30) give unlimited travel, though are available from limited locations including Komtar and the airport (see website for complete details). Bus stops can be unmarked, so ask a local.

Eat[edit]
Butter Prawns from a hawker in Batu Feringhi
There are plenty of places to eat all around, although discerning gourmands might want to explore less watered-down Malaysian cuisine in George Town.
One option worth a special trip are the seafood restaurants at the pier of Teluk Bahang, at the northwestern tip of the island, past the hotels and the little village.  The famed "End of the World" has closed, but quite a few have sprung up to take its place.
For families, or those who just want to get out of the resort, you can't go past the hawker centres and fresh fruit stalls on the side of the road.  At the hawker centres the kids can pick and choose what they like from the different shops, you just pay the bill when it is delivered to your table.  For best results, stick with the Asian cuisines, the attempts at Western food are not worth eating.

Viva Food Court, formerly known as "Golden Sands Bayview food court; this eatery is just outside the Naza Hotel and it provides a wide range of Malaysian food (mostly Penang hawker).
Ferringhi Garden, just south of the Parkroyal Plaza. A little pricey, but a wonderful atmosphere and a very wide ranging menu.
Gerai Makanan, hawker centre near the Golden Sands Resort Hotel, a dozen or so food and drink stalls. Covers a range of cuisines, with Indian, Chinese, Malay, Seafood and reasonably priced beer.
Khaleel Nasi, at the south end of Eden Parade mall, serves reasonable Muslim Indian food such as roti, prata and nasi kandar. Good for breakfast, brunch or lunch and expect to pay RM 8 per person for a filling meal and a soft drink.
Beach Corner Seafood, good quality seafood restaurant at reasonable prices almost on the beach near the Lone Pine Hotel.
5.4659100.24121 Marco Polo, Jalan Batu Ferringhi (Inside Bayview Hotel). Good Malaysian and international food and air conditioning. (updated Jul 2015)
 Hard Rock Cafe (At Hard Rock Hotel). Western food, including good burgers. Air conditioned. (updated Jul 2015)
Drink[edit]
Fresh juice at the hawker centre about halfway through the markets.  At RM2 each, these are a bargain and there are many different combinations, helpful if you are travelling with fussy kids!

Sleep[edit]
There are lots of options with rack rates above RM 500, but only in peak season (notably Christmas/New Year) will you have to pay this much. The cheaper places charge around RM 50.

Budget[edit]
Almost all backpacker accommodation, in the form of local guest houses opposite the beach past the Parkroyal Resort has been destroyed and it's really difficult to find some cheap bed. A simple room with a fan begin at around RM 15-60 per night, it is some times cheaper to sleep in Georgetown (also much more services and better local meals) and travel back and forth by public bus. If arriving by bus get off at the post office and walk down to the beach.

Go next[edit]
There is still plenty more of Penang to visit, simply hop on one of the local Rapid Penang buses and explore.

Head south to discover Penang's backcountry at Balik Pulau. The area is literally the back of the island and is a slice of an undeveloped Penang. Around the expansive area you will find kampungs, fruit farms and rice paddies scattered throughout.
Visit Air Itam, a town just west of George Town. Explore the famous Penang Hill, either by funicular train or spend a few hours and trek to the top. The views of Penang are exceptional from the hill. Be sure to check out the local markets and the gigantic Kek Lok Si Temple.
Cross over to Penang's mainland, which is somewhat off the tourist track. The towns of Butterworth and Bukit Mertajam are a great place to start.
