Siauliai is an industrial city in Samogitia, the northwest region of Lithuania, though it borders Aukštaitija the northeast region. It's the country's fourth largest city: in 2023 the population was 40,434, with a total of about 108,000 across the metropolis. It's a modern city with several sites of interest, but the stand-out is the "Hill of Crosses" pilgrimage site 12 km north. 


Understand[edit]
Šiauliai takes its founding date as 22 Sept 1236, when it was documented as the site of the Battle of Saule - though probably that was 30 km northeast. It grew slowly, being devastated in the 16th and 18th centuries by plague and "The Deluge", the invasion by Sweden. After a rebellion in 1769 it was rebuilt in classical style on a grid pattern, and boomed in the 19th when road and rail transport fostered its industries. The big business here was leather and related trades such as footwear, textiles, candles and confectionery, and local magnate Chaim Frankel built a fine mansion on the proceeds. Šiauliai was wrecked in the First World War and eviscerated in the Second, when within a few weeks of the Nazi arrival its large Jewish population lay in the forest graves they were forced to dig for themselves.
Postwar Soviet rule was oppressive but established industries of metal-bashing (including a bicycle factory), electronics, wood-processing and construction. Independence in 1990 led to growth of the service sector and a westward-facing economy. The airport from 2020 was developed as an Airbus servicing facility, and its military role continues as it's within 15 minutes flying time of NATO's eastern frontier.

 Rooster Clock Square (Gaidžio laikrodžio aikštė) (intersection of Vilniaus g and Tilžės g next to the Photography Museum). The downtown crossroads and rendezvous point. The rooster on the clocktower traditionally flapped its wings and squawked a greeting, but broke down in Soviet times. It was repaired in 2003 and now squawks in several languages at 12:00 and 18:00 daily. Vilniaus g is pedestrianised and dotted with street sculptures and murals. (updated Sep 2023)

The Iron Fox
55.930823.32524 Sundial Square. A lakeside park, where a Golden Boy on a column shoots an arrow in the general direction of Minsk. The column casts a shadow on a sundial below, and commemorates the Battle of Saule (which means "sun") on 22 Sept 1236. The Livonian Brothers of the Sword advanced out of Riga to lay into the pagan Samogitian and Semigallian tribes, and to link up with their allies the Teutonic Knights of Prussia. But on swampy ground they were slaughtered by lightly-armed, more agile pagan forces; the Brothers were broken by the defeat, and their territories rebelled. Their survivors joined the Teutonic Knights, which remained powerful until broken in turn at Grunwald in 1410. The site of the Battle of Saule is thought to be Jauniūnai, 30 km northeast of town towards Joniškis. (updated Sep 2023)
 Old city cemetery. The atmospheric woodland park next to the sundial. It was created in 1831 when cholera struck the city, and used until 1959, with Catholic, Orthodox and "Free-thinkers" sections. Many monuments were lost to wartime bombing. (updated Sep 2023)
 Iron Fox (Geležinė lapė). A big metal sculpture on the lake shore east of the cemetery. Either he / she is marking territory, or a scoop-bag the size of a bin-liner will shortly be needed. (updated Sep 2023)
55.932523.32065 Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral (Šv apaštalų Petro ir Pauliaus katedra), Aušros takas 3, ☏ +370 41 528077. Prominent with its 75 m spire, this large Roman Catholic church was built in Renaissance style in the 1620s. It was part defensive - note the shooting loops - as it was at risk from armed robbery and sectarian riots. It was bashed about in wartime but restored, and promoted to cathedral in 1997. Pity about the drab modern block of flats next to it.  (updated Aug 2023)

Hill of crosses[edit]
On the Hill of Crosses
56.01527823.41666713 Hill of Crosses (Kryziu Kalnas) (Take a bus towards Joniškis and get off at Domantai; these run hourly and take 15 min. Walk 2 km along the lane signed "Kryziu Kalnas"—if you're accompanied by a scrummage of headscarves you are going the right way. Also possible by taxi, where 30-45 min should be long enough.). 24/7. A pilgrimage site 12 km north of Šiauliai. It's a hillock or embankment packed with crosses - over 100,000 at the latest estimate in 2006, with more arriving daily. The cross was a pagan symbol long before Lithuania's conversion to Christianity in 1387, the last European country to convert, and there may already have been a tradition of planting them here on the site of a hill fort. However the modern cult started in 1831 after a failed uprising against Russian rule; many rebels' bodies were never found so their families planted crosses here in remembrance. Another uprising in 1863 had the same outcome. The hill thus became symbolic of Lithuanian national endurance under oppression. The Soviets bulldozed the site three times and erected fences and ditches, but back came the crosses. Pope John Paul II visited in Sept 1993 - the open structure just north is where he held mass. You're free to plant your own cross so long as it's less than 3 m tall, and tourist shops sell these. Good luck finding a place to plant it, and many visitors have failed to, so in places crosses lie in a jumble like a scrapyard. Free.   (updated Sep 2023)
56.01711623.42059514 Franciscan Hermitage (Mazesniuju broliu ordino Lietuvos sv Kazimiero provincijos Kryziu kalno vienuolynas) (300 m northeast, access via the road if it's been raining, the direct path gets muddy). The Brothers Minor of the Franciscan Province of St Casimir. It has 16 cells for novice monks but its church is open to visitors. Instead of a crucifix and wall behind the altar, there's a large window so the backdrop is of the crosses on the hill, so the church is not conventionally "oriented". Consecrated in 2000, it was built after the Pope pointedly asked where was the church?  (updated Sep 2023)
