Kirkcudbright (pronounced "kuh-KOO-bry") is a coastal town in Dumfries and Galloway in southwest Scotland, with a poppulation in 2020 of 3350. Farming and fishing are its main trades. In the late 19th century several artists were attracted to paint in this area, notably EA Hornel (1864-1933), who came to live in Broughton House. Variously described as "The Glasgow Boys" or as Impressionists, they were much influenced by Japanese print, by French realism and by the natural scenes they found in Scotland — and above all they loathed the snooty Edinburgh art establishment. Their art movements eventually dissolved into others but Kirkcudbright continued to attract painters, so today it has a collection of galleries out of proportion to its size.

Kirkcudbright is almost cut off from the public transport network. The nearest railway station is Dumfries, 27 miles east, with trains every hour or two between Carlisle, Kilmarnock and Glasgow Central. 
DGC Bus 505 / 555 is a school bus — anyone can use it but it only runs once on schooldays, from Kirkcudbright around 9AM via Castle Douglas to Dumfries, taking 75 min, and setting off back around 2PM. A second bus only runs from Dumfries as far as Castle Douglas.
Bus 517 runs once M-F from Gatehouse of Fleet via Borgue, taking 40 min to Kirkcudbright. 
So you need a car. Follow A75 west from Carlisle and Dumfries towards Stranraer, and branch south onto A762.

Get around[edit]
Walk around town, but you need your own wheels for outlying sights and accommodation.

The witch who wasn't 
It sounds medieval, but belief in witches, and legal or church persecutions, were uncommon in Britain until the 16th century. Then the belief system grew, witchcraft was made a capital crime, and people started seeing them everywhere. King James VI and I was particularly obsessed by diabolical plots, personally attended some trials and wrote a tract against witchcraft. Scotland had witch-hunts out of proportion to its population, with some 4000-6000 tried and 1500 put to death. Prosecutions were especially common in Dumfries, Galloway and the East Coast, with those convicted being hanged or strangled then their bodies burnt. But scepticism grew in the 18th century, and the laws were changed in 1735-36.
Jean Maxwell, the "Galloway Sorceress", might then seem unlucky to be tried in 1805 in Kirkcudbright, for the crime of pretending to be a witch. Damned if you do and damned if you don't? But it was bad enough: she was abusing a gullible young farm servant, extorting "protection money" from her against the devil, amid sulphurous threats, eye-rolling and hocus-pocus. Maxwell was convicted under the 1735 laws and was jailed for a year. Heaven knows what might have happened 100 years earlier, to her and anyone associated with her.
