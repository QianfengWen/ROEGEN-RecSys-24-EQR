El Alamein (العلمين) is city on the north coast of Egypt, famous as the site of major battles between British and German forces during the Second World War (see World War II in Africa). 
This article also includes the adjacent areas of New Alamein, Marina el Alamein and Leukaspis. Marina-el-Alamein is a sea resort from the 1980s just north of El Alamein, and next to it is the archeological site Leukaspis (also known as Antiphrae). 
Winston Churchill once described El Alamein as having the best climate in the world and during the late 2010s the Egyptian government decided to make good use of El Alamein's touristic potential with the mega-project New Alamein. Resorts, skyscrapers and new residential areas are being built along the coast as part of that city since 2018.

El-Alamein is famous for the two Second World War battles fought here in 1942. The first battle took place on 27 July, when the German-Italian Panzerarmee Afrika commanded by Erwin Rommel coming from Tobruk, Libya, managed to break through the lines of the British Commonwealth troops and advance to Height 26 west of El-Alamein. 
A few months later they tried to advance further, leading to the second battle that was fought between 23 October and 4 November. There the Axis tank army was beaten by the British 8th army commanded by Bernard Montgomery. In total, around 80,000 soldiers were wounded or killed in the two battles.
From 1943 to 1947, German and Italian POWs, under the command of the British, collected the fallen from the battlefields and buried them in cemeteries in town. The temporary graves for the Axis soldiers were on Height 33. In 1955, works commenced on the German and Italian memorials, and they were finished in 1959. Today El Alamein is a city of about 10,000 inhabitants, known for its oil fields and for war tourism.

Marina el Alamein[edit]
Marina el-Alamein, (مارينا العلمين, Mārīnā al-ʿAlamain), also known as Porto Marina or just Marina, is a yacht port just northeast of El Alamein. It's mostly a holiday resort for the domestic elite, designed by the Egyptian Amer group and built in the mid-1980s by the China State Construction Engineering Corporation. There are hotels, restaurants, apartment buildings and the marina making up this districts are placed around a lagoon, 4-6 m deep, connected to the Mediterranean.

Leukaspis[edit]
Just east of the Marina, and 5 km northeast of El Alamein is Leukaspis (Greek:Λεύκασπις), also known as Antiphrai (Greek: Ἀντίφραι). Leukaspis was a port city during Classical antiquity, and today it is an archaeological site with Greek and Roman ruins. It's one of the best preserved sites right on the Mediterranean coast.
It's disputed which name was used for the port city back in the day, and therefore it's sometimes referred to as the archaeological site at Marina el-Alamein. Greek geographer Strapo, working before and after Christ, described places along the coast and both the descriptions of Leukaspis and Antiphrai would fit the current site.
It was rediscovered the 1920s, when excavations brought catacombs and old cisterns to light. It was almost destroyed in 1986 during the construction of the Marina resort, but since then Leukaspis has been taken care of as an archaeological site, being excavated and conserved by the Polish-Egyptian Archaeological Mission led by Wiktor Andrzej Daszewski.

New Alamein[edit]
New Alamein City (العلمين الجديدة al-ʿAlamain al-Ǧadīda) is a new city in construction since 2018, when President Abd al-Fattah as-Sisi laid the first stone. This megaproject is about developing a center for tourism, education and administration. Most of the city is between the Commonwealth and German military cemeteries, and the northern part if immediately west of Marina el-Alamein. 
There are high apartment buildings along the coast, behind them a lagoon with canals. There are plans for a presidential palace, a building for ministries, three universities, 15 skyscrapers, and 30,000 hotel rooms, about a third of which have been built. Some buildings that are already finished include the El Masa mosque, a huge mall, restaurants, and three movie theaters.
