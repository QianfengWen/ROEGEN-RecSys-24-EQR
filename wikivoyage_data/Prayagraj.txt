Prayagraj (pruh-yahg-rahj) is among the largest cities in Uttar Pradesh. Hindu mythology has it that for the Prakrishta Yajna, Lord Brahma, the creator God of the Hindu Trinity, chose a land on earth, on which the three rivers would flow in to a quiet confluence. Brahma also referred to it as Tirth Raj or the "king of all pilgrimage sites". Recorded evidence also exists in the Hindu scriptures (the Vedas and the grand epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, as also in the Puranas) of this holy place formerly called Prayag. Prayagraj stands at the confluence of two of India's holiest rivers, the Ganges and the Yamuna. Sangam, as the confluence is called, is the venue of many sacred fairs and rituals, and attracts thousands of pilgrims throughout the year. This number swells to millions during the Kumbh Mela. An annual Magh Mela is also held in Prayagraj around the Sangam areas in the month of January (Magh is the name of month in Hindu calendar). A third mythical Saraswati river, believed to flow underground towards the Sangam, gives the confluence its other name, Triveni.
Emperor Akbar renamed this city in 1575 and called it Illahabas, which turned into Allahabad. The monarch realised its strategic importance as a waterway landmark in North India and also built a magnificent fort on the banks of the holy Sangam.
Over the centuries that followed, the then-Allahabad remained on the forefront of national importance, especially during the days of the Indian independence struggle. The chequered history of Prayagraj with its religious, cultural and historical ethos also gave rise to several renowned scholars (M. N. Saha, Harishchandra, Ravindra Khattree, Amar Nath Jha), poets (Suryakant Tripathi Nirala, Mahadevi Verma, Harivansh Rai Bachchan, Sumitra Nandan Panth), writers (Mahadevi Verma, Ramkumar Verma, Jagdish Gupta), thinkers (Purusottam Das Tandon), statesmen and leaders (Motilal Nehru, Jawaharlal Nehru, Murli Manohar Joshi) and the actor Amitabh Bachchan.
The city, an important cantonment during the British Raj, has some beautiful remnants of colonial architecture. In the early 20th century, University of Allahabad was the foremost centre of learning in the country.  Prayagraj today is an important city where history, culture and religion create a confluence, much like the sacred rivers that caress it.
Prayagraj used to have a thriving industrial suburb (Naini) till the 1980s, but then those public sector units started closing down one by one, forcing entire generations of young educated Prayagrajis to migrate out of the city in search of work.  Today, Prayagraj is slowly inching along in its dream to be an IT hub.  And the government administrative offices remain alive and kicking.
In Prayagraj, you can enjoy:

The politeness of "ahp" (आप, literally "us") and "hum" (हम, literally "we"), used as a form of respect instead of the singular.
The subtle sense of humour of the person on the street.
The fun of walking and travelling on rickshaws.
Get in[edit]
The best way to reach Prayagraj, if you are coming from outside India, is to take a direct flight to Delhi and then take one of the numerous connecting trains from Delhi to Prayagraj.

By plane[edit]
25.4481.7338891 Prayagraj Airport (IXD  IATA), Bamrauli Field. Essentially a military base with a small civil enclave. Alliance Air has a flight to Delhi. IndiGo flies to Bangalore (with plans to start service to Mumbai). Baggage is hand delivered after arrival so wait in the terminal if you have checked luggage for it to be delivered.   (updated May 2023)
By train[edit]
Prayagraj is on the trunk train route from Delhi to Kolkata and from Mumbai to Kolkata, so it is well-connected by trains. Innumerable trains stop at Prayagraj.
There are several railway stations in the city, including 25.44624181.8288162 Prayagraj Junction , 25.4394181.84923 Prayagraj Rambagh , 25.46793981.8670814 Prayag Junction  and 25.44443281.8805625 Prayagraj Sangam Terminal.

The Howrah Rajdhani Express, though a better train, lands at a very odd hour in Prayagraj (11:43PM) from Delhi which can be inconvenient for Prayagraj being a really quiet place at night. The best train from Delhi to Prayagraj is the Prayag Raj Express which leaves from New Delhi at 9:30PM and arrives in Prayagraj at 6AM next day. The train runs every day.
The New Delhi–Prayagraj Duronto Express leaving Prayagraj for New Delhi on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays at 10:40PM and reaches New Delhi at 06:05AM the next day with number 2275. This is a non-stop service with AC1, AC2, AC3 and non-AC 3 Tier composition. Down service from New Delhi leaves on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays at 11:00PM and reaches Prayagraj at 06:20AM the next day with number 2276.

Get around[edit]
Hire a cyclerickshaw.  It is the cheapest, best and most widely available means of transport.  You will have to haggle for the prices, though.
Auto rickshaws (3-wheelers) are also cheap modes of travel inside the city.
City buses are available on certain routes but their arrivals and departures are unpredictable.

Do[edit]
 Boating and bathing at Sangam. A dip in the holy Sangam of the Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati is a must for the spiritually inclined. It is a sacred holy site for Hindus. According to Vedic literature and myths it is called Triveni Sangam because three rivers meet up here namely the holy Ganga, Yamuna and mythical Saraswati which is believed to be flowing beneath the surface. At the time of churning of sea (samudra manthana) by Gods (Devas) and the Demons (Asuras) few drops of amrita (holy nectar that makes a mortal immortal) fell at four different parts of the subcontinent during a fight between Gods and Demons over it. That places are Haridwar, Nashik, Prayag and Ujjain and are considered holy and Maha Kumbh Mela is organised once in 12 years. Millions of pilgrims, tourists, ascetics, sadhu/sant (holy men) visit Prayag at the time of month long Kumbha for taking holy dip at sangam and perform religious rituals and ceremonies. Also Magh Mela is organised annually on January–February (Magh month of the Hindu calendar) and millions visit to take holy dip at Sangam. 
 Take a dip at Sangam. Spiritual and refreshing. Sitting along the river banks and seeing the flowing water is also worth to be done. However sitting alone in aloof areas is risky for women and foreigners. Nagvasuki Ghat and Saraswati Ghat are suitable places for enjoying the serenity of river. Go at sunrise or after sunset to avoid crowds during Magh Mela. 
 Walk in the Magh/Kumbh Mela area. The days which are best to visit Prayagraj falls in the Hindu month of 'Magha'. A stroll in the make shift streets of Mela area is blissfully energizing. Be sure to keep a close watch on your purse/day-pack, not flash any cash or wear expensive jewellery to avoid being a target for theft.

Ramleela of Pattharchatti and Pajawa are worthy of seeing. Famous 'Kali dance' is organized in Daraganj in late nights of 4th, 5th and 6th days of Navratri.

During these days, Durga Puja is also celebrated by Bengali community which makes a major section of Prayagraj society. Puja pandals of Darbhanga colony and Jagat Taran College are the best places to enjoy the marvelous works of craftsmen of the city.

Kumbh Mela[edit]
Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, 2014
Kumbh Mela is the best time to immerse yourself in Hindu rituals and culture, organized once in every 12 years. 2001 Kumbh Mela became the largest ever human gathering in history when 80-90 million pilgrims converged.
Kumbh Mela is the biggest festival for Hindus, the date are written in the ancient holy Vedas. The festivals of Makar Sankranti, Mauni Amavasya and Basant Panchami are the most auspicious days when 'Shahi Snaana' are held. The dates are set according to the complex Hindu calendar and change every year.
Every year, a smaller version of Kumbh called Magh Mela is organised which falls during the Hindu month of Magha (Usually January or February). Magh Mela is an auspicious time to get married and Prayagraj will be bustling with marriage processions long into the night during this period.
The Kumbh area is a massive temporary settlement of tents at up on the flood plains of the Ganga and Yamuna rivers.
It is better to book the camps or hotels in advance as the number of visitors are unbelievably high and most regular accommodation sells out. Many Hindu families spend an entire month in rented tents, or in government tent camps where bunks can be booked for as little as 200IRP per night.
Getting around the camp:
The camp area was 40km long in 2019 and vehicles are generally banned (gurus and tourists on motorcycles are sometimes permitted). Ensure you know which sector your camp is in and arrive on the right edge or you could be forced to walk more than 10km.
There is generally no English signage, so asking police for directions may be your best option.
Temporary bridges across the river are generally one way, and the direction changes seemingly at random as police try to control the crowds.
For safety advice, see #Safety at Kumbh below.

Stay safe[edit]
Power outages are frequent so be prepared and carry a flashlight. Alleys are hard to navigate during the day, and even harder at night, so always be prepared. Sometimes you might run into a cow in an alley.
Women should dress conservatively and be very careful as sexual assaults, such as random gropings, can be common. Don't travel alone, especially in less populated areas.
Safety at Kumbh[edit]
Deadly stampedes during Kumbh are commonplace: the enormous crowds frequently panic and defy police. Be aware of your surroundings, especially around the train station, bridges and rivers' edge.
Basic sanitation is lacking in many areas. Pilgrims not using toilets, flooding, and lack of drainage make diarrhea outbreaks common. Drink and use only bottled water and bring anti-diarrhea medication.
Alcohol is strictly forbidden, as are glass bottles and glasses.

Cope[edit]
Knowing some basic Hindi and/or Urdu will help, although you can manage with English.
Be prepared to haggle with cyclerickshaw pullers (the best means of transport), for a short trip the price should be about ₹50, autorickshaws slightly less.
