Merritt Island is a city in the Space Coast region, home to Kennedy Space Center.


Understand[edit]
Get in[edit]
Merritt Island is about an hour from Downtown Orlando, but your only way to get to Merritt Island is to go via car as there is no public transportation available. From Orlando, there are two main highways you can use to enter Merritt Island:

Highway 528, which eventually becomes Highway A1A after crossing North Cocoa Boulevard.
Highway 50, which is a more northerly alternative to Highway 528 which becomes Highway 405 after passing the Space Coast Regional Airport and the NASA Causeway Bridge before entering the KSC Visitor Complex. If you do happen to take this route, look out for dolphins (if you're not driving) when traveling on the Causeway Bridge, as they can occasionally be seen, usually in the afternoons.
If you're getting around without a car, Uber drivers are often willing to do the drive up east, but taxi drivers often don't.
If you're coming from the south heading northbound on I-95, take Exit 205AB, while if you're traveling southbound on I-95, take Exit 205A.
