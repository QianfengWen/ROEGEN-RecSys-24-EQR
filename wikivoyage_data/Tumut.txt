Tumut is a town in the Snowy Mountains region of New South Wales, on the edge of the Riverina.


Understand[edit]

Tumut sits at an elevation of 300 meters on the northwest foothills of the Snowy Mountains, and is one of the gateways to that region.
The Snowy Mountains mostly consist of the high country, where elevations slowly rise up to around 1600 m at the alpine villages, with much of the area being a largely a plateau. The flat topped piece of ground rises only a few metres higher than the second highest "mountain" only a few kilometres away, and while the country is pretty, the vista is less than that you would get from the sandstone cliffs in the Blue Mountains.
The best place to get the mountain peak experience in the Snowies is on the Snowy Mountains highway between Tumut and Cooma. The roads wind through the mountains, and you can get some appreciation for the height of the peaks, and the drop on the side of the range.
