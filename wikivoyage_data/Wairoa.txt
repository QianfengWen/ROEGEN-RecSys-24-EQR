Wairoa is a town of 4,000 people in northern Hawke's Bay, New Zealand.


Understand[edit]
The town lies on both sides of the big Wairoa River, with the main part on the south bank. The bridge crossing the river is the third to be here – the last one was swept away by Cyclone Bola in 1988.A panorama of Wairoa showing the Wairoa River to the left

Do[edit]
-39.0338177.42481 Gaiety Theatre, 252 Marine Parade. Go to the fantastic restored theatre and watch a movie with one of the best sound systems in New Zealand. (updated Jan 2018)
Chase the wild birds on the Marine Parade. The marine parade isn't actually beside the sea, but it is where the river widens before forming a lagoon. All sorts of interesting stuff (100-year-old trees and the like) are washed down the river.
 Riverside walkway and cycleway. Runs 7.7 km from the lighthouse in the CBD along the south bank of the river to Whakamahia beach. The full walk takes an hour and a half, and biking takes 30 min. (updated Jan 2018)
 Sir James Carroll walkway. A 30-min walk along the north bank of the river opposite the CBD, starting from the bridge. (updated Jan 2018)
 Tramp Waikaremoana. Inland from Wairoa is Te Urewera (formerly a national park) and Lake Waikaremoana. If you like hiking or tramping,  this is a stunning walk that can be done in three to four days (or one if you run the whole way). Take all your supplies for the three or four days, including food, fuel, medical kits and toilet paper. (updated Feb 2022)
Buy[edit]
The town has four ATM machines. Many merchants in the surrounding region do not have EFTPOS, meaning you need to pay in cash. The town has a few boutique shops that are owner-operated and the town is virtually untouched by large chain stores.
