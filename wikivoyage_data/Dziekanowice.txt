Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
Independent travel to Dziekanowice seems to be quite challenging - there are just few daily connections to the village. There are 3 buses to Poznan, 4 to Gniezno and 2 to some other surrounding villages, which have no meaning for tourists. It's much easier to get to the bus stop Dziekanowice-skrzyzowanie (pol.: crossing) which is located at the main road number 5, but from there one must walk more than 1 km to the museum.

By train[edit]
Numerous connections (depending on the day - up to 14 daily) to Lednogora (34 km from Poznan and 17 from Gniezno, 38 and 17 minutes ride respectively), from where one must walk appr. 2km. It's essential to know, that accelerated and Inter-Regio trains do not stop at the station (that's why the number of connections to Lednogora is smaller than to Gniezno).

By bike[edit]
Cyclists can get in to Dziekanowice using a Piast Cycling Trail, starting in Poznan just next to the crossing of Jana Pawla str and Baraniaka str, nearby the shore of Malta Lake. cycling time (depending on speed and e.g. wind) 3-4 hours. An interesting option is to take your bike to train with you one way and come back by bike - all trains stopping at Lednogora are traditional electric trains with a big compartment for bikes.

By car[edit]
Use the country road number 5 from Gniezno or Poznan, turn northwards at the monument of three ancient knights toward the village and the Museum.
