Loikaw is the capital of the Kayah state (population 140,670 as of 2013) in Eastern Myanmar close to the Thai border.


Understand[edit]
Colourful clock tower
Formerly an administrative outpost of British Burma, Loikaw continues today as the administrative capital of the region with government and NGO offices, a hospital, and a nearby military base. The region is known for its many ethnic groups with the most famous being the Karenni people, especially the Kayan Lahwi/Padaung (women) with their golden brass neck coils that seem to stretch their neck (but actually cause a lower shoulder). You will see locals wearing traditional ethnic clothing, usually at the markets.
The geography around Loikaw consists of plains dotted by lakes surrounded by a multitude of densely forested hills. Agriculture and resource extraction are the main industries of the area. There is a large hydroelectric dam at Lawpita providing around 30% of the national electricity output.
Historically, this region was affected by decades of conflict. Various Karenni and Shan groups were in armed conflict with the central government and with each other until the 2012 ceasefire agreements in the state. Refugees from this conflict are present in Thailand and around the world. The largest Karenni organization in the area is the Karenni National Progressive Party (KNPP). You may be able to see offices and flags of these groups when you travel in the region.
Starting in the early 2010s, the area opened up and begun development for tourism. Travel to remote regions off the beaten track may still require permits. A guide is recommended to help with navigation and safety. The state is heavily mined due to the prior conflict.

Most of the town can be covered on foot. Surrounding temples and villages are easy by bicycle if you are comfortable with traffic on busy roads. Alternatively, a tuktuk or taxi can be hired. Local buses travel the main road. Ticket prices are based on distance.
To reach sights further away from Loikaw, a hired private car is recommended due to the remoteness of some of the sights and the lack of public transport options. Reaching areas off the highways may necessitate a 4x4 vehicle due to dirt roads. The monsoon season will also impair any travel to these areas due to its effect on dirt roads.
