Stay safe[edit]
Kragujevac is generally a very safe city. It is one of the safest Serbian cities overall. Take the usual precautions and common sense (such as don't walk in parks alone at 03:00, don't leave your wallet, camera and mobile unattended) and you will most likely not encounter any crime at all. Do not get into conflict with locals after staying out late in the city, especially if they seem aggressive or drunk. Avoid sport fan groups of local team Radnički (djavoli or devils), they tend to be drunk and aggressive. Being a foreigner will not get you into any trouble, just do not show off, but try to make a local friendship instead.
