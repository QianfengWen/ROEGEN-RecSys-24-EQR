Fort Bragg is an isolated town of 7,000 people (2020) on California's North Coast. It serves as the economic hub of the area despite the demise of its historic logging and fishing industries at the end of the 20th century. 
Long regarded as the "Beast" to the neighboring village of Mendocino's "Belle," it has slowly been shedding its inhospitable, blue-collar reputation and begun to warm to the new reality of a tourism-based economy with art galleries, microbreweries and gastropubs of its own. In several aspects it has already eclipsed the appeal of Mendocino as a tourist destination, as being an order of magnitude larger in population grants it the ability to support several beloved American franchises like Starbucks, McDonald's, Best Western and Motel 6, suddenly making vacations to the Lost Coast accessible to those whose budget scoffs at the minimum $300/night lodging costs of its southern sibling. Its population rises to 14,800 (2018) when including the adjacent unincorporated area, increasingly dominated by retirees and vacation rental operators.

History[edit]
Nestled between the chaotic peaks and valleys formed during ~200 million years of one tectonic plate demanding another give way, and sandwiched between the planet's largest ocean and largest temperate rainforest lies Fort Bragg. 15,000 years ago, at the end of the last ice age, the first indigenous inhabitants, the Hokan, found it and called it home, amazed at the scale of nearly everything they saw. The trees averaged nearly 200 feet in height and 15 feet in diameter, the result of being among the oldest living things anywhere and an extremely mild climate with average annual rainfall over 100 in (2,500 mm). Among them lived elk almost as big as a moose, Olympic black bears, cougars and timber wolves in practically boundless number, fed by the lush, verdant terrain and the fish found teeming in the rivers as much as in the mighty Pacific. Millenia passed like this, so long that the Hokan as well became so abundant that they gave rise to three great Native American nations, the Yuki, Pomo, and Wintun. It was they who saw the first Europeans weigh anchor just off the coast in 1542, representatives of the Spanish Empire. After the Spaniards came the English, then the Russians, and eventually the Americans, but the landscape remained a testament to a grandeur almost always reserved for legends. Valiant efforts were made to exploit each natural resource many times, but the difficulty of transporting goods and people over endless rugged hills and rivers always won out. That's how it earned the nickname The Lost Coast, a place forgotten through the Gold Rush, the Industrial Revolution, and the rise of Silicon Valley, still wild and ready to bewitch all who brave the journey there.
Fort Bragg is the largest town on the Lost Coast, a position of honor nearly guaranteed by the grace of having the largest natural harbor for over 100 miles (160 km) in either direction. On today's maps it is seen to lie within the borders of Mendocino County, named for Antonio de Mendoza, the Viceroy of New Spain who had sent that ship full of Spaniards sailing north up the California coast in 1542.

By car or motorcycle[edit]
Two state highways, California Routes 1 and 20, are the sole safe conduits for vehicle travel to the area. Route 1 serves as Fort Bragg's Main Street and widens to two lanes in each direction with a center turn lane while it's within the city limits. Route 20 carries the vast majority of locals and visitors in and out of the area and is almost always referred to as the "Willits Road" by locals rather than its official number. Many long-time residents are quick to remind anyone who will listen that in "their day" it was still a winding dirt road unfit for use by anything but pickup trucks. The addition of the paved road surface was done in stages as CalTrans funds became available starting in 1958 and was completed in 1964, shortly thereafter being added to the state highway system as the final leg of the "Ukiah-Tahoe Highway" as Route 20 was then known.
Factoring in the other state highways that merge into or intersect one of them, there are a total of five potential routes by which to visit if you're travelling by automobile or motorcycle. All are entirely two-lane state highways devoid of artificial illumination with posted speeds of 55 mph (89 km/h), average quality pavement the entire way, and lead to an eventual junction with U.S. Highway 101. If you're not coming from somewhere with obvious access to U.S. 101 any route planning should begin with determining how you'll first reach that thoroughfare. Listed with starting points from north to south the five routes to Fort Bragg are:

A truly exhausting drive: it barely meets the state minimum highway width of 25ft for much of its length, with non-stop <20 mph turns (many of which are blind and/or banked contrary to good road design), and can often be engulfed in a fog bank that arrives without warning and regularly places you just a hard sneeze away from an over 100 ft (30 m) plunge into the ocean, since of course there are no guardrails. When the wise make this journey, they stop often, budget an entire day's time for the trip, and tag in a fresh driver whenever possible. The stress sneaks up on you.The reward for your bravery if you come this way is an exceptionally unique stretch of road, combining spectacular vistas with ample waypoints that offer phenomenal recreation and amenities for such a remote locale (e.g. golf in Bodega Bay & Sea Ranch, EV charging station in Elk, a historic movie theater in Pt. Arena, and brand new casino in Stewarts Point) that can easily fill the journey with delight sans any genuine "destination."

Nicknamed the "Skunk Train" because it ran on gasoline engines (rather than diesel), with the corresponding odor of long-chain hydrocarbons washing over most of the town center when it would open the throttle to build momentum for departure. While the railroad attempts to finance the tunnel's reconstruction, rentals of "railbikes" are offered allowing patrons to pedal (with electric assist) 3.5 miles along the track from the Fort Bragg depot and back in guided groups safely.

Events[edit]
California gray whale feeding just off the bluff
It began long before the memory of mankind, but the sea remembers when the first pods of California gray whales arrived at the shores of the Eastern Pacific, some 130,000 years ago, give or take a few. An especially ponderous species that lived over 60 years on average and occasionally more than 80, they were seldom in a hurry. Like all descendants of the first filter-feeder whales that first evolved 30 million years ago, they fed on the tiny crustaceans that fill the oceans, but unlike their ancestors the California grays could feed successfully at any depth, from the pitch blackness of the muddy bottom to the sun-kissed whitecaps dancing on the surface the gray whale was at the buffet table. They very quickly fell into a comfortable rhythm, spending the summers off the Alaskan coast gorging on the infinite types of tiny shrimp that stampede through the shallow water close to shore every year at that time. As summer turned to autumn and the shrimp became less plentiful they would migrate south at their usual languid pace, living off the sea lice and sandhoppers that know no season on the ocean bottom along the route following the coastlines of British Columbia and going past California on their way to the ideal calving grounds at which to spend the winters: the crystal blue waters off Baja California, Mexico.
The water temperature there wasn't so punishing to the new mothers, who barely have time to feed as they turn their fat reserves from shrimp buffet into 50-80 pounds of milk daily for each calf. Humans have only been around to bear witness to them for the last 14,000 years or so, and there's no doubt they took notice then as keenly they still do in Fort Bragg each March at the Whale Festival that coincides with the most frequent sightings of gray whale pods (those without newborns in tow leave first and travel at a more consistent speed thus staying more tightly grouped) headed back to Alaska to start the cycle over again.

39.44568-123.804211 Fort Bragg Whale Festival (Mendocino Coast Whale Festivals): Annually on the third Saturday of March, ending the following day, 213 E Laurel St, ☏ +1 707-961-6300, chamber4@mcn.org. 10AM-5PM.  The celebration in Fort Bragg at the Whale Festival has settled into its own comfortable rhythm, always starting with the 5-km Fun Run in the morning along the bluffs where the original lumber mill once was, building the appetite for the year's entrants in Sunday's Chowder Cook-off to regale the festival goers with their masterpieces for lunch, washed down with local brews. What follows is an afternoon of wine tasting hosted by the downtown merchants in their establishments. At any time patrons are encouraged to stroll the two blocks west from downtown to the bluffs and watch the waves for more of the telltale plumes of water as the whale's spout, and with any luck you'll happen to be present to see one breaching, an explosion of water so violent it looks like a bomb detonating in the water. The following day things wind down with a crafts fair and classic car show, both again held downtown, accompanied by more wine and tasty morsels. The festival wasn't always so laid back but over the years it became obvious that to try and compete with the combination of a quaint, rustic downtown two blocks away from an all-day show put on by the whales was truly a fool's errand; everyone seems much happier now that the whales are allowed to be the star of the show. $40/day per person, $35 presale.

Splurge[edit]
39.44541-123.805021 Cucina Verona Ristorante and Mercato, 124 East Laurel St (Take Main Street to the California Western Railroad (Skunk Train) depot where it intersects with Laurel Street. Turn east on Laurel and the restaurant is just half a block away on the south side of the street, just past Headlands Coffeehouse and across Pippi Longstockings.), ☏ +1 707-964-6844, eat@cucinaverona.com. Daily 11AM-3PM, 5-9PM. Extremely cozy and friendly little trattoria, smack-dab in the literal epicenter of the Downtown Business District. Space is at a premium both inside and out on the heated patio, though, so those looking to decompress with a leisurely meal after an afternoon hike will likely need to look elsewhere. Those that don't mind some tight quarters plus hustle & bustle to experience the tastiest Mediterranean cuisine in town need look no further: all the pizzas are fresh and vibrant, scallops and swordfish headline the magnificent seafood options, and all of the classic pasta fare is just like Momma used to make. Stick to beer and wine, though... the cocktails are underwhelming, as is the bar they're served from. ~$35/dinner entrée. (updated May 2022)
39.44759-123.80572 KW Saltwater Grill, 542 North Main St (follow Main Street through town until you get to the crossing for the train tracks (Skunk Train), the restaurant is only 25 feet south of them, on the east side of the street), ☏ +1 707-900-1667, kwsaltwatergrill2021@gmail.com. Tu–F 5–9PM, Sa Su 5–9:30PM (closed M). This is a different experience from most anything else in Fort Bragg, feeling more like some of the tiny, chic boutique restaurants that dot the coast around Albion and further south. The bill of fare is ultra-premium, "spare no expense" (literally) and handily meets all those expectations, yet the atmosphere inside is like a cross between an ill friend's bedroom and the reading room at your local library: hushed and calm, yet somehow exceedingly warm and inviting. The wine list is no joke either, though at these prices, it needs to be. The menu is almost totally seafood, but fear not, the few terrestrial protein dishes are just as strikingly delicious.. ~$45/dinner entrée. (updated May 2022)

39.44592-123.805776 Mayan Fusion, 418 North Main St, ☏ +1 707-961-0211. Daily 11AM-9PM. Many of the town's Latino residents hail from the Yucatan peninsula, including the owner of Mayan Fusion. Quite different from other Mexican cuisines, they are liberal with many kinds of citrus and spice. Often busy but wait times are seldom overlong. (updated Jun 2019)

Budget[edit]
39.44163-123.799011 Colombi Studios & Suites, 647 East Oak St, ☏ +1 707-964-5773, colombibiz@hotmail.com. Check-in: 3PM, check-out: 11AM. This place is like staying with relatives while on vacation: not all that comfortable, no tolerance of shenanigans of any sort, and if you want something done best to do it yourself. However, like family, this place will always have a few rooms available for you even if you drive here on a whim for on a summer weekend with no reservation and learn that, like the baby Jesus, there's no room for you at the inn you'd hoped to stay at. Have no fear, Mama Colombi will fluff a pillow for you and tell you to come in, relax and offer to make you a sandwich at her grocery store across the street. (updated Jul 2019)
Mid-range[edit]
39.45801-123.805922 Best Western Vista Manor Lodge, 1100 North Main St, ☏ +1 707-964-4776, toll-free: +1-800-780-7234, fax: +1-707-964-4779. Check-in: 3PM, check-out: 11AM. No pets allowed and too far from town to walk anywhere but very safe and extremely professional staff. (updated Jul 2019)

Newest hotel in town and fantastic amenities but sadly no view to speak of and less than 300 yards from the intersection of the only two highways serving the area, in fact less than 30 feet from the shoulder of one of them. (Read: You will hear every police car, fire truck and ambulance with sirens blaring, up close and personal, on their way to every emergency call in a 20-mi radius, to say nothing of the omnipresent bikers that flock to the area to cruise its endless winding roads.) If you're a sufficiently deep sleeper/lifelong city dweller such that the noise won't drive you mad, and you care more about a clean room with fast WiFi and breakfast in the lobby than an ocean view then look no further, you want to be here.

Healthy pets[edit]
Fort Bragg is generally a very safe place to bring your pet to experience. The climate is too cool to support the more notorious threats such as rattlesnakes, scorpions and the like. If you take Fido out and about with you, however, you do need to keep him from sampling the local flora unsupervised, as both ivy and azaleas/rhododendrons are thoroughly ubiquitous throughout both the natural landscape and local gardens and are known to cause potentially severe distress to dogs who ingest them. Furthermore the proximity of wild animals (bears, mountain lions, possums, raccoons, foxes, and many more) to all of the human-inhabited parts of the area produces an indomitable population of common fleas and ticks looking for their next meal. As of 2019, many residents find that the fleas/ticks are quite impervious to the more common over-the-counter treatments such as fipronil (Frontline), imidacloprid (Advantage/Advantix) and permethrin (BioSpot), requiring prescription treatments to gain any leverage over. If your dog is prone to sensitive skin or does not tolerate fleas/ticks well, you may want to reconsider his accompanying you.
Fort Bragg has four veterinary clinics, all of which are relatively "full-service" considering the nearest proper veterinary hospital is over two hours away in Santa Rosa. Three of the four have a memorandum of understanding that arranges for the staff of one to handle all of the emergency calls that come in during the weekend regardless of who regularly sees the pet. The fourth, Covington Creek, has a single veterinarian who takes their own weekend emergency calls and usually arranges for a visiting veterinarian to come to the area and do so in the event they need to travel out of the area.

39.41246-123.757959 Covington Creek Veterinary Hospital, 30303 State Highway 20 (3 mi (4.8 km) east of town on Highway 20, 0.5 mi (0.80 km) past Leisure Time RV Park on the right-hand side), ☏ +1 707-964-6109, Info@CovingtonVet.com​. M-F 9AM-5PM. Equipped for dentistry, anesthesia and surgery, on-site radiology (X-rays) and electrocardiography (EKGs) as well as in-house lab analysis. Can board animals on request.
