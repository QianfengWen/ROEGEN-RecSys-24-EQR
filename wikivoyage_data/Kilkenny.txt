Kilkenny[dead link] is the county town of County Kilkenny in southeast Ireland, with a population of 26,512 in 2016. At its core is the medieval city founded by the Normans, and in the 1640s it was effectively the capital of Ireland. It's a lively small city with a rich cultural heritage and lots of visitor facilities, mostly on the west bank of the River Nore. 


Understand[edit]
Kilkenny Castle seen from Rose Garden
Kilkenny in Irish is Cill Chainnigh, the church of Cainnech or Canice (515-600 AD), and the first settlement grew up in the 6th century around what is now St Canice Cathedral. It was seized by the Normans in 1170, led by Richard de Clare or "Strongbow"; he built the fortress which became the castle. The ford across the River Nore was replaced by a bridge and medieval Kilkenny developed as three districts each protected by their own walls: High Town around the castle, Irish Town around the cathedral, and St Johns on the east bank of the river.  
The English Tudors strengthened their grip on Ireland by "plantations" - colonies of loyal English and Scots (mostly Protestant) to keep the natives in check. Irish resentment flared into rebellion in 1641. Rebellion was crushed in Dublin and Ulster but gained strength elsewhere, and led to the de facto state of Confederate Ireland. This controlled two-thirds of the country, and Kilkenny was its capital. It had a governing Assembly, minted coins and levied taxes; it was continuously at war but backed with money and weapons by friendly Catholic nations, especially by the Pope. Nominally however it was not independent, but Royalist in support of the deposed King Charles I. In 1650 a man called Oliver Cromwell arrived outside the city walls of Kilkenny to discuss the finer constitutional points of this stance, and when he'd done discussing, the walls and city were rubble and Ireland wasn't a Confederacy any more.
The city was rebuilt, with the castle becoming an ornamental "chateau", and 18th / 19th century industries developed such as brewing, textiles and dairy-processing. Many buildings were faced with "Kilkenny Marble", a dark grey limestone quarried locally, which takes a polish. The place was little disturbed in later conflicts; the railway arrived in 1848, and the beginnings of tourism. This focuses on the "Medieval Mile" between castle and cathedral, and the castle stables have been converted into arts and craft shops.
Although Kilkenny is the county town, it's a shibboleth to refer to it as a "town". It has a cathedral and King James I proclaimed it a city in 1609, but there's no distinction under modern local government legislation. Kilkenny's interesting mix of old and new means that it does indeed feel like a compact city rather than a large town.
52.6514-7.25151 Kilkenny TIC, 79A High St R95 F640, ☏ +353 56 775 1500. The Tourist Office is itself historic - it's in Shee Alms House, founded in 1582. It cared for 12 homeless people, and (with a long break in the Cromwellian period) remained in use until 1830. It was then a chapel, hospital and shop, before being restored to its original Tudor appearance and becoming the TIC in 1981.  (updated Mar 2021)

Walk is the best way to get around this compact city; see "Do" for walking tours. You need wheels for outlying sights such as Kells Priory, Dunmore Cave and Gowran racetrack. There are cycle paths on the main roads within the city, and designated lock-up points in the centre. 
Kilkenny doesn't have a Park & Ride so bringing a car here means looking for parking. Car parks just off High Street are Ormonde Street multi-storey near its south end, and Market Cross north on Parliament St. There's also Market Yard near John's Bridge, and Park Rite garage by the railway station.
By bus: City Direct operate two cross-city bus routes, both daily every 30-60 min:

KK1 runs north-south, from N77 roundabout in the north via city centre and railway station to Loughboy Retail Park south.
KK2 runs east-west, from Purcellsinch east via city centre and railway station to St Luke's Hospital west.
The cash fare (as of March 2021) is €2 adult and €1.20 child; by TFI Leap Card it's €1.40 adult and 84c child.
Route maps, including stop locations, are posted on the TFI website.
Taxis are available throughout the city, with ranks at the railway station and many other spots.
Fares are nationally regulated and taxis must use the meter. As of March 2021, fares M-Sa 08:00 to 20:00 are €3.80 flagfall then €1.14-1.50 per km, 20:00 to 08:00 and Sunday €4.20 flagfall then €1.45-1.80 per km. In slow traffic or if asked to wait they charge by the minute, 40-50 cents. The main operators are Martin Butler Kilkenny Taxi (+353 87 7777 677) and Sevens Taxi (+353 56 777 7777).
Useful to know when trying to hail one in a downpour: Saint Fiacre of Breuil (600 – 670) probably governed his first monastery nearby at Bennetsbridge, before moving to France, becoming the patron saint of taxi-drivers, and giving his name to the fiacre carriage.

Canal Square
City centre[edit]
Most sights are along the "Medieval Mile" from The Parade (Kilkenny Castle & Design Centre), up High St (Tholsel, Hole in the Wall & Medieval Mile Museum), onto Parliament St (Rothe House & Smithwicks Brewery) and into Irishtown (St Canice's Cathedral).

52.6507-7.24911 Kilkenny Castle, The Parade R95 YRK1, ☏ +353 56 770 4100. Daily 09:30-17:00. Splendid Norman castle, built from 1195 to control the river ford, and the powerbase of the Butler dynasty. It was restored in the 19th century, so the interiors are mostly Victorian. You can self-tour, or for an extra €4 join the guided tour. Self-tour adult €8, conc €6, child free.   (updated Feb 2021)
The Castle Gardens are an extensive woodland park, free to stroll anytime. The canal is their northern boundary, another pleasant strolling area. This was built from 1755 to bypass a non-navigable stretch of the river but was never completed.
 National Design & Craft Centre, Castle Yard, Parade Gardens (opposite Castle), ☏ +353 56 772 2118, info@kilkennydesign.com. W-Sa 11:00-17:00, Su 12:00-17:00. Craft gallery within the elegant former stables of the castle, built 1800. Rotating exhibitions, they don't have a permanent collection. The stables block also houses a foodhall and restaurant, see Eat. Free. (updated Feb 2021)
Butler House on Patrick St near the castle is now an upscale hotel, see Sleep.
52.6539-7.25762 Black Abbey, Abbey St. Founded in 1225, this impressive Dominican Abbey became a courthouse after the Dissolution then was wrecked by Cromwell. It was rebuilt from 1866 and remains an active RC church, with beautiful stained glass windows. It was built just outside the city walls in order to serve both the Anglo-Norman and the Irish districts. Some 200 m east along Abbey St / Sráid Na Mainistreach is Black Freren Gate, the last surviving gate of those walls. Free.   (updated Jan 2023)
52.6543-7.25463 Rothe House & Garden, 15–16 Parliament St R95 P89C, ☏ +353 56 772 2893. Tu-Su 11:00-18:00. Well-preserved Tudor merchant's home built between 1594 and 1610. It comprises three houses, three cobbled courtyards and a half-acre restored Tudor garden. It stands on a "burgage plot," a long narrow strip of rented land, and houses Kilkenny Archaeological Society's history museum and archive library. Adult €7.50, conc €6.50, child free.   (updated Feb 2021)
NOT EXISTING LISTING IMAGE Smithwick's Experience, 44 Parliament St R95 VK54 (opposite Rothe House), ☏ +353 56 778 6377. Daily Mar-Oct 10:00-18:00, Nov-Feb 11:00-17:00. Guided tour of the former brewery, usually on the hour. It may have been Ireland's first, as Franciscan monks brewed here from 1221 to 1537 when the monastery was dissolved (no, not in the beer). John Smithwick founded his brewery here in 1705, but his ownership had to be kept quiet until 1782 when Catholics were again allowed to own property. It remained a family firm until 1964 then was taken over by Guinness, now part of Diageo, and other beers in their range were for a time brewed here. The brewery closed in 2013 and became the council offices and courtrooms, but a small part of it has been turned into this visitor centre. Smithwick's Ales are now brewed in Dublin. Adult €13 (online €11.70), child €7.   (updated Feb 2021)
The Courthouse on Parliament St (opposite Rothe House) is built over "Grace's Old Castle" of 1210. That was owned by the powerful de Gras, later Grace, family and morphed into a residence and later the county jail and courtroom. It was still in use as the town "nick" or bridewell until 1946, and today houses the Circuit and District Courts. Just admire the exterior, you can't go in unless you're already in trouble.
52.6563-7.25774 St Canice's Cathedral & Round Tower, Coach Rd, Irishtown R95 V63H, ☏ +353 56 776 4971. M-Sa 10:00-18:00, Su 13:00-18:00. This C of I cathedral was built as a catholic cathedral, caved in and was rebuilt in the 13th century, but the 9th century Round Tower indicates its much longer history. It's Ireland's second-largest church, surpassed only by Dublin's St Patrick's, of similar date and style. Cromwell trashed it through force of habit and used it as stables for his horses, but it was rebuilt from the 19th century, retaining many medieval features. The tower, outside in the graveyard, can be ascended by adults up steep ladders. Tower adult €6.   (updated Feb 2021)
52.655-7.2595 St Canice's Church, Dean St, Irishtown. This RC church has a lovely facade and was built by 1827. (updated Feb 2021)
52.6525-7.25676 St Mary's Cathedral, James St. This is the Roman Catholic cathedral for the city, built 1842-57 in limestone in English Gothic style. It's on the highest point in the city so its tower is a prominent landmark.   (updated Feb 2021)
The Tholsel on High Street
52.652-7.2537 Tholsel, High St. This arcaded structure built in 1761 is the town hall. Look out for the city's coat of arms over the lowest arch. A tholsel was a tolls hall, a mix of tax collection, courtroom, guildhall and city chambers. They're almost unique to Ireland and only a handful are intact.   (updated Feb 2021)
The Slips are the medieval alleys perpendicular to High Street. The best example is Butter Slip next to the Tholsel, leading down to St Kieran's St. Built in 1616, it was the market for butter vendors.
The Hole in the Wall is an arts venue and former tavern within a 1582 townhouse, occasionally open for tours. It's off High St facing St Mary's Lane, just south of the Tholsel.
 Medieval Mile Museum, 2 St Mary's Lane (off High St behind Tholsel), ☏ +353 56 781 7022. Daily 10:00–18:00. Modern museum within the former St Mary's Church, built 1205, displays medieval / Renaissance sculpture and tombs. Adult €7. (updated Feb 2021)
52.6479-7.25298 Talbot Tower built in 1207 is the only remaining bastion of the city walls. It's been restored but you can't go in. It's on Lower New St, corner with Ormonde Rd.
52.6469-7.255569 St Kieran's College was founded in 1782 at what is now St Mary's Cathedral; the present grand Gothic building on College Rd was erected 1811-45. It was a seminary until 1994 and is now a secondary school. The buildings are private but you can admire the exterior.
52.6541-7.246510 Church of St John the Evangelist, Dublin Rd. Daily 08:00-18:00. Ornate RC church in Gothic Revival style, completed in 1908. It has a soaring interior but the frontage is curiously stubby, as the tower never acquired its second stage and spire.   (updated Mar 2021)
52.6537-7.248511 St John's Priory, John St (corner of Michael St). The abbey or priory was founded in 1220 by the Augustinians, with the Lady Chapel added in 1290. They must have been a colourful bunch, experiencing jail, excommunication and structural collapse long before the Dissolution. The priory fell derelict in the 18th century, and much of it was demolished in 1780, with the stone re-cycled into a barracks. The Church of Ireland (Protestant) took over the site in 1817, re-roofed the Lady Chapel and created a parish church, which remains active. In the grounds are the ruins of the 13th century former chapel, with tombs and carvings.   (updated Mar 2021)
52.6525-7.247912 County Hall, John St. This fine seven-bay, three-storey Georgian building was built in 1782 to house a school, replacing a building of 1667. It suffered a serious fire in 1980: the school later moved away to modern premises and since 1994 it's been the county admin offices. Just admire the exterior unless you're here to lodge a planning application or complain about the rural rubbish bin collections.   (updated Mar 2021)
52.652646-7.24469513 Maudlin Tower, 30 Maudlin St R95 Y8NE. This tall tower was built in the early 16th century to guard a hospital, founded circa 1327 a little distance from the city. There were high walls and gated access to keep patients in and the hoi-polloi out, because this was a leper-hospital. Leprosy, now called Hansen's disease, did (and still does) occur in Ireland but the term was a catch-all for any disfiguring and potentially contagious chronic disease. The biggest threat was Black Death - plague - but that killed swiftly. So you might find yourself cooped up here with a bad bout of scabies, psoriasis or syphilis. Some inmates enjoyed rich furnishings and diet, and perhaps were members of important families who'd become embarrassing in their dotage. The hospital had its own farm, and was associated with St John's Priory, but abandoned at the Dissolution. The tower is well-preserved but there's no interior access, and the rest of the hospital has gone.   (updated Mar 2021)
Further out[edit]
Dunmore Cave
52.733928-7.246914 Dunmore Cave, Castlecomer Rd, Dunmore R95 A972 (11 km north of Kilkenny off N78), ☏ +353 56 776 7726, dunmorecaves@opw.ie. Daily Mar-May, Oct 09:30-17:00, Jun-Sept 09:30-18:00, Nov-Feb 09:30-15:00. Show cave in an outcrop of Lower Carboniferous limestone, about 400 m in extent and descending 46 m. It's richly decorated with calcite formations, the most ornate being the 6 m "Market Cross". By guided tour only. The cave was the site of a massacre by the Vikings in 928 AD, according to The Annals of the Four Masters written 700 years later. Many human remains have indeed been found here, mostly women and children, plus a hoard of silver and bronze dated to 970 AD. Adult €5, conc €4, child €3.   (updated Mar 2021)
52.731159-7.28884915 Jenkinstown Park (10 km north of Kilkenny, enter via N78 or N77). Car park daily 09:30-17:00. The forested park is a nice place for a walk or a picnic; it's muddy after wet weather and the deer expect to be fed. In April the forest is carpeted by bluebells. It was laid out in the 1870s as the grounds of the Bryan-Bellew Estate, and some original trees survive. Most of the castle has been demolished, but a few scraps remain, with some remnants incorporated into a modern mansion. Thomas Moore (1779-1852) wrote the poem The Last Rose of Summer while staying at Jenkinstown House in 1805. This was the forerunner of a wave of traditional Irish melodies given English lyrics, as popular as it was maudlin, with dozens of settings, literary references and translations. Japanese schoolchildren dutifully learned it as Niwa-no-Chigusa (庭の千草), "The Plants in the Garden". Free.   (updated Mar 2021)
52.658-7.43416 Tullaroan has the ruins of a medieval church. It's 14 km west of the city.
52.6-7.18317 Bennettsbridge is a village 6 km south of the city where the main sight is the bridge itself, built early 19th century. There is a loop walk called Gorman's Loop signposted from the church side of the village (across the bridge coming from Kilkenny).
52.538-7.26718 Kells Priory, Kellsborough (10 km south of Kilkenny), ☏ +353 56 772 8255. 24 hours. This Augustinian Priory founded in 1193 is one of the most intact in Ireland, not least because it was fortified with stout walls and towers after two or three destructions. Most of the remains are within the inner monastic precinct; beyond, Burgess Court is the walled field which today holds sheep, as it probably did back then. There's parking right by the priory but it's more attractive to approach along the riverside from Mullin's Mills. This isn't the place with the beautifully decorated Book of Kells - that's in County Meath and the Book is in TCD Library, Dublin. "Kells" or "Kil-" indicates the cell or abode of a monk, which would later become the site of a church and settlement, so it's a common placename. Free.   (updated Mar 2021)
Kilree 2 km south of Kells Priory has a Round Tower and High Cross.
52.55-7.38333319 Callan has a Norman Motte-and-bailey and the ruin of an Augustinian Friary. 500 m west of village centre on R695 is the childhood home of Edmund Rice, founder of the Christian Brothers. It's open M-F 10:00-17:00, Sa 10:00-14:00. Find more of his legacy in Waterford.
52.63-7.06520 Gowran is a little village 10 km east of Kilkenny. The main sight is St Mary's Collegiate Church, part ruin, part restored and in use. It was founded in 1312 over a pre-Christian site - the Ogham stone is 3rd / 4th century. A "collegiate church" doesn't have a permanent priest, but staff at the seminary take turns. Gowran Castle dates from 1713 and was restored in 2013, it's a private residence. Gowran Park is a racecourse 500 m south of the village, with both flat racing and National Hunt.

But it's best known as the home of Alice Kyteler (1263-13??), one of the first people in Europe to be accused of witchcraft - most persecutions came 300 years later. She was the daughter of Flemish merchants, and her husbands kept dying on her, while her wealth mysteriously grew. However those accusations of foul play came way down the charge sheet, which listed all sort of diabolical hocus-pocus. Her most shocking alleged deeds involved a manifestation of the devil called Robin Artisson, quendam demonem incubum concubuisse cum ea, which you can really only get away with in Galway or Gomorrah. She may have been a pawn in a power struggle between secular and church jurisdiction, in which the church prevailed by torturing her servant Petronella into a confession. Kyteler fled to England and disappeared, so (not to waste a good confession) Petronella was burnt at the stake instead. (updated Mar 2021)
