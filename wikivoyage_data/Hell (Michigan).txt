Hell is a town of 266 people (as of 2000) in Livingston County, in Southeast Michigan, best known for... well, its name. Despite its small size — the "main drag" of Hell is all of three buildings — the community has become a popular tourist destination for its irreverent name alone. The local businesses are given amusingly devilish titles, painted with licking flames, and stocked with gruesome and kitschy souvenirs of the sort you usually only see around Halloween. Every so often you'll hear of a nationwide promotional contest in which the prize is "a trip to Hell".


Understand[edit]
The area was first settled by Europeans in 1838 by George Reeves, who owned a mill and general store. No-one is quite sure how the community got its name; one theory is that a pair of German travellers, upon disembarking in the hilly area, amused the locals by proclaiming it to be "So schön und hell", meaning so bright and beautiful. Another is that the swampy area was a good breeding ground for mosquitoes, and the traders canoeing through the area had a few choice words for their attackers. The third, and most widely believed, is that when the local officials asked what his settlement should be called, Reeves (possibly having overheard those German visitors) replied, "I don't care, you can name it Hell if you want to." Evidently, the name stuck.
One popular photograph depicts a wintertime town sign draped in icicles ("when Hell freezes over", which is also "a cold day in Hell"), and of course the community was kept massively busy on June 6, 2006, when most items were sold for $6.66. Hell was also the inspiration for a comic book entitled Hell, Michigan — created by Tilman Goins from Morristown, Tennessee — which chronicles the fictional residents' attempts to fight the demonic evil of their town. As an added attraction, visitors to Hell can buy a pass to become mayor for a day at a rate of around $100-110, at this website[dead link]. Elijah Daniel, a popular comedian, rapper, and author, purchased this pass for August 30, 2017. He posted on Twitter about it and gained over 34,000 "likes". This spread lots of awareness about the town, with people from all over wanting to experience this extraordinary little town. 
In 2015, the town of Hell was listed for sale at a price of $900,000. After nearly eight years on the market, the Phone Up Studios, Inc., acquired the town in December 2023. The sale marked the culmination of an extended period of real estate availability for Hell, resulting in a change of ownership and potential future developments under the stewardship of the acquiring company.
Aside from its fire-and-brimstone appeal, Hell is situated in the middle of the lovely Pinckney State Recreation Area. A short drive away from the village will bring you to lakes, rivers and forests for hiking, horseback riding, swimming, canoeing, kayaking and fishing.

Get in[edit]

Hell is on a two-lane county road D-32 (Patterson Lake Road), about 5 minutes southwest of Pinckney; despite the saying, the road is paved with asphalt. The nearest major road is US-23 between Flint and Ann Arbor; from US-23, take MI-36 west to Pinckney, make a left on Dexter-Pinckney Rd., and then a right on Patterson Lake Road.

Get around[edit]
Given that downtown Hell is so small, you won't need anything more than your own two legs to get around. There's ample free parking by the general store and the ice cream parlor.

The non-denominational wedding chapel, enabling couples to tie the knot in Hell, for $66.  Clergy not included; BYO or arrangements can be made with a local pastor. (Apparently, April Fool's Day is a popular time of year, and one couple opted for a cold day in Hell to finally make their vows.)
