Skagway is a town with a population of less than a thousand in Southeastern Alaska.  It is the northern terminus of the Alaska Marine Highway System. It sprang up during the Klondike Gold Rush of 1896-1899, and now subsists almost entirely on tourism.  The historical interest and natural beauty of the area make it a worthwhile place to visit.

An out-and-back day trip offers great views as the train snakes along the sides of mountains overlooking the river far below; although it goes into Canada, passports aren't required because you don't get off the train.
