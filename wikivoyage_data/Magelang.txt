-7.6057110.18052 The Chicken Church (Gereja Ayam) (on Punthuk Setumbu Hill). 05:00-16:30. A chicken-shaped church with a peculiar history. In response to what he claimed was a divine vision in 1988, Daniel Alamsjah, a devout Christian spent every weekend over nearly a decade overseeing the construction of this multi-dominical bird-shaped prayer house. Alamsjah’s vision had been of a dove, but the its resemblance to a giant chicken has earned it its better-known moniker, Gereja Ayam – Chicken Church. Alamsjah ran out of funds in 2000 to complete it and left it to fall into decay. However over the next 15 years, curious visitors to nearby Borobudur began seeking it out. Increasing visitor numbers encouraged Alamsjah to return and begin work on completing the structure. The interior has been decorated in a style that may not be to everyone’s taste. From the parking lot it is a 15-minute walk up a steep hill to the building (for which it is advisable to bring closed footwear). Shuttle rides are offered up the hill but these can be expensive. It is often included in tours to Borobodur. Rp30,000 (+ Rp10,000 parking fees for a car).
