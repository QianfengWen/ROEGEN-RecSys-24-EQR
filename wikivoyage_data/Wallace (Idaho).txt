This mining town fought for its survival on several occasions:
The mining wars: twice in the 1890s civilian rule was suspended in Wallace. Army troops enforced martial law, locking up every man 15 years of age and older in internment camps because striking miners blew up two mills (1892, 1899) a train (1899) and the Governor of Idaho (1905). The assassin, former Wallace area miner Harry Orchard, spent the rest of his life in prison. The men who allegedly hired him, union bosses with the Western Federation of Miners, also hired famed attorney Clarence Darrow and were acquitted for the conspiracy to murder the Governor.
The fire: five years after the governor was blown up, the mountains blew up. Wallace was in the cross-hairs of America's largest ever wild land fire, the Big Burn of 1910. 30 million acres, an area the size of Connecticut, were incinerated in a weekend. One-third to a half of Wallace burned, but these feisty folks lit four back-burns, put out falling embers the size of trees and battled fire tornadoes to survive. That catastrophe changed the way America fought fires and manages forest.
The freeway: in 1967 the federal highway department announced plans to build Interstate 90 through Wallace, which would have led to the demolition of its downtown corridor and most of its residential area. The town fought back, holding up completion of project in court for nearly 20 years. In that time while city fathers sued, the ladies of the Wallace Historic Preservation Society -- mostly grandmothers -- went to every downtown building, filed reams of paperwork, hired historic architects and got every building, then the entire town placed on the National Register -- so the feds couldn't touch a brick. Wallace was saved and the highway department was forced to build a $43-million bypass.

The Oasis Bordello Museum on Pine street walks guests through Wallace's more scandalous past47.472531-115.9235891 Oasis Bordello Museum, 605 Cedar St, ☏ +1 208 753-0801. Summer season: daily 10AM-5PM. Tours start on the half hour. When the final occupants of the Oasis Rooms left in January 1988 (the last recorded date in the "hotel" registry), they seemed to have left in a hurry. Clothing, makeup, toiletries, food and personal items were all left behind. An accurate and tastefully-presented twenty-minute tour of the upper rooms explains the mystery of the ladies' hasty departure and gives a glimpse into the town's bawdy past with details that range from poignant to hilarious. The main floor is an unusual gift shop adorned with Robert Thomas murals that depict the realities of mining in an earlier era. The two-story brick building began its existence in 1895 as a hotel and saloon, and is one of the few structures in Wallace to survive the famous 1910 fire. At that time, Wallace men outnumbered women by nearly 200 to 1. The Oasis was one of five brothels operating without hindrance on Wallace's main street until 1973. $5/person. (updated Sep 2019)

Not far from Wallace, Kellogg has metal sculptures of a dragon and knight, a gold panner, an elk (in front of the local chapter of the Elks), a big panther (which is the high school's mascot) in front of the local pool, a miner and donkey, and the best was the Red Baron. All seemed to be made of scraps of metal from different things, but they are large!  Mine tours (approx. 30 min) are given at Crystal Gold Mine.  Kellogg was the site of one of the worst U.S. mining accidents; a statue of a miner holding high a rock drill guards dozens of impromptu headstones at the Sunshine Mine Disaster Memorial.
