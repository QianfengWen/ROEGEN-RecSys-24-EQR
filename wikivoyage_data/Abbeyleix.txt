Abbeyleix (pronounced "Abbi-leesh") is a town in County Laois in the midlands of Ireland, with a population of 1770 in 2016. The abbey was Cistercian, founded in 1183 in the valley of the River Nore, and the original settlement grew up around it. Nothing remains of these, as the valley was flood-prone, and around 1790 the landowner Viscount de Vesci moved Abbeyleix onto higher ground 2 km east; it was thus one of the earliest examples of a "planned village". The de Vescis also established local industries such as carpet weaving. 
The new Abbeyleix, 14 km south of Portlaoise, came to lie on the main Dublin to Cork road, and was an infamous bottleneck until 2010 when it was bypassed by M7 / M8.

Field drainage, commercial peat-cutting and road building allowed water to escape, degrading the habitat. The Bog Project focuses on restoration.
