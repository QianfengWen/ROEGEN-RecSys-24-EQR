Udon Thani (อุดรธานี, also Udorn Thanee) is a city of 131,000 people (2019) in the Isaan region of Thailand. Often referred to as Udon or Udorn (อุดร), the city should not be confused with Ubon — Ubon Ratchathani in southeastern Isaan.


Understand[edit]
Founded in the 1890s by Prince Prajak Silapakom, Udon Thani is the 7th largest city in Thailand.
Udon had a USAF airbase during the Vietnam War that increased its wealth and importance. Surrounded by one of the major agricultural areas of the country, Udon Thani has become a regional hub for agriculture, commercial distribution, shopping and a fledgling tourism industry.
The airbase closed in 1976, there was a U.S. consulate until 1995, and there is still a Voice of America radio station. Because of this American presence, many Thais were well-paid and learned English, making them more marketable to foreign labour recruiters. A lot of Udon citizens have worked or are working overseas, particularly in Middle East oil fields. This has contributed both to the wealth of the area and its desirability as an expat destination. More than 5,000 expats from Europe, Australia and North America have settled in the area.

Climate[edit]
Winters are fairly dry and very warm. Temperatures rise until April, which is hot with the average daily maximum at 36.2 °C (97.2 °F). The monsoon season runs from late-April through early-October, with heavy rain and somewhat cooler temperatures during the day, although nights remain warm. 

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Udon Thani Airport17.386388102.7883331 Udon Thani Airport (UTH  IATA). Has several 50-min daily flights from Bangkok (Suvarnabhumi [BKK]) (Thai Airlines: around 2,500 baht) or (Don Mueang [DMK]) (Air Asia from 500 baht and Nok Air from 1,250 baht if booked well in advance). There are also direct flights from Chiang Mai, Loei and Phuket (Air Asia flies to Phuket with tickets often around 1,000-1,200 baht, which saves a 2-night bus/train trip via Bangkok).   (updated Oct 2021)
To get to the city there is a limousine service (actually a minibus) for 80 baht/person that will drop you and other passengers at the location of your choice. Minibus tickets are available in the booth just to the right as you leave the terminal building. If there are more than two of you, it may be cheaper to call a taxi (☏ +66 42 323239) or to use Grab ride-hailing service, which (as of January 2019) costs 160 baht to/from central Udon. Taxis are not permitted to wait for passengers at the airport, but some do it anyway, asking 200-400 baht for the 4 km journey. Some hotels have pickup services and may take an extra passenger or two if space permits. Some long distance buses to Khon Kaen were seen in the airport, with numerous people boarding them. No local Udon Thani songthaews have been seen near the airport.
If you are travelling on to Nong Khai, there is a bureau straight ahead of you when you get to the arrivals hall which sells minivan tickets to Nong Khai. They have a minibus which meets most flights and for 200 baht they will load you into a minivan. It takes one hour to reach Nong Khai and if you ask the driver he will take you to your hotel, or drop you off at the Thai side of the Friendship Bridge. You can then proceed into Laos.

By bus[edit]
There are four bus stations in the city:

17.4032102.79981 City Centre Bus Station, Station 1 (BKS Station). The city's main bus station is near Central Plaza. 
 Bus Station 2 (Northern Bus Station) (on the western outskirts of the city on the road in from Loei towards Nong Khai). Buses from northern Thailand such as Loei, Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai. A tuk-tuk into the city costs about 100 baht from there (Dec 2014). Songthaew 7 will take you there as well. 
 Bus Station 3 (just off the ring road, north side of the city). Third-class buses from Nong Khai. (updated Sep 2015)
 Nakhonchai Air Bus Terminal Udon Thani (Tahan Road opposite the Army Hospital). First class and VIP day and overnight buses from Bangkok. Nakhonchai Air has a good reputation for quality, and for managing its drivers to drive safely. Buses from Bangkok also stop at Bus Station 1 when arriving in Udon Thani, before terminating at their own terminal. Nakhonchai Air has buses departing to Bangkok at 08:50; 09:40; 19:00; 20:50; 21:25; 22:00; and 22:45. Travel time is about 7-9 hours depending on traffic. Regular, 454 baht; VIP, 606 baht. (updated Aug 2017)
 Udon-Bangkok. Buses from Bangkok (Mo Chit), an 8-hour journey, arrive at the BKS station in the city centre. BKS buses to Mo Chit depart at 20:00; 20:30; 21:00; and 21:20. Nakhonchai Air also runs buses to Bangkok. (updated Aug 2017)
 Udon-Chiang Mai. A VIP seat on a bus (e.g., Chackrapong Tour) costs 666 baht (Dec 2014). The overnight journey takes 10½ hr. This has to be one of Thailand's worst bus trips as roads en route are small, rural, and winding. Those on the top of double decker buses may get queasy from all the toing-and-froing. Also, as the mid-point is one of Thailand's more remote areas, your bus may not make the customary 20-min break mid-way, or any break at all. Chackrapong buses to Udon drop you at the remote Bus Station 2, a reason to avoid it if you can by taking Phetprasert. (updated Aug 2017)
Phetprasert runs one overnight bus per day between Chiang Mai to Udon (and onto Nakhon Phanom). Buy Phetprasert tickets in the city centre bus station, a 5-minute walk from the shopping mall.
 Udon-Khon Kaen. Air conditioned buses and minivans depart from Udon's Bus Station 1 downtown. There are at least two departures per hour. Duration of the trip is roughly 90 min for the 125 km route. As the old "Non-air conditioned terminal" in downtown Khon Kaen is closed now, the bus will go straight to the Terminal 3 which is 6 km south on the city outskirts. The bus will pass through the city center though, and will stop a few times to drop off the people, so it may be wise to watch the map and get off at the location nearest to your hotel, then take a tuk-tuk or Grab there. 80 baht. (updated Jan 2019)
 Udon-Nong Khai. Buses from several companies depart at least once per hour after 08:00 to Nong Khai, 1 hour, non-air conditioned 3rd class) on the Lao border. Buses from Nong Khai may drop you off north of the city. Follow the locals and hop on the waiting #6 songthaew to the bus station or take a tuk-tuk. 50 baht (Oct 2013). (updated Aug 2017)
 Udon-Pattaya. The 407 Bus Company has daily 08:00, 18:30, and 20:55 buses to Pattaya. The morning bus takes about 12 hours as the bus makes many stops. Night buses take about 10 hr. Fare is 636 baht VIP (Nov 2015). The 407 Company has its office/bus stop near, but not in the city centre bus station. It's on the corner of the main street out the front of the bus station near the 7-Eleven. (updated Aug 2017)
 Udon-Points east. Buses depart around once per hour to Sakon Nakhon (100 baht, 3 hours, air conditioned, 160 km from Udon Thani, on the way to Nakhon Phanom and Mukdahan). (updated Aug 2017)
 Udon-Vientiane. There are six express buses a day direct to the Morning Market in Vientiane (80 baht, 2 hours, air-con 1st class departures at 08:00, 10:30, 11:30, 14:00, 16:00, 18:00). Some companies will not sell this trip if you cannot show a visa. These cross-border buses will sometimes carry passengers who have not obtained their Lao visas in advance, but may not wait long enough at the border for a visa on arrival to be applied for and issued. This isn't a problem when the queues are short, but at busy times passengers who don't already have their visas may be left behind and have to continue by local bus or tuk-tuk. There is a notorious scam of foreigners charged up to 100 baht for a 2-min ride, plus 25 baht for the bridge crossing, plus tuk-tuk or taxi to Vientiane. (updated Aug 2017)
By train[edit]
Udon Thani Train Station
Daily trains go to Nong Khai (45 min for a bargain 11 baht) and over the Friendship Bridge across the Mekong River to Laos. Trains are also frequent to Nakhon Ratchasima and Bangkok. The overnight express sleeper to Bangkok is scheduled to take 9 hr 25 min, but usually takes longer. Nevertheless, it is still quite comfortable and pleasant, especially when taken in a sleeping berth or compartment. A daytime express train to Bangkok traverses a causeway over the large and scenic artificial lake created by the Pa Sak Jolasid Dam (in Lopburi Province). Connections to the major centres of southern Isaan (Buriram, Surin, Si Saket and Ubon Ratchathani) can be made in Nakhon Ratchasima for those who like to travel by rail.
In all, there are daily daytime trains, and three daily nighttime trains from Bangkok to Udon Thani and vice versa (most of which normally originate or terminate at Nong Khai), and several local trains to other destinations, including Nakhon Ratchasima.

17.40412102.805272 Train Station. The Udon Thani train station is convenient, near the main tourist area and Central Plaza shopping complex. 
Get around[edit]
Navigation around Udon Thani is made easier by three large roundabouts on the central road, Hwy 2: the clock circle, the fountain circle and Prince Prajak Circle. It's also possible to orient yourself with Central Plaza or Nong Prajak Park. There is a bypass road that goes around the city.

By taxi[edit]
The main bus station, near Central Plaza has a taxi stand.
Grab ride-hailing service works in Udon as well, though prices start from 60 baht even for a shortest ride, and increase pretty quickly afterwards.

By bicycle taxi[edit]
Udon Thani has many samlors (three-wheeled bicycle taxis), although as elsewhere, they are slowly succumbing to the pressures of the internal combustion engine.

By tuk-tuk[edit]
Tuk-tuks, three-wheeled motorcycles, are readily available in most commercial areas. Negotiate a price for your journey before you get in. In Udon Thani the locally made vehicles (called Skylabs) differ from those in most of Thailand outside Isaan in that their fronts are adapted motorcycles. If you travel to Laos, you will also see such vehicles (called "jumbos") there. Tuk-tuks prowl the streets on the lookout for tourists. Apart from long journeys the price should be around 30-50 baht. If you get into the bus station early in the morning and need a guest house they may pretend they can't speak English, drive you around in a small circle "looking" for guesthouses before dropping you around the corner from the station; however, some may not speak English and are just trying to be helpful. They will then ask for 100 baht for a 30-baht journey. There is plenty of accommodation within walking distance of the station.

By songthaew[edit]
Udon Thani has a bus-like network of numbered pick up trucks with 2 benches in the back songthaews; cost is 8 or 10 baht per trip (10 baht outside the ring road).

By bicycle[edit]

If you wish to travel with a little more comfort, it is recommended to rent a car. The most well-established local car rental in Udon Thani is UD Car Rent, and you will find most major international car hire companies at Udon Thani Airport.

Nong Khai is a very pleasant riverside town near the border with Laos. The Friendship Bridge is located here and this is the main overland border crossing into Laos on the way to Vientiane. Many travellers pass through Nong Khai on their way in and out of Laos without realising that this a worthy travel destination in its own right.
Khon Kaen another similar city on the train line heading south. Buses leave frequently and take 1½ hours, trains take longer.
Vientiane, the capital of Laos, is about one and a half hours away across the Mekong. Express air conditioned buses leave the Udon Central bus station six times daily for Vientiane. Bus fare one way is 80 baht. A visa on arrival for Laos at the Friendship Bridge costs about US$35 for 30 days (two passport photos are required or there is an additional US$1 charge).
