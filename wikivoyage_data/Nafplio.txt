Nafplio (or Nafplion, Nauplio, Nauplia or Nafplia) is a small town in Peloponnese (Greece). A romantic downtown with cozy streets, a great place to stay for radial travelling around Peloponnese.


Understand[edit]
The name is either a reference to its mythical founder, Nafplios the Argonaut, or the remnant of the old Venetian name "Napoli di Romania", from the Greek "nea poli"="new town" of Romania, the name of the area during the late Byzantine times. Nafplio was briefly the capital of Greece before the seat of power was shifted to Athens. It is a historical city due to its Byzantine, Venetian and Ottoman heritage, as well as its meaning to the Greek Revolution. It has a beautiful centre with small neoclassical historical houses, squares and churches.
It is the capital of the prefecture of Argolida.

History[edit]
According to Greek mythology, Nafplio was founded and named after the hero Nafplios, father of Palamidis. It was later under Byzantine, Frankish, Venetian and Ottoman rule. In 1829, after the Greek War of Independence from the Ottoman Empire, Nafplio was chosen as the first capital of the newly-founded state under Governor Kapodistrias. His mansion (Palataki, or "Little Palace") was on the square in front of today's town hall. In 1833 the capital moved to Athens, and Nafplio remained the capital of the prefecture of Argolida.

Orientation[edit]
The town is built in two parts, the old, covering all the peninsula and the new, expanding to the north and the east.
Upon your arrival you will probably drop off at the central bus station, which is at the east end of the old town, or at the port, hosting a large parking area, at the north seaside of the town.
It is sometimes confusing to some that the hill overlooking the town is on the south of the town and the sea on the north. But once you notice it is easy to walk around the orderly shaped blocks.
The major reference point of the old town is Syntagma square, a very large square, with many Venetian-style buildings all around.
Just two blocks north and west is the Philellinon square, by the sea and at the end of the seaside part of the road. Here lies also the old Customs building.
The reference point for the whole town, new and old, is the conjunction of the road coming from athens (Argous street) and the one going east to Epidavros and Porto Heli (Asklepeou street). It is named "endekate", meaning "eleventh", after the bus-stop numbering system of old times. It is from here that a large park starts, covering the old train route, leading to the beginning of the old town.

Get in[edit]
Map of Nafplio
By car[edit]
From Athens the trip is 1½-2 hours by car (147 km). Follow the signs to the harbour where you'll find a large parking area which is free of charge (as of July 2022). If your accommodation is within the old town, it should be easily reachable within 10 to 15 minutes by foot.

By bus[edit]
Buses connect the town with Athens, Salonica and all the major cities of Peloponessos.
From Athens, there are 12 to 14 daily buses (from the Eleftherios Venizelos airport take the X93 bus till the last stop).  The buses of KTEL [1] [formerly dead link]  leave Athens from Terminal A in Kifissos central bus station. The journey takes about 2 hours and the price is €13.1 one way, €23 return (July 2022). You can buy tickets online.
There are buses from the Corinth-Channel Bus Terminal to Nafplio via Argos (July 2022), priced €6.5 one way, but not from Proastiakos Corinth Train station, due to their competition.

By sea[edit]
the town has a good protected port which can host several yachts providing them with all facilities.

By train[edit]
As of 2022, train services to Nafplio are suspended and it's unclear when they will return. Nearest city with passenger services is Corinth.

Get around[edit]
All the major sights are within the old town and can easily be covered by walking.
The municipality is providing free bicycles for a day, just in front of the Town Hall, by the KTEL bus station.

See[edit]
The funerary monument of Dimitrios Ypsilantis, a hero of the Greek War of Independence, who died in Nafplio in 1832
At a first glance, Nafplio looks like an Italian city because of its architecture and the colourful houses. More fundamentally, Nafplio has a quite an interesting architecture, with many traces of 18th century European towns, Byzantine and Ottoman influences. Many of the old town's buildings date back to two hundred years ago.

Standing like a crown over Nafplio, Palamidi fortress (build by the Venetians around 1686 and completed to its present form in 1714) was so well designed that all attempts to conquer it were unsuccessful, making it a legend at the time. Finally, in 1822, the Greeks succeeded, creating surprise and amazement. In very good condition, you can visit it by taking the legendary 999 (in fact 857) stairsteps, or simply drive there. The view is unique, and you will also see many historical monuments, such as the small cave-prisons (also prison of the national hero Kolokotronis) and the church of Saint Andreas.

Occupied by the Turks from 1715 to 1822 Today, it only takes 5 minutes to visit Bourtzi with the small boats available at the port and observe the town from the opposite side. Don’ t miss it (€4 round-trip).   (updated Mar 2016)
 Old town fortifications. All of the town used to be fortified, with two parts, the seaside merchant quarter, being the present old town, and the uphill, the barracks quarter, now an open archeological site, partly hosting a hotel. At the old town fortifications only remain in the east limit, just in front of the central bus station. The large protecting trench now has been covered and it is part of the city's park. (updated Mar 2016)
Curiosities[edit]
At the other end of the gulf there is the undersea fountain of Anavalos, protected by an in-sea dam, hydrating all the area.
Due to the quality of the soil there are some interesting dolines (sinkholes) in the general area, some of which are hosting various old relics.

The site is very well preserved and easy to follow with a guidebook. This is where Herculese came back to between labours. To walk or cycle there go to the old railway station in the park next to the bus stop and follow the tracks as far as you can before cutting across to the main road. You cannot miss the site   
37.5936322.93755613 Arkadiko Bridge (Kazarma Mycenaean Bridge). The oldest preserved bridge in Europe, dated to the Greek Bronze Age. Also one of the oldest still crossable arch bridges in existence.   
Do[edit]
Strolling in the old city of Nafplio
One of the best characteristics of Nafplio is that everything in the Old Town is within walking distance. In fact you can walk from one end to another in less than 15 min, and that's why you can see couples in love, happy kids, and large groups of friends everywhere in the town, at the port, in the alleys, always walking around and enjoying every part of the town. Because of the small distances and the paved ways, there are few areas cars are allowed to pass, and there is no bus service in the old part of town, only the central station that takes you to the new part of the town and the rest of the prefecture. So, leave the car in the parking and enjoy walking around Nafplio all year round. Alternatively, you can take the horse carriage or the small train for a tour in the town.
Some distinguished buildings are

the First New Greek Gymnasium (built 1833)
the old Town Hall building (Iatrou building)
the house of the Viceroy
the Alevras-Lambiris building (1830)
the old train station (1890)
Palamidi
Climb 999 (in reality 857) stairs to the castle of Palamidis. You may get tired but the view is said to be worth it. We walked the paved road down to the crossing and went right down to "Karathona Beach". From "Karathona Beach" there is a walking path along the coast-line back to "Arvanithia Beach" and Nafplio. Its a nice scenic walk and takes about 1 hour.
Psaromachalas

View of the south shore of Acronafplia
During your strolls in Nafplio, it is worth adding 15 minutes to your schedule to walk around Psaromachala (meaning fishermonger's), the area under the rocky hill of Acronafplia. In contrast with the large, classical style mansions and open spaces of the main parts of the old town, here you will see small, white houses, with yards filled by flowers, narrow alleys and stairways, cats lurking and mewing, and in general the feeling of a small, traditional neighborhood, reminding to many the Greek islands. Add to the picture some larger mansions that have been renovated and turned to guesthouses and hotels and you have a unique part of Nafplio, with great view and good hospitality.
Enjoying the sea
Very close to the town is the quiet sandy beach of Karathona, just south of Palamede castle hill. There the locals gather to enjoy swimming in this blue flagged clean beach.
At the back of the castles, 10 minutes' walk just south of the town, is also the Arvanitia beach.
Even more south, approachable by local bus or car, there is a series of marvelous beaches, very popular during the summer.
Daily Cruises in the Argolic Gulf
If you have time you van try this cruise, giving you the pleasure to enjoy the sea and the seaside attractions of the area, including a bath stop! On the promenade where the boats for Bourtzi depart, usually once a day in summertime.

Go next[edit]
Epidaurus
at the start of the old town is located the local bus station, Ktel. It is the same very spot at the old times one could find carriages and horses. From here depart local buses for all the villages and attractions of the area, on a tight schedule and very low fare.[3] [formerly dead link]
If you plan to stroll around, Nafplio is a good base to head out to the numerous archeological sites surrounding it. The Epidaurus theater, Mycenae and Tiryns (all UNESCO World Heritage sites) are just some of them. Nearly all towns villages and tourist spots are serviced by local buses at all times.
The bus station is at the end of the park, just before the old town, at Sygrou str 8.
It is here you may catch the bus to the ancient (but still servicing) theater of Epidaurus, the ancient town of Mycenae.
Very close it is Argos, the most ancient town of Europe, now a quiet agricultural town. It has a castle overlooking the town, the ruins of its theater and the remainders of ancient settlements, and some interesting nearby monasteries.
It is also worth exploring the quiet nearby fisher-villages such as Vivari (with its lagoon and its wonderful sandy beach Kondyli), Hermioni town, Porto Heli with the ancient port of Aliis, the small fisher port of Koilada with its adjacent prehistoric Frahthi cave and the miniature churches in the doline wells near Didyma.

The schedule is designed to coincide with the ferry departures.
