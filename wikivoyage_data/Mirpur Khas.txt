Chitorri graves
Mirpur Khas, literary the "land of most royal Mirs", is an ancient and historical city of Sindh. It used to serve as gateway to the Great Thar Desert and is today counted amongst the largest cities of Sindh. Unfortunately, it doesn't offer much to see for its visitors, except for the ancestral graves of Talpur Mirs on the outskirts of the city.


Understand[edit]
The early history of Mirpur Khas dates back to the 4th-century CE Buddhist settlement known as Kao Jo Daro. Much later, armies of Muhammad Bin Qasim settled in the area when Sindh was conquered by Muhammad Bin Qasim, and shortly following that, the city of Mirpur Khas was founded by Mir Ali Murad Talpur in 1806. The city remained the capital of Talpur Mirs of Mirpurkhas until 1843 when Sindh was annexed to British India under the East India Company. Later Sindh was made part of Bombay Presidency. Soon after the 1947 partition, the population of Mirpur Khas swelled as it became the first city to welcome refugees from across the Indian side of the new border to Pakistan and acted as a primary railway junction for the first trains to roll across Rajasthan to Sindh.
