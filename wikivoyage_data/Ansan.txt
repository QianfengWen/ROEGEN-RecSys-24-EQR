Danwon-gu (단원구) In western Ansan. The word 'Danwon' orginates from Danwon Hong-do Kim, a famous painter of Korea.


Understand[edit]
Ansan River (Ansancheon) in Hosu (in English, 'lake') Park
Ansan is a mid-sized city on the outskirts of Seoul. It is well integrated with Seoul's transport system, and generally speaking can be considered as a suburb. The city was planned by Park Jeong-hee in 1970 and is an important industrial center.
Ansan has one of Korea's largest immigrant communities. The percentage of multi-cultural families here is the highest in South Korea, although it is less known than Itaewon among English-speaking foreigners, as most immigrants here are Chinese and other Asian blue collar workers.

History[edit]
Ansan used to be Janghanggu County or Gosaya Holcha County in Goguryeo. It was promoted to Janggu County during the reign of King Gyeongdeok of Silla. In the early Goryeo Dynasty, it was renamed Ansan-gun, and in the 9th year of King Hyunjong (1018), it became a vassal county of Suwon (Suwon: Suwon) and became Ansan County.

Climate[edit]
Ansan's climate is very similar to that of nearby Seoul and Suwon.The following table is Suwon's climate. Compared to Incheon or Seoul, Suwon is relatively hotter and colder. It features continental climate. Ansan is close to the West Sea so there are a lot of winds from the sea.
According to the Korea Meteorological Administration's forecast, it is not always well buried in Incheon and Suwon, but it is much similar to Incheon's climate than inland Suwon and mainly belongs to the temperate rain. It is about 2 degrees cooler in summer and 2 degrees warmer in winter than Seoul or Suwon like the beach. Except for Daebudo Island, it is an area that has no characteristics of coastal cities, but it is quite pleasant because it has a combination of marine climate characteristics. Annual precipitation is about 1,300mm, which is as high as a general west coast area. The drainage facilities are well equipped, so there is no flood damage. However, due to the nature of the oceanic climate, it is very humid in summer. In summer, there are many days when humidity is more than 90% even on days when it does not rain, and 100% is also recorded during the night time.
