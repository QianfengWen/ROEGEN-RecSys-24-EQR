History[edit]
In 1651, the Jesuit priest Buteaux was the first European known to have travelled up the Saint-Maurice River to this river's first set of great falls. Afterwards, missionaries going to the Upper Saint-Maurice would rest here. Before Shawinigan Falls was established, the local economy had been largely based on lumber and agriculture.

The "Trou du Diable" falls
In the late 1890s, Shawinigan Falls drew the interest of foreign entrepreneurs  because falls had the potential to become a favourable location for the production of hydroelectricity. In 1899, the Shawinigan Water & Power Company commissioned an engineering firm design a grid plan for a new industrial town on the banks of the Saint-Maurice River, providing the ground work for what would become Downtown Shawinigan.
In 1901, the place was incorporated as a village, and gained town (ville) status a year later. The hydro-electric generating station contributed to rapid economic growth and the town achieved several firsts in Canadian history: first production of aluminum (1901), carborundum (1908), cellophane pellets (1932). Shawinigan Falls also became one of the first Canadian cities with electric street lighting. For decades, the local pulp and paper, chemical and textile industries created thousands of jobs and stimulated city growth.
Local prosperity was interrupted by the Great Depression in the 1930s. Many plants were forced to temporarily reduce or stop their production, which left many residents jobless. Many families needed public assistance to survive. The City Council enacted a public works program to help families. World War II put Shawinigan Falls, and many others cities in Canada, back on the path of economic recovery. During hostilities, the windows of local power plants were painted black to prevent any possible German aerial attack.
By the early 1950s, the industrial growth in Shawinigan was such that the city offered the steadiest employment and the highest wages in Quebec. As its working class gained economic ground and political leverage, Shawinigan became fertile ground for labour unions. The workers of the Belgo pulp and paper plant went on strike in 1955.
In the 1950s, Shawinigan Falls entered a period of decline that would last for several decades. Technological improvements made industries less dependent on Shawinigan's geographic location. Many employers relocated to nearby larger cities or closed down.
In order to offset the decline of the heavy industry, leaders have promoted the expansion of the local hospitality industry.

Climate[edit]
Shawinigan has a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb) with cold and snowy winter coupled with mild to warm summers. Precipitation is moderate to high year round, resulting in heavy winter snowfall, typical of Eastern Canada.
