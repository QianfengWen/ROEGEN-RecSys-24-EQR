Northam is a town in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia, with a population of 6679 in 2021. It's 100 km east of Perth and like other nearby towns it was founded in the 1830s when the Avon Valley was colonised. It was never a mining town, but was a railhead for miners heading east to the goldfields, until the railway pushed further out towards Kalgoorlie.

 York 35 km south was bypassed when the goldfields railway was routed via Northam, so its historic centre is better preserved.
Toodyay 27 km northwest is another Victorian old town.
Kalgoorlie on the goldfields is 500 km east so you can do it in a day, or break the journey at Merredin.
Perth is only an hour west, with lots of big city attractions.
