Climate[edit]
Nimmitabel enjoys an oceanic climate, with mild summers and cold winters. Rainfall is moderate and spread out across the year. Frost is common year-round, even in summer. The town sees a good amount of sunshine, with about 102 clear days annually, thanks to its position shielded from prevailing winds.
Due to its high elevation and southern location, snowfall is typical from May to October, with occasional flurries even in December. Snowfall can be heavy at times. The town has experienced below-freezing temperatures several times below (and is not an uncommon occurrence)
