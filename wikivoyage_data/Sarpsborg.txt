Sarpsborg[dead link] is the 11th largest city in Norway. Downtown Sarpsborg is below 20 minutes from alpine skiing slopes and from the start of the 200 km-long archipelago from Sarpsborg to Gothenburg. In the city centre is a large park and the largest waterfall in Europe.


Understand[edit]

It has 57,000 inhabitants in the municipality (2019), and another 178,000 in seven neighbouring municipalities within half an hour's drive. Sarpsborg is the capital of Østfold county and the largest city alongside the E6 motorway between Oslo (1 hour north of Sarpsborg) and Gothenburg (2 hours south of Sarpsborg)

History[edit]
Sarpsborg was founded by St. Olaf in 1016, making the city one of the eight Norwegian cities of today with a Viking age origin, together with Trondheim, Bergen, Stavanger, Skien, Tønsberg, Oslo and Hamar. St. Olaf founded the city at Sarpsfossen falls, because it was not possible to sail further up river Glomma. In fact Glomma is Norway's longest river, and only beaten by a few EU rivers in terms of flow rate: Danube, Rhine, Rhone, Po, Vistula, Loire and Elbe. 
In 1567 the King of Denmark relocated Sarpsborg 14 km further down the river, closer to the river mouth in Skagerrak. That place is now a separate city called Fredrikstad. The river falls made perfect conditions for industry, so Sarpsborg regained its city status in 1839.

The riverside was the perfect place to locate industry, which made Sarpsborg grow together with Fredrikstad to form the 6th most populated urban area in Norway, with 111,000 inhabitants in a contiguous built-up area surrounding both sides of the Glomma. 
Sarpsborg is still a very industrial city, with above 10 km of the riverside contiguously covered with industry. The industry was to a large content built up by British factory owners, and the British traditions is still visible via British townhouse architecture and a strong interest and achiements in football and golf. Another proof of the city being industrial, is that Labour Party have had the mayor since 1913, making it the only major city they never have lost an election in.

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
Sarpsborg Rådhus (town hall)
Sarpsborg is served by the Norwegian State Railway. The fastest trains make the journey in 1 hr 21 min from Oslo and 2 hr 29 min from Gothenburg. The trains from Oslo depart every hour from 06:01 to 00:01, and stops in Ski, Moss, Rygge, Råde and Fredrikstad on the way to Sarpsborg and Halden. Three daily trains connect Gothenburg, Trollhättan, Vänersborg and Ed in Dalsland with Sarpsborg. Departure time from Gothenburg is 06:55, 13:00 and 17:55. Around 550 passengers a day use the train station in Sarpsborg.

By bus[edit]
Sarpsborg is served by the Timekspressen. This bus line departs Oslo every hour from 07:05 to 20:05, plus 22:05 on weekdays and 23:15 on Saturdays. Travel time to Sarpsborg Bus Terminal is 1 hr 30 min from Oslo, 58 minutes from Ås and 37 minutes from Moss. While the Timekspressen goes to the city centre, the GoByBus [dead link] line from Oslo to Uddevalla and Gothenburg only stops at Quality Hotel Sarpsborg by the E6, 3 km north of the city centre. GoByBus operates 5 times a day. 4 of the daily schedules also stop in Strömstad and Tanum in Bohuslän. 3 of the daily schedules are prolonged to Helsingborg, Malmö and Copenhagen. The most popular bus line in Sarpsborg is Glommaringen with 8 departures to Fredrikstad every hour, and around 2,800 daily passengers. It is also daily bus connection between Sarpsborg and the smaller towns Askim and Mysen in northern Østfold.

By plane[edit]
Copenhagen's Kastrup Airport[dead link] (CPH) is the only airport with a direct bus line to Sarpsborg. But with only 3 daily routes and almost 7 hours travel time, it is a poor alternative. More usual is to travel to Oslo's Gardermoen Airport, Torp Airport or Gothenburg's Landvetter Airport and take a train or bus to downtown, and find a bus or train to Sarpsborg there. Doing this the travel time from the airports to Sarpsborg usually will be between 2 and 3 hours.

By car[edit]
Arriving from south use Exit 5 or Exit 6 on the European Route E6 motorway. Exit 5 passes Sarpsfossen, the largest waterfall in Europe on the way into the city centre. Exit 6 passes Amfi Borg, a large shopping mall with over 70 stores. Arriving from north use Exit 7, where the Quality Hotel Sarpsborg is situated. Above 20,000 vehicles a day use the E6 through Sarpsborg. By car the travel time from Sarpsborg is 15 minutes to Fredrikstad, 20 minutes to Moss and Halden and 30 minutes to Askim, Mysen and Strömstad. Sarpsborg is a popular transit station for tourists going further north in Norway, because it is half-way between Denmark and the most spectacular fjords and mountains of Norway, around 6 hours from both Copenhagen and Sognefjorden.

Get around[edit]
59°17′11″N 11°5′44″E
The town centre is small enough that it is easy to get around on foot. Between Sarpsborg and Fredrikstad buses are frequent. In other directions buses are infrequent, and getting around without driving your own car can be inconvenient.
When driving, try to avoid the bridges across the river during rush hour (07:30 - 08:30 and 15:30 - 17:00), as they are major bottlenecks and congested.
