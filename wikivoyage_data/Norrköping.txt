A nice way to get around in Norrköping is with the orange trams. Tickets or cards can be bought onboard, but the price is twice as high than if you buy the ticket or card beforehand in a kiosk, supermarket, or similar. You can even pay by SMS to avoid the 50% surcharge when paying cash on the tram or bus.
Everything listed here in the city is within walking distance of the other listings, as the town centre isn't that big.

On weekends Norrköping often experience the normal festivities of any town and the inner city (Drottningatan and Kungsgatan) may have some drunks and noisy people rumbling around. If you happen to meet a drunk person they most likely want to engage in conversation, just be friendly and say you don't have time or are going someplace and they will most likely back off. Physical confrontations are very rare.
