Lake Forest is a city in Orange County in Southern California.


Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Lake Forest lies between Interstate 5 and the 241, a toll road.  The 241 ends about 5 miles south of the city, but this road can be used to reach the Riverside Area.  I-405 begins a few miles north of Lake Forest and can be used as an alternate route north.

By plane[edit]
The closest commercial airport is John Wayne Airport but the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX IATA) is the largest one in the area.

By train[edit]
The closest Amtrak station is in Irvine.  Metrolink shares the station and has two lines that stop there.  One line goes from San Bernardino to Oceanside and the other goes from Ventura to Oceanside.

Get around[edit]
The Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) does provide a pretty thorough bus service but it is still advised to rent a car.
