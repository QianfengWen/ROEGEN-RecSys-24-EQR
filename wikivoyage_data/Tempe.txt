Tempe is a city of 180,587 (2020) in the Greater Phoenix area of Arizona, best known as the home of Arizona State University (ASU). Its younger, student-heavy population allows it to offer a vibrant nightlife that is relatively rare in Arizona.


Understand[edit]
Tempe skyline
Tempe is a small but dynamic, steadily growing city. Its shared history with ASU has given it a long-standing reputation as a college town, and it is considered to be the academic and intellectual center of the greater Phoenix area.  It is home to numerous research-centric industries in fields ranging from biotechnology to solar energy as well as a high percentage of knowledge workers those industries require. Being surrounded by the neighboring cities of Phoenix, Scottsdale, Mesa, and Chandler, it serves as a major hub in the Valley Metro light rail transit system.

By rail[edit]
The Valley Metro Light Rail project is operational and brings light rail service through Tempe from the neighboring cities of Mesa and Phoenix. The rates are very reasonable, and day-passes are available for a discount. Tickets may be purchased from automated kiosks at every station. Free Park-and-Ride lots are located along the length of the route. There are plans in the works to extend the rail system through the use of spurs.

Valley Metro offers bus service to Tempe from neighboring cities, as well as ORBIT, the free neighborhood shuttle around Tempe (see listing below in 'Get Around'). Routes and fares can be found on their website. Nearby Mesa does not have bus service on Sundays, so some service in Tempe is disrupted.
By plane[edit]
Tempe is one of the most accessible cities in the Phoenix Metropolitan area and only 10 minutes from Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. Taxis and shuttles are available for arrivals and departures. There are also a number of reasonably priced public buses, and the light rail is a short shuttle ride away. Those new to Sky Harbor should be warned, however, that the roads and parking lots serving the airport can be poorly marked and rather confusing to navigate. Allot extra time in case you miss a turn and need to circle around.
Only Terminals 3 and 4 exist at Sky Harbor.

By car[edit]
Tempe is accessible via several main arteries, including Interstate 10, Loop 101, Loop 202, US 60, and surface streets including Washington St to the Mill Avenue Bridge. University Dr, Apache Blvd, Baseline Rd, and Elliot Rd are major east–west roads, and Mill Ave/Kyrene Rd, Rural Rd, and Price Rd are major north–south roads. Price Rd is also the frontage road for the Loop 101 freeway, which is known as the Price Freeway through Tempe and Chandler.

By bike[edit]
Several bike routes reach into Tempe, especially around the downtown area where you can bike over Tempe Town Lake from Phoenix on the Mill Ave Bridge. A mixed-use bike/pedestrian path also crosses Tempe Town Lake at Tempe Town Lake Dam, near the Tempe Center for the Arts.

By bicycle[edit]
Tempe is a comparatively bicycle-friendly city in the Phoenix valley area, and features bike lanes along many roads (which see more traffic the closer you get to downtown Tempe and ASU) and a variety of very enjoyable bike paths in and around parks and scenic locations, which connect conveniently to nearly all urban areas and points of interest. Although Tempe is a small city, the dry and hot summer climate can make it somewhat uncomfortable to self-pedal from one point in the city to another. For this and many other reasons, electric bikes are becoming a very popular option year-round.
