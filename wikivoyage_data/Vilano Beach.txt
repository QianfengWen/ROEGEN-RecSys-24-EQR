Vilano Beach is a small beachside town in the First Coast region of Florida near St. Augustine.


Understand[edit]
Atlantic shoreline in Vilano Beach
A tourist town, Vilano Beach is connected to St. Augustine via a bridge across the Intracoastal Waterway near the meeting point of the Tolomato and Guana Rivers. To the town's south is St. Augustine Inlet, which connects the Intracoastal Waterway to the Atlantic Ocean to the east. The northern side of the town is largely residential, while the district nearest the bridge is more commercial.
The climate of the town is semi-tropical with hot, humid summers moderated by the ocean. Hurricanes have severely eroded the beaches, which are replaced through offshore dredging conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers.

Get in[edit]
The only road providing access to Vilano Beach is FL-A1A, which enters the town from the west via the bridge from St. Augustine and from Ponte Vedra to the north.
