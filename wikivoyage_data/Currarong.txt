Understand[edit]
Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The easiest way to get into Currarong is via car. Currarong is about a 30-minute drive from Nowra, and a three-hour drive from Sydney.

By bus[edit]
Stewarts Coaches runs a bus service into Currarong twice a day on weekdays.

Get around[edit]
Since Currarong is a relatively small village, the easiest way to get around is by walking. The village has exemplary walking facilities, with most of the village foot pathed and a footbridge over the Currarong Creek.
You could drive, but parking is limited to the side of the road in all areas except for Bosom Beach and the Currarong Bowling Club. Also, most of the streets surrounding the main shops can become almost un-navigable for cars during peak tourist times.

See and do[edit]
The "Rock Pool" is a naturally formed sheltered swimming area protected from the sea by a rock barrier. The Rock Pool has been upgraded with stairs, handrails and picnic facilities making an excellent swimming location for everyone.
Also, Bosom Beach is a 1500-m-long stretch of pristine beach bordering the rock pool.

Eat[edit]
The Currarong General Store and Zac's Place offer fine food, coffee and general supplies, enough to cater for most holiday needs. Also, Zac's Place offers night dining with fresh seafood on reservation. Reserve early because demand is high.

Drink[edit]
The Currarong Bowling Club with Chinese Bistro should be able to serve all drinking needs.
