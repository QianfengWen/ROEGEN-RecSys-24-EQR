Dunsborough is a town in Western Australia.


Get in[edit]
Many people who live in Perth drive to Dunsborough by car. With the recent Freeway extension, the trip takes approximately 3 hours.
There is a train service to Bunbury, as well as buses from Perth.

Get around[edit]
Cycling: The town, coastal area, and hinterland are all very flat and there are a number of shared-use bike paths, making it fairly easy to get around by bike. The traffic along the more major roads can be a bit hard going sometimes, especially as there is sometimes not much space on the hard shoulder.

See[edit]
The beaches are relatively calm in Geographe Bay.
West of Dunsborough along Caves Road is a cave named Nglili Cave. It is one of the deepest in the region and has many wonderful features. Weddings are sometimes held there. The lighthouse in the west is also very popular.

Eat[edit]

At night, there is a small outdoor food area next to the pub, with a pizza place, a Thai take-away and a burger take-away place all next to each other.
