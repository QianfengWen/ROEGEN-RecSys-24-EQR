Understand[edit]


In 2011, Gouveia (goh-VAY-uh, /go.ˈvɐj.ɐ/) municipality was home to 14,046 people (2011), of whom 3,500 lived in the town. 

History[edit]
Igreja de São Pedro with the façade covered with tiles (azulejos)
The establishment of Gouveia is often attributed to the year 580 BC, but the oldest material proof of human occupation is funerary pottery dating to the Bronze Age. In the parish of Rio Torto, the oldest evidence of human occupation is a dolmen (a stone funerary structure) dating back to the fourth millennium BC.
The Roman occupation was also a part of the city's history. A consecration inscription to the Lusitanian god Salqiu was found in a chapel on the city centre, as was the grave of a Roman warrior with iron artefacts related to war (axe, knife, and an arrow head). In the Folgosinho, Nespereira, and V.N. Tazem parishes, there are Roman roads that can still be walked.
During the Medieval period, the city developed, with shepherding, agriculture, and wool production as the biggest areas of economic development. The Jewish community played an important role in this development, especially in the handcrafts using wool, but also with trade. A Hebrew inscription was found in the late 1960s in one of the old Jewish quarters that certifies the last synagogue to be built in Portugal before the mandatory conversion and expulsion of the Jewish community of Portugal in the year of 1496, which is also the year recorded in the inscription. The inscription can be seen in the museum Espaço Arte e Memória.
During the modern period, the wool industry grew until the 20th century, since which time it has diminished.
The main architectural structures are in the city centre, and they go back to the 18th century, especially the St. Peter's church, a small cathedral, the library and the museum building, the city hall, an 18th-century Jesuit college, and several churches and chapels. The biggest icon is a 16th-century building called casa da torre, which has a "pelourinho" in front from the same period as the building to commemorate the autonomy attained by Gouveia from King Manuel I.

 Serra da Estrela Natural Park. The uniqueness of the Serra da Estrela Higher Plateau and its geographical isolation gave rise to a diversity of flora and fauna species, whose value was acknowledged when the Council of Europe assigned it the title of Biogenetic Reservation.

With an area of 6 hectares, the park has flora and fauna distributed along its paths as well as support infrastructures and information for visitors about the environmental region that surrounds the city.
