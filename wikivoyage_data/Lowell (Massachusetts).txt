Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The nearest airports are Boston's Logan Airport (BOS IATA) and Manchester Airport (MHT IATA) in New Hampshire, each about 40 minutes away.

By train[edit]
The Lowell line of the MBTA Commuter Rail has a terminus in Lowell. This train station is about a 15 minute walk from downtown, or there is a shuttle that runs between the train station and downtown.

By car[edit]
Take U.S. Route 3 or Interstate 495 to the Lowell Connector, a 2.5-mile highway that ends near downtown Lowell. Be careful: the Lowell Connector is one of the most dangerous highways in the state. Exit 31 on Route 3 and exits 37 and 38 on I-495 will also take you to Lowell.

Merrimack River Bridges. Lowell is home to several impressive bridges, two of which cross the Merrimack River. The Aiken Street Bridge is a lenticular through truss bridge, one of the rarest bridge types and the longest of its kind. The Central Bridge is a cantilevered through truss bridge. Both spans offer pedestrian access and are highly impressive.
Lowell Industrial Canals. There are four narrow canals running through downtown Lowell, which are still navigable in some sections. These canals were used as a hydropower source when the mills and factories were still in use. Despite their size, the canals are home to some beautiful restored historic footbridges. Also, several sets of locks along the canals are still in use for flood control. The four canals, together with the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, turn part of downtown Lowell into an island.

It is one of three large hydroelectric dams along the Merrimack. While the only immediate access through the Dam is by boat, viewing the dam and its associated man-made islands from above is still an impressive sight.   (updated Oct 2016)
