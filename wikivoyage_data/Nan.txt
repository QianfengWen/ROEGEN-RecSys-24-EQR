Nan (น่าน) is a town in the remote valley of the Nan River in the Northern River Valleys region of Northern Thailand, bordering Laos. The area is heavily forested with arable land used mainly for agriculture. It is an ancient city steeped in history with its long association with the Lanna Thai culture and the Sukhothai kingdom.
Although Nan is often overlooked by foreign tourists, don't let that discourage you from visiting. In fact, if you're seeking an authentic Thai experience, Nan is the perfect place to be.


Understand[edit]
Nan, a lesser-known region of Thailand, has a rich history that dates back centuries. It was once an autonomous kingdom that had limited contact with the outside world. Interestingly, the name "Nan" is also used to describe moon-faced children with buck teeth who are considered annoying in Thailand.

History[edit]
Archaeological evidence shows that prehistoric people inhabited the area, but it was not until the mid-14th century that several small meuangs (city-states) united to form Nanthaburi on the Nan River. This was around the same time that the Lan Xang (Million Elephants) kingdom was established in Laos and Luang Prabang was created. Nanthaburi, associated with the powerful Sukhothai kingdom, was given the title Wara Nakhon and played a significant role in the development of early Thai nationalism.
By the late 14th century, Nan had become one of the nine northern Thai-Lao principalities that formed Lan Na Thai, which is now known as Lanna. The city-state flourished under the name Chiang Klang (Middle City) in the 15th century. It was so named because of its location between Chiang Mai (New City) and Chiang Thong (Golden City, which is now Luang Prabang).
In 1558, the Burmese invaded and took control of the kingdom. They deported many of the inhabitants to Burma as slaves, and the city was completely deserted. It was not until 1786 that western Thailand was reclaimed from the Burmese, and the local dynasty regained sovereignty over Nan. However, it remained semi-autonomous until 1931 when it finally accepted the full dominion of Bangkok.
Visitors to contemporary Nan can still see parts of the old city wall and several early wats that date back to the Lanna period. The city's wats are unique and influenced by both Lanna and Tai Lü architecture. The Tai Lü people brought this architectural style from Xishuangbanna in China, where they originated from.

Orientation[edit]
The city spreads out along around 4 km, between the airport at the north end of town and the bus station at the south end, but its historical and commercial centre is more compact. Its area follows roughly a north-south orientation, along the right bank of the River Nan. The two main axes of the town, more or less parallel, are Sumonthewarat Rd (the easternmost and the closest to the river) and the Mahayot Rd. The city's main monuments are located at the junction of the three parallel axes: Pha Kong Rd (west), Mahayot Rd (middle), and Sumonthewarat Rd (east) and Suriyapong Rd which is perpendicular to them. As for the main shops, they can be found along the Sumonthewarat Rd and its perpendicular, Anantaworattidet Rd.
In the town, three bridges connect the right bank to the left bank of the River Nan: the southernmost, the Sriboonruang Bridge, the middle one,  the Pattana Paknue Bridge, under which are held the boat races, and the northernmost, the Nakorn Nan Pattana Bridge.

By car[edit]
One of the most efficient ways to get around the city is by car. The roads in Nan are typically spacious, well-maintained, and kept clean, making for a comfortable and smooth driving experience.

By motorcycle[edit]
Nan’s charm is undeniable, but the best part is the region and nature around the province, so renting a motorbike is recommended.
There are a few places nearby the bus station. Ask around to find a motorbike.
Prices in Nan tend to be a bit higher than other regions. This is due to the isolation and lack of tourist infrastructure. Expect to pay 250-300 baht per day (compared to 150-200 in Pai or Chiang Mai).

The oldest parts of the house show planks cleaved by axe and knife, before large saws were available in Nan. At the time it was built, about 150 years ago, such large teak houses were reserved for nobility. It is probably the best preserved such noble house in the province. It was built in the area of Nan now occupied by the military camp, and was moved to its current site, on a quiet soi behind Wat Pragert, by Chao Fongkham's parents, about 100 years ago. It is now occupied by Chao Fongkham's children.  (updated Oct 2018)

After the death of the Chao Maha Brahma Surathada, the last Lord of Nan, his heirs donated this palace to the government in 1931 in order to be used as the provincial hall. The museum was inaugurated in 1973 after the new provincial hall had been erected. Thanks to renovations, it is one of Thailand's most up-to-date provincial museums. Unlike many of them it also has English labels for many items on display.The ground level is divided into six exhibition rooms with ethnological exhibits dealing with the various ethnic groups found in the province, including northern Thais, Thai Lü, Htin, Khamu, Mabri, Hmong, and Mien.

The first is the main hall which used to be the throne hall of the feudal lord. The second consists of the rooms in the north and south wings.The museum exhibits a wide collection of Buddha images which includes some rare Lanna styles as well as the floppy-eared local styles. Usually made from wood, these standing images are in the "calling for rain" posture (with hands at the sides, pointing down) and they show an obvious Luang Prabang influence.Also on display on the 2nd floor is a rare black (or more accurately reddish-brown) elephant tusk said to have been offered to a Nan king over 300 years ago by the Khün lord of Chiang Tung (Kengtung). Held aloft by a wooden Garuda (mythical bird) sculpture, the tusk measures 97 cm long and 47 cm in circumference.Books on Thai art and archaeology are sold in a building adjacent to the museum. 20 baht Thai people, 100 baht foreigners.

Temples[edit]
18.774669100.7715927 Wat Phumin. The city of Nan's most famous wat is renowned for its cruciform ubosoth (or bot) which was constructed in 1596 and restored during the reign of Chao Ananta Vora Ritthi Det (1867-1875). It is the only temple built as if it were on the back of two immense snakes (or Nagas). Each of the four entrances is approached via a small corridor topped by a finely decorated point-shaped structure (underlining the royal origin of the temple) equipped with smoothly carved doors, with Chinese demon guards in the east, flowers in the north, and forest life motifs in the Lanna-style in the west and south. The wat's interior is impressive. It is also a good example of Thai Lue architecture. Well preserved murals of great value illustrating the Khattana Kumara (Jataka) on the north wall and the Nimi Jatakas on the west wall, as well as scenes of the local life of the time when they were painted by Thai Lue artists during the restoration of the temple at the end of the 19th century. Europeans are depicted in a reference to the arrival of the French, to whom the east of the Nan Valley area was yielded in 1893.   (updated Oct 2018)
18.770333100.76258 Wat Phaya Wat (วัดพญาวัด). An ancient religious site, it has rectangular chedi base on which Buddha states are placed around the chedi structure. Combined artistic influences of Lanna, Lan Chang, and native Nan can be detected.  (updated Sep 2018)

Apart from the viharn which is adorned with elaborate carvings, there are also wall murals painted by Thai Lu artists some one hundred years ago.  (updated Sep 2018)
19.178318100.91758710 Wat Phrathat Beng Sakat (วัดพระธาตุเบ็งสกัด). The main Buddha image is in the local style residing on the so-called Chukkachi base. The back of the Buddha image is decorated with a mirror in accordance with the Thai Lue belief.  (updated Sep 2018)
18.77719100.7713411 Wat Hua Khuang (diagonally opposite Wat Phra That Chang Kham). This small wat comprises a distinctive Lanna / Lan Xang-style stupa with four Buddha niches, a wooden hàw trai, now used as a kùti (monk cell), and a noteworthy bòt with a Luang Prabang-style carved wooden veranda. A carved wooden ceiling and a huge naga altar can be found inside. Stylistic cues suggest this may be one of the city's oldest wats though the temple's founding date is unknown.  
18.77493100.7691312 Wat Min Muang (close to Wat Phumin on the same side of Suriyaphong Rd, further west). Its ubosoth's exterior is embellished with elegant bas-relief stucco while its interior is adorned with mural paintings depicting Nan people's way of life, painted by present-day local artists. The Holy City Pillar is enshrined in the four-sided Thai styled pavilion in front of the ubosoth. This pillar is 3 m high, stands on a carved gilded wooden base and is topped with a four-faced Brahma, representing the four virtues on Buddhism. It is an ancient Thai totem that is still very significant. The city pillars were probably erected as a ritual centre for agrarian fertility rites in ancient Thai towns and kingdoms, in the heart of the old cities and just next to the seat of power of a king or a chief.  
18.7738100.7743513 Wat Phaya Phu (on Phaya Phu Rd, west of the police station,). This wat was built during the reign of Pra Chao Phukheng and is about six centuries old. There is a big chedi behind the vihara where are enshrined two ancient Buddha images. The vihara's door are carved with image of mythical giant guards.  
18.75846100.7912714 Wat Phra That Chae Haeng (วัดพระธาตุแช่แห้ง) (2 km past the bridge that spans the Nan River, heading southeast out of town). This temple dates from 1355, built in the reign of Pray Kan Muang. It is the most sacred wat in Nan Province. It's set in a square-walled enclosure on top of a hill with a view of Nan and the valley. The Thai Lue influenced bôt features a triple-tiered roof with carved wooden eaves and dragon reliefs over the doors. A gilded Lanna-style stupa sits on a large square base next to the bôt with sides 22.5 m long; the entire stupa is 55.5 m high.  
18.776155100.77204315 Wat Phra That Chang Kham Woravihan (วัดพระธาตุช้างค้ำวรวิหาร), Pha Kong Rd (opposite the Nan National Museum). After Wat Phra That Chae Haeng, this wat is the second-most important temple in the city. The main viharn, reconstructed in 1458, has a huge seated Buddha image and faint murals. Also in the viharn is a set of Lanna-period scrolls inscribed (in Lanna script) not only with the usual Buddhist scriptures but also with the history, law and astrology of the time. A thammdat (a dhamma seat used by monks when teaching) sits to one side. The magnificent stupa behind the viharn dates from the 14th century, probably around the same time the temple was founded, It features 24 elephant supports similar to those seen in Sukhothai and Si Satchanalai. Next to the stupa is a small, insignificant bôt from the same era. Wat Phra That Chang Kham is also known for having the largest hàw trai (Tripitaka library) in Thailand, now empty.  
18.76961100.7505516 Wat Phra That Khao Noi (on top of Khao Noi hill, 2 km W of town). The hill is 90 m above Nan street level and is accessible by car. The recent temple buildings are nothing special but from the top of the hill, easily accessed by a road, one can see, side by side with a giant Buddha statue, Nan.  
18.78441100.7738517 Wat Suan Tan (วัดสวนตาล) (Suan Tan Rd). Supposedly established in 1456, the Wat Suan Tan (Palm Grove Monastery) is an interesting stupa of the 15th century (40 m high) which combines Hindu/Khmer style motives (stupa in form of prang) and, surmounting it, a Sukhothai-style motive in the shape of a lotus bud, modified in its current form in 1914. The heavily restored viharn contains the Phra Chao Thong Thipun, out of early Sukhothai-style bronze seated Buddha in Bhûmisparsha-Mudrâ. It measures 4.1 m and may have been ordered by the Chiang Mai sovereign Tilokaraj following his conquest of Nan in 1449.

Events[edit]
Annual dragon boat races, Nan River
NOT EXISTING LISTING IMAGE Boat Races. For centuries, long-boat racing have been held annually in provinces with a major waterway. Long-boat racing is one of the traditional rites which commemorates the end of the Buddhist Rains Retreat. It takes place mainly in the 10th and/or 11th lunar months (around Sep-Oct) when the water level is at its peak. Long-boat racing is considered a national sport. Its history can be traced back to Ayutthaya period, around 600 years ago. In that time, boat racing was only a way to keep boatmen fit for national defence. Racing boats are usually made from dugout tree trunks and can accommodate up to 60 oarsmen (commonly dressed in the same colour) in a double row. The festival attracts several hundreds of spectators. Trophies and prizes are given to the winning teams at the end. The races on the Nan River are colourful and unequalled because the boats are brightly adorned with imaginatively designed prows. The cheering squads on the river bank are usually rumbustious and joyful. 
Namatsakan Phrathat Beng Sakat Fair (งานนมัสการพระธาตุเบ็งสกัด) is organized on the full night of the 4th northern lunar month (around January).
Hok Peng Waisa Mahathat Chae Haeng Fair (งานประเพณี "หกเป็งไหว้สามหาธาตุแช่แห้ง") takes place on the full moon night of the 6th northern lunar month or the 4th central lunar month (around the end of February–March). Sky rockets are fired as an offering to the Buddha.
Namatsakan Phrathat Khao Noi Fair (งานประเพณีนมัสการพระธาตุเขาน้อย) takes place on the full moon night of the 8th northern lunar month or the 6th central lunar month (around May). In the festival, there is a ceremony paying respect to Phrathat Khao Noi and sky rockets are fired as an offering to the Buddha.

 Wai Phrathat Festival (งานประเพณีไหว้พระธาตุ). Nan is a town in the Lanna kingdom where Buddhism spread for a long period of time. Within the ancient city, both in Nan and in Pua Disrict, are wats on the hills. Every year, festivals paying respect to the important phrathats are organised as follows: 
Motorbiking[edit]
The top activity in Nan is motorbiking around the area. There are numerous national parks and tons of nature. As always, side roads are safer (and more interesting) than highways so try to stick to those. In general, road conditions are excellent and far fewer drivers are on the roads than other regions.
There is an excellent loop accessible from Nan called the Bo Kluea loop. It is a stunning and empty circuit that could be a day trip, but recommended 2/3 days to allow yourself to stop and take all the wonderful pictures you can.

Banks with ATMs can be found all over town, notably at Sumonthewarat Rd, Anantaworrattidet Rd and Sumon Thevarat Rd.

If you plan on staying in Thailand or South East Asia for long, here are a few options to consider:

Laos: Since Nan is close to the border with Laos, crossing over to Laos is an excellent option for travelers. The nearest border crossing is Huai Kon, which is about 2 hours from Nan by car. From there, travellers can explore the stunning UNESCO World Heritage town of Luang Prabang or head further south to Vang Vieng or the capital city of Vientiane. Make sure that your paperwork is in order before crossing over to Laos; the immigration regulations of Laos are much different than those of Thailand.
Chiang Mai: the cultural hub of Northern Thailand, is about a 5-hour drive away from Nan.
Sukhothai: an ancient city. Also a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
