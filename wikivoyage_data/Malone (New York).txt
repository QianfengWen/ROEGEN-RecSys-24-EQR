Downtown Malone
Malone, founded in 1802 in Northern New York by Richard Harrison, is named for Irish Shakespearean scholar Edmund Malone. Located just outside the Adirondack Park, its streets are lined with fine Victorian architecture.


Understand[edit]
Malone lies outside the "Blue Line" which legally defines Adirondack Park, in a location which geographically represents a transition from the mountainous Adirondack region to the relatively flat St. Lawrence Valley. If you head south from Malone, you'll arrive in ski country or parkland relatively quickly.
Malone's celebrated residents included William Wheeler, Vice President of the United States from 1877 to 1881 under President Rutherford B. Hayes; and Orville Gibson, the world-famous guitar and mandolin designer.

Read[edit]
Laura Ingalls Wilder is famous for writing of the Ingalls family and their life on the frontier, in the Little House on the Prairie books.  But she also wrote about her husband's childhood growing up on a farm near Malone.  9-year-old Almanzo Wilder is the main character of her book Farmer Boy, and it provides a fairly accurate look at life in northern New York in the 1860s.
