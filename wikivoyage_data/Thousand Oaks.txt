Get in[edit]
Map of Thousand Oaks

Thousand Oaks is best accessible by automobile. It sits at the junction of the California Route 23 and United States Route 101 Freeways.  The 101 connects to the San Fernando Valley through Agoura Hills. On the west, it crosses the conejo grade and connects on to western Ventura County and points along the Central Coast. The freeway portion of the 23 travels north to Simi Valley and Moorpark.
The Conejo Valley is also connected to points west and south through several scenic canyon roads through the Santa Monica Mountains. The Oxnard Plain can be reached on Potrero Road, which twists and turns through a steep ravine to emerge near California State University Channel Islands (Formerly Camarillo State Mental Hospital). Visitors can reach Malibu and the Pacific Ocean by Westlake Boulevard (designated as the southern portion of California 23). These roads can provide stunning vistas, and are frequented by bicyclists, motorcycle and car clubs, and the occasional group of joyriding teenagers, so visitors are advised to be aware of their surroundings, share the road, and exercise caution.
Airports in close proximity to Thousand Oaks are Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and Hollywood Burbank Airport in Burbank. There are also small public airports in Camarillo, Oxnard, and Santa Paula, but these are general aviation only and offer no commercial service.
Public bus service is available from Los Angeles, Oxnard, and other towns in the area, but may not be very frequent.

Get around[edit]
Like much of suburban California, Thousand Oaks is designed around travel by car, and walking or biking can be difficult or even hazardous due to traffic. Some of the primary retail and commercial streets do have dedicated bike lanes, however.
Public transit options are minimal, but Thousand Oaks does offer the TOT busline, but service is sporadic and runs only every hour to hour-and-a-half.  The western terminus of Los Angeles County's LA Metro bus #161, connects from the Metro Orange Line stop at Warner Center in the San Fernando Valley at the Thousand Oaks Transit center just west of the southbound US-101 Rancho Road exit.
