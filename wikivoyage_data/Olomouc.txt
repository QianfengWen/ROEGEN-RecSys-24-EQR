Olomouc (Olomóc or Holomóc in the local dialect, Olmütz in German) has the second largest and second oldest historic preservation zone in the Czech Republic (after Prague). Olomouc lies astride the Morava River and is surrounded by the fertile Haná plain. It was the capital of Moravia until 1641 and is the sixth-largest city in the country, with approximately 100,000 inhabitants (2022).


Understand[edit]
Town Hall & Holy Trinity Column on the main square of Olomouc
The first written mention of a settlement at Olomouc is almost 1,000 years ago when the Kosmas Chronicle described a fortified castle watching over the important Morava river ford on the road between Kraków and Prague. Between 16th and 19th centuries, Olomouc served as a strategically important fortress. The city today is the seat of the regional government, the Moravian archbishopric and the oldest university in Moravia, Palacky University (Universita Palackého).
Legend claims that the city was founded by Julius Caesar. It's almost certain that Caesar never visited in person, but it is known that the city began as a Roman military camp with the name Julii Mons (Julius' Hill). This name was gradually corrupted to its present form, Olomouc - which is pronounced 'Olo-mowts'. The Roman influence is a proud heritage of the city, and manifests itself in numerous areas.
Olomouc is doubtless the undiscovered gem of the Czech Republic. It is home to countless beautiful buildings, great culture (home of the Moravian Philharmonic Orchestra), and hundreds of unique restaurants, bars, and pubs. Olomouc is totally off the radar of most tourists, feeling quietly normal and relaxed even on a nice day in July.
As the home to Palacky University, Olomouc is the country’s largest student city by percentage of population. Palacky University (named after František Palacký, the most influential figure of the Czech National Revival in the 19th century) is one of the largest and most prestigious universities in the country and only Charles University in Prague has a longer history. During the academic year, the population of the city is increased by roughly 20,000 students, giving the city a vibrant feeling of life and energy. This is important to remember if you want to enjoy the thriving nightlife of the city - many bars and clubs depend on the student population and close for the summer vacations.
Olomouc has been the seat of a Catholic archbishop for almost 1,000 years, and thus has some of the most beautifully decorated churches in Central Europe - though they do not appear in many travel guides.

Astronomical clock
Olomouc is an exploring sightseer's paradise. A good place to begin is the main square (Horní náměstí or 'Upper Square'), with its huge Town Hall and the Holy Trinity Column (the largest column in Europe), which was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2000. It is the second largest historical square in the Czech Republic. Don't miss the astronomical clock on the Town Hall. It is said to once have rivalled the beauty of Prague's, but was seriously damaged in the World War II and then rebuilt and repainted at the beginning of the Communist regime to reflect worker's values.

Upper square[edit]
The 49.593917.25131 Upper Square (Horní náměstí) is the main square of Olomouc, a beautiful place full of history where you can find some of the most important monuments:

The baroque 49.59394217.2504252 Holy Trinity Column. was built in the early 1700s and consecrated by the Empress Marie Theresa in 1754. With a height of 35 metres, it has dominated the Upper Square (Horní náměstí) ever since and was added to the UNESCO list of World Cultural Heritage in the year 2000. The column features sculptures of the Holy Trinity (predictably), the assumption of the Virgin Mary, all twelve apostles, three virtues and the most important saints of the Baroque period. The base of the column contains a small chapel with amazing acoustics and the raised pedestal is a very nice place to sit and eat lunch. It is one of the traditional rendezvous points in the city.   (updated Jul 2019)
The renaissance Olomouc Town Hall occupies the centre of the main square (Horní náměstí). Its halls and chapel are accessible on guided tours and it's possible to climb the tower each day at 11:00 and 15:00. The ground floor of the town hall houses a gallery, restaurant and the tourist information office. Ask in the office if you are interested in the guided tour and climbing the tower. On the north face is one of only two astronomical clocks in the country. On the west side, there is the Hygieia fountain from 1945, one of the many fountains in the city.
The 49.59459817.2511693 Astronomical clock. It was constructed in the 15th century, but takes its present appearance from the 1950s, during a refurbishment to repair damage inflicted in World War II. Czechoslovakia was under Communist rule by then and the clock reflects the values of the day, the saints and angels being replaced by scientists, sportspeople and labourers. At noon the clock has a presentation that is unique to its structure and construction. There is one other astronomical clock in the Czech lands (in the other ancient capital, Prague), but as a surviving example of Socialist-Realism, the Olomouc Astronomical clock is unique world-wide. It is another popular rendezvous point in the city.   (updated Jul 2019)
The baroque Caesar's Fountain is the largest fountain in Olomouc. It depicts the legendary founder of the city, Gaius Julius Caesar, riding a horse. It is one of the six great baroque Roman-themed fountains you can find in the city.

Eat[edit]
Traditional cuisine[edit]
Olomoucké tvarůžky, local cheese
The traditional cuisine of Olomouc and the surrounding Haná region is an excellent example of Czech cuisine. In addition to more common Czech dishes, it includes some unique local specialties. One of the best known culinary products of the area is the local cheese Olomoucké tvarůžky (also called Olomoucké syrečky). This is a traditional (since the 15th century) Czech ripened soft cheese with very low fat content, pungent taste and strong odor. The cheese is named after the city of Olomouc, but is produced in Loštice, a small city about 30 km away. The cheese is widely available on restaurant menus in the Haná region, where it can be used as a filling in a local variety of Cordon Bleu, or it can be served fried. The dishes containing this cheese can usually be recognized by the word Loštické in their names. Because of the strong odor, do not be surprised when you find some mint sweets (Hašlerka) on your plate.
Garlic soup (česnečka) is available all around the country. The garlic soup of the Haná region (Hanácká česnečka) is one of the best varieties and is usually very strong. If olomoucké tvarůžky are added, the soup is called Loštická česnečka. Because of the combined might of garlic and the strong ripened cheese, it is not recommended if you plan to kiss someone that evening. On the other hand, garlic is very healthy and you should get some česnečka if you have a cold or sore throat.
Hanácký koláč is the typical sweet cake of the region.

Drink[edit]
Mineral water[edit]
Hanácká kyselka is a well known natural mineral water of the region. It is healthy and has a refreshing taste. It is a good choice if you do not want to drink alcohol.

Wine[edit]
Wine is the lifeblood of Moravia. Look into any ‘vinárna’ (wine bar) or ‘vinný sklep’ (wine cellar) and you’ll see an array of characters partaking of the nectar of the vines. Most vineyards are in South Moravia but that has no effect on the drinking abilities of northern Moravians. You can buy good Moravian wine for a picnic from a vinný sklep in plastic bottles that you either bring yourself or you can find there.
If anyone has told you that Moravian wine is inferior to French or Italian wine, don’t believe them. The taste and aroma of Moravian wines vary from their Western European cousins because they are made from totally different varieties of grapes. Svatovavrinecké is a strong, drier red wine, Modrý Portugal is a medium dry and Frankovka is a sweeter red wine. Good white wines are Muller Thurgau and Veltlínské Zelené.

Bouzov Castle
Olomouc is an ideal base for daytrips into the Moravian countryside. Within an hour’s travel by car, bus, train or bicycle there are castles, cave complexes, natural reserves and well-preserved historic towns, including some on the UNESCO world–heritage list.
An enjoyable way of exploring the Olomouc region is by bike. You can rent a bike at the main railway station for 150 Kč/day and follow one of many well marked bicycle tracks. Especially good times to visit are Spring, when there are carpets of white flowers everywhere; and Autumn when the birch, linden, ash, oak and maple trees begin to change. Maps of cycling trails are available from tourist information, news stands and bookstores.
Closest to Olomouc and suitable even as half-day trips are Svatý Kopeček (Holy Hill), the Litovelské Pomoraví protected natural reserve and the swimming holes at Poděbrady and Výkleky.

Svatý Kopeček is the hill that rises up to the east of Olomouc. If you arrive by train from Prague, you’ll have a good view of the building near its peak, which is the Basilica of the Visitation of the Virgin Mary. Surrounded by forest behind the basilica is the Olomouc Zoo[dead link], which is well respected for its work with more than 50 endangered species, included Rothschild’s Giraffes.
The Litovelské Pomoraví nature park stretches from Olomouc to the town of Litovel, 18 km away along the Morava River. The walking and cycling trails across the flat flood plains and through the forests are popular with locals and suitable for outings with young children. Near U Tri Mostu (8 km from Olomouc) is a clearing with the horseriding ranch and outdoor restaurant Lovecká Chata.
Poděbrady is a former gravel quarry that has been flooded with fresh water to form Olomouc’s most convenient natural swimming area. Just on the edge of the Litovelské Pomoraví, it’s connected to the city by walking and cycle trails or town bus #18 which stops on the nearby roadside.
Swimming at Výkleky A prettier place to go swimming though is the old rock quarry at Výkleky, 18 km east of Olomouc. The cycling route is a little complicated, but buses to Lipník stop at Velký Ujezd, a 20-minute walk from Výkleky.
The castles, caves and historic towns are further afield and will require a vehicle or the use of public transport.

Bouzov castle (38 km west of Olomouc) has stood on its hilltop for almost 700years, but its current appearance is from a reconstruction around the turn of the 20th century. It’s a popular location for filming fairytales, and makes a good daytrip from Olomouc, especially when combined with the nearby Javořicko caves.
The Javořicko caves were uncovered in the 1930s and almost 800m is accessible to the public along concrete paths and steel staircases. No special clothing or equipment is necessary-perhaps just a light jacket.
Helfštýn castle[dead link] (35 km east of Olomouc) is one of the largest castle ruins in central Europe and hosts a wide range of cultural events during the summer, including Hefaiston; the International Blacksmiths’ Seminar and Festival.
Kroměříž (35 km south of Olomouc along the Morava River) is on the UNESCO world heritage protection list because of its remarkable baroque chateau and formal flower gardens. The chateau was a location for the Academy award winning Miloš Forman film Amadeus and houses some of the Czech Republic’s most valuable artworks.
Litomyšl (80 km from Olomouc) is one of the Czech Republic’s prettiest small towns and is UNESCO-listed for its renaissance chateau. The chateau is covered with amazingly intricate sgraffito plaster decorations and has one of only five baroque theatres left in the world. Buses from Olomouc to Hradec Králové stop at Litomyšl or you can take the train to Česká Třebova and switch to a local bus from there.
