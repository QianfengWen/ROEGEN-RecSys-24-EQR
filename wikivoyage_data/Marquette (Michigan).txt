Marquette is a city in the Upper Peninsula (U.P.) of the state of Michigan.


Understand[edit]
Whenever talking to a Marquette resident, you'll eventually hear reference to "the Lake".  This nearly always means Lake Superior.  Other, smaller lakes nearby and elsewhere in the U.P. are referred to by their names, e.g., Silver Lake, Teal Lake.
Marquette is a university town, and shares some sensibilities with other college towns around the country. This also means that many, although by no means all, of the young adults are university students.

Map of Marquette (Michigan)


By plane[edit]
46.353611-87.3952781 Sawyer International Airport (MQT  IATA), ☏ +1 906 346-3308. A former U.S. Air Force base converted to civilian use. Direct flights from Chicago, Detroit, and Minneapolis.   (updated Mar 2016)
By bus[edit]
It is possible to take the Greyhound into Marquette.

By car[edit]
If you drive up from the Lower Peninsula, take US-2 along the southern shore of the U.P. for a scenic drive.  With a few local exceptions, all highways in the U.P. are 2-lane.  Passing lanes have been added along US-2 and M-28, to help traffic flow.
Driving in the Upper Peninsula during winter can be treacherous, but the county crews do a good job of clearing, salting, and sanding the major roadways, as do the crews in Marquette. Side streets can be very slippery if snow-covered.

Get around[edit]
Marquette Harbor Lighthouse
Front Street
By car[edit]
For the most part, you would want to take a car, especially in winter when snow or ice covers everything.

By bicycle[edit]
In the summer you can rent bicycles from some of the local bike shops. Marquette has several bike paths, one of which runs alongside the lake from Presque Isle Park  to the intersection of M-28 and US-41. Biking on M-28. Additionally, the back roads around town are rather pleasant and the traffic isn't too harsh.

By bus[edit]
There is also county-wide bus service, which runs a few fixed routes and also offers door to door service.

Hiking[edit]
Hiking opportunities are abundant, with many hikes heading up the big hills in the area that overlook the lake. One can hike up Sugarloaf Mountain or Hogback Mountain and then hike back down to the Lake for a relaxing lounge on the beach. For additional trails, not yet listed here, see City of Marquette's list public trails on its website[dead link].

 Sugarloaf Mountain. This is a good, short hike north of town. Two routes are maintained: one route is a steeper climb, and the other ascends more gradually. Both routes include staircases over rock outcroppings, especially near the summit. The view from the top is spectacular - a great photo spot. Also one of the best places for autumn foliage viewing. (updated Mar 2016)
46.5865-87.382522 Presque Isle Park. A city-owned area with boat slips, picnic areas, trails, a sheltered pavilion, and a refreshment shop. Presque Isle Park is flanked by the Upper Harbor to the south, and by Lake Superior to the east and north, and northwest. It's a city park but feels much bigger. The trail around the perimeter of the island meanders through the woods, occasionally popping out for breathtaking views of cliffs and the lake. Presque Isle Park is found by following Lake Shore Drive northward, just past the north harbor ore dock. The refreshment shop is closed in the winter, as is the one-lane, one-way road around the "Island," as the park is known locally, but remains open to snow-showing, cross-country skiing, and hiking in the winter months.   (updated Mar 2016)
Little Presque Isle  The Little Presque Isle tract is often called the crown jewel of Lake Superior, with its beautiful sand beaches, rugged shoreline cliffs, heavily timbered forests, and unmatched public views. The proposed natural area occurs north and south of Little Presque Point, around the mouth of Harlow Creek. The area is a combination of a wooded dune and swale community and bedrock lakeshore and cliff. The wooded dunes and swales formed as post-glacial lake levels receded, depositing a series of low sandy beach ridges. Since then, the ridges have become forested with hemlock, red pine, white pine, cedar, and balsam fir, while the wet swales that developed between them are now either forested or open wetlands.
Biking[edit]
Marquette has challenging trails for freeride mountain biking.

Follow the bike path from Presque Isle Park, all the way to south Marquette. This path was added within the last 10 years or so, and has become very popular. Just be prepared to share it with pedestrians and the occasional rollerblader.
 Ore to Shore (mountain bike race). In the summer, Marquette is host to the Ore to Shore mountain bike race. (updated Mar 2016)
For good riding advice, stop by Lakeshore Bikes or the Quick Stop Bike Shop. Guys at both shops are avid riders and will be happy to point you in the right direction.
