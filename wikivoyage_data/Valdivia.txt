Valdivia has been called the “Pearl of the South” and the “Beer Capital of Chile". Thanks to its public spaces, order and cleanliness — in addition to nature, gastronomy and culture — it has positioned itself in the 21st century as one of the best cities to live in and visit in Chile.


Understand[edit]
Libertad Walk & Valdivia cathedral
Valdivia is capital of the Los Ríos Region and the province of Valdivia. It is 850 km south of Santiago at the confluence of the Calle Calle, Cau-cau and Cruces rivers, and 15 km from Corral Bay. In 2017, Valdivia had a population of 150,000 people.
It was founded in 1552 by the Spanish conquistador Pedro de Valdivia, under the name of "Santa María la Blanca de Valdivia". It was one of the first cities to be founded in Chile. During the colonial era, it was considered "the key to the southern sea", a strategic enclave for access to the Pacific Ocean. Fortifications were built to protect it from enemy attacks or attacks by indigenous people in the area.
In 1960, the city, along with the rest of southern Chile, was affected by the most powerful earthquake recorded in human history, which reached 9.5 on the Richter scale. The event is known in Chile as "Valdivia earthquake".

Climate[edit]
During the summer months (December, January and February) the average temperature is about 17 °C (63 °F), while in winter the temperature descends to 8.5 °C (47.3 °F).

Museum lovers have an impressive selection of places to visit while in town. Traditional museums for history and culture focused-folks would be the Museo Historico y Antropologico Maurice Van de Maele, located on Teja Island. Built in the site of the former Andwanter family house, its a good starting point to understand the history and culture of the region and the city as well. [1].

Sleep[edit]
Accommodation in Valdivia is generally more expensive than other destinations around, like Pucon or Puerto Varas.

Airesbuenos, García Reyes 550, in the centre of the city. It’s affordable and clean. It is run by new management now and feels more like a business rather than a hostel to relax.

Hotel Dreams, Carampangue st. is also recommended but a bit on the expensive side.
Go next[edit]
