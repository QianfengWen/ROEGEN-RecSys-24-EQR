Hillsborough is a village historically in County Down in Northern Ireland, but nowadays part of Lisburn and Castlereagh District. It's an attractive Georgian village dominated by Hillsborough Castle, the official residence of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and of the King whenever here. It's only 12 miles from Belfast so it's become a commuter town, with a population in 2011 of just under 4,000.
