Boats in Malindi
Malindi and Watamu villages are known for their wonderfull Indian Ocean beaches, which are among the best and most picturesque in Kenya. 


Understand[edit]
Malindi has very nice hotels, visited mostly by Italian tourists. The beaches of Malindi are not as spectacular as the Watamu beaches (25 km to the south), and a disadvantage is that the sea is often coffee brown from the Sabaki River, which is not the case in Watamu.

It is not safe to travel by bus from Malindi to Lamu. You must fly.

Get around[edit]
Hire a tuk-tuk (three-wheeled taxi): most journeys cost Ksh 200 (shillings) or motorbike taxi at Ksh 100.  Cheaper, greener and even more fun is a bicycle boda boda (ride pillion on the cushion over the back wheel) but disappears because of motorbike taxi. Normal taxis are the safest and most comfortable transport, and for your safety should be preferred over tuk-tuks and motorbike taxis at night.

Arabuko Sokoke Forest
-3.3439.9571 Watamu Marine National Park. The park is part of a complex of marine and tidal habitats along the Kenya’s north coast with rich and diverse bird life, fish, turtles and dugongs. Visitors can enjoy the white sandy beaches, snorkeling, water skiing, windsurfing and glass-bottomed boat tours.   :
-3.34940.032 Bio-Ken Snake Farm. If you are interested in snakes visit the Bio-Ken. It is a research centre, which deals with reptiles, especially snakes and snake-bite and houses the largest collection of Snakes in East Africa and is open to the public. This modest-looking place is one of the world's most renowned snake research centres. Passionate guides lead a very interesting tour. There are about 127 snake species in Kenya. Of these only 18 have caused human fatalities and only another 6 could kill you. Another 10 could cause you a lot of pain and the remaining 93 or so, are non-venomous nor dangerous. .
-3.33439.8623 Arabuko-Sokoke Forest Reserve. is a 420 km2 coastal forest near the Watamu Marine Park. It is the largest and most intact coastal forest in East Africa, with 20% of Kenya's bird species, 30% butterfly species and at least 24 rare and endemic bird, mammal and butterfly species. The dense vegetation in this forest type creates a tropical atmosphere as one walks or drives through, the real feel of being “in the woods”. The forest has a network of driving tracks and walking trails. Many sections of the forest are accessible by saloon cars but for best access to all tracks, a 4WD is recommended. Trained guides are available to help one explore the forest. The best times to visit are early morning or late afternoon as most wildlife will hide from the midday heat. The best time to watch birds is from dawn to around 9AM. Park is open from 6AM-6PM. The Mida Creek, a beautiful tidal inlet with mangrove trees is less than 1 km from the entrance to Arabuko-Sokoke Forest. The Creek is a major wintering site for migrant birds.   
-3.307940.01784 Gede Ruins. are one of the principal historical monuments on the Kenyan coast next to Watamu. Hidden away in the forest, the ruins are a vast complex of remains of a Swahili town. It traces its origin to the 12th century and was rebuilt with new town walls in the 15th and 16th centuries. The museum has numerous ruins, comprising mosques; a magnificent palace and houses all nestled within 45 acres of tropical forest that gives a special ambience to this outdoor museum. The Kipepeo Butterfly Project, in Gede, serves as an alternative source of income for forester. It helps farmers to earn their livelihood by breeding butterfly dummies that are exported to butterfly houses in Europe and America. If you like butterflies, you should not miss that.   
-3.03639.9515 Marafa Canyon (Hells kitchen). Marafa is a settlement in Kilifi County. Best known for the Marafa Depression. The Marafa Depression is what’s left behind of a massive sandstone ridge that slowly eroded over time due to the harsh winds, rains, and floods that often hit this region, which is why the locals of Marafa call this geological wonder “Nyari” which means “the place broken by itself.” This canyon designed by the skillful hand of the elements is one of Kenya’s most unique geological sites, where vibrantly tinted rock layers and jagged gorges form a kaleidoscope of colors that illuminate the canyon during sunset, where intense shades of crimson, orange, pink, and white come to life. The road to Marafa is a typical, African packed-dirt road, not great, but certainly not terrible. Make sure that your driver has been there before as its not very well signposted and you may think you are lost. Also make sure the car is air conditioned.The drive does take about a hour from the main road. Once you arrive, you can walk around and into the canyon and out in about an hour, depending on your stamina. It isn't too strenuous, but there are a couple of areas that may be harder for some not nimble. Take water, although there are a couple of places through Marafa town that sells it. Hell's Kitchen is really a freak of nature that is constantly changing the landscape. It's called Hell's Kitchen because it's so hot in the daytime, so its recommend at early morning or late afternoon to see the sunset, which is spectacular because the place literally transforms. Entrance fees are Ksh 300 per person.   .
