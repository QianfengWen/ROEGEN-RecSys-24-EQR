Many of the popular bars in Tuscaloosa are not true bars, but are instead restaurants that serve more alcohol and less food as the night goes on.  Since they are not classified as bars, people under 21 may be allowed in, though they typically will be turned away after 10:00pm (when it becomes too crowded for the staff to keep track of who is underage).  They may also ask people under 21 who are already present to leave at 10:00.

The Strip, a row of bars and shops along University Dr. just off campus.  The Houndstooth is a sportsbar that was once voted by Sports Illustrated as the number one college sports bar in the nation.  Gallete's doesn't have a sign on the front, and is one of the most popular student bars around.  The Strip is geared more towards University of Alabama students due to its proximity to campus.
