San Bernardino is a city in the Inland Empire in California. It is the site of the first McDonald Brothers Hamburger Stand


Understand[edit]
San Bernardino is the largest city of San Bernardino County. The 2000 census shows the population to be 185,401. Of this, 45.2% are white and 16.4% are African-American.  27.1% is cited as "some other race", the majority of which is most likely Hispanic. The city, along with its outlying areas, has a large Hispanic and Spanish-speaking population. 40.4% of the population speaks a language other than English at home.
The closure of the Kaiser Steel facility in nearby Fontana in the 1980s and the closure of Norton Air Force Base in 1994 were cataclysmic to the economy of the city.  Repeated attempts at downtown revitalization have been mostly unsuccessful.  In 2012 the city declared bankruptcy in the wake of a stubborn economic decline. It only emerged from bankruptcy in 2017, making it one of the longest municipal  bankruptcies in U.S. history. The city was further devastated by a mass shooting by two terrorists that took place in 2015. 14 people were killed, and 22 others were injured.
