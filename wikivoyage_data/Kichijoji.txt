Sunroad, a shopping arcade
Kichijoji (吉祥寺 Kichijōji) is a western suburb of Musashino, Tokyo.  The general area also extends into Mitaka.  The highlight is Inokashira Park, with long walking paths surrounding a lake.  The park is filled with both cherry trees and maple trees, making Inokashira Park an excellent choice for both flower viewing in the spring, and seeing the autumn colors in the fall.  Kichijoji once enjoyed a reputation as an artists' colony, and today it is filled with stores from little boutiques to the big department stores.  Kichijoji seems to attract everyone, from upscale shoppers, hip-hop dancers practicing in the train station to musicians playing live music in the park and at the many live houses in the vicinity.


Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
Kichijoji is on the JR Chūō Line (中央線) and Sōbu Line (総武線) from Shinjuku Station,  and the Inokashira Line (井の頭線) from Shibuya Station. Chūō trains depart from Tokyo Station on platforms 1 and 2 (30 minutes; ¥410), and from Shinjuku on platform 10 (15 minutes; ¥230). Avoid the Chuo Special Rapid (中央特快) and Ome Special Rapid (青梅特快), which do not stop here.
Kichijoji is also the terminus of the Keio Inokashira Line (京王井の頭線) from Shibuya. This is the best way to reach Kichijoji from Shibuya (18 minutes; ¥230). The local train takes a long time, so it is often worth waiting for or switching to the express train.

By bus[edit]
Bus service connects Kichijoji directly with Narita Airport and Haneda Airport.  Pick up the bus on the east side of the train station, underneath the JR tracks.  Reservations are highly recommended during peak times, with tickets available at the Odakyu Bus ticket window (小田急バス案内所) on the north side of the station, across from Sun Road.  Buses for Narita depart once every hour or two, take 90-120 minutes depending on traffic, and the one-way fare is ¥3000.  Buses for Haneda run in the morning and evening, cost 50-90 minutes, and the one-way fare is ¥1200.

By bicycle[edit]
When arriving in Kichijoji by bicycle, parking is a concern.  The police are vigilant about bikes parked illegally, particularly near the station and in busy areas.  Illegally parked bikes might be tagged with a warning or impounded.  There are numerous bike parking areas.  The easiest to find is a 24h multi-floor bicycle parking area about 30m north of Yodobashi Camera.  This parking area, and many of the others, has the first two hours free and ¥100 for 12 hour segments thereafter.

Stores in Kichijoji range from galleries and boutiques that are an outgrowth of the area's artist colony past, to the department stores Marui and Tokyu. Foreign chains such as Oshman's sporting goods and Lush have set up shop here as well. Sunroad is a long, covered shopping arcade on the north side of the station.

Nakamichi Street, northwest of the station, has boutique stores and mid-range restaurants. If you're looking for bohemian-styled clothing or accessories, the alleyways running directly between Kichijoji Station and Inokashira Park is arguably the best place in Tokyo to begin your search.

The restaurant is on the west side of the street on the second floor.), ☏ +81 422-24-9490. 11AM-11PM daily. This restaurant serves western-style vegetarian and vegan sandwiches and salads.

This yakitori (grilled chicken) tavern is a Kichijoji institution, first opening in 1928. The interior scene could be straight out of a 1950s black-and-white movie, full of raucous salarymen drowning their troubles in tall glasses of beer. This is the smaller branch shop; the main shop, housed in a marvelous old wooden building from 1953 to 2006, reopened as the base of a modern apartment tower in October 2007.

Buddhist ascetics and quirky jazz pianists alike will feel at home at this cozy "slow food" restaurant. The fare is organically-grown, mostly vegetarian/vegan home-style Japanese.

If that's the case, just pick one of the three daily specials — vegetarian, fish, or chicken. Chances are you'll get something you like, along with some other exotic healthy vegetable that you won't like.

Sleep[edit]
Hotels in Kichijoji are generally quite expensive. An option some weekend travelers choose is to stay overnight at one of several net cafes near the station. Net cafes won't work for travelers with much luggage or in large groups, and they are not as quiet as proper hotels, but they can be used (by Japanese speakers) in a pinch.
