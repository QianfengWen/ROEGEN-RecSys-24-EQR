Paisley is a town in Renfrewshire, on Clydeside in the Central Belt of Scotland, with a population of 77,270 in 2020. It was a major centre for textiles, mass-producing "Paisley pattern" fabrics, though all the mills are long gone. The main reason to visit is its fine abbey, founded by the 6th-century monk St Mirren, or Mirin, who also gives his name to the town football club.


Understand[edit]
Paisley pattern is based on Persian designs
During the 18th and 19th centuries, weaving technology evolved from traditional human-powered looms to great machines in mills driven by waterwheels then later by steam. The parallel advance was in dyes, to make brightly-coloured threads to weave into patterns. Red dye was especially tricky to produce, so red clothing was a status symbol. Then along came the brilliant “Turkey Red”, which was “fast” ie resistant to washing and sun-bleaching, though its extraction from rubia plant root was anything but fast. This was replaced in turn by synthetic dyes, based on the aniline or azo-compounds that heralded present-day colourings.
19th C westerners were delighted by patterned shawls from Kashmir that were based on Mughal or Persian traditional designs with a boteh motif, a decorated pear- or cone-shape. The shawls were quickly copied and mass produced, especially in Paisley where the looms could handle multiple colours. Later technology simply printed the design, often of boteh against a Turkey Red plain background. Paisley pattern became the common name for this style. It was wildly popular until the 1870s, fell out of fashion, then came back during the 1960s era of hippy orientalism. It’s again in a lull at the start of the 2020s as a “Dad’s tie” style, but it’s a strong design which is unlikely ever to disappear.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
55.865-4.4331 Glasgow Airport (GLA IATA) is only 1½ miles north of Paisley town centre. McGill's Bus 757 runs from the airport to Paisley Central Road and Gilmour Street every 30 min, taking 15 min by a zigzag route; you could almost walk it in that time by following Inchinnan Road straight along the White Cart riverbank. Glasgow has flights from many European and UK cities and the Hebrides. That's why faraway places like Tiree and Islay have Paisley postcodes: their mail flies out from here.
You're unlikely to arrive via Prestwick Airport (PIK IATA) 40 miles to the south, as this only has Ryanair flights to Med holiday destinations. But if you do, simply take the train from the airport towards Glasgow, which runs via Paisley, and see Prestwick page for discounts on this route.

By train[edit]
55.847-4.4242 Paisley Gilmour Street has very frequent trains from Glasgow Central, taking 10 min. The first is at 6AM and the last shortly after midnight. They continue to Paisley St James (for football ground), Greenock and Gourock (for ferries to Dunoon), to Inverkip and Wemyss Bay (for ferries to Bute), to  Irvine, Troon, Prestwick town and airport and  Ayr, and to Ardrossan (for ferries to Arran). Gilmour Street station is central in town. It has a staffed ticket office and machines, a WH Smith and vending machines, toilets and waiting rooms. There is step-free access to all platforms.  
55.8402-4.42273 Paisley Canal station is half a mile south of the centre. This is the terminus of a separate line from Glasgow Central, running every half hour and taking 20 min via half a dozen suburban halts in southwest Glasgow (but not Gilmour St). Is this Britain's most evocatively-named railway station, snatching the title from Bristol Temple Meads? It has ticket machines and step-free access to the sole platform.

By car[edit]
The M8 motorway passes Paisley on the north side near the airport. Exits 27, 28 and 29 of the M8 motorway take you to the north-east, north (airport) and north-west of the town. The M77 passes a few miles to the south east of Paisley. This route connects to Kilmarnock and other locations in South Ayrshire. The A737 connects Paisley to Northern Ayrshire.

By bus[edit]




Britain's unluckiest canal 
The canal, designed by Telford and opened in 1810, was built from Glasgow through Paisley to Johnstone, where the money for construction ran out. Nevertheless the completed section was busy with freight and passengers. Some weeks before it opened, the poet Robert Tannahill drowned himself in it. He was just starting to make a name for himself, and is best remembered today for Will ye go, lassie, go?, but was disheartened by publishers' rejections. Then in Nov 1810 a barge overturned at Paisley under the weight of passengers: the water was only six feet deep but cold and hemmed in by embankments, and 85 people drowned.
The canal was made obsolete by the deepening of the Clyde to enable ships to reach Glasgow, and by the advent of the railway, which followed the same route as the canal. The railway also closed in 1983 but reopened as far as Paisley in 1990; the route west of town became a cycleway.


First Glasgow Bus 9 runs daily 6AM-12:20AM from Glasgow Buchanan station via Central railway station, Ibrox stadium and Bellahouston Park to Paisley, taking 50 min. Peak times it runs every 10 min.
Night Bus N9 runs a similar route in the early hours of Saturday and Sunday, from Dalhousie St and Central station roughly hourly 12:20AM to 3:20AM. Otherwise take a taxi for £15-20. A third option is to take the bus to Glasgow airport, which runs 24 hours, then a taxi from the airport. It won't be cheaper, but might spare you a wait in the rain if taxis in the city were hard to find.
McGill's Bus 38 runs every 30 min from Glasgow Hope St to Paisley in 40 min, continuing to Kilbarchan.
McGill's Bus 17 runs every 30 min M-Sa from Glasgow Renfrew St via Partick and Govan, taking an hour to Paisley and continuing to Johnstone.
McGill's Bus 757 from Paisley to Glasgow Airport continues north via Erskine to Clydebank, taking an hour.
McGill's Bus 904 runs hourly from Largs to Paisley, 80 min.
There isn't a bus station in Paisley, the buses stop on High St and elsewhere.

The central sights, campuses, amenities and football stadium are all within walking distance.
Bus: see above for buses to Kilbarchan, Partick, Govan, Erskine, Clydebank and Johnstone. In addition, McGill's Bus 21 / 22 runs from Paisley to Renfrew, where the 21 turns east to Braehead bus station, while the 22 winds west through Inchinnan and Erskine to Rashielee.
Taxis: private hire cars are white and have wheelchair access. There are ranks outside airport arrivals and Gilmour Street Station. Uber taxis ply in Paisley.
Lots of car hire firms are based near Paisley, as they're serving the airport. Look for independents that may undercut the on-airport well-known franchises.

Paisley Abbey
55.845-4.4205561 Paisley Abbey, Abbey Close, ☏ +44 141 889 7654, info@paisleyabbey.org.uk. M-Sa 10:00-15:30PM. In the 12th century abbeys and monasteries were set up across Scotland, including Paisley. King Robert II of Scotland was born here in 1316 when his heavily pregnant mother fell from her horse nearby; she did not survive the Caesarian delivery. In the 16th century Reformation the abbeys were smashed, but Paisley's was already in such poor condition that the reformers hardly bothered with it, though the monks were disbanded. The west side remained in use as a church but the east was a ruin until the 19th century when it was restored, so what you see today is mostly Victorian. It's now a Church of Scotland parish church, entry on Sunday is only for services. Note the royal tombs, stained glass windows, choir and organ. The star attraction is only open on special occasions: lots of old churches have holy relics, but Paisley has a wondrous drain of the 14th century. It's 90 m long, 2 m tall and 2 m wide, and normally flooded, though you can take a virtual tour. Some of what they found within it is on display in the abbey, but not everything, fortunately. Suggested donation £5.   (updated Dec 2019)
Paisley Museum and Galley is closed until 2024 for re-building, along with the Coats Observatory. The Central and Heritage Libraries and the Town Hall are likewise closed; the new building will incorporate all of these. (The independent Thread Mill and Sma' Shot museums are not affected). The museum collections are in a temporary home at 9 High Street. You can view what they call "The Secret Collection" by free guided tour (M-F 10AM-4PM), which needs to be booked a week in advance online or by email to tours@renfrewleisure.com or phone +44 141 618 5129.

"Sma' shot" is a reinforcing fine thread in garments, invisible in the finished product. These 18th- and 19th-century dwellings housed weavers during the "cottage industry" era, when they were independent artisans who owned and plied their own looms. Later came the mills, with powered looms and mass production, and a division into wage-earning labourers and wealthy mill owners that changed society even more than it changed the textiles. The three cottages are furnished to different styles across this era. (They're not affected by the re-vamp of the main museum.) Donation. (updated Dec 2019)
55.842684-4.4110543 Thread Mill Museum, Abbey Mill Business Centre, 12 Seedhill Rd PA1 1JS, ☏ +44 141 847 1111. W Sa 10AM-4PM.

Abbey interior
55.8448-4.43244 Coats Paisley (Thomas Coats Memorial Baptist Church), High Street PA1 2BA, ☏ +44 7522 200163. Thomas Coats founded the multi-national company J & P Coats, makers of sewing thread, zip fasteners and other sundries. He contributed to many local initiatives including restoration of the abbey, and after his death in 1883 his family built this impressive church, almost as large as the abbey. It's of red sandstone in neo-Gothic style. It's now closed as a Baptist church and has been refurbished as an event space. You can admire the exterior anytime and might sneak a peek inside if you wear a suit with buttonhole sprig.   (updated Dec 2022)
Other buildings worth a quick look from outside, but you can't enter, include:
- Russell Institute, Causeyside St next to the Arts Centre, is a 1930s Art Deco building now used as a clinic.
- John Neilson Institution, built 1852 on Orchard Street West, became part of Castlehead High School but is now private housing.
- Blackhall Manor from 1160 is Paisley's oldest building. It's along Barrhead Rd A726 a mile southeast of town and is now a private house.
Fountain Gardens is a pleasant green space just north of the centre.
The tondo memorial at the junction of George St A761 and Maxwelton St B775 commemorates the handiwork of Christian Shaw (1685-1737), a weaver who brought Dutch techniques into the area and effectively founded the textile industry in Paisley. But her fame arose at the age of 11, when she reported a servant for theft of milk, the servant cursed her, and Christian developed mysterious fits. She also brought out of her mouth hair, straw, coal, gravel, chicken feathers and cinders. She blamed this on the servant, and on others, and still others, till 35 people were arraigned for witchcraft. Seven were convicted: one hanged himself, the others were hanged then their bodies burned. Their remains were buried at these crossroads and a metal horseshoe nailed over to prevent their unclean spirits arising. This horseshoe was stolen in the 1970s, as was its replacement, but the modern tondo incorporates a horseshoe.

Notable ministers were John Witherspoon, who signed the US Declaration of Independence on behalf of New Jersey, and Robert Burns who campaigned for government measures to relieve urban poverty, which by the 19th century was far too great for local effort. The Arts Centre building needs a major upgrade and remains closed in Dec 2022.
