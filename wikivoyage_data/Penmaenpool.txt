Replacing the ferry, the wooden bridge was built in 1879 by the Penmaenpool Bridge Company under the auspices of John Leigh Taylor of nearby Penmaenuchaf Hall. The toll bridge is a Cadw-registered building. Cadw [dead link] is the official guardian of the built heritage of Wales. 
Do[edit]
 Old Railway Footpath. Walkers and cyclists can travel along the old Cambrian Railway line which is now a public path following the course of the Mawddach Estuary. The shale path extends from the outskirts of Dolgellau via Penmaenpool to Arthog. 
 Mawddach Way. Penmaenpool is also a start/end point for one of the suggested three section of the 49 km long distance footpath walk 'The Mawddach Way' which is a circular walk around the Mawddach Estuary.
