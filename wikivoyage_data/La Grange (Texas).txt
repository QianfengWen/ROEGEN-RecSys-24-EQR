These are ruins of a brewery owned by German immigrant Heinrich Ludwig Kreische along with his tomb overlooking the town and kind of a cool place to check out. Also there's a monument to the failed Mier Expedition (basically a startup event of the burgeoning Stephen F Austin colony as it was toying with a means to independence that really turned sour - as in no survivors).
