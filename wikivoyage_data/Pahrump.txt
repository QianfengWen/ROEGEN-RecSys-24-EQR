Pahrump is a unincorporated town in Southern Nevada about 60 miles (100 km) west of Las Vegas, near the Nevada-California border. It is a commuter town for Las Vegas. Its population in 2019 was 29,000, and it is the tenth largest city in Nevada.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Pahrump was first inhabited by the Southern Paiute. It was slowly inhabited by European settlers in the late 19th century. They reportedly chose the name for Pahrump after the original Southern Paiute name Pah-Rimpi, or "Water Rock," so named because of the abundant artesian wells in the valley. Because of the artesian wells, the new inhabitants of Pahrump Valley began large ranch-style holdings, mostly over 1,000 acres (4 km²) in size. On the ranches, alfalfa and cotton were grown, and livestock were raised.
Since the late 1970s, Pahrump has had steady growth, increasing from about 2,000 residents in 1980 to 22,000 in 2017. Pahrump is an archetypal example of an exurb. Almost all significant agriculture has ended in the valley, and the surface aquifers have been drained over the years.

Summers in Pahrump are generally hot and dry, with occasional pushes of monsoonal moisture beginning in early July. Being at a similar elevation to Las Vegas, daytime highs in summer average within a few degrees of Las Vegas. Record highs are similar between the two cities as well. A typical day during June through August brings temperatures around 100 °F (38 °C), and occasionally 110 °F (43 °C). Nighttime temperatures, however, are noticeably cooler. This is due to the lack of an urban heat island in Pahrump, allowing for intense radiative cooling after sundown. As a result, summer nights are pleasantly warm, bottoming out in the mid-60s or 70s (F). Pahrump's location in a valley leads to large diurnal temperature ranges, typically 30 °F (−1 °C) but occasionally 40 °F (4 °C). By late August and early September, the sweltering summer heat noticeably tempers down. September is the gateway to fall, which brings very pleasant weather. October highs are generally 80 °F and nighttime temperatures in the 50s.
Like other locations in the Mojave desert, winters are typically mild, with occasional pushes of cold air from the north. Daytime highs average from the mid-50s and 60s, but low temperatures hover around freezing for most nights between December to February. Spring brings pleasantly warm temperatures and cool evenings. Like other locations in the Mojave desert, this is the windiest time of year. Snowfall is rare in Pahrump, but there is generally at least one snow day per year.

Gambling[edit]




If you win...
Chances are if you win it big in Pahrump and you are a foreigner you will get dinged by the IRS 30% withholding tax. That $10,000 slot winning can dwindle quite quickly if that is taken off the top. Not to worry though you can reclaim your gambling winnings tax through a 1042-S form. You should get this from the casino, and don't lose it: it is your starting ticket to getting your gambling winnings back.


Opportunities to gamble are plentiful in Pahrump. It is state law that all gamblers must be at least 21 years of age. Even if you are at least 21 years old, you are required to bring to the casino a valid ID that shows your current age or complete date of birth (e.g. driver's license, passport) as proof of your age. Photocopies of valid IDs are usually not considered valid. In-house security makes rounds of inspections to check compliance. If you are under age or without a valid ID to prove your age and found in the gambling premises, hotel staff will ask you to leave, and could ask the metro police to issue you a citation. Moreover, underage gamblers cannot collect any jackpot; such bets are void and the casino will at best return your wager before asking you to leave the premises. There is a curfew for anyone under the age of 18 and police are comfortable transporting violators to a juvenile center.
