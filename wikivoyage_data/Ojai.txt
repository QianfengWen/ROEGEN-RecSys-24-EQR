Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
California State Routes 33 and 150 both go to the western side of the city, and Route 150 also enters it from the eastern side.

Get around[edit]
The downtown area is fairly small and quite easy to get around on foot, but for further exploration you will of course need a car.

34.402192-119.3416022 Lake Casitas (Go west on Route 150). This is quite a large reservoir that has an island in the middle of it during wet years.

The region north of Ojai is protected national forest land, although a lot of the forest was burned by the Thomas Fire in 2017, which was one of the largest wildfires in history and was partially the reason for the terrible mudslides in the area a few months later.

Go next[edit]
Ventura - Located on the coast 22 miles east of Ojai, Ventura is home to many interesting shops, the historic Mission San Buenaventura, and is the gateway for excursions to the Channel Islands National Park.
Santa Paula - 17 miles to the east, Santa Paula advertises itself as the "Citrus Capital of the World" and was an early center of California's petroleum industry.  It is home to the California Oil Museum, housed in the historic Union Oil Building.
Carpinteria - This small oceanside town is located 22 miles west of Ojai and offers a salt marsh preserve, tide pools, and a seal and sea lion rookery that is active from December through May.  During the first weekend in October Carpinteria plays host to nearly 100,000 visitors at its annual avocado festival, which features the world's largest vat of guacamole.
Carrizo Plain National Monument - Slightly more than an hour north via Highway 33, this remote national monument is home to the largest remaining native grassland in California. During wet years it boasts spectacular wildflowers in the spring, and Soda Lake is an important wintering area for waterfowl when precipitation is sufficient to flood the seasonal lakebed. The park is also home to Painted Rock, a Native American site that has been adorned with pictographs over thousands of years. Services are extremely limited, with just a small visitor center, two primitive campgrounds, and a handful of marked trails available.
