Understand[edit]
Few towns in Germany can match the charm of Cochem. Cochem is rated as one of the prettiest villages along the Mosel, and it is a favourite place for visitors. Legend, folklore and a rich web of history is woven into every street. Little seems to have changed for centuries. The town has many fine buildings, quaint cottages, black & tan guild houses, and winding streets. The town square, lined with half-timbered houses, is particularly fine. Cochem Castle (Schloss Reichsburg) dramatically rises above the town. 
It is in an area of outstanding natural beauty in the Mosel river valley, between the Eifel and Hundsrück.
It is surrounded by high elevations, steep vineyards and typical wine villages, offering tastings, festivals and genuine hospitality. Cochem is the center of the Mosel wine trade. Fondly known for its regional wines due to the presence of the many vineyards and small family run wineries in the nearby towns along the river.
Early in the 19th century the first modern tourists came to Cochem. Mostly English artists. They recorded the romance and beauty of the Mosel Valley, in their drawings and paintings. The development of Cochem into the first tourist center on the Moselle came in the 1930s.
The Mosel river flows between the maintown and the Cond district, across the river by one of two connecting bridges. A wide boulevard runs along the river, with a number of river-view hotels, restaurants, bars and seating areas. From here you can take river tours at frequent intervals.
