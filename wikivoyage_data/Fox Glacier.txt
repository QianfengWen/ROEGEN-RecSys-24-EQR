Fox Glacier village is in "Glacier Country" on the West Coast of New Zealand's South Island. Tucked discreetly into the rainforest-clad foothills of the Southern Alps, it has a stunning outlook across surrounding farms and offers breathtaking views of New Zealand’s two highest peaks, Aoraki/Mt Cook and Mt Tasman. The tiny township was founded from a gold strike which soon petered out, and it now mostly serves as a base for visitors to its large icy namesake. There's a quiet, intimate village atmosphere compared to the other glacier town, Franz Josef.


Understand[edit]
Landscape[edit]
New Zealand glaciers are unique in all the world in descending through rain forest.
At 13 km long, Fox Glacier / Te Moeka o Tuawe is the longest New Zealand glacier, falling 2,600 metres (8,000 ft) from its start just below Aoraki/Mt Cook and Mt Tasman to where it terminates in lush temperate rain forest just 250 m above sea level.
The rapid descent and accessibility make the West Coast's glaciers unique.
A special combination of climate and shape means that Fox Glacier moves approximately 10 times quicker than other valley glaciers around the world, making its terminal face and ice features look quite different from one year to the next. At Fox Glacier this is due to the funnel-like shape of the glacial valley and the huge nevé (the snow accumulation area, at the top of the glacier). Fox Glacier’s nevé is 36 km², bigger than the whole of the city of Christchurch!

Climate[edit]
The weather in the area is very variable and prone to change, so bring layers. Mornings are generally clear, though clouds start to gather in the afternoon, which may lead to cancelled tours, slippery walks and poor photography conditions. Winter is drier and there might be fresh snow on the glacier, but the roads will be icier.

Get in[edit]
43°28′12″S 170°0′14″EMap of Fox Glacier
Drive on State Highway 6. The drive from Franz Josef is about 30 minutes. Although the distance between the two is not a lot as the crow flies, the road is one of the windiest you will ever drive on as it crosses an entire mountain range. 

From the south, travel from Queenstown approximately 4½ hours by car, Wanaka approximately 3 hr by car, Haast approximately 1½ hr by car.
From the north, travel from Christchurch approximately 5½ hr by car, Greymouth approximately 2½ hr by car and Hokitika approximately 2 hr by car.

-43.46618170.017452 Fox Glacier Information Centre, Sullivan Road, ☏ +64 3 751-0044. 
Get around[edit]

A picture postcard view of the Southern Alps from Lake Matheson
Gillespie Beach's quartz pebbles and black sand
Sunrise at Lake Matheson, sunset at Gillespies Beach and glacier viewing in between makes for a pretty great day.

-43.4414169.967411 Lake Matheson (5 minutes' drive from Fox township). Take the 4.4-km walk around the lake to see the beautiful reflection of Aoraki/Mt Cook and Mt Tasman on its dark waters. The lake was formed during the last Ice Age retreat by Fox Glacier 14,000 years ago. The track is well maintained, and there are boardwalks and specially-made platforms for getting the right angle for your pictures. The best light is at dawn, and it's about 20 minutes to the first lookout (and 20 minutes back if you don't want to walk the whole way) and 40 minutes to a floating pontoon. 
-43.45469169.956612 Peak View Lookout. Drive down Cook Flat Rd for 10 km west of the township past the Lake Matheson turnoff until it becomes an unsealed road for the best view of the peaks of Aoraki/Mt Cook and Mt Tasman. There's a picnic area and a plane table which can be used to identify the different peaks of the Southern Alps. 
-43.40827169.82853 Gillespies Beach (Cook Flat Rd, then Gillespies Beach Rd). An 11-km drive down a twisting unsealed road through a rimu rainforest leads to a camping area. From here, walk a bit more and you'll find yourself on a black sand/quartz pebble beach on the Tasman Sea. Near the beach entrance is the rusted and overgrown historic gold dredge, remnants of an old mining settlement. Several kilometres up the beach you can visit a seal colony on Galway Beach, which is a three-hour round-trip walk. Be warned, the number of sandflies here is ridiculously high at the beach, so don't forget to bring insect repellant! 
Do[edit]
Glacier viewing[edit]
Fox Glacier, close-up
The terminal face of the Fox Glacier
A walk to see Fox Glacier is a rather ethereal experience, as it passes through a valley carved by the moving ice. There are several signposts that signal when and where the terminal face of the glacier used to be.

-43.49553170.042841 Unguided walk, Fox Glacier Access Rd (8 km from the town centre to the glacier car park, turn left before Fox River bridge). It's roughly a 1- to 2-hour round-trip trek to the glacier. The track can be cumbersome in places, requiring balance to scramble down slick rocks and across small streams, but still easy enough for inexperienced trampers. Unlike Franz Josef, the glacier will not be in sight for some parts of the walk, but you can get much closer to it. Do not proceed past the barriers at the terminal face of the glacier, as the area is extremely dangerous. Two tourists were killed by falling ice after they crossed the barriers in 2009. If you want to step onto the ice, take a guided walk. As of Apr 2019, the Fox Glacier access road (north road of Fox River) is closed due to landslide. Glacier View Road (south road of Fox River) is also closed to vehicles but you can walk on the road. Free. 
-43.4651170.017192 Fox Glacier Guiding, ☏ +64 3 751-0825, toll-free: 0800 111 600. The most experienced New Zealand glacier guiding company, offering guided trips onto the glacier. There's the Fox Trot: half-day walk, Flying Fox: heli-hike, Nimble Fox: all-day walk, Fox Trail: Terminal Face walk, Fox It Up: ice-climbing adventure, Chancellor Dome day and overnight heli-treks. The heli-hikes have limited spaces, so booking beforehand could guarantee a spot. $69-700. 
Scenic flights[edit]
Several helicopter services operate out of Fox Glacier township and offer breathtaking flights over the glacier and the Southern Alps, weather permitting. It's a marvellous aerial view that demonstrates the vastness of the slow moving frozen river, with an option to make a snow landing on the nevé. An early morning flight could get you to the top of Fox Glacier, just as the sun rises over Aoraki/Mt Cook.

-43.46511170.017343 Fox & Franz Josef Heliservices (Fox Glacier Guiding Building), ☏ +64 3 752-0793, toll-free: 0800 800 793. Flights last for 20-40 minutes, from a simple fly-around and glacier landings, to an extended flight for a closer look at Aoraki/Mt Cook, Mt Tasman and a loop towards Franz Josef Glacier. $195-375. 
 Skydive Fox Glacier, toll-free: 0800 751 0080. Take a tandem jump. This is probably the best place in New Zealand to skydive thanks to its amazing scenery. $225-500 depending on height and options.
