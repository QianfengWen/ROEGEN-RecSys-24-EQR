Hamamatsu Castle
Hamamatsu (浜松市) is the largest city in Shizuoka, Japan.


Understand[edit]
An important industrial hub, the city is home to many companies, including Honda Motor Company, Roland Corporation, Kawai Pianos, Yamaha, Sony, Suzuki Motor Company and Hamamatsu Photonics as well as a large air base for Japan's defense force.  Consequently, the city is well known for producing motorcycles, musical instruments and optoelectronic sensors among other things.
For its population of just under a million people, Hamamatsu is a uniquely international city. It is home to almost 16,000 Brazilians, mostly from São Paulo, Paraná, and Belém, as well as 3000 immigrants from Peru, giving it the highest per-capita concentration of South Americans in Japan. The city also has sizable immigrant populations from Indonesia, South Korea, the Philippines, China, Nepal, and Bangladesh. The ethnic diversity here provides the city with a wide array of ethnic stores, restaurants, bars and clubs.

Tourist information site[edit]
The local tourist association has a multilingual guide site.

By plane[edit]
Geographically, the closest airport to Hamamatsu is in Shizuoka (FSZ IATA), 45 km away. However, flights there are very limited: Domestic services are operated by ANA and low-cost carrier Fuji Dream Airlines to destinations including Sapporo, Fukuoka and Okinawa, and international flights serve Seoul, Taipei and several destinations in China.

You can reach Hamamatsu by taking a limousine bus to Shimada Station (25 min, ¥500) and then taking the JR Tokaido Line (45 min, ¥840).
Fuji Dream Airlines passengers have access to a free shuttle bus to Kakegawa Station (35 min away), otherwise a shuttle to Kakegawa costs ¥1000. From Kakegawa, Hamamatsu is 30 min away by local JR train (¥500) or - if the connection is convenient - 11 minutes by shinkansen (¥1360).
It's also possible to take shuttle taxis all the way to Hamamatsu for ¥1500, but these must be reserved at least one day in advance and bookings can only be done in Japanese.
The closest international airport is Chubu International Airport (NGO IATA) in Nagoya. Entetsu operates a bus called E-Wing which runs directly to Hamamatsu Station every 45-60 min. The trip takes 2 hr 10 min and costs ¥3100. The fastest option by train is to take the Meitetsu Limited Express to Nagoya and change to the shinkansen (90-100 min, ¥5650, shinkansen is free with the Japan Rail Pass).
If coming from the other major international airports, Kansai (KIX IATA) or Narita (NRT IATA), the fastest way to reach Hamamatsu is to take the JR limited express to Osaka or Tokyo, respectively, and change to the shinkansen. These trips are free for Japan Rail Pass holders.

By train[edit]
Hamamatsu is on the Tokaido Shinkansen Line, and the JR Tokaido Line, which serve major cities like Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka.
There are a handful of Hikari and Kodama services that stop in Hamamatsu. From Tokyo, there are two all-stopping Kodama trains that depart every hour, making the run to Hamamatsu in about 2 hours. Faster Hikari trains depart once per hour, running to Hamamatsu in 90 min. The fare is the same for both, at ¥8290 for a reserved seat. Kodama trains have more unreserved seats than the Hikari; an unreserved seat costs ¥7770.
There are hourly departures to Hamamatsu from Osaka and Kyoto on either a Hikari (90 min from Osaka) or Kodama (2 hr from Osaka). The reserved seat fare is ¥8940 from Shin-Osaka and ¥8290 from Kyoto.
Discount bullet train tickets include the Puratto (Platt) Kodama Ticket (Japanese), which offers a discount for Kodama trains if you purchase at least one day in advance. You get a reserved seat, and a coupon for a free drink to purchase before you board the train. With this ticket a trip to Hamamatsu costs ¥6600 from Tokyo (2 hr), ¥3700 from Nagoya (50 min), ¥6600 from Kyoto (1 hr 45 min) and ¥7100 from Shin-Osaka (2 hr). In addition, discounted tickets can be purchased in advance through Japan Railways' official SmartEX App, available in English and other languages - look for Hayatoku fares.
Regular local train services on the Tokaido Line will get you from Tokyo to Hamamatsu in approximately 4–5 hours for ¥4430, while from Osaka it takes around the same amount of time for ¥5080. Several train changes are required along the way.
Train service from Nagoya take as little as 1 hr 40 min on the regular Tokaido Line (¥1940), changing at Toyohashi, or as little as 30 min on the Shinkansen (¥4420 unreserved seat).

The Sunrise Izumo and Sunrise Seto trains make overnight stops in Hamamatsu on runs to Izumo and Takamatsu, respectively.

By car[edit]




Japan's Windy City
Hamamatsu gets little snow in winter, but it often feels much colder than it really is, thanks to what is known as the enshu-no-karakkaze, a very strong and dry wind which blows across Lake Hamana and into the city. If you come here in winter, hold onto your hat because the enshuu-karakkaze is one of the strongest urban winds in the world.


The Tomei Expressway, the main artery through the Chubu region, bisects Hamamatsu. The city is served by the Hamamatsu and Hamamatsu-Nishi interchanges. It is around 8 km from Hamamatsu Interchange to Hamamatsu station.
Further to the north, the Shin-Tomei Expressway serves Hamamatsu through the Hamamatsu Hamakita Interchange. It's about 17 km from there to Hamamatsu station.

By bus[edit]
Hamamatsu serves as a major stop for bus travel throughout the country, thanks in large part to its location near the Tomei Expressway. The main stop for buses is Hamamatsu Bus Terminal, next to Hamamatsu Station. This is not to be confused with Hamamatsu-cho Bus Terminal, which is located in Tokyo.
Through buses may stop at the Hamamatsu Kita bus stop of the expressway, a good distance from Hamamatsu station.

From Tokyo[edit]
Daytime buses from Tokyo take around 4 hr 30 min, with most runs to Tokyo in the morning and from Tokyo in the evening.

Other buses operate a route from Shinjuku Expressway Bus Terminal (¥3880) and Tokyo/Shibuya (¥3810) to Hamamatsu, with four round-trips per day.
