Tullamore is the county town of County Offaly, and more or less in the centre of Ireland. It's traversed by the Grand Canal, which is navigable by leisure boats from Dublin to the Shannon and beyond. The town is best known for Tullamore Dew whiskey. The Tullamore Show is held near the town every year. It's a one-day agricultural and livestock show held on the second Sunday of August.


Understand[edit]
Grand Canal at Tullamore
Tulach Mhór means "great mound", indicating a long-vanished defensive earthwork, and Tullamore like the rest of County Offaly was an Irish territory outside the Anglo-Norman "pale" of Leinster. That changed in 1570 when it became part of the Tudor plantations. The Moore family ousted the O'Molloy clan, building the first version of Charleville Castle, and acquiring an earldom. There were no great battles or sieges here, and little to distinguish the place until on 10 May 1785 Tullamore was the improbable site of the world's first aviation disaster.
Air accident investigation had not yet been invented so documentation is sparse, but it appears to have involved an unmanned hot-air balloon, with lift created by a fire burning in a basket, effectively a giant Chinese lantern. The first manned flight had been in 1783 by the Montgolfier brothers in Paris, and balloons were being sent up for amusement and publicity all over Europe. The Tullamore balloon was launched on a breezy day and soon collided with a chimney; its fire took hold of a thatched roof, spread to another and another, until the whole of Barrack Street was ablaze. Some 130 houses were destroyed. There were no fatalities but the loss of so many homes and livelihoods was a disaster. The town shield nowadays depicts a phoenix rising from the ashes, and the story grew that the town centre represents a spate of re-building after the fire, but there was similar urban development all over Georgian Britain and Ireland.
There was clearly no future in aviation, and modernising transport meant canals. The Grand Canal from Dublin reached Tullamore in 1798, a great boost to trade and industry, including the local whiskey distilleries. The canal fell into disuse in the 20th century but has been restored throughout its length for leisure boating. The other legacy industry was peat-cutting: this ramped up in the 1950s to reduce Ireland's dependence on imported fuel, and Boora Bog west of town was one of several exploited. Peat smoke is nice in trace amounts in whiskey but horribly polluting in the kilotons that began to blow west, to fall as acid rain upon the Dutch, and excavation wrecked the wetland environment. This couldn't go on, try as Bord na Móna might to cloak their operations in a green flag, and from the 1980s peat-cutting ceased and the site was reclaimed.
Tullamore has always been the county town, so local government is a significant employer, as is Midland Regional Hospital north side of town. In 2022 the population was about 16,000.
The Tourist Office is on Bridge St, open M-F 10AM-5PM, Sa 11AM-3PM.

By boat[edit]
"A Boat will leave Dublin on Wednesdays and Saturdays at Ten o’clock, AM: loaded or not the Proprietors pledge themselves to be punctual to the day and hour." - Dublin Evening Post 17 March 1829
Tullamore is on the Grand Canal which stretches from the Liffey at Dublin to the Shannon 30 km west of town, and is navigable throughout. The Shannon links Limerick on the Atlantic with Athlone in the Midlands and Carrick-on-Shannon to the north, whence another canal reaches Lough Erne in Northern Ireland. The Grand Canal also connects with the Barrow Navigation, which heads south through Carlow to New Ross and Waterford on the south coast. Check Waterways Ireland for current status of locks, moorings etc.

The town is small enough to get around on foot. You'll need your own wheels for outlying sites. 
Buggy's Coach 835 makes a figure-of-8 around town then round the south-edge retail park. 
Practical have car hire in Tullamore, but you'll probably do better to hire from the airport.

See[edit]
53.2766-7.491 Church of the Assumption, 19 Chapel St R35 CX74. Hard to miss as it is the tallest building in town. This Roman Catholic church was completed in 1986 to replace the 1906 structure which burned down. There are stained glass windows and giant timber roof beams. The black cross was made from charred fragments of the older church. Free. (updated Mar 2021)
53.2721-7.49812 Town Park along Cormac St is a large park with fountains and a large play area for kids. There's a bowls pitch, a skateboard park, and plenty of parking. The graveyard holds two victims of the Battle of Tullamore, fought on 22 July 1806 between the King's German Legion and Irish militiamen. Problem was, they were supposed to be on the same side against Napoleon, but a punch-up led to a mass brawl with 3 deaths and 42 injured.
53.2606-7.52863 Charleville Castle, Charleville Rd R35 AX51 (2 km southwest of town off N52), ☏ +353 57 932 3040. Jun-Aug daily 11:00-17:00. A curious mixture of the grand and the tumbledown. This Gothic pile was built 1800-1812, in the flush of victory over the revolutionary French, with money they didn't have. (One regular visitor Lord Byron would appreciate that situation.) It was occupied on-and-off, fell derelict in the 20th century but was restored from 1973, and this continues. So parts are still a sorry ruin, but there's a splendid facade and interiors, admission to these is by guided tour. It's set in fine oak forests and has often hosted big events and festivals. They've tried to market it as a "haunted house" but the ghostly spectre that most visitors encounter is the website puff for events that folded a decade ago.  (updated Mar 2021)
53.252843-7.50064 Tullamore D.E.W. Heritage Centre, Clonminch, Tullamore, R35 E027 (1hr from Dublin and Galway, just off Exit 5 on the M6, or by train from Houston Station or Galway Station), ☏ +353 57 931 9760, info@tullamoredew.com. M-Sa 10AM-6PM; Sundays & Bank Holidays 11AM-7PM (Visitor Centre). Moved to the current building by the modern distillery in 2021. The previous building was a quayside warehouse next to the Old Distillery, which operated from 1829 and prospered from the 1880s under its general manager Daniel E. Williams, he of the brand initials and author of the ad slogan "Give every man his dew". In the 20th century Irish whiskey lost out to competition from Scotch, and the emphasis switched to Irish Mist liqueur. The distillery closed in 1954, with the brand sold and production moving to Midleton near Cork, and the site was re-developed. In 2010 the brand was bought by William Grant & Sons, who built a new distillery on a greenfield site by Tullamore south bypass. From Summer 2021 they resumed in a new "Tullygate" visitor centre by the modern distillery, allowing visitors to see much more of the production process. Tours at the new location run Monday to Saturday at 11AM, noon, 1PM, 2PM, 3PM, 4PM and on Sunday and Bank Holidays at 11AM, noon, 2PM, 3PM. €43 for distillery tour (18+). (updated Feb 2024)
* 53.277628-7.4936425 Offaly History Centre, Bury Quay, Tullamore (next to the former Tullamore Dew Distillery), ☏ +353 57 932 1421, info@offalyhistory.com. M-F 9AM-4:30PM; closed Sa Su. It's nominally a museum, but is primary a bookshop. The Offaly History Centre also offers services for individuals researching Irish genealogy. (updated Feb 2024)
* 53.326029-7.5195376 Durrow Abbey, Durrow Demesne, Co. Offaly. A religious complex 7 km north of town off N52. The abbey itself disappeared in medieval times but there are old grave slabs and a High Cross. The present church is circa 1800 and Abbey House is from 1920. The fabulous illuminated Book of Durrow was created circa 650 AD, perhaps not here; it's now on display in TCD Library Dublin along with the Book of Kells. St Colmcille's Well is 200 m east and draws a pilgrimage on the Pattern Day of 9 June. The site is generally free to stroll and is set amid old oak woods (Doire means oak grove, as in Derry). Parts may be closed off as unsafe, and there's been decades of acrimony between owners, developers and the government over maintenance of the site. (updated Feb 2024)
53.3695-7.50287 Kilbeggan Distillery (Locke's Distillery), Bridge St, Kilbeggan N91 A621 (10 km north of Tullamore via N52), ☏ +353 57 933 2134, info@kilbeggandistillery.com. Daily. One of the oldest licenced distilleries in Ireland, from 1757, with its heyday under John Locke from 1843. But in the 20th century pot-distillation struggled, and investors were deterred by a big 1948 scandal to put the whiskey on the black market, with senior politicians implicated. Production ceased when the Locke family firm went bust in 1957. The site was demolished to make pigsties then a depot for mechanical shovels. In 1982 it re-opened as a museum, then in 1987 distillation re-started: the series of owners had always paid the £5 annual fee to maintain the licence. The distillery was modernised in 2010 and is now part of Beam Suntory. Adult €8.  (updated Mar 2021)
53.28-7.6168 Rahan is a village 7 km west of town with remains of a monastery from the 11th and 12th century.
53.218-7.7289 Lough Boora is a peat bog 20 km west of town where peat was extracted commercially 1950-1970, but which is now reclaimed as a wetland and recreation area. The original lough has been drained but extraction created two new lagoons, which have walking trails and hides for bird-watching. "Sculpture in the Parklands" are a series of sculptures dotted around the area. It's free to visit any time.
53.347-7.27810 Croghan Hill to the east rears up to 238 m, so it's prominent in this low terrain and has wide views. Ascend from Croghan village to its south. On its eastern slope is an old graveyard and the remains of a medieval church, while at its western foot lie the remains of a medieval settlement, church and castle. Old Croghan Man, who died circa 200-300 BC, was found nearby, but was young, tall and high-status when he was tortured and killed: he's now on display in the National Museum in Dublin.
