Flims is a small town of 2,800 people (2018) in the Surselva region of Graubünden in Switzerland.


Understand[edit]
Flims is a historic town in the Surselva valley yet not in the district of Surselva it is in Imboden. Flims has several distinct neighbourhoods, the most recognised being Flims Waldhaus and Fidaz, Fischeisch is a neighbourhood at the top of Flims, the town is centred on the base station in winter and the main street in summer. Flims is also part of a 220 km² ski resort known as the 'Alpenarena', the 'Weisse Arena', Flims Laax Falera or just Laax. The third of these names is the most descriptive, the resort links these three villages together, yet all three retain distinct identities. From the Flims base station lifts run to Plaun and Foppa. 
Traditionally the economy of the town was based on agriculture, farmers would bring their fresh milk into town every week for villagers to buy, cutting the long grass in the meadows by hand. Flims nowadays relies on skiing and tourism, with a UNESCO World Heritage Site to its name, the iconic Flimserstein, the aquamarine Lag la Cauma (Lake Cauma) and being the meeting point of Romansch and Germanic Swiss cultures and languages, Flims certainly has much to offer.
