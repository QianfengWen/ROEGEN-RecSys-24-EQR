Get in[edit]
Foreign nationals do not need a visa at the authorized arrival and departure points in Kish Island. At Kish International Airport, the officials will take your photograph and fingerprints, and stamp your passport, allowing you to stay up to 14 days on the island. If you are western, you may be sternly questioned as to the purpose of your visit. Make sure you bring all verification paperwork including hotel reservations with phone numbers, etc.
Upon arrival at Kish Airport, all female passengers will be immediately escorted to a room and very politely ordered to wear headscarves and long robes to cover their entire body. The clothing is available at the airport, and passengers are expected to return them when leaving Kish. Female visitors may be detained for a period of time under the perception that they 'might have difficulty finding their way around the island'. However, the staff in general are very polite, but speak little English.

If you are energetic, walking is your best option. However, like the rest of Iran, there are plenty of taxis but without meters. It is advisable to agree the fare in advance, and to make sure that the driver understands where you want to go. The majority of taxis on the island are Toyota Camrys and are fully air-conditioned. The normal fares are usually US$2-5 depending upon the distance, which is never too long as the island is rather small.
Be careful to check your change as some taxi drivers will take advantage of tourists and attempt to short-change.
