Tyler is the county seat of Smith County, in eastern Texas. It boasts the nation's largest municipal rose garden and hosts the Texas Rose Festival each October.


Understand[edit]
Tyler is referred to as the Rose Capital of America because of its large role in the rose-growing industry; about 20% of commercial rose bushes produced in the U.S. are grown in Tyler and Smith County and more than half of the rose bushes are packaged and shipped from the area.
The city is named for President John Tyler in recognition of his support for Texas' admission to the United States. In 2021, its population was about 107,000.

Drink[edit]
Smith County (which Tyler is within) is a partially dry country in Texas. This means you cannot purchase liquor within city limits, unless it is being consumed in a restaurant or club. You can generally purchase wine and beer in grocery stores or other approved retailers. If you want to buy bottles of liquor for off-premise consumption, you have to drive out of the county (~20 miles or so).
There are several wineries and breweries that have popped up in and around Tyler:

 The Kiepersol Estates Winery. Nestled in a beautiful 33-acre vineyard of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sangiovese, Syrah, Tempranillo, Mourvedre, Grenache, and Muscat de Alexandria grape vines. Hand-planted in April of 1998 and May of 1999, Kiepersol's first vintage was in 2000. They also own the KE Cellars inside the city limits of Tyler, where you can purchase Texas-made and -bottled wines. Additionally, there is a nice restaurant attached to the side. (updated Jul 2021)
