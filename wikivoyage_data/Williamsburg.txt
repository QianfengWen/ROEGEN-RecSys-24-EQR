For other places with the same name, see Williamsburg (disambiguation).

Williamsburg is a city in southeast Virginia. Settled in 1632, it was the capital of Virginia from 1699 to 1779 and in 1926, John D. Rockefeller Jr commissioned a restoration project to bring Williamsburg back to its former colonial glory. During this period, 700 modern homes were demolished, colonial buildings were renovated, and more than 400 buildings were reconstructed on their original foundations. Today, the Colonial Williamsburg district in the center of town is a popular tourist center and people visit in droves to immerse themselves in the nation's colonial history.


Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The main airport servicing Williamsburg is Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport (PHF IATA), in Newport News. This airport is serviced by Delta and American Eagle.
Williamsburg is also within one hour's drive (via I-64) of both Richmond International Airport (RIC IATA), in Richmond, and Norfolk International Airport (ORF IATA) in Norfolk. Both airports offer a wider range of airlines and more competition, which may result in lower ticket prices.

37.2412-76.717851 Williamsburg-Jamestown Airport (FAA LID: JGG) (just outside of town). Small airport for civil aviators. 
By train[edit]
Williamsburg Amtrak Station is just north of the central district at 468 North Boundary Street. Amtrak trains run to Richmond, Washington DC, New York City and Boston via the Northeast Regional line.

By car[edit]
Williamsburg is easily accessed by car with Interstate-64 running northeast to Richmond and southwest to Newport News, Hampton, Norfolk and Virginia Beach.
For a more scenic view, VA State Route 5 from Richmond runs along the James River past many of the fabled James River Plantations.  US Route 60 and VA State Route 143 parallel I-64 for much of its length east and west of Williamsburg and are alternative routes into the city.

By bus[edit]
37.27648-76.708582 Greyhound, 468 N Boundary St (Williamsburg Transportation Center). Tickets aren't sold at this stop (buy them online or at another station). 
Get around[edit]

Public transportation is limited to Oleta Coach Lines and the Williamsburg Area Transit Authority (WATA) buses. They stop at the transportation center (the Amtrak station), the visitors center, and various spots throughout the town. They are mostly designed to serve the community, but the Yellow line goes to Busch Gardens and Water Country USA. Most people get around by car.
The intersection of Richmond Road, Boundary Street, Jamestown Road, and Duke of Gloucester Street (non-vehicular, but with many pedestrians) near Colonial Williamsburg and the historic district is the most notorious (and confusing) feature of Williamsburg driving.  Dubbed by locals as Confusion Corner, right-of-way confusion can result in accidents or close calls.  For tourists in this area, traffic heading west on Jamestown Road and east on Richmond Road toward Boundary Street has the right of way; all other traffic must stop or yield.  This intersection is at the corner of the College of William and Mary's campus, so be alert for pedestrians in this area.
Free parking in the restored area is difficult to find and is generally limited to two hours.  Colonial Williamsburg offers hourly and daily parking in numerous short-term lots near the restored district.  Parking at other shopping areas is generally free, though it can get crowded at peak seasons.
The Commonwealth of Virginia and Department of Motor Vehicles has certified local bus company Oleta Coach Lines, Inc for a bus route from the Williamsburg Transportation Center to shopping malls around the Hampton Roads area.  The Williamsburg bus route runs from Williamsburg to Hampton, to Newport News then back to Williamsburg.  It runs twice on Tuesdays.
