Vincent Thomas Bridge
San Pedro is a district of Los Angeles County on the South Bay harbor, immediately east of the Palos Verdes Peninsula.


Get in[edit]
San Pedro is located at the southern end of the Harbor Freeway (CA-110), which you can take directly from Downtown L.A., or you can take the Vincent Thomas Bridge (CA-47) west from Long Beach.
Metro provides transit service, although public transit to San Pedro is somewhat limited. The fastest service to Downtown L.A. is the Silver Line express bus service, although it requires an extra fare and not all buses travel all the way to San Pedro; check the schedule in advance. Regular fare $1.75; Silver Line fare $2.50. You can also take the 232 from LAX and transfer to the 550 at Western Ave.

Get around[edit]
Metro operates a bike share system, with several stations scattered along the harborfront in San Pedro and neighboring Wilmington. Single trips are $3.50 for 30 minutes of use (credit or debit card required), or you can load a monthly pass onto a TAP card for $20 which gives you free rides shorter than 30 minutes and $1.75 for every thirty minutes after that.
