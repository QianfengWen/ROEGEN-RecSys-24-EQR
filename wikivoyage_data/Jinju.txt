Jinju and the Nam River from the fortress

Understand[edit]
Orienting yourself in Jinju is easy.  Jinju is a central city among the regions in the south of Korea. The town is cut in half by the Nam River (Namgang), with Jinju Fortress, downtown, most hotels, the commercial-residential sprawl and the intercity bus station all on the north bank.  The train station and the express bus station lie on the south bank. Jinju is a small and medium-sized city with a population of almost 350,000 (2022), but it is an educational city with two colleges and three national universities.

By plane[edit]
Jinju's Sacheon Airport (HIN IATA), 20 km away from the city in Sacheon, fields flights daily to and from Seoul's Gimpo Airport and twice a week to Jeju Island.  Buses to the city center take 25 minutes and cost ₩3,000.
Alternatively Busan's Gimhae International Airport is one and a half hours away, and also serves international routes.

By bus[edit]
Bus is the easiest way of reaching Jinju.  There are departures every ten minutes from Busan's Seobu (Sa-sang) terminal (1½ hr, ₩6,900) and from Masan (1 hr, ₩4,000), as well as every 20-30 min from Seoul's Gangnam Express Bus terminal (4 hr, ₩20,000).  Check which bus terminal you will be arriving at as the Intercity Bus Terminal is centrally located within walking distance of Jinju Fortress while the Express Bus Terminal is located a bit further south, on the south side of the river.
There is a bus that goes directly from Incheon International Airport to Jinju. It takes 4 hours, and it costs about ₩36,000.
Buses from Busan Nopodong Bus Terminal to Jinju depart roughly every 50 minutes.
The main highway in Jinju is National Highway 10 or Namhae Expressway.

By train[edit]
There are daily 5 services to Seoul (6½ hr) and 4 to Busan (3 hr). Jinju is served by passenger service with KTX at Jinju Station along the Gyeongjeon Line.
Jinju has two train stations. 35.179395128.0882611 The old train station is near downtown, on the south side of the river (near Manggyeong-dong or Juyak-dong). A new train station is near Gyeongsang University, at the southern end of town. This new train station is functioning; you can get on and off the train there. Getting to and from the new train station: the city buses 126, 127, 131, 132, 134, and 135 go there.

Get around[edit]
By bus[edit]
Buses inside Jinju cost ₩1300 and go almost everywhere in Jinju. You can buy a reloadable bus pass at convenience stores like GS-25. These cost about ₩10,000 and may come with a bus ride or two already on them, depending on the kind you buy. Each ride is discounted to ₩1,250 as well.
Buses are available but you'll find it hard to use it unless you speak Korean, since bus stop signs are almost exclusively in Korean and your average bus driver won't speak English.
City bus routes that go to the KTX station: 126, 127, 128, 131, 132, 134, 135, 151.

By bicycle or on foot[edit]
Highly recommended.  Jinju is a small city, so if you have a detailed street map, you can simply get around on foot. If you’re touring the city, you’ll probably be walking, as there is no bicycle-rental system.  If you live here, a bicycle is a nice investment.
The Nam River is lined with a lovely park that features outdoor gymnasiums, multiple-lane bicycle paths, and 24-hour restrooms. Cars are generally not allowed.
Numerous mountains with hiking trails can be found around the city.

By taxi[edit]
The basic fare for regular taxis is ₩2800, with a surcharge of ₩100 applied according to time and distance.  In deluxe taxis, the basic fare is ₩4500 and the additional fare increases in increments of ₩200. Jinju is a small city, so you will rarely spend more than ₩7,000 on a taxi ride.
Deluxe taxis are black with a yellow sign and are more expensive than regular taxis although provide a better and more comfortable service. Regular taxis are silver or yellow.

If you want to buy an international phone card, you can look in stores like 7-Eleven, CU, or GS25.  If the convenience stores don’t have any, then you can check the Asian food stores.  Option 1: There’s a Chinese shop next to the Intercity Bus Terminal that has international phone cards.  Option 2: there’s a Pakistani shop near City Hall.  It's just off the road that goes past City Hall, in the Homeplus direction, down an alley, on the right.  They’re cheap and last for about 4 hours.

Some people with sensitive stomachs should use caution when dining in Korea as some of the local cuisine is heavily spiced with copious amounts of pepper and garlic.

Churches[edit]
International English Church [dead link] (Jinju Sungnam Church, 성남교회) meets on Sundays at 13:30 for English-speakers, including foreigners and Koreans. They host an American-style Thanksgiving dinner for the Jinju community every November.
Jinju Church (진주교회) is international and non-denominational. Worship followed by lunch is on Sunday at 11:00. There is also Bible study after lunch for all who want to stay.

Air quality[edit]
Air quality is fine. Jinju is a smaller city, so the air is clean.  However, some Koreans sometimes wear different types of masks outdoors for allergies, smog and yellow dust storms (mostly in March–April). Mongolian yellow dust storms were regarded as dangerous long before industrialization began in Asia. Now these storms pick up trace amounts of toxins in the Chinese industry belt.

Other[edit]
