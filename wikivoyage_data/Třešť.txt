Nativity scenes[edit]
Building nativity scenes ('betlemy' in Czech) is a tradition in Třešť families since two hundred years. At first, paper figures were used, and they were replaced by wooden craved ones since second half of the 19th century. Nativity scenes are constructed as dioramas with landscape made up of tree stumps, moss and other natural materials, sometimes also including running water and moving elements. The 3D landscape merges into a painted background. Nativity scenes in Třešť are regularly rebuilt by their owners for each Christmas season.
