Understand[edit]
Thasos is a green, mountainous island with many picturesque bays and sandy beaches. The landscape is similar to Chalkidiki or Sithonia.  It is an ideal holiday destination for families and people who want to relax at wonderful and not overcrowded beaches. There are a number of interesting antiquities to visit and there are enough beach-bars and clubs for entertainment and night life. A fire in September 2016 destroyed parts of the forests but this does not affect its beauty as a top holiday destination. In general the east side is much more crowded than the west side. People who like to have more space on the beach are better off with the west side, while those who want more action the east side is the better choice.

History[edit]
Earliest settlements are known from the Neolithic era. About 1500 BC, Thasos was taken by the Phoenicians, and by their knowledge in metallurgy, they were the first to exploit the mineral resources of the island. The island was then taken over by the Thracians until the Greek Ionian tribe displaced the Thracians in the 7th century BC. Gold and silver mining and trade flourished during this time and brought prosperity to the island. In 492 BC, the Persians conquered the island, which led to an economic decline. In 464 - 404 BC, Thasos was occupied by Athens and served as a colony of wood and metal supplies. 340 BC Philip II, king of the Macedonians, took over Thasos. In the period from 281 - 202 BC, Thasos was independent, until it was connected to the Roman Empire in 196 BC. After the division of the Roman Empire, it belonged to the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) from 330 AD. In 1455 AD, Thasos passed over to the Turks and was freed by Greek troops by 1912 in the Balkan War. In the Second World War, Thasos and larger parts of northern Greece were handed over by the Wehrmacht to Bulgaria, who had to leave these areas with war dead.

Get in[edit]
Since Thasos does not have its own airport, the connection runs through the airport Kavala (near Chrysoupolis). From there it is 12 km to the ferry at the village Keramoti (ferry time Keramoti-Limenas, 45 min). By taxi the way from the airport to the ferry costs about €20, to Kavala the cost is €40. The bus connection is bad.
From Thessaloniki Airport, there is a bus to the KTEL Macedonia bus station (1 hour), which is the bus station for intercity buses. From there, buses go to Kavala (2½ hours) every hour. From Kavala you either take a ferry to Thasos or a bus from the bus station to Keramoti (1 hour) and from there by ferry to Thasos. Alternatively, go by rental car from Thessaloniki Airport to Kavala/Keramoti (2½-3 hr). Some car hire companies from Thasos also have rental cars at the airport. Many cars rented on the mainland are not allowed to go onto the islands.
Ferries: There are 2 ferries for vehicles and passengers to Thasos 1) Kavala-Scala Prinos (1½ hours, one-way adult ticket €6 as of August 2020) and 2) Keramoti-Thasos Town (Limenas) (45 minutes). The timetables vary depending on the season. Since the island is close to the mainland, the  ferry costs are comparatively low, so that many weekenders and camper vans visit the island. In addition to normal ferries, a  high-speed hydrofoil operates only for passengers between Kavala and Thasos City (Limenas).
Get around[edit]
The island has one main road which circles the perimeter. There is a bus service[dead link] during summer. Taxis are common and can be called from most restaurants, bars and supermarkets (taxis after midnight need to be booked in advance). Car and bike hire is possible from many of the larger towns and villages. To really see the interesting parts of the island, especially the mountain villages, a car or motorbike is needed. Normal cars are not allowed on dirt roads but some of the nice beaches an attractions can be reached on dirt roads only. Hire a 4WD at least for the days you want to go off-road.

See[edit]
Must see for short time visitors:

Thasos town
Panagia
Aliki
Giola
Theologos and its waterfall
Kastro
Megalo Kasaviti
Most tourists rent a car at least for one day to explore the island. As there is only one ring road the villages are described starting from Thasos town clockwise. From the main ring road the mountain villages can be reached via side roads or dead-end roads. If you visit the main attractions only a tour takes from 4-6 hr.

40.776224.70411 Thasos (Θάσος, also known as Limenas, Λιμένας). The largest village on the island with the harbor for ferry boats to Keramoti and is deep enough for sailing boats and offering power connection too. Visit the old fishing harbour with the customs building and a beach with beach bars. Continue the walk to reach the viewpoint called “Karnagio” with an old chapel and a nice restaurant to sit. Nearby the old harbour are the ruins of the ancient city and the Archeology and Ethnology Museum. From the old port take a walk to the Amphitheater and ahead to the Acropolis and a castle ruin. The ascent is a bit difficult, but well worthwhile because of the fantastic views. In the center of Limenas are commercial streets with souvenir shops, restaurants, fast food, police, banks, travel agencies and some nightlife. The beachfront Agios Vassillios Chapel, about 200 meters west of the ferry port, is also worth a visit. Behind the chapel is an archaeological excavation area with remains of cemetery, tower, temple, chapel. (updated Sep 2019)
Scala Potamia & Golden Beach
Monastery Archangelos
Water Falls in Maries
Kastro
Scala Sotiros
Giola pool
40.730724.72882 Panagia (Παναγία). A romantic small mountain village with old, traditional houses, restaurants and a few souvenir shops on a beautiful wooded hill. The "Dragon's Lair" is a cave near the village and is also worth a visit because of the scenic environment.   (updated Sep 2019)
40.727824.75713 Scala Panagia (Σκάλα Παναγία). It consists solely of a cluster of hotels, campgrounds, restaurants, and more lining the exquisite "Golden Beach," renowned as Thasos' premier coastal destination. No central hub exists here; instead, visitors can find everything they desire. Towards the northern tip of the beach lies a charming, picturesque fishing harbor, which serves as the departure point for various excursion boats. However, the harbor isn't ideal for sailboats, particularly in windy conditions, as the anchors can be problematic due to the presence of seagrass. During the summer season, the beach becomes extremely crowded. (updated Sep 2019)
40.715724.72894 Potamia (Ποταμιά). An old mountain village high on a wooded hill and is less touristy than Panagia. It is certainly worth a walk through the village. Because of the altitude location, it is getting a little cooler here in summer than at Scala Potamia.   (updated Sep 2019)
40.708824.75885 Scala Potamia (Σκάλα Ποταμιάς) (next to Scala Panagia at the Golden Beach). is, like Skala Panagia, a pure tourist spot on the "Golden Beach" bay with beautifully located restaurants and hotels. The small harbor is only partially suitable as anchorage for sailboats, since at night is very wavy. (updated Sep 2019)
40.666624.76176 Kinira (Κοίνυρα). A small, purely tourist place without a real center. It consists of a cluster of hotels, restaurants, etc. (updated Sep 2019)
40.605324.74127 Aliki (Αλυκή). A "must-see location" with a very romantic beach and the remains of an ancient temple. Aliki is not a village. It consists of only a few restaurants but it is one of the main tourist attractions of Thasos. It's the landscape that makes it so unique. In summer it is overcrowded and it may be hard to find a parking space. Aliki is also a peninsula of archaeological interest where an ancient quarry of marble is situated that was used from the ancient to early Byzantine years and was one of the main Greek areas regarding the mining and exportation of marble. Owing to the dismantling and sale of the coveted white marble a relatively large and prosperous settlement and a port suitable for transport was built. Alikes was evacuated abruptly due to the strike of a heavy earthquake in the 5th century AD. This is the reason why today the marble rocks are discernible under the surface of the sea. The residents of Aliki migrated to other areas of the island because their economic basis (the quarry) had disappeared. However, some people continued to live in the settlement on fishing business and merchandising until its total destruction by pirates in 1651. 5 km from Aliki there is the 40.596824.70191 Monastery "Archangelos", a very interesting complex on the mountainside. It's a convent with old icons and full of flower pots and it is a good viewpoint over the sea and the south shore of Thasos. A few kilometers after the monastery is another famous spot in Thassos, called 40.586624.67878 "Giola". It is a natural pool overlooking the sea. The descent to Giola is signposted. The trip goes on dirt roads to a parking lot and from there walk down the mountain. The walk is very strenuous, especially in the summer. During high tide, the pool is clean and inviting, but after days without high tides, no fresh water from the sea enters the pool, and the water gets dark and dirty.  (updated Sep 2019)
40.589424.65519 Astrida (Αστρίδα). An abandoned village that had been rebuilt partially for tourist use. It is well worth seeing. (updated Sep 2019)
40.61124.608510 Potos (Ποτός). One of the touristic centres of Thassos, especially popular in younger people. Its a strong tourist embossed larger village with everything needed for such a place, like good shopping, many restaurants and bars, beaches full with music and beach parties and appropriate nightlife. It's certainly worth a visit.   (updated Sep 2019)
40.659824.692511 Theologos (Θεολόγος). A quiet and beautiful "must-see" mountain village where the houses are mostly built of stone and covered with stone slabs. Also the museum is worth seeing. Going through the village, you will reach the restaurant "Neromillos" (Water mill) after about 500 m after the cemetery. The water mill is a wonderful place to stay, eat and drink. Another attraction is the old stone bridge. Behind the Agios Dimitrios church is a footpath to the photogenic bridge about 200 m away. In the valley between today's Theologos and the ruins of the settlement on the other side there are some beautiful little 40.660824.699412 waterfalls and pools (called Kefalogourna), in which you can refresh yourself. The path to the waterfalls begins shortly before the end of the village and is now signposted and expanded. There are several waterfalls and pools cascading one behind the other. You have to approach it from the side of the embankment as there is no way. Only the top, largest waterfall has a path and after the community created the path it belongs to the "must see" on Thasos. The scenic circular route paved with bumpy stones between the Greek and the former Ottoman district (today only ruins) of Theologos leads from the church of Agios Dimitrios down into the valley, over the old stone bridge to the chapel of Archangel Michael and further uphill between the ruins of the former houses, a fortification and the ruins of a tower back to the church of Agia Paraskevi. The peace and quiet and the beautiful view of Theologos is worth it.   (updated Oct 2020)
40.627824.575213 Limenaria (Λιμενάρια). The second largest village on the island and has a lot of tourism. The long sandy promenade is lined with restaurants, gift shops, cafes, pubs, etc. But even in high season the beach is not overcrowded. There are supermarkets, banks, doctors, police station in the center. The new build Marina is deep enough for sailing boats. From Limenaria leads a new paved road to Kastro fillage. 3 km from Limenaria direction Scala Maries is the well-known beach Tripiti. Its famous for its rock with a hollow.   (updated Sep 2019)
40.670424.65514 Kastro (Κάστρο). In the mountainous center of the island, it used to be a dilapidated village. It has been partly rebuilt, but it's more the landscape that makes it worth going there. The environment is more impressive than the place itself. From Limenaria a winding but well-maintained road leads to the village. Two small restaurants invite the diner to linger in clean mountain air. If you want to visit the church, you get the key in the restaurant next door. At the end of the village is the former castle, from which only part of the fortification walls are preserved. On the castle grounds today stands a chapel and an ossuary. A small waterfall is located near the village and can be reached on foot or 4WD from Kastro. To get to the waterfall take the dirt track on the east side of Kastro, which is a 3-4 km journey and goes through a beautiful and pristine forest. It's most impressive to see during the spring as it tends to dry up during the summer. Alternatively you can reach the waterfall from Theologos by vehicle.   (updated Sep 2019)
40.691124.621415 Maries (Μαρίες). A very original old mountain village. Interesting is also the location a few miles outside the village with a small lake and a little waterfall. During July/August when there is no rain, that waterfall is just a runlet. If you continue on the dirt road from there, after 13 km you will reach the Ipsario, the highest mountain in Thasos. The road there is not paved and therefore may not be used with normal rental car, only with 4WD. Between Scala Maries and Maries lies the 40.667524.58741 Convent  Monastery of the Assumption  (Ιερά Μονή Κοιμήσεως Θεοτόκου Μαριών), which is worth a visit, as well as the photogenic 40.669424.58442 Convent ruin Stavronikita located above the monastery. An approximately 400-m-long path leads from the parking lot of the monastery up to the ruins.   (updated Sep 2019)
40.642424.517316 Scala Maries (Σκάλα Μαριών). A nice touristy village with a picturesque small fishing harbour. (updated Oct 2015)
40.693124.554517 Kalirachi (Καλλιράχη). One of the larger mountain villages with narrow streets and is not very touristy. Worth seeing is the 40.695224.56312 Chapel Metamorfosi above the place. A 5 km long dirt road (4WD only) leads to just below the summit. From there you walk about 300 m steeply uphill to the chapel. The view is breathtaking from there. Approximately 300 m before the village turn left into the side street and then turn left again at the parking lot in the village. After about 5 km dirt road you reach the parking lot of the chapel.   (updated Sep 2019)
40.706724.534218 Scala Kalirachi (Σκάλα Καλλιράχης). A street village with a beautiful small harbor that invites you to linger. The harbour is deep enough for sailing boats and offers also power connection for boats. Otherwise very quiet. (updated Sep 2019)
40.717124.574719 Sotiros (Σωτήρας). A small mountain village with magnificent view and is well worth seeing.  (updated Sep 2019)
40.728524.548320 Scala Sotiros (Σκάλα Σωτήρος). An elongated street village with a remarkable small fishing port. (updated Sep 2019)
40.740224.577421 Prinos (Πρίνος). A larger village with shops, supermarkets, bakeries, restaurant, pubs but less touristy. A popular attraction of Prinos is the outdoor market (bazaar). It takes place in the town's open square every Monday morning. Visitors can obtain fresh fruits, vegetables, clothing, footwear, household items and at the same time enjoy a unique lively atmosphere. (updated Sep 2019)
40.7588624.5768422 Scala Prinos. Pier of the ferry to Kavala. Beautiful sandy beaches, restaurants, hotels, a campsite, otherwise rather quiet. (updated Aug 2023)
Kazaviti
40.720524.617123 Mikros Prinos (Μικρός Πρίνος, also known as Micros Kasavitis). A formerly dilapidated mountain village that has been rebuilt in a touristy way. From here, there is a tortuous road leading to the 40.707424.59893 Monastery "Panteleimonos ' at high altitude in the mountains. The ride and the spectacular views are more worthwhile than the visit of the monastery. (updated Sep 2019)
40.724824.623824 Megalos Prinos (Μεγάλος Πρίνος, also known as Megalos Kasavitis). A "must-see" mountain village with old, mostly renovated houses and a very beautiful central square under plane trees with restaurants. It is delightfully cool even on the hottest summer days. Above the village lies the Chapel 40.729124.62984 Agios Joannis, in a beautiful environment that can be reached via a 4 km-long dirt road. (updated Sep 2019)
40.75724.637125 Rachoni (Ραχώνι). Not a tourist village. An interesting sight is a church directly before the village. It is a nice cool place on hot summer days under large trees and with waterways. A tavern is also there. Above the village is the island's only dog sanctuary. Approximately 3 km dirt road above the village is the small worth seeing chapel 40.709624.59785 St. Johann (Agios Joannis) in an impressive mountain landscape. The way is signposted. You can drive with 4WD, but also make a worthwhile walk up.  (updated Sep 2019)
40.780424.613626 Scala Ragoni (Σκάλα Ραχωνίου). A small quiet harbour village with few tourists. Some kilometers north are several nice and crowded beaches and bays. (updated Sep 2019)
40.762924.636927 Ag. Georgios (Άγιος Γεώργιος). A small old village with almost no tourism but with quite a number of foreigners that build houses there. On the right side of the road to Georgios and Rachoni lie the ruins of an old watermill. It is located between the two villages and is not easy to find in the bushes but well worth seeing. The chapel 40.757624.65836 Agios Georgios above the village is worth a visit. (updated Sep 2019)

Ancient sites tour[edit]
It is recommended to visit the ancient sites of the island in 2 tours in Thasos town and 1 in Aliki and Thimonia. The first leads up to the Acropolis of Thasos town and is also recommended for people who are less interested in ruin sites, because of the beautiful landscape and the wonderful vantage points. The second tour stays within the village and is less spectacular.
1) Thasos Town
Tour 1: It starts in the immediate vicinity of the old 40.780824.71311 war harbor at the 40.779824.71222 Agora, the economic center of the ancient city, a kind of marketplace with shops, religious and cultural sites. Even if only the foundation walls and a few pillars are present, the agora is the most interesting ancient area in the center. Directly following the agora are the 40.780224.71473 passages, a stone walled access from the residential quarters to the agora, the 40.778424.71294 Odeion, a small 2nd-century theater. and the 40.779824.71495 Arthemis Shrine from early Hellenistic times. From the agora you go northeast passing the 40.7807324.714246 District of Dionisos, the 40.781524.714357 Sanctuary of the Poseidon and Wagon Gate, the 40.782324.715318 eastern residential area and Chariten Tor slowly uphill under shady trees towards the headland. There stands the very photogenic 40.7853324.715789 St. Nicholas Chapel on the foundations of a 5th-century basilica. The view from there of the landscape and the sea is breathtaking. Below the chapel you can see the beach bar Karnagio. From here, the trail now leads steeper and much more strenuous uphill to the 40.782124.717710 Theater from the 3rd century with beautiful views of Thasos. Performances take place here during the summer months. Further above is the 40.778124.719711 Akropolis. In 1204, the Venetians built a castle in the eastern part of the Acropolis out of the ruins of the temples there, whose ruins are hidden between trees and barely visible from the village. If one follows the path one reaches the 40.776824.71812 Sanctuary of Athena. Only the foundations of the 5th century BC are left of the temple. Nevertheless, the path is worth it, as the view of Thasos and the surrounding mountains makes up for the effort. A narrow pawn leads east to 40.776324.717213 cave sanctuary of the Pan from the 4th century BC. Again, it is more the view that is worthwhile. From here you go back to the city.
Tour 2: It can be done well in less than 1 hour as you stay within the flat area of Thasos town and is really worthwhile only for people really interested in ancient ruins. It's best to start from the 40.7788224.7091214 Early Christian Basilica. If you follow the road away from the coast you will reach the 40.7779224.7100715 Hercules (Heracles) Sanctuary. Here too, only the foundations of temples and buildings from the 5th or 6th century BC are preserved. Now follow the signs along the Pier de Vambez road to the 40.775524.709116 Gate of Zeus and Hera past the remains of an Arch of Honor for Emperor Caracalla. The Gate of Zeus is the most elaborate and best preserved gate of the city, but also almost exclusively preserved as foundations. From there one arrives at the interesting remainders of the south wall to the 40.774424.712817 Silent Tor that is quite well preserved. From here it goes back towards the harbour.
2) Aliki
Tour: 3 starts in Aliki. The entrance to the archeologic site is free and you can explore the place walking on market trails. The archeological site of Aliki includes the ancient 40.6012424.7395818 marble quarry, the remains of an ancient settlement, a double sanctuary and two paleochristian basilicas. The 40.6050324.7424319 ancient settlement of which only the ground walls remained is on the opposite site of the taverns. An interesting inscribed sarcophagus is worth to see. Following the path uphill for about 50 m you reach out at the 40.6033824.7428520 ancient sanctuary. The remains of the sanctuary consist of two constructions with both ionic and doric architectural elements build during the 6th-5th centuries BC. dedicated to god Apollo as protectors of ships and sailors. At the stairs that are at the facade of the sanctuary, there are inscribed names of many sailors that had arrived at the island in order to ship marble. The sanctuary was abandoned during the early Byzantine era, with Christianity becoming the dominant religion. The two churches were built in the 5th century AD and destroyed by an earthquake. Going from Aliki about 1 km towards Limenaria the 40.606624.717221 Ancient Tower of Thimonia is signposted. A field road leads up to the tower that needs good ground clearance if you drive up or walk for 10 min. The ruined Hellenistic tower was probably part of an ancient settlement but no excavations have taken place an the knowledge about this place is very limited. The nice view from the tower is more worth than the ruins itself.

Mining site tours[edit]
The mining on Thasos can look back on a highly developed metallurgy that began about three and a half thousand years ago and thus plays a significant role in the Aegean region. Probably in the late Bronze Age, beginning at the latest in the early Iron Age, took place an intensive and until the Byzantine period ongoing ore smelting. The ores mined in tunnels and open-pit mining contributed to the wealth of the island in ancient times and are an important part of the history of the island. Unfortunately, the wealth also aroused greed and so in the history of the island mostly foreign powers exploited the ores. Some former open pit areas are easily accessible and today interesting and photogenic "lost places". Also galleries are accessible, but only with a local guide to recommend and experience walking in caves and only with appropriate equipment.

 Metalia Beach. The beach at Limenaria with its metal industry ruins is one of the must see attractions in Thasos. The German industrialist Friedrich Speidel succeeded in 1903 in lengthy negotiations by the Turkish Sultanate to obtain a license to exploit the zinc-lead-silver-ore deposits on Thasos. The ores (400-500 tons per day) were mined mainly in open pit about 2 km NE from Metalia beach (Vouves), transported by a mine railway and in the four round shaft kilns (which you can still see today), processed and then shipped. In the ruins of the halls on the beach were ore mills, wet processing, electrical center and rolling mills. The installations were occupied by French troops at the beginning of the First World War and plundered as enemy German assets, destroying the buildings. The management building (Palataki) and various outbuildings were preserved and served as a war hospital for English officers. In the 1960s Metalia was then used as a loading point for iron-manganese ores for the company Krupp. With the help of an EC funding program (€600,000), a mining park and museum was to be built on the site from 2000 onwards. Owing to the usual corruption and nepotism in Greece, the money unfortunately collapsed and so everything is left to decay. (updated Aug 2019)
40.634824.593228 Vouves. The lead-silver ore opencast mining 2 km northeast of Limenaria with tunnels was in operation since ancient times. Old tunnels can still be seen today in the large open pit mine from 1903 to 1914. About 350 m before the entrance to Metalia Beach (coming from Limenaria) leads a dirt road to the open pit 2 km away. The large bright studs with standing height are very interesting photo opportunities for 'lost place' photographers. (updated Aug 2019)
40.661424.609329 Iron ore open pit Mavrolako. From Limenaria the road branches off behind Kalivia to Maries and Kastro. From this junction, drive 3.5 km towards Kastro and then turn left into a wide dirt road. After about 300 m you reach the first construction ruins of the former opencast mine. The landscape there has the typical rust of iron ore and forms a photogenic contrast with the green of the vegetation. The mining was discontinued in the early 1960s. (updated Sep 2019)
Beaches[edit]
Marble Bay
Golden Beach
Aliki Bay
Psili Amos Beach
Pachis Beach
The east and south sides of the island have many picturesque bays and popular sandy beaches, while the west side has more elongated, lonely, rocky beaches, but also beautiful sandy ones. For people who are looking for nudist beaches, Thasos is a good destination too. In the following, only the best known beaches are listed. There are still many bays and beaches to discover.

Stay safe[edit]
There is no danger for tourists, so you can move freely anywhere. Only take care of pickpocketing.
Medical Care: There is no hospital in Thasos, but a "Health Center" in Prinos from the patient will be relocated to the Kavala Hospital for more serious illnesses. Medical practices (including dentist, orthopedist, cardiologist and general practitioner) can be found in Limenas and Limenaria.
The drinking water quality is controlled, but differs from village to village. It is usually safer to use bottled water for drinking.
Snakes: there is a poisonous snake that lives mainly in the mountains, often on stony terrain or in holes in walls, between rocks etc. (horned viper) It is very poisonous! Therefore, you should pay attention to good footwear and clothing, if you want to go off the beaten track and generally be careful with walls in abandoned houses and land.
Go next[edit]
An advantage of Thasos is the close distance to the main land what makes day trips easy.

Kavala: often visited by ferry boat from Scala Prinos at Saturday morning as a day trip when Kavala's big and colorfull market (bazar) at the promenade is open (07:30-13:00, best visit time before 11:00, as it gets very busy later). The famous archaeological site of Philippi can be reached by bus from Kavala bus terminal Ktel, close to the bazaar. The best way to do this day trip is by taking the first ferry from Scala Prinos to Kavala and back on the afternoon ferry or back by bus to Keramoti and from there on one of the many later ferries. At the Aquadukt in Kavala you can also rent scooters and thus easily reach the sights outside the city center.
Nestos-Delta and Nestos-Gorge: natural reserve areas of stunning beauty reachable by bus from Keramoti or but better by car as a day trip,
Pangaion Hills: the Pangaio is with almost 2000 m the highest mountain in the Kavala area, with picturesque mountain villages, a multitude of monasteries and impressive vegetation. As a day trip from Thasos a car is necessary to reach the points of interest in a reasonable time.
Drama. Provincial town but a good place to start an excursion to the Rhodope Mountains, wild, almost deserted natural landscape on the Bulgarian border.
Xanthi: famous for its Old Town with many pubs and restaurants and night life
Samothrace-Island: using public transport you go by bus from Kavala Ktel to Alexandroupolis where the ferry to Samothrace starts
