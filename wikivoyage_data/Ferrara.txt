Ferrara is a city in Italy. Together with the nearby delta of the Po river, Ferrara has been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.


Understand[edit]
Palazzo municipale
Although it certainly has a thriving tourism industry, Ferrara is not on the typical foreign tourist's itinerary, which makes it perfect for those tourists who want to get off the beaten path of Venice-Florence-Rome and soak in some authentic northern Italian culture.  It's characterized by twisting medieval cobblestoned streets, a Duomo (cathedral) with a looming Gothic façade, and—best of all—a castle straight out of storybooks, complete with towers, moat, and drawbridges (that you can cross during the day).
Thanks to the d'Este family of astute art patrons, Ferrara contains many beautiful objects de arte, but the genuine masterpiece is the city itself. Half medieval, half Renaissance, the dual cityscape was the vision of oligarch Ercole d'Este, who hired architect Biagio Rossetti to seamlessly meld the newer section to the old. This careful planning earned Ferrara the title of Italy's first "modern city." Today, its captivating, anachronistic ambience is best explored on foot or by bicycle.
Touring the sites will occupy a day, but after that the best way to experience Ferrara is to relax at one (or several) of its cafes and enjoy la vita italiana going on around you.

Get around[edit]
Take your cue from the locals and rent a bike (at the train station, near the Duomo or interurban companies).  Everyone bikes in Ferrara—old ladies in fur coats,  mothers and fathers each with a babyseat on the back, studentessas in skirts and stillettos, even the police officers themselves.  It's really the most convenient way to get around this city made up of a twisting maze of cobblestone streets.
Mi Muovo[dead link] is an integrated public transport pass for the region. Short-stay visitors might use "Mi Muovo Multibus", a 12-trip bus ticket, see Emilia Romagna#Get around.

Buy[edit]
Ferrara is a fairly well-to-do northern Italian city and predictably has a good number of clothing shops, ranging from budget-fashion Zara to small, expensive boutiques.  The main shopping districts are Via Mazzini (the street leading from Piazza Trento-Trieste where the campanile and Mel Books is) and Via Garibaldi (the street leading from inside the Palazzo Municipio), as well as the whole center of the city around the Castello.
Every Saturday morning there is an open-air market set up in Piazza Trento-Trieste with a changing weekly theme—ranging from furniture to antiques to clothes to food and produce.  One night a week the same piazza is devoted to an open-air candy market.
Stop by Ferrara Frutta (the best one is on the very end of Via Garibaldi), a co-op that sells fresh local produce of excellent quality for very low prices.
Eat[edit]
Panini and Piadine
In Italian, a "piadina" is the type of pressed, flatbread sandwich that is known in the United States as the "panini." Actual "panini" (singular "panino") are merely normal sandwiches.

44.8377811.6157191 Mordicchio La Piadina, Piazza Sacrati, ☏ +39 380 767 5585. M-W 12:00-15:00, 18:45-22:00; Th 12:00-15:00; F Sa 12:00-15:00, 18:45-22:00. A little on the costly side, but for a quick bite head down Via Garibaldi to the piadina stand across from the Indian restaurant. Don't forget to try the perfectly cooked French fries. 
44.83707611.6194722 Birreria Giori, Piazza Savonarola, 1, ☏ +39 0 532209341. It's the bar that looks a little like a greenhouse set up right against the moat with tables outside. With a "make your own panino" option on the menu, friendly waiters, and an ideal location literally in the shadow of the Castello, it makes a perfect lunch stop. 
Pizza
In Italy it is customary for each person to order a whole pizza for him or herself. The crusts are thin, so one pizza is almost exactly enough for a filling dinner for one person. Generally cheaper than a full-course meal, perfect for students.

44.83275911.6231113 Il Ciclone, Via Saraceno, 36, ☏ +39 0532 210262, info@ilcicloneferrara.it. Once upstairs in an alley just off Via Mazzini, it has moved 100 meters further. This friendly restaurant offers regular meals but its specialty is pizza. 
44.83093811.6213974 Al Frattino, Via Carlo Mayr, 155. A small, unremarkable-looking Sicilian pizzeria which serves without a doubt the best pizza in town. Try the "Diablo" and make sure to chat with the friendly owners, even if it's in sign language. 
44.8359511.6177935 Bar Settimo, Via Cortevecchia. Don't be put off by the dingy bar at the front. At the back is one of the friendliest restaurants in Italy, presided over by the splendid Norberto. The food is simple but excellent and not at all expensive. Pizzas and Salama da Sugo con Pure are particularly good. For years it has been the favourite watering hole for performers at the Teatro Communale and Ferrara Musica. After concerts the place is very lively and, unusually for Ferrara, it closes late. (updated Apr 2016)
Pasta
Do not leave Ferrara without trying its trademark cappellacci di zucca (round pasta stuffed with squash/pumpkin), either "al burro e salvia" (with butter and sage) or "al ragu" (with meat sauce).

44.8358511.620458 Al Brindisi, Via Adelardi,11, ☏ +39 0532471225, fred.brindisi@libero.it.

Although most come at night to drink, they also serve exclusively Ferrarese fare such as pasticcio and cappellacci di zucca for dinner (the portions are small, so make sure to eat a real Italian meal and order both a primo and a secondo). 
44.8313711.6237019 Il Cucco. Located on a backstreet near Via delle Volte, at Via Voltecasotto 3, this charming and inexpensive trattoria offers a variety of local Ferrarese specialties. Garden seating available in warmer weather.

44.7895611.6299211 Ca' Vecia, Via Ravenna, 588, Fossanova San Marco, ☏ +39 0532710062. Located in the countryside is a typical trattoria serving traditional dishes. 
International fare
Chinese restaurants are mediocre, but

Indian restaurant on Via Garibaldi is in fact quite good, even by non-Italy standards.
44.83248111.62415212 Agapi mou, Via Saraceno, 71, ☏ +39 0532 20 79 41. Tu-Su 12:00-14:00 18:30-23:00. A small Greek restaurant with decent Greek food, though a bit pricey for the amount. 
Drink[edit]
The Piazza - If you're in Ferrara on a fair Wednesday night, do yourself a favor and go out to the main piazza. There you will find every young person in the city (and some older ones too) out socializing at the piazza in front of the looming Duomo façade with beer in hand (acquired at Settimo or Bar del Duomo for €2-4). An experience not to be missed.
