The Gallup Intertribal Indian Ceremonial
Gallup is an important gateway to the Navajo Nation and other nearby attractions in the state of New Mexico. Gallup has numerous trading posts and Indian-themed gift shops, and an abundance of natural scenery surrounding town. In 2020, it was home to 22,000 people.


Get in[edit]
Gallup is on Interstate 40, which at this point follows the route of historic Route 66.  It is about two hours from Albuquerque.  This stretch of road, however, is seemingly under nearly constant construction, and you may have some unexpected driving delays.  Dust storms and wind-driven blizzards can also create delays, particularly between Gallup and Grants.
The nearest major airport is in Albuquerque.
Amtrak's Southwest Chief, the main Amtrak train line across the Southwest, has a station in Gallup. The westbound train arrives at 7:08PM and the eastbound train arrives at 8:51AM. This stop has no ticket office and no Quik-Trak ticket machine so tickets must be purchased at another station or on-line.
Get around[edit]

By bus[edit]
Gallup express ☏ +1 505-906-6006.  Bus fare is $1.  Buses run every hour between 6AM and 6PM.  The main transfer stop for the buses is at East Aztec and South 2nd street, a few blocks southwest of the Amtrak Station.  The most useful route is route 1.  Route 1 runs between downtown to some hotels next to Rio West Mall.

Stay safe[edit]
While Gallup is a small city (pop 21000), there are severe problems with violent crime (nearly five times the national average), widespread alcoholism, poverty (severe among the native population, which represents 44% of the city, although mine closures have hurt the city as a whole) and homelessness. What little money is available goes all too often to feed the blight of numerous liquor stores, usurious payday loans and pawn shops which infest the main street. Expect to be harassed by aggressive panhandlers and intoxicated persons, especially at night. 

Go next[edit]
Although Gallup is in a desert, there are high mountain peaks and pristine alpine forests within an hour's drive of town. Notables include Mount Taylor (11,301 feet) and the Zuni Mountains.
Navajo Nation occupies most of the space north and west of town to the state line, with various points of interest.
Chaco Culture National Historical Park and El Malpais National Monument are United States national parks and monuments within easy driving distance of Gallup, about an hour north and east, respectively.  A tip: If you're going to Chaco, do not approach from the southwest (NM 371 to NM 9 directly to NM 57) unless you have 4-wheel drive; this road has several hairy spots, and you're a long way from help if you get stuck.  Instead take 371 to 9 and around to the much more civilized approach from the east side.  It's 20 miles longer, but much less likely to be impassable.
