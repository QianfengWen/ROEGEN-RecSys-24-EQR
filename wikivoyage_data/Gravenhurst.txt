Gravenhurst Main street
Gravenhurst is a town of about 12,000 people (2016) in the Muskoka region of Ontario.  Norman Bethune, the Canadian doctor who became famous in China for battlefield surgery, was born here, and is the town's most famous former citizen.  The town refers to itself as 'The Gateway to Muskoka' as is indicated on a large archway in the south-end of town.  The town is a drawing point for summer cottage season.  Many cottagers in the Muskokas use Gravenhurst for groceries and supplies and visit the town once or twice a week during cottage season.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Gravenhurst was first known as McCabes Landing and later as Sawdust City.  Gravenhurst was named by a postal official who was reading Gravenhurst or Thoughts on Good and Evil, a treatise by William Smith.
Gravenhurst's economic prosperity stemmed from the construction of a colonization road in the 1850s. Steamboating on the Muskoka lakes began in the 1860s. The town was at the northern terminus of the Toronto, Simcoe and Muskoka Junction Railway.
In 1942 the Royal Norwegian Air Force moved their training camp (Little Norway) from Toronto to Muskoka airfield near Gravenhurst. The Norwegians remained in Gravenhurst almost to the end of World War II in 1945. From 1940 to 1946 Gravenhurst was the site of Camp 20, the Gravenhurst Internment Camp, for Nazi Prisoners of War, known locally as "the Muskoka officers club". It housed up to 489 Nazi POWs. The prisoners of war built a set of stone steps leading down to the waterfront which can still be seen at Gull Lake Park today. They also built a light house in the park. Before the war it was the Calydor Sanitarium. After the war it was turned into a TB sanitarium, again, and later became a kosher resort called The Gateway.
Today, all that remains of Camp 20 is concrete pillars, a fire hydrant, and the outline of a fence. There is an information kiosk at the end of Lorne Street where visitors can go to get more information on the camp.

By car[edit]
Gravenhurst is about 170 km north of Toronto.  The easiest way to get to Gravenhurst is by automobile, as commercial bus service is limited and there are very few passenger trains to the area.  To reach Gravenhurst, take Highway 400 north from Toronto through Barrie to the Highway 11 cutoff (direction North Bay).  Proceed up Highway 11 and take Muskoka Road 169 - Bethune Drive (formerly Ontario Highway 169) right in to downtown.  Summer travel can be time-consuming, as it is a popular tourist destination and the gateway to the Muskoka Lakes region.  The roads in Gravenhurst are well-maintained, so no need to worry about using a sport utility vehicle.

Go next[edit]
The wonderful thing about visiting  Muskoka is that there are plenty of small towns in the area to visit.  Port Carling, Bracebridge, Parry Sound, Huntsville, Sudbury and North Bay are all within a few minutes or 1–2 hours driving distance.  Toronto is close by if you're a visitor to the province coming in from Highway 17 to the north.  The region is rich with museums, shopping, and attractions.  For those who like to gamble, there is Casino Rama (located near the small town of Rama) near Orillia.  Webers Burgers (go south 25–30 minutes drive on Highway 11) is an attraction unto itself with its rail-car dining area and unique (to the region) overpass walkway.  And in Muskoka, one can always find a secluded lake to just sit and admire the scenery.
