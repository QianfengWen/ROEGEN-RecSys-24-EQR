The Kilgore History and Art Center
Kilgore is in the Central Piney Woods region of East Texas. Home to slightly less than 13,000 residents, Kilgore is often identified as the "Oil Capital of East Texas", due to its proximity near the center of the vast East Texas Oilfield. Residents are proud of their heritage, and evidence of the city's prominence in petroleum production is widespread and accentuated throughout Kilgore.


Get in[edit]
The nearest airports serving the area around Kilgore are Tyler Pounds Regional Airport [dead link], and Longview East Texas Regional Airport. However, Kilgore is easily accessible via automobile, and maintains a bus station which serves Greyhound Bus Lines.

Get around[edit]
Kilgore is just south of the junction of US Highway 259 and IH20, and at the junctions of Texas Highways 31 and 42. US 259 is the city's main thoroughfare; most places of note and interest lie within a few blocks of it. Kilgore's historic (and revitalized) downtown area is easily accessed from Kilgore Street, one of the city's major east-west streets. The side streets can tend to be on the rough side, typical for a small East Texas town, but all are passable in essentially any automobile.

See[edit]
 The World's Richest Acre Park. On this 1.2-acre site in Downtown Kilgore once stood the greatest concentration of producing oil wells in the United States. Over 2.5 million barrels of oil were culled from this location. All but one of the original derricks had been dismantled by the 1960s, but the original remains along with 26 steel reproductions and a replica pumpjack. Open year-round.

Every aspect of the life of a 1930s oil boom town is recreated in this museum, which includes a full scale reproduction of a muddy Kilgore main street. Highlights include a virtual trip 3,800 feet deep into the Earth's crust to view simulated oil formations, and a restored 1930s-era oil derrick. 
 Driller Park. This small ballpark, built in 1947, was once home to the minor-league Kilgore Drillers. A local treasure and Texas historical landmark, the park now serves as the home field of the Kilgore High School Bulldogs.

This small museum contains artifacts and stories of the horror of the New London School Explosion, which occurred on March 18, 1937. Museum tours are hosted by Mollie Ward, herself a survivor of the explosion. Before leaving, stop by the tea room for an old-fashioned hand dipped malt or shake. Large groups should call ahead to set up a time for their visit so volunteer tour guides can be arranged.
