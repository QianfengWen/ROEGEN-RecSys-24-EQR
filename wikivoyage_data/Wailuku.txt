Wailuku, on Maui, is the seat of Maui County.  Unlike the commercial center of Kahului, Wailuku has a small-town plantation feel centered around its Main Street.  Several buildings in Wailuku are registered as historic places.  It is also the gateway to nearby Iao Valley and Iao Needle.


Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Kahului Airport is a major airport about 10 minutes away, in nearby Kahului. This airport has flights to many Hawaiian Islands, mainland, Alaska, and Vancouver, Canada.
Honolulu International Airport, while not on Maui, is the most common way to get to Wailuku. Flights from around the world fly to here, and then take a short flight to Kahului Airport.
By car[edit]
From Kahului, follow Kaahumanu Avenue (Hwy 32) west.  Kaahumanu Avenue turns into Main Street after passing an overpass and viaduct.  To get to Iao Valley, continue past High Street (Hwy 30) for about 0.5 mile, then take the fork in the road onto Iao Valley Road.

By bus[edit]
Maui Bus 20 runs from Lahaina to Kahului through Wailuku.

Get around[edit]
The four main streets in Wailuku are:

Main Street (highway 32), which runs east to west from Kaahumanu Avenue into Iao Valley.
Market Street (highway 330), which runs roughly north-south and intersects Main Street in the center of Wailuku town. The north part passes through the neighborhood of Happy Valley.
Lower Main Street, which begins at the Main Street overpass and runs roughly southwest to northeast to Waiehu Beach Road and then connects to Kahului Beach Road to Kaahumanu Avenue. This is often a good alternate route if Kaahumanu Avenue is congested.
High Street (highway 30), which begins at the state office building on Main Street and runs south toward Lahaina, turning into Honoapiilani Highway.
See[edit]
 Iao Valley State Park (about 3 mi/5 km W of downtown Wailuku on Iao Valley Rd). Daily 7AM-7PM.

No hiking allowed in the park except on paved paths. Free.

20.8888-156.50191 Tri Paddle Maui, 54 N. Market St,, ☏ +1 808-243-7235. for Canoeing equipment. 
Eat[edit]
Alas, Ooka Super Market, once the main supermarket in Wailuku, is no more.  At one point, the only full-service supermarket in Wailuku was Sack N Save, at 790 Eha Street (corner of Eha St and Waiehu Beach Road), but branches of Safeway (58 Maui Lani Parkway, across Baldwin High School) and Foodland (370 Kehalani Village Drive) have since opened. You can find a smaller selection at Takamiya Market on Market Street; they also serve a wide selection of ready-to-eat food.  Whole Foods Market is about 10 minutes away in Kahului.

 Tasty Crust, 1770 Mill St (near the intersection of Kaniela and Mill Sts), ☏ +1 808 244-0845. Don't let the surroundings or the decor deter you (it's in the middle of an old-style industrial park, and the decor is old-style Americana).  This restaurant is very popular among local Mauians.  The big draw at this restaurant is breakfast; their tagline is "World Famous Pancakes." Less than $10.
