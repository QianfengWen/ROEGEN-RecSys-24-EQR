Wood Islands Harbour
Wood Islands is on the southeastern shore of Prince Edward Island fronting on the Northumberland Straight and takes its name from several small forested islands located just offshore.

Get in[edit]
By boat[edit]
The Northumberland Ferry crosses the Northumberland Strait between Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. It's reached from the mainland via a 75-minute ferry from the Caribou Ferry Terminal near Pictou, Nova Scotia, 19 km (12 mi) north of New Glasgow on Highway 106. Similar to the Confederation Bridge tolls, fares are only charged for passengers departing Prince Edward Island, check on the website for current fares.  The ferry operates as few as 3 crossings daily per direction in the winter and over double that frequency during other times of the year.
Highway 106 in Nova Scotia becomes Highway 1 in Prince Edward Island, and continues to Charlottetown.  Highway 106 and Highway 1 are part of branch of the Trans-Canada Highway.
