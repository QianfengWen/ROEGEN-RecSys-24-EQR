Francisco Madero was a key figure in the Mexican Revolution and first president after the overthrow of Porfirio Diaz's dictatorship. He is the favorite son of San Pedro.
San Pedro de las Colonias is a small city of about 45,000 residents (2005) in the southwest part of the state of Coahuila in northern Mexico. The town has a long official name, but don't worry if you can't remember it, neither does anyone else: it's always referred to as simply San Pedro. The town calls itself the "cradle of the Mexican Revolution" because it was the home of Francisco Madero, a key instigator of the Revolution and the first president of the post-revolution era.
