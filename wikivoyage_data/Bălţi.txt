Bălţi (Cyrillic Бэлць, Бельцы or Бєльці), after Tiraspol in breakaway Transnistria, is the second largest city in Moldova.


Understand[edit]
The main traffic bearing street is Strada Ștefan cel Mare. One block south, the town's commercial centre continues on the pedestrianized Strada Independeţei.

Get in[edit]
Map of Bălţi

There are two railway stations. The main one is the north station, Gara de Nord (confusingly tickets will have this station as Bălţi Sloboziya - Бэлць Слобозия). The other, more central, south station is Gara de Sud (labelled on tickets as Bălţi Orash - Бэлць Ораш, meaning Bălţi Town). All trains stop at the north station (even those heading south), though Orash station may be more convenient to travellers heading south towards Ungheni on the Romanian border and Chișinău.
