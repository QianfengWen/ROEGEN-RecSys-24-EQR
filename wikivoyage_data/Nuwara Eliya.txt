Nuwara Eliya is a city in the Hill Country of Sri Lanka. At 1,868 m (6,129 ft) altitude, its temperate climate gives the city a very different feel from other parts of the country.

It has earned the name 'Little England' owing to its colonial architecture.

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
Four times daily there is a train coming from Colombo or Kandy, and it then proceeds further to Badulla. The train's name is 'Udarata Menike', and the journey is spectacular.
There is no train station in Nuwara Eliya: the closest one is in Nanuoya, 6 km of Nuwara Eliya. There are plenty of tuk tuks, taxis and local buses waiting at the train station in Nanuoaya that go to the centre of Nuwara Eliya. A tuktuk or taxi to Nuwara Eliya town shouldn't cost more than Rs 400-500 (rupees) (2020).
6.94280.74371 Nanuoya Train Station. (updated Dec 2016)

By bus[edit]
Buses can be taken from Colombo route #79[dead link], three times per day, six hours. Or from Kandy, every 20 minutes, 2½-3 hour trip.
Be aware - road transport between Colombo and Nuwara Eliya is very slow. The journey will typically take five to six hours to cover the 180 km.  Traffic, poor weather or failing light can extend the time needed. Rail transport is about the same due to the old and meandering track.

Get around[edit]
6°58′0″N 80°46′0″EMap of Nuwara Eliya
The town centre is small enough to walk around. To visit sites further afield, take a bus or hire a three-wheeler. A tuktuk within town (e.g. from city center to Pedro Tea Factory) should not cost more than Rs 200.
The same caveat applies to touring around the area as for getting there. Assume that you'll not exceed 20 kilometres per hour no matter what the mode of (ground) transport. So plan any excursions carefully, and don't assume that you can cover more than about 100 km in a day, including stops.

Do[edit]
Take a walk up through the tea plantations south-west of the town to the top of Single Tree Hill for a splendid view over Nuwara Eliya. From the hill top you can walk north for a couple of kilometres along the ridgetop to a nearby village and get a tuk-tuk/three-wheeler or walk back to town.
Playing golf is also an option at 6.969780.7661 Nuwara Eliya Golf, along with heading to the 6.96368480.7663912 racecourses (the only proper ones you'll find in Sri Lanka). These are both traditions left over from the colonial era.
Take a train trip from Nanu Oya towards Kandy.  For the colonial experience book a 1st class ticket in the observation car. For an authentic local experience book a 3rd class ticket and hang out of the door of the carriage.
