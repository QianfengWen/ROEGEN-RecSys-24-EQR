In the SouthCoast region of Massachusetts, where the Taunton River empties into Mount Hope Bay, stands Fall River- the "Spindle City". Not to be overshadowed by nearby Boston and Providence, Fall River offers visitors unique attractions that are absent from its two larger neighbors. Fall River is famous for Battleship Cove, the largest museum of its kind in the world; a rich Portuguese-American culture, featuring authentic food; and the accused axe murderess Lizzie Borden. 


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Fall River's name comes from Quequechan (locally, QUICK-uh-shan), a Wampanoag word meaning "Falling Water". At one time, the Quequechan River meandered through the city, connecting South Watuppa Pond to the Taunton River via eight small waterfalls. Today, most of the river is routed underground, covered by I-195. A lone aboveground waterfall remains; it's manmade and hidden in the Metacomet Mills complex, near where Anawan St. intersects Davol St. 

The Spindle City[edit]
This mill, now a doctor's office, is constructed from local Fall River granite.
Fall River was the USA's largest cotton textile manufacturer in the late 1800s, earning its enduring nickname of "Spindle City". While this industry has largely disappeared, the granite mill buildings it left behind define the appearance of the city's South End. The aristocratic owners of these mill complexes lived in the Victorian mansions lining the streets of The Highlands, a neighborhood of the suburban North End. Among the mills that have not burned down or been demolished, many now house restaurants and retailers. Yet, the city's textile heritage lives on through more than just its structures. In 2020, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, Fall River's Merrow Manufacturing Company was the largest producer of USA-sourced PPE, including face masks.

The Fall River Line[edit]

Along the Taunton River, the city's western border, lies The Waterfront. In the 19th century, this was the port for The Fall River Line, a steamboat-rail connection from New York City to Boston. Travel on the line's ornate "floating palaces" was the most luxurious way to get between these Northeastern hubs- just ask any of the six U.S. presidents, including FDR, who took the journey. The steamboats are gone today, but massive warships, including the USS Massachusetts ("Big Mamie"), have taken their place at Battleship Cove Museum. In the 2010s, significant investment revitalized the Waterfront, with new restaurants, breweries, and a boardwalk. In the 2020s, the anticipated completion of the South Coast Rail will once again make Fall River's Waterfront a transportation hub, connecting Battleship Cove Station with Boston.

Immigration[edit]
Fall River's 19th century prominence drew in immigrants from a multitude of cultures. While these close-knit communities are less homogenous today, the parks, churches, and monuments they left behind define the neighborhoods they once inhabited. Irish immigrants, many from County Cork, founded Corky Row. Polish people flocked to what is now the Niagara Neighborhood. French-Canadians were met with austerity and skepticism as they moved into The Flint. 
In the 20th century, a new group of immigrants- the Portuguese- arrived in droves, and today are by far the largest ethnic group. Over 40% of people in Fall River identify as Portuguese, higher than any other city in the country. Most are of Azorean descent.
In the 21st century, Fall River remains a melting pot of cultures, with growing communities of Brazilian, Hispanic, African American, Cambodian, and Vietnamese people.

Climate[edit]
New England climates are typically unpredictable and can range from bitter cold to very hot.  Winters can be freezing and can feature varying levels of snowfall.  Summer weather can be humid and hot, especially away from the waterfront.  The most temperate times of the year are late spring and late summer/early fall.

Talk[edit]
Speech in Fall River is distinctly, authentically New England (unlike in Boston, where transplants from across the country have made the local accent an endangered species). The “Fall River accent” is most similar to Rhode Island’s dialects, themselves influenced by Boston and NYC. The result is rounded vowels, dropped ‘r’s (Fall River becomes “Fawl Rivah”), and ‘r’s where there aren’t any (pizza becomes “peetzer”). Visitors will hear the classic “wicked,” “blinker,” and “packie,” alongside more local words like “bubbler” (water fountain) and “grinder” (Italian submarine sandwich).
Tens of thousands of Fall River residents speak Portuguese. Many were born on the island of São Miguel, and their dialect, Micaelense, is perhaps the most difficult Portuguese accent to understand. Locals may switch freely between Portuguese and English in conversation. Even non-speakers integrate Portuguese words and phrases into their daily speech, particularly for food items. For example, chouriço, a sausage similar to Spanish chorizo, is locally pronounced "shuh-REECE”. Dozens of Portuguese surnames, and their Americanized pronunciations, are common knowledge across Fall River, while being completely unknown elsewhere in the state.
Fall River is also home to communities speaking Spanish, Cape Verdean Creole, French, Polish, and Khmer.

Get in[edit]
The Braga Bridge, a city icon, connects Fall River to points west via I-195.

Logan International Airport (BOS IATA) in Boston is the primary international airport serving the area.
T.F. Green Airport (PVD IATA) in Warwick (Rhode Island) is the city's nearest major domestic airport.
New Bedford Regional Airport (EWB IATA) offers flights from Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket.
Taunton Municipal Airport (FAA: TAN) in East Taunton is a small regional airport.
By car[edit]
Most visitors arrive by car, due to Fall River's relative lack of intercity public transportation. 

Major state and interstate highways[edit]
Interstate 195 runs east-west between Providence and Cape Cod. Primary route from Providence and Cape Cod. Exits: 11, 12, 13, 14A, 14B.
MA Route 24 runs south-north from Newport to Randolph. Primary route from points north, notably Boston (via Interstate 93), and from Southern Rhode Island. Exits: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8A, 8B.
U.S. Route 6 runs east-west through Fall River, from Provincetown in Cape Cod toward Providence, ultimately running another 3,000 mi (4,800 km) to California.
Other numbered highways[edit]
MA Route 79 begins in Fall River and terminates in Middleborough to the north. Connects I-195 to Route 24.
MA/RI Route 81 begins in Little Compton to the south and terminates in Fall River.
MA/RI Route 138 from Newport to Milton enters Fall River from Tiverton, crosses the river via Routes 79/6 into Somerset, and runs north toward Taunton.
MA/RI Route 177 passes through Fall River for a whopping 200 feet to connect Tiverton with Westport.
By bus[edit]
The Southeastern Regional Transit Authority (SRTA) offers daily buses from nearby Swansea, Dartmouth, and New Bedford to Fall River.
The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) offers daily buses from Providence and Newport to Fall River.
Peter Pan Bus Lines offers bus routes from Boston and Newport. These are expensive coach buses (over $20 one-way). Due to COVID-19, bus service is extremely infrequent on these lines as of Dec 2020.
By train[edit]
As of 2020, no train routes directly serve Fall River. However, the South Coast Rail, a direct connection to Fall River from Boston via Middleborough/Lakeville, is anticipated before 2024. Phase 2 of construction will continue throughout the 2020s, yielding a shorter route from Boston via Stoughton.
From Boston, two train routes get within a 30-minute drive of Fall River:

Middleborough/Lakeville Commuter Rail (ride to terminus)
Providence Commuter Rail (ride to Mansfield, Attleboro, or Providence station stops). Bus connections to Fall River are available from Providence.

Traditional taxi services exist, including Town Taxi and Yellow Cab of Fall River. However, their online presence is limited, and as of Jan 2021 it is unclear how regularly they are operating during the COVID-19 pandemic.

By foot[edit]
Fall River is a city built on hills, with some streets exceeding a 20% elevation grade. As a result, getting around solely by foot can be a challenge. Walking within neighborhoods is generally doable, but crossing from one to another can be problematic.

By bicycle[edit]
Bicycles in Fall River are typically used for recreation, not transportation. Traffic bike lanes do exist, but are sparse and rarely used.
Due to COVID-19 and lack of demand, there are no bike rentals in Fall River or bordering towns as of Jan 2021. The nearest option is Bristol Bikes, 13 mi (21 km) west in Bristol (Rhode Island).
If you rode into town, BikeWorks in nearby Swansea is the closest shop offering bicycle service and repair.

Lizzie Borden, Fall River's Most Infamous Resident



Lizzie Borden took an axe,
Gave her mother forty whacks;
When she saw what she had done,
She gave her father forty-one.
-Folk Rhyme



On August 4, 1892, Lizzie Borden discovered the hatchet-mangled bodies of her wealthy father, Andrew, and her stepmother, Abby. What followed is among the most famous murder trials in American history. Lizzie was acquitted of murder charges, despite providing conflicting stories, trying to buy poison the day before the scene, and burning a "paint-stained" dress days later. No one was ever convicted of the crime.
Lizzie has attracted no shortage of fans. Some proudly proclaim her innocence; others proudly proclaim that she was an axe murderer. Regardless of your position, you can see the scene of the crime for yourself at the Lizzie Borden Bed and Breakfast; pay respects at the family gravesite in Oak Grove Cemetery; and hear from the experts at the Fall River Historical Society.

Stay safe[edit]
Fall River is a sizable city. The precautions one would take in any unfamiliar urban area should be observed, particularly after dark.
Crime rates across the city steadily decreased throughout the 2010s. That said, Fall River has one of the highest rates of violent crime in Massachusetts. 
A high proportion of crime in the city is drug-related and/or domestic in nature, and does not occur in broad daylight. As a result, it is exceedingly unlikely to be targeted or involved as a random bystander.
Crime is not uniform across the city. Very little occurs in Globe Village, Maplewood, and all neighborhoods north of Route 6. The city’s suburban North End (approximately Zip Code 02720) has significantly less reported crime than neighborhoods in the South End. Rates are highest in Corky Row, Flint Village, and City Center. At night, visitors are recommended to avoid residential streets in these areas, in addition to sections of Pleasant St., Slade St., and city parks.

Bordering towns[edit]
Horseneck Beach in Westport, MA
Fall River is bordered by five towns- four in Massachusetts, and one in Rhode Island.

Somerset to the west provides a lovely view of Fall River's skyline rising above the Taunton River.
Freetown to the north is home to Assonet Village and the majority of Freetown State Forest.
Dartmouth touches a sliver of Fall River's east border. Home to UMass Dartmouth, shopping centers, and the charming seaside village of Padanaram.
Westport comprises most of Fall River's east border. Massachusetts' westernmost Atlantic port (west port, get it?), it is home to Horseneck Beach, Fall River's closest glimpse of the ocean.
Tiverton (Rhode Island) to the south is a quiet town featuring Fort Barton (a hiking area centered on a Revolutionary War defense post) and beaches on the Sakonnet River.
Destinations[edit]
Boston- New England’s largest city presents virtually endless itineraries to visitors. History buffs will be delighted by the Freedom Trail, which follows pivotal locations of the American Revolutionary War. Other highlights include the Red Sox’s Fenway Park; the palatial MFA, 14th largest art museum in the world; internationally renowned universities, including Harvard and MIT in nearby Cambridge; and the Boston Harbor Islands. 50 mi (80 km) north via Route 24 and I-93.
Cape Cod- First things first: you don't "Go up to Cape Cod", you "Go down the Cape." If you can make it through the ludicrous summer traffic, the Cape offers miles of beaches, artists' refuges, and Provincetown, one of the USA's most popular LGBT getaways. 40 mi (64 km) east to Bourne via I-195 and Route 25; P-Town is another 65 mi (105 km) away via Route 6.
New Bedford- Fall River's perennial rival, the "Whaling City" is the South Coast's other cultural center. Visit the extensive Whaling Museum to see for yourself why this city inspired Melville's Moby-Dick, then dine on the waterfront by charming cobblestone streets and alleys. 15 mi (24 km) east via I-195.
Newport (Rhode Island)- One of the top tourist destinations in Rhode Island, Newport is home to the historic Newport Mansions, museums, and public beaches. In the summer, Newport hosts the world-famous Newport Jazz Festival, alongside the Folk Festival, Tall Ships, and International Oktoberfest. 20 mi (32 km) southwest via Routes 24 and 114.
Providence- Fall River has much closer ties with Rhode Island's capital than it does with Boston, which can at times feel distant and disconnected. In the warmer months, take an evening gondola ride through WaterFire, a weekend public arts event spanning the rivers of downtown Providence. Year-round, visitors can dine on Federal Hill, a fantastic Little Italy, and shop on eclectic Thayer Street by Brown University and RISD. 20 mi (32 km) west via I-195.
Salem (Massachusetts)- Visiting Fall River for Lizzie Borden? Salem should be on your itinerary. In the Salem Witch Trials of 1692, 19 townsfolk were executed for allegedly dabbling in the occult. In modern times, the witches appear to have won: paranormal museums, hundreds of practicing Wiccans, and Mardi Gras-esque Halloween celebrations draw in international crowds. While you’re there, don’t miss the historical architecture- it’s some of New England’s finest and most well-preserved. 80 mi (130 km) north via Route 24 and I-95.
