Newtownabbey is a district just north of Belfast.  It's short of tourist sights and facilities, and you'd only come here for business or to attend the university. 


Understand[edit]
Mossley Mill
Places called Newtown or Newton in the British Isles were often "new" around the 12th century when their abbey was created, but this one dates from 1958. The core of it was indeed the white abbey established at the end of the 12th century, a daughter house of  Dryburgh Abbey in Scotland run by the Premonstratensian Order or White Canons. By the 19th century little was left of that, but the name lived on in The Abbey, an Italianate mansion designed and later lived in by the architect Charles Lanyon; in 1907 this became a TB hospital. Whiteabbey became industrial and commuter-residential as Belfast grew rapidly: appropriately, one major local industry was a bleach works. It was also a port for coal, until Belfast city harbour was improved and the small ports along the Lough were less used.
After the Second World War, Britain's housing was in poor condition and there was a spate of re-building, much of it ugly. In 1958 Whiteabbey was combined with the villages of Whitewell, Whitehouse, Jordanstown, Monkstown, Carnmoney and Glengormley to create the town of Newtownabbey. However, building was by infill and it wasn't the sort of greenfield creation seen at, for example, Skelmersdale in England, Cumbernauld in Scotland or  Craigavon in Northern Ireland. Nor did it use the mechanism of a "New Town Development Commission" superseding local government. So Newtownabbey's growth was more organic though not much prettier than those examples.
The town today has mixed industries such as light engineering and computing, and hosts a campus of Ulster University. In 2011 it had a population of 65,646, making it the third-largest settlement in Northern Ireland.
