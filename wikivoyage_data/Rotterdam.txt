Rotterdam is a huge city with several district articles that contain information about specific sights, restaurants, and accommodation.
Rotterdam is a very large city in the province of South Holland in the west of the Netherlands. The city is the second largest in the country with a population of approximately 650,000 inhabitants in the municipality (2020) and about 2.2 million inhabitants in the shared metropolitan area of the Rotterdam-The Hague Metropolitan Region (MRDH). Rotterdam is a vibrant, multicultural city; it is known for its university (Erasmus), cutting-edge architecture, lively cultural life, industrial riverside setting, its maritime heritage and colourful summer events. The municipality stretches all the way to the North Sea with gigantic areas like Europoort and Maasvlakte 1&2. All belong to the Port of Rotterdam.
Starting as a dam constructed in 1270 on the Rotte River, Rotterdam has grown into a major international commercial centre. The port of Rotterdam is Europe's busiest port by cargo tonnage, and was the world's busiest from 1962 until it was surpassed by Shanghai in 2004. Rotterdam's commercial and strategic importance is based on its location near the mouth of the Nieuwe Maas (New Meuse), a channel in the delta formed by the Rhine and Meuse on the North Sea. These rivers lead directly into the centre of Europe, including the industrial Ruhr region, which is why Rotterdam is often called the "Gateway to Europe".
Many relatively high buildings (by Dutch standards) have been emerging throughout and around the city centre. Daring and new styles of apartments, office buildings and recreation facilities resulted in Rotterdam becoming a city of modern architecture and the only city in the Netherlands with a modern skyline. Due to this, the city is especially interesting for Dutch people to visit.


Districts[edit]

Stadsdriehoek (Rotterdam Centrum)Filled with highrise and out-of-the-box architecture, this district forms the heart of Rotterdam and gives the city its characteristic.



 
Delfshaven (Delfshaven)Originally a part of Delft, this town over time grew closer to Rotterdam, leading up to its incorporation in 1886. The former town still has a fair bit of its historic identity.



 
Kralingen-Crooswijk (Kralingen-Crooswijk, Noord)Famous for the Kralingse Plas, a large artificial lake and the surrounding park, as well as Blijdorp, the second-oldest still active zoo in the Netherlands.



 
Feijenoord (Feijenoord)Namesake of a Dutch football club, Feijenoord is the heart of the south banks of the Meuse.



 
Northern Rotterdam (Overschie, Hillegersberg-Schiebroek)Home to Rotterdam's airport as well as Hilligersberg and the surrounding lakes and forests.



 
Capelle en Noordoost (Prins Alexander, Capelle aan den IJssel)Largely home to Rotterdam's urban sprawl.



 
Nieuwerkerk aan den IJssel (Nieuwerkerk aan den IJssel)Though not incorporated into Rotterdam, Nieuwerkerk is largely an extension of the city. It is home to the lowest point of the famously low-lying Netherlands, at 6.76 metres (7.39 yd) below sea level.



 
Zuid (Charlois, IJsselmonde)The southernmost districts of Rotterdam.



 
Port of Rotterdam (Pernis, Rozenburg, Botlek, Europoort, Eerste- en Tweede Maasvlakte)Best known as the largest seaport of Europe, the Port of Rotterdam has been built within a river delta as well as the sea.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Settlement at the lower end of the fen stream Rotte dates from at least 900. Around 1150, large floods in the area ended development, leading to the construction of protective dikes and dams. A dam on the Rotte or 'Rotterdam' was built in the 1260s and was at the present-day Hoogstraat ('High Street').
Although Rotterdam did well after the Middle Ages and in the 'Golden Century' - roughly between 1650 and 1750 - it was not before the second part of the nineteenth century that the city started to develop itself rapidly. Helped by the digging of a new seaway (the Nieuwe Waterweg) Rotterdam was rid of access problems caused by the silting of the river and started receiving ever bigger ships with cargo for/from the booming Ruhrgebiet in Germany. Port related trade and industry skyrocketed, and the city started to draw lots of migrants from the then poor Brabant province, for whom the southern part of the city was constructed. At the turn of the twentieth century Rotterdam was well under way to become the largest economic centre in the Netherlands. It was between then and the second world war that large prestigious construction works were undertaken, in part to show off the new found economic pride.

Rotterdam was almost completely razed by Nazi bombings during World War II
The German army invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940. Germany had planned to conquer the country in one day, but after meeting unexpectedly fierce resistance, it finally forced the Dutch army to capitulate on 14 May 1940 by bombing Rotterdam and threatening to bomb other cities. The heart of the city was almost completely destroyed by the German Luftwaffe, and 800 people were killed, while about 80,000 others were made homeless. During the war, Rotterdam was bombed several times during allied raids that were aimed at the harbour area but sometimes also hit the city. The City Hall survived the bombing. Unlike most other European cities however, the City Council did not aim at rebuilding what was lost, but on taking the opportunity to create a 'new' and better city. Damaged but not destroyed old buildings were torn down in the process.
From the 1950s through the 1970s, the city was rebuilt. It remained quite windy and open until the city councils from the 1980s on began developing an active architectural policy. Daring and new styles of apartments, office buildings and recreation facilities resulted in a more 'livable' city center with a new skyline. In the 1990s, the Kop van Zuid was built on the south bank of the river as a new business center.

Demographics[edit]
In the Netherlands, Rotterdam has the highest percentage of foreigners from non-industrialised nations. Nearly 50% of the population are not native to the Netherlands or have at least one parent born outside the country. Muslims comprise close to 25% of the city's population. The city is also home to one of the largest Cape Verdean communities in the world, as well as the largest Dutch Antillean community.

Atmosphere[edit]
Rotterdam's culture is distinct from other cities in the Netherlands. The mentality of the people is described as 'can do'. From the waiters you meet to the businessmen and recent immigrants, everybody breathes a dream of getting forward with life. The modern design of the city, the bustle and the spree of buildings all add to this impression. That said, you might also find that people are sometimes too straight with you. And yes, the city is not the cosiest, or the most picturesque of towns, especially on drab winter days. But get acquainted with this small metropolis, easiest done on one of the festival days with nice weather. You will come to love it.

Winters in Rotterdam are moist and can be freezingly cold, but just as well uniquely beautiful
Climate[edit]
Rotterdam gains a lot of charm when the sun is shining. Visiting in spring or summer may be more enjoyable than during the dark rainy winter. Sunshine runs from 05:30 until 22:00 in the summer, and only between 08:45 and 16:30 in the winter.

Other close airports[edit]
 Amsterdam Schiphol Airport (AMS IATA) is 58 km north of Rotterdam and has much more flights than the Rotterdam airport. NS (Dutch Railways) operates Intercity Direct high-speed rail service, every 30 minutes to Rotterdam. The journey takes 27 minutes. You have to pay an addition for the journey from Schiphol to Rotterdam, so regular intercities in direction Rotterdam Centraal and Rotterdam Blaak are cheaper (but slower) (these intercities also call at Schiphol).
 Eindhoven Airport (EIN IATA) is 106 km southeast of Rotterdam. Ryanair and Wizzair operate flights to this airport. Take a bus to Eindhoven Centraal (approximately 20 minutes, the intercity train to Rotterdam Centraal takes about 63 minutes.
 Brussels Airport (BRU IATA) is 140 km south of Rotterdam. Many international carriers operate flights to this airport. The train from Brussels takes about 120 minutes and costs €35. Buses are also available, although less frequent.

International connections[edit]
51.9254.4694442 Rotterdam Centraal. The station is served by high-speed trains from Belgium, France and the United Kingdom.   (updated Apr 2018)
Thalys operates high-speed trains from Antwerp (Antwerpen-Centraal, 35 min), Brussels (Brussel-Zuid/Midi, 1 hr 12 min), Paris (Gare du Nord, 2 hr 37 min) and Lille (Lille-Europe, 1 hr 55 min). Book well in advance to secure the best ticket deals. A cheaper but slower alternative to Thalys is the Intercity Brussels service between Amsterdam and Brussels.
Coming from Germany, Rotterdam Centraal can only be reached by changing trains in the Netherlands. When travelling on the German high-speed train ICE[dead link] from Cologne, Düsseldorf and Oberhausen, the exchange will be in Utrecht Centraal station, and coming from Berlin, Hanover, Osnabrück (with the DB-intercity[dead link]) it is advisable to change at Amersfoort. Intercity-trains to Rotterdam depart from both Utrecht and Amersfoort.
Eurostar runs a daily high speed service from London St Pancras International to Rotterdam Centraal. Prices start at £35 one way. The journey time is about 3 hr 30 min, but you must arrive at the station at least 90 minutes before departure in order to clear the extra border controls caused by COVID restrictions and Brexit.
National connections[edit]
The Dutch railway company NS runs high-speed Intercity Direct trains between Amsterdam, Schiphol, Rotterdam and Breda. The train stops only at those four stations and shaves 25-30 minutes in journey time between Amsterdam and Schiphol and Rotterdam versus the regular Intercity and Sprinter trains that stop in between.
Beware that you have to pay a supplement (€2.60 during peak hours, €1.56 outside peak hours) to use the Intercity direct line to travel to Rotterdam if your journey involves Schiphol, (i.e. Amsterdam-Rotterdam journeys are subject to this supplement). You can purchase this supplement by tapping an anonymous or personal OV-chipkaart on a designated red pole found on the platform. Those without an anonymous or personal OV-chipkaart can use the ticketing machines or the NS website to purchase the supplement, however the discount may not be applicable to supplements purchased this way. Most unlimited day tickets including the Holland Travel Ticket can be used to travel on the Intercity Direct but a supplement purchase is still required.
Thalys also offers seats for passengers travelling from Amsterdam to Rotterdam. The journey is less than 40 minutes, slightly faster than the Intercity Direct. However, reservations/advance bookings are required and most unlimited day tickets recognised by NS cannot be used on Thalys.
Rotterdam is also well served by NS from other parts of the Netherlands, with direct connections to Delft, Amsterdam, Eindhoven, Gouda, Leiden, The Hague, Utrecht and Vlissingen. Some intercities and sprinters also stop at Rotterdam Blaak station which is in the middle of the city center. This station is also frequented by trams and metro. See also the Netherlands#Get in Netherlands page for further information on national rail.
Alternatively, Rotterdam's Metro line  E  provides a connection for passengers coming from The Hague at Den Haag Centraal. The journey from Den Haag Centraal to Rotterdam Centraal costs €4.43 with an anonymous or personalised OV-chipkaart, which is marginally cheaper than an NS journey (€4.90) between the same points but takes about five minutes longer to complete the journey.

A RET tram leaves the Stationsplein
RET operates the buses, trams, and metro within the city. You could find a journey planner and some network maps there.  Alternatively you'd use the pan-Netherlands journey planner – 9292.nl[dead link]. Transport generally arrives every 10 minutes during the day.

Tickets[edit]
As anywhere else in the country OV-chipkaart is to be used to pay all kinds of public transport. Traveling with this card will be cheapest and fastest, but bear in mind that the card itself costs €7.50 and you'd need to keep a positive balance there for at least €4. Alternatively, you can use your contactless bank card to pay for any public transport that also accepts the OV-chipkaart. As of August 2023, bank card support is relatively new, and you may find that your card gets rejected at some terminals. After a certain number of rejections, your card may be banned from public transport use, in which case you will need to purchase an OV-chipkaart or use one of the alternatives below.
For using buses and trams checking in and out has to be done in the vehicle, while for train and metro travellers in Rotterdam use the gates at the entrance of the stations.

By bicycle[edit]
In Rotterdam, everybody bikes
Like any city in The Netherlands, Rotterdam is very, very bicycle-friendly. Getting around by bike is probably the fastest way of travel within the city. There are separate bike lanes on most major streets and there are separate traffic lights for bicyclists. Avoid getting your tire in the tram rails: always cross tram rails at an angle. Of course it is also strongly advisable to watch out for other traffic at all time. On the other hand bicyclists can rely on the fact that motorists and pedestrians are aware of bikes.
Always lock your bike securely when leaving it (preferably chained to a fixed object) or go to a guarded bicycle parking station.

Rent a bike[edit]
At Rotterdam Centraal, you can rent bicycles at the shop in the underground bicycle parking, below the Station square. Leave the station at the front, exit 'Stationsplein'. The entrance of the bicycle parking ('fietsenstalling', with the glass roof) is at your right, in front of grand cafe Engels. Use-it, rents out nice Kronan bikes (Schaatsbaan 41-45, leave Central Station towards the center. Turn right at restaurant Engels and take the 2nd right).
Bikes can be rented by several other private companies. Holland-Cycling.com provides a list of addresses. Another list you will find at Rotterdam.nl.
If you have a personal (rather than an anonymous) OV-chipkaart, bicycles can be rented at many train and metro stations and other central locations by the OV-fiets system.

Guarded bicycle parking stations[edit]
Many intercity train stations have their own bicycle parking station. Many time the service is not free.
Rotterdam municipality has also some locations.
See[edit]



This is a huge city article, so detailed listings go in the district articles. This article should only provide a brief overview.

Landmarks[edit]
The Van Nellefabriek is regarded as a prime example of the International Style
Rotterdam has national notoriety for its architecture, and the city therefore is dotted with landmarks of all sorts. Most of them you will find in the city centre, but Feijenoord is also quite dense with them.
Rotterdam is known for some bridges, not in the last place the Erasmusbrug, spanning the Nieuwe Maas between the city centre and Feijenoord. Also of historical importance is the former railway lifting bridge De Hef, slightly upstream from the Erasmusbrug.
Historical landmarks are somewhat rare to come across in Rotterdam's city centre, but the city itself isn't completely devoid of them. In the city centre, the 1920 City hall and the Great or Saint-Laurence church, both survivors of the 1940 bombardment. Rotterdam is also home to the country's oldest known bronze statue, depicting Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam and dating from 1622. It is found opposite the Saint-Laurence church. Feijenoord, despite being home to many modern redevelopments, does house some historical landmarks such as the former headquarters of the Holland-Amerikalijn. Also worth visiting are the Oude Haven (Old Harbour) and the nearby Witte Huis (White House) and Schielandshuis.
Industrial landmarks are plenty in a city that mostly thrives off of harbour activities. Besides the many industrial sites found in the Port of Rotterdam, the Van Nellefabriek in the north of the city is a listed UNESCO site.

The modern skyline of Rotterdam can be truly appreciated from the Euromast.
The skyline of Rotterdam can, of course, be observed from one of the many skyscrapers in the city - though you should probably book a hotel located in a skyscraper or find one with a publicly accessible roof, as trespass isn't welcomed. Another great site for views over the city though, is the Euromast on the border between the city centre and Delfshaven, twice in its history the highest building of the Netherlands. For a relatively small entry fee, you can climb the tower or for a larger sum, you can dine inside of it. For those less comfortable with great heights though, a birds-eye overview of the city can also be obtained at Miniworld Rotterdam, near the central station.
The city is also well-known for its experimental and out-of-the-ordinary architecture, often being a testing ground for new concepts. A prime example of this are the Kubuswoningen (Cube Houses) at Blaak. Also striking are the Markthal, harbour-crane inspired sculptures at the Schouwburgplein and the Koopgoot, all found in the city centre.

Historic churches[edit]
In the Netherlands churches are generally closed to visitors on Sundays.

Cinema[edit]

At Skydive Rotterdam (also called the Flying Dutchman) you can book a tandem skydive or do a complete skydiving course and jump from a height of 3 or 4 kilometers. It's the only skydiving school in the "Randstad" area and the only place in the Netherlands where you can jump over a major city like Rotterdam. When the weather's good you will have a spectacular view over the Rotterdam skyline and other parts of the Randstad area, all the way to the coastline.
An airplane can be rented at reasonable rates at Rotterdam Airport at Happy Wing. Nice tours above the city, its ports or the coastline are on offer.
On summer Sundays, it is possible to lower yourself down from the Euromast. On last Sundays of summer months you can glide down in 15 seconds on a wire (tokkelen). Both: Not for the faint of heart! Check the website of Heightspecialists.

With children[edit]
The historic Diergaarde Blijdorp is definitely worth a visit
51.92724.44895 Diergaarde Blijdorp (Rotterdam Zoo), Blijdorplaan 8 (Take RET city bus 33 from Rotterdam Centraal towards Rotterdam Airport and get off at Diergaarde Blijdorp (for the old entrance) or Blijdorpplein (for the new entrance).

Diergaarde Blijdorp, established in 1857, is one of the most popular day trips in the Netherlands.

Football[edit]
Rotterdam has three professional soccer teams:
Feyenoord play in Eredivisie, the top tier. Their home ground is Stadion Feijenoord (capacity 51,000), better known as "De Kuip"; it's often also used for rock concerts and similar events. It's south of the river with its own railway station Rotterdam Stadion.
Sparta Rotterdam also play in Eredivisie. Their home ground is Het Kasteel ("The Castle", capacity 12,000), 3 km west of the centre.
SBV Excelsior were relegated in 2024 so they play in Eerste Divisie the second tier. Their Stadion Woudestein (capacity 4500), now called Van Donge & De Roo Stadion, is 2 km east of city centre on the north bank of the river.
Water sports and yachting[edit]
Kralingse Plas
Being a major harbour and having lots of waterways and lakes, Rotterdam has a lot to offer for water-enthousiasts.
Boating: There are four major lakes in Rotterdam. The Kralingse Plas, The double Bergse Plas, the Rottemeren and the Zevenhuizer Plas. All of them have active yachting communities and sometimes sailing races can be seen. The Zevenhuizer plas is mainly populated by Windsurf enthousiasts. Sailing boats can be rented at the Kralingse Plas at the Van Gent sailing school, Plaszoom, a 10-minute walk from Metro Voorschoterlaan (walk through the Julianalaan until you reach Plaszoom). Rowing- and sailing boats can be rented at the windmill at the very end of the eastern Rottekade at Van Vliet's (Rottemeren, go by car or bike, a very nice ride).
Yachting: When visiting Rotterdam with your own yacht you will find that most yachting harbours are on the inland waterways, were there are a lot of them. On the river Maas you will only find the City Marina, behind a bascule bridge on the southern bank, and the Veerhaven, right in the city center on the northern bank. Unless you need the better shelter of the characterless City Marina, go for the admittedly a little choppy Veerhaven marina, very central and scenic.

Beach[edit]
The closest good beach is about 30 km away at Hook of Holland. Here you will find a very fine sand beach with good swimming and enough entertainment. To get there, take line  B  to Hoek van Holland Strand, its end point.
For a more urban-party beach experience head to Scheveningen where you can find everything beach-party addicts dream about; Endless rows of beachside bars, restaurants and discothèques and a boulevard along a splendid fine-sand beach. It can get very crowded here. Take the train to Den Haag Centraal Station and tram  9  subsequently. Also at the same coast is Kijkduin, which is very recommended for children. To get there, get  E  to its northern end point, then take bus 24 to Kijkduin. If you want to go to the beach but want to stay in the city, consider taking  B  to its end point, Nesselande and walk across the Corsicalaan from there. You are at the Strand Nesselande.

Buy[edit]



This is a huge city article, so detailed listings go in the district articles. This article should only provide a brief overview.

The Koopgoot
The main shopping areas in the center are the 51.9199934.4773041 Lijnbaan and the 51.9206754.4845032 Hoogstraat. Both are pedestrianised. The Lijnbaan, which runs straight south from the Weena (close to Rotterdam Centraal) was the first pedestrianised shopping street in the world when it was built in 1953. Now it is more of an average shopping street with average shops. In weekends it's very crowded. Linking the Lijnbaan with the Hoogstraat is the 51.9200664.4805233 Beurstraverse, dubbed Koopgoot (Buying-gutter). A subterrainean passage, also connecting to Beurs metro station. It's all rather big and somewhat strange for a Dutch city, but it fits perfectly into the Rotterdam aspiration of being different. If you're looking for it, ask for the Koopgoot, as the official name is little known.

Department stores[edit]
The Beurstraverse gives direct access to the city's main department stores:

51.920394.478654 De Bijenkorf (Metro  A , Beurs.). This upmarket store offers a lot in terms of clothing, accessories, jewellery, perfumes and the like. The store offers quality, but it comes at a price. 
51.920074.481865 HEMA, Beursplein 2, 3011 AA Rotterdam (metro  D  to Beurs). This star of Dutch budget shopping has a limited range of clothing, food and hardware. HEMA has a reputation of delivering quality goods at very competitive prices. A lot of what it sells is of a fresh and bright design. (updated Jul 2019)
Markets[edit]
The Markthal in the night
The Markthal from outside
There are about 12 larger and smaller markets dotted around Rotterdam. Most of them are enjoyable places to walk through.

51.921154.487486 Centrummarkt (at the eastern end of the Hoogstraat on the Binnenrotte, Metro  A : Blaak). Oct-Mar: Tu Sa 08:00-17:00; Apr-Sep: Tu Sa 08:00-17:00, Su 12:00-17:00. It is a huge (~450 stalls) open air food and hardware market — a nice place to visit. In Summer also there is a smaller version (~50 stalls). (updated Jul 2016)
51.90114.50147 Afrikaanderplein Markt (south of the river, Metro  D : Maashaven). W Sa 08:00-16:30. This market (~300 stalls) is geared very much towards Rotterdam inhabitants of Antillian, South American or African descent (a lot of whom happen to live nearby). It’s more exotic and colourful than the other one. (updated Jul 2016)
Street food markets[edit]
51.9201264.4867898 Markthal, Ds. Jan Scharpstraat 298 (Binnenrotte, Metro  B : Blaak). Market stands: M-Sa 10:00-20:00, Su 12:00-18:00; Albert Heijn: M-Sa 08:00-21:00, Su 10:00-20:00; Bars and restaurants: 10:00-00:00. Opened in 2014 by a Dutch princess (who else!), It is a quite remarkable building which is worth a visit per se. It's more like a hybrid between a market and a shopping centre. Besides the large market hall, there are also residential, office sections, retail sections. Last but not least the Markthal houses a wide variety of bars, food stalls, and restaurants. Enjoy meals or bites from Mediterranean or Asian cultures or try the famous Rotterdam fries of Bram Ladage. (updated Sep 2017)
 Fenix Food Factory, Veerlaan 19D, 3072 AN Rotterdam. Closed on Monday. Offers food/bites and beers on a unique venue. The building itself is an old warehouse which did not lose much of its original character. Get a food platter and pass along all the shops for breakfast, brunch or snacks. (updated Jul 2019)
Try one or many more of the Kaapse Brouwers beers: there is a whole wall of taps to choose from. This is a popular place so waiting lines can be long.

Eat[edit]



This is a huge city article, so detailed listings go in the district articles. This article should only provide a brief overview.

The area around metrostation Blaak, called Oude haven (Old Harbour), is not only worth seeing but has also a lot of pubs and restaurants. The Rotterdam dining scene is developing very fast with new restaurants opening very often. While most of the attention focusses on new Michelin-star aspiring places, there is very much a trend towards high quality mid-range restaurants offering French/Dutch cuisine.

You can find many gastronomic outlets around the Schouwburgplein
Budget[edit]
51.91754.47431 Café Restaurant Sijf, Oude Binnenweg 115. In weekend open till 02:00. Very nice old-looking bar. They also serve food for a reasonable price and most of the food is home made. Try the grilled beef with Spanish pepper and garlic! Or have one of their great sandwiches or salads. Wanna have a nice Belgium beer that gets you all fuzzy? They have an awesome Belgian beer called “la Chouffe” (the midget) on draft. Very tasty! A good start for the evening. (updated Aug 2023)
51.9174.47172 Rotown, Nieuwe Binnenweg 19, ☏ +31 10 4362669. This is 'the' place in town for creative people.

Mid-range[edit]
The Old Harbour area offers many commendable options for eating out
51.924.49127 (Cocktail)Bar-Restaurant Stockholm, Spaansekade 12 (Old Harbour) (walking distance (5min) from train/tram/bus station Blaak), ☏ +31 10-4147295. M-Th 15:00-01:00, F Sa 15:00-03:00, Su 15:00-01:00, closed on Monday. Two of the best things in gastronomy come together at Bar-Restaurant Stockholm: A high standard yet fair priced French-inspired menu & the exquisite cocktails. Together with the trendy interior and city centre location Stockholm has been a well-earned success for years. €20-30. (updated Aug 2023)
51.924.49078 Café-Restaurant Kade 4, Spaansekade 4 in Oude Haven (Old Harbour) (5 minute walk from train/tram/bus station Blaak), ☏ +31 10 270 9001.

M-Sa 12:00-14:00 and 17:30-00:00, closed on Su and festive days and Sat afternoon. Prepare yourself for something special when visiting this famous eatery. The outside is absolutely rundown (so is the interior) and you must convince yourself to really push open the dark door. Once inside you will be welcomed by waiters in white and you will be allocated directly next to other visitors on benches. Good food is served (traditional Dutch and French fare), cooked in the same space that you're sitting. The place is frequented by Rotterdam businessmen and students and guests should fit in in terms of behaviour and appearance. (Mick Jagger was famously denied access here for not being a gentleman.) €30-40. (updated Aug 2023)
Splurge[edit]
SS Rotterdam also offers culinary delights
51.92254.483410 Restaurant Amarone, Meent 72 (near the City Hall (Stadhuis)), ☏ +31 10 4148487. A culinary gem in the very heart of the city, this stylish restaurant needs to be booked well in advance. Very rewarding French cuisine. Valet parking. €100+. (updated Aug 2023)

Nicely decorated Italian restaurant where you don't just drop by for a simple pizza. As a matter of fact, they don't even serve pizza. With the fine use of herbs, garlic and more interesting stuff that the Italian kitchen has to offer, it is almost impossible to not like this food. The personal is professional and for what you get the prices are actually not too bad. In summer you can eat outside (there is a small terrace at the back). A nice feature of this restaurant is that the kitchen is open until 23:00, something that is not very common in Rotterdam. Around €70. (updated Aug 2023)

Drink[edit]



This is a huge city article, so detailed listings go in the district articles. This article should only provide a brief overview.

Nightlife in Rotterdam is extremely varied, every subculture has its own area in the city. The Oude Haven (close to the Kubuswoningen) and the main market square Blaak are the hang out spot for business, economic and law students. The cafés and restaurants in the Oude Haven (Old Harbour) are around a picturesque little harbour. Scenery of water, city lights, boats and Het Witte Huis, the first skyscraper of Europe (1897). The atmosphere is really great and it is best to go when the sun sets, very romantic! Great place for a night out.
Close to the Oude Haven area, the streets around the Pannenkoekstraat have emerged as a new center for shopping and going out. Amidst small boutiques, selling clothes and interior design by young, upcoming designers, you can find cocktailbars such as Level or Soho, which both attract large crowds. Especially in the summer this is a great place for a mojito.

The Santa Claus statue on Eendrachtsplein impersonates the genius loci
The most lively bar area in town is Eendrachtsplein/Nieuwe Binnenweg. Alternative, easy going and full of friendly, open-minded people. The cafés you should be looking for are Stalles, Parket and Rotown. This is the place to be for the more creative orientated people, musicians, designers and artschool students.
Walk down de Nieuwe Binnenweg and arrive at Café Ari (Nieuwe Binnenweg/Mathenesserlaan) and Westerpaviljoen (grand café with the best terrace in the city). This is a good place to start the evening. Walk a little bit (3 minutes) down the Binnenweg again and go left at 's-Gravendijkwal (you'll see the flashy neon lights of sexclub OQ). Across the street you'll find Jazz Cafe Dizzy. A great place for a quality beer and some live jazz music. You can also eat at almost all places mentioned.
Now walk back the Binnenweg up eastbound. Cross Eendrachtsplein and go to the right towards the Westersingel. Walk 3 minutes and on your left there is the Witte de Withstraat. Some nice café's like De Witte Aap, Mondriaan, Bar P, and De Schouw are found here, along with some good restaurants as well. This is also the most arty street of Rotterdam. Here you'll find Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art, MAMA, showroom for media and moving art and many more. Drinking in style!
If you're into loud music, your best option would be to go to De Baroeg at the "Spinozaweg" in Rotterdam-Lombardijen. Loads of heavy metal acts play here each year. Should you not feel like making your way all the way into sub-urbia, you could also try your luck at the Rhythm on Oude Binnenweg. A popular hang out of alternative types.
The clubscene in Rotterdam is well-renowned. For example, it gave birth to the gabber-housescene in the early 1990s and was home to the Now&Wow, one of the world's trendiest clubs. The Now&Wow is now defunct, but in its last location, an old grain silo near metro station Maashaven, there are still numerous dance parties. Just as with the bar scene, there are clubs that cater for different groups of people. Moreover, Rotterdam nightlife is very dynamic: places come and go, move around, change ownership, etc. It is mostly centered around:

Kruiskade: clubs as Off Corso (housed in an old cinema) and Thalia Lounge have good parties over the weekends and mostly attract 20-somethings.
Stadhuisplein: number of bars and disco's that are more directed towards the working class. The nearby Baja Beach Club (at the Schouwburgplein) attracts a similar crowd. Stadhuisplein is better to be avoided in the weekends due to a lot of aggression! During week days it's mostly students going out, with De Après Skihut full of people every day of the week.
Delftsestraat: the Hollywood is a large disco that fills up quickly in weekends with an overall somewhat younger crowd. The Apres Ski Hut recreates the atmosphere of Tirol in the same colourless street.
Club Vie, near the old harbour area, is a more stylish, trendy club, which also offers nice views over the Maas river.
Some listings that can be found around these places:

Cafe de Unie is a Rotterdam institution
 Stalles, Nieuwe Binnenweg 11a. A small bar next to Parket. They serve a large variety of single malt whiskys. It's pretty small, but very cosy. 
 Grand café Westerpaviljoen, Nieuwe Binnenweg 136. Open till 02:00 in the weekend. Rotterdammers like to read their newspaper here. For a solid breakfast (Dutch “wentelteefjes”), good lunch, or a fast meeting Westerpaviljoen is a perfect place. Hang out on their huge and fantastic terrace, drink a nice glass of Amstel or Hoegaarden White beer. 
 Café De Witte Aap, Witte de Withstraat 78 (Metro: Eendrachtsplein). This classic Rotterdam pub (The White Monkey) draws a very varied and often too large crowd for its premises. It's a cool place to have a few drinks before dinner or before exploring the rest of this very lively neighborhood. 
51.919174.47251 Charly's Lunchroom (Café De Unie), Mauritsweg 34-35 (Eendrachtsplein  A  B  C  4  7  23  25 ). This restaurant/café/art society is a Rotterdam institute. Housed in a magnificent building reminiscent to a Mondriaan painting, being built in the De Stijl-style, it also hosts all kinds of cultural venues and parties. A good place to have coffee too.  (updated Oct 2021)
 Pol Bar, Meent 46-48. In weekends open till 02:00. Nice looking bar with modern solid patio. Crowd can be sort of posh sometimes, but don't let that scare you too much. Right next to the market (Tuesday and Thursday), and they won some prices with their sandwiches. 
 Paddy Murphy's. This Irish pub is really Irish. Green and wooden colors and a bar crew who only speaks English. Live music every night! On Monday there's pub bingo. In the weekends the entrance fee is €2.50. (updated Mar 2017)
51.923054.500272 De Pui, Oostzeedijk Beneden 221 (Metro: Oostplein). Very nice bar in a corner building in the heart of Kralingen. Recognizable by the distinguished red awnings. There are students there, but it is not a student pub. There are musicians there, but it is not a musicians cafe. There are businessmen there, but that makes it no business cafe. It is the mixture of people and taste, that makes it so enjoyable. (updated Oct 2021)
 Tiki's, Hartmansstraat 16/A (between Witte de Withstraat and Westblaak). Don't let the cheesy Hawaiian interior put you off. Frequented by an alternative arty crowd, with rockabilly and ska (and occasionally Ethiopian jazz) on the loudspeakers. Cocktails and small dinner menu. 
Coffeeshops[edit]
Some tourists come to Rotterdam for its coffeeshops
As everywhere in the Netherlands, the possession (of small quantities) and use of cannabis (hash and weed) is tolerated in Rotterdam. Since Amsterdam draws more coffee-shop tourism prices are lower in Rotterdam.
Some renowned places:

Coffeeshop "De lachende paus" ("The laughing pope", Nieuwe Binnenweg): A shop where you can buy over 40 kinds of pre-rolled joints (voorgedraaide in Dutch). The prices can be high, but it's worth a visit.
Coffeeshop "Pluto" (Nieuwe Binnenweg 139a): Actually a headshop. They also sell loads of paraphernalia like pipes, and bongs.
Coffeeshop "Greenhouse" (Nieuwe Binnenweg) Ditto.
Coffeeshop "The Reefer" (De Meent, City center)
Coffeeshop "The Pool" (Westersingel, 5 m from Central Station): A nice Coffeeshop on the 1st floor where you can sit and relax by a table or bar. Or play some pool on the 2nd and 3rd floor.
Coffeeshop the "Act" / Cafe "De Nieuwe Wet" (Westerwagenstraat): Since the mid-1990s the sale of alcohol and cannabis in the same place has been made illegal. The natural solution? Split your coffeeshop and pub into two separate entities, with only one door.
Coffeeshop "Nemo" (Nieuwe Binnenweg): Unlike many coffeeshops this place is bright, open and airy with large windows and comfortable seats; the walls are covered in a (Disney) Nimo-esque montage and the music is more relaxed than many coffeeshops. A good place for someone wanting something softer than many other coffeeshops.
Possessing large quantities of hasheesh or cannabis is a crime in the Netherlands: do not take stuff with you when leaving the Netherlands (you can be punished severely in neighbouring countries). It's also unwise to buy for someone else, especially if it's a foreigner as you can be punished in his or her country of origin (it has happened).
Smoking tobacco is banned inside food and drink establishments — even coffeeshops! But tobacco smoking appears to be tolerated in coffee shops, and their pre-rolled joints are often mixed with tobacco.

Music venues[edit]
Rotown where smaller international and national indie artists perform.
WORM, venue focused on underground and avant garde music
Roodkapje, a gallery that also host various parties
Poortgebouw, a venue run by the squatters that live in the building.

Connect[edit]
The telephone country code for the Netherlands is 31, and Rotterdam's city code is 010. In case of an Emergency, dial 1-1-2 (free of charge).
When staying for a longer time, buy a prepaid sim card for your mobile phone.

Stay safe[edit]
You should take normal precautions against pickpockets and baggage theft, especially in the main shopping streets, at markets, in trams and trains, at stations, and anywhere where tourists congregate.
It is not wise to hang around Stadhuisplein when nightlife ends. Fights often occur in this area after midnight. Rotterdam also has a reputation of mass venues getting out of hand, though you shouldn't worry too much about it. If violence breaks out at football festivities (not so unlikely) or at the end of sun soaked festive days, like Kings Day (even less unlikely, especially at the Stadhuisplein), just get out of the way and you're unlikely to be affected. It's advisable not to wear a football jersey of Ajax Amsterdam or any other stuff promoting Ajax or Amsterdam.
In terms of general safety, at daylight most areas in the city are safe. But at night, some areas such as Spangen, Charlois and Hillesluis are wise to avoid.
As of the end of 2022/beginning of 2023, many explosions at the front doors of houses occurred across the entire city. These were related to drug crime and targeted at people involved in drug trafficking, or their family. Explosions mostly happened at night. 
When you drive a car with a foreign numberplate (especially if it's a French or Belgian one) you might or will be approached by so-called drugsrunners. This can occur on the motorways surrounding the city and in the city proper. These guys try to lure people to places where drugs are dealt. Do not respond to their signals and do not follow them.

With Rotterdam on the major high-speed line through the Benelux, there is a number of day trips and longer ones you can take out of the city by train
Go next[edit]
If you do not have a car, the hub for leaving the city will probably be Rotterdam Centraal, from where trains leave in all directions at short intervals (you can generally drop in and catch the next train to your destination). Most regional and longer distance buses leave here too, with the exception of most buses to southerly destinations and the province of Zeeland that leave from metro station Zuidplein. In contrast with the trains, bus departure times should be checked in advance as they can be far and between.
For trains to the North and the South travellers can also choose to depart from Rotterdam Blaak.
The Hague can also be reached easily and rather quickly by metro line E.
Nearby destinations like Schiedam or even Delft can also be reached by bike if you fancy a somewhat longer ride. Bike routes and directions are well marked and available in abundance. A good idea for a sunny day! Schiedam can be reached by train or by metro (in 15 minutes) too. MRDH is the area of the region Rotterdam-Schiedam-Delft-The Hague, see this page for more information on travel and cycling.

Nearby[edit]
Kinderdijk — a UNESCO World Heritage site. 19 old windmills are still helping to control the water level there. Windmill #2 is open to the public (€3), allowing you to see its inner workings. In season there is a direct waterbus service from an embankment at the Erasmus bridge (travel time ~1/2 hour). Alternatively, Arriva bus 90 from bus and metro station Zuidplein will get you there in 50 minutes.
Schiedam — visit the historic centre of this small town at the edge of Rotterdam, including the world's six tallest windmills. Also you can find there the Stedelijk Museum, an attractive museum with some nice modern art exhibitions. Easily reached by bicycle, a train (from Rotterdam Centraal to Schiedam Centrum), metro A, B or C line to Schiedam Centrum station, or tram lines 21 or 24 (Broersvest or Koemarkt stop).
Hoek van Holland is a part of the Rotterdam municipality and it's 30 km from Rotterdam. On hot summer days it serves as Rotterdam's beach town, overlooking large ships leaving the port of Rotterdam, including the ferries to the United Kingdom.
Day trips[edit]
Delft — this famous town is a 15-minute train ride from Rotterdam Centraal. Very historic and scenic, but also very touristy.
Dordrecht — a magnificent historic town with little tourism and an excellent old art museum (Dordrechts Museum). It is a 15-min train ride, or even better, take a waterbus[dead link].
Gouda —  visit this small picturesque postcard-like town and see the magnificent stained glass windows in the Sint Janskerk. Also 20 min by train.
Delta Works — a series of construction projects protecting the Southwest of the Netherlands from the sea. The Oosterschelde storm surge barrier is the most impressive, and next to it is Neeltje Jans, a water theme park dedicated to the Delta Works.
Brielle — a mediaeval fortified town. The centre is a nice ensemble of old houses and churches, enclosed by the original earthen defensive walls. There are some museums and the Roman Catholic shrine of the Martyrs of Gorcum. Walking around town and fortifications is a treat. You can easily spend a full day in Brielle. Take bus 103 at the Spijkenisse Centrum metro station. A journey takes about 70 min.
Schoonhoven — a nice small town with many well preserved medieval buildings on the Lek river in a halfway to Utrecht. From Station Capelsebrug, Rotterdam, take a bus 195 (direction Utrecht). A journey takes about 1 hour.
Go to the other cities of the Randstad, e.g. The Hague is 1/2 hour by train or metro, Utrecht is around 45 min by train, Amsterdam about an hour.
