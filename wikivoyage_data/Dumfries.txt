Dumfries is the principal town of Dumfries and Galloway in southwest Scotland. It's a pleasant market town, with a population of 46,500 in 2020.
Robert Burns (1759-1796) the poet spent his last years here: from 1788 to 1791 at Ellisland Farm 7 miles north, then in Dumfries town until his death, aged 37. Sites associated with him are the main reason to visit, and it's also a good base for exploring the Dumfriesshire countryside. For travellers to and from Ireland who need a stopover, Dumfries may be a better choice than the port of Stranraer.


Understand[edit]
The Dumfries area is lowland and sits on red sandstone, well-drained and fertile. The town grew up east of the lowest crossing point and tidal limit of the River Nith - Maxwelltown on the west bank was separate until merged with Dumfries in 1929. Although it's a burgh of great antiquity, few of the buildings are very old, as invading armies kept wrecking the place. The last such visitor was Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1745, who demanded money and shoes for his men. But the Duke of Cumberland was marching down on him so he and his Jacobite forces scarpered, none too nimbly as few of the shoes had been handed over. 
Dumfries is on the transport route between England and Northern Ireland. It's grown rapidly and its industry and transport depend upon these UK links; in 2016 it voted heavily against Scottish independence.

By train[edit]
Scotrail trains run every 2 or 3 hours from Glasgow Central, taking 1 hour 50 min via Kilmarnock and Sanquhar, and continuing from Dumfries to Annan, Gretna Green and Carlisle.
From England, take the train towards Glasgow or Edinburgh and change at Carlisle. From Glasgow it's almost as quick to come via Carlisle as by the direct train. 
55.0722-3.60441 Dumfries railway station  is east side of town centre. It has a staffed ticket office and machines, a cafe, toilets and waiting room. There is step-free access to Platform 1, which in practice all trains use. There are steps and no lift for the bridge to Platform 2. Plusbus is available at this station.

Houston's Bus 6A runs south from Dumfries along B725 via Kingholm Quay to Glencaple and Caerlaverock Castle. It runs M-Sa every 3 hours — three hours is longer than you need for the castle, so you could tramp along the road for an hour either north to Kingholm Quay or east to Ruthwell, both of which have more frequent buses back to Dumfries.

This is the remains of a Cistercian Abbey founded in 1275 (hence the nearby village is called "New Abbey"; the old abbey was Dundrennan to the west near Kirkcudbright). It was founded by Devorguilla in memory of her husband John de Balliol, and she also endowed the Oxford college named for him.

Impressive twin-towered triangular castle surrounded by a water filled moat. It was completed in 1270 and wrecked and rebuilt until 1640 when it was abandoned. It's scenic and often used as a film location.

North of town[edit]
55.0978-3.651710 Twelve Apostles is a stone circle off A76 near Newbridge, about 100 m in diameter. The design is similar to the circles of Cumbria. Eleven boulders remain; the lost 12th apostle has inevitably been dubbed "Judas Iscariot", but as he only disappeared circa 1800, he'd had a good run for his money.
55.1372-3.680711 Ellisland Farm, Holywood Rd, Auldgirth DG2 0RP (7 miles north of town along A76), ☏ +44 1387 740426. Sa-Tu 11AM-4PM. Robert Burns came out from Edinburgh and took the lease on this farmland in 1788, his last spell of farming for a living. He had to build the farmhouse and byres, so it was only the following year that his family could move in — he'd finally married Jean Armour. Poetically this was his most productive period — "Tam O'Shanter" was written here. The farm remains much as it was, rearing cattle and sheep on the banks of the Nith. But it didn't pay its way and Burns could earn more as an exciseman, so in 1791 he gave it up and moved into Dumfries. The public drunkenness at the closing auction shocked even him. Adult £5, child £2.50. (updated May 2022)
Portrack Garden of Cosmic Speculation is a mile south of Ellisland Farm off A76. It's a wacky garden and sculpture park inspired by science: quarks, fractals, and black-hole distortions of space-time, insofar as it's possible (or indeed prudent) to re-create these in rural Dumfriesshire. It's only open one day a year as part of the Scotland's Gardens charity scheme, usually the Sunday of the first May Bank Holiday. Adults £10, children free.
55.158-3.759212 Lag Tower is a dilapidated keep and barmekin up a lane west of Auldgirth. It's 16th century.

Castle Jul-Aug: F-M 11AM-4PM; gardens Apr-Sep: daily 11AM-4PM. Impressive 17th-century Renaissance "pink palace", interior by guided tour only, with 120 rooms, 17 turrets and four towers. It houses the Buccleuch collection of artwork, furniture and silver. Set in extensive gardens and estate with various activities for adults & children (think zip-wires). The Galloway Country Fair is held here in August each year. Adult £15, conc £12, child £7.   (updated May 2022)
Morton Castle is a jagged stump two miles east of Drumlanrig. Not much left of this remote 13th century Hall, the fun is in trying to find it, then having it to yourself. At Carronbridge leave A76 for A702 and take the second right. Always open, free.
Durisdeer Parish Church is an attractive Georgian building off A701 over the hills into Clydesdale.
55.41788-3.2867614 Grey Mare's Tail Waterfall is one of Scotland's finest, a 60-m cascade in the Moffat hills. The walk to it continues up past the falls and to beautiful Loch Skeen, ringed by craggy hillsides. It's on A708 about 30 miles and an hour's drive from Dumfries.

Mountain biking at Seven Stanes course at Mabie Forest (south on A710), with another course at Ae Forest.
Climb Criffel, 10 miles south of Dumfries off A710. It's 1870 ft (570 m), so it's not a Munro, it's a Marilyn, but because it rears up in isolation from a low plain, it's prominent and commands all-round views. The usual route is from Ardwall by Loch Kindar: there's parking up the lane. It's a short steep ascent through forest, becoming boggy on the summit heathland, reckon 3 hours there and back.

It's available for self-catering, sleeping six in two double rooms and one suite; it's off A76 ten miles north of Dumfries. Don't gripe at the lack of a lift: until 1748 there were no stairs, and people had to shin up a ladder.
Trigony House is a pleasant country house hotel on the main road near Closeburn.
Sanquhar is 28 miles north up the A76, but if you're going that way you might splurge at Blackaddie Country House Hotel, B&B double £200 in 2022.
Stay safe[edit]
Obvious stuff: beware traffic, safeguard valuables and avoid the occasional idiot drunk.
Also, avoid getting drunk yourself and falling victim to Burke and Hare. No bodysnatchers they: they preyed on Edinburgh's down-and-outs, got them drunk, snuffed them out and sold the corpses for dissection. Hare turned prosecution witness against Burke, who was hanged in 1829, while Hare was given immunity and smuggled out of town to Dumfries. He may have been making for his origins in Ulster, but he was recognised and a furious mob besieged him at the Kings Arms Hotel (now Boots on High Street). He was taken into protective custody and early next morning set down on the road to Annan, and advised to leg it to England. There are no further reliable sightings and his fate is unknown.

Connect[edit]
