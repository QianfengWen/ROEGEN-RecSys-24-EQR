Chatham
Chatham-Kent is a municipality of 104,000 people (2021) which includes the former city of Chatham in southwestern Ontario, between Windsor and London. The municipality is defined as all of Kent County including Blenheim, Chatham, Dresden, Ridgetown, Tilbury and Wallaceburg.
Chatham was established in the 1790s as a naval dockyard on the Thames River. In the War of 1812, the Battle of the Thames was fought on October 5, 1813; the area is also included in the signed African-Canadian Heritage Tour route as a part of the Underground Railroad.
