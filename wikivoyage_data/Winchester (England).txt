Winchester is an historic cathedral city in the county of Hampshire, South East England. Erstwhile capital of the country, it was from here that Alfred the Great governed much of unified England. Visitors appreciate Winchester first and foremost for its cathedral, but also for its other ancient buildings, its medieval centre, its markets and museums.

Understand[edit]
Winchester has a long history: there has been continuous settlement on the site for over 2,000 years.
Winchester began as a Celtic hill fort, pre-dating the Roman invasion of Britain in 43 CE. After the Roman conquest, the town grew and became known as Venta Belgarum. After prospering under Roman imperial rule for several centuries, Winchester discovered a new identity as an important Saxon city. King Alfred the Great named Winchester as the capital, first of the Kingdom of Wessex and later all of England south of the Danelaw – despite the growing importance of London, it remained so until the Norman Conquest of 1066. During the Middle Ages, Winchester was renowned for its woollen goods, among other produce.
In 1649, Oliver Cromwell – the (in)famous English general and later dictator – ordered Winchester Castle to be destroyed after winning the seven-year English Civil War.
Winchester is now an attractive and peaceful cathedral city deep in the southern English countryside, close to London and Southampton.
A visitor staying in London but with a day to spare and a desire to see more of England could do much worse than simply travelling to Winchester by train (which is a pleasant way to see some of the Hampshire countryside) and spend the day wandering around this ancient city.

Get around[edit]
51°3′33″N 1°19′41″WMap of Winchester (England)
If you are planning to do any visiting or exploring beyond central Winchester, you will probably want to obtain a decent map of the area. You should ensure that any map you buy clearly shows the national grid reference lines, and explains how to use them, as grid references are frequently used to indicate out of town locations. The best maps for this purpose are those published by the Ordnance Survey (Britain's national mapping agency) and the following maps cover all the locations mentioned below:

Ordnance Survey Landranger 185. This map covers the area around Winchester at a scale of 1:50000 and is best for exploration by car or cycle.
Ordnance Survey Explorer 132. This map covers the area around Winchester at a scale of 1:25000 and is best for walking.
These maps can be found in any good local bookshop, or can be bought online.

By foot[edit]
Most of the things to see and do in Winchester, and the places to eat, drink and sleep are within easy walking distance of each other and the rail station. There are several attractive walks in the surrounding countryside, particularly towards Twyford along the Water Meadows, and on Old Winchester Hill.

By bus[edit]
Winchester has a reasonable bus service, both within the town and to the surrounding area, although frequencies can be quite low with little service in the evenings or on Sunday.

 Stagecoach in Hampshire, ☏ 0845-121-0180 (non-geographic number). operate most of the bus services in the city and surrounding area. 
 Bluestar, ☏ +44 1202 338421. operates the Bluestar 1 from the city to Southampton

By car[edit]
Winchester is quite small and a car is unlikely to be necessary for getting around. In addition, town centre parking can be difficult; if visiting for the day consider using the Park and Ride described above. Visitors with mobility problems can arrange to borrow a wheelchair or electric scooter through the Shopmobility office situated in the Brooks car park, off Friarsgate Street.

See[edit]
Winchester's city centre is known for its narrow pedestrian streets and overhanging medieval buildings. Besides the cathedral, the main landmark is the Statue of King Alfred the Great, first king and nominal founder of England. Nearby is the Victorian Guildhall, which hosts many events throughout the year. Also of special interest are the Pentice, a group of old shops arcaded at the front, and the Butter Cross, dating back to the 15th century and built with a tax levied on people caught eating butter during Lent. The River Itchen, a crystal clear chalk stream, flows through multiple channels in central Winchester, seemingly just to surprise visitors by its tinkling presence at every turn.

Landmarks[edit]

Choir, Winchester Cathedral
51.0592-1.31441 Church of St. Swithun upon Kingsgate, Saint Swithun Street, SO23 9JP (perched atop the arch of the Kingsgate, one of the two surviving city gates). Open during daylight hours except for occasional services.. This was once a not uncommon position for a place of worship in England, but St. Swithun's is the only one remaining today. The interior of this tiny church is very plain, with whitewashed walls and an unadorned wooden ceiling. Sit for a moment in the simple wooden pews and it is hard not to feel a sense of peace.

A Norman cathedral begun in 1079, containing the Winchester Bible and featuring the longest Gothic nave in the world. The cathedral was built on rafts floating on a peat marsh! For 800 years the raft was able to carry the weight but, by the 19th century, the cathedral was in danger of collapse and the foundations were rebuilt by a diver working underwater; look out for the statue and story of this "Winchester Diver" if you visit. The cathedral is the venue for regular recitals and concerts, and hosts Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra's Summer Series. The famous English novelist Jane Austen died in Winchester in 1817 and is buried in the cathedral. A statue by British artist Anthony Gormley is to be found, somewhat unexpectedly, in the crypt of the cathedral. Hidden away in cathedral Close is the Dean Garnier Garden, which offers splendid views of the cathedral. Pay special attention to the stonework, and how the medieval builders suffered from problems with subsidence. Adults £7.50; concessions £5.50; students £4; under 16s free.

Drink[edit]
England is known for its public houses, and Winchester - being the ancient heart of England - is no exception. Winchester has a good selection of city centre pubs, many of which are noted in the Real Ale bible 'The Good Beer Guide', and a few that are worth taking a stroll and the time to discover.
This plethora of pubs means that Winchester is not saturated with one type of beer. It is in the enviable position that there are many brewers represented in the city. Although the best approach is to wander around and to go into the one you like the look of, there are a few that may not reveal their delights until you venture inside.
