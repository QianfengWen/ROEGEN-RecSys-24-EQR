Brigham City is a city in Utah known for its peaches. It holds an annual celebration called Peach Days on the second weekend in September. It is a good base for visiting the Golden Spike National Historic Park where the American transcontinental railroad was completed. It is an important center for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the Mormons).


Understand[edit]
The city is named for Brigham Young, an important figure in Mormon history of the 19th century.
The transcontinental railroad was completed not far from here in 1869 just four years after the end of the Civil War.
In 2018, it had a population of about 19,000 people.

Promontory Summit[edit]
Last Spike, May 10 1869
Thirty miles to the west, you'll find Promontory Summit and the symbolic last spike which completed the Trans-Continental Railroad and joined East to West in 1869. The trip around the world overland described in Around the World in Eighty Days in 1872 passed through this point when crossing the United States of America. By 1904, Promontory Summit had been bypassed; the original tracks were removed in 1942.

Robert Smithson's 1970 earthwork sculpture forms a coil 1,500 feet long and 15 feet wide; over 6000 tons of black basalt rocks and earth winds counterclockwise off the shore into the water. The water level in the lake fluctuates, so at times the sculpture is submerged and not easily visible.
