See[edit]
Cheese market
Although Edam is small there are quite some things to see and do.

 Carillion Tower (De Speeltoren). 
 Cheese market, in the centre of town. The original commercial cheese market, as it was held here for a long time, was cancelled in the 1920s. In 1989 it was re-installed, mostly of course for tourist purposes. It is held only in July and August, on Wednesdays, and organized largely by volunteers. Although a bit of a, well, cheesy tourist attraction, the market is still fun to see. It's become a folklorist event, with traditional costumes worn for the occasion, music and games. Explanations are given in English, too. (updated Oct 2016)
