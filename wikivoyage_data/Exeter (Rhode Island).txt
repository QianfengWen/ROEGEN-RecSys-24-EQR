Exeter is a small, spread-out town in southwestern Rhode Island. Exeter is noted by folklorists as the site of one of the best documented examples of vampire exhumation: the Mercy Brown Vampire Incident of 1892. 


Understand[edit]
Its population was 6,425 in 2010.

History[edit]
The town of Exeter was formed in 1742 from the western part of North Kingstown. The name Exeter is derived from the county town and cathedral city of Exeter in Devon, England. 
After several cases of consumption (tuberculosis) occurred in the family of George and Mary Brown in Exeter in 1982, friends and neighbors believed that this was due to the influence of the undead. George Brown was persuaded to give permission to exhume several bodies of his family members in order to perform rituals to banish an undead manifestation. As superstition dictated, Mercy Brown's heart and liver were burned, and the ashes were mixed with water to create a tonic and was given to a sick person to drink, as an effort to resolve his illness and stop the influence of the undead. The young man died two months later. What remained of Mercy's body was buried in the cemetery of the Baptist Church in Exeter after being desecrated. The incident was part of the wider New England vampire panic.

41.5539-71.54281 The Ladd School, 162 Main St. At the turn of the twentieth century, institutions for the mentally and physically disabled began to dot the United States, separating them from the psychiatric population residing in the asylums. After the successes of the schools in Massachusetts and Connecticut, it was soon proposed that an institution should be built for the state of Rhode Island in the rural town of Exeter.The Rhode Island School for the Feeble Minded was founded in 1907 as a farm colony for the residents to work and learn, with Dr. Joseph Ladd as the superintendent. The patient population grew quickly, and in 1909 a dormitory was erected as the other was full; the new building would be for girls only. In 1917 the name of the facility changed to The Exeter School as the term "feeble-minded" (amongst many other medical terms) were becoming objectionable at the time. As the facility grew in size and population, funding became more scarce, and the school began to deteriorate into an overcrowded place to put the state's unwanted as many other state funded institutions did at the time. In the 1960s the facility had over 1,000 patients, and was re-named the Ladd Center in memory of its first superintendent.Although abandoned today, visitors are able to view the buildings from afar and wander the grounds. A great destination for paranormal sitings.
