Deadhorse (pop. 25) is a town 10 miles (16 km) from Prudhoe Bay and the Arctic Ocean in Arctic Alaska at the end of the Dalton Highway.


Understand[edit]
Like the Dalton Highway, Deadhorse exists to support oil operations in Prudhoe Bay.  While the official population is 25, the town boasts a non-permanent population of 2,000-3,000 employees of the various oil operations. Like Coldfoot and the camp at Mile 60, the facilities for visitors are the same as those built to house construction workers for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. All facilities are simple, prefabricated buildings which were brought to Deadhorse on barge or via the Dalton. Commodities, having to be shipped great distances, are expensive.
The settlement dates to the 1967 discovery of the Prudhoe Bay oil field. While the origin of the town's name is unclear, the most common theory is that it refers to the original airfield runway, which was built with gravel hauled by trucking company Dead Horse Hauling.
Deadhorse has no direct access to the Arctic Ocean, which is 10 miles (16 km) away. Special advanced access/tours (via oil field personnel permission, requiring photo ID and right of refusal) may visit Prudhoe Bay... but, even then, not all tours reach the bay. The mere idea that someone would travel so far, with so little to see at the end of the road, may earn a few blank stares from the oil folk.

Get in[edit]
See also: Dalton_Highway
The town is at the northern terminus, Mile 414, of the Dalton Highway which provides a land link year-round to Fairbanks.

70.1975-148.4751 Deadhorse Airport (SCC  IATA), 500 1st St. A modest airport which functions year-round. The airport is served by commercial flights (i.e. Boeing 737-400C aircraft, special: half cargo, half passengers) from Alaska Airlines, normally from Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Utqiaġvik (Barrow). (Ravn Alaska filed for bankruptcy in Apr 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic). You should try to contact your travel agency, or contact the airline. There are also several charter services which can provide flights to this airport, some offering tours which drive up the Dalton, then fly back (or vice versa).   (updated Apr 2020)
Get around[edit]
Deadhorse as seen from the air
The town is rather small and during the summer months walking is very feasible although there are no sidewalks and large oil field equipment and trucks demand constant vigilance. During the winter, extreme temperatures make walking, even short distances, very uncomfortable and exposure to such temperatures can be lethal. While the town is not very large, driving is the best option most of the year.

See and do[edit]
The Dalton Highway ends just a few miles inland of the Arctic Ocean and only private, restricted roads extend to the ocean. Fortunately, tours can be booked through the hotels in the town which not only take you to the ocean and its gravel beach (where you can take a frigid dip, joining the "Polar Bear Club") but also include a tour of the oilfield and operations. The ocean is ice-free from late July to October.

Buy[edit]
The town contains a small, and pricey, general store as well as two fuel stations. The post office is in the store.

70.208839-148.4071031 Prudoe Bay General Store (Brooks Range Supply inc), 1 Old Spine Road, Prudhoe Bay, ☏ +1 907 659-2550. Daily 5AM-9PM. The Prudoe Bay General Store has a rich history serving folks in the oil field which continues today.  The General Store has always been regarded as the place to go for everything you need—and news.  The store is located upstairs in the Brooks Range Supply facility on Old Spine Road in Deadhorse.  Now you can shop for industrial supplies downstairs at Brooks Range Supply, then head upstairs for Arctic gear, warm socks, boots, clothing, sunglasses, electronics, music, smokes, personal sundries, books, magazines and Native crafts. (updated Jul 2023)
70.215898-148.4007052 Colville Retail Fuel Station, 100 Sag River Road, Prudhoe Bay, ☏ +1 907 659-3198. Alaska's northernmost gas station. 
Eat[edit]
There are a couple of restaurants in town as part of the hotels such as the Caribou Inn.

Drink[edit]
Alcohol is not available. In a harsh environment like this, exposure to the elements is a grave danger which can easily occur while intoxicated.
The North Slope Borough is considered dry.  Oil field operations areas also forbid alcohol.

Sleep[edit]
There are a few hotels in town.

70.225927-148.3987081 Arctic Oilfield Hotel, 1 Spine Road, Prudhoe Bay, ☏ +1 844 663-2269. Hotel with a restaurant, fitness center, snack bar, wi-fi, and laundry facilities. (updated Oct 2020)
70.203832-148.4565152 The Aurora Hotel, 123 Lake Colleen Road, ☏ +1 907 670-0600, aurora@iceservices.net. Hotel with a library, game room, gym, wi-fi, and espresso shop. (updated Oct 2020)
70.200708-148.4585083 Prudhoe Bay Motel, Pouch 340004, ☏ +1 907 659-2449. At the end of the Alaska's Dalton Highway and on the edge of Prudhoe Bay Oil field, provides accommodations for both visitors touring the state of Alaska as well as workers of the North Slope. Very simple accomodations. (updated Jun 2016)
Stay safe[edit]
This area has a polar climate. The coldest recorded wind chill here was -102°F (-74°C)! During the winter, exposure to the elements can prove lethal.
Like nearly all wild areas in Alaska, grizzly bears are a concern.  Don't leave any food lying around including waste food containers, and keep an eye out for bears when walking around. Polar bears are present in the coastal areas predominantly during August and September but can be found at any time during the year. Polar bears are both extremely dangerous and protected, so do not approach or harass the bears and get to a building or vehicle. Whenever exiting a building, immediately scan your surroundings for polar bears.

Go next[edit]
Remember when leaving that there are no services for 240 miles (386 km) until you reach Coldfoot! Aside from that, Alaska Airlines provides service to Utqiaġvik (Barrow) and several charter air services can provide access to numerous small towns along the Arctic coast and North Slope. Head to the general store at the airport for more information.
