Plaza Hidalgo is the main town square in General Cepeda
General Cepeda is a small town in the Northern Mexico state of Coahuila. Travelers with an interest in archaeology and paleontology will like this place because a number of fossils and dinosaur bones were found nearby, leading to the establishment of a local paleontology museum. There are also petroglyphs nearby that are thought to be as much as 10,000 years old (just like my mother-in-law). 


Understand[edit]
The town was established during Mexico's colonial heyday in 1575. Originally named San Francisco de los Patos, the settlement consisted largely of a hacienda owned by Francisco de Urdiñola. It was renamed General Cepeda in 1892 in honor of former Coahuila state governor and army general, Victoriano Cepeda. Cepeda distinguished himself in battles against the French army during the Second French Incursion. It's a small town of about 4400 residents (2010) with a quiet small-town vibe. The town is designated as one of Mexico's Pueblos Mágicos.
This area of Coahuila is mountainous and fairly dry (though not desert). There's not really a "rainy season" in General Cepeda, but when the town does get rain, it's likely to be in the summer months. The mountains that fill the skyline are referred to as the Sierra de Los Patos (Duck Mountains).

Map of General Cepeda
By car[edit]
From Saltillo, it is 65 km to General Cepeda. Use federal highway MEX-40 west of Saltillo for about 40 km, then turn left on Coahuila highway 130 south for another 20 km. 

By bus[edit]
Second-class buses operated by Transportes José María Morelos make twice daily trips from Saltillo to General Cepeda. Other bus lines go from Saltillo to Puebla, Coahuila where you can take a taxi the rest of the way to General Cepeda. 

Get around[edit]
The town itself is quite small and compact and you can easily walk around the cobblestone streets of the historic downtown, but there is a lot to see and do outside town, so a car would be useful (though hiring a taxi is probably easier for most travelers). There are several ejidos in the area (communal indigenous lands) where access may be restricted or require an entrance fee.
