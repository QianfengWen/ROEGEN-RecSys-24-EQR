Templo de San Francisco Javier
Tepotzotlán has a long and fascinating history, having been established by the Otomi indigenous people as early as 2500 B.C. The city is in Mexico State, 40 km northeast of Mexico City. It is a popular weekend destination for residents of Mexico City, who come for the colonial charm, the shopping, and the local food.


Understand[edit]
Topotzotlan was settled by the Otomi, who came under the dominion of Teotihuacan, until that city declined. During the Aztec empire, it was part of an alliance with the Aztec that protected it from predations. During the Spanish colonial era, it was a religious stronghold from 1525 onward. It was a place where large churches, cathedrals, and colleges were built to train monks. The Jesuits built a large college campus called the College of San Francisco Javier in 1580, but it was turned over to diocesan clergy when Jesuits were expelled from Mexico in 1767. Many haciendas were built in the area to promote economic development.
Tepotzotlán is a designated  UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is one of 60 designated historic sites along the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro. Tepotzotlán has been designated by the federal government's department of tourism (SECTUR) as a Pueblo Magico in recognition of its tourist appeal.
