Downtown Harrodsburg, KY
Harrodsburg[dead link] is a small city in Mercer County located in the Bluegrass Region of Kentucky.


Understand[edit]
Harrodsburg, the first permanent English settlement west of the Allegheny Mountains, was the site of a fort built by James Harrod in 1775.
In 1805, Shaker Village of Pleasant Hill, or Shakertown, was founded when 44 converts to the Shaker religion signed a covenant agreeing to mutual support and the common ownership of property. Dissolved in 1910, it is now preserved as a restored historic landmark.
