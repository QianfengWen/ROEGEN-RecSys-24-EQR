Riviera Beach is a city in Palm Beach County, Florida. It is a harbor city located along the shores of the Atlantic Ocean in Southeast Florida.  The 75 degree weather is year around and makes the beaches great for sporting events.


Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Palm Beach International Airport (PBIA IATA), located in neighboring West Palm Beach, is a small airport serving most major cities in the Eastern and Midwest United States, along with a handful of international destinations in the Caribbean. From the airport, Riviera Beach's Blue Heron Boulevard exit is about 12 miles north on I-95. Riviera Beach is also accessible from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL IATA), which serves a greater variety of domestic and international destinations. Further afield, Miami International Airport (MIA IATA) has flights to most American cities along with Europe and the Middle East.

By train[edit]
Intercity passenger rail service is pretty non-existent in Riviera Beach proper, but Amtrak has a station in neighboring West Palm Beach served by the Silver Star, Silver Meteor, and Palmetto lines connecting to elsewhere in Florida and other cities on the Eastern Seaboard. West Palm Beach is also served by the new Brightline, which offers higher-speed connections to Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and by 2022, Orlando. Both stations are located in downtown West Palm Beach, which can be reached via I-95.
The regional Tri-Rail commuter line connects destinations in Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade Counties, including the Fort Lauderdale and Miami airports. The closest station to Riviera Beach is located in the community of Mangonia Park, just north of West Palm Beach. The station can be accessed from most of the city via US-1 or President Barack Obama Highway, east of I-95, or by PalmTran bus. Facilities are very minimal - little more than an outdoor platform with an automated ticket machine and a parking lot. If using the train to venture to other destinations within South Florida, be aware that the stations are located several miles west of the beach and most cities' downtown cores - great for commuters who have a station close to home, but a little inconvenient for travelers attempting to tour the area without a car, unless you're willing to connect via a ride-share service at both ends of your trip.

By boat[edit]
The Port of Palm Beach is located in Riviera Beach. While it mainly serves cargo ships, there's an occasional overnight cruise to Grand Bahama. Riviera Beach also hosts one of the area's better marinas, with slips available from $3-4 per foot, per day.

By car[edit]
I-95 serves as the main north-south thoroughfare connecting Riviera Beach to other destinations within South Florida and beyond. Exit 76 (Blue Heron Boulevard) is the main entry point for Riviera Beach, most of which lies on the east side of the interstate. The ritzy Singer Island neighborhood is accessible either via the Blue Heron Boulevard Bridge, or from the north (but not the south) via State Route A1A.

 Sailfish Marina Resort, ☏ +1 561-844-1724. 7AM-9PM. Base for sightseeing tours. $10-$30. 
Do[edit]
Riviera Beach Marina Village aims to transform the city into a tourist destination on par with neighboring Jupiter, Delray Beach, and Boca Raton and serves as a hub for watersports and boating tours in the city. Several retailers located within the marina offer a comparable menu of rentals, charters, private tours (from parasailing to snorkeling to sunset cruises), and lessons. Expect a stand-up paddleboard rental to set you back $30/hour, a kayak $50 for 2 hours, snorkeling gear $30 for 2 hours and other craft like jet skis and small powerboats $100-200+. Tour and lesson prices vary by what's being offered, length, and time of day, but anything from $40 to $200 per person is typical. The marina also offers a small park with splash bad, a restaurant, and a short beach.

Peanut Island
26.771514-80.0459452 Peanut Island (east of the Marina Village and Port of Palm Beach in the middle of Lake Worth Lagoon), ☏ +1 561-777-0438. Water taxis every 25 minutes, 10AM-5PM (last boat to the island 3:30PM). The county-run Peanut Island Park is an extremely popular destination for day trips. On busy weekend, expect to see the waters surrounding the island absolutely packed with small boats, which drop anchor in the lagoon as a base for drinking while their passengers swim or kayak to the island's shores. Snorkeling is extremely popular, as are kayaking and paddlebarding to the island (the only way to avoid the hefty water taxi charge). The island is home to a historic Coast Guard station and the bunker where President John F. Kennedy hid out during the Cuban Missile Crisis; unfortunately, the bunker ended public tours in 2017 and has fallen into disrepair. Anyone can paddle, kayak, or take their own boat to the island, but the rest of us need to book a water taxi from the marina. All tickets are good for round-trip, same-day passage. Camping is permitted in designated campgrounds by reservation only; if you want the water taxi to shuttle your gear, you'll need to arrange it in advance (they also rent tents and a limited selection of other necessities). The water taxi will not sail when there's a lightning or other small craft warning, but even on bad-weather days, the forecast may turn around within an hour or two. Water taxi ticket $12 per adult, $6 per child under 6. (updated Mar 2021)
26.770113-80.1060693 Rapids Water Park, 6566 North Military Trail, ☏ +1 561-848-6272. Open March-Memorial Day and Labor-Day to Thanksgiving during weekends and school breaks; daily Memorial Day-Labor Day. Hours vary, generally 10AM-5PM. One of the largest water parks in the state, long-standing Rapids caters to families with slides of all sizes, a wave pool, lazy river, and kids' splash pads. Two snack bars serve kid-friendly food like pizza and chicken tenders, while tiki bars have a full-service menu and adult beverages. Cabanas are available for rent. A small store offers goods like sunscreen, towels, and waterproof cases. Weekdays: $47, Weekends: $55, Season Pass: $130. (updated Mar 2021)

26.7743-80.0521 Rafiki Tiki Bar & Grill, 190 E 13th St (within the Marina Village on the east side of the Event Center), ☏ +1 561-812-2240. 11AM-10PM daily. Located within Marina Village (see #Do above), this outdoor patio restaurant bills itself its cuisine as "Floribbean" - think lots of seafood alongside burgers, wings, sandwiches, and some Mediterranean and Latin specialties. Also offers tropical beverages and sometimes music. Main courses 15-20 USD. (updated Mar 2021)
