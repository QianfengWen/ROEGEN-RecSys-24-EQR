By car[edit]
The major roads around Spruce Grove mostly reflects the Dominion survey, with roads placed in regular intervals. Most major roads aside from Highway 16A or the Yellowhead Highway are four-lane roads, either divided or not. The downtown (City Centre) follows a rough grid, with streets slightly curved in line with Highway 16A and the Canadian National (CN) line through town. Roads in the majority of neighbourhoods are full of curves and dead ends, characteristic of suburban cities.
