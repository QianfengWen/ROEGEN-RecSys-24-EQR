Chester-le-Street is a town in County Durham, with a population of 23,500 in 2021. It's a commuter town for Newcastle 8 miles north; the main reason to visit is Durham CCC cricket ground, which stages county and international matches. 


Understand[edit]
"Chester" indicates the Roman fort of Concangis, and "le-Street" was what they marched along sinister-dexter. But when the Romans left Britain in 410 AD the settlement lay deserted for almost 500 years until monks fleeing Lindisfarne arrived. They brought with them a long-dead saint, a real live bishop (making this tiny place a cathedral city) and a Latin gospel which they translated into Old English. 
The monks moved on in 995 but the village was still astride the main road north, so it became a stop-over for those on foot or horseback. It was also next to the navigable River Wear, so goods could be shipped in and out. From the 17th century it grew into a town with the Durham mining industry, and in 1868 the railway arrived, vaulting over the valley to put Newcastle within 15 minutes. That turned Chester-le-Street into commuterland for the city, and so it remains.

No churns, no porter, no cat on a seat, at Chorlton-cum-Hardy or Chester-le-Street . . . 
- "Slow Train" by Flanders and Swann (1963) mourns railway stations axed by Beeching, but this one survived.
Chester-le-Street 54.8546-1.57811 railway station is on the London-Newcastle-Edinburgh main line, but most trains thunder through. An hourly Transpennine train calls on its way from Liverpool Lime Street via Manchester Victoria, Leeds, York, Darlington and  Durham, heading for  Newcastle. From Scotland or Northumberland change at Newcastle. From London Kings Cross or Birmingham you usually change at York, but Newcastle-Chester takes only 10 minutes so it's sometimes quicker to double back. The railway station is central in town but the private contractor who ran it has gone bust, so in 2024 there are only makeshift arrangements for tickets, and other facilities such as toilets are closed. There is step-free access to both platforms. 
Long-distance buses don't call here, travel via Newcastle. Go North East Bus X21 runs from Newcastle Eldon Square every 30 min via Gateshead, taking 30 min to Chester-le-Street.

Get around[edit]
From hence we kept the common road to Chester in the Street, an old, dirty, thorowfare town, empty of all remains of the greatness which antiquaries say it once had, when it was a Roman colony.
- Daniel Defoe, author of "Robinson Crusoe", toured northern England and published his account in the 1720s.
Most attractions are within walking distance, but you could take Bus 71 or 78 for the golf course and Lumley Castle. Take Bus 21 not X21 for Angel of the North.

Town centre lies along Front Street, the historic line of the Great North Road, and is mostly non-descript low-rise. Queen's Head is an 18th century coaching inn, but closed and boarded up.
54.855944-1.5719721 St Mary and St Cuthbert Church, Church Chare DH3 3QW, ☏ +44 191 388 3295. M-W, F 10AM-1PM. Parts of the church go back to 1056 AD, when it replaced a wooden shrine to St Cuthbert, whose body lay here for 112 years. The first English translation of the gospels was written here around 950 AD, as a gloss between the Vulgate Latin lines of the Lindisfarne Gospels of 715. (Old English, so few modern readers will understand it.) All these relics and treasures moved in the 990s to Ripon then Durham to be further from Viking raids. The church was extended in the 13th century and acquired a hermitage. After the Reformation it became an Anglican parish church, and remains active.   (updated Jun 2024)
Cade's Road fronting St Mary and St Cuthbert was the Roman road, now called Church Chare. 100 yards north was the fort of Concangis, then the road bridged Chester Burn and headed on to Pons Aelius, now Newcastle. At some point the Great North Road became re-aligned 100 yards west, perhaps because the crossing over the Burn was changed.
Methodist Church is a striking building of 1902, on North Burns the street towards the viaduct. It was built by the "Primitive" faction, who sought to restore the revivalist spirit of John Wesley, which naturally got them expelled from the mainstream Methodist church.
