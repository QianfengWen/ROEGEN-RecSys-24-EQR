By car[edit]
If driving to town in the summer months, it is best to arrive very early, before 10:00 (or even 09:00 in August) to ensure parking near the town center. On cloudy or rainy days in August traffic jams may stretch 2 hours long getting into or through town.

Get around[edit]
Streets of the old town
The center of Porto-Vecchio is best navigated on foot, as the town has a one-way traffic system that makes it virtually impossible to navigate by a car.

See[edit]

Do[edit]
Scuba-diving is excellent in the Iles Cerbicales, about 20 min boat ride round the headland. These rocky islets are part of a marine reserve that span the straits to Sardinia, so there are plenty of grouper, barracuda, morays, and smaller stuff down to neon tetras. Dive operators include Plongee Nature, based at 9 Av de Georges Pompidou facing the marina. About €50 for a one-tank dive. If later you're driving inland, many island roads crest at over 1000 m altitude, so allow a suitable interval after surfacing.

Buy[edit]
Porto-Vecchio has several souvenir shops, as well as some stores selling specialty Corsican food, such as wild boar sausage and local cheeses. There are several hyper-markets (bigger than super markets) just north of town along the main road.

Eat[edit]
The town has dozens of excellent restaurants, some with beautiful views over the harbour, and a main square where you can sip your latte while people watching.
