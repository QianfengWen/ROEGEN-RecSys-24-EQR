Durrës is an Albanian Adriatic port city. It has ferries to Bari and Ancona in (Italy) and bus connections to other Albanian and international destinations, often via Tirana. Alternative spellings of the city's name are Durazzo (Italian),  Drač (Драч, Serbo-Croatian) or Dyrrhachion (Δυρράχιον, Greek).


Understand[edit]
Durres is a bustling, lively port city. There is a busy city centre, historical sites, beaches and promenades. The city has a vibrant feel with friendly and helpful locals. In parts the city is attractive and well maintained. In others it is somewhat ramshackle  with both active and what appears to be abandoned development co-existing next to each other. There are abundant shops, retail stalls and street traders. They appear to trade from early morning until late and provide an attractive "always on" vibe to the city.
