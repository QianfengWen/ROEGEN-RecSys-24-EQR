Main Street in Cattaraugus
By car[edit]
The main drag in Cattaraugus is State Route 353, called Main Street within downtown and Cattaraugus-Little Valley Road further south. To get to Cattaraugus from Buffalo and other points north, get off the New York State Thruway (I-90) at Exit 55 (US 219), and proceed south on the 219 for 30 miles (48.5 km). Turn right at East Otto Road and, from there, keep following the signs for County Route 12. You'll come to the center of Cattaraugus in 14½ miles (23.5 km). From points south, get off the Southern Tier Expressway (I-86) at Exit 20 in Salamanca and then turn right, following the signs for Route 353 north. Downtown Cattaraugus is a little more than 15 miles (about 24.5 km) ahead.

By plane[edit]
The nearest airport with scheduled flights is Bradford Regional Airport (BFD IATA) in Bradford, Pennsylvania, which is served with daily commuter flights from Pittsburgh via Southern Airways Express: four on weekdays, two on Saturdays, and three on Sundays. In practice, however, arriving in Cattaraugus by plane usually means flying into Buffalo Niagara International Airport.

Season runs May 1-Dec 24; call ahead for studio hours. Situated since 1982 in an old hog farm surrounded by picturesque hills, Michael and Elliott Hutten's pottery studio is a place to pick up a wide range of beautiful and functional handmade stoneware pieces — everything from casserole dishes to coffee mugs to birdhouses to Christmas tree ornaments. And, if you time it out right, you might even find some of the dazzlingly colorful, Japanese-style raku pottery in Hog-Shed's studio showroom — made in a labor-intensive process only a few times per season.

Open six days a week, Pascarella's serves up hearty all-American comfort food with a few Italian specialties mixed in too, and the fresh house-baked bread and range of soups are real winners. This cozy place in the heart of Cattaraugus' village center is "small enough that most customers are repeat customers and service is more personal" (to borrow the words of an online review), but if you're a visitor, husband-and-wife owners Ray and Pam will go out of their way to make you feel at home. Breakfast and lunch only, except Friday, when fish fry packs the house at dinnertime. (updated Jan 2018)
