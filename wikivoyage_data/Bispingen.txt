Dat ole Hus, the oldest open-air museum in Germany is within the municipality of Bispingen
Bispingen is a small country town in Lower Saxony and a great base for exploring the Lüneburg Heath. Within its municipal boundaries lies the highest hill on the Heath, the Wilseder Berg (169 m), as well as the iconic heath village and tourist hotspot of Wilsede.


Understand[edit]
The Heath is a very popular German tourist destination and recreation area for the big cities of Hamburg, Bremen and Hanover, and Bispingen lies right at the heart of it on the sleepy little
River Luhe and a good 15 km northeast of the next largest town, Soltau. Bispingen has been developed to cater for the expanding tourist market and features Snow dome, Ralf Schumacher's Go-Kart hall and a Centre Parcs village on the outskirts. But it also lies within the Lüneburg Heath Nature Park with its quaint farming villages, forests and rolling heathlands grazed by moorland sheep (Heidschnucken), all linked by a network of signposted trails and cycleways.

Bispingen is little more than a one-hour drive from the international airports of Hamburg [1], Bremen [2][dead link] and Hanover [3]
Bispingen is accessible from the airport at Hanover which is a main international airport with regular flights from all over the world with services to most European capitals and major cities. The airport is 11 km north of Hanover centre and has easy access to the autobahn.

The airport is close to the city centre, and there is a tram which departs every 5 to 10 minutes (on Sunday evenings up to 30 min) to Bremen city centre. The journey takes 11 minutes and costs €2.30. This airport is also close to the autobahn links but is a 116-km journey to Bispingen.
Hamburg International Airport is approximately 8 km and is the fifth busiest airport in Germany. The Hamburg S-Bahn system Line 1 connects the  airport with the main Bahnhof in Hamburg city centre in about 25 min (€3, Dec 2019).

Parks[edit]
 Wilsede (park at Undeloh or Niederhaverbeck and follow the signed trails or take a horse-drawn cart). One of the highlights of the Lüneburg Heath, Wilsede's popularity stems from its charm as one of the few relatively unspoilt heath villages as well as its proximity to the Wilseder Berg, the heath's highest hill. As a result this tiny village of under 40 souls, receives over 100,000 visitors each summer. Since motor vehicles are banned unless you live here, most of them arrive on foot, by bicycle or on one of the many horse-drawn carts that ply the area from the nearest public car parks at Niederhaverbeck and Undeloh. The village is home to a heath museum (Dat ole Hus - see below) as well as a cafe, restaurant and shop selling typical heathland products. 
 Wilseder Berg (park at Undeloh or Niederhaverbeck and follow the signed trails or take a horse-drawn cart). The Wilseder Berg is the Lüneburg Heath's highest point.

At the top is a brass plaque on a pedestal which indicates the direction of various cities, towns and other points of interest. The hill is only accessible on foot or by horse and cart.
