Get in[edit]
68°23′0″N 23°38′0″EMap of Hetta
68.36444423.42751 Enontekiö airport (6 km west of Hetta). Numerous charter flights land throughout the winter. There are no regular scheduled air services.   (updated Apr 2023)
Kittilä airport has flights around the year and is 150 km away. See Enontekiö for other options.
Hetta is 25 km off E8, so mostly you have to turn or transfer at Palojoensuu, west of Hetta (there are daily coaches, but check waiting time). E45 from Sweden follows E8 from Karesuando to Palojoensuu, forks off to Hetta and continues to the north along road 93 to Kautokeino via the border crossing Kivilompolo, passes a junction for Karasjok and reaches E6 and Alta. A road from Kittilä comes to Hetta from the east.
The Eurovelo cycling route nr 7 from Nordkapp to Malta ("Sun Route", 7,409 km) comes down trough Finnmarksvidda, passes Hetta and continues down through Sweden. The coaches usually take bikes, so you can choose what legs to go on your own.

Get around[edit]
The village is spread out along the roads, so just roaming about is not a time efficient way to find places. Not too long distances, though.
