Bhaktapur (भक्तपुर) is a city in Nepal known variously as City of Culture, Living Heritage, Nepal's Cultural Gem, An open museum and a City of Devotees.  Bhaktapur is an ancient city and is renowned for its elegant art, fabulous culture, colourful festivals, traditional dances and the indigenous lifestyle of the Newari community. It is just 12 km east of Kathmandu, the modern capital of Nepal, but you may feel a bit like you've gone back to the Middle Ages, given the ambiance of traditional homes, lifestyles and environment here. The conch-shaped historic city is spread over an area of 6.9 m2 at an altitude of 1,401 m. Bhaktapur was founded in the 12th century by King Anand Dev Malla and was the capital city of the Greater Malla Kingdom in the Kathmandu Valley till the 15th century AD. Many of Bhaktapur's greatest monuments were built during the Malla period.


Understand[edit]
Bhaktapur has more temples per square metre than Patan or Kathmandu and is far enough out of the city to keep the crowds away. As a World Heritage site listed by the UNESCO, Bhaktapur has been heavily restored following an earthquake in 1934 which severely damaged the city, but you will still see signs of damage from the 2015 quakes.

Get in[edit]

If you are not arriving as part of a tour group, you may take mini bus (bound for Kamal Binayak stop in Bhaktapur) or big bus (bound for Chyamasingha stop in Bhaktapur) from the bus stop near Bhadrakali. You can save time by taking Express Bus (this does not stop in between except in Maitighar and Sallaghari) from Bagbazar in Kathmandu. Micro buses shuttle between Kathmandu and Bhaktapur, which provide a fairly quick way to get to Bhaktapur.
For those who haven't experienced a public bus in South Asia, it will be a way to (literally) rub shoulders with locals. In either case it takes about 40–60 minutes, and drops you off just outside of the city. The fare from Kathmandu to Bhaktapur was approximately Rs 35 in Sep 2009 by bus for local people. The average cost for a one way taxi from Thamel to Bhaktapur is Rs 1000 for the 16 km drive. You can easily hail a taxi or pick up a return bus to either Patan or Kathmandu just outside of the first main gate that leads into the city.

Get around[edit]
Once in Bhaktapur, walking is the best way to experience the quiet, dusty lanes squares. Rickshaws, tuk-tuks or taxis are not allowed inside the city: an inconvenience more than made up for by the quiet and clean air. However, locals are permitted to use motorbikes, and consequently some caution is needed when walking around the narrow streets.

See[edit]
The primary reason for visiting Bhaktapur is because its Durbar Square is one of the seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the Khatmandu Valley. There are other worthwhile things to see as well.

The Big Bell in the square was erected by Ranajit Malla (1722–1769), last Malla king of Bhaktapur and was used for paying homage to Goddess Taleju and for assemblies of the general public. The entrance fee for foreigners is Rs 1500, which is used to partly fund repairs following the 2015 earthquake. If you plan to visit for several days, you can ask the counter to add a note to permit access to the city with the same ticket (at most one week). Visitors from SAARC member countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) and China pay NPR100.
