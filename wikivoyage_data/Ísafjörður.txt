Ísafjörður is the biggest town of the Westfjords of Iceland.


Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
There are two ways to drive into Ísafjörður. The first is from the ringroad in Hrutafjörður, and goes up north on the eastern part of the peninsula through road number 61. That way gives you the opportunity to stop in Holmavik among other places on the way.
The second way to get to Ísafjörður by car is by road 60 from the ringroad, 608 over the moor of Thorskafjardarheidi and then 61 through the many fjords on the way. In the summer, that is the shortest way from Reykjavik, but it is not accessible during wintertime.

By water[edit]
You can take the ferry Baldur from Stykkisholmur via the small towns on the western part of the peninsula. That way gives you a chance to see for example the great waterfall Dynjandi.
Some cruise ships dock at Ísafjörður's 66.066501-23.1217481 cruise ship dock.

By bus[edit]
There are regular buses from Akureyri and Reykjavik to Ísafjörður from 1 June to 31 August. The 66.073215-23.1310832 Ísafjörður bus stop is located behind Hótel Ísafjörður. Bus information may be found on West Tours' web site.

By plane[edit]
There are two daily flights with Icelandair from Reykjavik's domestic airport to 66.055269-23.145043 Ísafjörður Airport. The fare is a relatively inexpensive flight, and you are treated to a grand view of the fjords on the descent into the Ísafjörður Airport. The airport is about 5 km (3 mi) from the town, on the other side of the fjord. It's possible to walk from the airport to the town in a little over an hour if you don't mind walking on the gravelled shoulder of a lightly-travelled road.

Get around[edit]

The town is very small and eminently walkable. The distances from the town to adjacent towns is generally further than walking distance. Thus, you would want to study the bus system that can take you all over, bring a bike or have a car. There is a bike rental in town for the active ones that don't want to walk around.
The lone exception is Hnifsdalur, a tiny village of 250 people near hiking trails. Hnifsdalur is approximately 5 km north from Ísafjörður, and is an easy walk on a paved walking trail running adjacent to Road 61.
