Rocky Mountain House is a town of 6,600 people in the Foothills region of Alberta, Canada.


Understand[edit]
Rocky Mountain House is approximately 77 km (48 mi) west of Red Deer at the confluence of the Clearwater and North Saskatchewan Rivers, and at the crossroads of Highway 22 (Cowboy Trail) and Highway 11 (David Thompson Highway). The surrounding Clearwater County's administration office is in Rocky Mountain House. Rocky Mountain House is the gateway to David Thompson Country, a wilderness recreational area that is west of the town in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains.

History[edit]
Rocky Mountain House National Historic Site
The town's history dates back to the 18th century with the presence of British and Canadian fur traders during the westward Canadian expansion. In 1799, the Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company established the Rocky Mountain House, the westernmost post on the North Saskatchewan. It was within sight of the Rocky Mountains, and Acton House fur trading posts. Trade with the local Aboriginal peoples continued until 1821 when the companies merged. They continued to trade until 1875 and closed the Rocky Mountain House post. The name of the settlement however remained. The Rocky Mountain House settlement also served as a launching point for many explorers such as David Thompson, in search for a passage west to the Pacific Ocean. Many travellers used this location as a stop on their way further west or northwest.

Get in[edit]
Rocky Mountain House can be accessed from Edmonton or Calgary by taking the Queen Elizabeth II Highway (Highway 2) to Red Deer, then going west on Highway 11. Rocky Mountain House is also accessible from the west via Icefields Parkway (Highway 93). It also has an airport for general aviation.
