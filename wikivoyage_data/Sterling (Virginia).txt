Sterling, then Sterling Park or just "The Park", was founded in 1961 by the M.T. Broyhill & Sons Corporation, who bought nearly 2,000 acres (810 hectares) of farmland. The homes were intended to be much cheaper than homes in Fairfax County, along with amenities and commuter trains carrying workers the half-hour to Washington.
