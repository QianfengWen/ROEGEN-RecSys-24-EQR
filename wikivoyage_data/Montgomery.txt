For other places with the same name, see Montgomery (disambiguation).

Montgomery is the capital of Alabama, in the River Heritage region of the state. Montgomery has also been recognized nationally for its downtown revitalization and new urbanism projects. 


Understand[edit]
Montgomery briefly held the title of capital of the Confederacy and was also the site of Jefferson Davis' inauguration.  Montgomery was also a pivotal location during the civil rights movement, seeing the arrest of Rosa Parks and the ensuing bus boycott, as well as numerous non violent protests led by Dr. Martin Luther King.
Montgomery's central location in Alabama's Black Belt has long made it a processing hub for commodity crops such as cotton, peanuts, and soybeans. Due to its location along the Alabama River and extensive rail connections, Montgomery has been and continues to be a regional distribution hub for a wide range of industries. Since the late 20th century, it has diversified its economy, achieving increased employment in sectors such as healthcare, business, government, and manufacturing.
In 2019, it was home to just under 200,000 people.

Climate[edit]
Montgomery has short, mild winters, warm springs and autumns, and long, hot, humid summers. The daily average temperature in January is 47 °F (8 °C), and there are 3-4 days of sub 20 °F (−7 °C) lows; 10 °F (−12 °C) and below is extremely rare. The daily average in July is 82°F (28 °C), with highs exceeding 90 °F (32 °C) on 86 days per year and 100 °F (38°C) on 4. Summer afternoon heat indices, much more often than the actual air temperature, are frequently at or above 100 °F. 
Rainfall is well-distributed throughout the year, though February, March and July are the wettest months, while October is significantly the driest month. Thunderstorms bring much of Montgomery's rainfall. These are common during the summer months but occur throughout the year. Severe thunderstorms – producing large hail and damaging winds in addition to the usual hazards of lightning and heavy rain – can occasionally occur, particularly during the spring. Severe storms also bring a risk of tornadoes. Sometimes, tropical disturbances – some of which strike the Gulf Coast as hurricanes before losing intensity as they move inland – can bring very heavy rains.

Eat[edit]
Montgomery's diners tend to be very basic eaters. Lunch times are often served as a "meat and three plate". That is where a restaurant, during the lunch hour, serves a meat course and three sides (vegetables or potatoes). It tends to be very filling (perhaps too filling) but reliable quantity and quality wise.
There seems to be a preference for corporate generic restaurants (Outback, Olive Garden, Red Lobster). If they have a franchise, Montgomery probably has one.
You need to understand a few southern cuisines when dining in Montgomery and these are applicable throughout the Alabama and Mississippi area.
Most restaurants serve "sweet" tea—sweetened with sugar, and may be too sweet for some. when ordering iced tea, "unsweetened" is also an option.
Bar-B-Que means that meat is slow cooked over a wood fire. Sauce is served seen the full range of sauces (mustard type, tomato based, Tex-Mex).
Montgomery is home for the Hyundai automobile plant. Look for several fine Korean and Pan Asian restaurants and interesting menu items.
Montgomery is in lower Alabama and you can expect, in some of the better restaurants, some Cajun influence.

Stay safe[edit]
For emergencies dial 911 for medical and police assistance. Avoid the West and Southwestern parts of the city, as these tend to be where most of the crime is concentrated. Carjacking is not uncommon, so keep your doors locked when not around your vehicle. The Eastern portion of the city, specifically from the Eastern Blvd onward, offers many safe and family friendly shopping attractions and venues.

Cope[edit]
During the months of April through October, Montgomery experiences periods of high heat and humidity. Plan your "outside" days accordingly. Be sure to acclimatize to the heat (this should take a few days), take advantage of early mornings and evenings, drink plenty of water.
