Roof of Naiku's Grand Shrine
Ise (伊勢市 Ise-shi) is a city in Mie prefecture, Japan.  Ise is primarily known for the eponymous Ise Shrine, arguably the holiest and most important Shinto site and the reputed home of the Emperor's Sacred Mirror.


Understand[edit]
According to the official chronology, Ise Shrine (伊勢神宮 Ise-jingū) was constructed in the year 4 BC. Most historians date the shrines from several hundred years later, with 690 AD widely considered the date when the shrines were first built in their current form. They are mentioned in the annals of the Kojiki and Nihonshoki, dating from 712. Sacred objects of the royal family reside within, including a covered mirror which has reportedly not been looked into for over a thousand years. The shrines are famously dismantled and rebuilt to exacting specifications every 20 years at exorbitant expense.
The present buildings, dating from 2013, are the 62nd iteration to date and are scheduled for rebuilding in 2033. Many festivals will precede the next rebuilding; the most impressive of these, the "tree-pulling" festival Okihiki (御木曳) in which lumber is ceremoniously carted to the shrine, is next anticipated in 2026-2027.

Tourist information site[edit]
The local tourist association has a multilingual guide site.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The closest international airport to Ise is Chubu Centrair International Airport (NGO IATA) south of Nagoya. High-speed ferries run hourly from the airport's dock across Ise Bay to Tsu (津) in 45 minutes (¥2470). From the port, a local bus travels to Tsu train station (¥200) from which Ise can be reached in 35 minutes by Kintetsu Railway (¥620; transfer may be necessary). A small number of ferries continue to Matsusaka, which is slightly closer to Ise.
The alternative is to simply take the Meitetsu μ-SKY train from the airport to Nagoya, and continue to Ise using one of the options below.

By train[edit]
Kintetsu Railway's Shimakaze train
Ise's main train station is Iseshi (伊勢市), which is served by Japan Railways and the private Kintetsu Railway. Another useful station is Uji-Yamada (宇治山田), which is served by Kintetsu and is the next station after Iseshi.
Kintetsu offers access to Ise through their direct limited express services from Nagoya (85 minutes, ¥2770), Kyoto (2 hours, ¥3620) and Namba in Osaka (1 hour 50 minutes, ¥3120). Some trains have a premium Deluxe Car which requires an additional surcharge for seating. One service, the Shimakaze (しまかぜ), operates with all-premium seating, also requiring an additional surcharge.
Tourists who wish to use Kintetsu can purchase the Kintetsu Rail Pass which includes unlimited local trips on the network for 5 days. The pass costs ¥3800 (¥3600 if you buy it outside Japan before your trip). You must purchase a separate ticket to ride on the limited express, though Kintetsu has now made these purchases possible in English on their website. The one-way surcharges to Ise are ¥1320 from Nagoya or Osaka, and ¥1610 from Kyoto. Deluxe Car seats and Shimakaze seats require an extra surcharge. An enhanced version of the pass, called the Kintetsu Rail Pass Plus, costs ¥5000 (¥4800 purchased in advance) and adds unlimited trips on select buses in the area.
JR trains run hourly rapid services to Iseshi from Nagoya (90 minutes, ¥2000 unreserved seat, ¥2520 reserved seat). The fastest option by JR from the Shinkansen is to change to the rapid train in Nagoya, as a trip around the Kii peninsula on other JR services will take much longer.
Holders of the Japan Rail Pass must pay a small ¥510 surcharge, since trains partially use the private Ise Railway on the journey. The surcharge can be avoided by taking the less-frequent Nanki (南紀) limited express from Nagoya to Taki (多気) and changing to a local train to Iseshi, though this will extend the travel time to 2 hours.

By bus[edit]
Willer Express operates overnight bus service from Tokyo to Ise. Buses leave from the Shinjuku Highway Bus Terminal (Basta Shinjuku), as well as from nearby Kawasaki. Weekday, non-peak fares start at around ¥4700, and the trip is valid with Willer's Japan Bus Pass.
Seibu and Mie Kotsu operate two overnight bus services to Ise - one departs from Ikebukuro and Shinjuku, and the other leaves from Ikebukuro and Yokohama. Weekday, non-peak fares start at around ¥7200.

Get around[edit]
A regular bus service operates between Ise Station and Naiku. Another option for those who want to explore the area further is the CAN Bus day pass. This provides unlimited travel around the Ise, the Futami area, and Toba. A 1-day pass is ¥1000 for adults, ¥500 for children. A 2-day pass is ¥1600 and ¥800. Mie Kotsu multilingual website has more bus information.

The rocks are said to represent Izanagi and Izanami, the creator gods of Shinto myth, and the larger "male" rock has a small torii gate on top. While photos often make the rocks appear much larger than they really are, it is still a unique and interesting site. Entrance is free.

Buy[edit]
 Oharai Machi (おはらい町) (between Jingukaikan Mae  (神宮会館前)  Bus Stop and Naiku). Shop and enjoy the atmosphere. This stretch of shops and restaurants retains a real historical feel. The restaurants on the left offer a nice view over Isuzu River. Halfway up the road on the right is Okage Yokochou (おかげ横丁), a relatively new addition, with more eateries and a variety of souvenir shops. The best time to visit is in the weekend. Often you can enjoy a free performance such as a taiko (Japanese drums). Avoid this area in the weeks after New Year. The massive crowds of people visiting Naiku make it hard to enjoy. If you go in the height of summer take your swimwear and you can enjoy a dip in Isuzu river. Swimming above the stonework near the bridge is strictly prohibited but swimming in the deeper spot adjacent to the car park is fine. Not many people swim there, mostly local school kids, but the water is clean and clear, take your goggles for a good view of the massive carp. (updated Dec 2015)
Eat[edit]
Ise udon
The local specialty is Japanese spiny lobster, known as Ise-ebi (伊勢海老, lit. "Ise shrimp") in Japanese.  Fresh lobster sashimi in particular is sublime, but as you might expect such pleasures don't come cheap.  Other local specialities include Ise udon, a very simple dish of thick noodles in a strong flavored sauce, garnished with spring onion. It can be ordered from the restaurants around Naiku for ¥300-400. The noodles are made intentionally soft for tired pilgrims and very different from chewy ones typical in Shikoku.
Those with a sweet tooth will enjoy akafuku (赤福) , a mochi rice cake wrapped in red bean jam. With complimentary green tea, akafuku costs ¥280 (for three) at stalls around Naiku. You can also buy it boxed at Iseshi Station and Ujiyamada Station.
