Port Chalmers is a deep water fishing and cargo port for Dunedin, one of the main ports for the  South Island of New Zealand, in the Otago region. It is visited by several cruise ships each summer. In 2021, it was home to 1,500 people.


Understand[edit]
Port Chalmers, called "Port" for short by locals, is about 20 minutes by road from Dunedin and shares the same long, narrow, Otago Harbour. Only smaller ships can proceed past Port Chalmers to the wharves in the city centre.
The main streets of Port Chalmers and Dunedin are both called George St. The Port Chalmers one is numbered in the 5000s to avoid confusion, and all shops, cafes and services can be found along or near this street.

Port Chalmers Iona Church
History[edit]
The original Māori name for Port Chalmers was “Potakere” or “Pou-takere” which may have indicated the hill where the tuahu, or altar, was sited. 'Kōpūtai' is a later name meaning ‘full tide’ and refers to an incident in which the tide rose and beached canoes were set adrift.
At first the European settlers intended to christen the town ‘New Leith’ or ‘New Musselburgh’, as they disliked retaining the Māori name of Kōpūtai; but eventually it was named after Dr. Thomas Chalmers, the leader of the Free Church movement in Scotland.
The first organized European settlers arrived in Otago Harbour on the John Wickliffe, which moored off what was now Port Chalmers on 23 March 1848.
The arrival of organized European settlement led to the town superseding the earlier Ōtākou as the harbour's international port. By January 1854 the population had reached 80.
As Otago harbour was too shallow for large ships to reach Dunedin they were forced to dock at Port Chalmers, and goods were transported to and from Dunedin by road. A small community of workers sprang up on the hill overlooking the docks, and by the time the Otago Gold Rush hit in the early 1860s, Port Chalmers was the third largest port in Australasia.
The dredging of the Victoria Ship Channel along the north-western side of the harbor lead to a large number of ships bypassing Port Chalmers in favour of Dunedin. Compensating to some degree ship servicing and building industries developed in Port Chalmers while the adjacent Carey's Bay became a fishing port.
In 1882 New Zealand's refrigerated meat trade began when the ship Dunedin left Port Chalmers with the first such cargo.
The selection of Port Chalmers as the South Island's first container terminal in 1971 re-established Port Chalmers as the South Island’s major commercial port.
From the 1970s an artists' colony grew up in Port Chalmers and Carey's Bay.
In 1989 the borough of Port Chalmers and the whole surrounding district were absorbed into an enlarged City of Dunedin.
From the 1990s onwards cruise ships began calling, a trend that continues to expand with 153,000 disembarking of the 229,000 passengers bought on 115 vessels during 2019. As modern cruise ships are so big that they must be nursed by tugs along the dredged channel up the harbor to Dunedin or often draw in excess of the depth of the channel Port Chalmers is their preferred port of call.

Orientation[edit]
Much of Port Chalmers is located on a small hilly peninsula, at the northern end of which is a large reclaimed area which is now the site of the container port. Close to the southeastern shore of this peninsula are Quarantine Island/Kamau Taurua and Goat Island/ Rakiri which lie across the harbour between Port Chalmers and the Otago Peninsula.

When to visit[edit]
When a cruise ship is in port, the attractions will be crowded. Also to save money many passengers use the public bus to access Dunedin, so the buses will also be crowded.
For the cruise ship schedule consult portotago.co.nz.

Tourism information office[edit]
 i-SITE Dunedin Visitor Centre, based at 26 Princess St in Dunedin, ☏ +64 3 474-3300. It maintains a temporary office in the wharf when cruise ships are in port. 

Get in[edit]
Port Chalmers is most easily reached from Dunedin, unless you arrive by sea.

By air[edit]
The closest airport is Dunedin Airport.

By car[edit]
State Highway 88 connects Port Chalmers to Dunedin; the turnoff is near the Dunedin Railway Station. Allow 20 minutes to follow a narrow, very busy trucking route past the huge indoor Forsyth Barr Stadium, through the factory suburb of Ravensbourne and around curved causeways to the Port. There is also a narrow, winding but scenic and enjoyable route from Blueskin Bay.

By bicycle[edit]
Port Chalmers is connected to Dunedin by the Harbour Cycleway, but this stops about halfway, at St Leonards. From here cyclists can either share the highway with heavy trucks or take the former highway which winds along terraces higher up the shoreline.
You can also use the Port to Port ferry service to ride along Otago Peninsula from Dunedin, cross the harbour and return via Port Chalmers.

By bus[edit]
Orbus buses organized by the Otago Regional Council (Ph. 0800 672-8736,  orc.govt.nz) depart in Dunedin from the Central City Bus Hub (on Great King Street between Moray Place and St Andrew St). In Port Chalmers the bus service starts from the corner of Harrington and Fox Streets.
The journey takes 31 minutes. It operates on weekdays every 20 to 30 minutes between 6:10AM and 8:10PM with the final service at 9:10PM. On Fridays there are late services at 8:10PM and 11:10PM. On Saturdays the service operates every 60 minutes from 8:10AM to 23:10PM. On Sunday it operates every 60 minutes from 9:10AM to 6:10PM.
The bus fare in cash is $6 (adult) and $3.60 (child) and on the bus network electronic GoCard it is $4.44 (adults) and $2.66 (child). The bus is free for New Zealand Gold Card holders.
There is also the option of taking the bus to Port Chalmers and after exploring the town taking the ferry across to Portobello and from there take a bus back to Dunedin.

By cruise ship[edit]
Cruise ships are an increasingly popular way to visit Dunedin. There are now over 100 visits each year (mostly between October to March).  The Dunedin City Council provides free Wi-Fi at the port and runs a web page for cruise visitors [1][dead link]. The two major cruise companies Carnival (P&O, Princess) and Royal Caribbean both serve Dunedin.
Seasoned cruise ship travellers will be aware that tourism products marketed directly to cruise ship passengers are often more expensive, so arranging visits to Dunedin attractions and tours independently can save money.

Cruise ship transfers to and from Dunedin[edit]
Cruise ship shuttle bus: These travel direct (20 minutes) and drop off and pick up in the Octagon in the centre of Dunedin for $10 one-way/$15 return. They may depart from the ship gangway or up to five minutes walk away, depending on the day's arrangements.
Public bus: There is a public bus stop on George St about five minutes walk from ship side.
Taxis: Taxis depart ship-side and for the return to Port they are easily found on the side streets of most corners of George St, Dunedin's main shopping street.

Churches and historical sites[edit]
-45.81502170.621811 Chick’s Hotel, 2 Mount St. Not open to the general public.. Originally called the Jerusalem Hotel, it was built in 1876 After the original owner had financial problems it was purchased in 1879 by George Chick and from then on it was known as Chick's. In 1903 the Port Chalmers electorate went ‘dry’ and Chick's lost its licence. Hotels at the port banded together, taking their case as far as the Privy Council, in London, before winning back their licences in May, 1905. From 2008 until 2016 when it closed for good it was a popular music venue, which attracted national and international acts such as Steve Albini, Sharon van Etten and Kurt Vile. The building is now used as a recording studio. The basement was once used as an overflow jail, with meals being served with the assistance of the Chick family. Now bricked up, a smuggling tunnel lead out from the basement to the dock area. Legend has it that drunk pub patrons would be taken down and ‘shanghaied’ to wake up the next day halfway out to sea.

In 1898 Mother Mary MacKillop, and two Josephite Sisters, arrived into Dunedin on the request of the local parish priest to assist with teaching. Australia's first saint, Saint Mary MacKillop is also known as Saint Mary of the Cross. When they arrived they found the existing school then called St Mary’s School, to be in an old shed-like house and in a sad state of disrepair. A new school, St Joseph’s Primary School, was subsequently opened at the end of January 1898. MacKillop lived in Port Chalmers for two months and was the first Head of St Joseph’s in Port Chalmers.
