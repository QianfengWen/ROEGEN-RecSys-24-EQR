Havelock is a town in the Marlborough district of New Zealand known as the green-shell mussel capital of the world.  It is the major access point to the Pelorus Sound, one of the two major sounds of the Marlborough Sounds.  There must be something in the water as two of the world's greatest scientists had their formative education in Havelock: Sir Ernest Rutherford, the first man to split the atom and the rocket scientist William Pickering.


Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Havelock is on State Highway 6 between Blenheim (30 minutes) and Nelson (45 minutes).  There are two choices of traveling to Picton.  The turnoff to the scenic Queen Charlotte Drive on the eastern side of town.  Queen Charlotte Drive is narrow and windy, with commanding views over the Keneperu and inner Queen Charlotte Sounds.  Allow 1 hour to travel this route.  The alternative is via the Wairau valley.  From Picton, head initially down State Highway 1 in the direction of Blenheim. At the settlement of Spring Creek, turn west down Rapaura Rd and travel length of this road.  At the intersection turn north to travel to Havelock.  Allow 45 minutes for this journey.
