Bolton is a large town in Greater Manchester in the North-West of England, 17 miles north of Manchester city centre. It celebrates its industrial  heritage of canals, coal, cotton, and railways. The borough includes several small towns, notably Blackrod, Farnworth, Heaton, Horwich, Little Lever and Westhoughton.


Understand[edit]
Bolton Town Hall
This Spinning Mule is the only one in existence made by the inventor Samuel Crompton. It can be found in the collection of Bolton Museum and Archive Service.
Bolton grew rapidly as a textile and metal-bashing town during the 18th & 19th centuries. The Spinning Mule was invented here: it spun yarn into cotton thread faster and more efficiently than earlier processes, to feed the great hungry looms, and in its heyday there were 50 million Mules in Lancashire alone. A few were still in use for specialist fine yarns until the 1980s, but the Lancashire cotton trade collapsed in the 1950s, unable to compete with cheap imports. Bolton and similar towns slumped. 
In 1974 Manchester and its surrounding towns, including Bolton, were separated from Lancashire and became Greater Manchester. Bolton is nowadays mainly a commuter town for the big city. With a population in 2011 of 194,189 Bolton may well be "the biggest town in Britain" but its bids to be recognised as a city itself continue to be rebuffed.
The town's traditional dialect is more "Lanky" (Lancashire) than Mancunian. You're unlikely nowadays to hear "thee / tha / thi" for "you / your" unless ironically, but you might hear "owt" (anything), "nowt" (nothing), "summat" (something) and "reeght" (right). Thus, a trivial matter is dismissed as "summat 'n nowt." Residents of Westhoughton are dubbed Keawyeds - cow heads; there's a bovine legend about this but it's probably from their victory banquet after Waterloo in 1815, when they roasted an ox and paraded the skull as "Old Boney".

Le Mans Crescent houses the museum and library
53.578-2.431 Bolton Town Hall, opened in 1873, is a confident statement of municipal pride, in neoclassical style with a baroque clock tower. Leeds and Portsmouth city halls were built to the same pattern. The elegant Le Mans Crescent behind was added in the 1930s.
 Museum, Art Gallery and Aquarium, Le Mans Crescent BL1 1SL (by Town Hall). M-Sa 9AM-5PM, Su 10AM-4PM. Visitors particularly enjoy the Ancient Egyptian collection. There's an aquarium in the basement. Free.   (updated Aug 2019)

Bolton Parish Church is Victorian. Samuel Crompton lies in the graveyard.
53.6-2.4192 Hall i' th' Wood, Crompton Way BL1 8UH (a mile north of Bolton off A58). Mar-Oct: Tu 10AM-4PM, Sa noon-4PM. 16th-century mansion, timber-framed with stone additions, used not as a single home but as multiple lets for 17th- and 18th-century cottage industry. One of those occupants was Samuel Compton, who designed his "Spinning Mule" here. This helped textile processes grow bigger and bigger, into "dark satanic mills", and the days of cottage industry were ended. The Hall fell into disrepair but was bought up by Lord Leverhulme the "Sunlight Soap" tycoon, who gifted it to the town.  (updated Aug 2019)
53.553-2.3773 Prestolee Aqueduct is a four-arched stone aqueduct built in 1793 to carry the Manchester, Bolton & Bury Canal over the River Irwell. The canal climbed from Manchester over Pendleton to Prestolee where it branched, to Bolton and to Bury. This section is still in water and you can walk along the towpath but it's not navigable: work is under way to partly restore it.

It was derelict by the 19th century but restored, with Dutch gables covering the stonework. With extensive gardens. It's nowadays within Blackburn, but is easiest accessed from Bolton, with Bromley Cross rwy station a mile or so south. Adult £6.   (updated Aug 2019)
53.599-2.5395 Holy Trinity Church (Anglican) is in Horwich. Consecrated in 1831, it's an example of a "Commissioners' church" (aka a "Waterloo" or "Million Act" church). These were an initiative following the end of the Napoleonic wars to revive the decrepit Church of England, to be a national thank-offering for victory, and by Christian moral teaching to prevent a Jacobin-style revolution in Britain.
