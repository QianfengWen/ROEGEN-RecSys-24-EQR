Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
Numazu is on the JR Tokaido Main Line between Atami and Shizuoka. It is also the terminus of the JR Gotemba Line.
Some direct local trains on the Tokaido Line depart from Tokyo Station early in the morning and late in the afternoon, otherwise you will have to change trains at Atami (2 hours, ‎¥2270). You cannot use an IC card if you travel from east of Atami, including Tokyo, as the station is operated by JR Tokai. If you accidentally use an IC card to enter the railway, get a fare ticket at a fare-adjustment machine at Atami.
The nearest bullet train station is in Mishima on the Tokaido Shinkansen, from which local trains run to Numazu in 5 minutes. From Tokyo, taking a Kodama service from Tokyo to Mishima and changing to a local train will bring the travel time down to 70 minutes (‎¥4000).
All of these trips are free with the Japan Rail Pass.

By bus[edit]
Fujikyu and Keio are among the major bus companies that operate to Numazu. Buses run from Tokyo Station, Shinjuku Expressway Bus Terminal (Busta Shinjuku) and Shibuya Station, running to Numazu in 2½-3 hours depending on stops (¥2160). These buses make a rest stop at the Ashigara  Service Area on the expressway along the way.
