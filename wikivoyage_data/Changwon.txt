The Masan-Changwon bridge
Changwon [dead link] (창원시) is the capital city of South Gyeongsang in South Korea, and incorporates the known harbor town of Masan. Changwon is the first of South Korea's few planned cities.


Understand[edit]
Developed in the 1970s, it was designed to be the new capital for Gyeongsangnam-do and an alternative capital for the country should Seoul be invaded.  The city is surrounded by mountains which provides protection.  A missile defense station sits on top of the southern mountain range.  Changwon boasts of the longest straight road in the nation (Changwon Main Road - Changwondae-no) which is over 12 km long.  If necessary the road can be used as a landing runway.
The city is home to many high-technology and machine industries, including LG, Samsung, GM Daewoo, and their employees in a high-quality urban space.  Changwon Main Road divides the town with the industries mostly being on the western side and the urban environment mostly being on the eastern side.
The neighboring cities Jinhae and Masan have since 2010 administratively been parts of Changwon.
Changwon is a planned city based on public works and a center of South Gyeongsangnam-do. Among non-capital areas, Changwon has the largest population including capital areas, Changwon followed by Suwon, Goyang and Yongin.
The climate of Changwon has a very similar climate to Busan nearby Changwon. Changwon is very hot in the summer and is also the place where tropical nights are observed very frequently in Korea. On the other hand, it is not very cold in winter and it snows rarely. There is not much snow in Changwon generally, so traffic is often paralyzed if it barely snows in Changwon.
