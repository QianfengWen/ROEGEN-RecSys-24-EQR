Kumasi is the main city of Ashanti-Kwahu region of Ghana. It is a vibrant city and the cultural cradle of Ghana. Kumasi is famous for its vast Kejetia market, the largest in West Africa, and for the traditional Asante buildings of the region, which are on the UNESCO World Heritage list.


Understand[edit]
Kumasi was established by the King Osei Tutu I with guidance from the priest Okomfo Anokye. The city is the home of the Ashanti King, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II (as of 2023), to whom Ashantis from all walks of life pay homage. The king presides over the traditional courts that some residents use instead of the official judicial system.
Prior to the British colonisation, Kumasi was the capital of the Ashanti Empire, one of the great civilisations of Africa. Once one of the most impressive pre-colonial cities in Africa, it was largely destroyed by the British in a series of wars at the end of the 19th century. Little remains today of its former glory. 
The city has a population of over 3.3 million. The local language is predominantly Akan Twi.

Get in[edit]
Map of Kumasi
Kumasi is a cosmopolitan city with a good road network and one can travel on local buses which ply predetermined routes or charter/hire taxis to take one to his preferred destination.

By plane[edit]
Flights from Accra to Kumasi are about 45 minutes long, limited on luggage allowance.  Excellent way to get to Kumasi, preferred by most.  Small planes, yet short trip. 

By train[edit]
In 2019, the government signed an agreement to restore railway service to Kumasi from Accra in 2022, and also plans to restore service from Takoradi.

By car[edit]
Car rental in Kumasi is available at the lowest cost of about US$75-100 per day.

By bus[edit]
To travel by road to Kumasi from Accra you will need to allow 6 hours travel time.  The STC bus service does not seem to be running anymore, or very sporadically; however private bus companies like VIP Jeoun (a Korean company) have taken over this route. Price is 25 cedis for a very comfortable and luxury bus (every row contains three seats; two on one side and one on the other), or 16 cedis for regular touring bus (4 seats in each row).

Get around[edit]
The tro-tro station in the city centre offers the widest range of destinations. The disadvantage of this tro-tro station is that it is extremely chaotic and that it is right in the city centre: getting out of the city is often problematic due to a plethora of traffic jams. If you can't find your tro-tro, ask one of the tro-tro mates or one of the ticket sellers. The destinations are posted on signs above the bus station.
Another alternative is to catch a tro-tro from the ring road instead. This saves you the hassle of navigating through the Kumasi traffic jams.

Adae Kese Festival[edit]
The Adae Kese Festival is a very important, albeit rare, celebration of the Ashanti's. It is held in a large open space in Kumasi. The festival is normally well attended and embraced by Ashanti's from all walks of life. The Adae Kese celebrations are magnified forms of Sunday Adae festivals, celebrated every six weeks in accordance with the Akan calendar which is based on a cycle of 42 days and nine months in a year. Invariably, the last Akwasidae festival is set aside for the celebration of Adae Kese.The public celebrations take the form of a colourful durbar of chiefs and queen mothers presided over by the Asantehene. It involves the display of cherished regalia and paraphernalia accompanied by traditional drumming and dancing as well as firing of musketry amidst pomp and pageantry.
The Adae festival is a continuous demonstration of faith in the vision and heritage of the Asante Kingdom, which has existed since the introduction of the Golden Stool in 1700. The festival is also to commemorate and re-enforce the independence of the Ashanti people and an occasion to re-affirm each state's loyalty to the confederacy instituted in the aftermath of the Ashanti war of independence fought against the Denkyeras between 1697–1699. It provides a platform for the King to meet and share his thoughts with his sub-chiefs and subjects and also reward deserving ones.
