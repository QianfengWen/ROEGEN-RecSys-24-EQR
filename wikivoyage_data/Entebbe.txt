Entebbe is a pleasant town built on the shores of Lake Victoria in Uganda.
Entebbe offers a relaxed stop-over alternative to Kampala if you're flying into or out of Uganda, as the air is clean, the streets are safe to walk, and the old colonial gardens and parks with the lake in the background make for a serene atmosphere. Despite its quaint exterior, you may encounter the President of Uganda or some beautiful wildlife at any turn. If you're not in a rush to the capital, it's worth a stay.


Understand[edit]
Aerial view of Entebbe and its airport
Entebbe hosts Uganda's international airport. The drive from Kampala is about an hour in light traffic, and more than two hours when it is heavy. The United Nations increasingly use a heavily guarded airport compound at Entebbe as a depot and staging area for their heavy equipment and vehicles that are used in peacekeeping missions in the region of Central Africa. They have their own immigration and customs procedures and a heavy lift capability using Antonovs.
Entebbe is perhaps most famous for an Israeli commando raid on 4 July 1976, when over one hundred mainly Jewish hostages held on a hijacked Air France plane were rescued. The rescue was complicated by the fact that Uganda's president at the time, Idi Amin, was supporting the hijackers. Over 40 Ugandan troops were killed by the Israelis during the rescue.
0.059932.46911 State House, is the official residence of the President of Uganda. It has a nice hilltop view of Lake Victoria, the second largest body of fresh water in the world after Lake Baikal. Like Addis Ababa, Entebbe grew up in a rather haphazard way (for example, there is a meteorological college on the corner of the long ceremonial entrance drive of the President) and the centre of things is moving closer to the airport but lots of banks, a supermarket and the  public hospital are all just a left turn away when leaving State House.

Climate[edit]
For a town pretty well slap bang on the equator, Entebbe is a few degrees cooler than you might expect because of its elevation. Instead of the day-time temperatures hovering around 32°C as residents of  Guayaquil, Cayenne, Singapore or Pontianak, Indonesia might expect, maximums are usually closer to 26°C or 27°C. However, humidity is consistently high.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Entebbe International Airport
"Struggle is the real meaning of life, Victory and Defeat are in the hands of God" - painted on a boat moored on the shore of Lake Victoria, Entebbe.
0.04472232.4430561 Entebbe International Airport (EBB  IATA), ☏ +256-312-352-000, aviation@caa.co.ug. This airport is Uganda's sole air gateway and, as such, is served by several African and international airlines.As of April 2017 there are flights from Addis Ababa, Juba and Kigali with Ethiopian airlines, from Cairo with Egyptair, from Dubai with Emirates, from Doha with Qatar Airways, from Istanbul with Turkish airlines, from Johannesburg with South African Airways, from Kigali, Juba and Nairobi with Rwandair , from Dar es Salaam with Precision Air, from Dubai with Flydubai, from Brussels with Brussels Airlines, from Amsterdam with KLM. Kenya Airways flies in four times a day from Nairobi. Fly-Sax airlines has flights from Nairobi. Jambojet fles twice a day from Nairobi.   (updated Jul 2023)
The airport looks in need of renovation, with the aerobridges looking rather unused, and walking to your plane wherever it happens to be on the tarmac seems the usual way to embark and disembark. There is a collection of ATMs in the building, as well as a café or two, and a small collection of souvenirs. The Karibuni lounge is open to a selection of club members, Star Alliance Gold frequent flyer members, and can also be accessed for a fee. It has decent coffee and drinks, internet terminals, and a pool table.
Taxis are abundant in the parking lot outside the terminal. Security keeps all vehicles away from the terminal proper, so when departing you have to walk from the parking lot up the upper roadway to departures. Officially you can't enter the terminal from ground level (arrivals). However, if you ask the guard nicely he will let you use the single lift rather than hump your baggage up the concrete external stairs. Taxis can't drop you at departures. There are numerous porters to help you with this trek.

By road[edit]
To get to Entebbe from the rest of Uganda will usually involve passing through Kampala. Small minibuses ("taxis" in Ugandan English or Matatus in Swahili) go to Entebbe from Kampala every 30 minutes or so. The fare is USh 3,500 but, for foreigners, sometimes the driver will ask for USh 7,000. The journey takes 45 minutes to 1 hour, much quicker when you avoid Kampala's chaotic rush hours. You can take the minibus in the minibus station near to the Kampala central market, with signs for every destination served. You can get off wherever you want en route, but if you ride to the bitter end, your journey will terminate at the 0.056632.45971 Matatu park in Entebbe.

To and from the airport[edit]
A special-hire taxi from the Entebbe airport to Entebbe town cost USh 15,000, or you can walk to the airport gate 500 m
and get a Boda-boda motorbike taxi to Entebbe town for USh 5000.

Get around[edit]
0°3′32″N 32°27′58″EMap of Entebbe
There are three types of public transport: boda-bodas, matatu and special hires.

By boda-boda[edit]
Boda-boda with, rather unusually, a helmeted pilot - no helmet is provided for his fearless fare, of course...
Entebbe street scene
The fastest and most dangerous method is the boda-boda: motorcycles that you see all over town. You won't be in Entebbe long before being propositioned by a boda rider. If you're not interested, a simple 'no' will get them to leave you alone. You can get most anywhere on the back of one for USh 2000–5000, but make sure to agree on the fare before the ride begins. Men usually ride facing forward while women are expected to ride side saddle; very risky. Females can get away with riding facing the front, but may be accused of riding "like a man," though the locals are fairly understanding of female tourists doing this.
Boda-bodas are extremely dangerous as their riders will do whatever it takes to get you to your destination quickly. Expect to dart in front of and against traffic and even through crowds of pedestrians when necessary. Boda-boda accidents account for most of the hospital visits and traffic fatalities in Entebbe; you have been warned!
Boda-bodas got their name from the bicycle taxis that operated at some of the busy border crossing points. Buses had to discharge their passengers at the exit border control, who then had to walk to the entry border control. The distance across no man's land at some borders can be considerable. Hence the bicycle taxis would cry "boda-boda" (a corruption of the English "border to border") to the weary travellers. These bicycle taxis can still be found in most smaller Ugandan towns; however, in Entebbe, they have been replaced by motorcycles.
As boda-boda collisions are one of the most common medical concerns in Uganda, hiring a taxi from a trusted source (decent hotel, friend, or colleague recommendation) may be wiser.

By matatu[edit]
Matatus are a series of licensed minibus taxis that follow relatively pre-set routes all over town (and many other parts of the country). It might be a bit confusing in the beginning how to use the matatus to efficiently get where you want to go, but it's really not so difficult.
Their routes usually go between the matatu park at the back of the 7Seasons Hotel and Kampala (or, more rarely, some suburb of Entebbe).
Matatus will stand in the park until they are full, something that normally takes less than 15 minutes, but can take over half an hour (or even over one hour late at night or on Sundays). Matatus that leave the area around the park are hence full, which makes it difficult to hop on a matatu at other places in the town centre. Unless you're very lucky, you'll have to go to where the matatus start in order to leave the town centre.
Each matatu has a driver and a conductor who opens the sliding door, takes fares and yells the destination. Don't be frightened if you can't understand what they're saying. Ask one of them for your destination and you'll be told yes or no. When you get in, expect to be squeezed. Each vehicle is licensed to carry 14 people, but they will pack in as many as will fit (and their belongings). If you don't like this, it's a good idea to sit in the back of the vehicle, since usually the squeezing is limited to the first 2 rows or, alternatively, pay double for the whole of the front seat next to the driver. Once the matatu starts moving people can get off at any time. When you reach your destination, tell your conductor "Stage" and they will stop the van.
Whenever a matatu has empty space the driver will go slowly and honk repeatedly. If you want to get on, just make some gesture and it will slow further down and shout out the destination, just shout your destination as response and they will pick you up if it's along the way. There are often also a number of further staging points along the way where the driver will again stop and wait until they can fill the vehicle. This can take a few seconds or several minutes; just be patient. In some cases drivers won't take you if you only go relatively short distances, since that will mean they'll risk losing money if they can't fill your place quickly once you're dropped. You pay the conductor when you exit, although some people give the conductor money while the vehicle is moving so that he can make change ahead of time. The normal fare is UGX3,500 per person for a trip all the way into Kampala (October 2015).
Going with a matatu is generally cheap, safe, slow and nice. Ugandans are often happy to start up a conversation or help you out, and if the conductor tries to overcharge you or make you take an inefficient route, passengers are likely to point that out to you and scold him. People also complain if a driver takes too long to wait for passengers or drives recklessly and will even collectively quit the matatu in protest if a driver drives badly.

By special hire[edit]
If you aren't up for the thrill of the bodas and don't have time for a matatu, then saloon car taxis - also called special hires - are readily available near the matatu park. A very few taxis have meters, but most have not. Be sure to agree on the fare before you get in the car or you may be in for a nasty shock. Don't be afraid to haggle either; most destinations can be reached for USh 10,000 or 15,000.

If you don't have a safari planned, this might be your opportunity to catch a glimpse of Africa's wildlife. It's no Singapore Zoo but, unlike many third world offerings, this is not a depressing place. There are good play facilities for children and the aviaries are especially interesting with weaver birds, shoebills and fish eagles. There's a medium-size collection of wildlife saved from captivity, including lions, rhinos, zebras, crocodiles, giraffes, hyenas, chimpanzee and others. All animals (apart from the snakes and crocodiles) are held in large, natural-like areas that gives a nice semi-authentic feeling. The trees and lianas are magnificent and you can understand why various 'Tarzan-type" movies were filmed here. Admission for foreign adults/children is US$15/10; Uganda resident foreigners USh 20,000/10,000; Ugandans USh 10,000/5,000 and you end up with 1.5-2 hours of fun. Opens daily at 08:30 and you may want to come early before the animals go hiding in the shade from the midday's sun.There is also accommodation inside the centre so you could stay the night in a Banda (en suite circular hut with a thatched roof & fly-screened windows) next door to the (very quiet) giraffes, elands and impala for US$40/60 single/double or stay in some serviced flats next to noisier animals for US$50/70 single/double. There is also dormitory accommodation available for USh 30,000 and camping is even cheaper. (updated May 2014)

Sleep[edit]


This guide uses the following price ranges for a standard double room:


Budget
under USD50


Mid-range
USD50-100


Splurge
over USD100

Partly because of the increasing number of UN and NGO visitors passing through, there is a lot of accommodation available, particularly in the mid-range section. Much of it is distinctly over-priced and some have got shabby and dilapidated rather quickly when (often absent) owners either lost interest or failed to generate the profits they expected. Mattresses and bedding are usually clean, but rooms are rarely fastidiously cleaned even when some outrageous prices are charged.

Budget[edit]
Dormitory accommodation & camping is also available at "the Zoo" See the listing for the Uganda Wildlife Educational Centre above
0.050132.46491 Entebbe Backpackers, 33/35 Church Rd (700 m from the Entebbe/Kampala road), ☏ +256 414 320 432, stay@entebbebackpackers.com. Free Wi-Fi.

This must be one of the very few lodgings where the rooms are much nicer than the rather dilapidated entrance and reception. They're tiled, clean and all en suite but only have mosquito nets over the beds as opposed to across the windows. Satellite TV in the room and Wi-Fi in the reception area is included in the tariff. Rather noisy and insecure since it's behind the Pearl Supermarket. Double US$35, single US$25. 
0.0495832.460823 Green Valley Guest House & Backpackers, 15 Mugula Rd, ☏ +256 414 321 212, info@greenvalleyentebbe.com. Check-in: 14:00, check-out: 10:00.

En suite: single US$40, double/twin US$50, family US$70; shared ablutions: single US$20, double US$25; dorm: 4 bedded US$12 pp, 6 bedded US$8 pp; camping: US$5-8 pp. Free Wi-Fi & satellite TV. 
0.055632.45954 Shade Guest House, 2 Kiwafu Close (Opposite the exit of the bus and taxi park), ☏ +256 414 321 715. Gruby, dilapidated, single storey courtyard reminiscent of a tiny stableyard just opposite the Matatu (minibus) station so noisy and dusty. Rooms are small, depressing and fly-blown with shared ablutions that are not quite as bad as the general ambience might lead you to expect. No security whatever, but Entebbe is a relatively honest place so this might not worry you as much as if it were in Kampala. Perhaps the most unusual feature is their pricing structure: a room for two people with 2 twin (beds costs USh 25,000 while one double bed costs USh 27,000. The more hygienically sensitive may prefer to camp in one of the more leafy suburban establishments for a few thousand shillings less. 
0.047332.46055 Skyway Hotel, 7 Mugula Rd, ☏ +256 700 951 315, info@skywayhotel.co.ug. Check-out: 10:00 is strictly enforced. You'll probably think you're at the wrong place when you arrive and see the red tiled roof, immaculately shaved lawn and smartly clipped box hedge. Once you go inside, it's clear that this place doesn't see too many big-spenders. The reinforced concrete construction with internal courtyard keeps the public areas cool but make sure there is a fan in your rather dilapidated but not too unsanitary room. Like most tourist offerings in Entebbe, there's a 24/7 armed guard and a high wall. There is a standby generator. Two channels of centrally-selected satellite TV are available in most of the rooms and almost all have an en suite shower, wash hand basin and WC. Make sure you ask for a mosquito net since most of the room windows are not screened. Intermittent Wi-Fi via Orange cellular ISP and a meagre breakfast is included in their tariff. The 8 bunk dormitory on the first floor is a light and airy room with windows (without net screening) opening on to a mature shade tree. The large bathroom for this dorm actually has a hip bath and hot water and each bunk has individual mosquito nets. Popular with those few UN staff that have to pay for their own accommodation. Main business is budget safaris. Room tip: Room 7 on the second floor is larger and quieter than most, is fairly effectively mosquito screened (May 2014) and has views from 2 windows in two walls set at right angles. Camping US$4/5 Dorm $17. Single USh 67,000, double USh 85,000, dorm USh 37,000, camping USh 10,000-13,000.

Mid-range[edit]


In June 2014, reports stated the 7Seasons Hotel, a prominent, 4-storey building near Entebbe Airport, was using locked glass-panelled fire exit doors on each floor where the mortice locks have no interior handle or "crash bar" for occupants to open the locked doors and flee in the event of fire or other emergency. For safety's sake, before checking into any hotel, verify the availability of working emergency exits.

There is a relaxing garden with mango, orange, paw-paw, guava, avocado and tangerine trees and the pineapple served at your breakfast will probably have only had to travel 20 m. The view from both the main house and the front garden over the lush suburban gardens of Bugonga as the sun sets over Lake Victoria makes a fine coda to your day. Free Wi-Fi. Credit cards not accepted. Airport meet and greet service is US$10. Double US$50, single US$40 en suite including breakfast.

Relatively clean single-storey buildings in a tranquil setting with 5 rooms in the main building and another 4 in outbuildings, some with their own patio.

Splurge[edit]
Partly because of the surrounding suburban gardens, partly because of the relative proximity of Lake Victoria and partly due to the Boma's bird baths and feeding stations, you might want to bring a long lens camera and binoculars...
0.052232.464412 Boma Guesthouse, Julia Ssebutinde Rd (In May 2014, road was still signed as "Gower Rd"), ☏ +256 772 467 929, boma@infocom.co.ug. Check-in: 14:00 or earlier depending on occupancy, check-out: 11:00.

Increasingly, marabou storks have become dependent on human garbage. Marabous conditioned to eating from human sources have been known to lash out when refused food.
0.057832.478813 Imperial Botanical Beach Hotel (middle of Lugard Avenue), ☏ +256 414 311 400, imperialhotels@hoteleq.com. Check-out: 10:00. A large hotel with 229 rooms on land allegedly originally grabbed from the Botanical Gardens by someone with political clout; perhaps appropriately, spectacularly ugly and menacing looking marabou storks up to 5 feet tall and with wingspans of more than 10 feet across now regularly prowl the car park. Mainly used for conferences and functions and there are many large meeting rooms dotted around the grounds. Can get rather depressing when no meetings are in progress as it is very quiet and the service is somewhat lacking. The "beach" is very small and swimming is forbidden but, in compensation, there is an enormous swimming pool. Bill Clinton stayed here, and you can stay in his suite for a nightly rate of US$600 according to the web site. Ordinary rooms are of a good three-star standard but you may need to call maintenance once or twice. Around US$110. Prices quoted on the website range from US$120 to $170 (without 18% VAT) but the room quality certainly does not justify such prices. 
0.04666732.47111114 Imperial Resort Beach Hotel. You'll either loathe or love this massive and architecturally distinctive building very different in scale and style to the other buildings in Entebbe. Inside, there is a large atrium with glass fronted lifts at each end. Like most of Uganda, service is slow, and rather hit and miss. Its 181 rooms spread over four floors are large and furnished in an Arab potentate style with good views over Lake Victoria and the extensive grounds but have poorly functioning, central air-conditioning. If you open the windows that have no screens to cool off, the lakeside location means your room will then quickly become an entomologist's delight after dark. Business people will appreciate the Ziba conference centre with its 1000 seat capacity equipped with six hi-tech screens descending from every corner of the ceiling, with a follow-on camera and a cordless digital sound system remotely controlled. There's a simultaneous translation system. In addition to the Ziba are nine other conference halls. There's also an amphitheatre. However, first impressions of the loose guard rail in the lift and dribbling shower in the changing rooms rather set the tone. Try your haggling skills and you may end up with a bargain in this often empty hotel.   (updated Sep 2021)
Stay safe[edit]
Compared to other places in Uganda, Entebbe is safe and clean. One major risk are the boda-bodas, both for riders and other traffic including pedestrians.

Go next[edit]
Uganda's capital Kampala is 35 km to the north, and can be reached by bus, taxi or shared taxi. Entebbe is located on a peninsula with the largest road going up to Kampala, and as mentioned above overland travel to anywhere will usually involve going to Kampala first.
The island of Buggala in Lake Victoria is a popular weekend beach destination for locals. There's a daily ferry from 0.080532.44922 Nakiwogo, about 4 km northwest of central Entebbe.
