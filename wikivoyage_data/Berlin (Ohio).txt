Entering Berlin on SR 39
Berlin is a village in Holmes County.


Understand[edit]
While English is the primary language, some Amish may additionally speak German in the form of Pensylvainia Dutch.
More conservative Amish consider it rude to be the subject of a photograph, particularly when their full face is visible. Ask permission, and if denied respect their wishes.
