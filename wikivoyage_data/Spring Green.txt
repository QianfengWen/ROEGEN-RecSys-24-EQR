Wisconsin River, Spring Green
Spring Green is a village of 1,600 people (2019) in Southwest Wisconsin and is the home of two unique architectural wonders: Frank Lloyd Wright's magnificent Taliesin, and Alex Jordan's mysterious House on the Rock.  The area is also popular with visitors because of a local Shakespearean theatre, the nearby Wisconsin River with its many recreational opportunities, and a 27-hole Robert Trent Jones-designed golf course.

Get around[edit]
Visitors will need a car to get around Spring Green. The intersection of Highway 14 and Highway 23 is near the center of town. Most lodgings are off Highway 14, while the small downtown is signposted from Highway 23.
Affluent visitors can choose to fly into the small airport located just north of Lone Rock and enjoy breakfast at the Piccadilly Lilly, a restaurant associated with the airport.

Many paths to choose, House on the Rock
Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin
43.1-90.1361111 The House on the Rock, 5754 Hwy 23. Sep: daily 9AM-7PM; off-season: F-Su 9AM-5PM. One of the weirdest museums you'll ever see. The house itself is an interesting architectural jumble, particularly the Infinity Room, which is suspended a long way over the forest canopy below. But jaws really start dropping in the second and third areas, which include "The Streets of Yesterday", the world's largest carousel, and more self-playing musical instruments than you ever thought existed. It's a staggering collection of toys, marvels, ephemera and oddities, brought together with an air of mystery and glee. It'd be nice if there were more labels to explain where these things came from, but then it'd take eight hours to see it all instead of four (and that's if you move at a brisk pace). Special exhibitions on for the Christmas season. Not recommended for people affected by claustrophobia or anxiety. Tickets for each of the 'tours' are $12.50, or $28.50 for all three.   
43.1415-90.07092 Taliesin, 5607 Cty. Rd. C (Entrances from both Highway 14 and Highway 23), toll-free: +1-877-588-7900, tours@taliesinpreservation.org. May – Oct: 9AM-4:30PM. Once the family home of famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright — and then an architectural commune and school under his direction — "Taliesin" refers both to the iconic house he designed there, and also to the sprawling complex of buildings on the site. It's one of eight buildings by Wright to be listed as a world heritage site. Regular performances and receptions are held here, and it's still a working school. There's an inexpensive tour ($16), where you'll see exteriors and interiors of the Hillside School. The longer tours, which take you to the interior and gardens of the home, Taliesin, are highly recommended for Wright enthusiasts but pricey ($47-80).
