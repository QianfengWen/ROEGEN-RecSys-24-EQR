Ixtlán del Rio is a small town in the southeast corner of Mexico's Pacific coast state of Nayarit. The town is best known as the site of a pre-Hispanic archaeological ruin that is sometimes known as Los Toriles. 


Understand[edit]
Archaeology[edit]
The only pre-Hispanic archaeological zone in Nayarit, Ixtlan del Rio is known for two things: 1) shaft tombs, and 2) five areas of pre-historic stone carvings (petroglyphs). The site is sometimes thought to represent a connection between civilizations in North America and South America. 
The site has 93 mounds with a main circular building that is called “Ehécatl-Quetzalcóatl” (although that is the Nahuatl name). The site was occupied up until the time of the conquest (at least until 1521).
Shaft tombs were found in several sites in the western Mexico states of Nayarit, Jalisco and Colima. Shaft tombs are essentially wells where human and animal remains were "buried", often with sculptures and other items. Shaft tombs date from about 500 BC to 500 AD (usually closer to 300 BC).
