Gunnedah is a large service town with a population of 9,726 (2016) in the New England region of New South Wales, Australia.  It has everything for the traveller passing through, with a couple of supermarkets, a choice of pubs and bistros, an upmarket restaurant or two, and a few great parks to stretch your legs. There is plenty of accommodation, and a few additional attractions in case you want to stretch your break for a day or two.  It's a six block town, with one (somewhat unnecessary) single traffic light.


Understand[edit]
Gunnedah Town Hall
The indigenous Kamilaroi (Gamilaraay) people were the original inhabitants of the district. The site of the town was settled by sheep farmers in the early 1830s. The poet Dorothea Mackellar wrote her best known poem "My Country" (I love a sunburnt country ...) about her family's farm near Gunnedah and published it in 1908. Coal was discovered nearby in 1877. Wool, cotton, beef, lamb, pork, cereal, and oilseed are the main agricultural industries, with approximately 80% of the shire's land under some kind of agricultural production. Gunnedah is home to Agquip, an annual agriculural exposition.
Gunnedah is the main centre of the Gunnedah Shire Local Government Area.

 Koala spotting. The town markets itself as the Koala capital of Australia. But that doesn't mean the critters are going to be easy to find.

 Walk along the Namoi. The Namoi is the river immediately to the north of the town. The town turns its back on the river, because of its temperamental flows, but it's certainly worth a short visit. Wildlife and birds are attracted the river. And when not in flood it's possible to walk across.

There are a few gift and speciality shops in town that make a shopping stroll down the main street worthwhile.

Drink[edit]
Gunnedah Hotel
You have a choice of pubs and clubs in Gunnedah.
The pastel pink Bowling and Services Club is the most eclectic.  With a bar and bistro next to the bowling greens, and another upstairs in the main building.  On a summer's weekend afternoon, the beers flow directly from the bowling club bar out on to the green.  A country institution a little frozen in time.  Your house wine will be a choice of red or white.  Your beer will be Tooheys or Carlton.
