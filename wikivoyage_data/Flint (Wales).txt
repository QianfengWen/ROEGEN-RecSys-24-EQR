Do[edit]
Wales Coast Path follows the entire Welsh coastline. Going north to south, the first stage starts at the border at the edge of Chester, and is 29 miles / 47 km via Flint to Prestatyn. These early miles are industrial and brownfield, with great vistas of mud when the tide's out on the Dee estuary.
Football: Flint Town United ("The Silkmen") play soccer in the Cymru Premier League. That's the top tier within Wales, but mostly amateur and on a par with England's fifth tier National League. Their home ground is Cae-y-Castell (sponsored as Essity Stadium), capacity 1000, on the coast near the railway station.
Connah's Quay Nomads also play in the Cymru Premier League. In spite of their name they do have a regular home ground at Deeside Stadium, capacity 1500, two miles southeast of Flint town centre.
