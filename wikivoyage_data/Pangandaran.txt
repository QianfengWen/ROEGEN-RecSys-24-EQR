Beach, Pangandaran
Pangandaran is a small town and a subdistrict in on the south coast of Java in Indonesia, in the East Parahyangan region.


Understand[edit]
With its black beaches, Pangandaran, will never stand a chance compared to Bali when it comes to attracting the big crowds. However, this is exactly the appeal of this remote town of beach resorts. Even though it is a popular tourist destination with the locals on national holidays for its fine sand beaches (considered to be of the finest in Java), you will not feel overrun by the tourism.
In the natural park you have also a beautiful white sand beach with monkeys where you can snorkel.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Susi Air[dead link] flies from Jakarta (with a short stop in Bandung) on small 12 passenger Cessnas, but the plane will fly only with minimum 8 passengers. -7.720389108.4898991 Nusawiru Airport (CJN IATA, also known as Pangandaran Airport) is a small airfield near Cijulang (along the road to Batu Karas), about 25 km west of Pangandaran.

By bus[edit]
The -7.685062108.6536822 bus terminal stops at the market just 500 m from the beach where you can find plenty of accommodation. It is close enough to walk, but if you are lazy or laden with heavy bags it will not take you long to spot a bicycle rickshaw (more likely, they will spot you) ready to help you empty your wallet.
Local buses run frequently from Pangandaran’s bus terminal to Tasikmalaya (Rp30,000, three hours), Ciamis (Rp20,000, 2½ hours), Banjar (Rp25,000, 1½ hours), Kalipucang or Majingklak (Rp5,000, 40 minutes) and to Cilacap (Rp25,000, 2½ hours). Buses also run along the west coast as far as Cijulang (Rp7,000, 40 minutes).
The large patas buses generally leave from the Perkasa Jaya depot, just north of town, and Budiman bus company depot, about 2km west of Pangandaran along Jl Merdeka. Frequent normal buses go to Bandung (Rp48,000, six hours) between 06:00 and 16:00.
However, the most comfortable way to travel to Bandung is with the Sari Harum (639276) door-to-door minibus for Rp100,000. Perkasa Jaya minibuses (639607) pick up from hotels for the trip to Jakarta’s Kampung Rambutan terminal (normal/air-con Rp125,000/150,000, nine hours). Travel agencies can also book tickets for most buses and minibuses for a premium, but transport to the depots is usually included. From Yogyakarta, travel agencies can book you a minibus to Pangandaran for around Rp130,000.

By car[edit]
Most travel agencies rent minibuses with drivers for about 500,000 Rupiah per day including driver and petrol. Put together your own tour and you may be able to negotiate a better rate. The most popular trip is a three-day tour to Yogyakarta. The usual route will take you as far as Wonosobo for the first night. The second day goes to Dieng for the sunrise, then on to Borobudur for the night. The final day is to Yogyakarta via Prambanan.
Seven hour drive from Jakarta.

By shuttle[edit]
Unlike the shuttle from Bandung to Jakarta, which is point to point, the shuttle from Bandung to Pangandaran is door to door. The tariff for regular shuttle travel is about Rp125,000 to Rp150,000 (236 kilometers from Bandung, while Bandung-Jakarta is about 150 kilometers). Sun In Pangandaran Group charge Rp100,000 only for customers who sleep in Sun In Pangadaran Hotel (East Beach). For executive shuttles, which use Suzuki APV or Daihatsu Grandmax for 5 passengers and a driver, the tariff is Rp200,000 per passenger.

By train[edit]
Contrary to its name, Pangandaran train from Jakarta and Bandung only goes up to Banjar through Tasikmalaya, but a shuttle to Pangandaran is available from Banjar railway station. Eksekutif class costs Rp100,000 and Ekonomi Premium class Rp50,000.

Get around[edit]
Map of Pangandaran
Pangandaran’s becak (tricycle) starts at around Rp10,000 and requires heavy negotiation. Bicycles can be rented for Rp25,000 per day, and motorcycles cost around Rp50,000 per day, excluding petrol. Petrol costs Rp8,500 per litre at petrol stations, but 9,500 - 10,000 per litre outside petrol stations.
Costs for becaks from the main bus station are price-fixed at Rp30,000. This is primarily due to that local hotels will provide the becaks a Rp30,000 commission for bringing in tourists who have not previously booked. It is less than 1 km from the bus station to the centre where all the hotels are.

See[edit]
-7.705229108.6593211 Pananjung Pangandaran Nature Reserve. This natural reserva is nearby on a peninsula connected to the mainland by a narrow neck of land, so you can see sunrise at east of Peninsula (Pantai Timur or East Beach) and sunset at west of Peninsula (Pantai Barat or West Beach). About 80% of the nature reserve is secondary rainforest. A few hours can be spent here without the need for a guide, however, guides are available and can obviously show you more of the reserve compared to going unattended. The flora of the nature reserve includes the Rafflesia. The fauna of the nature reserve includes deer, two species of monkey and monitor lizards. You can also see many deer and monkeys at and outside the border of the park, look around if you want to save the steep entrance fee.

Bamboo Bridge near Green Canyon, Pangandaran
-7.715993108.445422 Green Canyon. Journey through some truly wondrous jungle - rich in massive teak trees, palms, various hanging vinery and the shrill sounds of extensive bird-life. The canyon is apparently a couple of hundred metres long, but it is only safe for visitors to venture the first hundred. At the end of the passable section, the opportunity arises to jump from a 5 metre high stalagmite formation rising from the canyon floor into a deep pool below. The rocks aren't sharp or slippery and there's a myriad of harmless animals such frogs, dragonflies and miniature crabs to marvel at too. There are about 500 visitors a day, but it will increase to Rp2,000 per day on holidays make boat congestion on the narrow path and make boat long-waiting too. 
"Green Valley" About 15 km northwest of Pangandaran. It's possible to swim in the clear water of the second "Green Canyon" that exists above the dam of the main tourist "Green Canyon". This is slightly more difficult with bumpy road to get to and involves hiring a moped (cheap), but the journey and the final destination is very rewarding. There are barely any tourists and it feels like your own personal tropical river. It is much cheaper (Rp19,000 each for entry and parking, or 24,000 if taking photos) and provides far more freedom and scenery than "Green Canyon". Body rafting in Citumang can be done even in rainy season which it cannot be done in Green Canyon. The water of Citumang River is cleaner than in Green Canyon and relatively calm, so kids of 4 to 6 years old can safely enjoy body rafting. There are several waterfalls you can safely jump from, ranging 1m to 10m high into pools 6m deep, a rope swing, and a cave where it is said drinking the dripping water will bring everlasting youth. Body rafting with life vest and guide/guard cost is Rp120,000 for 1.5 hours, including lunch (both not required, but a life vest is recommended due to the amount of swimming). Weekends are hectic with local tourists, but in weekdays are very quiet.
"Paradise Beach" is a deserted island that will satisfy all your Robinson Crusoe adventure feelings for a day. Hire a boat (Rp600,000 for the day), stock up on supplies and have a picnic on the white sandy beaches of this sliver of paradise.
Do[edit]
In short; beach, sun, surfing and kicking back is the image of Pangandaran. However, there is so much more in this yet unspoilt paradise. Hire a motorbike and explore the surrounding area. Not far from the beach you will encounter the life of the unimpressed locals tending to their crops and livestock. Take a trip to the Green Canyon or Green Valley (see above) and continue on to Batu Karas, for some of the best beginner surfing Java has to offer.

Hiring a moped is well worth the Rp50,000 tuppence that it costs. Exploring the surrounding countryside and villages such as Batu Karas (the amazing two-way traffic bamboo bridge crossing the river is a highlight along with great surfing at the beach) and Karang Nini boasts some spectacular isolated beaches (one beach which hasn't been cleaned up since the 2006 tsunami also boasts a lagoon). Batu Hiu or "Shark Rock" provides beautiful views of the Indian Ocean and Pangandaran along with clifftop walks.
Note: Pangandaran and many of its surrounding villages charge a fee to enter (around Rp3,000 - 5,000), it may also be necessary to provide a monetary gift (Rp1,000 - 2,000) to the guard.
