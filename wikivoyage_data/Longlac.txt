History[edit]
The region’s recorded history began with the fur trade in the 18th century. 
The Geological Survey of Canada noted gold in quartz fragments around Little Long Lac in 1917. In 1921 the Hudson’s Bay Co. post moved across the lake to the railway at Calong, near the centre of today’s town. By 1934, a gold rush absorbed the area from Long Lac to Nipigon, a belt 100 km long and 40 km wide. The village of Longlac was established soon after. 
The arrival of Pulpwood Supply Co. in 1937 gave a major impetus to the economy. The company floated pulpwood through lakes and rivers south to Lake Superior. In 1942, the highway arrived from Geraldton.
The Little Long Lac Mine produced over 600,000 ounces of gold from 1934 to 1953.

Climate[edit]
Greenstone experiences a humid continental climate, with long, brutally cold winters and warm summers.
