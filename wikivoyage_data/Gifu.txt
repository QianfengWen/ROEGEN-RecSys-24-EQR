Map of Gifu
By plane[edit]
 Chubu International Airport (中部国際空港, NGO IATA), Nagoya. The nearest airport to Gifu. Meitetsu trains run directly from the airport to Meitetsu Gifu Station three times per hour at a cost of ¥1310 for an unreserved seat, or ¥1660 for a reserved seat; seat reservations are mandatory on the limited-stop μSKY trains. The trip takes about one hour. (updated Aug 2020)
 Nagoya Airport (Komaki Airport, 名古屋飛行場, NKM IATA), Nagoya. Has domestic flights.  (updated Aug 2020)
By train[edit]
Gifu is a station on the JR Tokaido Main Line and JR Takayama Line. Frequent services on the Tokaido Line run to Gifu from Nagoya Station (18-25 min, ¥450). From Tokyo it takes approximately 2¼-2½ hrs via the Tokaido Shinkansen Nozomi service, changing at Nagoya (¥11,000). The Nozomi is not covered by the Japan Rail Pass; Hikari services from Tokyo will slightly increase the travel time. From Kyoto and Osaka, it takes slightly over an hour to reach Gifu via Nozomi, changing in Nagoya (¥6,100).
The Nagoya to Gifu journey is actually one in which travel by JR line is faster and cheaper — the private Meitetsu Railway runs from Nagoya into Meitetsu-Gifu Station (30 min, ¥540). The Meitetsu Station in Gifu is about 400 m NE of the JR station.
Limited Express trains on the JR Takayama Line run from JR Gifu to Gero Onsen (80 min, ¥3,300) and Hida-Takayama (2 hr 15 min, ¥4,800).
There is also Limited Express service via Maibara to Kanazawa (2½ hours, ¥6700) and Toyama (3 hr 15 min, ¥7800). In addition there is a more scenic route to Toyama via the Takayama line which takes around 3 hr 55 min.
Gifu-Hashima is a local stop on the Tokaido Shinkansen in the city of Hashima, about 12 km southwest of Gifu. It is possible to reach Gifu from here using the Meitetsu Takehana Line, which runs out of nearby Shin-Hashima Station — through trains to Meitetsu-Gifu run from the late afternoon and take 30 minutes at a cost of ¥420. Many trains terminate at Kasamatsu from where you can transfer to reach Gifu. Most travelers coming from the west, however, opt to travel to Nagoya or Maibara and change there for train service to Gifu.

By bus[edit]
There are scheduled buses (5 times/day) connecting Osaka Namba OCAT to Shin-Gifu Bus Center.  The trip takes less than 3 hours under normal traffic condition. JR Bus has one night bus from Osaka and Kyoto to Gifu Station. Odakyu Bus operates the Gifu Papillon, a night bus, from Tokyo (Shinjuku Station) to Gifu. Within the prefecture, there are buses from Gujo and Takayama. Gifu's close proximity to Nagoya means that very few highway buses actually stop here. Travelers considering coming by bus will have a lot more options by going to Nagoya and then taking a 20-minute train ride to Gifu Station.

Get around[edit]
Gifu City is serviced by the Meitetsu-run Gifu Bus as well as JR Buses. JR passes are accepted on JR buses. Gifu Park, where the castle and other popular sites are located, is about a 45 minute walk from Gifu Station, so most travelers opt to take a bus. Buses to the area run about every 10 minutes. 
There are three rent-a-cycle stations in downtown Gifu (JR Gifu Station, Gifu City Hall South Branch, and Gifu Park). Rental bikes for ¥100 per day.

Do[edit]
cormorant fishing at Nagara River near Mt. Kinka
Ukai (cormorant fishing) occurs every year between May 11th and October 15th on the Nagara River. Gifu City is the only place where this tradition has continued uninterrupted for 1300 years. Silent film actor Charlie Chaplin requested to stop in Gifu for the event on 2 separate visits to Japan, describing it as "Japan's highest art form". You, too, can watch this spectacular event by boarding a viewing boat or watching from the banks of the river. Most of the action is upriver from Nagara-bashi. Tour boats begin embarking from about 18:00 (for those serving dinner aboard) until 18:30 or 19:00 (a bit later during the peak of summer). The night-fishing show begins after dark, around 20:00 or later during the summer months, and finishes by 21:00, in time to get back to a train station and return to Nagoya for those on a day trip.

Japanese kindergartners climb Kinka-zan
35.433314136.7811221 Mt. Kinka (金華山) (From the train station, take buses bound for Gifu Park). Mt. Kinka is a 329-meter peak next to Gifu Park, with good views of the Nagara River and the city below. On top of Mt. Kinka is Gifu Castle, a small castle museum, and a "squirrel park". Most people will take the ropeway to the top. As an alternative, you can hike through the forest, taking either the shorter and steeper hyaku-magari ('100-bend') or the longer and gentler nana-magari ('7-bend') trail. Each will take over an hour, and good hiking footwear is recommended, especially on the "100-bend" (actually 135-bend) trail. The meiso no komichi (めい想の小径) trail is easier, with some steep sections, and is a popular school outing for local kindergartens; while the uma no se (馬の背 'horseback') trail is direct and more demanding. Ropeway round trip ¥1050, ¥520 children. Museum ¥200. Squirrel park ¥200. 
 Nagara River Fireworks Festival. Last Sat in Jul and first Sat in Aug, fireworks start at 19:00. This is actually two events, each sponsored by a rival local newspaper (the Chunichi Shinbun and the Gifu Shinbun). As they are rivals, of course they attempt to out-do one another, resulting in two spectacular firework displays on the banks of the Nagara River, against the backdrop of Mount Kinka. If you miss out on a seat, the bridge makes a good vantage point to stand and watch — but wear comfortable shoes, as the displays last around 90 minutes. Special buses run from Meitetsu Gifu and JR Gifu Stations from 16:30 onwards. Wander around and sample typical Japanese festival foods from the many stalls lining the upper banks, and enjoy watching the many people in yukatas. The special buses on the way back are very crowded, so you may find it easier to make the 40-minute walk back to the city centre. (updated Aug 2020)
Buy[edit]
The traditional industries of Gifu City are Japanese umbrellas (wagasa) and lanterns, both of which are made of hand-made paper.

You'd be needing reservations for this place every night if it weren't 10 km from Gifu Station. (updated Jan 2018)
 Fandango (150 meters southwest of Mirai Hall, which is across the street from Memorial Center). It's best to get reservations for this place, even on weekdays, because it seats very few people. Decor is Spanish, but the menu is Western eclectic with a touch of sashimi, as is usual in this area of Japan, and is very much the owner's style. Try the beef tongue, or ask the chef to choose. Prices are a bit high, but you get some very fancy food. The owner speaks a little English. This is definitely the place to impress someone on your first date. (updated Jan 2018)

The other Ramens and the Dote are great too, and the Gyoza is strange, but good and green and healthy, and cooked with no oil! Prices are cheap. The owner speaks no English, but he is very friendly, and is a wonderful character to sit in front of and watch. If you use your toilet at home, you won't need to use the port-a-potty outside. You'll never find this place empty, and it's often hard to get a place to park or sit, even on weekdays! (updated Jan 2018)

B's Cafe, Yanagase Shopping Mall.  A cool bar frequented by young Japanese and a few foreigners.  The management and bar staff are very friendly, it plays good music and it has 'funky environs'.  It often holds launch parties for up and coming Japanese music.  Drinks are reasonable, at ¥500, and on the first Thursday of every month there's no cover charge.  Secondroom, just below offers a place to chill out with the owner, Bryan.
Bier Hall, near Gifu Meitetsu station. The main gaijin hangout in Gifu City, and popular with Japanese too. Notable for the incredibly friendly owner, who speaks a little English, and has an astonishing memory for faces. On your second visit she will greet you like a regular! Also of note is the book exchange corner - if you've finished the paperback you bought to read on the plane, feel free to swap it for a different title. Gifu knit club meet here during the winter, so don't be alarmed if you come in on a Tuesday evening and see lots of people with pointy sticks.
Bar Leon is kitty-corner from the northeast corner of Yanagase on Kanda-machi street. This place is the second most popular foreigner's hangout in Gifu, and would likely be the favorite place if it was nearer to Gifu Station. It has character, ambiance and a wide variety of Japanese and foreign clientele. Don't let the name fool you: Besides alcohol, a wide variety of live music, and dancing, this place has delicious food (1/2 price on Mondays) like the whole chicken, roasted with a Brazilian 12 chicken rotisserie in the Latin American style, and served with a unique spicy, milky-cheesy sauce on the side.
Scrum is a small bar located above Bier Hall (go up some stairs to the left of Bier Hall). The theme, not surprisingly, given the name, is rugby, more specifically the New Zealand All Blacks- who the very friendly owner is obviously a huge fan of. At Scrum you'll find a good selection of imported beers, a pool table, and plenty of posters of NZ rugby players.
Sleep[edit]
There are numerous business hotels near JR Gifu Station. Stingy backpackers may wish to note that whilst Gifu does have one manga cafe, it offers a single tatami with a table covering half of it as its flat booth, making it not really one suitable for sleeping within.
