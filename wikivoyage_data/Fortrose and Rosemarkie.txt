Fortrose and Rosemarkie are two small towns a mile apart on the Black Isle in  Easter Ross in the Scottish Highlands. In 2020 Fortrose had a population of 1680 and Rosemarkie had 640. Between them, Chanonry Point projects into the Moray Firth, where dolphins are often seen. "Chanonry" refers to canons or priests, and there was a monastery hereabouts in the Pictish era.

See[edit]
57.5808-4.13051 Fortrose Cathedral, 7 Cathedral Square, Fortrose IV10 8TB, ☏ +44 1667 460232. Daily Apr-Sep 9:30AM-5:30PM, Oct-Mar 10AM-4PM. Ruin of a red sandstone cathedral built around 1250 AD. Many medieval nobles are buried here but their plots are lost. After the Reformation it was stripped of anything of value (such as roof lead) and became tumbledown, though the church was used into the 18th century and the graveyard to the 19th. What is now a separate building east was the sacristry and chapter house, and became the tolbooth and town council offices until 1939. Free.   (updated Aug 2022)
57.5912-4.11482 Groam House Museum, High St, Rosemarkie IV10 8UF, ☏ +44 1381 620961. Apr-Nov: daily 1-4PM. 18th century house converted into a museum for local Pictish stones - the best is the Rosemarkie Stone, found in the floor of the old church. Another fragment depicts someone squaring up to a lion's jaws: it's called the Daniel Stone as the scene is assumed to be Biblical, but it looks more like a circus act. There's also a display of the work of George Bain (1881-1968) who studied the styles of Pictish and early Christian art, such as the Book of Kells, and re-launched their use in modern design. Free.   (updated Aug 2022)
57.5741-4.0933 Chanonry Point at the end of Ness Road has an automated lighthouse, picnic area and views across the Moray Firth. It's a good spot to see bottlenose dolphins, which line the strait on the incoming tide and wait for dinner to flow into their mouths. There's a monument to "Dark Kenneth" Mackenzie (Coinneach Odhar), the 17th-century Brahan Seer, who predicted the Battle of Culloden, Mrs Thatcher, the North Sea oil industry and much else. He failed to foresee his own horrible slaying in Dingwall, chiefly because he never existed. None of the accounts of his sayings and doings stand up, and the prophesies were all concocted with hindsight.
