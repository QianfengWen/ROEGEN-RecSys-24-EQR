Beach at Bakkhali
Bakkhali is a seaside resort in the 24 Parganas region of West Bengal, India.


Understand[edit]
Bakkhali is on one of the many deltaic islands spread across Southeast Bengal and has a popular sea beach. Most of the islands are part of the Sundarbans, barring a few at the fringes. Some of these are joined together with bridges over narrow creeks. This small island juts out into the vast expanse of the Bay of Bengal.
There is an 8 km (5.0 mi)-long beach stretching from Bakkhali to Fraserganj with gently rolling waves. These are twin towns now forming one continuous locality. Except on an occasional holiday, the beach is not crowded. A small stretch near Bakkhali has been lit up. It is a hard beach suitable for cycling or even driving. One can take long walks with coconut water.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The nearest airport is at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport (CCU IATA) in Kolkata. Bakkhali is around 147 km or a 4½-hour car ride from the airport.

By train[edit]
21.77177588.239071 Namkhana railway station (station code: NMKA). The nearest railway station to Bakkhali. There are regular trains from Sealdah via Lakshmikantapur and Kakdwip to Namkhana. The first train starts at around 4AM from Sealdah. Then at around 4:40AM then at 5:10AM, 7:30AM and the next to this one is at a long gap at around 9:30AM. You should take the train at 5:10AM from Sealdah. Train fare is ₹25 and the journey takes around 2½ hr. There are also special trains from New Delhi to Namkhana via Lucknow and Prayagraj (Allahabad) during the Gangasagar Mela..   (updated Oct 2022)
From Namkhana station, you will get a rickshaw to reach the bus stand from where one can get buses for Bakkhali which take around 35 min. and the fare is ₹16.50. You can also hire private cars from the Namkhana bus stand/railway station, the fare will be ₹350 to ₹500 depending on your bargaining skills. The Bakkhali bus stand is very close to most of the hotels and a 5- to 7-min walk from the beach.

By bus[edit]
West Bengal Transport Corporation (WBTC) has regular bus service from Esplanade to Bakkhali. One starts at 7AM in the morning from Esplanade and reaches Bakkhali at around 11:30AM and leaves from Bakkhali after half an hour for Kolkata (Esplanade). Another starts at 8AM from Esplanade to reach bakkhali at 12:30PM and starts from Bakkhali after half an hour forty five minutes. So the bottom-line is that there are two round trips from Kolkata to Bakkhali provided by WBTC. This schedule is subject to change and one must confirm it from Esplanade Bus Terminus before venturing out from Kolkata. The route of the bus is Esplanade- Alipore-Chiriakhana-Taratala-Diamond Harbour-Kakdwip-Namkahana-Bakkhali, the fare is ₹70.
At Namkhana, the bus has to be transported across the Hatania-Doania creek in a special ferry. It is expected that the Namkhana Bridge will be open to big vehicles, once the complete work is done. The ferry service is available from 7AM-11PM except from noon till 1:45PM (lunch hour). There are plenty of local buses up to Namkhana and then again from Namkhana to Bakkhali.

By car[edit]
Bakkhali is 122 km by road from central Kolkata. The road runs through Diamond Harbour and Kakdwip to Namkhana.  A bridge over Hatania-Doania river at Namkhana is open to small vehicles (cars), making it possible to travel directly to Bakkhali without having to wait for ferry. The 130-km stretch from Kona expressway (with links to the Mumbai and Delhi sections of the golden quadrangle project linking the four metropolises of India) and Bakkhali has been marked as National Highway (NH) 117.
The road journey from the fringe of Kolkata to Bakkhali takes about 3 hours. However, crowded market places and occasional stretches of bad road can delay movement. Some sections are very crowded, especially in the early morning because of the bazaar, and later at the evening time, there is no bypass for these smaller towns.

Get around[edit]
Map of Bakkhali
There are many electric rickshaws, locally known as Totos and indigenous mechanised cycle vans, available in Bakkhali which serves the purpose of sightseeing perfectly. In case, you prefer a hired car, it is suggested that you contact and inform your hotel in advance, as availability might be less in peak season. Most Bakkhali hotels have chargeable dormitories for drivers to stay.
The ride in the crude bhut-bhuti, a motorised country boat, from Fraserganj fishing harbour to Jambudwip, a small, uninhabited and forested island out in the sea, can be a thrilling experience. The two-hour ride (both ways) costs ₹250-300 per head. The country boats can also be hired for other rides. The weak-hearted are advised not to take the rides.
For all the spots a rickshaw van will charge you at max ₹60 per head and it will take around 5 hr to visit all the spots and stay for 1 to 2 hr in Jambudwip.

See[edit]

 Henry Island (a 10-min ride from Bakkhali), ☏ +91 33 2337 6470. You can take a trip to Henry's Island and Watch Tower. A rickshaw trip will travel through the local villages and their surrounds. From the watch tower you can view the entire Sunderban area. It is a splendid view. On one side you can see the Bakkhali Beach in the far distance and on all the other side the green expanses of Sundarban. Have a look at the view from the watch tower and do walk to the beach. The walk goes through a stretch of mangrove jungle accessed by crossing a small bamboo bridge. The credit for turning Henry Island into a holiday hotspot goes to the fisheries department of the state government which has set up a pisciculture project here. The fisheries department has dug more than 50 ponds occupying over 25 bigha on 100-hectare of land. Trees such as gora, kankru, palm, naturally growing sundari and hetal have been planted. Henry Island is named after a European who surveyed land in the area in the late 19th century. Dense mangrove forest is parted by numerous canals covering the area. Wildlife such as tiger, deer, wild pig, crocodile and snakes were common. The island was only an extension of the Sundarbans and the surveyor could not have dreamt that it would become a human habitat in little more than a hundred years. There are 3 guest houses on Henry Island. If you wish you can stay there too. The lodges are named Mangrove,  Sundari and Bani. Bani has a watchtower on the roof is very close to the sea beach. You can enjoy a good view of the surrounds from there. These lodges belong to the Fisheries Department of West Bengal. ₹10 entry fee.

Crocodile Park: You can also visit the Crocodile Park and Mangrove forest just beside the Bakkhali Bus Stop. The entry fee is ₹10.

Buy[edit]
Credit cards are not accepted anywhere. There are a couple of ATMs, including one at Axis Bank at Bakkhali Bus Stand, but it is recommended to carry cash as the ATM tends to dry up quickly.

Eat[edit]
Frazargunj Indian Hotel beside Hotel Deepak. You will get many varieties with wonderful taste and reasonable price. If you buy sea fish and crab from outside and ask them to prepare it for you, they will do that happily for a small fee. These young men are very cooperative.
New Hotel Parijat in between the local bus-stand and WBTDC Lodge provides the best food here at moderate prices. You will find all sorts of fishes like pomfret, hilsa, prawn and the standard rui and katla too. A normal rui thali with other recipes costs ₹35. Chicken meal ₹80, prawns ₹100. No breakfast available here.  Extremely courteous staff.
You can also try the various road side shacks for lunch and dinner. They come a little cheaper but the food can be sumptuous and tasty. However, because Bakkhali doesn't have a steady flow of tourists, most restaurants don't have a steady menu for lunch or dinner. You have to place an order for lunch/dinner a few hours in advance.
Henry Island can be a paradise for non-vegetarians, but you are left with little or no option for vegetarians, which can become a major problem at times.
Most hotels have their own restaurants and some have bars.
Sleep[edit]





Note: To avoid the unsavory, corrupt, and thoroughly untrustworthy fraud booking services based in Kolkata, it is best to arrange a place to stay on arrival without advance reservation.
