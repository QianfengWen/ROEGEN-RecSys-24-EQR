Understand[edit]
Orientation[edit]
Carrollton is southwest of Newport News, southeast of Smithfield, and northwest of Suffolk.

Name[edit]
Carrollton is named for the Carroll family, prominent landowners of the 19th century. The remaining home of the Carroll family is located at the intersection of Reynolds Drive and Norsworthy Drive, and is considered to have been in deteriorating condition for many years. At one time the home also is said to have served as the Carrollton Country Store.
The Carroll home is one of only a handful of truly historic Carrollton homes. It predates the original Carrollton Post Office, which is now occupied by a locally owned heating business. The old post office is located about 300 feet (100 m) east of the Carroll home on Norsworthy Drive near the western end of the current CDP. Its flagpole still stands.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Carrollton has 4 highways that run through it:

U.S Route 17, The locals will tell you Route 17 is the most crowded highway in Carrollton, But for many travelers it may be their best option due to the fact it stretches all the way down to Florida.
U.S Route 258, If you are coming from North Carolina, taking 258 is most likely a better choice because it is generally less crowded as the most major city in the area is still up ahead.
Virginia State Route 10, If you are coming from Central Virginia, State Route 10 is likely your best bet, particularly if you are headed away from a big city.
Virginia State Route 32,  Route 32 is most likely not a viable option to take for most travelers, at least not for the entire way here due to the fact that Virginia Route 32 only exists, in Suffolk, Smithfield, Carrollton, and Newport News only being 38.89 miles. If you are coming from one of those cities State Route 32 may be your best bet due to it being the least crowded of the 4 highways most of the time.

You can get here from Newport News by going on the James River Bridge, You can also get here from Suffolk by going on the Sidney Bertram Hazelwood Sr. Bridge, To get here from Smithfield you can take U.S Route 258, Virginia State Route 10, or Virginia State Route 32.
