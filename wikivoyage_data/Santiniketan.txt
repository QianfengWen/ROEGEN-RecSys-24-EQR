Santiniketan (Bengali: শান্তিনিকেতন Śāntiniketan, SHAHN-tih-nih-keh-tawn), also spelt Shantiniketan, is a university town in the Birbhum district of West Bengal. It was established by Debendranath Tagore in the second half of the 19th century, and then developed by his son, Rabindranath Tagore, the leading figure of the Bengali Renaissance, whose vision became what is now a university town with the ancient gurukula method of learning. It has produced such diverse personalities as Indira Gandhi (once a Prime Minister of India), Satyajit Ray (an Oscar-winning filmmaker) and Amartya Sen (a Nobel laureate) and has been home to great artists and musicians. Santiniketan is also famous for the baul culture. Around 1.2 million visitors visit Santiniketan annually. It has been designated as a  UNESCO World Heritage Site in September 2023.

In 1863, Debendranath Tagore took on permanent lease 20 acres (8.1 hectares) of land, along with two chātim (ছাতিম) trees from zamindar Bhuban Mohan Sinha. The leased area was a small village and the den of a gang of notorious dacoits. After the leader of the gang surrendered to Debendranath, they started helping him in developing the area. Debendranath built a guest house there and named it Santiniketan (literally the "abode of peace"). Gradually, the whole area came to be known as Santiniketan.
In 1901, Rabindranath Tagore established a school in Santiniketan, called Brahmacaryāśram (ব্রহ্মচর্যাশ্রম), which became the Visva-Bharati University in 1921. A brainchild of Rabindranath, the Visva-Bharati University is a unique learning centre in the sense that the education takes place under a tree, instead of in a classroom. It got the status of a central university by 1951.
Several artists are also closely associated with Santiniketan other than Rabindranath Tagore and his father, including Nandalal Bose, Ramkinkar Baij and Benode Behari Mukherjee. Their works can be found throughout the town.

Santiniketan is 212 km (132 mi) from Kolkata by road. Good drivers can cover the distance in about 3 hours.
Santiniketan is connected with Kolkata by an excellent 4-lane expressway. From Kolkata, travel to Dankuni and take the Durgapur Expressway (NH 19). It will bypass Saktigarh, Bardhaman and Panagarh. At Panagarh (Darjeeling More), turn right. After crossing the Ajay River, take the road to the right at Ilambazar and proceed towards Bolpur. At the Santiniketan–Sriniketan junction (also called Surul More) take the road to the left. Coming from the direction of Kolkata, one can also take the NH 114 route via Talit, Guskara, Bhedia and Surul More by taking a right turn from the Durgapur Expressway just after crossing Bardhaman on the right (where the Renaissance Township is on the left) and taking this route via Nababhat More.  It saves time and the distance is less from the above route by about 50 km.

Get around[edit]

You can also look at the map of the Visva-Bharati campus in Santiniketan.

By rickshaw[edit]
Electric rickshaws (locally known as totos) are the most convenient and cheap means of transportation these days. The older cycle rickshaws are still available and can be availed, though it would cost more. If you are a tourist, don't get on the cycle rickshaws in front of the museum that are manned by persistent teenagers as they will take you on a farcical circulatory route to make you spend more. Choose the older guys. Or just walk round the town.

By car[edit]
Hired cars and taxis are not always readily available.

By bicycle[edit]
If you are planning an extended stay, it may be worth your while to purchase a bicycle from one of the many local cycle shops. A brand new bicycle costs ₹3,200-3,600.
