Grand Popo is a city in Benin.

Grand Popo Market

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Fly into either Cotonou or Lome and take a taxi for about 1200 CFA.

By taxi[edit]
You can pick up a taxi in Cotonou at the Grand Marché. Definitely negotiate the price in advance; if you don’t want to share the taxi with several others you can always rent the whole taxi (generally multiply rate for a single person by six). The taxi will drop you anywhere along the route; if you ask to be let off at the main carrefour (intersection) you can easily pick up a zemidjan to your hotel. To the Auberge or Villa Karo it is about a 200-250 CFA trip. If you are staying at Awale Plage, Bel Azul, or Etoile de Mer the taxi can take you straight there since they’re on the highway.

Get around[edit]
Grand Popo has very little traffic. You can pick up a zem (usually wearing a green shirt and baseball cap, but not always) easily at the carrefour, but sometimes, you’ll have to wait a while to get one on the side of the road. Walking is also a good option as most restaurants and hotels are located on a main stretch of road. To get to some of the tourist sites, you will need a pirogue or a motorboat, which will be provided by a tour guide.
The best way to see the sites (besides the beach) is to engage a tour guide. Talk to your hotel about finding a reputable guide – don’t trust guys who come up to you on the side of the road; even if they offer an attractive deal. The government doesn’t have a system of authorizing guides yet, but hotels usually work with the same guides over and over and can recommend someone trustworthy. Also ask them about pricing. There are two circuits depending on how much time you have and how much you would like to spend. The first goes to sites close by and uses a pirogue to get around on the river. It usually costs around 10,000 CFA per person, though discounts for larger groups can be arranged. The second, longer, circuit goes out to where the river Mono meets the ocean (for which you need a motorboat). This costs more – generally starting at 40,000 CFA.

Lion Bar +229 95 42 05 17. Rooms from 5,000 CFA, Camping 2500 CFA. Has a restaurant with one or two options each night and a bar. Very laid-back vibe – the owner is a Rastafarian and the whole place is decorated with painting and quotes of famous Rastas and reggae musicians. The only indication from the street that the hotel is there is a small sign saying Lion Bar, but there is often a bright green car also painted with famous Rastas parked out front. A favourite of U.S. Peace Corps Volunteers.
