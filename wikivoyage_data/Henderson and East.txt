Henderson[dead link] is the second largest city in Nevada. The border between Henderson and Las Vegas has become virtually nonexistent - one city butts up against the other. This article indeed doesn't only cover Henderson but also Las Vegas east of the Strip and south of the airport.


Understand[edit]
One area of Henderson, Green Valley, was the first master planned community in the state.

Get in[edit]
Map of Las Vegas/Henderson and East


By car[edit]
From Arizona, Boulder City, Lake Mead or Lake Las Vegas[edit]
If you are coming from Boulder City or Arizona, you can either take US 93 or Route 166. Route 166 is Lakeshore Drive and is going to change into State Route 564 once you are not overlapping with Route 147 anymore. In US 93, it will change into a freeway as soon as you pass the Railroad Pass Hotel & Casino. If you came from Lake Mead or Lake Las Vegas, get on SR 564 and continue until you enter Henderson. If you took US 93, you will have to pass through Boulder City, and never take the exit after crossing over Veterans Memorial Dr intersection. It will head to Searchlight and Needles. Once you get there, it will change into an overlapping I-515, and, take any exit you want, including Wagonwheel Dr/Nevada State Dr, Boulder Hwy, Horizon Dr, College Dr, or any exit, as long as it is not on I-215.

From Central Las Vegas[edit]
Get on I-515, or I-215, or whatever road you take to get to Henderson Drive. To enter Central Henderson via I-515, take exit 61 to Lake Mead. On I-215, none, just continue till end of freeway.

From N. Las Vegas[edit]
Get on I-15, and then get on I-515 or I-215, do the same as Central Las Vegas.

By plane[edit]
35.972778-115.1344441 Henderson Executive Airport (HSH  IATA) is the town's main airport, acting primarily as a reliever airport for the much busier 36.0852-115.15062 Harry Reid International Airport (LAS IATA). Otherwise the Henderson Executive Airport is only available for general aviation and VIP flights but can be used as a reliever airport for the busier Harry Reid Airport if needed.

Gambling[edit]




If you win...
Chances are that, if you win it big in Henderson and you are not a U.S. citizen your winnings will be subject to a 30% withholding tax from the Internal Revenue Service. That $10,000 slot winning can dwindle quite quickly if that is taken off the top. Not to worry though you can reclaim your gambling winnings tax through a 1042-S form. You should get this from the casino so don't lose it: it is your starting ticket to getting your gambling winnings back.
