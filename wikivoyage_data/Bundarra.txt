Understand[edit]
Bundarra is named for the Kamilaroi/Gamilaraay word for the grey kangaroo. Bundarra Station was founded in 1836 by Edward G. Clerk and a hotel and store were established on the future townsite.  The historic townscape of Bundarra led to the town hosting some on location filming for the Fred Schepisi directed film, The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith, based on the Booker Prize winning novel by Thomas Keneally. Bundarra is part of the Bundarra-Barraba Important Bird Area which is home to one of only three breeding areas in New South Wales for the endangered regent honeyeater.
