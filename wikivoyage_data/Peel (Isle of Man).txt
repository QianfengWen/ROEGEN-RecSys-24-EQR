The round tower within Peel Castle
54.2264-4.69911 Peel Castle (Cashtal Phurt Ny h-inshey), West Quay IM5 1TB, ☏ +44 1624 648050. Apr-Oct daily 11:00-15:00. This occupies St Patrick's Isle, a tidal islet now connected to town by road. There was settlement here from the Bronze Age, and a monastic community possibly visited by St Patrick, and in the 11th century the Norwegians fortified this obvious defensive position. The impressive red sandstone curtain wall was built in the 14th century, while the church / cathedral remained in use - the round tower was probably its free-standing belfry. Fortifications continued to 1860, but the site within the walls is mostly open. The cathedral fell derelict in the 18th century; the other main ruins are of the Governor's residence. Adult £9, child free.   (updated Apr 2023)
54.2279-4.69482 Peel Lighthouse is the harbour light at the end of the breakwater, built in 1896. You can walk or drive here via West Quay, which skirts the castle walls, for views back over town.
Castle Jetty is a little pier along West Quay, with a stubby green-hooped harbour light built in 1946, looking like a dalek trying on a Celtic football shirt but failing to find its size.
East Quay on the other river bank has the best vista of the castle. Fenella footbridge is the shortcut to West Quay.

54.2228-4.69624 St Peters is a ruin on Castle St. It was built in the 15th century as a "chapel of ease" - the one you used if you couldn't reach the island cathedral - and when that fell derelict St Peters became the parish church. It was abandoned once the new cathedral opened, and most of it was lost to fire in 1954.

54.2217-4.69127 Cathedral Isle of Man (Saint German's Cathedral), Derby Rd IM5 1HH, ☏ +44 1624 844830. A fine Gothic Revival church built in 1879-84, over a century after the castle cathedral fell into ruin. St German of Man (410-474) was a Celtic missionary; his pattern day is 13 July. It's the senior Anglican church of Sodor and Man, rebranded as Cathedral Isle of Man in 2015.   (updated Apr 2023)
Further out[edit]
54.2039-4.64248 Tynwald Hill was the original site of the island parliament, in the hamlet of St John's. On Tynwald Day 5 July (corresponding to midsummer day by the Julian calendar) crowds gather to hear all new legislation proclaimed in Manx and English, and there's a fair.
Tynwald Arboretum is a bosky park north side of Tynwald Hill.
54.1638-4.749 Niarbyl is a scenic promontory and shingle beach. The "Japetus Suture" is visible here: the opposite of a fault line, this is where the continents of Laurentica and Baltica fused 420 million years ago as Japetus Ocean closed up. The thatched fisherman's cottage has featured as a film location.
