Mahahual (also spelled Majahual) is a city in the municipality of Othón P. Blancothe, state of Quintana Roo on the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, a short distance northeast of Belize.


Understand[edit]

Mahahual used to be a quiet and friendly small fishing town off the beaten track.  However a large cruise ship docking jetty dubbed "Puerto Costa Maya" has been constructed just up the beach.  Every day a couple of cruise ships dock and the occupants are disgorged onto the town to drink, shop, swim and ride jet skis and quad bikes.  However the further south away from the cruise ship dock you go the quieter the town becomes, so it's still possible to have a quiet time of it, especially at some of the hotels south of town.
In 2007, Hurricane Dean landed just north of Mahahual. It heavily damaged the cruise ship dock and destroyed much of the small village. The village was rebuilt, cruise ships returned, and many nice hotels opened.
A new seaside malecon runs from the main road to the southern end of Mahahual Pueblo. The malecon is a pedestrian walkway with the beach to the east and businesses to the west. Many nice restaurants and shops line the Malecon. The town has several ATMs.
If you are looking for quiet tranquil beaches, away from the crowds, drive through Mahahual and continue 4 km along the coastal road. After passing the small bridge of Rio Bermejo (hardly a river, more a small stream connecting the mangrove waters with the ocean) you will find small ecological hotels, restaurants and rental houses, all beachfront. Electricity is generated with solar panels, wind mills and most of the businesses use a generator as a back up. Rain water is captured on roof decks and collected in systerns used to shower and flushing toilets.
When you arrive at km 15, there is a turn off to the right, take it to either return to Mahahual or continue to Xcalak. If you continue on the beach road, you will find lots of empty bays,only a few rental houses on the road side.

Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
From the bus stop of Bacalar and from the bus station and airport of Chetumal, ADO bus service is available to and from Mahahual twice a day. From the Chetumal airport ADO charges M$255 (April 2022). It costs less altogether to take a taxi from the airport to the Chetumal main bus station and an ADO bus from there for M$150 (April 2022).
From Chetumal Caribe buses depart from the main bus station and colectivos from the old bus station in the street Salvador Novo. In Bacalar you can join the buses and colectivos at the intercity bus stop.
If you are coming from the north like Cancun, Playa del Carmen and Tulum, check on the ADO app or website to find out if there are ADO buses serving this route. Otherwise go to an ADO bus station and ask at the ticket counter whether there are second class buses for that route. And you could ask your accommodation in Mahahuala whether there are colectivos from Limones. Then you could take a Mayab bus from Tulum, Cancun or Playa del Carmen to Limones and change there to a colectivo to Mahahual.

By tour[edit]
Organized tours are also available from a variety of companies. You will not necessarily be over run with the tourists from the cruise ships, when they leave you have this sleepy town to yourself. Things switch quickly from bustle to mellow.

By cruise ship[edit]
The 18.732808-87.6921891 cruise ship dock is in the east of the village.

Get around[edit]

Your best bet is to rent a car.  Most travelers land in Cancun. It will take over four hours but do not confuse this area with Cancun.  Four hours gets you to an entirely different world.
