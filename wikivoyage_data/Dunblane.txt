Dunblane (Gaelic: Dùn Bhlàthain) is a market and commuter town, with a population of 9410 in 2016. It's nowadays regarded as part of the city of Stirling in Stirlingshire, although historically it was in Perthshire. It grew up around its cathedral (now demoted to a parish church) and became a spa town during the 19th century, when the Dunblane Hydro Hotel was built to cathedral-like proportions. In the late 20th century good rail and road connections turned it into a commuter town, within an hour of Edinburgh and Glasgow. 
The tennis player Sir Andy Murray (born 1987) went to school in Dunblane. When he was 9 years old, during the Dunblane school massacre of 1996, he took cover in another classroom; his family knew the perpetrator. 


Understand[edit]
The Dunblane Massacre was committed by Thomas Hamilton, a 43-year-old local man. He'd been involved in youth work, and was briefly a Scout leader, but there were recurrent concerns about his sexualised behaviour with young boys so he was blacklisted. He complained bitterly to all and sundry (even to the Queen) that he was the victim of persecution by police and the Scout movement. He held, quite legally, two 9mm Browning HP pistols and two Smith & Wesson M19 .357 Magnum revolvers. At about 9:30AM on Wednesday 13 March 1996 he made his way into Dunblane Primary School, and entered the gym where a class of five-year olds were about to start a PE lesson. He began firing rapidly. Over the next four minutes 32 were shot; 15 children and the PE teacher died. Hamilton then shot himself.
