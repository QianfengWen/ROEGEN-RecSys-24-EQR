Understand[edit]
The Brookfields are a collection of 5 small towns in Central Massachusetts East, North, and West Brookfield were part of Brookfield as was most of Warren when the area was known as Quaboag Plantation.  Brookfield was settled by Europeans in 1660, but most of the town was destroyed in 1675 during King Philip's war, causing it to lay abandoned for nearly 12 years afterward.  The Knox Artillery Train passed through in 1776, bringing the cannons that helped end the siege of Boston.  This is commemorated by a marker on Route 9.  North Brookfield split off in 1812, West Brookfield in 1848, and East Brookfield in 1920.  East Brookfield is the newest town in Massachusetts by date of incorporation.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The Brookfields are not well connected to any major highways, making them harder to get to than most destinations in Massachusetts.  From east or west, you can use MA Route 9 to reach the area.  From Boston to Worcester, Route 9 is a major highway, but west of Worcester it becomes a simple country road.  From north or south you can use Route 67 and Route 148, both of which are also country roads.  Coming from the east, you should take I-90 to the Sturbridge Exit and use Route 20 to get to Route 148 and head north into the Brookfields.  Coming from the west, you should take I-90 to the Palmer Exit and take Route 20 east to Route 67 and head north.

Get around[edit]
By car[edit]
The Brookfields are very spread out and rural.  You will need a car to get around.  Route 9 runs east-west through East Brookfield, Brookfield, and West Brookfield.  From Brookfield, you can use Route 148 to get to North Brookfield.  Route 67 will take you to Warren from West Brookfield.  Depending upon where you are, there may be a back road that will get you to your next point of interest faster than any of these.

See[edit]
The Brookfields are all about subtle, natural scenery.  There are a few small art galleries to see, but the primary sight to see is the rolling countryside, which provides a refreshing break from the densely populated rest of Southern New England.  Driving along the main roads will provide plenty of scenery to take in, but for the best chance of taking in that classic rural New England vista, pick a back road to explore.  Like the rest of New England, the Brookfields are stunning in the autumn and are one of the few places to take in a mostly undisturbed countryside without having to drive all the way to Vermont or northern New Hampshire.
