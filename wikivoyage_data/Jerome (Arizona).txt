Jerome's Hotel Connor
Jerome is an old copper mining town in Northern Arizona, once a ghost town in the 1950s, now a tourist attraction and artist colony, with a reputation for many buildings being haunted.


Understand[edit]
Jerome is an old copper mining town set on the steep slopes of Cleopatra Hill between Prescott and Sedona. Once the fourth largest city in Arizona, it became one of the West's largest ghost towns in the 1950s. Now designated a National Historic District, the town has gained new life as an artist colony and tourist attraction.

History[edit]
Once known as the "Wickedest Town in the West", Jerome owes its existence to two ore bodies that pushed close to the surface near Jerome and drew early settlers and miners.
Two mines opened up - the first in the late 19th century, the second in 1917. While known mostly for copper, other metals including gold, silver, lead and zinc were mined.
A narrow gauge railway connected Jerome to Jerome Junction, a railway transfer point 27 mi (43 km) to the west. Over the years mining expanded, the mine becoming the leading copper producer in the state and the population of Jerome growing ten-fold from 1890 (250 persons) to 1900 (2,500 persons).
Four fires between 1894 and 1898 destroyed much of the business district and half the homes, and in 1899 Jerome incorporated as a town making it possible to collect taxes to build a formal fire-fighting system and establish building codes to prohibit tents and other fire hazards within the town limits.
Mine production had always fluctuated, with boom and bust cycles from World War I to the Great Depression. Today the mines are silent: they closed for good in 1953 when the ore deposits ran out. The population dwindled to fewer than 100 persons in the mid-1950s, becoming a ghost down (down from 4,900 in 1920 at its peak, to 1,200 in 1950).
Residents turned to tourism and retail sales, putting Jerome back on the map as a National Historic Landmark in 1967.
