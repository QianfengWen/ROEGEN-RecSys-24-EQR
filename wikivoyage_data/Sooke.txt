Cope[edit]
The nearest hospital is in Victoria.
Go next[edit]
Your only real options are to drive west along Highway 14 to explore the Juan de Fuca beaches and Port Renfrew, or head back to Victoria.
However, the Galloping Goose Trail, a hiking and biking trail between Victoria and Sooke, passes near the town.  Two convenient access points are the 48.39547-123.659535 Ludlow Rd Parking Lot and the 48.40573-123.703826 Sooke River Rd Parking Lot.
If you have a couple of days and want a coastal hike, consider the Juan de Fuca Marine Trail which runs between Port Renfrew and Jordan River.  Unlike the longer West Coast Trail, the Juan de Fuca Trail has fewer logistical challenges and has several access trails along the route so it is possible to complete the whole distance or do shorter day trips as time or weather dictates.
