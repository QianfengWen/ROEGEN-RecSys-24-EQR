History[edit]
Before colonization, the area was home to a First Nations (Indigenous) community called the Attawandaron who lived in longhouses surrounded by fields of corn. The majority of this nation, about 4,000 people, lived in a village near what is now the Badenoch area of Puslinch, near Morriston.
John Galt, the first Superintendent of the Canada Company, was hired to help colonize Upper Canada. He selected Guelph as the headquarters of this British development firm. Galt was a popular Scottish poet and novelist who also designed the town to attract settlers and farmers to the surrounding countryside. His design intended the town to resemble a European city centre, complete with squares, broad main streets and narrow side streets, resulting in a variety of block sizes and shapes which are still in place today. The street plan was laid out in a radial street and grid system that branches out from downtown.
The town was named to honour Britain's royal family, the Hanoverians, who were descended from the Guelfs, the ancestral family of George IV, the reigning British monarch; thus the nickname "the Royal City".
In 1827, the first houses and the first Guelph Farmers' Market were built. The population growth was very slow until the Grand Trunk Railway reached it from Toronto, en route to Sarnia, in 1856; the town was also served soon thereafter by the Great Western Railway branch from Harrisburg.
Guelph was home to a major correctional institution from 1915 until 2001, the Ontario Reformatory, after 1972, Guelph Correctional Centre.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
From Highway 401:

Take exit 295, Highway 6 North, the Hanlon Expressway; for downtown, exit at Wellington St., to Wyndham; for University of Guelph, exit at Stone Road, or College Road to Gordon St.
Alternately, take exit 299, Brock Rd. (also known as "old Highway 6") north through the village of Aberfoyle, becomes Gordon St at the Guelph city limits.  The University of Guelph will be on your right after Stone Rd.; Gordon Street becomes Norfolk St. in downtown Guelph.  This route is more direct and more scenic; however, it's slower than taking the Hanlon.
From Highway 6, Hamilton and Niagara, alternatively continue through the village of Morriston; then, either take Highway 401 West to exit 295, or take Brock Rd. north as above.
Two other surface highways run through Guelph — Highway 7, that links Guelph with Kitchener-Waterloo and Stratford in the west and Brampton and the GTA in the east, and Wellington Street/Eramosa Road (formerly Highway 24), which links Guelph with Brantford and Cambridge in the south and Erin and Caledon in the north.
