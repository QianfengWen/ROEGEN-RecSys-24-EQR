Do[edit]
Klein-Winternheim is a village whose recorded history dates to April 1100. The region's economy was dominated by wine-growing for a long time. Nowadays many people live in Klein-Winternheim because it's close to the state capital, Mainz. It has a few shops, bakery and ice cream cafe. There are two retail areas, one off Oppenheimer Street near the rail station, the larger to the west of the autobahn exit 4.
