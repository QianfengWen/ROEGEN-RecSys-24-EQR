Richard Wagner's Festival Theater (Festspielhaus) in Bayreuth
For the city in Lebanon, see Beirut.
The festival city of Bayreuth in Upper Franconia (Oberfranken) is relatively quiet most of the year until the Richard Wagner Festival settles in for 30 days every summer.  Bayreuth features a wealth of impressive baroque and rococo architecture, as well as freshly-brewed Franconian beer in the local Biergartens.  Although the city remains fairly tame compared to the much larger cities in Germany, the presence of more than 10,000 students at the University of Bayreuth means an active nightlife is not difficult to find.


Understand[edit]
Bayreuth is famous in Germany as the host of the Richard Wagner Festival (Festspiele) each year from July to August. In that respect, most of the tourist industry has evolved around the life and times of Richard Wagner as well as Margravine Wilhelmine, one of the major contributors in bringing the arts to Bayreuth. For most of the year, Bayreuth is quiet, somewhat out of the way of the major tourist itineraries. However, during the Festspiele, the town fills to capacity; hotels are nearly impossible to book and at certain times the traffic in some areas almost slows to a stop.

History[edit]
The town of Bayreuth emerged during the Middle Ages, with a street market in the centre of town. In its early history, Bayreuth was only a small village in the widespread  Hohenzollern holdings and suffered many plagues and wars. The town was completely destroyed during the Hussite war in 1430, suffered major plagues even until 1602, and incurred major damage by fires in 1605 and 1621. Margrave Christian from Kulmbach moved his residence here in 1603, and after the Thirty Years' War the town began to develop as a more important city with more distinct baroque architecture.

When Margrave Friedrich married Wilhelmine, the sister of King Frederick II of Prussia, Bayreuth began to develop its current appearance. Margravine Wilhelmine was an active lover of the arts and architecture. She commissioned famous Italian architects to design the Margravial Operahouse (a UNESCO world heritage site), which was the largest in Germany for over a century. It still stands today as one of the most ornate baroque opera houses in the world. In addition, Wilhelmine expanded the Margrave's summer residence and gardens and commissioned the architecturally impressive New Palace. During the reign of Friedrich and Wilhelmine, the arts flourished in Bayreuth.
In 1872, the magnificent opera house even attracted composer Richard Wagner to Bayreuth, who from then on lived there until his death 11 years later. Ironically, Wagner's works were never played in that opera house. Instead, the Festspielhaus, a new opera house was purpose-built on the "green hill" above the city, bankrolled by King Ludwig II of Bavaria. Since then the city has had an integral relationship with Richard Wagner. The Richard Wagner Festival started in 1876 to commemorate and perform the works of the famous composer. During the Nazi era, Hitler considered Bayreuth one of the most important cultural centres in Germany, and as such, Bayreuth was bombed during World War II, though much less heavily than, for example, Nuremberg. In the last half century, Bayreuth has rebuilt, continued the Richard Wagner Festival and grown quietly, mostly around the University, which was established in 1975.

Orientation[edit]
49°54′0″N 11°34′33″ERural district and City of Bayreuth


The City of Bayreuth (Kreisfreie Stadt Bayreuth) lies as an enclave in the much larger rural district of Bayreuth (Landkreis Bayreuth). They are at the same level of administrative hierarchy and governed independently. The rural Landkreis contains many small towns and villages that are worth a visit. It covers parts of the Franconian Switzerland in the southwest and the Fichtelgebirge in the northeast, with the city right in-between. The historic centre of the city lies to the south of the Red Main (Roter Main), a small river which will eventually discharge into the Rhine.
The 49.9450611.57811 Tourist Information office provides lots of very detailed information. It is at Opernstraße 22, near the Margravial Opera House (office hours M-F 09:00-21:00 & Sa 09:00-16:00 year-round, also Su 10:00-14:00 May - Oct). It offers a two-hour city tour (in German) daily at 10:30 (only Saturdays from Nov-Apr) for €6.50. The meeting point is the TI office. The TI office also provides city maps and city/regional maps for bicyclists, some of them are also available online.
If you plan to start a career or the next step of your life in Bayreuth, the Welcome Service offers all kinds of information and support (check the German version of their website for more information).

Climate[edit]
Winter is normally overcast and wet, with temperatures not deviating too far from freezing. The springtime can be relatively cool, but the weather slowly becomes more pleasant and is welcomed by numerous street fairs and festivals (See Events). Summer is also pleasant, punctuated by occasional hot days. During the warmer seasons, outdoor cafes and Biergartens abound in the cobblestoned city centre.

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
The Hauptbahnhof (main train station)
While there are no long-distance trains stopping in Bayreuth, frequent regional train services connect Bayreuth to other regions of Franconia and Northern Bavaria. Bayreuth is part of the VGN network and within that region bus and train day tickets covering large areas are relatively inexpensive. To get you to and from say Nuremberg you would have to pay only €18 for a group of up to 2 adults and 4 kids (under 18 years old). The Bayern ticket is also a cheap option for groups up to five (no age restrictions) starting at €23 for one person and €3 for every additional one. Regular services exist seven days a week to and from:

Nuremberg – Regional-Express (RE) trains once an hour (66 minutes travel time).  Many times these trains separate en route, so make certain to board the correct train segment.
Dresden – change in Hof (usually same platform, the train you change to goes on to Nuremberg)
Bamberg – Direct RE trains every two hours (travel time 1½ hours), otherwise a change in Lichtenfels is necessary. Note that a part of this connection (between Burgkunststadt and Ramsenthal) is not part of the VGN network, so their day tickets are not valid on that segment. You'll have to either buy a separate ticket for that segment, get a normal single-trip Bamberg–Bayreuth ticket or just use the Bayern ticket instead.
49.94983111.5798171 Bayreuth railway station (Bayreuth Hauptbahnhof), Bahnhofsstraße, 20 (1 km north of the city centre, easily accessed by foot. Buses also run from the train station to the central bus station (ZOH) in the town centre.).   (updated Jul 2023)
On foot[edit]
The central bus station (ZOH) is where all local bus routes meet
Several hiking trails go through Bayreuth. Some of them are themed around a special topic (e.g. Jean Paul, a local author, or a beer-themed trail)

By car[edit]
Bayreuth is well connected to the German autobahn network. Along the A 9 that connects Munich in the south with Berlin in the north, Bayreuth lies approximately 70 km north of Nuremberg and 40 km south of Hof. The northern exit Bayreuth-Nord (No. 41) can be a bit confusing especially when you're coming from the north, and if you're not careful you may end up in the industrial district rather than going south towards the city centre. That area is a maze of one-way streets, but luckily it is not too large. Keep calm and follow the signs to either Stadtmitte or Rotmain Center (it really does not matter) and you'll be back on the right track very soon. The southern exit Bayreuth Süd (No. 42) is much easier to tackle.
Coming from the west, the A 70 meets the A 9 a couple of kilometres north of the city. In most cases, you'll want to take exit No. 24 (Kulmbach/Neudrossenfeld) and then follow the B 85 towards Bayreuth.

By plane[edit]
The nearest airport with regular commercial service is in Nuremberg (NUE IATA). Many international flights arrive in Germany via Frankfurt airport (FRA IATA) or Munich airport (MUC IATA), however.

49.98442811.6385692 Airport Bayreuth (BYU  IATA, ICAO: EDQD), north-east of the city. Bayreuth's airport is primarily used for air sports, business flights and other forms of general aviation. Regular opening hours are daily 06:30–18:00 in summer, with reduced hours in winter (otherwise PPR). It offers a 1034 x 30 m asphalt runway and equipment for approaches following instrument flight rules. Customs and immigration services are only available on prior (48 hr) request.   (updated Feb 2019)
By bus[edit]
Several companies serve domestic long distance lines to and from Bayreuth. Intercity buses do not stop at the central bus station (ZOH); most of them stop at the 49.9511611.578033 Goethestraße bus stop instead, where you'll find connections to several regional buses. Local buses, however, don't stop there, so in most cases you'll have to walk around the block towards the main train station (Hbf), where you'll have access to several city bus lines as well as plenty of taxis. Some Intercity buses also stop at the University (stop Mensa), which is connected to the city centre through the local bus routes 304, 306 and 316. Some routes also have a stop at nearby Autobahn-adjacent parking lots, from where you'd have to arrange pickup.
If you are travelling in a group and your destination or point of departure is within the Bundesland of Bavaria taking the "Bayern-Ticket" may well work out cheaper than the bus, however.

Get around[edit]
49°56′36″N 11°34′33″EMap of Bayreuth


On foot[edit]
Bayreuth is a very walk-able city, as the terrain is flat and distances are short. Most sights of interest are easily reached by foot within the city. Exceptions to this are the Festspielhaus, the Eremitage, and Fantaisie – all of which are easily accessed by bus or bike. Most of the extensive pedestrian zones in the city centre around the Maximilianstraße are paved with flat natural sett stones or large pavers, which make for pretty comfortable walking compared to the medieval cobble stone you may find elsewhere. Unless there's some kind of really popular event going on at the market square, even on the busiest summer days the streets never really get over-crowded. Be aware that biking is allowed pretty much everywhere in the pedestrian zones, and that the residents make heavy use of that.

By bus[edit]
The bus network around Bayreuth provides extensive coverage of the city and surrounding areas, with most buses running in 20-minute intervals. The 49.94611811.5739124 central bus stop (named ZOH for Zentrale Omnibus Haltestelle, not ZOB as in most other places in Germany) is one block north of Maximilianstraße near the city hall (Rathaus). As Bayreuth is a member of the VGN tariff union schedules and rates are available at their website. Bus maps and time tables are also available at the website of the Stadtwerke Bayreuth. Day passes (Tageskarte) are available. In the evening and on weekends some routes are served on request only. The connections are then marked Alt (for Anruf-Linien-Taxi) on the schedules and you will have to call ☏ +49 921 20208 to request the bus at least 30 minutes in advance.

By bike[edit]
Biking is easy and convenient in Bayreuth and likely the best way to get around. Riding your bike in pedestrian zones is allowed virtually anywhere, but remember that pedestrians have priority. Outside of the city, many scenic bike paths radiate from Bayreuth into the surrounding areas. Between May and October, E-bikes can be rented from the Tourist Information office for €25 per day (plus a €120 security deposit you'll get back when you return the bike).

By car[edit]
Compared to larger cities, Bayreuth is relatively easy to tackle by car. The Hohenzollernring, Wittelsbacherring and Cosima-Wagner-Straße together form the central ring around the innermost core of the city. The inside of that ring is in large parts pedestrian-only and can be a bit tricky to navigate, so it's not a bad idea to avoid the area.

Parking[edit]
Finding a place to park your vehicle is not much of a problem as long as you're willing to pay. Unless your accommodation offers free parking, one of the commercial parking garages is probably the best choice. There are several of them in close proximity to the city centre – P7 and P8 even require you to drive a few metres through the pedestrian zone. Those two are at the more expensive end of the €0.80–2.00/hr price range, though. The 49.9459811.582315 P1 parking garage at the Oberfankenhalle and the 49.9466311.569356 Rotmain Center parking facilities tend to be among the least expensive options. Roadside parking spots in and around the core city are typically limited to a maximum stay of two hours and require you to either get a ticket at one of the vending machines or use the easy park smartphone app. Further out in the residential areas, you may be able to find a spot that's free of charge, but be aware that these are often either limited to 2 hr or residents only. Do not be tempted to try your luck on the customers' parking lots of super markets and other stores: most of them have put third party companies in charge of their parking facilities and those will charge you a hefty fine if you misuse them.
Free of charge parking is possible, though, albeit typically a bit less convenient. There's a large 49.93252611.5863097 free parking lot in the Frankengutstraße near the public swimming pool. If you arrive in the later afternoon/evening (or your stay falls into the summer/winter breaks), you are almost guaranteed to find a free parking spot on the University campus. There's another 49.94476511.5932288 free parking lot at the corner of Friedrich-Ebert-Straße and Grünewaldstraße and even more free parking on the opposite side of the river. 49.96233811.5787429 Parking at the Festival Theatre is also free, at least outside the festival season.

Rental cars[edit]
There are only three companies offering rental cars in Bayreuth: Avis in the Nürnbergerstraße east of the University, Europcar in the Albrecht-Dürer-Straße just north-east of the city centre, and Sixt far in the North near the Autobahn in the Bernecker Straße.

By taxi[edit]
Like in most German cities of this size, taxis in Bayreuth are expensive and rare – don't waste your time trying to hail one on the street. There are almost 20 taxi companies located in the city, but which one you choose does not really matter: they all follow the same pricing scheme (available in German here). Several of the companies cooperate in the Taxi Union Bayreuth with a shared 24/7 telephone hotline (☏ +49 921 22 333 and ☏ +49 921 24 088). Otherwise, you can usually find a taxi at the train station or at the 49.9452411.57361210 taxi stand at the market square near Karstadt.

See[edit]
Major attractions[edit]
Most attractions in Bayreuth hail from the residence of Margravine Wilhelmine and her husband Margrave Friedrich. A diligent supporter of the arts and culture, Wilhelmine brought Italian architects and French builders to construct many of the town's historical landmarks. As such, much of the architecture reflects heavy baroque and rococo influences.

The spiral staircase in the tower features a ramp to bring supplies up to the guardroom, which has a great view over the town and to the nearby Fichtelgebirge. €1.

Urban art[edit]
Street art is everywhere
There's more to Bayreuth than Wagner, the opera, and carved sandstone. The city is stuffed to the brim with contemporary art. If you're into sculptures, check out the Skulpturenmeile, or just take a stroll around the university campus.
Since the beginnings in the 1980s, Bayreuth has developed a very active legal graffiti scene. For several decades, the city has now been occasionally dedicating walls for legal spraying, and after the last couple of elections they left the election poster boards up for a while to serve as a public canvas. Several companies have also started offering some of their walls, or even commissioning works. A good place to get into this is right in the city center along the river, downstream from the railway bridge.

Do[edit]
With its wide pedestrian streets, the city centre is easy to stroll, and provides a pleasant contrast to many other South German towns loaded with medieval architecture. During the summer many cafes and ice cream parlors set up outdoor seating on the main shopping streets, Maximilianstraße, Sophienstraße, and Von-Römer-Straße. As with any town in Bierfranken (compare Breweries in Franconia), trying some of the local brews is a must. The default beer in most pubs is some sort of pale lager (Helles), but the real specialities are the darker ones – look out for Zwickl, Zoigl, Kellerbier or Dunkles on the menu. Interestingly, Bayreuth's largest brewery is best known across Germany for their wheat beer Maisel's Weisse: This style of beer is very common in Bavaria proper ("Altbayern"), but wouldn't normally be considered a typical Franconian thing. Nightlife is not the thing Bayreuth is famous for, at least as far as clubbing and dancing goes. A really good place for concerts and parties is the Glashaus on the university campus, while a few good pubs can be found near the city centre.
When travelling in summer, make sure not to miss the beautiful Theta beergarden. It is in the hills above Bayreuth and it's hard to get there. But even taking a taxi would be worth it. For active people it is possible to do a very nice hike here from the Festspielhaus. This would also give you the opportunity to climb the old Siegesturm (= victory tower), which provides a scenic view over (almost) the whole city (free, closed in winter).
Catch a movie at the 7-screen Cineplex near the Rotmain-Center (see the Buy section). Movies are mostly screened in German, but some blockbusters are also shown with original sound – look out for the ones marked OV (original version) or OMU (original with German subtitles).

Sports[edit]
Good spots for recreational running are the Röhrensee park and the Studentenwald forest that attaches to it in the south, as well as the Wilhelminenaue park in the north-east of the city.
If you prefer watching other people doing the work, Medi Bayreuth plays in Germany's top division for basketball. Their home matches take place in the 49.944411.5851 Oberfrankenhalle , which is part of the sports park just north of the city centre. The close by 49.94527811.5869442 Hans-Walter-Wild-Stadion  is home of the local soccer team SpVgg Bayreuth.

Swimming and sauna[edit]
The Kreuzsteinbad before opening in spring.
Bayreuth has quite a lot to offer in terms of swimming, sweating and splashing water. In the summer, a visit to the Kreuzsteinbad is a no-brainer even if (or: especially when) you're low on cash. In the winter, this role is filled by the Stadtbad. The Lohengrin Therme caters more to the opposite end of the spectrum and is a good choice for those who are willing to pay for exclusive treatments. And if you're travelling with children the Therme Obernsees might be just what you're looking for.

49.93438611.5847883 Kreuzsteinbad (Kreuzer), Universitätsstraße 20-24, 95447 (between the city centre and the university. Entrance and parking lots are at the Frankengutstraße), ☏ +49 921 60 03 84, kreuzsteinbad@stadtwerke-bayreuth.de. May to Sep: daily 07:00–20:00. The Kreuzsteinbad is a classic outdoor swimming pool as you may find it in any German town. Nothing fancy, but dearly loved by residents, university students and travellers alike, not only because of the incredibly low entrance fees. It has been modernized and features a 50 m competition pool for serious swimming, a wave pool, diving tower, water slide and a children's pool. There's a playground for children and courts for playing beach volleyball, basket ball, football and badminton, but also plenty of lawn to enjoy some lazy time in the sun. Bringing your own food and drinks is allowed (no glass bottles, though!) – and probably a good idea unless you want to survive the day on fries and ice cream. If you want to use the lockers you'll have to bring your own padlock or borrow one from the front desk (for a deposit of €10). If you plan to only spend a few hours, consider coming after 17:00, as entrance fees will be even cheaper then! Grown-up whole-day ticket: €4.30.  (updated Aug 2018)
49.94709111.5795394 Stadtbad, Kolpingstraße 7, 95444 (just north of the city centre: cross the river at Annecyplatz and immediately turn right.), ☏ +49 921 600 382, stadtbad@stadtwerke-bayreuth.de.

The sauna and the spa are clothes-free zones, towels and bathing gowns can be rented for €2 and €4, respectively. Children younger than 6 are not allowed in any section. The spa has an additional minimum age of 14 and is ladies-only on Tuesdays (except holidays). From €9 for 2 hours in the thermal baths to €21 for a day pass including sauna. (updated Aug 2018)
49.94522711.5837376 SBV-Hallenbad, Am Sportpark 5, 95448 (just north of the city centre, between the P3 parking garage and the ice stadium), ☏ +49 921 986 14. M 13:00-21:30, Tu-F 06:30-08:00 (swimming only, no sauna) and 13:00-21:30, Sa 08:00-18:00, Su 09:00-13:00. Probably your best choice if you're into some serious swimming, the SBV-Hallenbad offers a 50 m competition pool and a 5 m diving tower. There's also a variable-depth (30-120 cm) pool for babies and toddlers and a steam bath. The sauna (not included in the normal entrance fee) is women-only on Mondays (mixed after 18:00) and Wednesdays, men-only on Tuesdays (mixed after 18:00) and Thursdays and mixed on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. Adults pay €4 for swimming only and €11 for swimming and sauna (no time limits). (updated Aug 2018)
49.91537411.3784787 Therme Obernsees, An der Therme 1, 95490 Mistelgau (follow the B22 and St2186 west towards Obernsees or take bus #376), ☏ +49 9206 99300-0, toll-free: +49 9206 99300-10, info@therme-obernsees.de. May-September: M-Sa 09:00-21:00 (sauna until 22:00), Su 09:00-20:00, October-April: daily 09:00-22:00 (sauna until 23:00 on F Sa). A bit outside the core city (but still within the Landkreis Bayreuth) lie the Obernsees thermal baths. If you prefer the sporty side of swimming this may not quite be your cup of tea, but pretty much everyone else should find something here. There are plenty of options for fun and relaxation, indoors and outdoors: pools, water jets, slides, and more than half a dozen different saunas. Obernsees is a good destination for a bike tour, as the bike path along the former railway line between Bayreuth and Hollfeld passes right through it. Adults pay between €10 for 2 hours and €15.50 for a day pass, sauna is an additional €5. (updated Aug 2018)
Events[edit]
11.57349.9451 Africa-Caribbean-Festival (Afrika-Karibik-Festival): annually, ☏ +49 162 1975253.  For four days each summer, the air in the pedestrian zone in the city centre is filled with decidedly non-local rhythms and scents. African culture is one major focus of the University of Bayreuth, and the festival is the ideal opportunity for everyone to experience some of that first hand. The market offers contemporary arts and craft (as well as the occasional Bob Marley T-shirt) and more than 50 food stands with delicious snacks and meals from different regions. Free.
49.9597411.579532 Bayreuth Festival (Bayreuther Festspiele, Richard Wagner Festival): July –  August annually, Festspielhügel 1-2 (Bus 305 to Am Festspielhaus), ☏ +49 921 7 87 80.  If there's one thing Bayreuth is famous for, this is it: the annual performance of Richard Wagner's operas in the Festspielhaus. During the festival, huge crowds flock to Bayreuth for a chance to see the performances. Getting tickets has gotten much easier lately: If you order by mail you still may have to wait for a couple of years, but if you buy online chances of getting lucky are much higher. Tickets are being sold through the Festival's website in batches over the year on a first come first served basis. The last batch (the ones that have been returned or not been paid for) is typically sold around the end of June, so there's a chance for getting last minute tickets if you keep a close eye on the online shop. €30-320, depending on the seat and what's being played. 
11.57349.9453 Citizens Festival (Bürgerfest): first weekend in July annually, ☏ +49 921 885 737, veranstaltungen@bayreuth-tourismus.de.  For one weekend every July, almost the whole city centre around the market square turns into one big festival zone when the citizens of Bayreuth celebrate themselves and the city they live in. All kinds of music are played from several stages of different sizes that are scattered around the area. There's food and drinks everywhere, and whilethe evenings can get pretty wild, the Sunday is all about families and the arts market. Free.

The Volksfest is another classic Bayreuth event that has been visited by generations (2019 was its 110th incarnation). Not unlike Munich's famous Oktoberfest, it is a bit of a cross-over between a traditional folk festival and a modern fun fair. Free.
 Jazz-November: November annually, info@jazz-bayreuth.de.  The Jazz-November takes place on the weekend after the fall school holidays. Over four days (starting on Thursday), the Jazzforum Bayreuth hosts a series of concerts featuring a fine selection of big names from the international jazz scene, hidden gems and hot newcomers. Locations vary accordingly, ranging from intimate concerts in cozy bars to dance parties in a classic 1980s night club atmosphere.
49.94744711.5657465 Wheat Beer Festival (Maisel's Weissbierfest): Every year in April or May, Hindenburgstr. 9.  Since 1987, each year the Maisel's brewery hosts their Wheat Beer Festival. It usually starts on a Thursday and culminates in a free concert with an internationally known headliner on Saturday. Over the past couple of years, Rock and Pop performers such as Kim Wilde, Status Quo, Kool & The Gang, James Harvest Barclay or ELO have played there. The Sunday is all about sports – anyone can participate in the Fun Run through the city, although you'd have to register for that well in advance. Free.

Eat[edit]
The traditional pair of Bayreuther Bratwürste in a bread roll, as sold around the city centre
Bayreuth's status as a university city means that a wide variety of restaurants populate the city, including typical Franconian Wirtshäuser, pizza parlors and Asian cuisine (including specifically Chinese, Japanese, and Thai), as well as the normal fast food fare in the train station and along the pedestrian streets. Small food stands (Imbiss) dot the pedestrian areas and offer quick hot meals for those in a rush (the traditional Franconian choice would be a pair of Bayreuther Bratwürste). If you're looking for halal food, the numerous Döner places around the city centre are your safest bet. Most of the hotels listed below also have an attached restaurant or Biergarten, open for anyone to visit. Listed below is a small sampling of the restaurants in Bayreuth. For more options, check the drink section below, ask around, or just take a stroll through the city.

Drink[edit]
The city centre of Bayreuth has plenty of options for having a pint. Most of them fall into the pub or Wirtshaus categories, though, as the city lost its main dance hall, the (in)famous Rosenau, to a fire in 2017. Below is a list of some of the most well-established places, but don't hesitate to just take a walk around the city and see where that leads you.

49.9433111.5696521 Dubliner Irish Pub, Wittelsbacherring 2, ☏ +49 921-512630. M–Th from 19:00, F Sa from 18:00 (open end). Bayreuth's Irish Pub, featuring Irish beer, British cider, a large selection of whisk(e)y (ask for specialities not on the menu) and even some Irish Stew. Occasional live music. (updated May 2023)
49.9444211.571772 Rosa Rosa, Von-Römer-Str. 2, ☏ +49 921-68502. A cozy pub serving local brews and good food specials. Get there early as the seats normally fill up quickly.

In a renovated part of the old Maisel's brewery building, the Liebesbier offers a huge selection of regional and international craft beer. It's a bit on the pricey side, but the excellent food and rustic-modern atmosphere easily make up for that. (updated Apr 2016)
49.94380811.5749054 Kanapee, Maximilianstr. 29 (in a passage between Maximilianstr. and Brautgasse, look for "Miss Vietnam" restaurant), ☏ +49 171 8615790. 20:00-05:00. The infamous Kanapee is one of the pillars of Bayreuth's nightlife. It's not pretty or anything, but it's inexpensive and open late. Truth being told, you probably won't go there on purpose unless you're looking for a place that plays Rock and Metal. But you may well end up there early in the morning when everything else is closed but you still haven't had enough. Beer from €2.60. (updated Sep 2019)
Clubs and Bars[edit]
49.9292811.5815 Glashaus (on the university campus, between the "Geowissenschaften" building and the bus stop of the same name), ☏ +49 921-552198. Run entirely by volunteer university students, the Glashaus is the cultural heart of the campus. During the semester, it is the perfect spot for an afternoon-study break with a mug of fair-trade coffee or tea. In the evening, it turns into a popular location for a wide variety of cultural (an not so cultural) events: concerts (from electro to metal, from reggae to punk), open mic sessions, movies, readings, talks, poetry- and science-slams. You will have to become a member to take part, but that's really just a formality (and a small fee). Membership fee is €1 for a single month, entrance fees depend on the event (may be free). (updated Jun 2020)
49.9435711.569076 Fabrik, Erlangerstr. 2 (just outside the city centre where the Erlangerstraße meets the Wittelsbacherring, across the street from the "Dubliner"), ☏ +49 921 79 32 77 17, info@fabrik-bayreuth.com. F Sa 23:00-05:00. Bayreuth's main dance club and your number one address for electronic music. Entrance fee varies. (updated May 2023)

A classic discothèque, the San Francisco looks a bit like time has been standing still since the 1970s. This is not your average modern dance hall – in fact the average local twenty-something might not even know it exists. But if you're into actual dancing (fox, swing, salsa …), this might well be the oasis you've been looking for. Each night stands under some kind theme like "Fox Dance Night", "Karaoke Night" or "Classic Rock & Beat Party". (updated May 2003)
49.9435511.579028 Trichter, Badstraße 6, ☏ +49 921 65000, Trichterbayreuth@outlook.de. Opens Tu-Su 20:00, M 17:00. (updated May 2023)
Beer gardens[edit]
The Storchenkeller in the evening.
There are plenty of beer gardens in Bayreuth, some more authentic than others. Many restaurants have attached outdoor seating areas dubbed "Biergarten", but you probably won't get the real deal there. In the beer gardens listed below, however, you will get exactly that – which of course also means that most likely you'll have to get up and walk over to the counter to get your beer! Prices in this section are given for what you'll get when you simply order a beer (which usually results in a Seidla (0.5 L mug) of Helles).

49.94179311.5752929 Vogels Biergarten (Lamperie), Friedrichstr. 13 (enter the gateway next to "Lamperie" and keep walking until you're below the trees), ☏ +49 921 50 70 94 26, info@lamperie.de. April to October: daily from 16:00, if weather permits. Located right in the core of the city behind the pub Lamperie, the Vogels Biergarten is a great choice in the summer. The traditional large conker trees provide some shade and atmosphere when you enjoy a local beer from the Maisel's brewery or a crispy Flammkuchen straight from the oven. Beer: €3.10. (updated Aug 2018)
49.9487611.5630210 Herzogkeller, Hindenburgstr. 9 (outside the city centre, just past the brewery), ☏ +49 921-4 34 19. Daily from 16:00, closed during the winter season. Bayreuth's largest Biergarten dates back until 1889. Was built as the Bierkeller of the Bayreuther Bierbrauerei, which today is part of the Maisel's group. Beer €2.90. (updated Aug 2018)
49.98511711.55828211 Auf der Theta, Hochtheta 6, 95463 Bindlach (go for a hike northwards through the forest from the Festival Theatre.), ☏ +49 920 865361. Th F 13:00–21:00, Sa 11:30–21:00, Su PH 11:30–20:00. Closed Jan to mid-Mar and May 1st. Located in a former farm house outside town, this is about as traditional as it gets in terms of beer gardens in Bayreuth. In the summer, you'll find an interesting mixture of all kinds of people here: bikers, hikers, families, university students, suits, hippies … They have their own amber colored beer brewed for them by a local brewery not far away. Drinks and cold dishes you'll have to order and pick up yourself at the counter. The choice of hot foods depends on what time it is, what day, what season, but at least they will be brought to your table. If you don't like the heavy Franconian cuisine, maybe try the Flammkuchen or grilled fish from the black kitchen. And yes, of course you may bring your own Brotzeit instead as well. Cash only!

Sleep[edit]
Bayreuth's sleeping options are relatively reasonable in price and quality. During the Richard Wagner Festival prices can go through the roof. The Tourist Information can help you find many other smaller guest houses in and around Bayreuth. (Organized by price in each category.)

Connect[edit]
While most of the larger modern hotels offer free Wifi, this is not necessarily true for some of the smaller traditional guest houses. If you're staying in one of these and having a room with internet access is important to you, make sure to check out their website or ask in advance.
The state of Bavaria, in cooperation with Vodafone, offers free Wifi connectivity through about 350 BayernWLAN Hotspots scattered across the city. If you are a student or employee of an institution that uses Eduroam, you'll be able to use this as a safer alternative at the University and some other places around the city (see eduroam map for locations of hot spots).

Go next[edit]
Take a trip to the nearby tiny town of Aufsess, which the Guinness Book of World Records recognizes as the town with the most breweries per capita!  There's even a beer trail that you can hike with stops at all the local biergartens.
Visit Bamberg to see the medieval town and try the local smoked beer (Rauchbier).
Take an adventure in the Franconian Switzerland (Fränkische Schweiz) or Fichtelgebirge and experience the beautiful local flora, fauna, and scenery. Possible activities include hiking, mountain-climbing and canoeing.
Nuremberg is also nearby, and an easy, exciting day trip.
