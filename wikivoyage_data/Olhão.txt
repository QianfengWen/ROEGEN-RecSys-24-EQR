By boat[edit]
Armona ferry times
Culatra and Farol ferry times
37.026046-7.8337611 Porto de Olhão.  (updated Aug 2023)
There are ferries to all nearby islands; Armona, Culatra, and Farol. See the time tables to the right. Armona is more than enough for a trip.
One-way prices are:

Armona – €1.85
Culatra – €1.85
Farol – €2.15
Many tour companies in Olhão offer boat tours to the islands, with stops at restaurants, beaches and natural park. However, the schedule is very tight and the restaurants probably get a cut. So, you are better off just taking a regular ferry and selecting the beach and restaurant yourself. Do not miss the last ferry, or you will have to charter a boat for €10-20.

Beaches and islands[edit]
Ilha do Farol
Tours are often tightly organised leaving you little time to really enjoy any beaches. Also, they decide on the lunch stops, which further puts you into restrains. If you just want to enjoy the beach and stop at a restaurant on the way, simply take one of the ferries to the following islands. Mostly, they will do a larger tour and you will see the bay anyhow, not so much of the wildlife though.

Eat[edit]
The gastronomy of Olhão is bound to be mainly based around fish and seafood. The lagoons of the ilhas provide excellent nurseries for clams (amêijo), cockles (berbigão) and oysters (ostras), and the sea provides an abundance of fresh fish. Olhão was one of the first major canning areas for tuna and sardines and the fishing fleet continue to land their catches every day at the dock.
There are so many ways of preparing the fish and many of the recipes come from the fishermen. Arroz de lingueirão (razor clam risotto), lulas com favas (squid with broad beans), chocos com tinto (cuttlefish in their ink), amêijões (clams) lightly cooked in wine and garlic - the variations are endless!
Desserts are various delicious combinations of almonds, figs, eggs and oranges, whether incorporated in a feather light, moist sponge cake; figs stuffed with almonds; or little sweet marzipan cakes shaped into fruits and vegetables.

Drink[edit]
A lot of the wine sold in the Algarve comes from other parts of Portugal (for example from Bairrada in the north, Estremadura near Lisbon and Alentejo) but the Algarve does also produce its own wine, most of which comes from the Lagoa, Portimão and Tavira areas. Most restaurants will only have Portuguese wines on their wine list. The 'house' wine ("vinho da casa") in white ("branco") and red ("tinto") is nearly always a local Portuguese wine and good value. You can also opt for "vinho verde" which is a young 'green' wine, slightly sparkling, light and refreshing and goes very well with fish and chicken dishes, or rosé - Mateus rosé being the best known.

Sleep[edit]
There are numerous B&B and smaller establishments in town—best to compare prices online.
