Strandhill is a village in County Sligo, 9 km west of Sligo town on the south shore of the bay, with a population in 2016 of 1753. Its name is apt: a great expanse of strand before it and hill behind, the scarp of Knocknarea. The village grew up as a seaside resort in the early 20th century, engulfing the farm settlement of Larass, and is now a surfing resort on its west-facing beach.  


Get in[edit]
Surfing at Strandhill
See Sligo for long-distance routes. Sligo Airport is in Strandhill: it closed to commercial flights in 2011. 
Bus S2 starts from Rosses Point north across the estuary and runs through central Sligo then out west to Strandhill. It runs hourly, daily; from town is 20 min, adult fare around €3.
By car or bike follow R292, which loops off N4 to follow the peninsula coast from Balladrihid to Strandhill and back to Sligo. Tourist blurb calls this the Wild Atlantic Way.

The village is small enough to walk around, though it's quite a hike to Coney Island or up Knocknarea. With a car you can reach the start of shorter trails there, and even drive to the island. 

See[edit]
The crossing to Coney Island
54.28286-8.602361 Killaspugbrone Church. 24 hours. Scrappy ruin of a 12th century church, almost engulfed by sand dunes and unsafe to enter; the cemetery remained in use to the 1960s. The name means "Church of Bishop Brón" who was a contemporary of St Patrick, indicating a church on this site since the 6th century. The beach here is called "Nun's Beach". You have to cross the airstrip to get here but that's not a problem.   (updated Sep 2020)
54.271-8.5842 Dolly's Cottage is a picturesque thatched cottage built in 1800. It's open to visit June-Aug Sa Su 10:30-13:00, 14:00-17:00.
54.269-8.6113 Strandhill Beach is on the west-facing coast exposed to the Atlantic wind and waves. This is the place for surfing; there's nice sand but it's a bit blowy and lumpy for a family day at the seaside. Tourist literature warns against swimming here because of currents, which spares them from having to mention the sewage outflow north end of the beach.
54.261-8.6094 Culleenamore is the sheltered beach south of the golf course on Ballysadare Bay. It's a bit of a walk to reach it, but it's much better for kiddy-paddling, as it escapes the waves of Strandhill Beach and the currents of Sligo Bay. Seals haul out on the sands, and there's sometimes horse racing.
54.279-8.5525 Cummeen Strand is the start of the "Long Strand" route, the recommended way to Coney Island. It's also called Dorrin's Strand, for an island resident who unfortunately didn't pay heed to the tide times; but nowadays that's the name of the street with Dolly's Cottage so Satnav would lead you astray.
54.296-8.5886 Coney Island is a tidal island that can be reached by the 3 km crossing from Cummeen Strand. The sand is firm enough to drive across, but you'll pick up a lot of salt, consider parking up and walking. Check tide times in advance, for instance Easytide offers free predictions seven days ahead. (Pick Sligo Oyster Island as your reference port, and adjust for daylight saving time if applicable.) Set off 2-3 hours before the bottom of the tide, and be on your way back an hour after it turns. There are 14 sturdy guide markers across the sands aligned with Black Rock lighthouse, each looking like the market cross of a drowned village. The island's name means rabbits, and there are lots of them, almost as many as there are places named "Coney Island". (The one in New York was similarly infested, and probably named from the old Dutch word for rabbits.) A handful of folk live here but the island pub is closed.
Maguins Island is the small tidal island seen to the west across the sands. It can be reached by the "Short Strand" crossing from Killaspugbrone to Coney Island, but there's nothing to see there. This isn't recommended as a short cut to Coney Island as you have to splosh through a channel, which will flood before it cuts off the "Long Strand" path.
Oyster Island is in the permanent channel east of Coney Island (it's private property), and north you can make out "The Metal Man," a navigation pointer. Boats from Rosses Point sail by.
54.259-8.5757 Knocknarea is the flat-topped mountain to the south, a 327 m / 1073 ft slab of limestone. At its summit is a large cairn that's believed to date from 3000 BC and to contain a Neolithic passage tomb, and there are several smaller graves and megaliths nearby. The direct path from Strandhill is a brute, 15 km there and back, steep and muddy. The best footpath is from Primrose Grange to the southeast, see Sligo.

Buy[edit]
Centra convenience store is within the filling station, open daily 07:30-22:00.
Strandhill People's Market is on Sundays 11:00-16:00. Is this what the future looks like for all those regional airports opened in the golden age of budget flights? Did Ryanair ever tout this place as "Donegal South"? The market is within a hangar of Sligo Airport, which closed to commercial aviation in 2011 - it still handles private planes and is the base for the Coastguard search and rescue helicopter. Follow Airport Road R277 north from the village.
