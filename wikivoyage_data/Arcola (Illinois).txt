Arcola is a city in the Central Illinois region of Illinois with about 2,900 residents in 2020.  Visitors will get a sense of small-town Midwest as they walk or drive down the streets of Arcola.

Understand[edit]
Arcola is located in Douglas County, Illinois. Mostly surrounded by farmland, the town is roughly a 40-minute drive from Champaign-Urbana.

History[edit]
Arcola was founded in 1855 when the Central Illinois Railroad company built a railroad through the area. The Illinois Central Railroad Company was responsible for surveying and selling plots of land in the development of the town. 
Arcola was the birthplace of John Barton Gruelle, creator of the Raggedy Ann and Andy dolls. His family still operates the Raggedy Ann Museum in Arcola. Arcola is somewhat famous for the Lawn Rangers, a "precision lawn mower drill team" that marches in formation with brooms and lawnmowers while wearing cowboy hats. Every year since 1980 the Lawn Rangers have marched in the Arcola Broomcorn Festival Parade.
