The property was originally bought in 1801 by Joseph Greeley, and the land was later deeded to the city of Nashua in 1896 by his grandson. In 1908, John E. Cotton donated $5000, an amount that was matched by city funds, to construct a stone rest house, a fountain, a shallow pond, a gravel walk, and flower beds, thus converting the farm into a public park.  Today the park offers plays, movies and music festivals at the bandstand, and also features hiking trails, horseshoe pits, ball fields, tennis courts, a community gardening section, and a decrepit boat ramp on the Merrimack River.
