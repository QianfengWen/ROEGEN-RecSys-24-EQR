Location of Ludwigsburg in Germany
Ludwigsburg Schloss (Residenzschloss)
Ludwigsburg is a city to the north of Stuttgart in the region of Baden-Württemberg in south Germany.


Understand[edit]
Ludwigsburg is a town in Baden-Württemberg with around 85,500 residents north of Stuttgart. The town has the districts of Pflugfelden, Eglosheim, Hoheneck, Oßweil, Grünbühl, Neckarweihingen und Poppenweiler. Ludwigsburg is a very young town, in comparison to many other towns in Germany which were founded during the Roman period or earlier.
Ludwigsburg was founded in the baroque period. In 1704 the baron Eberhard Ludwig started building a small palace in the area, and one year later it was named Ludwigsburg palace. In 1709 the first housing around the palace appeared and another year later the construction of the gardens began and the palace was enlarged and completed. In 1718 the area became the new settlement of Ludwigsburg.
It is somewhat unique for having a Catholic and Protestant church opposite each other in the main square, and is home to some large stately homes.
It makes for an easy day trip from Stuttgart.
There is a significant film school, the Filmakademie Baden-Wuerttemberg that makes a significant contribution to Germany's film industry and attracts a lot of young people to this town.
