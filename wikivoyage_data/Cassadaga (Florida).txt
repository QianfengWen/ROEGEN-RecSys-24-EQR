Cassadaga is best known for having a large number of psychics and "Spiritualist Mediums", and is sometimes referred to as being the "Psychic Center of the World".
Its founder, George Colby, was led through the wilderness by three spirit guides to what is now the site of the Cassadaga Spiritualist Camp. On that site, the guides instructed him to establish  a Spiritualist Camp, which was completed in 1894. It is a place like no other, where,  Spiritualist Mediums and Spiritualist Healers can live in peace without interference from the world outside their gates.
The village sits way off Interstate 4 (you won't find it unless you're looking for it) between Orlando and Daytona Beach. 
The town is open for visitors, and attracts many thousands a year passing through.
