Christmas is a small town in Orange County, central Florida. It is located just off State Road 50, 20 miles east of Orlando en route to Kennedy Space Center, Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, and Canaveral National Seashore in Titusville.

History[edit]
Christmas was founded on Christmas Day of 1837 as a fort during the Second Seminole War, but most of the historic sites date to the early 20th century as the town grew due to settlement of eastern Orange County. The old town has been well-preserved but has chosen to remain off the beaten path and lacks chain restaurants, hotels or facilities, leading most visitors to commute from surrounding cities.
The town's proximity to the St. Johns River, a few miles to the east, and its adjacent wetlands have led to the creation of conservation and wildlife areas. The most notable of these is Orlando Wetlands Park, a natural filtration wetland which is known for its wildlife viewing opportunities.
