Waihi Beach is a small town in the western Bay of Plenty in New Zealand, north of Tauranga Harbour and near the base of Coromandel Peninsula.


Understand[edit]
Waihi Beach offers nine kilometres of sweeping white sand with one of the safest surf breaks in New Zealand.  It brings people back each summer to just relax or enjoy activities out on the water or along the coastline and bush.  There's something to suit everyone and every budget with a wide range of accommodation and dining options.

Do[edit]
 Swimming and surfing. Most of the 9 km of sandy beach is safe for swimming and offers some small surfing opportunities. The north end of the beach is the safest and the surf club operates through the summer months. If you want a break from the waves head on to ANZAC Bay down at the Bowentown end of the beach for a small sheltered bay for swimming (best at high tide but offers all day swimming). 
 Orokawa Bay Walk. This walk from the northern end of Waihi Beach leads to the beautiful pohutukawa-lined Orokawa Bay. There is a 45-minute detour to the 28-m-high William Wright Falls. Time: 1 hour 20 minute return.
