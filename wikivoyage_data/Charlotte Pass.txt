Charlotte Pass is a locality and ski resort in the Snowy Mountains of New South Wales


Get in[edit]
Winter[edit]
The road to Charlotte Pass is closed during the ski season, and the only access is by oversnow transport from Perisher Valley.  The road is closed to non-residents regardless of whether it is snow covered or clear, because the hassle of having people unable to leave after snow.  You can't park at Perisher overnight, so this really means that you have to park at the Ski-Tube at Bullocks Flat, get the Ski Tube to Perisher, and oversnow to Charlotte Pass.  It is no surprise that you can leave much of the ski crowds behind by the time you arrive.  It is possible to go for the day, and park at Perisher, but it is unusual to do so during winter.

Summer[edit]
During summer it is a pleasant drive beyond Perisher Valley to Charlotte Pass.  It can still snow occasionally, even outside of the main ski season.  It can also get very cold.  If you are driving up for a quick visit from Jindabyne or elsewhere, just leave some warm clothing in the car, or a breakdown could sometimes leave you uncomfortably cold.

Get around[edit]

It is universally best to walk the entire Charlotte Pass once you've arrived, especially in winter given you can't bring your car here anyway during snow season.

Do[edit]
Winter[edit]
Alpine skiing.  There are four lifts at Charlotte Pass, not quite the scale of the neighbouring resorts at Perisher and Thredbo.   There are runs for all levels, but if you are a green-run skier, there are only a couple of a runs available.
Lift passes are cheaper than at the big two, you can get oversnow transport and lift passes for less than the price of a lift pass elsewhere.

Summer[edit]
The area is a gateway to many of the fantastic hikes around the Kosciusko National Park, including the Mount Kosciuszko summit trails to the top of Australia. There aren't many continents in the world where you can ascend the highest mountain without any form of climbing equipment and with only an average level of fitness.  Mount Kosciusko is 2228 metres high and there is a well constructed, wide path to the top - even with toilets along the way. Most of the walk is spent getting to the base of the "mountain", and then a short uphill section, taking you to the top.  The peak itself, is really not that much higher than the surrounding country, and the other peaks that you see around you as you walk are not that much lower than Kosciuszko itself.  It is well signposted, and you will not really need any maps or emergency equipment to get there and back safely in a day during summer.  It can get close to freezing at the top though, at any time of year.
