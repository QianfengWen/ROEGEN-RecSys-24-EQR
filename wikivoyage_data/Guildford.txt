Guildford's cobbled High Street
Guildford is a large town in Surrey in the South East of England. It has retained much of its historical charm. A short walk up the cobbled high street shows many buildings which are hundreds of years old. The medieval castle was used by the King of England in the 1400s and because of this Guildford is the only royal town in Surrey.


Understand[edit]
Guildford grew up into a large town because of its location at roughly the halfway point between England's main naval port at Portsmouth and the admiralty in Greenwich, London. People travelling by horse-drawn carriage between the two would stop at inns in Guildford (such as The Angel and The Lion) to swap horses over and to refresh themselves. With the advent of the steam train in the 19th century, Guildford was no longer needed for this purpose, and it fell into decline. But as more and more people started to commute into work in London in the early 20th century, Guildford became more and more rich and popular.
Guildford is the county town of Surrey, but not the administrative centre (that is Kingston upon Thames, which is actually in a London borough). It is the economic and cultural centre of the whole of West Surrey.
Although under 30 miles away from Central London Guildford has its own individuality and is not similar to boroughs in London or other commuter towns in Surrey. Guildford is a large town with all the amenities of a city.

Visitor information[edit]

Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
Guildford is served by many bus routes from Woking, Aldershot, Godalming and other local places. Prices can be fairly expensive and buses can be unreliable particularly after 6:30PM.
The main bus station, which is the terminus for all routes heading into Guildford, is on Commercial Road (off the bottom of North Street). From here, one can pick up details about bus services and buy cheaper long term tickets.

Park and ride[edit]
Guildford has several park and ride carparks, and at the weekend they are the easiest way to get into the town centre. They are situated at Artington (on the Portsmouth Rd heading out towards Godalming, about 3 miles south of Guildford), at the Spectrum Leisure Complex, at Merrow on the A246 Epsom Road, east of Guildford, and at Onslow near to the RSCH and Surrey Sports Park, west of Guildford. At all four sites, the car parking is free and you just pay for the bus fare to get into the town centre. The park and ride system is good for the environment and also it allows the city to stay congestion free!

Onslow - buses run every 15 minutes between 7:30AM and 7PM on Mondays to Saturdays. The park and ride from Onslow costs £1.50.
Spectrum Leisure Complex – buses run every 12 minutes Mondays to Fridays from 7:27AM to 11:10PM, reduced to every 20 minutes after 7:30PM. The park and ride from the Spectrum costs £2.40 return.
Artington – buses run every 10-12 minutes from Mondays to Saturdays from 7:30AM to 7:30PM. The park and ride from Artington costs £2.20 return.
Merrow – buses run every 15 minutes between 7:30AM and 7:33PM from Mondays to Saturdays. The park and ride from Merrow costs £1.80 return.
By plane[edit]
Guildford is well served by London's collection of airports. For travellers coming directly to Guildford, the most convenient (in reducing order of convenience) are:

Heathrow Airport (LHR IATA) is about 40 minutes drive along the M25 motorway and the A3 trunk road. It is also linked directly to Woking rail station by the RailAir express bus service.
Gatwick Airport (LGW IATA) is about an hour's drive away via the M23 (northbound), M25 (clockwise) and A3 (southbound) roads. There is a through train service to Guildford from a rail station in the airport terminal complex, running twice an hour and taking less than an hour.
By train[edit]
Wikivoyage has a guide to Rail travel in Great Britain
51.237-0.581 Guildford railway station, Guildford station, Station Approach, GU1 4UT. Served by commuter and regional train services from many different directions, including two routes to London (one fast via Woking, the other slow via Cobham). The fast services continue southwards to Portsmouth. Guildford also lies on the line from Reading to Gatwick Airport; beyond Reading, services to Oxford and Birmingham may be accessed, and via Gatwick, connections to Brighton and Kent.   (updated May 2022)
From London, you should travel from London Waterloo station and catch a train whose first stop after Woking is Guildford (there are several of these an hour), the travel time will be about 35 minutes. There are also a few Portsmouth-bound trains that go non-stop to Guildford. There are other stopping services from Waterloo via Cobham, but these take so much longer that it isn't normally worth considering them.
51.2408-0.5652772 London Road (Guildford) station. There is a smaller station which is the penultimate stop on the line from London via Cobham.   (updated May 2022)
Train times can be found on the National Rail Planner or by calling ☏ +44 845-748-4950 (high cost) from anywhere in the UK.

By coach[edit]
National Express serve Guildford with express bus (UK English:coach) services from around the country including London Victoria; advanced ticketing is necessary. They serve a stop called Guildford Park Barn, which is a slightly out-of-town location near a Tesco supermarket. You will have to catch a local bus or taxi (if you can find one) to take you to Guildford.

By car[edit]
Guildford is served by the A3 trunk road which runs from London to Portsmouth. It is about an hour's drive from central London.
If you are visiting for the day by car, consider using the Park & Ride site at the Spectrum leisure complex just off the A3 southbound, Onslow just off the A3 northbound, Merrow to the east of Guildford or the site on the Old Portsmouth Road at Artington (on the way to Godalming) and catching the dedicated express bus from these locations.

By foot[edit]
The central area of Guildford is easily walkable, but hilly. From the railway station you must cross the river Wey in order to reach the town centre and the bus station.

By bus[edit]
Buses not only provide a good way of getting around the central district of Guildford itself, but are adequate for the local community. Buses are operated mainly by Arriva Kent and Surrey, Stagecoach South and Safeguard.

 Traveline, ☏ 087-608-2-608 (local rate). It provides an impartial online travel planner and telephone query service for local bus services. 
By taxi[edit]
Taxis are by far the most expensive way to get around Guildford. If you do wish to travel by taxi, there are taxi ranks at the front of the railway station, and at the bottom of North Street on the other side of the road from the Electric Theatre. You can also get taxis from various places around the city centre.
Taxis can also be booked by phone and will usually pick up from most locations within a 5-mile radius of the town centre.  Popular operators include:

5 & 6's +44 1483 565656
A-Line Cars +44 1483 564656
Beeline Cars +44 1483 566666
City Cabs +44 1483 888666
GTA Taxis 0800 502250
Surrey Cars[dead link] +44 1483 577677
By car[edit]
Whilst not as bad as either London or Oxford, Guildford's roads can get very congested at peak periods, especially at the hogs back. Especially if you are not used to driving on the left, central Guildford is probably best avoided.
On the other hand, a car is the one (possibly along with cycling) of the only really practical ways of seeing a lot of the local countryside and villages. Out here the roads are a lot quieter.

Maps[edit]
If you are planning to do any visiting or exploring beyond central Guildford, you will probably want to obtain a decent map of the area. You should ensure that any map you buy clearly shows the national grid reference lines, and explains how to use them, as grid references are frequently used to indicate out of town locations. The best maps for this purpose are those published by the Ordnance Survey (Britain's national mapping agency) and the following maps cover all the locations mentioned below:

Ordnance Survey Landranger 186. This map covers the area around and between Guildford and Aldershot at a scale of 1:50000 and is best for exploration by car or cycle.
Ordnance Survey Explorer 145. This map covers the area around Guildford at a scale of 1:25000 and is best for walking.
These maps can be found in any good bookshop in Guildford (see 'Buy' section below), or can be bought online from the Ordnance Survey.

Shopping[edit]
Sometimes regarded as one of the premier shopping destinations in the South, Guildford is the major shopping centre of West Surrey - possibly the whole county - with most of its shops clustered in a fairly compact area on and around the High Street, and the parallel North Street.
There are three shopping centres:
51.237105-0.5763581 Friary Shopping Centre, North St, GU1 4YT (at the bottom of North Street and Onslow Street), ☏ +44 1483 503773. M-Sa 9AM-6PM, Su 11AM-5PM. (updated Feb 2017)

Although there are several shopping malls, unlike many modern towns in England, the famed and attractive cobbled High Street has remained the focus of Guildford's shopping district. It is here, on the High Street and on North Street that you will find the best shops, and have the nicest shopping experience.
In general stores open M-Sa 9:30AM–5:30PM and Su 10AM-4PM although many stay open longer on some days and some do not open on a Sunday.
In addition to the shops and malls scattered around North Street and the High Street there is also a regular market each Friday and Saturday which stretches along North Street which offers a variety of goods including traditional fresh meat, fish, fruit, fresh ground coffee, cheese, olives, vegetables, flowers, pet food, luggage, linen, rugs, bags, towels, jewellery, clothes, cards, wooden carvings, CDs and picture frames.
The market operates during normal shopping hours on Fridays and Saturdays on North Street in Guildford, and is very close to Leapale Road and Castle multi-storey car parks.
There is also a Farmers Market on the High Street generally on the first Tuesday of every month. These times can vary during the summer season and during Guilford Summer festival, where markets, including crafts and handicrafts markets can be seen lining the high street for several weeks. During the run up to Christmas, too, there will be extra markets.

Money[edit]
All main British banks and building societies have branches in Guildford, and most of them are situated around the eastern end of the High Street. These branches normally open M-F 9AM-4PM and Sa 9AM-noon.
Most bank and building society branches have 'through the wall' type ATMs that are open 24x7.
For changing money there are many Bureaux de Change services throughout the town, with some such as the post office offering commission free exchanges.

Guildford has a good selection of restaurants with many different themes attracting different tastes. On Friday and Saturday many of them are booked up weeks in advance and early booking is advisable to avoid disappointment.
