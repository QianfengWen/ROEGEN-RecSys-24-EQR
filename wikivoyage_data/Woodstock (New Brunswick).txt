History[edit]
On the Saint John River
Little is known of the area before it was settled by disbanded veterans of De Lancey's Brigade following the American Revolutionary War. The veterans moved there in late 1783. 26,000 acres were granted to 110 men. Not all took up the offer, and of those who did, not all stayed. By 1790 only 23 families were present, and by 1804 only 10 of the original men had possession of the land. Around 1805, the town was home to several mills, and export of timber via the Saint John river began about this time.
The town was the first in New Brunswick to be incorporated, in 1856. The first mayor was Lewis P. Fisher. He made provisions in his will for the building of several educational institutions, among them the first Agricultural and Vocational School in Canada, and the L.P. Fisher Public Library.

Woodstock, as the oldest incorporated town in New Brunswick, has many historical buildings. As well, because it is along the scenic St. John River, there are many beautiful locations for outdoor activities.

Built in 1833, the Old Court House was used as a horse barn from the 1883 construction of a new court house until 1966.

 L.P. Fisher Library, 679 Main Street, ☏ +1 506 325-4777. Public library on Main Street in the heart of town, designed and constructed early in the 20th century from part of the fortune which Woodstock's first mayor L.P. Fisher left for the civic betterment of the town. A heritage building and a busy working library, it also houses three specialized collections: the Dr. G.F. Clarke collection of Wolastoqiyik (Maliseet) artefacts; the local historical and genealogical reference books and manuscripts of the W.O. Raymond Room; and the Dalton Camp Canadiana collection. The latter are both named for and in part provided by writers whose roots were in Woodstock. a modern section was completed in 2015 (updated Apr 2016)
The Charles Connell House
 Charles Connell House, 128 Connell Street, ☏ +1 506 328-9706. July-August: daily 10AM-6PM, or by appointment. The Honourable Charles Connell House, built in 1840, was once the home of politician Charles Connell. Now a museum which contains authentic artefacts from that era, it houses the Carleton County Historical Society's archives. 
 Meduxnekeag Valley Nature Preserve. The Meduxnekeag River Valley is the New Brunswick heart of a rich and unique type of hardwood forest. Containing many provincially rare and uncommon plant species, the surviving scattered patches of this "Appalachian" or "St. John River" hardwood forest occupy only about 1 percent of their original extent. The Meduxnekeag River Association has purchased and protected the Preserve, creating a well-marked 10 km network open year round to the public. 
Do[edit]
Take a walking tour, to view the beautiful public and private Victorian-era buildings in the historic downtown and nearby streets. Maps can be obtained at local tourist bureaus, the Library, or the Charles Connell House. Each home along the tour has a sign with its description on the front of the property.
Old Home Week is a county-fair type celebrated in Woodstock each year. There are various festivities held at the fairground and throughout the town, including: the Tractor Pull, the Joe McGuire Road Race, the Miss New Brunswick Pageant, Hobby Shows, the Demo Derby and Live Entertainment.
 Dooryard Arts Festival. A four-day mixed arts festival in July that showcases the best in local and regional art, music, theatre, film and writing. Over 25 live music acts, an assortment of art displays, workshops, and street market. 
Hike the Maliseet Trail. This trail passes through a mixed forest stand and has a gentle uphill grade. The trail ends at the Hayes Falls. The ice buildup makes a prime site for an easy and fun winter-time ice climb (lots of anchor potential at the top) and a great winter camping spot to boot. The trail is located about 3 km south of Woodstock along the highway, but isn't very well marked. Stop by a tourist bureau to get proper directions.
