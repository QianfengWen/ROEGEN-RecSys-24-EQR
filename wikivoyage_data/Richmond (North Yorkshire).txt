Richmond is an historic town of 8,400 people (2011) in North Yorkshire, England, in the northeast corner of the Yorkshire Dales. It is a good starting point for a visit to the Yorkshire Dales National Park.


Understand[edit]
Visitor information
Get in[edit]
The best way to enter is by car, roads from the A66, A1 and the Yorkshire Dales all suffice. Arriva Bus services from Darlington are regular but not the cheapest way to get in, less regular bus services also come from the Dales, but again are quite expensive. Unfortunately, the train station closed long ago, so the nearest train station is Darlington. The nearest airport is Durham Tees Valley.
