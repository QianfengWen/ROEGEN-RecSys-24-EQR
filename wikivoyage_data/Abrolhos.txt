Ilha Redonda (Round Island)
Abrolhos is an archipelago off the coast of Bahia, a state of Northeast Brazil.


Understand[edit]
Get in[edit]
Before you can get to Abrolhos, you must first go to Caravelas. Here you will find a number of tour operators authorized by IBAMA to sail to the archipelago. The cost per person for a day-trip is around R$220 (about USD 140). Check the page for Caravelas for instructions on how to get to Caravelas.
Once in Caravelas, you can only get to Abrolhos by boat. Your choices are:

Fishing boat - If you go on a fishing boat it will take around 6 hours to get there. You will be forced on an overnight stay.
Catamar√£ - Takes around 3h30min and you have the choice to stay overnight.
Speed boat - Around 1h30min depending on sea conditions. It is a one-day trip.
Get around[edit]
Only swimming or by boat. You cannot get anywhere on foot unless you're on the island, which you will not be for more than 30min. So be prepared to spend a lot of time in the sea or on the boat.

Plenty of swimming
If you dive, it is a great option (it costs around R$150 (about USD 70) for a 30-minute dive.
Whale watch
If you go to Abrolhos during the mating season (July to November), go on a whale-watching excursion. You would probably come across some on your way to Abrolhos, but it may be more interesting to go for a dedicated whale-watching tour.

Eat[edit]
You cannot bring your own food unless you get permission from the boat's captain. The food is served on board by the tour operators authorized to sail to the island.

Drink[edit]
Plenty of mineral water and soft drinks. Avoid alcohol as you will be at sea and alcohol can be dangerous, as people normally underestimate the dangers of the sea. You do not want to spoil your holidays...
Sleep[edit]
If you plan to sleep in Abrolhos you should be aware it can only be done on board of a boat. Since they are small boats, they will rock and if you're prone to sea-sickness you should take some pills or avoid an overnight stay and return to the continent in the afternoon.
