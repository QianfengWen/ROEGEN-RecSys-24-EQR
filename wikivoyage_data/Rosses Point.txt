Rosses Point is a village in County Sligo with a population of 883 in 2016. It's a fishing village at the outflow of Sligo Bay, and "Ross" means the peninsula between that and Drumcliffe Bay further north. It's 8 km west of Sligo and in the 19th century became a holiday resort, similar to Strandhill facing it across the estuary.


Get in[edit]
"Waiting On Shore", maybe a while
See Sligo for long-distance routes by road or rail. By car follow N4 to Sligo then R291 northwest for 8 km along the coast.
Bus S2 follows the coast from Strandhill north of the estuary to Sligo bus and railway station, and continues west via city centre, the hospital, Institute of Technology and Ballincar (Radisson Hotel), taking 20 min from the bus station to Rosses Point. It runs hourly, daily; adult fare is about €3 cash, and cheaper by Leap Card.
A cycleway connects Sligo and Rosses Point.

Rosses Point is a small village and is easy to get around on foot or by bike.

See[edit]
Waiting on Shore is a mawkish statue near the lifeboat station. She could be waiting a while.
Elsinore House is a sorry ruin, with only the ivy holding together the masonry. The Yeats family spent summer holidays here and it features in the writings of William (WB Yeats) and the paintings of his brother Jack. William is buried 5 km east at Drumcliffe "under bare Ben Bulben's head": see Sligo for details but you can get there without backtracking into town, via the narrow lanes. Very narrow, just hope you don't meet another vehicle.
54.308-8.5721 Beaches stretch along the west-facing Atlantic coast. They're not as afflicted by currents as the bay, but they're breezy and exposed to waves. First Beach is the 400 m stretch by the caravan site, with parking, toilets, ramp access, and lifeguards in summer. This strip ends at the headland of Bowmore Point, with its colourful cabin. North of there is slipway access to Second Beach, stretching 1 km to Wren Point, with the golf course behind. This is the main beach for kite-surfing. Third Beach is a lonely place north of Wren Point along the spit to the outflow of Drumcliffe Bay; at low tide you can walk to Lower Rosses lighthouse on its tressle tower. There are salt marshes behind the beach and Benbulbin louring across the estuary. Reach it either from Second Beach or by the lanes north side of the peninsula.
54.303-8.5762 The Metal Man is the distinctly camp sailor atop the navigation tower on Perch Rock. Approaching by sea, you should line up his light with that of Oyster Island behind. Once close in, sail where he's pointing (mincing, more like) to be in the safe channel. Erected in 1821, he has an identical twin at Tramore in County Waterford.
54.3018-8.56713 Oyster Island is farmland, nowadays uninhabited and privately owned, with a lighthouse aligned with the Metal Man. In 1864 a fleet of "oyster pirates" attempted to raid the local oyster beds, and there was a grand set-to with the police, who were out in force to stop them. The pirates were defeated that day, but in the following years overfishing destroyed the Sligo oyster beds.
54.3-8.5854 Coney Island can be reached by boat from Rosses Point, but it's tidal so usually you walk or drive across the sands from Strandhill. A few people still live there, heavily outnumbered by rabbits.
