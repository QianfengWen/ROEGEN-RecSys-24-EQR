Cobbled streets in Lymington's town centre
Lymington is a small port in Hampshire in the South East of England. It is adjacent to the New Forest and faces across the Solent to the western end of the Isle of Wight.
Lymington is a major yachting centre, with several yacht clubs and a large marina, as well as a ferry port serving Yarmouth on the Isle of Wight.
Historically, Lymington was a centre of the salt-drying industry, where salt water was admitted to shallow lagoons and dried out. These abandoned lagoons (called saltings) have now become major sea bird reserves, and the area attracts ornithologists.
