Pitt Meadows is a city of 18,500 people (2016) in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia, on the north bank of the Fraser River at the confluence with the Pitt River.  It's part of the urban edge, where bedroom housing for suburban Vancouver is displacing the small agricultural town of Pitt Meadows past — but the farms hang on.


Understand[edit]
The Municipality takes its name from the Pitt River and Pitt Lake, which were possibly named after former British Prime Minister William Pitt.
Aboriginal people resided in the Pitt Meadows area approximately 1000 years ago. James McMillan explored the area in 1874. Europeans started a settlement known as Bonson's Landing in the area in the 1870s. Early settlers were mostly Anglo-Saxon until after 1910.
In 1885, the Canadian Pacific Railway was constructed through Pitt Meadows to Port Moody, British Columbia. In 1893, the first dyking district was organized. In 1914, Pitt Meadows was a small, agricultural community of less than 250 individuals which supplied Vancouver and New Westminster with produce and dairy products.
After 1910, many French Canadians and Japanese arrived as settlers. A large group of Dutch farmers reclaimed much of the low-lying land in Pitt Meadows after World War II.
