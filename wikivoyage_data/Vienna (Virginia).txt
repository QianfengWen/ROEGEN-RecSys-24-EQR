Vienna is a largely residential city of 17,000 people (2018) in Virginia, not far from Washington, D.C.. It has a downtown with many small businesses, and a portion of the Washington & Old Dominion Railroad Regional Park hiking and biking trail cuts through the center of the town.


Get in[edit]
The car is king in Vienna. It's the most practical way to get around in most of Northern Virginia, due to a very basic mass transit system, and sprawl. Sprawl and lacking mass transit of course lead to traffic; the D.C. metro area has the second worst in the United States by some measures. But feel free to drive to and through Vienna, just not M-F 8AM to 10AM or 4:30 to 7PM.
Vienna does have a Washington Metro stop, at the end of the Orange line; however, it is almost two miles from the center of town. Buses run the length of the town up and down Maple Avenue, the defacto main street.
"Downtown" Vienna is small enough to get around on a bike or on foot, but it's a car that will get you in and out of the town.
