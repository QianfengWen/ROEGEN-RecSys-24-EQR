Ballymoney is a town historically in County Antrim in Northern Ireland; those counties have been abolished and it's now part of Causeway Coast and Glens District. Baile Monaidh means "homestead on the peatland" and it was a small agricultural town along the Belfast-Coleraine road, now A26. In the late 20th century it burgeoned into a commuter town and in 2011 the population was 10,402.
Ballymoney's best known tourist attraction, Dark Hedges, is 8 miles northeast on the road to Ballycastle. 


Understand[edit]
Dark Hedges
Motorcycle racing is popular in Northern Ireland. One reason is the exploits of Ballymoney man Joey Dunlop (1952-2000).
At the start of the 20th century, all of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom, yet there were different rules on road-racing. The 1903 Gordon Bennett Cup for sports cars was to be held in the UK but road racing was illegal in Great Britain but not in Ireland. So it was staged on closed public roads around Athy - shamrock green was chosen as the British national racing colour, and it's remained so ever since.
After 1921 motor sports continued in both the north and south, but the north had a better industrial base, and venues such as disused airfields. The Republic lacked an off-road dedicated circuit until Mondello Park opened near Naas in 1966. The north had Kirkistown on the Ards peninsula and Bishopscourt at Downpatrick. It also developed on-road circuits, notably Clady and Dundrod near Antrim town, and the Northwest 200 - that was so named because it was supposed to be around Derry and Donegal, but from inception in 1929 was a triangle around Coleraine, Portstewart and Portrush. Smaller circuits were at Cookstown, Tandragee in Armagh, and Armoy near Ballymoney.
Joey Dunlop grew up to the sound of motorbikes roaring through Ballymoney and by his 20s was leader of the pack. He won the Ulster Grand Prix 24 times, took three hat-tricks of events at the Manx TT, and numerous other titles. He was awarded an MBE for services to the sport, then an OBE in 1996 for his charity work. The end came suddenly on a wet summer day in Tallinn in July 2000: he'd already won two events on the Pirita on-road circuit and was leading a third, when he appeared to lose control and hit the trees.
The sport in Northern Ireland has declined since, and two other members of Joey's family have died in racing motorbike crashes. The Ulster Grand Prix on Dundrod circuit was in difficulty even before Covid enforced a shutdown. It was expected to resume in Aug 2022, but was cancelled as the finances didn't add up. Meanwhile other sports are drawing away audiences and sponsors.

55.1344-6.38061 The Dark Hedges  are a half-mile avenue of beech trees lining Bregagh Lane near its junction with Ballinlea Road, a mile west of Armoy. They were planted in 1755 to make a stately approach and vista for Gracehill House, which is now a golf club and hotel. They've folded together to create a tunnel, atmospheric when in leaf, but distinctly gaunt in winter. 250 years have taken a toll and many gaps have appeared, especially after it was the location for "King's Road" in Game of Thrones. The narrow lane became mobbed by traffic, and the extra weight damaged the tree roots, until in 2017 the Council banned traffic from the lane. Many ignore this, but it's best to park 150 yards east off Ballinlea Road. In July 2021 at first sight the car park looks closed for construction, but actually you can get in and out and it's free.
55.142-6.492 Derrykeighan Old Church is the ruin of a 17th-century church. During repairs, it was found to contain a stone inscribed in elaborate 1st century AD La Tène style. This early Celtic style is rare in Ireland, and how the stone came to be part of the church fabric is unknown.
