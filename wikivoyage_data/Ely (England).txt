Ely is a small, historical cathedral city in Cambridgeshire, England. Ely's character as a tiny, isolated city remains largely untouched, and the "Ship of the Fens" dominates the surrounding landscape in much the same way it has done for most of the past millennium.


Understand[edit]
Ely Cathedral, across the Palace Green in Summer
Built on a chalk hill, the city is thought to be named after the eels in the nearby River Ouse. The hill was once an inaccessible island in the middle of the Fens. It was also the last stronghold of Anglo-Saxon resistance, under Hereward the Wake who hid in the original cathedral until the Normans crossed the Fens in 1071.
The surrounding landscape has been transformed from watery marshland to fertile farmland, and nearby Cambridge is continuing to growth, but Ely remains apart. 

Ely local information
Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
52.3902780.2663891 Ely train station. Ely is on a major junction of a number of lines and so it's possible to enter and exit from a large number of directions.   (updated Sep 2023)
Ely has direct trains to London King's Cross, Stansted Airport,
Ipswich, Norwich, Kings Lynn, Peterborough, and via Peterborough to Birmingham and Liverpool. You can also connect at Peterborough for fast trains to Scotland.
If you want to get to London, then it is quicker to go to London King's Cross (70 minutes) with the train running non-stop after Cambridge, although tickets to London Liverpool Street station are a bit cheaper. The latter journey will take about 90 minutes via Bishop's Stortford (transferring at Cambridge).
Trains depart Ely to both Liverpool Lime Street and London Liverpool Street Station. Be careful as they are 200 miles apart!

By car[edit]
Ely is situated on the A10, some 16 miles north of Cambridge, where it is possible to join the M11 for fast access to/from London (72 miles).  Nearby roads may be flooded in the winter (typically the A1123 at Earith, and A1101 at Welney).  Many of the smaller roads across the Fens have uneven surfaces and unguarded ditches, which lead to a number of fatalities each year.

By bicycle[edit]
For the more adventurous it is possible to cycle into Ely from Cambridge [1].
The 16 mile journey follows the river and for an average person takes around an hour and a half, with the majority of the route being a designated cycle path.

Get around[edit]

Drink[edit]
Munster Tavern

52.396660.2613132 The Fountain, 1 Silver Street (South end of town, near Barton Square. Two minutes further up Silver Street from the Albert.). Good Adnams real ale and nice interior very pricey. (updated Nov 2021)
52.400110.263693 The Hereward, 45 Market St, CB7 4LZ, ☏ +44 1353 772 050. A functional drinking barn on the Market Street, this place is like any chain pub in any city, with little atmosphere but everything you may need a hand. Formally the hardware store Cutlacks, the pub offers relatively cheap food which is variable in quality, live sport, and occasional karaoke and bands. Best avoided on Fridays and Saturdays unless you're starting a bit of a party (in which case the Town House is across the street for the conclusion!) The occasional beer festivals there are great, with inexpensive guest ales served at one end of the bar. (updated Nov 2021)
52.400470.259034 Isle of Ely, 10 Downham Rd, CB6 2BZ, ☏ +44 1353 888 731. Green King (updated Nov 2021)
52.399530.262285 The Minster Tavern, The Minster Tavern, 1, Minster Place, CB7 4EL (directly across from Cathedral entrance). One of the oldest pubs in town with lots of character, including its very own ghost (a Benedictine monk who likes ale). Can be quiet during the day, generally busiest Fridays and Saturdays until 10PM and after midnight. Generally inexpensive drinks (£2.00 for a Tennant's Lager up to £3.00 for a Guinness). (updated Nov 2021)
52.397690.25966 The Prince Albert, 62 Silver Street, CB7 4JF (Half way down Silver Street), ☏ +44 1353 663 494. The former "Best pub in Ely". The Albert holds the vote of many for the highest standard of beer in Ely, particularly Greene King. The beer garden is lovely in summer. Food is great, and the pub still retains its living room feel. Not the best place in the world for a large group of people, but much better choice than the Fountain on a pub crawl. (updated Nov 2021)
52.398360.267367 The Royal Standard, 24 Fore Hill, CB7 4AF (Slightly out of the way down the hill from the market square (although distance is hardly an issue in Ely!)), ☏ +44 1353 645 194. The Standard is great fun on Fridays and Saturdays in particular with fun cover bands and a charismatic, Hawaiian short wearing landlord. Beer is relatively inexpensive and the back of the pub has been extended so the place is now an odd mix of traditional pub and old people's home.  (updated Nov 2021)

The Town House, On Market Street opposite the Hereward, the clientele and atmosphere of the pub is very variable depending on the day of the week. During the week, in particularly in summer it is a nice place to enjoy a drink outside. On Fridays, Saturdays and occasionally Sundays the pub is so busy it operates a one-in, one-out policy so expect a queue after 10:30PM, but in a group it can be worth it for a fun night. Great during events such as the World Cup with a BBQ outdoors and the beer festival in July is a must in terms of pub beer festivals.


Sleep[edit]
The Lamb
Various Bed & Breakfast establishments can be found in the city. A web search should turn up a vacancy. Most are within walking distance from the train station.

52.3999650.2628062 [dead link] The Lamb Hotel, 2 Lynn Rd, ☏ +44 1353 663574. Can't miss it if you drive into Ely from Cambridge, as the old A10 road makes a sharp left in front of it before meandering on to Littleport. Looks posh, and is about 100 yards from the Cathedral. You may find it difficult to park during the day. 
52.374820.2491743 Braham Farm (campsite), Little Thetford (1.5 miles south of Ely on the A10, off a barely marked junction.), ☏ +44 1353 662386. The Braham farm campsite is run by a friendly couple, it's far enough from the road not to be noisy. It's got a footpath to Ely from it. It's got a good view of the cathedral too.
