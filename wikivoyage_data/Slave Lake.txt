History[edit]
The area of the present-day Town of Slave Lake was discovered by Europeans when David Thompson visited the area in 1799. Following his brief visit, several fur trading posts were established around Slave Lake, with a Hudson's Bay Company post established at the mouth of the lake. The first community, called Sawridge, was renamed Slave Lake in 1923. It was wiped out by a flood in the 1930s, and was moved to its current location.
In 2011, large parts of the town were affected by wildfires in the area. Winds pushed the flames into the town and destroyed many houses and businesses. Mandatory evacuation orders were issued, but with highways being closed, residents were urged to make their way to beaches, large parking lots, and open spaces. Highway 2 was eventually re-opened for evacuation,  and full evacuation was ordered for Slave Lake.
One third of the town was destroyed, including the town hall, the library, a radio station, a mall and a lot of homes and other buildings; no injuries or deaths were reported.
