Columbus is a great example of a true river city, once a major center for textile manufacturing. Founded in 1828, Columbus is also known for being the site of the last battle of the Civil War, where Columbus ranked second to Richmond in the manufacture of supplies for the Confederate army. Columbus was also one of the most important industrial centers of the south in the early 1900s.
Its historic elements remain while it possesses all the aspects of a modern city. Its small town feel is still kept intact despite being Georgia's third largest city with a population of 195,000 (2018).

Historic Districts[edit]
Downtown Columbus architecture
Columbus is home to the following 7 historic districts, all listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).

Columbus Historic District: This historic district is located in downtown. It retains the brick streets likely from the Civil War times. It is also home to many historic homes, most build in the late-1800s. Colonial Revival, Craftsman, English Vernacular Revival, Spanish Colonial Revival and one 1954 California Ranch.
Columbus Historic Riverfront Industrial District: Added to the NRHP in 1978, this historic district is located downtown and covers four separate areas, all close to the Chattahoochee River. It includes Heritage Park, as well as historic Columbus Iron Works (now the Columbus Convention & Trade Center).
Dinglewood Historic District:The Dinglewood Historic District is a small, residential neighborhood comprising the c. 1859 Dinglewood house; early 20th –century residences; a privately-owned, central, circular park; and a city-owned park. The district developed around Dinglewood, the two-story, Italianate-style house designed for Colonel Joel Early Hurt. Common house styles in the district include Georgian, Bungalow, Ranch, Colonial Revival, English Vernacular Revival, and Spanish Colonial Revival.
Peacock Woods-Dimon Circle Historic District: The development of this historic district began in 1922. The center of the district (known as Rock Park) was developed by Charles Frank Williams and the southwest portion (known as Wynnton Heights) was subdivided by Hezikiah Land. The district includes a broad range of architectural styles including Colonial Revival, Craftsman, English Vernacular Revival, Spanish Colonial Revival and one 1954 California Ranch.
Weracoba-St. Elmo Historic District: The history of this historic district begins with the founding of Columbus and with the city’s most famous antebellum mansion, St. Elmo, built circa 1830. Another smaller antebellum house, Highland Hall, dating from the 1850s, is also within the District. Both structures are listed in the NRHP, and they illustrate the area’s original use as a setting for suburban estates prior to the American Civil War. Today, the Weracoba / St. Elmo Historic District is a vibrant multi-use residential, recreational, educational, and commercial area with a strong sense of community among its residents. Its canopy of mature hardwood trees shelters the city’s- and perhaps one of the state’s-largest and most intact 1920s/1930s concentration of middle-class Craftsman Bungalow, Tudor Revival, Classical, and Mission Revival style homes. Of the 440 surviving houses in the District, 85% were constructed by 1941.
Wildwood Circle-Hillcrest Historic District: In the 1880s, a streetcar line was constructed along Wildwood Avenue to serve the Wynnton area. Owner of the streetcar line and the Muscogee Real Estate Company, John Francis Flournoy, built his own Queen Anne estate here as he developed the Wildwood Circle subdivision. Sale of lots along the streetcar line peaked from 1918 to 1925. Also within this district—at 1519 Stark Avenue—is the childhood home of Carson McCullers (1917–1967) the renowned novelist and playwright. Some of the architectural styles in this district include Colonial Revival, English Vernacular Revival, Mission/Spanish Revival, and Craftsman.
Village of Wynnton Historic District: An example of an early-to mid-20th-century residential neighborhood developed from antebellum estates and in response to the streetcar line which ran along the southern and eastern boundaries of the district. The evolution of Wynnton Village spans over 150 years from its antebellum estates, to its village center developed in the mid-19th century, to the beginning of streetcar suburbs in the 1890s, to intense residential development from 1919 through the 1940s and then serving as a prime location for multi-family dwellings for World War II-era Fort Benning officers. Architectural styles vary from early examples of Greek and Gothic Revival to popular early 20th century styles including Craftsman, Colonial Revival and English Vernacular Revival.
Wynn's Hill-Overlook Historic District: An outstanding example of an early-to mid-20th-century residential neighborhood developed from several antebellum estates. In 1834, Colonel William L. Wynn purchased 100 acres of land located on a rise east of downtown, just beyond the city limits. With the incorporation of a larger Wynnton area into the city limits in the mid-1920s, residential construction boomed; a second peak in building occurred in the 1940s. Some of the architectural styles in this district include Greek Revival, Neoclassical Revival, Colonial Revival, Craftsman, English Vernacular Revival, Mediterranean Revival and Post Modern.
