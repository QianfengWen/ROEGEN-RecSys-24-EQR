Parroquia de Nuestra Señora del Carmen
Tlalpujahua (also known as Tlalpujah de Rayon) is a small town of about 3,600 residents (2023) in Michoacan. It is a historic gold mining town and an important site in the Mexican War of Independence against Spain. The town is now famous for its handmade Christmas ornaments. Tlalpujahua is a designated Pueblo Magico.


Understand[edit]
Like a phoenix, Tlalpujahua is rising from the ashes. It had become a veritable ghost town in the early 1960s, with just 600 residents remaining after the government shut down the gold mines in 1959. The mines had operated since the 1890s, but suffered a setback in 1937 when a landslide destroyed parts of the mine and wiped out about 1/3 of the town, killing more than 400 residents. That's when the government stepped in and began operating the mines, though they did not invest in equipment or update facilities and by the late 1950s, had been run into the ground.
Around that time, a young local man named Joaquín Muñoz Orta went to Chicago where he found work as a factory laborer making  Christmas tree ornaments. He learned quick and realized he could make a good business for himself doing similar work in Mexico. He moved to Mexico City and set up his own workshop. His business grew, and he eventually moved back to Tlalpujahua, his home town, where he established Adornos Navideños SA de CV. Today, his company employs more than 1,000 workers producing millions of hand-blown glass Christmas tree ornaments each year, mostly for export. Other local entrepreneurs have followed in his footsteps and today, more than 200 small workshops in Tlalpujahua produce a wide range of handcrafted Christmas ornaments.
