Tarija is the capital and largest city of the Tarija Department of Bolivia, with a population of some 268,000 (2012), and is the centre of Bolivia's fledgling wine industry.


Understand[edit]
Plaza de Entre Rios
In the central valley of the district, at 1,800–2,000 m, the climate in Tarija is mild and semi-arid, in contrast to the harsh Altiplano and the humid heat of the Amazon Basin. Average daily highs are 27–30 °C year round, while average nightly lows vary 8–17 °C depending on season. Freezing temperatures in winter are not uncommon. The winters (May–Aug) are dry, while summers are more rainy.
As the Inca Empire conquered the valley, the original population was dispersed. The stone roads might have been built by the pre-Inca cultures. The city was founded in 1574.
Tarija is the most important wine district of Bolivia.
