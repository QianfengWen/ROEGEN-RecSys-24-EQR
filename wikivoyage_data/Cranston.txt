Cranston[dead link] is the second largest city in Rhode Island by population with 83,000 residents in 2020. It lies north of Warwick and south of Providence.


Understand[edit]
Formerly known as Pawtuxet, the city is bordered by the City of Warwick and the Town of West Warwick to the south, and the Town of Scituate to the west. Part of the Providence County, Cranston is home to 3½ miles of shoreline of the Providence River—which opens up to Naragansett Bay. Cranston was established from a part of Providence in 1754, but it was not until 1910 that it was designated a city.
The climate is temperate, reaching highs of 105°F in the summer and lows of -5°F in the winter.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Cranston is a short drive from any Rhode Island city or town. From the south, it is easiest to take I-95 N exit 11 (in Warwick, RI), to I-295 N exit 1, to RI-2 N into Cranston. From the north, it is easiest to take I-95 S exit 16, to RI-1 S (Elmwood Avenue/Post Road), into Cranston: RI-12 (Park Avenue) and RI-2 (Reservoir Avenue).

By plane[edit]

Get around[edit]
By car[edit]
Destinations in Cranston are most easily accessible by car. Renting a car or bringing your own is advisable. Many locations of interest are close to each other, and can be walking distance apart, but locations may be car-centrically designed or areas of high traffic volume. Travelling from western Cranston across the city into the Edgewood neighborhood can take quite awhile by Rhode Island standards. Park Avenue is a primary way to do this, and receives much traffic. Central and eastern Cranston resemble the capital city of Providence to a greater degree than western Cranston, so plan for traffic in these places accordingly.
