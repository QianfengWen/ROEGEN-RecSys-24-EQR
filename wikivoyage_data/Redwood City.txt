Get in[edit]
37°29′42″N 122°13′26″WMap of Redwood City


By train[edit]
 Caltrain. Commuter train between San Francisco and San Jose/Gilroy with a stop at Redwood City Station, which is located near Broadway and El Camino. Redwood City marks the southern boundary of fare zone 2. $3.25+. 
By car[edit]
Most of Redwood City is bracketed by two freeways: I-280 to the west and US-101 to the east.  Redwood Shores, however, is a substantial part of Redwood City that is east of US-101.

There are several exits off the Bayshore Freeway US-101 that lead into Redwood City.  From north to south, they are: Marine Parkway and Redwood Shores Parkway that lead eastward to Redwood Shores, Whipple Avenue that leads westward towards the little historical downtown area, Woodside that leads westward (as Seaport Blvd) to the Port of Redwood City and eastward is Hwy 84 from the Dumbarton Bridge, and Marsh Road that merges directly with the Dumbarton Bridge.
Exits off of the more scenic Junipero Serra Freeway I-280 include, from north to south, Edgewood Road that leads eastward to downtown, Farm Hill Road that leads eastward to Jefferson Avenue, Woodside (Hwy. 84), and Sand Hill Road that leads to nearby Stanford and Palo Alto.
By bus[edit]
SamTrans buses of the San Mateo County Transit District serve Redwood City and link to Caltrain, as well as having express bus service to downtown SF and to San Jose, and peninsular points between.

By plane[edit]
Equally convenient to the San Francisco International Airport (SFO IATA) and to San Jose International Airport (SJC IATA), Redwood City is also served by the little San Carlos airport, which is off Redwood Shores Parkway and hosts an air museum worth going out of your way to see.

By boat[edit]
Redwood City has a deep seaport, even though the logging trade is not noticeable any more. Small craft and fishing boats head out of the port, sailing classes are available, and there's at least one cruise ship that makes port here. The nearby marshes and salt-evaporating ponds make for nice quiet noodling about in a kayak.

Get around[edit]
Downtown is more than small enough to walk around.
