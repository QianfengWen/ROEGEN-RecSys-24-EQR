Xilitla is a small town of 6,500 people (2010) in San Luis Potosí whose main claim to fame is the somewhat bizarre artwork that British artist Edward James left and created here. It is also known for its mountainous landscapes and its springs.


Understand[edit]
Xilitla
Las Pozas
While Xilitla (pronounced with a leading Spanish j sound) has been mentioned in 16th century Spanish documents and bears an indigenous name roughly meaning "place of snails", it would likely be just another delightful yet forgettable mountain town in the interior of Mexico if not for one eccentric wealthy British artist, who got inspired by the local environment to put his surrealist art into practice. He was initially drawn here to build an orchid garden, but a particularly fierce winter killed 15,000 plants, convinced him to instead build something more permanent: a bizarre mixture of sculptures and garden which manages at the same time to integrate itself into the semi-artificial nature and be a parody on modern architecture. Few places outside the Washington D.C.metro have ever made "naked concrete" so interesting to look at.
The economy is primarily agricultural with the main crops being coffee and citrus. The lack of industrialization has helped preserve the Nahuatl and Teenek indigenous cultures and their traditional ways of life.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The old carretera linking Mexico city with the US border passes through town and while its long distance travel function has been largely overtaken by newer autopistas it still serves as an important freight and local corridor. Beware of omnipresent topes, curvy mountainous roads and reckless overtaking maneuvers. Some stretches of the road are affected by various kinds of crime, but you should be fine driving during daylight hours and not stopping in the most dangerous parts.

By bus[edit]
There are daily direct buses to Mexico city and other major cities, but more frequent connections open up if you're willing to change into a colectivo minivan at "La Y Griega", a major T junction, literally named "the Y".
From Ciudad de Valles goes Frontera for about M$118 (Jan 2022). You can also check Grupo Vencedor.

21.385231-98.9920251 Terminal de Autobuses, Av. Lopez de Mateos. Bus companies have their own terminals in Xilitla, but fortunately for travelers, they cluster in one place along Av. Lopez de Mateos (MEX-120). Look for the signs for Vencedor or Primera Plus.

Templo de San Agustín
21.385676-98.9897553 Ex Convento San Agustin (Church of Saint Augustine), Hidalgo 201. - Oldest monument in Xilitla, the former convent was built by Augustine missionaries between 1533-1537. Built in the Plateresque style, the church features a long, low arched nave. The missionaries would have occupied rooms around a small central courtyard surrounded by arched walkways. 
There are many caves and caverns in Xilitla, as well as many natural springs. Parakeet Cave, a short walk from the town, is home to a large number of green parrots which leave and re-enter the cave at dawn and dusk every day.
Do[edit]
A coffee fair is held in August.
The feast of San Agustín: from August 27 to September 2. On August 28 it is celebrated with dances of Soledad, Wands and Rebozo and on November 15 the festivities of that month begin.
