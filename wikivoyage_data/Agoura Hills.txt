Agoura Hills[dead link] and Westlake Village are cities in the Ventura County region. Though they are a part of Los Angeles County, they share the Conejo Valley with Thousand Oaks and are separated from the San Fernando Valley by the Simi Hills and Santa Monica Mountains.


Get in[edit]
34°8′39″N 118°45′50″WMap of Agoura Hills
Take the 101 North; once you have passed the Lost Hills exit, you are in Agoura Hills. When you have passed Lindero Canyon exit, you are no longer in Agoura Hills.
Los Angeles public transportation has one line in. During the summer, a special bus funded by the city takes passengers to and from Malibu beach.

Get around[edit]
Best by automobile, as none of the sites are public transit accessible.

See[edit]
North of the 101 Freeway, Agoura Hills is a typically suburban bedroom community and of little interest to most travelers, however, south of the 101 lies the scenic Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area where you will catch sight of breathtaking views.

34.151694-118.781781 Reyes Adobe Historical Site, 30400 Rainbow Crest Drive, reyes.adobe@ci.agoura-hills.ca.us. 2nd and 4th Saturday from 1-4PM. Built around 1850, it was Agoura Hills' first home to a widow with 14 children, Maria Antonia Machado. She purchased the Reyes rancho, "Rancho Las Virgenes", from her uncle Jose Maria Dominguez. Maria's deceased husband had been the son of Juan Francisco Reyes who served on the famous Portola expedition. From 1916 to 1983 the property transferred to owners who shared a common interest in preserving the landmark adobe home located in the beautiful foothills beneath Ladyface Mountain. Through restoration and research efforts, the City of Agoura Hills has created an interpretive center and museum for visitors to hear their stories. Adults $3, seniors $2, 5 - 12 $1, under 5 free.

There are free summer concerts in the park.  In the 90s, Agoura Hills was known as a "mecca of music," launching music sensations Linkin Park and Hoobastank.
There are a number of places where you can hire horses to ride.
There are plenty of trails to explore.  Chesebro Canyon has some of the best hiking trails in all of Los Angeles.  Many begin in Agoura Hills and take you to Pacific Coast Highway.  You can hike in the opposite direction and once you reach the top, you'll be at an sulfur spring. There is no shortage of biking trails either.
