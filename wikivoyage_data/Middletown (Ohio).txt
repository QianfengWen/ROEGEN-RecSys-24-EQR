By car[edit]
The easiest way into Middletown is by taking exit#32 from I-75.  This is state route 122, also known as Roosevelt Boulevard, and also known as Martin Luther King Dr. This is the main commercial area for the city.  From Hamilton, Ohio state route 4 will lead you into the south end before reaching downtown, then changing into Verity Parkway.  From the west, following Ohio 122 will lead you into downtown after crossing the Little Miami River.

Get around[edit]
By car[edit]
Driving in Middletown is easy for locals, but can be a bit confusing for out-of-towners.
The city only has one freeway ramp, exit #32, which is state route 122.  State route 122 is known as Roosevelt Blvd, which is part of the Martin Luther King beltway.  Major east-west roads are Oxford State in the south end, which connects Middletown with Trenton as state route 73, 14th street, part of the Martin Luther King beltway, Central Avenue, which is the main downtown corridor (and curiously changes to coles road at the Warren County line), Manchester Avenue (One of 3 Manchesters in Middletown), and Verity Parkway, part of state route 73.  North-South routes are Cincinnati-Dayton Road (another with multiple names, Dixie Highway and Old 25), Breiel Boulevard, which is a very heavily traveled route, University Boulevard (part of Martin Luther King beltway), Verity Parkway, and Main Street.
The street system, while it may seem odd, has its advantages.  Most streets, even residential are far wider than necessary, and one can get anywhere in the city in fifteen minutes.  Rush hour traffic usually means waiting an extra light cycle for the arrow.  Red light cameras are frequent.
