Akaroa is a charming harbourside town on the eastern side of Akaroa harbour, in southern Banks Peninsula in the Canterbury region of New Zealand. Its early settlers were French and British. It was the only French settlement in New Zealand. Aspects of its French heritage remain, such as names of streets and businesses.


Understand[edit]
"Akaroa" is Maori for "Long Harbour". The village is snuggled into a wide bay on the eastern side of the rugged harbour, with Onuku Marae a little further south. The permanent population of around 600 (2013) in this historic village swells significantly over summer.  
Akaroa's harbour is home to an array of wildlife, most notably the rare Hector's dolphin. Cruises and dolphin swimming are popular attractions.
