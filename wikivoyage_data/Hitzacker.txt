Hitzacker is a charming riverside town of 5,000 peoole (2020) in Lüchow-Dannenberg district in the Lüneburg Heath region of North Germany. It lies on the River Elbe, about 45 km east of Lüneburg on the a tourist route, the German Timber-Frame Road.

Geography[edit]
Hitzacker lies at the confluence of the River Jeetzel with the mighty Elbe. Immediately northwest are the Elbe Heights (Elbhöhen, also Klötzie), a range of low hills along the Elbe river and a favourite walking area. The lowland areas of the old town are par of the Elbe valley water meadows (Elbtalaue).
Whilst the riverbanks lie just 11 metres above sea level, Hitzacker's local hill, the Weinberg reaches a modest 83 metres. A little way down the Elbe, the Kniepenberg hill (86 m) has great views over the Elbe basin.

History[edit]
The earliest known settlements date to around 3000 BC at the lake of Hitzackersee and the region has been continuously settled since. On the Weinberg next to the old town (Altstadt) there are traces of an eighth-century Slavic castle that turned Hitzacker into an important trading post. It was granted town rights in 1258, whereupon the castle lost its significance and fell into ruins.
In 1548, a fire reduced the village of Hitzacker to ashes apart from the church and one house and there was another serious fire in 1668. In the Polabian or Wendish language of the region, that died out in the 18th century, Hitzacker was known as Ljauci (Lgautztgi).
The borough of Hitzacker was formed in 1972 from ten independent parishes.
