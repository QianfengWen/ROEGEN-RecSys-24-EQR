Seaside is a city on the Northern Oregon Coast.  Seaside is one of the most popular beach resorts on the Oregon Coast, helped largely by easy access from Portland.


Understand[edit]
Go to New York, take the Coney Island amusement park (minus the amusement park rides and midway), lift it up, and drop on the Oregon Coast.  If you can imagine this, you've got a good idea of the look and feel of Seaside.  It has all the trappings of a beach town: cotton candy, salt water taffy, and souvenir shops galore.  This is a great place for kids and kids-at-heart.
