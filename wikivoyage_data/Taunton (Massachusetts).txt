Parks[edit]
 Hockomock Swamp. 24 hours daily. Ranging to almost 17,000 acres at its greatest extent, the Great Hockomock Swamp has significant historic and natural significance. Used by the Wampanoag for at least 10,000 years, it has long held a revered and sacred status. The swamp functioned as a stronghold and defensive position against the English during King Phillip's War. European arrivals would later deem the land worthless, attempting to drain it with limited success. Today, over 5,000 acres remain preserved, with over a dozen rare and endangered species calling it home. Hundreds of miles of unmarked trails are available for the adventurous to explore. Come well prepared, the swamp can be disorienting, footing can be insecure and overgrowth can be dense, impeding progress. Perhaps the best time to visit is high winter, when bogs freeze over and mosquitos become silent. The swamp remains a place of mystery for some, associated with The Bridgewater Triangle, a place where the paranormal becomes normal. Free.   (updated Nov 2022)
