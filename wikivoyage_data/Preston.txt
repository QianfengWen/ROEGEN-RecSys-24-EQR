Preston is a city in the county of Lancashire in North West England, with a population in 2021 of 148,000. It's a former textile and engineering town; it still makes aircraft, hosts the county local government, and has a university. It became a "city" in 2002 but this is purely ceremonial. 


Understand[edit]
Old Docks House
Preston stands at a crossing point over the River Ribble on the main route up the west coast towards Scotland. The Ribble valley together with Yorkshire's River Aire creates the "Aire Gap" where the Pennines can be crossed at low altitude, so there was an east-west route also. "Preston" means "priest town": the church held extensive tracts of land hereabouts. The land near town is fertile and lowland, well-suited to dairy farming. 
There is a plausible legend that William Shakespeare was in a theatre troupe that toured this area, brandishing their wooden swords at Hoghton Tower and Old Rufford Hall. Preston's position meant that several real armies marched through, and two battles were fought here. It has street names such as Fishergate and Friargate but was never a walled city, "gate" simply meant a street. It remained a small market town until the 19th century then grew rapidly with the cotton trade. That brought wealth to a few but when Karl Marx declared in 1854 that “Our St Petersburg is at Preston!” he wasn't paying a compliment to the civic architecture, but envisaging the mass uprising of the working classes. Yet Preston sucked in labour from Ireland and Glasgow, which had even worse working and living conditions, and as well as cotton it was a metal-bashing town. Leyland a few miles south turned the metal into buses and trucks, while aircraft were made at Wharton and Samlesbury. The town already had Preston North End as its football team, but in 1917 munitions workers at Dick, Kerr & Co formed another team, which proved more successful and popular. The Football Association were horrified and banned them, since Dick Kerr were women; yet they battled on until 1965.
The town slumped in the late 20th century when textile and heavy engineering work was lost abroad, and the docks couldn't be upgraded for larger shipping. However the aircraft industry continued, as did the county administration (although large sections of Lancashire were lost to other counties in 1974, and Lancaster remains the ceremonial county town). The major gain was in university status for the former polytechnic, now UCLAN, creating employment and a student buzz about the place.
Famous people from Preston include Sir Richard Arkwright (1732-92) inventor of the spinning frame, Andrew "Freddie" Flintoff (b 1977) the cricketer, Glubb Pasha (1897-1986) commander of the Jordanian Arab Legion, Robert W Service (1874-1954) poet of stirring ballads set in the Yukon, Edward Harris (1804-1877) lawyer and founder of the Harris Institute, and Nick Park (b 1958) creator of "Wallace and Gromit".

By plane[edit]
Manchester Airport (MAN IATA) is usually the best choice for its wide range of flights at competitive fares, and good onward transport, see below. 
Liverpool (LPL IATA) has flights across Europe, otherwise consider Birmingham (BHX IATA) and the London airports. 
Preston itself has an aerospace industry so any large commercial aircraft skimming low on finals over the town is bringing company suits to BAE Wharton or Samlesbury. Blackpool Squires Gate remains in business but has no scheduled flights.

From the coast around Blackpool use M55 for north end of town or to bypass it. Use A583 through Kirkham for the centre and south. A western bypass or link road between these two routes is due to open in 2023.
Preston was bypassed by Britain's first motorway M6, opened in Dec 1958 a year ahead of the first section of M1. Its original two lanes were later expanded to three then four, while the route extended from M1 in the Midlands via Cheshire to Preston, Carlisle and Glasgow, with spurs to Blackpool (M55) and Colne Valley (M65).

St Walburge is an RC church on Weston Street, half a mile north of the railway station, and you'll see its 309-ft (94-m) spire from afar. It was opened in 1854, a product of Catholic emancipation, textile wealth and Gothic Revival design. Its architect Joseph Hansom was the fellow who created the hansom cab. The church is now in the keeping of a traditionalist society who celebrate the Tridentine Mass - the 16th century Latin form, the better to keep Preston free of modern depravity. Walburga herself (710-777 AD) was a Wessex noblewoman who became a nun in Wimborne then abbess of a Germany monastery.

Preston Dock is an artificial basin created in 1892, to enable berthing at all tides. The docks flourished with the textile trade in the 19th century but were always hampered by the shallow River Ribble: ships grew bigger faster than the navigable channel could be enlarged. There was a late heyday as a banana port 1950-1970, when purpose-built Geest boats plied from the West Indies, and what had been a tropical delicacy became a budget staple of the British diet. But their replacement boats were too large, the docks couldn't be adapted for containers, and the Ulster ferry relocated to Stranraer. The docks closed in 1981 and have been turned into a marina. There's little historic remaining except the dockland railway, above.

Lancaster Canal starts in Preston and winds its way north through Garstang, Lancaster and Carnforth then is curtailed by the M6 at Tewitfield. It has a good towpath and is navigable throughout. There are no locks, as it detours west to avoid Longridge and sweeps over the Lune Valley by an impressive Georgian aqueduct. There are spurs to the Ribble estuary at Lytham and to the Lune estuary at Glasson Dock, but no connection to the national canal network — goods were hauled across the Ribble valley at Preston by a horse-drawn tramway. The canal south of there has been lost under modern building except for a very short section at the junction with the Leeds-Liverpool Canal.
Battle of Preston is a suggested walking trail, but it's through modern areas with little more than street names to recall events of 1715. It was the last act of the Jacobite "Old Pretender's" campaign for the crown, a siege followed by fierce street fighting. The Hanoverian troops sustained the worse losses but the Jacobites were captured, and put to death or transported to America. In 1745 the "Young Pretender" tried again, advancing then retreating through Preston without battle. Similarly nothing but street names mark the battle of 1648 at Ribbleton, when Cromwell surprised and trounced the Royalists.

Learn[edit]
Preston Minster
Preston is the main campus of the University of Central Lancashire (UCLAN), with 25,000 students in 2020. It started out as the Institution for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge in 1828. This evolved into Harris Art College, then Preston Polytechnic, then Lancashire Polytechnic, and became a university in 1992. Its other campuses are in Burnley, Westlakes near Whitehaven in Cumbria, and Pyla in Cyprus.

Miller Arcade is a Victorian arcade south side of the Harris.

Eat[edit]
Local specialities include Lancashire cheese, Goosnargh cake and butter pie. This last was also known as Friday Pie or Catholic Pie, as it's made of potatoes, onions and butter and therefore free of meat. It's made and sold in many places, and in Wigan it serves as the vegetarian option in the World Pie-eating Championships. It was traditional half-time fare at Preston North End games, whereas other clubs' fans ate pork pies: in 2007 the supplier folded, and there was an outcry from PNE fans until a new supply was established.
KFC arrived in Britain in 1965, a decade ahead of other chains, and their first branch on Fishergate is still in business (open daily 11AM-10PM). Its founder Harry Latham worked with the original Colonel Sanders in the US, and went on to direct KFC's UK expansion. Late at night after KFC and the pubs closed, the life-sized cut-outs of the Colonel were wont to appear at bus stops across town.
Fishergate into Church St is the main strip, with Bistro Pierre, Theatre St Bar & Grill, Kimji Korean,  Florianas, Turtle Bay, Angelo's and East Z East.

Water in Preston is soft and pure from upland sources - suitable for cotton processing, whereas hard Yorkshire water will do for wool but not cotton. So raise a glass of it to Joseph Livesey (1794-1884), cheesemonger, publisher, social reformer and founder in 1833 of the Temperance movement in Britain. They advocated abstinence from all alcohol except medicinal use — a handy get-out, secretly toasted by many who never entered a pub. One of his stuttering disciples emphasised that one should abstain "tee- tee- totally!" hence Teetotalism.
