Galashiels is a town in the Scottish Borders, 33 miles (53 km) south of Edinburgh. It's a former mill town which is now part of commuterland for the city, and in 2016 had a population of about 12,600.
"Shiels" means shelters, shepherd's huts. There's no sure explanation of "Gala" but it doesn't denote "gala events" - that's from khil'a or khala in Arabic and Hindi, meaning your fanciest clothes.


Understand[edit]

Galashiels (often shortened to "Gala") is at the confluence of the Tweed and Gala Water, and a little way north of the confluence of the Tweed and Ettrick Water. This puts it astride a natural transport route between Edinburgh and Carlisle, and the rivers were harnessed to power mills, to process wool from the sheep dotting the hillsides above. The local textile industry got going from 1800 and mostly wove high-end products such as tweed and tartan - it couldn't compete in the cheap mass market with the Yorkshire mills. In 1883 a School of Textiles was established, which is now a department of Heriot Watt University. Like other Borders towns, Galashiels suffered from foreign competition in the late 20th century, and became run-down. The low point was the closure of the railway in 1969.
It grew again as a commuter town in the 21st century and eventually the railway returned. However this left it without an identity or key attraction of its own, though it's close to grandiose Abbotsford House. But in 2021 Galashiels became the permanent home of the Great Tapestry of Scotland, which celebrates 12,000 of years of Scottish history through the medium of its textiles.

Get in[edit]
Trains from Edinburgh run hourly and take one hour via Eskbank (for Dalkeith and Mining Museum), Gorebridge and Stow, and continue to Tweedbank. In 2023 an adult return is about £13. The line is busy with city commuters in rush hours, but visitors day-tripping outward will travel against the rush. The Waverley Line, axed in 1969, previously continued to Hawick and Carlisle. The section to Edinburgh reopened in 2015 but there are no plans to rebuild the southern section, or to extend the line to Melrose and Jedburgh.
55.6175-2.80551 Interchange is the rail and bus station. There are ticket machines, a cafe and toilets, and waiting room. There is step-free access to the sole platform. Town amenities are within a short walk.
55.605-2.7582 Tweedbank the terminus of the railway is a mile's walk to Abbotsford House.
Borders Bus X95 runs hourly M-Sa from Carlisle along the A7, via Langholm, Hawick, Selkirk, Galashiels, Stow, Newtongrange and Eskbank to Edinburgh. On Sunday only four buses run between Carlisle and Hawick, but the rest of the route is still hourly. 
Bus X62 runs between Edinburgh and  Melrose via Galashiels, Innerleithen and Peebles, a roundabout route taking 2 hr 30 min.
Bus 60 runs from Berwick-upon-Tweed every couple of hours, taking two hours via Chirnside, Duns, Greenlaw, Melrose and Borders General Hospital. 
Bus 67 also runs from Berwick, via Norham, Cornhill, Coldstream and Kelso, whence it becomes an hourly service. 
Bus 68 runs hourly from Jedburgh, taking an hour via Ancrum, St Boswells, Melrose and Borders General Hospital. 
By car or bike from Edinburgh follow A7. This was the historic route from northwest England via Gretna, but nowadays most vehicles take M74 to the west and bypass Galashiels.

55.6389-2.82454 Buckholm is the ruin of a tower house of 1582. There are lurid legends of the misdeeds of its 17th-century owner James Pringle. But an 18th-century vicar exorcised the tower, and scotched its appeal for ghost-tourism.
55.6369-2.85055 Torwoodlee Broch is the fragments of an Iron Age redoubt. It was probably built around 100 AD when the Romans withdrew from Scotland, then destroyed when they returned in 140 AD.
55.6659-2.85786 Bow Castle two miles north is a similar broch, probably built then wrecked at the same time as Torwoodlee. Its masonry suggests an Orkney craftsman. It's well smashed up and the rubble has been heaped into a cairn.
