Rua da Igreja is a 16th-century street in the historic centre of Vila do Conde
Aqueduct and Church of Santa Clara
41.3525-8.7391671 Convento de Santa Clara (Monastery of Santa Clara). Probably the most interesting tourist sight. Later a school for delinquent boys. You may need to knock but then a guide will take you for a tour. A small fountain in a courtyard is fed by a narrow channel from a very long aqueduct, seen stretching away into the hills.   (updated Jun 2021)
This is not a town on the main trail for foreign tourists but it's no worse for that. It has long been connected with lace-making and there's an interesting museum.
The old part of the town is fascinating and it is still a minor port.
There is a disproportionately large Friday market.
Vila do Conde was a very important shipyard in the first decades of the Maritime Discoveries. You can see and visit a replica of a Portuguese "Nau" (a big seafaring ship from the 15th/16th century, bigger than the caravelle, smaller than the galleon) by the riverside. If you arrive by the bridge from the south, the "Nau" is easily visible on the docks by your left.
