Tuktoyaktuk (Tuktuyaaqtuuq, lit. "it looks like a caribou"), commonly known simply as Tuk, is an Inuvialuit village of 900 people (2016) on the Arctic Ocean in the extreme north of Canada's Northwest Territories. It is the only community in Canada on the Arctic Ocean that is connected to the rest of Canada by road.

Understand[edit]
It used to be known as Port Brabant. It was renamed in 1950 and was the first place in Canada to revert to the traditional Indigenous name.

History[edit]
Tuktoyaktuk is the anglicized form of the native Inuvialuit place-name, meaning "resembling a caribou". According to legend, a woman looked on as some caribou, common at the site, waded into the water and turned into stone, or became petrified. Today, reefs resembling these petrified caribou are said to be visible at low tide along the shore of the town.
The settlement has been used by the native Inuvialuit for centuries as a place to harvest caribou and beluga whales. In addition, Tuktoyaktuk's natural harbour was used as a means to transport supplies to other Inuvialuit settlements.
Between 1890 and 1910, a sizeable number of Tuktoyaktuk's native families were wiped out in flu epidemics brought in by American whalers. In subsequent years, the Dene people, as well as residents of Herschel Island, settled here. By 1937, the Hudson's Bay Company had established a trading post.
Radar domes were installed beginning in the 1950s as part of the Distant Early Warning Line, to monitor air traffic and detect possible Soviet intrusions during the Cold War. The settlement's location (and harbour) made Tuk important in resupplying the civilian contractors and Air Force personnel along the DEW Line.
The community of Tuktoyaktuk eventually became a base for the oil and natural gas exploration of the Beaufort Sea. Large industrial buildings remain from the busy period following the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries 1973 oil embargo and 1979 summertime fuel shortage. This brought many more outsiders into the region.
The all-weather road between Inuvik and Tuktoyaktuk was opened in November 2017.

Climate[edit]
Tuktoyaktuk displays a subarctic climate, just short of a polar (tundra) climate, as the July mean temperature is barely above 10 °C (50 °F). Since the Arctic Ocean freezes over for much of the year, the maritime influence is minimized, resulting in really cold winters and a strong seasonal lag in spring. This results in April being much colder than October and May much colder than September. March is also colder than December, and is the only month yet to record a temperature above freezing at any point. Due to the dominance of cold air, Tuktoyaktuk has less precipitation than many desert climates. In spite of this, the cold temperatures render it receiving more than an annual metre of snow on average. Thanks to its landmass link many thousands of kilometres to the south, temperatures way above average can occur in summer in spite of the cold surrounding waters. As of 2018, this is still yet to result in any high above 29.4 °C (84.9 °F).

While it is easy to get around on foot in the town, taking a snowmobile to the store or out on the land is very common. The weather is very hard on vehicles so if you decide to drive be prepared to let your vehicle warm up for a long time in the winter months. Sometimes there is a taxi service available. For trips out on the land or to the airport via the ice road, there are people who will drive you out, such as the charter van for Ookpik Tours.

 The Ice House. This freezer was dug in 1963 in the permafrost underneath the town and has been in use as a permanent fridge ever since. Very eerie but amazing. Used by locals to store meat collected during hunts. There are 19 rooms arranged into three "hallways". Strangely, it is coolest in the ice house during the summer months, but in the winter it warms up and meat is taken out to prevent molding. However, it's closed to non-residents due to the safety risk of climbing 30-foot ladder down into the ice house. (updated Aug 2020)

69.450738-133.0387896 Tuktoyaktuk cemetery. One of the clearest example of climate change can be seen at the cemetery. Rising sea-level are eroding the shorelines and grounds are slowly collapsing into the ocean due to melting permafrost that the cemetery was built on top of. Eventually, the burial ground will be swallowed into the sea unless it's moved further inland. (updated Aug 2020)
69.3997-133.087 The Pingos (5 km west of Tuk). Pingos are domes of earth-covered ice found only in the high Arctic. There are over a thousand in and around Tuk. Get to the pingos by snowmobile or kayak. Hike to the top and toboggan down in winter, or kayak around them for a closer view in summer. The Pingo National Landmark protects a group of eight Pingos. The landmark includes Canada's highest (the world's second-highest) pingo, at 49 m (161 ft).   (updated Jul 2023)
