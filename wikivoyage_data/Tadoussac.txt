Maison du tourisme de Tadoussac (Tadoussac Tourist Office)
A small village hidden in the hollow of the mountains, Tadoussac enjoys a privileged site: the majesty of the St. Lawrence, the Saguenay fjord, unique in North America, the sand dunes, a charming little lake located in the middle of heart of the village, several houses over a hundred years old and many activities to enhance your stay. The beauty of the bay of Tadoussac led to it becoming in 1998 the first member of the select club of the most beautiful bays in the world. Tadoussac is also ranked among the most beautiful villages in Quebec.
In 2000, it wax the first Canadian city to celebrate 400 years of history, Tadoussac constitutes a bastion of Quebec's historical heritage. Tadoussac, which started as a trading post, is the oldest still existing French settlement in the Western Hemisphere. Explorer Jacques Cartier visited the area in 1535 and was seized by its beauty; he anchored there and visited the place. He was followed by Pierre de Chauvin in 1599 and Samuel de Champlain in 1603. The first fur trade post in Canada was established in 1600; it was the first permanent French establishment in North America north of Florida.

Geography[edit]
The entrance to the bay of Tadoussac has a length of 1.0 kilometre (0.62 mi), ie between Pointe de l'Islet (west side of the bay) and Pointe Rouge (east side). This beach can accommodate cruise ships at anchor. This bay serves as a refuge in the event of big waves on the river or on the Saguenay.
The Parc-Languedoc and the Jardin-des-Jésuites are located on Pointe Rouge on a plateau overlooking the mouth of the Saguenay. From the beach, going east, the cliffs become higher and steeper, up to the mountain of Glaise and the Pointe aux Vaches which face the batture of the Pointe aux Vaches.
Visitors can take the rue des Pionniers which becomes the Chemin de la Rivière-du-Moulin-à-Baude to the Dunes De Sables belvedere to see the panorama of the river. Then, very close to the mouth of the Moulin-à-Baude river, hiking trails were created.
At low tide, the flats of Pointe aux Vaches in Tadoussac extend over 3.9 km (2.4 mi) on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River, between the mouth of the Saguenay (Pointe aux Vaches) and the delimiting the eastern part of La Grande Anse where the Grande Anse stream flows. A narrower sand area stretches as far as Cap de Bon-Désir, passing through the bay of Petites Bergeronnes and the bay of Grandes Bergeronnes.
