Sunderland is a city in Tyne and Wear in northeast England, with a population of 171,000 in 2021.  It's industrial, but has lost traditional trades such as shipbuilding, and is still re-inventing itself. The National Glass Centre celebrates the town's former status as a prominent glass-making community.


Understand[edit]
Bridges over the River Wear
Sunderland grew up around the estuary of the River Wear when three medieval villages combined. Monkwearmouth on the north bank had a monastery from 674 AD; its abbot encouraged glass-making, founding an industry for the next 1300 years. The monastery was home to the Venerable Bede, who wrote that he was "ácenned on sundorlande"  - born in a sundered or separate land of that monastery on the south bank. This became Sunderland and outgrew Monkwearmouth and the third settlement of Bishopwearmouth further upriver. Early industry was based on fishing, salt-panning, coal-mining, shipbuilding and breaking, glass-making, and sea trade. By the 19th century the conurbation was sprawling and squalid, and in 1831 it was the first place in Britain to be struck by the cholera pandemic, which inexorably spread across the nation. The three traditional parish administrations were overwhelmed and this was the prompt for creating the combined borough of Sunderland in 1835.
Shipbuilding was already declining in the Victorian era, and other industries crumbled in the 20th century. Sunderland has diversified, and regenerated the brownfield sites, but this remains a work in progress. It hasn't been able to re-launch itself as a destination city like Newcastle, unemployment is high, and in 2016 the city voted 61% in favour of Brexit. Geographically it was in County Durham until in 1974 the new metropolis of Tyne and Wear was created, also containing Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead.
To the outsider, the local accent is Geordie (which extends from industrial Northumberland down into Durham), but it's a shibboleth to say so. Since the 1980s the term "Mackem" is sometimes used by Sunderland folk to describe themselves. The difference in dialect is subtle: the most intensive study of it was in the 1970s when a taped phone call led police to believe the "Yorkshire Ripper" serial killer (Peter Sutcliffe 1946-2020) was from hereabouts. He was actually from Yorkshire, and with benefit of hindsight, perhaps his nickname was a clue.
Famous people from Sunderland include the actor James Bolam (b 1935), the vet and author James Herriot (pen name of James Alfred Wight, 1916–1995), the explorer and archaeologist Gertrude Bell (1868-1926), singer Bryan Ferry (b 1945), pioneer railway developer George Hudson (1800-1871), goalkeeper Jordan Pickford (b 1994), football player and manager Bob Paisley (1919-1996), cricketer Bob Willis (1949-2019), cookery author Jane Grigson (1928-1990) and monastic author the Venerable Bede (672-735). Those who stayed awhile include the artist LS Lowry, author Lewis Carroll, Lola Montez (it's best to draw a veil over her lurid career) and astronomer William Herschel, who didn't find Uranus here but fortunately kept looking.
