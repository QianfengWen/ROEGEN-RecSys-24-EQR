History[edit]
Rockledge Drive Residential District
Settlers gave the town its name due to regional coquina rock found along the coast. Gardner Hardee and Cephas Magruder were early settlers; Magruder arrived in the 1870s and built one of the town's historic houses. The city was incorporated in 1887 as "Rock Ledge" to become Brevard County's first municipality.
Agriculture (citrus) and tourism were factors in the local economy's development, as the Intracoastal Waterway was (and remains) a major draw. President Grover Cleveland visited the city in 1888. The permanent population of the town was a mere 200, but this increased by a factor of ten each winter due to tourism. Steamboats and train routes brought tourists thanks to the efforts of Henry Flagler. The construction of the Dixie Freeway in 1915 brought tourists to the region by automobile, and it was paved during the next decade and routed as US-1.
A series of development projects would see the city's evolution into its current form. A hospital was built on a former golf course just before the U.S. entered World War II, and during the Baby Boom after the war, construction of housing developments began, continuing throughout the rest of the 20th century. The construction of the nearby Kennedy Space Center contributed to the town's population and economy, and a locally significant nursery, the Rockledge Gardens, was opened in 1962. Apart from these gardens, much of the former agricultural land was replaced by housing, and today, Rockledge is a suburban community of Melbourne to the south and the Canaveral region to the northeast.

Climate[edit]
There are two major seasons which characterize the area. One is hot and rainy, lasting from June until late September. The other is the dry season, October through May, brings more moderate temperatures and less frequent rainfall.
