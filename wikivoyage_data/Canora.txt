Canora is in east central Saskatchewan and was founded along the tracks of the Canadian Northern Railway, one of the companies that evolved into the Canadian National Railway (CN). The area around Canora was settled by Europeans in the late 19th century by Doukhobors, Romanians, and Ukrainians. The first Ukrainian block settlement in Saskatchewan was established in 1897 when 150 families arrived in the Canora District from Western Ukraine.  In 1904, the Canadian Northern Railway laid tracks through the area and a year later, in 1905, Canora was incorporated the site of the train station. 
The name Canora, is derived from the first two letters of the words "Canadian Northern Railway."
