Panimbang is a small town and district on the west coast of Banten province, in the Western Java region of Indonesia. The district also includes the Tanjung Lesung peninsula.


Understand[edit]
Tanjung Lesung.
The district of Panimbang is in the regency of Pandeglang, about 50 km southwest of the regency capital Pandeglang. The district spreads along the Teluk Lada ("Pepper Bay"), with the peninsula of Tanjung Lesung in the western part, and the main town and villages mostly on the southeastern side of the bay. The small island Pulau Liwungan, with a dense forest and only one house on it, is in the middle of the bay. The region is well-known for its beaches, although because of its remoteness it is visited less than beaches more to the north, such as Anyer.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Panimbang is on the trunk road along the western coast, that runs from Cilegon via Anyer and Labuan to Panimbang, and further to the south coast. At the village of Citeureup in Panimbang district, the road splits, with a smaller road continuing to the Tanjung Lesung peninsula and to Ujung Kulon National Park. The easiest way to get to Panimbang from the capital Jakarta is by taking the Jakarta-Merak toll road until exit Serang Timur (East Serang). From there, the road leads via Pandeglang and Labuan to Panimbang. Without traffic, the drive from Jakarta takes about 3.5 hours. However, due to traffic congestion this is usually 4.5 to 5 hours.

By bus[edit]
A new bus terminal has been developed in Panimbang in 2016. It serves mainly angkots (minivans) to nearby towns such as Labuan, and to the holiday resort of Tanjung Lesung peninsula.To get to Panimbang by public transport from Jakarta, take a bus from Kalideres bus terminal in West Jakarta to Labuan, and then change to a local angkot.
