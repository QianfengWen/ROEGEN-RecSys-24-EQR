Auki (sometimes as "Aoke") is a town in the Solomon Islands and is the provincial capital of Malaita Province. As of 2021, it has a population of 7,882.


Understand[edit]
Auki is the capital of Malaita Island and has been since 1920. While this town is not well known outside of Oceania, it does not mean there's no beauty here. Surrounding Auki to the coast is a beautiful, stunning harbour and has a decent variety of shops, restaurants and motels for a town of its size.

Get in[edit]
Ferry to Honiara
Map of Auki
By car[edit]
There is a direct road from Gwanaruu and Bila. While the road does go north of Gwanaruu, it is not well maintained.

By ferry[edit]
This runs most days from Honiara Wharf to Auki on the island of Malaita across the Slot from Honiara. In 2012 the fare as SI$300 one way or SI$580 return. The ferry travels through the Florida Islands channel which is worth seeing and there's a high chance you'll see plenty of flying fish if you look off the front or sides of the boat. The catamaran ferry is a former Auckland Harbour ferry so is not designed to be ocean-going. This means that when it's rough, it's rough so be prepared. The ferry has plenty of comfortable seating, air conditioning and a big flat screen which shows films during the journey. You can buy drinks and snacks on the ferry although it's best to buy this on the way out from Honiara as supplies run low once the boat is heading back. There is a toilet.
Boarding is at 07:30 for an 08:00 departure. Buy your ticket from a vehicle parked outside the jetty gate in the wharf car park. It'll be the one swamped with people getting tickets at 07:30. Boat stops in Tulagi (09:30) in Florida Islands and leaves ten minutes later for Boromole (arr. 10:30) which has a beautiful beach and water. It reaches Auki at 12:30 and leaves to return to Honiara via the same route at 14:00 (boarding from 13:30). Return to Boromole is 15:30 and Tulagi at 04:30 before arrival in Honiara at sunset or around 18:00.

Get around[edit]
To get around, the best way is to walk or go by bike if you brought it. You'd not want to go by car since the road is poorly maintained, so badly to the fact that walking even in the heat is more enjoyable.
