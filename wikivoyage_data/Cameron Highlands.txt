A tea plantation at the Cameron Highlands
The Cameron Highlands are in Pahang, Peninsular Malaysia. It is approximately 85 km from Ipoh or about 200 km from Kuala Lumpur. The retreat has a diverse population of more than 43,000 people.


Understand[edit]
The Cameron Highlands is one of Malaysia's most extensive hill stations. It covers an area of 712 km², about the size of Singapore, At 5,000 ft (1,500 m) above sea level it is also the highest point in Malaysia accessible by road. The British surveyor, Sir William Cameron, was credited with "discovering" the highlands during a mapping expedition of the Pahang-Perak border area in 1885. The area developed starting in the 1920s when it was confirmed that many varieties of fruits and vegetables, including tea, can be grown. Tea was the main reason for the development of this area by the British. Additionally, many British settlers came to this area as a "retreat" from the hot, humid climate of the rest of Malaysia. After years of extensive work in difficult conditions, a road was built linking Tapah and Tanah Rata, allowing the settlement of the highlands. Following this, tea planters and vegetable growers who found the climate suitable for their crops moved in the highlands. Today, there are four main roads into the area: two to the west, to Ipoh and to Tapah; and two to the east, to Gua Musang and Kuala Lipis.
Climate is extremely mild for Malaysian standards: the mean annual temperature is 18 °C. During the day, the temperature seldom rises above 25 °C; at night, it can drop to as low as 12 °C.
Overall, much of the retreat is still forested (estimated at 71 percent) and hosts a rich ecosystem. Please refer to #See for more information on the wildlife in the Cameron Highlands. There are eight mountains at the retreat. They are Mount (Malay: Gunung) Batu Brinchang (2,031 m), Mount Berembun (1,840 m), Mount Irau (2,091 m), Mount Jasar (1,696 m), Mount Mentigi (1,563 m), Mount Perdah (1,576 m) and Mount Siku (1,916 m). Jungle trails lead visitors to scenic spots, waterfalls and aboriginal villages.

Towns[edit]
Map of Cameron Highlands
The towns lie in a string of settlements approximately 25 km long. From north to south these are:

 Kampung Raja - one of the larger towns; close to the roads to Ipoh and Gua Musang
 Brinchang - Starting point to Gunung Brinchang (2032 m), Boh tea plantations and numerous farms (strawberries!)
 Taman Tringkap
 Kea Farm
 Tanah Rata - the main town of the Camerons, favorite of backpackers. Starting point to Gunung Beremban (1840 m), Bharat tea plantations, and the majority of the numbered hiking trails
 Ringlet - one of the larger towns; close to the roads to Tapah and Kuala Lipis
 Bertam Valey
Get in[edit]
The highlands can be accessed by road from both coasts, though most travellers enter from the west. Ipoh has a road up to the highlands via Simpang Pulai, the other route from the west is further south, via Tapah. The main road from the east passes through Gua Musang; there is also a more circuitous route from Kuala Lipis (both of which are on the Jungle Railway).

By bus[edit]
Approaching from the west[edit]
From Ipoh, take an air-conditioned PerakTransit bus service (Stall D2, RM20, 2-3hr, 8:30AM, 10AM 11:30AM, 12:30 PM 3PM, 5PM, 7PM) to Tanah Rata from Ipoh's Amanajaya bus terminal (10 km from the city center). You can get there from Medan Kidd bus terminal near the train station, by taking either the T30a, T30b or 116 bus (1.80 RM every 30min). The buses to the highlands travel via Simpang Pulai and stop at towns such as Kampong Raja and Brinchang. Be sure to let the driver know if you need one of these towns.
From Kuala Lumpur, buses to Tanah Rata leave from Terminal Bersepadu Selatan (RM30-RM39, 4½ hr, 8:30AM–3:30PM though mainly in the morning). Some buses can be booked online.
From Penang, Unititi Express  bus picks up passengers from Prangin Mall in Georgetown to Tanah Rata for RM35 (7:15AM and 1:30PM). However, the bus from Tanah Rata to Penang (RM32, 8AM and 2:30PM) will stop at Sungai Nibong and you might need to take a local bus or a taxi to Georgetown.
From Singapore, overnight VIP buses operated by Grassland and Fivestar leave from the Golden Mile tower/complex (SG$55-SG$65, 10 hr). Buses stop at Ringlet, Lakehouse, Brinchang Hotel, Equatorial Hotel, Heritage Hotel and Tanah Rata.

Approaching from the east[edit]
From Taman Negara: It is actually possible to go to Cameron Highlands from Taman Negara using only local buses. The best option is to leave the National Park with the first bus going to Jerantut and ask the driver/ticket seller the way to Cameron Highland. But the journey is pretty much :
Kuala Tahn to Jerantut RM7; 10AM. Jerantut to Benta RM7; Benta to Raub RM5.25. Raub to Tanah Rata RM12 (Cameron Highlands). You will be in Cameron Highlands by the end of day.

As of in December 2019, the Jerantut to Benta bus has been cancelled. Take a taxi to Raub to catch the 3PM bus, or a taxi to Kuala Lipis to catch the 1PM bus from there to Raub.
This is a long journey with several connections but could suit some travellers as the total price of the journey is around RM30, compared to the RM90 asked by private mini-van companies.

By car[edit]
From North-South Expressway, exit the expressway at Tapah and then proceed via route 59 straight to the highlands. It takes about 1 hr 30 min to reach the first town of Ringlet.
Alternatively, you can exit the expressway at Simpang Pulai, Ipoh and proceed via route 145 to Cameron Highlands. It takes about 1 hr to reach the first town, Kampung Raja. Condition of this route is significantly better than Route 59 from Tapah.

By shuttle mini van[edit]
You can also use mini van transfer to get to Cameron Highlands:

From Kuala Lumpur-pick up at Swiss Inn, Jl. Sultan, Chinatown. Noon daily RM35, duration: 4½ hr
From Penang-pick up at Georgetown, 8AM daily RM50, duration: 4½ hr
From Taman Negara-pick up at Kuala Tembeling Jetty. RM85, duration: 5½ hr

 Kang Tours & Travel, ☏ +60 5 491 5823. 
By taxi[edit]
Tyeere is a taxi station about 100 m east of the bus station along Jalan Besar road. Taxi fares are subject to negotiation as most of the taxi drivers are notorious for not using the meters. Be prepared to negotiate hard.

Get around[edit]
The resort is made up of eight neighbourhoods. The three townships are Ringlet, Tanah Rata and Brinchang. The five settlements are the Bertam Valley, Kea Farm, Tringkap, Kuala Terla and Kampung Raja. All are separated from one another by a considerable distance. The most popular towns of the retreat are Tanah Rata and Brinchang. They are about 4 km apart.

Walking[edit]
One of the best ways to see the area is to walk. Each town is easily walkable, and many of the trailheads are easily reached by walking from Tanah Rata. It should be possible to walk from town to town too if you have a lot of time on your hands. Do bring along an umbrella or rain poncho, because it rains frequently here, and when it rains, it pours.

By bus[edit]
Tourist bus
The bus station is at Tanah Rata.
Local buses in the highlands have stopped but have been replaced by company-owned tourist buses running every two hours between Tanah Rata and Kampung Raja. It stops in Brinchang, Kea Farm, Tringkap and Kuala Terla but you can ask the driver to drop you where you want along the main road. From Tanah Rata, departures are from 6:30AM to 6:30PM. Returns from Kampung Raja are scheduled from 7:30AM to 7:30PM. The fare is about RM2-5 depending on the distance.

By car[edit]
The resort has a good network of roads. If you are planning to get off the beaten track, renting a car may be a good option.

By motorcycle[edit]
Motorcycles can be rented at some of the guest houses and in Tanah Rata city centre. You must have a licence to ride a motorcycle. Be extra careful while driving: e.g., when taking a blind corner don't assume some lunatic won't be in your lane overtaking someone.

By taxi[edit]
Taxis can be rented by the hour mostly from Tanah Rata. As at July 2022, the rate is rm30 per hour.

By van charter[edit]
You can plan an itinerary of your own by hiring a 10-seater van. Make sure you confirm the charges before making any decisions.

Nature and wildlife[edit]
Main street in Tanah Rata
The Cameron Highlands are home to a wide variety of flora and fauna. It is estimated that more than 700 species of plants grow here. During trekking to one of the local mount (or Gunung in Malay) you will observe the vegetation change with the elevation. The most famous plant in the highland is without doubt the Rafflesia which is native to the Cameron Highlands. The plant has no stems, leaves or true roots. It is noted for producing the largest individual flower on earth. These attract a lot of tourists and remember to be very careful around these flowers as all of the known species of Rafflesia are threatened or endangered.
In addition to the vegetation, the highlands is the habitat to a large number of animals, birds, insects and reptiles. If you are lucky you may even see some monkeys (White-thighed langurs can be spotted on trail 7).

4.5174101.383081 Gunung (Mount) Brinchang. At 6,666 ft (2,032 m) above sea level, this is the highest point in Malaysia which is accessible by car. At the top of the mountain is a radio and television station. Close to the installation is a 15 m high "Observation Tower". This is the best place to get a good view of the Cameron Highlands and the neighbouring state of Perak. Reached by trekking up Trail 1 or by road. The taxi fare to the summit and back can amount to as much as RM100. Before heading this way, it would be wise to negotiate with the taxi driver to see if the trip could include a visit to the nearby Mossy Forest and the Boh Tea plantation which is in Sungei Palas. As of Oct 2018, access to the summit is no longer allowed. Apparently a telecom company bought the land and closed it from public access. (updated Jun 2017)
Example of a mossy forest near the top of Gunung Berembun (Trail 3)
4.52533101.38052 Mossy Forest. There is a boardwalk at the top of Gunung (Mount) Brinchang which takes you through the Mossy Forest. This reserve is unlike any other in peninsular Malaysia: its base is covered with a thick carpet of moss. Most of the trees here have remained untouched for centuries. Be prepared to spend a considerable amount of time exploring this place. As of June 2018 most of the ground moss is gone and it's quite a disappointing experience. But the viewpoint tower can be worth a visit. From there, Trail 14 starts and takes you to Gunung Irau (Track 14 is closed since 7 Feb 2018 until further notice due to landslides) (updated Jun 2017)
4.475333101.3814783 Parit Waterfall. There are two ways to get to the waterfall: you could either start from the Forestry Department or take Trail 4 which is at the side of the Century Pines Resort. If you opt for the former, you should reach the falls in less than an hour. For the latter, the journey is about 15 min. (updated Jun 2017)
4.46467101.386674 Robinson Waterfall. The falls are a short distance from Tanah Rata. It could be reach via Path 9. (See section. #Stay Safe for trail 9.) (updated Jun 2017)
 Rafflesia Flower. The largest flower in the world (actually an external parasitic plant, lacking leaves, stem or roots). The only way to see this plant is to join guided tour which comes with 4WD transport as it is located in Blue Valley are which is around 1 hr drive from Cameron Highlands town. Also, since each plant only blooms for 4-5 days a year, you need the knowledge of if and where a plant has bloomed. 
Tea plantations[edit]
4.448375101.423075 Boh Tea Centre and Sg Palas Plantation (follow the main road from Brinchang towards Kg Raja. After the Equatorial Hotel, look for signs and then turn left into the narrow hill road. The junction faces a row of stalls selling fruits and vegetables from the Kea Farm and can be easily missed.). 8AM-4:30PM. Operated by Malaysia's largest tea company. Tours available of tea factory. Interactive educational studio, a retail outlet, and a nice cafe. Stunning vistas of rolling hills amidst a carefully tendered tea plantation. The drive up the hill can be very narrow at stages, so caution should be shown when driving up. The view from the top of nearby hill at the plantation is well worth the effort of climbing up. Free tours. (updated Mar 2017)
4.45409101.3686166 Cameron Bharat Tea Plantation (Tanah Rata, toward Ringlet). Second largest producer of tea in Malaysia. You can walk around the plantations and take photos. There is a cafe from where you can have a breathtaking view of the tea plantation. Free tours. (updated Jun 2017)
Museums and religious sites[edit]
4.488543101.3906967 Sam Poh Temple (south of Binchang). If you are tired of hiking, Sam Poh is worth the visit. Built in 1972, it is the 4th largest Buddhist temple in the country. (updated Jun 2017)
4.497194101.3951578 Time Tunnel – The Local Museum (located within the Kok Lim Strawberry Farm), ☏ +60 16 3288 438, +60 13 5247 120. 9AM-6PM. The Time Tunnel is Malaysia's first memorabilia "museum". It is recognised as one of the main attractions of the Cameron Highlands. The galleria is filled with objects de art that showcase what life was like in Malaysia after the Japanese occupation. Apart from collectibles and memorabilia, there is also an assortment of old photographs on display here – most dating back to the post-war years. The "museum" is open daily from 9AM-6PM. There are no restrictions to photography at the gallery. The entrance fee is RM5 for adults and RM3 for children. There is ample parking available at the complex. RM5 (RM3 child). 
Gardens and farms[edit]
4.467933101.3849519 Malaysian Agriculture Research and Development Institute (MARDI) (Agro-technology Park) (opposite Tanah Rata Hospital). 8:45AM-5PM. Research and educational center. Mardi is home to 40 varieties of roses, 10 strawberries, 100 citrus fruits and exhibits a rich collection of hydroponic technique for agriculture. There are a couple of cafes inside. Trail 5 starts here. Outside gardens are free but entrance is RM5. (updated Jun 2017)
 Robinson Rose Garden, Rose Centre & Rose Valley. All three estates are worth a visit. Here you can see how roses are grown. 
 Butterfly Garden/Butterfly Farm, 43rd Milestone, Kea Farm, Brinchang (5 km northwards of Brinchang on the main road). 9AM-6PM. Located next to each other with similar exhibitions of many butterfly and insect species to see. Very interesting is insect garden, where a friendly staff takes the insect off and you can take photos with the leaf insect, stick insect and other creatures on your hand. There are no restrictions to photography. The entrance fee is RM5 for adults and RM3 for children. RM5. 
Do[edit]
Several tour operators have offices on or near the main road in Tanah Rata. The packages (jungle trekking, farm adventure, go to Ipoh to see Kellie's Castle, etc.) and prices are all very similar, but ask about extra charges like admission to the museums and to see the Rafflesia. Morning and afternoon tours are very popular. Night tours are listed by most operators but are not popular so don't expect them to be available unless you're in a group of 4 people (or 3 at some).

Trekking[edit]
Signage during trekking on Trail 7
Trekking is one of the main activities in Cameron Highlands. Trail maps are available from the tourist information centers (free and non-free). None of the available maps are exactly correct, but the trails are well marked and a guide is by no means necessary. The most accurate map is the one on OpenStreetMap (free offline map). You can download it and use a GPS device (your smartphone) to see where you are. Most of the trails have yellow signages with annotations from fellow trekkers (see photo) and the path is usually marked with plastic tape.
Information on jungle trekking and each trail can be found here and there. See #Stay Safe for tips before trekking.

4.5046101.387931 Trail 1 (Finding the path can be a bit confusing as the sign is about 10 m from the main road. Ask for directions to the army base and follow the road to the end. From there you will find clear signs for the path. Alternative start: Look for a rickety wooden ladder around 50 m downhill from a red sign close to the army base, check OpenStreetMap via the app OsmAnd or Mapy.cz for exact location.). The peak at 2,032 m, which can be reached by walking 'Trail 1' from Brinchang. There are conflicting reports on whether the trailhead is open or closed, and one visitor in April 2019 mentioned that there is a mudslide that requires some crawling to detour around. The walk to the top normally takes 2-2½ hr. It is an easy path to follow if you know how to look for colored ribbons, and it is perfectly possible to do this trek without a guide. The trek is not very steep but you need to be in decent shape. Gunung Brinchang is a part of the most popular tours so expect to find lots of tourists at the top. After reaching the top, follow the road for another 6 km down to reach the main road, where you will find the 'boh' tea plantation. From there you can take the hourly bus back to Brinchang. As of July 2019, the government has closed the trail and is guiding visitors to the commercial mossy forest. Some hikers are continuing to find their way in. On the top it’s closed off with a gate, so you either have to walk up as the same route down, or climb the gate (with barbed wire). (updated Jul 2019)
4.4893101.39112 Trail 2 - Tough (start in Brinchang at Sam Poh Buddhist Temple.). The trail merges later with Trail 3. Quite steep and not well indicated. 
4.4828101.3853 Trail 3 - To Gunung Berembun - Moderate to Tough (start at Arcadia Cottage near the golf course). The Gunung Berembun at 1,840 m is overgrown and offers little view over the valley. Still the trail is wide and clearly defined. It takes you through the jungle with a couple of stream crossings. The end near the summit is a bit steep. I would advise reaching Gunung Berembun via trail 7 and come down via trail 3 as trail 7 is much more difficult and step than trail 3. A round trip from trail 7 to trail 3 takes about 4 hr. 
4.4793101.38284 Trail 4 - To Parit Waterfall - Easy (start near the Forestry Department). Easy and mostly paved trail to the Parit Waterfall, though as of May 2019 there were a few small fallen trees across the path. The river and the waterfall are nothing to write about except that they are filled with garbage. Can be a nicer way than the road to go back to Tanah Rata after Trail 3. A small part of the trail looping around the waterfall is closed due to a damaged footbridge at the Cameron Highlands Montane Park, but you can just take the other way (to the left of the closed bridge if you're coming through the park). (updated May 2019)
4.4703101.38675 Trail 5 - Easy to Moderate (start at MARDI (Malaysian Agriculture Research and Development Institute)). Trail 5 merges with Trail 3 on the way up to Gunung Berembun or down to the golf course. 
4.4799101.38516 Trail 6 - Moderate to Tough. There seem to be two different trails called Trail 6, both labeled as such on OpenStreetMap. The one on tourist maps runs between Bharat Tea Plantation and the summit of Gunung Jasar, but the maps themselves say it's not well marked. A trekker's note at the junction with Trail 10 points the way and says it takes about 2 hours to hike down to the tea plantation, but doesn't call the trail No. 6. Official trail signs, on the other hand, also use "Path No. 6" to refer to the trail linking the Forestry Department to Trail 3 east of Tanah Ratah. This trail seems to be better, though we only had time to try a part of it. (updated May 2019)
4.4693101.38717 Trail 7 - To Gunung Berembun - Moderate to Tough (start at MARDI (Malaysian Agriculture Research and Development Institute)). The first 300 m are very overgrown (watch out for ticks). Later the path widen and become very pleasant and well marked. The end is steep until it merges with trail 3 to the summit. 
4.4641101.3888 Trail 8 - To Gunung Berembun - very Tough (start from the Robinson Waterfall). Very difficult trail (climb?) until it merges with trail 3 and 7 to the summit of Gunung Berembun. 
4.4657101.38589 Trail 9 and 9A- To the Bharat Plantations - Moderate (start near the Robinson Waterfall). This trail is not recommended as robberies have been reported in 2016 (stopped apparently in 2017?) See #Stay Safe for more information. 
4.4727101.369910 Trail 10 - To Gunung Jasar - Moderate to Tough (starts next to Tan's Camellia Garden, behind H2O Apartments and Highland Villa Resort). Day hike. Takes you through an ancient mossy forest (~1½ hr to Jasar). As of May 2019, the trail to the summit is open, though you apparently need to walk across the cement at the base of the radio tower to pick the trail back up on the other side (to your right). After the summit, the trail continues northeast along a ridge (right along the boundary between Pahang and Perak states, in fact, as testified to by official markers along the path) and drops you at a power station, where you have to walk around the outside edge of the fence to get to the road. It's a bit of a walk to get back to town.The first half of the trail to the summit is wide and easy to follow, except for the confusing part near the radio tower, but has some quite steep sections (no ropes or climbing necessary, just scrambling up tree roots). The second half, from the summit to the power station, isn't steep but does have some narrower, semi-overgrown parts. There are also a few potentially-confusing forks in the path here, but pay attention to the markers other hikers have left and you should be fine. Near the end there is a side path leading steeply down to the right, marked with two yellow ribbons, which may or may not be a worthwhile shortcut down to the power station. (updated May 2019)
4.4746101.36611 Trail 11. This trail was closed due to landslides in 2017, but it is open and fully walkable. It can be walked from beginning until the end, even though OsmAnd or Mapy.cz say you can’t. Not a very scenic hike though. (updated Jul 2019)
4.48465101.3701112 Trail 12 - permanently closed. (updated May 2019)
4.468452101.37402613 Trail 13 - To Gunung Mentigi - Moderate (behind Cameronian Holiday Inn). It is closed for construction developments. (updated Jul 2019)
4.5254101.380214 Trail 14 - To Gunung Irau - Moderate - Closed since 2 Feb 2018 (starts at the end of the Mossy Forest boardwalk). Gunung Irau is the highest peak of the Cameron Highlands. The trail takes you through the Mossy forest. Can be very challenging and muddy after rainfalls. The track has been closed since 7 Feb 2018 due to landslides. (updated Jun 2018)

Tea[edit]
