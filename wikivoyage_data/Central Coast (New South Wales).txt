Understand[edit]
A quiet semi-rural region between the cities of Sydney and Newcastle, it represents a great way to get away from the busy Sydney life without having to journey very far. It takes about 90 minutes to drive through when there is no traffic. It contains many suburban areas as well as numerous reserves and national parks.
The area's traditional owners, the Guringai and Darkinjung people, were among the first encountered by the British settlers. As travel between Sydney and Newcastle was mostly done by sea, the early colony only had smaller settlements. The Great Northern Road, built by convict labour, was completed in 1836 and opened the area up to more development thereafter.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
You can take the Pacific Motorway (M1) from Sydney, and exit at Gosford, Ourimbah, Tuggerah or Toukley exits depending on what part of the Central Coast you wish to go to.  The trip from the start of the freeway at the north of Sydney will take around half an hour to the start of the Central Coast.

By train[edit]
The coastal areas of the Central Coast are well served by the NSW TrainLink network, which is a very economical way to visit the area. Trains from the Central station in Sydney direct to the Central Coast depart approximately every 30 minutes. The main stations are Woy Woy, Gosford, Tuggerah and Wyong. Journeys are on the Opal card and cost between $5 and $8 one way. The journey can take anywhere between 1.5 and 2 hours.

By ferry[edit]
Ettalong is accessible by ferry from Palm Beach in Sydney with the passenger ferry crossing the Hawkesbury river every hour or so.  Buses run from the Wynyard and Manly to Palm Beach.  Bikes are allowed on the ferry.  The enthusiastic travel-planner can do a round trip back by bus and train. On the western end, there's car ferries from Wisemans Ferry which operate every few minutes.

By bus[edit]
CDC NSW operates bus route 592 from Hornsby, Asquith, Mount Colah, Mount Kuring-gai, Berowra, Cowan and Hawkesbury River stations to Mooney Mooney and Cheero Point in the Central Coast. There are also buses from Newcastle.

By car[edit]
As you head out of Sydney into the surrounding bushland, you may think you have left the city behind for the country roads; however, the Central Coast can have traffic and be just as busy as Sydney and Newcastle.  Major roads criss-cross the area.

By bus[edit]
Buses on the Central Coast are privately run under contract, and are integrated into the Sydney ticketing and information system.  You can get timetable information from Google Maps.

By bike[edit]
See also: Cycling in New South Wales
There are some areas with well developed bicycle facilities, particularly between Woy Woy and Gosford, but some roads are busy multi-lane roads only for road warriors.  Check out the normal bicycle maps sources (Local Council websites, Open Cycle Map, Google Maps) to plan your route.

By train[edit]
The coastal train stops at most major settlements along the Central Coast, and runs frequently throughout the day.

-33.401151.272 Somersby Falls, Somersby Falls Rd, Somersby (8 km (5.0 mi) NW of Gosford, drive or taxi as there's no public transport available). Seeing the waterfalls in their full glory involves a picturesque walk down into the valley. There are three tiers of falls (top, middle and bottom) though the topmost is not very substantial. The path to the middle falls is safe with the stairs having railing all the way down. The descent to the bottom tier however, requires you to descend on shaky, rocky slabs which are often slippery and not always stable. It may be risky for the elderly or others with health and fitness concern to tread on these rocks. In any case, make sure to wear shoes with good grip. Once there, it’s only a 300 m walk to the bottom. Looking at the falls and using the accompanying picnic area are both free. Parking right next to the falls costs $8. Parking further out on the road is free though you'll have to walk bit more. (updated Apr 2021)
