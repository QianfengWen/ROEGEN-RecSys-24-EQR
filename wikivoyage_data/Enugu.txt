Enugu is the capital of Enugu State in Southeast Nigeria. Industries in the city include the urban market and bottling industries. Enugu is also one of the filming locations for directors of the Nigerian movie industry, dubbed "Nollywood".


Understand[edit]
The name Enugu is derived from the Igbo words "Hill top". It is nicknamed Coal City mainly because of the discovery of coal on the plateau of the city in 1909 . Enugu developed rapidly as a result of the completion of the railway from the port in 1916.  Enugu is  located at the foot of the Udi Plateau. The area is on the railway from Port Harcourt, some 150 miles (240 km) south-southwest  and at the junction of roads from Onitsha, Aba and Abakaliki.

Unregistered taxis are known as Kabu Kabu and are differentiated with registered ones through the lack of yellow paint on the unregistered vehicles.

Two important Igbo traditional festivals take place in Enugu annually; the Mmanwu festival and the New yam festival.

This festival is held at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium as a parade of carnival-like masquerades that are accompanied by music and it is supported by the Enugu Council of Arts and Culture.

Stay safe[edit]
Enugu State is one of the safest states to be in Nigeria. 

Connect[edit]
For most locations in the city of Enugu, there is coverage of the 2G/3G/4G mobile networks, but signal strength usually diminishes further away from the city center, and you might occasionally experience network outage for all or some of the mobile phone service providers in the remote areas of the city. Different networks tend to be more stable and reliable in different locations of the city at different times. 
If you are planning a visit to Enugu, like many other places in Nigeria, you should probably consider having multiple SIM cards, preferably for all the mobile service providers, since you can't tell which will be more stable and reliable at a time in your location during your visit. And if you will risk not having any of them, you might be better off not risking the MTN network, because, from indications, it seem to perform well than the others, though its rates may be high and its offers and services might be stringent, but you are less likely to be concerned of erratic voice and data connection compared to others.
Airtel is another service provider which is fairly satisfactory for all you might need to connect to the world, including rates and network stability. Of course, Glo (or Globacom) boasts of fast network speed for internet browsing activities, only that you might not be able to enjoy the privilege in some locations.  And 9Mobile (formerly Etisalat) usually also performs well in internet browsing speed too but with locational limitations, plus that data rate is fairly higher.
