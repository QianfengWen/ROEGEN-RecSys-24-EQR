Mystic is a village that is partly in Groton and partly in Stonington in Connecticut. It is a major tourist destination.

Charles W. Morgan

Understand[edit]
Mystic is a popular tourist destination because of Mystic Seaport, Mystic Aquarium, the touristy shopping downtown, and its maritime heritage. It is home to many marinas, historic ship-captain's homes, galleries, and traditional boats offering day-sails. Between New York City and Boston, it's easily reachable from both. Mystic is also near Foxwoods Casino.
