Geography[edit]
It is in the regional county municipality (RCM) of La Côte-de-Beaupré, in the administrative region of Capitale-Nationale. The village borders the St. Lawrence River and faces Île d'Orléans.
Besides the main village of Château-Richer, the various hamlets are: Petit-Pré (near the limit of L'Ange-Gardien), Rivière-Cazeau, Lemoyne, Sault-à-la-Puce, Périgny (near Sainte- Anne-de-Beaupré), Sainte-Anne West, Saint-Achille-de-Montmorency and Saint-Ignace. The vast majority of residents live on the strip along the north shore of the St. Lawrence River, along routes 360 and 138.
The majority of the municipal territory is mountainous and forested. Château-Richer stands in an agricultural area (between the forest and Route 138) and forest which is hilly with the foothills of the Laurentians in the background. The northern part of the territory is drained by the Saint-Adolphe Nord-Est River (a tributary of the Saint-Adolphe River). The central part is drained by the Montmorency River. The tributaries of the Île d'Orléans channel are: Rivière du Petit Pré, Rivière Cazeau, Sault à la Puce River, Dogs River and the river Le Moyne; while the Rivière la Retenue is a tributary of the Ferry River.

History[edit]
From the beginning of New France, after the founding of Quebec in 1608, the Côte-de-Beaupré was colonized between the Montmorency River and Cap Tourmente. In 1626, Samuel de Champlain established the first farm in the St. Lawrence Valley in Château-Richer. The first source using "Château-Richer" is the map of Jean Bourdon in 1641; it referred to the cape and the prominence on which the current church stands. Twenty concessions were granted in 1646. With the arrival of new settlers, agriculture and forestry then became the fundamental engines of the local economy. Nevertheless, the inhabitants devote themselves in particular to hunting, fishing, crafts, river transport and the fur trade.
The parish of Château-Richer was incorporated in 1678 under the name of La Visitation-de-Notre-Dame. In 1753, the village was organized into a municipality. The parish municipality was originally incorporated in 1845, then abolished in 1847; it was reconstituted in 1855, after the end of the seigneurial regime in Quebec. The territory became a city in 1968.

Eat[edit]

Since March 2020, in the context of health measures resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic, several restaurants or dining rooms in the Quebec City region have transformed the mode of meals at the tables into take-out or delivery service. In general, restaurateurs have demonstrated great resilience by updating their website, integrating interactive and automated applications for remote orders, as well as the display of the menu, opening hours, their mode of operation (e.g. by reservation, drive-through service), required health measures (e.g., vaccination record, mask, distancing), other services (e.g., caterer, shops, accommodation, access for disabled, wi-fi, take-out, delivery), contact details and often the history of the restaurant or site. Considering the evolving context of the pandemic and government measures, it is recommended that customers inquire with each establishment by consulting their respective website.
