Ilulissat (lit. "City of icebergs"; Danish: Jakobshavn) is the third largest city in Greenland, in the Disko Bay just by the icefjord, from which it got its name. Ilulissat has one of the most beautiful settings for a great Greenlandic experience.


Understand[edit]
Ilulissat is at the mouth of the Ilulissat Ice Fjord, which was included as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004. The town is next to the sea filled with icebergs from the most active glacier in the world, Sermeq Kujalleq. Excavations show that people have inhabited the area for thousands of years, and it was once the largest town in Greenland. The town is also known for having almost the same number of sled dogs as people: the town is home to 4,600 people and nearly 3,500 sled dogs.

By plane[edit]
69.241-51.0611 Ilulissat Airport (JAV  IATA). About 3 km (2 miles) from the centre of town. Passenger service (as of 2023) is provided by Air Greenland. Air Greenland flies domestically from Kangerlussuaq, Qaarsut, Aasiaat, Nuuk and Upernavik and internationally from Reykjavík-Keflavík. Icelandair also flies seasonally from Keflavík.

By boat[edit]
Arctic Umiaq Line sails to Ilulissat from South and West Greenland if the waters are safe.
Disko Line[dead link] sails around Disko Bay for other destinations. There are no roads outside communities. To get between communities, you have to go by air or boat. Disko Line operates scheduled boat transport among the settlements and communities on Disko Island and along the coast. They also offer a series of packaged and custom tourist boat tours.
Get around[edit]
You can walk around, or get a cab, if you're going to or from the airport, which is located a bit out of town.  However, most hotels will pick up and drop off guests at the airport.  The Hotel Arctic, which is furthest from the centre of town, offers regular van service to the city centre (it's a 20-minute walk should you prefer to go on foot.)
Watch for dogsled yield signs. Dogs are kept in many places around town, and sleds have right-of-way. They are fast and quiet, with dogs fanning out in front each on individual ropes. Pedestrians and drivers must beware.

The trekking route that starts from Ilulissat
69.158981-50.5064671 Ilulissat Ice Fjord. The main attraction is the Ilulissat Ice Fjord, a  UNESCO World Heritage Site. 35 km from the city is a glacier constantly delivering icebergs into the fjord. The speed of the glacier has increased from 22 m/day in 2002 to 35 m/day in 2007 as a result of global warming. The fjord is 500 m deep, so the iceberg floats to Ilulissat where they hit a barrier, as the fjord is only 250 m deep at the mouth of Disko Bay. So here the icebergs get stuck until enough ice has melted so the iceberg can pass the barrier. As 8/9 of an iceberg is below sea level you'll see a lot of icebergs 20 to 30 m high. The fjord can only be reached by foot or boat (or by helicopter). It's a fairly easy walk from the city and after 1-2 km, you'll see the icebergs - an impressive sight. You may take a 3-4 hours boat trip from the harbour - also a recommended tour.   (updated Jul 2018)
Museums[edit]
There are two museums in Ilulissat. The first is the Ilulissat Museum, which features exhibitions showcasing the life and expeditions of the explorer Knud Rasmussen. The second is the Inuit Art Museum, which features many paintings from Greenland, the Faroes and Denmark, with the most notable by Emanuel A. Peterson.

Icebergs[edit]
The sea surrounding Ilulissat is full of icebergs, mainly because of the proximity of the town to the Ilulissat Ice Fjord. the most active glacier in the world. The giant icebergs can be admired from shore or in local boats. These massive icebergs slowly drift out of the mouth of the fjord on their journey to the Atlantic.

Do[edit]
Beware of dogsled
If you walk south from the camping ground you will reach the coast at the mouth of the icefjord. West of Kællingekløften(Nakkarfik) you will be high above the water, but walking around to the east side you can climb all the way down to the water and sit and watch the nature in all its magnificence.

Attending a kaffemik (coffee gathering) is the best way to meet some of the locals, and they will be happy to invite you to one. Ilulissat and the surrounding settlements are all great places to score an invite to one of these, and the local tourist offices can help you attend one of these local social traditions.
The Ilulissat region is a great area to explore at sea, you can travel to either the nearby settlements or see the fjord and all of the icebergs in it. Travelers can also sail to Disko Island and see the majority of Disko Bay on the journey.
No winter or spring trip would be complete without a dogsled ride. Tours from one hour to ten days can be arranged with tour companies in town. Each sled will hold one or two passengers, not including the driver who will sometimes run alongside, sometimes ride on the back, and sometimes jump on to sit in front of you. Lyngmarks Glacier on Disko Island is the only place in Greenland where travelers can dog sled in the summer. Many local hunters will take tourist along with them on their dog sleds. The best way to arrange this is through the local tourist offices in Ilulissat.
There are many good hiking trails in and around Ilulissat. Travelers can hike through the mountains and around the lakes in the valley to the site where traces of the first humans in Greenland over 4,500 years ago have been found.
The Arctic palerfik is the ceremonial last dog sled trip of the winter season in Iluissat (before the sun gets too strong and snow starts melting), and takes place in March or April. Made up of a hundred sleds, each pulled by ten dogs, it's a terrific parade to witness for many travelers.
In the summer, Arctic midnight orienteering competitions are held in the midnight sun. This is an official Arctic championship and an unofficial Greenlandic championship held annually.

Stay safe[edit]
Melting ice can cause large and small tsunamis
In the summer, long trousers, long sleeves, a hat and a mosquito net are a must.
In the summer of 2007, a polar bear was seen some kilometres north of town. This was a major event as it was first time in 20 years a polar bear was seen in the area. Many of the local inhabitants surrounded the bear and it was soon decided that the bear was a threat. Consequently, the luckless bear was shot.

Go next[edit]
Like usual in Greenland, there aren't really any roads to anywhere. There's a hiking path to Oqaatsut, a 5-7 hour hike away, or a little less by kayak. Other than this, you can take the plane or boat to available destinations.
