Ogunquit is a seacoast town in Maine. The name is the Algonquin Indian word for "beautiful place by the sea". It features over three miles of beautiful sandy beach.


Understand[edit]
Ogunquit possesses a decent sized gay and lesbian population.  There is a  concentrated area of restaurants and shops near the intersection of Main Street and Shore Road, and access to the beach is nearby.  The town's sidewalks (where they exist) are packed with tourists on weekends during the summer.
Ogunquit has much to offer in terms of fresh seafood, fine dining and romantic restaurants, ice cream joints, beaches and an array of boutiques and shops.  You can find the standard tourist-y items as well as high quality art work, jewelry clothes and some shops that offer unique local shells and products.
Summer nights bring a bustling excitement to downtown Ogunquit and the trolleys are an enjoyable and convenient form of transportation throughout the day.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Portland International Jetport (PWM IATA)
Manchester Airport (MHT IATA)
Pease International Airport PSM IATA
Logan International Airport (BOS IATA)
By train[edit]
From Boston's North Station and Portland, Amtrak provides service on the "Downeaster" to the town of Wells, just north of Ogunquit. Seniors get a half-fare rate by entering the code V543 when ordering online, or requesting it from the agent.

By bus[edit]
There is no intercity bus service direct to Ogunquit, however you can take the train to Wells, and then take the local trolley to Ogunquit. At the Wells / Ogunquit line, you have to board another trolley (Ogunquit Trolley Company) to travel along Route 1 into Ogunquit center.

 C & J Bus Lines. Provide limo/bus service from Boston's Logan International Airport to their Portsmouth, NH terminal. 
 Greyhound. Has service to Portland. 
By car[edit]
Interstate 95 is the direct route from Boston (1.25 hours) and other east coast cities.  When coming from the south, take Maine Exit 7 to Route 1 North for access to Ogunquit and The Yorks.
Interstate 95 throughout Maine and New Hampshire can experience major traffic jams from tourists traveling between the Boston metro area and vacation areas in the north.  Using an EZ Pass or compatible transponder will avoid waiting in line at toll booths on 95.  Using a GPS navigation system that can route you around traffic jams could also save a considerable amount of time, if you are not familiar with the area.
Route 1 is a viable coastal alternative to 95, and is also more scenic.  Shore Road is even more coastal, connecting with Route 1 further south.
During the tourist season, Ogunquit experiences major traffic jams on Route 1 (Main Street) and Shore Road, centered around the intersection of the two roads.  Public parking is in high demand and be quite expensive ($25/day).  See the Town of Ogunquit website for a map of available parking lots and rates.  If driving, it is advisable to carpool if applicable, and determine where you would like to park in advance. Most overnight accommodations, like inns and resorts, provide their own free lots. Obed's Lot on Cottage Street requires advanced payment, which can be inconvenient if you do not know how long you wish to park, but which does allow you to leave without waiting in an exit line (unlike the main Beach Lot).
Taking the Ogunquit Trolley between your parking lot and destinations of interest can be cost effective.  Paid dedicated motorcycle parking is available in the main Beach Lot, and is underused compared to automobile parking.  Taking public transit or parking outside of town and bicycling in would also avoid traffic hassles.

Get around[edit]
Ogunquit is said to be the most walkable community in Maine.
