Get in[edit]
37°55′10″N 122°17′56″WMap of El Cerrito
Oakland International Airport (OAK IATA) and San Francisco International Airport (SFO IATA) have Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) stations. Take the Richmond Line to the 37.9027-122.2991 El Cerrito Plaza Station  or 37.9252-122.3172 El Cerrito Del Norte station . If traveling by car, take the Central Avenue exit from Interstate 80 or Interstate 580.
Del Norte BART station is something of a hub for regional buses. Golden Gate Transit bus 580 runs once an hour from San Rafael in Marin County across the bay, WestCAT buses run about twice an hour from Pinole, AC Transit comes from nearby parts of the inner East Bay, and other buses come from Solano County (SolTrans) and Napa County (Vine).
Because the cities and towns on the eastern shore of the San Francisco Bay all butt up against each other and function as one large metro area, it's likely that you will also visit El Cerrito's neighboring  East Bay towns, such as Berkeley, Emeryville, Albany, and Richmond, so much of the information about getting to those places also applies to getting to El Cerrito.

Fat Apples is a local tradition, serving typical breakfast staple items, such as waffles, buttermilk pancakes, and home fries, as well as few unusual ones (the pumpkin pancakes are delicious). The lunch and dinner menus are full of homey family fare, such as cheese burgers, onion rings, spaghetti, tuna melts, and salads. But the main attraction is the baked goods and desserts. The on-site bakery, which supplies the Berkeley Fat Apples restaurant, serves up delicious pies, cakes, cookies, cheese puffs, and all sorts of other baked items fresh from the oven. The El Cerrito Fat Apples is in a converted grocery store space, which won a prize for its deconstructed interior, and the focal point of the restaurant is the huge, red bakery oven sitting in the center of an open kitchen.
