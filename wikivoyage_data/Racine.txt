Racine has a bus system with fares from $0-2 depending on age and time of day. Exact change is required. Day passes can be purchased for about $4. Routes with times and up-to-date fares can be found on the City of Racine's website.

By car[edit]
Most parking on the main streets, especially in the downtown area, are metered. In the event you do not have spare change or need more than 2 hours of parking time, Racine has a phone app to pay the meter fare that even has a handy alarm notification when you are approaching the end of your time. All the information you need for the app is found on the meter itself. Metered parking becomes free parking before 8am and after 6pm, or anytime if you have a handicap license plate or tag on display.
From December 1 to April 1, alternate side parking is in effect for non-metered roadside parking between 2AM and 6AM. Vehicles must park on the even-numbered address side of the street on an even-numbered calendar day; and on the odd-numbered side of the street on an odd-numbered day. You will get ticketed if you don't observe the rules. Racine police have been known to wait beside a parked car at 1:55AM to slap a ticket on it once 2AM rolls around.

The interior isn't quite "date worthy": it's a bit old and seems unkempt, the walls are a bright orange, and there's a large piece of cloth that covers the front of the restaurant to prevent the draft from seeping in. The food is really delicious and has combinations of flavors that would be quite unusual for palates accustomed to American fare. $9 for a dish, but you'll want to purchase more than one.

Stay safe[edit]
There are several neighborhoods in the east and north-east areas of Racine that are run-down or depressed and have a high violent crime rate. Most of the crime is local-on-local or gang-on-gang related so you are unlikely to be a target. You don't need to fear driving through these parts of town, but stick to the main streets and don't dawdle after sundown. Racine crime obeys invisible barriers certain streets create. A "safe" street could be a block away from an "unsafe" area. Anywhere west of West Boulevard, the downtown area while businesses are open, and two blocks from the lake's shore is ok. Anywhere west of Lathrop is sketchy but probably safe. Parks and neighborhoods near the root river should be avoided. Use common sense. If the area looks sketchy it probably isn't a place you should be and probably doesn't have anything a tourist would be interested in anyway.
