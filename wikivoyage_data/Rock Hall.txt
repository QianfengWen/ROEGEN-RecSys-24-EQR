Understand[edit]

By car[edit]
The most common way to enter the town is by car via MD 20, which runs from Chestertown to Rockville and other villages on the Eastern Shore.

By boat[edit]
Rock Hall is situated right on the water, so travelers with a boat can set it in the town's marinas.

Get around[edit]
On foot, by car, or by bicycle[edit]
The town is small enough that you can get around on foot with a bit of patience, though it's still much easier and quicker to use a car or bicycle.

Public transportation[edit]
Trams can transport visitors and residents around town at the price of 1$ per person. There are two such trams: one called the Osprey Flyer and another called the Blue Crab Trawler. The service runs from May to November, stopping at various tram stops throughout town, though the schedule may change when there's a holiday like the 4th of July.
