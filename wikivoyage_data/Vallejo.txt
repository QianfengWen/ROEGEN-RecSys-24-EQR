Get around[edit]
By car[edit]
Similar to San Francisco, most of Vallejo uses a grid-like network of roads with about every three blocks north–south being a major road that crosses town.  It's best to also ask for a cross street when looking for directions. Most roads in this area are named by US states going east/west and California counties going north–south. On Mare Island, the grid is based on numbered and lettered streets. There are also numbered streets on the mainland, but they are in broken order and have other named roads in between them. Other roads (mostly in the east) are usually rural roads or roads that are located in the hills, and can't hold to the grid.
Enterprise, Hertz and Avis all have car rental locations in Vallejo.

Public transportation[edit]
 SolTrans (formerly Vallejo Transit), 311 Sacramento St, ☏ +1 707 648-4666. Vallejo and Benicia's public transportation company offers bus service around the main parts of Vallejo and into other cities. Visit their website for routes and schedules. Adults: $2.00; Reduced: $1.00; Youth 18 and under: Free.   (updated Jun 2024)
Isolated areas[edit]
There are two parts of Vallejo that are isolated from the main part of town: Mare Island and Hiddenbrooke. Neither of them provide bus service.

The easiest way to get into Mare Island by any means would be to cross the drawbridge near Tennessee Street and Mare Island Way.
Hiddenbrooke can only be accessed legally through Hiddenbrooke Parkway, via. I-80 (between Vallejo and Fairfield). Bikes and pedestrians use the Solano Bikeway between Columbus and Hiddenbrooke Parkways.

Stay safe[edit]
A map of crime areas in Vallejo
The safest areas of Vallejo are usually places that are isolated from the main part of the city, such as Mare Island and Hiddenbrooke. Most of the major shopping centers in Vallejo as well as most of Vallejo east of I-80 and the hills around the west of it are safe enough to travel, but are not completely crime free. However, Vallejo has a reputation for its areas of violent crime. Most of these areas are located in patches west of I-80, where some are labelled locally such as The Crest in the North, and Millersville in Central Vallejo; there is also one in South Vallejo along Magazine Street. Sonoma Blvd. (SR 29) between Nebraska and Georgia Streets is a main location for human trafficking. It is unlikely most of these areas will be of any interest to tourists, but if you plan to be in these areas, be vigilant and use your street smarts.
