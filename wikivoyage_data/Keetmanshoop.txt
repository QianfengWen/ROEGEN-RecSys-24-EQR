Keetmanshoop is the capital of the ǁKaras region of southern Namibia. It's one of the main stopping points on the B1 between Windhoek and South Africa. Referred to in Namibia as Keetmans. At first, Keetmanshoop (pronounced keet-man-swoop), may seem like not much more than a quick stopover. The main reason for stopping at all is to refill on gas and check your tires (the dry, hot asphalt of the highway can make tires pop), but there is in fact much more to this town if you get the chance to discover it, either out of your own volition, or because your car breaks down.
An old German town, Keetmanshoop features a cinema, multiple restaurants, an impressive library, and easy access to some of the most visually stunning landscapes this side of the border.


Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
Long distance coaches pass through Keetmans on a regular basis on their way between Windhoek and South Africa. Unfortunately the north-bound trip from South Africa arrives at a nasty hour of the morning.

By combie[edit]
Combies (shared taxis) travel regularly to Keetmans from various places in Namibia, including Windhoek, Lüderitz and Mariental. Combies also arrive in Keetmans from South Africa.
There are also private shuttles that provide transport to and from Keetmanshoop.

By train[edit]
Keetmanshoop is 10 hours by overnight mixed train (seats only, no sleepers) from Windhoek. The bus is a much better option.

Map of Keetmanshoop
See[edit]
Rhenish Mission Church, 1895.
Quivertree Forest
-26.579718.13221 Keetmanshoop Museum. Housed in the Rhenish Mission Church, a historic monument and well-known landmark. The church was built in 1895 in a Gothic architectural style, cast in African stone. (updated Nov 2021)
-26.578218.13282 Keetmanshoop Dutch Reformed Church. Historic church. (updated Nov 2021)
-26.4818.2443 Quiver tree forest (On farm Gariganus about 15 km outside Keetmanshoop on the M29). A 2 hectares protected area with about 200 quiver trees (Aloe dichotoma). The Giant's Playground, an area with millions of boulders that look like stacked on purpose, is another 3 km to the north-east. Worth a visit. Both are perfect for scenic photos and make the area around Keetmanshoop more than just an overnight-stay. If you want to save on the fee, there are quiver trees all over the place, some freely accessible, and there is a much larger quiver tree forest north-west of Keetmanshoop. Best photos are taken at sunset and at sunrise but you need to get your timing right because if you enter between sunset and sunrise you need a photographer's permit for a whopping 500 N$. You need a permit to enter any of the two sights, obtainable at Quiver Tree Forest Camp (below at "Sleep"). (updated Jan 2024)
