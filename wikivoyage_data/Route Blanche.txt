The route Blanche (English: White Road) is a snowmobile trail in the Basse-Côte-Nord region (Le Golfe-du-Saint-Laurent), in the administrative region of Côte-Nord, Quebec.


Understand[edit]
The purpose of the Route Blanche is to provide a means of travel to residents of the Basse-Côte-Nord in winter. In fact, it is the only continuous land link between Kegaska and Vieux-Fort since the Basse-Côte-Nord territory is not connected to the highway of Quebec. Route Blanche is maintained by the Ministère du Transport du Québec and extends over nearly 525 km (326 mi). The route may vary from winter to winter, depending on the obstacles (e.g., lakes, rivers) and weather conditions.

The Route Blanche circuit has 21 refuges maintained by the Ministère des Transports du Québec. These huts have a wood-burning stove and firewood. These shelters should only be used in an emergency, for example, if the weather conditions deteriorate. Users must replace used items or notify a Ministère des Transports office.
