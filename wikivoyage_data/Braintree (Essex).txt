Braintree is a town in Essex, England. For a town of its size it boasts very few amenities. However, a shopping village on the outskirts, 'Freeport', has roughly 80 shops. It mainly specialise in clothing, along with a bowling alley and a cinema, which makes Braintree worth visiting.

The town has expanded to include neighbouring settlements (the 2011 population of Braintree town was 41,634 whilst the population of the urban area was 53,477). The town lies on the River Brain and south of Stane Street whilst Bocking lies on the River Blackwater to the north. Sometimes the two area is referred to as Braintree & Bocking although they form a single urban area.
The town dates back to habitation in the Bronze and Iron Ages. Later the settlement was used by the Saxons after the Romans left. The town was recorded in the Doomsday Book then called Branchetreu. By the 14th century the town was manufacturing woollen cloth and by the 17th century Flemish immigrants contributed to this making the town famous and bringing prosperity. In the 19th century silk manufacture replaced wool and the town benefitted from a rail link to London.

Eat[edit]
Finding a place to eat in Braintree should not be a hard task: the town centre is littered with pubs and sandwich bars which cater for a range of needs.
If you are looking for more of an evening meal you have to travel towards the outskirts of the town, Where you will find Freeport. This contains about 7 restaurants each catering for different needs, many of these franchises so you will have a rough idea of what you are likely to get.
Towards Galleys corner you can find fast food restaurants, a Pizza Hut, and Frankie and Benny's. Just across the road Fowlers Farm is a warm friendly pub which serves popular food also.
Along Cressing Road is an Indian/Turkish venue that serves a variety of tasty dishes.
Freeport Shopping Village has a number of fast food outlets.
Avoid Braintree after 5PM on a Saturday as it starts to resemble the set of Michael Jackson's "Thriller", and men and women with tattoos of family members names on their bingo wings start to congregate.
