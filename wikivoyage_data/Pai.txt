Pai (ปาย) is a small town (pop. 3,000) in Mae Hong Son Province, Northern Thailand. It is a major stop on the Mae Hong Son Loop, which takes Rte 1095 from Chiang Mai to Mae Hong Son, then Rte 108 back to Chiang Mai. The city is named after the Pai River.


Understand[edit]
Pai street
Set in a large picturesque valley north of Chiang Mai, Pai is tourism-oriented, offering a relaxed atmosphere with a vibrant tourist and backpacker scene. The town's permanent residents are a seemingly harmonious mix of common Thai folk, a significant minority of whom follow the Islamic religion, with an admixture of Western hippies, Thai rastas and in the cool season, affluent Thais from Bangkok thrown in, which gives the place a unique vibe which may be appealing to some and off-putting to others. Pai is now sometimes referred to as the "Khao San Road of the North".
A sudden boom in guest house and bar construction from 2006 onwards has resulted in a great deal of spare capacity in the off-season. There has been a large increase in Thai people visiting after Pai was featured in a romantic Thai film, Pai in Love. It can be hard to find a room during the busy season (Oct-Feb). There are now around 350 guesthouses and hotels in Pai, and the city centre has transformed into a tourist warren of Western-style restaurants, souvenir shops, live music venues, tattoo parlours, and bars that cater largely to the now significant influx of tourists and package tours. Since the early 2010s, there has been a large influx of mainland Chinese tourists and they now sometimes outnumber the western backpackers in Pai. The legalisation of cannabis in 2022 has led to a profusion of shops selling weed and the pungent smell of marijuana pervades the main walking street.
While the growth of Pai has been rapid and more or less every farm in the valley seems to rent bungalows, development so far has been largely tasteful and the town remains relatively serene during low season. That said, be prepared for large crowds of tourists and even traffic jams during the higher seasons.

Get in[edit]
Map of Pai
By road[edit]
Rte 1095 which connects Pai with Mae Hong Son (50 km as the crow flies, but approximately 110 km by road) and Chiang Mai (135 km) is a very scenic route through the mountains which takes several hours. It's a steep and winding drive, with lots of curves, so take a plastic bag and some motion sickness pills if you need them. Police report that an average of two accidents a day happen on the Chiang Mai-Pai road, and more in the rainy season.

By motorcycle[edit]
Rte 1095 isn't as bad as people make it out to be. There isn't much traffic and you can hear the cars and trucks coming. The downside is the road is crappy, but not uniformly so. But because you never know what lies around the next bend, you're forced to drive conservatively. If you're a little adventurous, rent a motorcycle in Chiang Mai and make the ride up to Pai. You can stop at the waterfalls and small towns along the way, and you'll really enjoy the trip, as opposed to being motion sick in a bus for hours, and being forced to stop at the driver's friends restaurants. Make sure to take some warmer clothing on your bike, as it tends to get a bit chilly in the higher portions of the ride. As a novice rider, expect the trip to take around 5 or 6 hours, including stops at sites and restaurants along the way. aYa Service offers one way rentals from Chiang Mai to Pai (or vice versa) with free luggage delivery for 300 baht (Sep 2017) depending on the motorbike. They will keep your passport and send it along with any baggage to aYa in Pai.

By bus[edit]
19.35995298.4418631 Pai Bus Station. As of 2017 September, Prempracha is the only transport provider into Pai with Minivans (150 baht) that leave hourly from Chiang Mai (Arcade terminal) and Mae Hong Son between 05:30 to 17:30. There is also once daily fan bus (actually songthaew for 80 baht) running, but foreigners are usually refused to take them. The trip takes some 3 hours and can be gruesome cramped in a minivan in mountainous road, but there is a comfort stop at the small half-way village of Mae Sae (food, water, toilets [3 baht]). You can reserve a seat at Prempracha website. After you made a payment (via credit card, Paypal or 7-11), they will email an e-ticket to you. Alternatively, aYa service provides direct minivan to guesthouses/train station/airport in Chiang Mai. Most guesthouse in Chiang Mai will book the ticket for you, but its schedule and cost depends on the season and who you book with. (updated Sep 2017)
By plane[edit]
19.37036398.4358982 Pai Airport. Pai has a small airport where passenger services begin and stop every few years (because the airline has went bankrupt). As of 2023 there are no services. (updated Aug 2020)
Get around[edit]
Pai town centre is compact and best explored on foot. But the greater Pai area is sprawling. For exploring further afield, bicycles (40-100 baht/day) and motorbikes (from as little as 100 baht/day) can be rented from many agents along the main street. As the roads around Pai are steep and obtaining a decent mountain bike with fully functioning gears is surprisingly difficult, a motorbike is definitely the better option if you can ride one. aYa Service in the town centre rents motorbikes for 100 baht and a 100 baht helmet deposit, plus 40 baht for damage insurance, 40 baht for theft insurance (passport taken as deposit). You'll want a motorbike if you're planning on staying in some of the outlying bungalows in the valley around the town.
Motorbike and 4WD taxis are also readily available.
Suggestions in guidebooks that Chinese Village (Ban Santichon, 50 minutes walk) and Lisu Village (Ban Sai Ngam, 4 hours walk) might be reached on foot are optimistic.

See[edit]
The town itself has no special sights; most people come simply for the relaxed atmosphere. Nearby attractions include hot springs and waterfalls, villages and a hilltop temple.

View of rice farms in Pai
19.37102698.4026691 Chinese village (Santichon). Village settled by Yunnanese hill-tribes who crossed the border in the middle of the 20th century to escape Communist rule. Shops selling different Chinese teas with varying health properties, and other interesting oddities include a human-powered Ferris wheel. Well worth a look, even as a brief stop on the way to Mo Paeng waterfall 
Pai canyon is best at sunset
19.304798.45292 Pai Canyon (Kong Lan) (signposted from the Chiang Mai road; approx 8 km from Pai). Somewhat optimistically described as Pai's answer to the Grand Canyon, it could more accurately be described as a narrow red ridges with steep-sides valleys either side filled with pine and dipterocarp forests. The steep 50m drop either side and stunning views over the surrounding countryside are impressive, but you'll need to be careful here - the path is extremely narrow in some places and requires a scramble in others. A set of steps up to a viewing platform provides the safest way to admire the scenery and the canyon makes the perfect spot for a sunset 
19.2977998.464753 WWII Memorial Bridge (on the road to Chiang Mai, approx 8 km from Pai). The original bridge here was built by the occupying Japanese. The current steel truss bridge which sits alongside the present main road was assembled in its current position in 1976, but as with Pai's "canyon", the bridge invites very loose comparisons with the infamous Bridge over the River Kwai. 
19.357798.44934 Village Farm (Pai Village Farm), 205 Moo 1, Mae Hee, Pai, Mae Hong Son, Thailand, 58130 (From Pai town, cross 'Pai River' by the South East bridge. Then travel a few hundred meters down the road you will find a 2 way junction with a small drive way up the hill in between the 2 main roads. Head up that hill for a few hundred meters you will find the farm to the left.), ☏ +66 53 698 152, reservation@paivillage.com. 10:00 - 16:00. Less than 5-minutes from the center of Pai, the Village Farm offers the chance to experience a unique world of fruits, flowers, animals, including the star attraction, a lovely pair of Alpaca known as Rosemary & Aron. You will also enjoy local coffee and snacks as well as a souvenir shop. The Village Farm is the perfect scenic opportunity for the most memorable photos of Pai. 40 - 80 baht per person. 
Events[edit]
Poi Sang Long is a famous Buddhist ordination of children festival, especially in Mae Hong Son. Thai Yai cultural dance show can be seen at the temple fair in the evening.

Waterfalls[edit]
The Mo Paeng waterfall is good for swimming
Knowing the word waterfall in Thai language can be helpfull when following directions: น้ำตก / namtok.

19.367198.50655 Mae Yen (น้ำตกแม่เย็น) (9 km out of town with no bikes allowed for the last 6 km of that. Head east over the bridge heading out of Pai and follow the signs. At 3 km from town there is some 19.361898.462423 parking space from where you can walk the remainig 6 km.). 
19.3789998.375576 Mo Paeng (น้ำตกหมอแปง) (west of Chiang Mai past Santichon). A little more accessible than most of Pai's waterfalls, this multi-tiered waterfall flows through a verdant green valley and is popular for its pools to swim in. The upper section of this waterfall is a natural water slide during the dry season. The rocks are smooth, just find a small section and slide on down like the locals do. 
19.32084698.4039477 Pam Bok (น้ำตกแพมบก) (on the road to Chiang Mai before Pai Canyon). Nice secluded waterfall with high cliffs surrounding it, making this a cool place to escape the heat. Go for a relaxing bathe in the shade during the dry season. 
Do[edit]
Renting a bicycle or motorbike and riding around the countryside seems to be the most popular activity. You can easily create an itinerary to include visits to the nearby waterfalls and hill tribe villages. Potential day trips include the Tham Lod Bat Cave 55 km away in Pangmapha, best visited when the bats emerge just before sunset.
Pai is also a major starting point for organized trekking tours which are offered by every guest house and travel agent.
Go off-road through the mountains of Pai on an off-road motorbike tour. Here there are better off-road possibilities and better prices than in Chiang Mai. Ask your guest house where to book.

Elephant riding
 Elephant Trek. For several years now, travellers have enjoyed riding an elephant and concluding the trip with a romp in the Pai River. For this adventure, take as little as possible, you'll be enjoyably wet as the elephant is encouraged to shower you. Some operators, and there are several, are willing to take photos of you while you enjoy the elephant antics in the river.

Sulphuric water bubbles out of these hot springs at temperatures of up to 80 degrees Celsius and simple baths have been created where the springs meet a stream which cools temperatures to bearable levels. A short, marked forest trail takes you through the compact national park more noticeable for its smells than its sights. Last entry to the springs is at 18:00. You can also bathe in a mineral pool in the nearby Aroma Pai Spa or Pai Hotspring resort for much more reasonable price of 80 baht, and as it is open later, enjoy the hot water after sunset as it gets cool. The price for government run hotspring is 300 baht for foreigners, 100 Baht for Thai. (updated Sep 2017)
 Tubing. Floating down river on an inflated rubber tube has long been a favourite pastime of SE Asian backpackers, and the gentle current of the Pai River and attractive scenery make this a good spot to try. Unlike the more famous Vang Vieng in Laos, the Pai River isn't lined with raucous bars playing loud music, which some may consider more a blessing than a curse. 
 Whitewater Rafting. Some of Thailand's most spectacular rapids are found between Pai and Mae Hong Song, and a few operators offer both one- and two-day rafting trips.

Buy[edit]
Pai's burgeoning tourist industry has resulted in a range of cutesy hippie-influenced souvenirs sold in shops throughout the village.
Some of the hill tribe members sell handicrafts in the local market, although what's on offer here pales in comparison to the range available in Chiang Mai.
Pai has an abundance of bookshops, some of which carry harder to find titles. Many are along the bus stop road, past aYa Services.

The Pai Walking Street operates in the evenings in peak season

Sleep[edit]
There's an abundance of guest houses in Pai, most of them in the budget range (a bungalow goes for around 150-500 baht depending on amenities included and the season). Mid-range options are available and there are now even luxury hotels.
At the bus station there is a map of Pai. Get this as it will show you the location of most of the guest houses (>100 places). There is also a discount for motorbike rental.
If your accommodation is far away from the two main streets of bars, be careful if walking alone of the packs of dogs that roam the empty streets at night. They do get territorial and intimidating, so if you come across them then remember to keep a safe distance away and make noise to scare them away.
For accommodation with lots of character try out a bamboo hut on the river. Head east from the bus station and either take the first left or continue straight. Either way you'll reach a bamboo bridge. Across the bridge you'll find plenty of cheap accommodation (about 200-400 baht per night).
