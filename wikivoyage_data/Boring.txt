Boring[dead link], an unincorporated community of 8,000 people in the Willamette Valley, Oregon, is twinned with Dull, Scotland and Bland, Australia. The Boring official slogan is "The most exciting place to live."


Understand[edit]

The town is named for William H. Boring, a Union veteran who had moved to Oregon after the Civil War as one of the earliest settlers in the area and donated an acre to build the first Boring school. Boring was established as a rail junction in 1903 (the lines of the defunct Portland Traction Company, which ran from Portland to Boring, are now mostly trails) and relied on timber as a principal industry for much of the 20th century.
Since 2012, Boring's sister city is tiny  Dull, in Perth and Kinross County, Scotland (pop. 85), a former seventh-century monastery site by the River Tay. This partnership has brought many Boring visitors to the one tiny Dull corner of old Scotland and generated publicity for both communities. Along with former gold mining and farming area Bland Shire, West Wyalong, Australia (pop 6,000), these villages form the "League of Extraordinary Communities", a grouping to promote Dull, Bland and Boring by capitalizing on their unique names.
