Joliet[dead link] is a city in the Chicagoland region of Illinois, a state in the Midwest of the United States of America. It is the largest city and county seat of Will County.


Understand[edit]
Joliet is a blue collar city which has built several tourist attractions.  Notably, Chicagoland Speedway hosts NASCAR races during the summer, and there are two riverboat casinos on the river which bisects the city. Sherb Noble opened the first Dairy Queen here on June 22, 1940; the landmark 501 N. Chicago Street building is now a church. Joliet's prison, now closed, appears in the film Blues Brothers. The city was part of Route 66 from 1926 until 1940, with the road demoted to "66 alternate" locally when the mainline was redirected westward through Plainfield. A freeway (now I-55) bypassed both roads in 1957.

Get in[edit]
Joliet can be accessed from I-80 and I-55.
