Masterton is the main town in the Wairarapa region of the North Island of New Zealand.


Understand[edit]
Masterton and nearby Greytown were established in 1854 by the Wairarapa Small Farms Association. The association was led by Joseph Masters, after whom the town is named. Masterton gained borough status in 1877, and the railway from Wellington arrived in November 1880. In 2021, the town was home to 21,800 people, with another 6,400 living in the surrounding rural areas.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
State Highway 2 passes through the middle of Masterton en route between Wellington and the Hawke's Bay. There is a signposted heavy traffic bypass for those passing through and wanting to avoid central Masterton. State Highway 2 from Wellington passes over Remutaka Pass via the Rimutaka Hill Road, a busy and winding 15 km road with a poor accident record, so take extra care.

Central Masterton has three main streets parallel to each other; Chapel Street (SH 2) to the west, Queen Street in the middle and Dixon Street to the east. Most of the major commercial and retail facilities in Masterton are on one of these three streets.
Masterton is reasonably flat, so walking and cycling around the town are viable options.
