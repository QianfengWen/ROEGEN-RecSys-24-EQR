Bethany is a small town in Connecticut and one of three that compose Amity. It is rapidly growing as a town because it is set back from the rest of the surrounding areas but is in the middle of New Haven and Waterbury, two cities within CT. Although it contains both a High School and a Middle School, the Middle School is shared with Woodbridge and the local High School is a single one, located in Woodbridge for all of Amity.
