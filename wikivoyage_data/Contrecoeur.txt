Understand[edit]
Geography[edit]
The territory of Contrecoeur had a primary vocation in terms of agriculture, forestry, river and recreational tourism. Its port and industrial vocation gradually gained importance in the 20th century. It has a riparian zone of 23.9 km (14.9 mi) on the St. Lawrence River; the vast majority of the inhabitants live in this last zone which has three villages: Contrecoeur, Saint-Laurent-du-Fleuve and Saint-Arsène. 

History[edit]
Lighthouse at Contrecoeur
On June 19, 1610, French soldiers led by Samuel de Champlain, supported by Montagnais and Algonquins, engaged in battle at Cap de la Victoire against a hundred Iroquois who had erected a strategic fort there. This former cape de sable is now part of the grounds of the Grèves summer camp, at the northern limit of the parish of Contrecoeur. This cape was approximately 8.0 km (5.0 mi) southwest of Downtown Sorel-Tracy, on the borders of the Seigneurie de Saint-Ours. This course was undone over twenty years at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century by the operation of a sandpit.
The first establishment dates from 1667, under the aegis of Antoine Pécaudy de Contrecoeur, captain of the regiment of Carignan-Salières. In 1672, he received the concession of this seigniory.
The canonical erection of the Catholic parish of Sainte-Trinité de Contrecoeur was proclaimed in November 1832. The civil erection of the parish took place in 1845 by adopting the same toponymic designation as the religious parish. On April 20, 1902, the sector of the village of Contrecoeur was civilly erected as a municipality, detaching itself from the territory of the parish. The MRC of Marguerite-D'Youville came into effect on May 1, 1982. In May 1997, Contrecoeur became a city.
