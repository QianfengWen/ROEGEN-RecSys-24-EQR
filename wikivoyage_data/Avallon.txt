Avallon old center
Avallon is a city in Bourgogne-Franche-Comté. Many buildings here recall the city's rich past: the fortress wall, with its turrets and bastions, still surrounds parts of the Old Town, where the St. Lazarus Church, the bell tower, and old half-timbered houses have all stood the test of time in admirable condition.


Understand[edit]
The town of Avallon is located in the heart of Burgundy on a granite rock at an altitude between 163 and 369 m. It is the northern entrance to the  Morvan. It has just over 7,200 inhabitants within the city limits and 16,000 in the urban area. The Gallo-Romans built a temple, a court and a theater, but even before Roman times, the site of the town was home to a fortified stronghold of the Aedui, a Celtic tribe. Later, in the Middle Ages, Avallon had an important strategic position. Today, many buildings here recall the city's rich past: the fortress wall, with its turrets and bastions, still surrounds parts of the Old Town, where the St. Lazarus Church, the bell tower, and old half-timbered houses have all stood the test of time in admirable condition.

Statue of Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban
Saint-Lazare Church (Église Saint-Lazare) - The church was founded in the twelfth century and became a place of pilgrimage as a relic (a part of the skull) of St. Lazarus is preserved here. Only the crypt under the choir is left from the original structure from the fourth century. The two portals on the front are constructed in the 12th century. The church was destroyed several times by fire and the bell tower, that collapsed in 1633, is rebuilt in 1670.
