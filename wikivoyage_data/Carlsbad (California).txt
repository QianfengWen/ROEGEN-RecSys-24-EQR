Carlsbad is a city in the north end of San Diego County in Southern California. The city has a relaxed beach town atmosphere away from the urban madness of Los Angeles and San Diego, but close enough for easy access. It has a 7-mile stretch of mostly undeveloped coastline with nice beaches, secluded coves and picturesque cliffs that are well maintained and accessible.


Understand[edit]
San Francisco built out of LEGO bricks
Carlsbad is the third largest city in San Diego County. Its northern neighbor is the second biggest city in San Diego County, Oceanside.  South of Carlsbad is the affluent beach town of Encinitas.
Carlsbad is a favorite destination for families and foreign tourists, especially Germans.
For families with children, Carlsbad's biggest draw is Legoland California, a theme park based on the popular toy line with sculptures made of the little plastic bricks and lots of Lego-themed rides. The downtown Carlsbad Village by-the-Sea area is a nice place to spend the day shopping and eating at an eclectic mix of places. For now the area has kept a charming mix of the Old California single story development - giving its European Village feel - with the modern amenities of a modern city.
