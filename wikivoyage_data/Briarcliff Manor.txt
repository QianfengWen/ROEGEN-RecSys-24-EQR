Briarcliff Manor highway map
Briarcliff Manor is shared between the towns of Mount Pleasant and Ossining and lies within the ZIP code of 10510. In 1890, Walter W. Law bought 232 acres (0.94 km²) when he retired from W. & J. Sloan; he called this land Briarcliff Farm. He later owned 5,000 acres (20 km2) and developed the village. It is said that "Manor" was added to the village's name after Law's friend, Andrew Carnegie, jokingly referred to Law as the "Laird of Briarcliff Manor" and the name stuck.

Westchester County Airport[edit]
Westchester County Airport ('HPN' IATA) is conveniently located 12 miles southeast of Briarcliff Manor in the city of White Plains. The airport is serviced by American, BermudAir, Breeze Airways, Delta, and jetBlue and offers direct service to many cities on the East Coast, along with select international destinations. The airport also offers rental car options from six different companies (Alamo, Avis, Budget, Enterprise, Hertz, and National), additional information is available on the website.
By bus and train: From the airport, take the 12 bus ($2.75) towards White Plains. At Martine Ave. @ Court St., exit the bus and walk to Main St. @ Court St. and board the 6 bus en route to Pleasantville. At Bedford Rd. @ Wheeler Ave., transfer onto the 19 bus ($2.75) en route to Ossining. The 19 bus has a number of stops throughout much of downtown Briarcliff Manor that will make accessing the village easy. Expected time for this journey is roughly 1.5-2 hours. The Bee-Line Bus service allows for one free transfer onto another bus, so two fares will be necessary for the trip. If paying with a MetroCard, the transfer will be applied automatically, but ask the driver for a transfer ticket if you are paying with change.
By car: For those less experienced with Westchester County, it is advised to take this route through interstates and parkways. From Westchester County Airport, merge onto I-684 south and take the exit onto I-287 west towards White Plains. Then take exit 3, merging into the Sprain Brook Parkway north. The Sprain Brook Parkway will merge into the Taconic State Parkway, and exit into Briarcliff Manor at exit 6.
By taxi: While taxi service is allowed at Westchester County Airport, taxi companies are unable to cruise around the terminal and the hailing of unoccupied taxis are not allowed. To schedule the service of a taxi while at the airport, you can dial one of seven companies licensed by the Westchester County Taxi and Limousine Commission.
Stewart International Airport[edit]
Stewart International Airport ('SWF' IATA) is located 40 miles northwest of Briarcliff Manor in the town of New Windsor. While a nice alternative to the congestion of the three main airports of New York City, public transportation into Briarcliff Manor is scarce, time-consuming and expensive, and driving requires paying a toll or taking an unfriendly windy road on the side of a mountain. The airport is served by three airlines (Allegiant, Play, and Breeze), and offers non-stop flights to Reykjavik and numerous destinations in Florida and South Carolina. The airport offers rental car options from four different companies (Avis, Budget, Enterprise, and National) with information available on their website.
By bus and train: Briarcliff Manor is impossible to reach by public transportation from Stewart International Airport without taking multiple trains going through Manhattan or taking a combination of trains and the seasonal Beacon to Newburgh seasonal ferry operated by the NY Waterway. Not recommended for any visitors to Briarcliff Manor.
By car: The easiest way to travel from Stewart International Airport into Briarcliff Manor. If renting a car from any of the rental car providers at the airport, make sure to enquire about EZ-Pass, New York's electronic tolling system as part of the route to Briarcliff involves a toll. The general route is to follow I-84 east for about 19 miles until you reach the Taconic State Parkway at exit 52A, where you can head south for roughly 30 miles until reaching exit 6 for Briarcliff Manor.
By taxi: Taxi service is available at Stewart International through the Welcome Center in the main terminal, but is not recommended due to the long distance in between the airport and Briarcliff Manor.
Newark Liberty International Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport, and LaGuardia International Airport[edit]
Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR IATA), John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK IATA), and LaGuardia International Airport (LGA IATA) are the three major international airports in the New York City metro area and offer service to just about anywhere around the world. If you are a visitor to Westchester County, it is most likely that you will fly into one of these three main airports. While the central hub for downstate New York, it can be a real headache to get transport to Briarcliff Manor from these airports.
By bus and train: All three airports are well equipped for train connection to New York City. It is recommended to take from JFK the Long Island Railroad (LIRR) from Jamaica via the AirTrain ($8.00), which will conveniently whisk you into Manhattan into Penn Station. At Newark, the AirTrain Newark (which has a $7.75 fee, but is included in the $15.25 NJ Transit train ticket) connects with the NJ Transit trains which run to Penn Station ($15.25). At LaGuardia, the M60-SBS can take you to the area of Upper Manhattan around Columbia University via the Astoria neighborhood of Queens and 125th Street in Harlem. From New York City, taking the Hudson Line or Harlem Line from Grand Central Terminal or 125th Street is possible.
By car: All three airports offer a variety of car rental services which will allow to you more easily drive into Briarcliff Manor. The specific routes from each of the three airports can vary greatly depending on the time of day, so plan accordingly when choosing to drive into Westchester County.
By taxi: While taxi service is incredibly easy to get from the three airports, Westchester-based liveries and New York City's iconic yellow cabs cost exorbitant amounts of money for the hour long drive. It is not recommended to take a taxi from these airports, however if you wish to do so, you can hail a cab outside the airport.
By car[edit]
Briarcliff Manor is easily accessible from the northeastern United States via interstate highways such as the New England Thruway/New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) and the New York State Thruway system. The I-87 portion of the Thruway connecting Albany and New York City crosses the Hudson River at Tarrytown on the Tappan Zee Bridge, as does I-287, which connects with I-95 to the east. The Saw Mill River Parkway, which runs along the village's eastern flank, connects with the Taconic State Parkway to the north (to Albany and the I-90 east-west portion of the Thruway system) and the Henry Hudson Parkway into New York City.
From the south, take the NY-9A/​NY-100 N exit from the Taconic State Parkway, then head two miles north on NY-9A. Turn left at the light onto North State Road, then left in one block onto Pleasantville Road. You've reached the heart of Briarcliff Manor.

By car[edit]
For travel within Briarcliff Manor, having access to a car is highly recommended. The area typically experiences light traffic with rare occurrences of jams, and parking is generally free of charge.
