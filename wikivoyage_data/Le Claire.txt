Le Claire is part of the greater Quad Cities area, in Eastern Iowa.


Understand[edit]
Le Claire is a Mississippi River town of 3,765 (2010).  It is named for Antoine LeClaire, who developed a large part of the Iowa Quad Cities on property that was given him by the tribes who originally laid claim to it.  The town was the head of the Rock Island Rapids, a notorious section of the river that extended as far south as what is now downtown Davenport.  River pilots were required to guide river traffic through the rapids, which impacted the early economic life of the town.  The rapids were tamed by the development of the lock and dams on the upper river.  The town is also the boyhood home of frontiersman Buffalo Bill Cody.

Map of Le Claire


By car[edit]
Le Claire is a small town with interstate access.  There is no mass transit or any other easy way to access the town.  Most of the town lies north of the interchange of Interstate 80 and US Route 67.  The exit is right after the Mississippi River Bridge.  From the Iowa Quad Cities it is, for the most part, easier to access the town via US 67, which has great views of the Mississippi River.  From the north side of the Quad Cities it is easier to use Interstate 80.

By plane[edit]
Quad City International Airport in Moline has non-stop flights from major markets primarily in the Midwest, the South and Southwest United States.

Get around[edit]
By car[edit]
Because Le Claire is a small town it is easy to navigate.  Cody Road (US Route 67) is the town's main street and all establishments that a visitor would patronize is either on the street or just off of it.  Caution should be excised when driving through the downtown area on summer weekends when many people visit.  Traffic will be heavier, although manageable, and there will be many pedestrians.  There is also railroad tracks that separate the downtown businesses from a large surface parking lot along the Mississippi River. Even though there are not a large number of daily freight trains on the tracks, caution should be exercised.
