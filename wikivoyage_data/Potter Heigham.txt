Village sign
Potter Heigham is in Norfolk. The village lies on the River Thurne in the Norfolk Broads (although the village is just outside the park boundary).  Most visitors to the area will be there to either hire a boat or as part of their boating holiday on the Broads.


Understand[edit]
Most people will know the village for its famous mediaeval bridge dating from 1385 - one of the lowest and narrowest navigable bridges on the Broads. The bridge represents such a "challenge" to boat owners that hire craft that can pass are required to use the services of a pilot. Larger hire craft are not permitted to pass the bridge (on hiring a boat the skipper will be advised if the boat can pass under the bridge).
There are actually two road bridges across the River Thurne at Potter Heigham. The larger one carrying the A149 is modern and does not have the same constraints or reputation as the older bridge.
The village is said to have its own haunting, taking place each 31 May at midnight at the old bridge. Each year the sound of hooves, screech of wheels and a fiery coach appears on the bridge at midnight. See Reputedly haunted places for the full story.
