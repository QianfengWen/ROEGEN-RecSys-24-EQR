Randers is a city in East Jutland. It is located at the mouth of the Gudenå river, the largest and longest river in Denmark.


Get in[edit]
It is next to the E45, the main north-south motorway in Jutland, so getting in by car is an easy option. Randers is well served by regional buses (blue) and train. It is possible enter Randers from the seaside, by the fjord, but only if you travel in your own boat.

Get around[edit]
Map of Randers
The central train station and the bus terminal are in the city center on the northern shores of the Gudenå River. Most of the town can be reached within a 30-minute walk from these places and as the inner city is home to most of the attractions, and larger parts of it pedestrianized anyway, walking is a recommended form of transportation. If you plan to visit more outlying places such as the Memphis Mansion for example, it would be a good idea to rent a city-bike or take a local bus.
City-bikes[dead link] for tourists and visitors can be picked up for free at five spots in the inner city, including the central station and the bus terminal. The city-bikes are quite good quality bikes, but requires a rather large deposit and a special instruction[dead link] when using foreign credit cards.
Randers has a local network of buses (yellow) and taxi cabs is also an option.
