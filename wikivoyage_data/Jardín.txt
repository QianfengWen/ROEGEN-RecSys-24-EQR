Aerial view of traditional homes in Jardín
Visit the Aboriginal people of the Emberá-Chamí tribe just 10 minute away from the town center, or go to their old cemetery in Morro Amarillo.
Over a century ago people from the central and eastern area of Antioquia started moving south and conquering this unsettled land, this migration is called the 'Colonización Antioqueña'. The new towns grew with a characteristic architecture and Jardín is a fine example of such. Balconies and doors are in wood painted in colorful reds, blues and yellows, in sharp contrast with the white walls of the homes.
The main church dominates the plaza, the town and the whole scenery. Its neogothic style couples perfectly with the materials used to build it: hard rocks from a nearby river.
The Hospital is also worth seeing. Only one story high and built in blocks of dark stone from rivers closeby. The interior has many patios with flowers. Walk 6 blocks down from the main plaza of town.
