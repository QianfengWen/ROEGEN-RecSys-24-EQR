Horeke[dead link] is a small isolated town on the shores of the Hokianga Harbour, in the North Island of New Zealand.


Understand[edit]
Horeke is the oldest European settlement in the Hokianga and the second oldest European settlement in New Zealand. It was very primitive early on and people lived in very simple dwellings.
Horeke was first called "Deptford", then it was renamed "The Horeke', meaning "The Throwing of a Spear".[1] Now it is just called Horeke. It was the first centre of timber trading in the Hokianga followed by Kohukohu.

The short visit takes about 40 to 60 minutes, the easy walk to the platform is about 2 hr return. $15 adult.   (updated Dec 2020)
