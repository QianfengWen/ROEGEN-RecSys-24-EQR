Great Barrier Island (Māori name: Aotea) is in the outer Hauraki Gulf in northern New Zealand. It lies east of the Northland Peninsula and directly north of Coromandel Peninsula. It is 90 km north-east of central Auckland. It is the 4th largest island in the main New Zealand archipelago and has a population of nearly 1,000. Largely covered in regenerating native forest, with some rare native species, a network of hiking trails across the island and beautiful beaches and inlets, it attracts those who enjoy the outdoors, whether hiking, swimming, surfing or enjoying the natural environment. You can get there by plane, sea ferry or private boat.


Understand[edit]
At 285 km2, Great Barrier is the 4th largest island in the main New Zealand archipelago, significantly smaller than Stewart Island, the 3rd largest at 1,683 km2. It is also smaller than the 900-km2 Chatham Island, which is outside the main island chain. Great Barrier is also the centrepiece of its own small archipelago, and some of the smaller islands, such as Kaikōura Island, near Port Fitzroy, can also be visited.
The island's basement sedimentary rocks are overlain by ancient volcanic rocks that give rise to jagged pinnacles, cliffs, bluffs and ravines. It was named Great Barrier Island by Capt James Cook because it formed a barrier between the Hauraki Gulf and the Pacific Ocean – it is not a "barrier island" in the usual sense of a long sandy island close to the mainland.
Copper, gold and silver were once mined on the island and there are relics of this and other past economic activities. A whaling station at Whangaparapara caught humpback whales from 1956 to 1962, and was New Zealand's second-to-last whaling station.
From the 1880s to the early 1930s much of the kauri forest on the island was logged. Parts of the island were turned into farmland, though to a lesser degree than happened on the New Zealand mainland. Now, much of the island is in regenerating native forest, dominated by kauri trees, with a few areas of original, unlogged kauri forest, mainly in the far north. The kauri are unfortunately under threat from kauri dieback disease, and it is important for hikers to stay on the tracks, keep off kauri roots, and to clean footwear before and after visiting an area of forest. More than 60% of the island is conservation land managed by the Dept of Conservation.
While the island has introduced predators – two species of rats, mice and feral cats, dogs and pigs – it thankfully does not have some of the other pests that are common on the mainland, such as stoats, weasels, ferrets, possums and deer. This means there is slightly less pressure on endangered native species, including kākā (parrot), brown teal (duck), black petrel (seabird), chevron skink, Hochstetter’s frog and rare plants.
The island has a resident population of close to 1,000. The main employment is in tourism, farming and service industries. There is no reticulated electricity or water and most houses use solar panels and a battery bank to generate and store power. Wind and water turbines and solar water heaters are also used. The island is administered by Auckland Council as part of the Auckland Region.
There are no litter bins on the island. Dispose of your rubbish in your accommodation, buy council bin bags from a shop or take it to the Aotea Transfer Station in Claris.

-36.2107175.47885 Awana, Aotea Rd. One of the top surf beaches. (updated Feb 2021)
-36.1717175.47986 Harataonga, Harataonga Rd. You can walk down from the campground (where the locals camp) either on the right side of the creek, over the bridge and through the paddock, without getting your feet wet, or on the left side, crossing the creek twice. (updated Feb 2021)
-36.251501175.4797357 Kaitoke Beach (from Ocean View Rd in the middle of the beach or Sugarloaf Rd at the southern end). Will you love the combo of dark mountains looming in the background of this sparkly white beach? Spot mermaid pools in the rocks at the southern end. Has consistent surf. (updated Dec 2018)
-36.268366175.4962948 Medlands Beach, Sandhills Rd. If you like solitude, this could be just the ticket. It is one of the busier beaches, but many visitors are lucky enough not to see another soul during the good hour it takes to walk from one end of the beach to the other. If you want a shorter walk, drive to the northern end of the road, cut through the dunes and walk north to the creek, beyond which is the Sugarloaf. Spot the blowhole in the rocks. Even shorter is a hop over the dunes in the middle, taking a look at Memory Rock, or climbing up if you are nimble footed, and having a look at the mermaid pool on the seaward side (low tide). Has reliable surf conditions. (updated Dec 2018)
-36.259175.43659 Okupu Beach, Camerton Rd. A lovely west-coast beach where there's often dolphins close to shore. There’s a public BBQ – bring your own meat and drinks for an epic sunset. Generally not a surfing beach. (updated Dec 2018)

-36.1221175.4211 Whangapoua, Mabey Rd. A long sandy beach. Graves from the Wairarapa shipwreck of 1894 are at the northern end of the beach, and there are some interesting rock pits approx. 500 m south of the dune crossing. (updated Feb 2021)

The Mt Whangaparapara Peak and Whangaparapara Pack tracks are permanently closed due to kauri dieback risk.

Buy[edit]
Groceries can be more expensive than on mainland New Zealand because of the cost of freighting them to the island. You can buy fresh fruit and vegetables, bread, meat and general groceries at the local stores.  Local crafts, products and souvenirs are available. There are several art galleries. Barrier specialities include manuka honey and locally brewed beer.
