Lublin is a city in eastern Poland and the capital of Lublin Voivodeship with a population of 324 637 (2016). In the Renaissance Lublin played an important role in the life of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth as a trade centre and as a city with military significance.

Lublin's very own royal castle.

Understand[edit]
First mentioned in 13th century, Lublin reached its "golden age" in 16th century, when - due to its central location between Kraków (capital of Poland) and Vilnius (capital of Lithuania) - it was chosen as the place where the Union of Lublin was signed, effectively uniting the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania for several centuries; see Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Due to its location at a crossroads between the rest of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia, the city was a melting pot of different cultures - an important centre of Christian reformation movement as well as Judaism. Between the 17th and 19th century, together with the rest of the country, it suffered a gradual decline.
During World War II the Jewish and Polish populations suffered heavy losses with many people being interned and killed at Majdanek, a Nazi concentration camp; see Holocaust remembrance. In 1939, the city's Jewish population numbered 42,380, nearly a third of the total population. The war and Nazi crimes reduced the Jewish population to a mere 4,553 by 1945. After the war, the city developed to be an important university site, with six state universities and a number of smaller ones. As well, the city served as Poland's post-war capital city for approximately six months after the Soviet occupation forces installed a puppet regime.
Today, Lublin is a beautiful mid-sized city with its own particular Renaissance style, called the Lublin Renaissance. If you're coming from Warsaw, a slightly-less-than-thorough day trip to Lublin can be achieved, if you rely on taxis versus public transportation. Most of the major sites are not that far from the train station by car, so taxis can be a fast, cheap, and efficient way to traverse the city.

Get around[edit]
By bus or trolleybus[edit]
In the city centre or the Old Town you can easily reach every place worth seeing on foot. You can also use the public transport. It's worth to try a trolleybus ride, especially the "tourist" route 156 from the Majdanek Concentration Camp, near Old Town and Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva. The city has 50 bus lines and 8 trolleybus lines (served by MPK). There's also commercial city transport (buses with Komunikacja prywatna or AKL signs).
To use the public transport [2] you should buy your tickets in a "kiosk" - such "kiosks" are usually found near bus stops - or on the bus (exact change required). The price system for MPK (municipal) buses is following: a single ride ticket costs 3.20 zł, students with ISIC identification pay 1.60 zł. You must validate your ticket immediately upon getting on the bus. Children below 4 can use public transport for free. When changing buses, you need to validate another ticket (they are valid only for one ride each). Of use to tourists, there are also 24-hour tickets (11 zł, 5.5 zł). Timetables for both can be found at the link above.

Routes 1-57 - normal buses
Routes 7x - mini-buses (suburban buses)
Routes 150-160 - trolleybuses
Routes Nx - night buses (tickets must be bought from the driver: 5.00 zł, 2.50 zł); available whole week
Routes to/from the Railway Station and the Central Bus Terminal are prone to pickpockets.

Trolleybus line for tourists[edit]
Every summer local city transport company runs special tourist trolleybus line. It's served by unique Soviet trolleybus ZIU, popular in the 70s and 80s in former communist countries in Europe. Tours start every Sunday from the bus stop near Kraków Gate (Brama Krakowska 02) at 14:00 and 15:30. During those journeys the passengers will see Majdanek Nazi Camp, Cathedral, some interesting sights in the Old Town and other attractions (all with virtual guide comments). Price: 5 zł for one ride.

By taxi[edit]
Taxi services are quite cheap, but it's good to know the local prices:

5.50zł starting fee and then
1.76-2.20zł/km
Charges are higher after 22:00, on Sundays and public holidays.

Damel Taxi - +48 81 19626

Do not take taxis which are not at the taxi stands, especially near the Bus Terminal and the Railway Station. There are often non-regulated taxi drivers who overcharge. It's better to call one of taxi companies or take a taxi with one of above phone numbers displayed on the roof.

By bike[edit]
Lublin has a well-developed system of cycling infrastructure. There are over 80 km of segregated cycle lanes and paths in the city. The most common are bike paths independent of road traffic, however most of them are outside the Old Town and the city centre (map of cycle paths and lanes).

Traditional local food[edit]
Cebularz lubelski
The most known local food speciality is cebularz, a small, oven-baked flat bread topped with onion mixed with poppy seeds. The tradition of preparing it has existed since Middle Ages and is connected with Jewish cuisine. Cebularz probably originates from wheat flatbreads known in the Middle East which were brought to this part of Poland by Jewish immigration and modified afterwards. It is a very popular snack: One can buy it in every bakery or grocery in Lublin (it is uncommon to taste it in a restaurant or bar). Since 2014 cebularz has been registered within the European Union as a product with Protected Geographical Indication. The Lublin region is also famous for various kinds of pierogi. The local type is known as pierogi po lubelsku (or pierogi wiejskie). It is stuffed with a mix of cottage cheese, buckwheat groats (kasha) and mint. Look for restaurants with regional cuisine to taste them (Sielsko Anielsko, Rynek 17, Old Town). If you want to try Lublin regional alcoholic beverages (or buy Lublin-related souvenirs), you can choose among vodka, mead and beer. The most famous vodka produced here is Żołądkowa Gorzka, vodka with "bitter" (gorzka) in the name, but sweet in taste. Just like Żubrówka, it's a unique Polish product and definitely a must-try. The APIS company in Lublin is the oldest Polish mead-making factory in Poland. Among more than ten varieties of mead which are produced there, one (Staropolski Tradycyjny trójniak) is marked with an EU Traditional Speciality Guaranteed sign. Lublin also has a longstanding brewery tradition. The local beer called Perła Chmielowa (Hop Pearl) is a very tasty pilsner-type lager. You can also try beers in a micro-brewery situated in Old Town (Grodzka 15 Restaurant).

Drink[edit]
For drinking, head to the Old Town and its vicinity. That's where the most popular pubs are located. Even there, prices are low because of a large student clientèle. Pubs offer one or two varieties of draught beer (draft beer), usually only pilsner-type lagers. In the last couple of years some bars and coffee houses have opened up in the area west of the Old Town (in the direction of Ogród Saski). Unfortunately, in majority, pubs sell do not sell local beer. If you want to taste regional one ask for Perla. Prices: Big one (duże; 0.5 l) costs 6-10 zł, small one (małe; 0.3 l) is at 1-2 zł lower price.

This may be one of the most stylish places in Lublin to have a beer. Owned by the Perła brewery group (and located on the edge of the actual brewery) you are pretty close to the source. It may be no surprise that you can only get beers from this company here, but the wide offer of dark and light beers makes up for it. The place basically consists of one big oval-shaped bar. 8-12 zł.

Stay safe[edit]
Lublin is generally considered a very safe city, both at day and at night, with police patrols frequent throughout the Old Town and in the city's student areas. Violent crime is quite rare in the city and elsewhere in Poland. Car theft has been an issue in the past, though common sense precautions can be easily taken. If an emergency should materialise, visitors can call the all-purpose emergency number 112 on their phone. For a better specification of the kind of emergency service being requested, people can dial 999 for an ambulance, 998 for a fire emergency, and 997 for the police.
