Rainy River is a town of 800 people (2016) in Northern Ontario. It exists primarily as an entry point between Northern Ontario, Canada, and Northwestern Minnesota, United States of America.


Understand[edit]
Rainy River
Rainy River sits southeast of Lake of the Woods on the eponymous Rainy River, which forms part of the Ontario-Minnesota segment of the Canada–US border. Opposite Rainy River across the river is the town of Baudette, Minnesota. The two towns are connected by the Baudette – Rainy River International Bridge. Rainy River is at the northwestern terminus of Ontario Highway 11.
Rainy River is famous for being frequently (though wrongly) seen as being at being the opposite end of Toronto's Yonge Street, which has led to the street being dubbed the "longest street in the world", due to a false conflation between the street and Highway 11, which the street was once the southernmost section of. The street name for the highway through the town is Atwood Avenue.

History[edit]
Rainy River was formed around 1895 along the east shore of the Rainy River about 2 km from the current town centre by a group of lumbermen whose mill was purchased by the Beaver Mills Lumber Company in 1898. The small village took the name Beaver Mills until it was incorporated as a town in 1904. In 1901 the Ontario and Rainy River Railway completed a bridge connecting Minnesota to Ontario, but Beaver Mills town site was in the way of the eastern end and so they created a new town further up river in between the two large mills. The only method of transport at the time was by steamship so parts of the bridge arrived addressed to "Rainy River". The town eventually accepted this as its name.

Rainy River Town Hall, formerly the town's train station.
The town grew rapidly because of the thriving lumber industry and its two large mills and bolstered by the railway. In 1910, a forest fire known as The Great Fire of 1910 originating in northern Minnesota swept north and destroyed the mills. Across the south side of the river the two villages of Baudette and Spooner were completely burned out, and much of the population was saved at the last moment by a group of citizens from Rainy River who backed a train of box cars across the bridge and pulled them out. The mill industry relocated as a result, contributing to a drop in population from more than 2000 people to its current less than 800.
Because of the railway (now a part of Canadian National Railways), the growing hunting/fishing tourism industry, the town remained firmly established. The town has had many industries in the past, a Rail Round House, in the 1960s the Rainy River Boat company, in the 1970s Arctic Cat Apparel among some of the major ones, all have now closed and the current town faces a dismal future.
