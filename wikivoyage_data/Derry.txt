Derry or Londonderry (Irish: Doire) is the second city of Northern Ireland, with a population of 85,000 in 2021. It's on the estuary of the River Foyle and historically within County Londonderry, which has been abolished as a unit of governance so the city is now part of Derry and Strabane District. It's on the border with County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland, and its city walls reflect its frontier status. Derry is a fascinating destination with in-your-face history. 


Understand[edit]
Tercentenary Window in Derry Guildhall
Accept at the outset that you will occasionally use the wrong name, or rather a right name in the wrong company, and be thunderously corrected. The multiple names of this city reflect its deep layers of history.
Doire is Irish for "oak grove". Glaciers gouged out the fjord of Lough Foyle, and as they retreated the Atlantic lowlands became carpeted in oak forest. Oak was essential so it's a common place-name element: Edenderry, Durrow, Kildare, Adare, and so on. Oak timber was needed for ships, carts, houses, furniture, fences . . . but even more it was needed to make charcoal to fire furnaces for metal-working and glass-blowing. (Coal was too dirty, and coke hadn't been invented.) A monastic settlement grew up at Doire at the head of the lough, while the forests were felled at a rate worthy of a Brazilian cattle tycoon. Meanwhile this northwest region of Ireland remained under Gaelic rule, rebuffing the Vikings, the Normans and the Tudors, until in 1603 Gaelic power was broken by the Nine Years War - almost. But in 1608 a diehard Gaelic noble rebelled, and the city was burned. The rebels were soon hunted down but the government were determined to prevent any repeat. Their astonishing solution was to outsource the place to a London business consortium - how come Nicosia or Sarajevo never thought of this?
Londonderry is the city they ringed with stout walls, soon put to the test. The consortium, "The Honourable The Irish Society", divvied up the area between their twelve leading merchant companies, and colonised it with loyal Protestant settlers mostly from Scotland. The walls were first tested in 1641 in the Civil Wars when Gaelic insurgents were repulsed. In 1649 Londonderry supported Cromwell and parliament, and withstood a siege by the Royalists. In "The Glorious Revolution" the city supported the Protestant King William but was attacked by Jacobites: on 7 Dec 1688 thirteen Apprentice Boys famously locked shut the city gates with a slam that echoes yet throughout Northern Ireland. On 18 April 1689 King James and his army began a siege that lasted 105 terrible days - "No Surrender!" - until relief ships broke through up the Foyle. And thus Londonderry was "the maiden city", never taken, and with an uncompromising tradition to uphold.

Coat of Arms for Stroke City?
Derry remained in common use, and was the name of its Protestant and RC bishoprics. The big sectarian divide came in 1921, when Ireland was partitioned - six counties including Londonderry remained in the UK, while 26 including Donegal became part of the Republic. A "hard" border suddenly appeared at the west edge of the city, blighting both sides, while cultural borders hardened within it. "The Troubles" escalated in the 1970s, especially after the massacre of Bloody Sunday. In 1984 the city changed its name back to Derry, insofar as it was empowered to do so, but its Royal Charter of 1662 trumps this. The name you uttered became a badge of allegiance.
Stroke City was one mocking term for the hybrid "Derry / Londonderry", as used on transport and other facilities that were trying to be even-handed; it was also a nod towards Ulster's unhealthy lifestyle. Really, is this the most important thing for this city to obsess about? Unemployment, rust-belt industry, paramilitary crime, dysfunctional politics, drug misuse... The turning point was the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. Peace and investment gradually returned and Derry, like Belfast, was able to relaunch itself as a tourist destination. "Splodgederry" is the place you might approach by road, as "London-" is often daubed out on signs. To avoid ambiguity these pages mostly use "Derry" for the city and "Londonderry" for the county, but note the opening sentence above. The county name was never changed, and since these have been abolished as units of governance it must remain County Londonderry.

Watch[edit]
Derry Girls (2018-2022, available on Channel 4/Netflix) is a dark coming-of-age sitcom set in 1990s Derry during the late Troubles and Good Friday referendum. Following the lives and families of five teenagers, who all attend a Catholic girls' school, it intersperses teen chaos and '90s nostalgia with poignant historical moments.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
55.042778-7.1619441 City of Derry Airport (LDY  IATA), Eglinton BT47 3GY (7 miles east of city on A2). Loganair fly from Glasgow and London Heathrow. Ryanair fly from Birmingham and Manchester. A handful of charter flights link Derry to southern Europe in summer. Buses stop on the main road 200 yards from the terminal, see Get Around. A taxi to Derry might be £11 and take 20 min; they usually await incoming flights, otherwise call them from the yellow phones as you come out of Arrivals.   (updated Sep 2021)
You could also fly into Belfast City or International Airport, or Dublin, all with car hire and public transport. The Airporter bus runs hourly from Derry bus station direct to International then City Airport. The bus from Dublin to Derry stops at Dublin Airport, but there are only 3 per day. Another option, albeit a strenuous and complicated one, is to go through Knock/Ireland West airport, located in County Mayo. There is a bus (line 64) that connects the airport to Derry, but it takes nearly 4 hr. Driving takes roughly 2 hr 30 min.

By train[edit]
Peace Bridge over the Foyle.
Trains run hourly, daily between 7AM and 9PM from Belfast Great Victoria Street via Lanyon Place and other Belfast stations, Antrim (for International Airport), Ballymena, Coleraine, Castlerock and Bellarena, taking two hours to Derry; an adult single might be £13. The last stretch of line along the coast from Castlerock is very scenic. Change at Coleraine for trains to Ulster University and Portrush, and for buses along the Antrim coast to Bushmills, Giant's Causeway and Ballycastle.

54.993018-7.312742 Londonderry Waterside railway station (east bank of the River Foyle; walk across the Craigavon Bridge or the Peace Bridge via Ebrington Square or take the bus to city centre).   (updated Nov 2022)
By car[edit]
From Belfast the direct route is M2 / A6, but there are several scenic alternatives depending on how much of the Antrim Coast you want to take in.
From Dublin take M1 to the N33 for Ardee, then N2 north via Monaghan to the border, then A5 via Omagh and Strabane.
Road signs south of the border read "Derry". Those north of the border call it "Londonderry" but are often vandalised. It's as much mischief as political, so don't be surprised to encounter a sign for London Zoo.

By bus[edit]
Ulsterbus Goldline 212 runs from Belfast Europa station to Derry every 30-60 min daily, taking two hours. Bus 273 takes a longer route south of Lough Neagh via Dungannon, Omagh and Strabane. 
Goldline 234 runs from Coleraine, taking 75 min via Limavady, Ballykelly and Eglinton (for LDY airport). There are 7 M-F, 4 Sa and 2 Su. 
Bus X3 / X4 runs 3 times a day from Dublin Busáras and Airport, taking 3 hr 30 min either via Monaghan and Omagh or via Armagh, Dungannon and Cookstown.
Expressway 64 runs every two hours from Galway via Tuam, Knock, Sligo, Ballyshannon, Donegal Town and Letterkenny (the transport hub for County Donegal), then another 30 min brings it into Derry.
The bus station is 54.997-7.3183 Foyle Street Buscentre at the foot of city centre.

Get around[edit]
55°0′0″N 7°19′12″WMap of Derry
East of the River Foyle is the district of Waterside, predominantly Unionist. The railway station is here and to reach city centre you either take the hourly Bus 2d, or walk across Craigavon Bridge which carries the main road, or take a longer walk via the Peace Bridge downstream. 
The main city, bus station and areas of most interest are Cityside, west of the Foyle and mostly nationalist. The city has some steep streets but is compact and walkable; burbs and industry stretch out beyond.
Taxis wait at the bus and railway stations but you're unlikely to need one. You need your own wheels to explore the countryside, such as Grianan of Aileach prehistoric fort or the Donegal coast of Lough Foyle.

Walled city[edit]
City walls and Tower Museum
Londonderry is the only city in Ireland with its walls intact, and one of the finest examples in Europe. They were built 1613-1618 by "The Honourable the Irish Society" to defend settlers from England and Scotland. They're 1.325 km (0.823 mi) in circumference, ranged over the crag that rises from Guildhall to St Columb's. They're mostly over 12 ft (3.7 m) high and wide, with a walkway giving great views over the city, free to stroll with multiple access points. Originally there were four gates: Bishop’s Gate, Ferryquay Gate, Butcher Gate and Shipquay Gate, with Magazine Gate, Castle Gate and New Gate added later. 

 Guildhall, Guildhall St BT48 7BB (opposite Tower Museum), ☏ +44 28 7137 6510. Daily 11AM–4PM. Built in 1890, this fine building is where the city council meet. It's just outside the city walls, and for decades its councillors saw their role as shutting the Catholics out of housing and jobs as effectively as the walls shut out King James. It therefore became a target for nationalists and was twice bombed. It contains a museum exhibit on the history of Derry, a small exhibit on the Saville Inquiry and houses the Nobel, Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr peace prizes of John Hume. In summer there are guided tours but these are suspended in 2021, but an outdoor 15-minute tour is available on request for £2 as of February 2023. Free.   (updated Feb 2023)

Bogside[edit]
This is the valley immediately west of the heights of the walled city, then the ground rises again onto the Creggan estate. A couple of miles further across the fields is the Irish border. Night after night during the Troubles the Bogside was the stuff of newsreels, with protests, vehicles on fire, shootings, and makeshift barricades against police and army trucks. It's an essential part of visiting Derry and the area of interest is within a short walk of the centre, and safe in daylight.

A monument marks the bounds of "Free Derry", the fiercely nationalist quarter of town during the height of the Troubles. Building gable-ends around are painted with the "Bogside Murals" of political art, and another monument commemorates the peaceful protestors gunned down by the British army on Bloody Sunday. Today, it is co-opted for various political movements and memorials via permit at various times of the year, such as for LGBTQ2+ rights and Palestinian solidarity.
55-7.3297 St Eugene's Cathedral, Creggan St BT48 9AP, ☏ +44 28 7126 2894. Daily 7:30AM-8PM. This is the Roman Catholic cathedral for the Diocese of Derry. It was built in neo-Gothic style from 1849 to 1873, like other RC cathedrals in Ireland, famine and penury held up the work, and much of the funding was raised in the USA. The bell tower and spire were added in 1903. There were subsequent renovations, the latest major work being in 2015.   (updated Aug 2021)
Elsewhere[edit]

54.998-7.31639 Peace Bridge  is the footbridge spanning the river between Foyle Embankment city-side and Ebrington Square waterside. An artful modern structure of 2011, it symbolises what you'd expect it to symbolise, but more practically it greatly improves pedestrian access between the two banks.
55.016667-7.43333310 Grianan of Aileach, Burt, Co Donegal. 24 hours. Eochaid, the fair-haired, vindictive; he ordered these a rath to build, Aileach.... - Book of Lecan.

Stay safe[edit]
Free Derry Corner
Derry was scarred by the late 20th century Troubles, and it remains an "interface area" where Republican and Loyalist communities co-exist and occasionally kick off. But it's become a normal city by British and Irish standards, and hasn't seen the need for the kind of "Peace Wall" that still separates neighbourhoods in Belfast. There are down-at-heel districts where you have no reason to go, and aggressive drunks whose politics you need not debate, same as anywhere else. Safeguard your valuables and vehicle, beware traffic, and use your commonsense, you'll do fine.

Connect[edit]
To call a number in Northern Ireland from the Republic, use area code 048 with no country code. The +44 28 versions given above will work but incur international rates.
As of Aug 2021, Derry has 4G from all UK carriers, which extends some miles into the Republic, especially along Lough Foyle west shore.
It also picks up an Irish 4G signal from Eir and Three, and a mobile signal from Vodafone. Neither side has 5G.

Go next[edit]
The County Londonderry coast is scenic: Castlerock has the ruin of an eccentric mansion and "temple". Portstewart is the main beach resort.
The Antrim coast east of Portrush has the big attractions of Bushmills Distillery, Giant's Causeway and Carrick-a-Rede Bridge. It's very touristy on summer weekends.
County Donegal has a rugged coastline and marks the start of the Wild Atlantic Way: you pick up the signposts for this as you cross the border at Muff.
