Annapolis Royal is a tiny, historic town of 530 people (2021) in Nova Scotia's Annapolis Valley.


Understand[edit]
Annapolis Basin at Fort Anne
Annapolis Royal is on Nova Scotia's Annapolis River, about 10km (6 miles) from the Bay of Fundy.
Scottish settlers established Charlesfort, the present Annapolis Royal, in 1629 at the mouth of the Annapolis River. The original French settlement at present-day Port Royal, known as the Habitation at Port-Royal, was settled in 1605.
The French gained control in 1632, with the town serving as the capital of Acadia. Under British control since 1710, it lost the status of provincial capital after the founding of Halifax in 1749.
The British renamed the town Annapolis Royal after reigning monarch Queen Anne (1665–1714). Control of the town has changed many times, with a long history of attacks by the English, French, Acadians and Mi'kmaq.
During the Great Upheaval, the 1755 expulsion of the Acadian people, 32 Acadian families (225 people) deported on the British ship Pembroke took over the vessel and redirected it to Miramichi, New Brunswick. During the American Revolution, Annapolis Royal came under American attack; after that conflict, it became home to United Empire Loyalists fleeing the United States.
Annapolis Royal faced a total of thirteen attacks, including a raid during the American Revolution.
In the 19th century, it was a local centre for shipbuilding; when sailing ships were replaced by steam in the 1880s, Annapolis Royal served as a coaling station. In 1984, it became the site of North America's only tidal electric generating station.

Get in[edit]
Annapolis Royal is 40 km (25 miles) east of Digby on NS Route 1. There is a ferry to Saint John, New Brunswick, at Digby.
A bypass highway, NS 101, approximately follows NS 1 but bypasses the town to the south; exit on NS 8 northbound to return to the old road.
