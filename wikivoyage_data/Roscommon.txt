In town[edit]
Roscommon town centre stands on the former highway north to Tulsk and Boyle, now bypassed to the east by N63. The best of it is "The Square" where the street divides around Harrison Hall to reunite in front of the facade of the Old Gaol.
The Old Gaol in The Square is now a modern shopping centre, and the facade is all that remains of the 18th century original. In the 1790s this had a female executioner, Elizabeth Sugrue or "Lady Betty". Her life and deeds are embellished by folklore, but Sir William Wilde (Oscar's father) collected the tale not long after her reign. She supposedly murdered a man not recognising him as her long-lost son, and was about to be hanged for this with 25 other offenders but the hangman was ill. She volunteered to replace him and her career was launched, as were the 25 other wretches. In 1822 the gaol became a lunatic asylum and in 1833 a Lazaretto, a quarantine confinement for those with dangerous diseases such as smallpox. Sometime after 1840 the building was converted to residential and commercial use.
 Roscommon County Museum, The Square, ☏ +353 90 662-5613. M-F 10:00-17:00, Sa 10:00-14:00. The Museum and TIC are in a former Presbyterian Church built in 1863, a limestone building with a Star of David in the window over the door. Exhibits include a 9th century grave slab from St Comans Abbey, a dugout canoe, and a Sheela na Gig from Rahara church. Free.   (updated Dec 2020)
Harrison Hall in the centre of The Square was the 18th century court house. It's variously been a market hall, RC church, dance hall, cinema and theatre and since 1972 a bank. In the 20th century it was named for Dr John Harrison, who tended to 1840s famine victims in the town workhouse. You can look at the interior during bank opening hours.
 Roscommon Castle, Castle Street. 24 hours. Substantial ruin of a castle built in 1269 by Robert de Ufford, Justiciar of Ireland, on lands seized from the Augustinian Priory. (No point them complaining, the "Justiciar" was both the chief governor and the chief judge, with no "separation of powers"). Although besieged and assaulted several times, it remained largely intact until 1652 when Cromwell set about demolishing all such troublesome strongholds. It was then blown up and the fortifications dismantled, then just for good measure the remains burned down in 1690. Free. (updated Dec 2020)
Roscommon County Library at the corner of Abbey St was built as an infirmary in 1783. This closed in 1941 and in 1989 it was re-fitted as the library, which is open Tu Th 13:00-20:00, W F Sa 10:00-13:00, 14:00-17:00.
Tomb in the Friary, probably of the King of Connacht
53.624766-8.1918021 Roscommon Friary, Circular Rd. 24 hours. Ruins of a Dominican Friary founded in 1253 on the site of a 12th C Augustinian priory destroyed by the Normans. Felim McHugh O'Connor, King of Connacht, was buried here in 1265; the effigy in the north chancel (in very Anglo-Norman regal get-up) is either him or a successor, while the fellows on the tomb front are 15th C mercenaries. The friary was suppressed at the Reformation and the stone of its tower and cloister removed. Free.   (updated Dec 2020)
53.629-8.1952 Sacred Heart Church, Abbey St. Impressive Catholic church in neo-Gothic completed in 1903, with the tower added in 1916. It has a sunken grotto, painted ceiling and mosaic floor.   (updated Dec 2020)

Map of the Rathcroghan complex
53.585-8.274 Castlestrange Stone is a granite boulder with curving incised decorations of La Tène style, so it dates to 200 BC, though the cobble mounting and cattle grid are modern. This Celtic style appeared circa 500 BC in La Tène near Neuchâtel in Switzerland and spread across Europe, so it's become a marker for the extent of Celtic culture. Park at the bend in the public road and walk up the Desmesne driveway. There are three similar La Tène stones across Ireland, more or less in a line, what's that all about? - since they have no obvious astronomical alignment.

53.544-88 Rinn Dúin or Rindoon is an abandoned medieval village on a headland in Lough Ree. The village and St John's Castle were built in 1227, and destroyed in raids in the 13th / 14th. There were attempts to rebuild in the 16th / 17th C - the windmill is from this period - but most of what you see is medieval. You're free to stroll the extensive site anytime.
Don't see Athassel Priory: this extensive ruin is in Golden, near Cashel in County Tipperary, but as of Dec 2020 Google Map imagines it to be near Roscommon Racecourse. Clearly nonsense, since the Augustinian doctrine of Athassel discouraged the monks from going to the races.
