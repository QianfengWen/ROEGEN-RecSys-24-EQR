Stony Plain is a town of 17,000 people (2016) in the Edmonton Capital Region. Stony Plain is known as "The Town with the Painted Past" because of the many painted murals in town. The town was founded as Dog Rump Creek. The region is dominated by agricultural and other resource-based industry.


Understand[edit]
It is west of Edmonton adjacent to the City of Spruce Grove.
The name of the town is believed to have come from one of two possible origins. The first is that the Stoney people camped in the area historically. The second possibility is that Dr. James Hector, a geologist on the Palliser Expedition, noticed boulders scattered across the area. The official name for the settlement was adopted in 1892. Alex McNabb and McPherson were the first homesteaders in the area.
