Understand[edit]
Antioch is one of the oldest towns in California. It was founded in 1850 by two brothers, William and Joseph Smith, who named the town Smith's Landing. In 1851, the town's new minister persuaded the residents to change the name of the town to Antioch, for the Biblical city of Antioch, Syria. Antioch is the 270th largest city in America.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Highway 4 runs through Antioch and splits near the Antioch Bridge, becoming Highway 160 north towards Sacramento while staying Highway 4 south for the route through Brentwood, eventually leading to Stockton. Tolls for the bridge are collected for northbound traffic, and there are 5 exits going East and 3 exits going west on Highway 4. This is the primary route between the Antioch and the rest of the Bay Area, which leads to heavy congestion during commuting hours in the morning and early evening. 

Renting[edit]
With Antioch's considerable sprawl, car rentals are the most convenient form of transportation for visitors. Local companies tend to offer better prices, but national chains might be more convenient as far as return policies and hours
