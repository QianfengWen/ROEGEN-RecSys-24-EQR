The largest city in North Bengal, Siliguri (Bengali: শিলিগুড়ি Śiliguṛi, Nepali: सिलगड़ी Silgaṛī, Hindi: सिलीगुड़ी Silīguṛī) is a liberal and cosmopolitan city that is known for its vibrant music scene and strong youth culture. Located on the banks of the Mahananda River and the Teesta River at the foothills of the Darjeeling Hills, Siliguri is the third-largest urban agglomeration in West Bengal. It is known as the "Gateway of North-Eastern India" as it connects North-Eastern India with mainland India, making it a major trading and transportation hub. It borders Nepal on one side and Bangladesh on the other.


Understand[edit]

Siliguri (Bengali pronunciation: SHIH-lih-GOO-rih /ʃiliɡuɽi/) has a population of 728,000 (2024 estimate) (around 1,000,000 in the metropolitan area), making it the third-largest city in West Bengal.
With massive developments since the turn of the 21st century, the city has grown from a small regional town into one of the most important business centres in Eastern India. Sprawling and boisterous, it is a city whose periphery is dominated by modern condominiums, while the downtown is characterised by sprawling street markets, up-scale shops, and large shopping malls. 
Due to its position as a commercial hub and centre of learning, the city enjoys a sophistication and range of shopping usually only associated with metro cities. Furthermore, as it has attracted a large number of young Nepalese, Sikkimese, Tibetans, and Bhutanese, it has developed into one of India's most liberal and cosmopolitan cities that is known for its vibrant music scene and strong youth culture.
Siliguri is the only city in West Bengal other than Durgapur, Kolkata and Cooch Behar to have airport and, perhaps due to the high concentration of colleges, institutes and private schools, the city has the highest literacy rates in the state. Traditionally, Siliguri has been known for the four 'T's — tourism, timber, tea and transport — and is the gateway to Darjeeling, Sikkim, Bhutan and North-Eastern India.
