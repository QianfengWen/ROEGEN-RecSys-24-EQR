Collingwood sits on the southern shores of Georgian Bay close to Blue Mountain, a promontory of the Niagara Escarpment noted for winter sports and also for its scenic caves. The town is a short distance from the popular Wasaga Beach Provincial Park, a destination that received the title of Biosphere Reserve in 2004.

History[edit]
The land in the area was first inhabited by the Iroquoian-speaking Petun nation, which built a string of villages in the vicinity of the nearby Niagara Escarpment. They were driven from the region by the Iroquois in 1650 who withdrew from the region around 1700. European settlers and freed Black slaves arrived in the area in the 1840s, bringing with them their religion and culture.
Collingwood was incorporated as a town in 1858, and was named after Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood, Lord Nelson's second in command at the Battle of Trafalgar, who assumed command of the British fleet after Nelson's death.
The area had had several other names associated with it, including Hurontario (because it lies at the end of Hurontario Street, which runs from Lake Huron — of which Georgian Bay is a part — south to Lake Ontario), Nottawa, and Hens-and-Chickens Harbour, because of one large and four small islands in the bay.
In 1855, the Ontario, Simcoe & Huron (later called the Northern) Railway came into Collingwood, and the harbour became a busy terminal for goods destined for the upper Great Lakes ports of Chicago and Port Arthur-Fort William (now Thunder Bay). Shipping produced a need for ship repairs, so it was not long before an organized shipbuilding business was created. In 1883, the Collingwood Shipyards opened with a special ceremony. The shipyards produced Lakers and during World War II contributed to the production of corvettes for the Royal Canadian Navy. Shipbuilding was one of the principal industries in the town, employing as much as 10% of the total labour force. However, overseas competition and overcapacity in shipbuilding in Canada led to the demise of shipbuilding in Collingwood in 1986.
The Collingwood Terminals grain elevators were completed in 1929 to bring large quantities of grain and corn from Chicago and Western Canada to customers throughout Ontario by rail, but the terminal and rail connection became less important as trucking became more reliable and when ships gained access to the Atlantic Ocean via the St. Lawrence Seaway completed in 1959. The last railcars left the terminal in 1986, and the terminal closed in 1993.
Government incentive programs attracted new manufacturing firms to the town in the 1970s and 1980s, but its industrial base continued to erode. As the town's economy pivoted to tourism and recreation, the industrial heritage leaves important marks on the town: the grain elevators are still standing as an iconic landmark on the waterfront, and the abandoned railway left stretches of flat trail that now make the Georgian Trail an ideal cycling route through the region.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Collingwood is easily accessed by taking Highway 400 North to Barrie and following Highway 26 West for about an hour directly into Collingwood.  There are also other routes that avoid having to drive through Barrie and also more direct routes from Toronto's west end.

By plane[edit]
Collingwood Airport (CNY3) is about 7.4 km (4 miles) south of the town and serves private and charter flights; scheduled commercial flights are not available. The nearest major airport is Toronto Pearson International Airport.

Get around[edit]

The downtown area of Collingwood is small and very walkable. If your destination is along the main stretch of Hurontario Street, you'll find it easier to park and walk around. In cold weather or at night, taxis are routinely used between the Blue Mountain resort, neighbouring towns, or accommodations throughout the surrounding area. You'll likely need to call dispatch instead of hailing a cab on the street, and there may be a wait during busy hours. Ride sharing apps were prohibited here for many years, and do not always offer quicker service than booking a taxi if few drivers are available.
Be aware that winter weather moves in quickly from Georgian Bay, and snow squalls can suddenly make getting around more difficult, or even dangerous on some roads. Familiarize yourself with winter driving before you arrive, and pay attention to weather forecasts throughout your trip. 

By bus[edit]
Colltrans, Collingwood's transit service, operates three regularly scheduled transit routes every thirty minutes from the 44.50059-80.218331 Colltrans Terminal on the corner of Second Street and Pine Street adjacent to the municipal parking lot at 100 Pine Street. It also has hourly service to the Village at Blue Mountain (7AM-8PM).
Bus service operates on all days except statutory holidays.  Buses are fully accessible and can be used for wheelchairs, motorized scooters, and strollers.  The buses are all equipped with a passenger side access ramp which is available for use upon request as well as Q-Straint securement.   All buses are outfitted with bike racks.
Fares: adults $2.00, seniors/students $1.50, children (5 & under) free.
Collingwood/Blue Mountains link: $2.00 (all riders).

See[edit]
View from Blue Mountain
Historic Downtown Collingwood is a great place to go for a stroll in the summer and have breakfast or lunch at one of the many outdoor patios available.
Collingwood Harbour was a major shipping port in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Most of the shipping traffic from the west ported in Collingwood where cargo was loaded onto trains and transported to Toronto.  It was also a major site for manufacturing of ships up until the late 20th century.  Since the demise of the shipping industry in Collingwood, the harbour has been turned into a great park and the original grain elevators are still standing.
 Collingwood Museum, 45 Saint Paul St (just south of the harbour). Daily 9AM-5PM. It documents much of Collingwood's history including the settlement of the area and the importance of the shipping industry. Popular curiosities include a razor-sharp bill from a sawtooth shark and a twisted piece of metal recovered from the Halifax Explosion. There are paintings by local artists who trained under the Group of Seven, and a 140-year-old statue carved by Sir Sandford Fleming’s brother. Exhibits range from the evolution of local business and industry to the region’s First Nations people. Photographs of Great Lakes vessels, Collingwood’s historic homes, downtown, and early industries are amongst the most popular items. (updated Aug 2018)

Biking[edit]
A network of multi-use trails runs around the entire town and through the adjacent countryside.

The trail was converted from a railway in 1989, so it passes right through the downtown of each of these towns. The shops, restaurants, and hotels along the way are easily accessed from the trail, and there are plenty of rest spots, parks, beaches, public washrooms, and even bicycle repair stations along the way. For a longer ride out of town, the Tom Thomson trail to Owen Sound begins in Meaford.
For a more urban ride, the 44.5123-80.223310 Heather Pathway forms a 20 km ring around the town, between Millenium Park on the east side of the harbour, and Hen and Chicken Point on the west side. Signage along the way highlights historic sites throughout the town. The trail connects to the Georgian Trail, Clearview Collingwood Train Trail, the Collingwood Wasaga Connection, and takes you through Sunset Point.
The Niagara Escarpment also provides opportunities for mountain and cross-country biking.

In the summer months, the Blue Mountain resort provides trails for various skill levels, including 5 downhill and 5 mountaintop trails. Rentals are available, but bicycles are no longer permitted in gondolas. Parking and ticket offices are available at the top.

Locally produced[edit]
In the winter months, it's easy to forget about the fruit that grows in the countryside during the warmer seasons, but this part of Ontario is further south than the grape vines of Bordeaux and the apple orchards of South Tyrol in the Italian Alps.

Condo style and whole-home vacation rentals are the typical accommodation outside the downtown, especially for groups and families staying for more than a night or two, and who want more private space for relaxing, cooking, or getting equipment ready for outdoor activities. Many large hotels and individual chalets are also found in the Village at Blue Mountain, but you'll pay a premium to stay so close to the slopes during the peak season.
