Understand[edit]
Peñiscola is an ancient fortified seaport that was established by the Iberians in 1000 BCE. The port was conquered by the Phoenicians, later by the Greeks, and then by the Carthaginians, where Hannibal famously swore to never ally himself with Rome. Later the Romans and Moors controlled the seaport, until it finally came under Christian control in the 13th century.
