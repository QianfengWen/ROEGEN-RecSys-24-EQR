Happy Valley-Goose Bay[dead link] (HVGB) is a town of 8,080 people (2022) in Labrador, Canada founded in 1941 as a military base and seaport. During World War II, Goose and Gander in Newfoundland were important airbases, later serving as refuelling stops for planes en route to Europe.


Understand[edit]
Austere Operations Training Complex
Dakota Range, CFB Goose Bay
Goose Bay was established in 1941 to host a military base during the Second World War. It was served by coastal ferries, until it was connected to Labrador City by road in 1992 and to Forteau by road in 2009. Air traffic has diminished greatly in the post-Cold War era; a small contingent of 100 troops remains deployed to CFB Goose Bay.
The "Goose and Gander" air force bases are the last military presence in Newfoundland and Labrador, along with a small naval station near St. John's.
Goose Bay is an important seaport for supplies arriving by Trans-Labrador Highway to be sent out by ship to other, more remote Labrador communities. It also served as a base of operations for supplies for a large-scale hydroelectric construction project at Muskrat Falls; that $12-billion project is to feed power by undersea cable from Labrador across Newfoundland to Nova Scotia, from which it can be exported through New Brunswick to the US market.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Highway 500 (Trans-Labrador Highway) runs west to Churchill Falls (288 km) and Labrador City (530 km).  Highway 510 (also part of the Trans-Labrador Highway) intersects with Highway 500 about 13 km west of Goose Bay, and runs south to Forteau (693 km).
A coastal ferry calls at Lewisporte and Cartwright (Labrador), en route to points further north which are not accessible by road.

Goose Bay is a major transit point for traffic to more distant points in Labrador because of its good road, air and seaport facilities:

North West River is a small town only accessible via Happy Valley-Goose Bay around 40 km to the northeast. It is central Labrador's oldest community that was initially set up as a French fur post.
Cartwright (Labrador) is 90 km off the Trans-Labrador Highway "beaten path" (there are no services or fuel at Cartwright Junction) and about 400 km from Goose Bay. Whether one stays on the highway to Port Hope Simpson or turns to Cartwright village, the next fuel station (southbound) is 410 km away.
Charter aircraft from Goose Bay reach various "off the grid" locations, such as outfitters' camps and the Mealy Mountains National Park Reserve
Ferries and aircraft from Goose Bay feed various points northward (as far as Nain) which have no road at all. Saglek Fjord, in the far north of Nunatsiavut, is the main base station and jumping-off point for boat travel into Torngat Mountains National Park.
To the west, there are hydroelectric developments at Muskrat Falls and Churchill Falls.
