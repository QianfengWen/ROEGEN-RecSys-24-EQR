Perth is a city in Perth and Kinross in North East Scotland, with a population in 2016 of 47,430. It stands at a point where the River Tay channels between hills, turns sharply and becomes tidal and navigable. It lost its "city" status in the late 20th century but local signage remained in denial about this until 2012 when Perth's status was restored. Its chief attraction is Scone Palace. 


Understand[edit]
You think you've reached the Highlands as you approach the ridge south of town, but it's just a spur of the Ochils, with the true boundary another ten miles north. Nevertheless it does make Perth a "Gateway to the Highlands", an over-used tourist phrase but well justified here. Cattle drovers, traders and warriors all came this way, following the Tay valley to the lowest point it could be forded. Medieval Scottish kings did the same: they didn't have a fixed capital but their usual abode was "Saint John's Town" at nearby Scone - that name lives on in the local football team St Johnstone. The writer Sir Walter Scott wove the royal dynastic intrigues and adventures into his novel The Fair Maid of Perth, and the place became known as "The Fair City". Perth in Western Australia takes its name from here, as do  Perth, Ontario and  Perth, Tasmania.
Visit Scotland iCentre is the tourist information office, at 45 High Street. It's open M-Sa 9:30AM-5PM.

By plane[edit]
 Edinburgh Airport  (EDI IATA) is usually best choice for its connections across Europe and within UK. It's 50 miles (80 km) south of Perth, and west of Edinburgh city so with a hire car you turn onto M90 and avoid city traffic. Jet 747 bus runs from the airport to Inverkeithing for the train, or to Halbeath for an onward bus. Otherwise take the tram from the airport to Edinburgh Haymarket for trains and buses towards Perth.
 Glasgow Airport  (GLA IATA) has a similar range of flights. It's 70 miles (120 km) southwest of Perth, but west of Glasgow so you have to cross city traffic. Take the airport bus to Buchanan Bus Station in city centre then train or bus to Perth.
 Dundee Airport  (DND IATA) is closer but only has flights from Stansted, London City and Belfast City.
Perth's own airfield at Scone north of town has no commercial flights, though it's busy with private aviation and flight training.

By train[edit]
Wikivoyage has a guide to Rail travel in Great Britain
Trains run to Perth from Glasgow Queen Street (High Level) hourly via Stirling (one hour), from Edinburgh hourly via Fife (80 min) plus others changing at Stirling, from Aberdeen hourly via Dundee (90 min), and from Inverness every hour or two via Aviemore (2 hr 15 min). 
There is one direct daytime train from London Kings Cross, taking six hours to Perth via York, Newcastle and Edinburgh, and continuing to Inverness, but it's usually more convenient to change in Edinburgh. 
Caledonian Sleeper trains run overnight Su-F from London Euston. The Highland Sleeper for Inverness leaves around 9PM and reaches Perth before 6AM, so you'll be woken by 5AM and ejected onto a cold platform with no public transport or amenities available. The return train picks up around 11:30PM to reach Euston for 8AM. You might prefer to take the Lowland Sleeper from Euston towards midnight, and change to a day train in Glasgow or Edinburgh. Returning south, you need to leave Perth around 9PM to join the southbound Lowland Sleeper at Glasgow Central near midnight, and reach Euston shortly after 7AM.
56.392-3.4391 Perth Railway Station is at the southwest edge of city centre on Leonard St. The station is staffed and fully accessible by wheelchair. There are two entrances, both of which allow car parking. The ticket office, newsagent and café are between platforms 2 and 3. The original main concourse was between the current platforms 4 and 7 and the station was covered by a large overall roof, which still exists in a reduced form. At one time there were nine platforms as the station served a leash of branch lines across the county.

By bus[edit]
Replica of the Stone of Scone
Perth bus station is on Leonard Street, 200 yards north of the railway station.
Megabus and Citylink buses run from Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Stirling. There are buses to Oban from May until October. Megabus does not call at the bus station: it drops you at Broxden service area at the A9 / M90 junction, which has a frequent Park & Ride bus into town. 
Megabus and National Express Bus NX590 (daytime) / 592 (overnight) takes 11 hours from London Victoria via Carlisle and Glasgow to Perth, continuing to Aberdeen (another 2 hr). The overnight bus also calls at London Heathrow.

By car[edit]
From Edinburgh and the east side of England follow M90; from Glasgow and the Midlands follow M80 onto M9 / A9; from Dundee and Aberdeen follow A90 west.
The historic Edinburgh to John O'Groats road passed through Perth but the modern A9 is now a bypass to the west. There's a Park & Ride at Broxden roundabout where the M90 terminates onto A9. There's another on A94 at Scone but you're less likely to approach that way.

Get around[edit]

The Palace has an extensive collection of 17th- and 18th-century ivory in the State Dining Rooms, 18th-century French furniture, porcelain, and Queen Victoria's' boudoir.
