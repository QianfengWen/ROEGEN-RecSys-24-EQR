Penticton (The 'Peach City') is a beautiful spot in the south Okanagan nestled between two lakes: The 155 km-long (95 mi) Okanagan Lake to the north, and the smaller Skaha Lake to the south. Tourism in Penticton is largely seasonal. In the summer, tourists double Penticton's population to 60,000. In the winter things used to be very quiet, but now that World Cup Freestyle Skiing stops at local Apex Mountain every winter, the winter scene is picking up.

Understand[edit]
This area has been inhabited for thousands of years by the Salish group of First Nations people. They called their settlement in this area snpintktn which loosely translates as 'a place to stay forever' and gives Penticton its name. The first non-native settler Thomas Ellis preempted land in Penticton in 1869 and started a very successful cattle ranch. With the arrival of engineering marvel Kettle Valley Railway the boom in Penticton had begun. Penticton became a municipality in 1908, and a city in 1948.

Penticton's climate is well suited for agriculture, and thousands of fruit trees were planted all along the west and east bench areas overlooking Okanagan Lake. From cherries in early July to apples and pears in early September, Penticton has always been a large producer and exporter of non-citrus tree fruit. Many local oldtimers decry the trend of ripping out perfectly healthy and productive orchards for the more lucrative vineyards which supply grapes for the regions more than thirty boutique wineries. Today Penticton's two largest industries are tourism and the growing wine industry, which threatens to eclipse the fruit production industry.
Penticton's climate and geography is a northern, four-seasons version of what some call Mediterranean. Large clay banks, benches, and scrubland skirt the mid-level mountains that frame the valley on the east and west sides. Summers are hot with an average temperature of 27°C, and peaks of 35-40°C are not unheard of. The large size of Okanagan Lake tempers the climate in winter which sees an average high of 0.9°C in January. It can and does snow occasionally, but generally only during December and January will it accumulate in modest quantities. You can check the snow level with a quick glance to the mountains, which will have a white apron about half to three-quarters of the way up. Penticton gets about 2000 hours of sun per year, which is a higher average than Rio de Janeiro.

This is the second Peach, as the first was pushed into the lake during the 1990 Peachfest riot (The riot was an isolated incident, Penticton is really quite safe.) 
Do[edit]
Outdoors[edit]
Perhaps the best thing to do in Penticton is to join the locals at the beach, and enjoy the blisteringly hot summer sun. 49.5018-119.60491 Okanagan Beach follows pretty much the entirety of Lakeshore Drive on Okanagan Lake, and is generally the more family oriented beach. 49.453-119.58382 Skaha Beach to the south on Skaha Lake is where Penticton's younger crowd go to see and be seen. 49.4524-119.59533 Sudbury Beach and 49.452-119.60244 Airport Beach are also on Skaha Lake, west of Skaha Beach on the south side of Highway 97 (Caution: Sudbury is used as a kitesurf launch during the off-season.). 49.5377-119.57645 Three Mile Beach is a good bet when the crowds at the other beaches are getting you down. Just north of town, follow Naramata Road north, turn left at Three Mile Road, and follow down to the lake. If you walk along the beach to the north you will find an unofficial nudist area.

"Skaha" as it is known among climbers, has over four hundred established routes with a near equal split of traditional (gear) and sport (fixed bolt) lines that range between 5.6 and 5.13b.   (updated Nov 2014)
Cyclists and hikers will want to visit the stunning Kettle Valley Trail which follows the old railway grade from Penticton through Naramata's bench wineries, and farther along, a system of tunnels and trestles leading all the way to Castlegar and beyond, some several hundreds of kilometers. Part of the Trans Canada Trail which bills itself as the longest recreational trail in the world. You can also travel the railway grade on the opposite side of the lake 10km to Summerland which is gatewayed by the dramatic Trout Creek Railway Trestle, the highest in British Columbia.
Another traditional pastime in Penticton is floating down the River Channel, which is a small shallow river that flows south from Okanagan Lake to Skaha Lake. This leisurely trip takes from 2 to 3.5 hours depending on water levels in the channel. Be sure to bring sunscreen or you will burn up! If you have your own flotation device and can work out the logistics of getting a ride and keeping your valuables dry, you can do the full channel for free.

49.4981-119.615511 Coyote Cruises, 215 Riverside Dr, ☏ +1 250 492-2115. 10AM-5PM. If you don't have your own flotation device or can't arrange transport, Coyote Cruises is a convenient way to go.

(updated Nov 2014)
Festivals[edit]
Penticton is also a city of events and festivals. Indeed, in the summer there is rarely a time when there isn't some sort of festival going on. Dates and venues can change from year to year, check the websites for current information. A brief survey of the major festivals includes:

 Beach Blanket Film Festival (late July). This unique festival invites people to lay down a blanket on the beach, bring a picnic and watch films on a floating screen in Okanagan Lake. 
 Okanagan Fall Wine Festival (September-October). More of an 'Okanagan' festival than a Penticton one. Many wine-diner pairings featuring local wineries and restaurants, stretching from Osoyoos (at the US/Canada border) to Vernon at the northern end of Lake Okanagan. Several of these take place in Penticton. (updated Mar 2023)

(updated Mar 2023)

Wineries and viticulture[edit]
Lake Okanagan and benchland
The Penticton area has many wineries, and indeed more seem to spring up everyday. The terroir of the Naramata Bench is considered the premier wine growing region of British Columbia for its climate and geography (though growers in the Golden Mile region of Oliver to the south may disagree). The popularity of this relatively new industry has driven the price of local products well over the price of a comparable French or Italian bottle. Most wineries offer free tastings and tours, and will almost certainly sell their products directly. To be sure of the best quality look for bottles that sport the VQA designation, which ensures authenticity of origin, and a minimum standard of quality during grape growth, harvest, and production.

Breweries[edit]
Back in its heyday, Penticton had three nightclubs in town, but with changing times they have all shuttered down and turned into microbreweries. So many in fact that Penticton is a part of the BC Ale Trail and has the beginnings of a Brewery District. 
Most breweries are focused in the downtown core. Some notable breweries include: 

Barley Mill Brewpub, See above under Pubs.

Sleep[edit]
As with restaurants, the amount of accommodations available in Penticton is disproportionate compared to the size of the city. Still, Penticton is very popular in the summer and the area hotels can and will be fully booked, especially on long weekends and Ironman weekend. Prices listed here are high season, as this is when most visitors come. Low and shoulder season rates may be drastically lower depending on the facility. The listings here are but a mere smattering of what's available.

Stay safe[edit]
There is not much to worry about in Penticton. The streets are generally safe after dark and the huge number of tourists on the streets ensures you are never alone. The biggest safety issue may be the occasional bar brawl that occurs when the clubs close. Make sure you do not get involved or you will end up spending the night in jail.
If you are hiking or biking in the surrounding hills be aware the area is home to rattlesnakes and bears. The snakes, easily detected by their distinctive rattle, do not attack humans unless you enter their space and/or startle them — such as abruptly walking into one along a trail.  If you hear the rattle, understand it as a warning and keep your distance; the snake's bite can be fatal. Similarly, black bears inhabit the region surrounding Penticton and are happy to avoid humans unless surprised, cornered, and/or their cubs are threatened. Bear attacks are extremely rare but if you spot a bear in the area, it is best to steer clear. Cougars are being spotted by the locals more.
