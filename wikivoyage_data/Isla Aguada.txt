Isla Aguada, Campeche
Isla Aguada is a small coastal island town on the Gulf of Mexico in Campeche, Mexico. With only about 5,000 inhabitants (2020), it's off the beaten path but has miles of beaches and lush natural areas nearby, particularly the protected nature reserves of Laguna Terminos with its population of bottlenose dolphins. It is one of Mexico's Pueblos Magicos.

Nature reserves[edit]
Laguna Terminos is a large protected estuary that's a nesting area for sea turtles, a breeding grounds for dolphins, and a haven for more than 200 bird species, including both local and migratory species. Bird Island is the habitat of the Jabirú stork, the largest aquatic bird species, and is also a nesting and feeding area for ducks, herons, frigate birds and seagulls. A birdwatcher could spend several days along the shores of Laguna Terminos.

History[edit]
Isla Aguada has a long and colorful history, having been occupied many centuries ago by the Mayan Chontal group, who called the place Hol tun. When the Spanish arrived in 1518 they called it Puerto Deseado but changed their minds in 1519 when they dubbed it Puerto Escondido. 
The Spanish didn't build a town or settle there. The island was largely uninhabited in the 18th century when pirates found the island to be a great hideout from the ships of the Spanish Armada, at least until 1762 when the pirates had plundered a ship laden with merchandise. The pirates took their booty back to the island but the governor of Campeche was ticked off and sent two naval ships after the pirates. They found the pirates on Isla Aguada, recovered the merchandise, killed many pirates and took the rest prisoner to be hanged back in Campeche. Good times, man!  Good times!
Subsequently, the governor had a fort and watchtower built on the island and the garrison of soldiers established the first settlement. Mayan refugees from the Caste War settled in the town and the establishment of a port provided the economic foundation for the new town.
Isla Aguada is usually a quiet town where nothing happens...until it does. On August 22, 1980, the ferry from Campeche to Merida, laden with cars, trucks and passengers, approached too close to the island during a storm. The ferry capsized killing an estimated 150 people.
