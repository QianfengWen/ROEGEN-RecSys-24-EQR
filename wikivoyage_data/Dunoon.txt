Dunoon is the ferry port and only town on the Cowal peninsula, in Argyll and Bute in the Scottish Highlands. It's 30 miles (48 km) from Glasgow yet cut off by Loch Long to the east and Loch Fyne to the west. The peninsula is broken up by the inlets of Loch Goil, Holy Loch and Loch Striven, so the roads have to wind around. A narrow channel separates Cowal from the island of Bute. The area is hilly, containing the "Arrochar Alps" or Argyll Forest, the western portion of Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park. In 2020 the population of Dunoon was 7660.

By boat[edit]
There are two ferry crossings to Dunoon: see Gourock for fares and other details. By public transport, use the foot-passenger ferry from Gourock, which has frequent trains from Glasgow Central via Paisley, Port Glasgow and Greenock. Calmac ferries sail every 30 min from Gourock to 55.946-4.9221 Dunoon ferry pier, taking 25 min. Until end of March 2024, the return fare is £10.20 adult, £5.10 child. 
By car, follow M8 > A8 > A770 west through Gourock and continue west to McInroy's Point. Western Ferries sail every 20 min (7AM-11:40PM) to 55.971-4.9092 Hunters Quay, at the north end of Dunoon by the mouth of Holy Loch. The crossing takes 20 min. 
You can reach both ferries on McGill's Bus 901, which runs from Glasgow Buchanan station hourly to Gourock, and continues south to Wemyss Bay and Largs. Don't take the 906, which runs further inland. 
Two other roundabout routes to Cowal and Dunoon are the ferry from Tarbert (Loch Fyne)  to Portavadie, then follow B8000 / A8003 northeast; and to cross the Isle of Bute (ferries from Wemyss Bay to Rothesay, then Rhubodach to Colintrave) and drive north.

By car[edit]
The car ferry to Hunters Quay is the quickest way, see above. But you can do it all by road, to create a circular itinerary, or if the weather's rough and the ferry is likely to be cancelled. From Glasgow take M8 west to cross Erskine Bridge, then A82 north past Dumbarton and Loch Lomond to Tarbet, then A83 west over "Rest and Be Thankful" to the A815 turnoff. Follow this south past Strachur and Lock Eck to Dunoon; maybe two hours altogether.

Get around[edit]
You really need a vehicle or to be a keen cyclist. Buses are sporadic M-Sa and there's nothing on Sunday.
West Coast Motors Bus 486 runs four times from Dunoon north along A815 to Sandhaven, Whistlefield Inn, Strachur, Cairndow and Inveraray. Bus 484 runs twice M-F along the same route to Strachur then turns south to Lochgoilhead and Carrick Castle.
Bus 478 runs three times from Dunoon west along the B-roads to Sandbank, Auchenbreck, Tighnabruaich and Kames and Portavadie, which has ferries to Tarbert (Loch Fyne) on Kintyre. Colintraive is covered via the journey to connect with the Bute ferry.
Bus 489 follows the coast from Toward to Innellan and Dunoon, and continues north round Holy Loch to Sandbank, Kilmun, Strone and Ardentinny, roughly every couple of hours.
Bus 480 loops hourly between Dunoon, Hunters Quay pier and the holiday village.
Over in Tighnabruaich, Bus 471 serves a local service in a village from the north end to the south of Kames and over to Millhouse and Portavadie on Tuesdays-Thursdays about 5 or 6 times. Bus 473 connects Kilfinan, Otter Ferry and Largiemore to Tighnabruaich via Millhouse at least twice M-Fr

Mar-Oct: daily 10AM-5PM. 120-acre estate managed by the Royal Botanic Gardens of Edinburgh, you enter through a towering avenue of 150-year-old redwoods. RBGE have placed many of their Chinese and Himalayan collections here, where the climate suits, and the rhododendrons are rampant in early summer. Wear sturdy shoes. Adult £8, conc £7, child free.

55.9985-4.9462 Kilmun Arboretum is on the hillside north of Holy Loch: suddenly you're among sequoia, redwoods, Oregon maple and eucalyptus. Deliberately non-native: over 260 species were planted here in 1930 to see what would grow in Scottish conditions, and these are the survivors.
Castle House Museum, near Dunoon ferry pier, is open M-Sa 10AM-4PM, adult £3.50, conc £3.

Castles around Cowal are mostly just scenic stumps, you come for the view. These are
Dunoon Castle survives only as a hillock above the harbour, though it had artillery emplacements during World War II.
Hafton Castle by Hunters Quay is a lodge with mock castellations, available for upscale self-catering at £7000 / week.
55.867-5.00843 Lamont Castle or Old Toward Castle is 6 miles south of Dunoon, little more than an overgrown hummock. It's within the grounds of the 1820s Toward Castle, which served 1942-46 as HMS Brontosaurus, making it Scotland's only castle to operate as a Royal Navy warship named after a dinosaur. No visits there, but the owners permit responsible access to the old castle, follow the marked trail.
56.0725-5.14964 Dunans Castle on A886 above Ormidale is a 19th-century baronial mock-castle ruined by fire in 2001 and unsafe to enter. The owners run an equally bogus "lord and lady" scheme, you buy a square foot of land and get an ornate scroll declaring you Lord / Lady of something or other, but it's meaningless.
56.1085-5.20945 Old Castle Lachlan is on B8000 at Cairndow - the nearby New Castle Lachlan is a baronial pile used for weddings and so on.
55.9635-5.34126 MacEwan Castle is by Kilfinnan, further south on B8000. You'll need to use your imagination with this medieval lump.
55.8842-5.28467 Ascog Castle two miles west of Kames village is similarly dilapidated but tenaciously defended by midges.
Carrick Castle below Lochgoilhead is a long way round by road, and it's closed for restoration. The village takes the same name.
55.9838-5.31498 Auchnaha Cairn is a chambered tomb maybe 5000 years old. It's broken up and in later times a Latin Cross has been carved into one of the stones.
