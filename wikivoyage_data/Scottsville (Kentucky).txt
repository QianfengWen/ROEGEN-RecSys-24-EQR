Historic Sites[edit]

Public Spring, Locust St., one block from KY 100 South. Scottsville became the county seat of Allen County because of the spring. It was not only the source of fresh water for the area but the hub of commerce. The spring also provides a seasonal supply of fresh water cress, an early spring salad green.
The Tabernacle, KY 100 East. The Tabernacle was built in 1897 and seat of early revivals and gospel singing held in Allen County.  The early days of the old Tabernacle with its sawdust floors and handheld fans formed the foundation for Allen County deep gospel roots. The Allen County Singing Convention is held at The Tabernacle in September.
Mennonite Community[edit]
Travel back to the turn of the century by visiting the Mennonite Community located between KY 100 and 585 and KY 1332 . Calling themselves the "plain people", they lead a simple life with no electricity or gas-powered machinery. See molasses made the old-fashioned way in the fall; shop for fine fresh produce in the summer; and purchase handmade leather items. Specific location maps are available at the Scottsville-Allen County Chamber of Commerce.

Connect[edit]
By phone[edit]
Most telephone numbers in Scottsville consist of +1 270 plus a seven-digit number, but the area is now served by an overlay complex of two area codes, with +1 364 being the second. A local or in-state telephone call now requires all 10 digits of the local number be dialed (omitting just the leading +1 from a local landline call).
Signage on many established businesses may still display the original seven-digit numbers; dial 270 before these if no area code is indicated.
