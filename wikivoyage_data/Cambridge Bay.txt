Cambridge Bay is a hamlet of about 1800 people (2016) on Victoria Island, in western Nunavut. It is the largest settlement on Victoria Island.  Cambridge Bay is the largest stop for passenger and research vessels traversing the Arctic Ocean's Northwest Passage, a disputed area which the Government of Canada claims are Canadian Internal Waters, while other nations state they are either territorial waters or international waters.


Understand[edit]
Cambridge Bay is named for Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge. The traditional Inuinnaqtun name for the area is Ikaluktutiak (old orthography) or Iqaluktuttiaq (new orthography) meaning "good fishing place".
To the north of the community is Ferguson Lake which flows into Wellington Bay via the Ekalluk River. The Ekalluk River is an important commercial fishing and archaeological area. The area was a traditional hunting and fishing location and archaeological sites are often found. 
Barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus), muskox (Ovibos moschatus), ringed seal (Pusa hispida), lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) and Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) were the primary prey, and remain important food sources. East of Cambridge Bay is Ovayok Territorial Park, which includes the large esker known as Ovayok (Mount Pelly).

History[edit]
The first known people to occupy the area were Pre-Dorset seal and caribou hunters, somewhere around 1800 BC, about 4,000 years ago. The next groups to enter the area were Paleo-Eskimo and Thule peoples; around 1500 AD, the modern Inuit made an appearance. 
The first Europeans to reach Cambridge Bay were overland explorers led by Thomas Simpson in 1839; they were searching for a Northwest Passage and had crossed the sea ice on foot. Another overland expedition led by John Rae reached Cambridge Bay in 1851, and the first ship to reach the bay was under Richard Collinson who wintered there in 1852/53. Both Rae and Collinson were searching for Franklin's lost expedition. Collinson's ship came from the west, having entered the Canadian Arctic via the Bering Strait. This was the furthest east any large ship travelled from the Bering Strait until Henry Larsen in 1941. Cambridge Bay was the site of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) outposts established during the 1920s. Although at this point most Inuit would have continued the traditional lifestyle and only visited the area rather than live there permanently. The HBC opened a post here in 1921, later than in most places, and built at the site now called the "old town".
A Distant Early Warning Line site was established in 1955, and about 200 Inuit were hired to help in the construction.

Climate[edit]
Cambridge Bay has a polar climate, no month having an average temperature of 10 °C (50 °F) or higher, and has never recorded a temperature above freezing between 31 October and 19 April.

There isn't much to see in terms of sites. You're really coming to Cambridge Bay to experience life in a remote Arctic community. 

69.11712-105.0231711 The Old Stone Church. The Roman Catholic stone church was built by the Oblate Missionaries in 1954 construction. The church was constructed from local material using seal oil and sand as mortar, and was used for services until the 1960s. In 2006, a large portion of the church, which had been designated a heritage site by the Hamlet Council, was destroyed by a fire which the RCMP said was deliberate. It is a great vantage point for photography of the hamlet across the water. (updated Jun 2020)

69.1786-104.7271 Ovayuk Territorial Park (Uvajuq) (15 km (9 mi) east of Cambridge Bay). The park is named after a 200-m-high mountain that can see from the town on a clear day. Ovayuk is a distinctive feature of this flat coastal area, and has been a landmark for nomadic Inuit for many generations. There is a legend about giants who starved on the land. The Arctic Coast Visitor Centre can provide a guidebook that describes some 20 km of trails, camping areas and interpretive signage. The mountain is a four- to six-hour hike, or a 30-minute trip by car, from town. Muskoxen are often spotted along the road leading to the park.   (updated Jun 2020)
