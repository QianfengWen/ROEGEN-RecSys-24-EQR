By bus[edit]
There are first and second class buses from the ADO bus stations of Cancún, Tulum, Playa del Carmen, Valladolid, Mérida and Chetumal. The 18.685088-88.3953991 ADO bus station of Bacalar is 1 km outside the center in the north west on the Highway 307.

• M$250 (Feb 2022) with second-class Mayab bus,
• M$286 (Feb 2022) with Autobuses Unidos (AU) and 
• M$324 (Feb 2022) with ADO. 
You find the schedules of ADO and AU in the ADO app or website. The schedules of Mayab you see on the LCD monitor of an employee inside a Terminal ticket booth.

By shared van[edit]
From Tulum and Chetumal you can also take a colectivo. It is only possible to carry small luggage with you as there is no trunk. From Tulum it's M$70 (Feb 2022) to Carillo (Felipe Carillo Puerto). And again M$70 (Feb 2022) from Carillo to Bacalar.
Colectivo from Tulum to Bacalar 180M$ (Mar 2024).

By train[edit]
Tren Maya, Mexico's newest intercity rail system serving five states in the Yucatan Peninsula region, has a station in Bacalar, providing service to Chetumal, Tulum, Cancun, Merida and other destinations in the region.

Get around[edit]
On foot or bicycle would be very doable if you are staying in the city of Bacalar, as well as taxis, which are not expensive.

Map of Bacalar
The water of Lake Bacalar is among the most pale and gemlike blue that could possibly exist. The main attraction of traveling to this area is the lake, whose beauty could easily induce one to sit and read for a few days without regret. The lake is somewhat shallow at the shores, except where there are sinkholes commonly known as cenotes. It is well seen by kayak or sailboat. The sand when disturbed smells strongly of minerals or sulfur, though sitting by the lake or even being on the water certainly carried no odor whatsoever.
Be aware that the lake is closed for activities on Wednesdays
