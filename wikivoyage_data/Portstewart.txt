Portstewart is a beach resort, historically in County Londonderry in Northern Ireland. The town is in Causeway Coast and Glens District, and in 2011 had a population of 8003. It was a small fishing village until it grew up as a resort in Victorian times, and is now encrusted by holiday homes. The beach is the main attraction, and a few miles east of town are the big tourist sights of the Causeway Coast.

See[edit]
55.168-6.7451 Portstewart Strand  is a two-mile spit with a sandy beach backed by grassed-over sandhills. Behind is the golf club and the River Bann, which flows out at the west end of the spit; there's no footbridge or ferry across to Castlerock. The Strand is the town's main beach (the Promenade beach is rocky except for one small corner) so it's a popular destination for kiddy-bathing. The area is owned by the National Trust: it's free to access dawn to dusk but you pay for parking, on the beach itself. Traditionally you could drive further up the Strand but that's no longer allowed, and in early 2021 you must pre-book your parking space to ensure distancing.

Locally the best section is the waymarked trail east along the coast to Portrush, Bushmills and Giant's Causeway; you could walk one way and ride the bus back.
