Downtown Boonsboro
Boonsboro is a small town in Washington County, Western Maryland. Boonsboro is primarily an agricultural center, but it's also just a nice historic town for a leisurely lunch or dinner, and perhaps a stop at one of the museums, while exploring the area.


Understand[edit]
The town dates back to the late eighteenth century, when, according to local legend, it was founded by two brothers of Daniel Boone. Unsurprisingly, given its proximity to Antietam, it saw major fighting during the Civil War, and housed numerous soldiers following Antietam. 

Get in[edit]
Map of Boonsboro

Boonsboro is at the intersection of US-40 and MD-34, so take the MD-34 exit off I-270 to the southeast of Hagerstown and northwest of Frederick. Sharpsburg and Antietam National Battlefield are just southwest of the town on MD-34.

Get around[edit]
While the town is small enough to cover easily on foot, you will want a car to explore the surrounding areas.
