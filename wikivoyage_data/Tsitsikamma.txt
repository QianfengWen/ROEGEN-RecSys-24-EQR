Tsitsikamma is in the Cacadu District of the Eastern Cape of South Africa.


Understand[edit]
The Tsitsikamma forms part of the Cacadu District of the Eastern Cape and is branded as one of the Cacadu District's seven wonders due to its beauty. Tsitsikamma is a Khoi word meaning "place of abundant or sparkling water". The area is covered in large tracts of indigenous forest and Fynbos with deep river gorges that cleft the plateau as they make their way down to the sea, creating spectacular waterfalls and deep kloofs.
A must-see is the Tsitsikamma National Park with its abundance of birds and wildlife, and the chance to watch whales and dolphins play along the rugged untouched coastline or explore the Khoisan rock art and enjoy many walking and hiking trails. From treetop canopy tours, white water tubing to experiencing a 7-second free-fall from the world's highest commercial bungee jump location, Tsitsikamma is an action packed destination for the adventurous. Alternatively, you could take a walk on the wild side in the indigenous Tsitsikamma forest - home to the giant Outeniqua Yellowwood - or simply relax and unwind in a completely serene wonderland of forest, mountain & sea.

 The Big Tree (In the Tsitsikamma forest, just off the N2 between the Storms River Bridge and the Storms River Village turn-off. You will see the signboards.). One truly massive old yellowwood tree. Another Big Tree is situated near the Khoi San Village at the Bloukrans Bungy site. 
Langkloof (Route 62) - Better known as the Fruit Route, the Langkloof fruit region is the second largest deciduous fruit-producing area in South Africa. This used to be the home ground of Bushmen and Gonagua Hottentots. Today the 'Apple Express' runs through the valley, linking all the fruit growing villages and towns.
 Joubertina. Established in 1907 on a section of farmland, it is home to the famous Kouga Mummy - the only mummy ever found in the southern hemisphere, and early Bushmen paintings. The first building in Joubertina, the Dutch Reformed Church was erected in 1911 and is still standing today. Other than historical significance, Joubertina also has over 30 mountain bike and hiking trails to choose from. The Kloof Hotel and the Hotel Tavern have great historical significance. Be sure to have a look at the display of over 1000 miniature car models at the Hotel Tavern. 
 Kareedouw. This little town's name is derived from the Khoe phrase meaning "path by the Karee trees". It is 120 km from Port Elizabeth, Kareedouw is the gateway to the Langkloof and is nestled between the Tsitsikamma and Suuranys Mountains. Look out for the high quality black-, yellow- and stinkwood furniture produced here, and for the numerous interesting National Heritage Sites. 
 Krakeel River. In Krakeel, almost all the houses are situated on the banks of the river which originates on the northern slopes of Formosa Peak (1675 m high), the highest point of the Tsitsikamma Mountains. The Formosa Nature Reserve is situated between Haarlem and Krakeel River. 
Nature's Valley — a small village on the Garden Route mostly  surrounded by the Tsitsikamma National Park with a network of trails that covers the surrounding hills and beaches

Activities include canopy tours, various exciting hiking trails and the Storms River Mouth Walks. The Tsitsikamma Petroport has a restaurant, curio shop, petrol station and take-away outlet. The Bloukrans Bridge is the world's largest single span bridge and is also home to the world's highest bungee jump location. For the less adventurous, there are curio shops, spectacular views to take in and the indigenous plant nursery in which to get lost.
Tsitsikamma National Park - The heartland of Tsitsikamma National Park stretches 5 km to sea, protecting a wonderland of inter-tidal life, reef and deep-sea fish. Dolphins frolic in the breakers, surfing and playing while the gentle giant of the ocean, the Southern Right Whale, comes inshore to breed. Sightings of wildlife in the Park are not uncommon so be on the look out for African Black Oystercatchers, the Knysna Loerie, Cape Clawless Otters and the Blue Duiker.

Amidst the tranquility there is still room for adventure. Tsitsikamma offers everything from hiking trails to quad-biking, to 4x4 routes, canoeing, white water tubing, treetop canopy tours, bird watching and abseiling in the Kouga Mountains.
