Do[edit]
Playa de San Marcos

Unfortunately, all the little restaurants down at the beach were damaged by the 2018 winter storm and closed down (as of January 2019), but some options remain a bit higher up at the Avenida Maritima. Be aware that sunbathing is not really possible until the afternoon, as the steep cliffs surrounding the village of San Marcos block the sun in the morning. Free. (updated Jan 2019)
