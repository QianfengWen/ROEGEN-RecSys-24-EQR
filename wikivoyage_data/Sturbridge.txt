Sturbridge offers an exciting shopping, dining, and recreation destination. Located in southern central Massachusetts, Sturbridge is easily accessible via major routes from all directions and is a major stopping point for people traveling between Boston and Hartford, Connecticut, and further on to New York City.
Sturbridge has maintained a unique blend of modern convenience and historical charm. There are many lakes and outdoor activities in Sturbridge and the surrounding area.
This is a small town with great small town charm. The buildings and people are unique and enchanting.

Get in[edit]
Sturbridge and surrounding areas are easily accessible.  There are two major highways that meet in Sturbridge.  Interstate Route 90, also known as the Massachusetts Turnpike, is a toll road running east to west through Massachusetts.  Sturbridge is Exit 9 off of the Mass Pike.  Connecting Sturbridge to Hartford, CT and beyond is Route 84.  Although designated as running east to west, it actually runs more or less a northeast to southwest route.
In addition to the major routes, several secondary highways offer additional routes into town.  Running from Boston in the east to the Pacific Ocean on the west, Route 20 bisects Sturbridge.  Route 131 connects Sturbridge to Southbridge and on further south to Route 395 in Connecticut.  Route 49 connects Sturbridge to Spencer and Route 9, another busy east-west route across the state.

By plane[edit]
The nearest large airport is in Worcester, but it has limited service. Bradley Airport (BDL IATA) in Windsor Locks, CT serves the Hartford, Connecticut and Springfield, Massachusetts area.
Approximately 5 mi (8 km) from Sturbridge is the Southbridge Municipal Airport.  It is a small regional airport.

Get around[edit]
Most people will find using a car the easiest way to get around town. There are a lot of small back roads that lead to hidden treasures and historic buildings.  A lot of the best shopping in town is on Main St (Rt 20), and is very walkable. The sidewalks are easy to travel on and there are benches to rest on looking at the trees and flowers and stores.  There is a well maintained bicycle and hiking path accessible from the Westville Recreation area on the border of Sturbridge and Southbridge that has a connecting bridge at the dam area. An easy walk about a 2-mile loop.
A different way to travel around town is also by kayaking and boating. There are numerous rivers and ponds that will allow you to travel from one section to another by water. This is very scenic and shows off the wildlife and environment of the countryside.
Driving also allows you to see the damage from the tornado that hit (June 2011). You are able to see the direct path that it took.
