Cleveland's, and the Mississippi Delta's, primary value as a tourist locale is its beautiful scenic views, quiet small town atmosphere, and its relation to Delta blues folklore.

Drive 20 miles west to Rosedale and visit the Great River Road State Park[dead link]. The park offers magnificent views of the Mississippi River with access to sandbars during the drier seasons. The park also boasts a 75-foot-high lookout tower that provides panoramic views of the Mississippi River. Below the tower is a picnic area, swings, grills, and a large reservable pavilion for group events. The park is named for the Great River Road, a scenic parkway that follows the Mississippi from its beginning as a small Canadian creek to its end at the Gulf of Mexico.
Find the original Old Highway 61, which starts just west of Rosemary Road at Hwy 61. Somewhere this road will cross with the original Old Highway 49, where it is said that Robert Johnson sold his soul to the devil in exchange for secret knowledge that helped him pioneer the blues.
