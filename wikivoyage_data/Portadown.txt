Portadown is an industrial town historically in County Armagh in Northern Ireland, but since 2015 part of the Armagh-Banbridge-Craigavon District. Its population in 2011 was about 22,000. Its eastern parts are called Craigavon for the new town that was only partially built there.  


Understand[edit]
Craigavon: an unpopular name
Standing at the south tip of Lough Neagh, Portadown was traditionally a linen-processing town that became a transport hub. In 1741 the Newry Canal linked Lough Neagh, Portadown, and the sea below Newry. In the 19th century the Dublin-Belfast railway arrived - the line swings inland through Portadown to avoid the hills south of Belfast. In 1965 construction began for a new town, Craigavon, intended to stretch from Portadown to Lurgan. Some housing estates were built but the project flopped as investment and employment drained from the area, perhaps a blessing in disguise as the design was based on ugly Cumbernauld in Scotland. It also offended potential Catholic residents that the place was named after Lord Craigavon (1871-1940), first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, who sought "a Protestant parliament for a Protestant people".
The sectarian rift deepened during "The Troubles", with a steel wall dividing embittered Catholic and Protestant sections of the community. One local flashpoint was the Drumcree conflict, about the rights of Orange Order parades to bang their drums along a particular route, as they had since 1807 when those districts were farmland and the cows didn't mind, and to continue doing so although (and perhaps especially because) these were now housing estates with a mostly Catholic population. That conflict was dampened by the 1998 Good Friday Agreement between Britain and the Republic of Ireland. The GFA has enabled Belfast and Londonderry to relaunch themselves as destinations, but Portadown in common with the rest of Armagh has not yet done so.

Battle of the Diamond
In the 1780s, the north of County Armagh was mostly Protestant and the south was mostly Catholic. Sectarian fighting broke out, and the two sides formed gangs. The Diamond is a crossroads on the Loughgall-Portadown road, where on 21 Sept 1795 there was a shoot-out between some 300 Protestant "Peep o' Day Boys" and a similar number of Catholic "Defenders", who'd occupied Dan Winter's farmhouse. The Protestants had a better ridge-top position and suffered no fatalities; estimates of Catholic losses range from 6 to 48. Afterwards the Peep o' Day Boys headed to a nearby pub and founded the "Orange Order" to unite all Protestant factions. Over the following winter, they systematically smashed up Catholic houses and linen looms and drove them out of the county.

Armagh has long been the ecclesiastic capital of Ireland, with two cathedrals, and a prehistoric "fort" that was clearly a religious centre.
