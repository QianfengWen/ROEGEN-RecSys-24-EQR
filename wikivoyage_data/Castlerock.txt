See[edit]
55.17-6.7741 Barmouth is the breakwater channeling the outflow of the River Bann. The breakwater on the other side is at the end of Portstewart Strand but there's no river crossing.
55.155-6.78992 Hezlett House, 107 Sea Rd BT51 4TW, ☏ +44 28 7084 8728, downhilldemesne@nationaltrust.org.uk. Daily 10AM-5PM. Built around 1691, this thatched cottage is one of the oldest buildings in Ulster.  (updated Jul 2021)
55.164-6.8123 Mussenden Temple and Downhill Demesne, Mussenden Rd, Castlerock BT51 4RP. Daily 10AM-5PM. Wacky ruined estate on a headland, built in the late 18th century for the Lord Bishop of Derry. It's within walking distance of the village but most visitors park on A2 either at Bishop's Gate (small but free) and walk up through the woods, or at Lion's Gate (charges) and enter via the Walled Garden, which is more accurately a walled lawn with toilets. On the headland you first reach the mausoleum to the bishop's brother, then the vast shell of the mansion: this was fire-damaged in 1851, restored, then abandoned and largely dismantled in the 1950s. (A visitor of 1812 reckoned he'd "never seen so bad a house occupy as much ground.") The temple teeters on the edge of a cliff, which has been stabilised to prevent it tumbling to the shore way below. It's modelled on Bramante's Tempietto in Rome, which is in turn based on the Temple of Vesta at Tivoli. Also nearby is a Belvedere. Lion's Gate parking £5, NT free.   (updated Jul 2021)
