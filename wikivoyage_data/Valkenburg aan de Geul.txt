Not to be confused with Valkenburg in the Bollenstreek..

Castle ruins overlooking the town
Valkenburg is a city in the south of the Netherlands, usually buzzing with visitors. It has been a major domestic tourist destination for decades and packed with hotels, bars and restaurants. The crowds that gather here in summer partly come for the town's interesting historic sights but also for the general atmosphere and facilities. Christmas is the second high season here, with plenty of decorations up from the start of November and famous Christmas markets in December. In many ways, Valkenburg as a town seems to encourage visitors to just have a good time.

Understand[edit]
Siege and conquest were characteristic of the history of Valkenburg, and the town's centre holds plenty of evidence of former grandeur. The castle in the middle of the city - of which now only a ruin remains - was destroyed in December 1672. Only two city gates (the Berkelpoort and the Grendelpoort) and a part of the city walls survived destruction and both have been thoroughly restored.
In 1853 a railway station was built on a line connecting the two cities of Maastricht and Aachen, making it possible to discover the charming little town of Valkenburg.
Nowadays Valkenburg is famous for its cycling events and its touristic character. There are several attractions to be found within walking distance of the city centre, and the many hotels, restaurants and café's cater to domestic and international travellers of all ages.

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
Valkenburg has the oldest stone train station in the Netherlands. It is on the train line between Heerlen and Maastricht with connections from both sides every 15 minutes. The trainline is operated by Arriva train trips can be planned with the NS Reisplanner [1] or 9292.nl.  The city center can be reached on foot from the train station in 5 minutes. Internationally, there is a direct train from Aachen in Germany.

50.8691675.8327781 Valkenburg railway station, Stationsstraat 10.   (updated Aug 2021)
By car[edit]
The city is also situated along the A79 motorway between Heerlen and Maastricht, making it easily accessible by car. There are several indicated parking spaces, usually for a fairly steep fee. In high season, parkings fill up fast so arriving early is a good idea. Otherwise, count on walking a bit further.

By bus[edit]
Buses depart from the bus station, near the train station, to Maastricht (line 51 en 53), Gulpen and Geleen (line 49) and other places in the region.

Get around[edit]

Most attractions are easily reached on foot from the city center. Thermae 2000 and the Holland Casino are at the top of the Cauberg and require a fair climb for Dutch standards. The tourist office [2] [dead link] (VVV) can be found near the large rock (Kei) in the city center.
It is also possible to rent a bike to explore the beautiful surroundings of the city. Within a ten-minute walk from the train station bikes can be rented from Cyclecenter.
Zuid Limburgse Stoomtrein Maatschappij operates a steam locomotive between Valkenburg and Kerkrade and a branch to Vetschau in Germany. Trains run during the summer holiday season, the Sinterklaas (November to December 5) period and the Christmas period.

This remarkable reconstruction of ancient Roman catacombs may not hold any actual graves, but it does provide a fine insight in the structure and purpose of these old Roman subterranean dwellings. Visitors are shown around by a guide who can offer a good range of details. Try to make reservations in advance, if you want an English language guided tour. The whole thing was initiated in the early 20th century by the rather eccentric Jan Diepen, who made his fortune in the textile industry but was an amateur archeologist. €7.50/3.75 for adults/children. 
50.8645765.8313182 Kasteel Den Halder, Kerkstraat 31. Castle is not open to visitors.

The castle was founded in the 12th century; the tower and the fortified communicating passages, some of them hewn from the rock, were built later. After several sieges and several rebuilds, the ruined castle was abandoned in 1672. A secret passage led from the castle to the caves hewn from the rock below. 
50.8646995.8324094 Christmas Market. This is not just any Christmas market; it's one of the most famous in the wide region. Taking place in and around the catacombs, it's a market much after the German traditions of Christmas markets. You'll find all kinds of decorations plus some tasty sweets and food.

Do[edit]
Megalosaurus inside the Gemeentegrot
The local marlstone was already being used as a building material in Roman times. The underground quarrying of the stone has left a series of caves, which is arguably the number one attraction that stands out in Valkenburg. You could visit any number of times and still find something new and different. The caves themselves are a treasure chest of art and expression. As a tip, take a digital camera (with a flash, the guide is the only person who has a torch!) and be prepared to take a lot of photographs. There are amazing images and drawings hidden away in the darkness.
