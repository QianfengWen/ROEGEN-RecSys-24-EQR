Get around[edit]
5°43′40″S 39°17′41″EMap of Nungwi
The 'boat yard' in Nungwi, with its tapping and tamping and seemingly casual activity, calls for photographs. At sunset about 50 boats leave from Nungwi, all of them with white sails at a certain angle, to go deep sea fishing at night: another beautiful sight.
The aquarium on the north coast of Nungwi near the lighthouse, rears small turtles found on the beach until they are large enough and then released to survive in the sea. The aquarium is a natural pond with seawater that seeps through the cliff at high tide.  There is also a python, monitor lizard, and tortoises that can be handled.
At low tide, wade far out into the ocean.  Be careful not to step on sea urchins.

Eat[edit]
Budget[edit]
-5.7275739.293711 Murina Cafè. Local food, clean and cheap. 
Mid-range[edit]
 Langi Langi Beach Bungalows Restaruant. Excellent food with a fine sea view. One of the better places to eat in Nungwi Tsh 13,000. 
 Flame Tree Cottages Restaurant. This place has a shorter menu than most places, and the food is mediocre at best. If you're not a fan of seafood, ask before ordering anything not in the seafood section of the menu - even the "Chicken with coconut sauce" is mostly fish. 
Drink[edit]
 Cholo's bar. The most chilled out bar ever. Hamocks above the bar, the urinal is a bath tub and the benches are halved dhows. The beer is Tsh 3,500 for Tusker Kili or others. The music they play is well selected and makes the beach, which the bar is directly on, even more pleasant to do nothing on.

Stay safe[edit]
Although Nungwi is normally quite a friendly and safe place to be, there have been some thefts of guests' belongings. Some basic care should be taken whilst handling money. Most of the hotels do have a safe for guests' use, which should be used for storing hard cash and valuables.

Go next[edit]
Kendwa, 3½ km to the south, can be quieter although its full-moon parties are gaining in popularity.
