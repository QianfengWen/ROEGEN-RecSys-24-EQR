Cape Canaveral is a city in Brevard County, Florida, most famous for being the home of America's spaceport, Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (CCSFS).


Understand[edit]
Cape Canaveral is part of a region known as the "Space Coast", since all of the manned United States spacecraft are launched from the Space Coast. The city sits at the northern end of a barrier island on the Atlantic coast of Florida, south of the geographical cape. Falcon 9 (pictured above), the first rocket to land its first stage, takes off from the Kennedy Space Center. The visitors' complex of the space center is found across a waterway, to the west.
The northern part of the city, known as Port Canaveral, is one of the U.S.' main ports for cruise ships.
