Resort area of Virginia Beach
Virginia Beach is a resort city in southeast Virginia on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean.


Understand[edit]
Virginia Beach offers the classic beach vacation, and maintains a long-standing reputation as a family-friendly oceanfront resort. Visitors are greeted by a 300 ft (91 m) wide beach lined by Virginia Beach’s 3 mi (4.8 km) concrete oceanfront Boardwalk. The resort offers a mild climate year-round. Itineraries include lazy days on the beach, the state parks and Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge beckon, hiking, kayaking, and biking adventures. Fishing, golfing, whale watching, dolphin watching, historic landmarks, and exciting attractions and popular events are part of the Beach experience.
Virginia Beach was formed in 1691, and in 1963 it annexed all of surrounding Princess Anne County.  Today it is the most populous city in Virginia, and also contains the tallest building in the state (the Westin in Virginia Beach Town Center).

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Virginia Beach is served by Norfolk International Airport (ORF IATA) in neighboring Norfolk, which is just west of the border between the two cities.

By car[edit]
If you are coming from the Delmarva Peninsula, or anywhere northeast of it, the fastest way to drive to Virginia Beach is down Delmarva Peninsula, onto U.S. Route 13, and across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel.
If you are coming from anywhere northwest or west of the area, the fastest way is along Interstate 64.
Coming from the south or southwest, it is easiest to take Interstate 85 or 95 to US 58.

By train[edit]
While Virginia Beach has no train station, nearby Newport News has at least two daily trains both to and from Boston. There is also an Amtrak station in nearby downtown Norfolk. Amtrak provides a connecting shuttle bus from both stations to Virginia Beach; make sure to select Virginia Beach as your destination when booking tickets.

By bus[edit]
Sprinter Bus operates daily service between Virginia Beach and Dover (Delaware) ($35) and New York City ($45).  Their phone number is: 1-757-456-5555.  In Dover, catch the bus at 1131 North Dupont Hwy, Dover.  In New York City, catch the bus at 201 West 37th St. in Times Square.  Buses drop you off at 5461 Wesleyan Dr., about 2 mi (3.2 km) east of Norfolk International Airport.  If you want to take the local HRT bus to the beachfront you will need to take the number 22 bus to Newtown Road light rail station and transfer to the 20 bus going east.

Get around[edit]
Virginia Beach is easily traversable during the off-season but not during the main season by car. The Boardwalk is traversable by walking or biking. Surreys are popular and can fit from 2 to 7 people. Bike and Surrey rentals are all along the Boardwalk and Atlantic avenue.
For getting around by bus use the Hampton Roads Transit Website.  It uses Google Maps to plan public transit trips.  Bus fare is $1.50 per ride.
If you are staying at the Oceanfront, there are a few ways to get around the beach area, including the trolley and bus system operated by Hampton Roads Transit. If you want to explore other areas in Hampton Roads, the best way is to rent a car.
