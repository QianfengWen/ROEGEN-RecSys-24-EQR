City of Hawkesbury is in the far northwest of outer Sydney in New South Wales.


Understand[edit]
The City of Hawkesbury is a large semi-rural area to the northwest of Sydney. Some of Australia's oldest colonial settlements are to be found here, and have remained underdeveloped in the years since. The outward development of Sydney's suburbs has reached the area, and it could now be considered part of Sydney proper.
The Windsor area represents the third-oldest area of European settlement in New South Wales (after Sydney and Parramatta). Settlers arrived here in 1791 and called it "Green Hills". The town was inaugurated in a drive by Governor Macquarie to build cities worthy of the thriving new colony - it was named after Windsor in England, site of a royal castle.
Windsor can make an interesting trip into Sydney's history, well off the beaten path for most visitors.  You can find graveyards and sandstone among the car-yards and supermarkets.

Richmond Post Office building
The town of Richmond was settled by Europeans in 1794 to set up farms and feed the new colony of Sydney.
Kurrajong is further to the north in the area, a very rural town that acts as an entrance to the Blue Mountains.
