Güímar is a town on the island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands archipelago. It is best known for its 6 Guanche pyramids, and for a ravine called the Barranco de Badajoz. A coastal part of Güímar, dominated by volcanic landscape, has been protected as the Nature Reserve of Malpais of Güímar. Güímar's harbour district, Puertito de Güímar, has many restaurants and taverns that offer patrons a view over the ocean. It is a modern residential suburb compared to most of Güímar and has ample facilities for walking and cycling.


Understand[edit]
Guimar Plaza
Güímar is used to refer to the municipality and town with the same name, as well as the famous valley in the eastern part of Tenerife. It borders La Orotava and the Teide National Park to the west, Arafo to the north, and Fasnia to the south. The town has 20,000 inhabitants (2018).

History[edit]
Until the 15th century, the territory of modern Güímar was part of the Kingdom of Güímar, an aborigine (Guanche) Menceyato. Its economy was based on livestock (goats, sheep, pigs) and agriculture, as well as fishing and forestry.
After the conquest of the island, an attempt was made to integrate the Guanches into the new society, but few managed to obtain ownership of the lands they possessed previously. As a result, many were forced to continue to live in caves like Guaza in relative isolation until the 17th century.
The first modern settlement was established in the 16th century in the neighbourhood San Juan, referred to as Güímar de Arriba. The first buildings constructed were linked to a sugarcane mill founded by the brothers Juan Felipe and Blasino Piombino. The economy gradually diversified, and vineyards replaced much of the sugarcane sector. Güímar became known for its honey as well.

Cacti grow to tree-like proportions in Güímars hot steppe climate.
Güímar has a hot semi-arid climate, with extremely dry summer months (June-September) and limited rain the rest of the year. Temperatures vary between ca. 12°C in winter to nearly 30°C in summer, when its steppe climate is fortunately tempered by the mild influence of the Atlantic Ocean. A pleasant wind makes the temperature even in summer quite tolerable, but make no mistake: the sun is shining mercilessly, and sun cream is a necessity!

Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
Línea 111[dead link] stops along the highway, connecting with Santa Cruz, Costa Adeje and the southern airport. From there you have to walk to the road connecting Güímar with Puertito de Güímar, from where to the center (3-4 km away) you can catch another more regional bus connecting both towns.
Línea 035[dead link] and Línea 037[dead link] connect with Granadilla de Abona and Arico.

Get around[edit]

On foot[edit]
The city centre of Güímar is walkable, with the ethnographic park about 10 min uphill from the 28.31571-16.41141 Plaza de San Pedro. 

By car[edit]
Finding a parking spot can be challenging in Puertito de Güímar, so it might be easier to commute with a TITSA bus rather than driving.

See[edit]
Güímar has enough to offer to spend at least a day exploring its natural and cultural treasures. The pyramids in the Ethnographic Park are the best known attraction of Güímar, but for those not interested in archaeology there are churches, architecture, and nature also well worth visiting.

Lava stone pyramids in the Ethnographic Park
28.320833-16.4136111 Ethnographic Park (Parque Etnográfico Pirámides de Güímar), Antropólogo Thor Heyerdahl (Calle Veltran de Liz N°43), ☏ +34 922 514 510, piramides@piramidesdeguimar.es. 09:30-18:00 daily except 1 Jan and 25 Dec. Historic site with the 6 remaining lava pyramids, dated to the 19th century. The pyramids were popularized by adventurer and publisher Thor Heyerdahl, who researched the pyramids and became the driving force behind the development of the park. The origin of the pyramids is an ongoing topic of discussion: Heyerdahl believed until his death that their origin dates back to the Guanche period, whereas excavations by the University of San Cristobal de la Laguna suggests they can be no older than the 19th century. The current hypothesis is that the pyramids are a byproduct of farming practices at the time, a result of farmers clearing potentially arable areas from volcanic rocks and piling them up in the most efficient way. The park is set up as a Thor Heyerdahl theme park. The 6 remaining pyramids with adjacent museum, a botanic garden, and garden with poisonous plants can be visited. There is an optional exposition on Polynesia, which isn't worth the extra money. The audio guide (included in the premium ticket of €18) is highly recommended, a complete visit takes about 3 hours. At the end of the visit there is a cafetaria for snacks and drinks, as well as a souvenir shop selling memoralia, post cards, and seeds of endemic Canarian flora such as the Canarian palm tree and Drago tree. The cafeteria is open from 9:30 until 17:00. Adult €18, child €6.50, student €13.50.   (updated Oct 2019)

The crater of the Montaña Grande is ca. 300 m in diameter and 50 m deep, and notably asymmetric due to the effects of wind during its formation.

A ravine with archaeological evidence of Guanche activity, including several Guanche mummies. There are many legends of people experiencing supernatural phenomena when visiting the ravine late in the evening or staying the night. Some people claim to have seen angels, UFOs, strange orbs or fireballs, and so on. Whatever may or may not be true of those, the natural beauty of the area makes it worth a visit. There is also industrial heritage to be discovered, with 6 mine shafts, aquaducts, and ruins of buildings spread along the length of the ravine. As of 2019, a land slide blocks the path about 100 m before the end of the ravine, restricting access. The riverbed is dry in summer. None of the mine shafts are accessible, with sings warning that the atmopshere down the shafts is not breathable. Free.   (updated Aug 2019)

The hike is not suitable for people with vertigo and should only be undertaken by more or less experienced hikers. It is a full-day tour to reach, wander and leave the trail again. For the tunnels you will need a flashlight, but your phone's one should be enough. The tunnels have sharp rocks inside, so a helmet would be optimal, but also a basecap will lower potential injuries in case you do not pay attention and hit your head. In case you are keen, a part near the middle of the tunnels are without canal and provide space to put a mattress or even a small tent.Download trail coordinates: GPX, KML.  (updated Mar 2023)

Güímar is closer to the metropolitan region of Tenerife than to the south:

Santa Cruz de Tenerife – The capital of the island and multicultural metropolis
Candelaria – A coastal city with magnificent basilica, ca. 15 km north east of Güímar
La Esperanza (El Rosario) – Famous for its mist forests
San Cristóbal de La Laguna – The former capital of Tenerife, its historic centre is a  UNESCO World Heritage Site
Teide National Park –  UNESCO World Heritage Site with an active volcano
La Orotava – Despite its proximity, can't be reached easily from Güímar because there is no mountain pass between the two. You will either have to make a detour through the Teide National Park or through La Esperanza.
