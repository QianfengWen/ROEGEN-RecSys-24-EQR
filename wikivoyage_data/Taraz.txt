Taraz (or Taras) is in the Kazakh Desert.


Understand[edit]
Nowadays a near-border city between Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, Taraz was once right in the heart of the Silk Road. Taraz first entered the history books over 2000 years ago when Han and Xiongnu forces warred here. The Soviets changed the name of the city to Zhambyl in the 1930s but soon after Kazakhstan's independence, the name was changed back to Taraz.
