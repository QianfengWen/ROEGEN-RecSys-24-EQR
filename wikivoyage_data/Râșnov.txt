Râșnov is a town in Transylvania, Romania, in the popular tourist county of Brașov.


Understand[edit]
Râșnov is part of the region called Burzenland, a historical region that was colonized by Germans. The town itself was founded by German settlers in the 13th century near the site of an old fort dating from Thracian-Roman times. It is home to a freshly restored Saxon fortress from the 14th century, and also to many old Saxon houses. The German name of the town is "Rosenau", which means Rosepond. There are about 15,000 inhabitants who live next to a huge forest that leads up the mountains. The river Ghimbasel (German: Weidenbach) crosses the town. Today most of the population is Romanian, but there are also Romas, and some Germans and Magyars. The city is rapidly developing towards an important tourism town, while new pensions and attractions are being developed. Those who rush through Brașov county, stop by to see the fortress, but many people take the time to stay here for a few days and enjoy its blend of nature and fun. Others choose it as a cheap and quiet base to explore the surrounding area with its numerous attractions (Brașov, Sinaia, Bran, Zărnești, Prejmer, etc.)

Hitchhiking[edit]
Caragiale Street in Râșnov.
Hitchhiking to Râșnov from Brașov is a regular practice. The place you can try are the intersection of Lunga Street with soseaua Cristianului. Be sure to stand on the side of the road that goes out of the city (across the street from Bartholomeus Church). The second spot is down that road, toward Pitești, on the strip between Eliana Mall and the train crossing.
Hitchhiking from Bran is also quite a natural phenomenon: stay in the bus station or on the road and signal your intent.
Hitchhikers have been seen to be picked up from the road Predeal - Brașov, but you will certainly need more patience.
It is polite to give the driver about 2-3 lei per person, from all these directions.

Any taxi driver will be glad to take you to Râșnov, but make sure you choose one which runs for a company. The price per kilometre should not exceed 2 lei, and it must be shown on the door of the cab. You will also have to pay for the trip back that the taxi driver will have to make. The double fee per km will be calculated from the moment you are at the train passing and exit Brașov (but the sign with crossed Brașov will be reached only after 2-3 km). The total trip from Brașov (train station) should not cost more than 40-45 lei.

Main attractions[edit]
The foot way to the old fortress, Râșnov.
45.59055625.4688891 Râșnov Citadel (Cetatea Râșnov). 09:00-19:00. Built in the 14th century by the local Saxons, it was meant to protect them from invaders and protect the Burzenland's southeastern border, just 15 km away. It has been renovated and is the best-preserved fortress in Romania. It also offers a breathtaking view as sits on a big hill. In the fortress you can have a drink, and shoot with a bow. 12 lei for adults, 6 lei for minors, students and retired.   (updated Sep 2018) How to get thereː
by car: from Râșnov city centre take the road towards Poiana Brașov and right where Râșnov ends go left. A forest road leads up to the parking for the fortress. Can be crowded and tight in high season.
by foot: a wonderful walking path takes you from the center to the fortress, through a shady forest (but it is now under construction). As you face the hill from the city centre, you will see a big entrance between two big old buildings (on the left there is a shop, and on the right a pub). Go through that entrance and follow the path. Walking time: 15-20 minutes. Difficulty: you need to be more or less fit, but certainly not a passionate hiker.
by funicularː it's close to the above-mentioned path.
by foot (alternative)ː Go along "Strada Cetății" until you reach a big parking place. There is a big cobblestone road that goes up to the castle. Here you may also take a "train" (actually a tractor with a trailer) that will take up the hill for a few lei (only during tourist season). However, it is extremely slow (walkers can pass it little effort) and generally not worth the money.
45.5917125.4656592 The Evanghelical Church (Biserica Evanghelică) (Right in the city center.). It was built in the 13th century and the murals date from around 1500.  
Old Orthodox Church: from the centre park with the hill on your left hand side, go straight and then the second street to the left (quite a small street). Total walking distance: about 10-15 minutes. The church was built in 1384 by the Dan I Basarab. It also houses a small museum.
Cheile Râșnoavei - this green canyon is appreciated for its beauty not only by locals and tourists but also by movie producers who have filmed here. In the canyon there is a fast mountain river with many small waterfalls. Here you can bungee jump, rappel, walk, drive an ATV, climb, picnic, tent (but beware of bears), or just enjoy this natural and well preserved area.
Other attractions[edit]
Cheile Râșnoavei, raining.
Old Saxon houses: in the centre towards the north. From the center park, with the hill on your right hand side, go straight and you will find several streets with old houses. After you pass the school go right, and follow the road that goes under the hill. You will end up with a beautiful walk through the forest. Most houses are 100-200 years old, and quite a few are beautifully restored.
Old Saxon cemetery on Armata Romana street.
Roma neighborhood. The Roma neighbourhood is towards Pârâul Rece (Predeal).
Orchids several orchid species can be found around and in Râșnov. It is also the home town of the Romanian Orchid Lovers Club[dead link].
Surroundings: you can go to Bran and see the old Castle, or to Zărnești and visit the Piatra Craiului National Park, one of the greatest in Romania. You can visit Brașov, Poiana Brașov and Predeal. Râșnov, or Rosenau, was one of the towns in the old Saxon Burzenland, and around it you can visit the other old towns. Sinaia with Peles Castle and the view from 2200 m is a great place to visit.

Extreme[edit]
Cheile Râșnoavei.

Paragliding
Get eaten by a bear - certainly a life's experience. The huge forests that stretch out towards Poiana Brașov and Predeal are home to many wild bears. If you tent at night in the wrong place you might make a new hairy friend. Warning: Bears are really dangerous, and camping in Cheile Rasnoavei might result in an encounter. Unless you camp at the entrance of the canyon, on the field side of Râșnov, in a fenced camping or in a yard, you expose yourself to the life-threatening situation of being visited by a rude bear who will disregard your gun, stick, fire, ninja sword, pepper spray or air gun. Bears go out at night. Walking in the forests during the day is safe, and a common practice for locals. If you encounter a bear at night it is looking for food, which is not you, but all the vegetables you are traveling with (or, if it is starving, the meat). Let it do its feeding and retreat slowly.
