Glen Innes is a town (population 6,155 in 2016) in the New England region of New South Wales in Australia.


Understand[edit]
Grey Street, the main street of Glen Innes
The indigenous Ngarabal people are the original inhabitants of the district, they called the site of the town 'Gindaaydjin' which means 'plenty of big round stones on the clear plains'. The first farm in the district was established in 1838, and two stockmen (livestock workers) known as 'The Beardies' (because of their long beards) worked on this farm and helped other settlers establish their farms, which led to the district being known as 'The Land of The Beardies' to this day. Glen Innes was gazetted as a town and the first lots of land in the town were sold in 1852. Tin was discovered at nearby Emmaville and the railway arrived in 1884 (now closed). Wool, sheep, and beef cattle are the main agricultural industries, and sapphires are found in the creeks.
Glen Innes is the main centre of the Glen Innes Severn Shire Local Government Area.
