Kuusamo is a town and a municipality of same name in Northern Finland. The high season for tourism is the winter when people head to the 66.1678229.126581 Ruka skiing resort 20 km north of the town. However, the 66.375629.28272 Oulanka National Park 20 km farther to the north is also very popular and can be visited around the year.
Together with its neighbouring municipality Taivalkoski, Kuusamo forms the Koillismaa sub-region. Traditionally Koillismaa ("the north-east") refers to a bigger area, from Pudasjärvi to south-eastern Lapland.


Understand[edit]
Myllykoski rapids of Kitkajoki, Oulanka National Park
Kuusamo is located in the Koillismaa highlands. It is a watershed, as rivers in the northern part flow north-east to the Arctic Ocean and those in the southern part flow westward to the Baltic Sea. The views consist of steep forested hills (Finnish: vaara) and large, pristine lakes. Bogs and mires are common especially in southern Kuusamo. The river Oulankajoki belongs to the official list of national landscapes of Finland.
Even though Ruka often is referred to as a fell, there are no true fells in the Kuusamo area, as none of the hills reach the tree limit. The area has almost continental climate. Mean temperatures vary between −15 °C (5 °F) in January and +15 °C (59 °F) in July. The coldest temperature, −48 °C (−54 °F), was measured in January 1985. Annual snowfall is among the highest in Finland and ground is covered by snow up to 200 days a year! 
According to archaeological evidence, the Kuusamo area has been inhabited at least for 4,000 years. Finnish-speaking settlers arrived here during the 1670s, mostly from the south by following the labyrinth of lakes from the Finnish Lakeland. Therefore the local spoken dialect belongs to the Finnish Eastern dialect group, in contrast to Lapland, where people speak western dialects. As the lands weren't part of the Kingdom of Sweden, the Sami tried to sue the settlers for illegal hunting and fishing, but as the number of Finnish settlers had grown to over 200 people by 1687, there was little what the court could do. The last Sami left the area before the 1760s. Kuusamo was separated into an independent parish in 1675, and got its own church in 1680.
The population grew quickly, but subarctic agriculture is dodgy. During bad years in 1800–1802 up to 40 per cent of Kuusamo population died in famine. In the peace treaty between Finland and the Soviet Union of 1940, Finland lost 1,700 km² of land from eastern Kuusamo. In September 1944 the area suffered heavily from the scorched-earth policy of retreating Nazi German troops. In the next year, Soviet troops briefly occupied Kuusamo, demolishing the little infrastructure left. This is why you'll find very few old buildings in the area.
Today Kuusamo lives mostly from tourism. The number of summer cottages is the 5th largest in Finland. Finns coming from cities to spend their holidays at their private cottages are a significant source of income. So far there isn't any mining industry, but international mining companies are interested in the area. There is especially uranium ore and copper. The municipality has slightly over 15,000 inhabitants out of which 8,400 live in the town. The population trend is declining.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Most people travel to Kuusamo by car. Expect about a 10-hr drive from the southern part Finland, more in the winter when there is snow, ice, and lowered speed limits. The town of Kuusamo is at the intersection of highways 5 and 20. The Ruka resort and the road to Oulanka National Park are also by the highway 5, north from the town.
65.798730.09931 Kuusamo border crossing (Kuusamo-Суоперя) is open daily 09:00–20:00. In 2021, it served cargo traffic, and Finnish and Russian citizens returning home. The nearest town in Russia is Kestenga (Кестеньга, Finnish: Kiestinki) in Russian Karelia. As of March 2024, the border is closed.

By train[edit]
The nearest train stations are in Kemijärvi (135 km) and Rovaniemi (180 km). Often Oulu (205 km) is more convenient, with connecting buses timed to train arrivals.

By bus[edit]
It takes 3 hr by coach from Oulu to Kuusamo and about ½ hr more to Ruka. The one-way ticket costs €30–40/adult and there are 2–3 departures daily. If you are heading to Ruka, for most departures you need to change bus in Kuusamo centre. This may require some waiting at the 65.9691329.173982 coach station. 
There are regular connections from Rovaniemi (3–3½ hours, €30–40), Kajaani (3½ hours, €26) and Kemijärvi (2½ hours, €21). From Rovaniemi airport (via the coach station) there is a connection to Ruka every morning on weekdays. The trip takes 6½ hours and requires changes at Pudasjärvi and Kuusamo centre. Price ca €60/adult.
See Matkahuolto for details.

By plane[edit]

Get around[edit]
National road 20 in winter
Having your own car is the most practical way of getting around in Kuusamo. Aside from a few intercity buses and school buses a day, public transport is non-existent. You can also get around by taxi, but given the distances, it is pretty expensive.
Local bus traffic consists of two lines serviced a few times per weekday during the school year, but not in weekends or summer. Information about local and regional buses can be had from the municipal office. Matkahuolto route planner includes the local and regional routes.
You can also use coach lines for travelling in Kuusamo: coaches towards Oulu for the south-west, towards Kajaani and towards the Kuusamo border crossing ("raja-asema") for the south, towards Rovaniemi, Salla and Kemijärvi for the north. Timetables from Matkahuolto.
There is also a dial-a-ride service available, which services mainly as a connection between Kuusamo and Ruka, but which can be used also for rides within Kuusamo. It can be ordered using Matkahuolto Trip Planner and Tickets mobile app. The passenger can pick up the ride up to five days and can check availability at any time, and secure the ride as well as the seat only by ordering transportation. The app always shows the final binding price before confirming the order.
Driving around during weekend is popular among the youth. Snowmobiling is very popular in Kuusamo and there are hundreds of kilometres of snowmobiling routes. The Ruka village and Kuusamo centre are compact enough for betting around on foot.

Although Kuusamo is slightly south of the Arctic Circle, there is two weeks of midnight sun. Choose from were to watch, to avoid having the sun go hiding behind a hill at some point (and don't look at the sun!).
At the winter solstice daylight lasts about three hours, and the auroras can be seen all winter, although they aren't as common a sight as a few hundred more kilometres to the north.

Out of town[edit]
 Karhunkierros (The trail of the bear) (nearest starting point in Ruka). The most popular hiking trail in Finland having up to 60 000 hikers each year (though not all of them trek the whole trail.) The 80-km-long trail leads through two beautiful national parks. There are also several shorter variations of the trail. The trail is easily accessible from Kuusamo airport with a bus that takes you to the beginning of the trail. Although the trail is quite easy, you should still be prepared with a decent map and enough food. Water is not a problem, as there are plenty of rivers that have clean and drinkable water. There are several open wilderness huts (Finnish: autiotupa), where you can stay overnight for free, but huts tend to get full during peak season, end of June to beginning of August, so you really should consider bringing your own tent. It is possible to extend the hike all the way to Urho Kekkonen National Park by the UKK trail.
