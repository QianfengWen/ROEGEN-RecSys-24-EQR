La Orotava is a city of 42,000 people (2018) in Tenerife. Its historic centre is included in the Inventory of the European Cultural Heritage Protection, and much of the Teide National Park (a World Heritage Site) is in the municipality.


Understand[edit]
Located in the fertile Orotava Valley uphill from Puerto de la Cruz, La Orotava (from Guanche: Arautaba) was established in 1504 by the Spanish following their conquest of Tenerife. As the area was blessed with a mild climate, many Spanish elite chose to settle here; most of the city's historic buildings from this early period have been preserved and now now fall under landmark protection.
The municipal boundaries of La Orotava encompass most of Teide National Park, making it the largest municipality in Tenerife. It can be a good base for hiking, with many trail heads just outside the city and easily accessible by bus.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
La Orotava lies just south of the TF-5 expressway, 26 km from La Laguna and 35 km from Santa Cruz. Parking spots in the city centre are very scarce (see transport map for options), and day-trippers will likely find it much easier to visit the city by bus.

Considered to be the finest example of Spanish Baroque in the Canary Islands, the current structure was built between 1768 and 1788 on the site of several earlier structures, the earliest dating to the late 15th century. The sculpture in the plaza in front of the church represents an alfombrista, an artist responsible for the volcanic sand 'carpets' created during Corpus Christi celebrations.  (updated Dec 2016)

Named after the Prussian naturalist Alexander von Humboldt, the view today encompasses many more buildings than it did in his day when he passed through the valley and admired it in 1799. It's unclear whether this exact spot is the same visited by Humboldt (there is also a restaurant and another parking spot with the same name); from both spots however there are fantastic views from La Orotava to Puerto de la Cruz, and on clear days the peak of Teide is also visible. Take a moment too to look in the other direction – on the upper part of the mountain is the 28.40727-16.5061613 Cueva de Bencomo, where it is believed the Guanche king Bencomo once lived.

Do[edit]
Corpus Christi volcanic sand 'carpet' in the Plaza del Ayuntamiento
Creation of Corpus Christi flower 'carpets'
 Festividad del Corpus Christi (Feast of Corpus Christi). 60 days after Easter, usually late May or early June. The Catholic Feast of Corpus Christi has been celebrated in the Canaries since the arrival of the Spanish in the 15th century. As in some other nearby parishes, street processions take place atop elaborate flower 'carpets' (alfombras), laid out the day before by neighbourhood groups, in a tradition practiced since the mid-19th century. Unique to La Orotava is the giant volcanic sand 'carpet' in the Plaza del Ayuntamiento. This tradition dates to 1912, and its creation requires several weeks; visitors can observe the process from the upper steps of the plaza. (updated Dec 2016)
 Hiking. Given that Teide National Park extends right up to the edge of the city, Orotava is a good starting point for a number of hikes of varying length and difficulty, a few of which can be accessed by public bus. However, the wildfires of 2023 caused massive destruction in the forests above the Orotava valley. As of early 2024, the whole area of the fire is completely off-limits for civilians and virtually all nearby trails are closed. Check the official map for up-to-date information before you head out.
